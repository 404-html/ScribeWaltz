1
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.670
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.671 --> 00:00:06.360
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.500
April 13th,

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.640
2015 w you know Monday the 13th is not bad luck.

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.190
It's Friday the 13th so fucking relax.

6
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:20.040
Cause I said 13 and right before you get all like dude,

7
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:24.960
you got to rub the fucking gallic and vinegar and you left ass cheek cause the

8
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:29.160
devil lives on the left side if you're going to have a good day.
All right,

9
00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:32.670
let's get down to it.
I talked a lot of shit.
I talked a lot of shit.

10
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.530
Oh the fuck you.
You sent it a fence.

11
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.950
You know what you actually you know why I've talked to all that shit because I

12
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:41.850
wasn't watching hockey
and all I saw,

13
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:45.200
I knew the Bruins would want a couple cause I follow him on my little smart

14
00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:50.070
phone there.
You know I follow the Bruins,
the Canadians in the kings,

15
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.640
the Bruins and the king's cause I like him and the Canadians cause I hate him.

16
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.180
Right.

17
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.910
And I just always want to know what those fucking blue blank a Douche I doing

18
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.110
right.
I actually,
I liked the team.
I just hate their fans.
You know,

19
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.460
they don't really know hockey.

20
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:05.940
They think they do and they put on loafers and they whine.
I mean,

21
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.540
no Canadian fan can ever say that.
They know hockey.

22
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:14.220
When you watched your fanbase Bu Patrick was out of town because he had a bad

23
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:18.210
regular season game and a,
that curse hangs over you,

24
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.320
which is why you won't win it again this year.
All right.
What happens?

25
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.660
Stop being a cocktail.
So when the reason why I talk shit,

26
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.750
it was cause I like everybody else saw that thing with the Bruins was selling

27
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:32.210
playoff tickets plow.
So I thought they made it.
So I just,
you know,

28
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.820
if was just being a Dosha and I started giving the fucking senators shit,

29
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.000
I didn't even know that's how bad a fan I was this year.
But uh,

30
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.040
but I stuck with them and I kept talking shit I hoped against hope yesterday.

31
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.720
Bruins tied it up,
you know,
to go into overtime and then they fucking lost.

32
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.340
But um,
I dunno,
it's a lot of roads fans.

33
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.910
Mad season was a fucking disgrace and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

34
00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:59.820
And other fans giving me shit.
Partly it's because I talked to all that shit,

35
00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:03.300
but like I don't really consider it a fucking disgrace,
you know what I mean?

36
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.980
We're great franchise.

37
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:08.220
Do you know we went to the plas 29 fucking years in a row and then like another

38
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:10.650
10 years in a row and then another 10 years,
something like that.

39
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:15.030
Something we've missed the playoffs like fucking three times in my life.

40
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.730
Big fucking deal.
Am I really gonna be sad as a Boston fan?

41
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.420
Do you realize in the last four years we won a Stanley Cup?

42
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.490
We won a world series and a super bowl.
All we need is the fucking Celtics.
Diplo,

43
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:32.970
pull their green and white acids out of the mud and the next couple of years,

44
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:35.610
and we're going to run the table again.
And this is what kills me.

45
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.620
We're doing this with four fucking teams.
How can we do this with four teams?

46
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.250
And then you look at the state in New York that has 10 fucking teams.

47
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.250
The state of California has like 15 fucking teams and collectively they never

48
00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:54.870
have in a 10 year period run the table and one all of them.
Go ahead,
hit pause,

49
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.020
look it up,
look it up.
So I am fine.
Um,

50
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.200
I'm not as negative about the Bruins is everybody.
I think we,
you know,

51
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:03.760
we got some good young players or whatever.

52
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:07.330
The guys that won the cup maybe got a little bit old,
you know,

53
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.730
what are you gonna do the fuck you gonna do.
All right,

54
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.990
so congratulations to all you people that have given me shit.
You know,

55
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.360
especially centered fan.
Well,

56
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:18.670
I guess they deserve give me shit because I talk so much stuff,

57
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:20.140
but I'm just sitting there thinking my head like,
dude,

58
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:22.540
you're a fucking eighth seat.
Do you really think you're going to win a cup?

59
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.140
You're not.
All right.
So we'll,

60
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:29.890
we'll save a seat for you down at the golf course for when you swing by in May.

61
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.160
What do you think about that?
Fucking with you?
I don't give a shit at this point.

62
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:37.420
My team's out.
If it's a cook,
good luck to everybody except for the Canadians.

63
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.200
Good luck to the ranger fans.
You know,

64
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.690
you guys want one cup and 75 fucking years.

65
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:45.550
I had been nice to see you get another one,

66
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.710
even though you are fans in New York teams.

67
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:50.320
And that's one of my favorite fucking arguments that you've doubled down in

68
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:51.820
every sport.
You know,

69
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:55.690
it's like you're playing blackjack and every fucking hand you get dealt dealt

70
00:03:55.691 --> 00:04:00.310
two aces and you still lose.
Ah,
Jesus Christ.

71
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:04.210
I'm fucking wiped out man.
I stayed out last night till like,
I dunno what I had.

72
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.930
I had some friends come by and we went to this,
uh,

73
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:11.500
this local bar and uh,
I didn't even drink that much.

74
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:16.330
It's just that I had a four 30 pickup for a 7:00 AM flight.

75
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.710
And um,
I dunno,
I stayed out til like three.

76
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.820
I think I slept for like a fucking hour and a half.
And,
uh,

77
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:27.910
I got on the plane and I was asleep and I vaguely remember them saying we had

78
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.990
mechanical problems,
had fucking taxi back to the gate.

79
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.420
I slept through all of that and everybody let the fog of book along just going

80
00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:36.761
to take,

81
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:41.200
I slept through all of it and I didn't wake up until we were over the fucking

82
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:46.180
desert,
which is perfect.
Um,
so it was actually,
it was a great flight,

83
00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:49.810
but,
uh,
I got some shit to do tomorrow.
So I am recording this Sunday afternoon.

84
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:53.920
I usually have a rule that I do not record podcasts.
Um,

85
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.880
you know,
on days that I fly,
cause I'm usually fucking,
I dunno,

86
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.090
it does something to me.
I'll tell you it does something to the funny,
you know.

87
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.450
Um,
so anyways,
I don't have a team to root for at this point.

88
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:05.860
So you've got gotta be asking yourself,
Bill,

89
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:10.020
who the fuck are you rooting for in the playoffs?
Play off.

90
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.250
Who am I rooting for?
Um,

91
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.460
I'm not gonna waste my time voting for the room for the center.

92
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.110
It'd be great to see them win because they,
they'd never won.

93
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:20.170
But I'm not going to waste my time with that because,
uh,
you know,

94
00:05:20.171 --> 00:05:24.880
there are fucking eighth seat.
All right.
There you go.
So that's done.

95
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.190
Okay.
I think it's going to come down to,
uh,
probably ranges and Canadians again.

96
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.290
Um,
although,
so I figured they're the favorites.
I'm going to actually,

97
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:37.180
I'm going to in the east,
I'm going to root for the capitals.

98
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.810
I liked the capitals.
I like Ovechkin cause he actually scores,

99
00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:44.500
he's a goal scorer,
but he's not,
he's not a pussy.
Like most goals scores,

100
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.250
you know,
they usually got some big guy fucking skate and right behind him,

101
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.360
you know,
stay away from 'em stay.
We'll give him his space.
You know,

102
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.320
he's got a mean streak to his game.
He actually plays a physical game.

103
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.870
He has gold laces,
which I think is a nice little piece of flair.

104
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.320
I do have to say that guy.
I think that's,

105
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.730
you know him or tapes of my,
two of my favorite guys to watch.

106
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:12.910
Like when I bought a Vegan,

107
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.660
I know there's something about the way that guy plays.

108
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.840
He's always in the exact same spot in the offensive zone.

109
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.530
It's just sitting there with this stick up in the air waiting for a fucking one

110
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:25.700
time.
Um,
so I'm going to root for those guys,

111
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:28.100
especially if they wear their old school uniforms that has this,

112
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:30.440
to have the stairs on the sleeves.
I've always liked those,

113
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:32.930
so I guess I'll root for those guys and I believe in it.

114
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:37.850
Not as much as I shit on,
uh,
New York,
which I just do because it's fun.

115
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.490
You know,
I actually liked the giants,
believe it or not,

116
00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:42.770
even though they kicked our ass twice in a Superbowl,
um,

117
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.810
well kicked our ass the first time.
The second time we fucking blow.
Um,

118
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.820
Brady,
the Welker dope.
Um,
I actually,

119
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.820
I am actually a range of fan,
even though it was a Bruins fan.

120
00:06:55.821 --> 00:06:58.460
I shouldn't be because they,
we had a brutal,
brutal,

121
00:06:58.461 --> 00:07:00.560
brutal fucking rivalry in the 70s.

122
00:07:00.561 --> 00:07:04.100
Brad Park was always wine and about Bobby Orr and well,

123
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:08.480
how we got all that attention.
He was fucking jealous.
You know what I mean?
Um,

124
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.020
he was like the chick that wasn't quite as hot and just sat there fucking

125
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:15.350
staring daggers at the prom queen all through the 70s.

126
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:19.940
Then what's funny is he ended up being a brewing and um,
but I was,
I was too.

127
00:07:19.941 --> 00:07:23.720
Um,
I was too young to remember that.
I just,
I dunno,
I always liked the ranges.

128
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:26.900
I always liked the original six teams,
um,

129
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.340
including the,
the actually,
you know,
got to respect the Canadians,

130
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:34.670
you know what I mean?
Even though,
you know,
fucking 12 of their cups,

131
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:37.880
they won probably playing outdoors on a frozen river.

132
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:48.080
We beat the Montreal maroons and 12 best 12 out of fucking 27 or whatever the

133
00:07:48.421 --> 00:07:52.550
fuck it was back then.
Um,
that math didn't work.
I now go fuck yourself.
Um,

134
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.610
best 12 out of a,
what would it be?
12 out of 23.

135
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.250
Right?
There you go.
Cause they had all fucking day back then.
Um,

136
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.380
so anyways,
I don't know why I like the Kings.
I like the Black Hawks.

137
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.790
I like the blues.
I think I might roof for the blues because the kings of one,

138
00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:15.210
one I still like to Kingsville.
Um,

139
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.100
I dunno.
I like a lot of teams in the west except for Vancouver.

140
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.900
Although Vancouver's not Vancouver anymore.
Most of those guys left.

141
00:08:24.901 --> 00:08:28.800
They still got the twins and they got burrows.
That guy,

142
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.650
thank God for that guy.
He's the reason why the Bruins,

143
00:08:31.651 --> 00:08:35.370
one fucking Vancouver was kicking our ass and all of a sudden he just started

144
00:08:35.371 --> 00:08:38.430
being a Douche and it was just like,
wait a minute.
That's what we do.

145
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.280
You're going to bite somebody in the finger.
Come on man.
That's,
that's,

146
00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:47.340
that's what the fuck you want to play dirty Jesus Christ.
That's our game.

147
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.120
So anyways,
um,
I have no idea.
So I think I'll actually,

148
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:56.280
I'll be watching the kings and then,
um,
I actually like,

149
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:59.940
uh,
the blues because they haven't won ever.

150
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.980
And um,
and that's what I'll do.
I'll probably just be written Fonda dogs,

151
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.040
but either way I am,
I'm always excited for the plants,

152
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:09.630
even though we didn't fucking make it.
What are you going to do?

153
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:11.130
What are you going to be a fucking baby about?

154
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:15.690
A congratulations to the senators and I look forward to sitting next to you

155
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:20.691
watching a game with you very soon as we sit there with both of our teams,

156
00:09:21.481 --> 00:09:25.470
not in the playoffs.
Ooh.
Um,
all right.

157
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.020
So I did,
uh,

158
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.190
I mentioned working in Tampa and then Florida.
I was down on Miami Beach,

159
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.320
which is fucking and say Miami beach.
Really?

160
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:39.321
It puts Hollywood to shame as far as a beautiful women,

161
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:45.060
uh,
train wrecks,
plastic surgery,
old guys with younger women.
I mean,

162
00:09:45.061 --> 00:09:49.260
it's just,
it's unbelievable.
Um,
and some of the most,

163
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.630
but I do have to say someone with beautiful women I've ever seen in my life.

164
00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:55.260
So I did a couple of shows that the Jackie Gleason theater and uh,

165
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.150
there's no fucking office that they kept.
It was just like Jackie Gleason's.

166
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.140
I forget who the fuck told me that.
They don't,

167
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:04.000
they have obviously they just have a green room like,
Yep,

168
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:08.130
this was his grain room downstairs.
He actually had a bed and all that.

169
00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:11.790
If he got a B,
worked too hard,
wink,
wink,
he would sleep here.

170
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.920
And uh,
you know,
so he'd be here for the next day to go to work or whatever.

171
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.410
But it was still,
you know,
it was awesome to perform there.

172
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:24.060
And afterwards we went to this,
uh,
this after party and um,

173
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.880
it was really cool.
I got to see a Chappelle cause uh,

174
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:31.800
he was performing at this theater of saint there dare I should say bunch of days

175
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:33.880
and I've got to tell you,
I was,

176
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.520
I like to talk to them when we were in this fucking really loud club,
you know,

177
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.060
playing that,
that uh,
that music that makes me feel old,

178
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.350
that computer generated music and there was all these fucking strobe lights and

179
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:50.160
uh,
I dunno,
it was just a bunch of shit going on.

180
00:10:50.161 --> 00:10:52.200
And they had us in like this roped off area.

181
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:54.300
And it was funny cause it was like nobody in the club.

182
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.450
So rather than looking like this cool VIP area,

183
00:10:57.451 --> 00:10:59.370
we look like we had some sort of plague

184
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:05.790
they would trying to entertain us with a horrible music,
maybe slowly kill us.

185
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.810
I don't know what,
but,
um,
anyways,
I want to thank everybody that,
uh,

186
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:13.110
that came out to the shows.
I had a,
I had an awesome time.

187
00:11:13.111 --> 00:11:17.940
So you know what's coming up next to everybody.
Oh,
the Billy Bible belt tour.

188
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.000
That's the next one.
The next one.

189
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.630
When the fuck did we start that?
I don't even know.
Good.
It says,

190
00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:27.000
somebody tell me how to get rid of this stupid updates.

191
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:32.990
UPDATES available on my computer and it says install or my option is later and

192
00:11:33.211 --> 00:11:37.020
it,
my,
all I can say is trying an hour try tonight.
Remind me tomorrow.

193
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.830
Turn on auto update.
So it's just every fucking day I got to click on this thing.

194
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:45.120
I never update.
Itunes is the only thing I update.

195
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:48.630
I never update anything else because it just fills up your fucking computer.

196
00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:51.450
It's like my computer works.
You know what I mean?
I don't know.

197
00:11:51.451 --> 00:11:54.620
I don't understand what the problem is here.
Um,

198
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.360
I dunno.
I don't,
I never update my phone.
I still love the iPhone four s,

199
00:11:59.361 --> 00:12:02.360
which at this point it's starting to fucking starting to wig out on me here a

200
00:12:02.361 --> 00:12:05.030
little bit.
I'm going to have to finally give into it,
but,
uh,

201
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.320
I haven't heard anybody bitching about the six in a while.
So I guess,

202
00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.720
I guess the,
uh,
the coast is clear and I can actually buy one.

203
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.900
I always do that always waits for people to buy the phone bitch about it,

204
00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:18.290
and then they fix it and then I buy the next one.
I draft behind you.

205
00:12:18.291 --> 00:12:20.180
That's what I do.
I'm like a coward in war.

206
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.890
I sit in the fucking foxhole in the fetal position crying as you guys go over

207
00:12:24.891 --> 00:12:28.730
the wall and take it in the face.
Right.
What is this thing doing?

208
00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:33.470
Why is it blinking?
Just made a noise,
right?
Am I still recording?

209
00:12:33.471 --> 00:12:36.660
I think I'm recording.
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,
the Billy Bible belt tour.

210
00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:41.630
All right.
It starts April 18th and Savannah,

211
00:12:41.631 --> 00:12:45.770
Georgia.
April 19th.
We're in Knoxville,
Tennessee.

212
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:50.810
Um,
the 20th,
Chattanooga,
Tennessee 21st we are in,

213
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.390
uh,
Memphis 22nd Sri fourth.

214
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:59.300
Thank you very much everybody for uh,
helping me sell these tickets.

215
00:12:59.301 --> 00:13:03.080
Why does this thing keep beeping?
Ah,
fuck.
I don't know.

216
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:04.790
I don't even know if I'm fucking recording at this point.

217
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.050
Maybe it was just doing it for me.
All right.
The 23rd.
We're in New Orleans.

218
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:10.820
All right.
We're in there for them.

219
00:13:10.821 --> 00:13:13.730
We're there for a couple of days and then we got Huntsville,
Alabama.

220
00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.970
Then we got all right.
I have to fucking address why this thing is fucking BP.

221
00:13:17.971 --> 00:13:21.980
What is the problem?
I have battery power.
Right?

222
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:27.390
Why do you keep making that
all right.

223
00:13:27.391 --> 00:13:30.870
The fucking thing was beeping because the memory was full ice.
I swear to God,

224
00:13:30.871 --> 00:13:35.730
man.
I have no,
I have no instinct when it comes to,

225
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.810
uh,
electronics,
technology,
any of this shit.
I just,

226
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:44.580
you know,
I,
I,
I'm a fucking idiot when it comes to this stuff.
I like,

227
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.470
I like old school shit.
You know,

228
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:53.370
anything pre like digital watch.
I didn't have a problem with it.
It was simple.

229
00:13:53.371 --> 00:13:55.200
You put batteries in the back of it,
you know,

230
00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:59.250
you fucking wound the hands of the clock.
You looked at the clock,
they were,

231
00:13:59.251 --> 00:14:04.010
it was,
you just plugged it in,
right?
Isn't that what you did?

232
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.280
Your wound it up.
Hey it go.
I miss those.
I miss those days.

233
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.740
Nice and fucking simple,
you know.

234
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.860
Oh Billy simple town that day.
You know,

235
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.480
I'd like to go back to that at some point.

236
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.800
Jesus fucking Christ with all of this God damn shit.
This fucking new record.

237
00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:24.000
It's just so many extra goddamn bells and whistles on it.

238
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:28.410
You know what's funny is they could have just came out with the exact same one

239
00:14:28.411 --> 00:14:30.540
and I want to use their other one until it was dead.

240
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.920
This is just for these fucking nerds were like,
oh dude,
if you're hard to no one,

241
00:14:34.921 --> 00:14:36.330
you know what the no one does

242
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:42.880
the same as the old one except a couple other things.
Oh,

243
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.930
I'm such a cunt when it comes to that stuff.
I apologize.

244
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.650
I apologize to lot at all about that shit.
Um,
anyways,

245
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:53.330
what the hell was I talking about?
Oh,
I think I was listing the,
uh,

246
00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:58.130
the dates on the,
uh,
the upcoming tour.
I believe we cut off the 23rd.

247
00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:02.360
I'm in New Orleans,
Huntsville,
Alabama,
the 26 Jackson,

248
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:06.650
Mississippi on the 27th mobile,
Alabama on the 28th Lexington,

249
00:15:06.651 --> 00:15:09.650
Kentucky on the 30th and Evansville,
Indiana on the first.

250
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:10.940
And then when we go to the Kentucky Derby,

251
00:15:10.941 --> 00:15:13.970
and what's great about this tour is I haven't been to any of these fucking

252
00:15:13.971 --> 00:15:16.070
places and um,

253
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.280
so I'm going to be performing in front of a bunch of people that never seen me

254
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:24.170
before.
Some never even heard of me.
So,
uh,
you know,
it's weird.

255
00:15:24.171 --> 00:15:26.540
This is kind of like when I went through Southeast Asia,

256
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.070
except they're doing it in my own country.
So,
uh,
uh,
it's gonna be a good time,

257
00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:35.000
but I'll tell you right now,
or bill,
he's been in the fucking gym.
All right?

258
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.360
I've been doing the tens when I'm on the road.
That workout,
Bart,

259
00:15:38.361 --> 00:15:42.680
nick showed me is what you do,
10 jumping jacks,
10 burpees,

260
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.510
10 sit ups,
10 push ups,

261
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:49.540
10 like alternate leg lunges and then 10 jump squats and then you do nine run

262
00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:52.100
through it again.
Then you do eight run through it again.

263
00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:53.240
You all the way down to one,

264
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.140
and then I skip rope for two or three rounds and by the end of that,

265
00:15:57.141 --> 00:16:00.500
I'm fucking dead.
And I'll tell you right now,
you'd do that.
I swear to God,

266
00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:03.770
you could drink a 12 pack and eat a fucking court upon it with cheese and wake

267
00:16:03.771 --> 00:16:08.600
up with a flat stomach.
All right?
They get go.
That's what you need to do.

268
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.450
You know,
I have a buddy of mine,
oh,
I got a friend of mine,
you know,

269
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.990
he's a one of these fucking guys.
You know,
he's always trying to lose weight,

270
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:20.030
right?
But he does like those fad diet things.
You know,

271
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.040
dude,
I've cut out all sugar,
you know,
or I don't eat carbs,

272
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.400
not eating bread,
not eat bread,
dude,

273
00:16:28.401 --> 00:16:32.330
I cut out bread all together.
It's just like,
how long is that going to last?

274
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:36.800
How can you realistically,
realistically not have a fucking sandwich?

275
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:42.020
That's,
you know what I mean?
It's like people who try to quit eating bread,

276
00:16:42.021 --> 00:16:45.590
that's like me trying to quit alcohol.
It's just,
it's not going to happen.
Like,

277
00:16:45.591 --> 00:16:50.591
how long can I realistically go and just remained sober and just go through

278
00:16:53.271 --> 00:16:57.650
life?
You know,
at some point you,
you really,
you got to,
you have to drink.

279
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.500
And I'm,
I'm saying this to alcoholics too.
All right.

280
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.900
I think you guys are way off base with your sobriety.
Okay?

281
00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:09.380
You're missing the point in life.
The point in life is every,
you know,

282
00:17:09.381 --> 00:17:12.020
you don't do it every day.
You just,
every like,
you know,

283
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.570
like three days you get so drunk and belligerent,
you,

284
00:17:16.571 --> 00:17:20.290
you heard everyone around you that you love and a,

285
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.450
you maybe create a legal problem for yourself.
And you know,
I know this,

286
00:17:24.451 --> 00:17:26.330
this is obvious to most of my listeners,

287
00:17:26.331 --> 00:17:30.830
but I just don't understand why people go to AA meetings.
Um,
no,
I'm joking.

288
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:31.693
I just fucking,

289
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.890
all you gotta do is you just start your day with your fucking oatmeal.

290
00:17:36.891 --> 00:17:40.010
These fucking idiots man sitting there.
Dude,
I'm done with pickles.

291
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.760
I'm not done with anything.
Like,
I try not to eat Mcdonald's,

292
00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:46.460
but I know at some point,
oh,
I know I'm going to go in there and you know what?

293
00:17:46.461 --> 00:17:49.130
I'm going to go in there.
My Heart's going to be fucking racing with excitement,

294
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.780
knowing that I'm doing something bad and I'm going to eat it.

295
00:17:51.781 --> 00:17:56.430
And second after I eat it,
I'm going to feel like shit.
I know I,
I know him,

296
00:17:56.431 --> 00:18:01.140
but I'm not.
I'm,
despite that,
it's fucking delicious when it's going down.

297
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.230
Right.
And I know I'm going to fucking hate,

298
00:18:05.231 --> 00:18:09.060
but I'd probably just every once in a while,
hey,
did you see somebody did the,
uh,

299
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:12.220
it was great.
Somebody did the final four,
like the bracket thing,

300
00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.460
the march madness brackets with a fast food.

301
00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:21.190
And I can't tell you how disappointment pointed I was that Mcdonald's got

302
00:18:21.191 --> 00:18:25.420
knocked out in the first round.
I just thought it was completely disrespectful.

303
00:18:25.421 --> 00:18:28.960
You know,
this is,
this is the,
they're like the rose bowl of fast food.

304
00:18:28.961 --> 00:18:33.210
These are the ones who stay started at all.
Right.
Notch.

305
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.760
And let me look this up and I guarantee you're going to,

306
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:41.160
you're going to take it fucking personally.
March madness,
fast foods,

307
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:45.240
images.
Come on,
Bill.
We,
you're able to find it.

308
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.720
Were you able to make computers work for you for once in your life that Jesus is

309
00:18:51.661 --> 00:18:56.140
just a bunch of fucking advertise?
Oh,
well there is.
There it is.

310
00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.460
I found it.
Holy Shit.
I can't believe it.
All right,
visit the page.

311
00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.420
Visit the page.
I clicked the button.
Nothing happens.

312
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.170
The vein in my forehead starts to pulse,
but Mcdonald's got,

313
00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.520
Donald's gets knocked out in the first round.
Give me a fucking break.
Mcdonald's.

314
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:17.410
They're like the Duke of fast,
a fast food.
You know,
they just did.

315
00:19:17.411 --> 00:19:21.760
Just going to be in it at least to the great eight.
When you say,

316
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:23.920
what's your favorite fast food.

317
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.020
<v 3>Okay,</v>

318
00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.980
<v 0>in and out gets fucking knocked out.
That had to have been an upset.</v>

319
00:19:29.981 --> 00:19:34.390
Right now this is birthday cake.
First Pie.
You know what?
Fuck you internet.

320
00:19:34.391 --> 00:19:35.250
I'm still fucking,

321
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.920
why can't you just find the shit that I need and go fuck yourself.
All right,

322
00:19:38.921 --> 00:19:42.430
it's over.
Whatever.
Yet again.
Yet again.
You know what I need to learn how to do.

323
00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:47.550
I need to learn to not just fucking wing this podcast and just search for the

324
00:19:47.651 --> 00:19:49.420
shit that I want first.

325
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:54.220
Have it and then riff about it instead of getting you guys excited that I'm

326
00:19:54.221 --> 00:19:57.970
actually going to complete a fucking thought on here.
All right.

327
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.360
Tapping out of that.
Not even gracefully.
That was just a train wreck.

328
00:20:01.361 --> 00:20:04.300
I just fell out of the side of a fucking moving car.
That's what just happened.

329
00:20:04.301 --> 00:20:05.350
Okay.
We went around a corner,

330
00:20:05.351 --> 00:20:08.830
I didn't have my seat belt on the door opened up and then that was it.
Oh,

331
00:20:08.831 --> 00:20:12.680
freckles.
Right off the side.
Road rash all over the side of his big forehead.
Um,

332
00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.540
so anyways,
I actually watched a documentary that's,

333
00:20:16.541 --> 00:20:21.490
I think it was on HBO and my lovely wife recorded it on a Frank Sinatra,

334
00:20:21.491 --> 00:20:25.180
this two part series.
And I gotta tell you,
man,
it changed my life.

335
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.133
A

336
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:27.990
<v 3>okay.</v>

337
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:32.730
<v 0>One part of it,
and it's the part where he makes his second comeback.
Like,</v>

338
00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:36.390
I guess he was like the first sort of,
uh,
you know,

339
00:20:36.391 --> 00:20:40.230
he was like the Justin Bieber of back then when he,
when he first did like the,

340
00:20:40.231 --> 00:20:41.720
uh,
when you first started singing,

341
00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.310
he was a crooner when all the chicks loved them and that type of stuff.

342
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.400
And it's funny,
all the big bands will like the fucking bands back then.

343
00:20:49.401 --> 00:20:51.740
Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller and all of them.
And they're looking at like,

344
00:20:51.741 --> 00:20:56.120
who the fuck is this kid?
You know,
all these girls screaming,
you know,

345
00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:57.590
and uh,

346
00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:02.390
and also just speaks to the quality of talent back then and musicianship that

347
00:21:02.391 --> 00:21:06.710
like a guy of Frank Sinatra's talent was considered like a,

348
00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:10.430
like a fucking boy band.
Um,

349
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.600
and granted you had all that stuff going on back then,
right.
Miles Davis,

350
00:21:14.601 --> 00:21:16.100
Charlie Parker and all that type of shit,

351
00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.190
but they had all this amazing footage and he was in the,

352
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.780
I think the Tommy Dorsey band.

353
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:22.130
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

354
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:23.590
<v 0>And like the,
all they're doing,</v>

355
00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:27.650
they're talking about frank and I'm looking at the band and they get buddy rich

356
00:21:27.651 --> 00:21:30.110
on drums.
They don't even bring it up.

357
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.070
It's just the level of talent.
It was just,
it was fucking unreal.

358
00:21:34.071 --> 00:21:36.230
Like he really had to know how to play back then.
So what anyways,

359
00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.130
he had basically after he dropped off,
you know,

360
00:21:40.131 --> 00:21:43.430
after his crooning thing was over,
people thought he was finished.

361
00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.340
And I think that like the whole rockstar thing,

362
00:21:46.341 --> 00:21:50.270
but it was basically was basically a rock star before rock was.
Um,

363
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:56.380
you know,
there was no history of,
of anybody ever doing that.
So when he fell off,

364
00:21:56.381 --> 00:21:57.400
everybody thought he was finished.

365
00:21:57.401 --> 00:22:02.260
So when he made his comeback as the singer of sad songs and lament,

366
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.550
whatever the fuck they said,

367
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.400
it was considered the greatest comeback in show showbiz history.

368
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:11.470
So that wasn't the part that scared me.
What scared me was the second time,

369
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:12.993
you know,

370
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.890
when he was into his 50s now think the first time he fell off it was just like,

371
00:22:17.891 --> 00:22:18.131
I don't know,

372
00:22:18.131 --> 00:22:20.950
he's only like his 20s and he was considered older and washed up or something or

373
00:22:20.951 --> 00:22:23.350
maybe like into his thirties.
It's a 20 years after that.

374
00:22:23.351 --> 00:22:25.810
He has his second one and this is the one that scared me.

375
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:30.550
And they said frank was making all these choices desperately trying to remain

376
00:22:30.551 --> 00:22:32.260
relevant.
And they had,

377
00:22:32.261 --> 00:22:36.310
at one point he was singing with some like Motown group and they had these

378
00:22:36.311 --> 00:22:38.260
really like crazy like,

379
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.790
like pimp suits meets like a three musketeers kind of outfit,
right?

380
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.430
Late sixties crazy shit.

381
00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:50.880
And frank puts on one of these outfits to sing with this popular group and he's

382
00:22:51.281 --> 00:22:55.240
got that big band swing pulse and they come in more with like a Motown thing.

383
00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:00.960
And I was literally on the edge of the couch watching it with like my fucking

384
00:23:02.141 --> 00:23:05.800
head,
my hands going like,
oh my God,
this happened to Frank Sinatra.

385
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.160
Like,
what the fuck is going to happen to me?

386
00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:14.470
And I immediately since then have been planning some sort of,

387
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.410
I got to have an exit strategy out of this business.

388
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.580
I've joked about it before on stage saying all this business at some point is

389
00:23:21.581 --> 00:23:24.850
finished with you whether you like it or not,
but you never think about it.

390
00:23:24.851 --> 00:23:28.030
All you thinking about as your next project.
Um,

391
00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.590
this business is like a fantasy.
It's not like the real world where you're like,

392
00:23:33.591 --> 00:23:35.720
I'm going to do this until then and then when I'm this age,

393
00:23:35.721 --> 00:23:39.770
I'm 65 I think I'm going to retire and Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

394
00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:40.851
Like this business.

395
00:23:40.851 --> 00:23:45.851
People just fucking hang around and hang around and hang around and hang around

396
00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.390
to the point they fucking hire you.

397
00:23:49.391 --> 00:23:51.760
When people like when they go on the big bring up your name,
they go,

398
00:23:51.761 --> 00:23:56.030
I thought he was,
is he still alive?
Hey,
Sharon is built.

399
00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.350
Try and find out of bill burrs still alive.

400
00:23:59.351 --> 00:24:02.650
Like that'll fucking happen to me someday if I stick around too long,
so

401
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.960
all I could,
you know what I felt like when I was watching that?

402
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:11.760
I felt like Pauline,
that scene in Goodfellas,
all right,

403
00:24:11.761 --> 00:24:12.930
when he's talking to Henry,

404
00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:18.120
tell him to stay away from the drugs and he talks about some other dawn.
He goes,

405
00:24:18.121 --> 00:24:21.300
you hear about so and so,
he's gonna die in jail.
All right?

406
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.140
Then he fucking happening to me and I was literally watching frank wearing that

407
00:24:25.141 --> 00:24:29.210
suit and that's all I could do.
Think I can't say that's not going to happen.

408
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.870
I just hope that does not happen to me.
Um,

409
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.070
I just started having these fucking panic attacks and me coming out on stage on

410
00:24:37.071 --> 00:24:38.660
a cruise ship with like a Walker

411
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.140
and people just go in to see me at that point,
just to see me like,
yeah,
you know,

412
00:24:45.141 --> 00:24:48.920
he's,
come on,
he's been telling jokes for 40 years.

413
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.760
We've got to go see this guy and come out with their old age spots on the top of

414
00:24:52.761 --> 00:24:56.680
my head,
fucking head.
The desperately trying to cover up with fucking,

415
00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:02.530
I don't know what kind of makeup you've got a goddamn sander electric sander

416
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:07.830
kick in the top of my fucking head before I go out there.
MMM.

417
00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:12.090
Yeah.
Fuck that.
I got to I,
and I think I know what I'm going to do.

418
00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:13.770
This is what I'm going to do.

419
00:25:13.771 --> 00:25:16.650
I've got to start investing money outside of this business.
So I have ink.

420
00:25:16.651 --> 00:25:19.410
I need mailbox money coming in outside of this business.

421
00:25:19.411 --> 00:25:24.090
So whenever they're done with me,
I can just transition.
You know what?

422
00:25:24.091 --> 00:25:26.010
I think I'm gonna.
I think I'm going to become a slum

423
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:26.873
<v 1>Lord.</v>

424
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.720
<v 0>I'm going to live this dual life where I'm going to be this smiling entertainer</v>

425
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:41.110
on stage and I'll do benefits for diseases and underprivileged people in all

426
00:25:41.121 --> 00:25:44.810
that.
And then one day I will get exposed for the monster.
I truly am.

427
00:25:44.811 --> 00:25:48.680
And I'll have all these fucking,
like,

428
00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.920
there'll be like stories about how inexplicably,

429
00:25:51.921 --> 00:25:53.900
like tuberculosis is coming back.

430
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:58.370
And eventually they'll trace it back to this,

431
00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:03.210
like these four awful towers of apartments that are owned by this,
uh,

432
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:06.440
this corporation.
And they're like,
well,
who is behind,
uh,

433
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:10.980
go fuck yourself ink or whatever Billy red face,
who is Billy red face?

434
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:15.450
Then I'll fucking,
they'll bust me.
That'll,

435
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:18.020
that'll be the end of it.
And I'll,
you know,
I'll,
I'll blame,
I blame the,
uh,

436
00:26:18.021 --> 00:26:22.560
the astral family
out of New York and I'll just be like,
well,
I got,

437
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.900
I got my business model through them.
I mean,

438
00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:28.020
they did the same thing and for some reason no one trashed them.

439
00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:32.910
And they actually got an entire subway stop and piece of New York,

440
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.850
like named after him,
you know,
Astor place.

441
00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.710
Why can't we have a Billy's place?
I'll do it in Detroit.
I'll go,

442
00:26:40.711 --> 00:26:43.540
I'll go there and I'll buy up a whole block,
you know,

443
00:26:43.541 --> 00:26:48.230
and then rather than redoing it,
I'll rent it out to crackheads.
Just,
you know,

444
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:51.130
I'm just,
I'm just throwing shit against the wall here.
Just,
just,

445
00:26:51.131 --> 00:26:54.010
just go easy here with this,
uh,
this,
this business model.

446
00:26:54.011 --> 00:26:58.200
I'll rent it out to some crack heads.
Right.
And um,

447
00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.220
Eh,
it's a stupid idea.
They don't have money.
All right.

448
00:27:03.221 --> 00:27:08.120
So I'd have to get them out of there.
Yeah,
you get crack it out of your house.

449
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.430
You get,
you got to go.
Uh,
you get,

450
00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:13.750
you got a bright flashlight and a garden hose.

451
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.180
If that's what you do and you just,
you just,

452
00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:21.980
and you don't have it on full blast.
You just have it on like that.
You know,

453
00:27:21.981 --> 00:27:24.830
when you're,
when you're,
when you're watering a dainty flower in your garden,

454
00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:28.460
you'd ever do that sitting out there,
you know,

455
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.480
subconsciously scratching your ass.
That's basically how you do it.

456
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.720
Except you hold one with like a flashlight and then you just sort of your water,

457
00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:39.530
you know,
water is good for you.
That's like their Kryptonite and they,

458
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:41.900
they get out of there.
You didn't treat him like house cats.

459
00:27:41.901 --> 00:27:46.340
They get up on the couch.
You don't,
you just keep doing that.
So the,

460
00:27:46.341 --> 00:27:49.130
the hardest part is getting the water turned back on while they're still in

461
00:27:49.131 --> 00:27:51.970
there.
You know,
I don't what the fuck I'm talking about.
But anyways,

462
00:27:51.971 --> 00:27:55.010
so I watched that thing and anybody see it,
it scared the shit out of me.

463
00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.120
This whole fucking thing of getting old and not being fucking relevant and all

464
00:27:59.121 --> 00:28:02.510
of that type of stuff.
And uh,
I dunno,

465
00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:06.200
desperately trying to figure out where the fuck do you go,
where do you turn to?

466
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:08.053
You know what I mean?

467
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:11.510
This is why like not having kids is fucking scary cause then you know that you

468
00:28:11.511 --> 00:28:13.970
can lean back on your kid's like,
well they'll take care of me,
you know,

469
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.070
at least they'll stick me in a fucking home or something.

470
00:28:16.071 --> 00:28:19.580
I can eat apple sauce as I yell at the wall.

471
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.580
Am I sitting in my own fucking feces,
right?

472
00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:27.580
I mean wait till it rains my old ass out the window and I wash it all out.

473
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.880
Jesus bill.
Wow.
You know,
whatever,
go fuck yourself.
It scared me.

474
00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:34.480
I got a little scared.
So I'm thinking a,
B and a A.

475
00:28:34.481 --> 00:28:36.880
I think I'm probably going to become a slum lord on the side.

476
00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:41.990
So I'll let you know if,
uh,
I could find an apartment building that cost to buy.

477
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.360
I don't know about seven,
eight grand.
I can go down to home depot,

478
00:28:46.361 --> 00:28:51.230
puts some fucking a PCP fucking pipe in a PCV pipe in whenever the fuck it's got

479
00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.620
what called and that's what I'll do.

480
00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

481
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:59.570
<v 0>That'll be a monster on the side while I smile and wave at benefits.</v>

482
00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:02.750
That is my exit strategy.
So this is my question for you guys.

483
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.460
You guys in the real world.
All right,
cause I'm,

484
00:29:05.461 --> 00:29:09.440
I'm not even joking about how frightening that was to watch.
What,
what is,
uh,

485
00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:13.850
what is your exit strategy if you have a career right now?
All right.

486
00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:15.200
And if you do have children,

487
00:29:15.201 --> 00:29:20.201
do you think that you have raised your children in a way that they are both

488
00:29:20.361 --> 00:29:24.050
smart enough to have a career where the,

489
00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:28.220
where they can't take care of you?
And secondly,

490
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:32.900
where were you nice enough to them that they don't hate your fucking guts,

491
00:29:32.901 --> 00:29:37.170
that they don't give a shit,
you know,
you know,

492
00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:40.030
they don't care if you're writing a fucking old folks on where you nice enough

493
00:29:40.031 --> 00:29:44.770
to them that they don't you or will you not selfish enough that they picked up

494
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:46.210
on your selfish habits and they're like,
yeah,

495
00:29:46.211 --> 00:29:49.510
I don't give a fuck about my dad or my mom.
You know?
That's what I'm asking you.

496
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:53.500
I'm asking the tough questions here on the motherboard of book has.
All right,

497
00:29:53.501 --> 00:29:58.160
let's read some of the fucking advertising here for this week.
Um,
all right,

498
00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:01.400
well I was actually supposed to read something else first for the Thursday

499
00:30:01.401 --> 00:30:05.810
afternoon,
Monday morning podcast just before Friday.
Um,

you know,

501
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:10.130
that's just basically me fucking around for a half hours as opposed to the

502
00:30:10.131 --> 00:30:11.540
series shit that happens on Monday.

503
00:30:11.541 --> 00:30:15.560
Then we play some greatest hits from podcasts gone by.
I was wondering,
you know,

504
00:30:15.561 --> 00:30:18.140
if you guys,
if there's any subjects you guys want me to talk about,

505
00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.430
if there's an article that pissed you off,
maybe once a week I will do a,
uh,

506
00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.470
a rant for you.
All right.
If you,

507
00:30:24.471 --> 00:30:26.480
if there's something you want me to fucking go off on,

508
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:31.190
I'll try to work up some sort of passion for it.
Uh,
you can actually,
um,

509
00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.230
send it to the,

513
00:30:46.131 --> 00:30:50.000
I'm too stupid to figure out how to,
where the hell they are at that point.
Okay.

Mlb is involved in this and they won't let fucking Pete rose in the hall of
fame.

574
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:23.990
I got to give it up to these guys.

575
00:34:23.991 --> 00:34:28.310
They found a way to make the dog days of baseball.
You know,

576
00:34:28.311 --> 00:34:30.950
they always say the dog days of summer.
It's the dog days of baseball after,

577
00:34:30.951 --> 00:34:34.850
after fucking April.
You know what I mean?
You're already Jones and for football.

578
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.850
What a great way to watch baseball.
You know,

579
00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:42.350
throwing your mortgage on the line when the cubs are playing the candles.
Um,

580
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.060
no,
actually I don't know.

581
00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:46.790
Every time I read that I start thinking that be kind of fun to put together a

582
00:34:46.791 --> 00:34:49.970
team.
Stay under the salary cap.
Oh God.

583
00:34:49.971 --> 00:34:53.210
Am I gonna be one those guys that fucking police fantasy football.
All right,

584
00:34:53.211 --> 00:34:55.130
let's read one.
Well,
I mean,

588
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.110
You've heard me talking about dollar shave club.com.

589
00:35:09.111 --> 00:35:12.440
The company that delivers amazing razors for a few bucks.

590
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.990
I know a razor that costs a few bucks.

591
00:35:14.991 --> 00:35:17.630
Delivering a great shame seems too good to be true,
right?

592
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:21.950
But you really have to try the razors,
the dollar shave club.com raisers.

595
00:35:29.181 --> 00:35:34.040
a couple of bucks.
Um,

596
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:36.380
I love,

597

You have to be an idiot and I can't even read this sentence.

598
00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:44.010
I am a massive celebrity and I'm constantly getting my picture taken by a

599
00:35:44.081 --> 00:35:48.730
Weirdos in bars or I'm on some TV show in a hut in high definition.

600
00:35:48.731 --> 00:35:52.030
I can't be seen with nicks and cuts all over my beautiful face.

601

I have to shave what they high quality razor.

they've got Dr Carver's easy shave.

606
00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:13.950
It's phenomenal.
If you're still using old fashioned shave foam,

607
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.930
you're a loser and I feel bad for you.

613
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.780
<v 2>Okay.</v>

614
00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.390
<v 0>That's go fuck yourself.

Or go fuck yourself.
Dot.</v>

615
00:36:35.391 --> 00:36:39.290
Or go fuck yourself.org.
Um,
all right,

616
00:36:39.291 --> 00:36:42.710
let's read some content here for this week.
Um,
what do we got here?

617
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.970
All right,
the Thursday afternoon,
Monday morning podcast.
Okay.
Bill,

618
00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:51.080
in case the rest of the morons who listen to your podcast having extended a

619
00:36:51.081 --> 00:36:54.950
thank you yet.
Let me do so on behalf of them for the Thursday afternoon,

620
00:36:54.951 --> 00:36:58.470
Monday morning podcast that comes in just before Friday there.
Uh,

621
00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.290
I love the music between the old clips.

622
00:37:00.291 --> 00:37:04.490
Especially last weeks my wife and I were listening on the way to work and she

623
00:37:04.491 --> 00:37:06.740
pointed out that you sound different on Thursdays.

624
00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.310
Monday you come out of the gate and by Thursday you seem more at peace.

625
00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:14.030
It's probably too early to claim a pattern,
but we'll see.
Anyways,

626
00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.610
thank you again.
Ah,
Jesus Christ.

627
00:37:16.611 --> 00:37:20.090
Can women ever just fucking not be trying to figure what figure you out the

628
00:37:20.091 --> 00:37:21.050
fucking weird.

629
00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:23.853
<v 2>Okay,</v>

630
00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.270
<v 0>sorry.
I needed a drink there.
You know,
he seems more,</v>

631
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:31.590
I liked the Thursday bill,
like just like,

632
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:32.491
and you know what?

633
00:37:32.491 --> 00:37:36.150
And they always act like what they're trying to do is to make your life better

634
00:37:36.151 --> 00:37:37.620
and all she's doing,
she's like,

635
00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:42.600
they're constantly gaining like a reconnaissance,

636
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:46.990
like information.
You know what I mean?
Cause generally speaking,
let's shoot,

637
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.320
you're dating one of those UFC chicks,
you know what I mean?

638
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:51.900
They can't beat the shit out of you.
So they got to go cerebral.

639
00:37:51.901 --> 00:37:55.650
So they are constantly on some sort of surveillance mission,

640
00:37:55.651 --> 00:37:57.930
even on a guy that isn't in their fucking lives.

641
00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:03.490
Just weirded me out that she's listening to it at that level.
And you know,

642
00:38:03.491 --> 00:38:05.070
it's funny,
she just does it naturally.

643
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:09.930
Who the fuck else would be thinking that he seems more um,

644
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:15.720
melancholy on Wednesdays,
but on Saturdays there's a light.

645
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:20.250
There's a light at the end of the tunnel.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

646
00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.850
Maybe because Monday's I'm flying back from somewhere and I'm hung over.

647
00:38:23.851 --> 00:38:27.330
How about that?
Maybe that's what it is,
but I'll tell you right now,

648
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:30.000
I'm never more at peace.
Um,

649
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:32.850
I'm actually happy so we would ever think that they heard that in my voice.

650
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:37.280
All right,
I'm going to read this one.
I'm going to read it in my,

651
00:38:37.281 --> 00:38:39.980
I guess my Thursday.
Let me try to get myself more at peace here.

652
00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:46.620
Need advice.
Hey Billy Bitch tits.

653
00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:48.623
I need your help.

654
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:53.490
My girlfriend of three years has been acting really strangely.

655
00:38:53.491 --> 00:38:58.100
Later things were fine up until two months ago.
We were banging in,

656
00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:02.850
hanging all the time without,
I can't do this.
We were banging in hanging.
Well,

657
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:06.530
Jesus,
you high fiving while you were fucking too all the time.

658
00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:10.790
<v 1>I'm going to come up top</v>

659
00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:17.490
<v 0>up top Brophy.
Jesus.
That should I just fucking switch a roo there?
Huh?
Um,</v>

660
00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:22.990
we were banging and hanging all the time without any problems at all except for

661
00:39:22.991 --> 00:39:25.540
the odd fight over which restaurant to go to.

662
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:28.090
Life was pretty sweet anyways,

663
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.840
lately she's never been available between 7:00 PM and 10:00 PM.

664
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.370
And when I do reach her after 10:00 PM,
she's really grumpy,

665
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:39.130
doesn't want to talk to me,
she tells me it's not me and not to worry,

666
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.150
it'll be better soon.

667
00:39:40.151 --> 00:39:44.440
But she's been like this for the last two months and there's no end in sight.

668
00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:48.940
She's also keeps canceling our plans at the last minute saying she's not feeling

669
00:39:48.941 --> 00:39:51.460
up to going out.
She's never act like this before.

670
00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:56.020
And we've known each other for seven years.
Oh Jesus.

671
00:39:56.021 --> 00:40:00.330
The seven year itch there.
Um,
anyways,

672
00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.870
yesterday was the breaking point.

673
00:40:01.871 --> 00:40:06.490
I called around 9:30 PM and she told me to go fuck myself and hung up on me.

674
00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:11.710
I called it back 45 minutes later and I'll be honest,
I was crying a little.
Ah,

675
00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.040
God,
she's in your heart now.
Do it while seven years.
He's going to be a,

676
00:40:15.041 --> 00:40:18.820
what was different was that this time she was crying too when she said she was

677
00:40:18.821 --> 00:40:22.510
really sorry and that the last two months,
oh fuck you.

678
00:40:22.511 --> 00:40:26.140
I'm not even going to read that.
Come on man.
Hey Andrew.

679
00:40:26.141 --> 00:40:30.950
Quit sending me the fucking troll once.
All right.
Election.
Uh,

680
00:40:30.951 --> 00:40:33.070
I'm on,
I got to read it because it was funny,
but I mean,

681
00:40:33.071 --> 00:40:36.700
I don't want to turn all of these questions into everything and wow.
Wow.
Wow.

682
00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.240
It was just a joke.
Cause then I don't have anything to fucking tie.
There was,

683
00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:44.200
she had been watching the Bruins and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Basically,

684
00:40:44.201 --> 00:40:48.280
if that was a real one,
she would have been crying the entire season.
Uh,
yeah.

685
00:40:48.281 --> 00:40:51.850
Don't send me these things because this is what helps me talk for a fucking half

686
00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:55.760
hour.
If,
if every one of these is going to be like,
oh,
I fucking trolls you IEPs.

687
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:59.350
That bap,
bap,
bap,
bap,
you know.

688
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:03.130
Anyways,
election dear Capitol Hill.
Bill,

689
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:08.950
can we get your thoughts on the 2016 election?
Hillary,
Ron,
Ron,

690
00:41:08.951 --> 00:41:12.850
Paul or rand Paul.
Ted Cruz,
uh,

691
00:41:12.851 --> 00:41:16.120
thoughts on any of them or what direction you think this country is going in?

692
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:17.890
Um,

693
00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:24.370
I think Hillary's got a great shot because she's a woman and there'll be a big

694
00:41:24.371 --> 00:41:28.720
pressure to not say she stinks because you'll get branded as a sexist.

695
00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:34.180
Um,
I'm sick of the Clinton family,
the Busch family.
I,

696
00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:37.730
I just,
I need a fresh face to be lying to me.

697
00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:43.180
That's the one thing I've loved about Obama over the last eight years at least.

698
00:41:43.221 --> 00:41:45.440
It was a different face,
you know,

699
00:41:45.441 --> 00:41:49.550
just shoveling a bunch of shit at me as opposed to just fucking,
I mean,

700
00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:54.320
can we just get out of the fucking Bush,
Clinton,
Bush,
Clinton.

701
00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:57.170
I don't want to do that.
You know,
I really don't.

702
00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.470
And also when a woman becomes president,
it's going to,

703
00:42:00.471 --> 00:42:05.120
it's going to crush me to watch how excited women are going to be as if it's

704
00:42:05.121 --> 00:42:07.040
going to make a bit of fucking difference.

705
00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.400
And I don't mean that in some hateful way towards women.

706
00:42:10.401 --> 00:42:15.401
I just can't stand people who fucking honestly look at the presidential office

707
00:42:15.411 --> 00:42:19.760
as if that person can,
can do anything.
You know,
this is going to get,

708
00:42:19.761 --> 00:42:23.300
this is going to get fucking dark here.
I think it's all bullshit.

709
00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:27.540
When you look at what fucking
politicians make,

710
00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:33.330
it's pathetic.
It's pathetic.
What?
They make 400 grand to be president.

711
00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.840
He get 200 something grand to be a God damn senator.
All right?

712
00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:40.620
And all of those offices costs millions and millions and millions and millions

713
00:42:40.621 --> 00:42:42.060
of fucking dollars to get.

714
00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:45.060
So you have to go to all these other fucking guys and then you all,

715
00:42:45.061 --> 00:42:45.970
all of them favor.

716
00:42:45.971 --> 00:42:48.900
So you're bought and paid for before you even get into the fucking office.

717
00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:54.090
And then what happens is afterwards,
somehow like,
I like some ridiculous,

718
00:42:54.091 --> 00:42:58.680
like 65 to 70% of of senators are multimillionaires.

719
00:42:58.980 --> 00:42:59.311
It's like,

720
00:42:59.311 --> 00:43:03.510
how the fuck did you do that if you just made a couple of hundred grand a year

721
00:43:03.511 --> 00:43:07.260
because you're going to get whacked and half and taxes.
You know what I mean?

722
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:11.040
I just think the whole fucking thing is corrupt.
And um,

723
00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.320
look at Obama.
The first African American president,

724
00:43:14.321 --> 00:43:15.730
you would think that they would be there.

725
00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.550
That should have been the most liberal fucking guy ever.
And he wasn't.

726
00:43:18.551 --> 00:43:22.450
It was just,
to me,
it was just more of the same,
more of the fucking same,

727
00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.270
more of the lead.

728
00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:28.960
People are going to get us more of that shit and just getting everybody to hate

729
00:43:28.961 --> 00:43:30.580
everybody all around the fucking world.

730
00:43:30.581 --> 00:43:35.350
It's just been all of that same exact shit.
And I don't think,

731
00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:40.230
you know any of those guys.
I don't know if
who's the,

732
00:43:40.231 --> 00:43:44.280
who's the woman that I do like is the one who's fucking actually calling out the

733
00:43:44.281 --> 00:43:46.890
banks and say we need to break up the monopoly.

734
00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.620
That's the one that I like out of everybody that I've heard talked,

735
00:43:49.621 --> 00:43:53.100
she's the one that I am actually like,
wow,
she's actually saying something,

736
00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:58.590
you know.
Um,
but I mean if she actually tried to do that,

737
00:43:58.591 --> 00:44:02.340
she would get whacked and I totally believe that she would,
she get,

738
00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.890
I don't know that they even have to fucking whack it now.
They can just,

739
00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:08.220
they'll just destroy you if I don't know that,

740
00:44:08.221 --> 00:44:11.160
go through your emails and they'll kill you that way.
But,
uh,
that's,

741
00:44:11.161 --> 00:44:13.080
that's what I,
that's what I feel and all that.
I think it's a,

742
00:44:13.081 --> 00:44:16.110
I think it's hopeless and um,
yeah,

743
00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:19.590
we're going to fuck it all up in the world at some point will be unlivable

744
00:44:19.591 --> 00:44:22.170
because it'd be so polluted and overpopulated and then we'll basically,

745
00:44:22.171 --> 00:44:26.760
I don't know,
some will happen a volcano or merciful asteroid and uh,
that's,

746
00:44:26.761 --> 00:44:29.610
those are my beliefs.
So they go,
hey,

747
00:44:29.611 --> 00:44:34.611
maybe that woman was right that I am more at peace and hopefully on Thursday re

748
00:44:34.671 --> 00:44:36.540
ask me that on Thursday and I'll be like,
you know what?

749
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.430
I think Hillary is the wonderful,

750
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:42.930
that'd be so great for women everywhere and men.
All right,

751
00:44:42.931 --> 00:44:46.350
thoughts on Pete rose?
Hey Bill,
big fan.

752
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.900
I know you're very passionate about sports.

753
00:44:48.901 --> 00:44:53.340
Was curious where you stood on Pete rose with all star game in Cincinnati this

754
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.550
year.
Now if ever would be the time to get for him to get reinstated.

755
00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.830
Now that you've got podcast twice a week,

756
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:01.620
thought you might have time to rant about Pete rose sometime.

757
00:45:01.621 --> 00:45:04.800
Check out the link below.
If you have a minute song.
I wrote,

758
00:45:04.801 --> 00:45:09.420
put rose in the hall of fame.
Love you brother.
Um,
I dunno,
you know,

759
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.710
I think when you fuck up like he did,

760
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:15.870
I mean that's the number one thing you're not supposed to do.

761
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:20.900
You're not supposed to a gamble on baseball because that fucks with the,

762
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:26.640
the,
uh,
the integrity of the game beyond like even like steroids.

763
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:29.083
<v 2>MMM.</v>

764
00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:34.240
<v 0>Cause then you're literally like trying to lose a game possibly,</v>

765
00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.480
which at least with steroids,
you're trying to fucking win.

766
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:39.640
At least you're trying to fucking win.
And I know he says,

767
00:45:39.641 --> 00:45:41.350
I never bet against my team,
but I mean,

768
00:45:41.351 --> 00:45:45.250
I dunno if anybody knows a fucking degenerate gambler.
I mean eventually,

769
00:45:45.251 --> 00:45:46.084
you know,

770
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:51.160
you get yourself into situations and you need that one big score and there's 162

771
00:45:51.161 --> 00:45:52.570
games.
Hey,

772
00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:56.260
why don't I bring that guy up from AAA and put them on the mouth and see what

773
00:45:56.261 --> 00:46:01.060
happens.
Um,
at the last second,
of course,
um,

774
00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:04.690
I wouldn't mind if they put them in at this point.
I feel like he paid the price,

775
00:46:04.691 --> 00:46:06.250
but I had no sympathy for the guy,

776
00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:07.173
<v 2>uh,</v>

777
00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:11.300
<v 0>you know,
for the first,
like 20 years of the shit.
But,
um,</v>

778
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:14.450
at this point he's an old man,
just put them in there.
I mean,
the guy,

779
00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:19.820
he was so great for baseball and it's just unfortunate that he had that problem.

780
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:24.320
And,
um,
I think he paid the price.
I'd let them back in.
They could go.
Huh?

781
00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:28.770
There's a little Thursday attitude for you.
Wasn't that nice?
Oh,

782
00:46:28.771 --> 00:46:33.720
it was that a little tear in my eye.
Um,
all right.
Where are we going here?

783
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:38.280
A dare devil.
Jesus Christ.
Daredevil.
Dear wonder bill.

784
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:43.380
You don't strike me as much of a comic book Fan.
Yeah,

785
00:46:43.381 --> 00:46:46.680
I liked him when I was a little kid.
Oh boy.

786
00:46:46.681 --> 00:46:50.580
Do you think aqua man could beat electric?
Man?
What about the gas burner?

787
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:52.123
Um,

788
00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:56.460
but you should really check out the new daredevils show on Netflix.

789
00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:59.940
The fighting is great.
Uh,
he gets his ass kicked,

790
00:46:59.941 --> 00:47:04.200
which adds to the reality of one guy walking into a room and facing seven
others.

791
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:08.870
Vincent D'onofrio.
All right.
I'm already in Rezai.
[inaudible] Dawson.
I'll write,

792
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:13.560
I'm in one of the hot chicks from true blood is in it.
It's dark as hell.

793
00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:17.520
Please report back with a review.
Uh,
are you caught up on the following?

794
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:19.570
I never saw the following.
Um,

795
00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:23.040
I'm trying to find where the fuck I can watch the pilots of better call Saul.

796
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:27.060
They don't have it as far as I can tell up on AMC.
If anybody can find me that,

797
00:47:27.061 --> 00:47:30.650
and like the first two episodes I have the rest of season taped episode three

798
00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:31.611
through the finale.

799
00:47:31.611 --> 00:47:36.050
I have to do that first and then I'm going to go to dare devil.

800
00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:38.150
I really want to get into Lord of the rings,

801
00:47:38.151 --> 00:47:41.360
but I just hate fucking period pieces with the fucking,

802
00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:46.640
I just hate the clothes,
you know what I mean?

803
00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:51.410
They're walking around and those castles with no central heating and nobody has

804
00:47:51.411 --> 00:47:55.280
ever shivering.
I just can't get into it.
Um,
all right.

805
00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:00.400
What does the following,
what is the fallen?
I mean,

806
00:48:00.401 --> 00:48:01.550
what the fuck is that that does that,

807
00:48:01.551 --> 00:48:04.380
that they'd better not be aware of Zombie of a vampire thing.

808
00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:09.050
If I had to guess the following.
Is that about somebody who starts a church?

809
00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:13.600
Is that what it is?
Come on old computer you can do it

810
00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:16.111
is that long.

811
00:48:16.111 --> 00:48:19.650
It takes my fucking God damn neighborhood because we won't have one of those

812
00:48:19.651 --> 00:48:23.910
fake Internet trees cause it will muscle the integrity of the aesthetics.

813
00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:29.460
The following,
the following,
uh,
I watched the most current episode on Hulu,

814
00:48:29.461 --> 00:48:30.660
the following TV series,

815
00:48:30.661 --> 00:48:35.661
a brilliant and charismatic yets psychotic serial killer communicates with other

816
00:48:35.881 --> 00:48:38.730
active serial killers.
How the fuck have I not been watching this?

817
00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.420
This is tremendous.

818
00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:46.550
And advocates a cult of believers following his every command.

819
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:48.811
All right.

820
00:48:48.811 --> 00:48:52.110
So what they did was they took the Charlie Manson thing and I think they added a

821
00:48:52.111 --> 00:48:52.944
little,
little,

822
00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:56.890
a little extra thing to what he used to have to stand in front of him.

823
00:48:56.891 --> 00:48:59.110
Now these guys can do whatever the fuck he wants.
He all right.
I'm in.

824
00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:00.990
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

825
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:01.740
<v 0>So can I do,</v>

826
00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:05.670
there's never been another time in the history of television where there's been

827
00:49:05.671 --> 00:49:09.060
this many unbelievable shows to watch.
Like it's insane.

828
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:12.480
I don't get why a TV shows so fucking great.

829
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.150
And it's so hard to find a good movie now.

830
00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:16.433
<v 2>Okay.</v>

831
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.840
<v 0>You know,
I mean,
people steal TV shows too.
I'm starting to think,</v>

832
00:49:19.841 --> 00:49:21.280
movies don't have an excuse anymore.

833
00:49:21.281 --> 00:49:25.330
Everything doesn't have to be a fucking hundred million dollar.
Uh,

834
00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:26.600
<v 2>okay.</v>

835
00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.160
<v 0>I don't know.
You don't actually did see a great movie.</v>

836
00:49:28.161 --> 00:49:29.480
I don't know if I brought this up at anybody.

837
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:34.160
See a wild tales is the name of it.
It was,

838
00:49:34.161 --> 00:49:34.880
um,

839
00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:39.470
a movie made by some director out of Argentina.

840
00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:43.220
It's fucking phenomenal.
It's like six back to back stories.

841
00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:46.820
Um,
almost,
it's kind of seems like,
like a format,

842
00:49:46.821 --> 00:49:50.240
like a Tarantino type of thing that he would do,
but they're unrelated.

843
00:49:50.241 --> 00:49:54.650
But there's a I a overall theme of this really dark comedy,

844
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:58.750
a revenge in that type of stuff.
And it's,
um,

845
00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:03.280
me and Nina saw it the other day.
We absolutely fucking loved it.
Um,

846
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:07.920
called wild tales.
Um,
definitely.

847
00:50:07.921 --> 00:50:11.860
Definitely check it out,
man.
It was,
it was,
um,
I don't know.

848
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:15.240
I'll tell you it was a great movie,
you know.
All right.
A great book.
Bill.

849
00:50:15.241 --> 00:50:19.020
I am reading this book,
um,
called men on strike.

850
00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:22.170
Why or why men are boycotting marriage,

851
00:50:22.171 --> 00:50:26.820
fatherhood and the American dream and why it matters.
Oh,
Jesus.
Dude,

852
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:30.170
why would you abandon all of that?
It is,

853
00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:34.730
it is a very in depth look at the lack of paternal rights and laws in this

854
00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:38.480
country.
I've been talking to a lot of younger guys in the military about it,

855
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:42.740
so they don't get caught up.
Um,
yeah.

856
00:50:42.741 --> 00:50:46.280
But what they should have is on the back end of that,
like,
okay,

857
00:50:46.281 --> 00:50:50.660
so if you never gonna get married and you never going to become a dad and have

858
00:50:50.661 --> 00:50:52.010
the picket fence and all that,

859
00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:56.270
what you need to do is you need to go hang out with some old playboys who are in

860
00:50:56.271 --> 00:50:59.330
their fifties,
early sixties,

861
00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:05.020
and you will see a sadness in their eyes that you do not want your soul.

862
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:06.950
I will tell you that because as much,

863
00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:10.790
as much as I go off and make fun of women and everything,
you know,

864
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.030
I am 10 times harder to live with,
you know,

865
00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:18.200
so I mean they're,
they're tortured by us too,

866
00:51:18.201 --> 00:51:23.160
but I really can tell you that going solo is not the way.
Um,

867
00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:26.150
for most people I would think.
I mean some people are just wired that way.
I mean,

868
00:51:26.151 --> 00:51:28.670
I have a little bit of that.
Like I am a big time,

869
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:31.490
big time loner.

870
00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:34.850
I got this weird thing where I won't shut the fuck up when I'm with my friends,

871
00:51:34.851 --> 00:51:38.540
but like anytime we have like company and Shit,
I swear to God,

872
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:40.970
I swear to God,
like I,

873
00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:45.040
I can only do it for like eight to 10 minutes and all of a sudden I'm,
I'm,

874
00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:48.770
I just have to get up and walk out and be by myself,

875
00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:53.720
sit outside in the porch just staring at a tree.
It's really fucking weird.

876
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:55.603
Um,

877
00:51:56.450 --> 00:52:00.380
unless maybe I'm just selfish and less the subject is something that I'm

878
00:52:00.381 --> 00:52:02.960
interested in what everybody's talking about.
I got to whisper this shift.

879
00:52:02.961 --> 00:52:04.190
My wife has this,
she's going to be pissed,

880
00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:08.240
a great bill and then post it like she's not going to find out about it.
Um,

881
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:14.060
no,
I just,
my brain just shuts down.
That's basically what happens.

882
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:17.030
And it's something that he has said about me a long time ago.
She goes,

883
00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:21.470
you've just,
if you don't give a fuck about something,
you just stop listening.

884
00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:25.250
And it's really annoying.
And it's like,
ah.
All right.
Well,

885
00:52:25.251 --> 00:52:27.020
I thought it was listening to my inner voice,

886
00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:36.970
you know?
I mean,
what,
what,
what the 40 I am.
I am.

887
00:52:36.971 --> 00:52:38.670
I'm always amazed at people that are,

888
00:52:38.671 --> 00:52:43.430
that have really good social graces,
you know what I mean?

889
00:52:43.431 --> 00:52:47.510
They come in,
they know how to throw a party,
make sure everybody's comfortable,

890
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:51.650
they notice that somebody's drink is empty and all of that.

891
00:52:51.651 --> 00:52:55.160
I just find this like,
hey,
how you doing?
All right.
Boom.
Is over there.

892
00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:00.980
See you later.
You know,
I come more with that vibe.

893
00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:03.590
I'm not gonna tell you right now.

894
00:53:03.591 --> 00:53:08.100
The second I'm done uploading this fucking thing like,
uh,
I am,
I don't know.

895
00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:13.120
I'm just going to go sit out on my porch staring at a tree thinking nothing.

896
00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:18.710
I don't know.
I think I'm probably slowly losing my fucking mind.
Who knows?
Um,

897
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:19.011
all right.

898

946
00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:09.700
I actually have to confess to stamps.com I went to the post office the other
day.

947
00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:12.013
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

948
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:15.810
<v 0>You know what it was?
Um,
I just wanted some colorful stamps.</v>

949
00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:20.520
Every once in a while,
you know,
I want some nice stamps and I got these,

950
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:21.270
I get these,

951
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:25.810
I stood in line and it was a shit show and it was every reason why I don't like

952
00:56:25.811 --> 00:56:26.644
going down there.

953
00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:30.100
And I came up in line and of course I was the next in line and then the fucking

954
00:56:30.101 --> 00:56:32.650
person hit puts the next window sign there.

955
00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:34.300
It really should just say go fuck yourself.

956
00:56:34.301 --> 00:56:38.170
And then pointed different directions.
So I'd get battle of New Orleans,

957
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:41.740
the war of 1812 stamps,
which I think are pretty cool.

958
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:45.550
And then I got these crazy circus ones and I hate the circus.

959
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:51.010
You got a bunch of scary clowns.
There's a tiger and an elephant,
which,
you know,

960
00:56:51.011 --> 00:56:54.990
were abused.
Um,
I know why.

961
00:56:54.991 --> 00:56:57.160
I'm telling you this and then I got a bunch that had flowers on them.

962
00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:00.760
They usually have some cool shit that we have like race cars and shit like that.

963
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:04.360
You know what I mean?
What do you fucking eight years old?
Well,
Hey,
you know what?

964
00:57:04.361 --> 00:57:08.200
I'm a big kid.
Go Fuck Yourself.
I enjoy that type of stuff.
Anyways.
Um,

965
00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.830
this is the,
this is the deal for this week,
man.

966
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:14.830
The biggest thing in my life here is this bus tour coming up and I got to tell

967
00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:15.664
you,
uh,

968
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:19.330
I'm so fucking excited to be going to these cities because I've never been there

969
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.890
and I'm going to be in front of a bunch of people that I haven't had the

970
00:57:23.891 --> 00:57:28.670
opportunity to,
to perform in front of and their vibe.
I'm never going to,

971
00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.530
it's going to be a new experience.
You know,

972
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:36.160
when you get out of your comfort zone and there's going to be a lot of shit that

973
00:57:36.161 --> 00:57:39.520
I'm going to say that they're going to take maybe in a different way,

974
00:57:39.521 --> 00:57:41.230
which will cause other things to happen.

975
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:44.320
It's going to be and it's going to be so much fun and I'm going to not

976
00:57:44.321 --> 00:57:47.530
understand what they're saying.
Sometimes the other way around.

977
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:50.740
It's the fucking greatest.
And,
uh,
it's going to be me,

978
00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:55.960
Paul Versey and Jason Law head and,
uh,
Eh,
I can't wait.

979
00:57:55.961 --> 00:57:57.310
So please,
if you're in the area,

980
00:57:57.430 --> 00:58:00.520
please come out and tell your friends about it and,
uh,

981
00:58:00.521 --> 00:58:02.320
we'll give you a great show.
And then with that,

982
00:58:02.321 --> 00:58:04.750
that is the podcast for this week.
So once again,

983
00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:07.630
congratulations to the Senate as you guys deserve that you were the better

984
00:58:07.631 --> 00:58:10.120
fucking team.
Congratulations to the penguins,

985
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:16.270
the fucking penguins,
um,
rangers,
even the Canadians.

986
00:58:16.271 --> 00:58:18.340
Congratulations all you guys hope you guys,
whatever.

987
00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:21.430
I'm not going to be a cunt about this,
so,
right.
Good luck to all of you.

988
00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:25.960
I hope all your dreams come true even though it will only happen for one fan

989
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:27.100
base.
Um,

990
00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:32.770
so I'm rooting for the capitals and uh,
I've kind of become a kings fan.

991
00:58:32.771 --> 00:58:37.600
It got to admit it,
but,
uh,
I will also be rooting for the blues,
um,

992
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:40.330
just because they haven't won it.
I don't even know where the predators in it.

993
00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.900
A roof for something like that.
Then the jets,
they have a one it,

994
00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:48.250
I dunno who gives a fuck this kind of a freedom for your team not being in it.

995
00:58:48.251 --> 00:58:50.680
Then he,
you know,
you don't,
you can stop ruining.
Oh,
when people I root against,

996
00:58:50.681 --> 00:58:54.340
I will always move against the Canadians.
It's my job as a Bruins fan.
That's it.

997
00:58:54.341 --> 00:58:56.200
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.
