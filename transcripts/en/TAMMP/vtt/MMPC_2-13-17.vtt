1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.010
Hey,
what's going on?
What's going on?
It's bill bird.

2
00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:07.380
It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:12.360
February 13th,
2017 what's going on?

4
00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:15.630
How?
Why?
Yeah.
Huh?
Y'All,
how you doing over there?

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.090
Why is it,

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.460
why is Friday the 13th on lucky and Monday the 13th all that's just fucking
fuck.

7
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.760
You know who was a pussy?
You came up with that one.

8
00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:31.470
You think Monday the 13th fuck you're unlucky 13 and it's Monday and I got five

9
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:35.430
fucking days in front of me.
I have to work Friday 13 who gives a shit?

10
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.450
You stub your toe a couple of times and next thing you know you're at the Tgi

11
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:40.470
Fridays,
right?

12
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.950
You down their eyeball and one of the ladies,
yeah,

13
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.460
you come up to her,
you tell her you like her striped shirt.

14
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.380
Start bitching about the horrible day you had.
You know,
and she's a woman,

15
00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:54.820
so she'll listen to it.

16
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.280
She'll kick into that motherly instinct unless she already has kids and then she

17
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:02.340
doesn't have time for it,
you know?
Then she looks at,
just says,
listen,

18
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:03.830
I made sucking your Dick Guy.
Right?

19
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.420
So you get the fuck out of here and then you move on to something yoga.

20
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.790
It's not how it goes.
Why?
What is so fucking unlucky?
You know what?

21
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:13.590
I didn't even know it was going to.
I gotta look this up now.

22
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.210
Why is Friday the 13th unlucky?
Hang on his stomach.
Hit pause for a second.

23
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.200
All right,
before I can,
I just looked it up.
I didn't read any.
I just got,

24
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:25.500
I just got to the Google thing where they got whatever it is on the first page.

25
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.520
All right.
Whose kid know with the Internet,
whatever the fact is,

26
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.750
the fact is whatever you look up within the first two fucking clicks on the

27
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:38.310
first page becomes the truth.
That's it.
Okay,

28
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:39.900
so that's what the fuck I'm looking at.

29
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.890
You know if the right answer to any question is fucking beyond what you have to

30
00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:51.060
scroll down on the first page of any subject on a of the Internet,
it's,

31
00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:53.480
it's over.
No one's ever going to know the truth because it,
who?

32
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.620
Who the fuck ever goes to page 14

33
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.760
<v 0>okay?</v>

34
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.060
<v 1>Not even journalists do that.
They don't give a shit.
I'm all right.</v>

35
00:02:01.061 --> 00:02:04.210
I'm going to say it either has to do with,
uh,

36
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.310
it's gotta be religious.
It's gotta be religious.
Jesus did something.

37
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.690
He always had bad Friday's,
didn't he?
No.
He had a good Friday.
Good.

38
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.200
Today's Good Friday.
What happened on Good Friday?

39
00:02:17.201 --> 00:02:21.130
Then the little rock roll back and he came walking out,

40
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.631
you know,

41
00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:25.180
like one of those fucking movies where they thought they killed the guy and he

42
00:02:25.181 --> 00:02:27.410
didn't.
And then he comes back step,

43
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:30.880
not like Tom Sawyer fucking creep hanging out at his own funeral.

44
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.190
I was done with that kid once he did.

45
00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:37.030
That shows that these kids are fucking Weirdo.
I'm all right.
Friday the 13th.

46
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:42.031
Why is it unlucky and other facts about the worst day in the calendar?

47
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.850
In the calendar,
not on the calendar.
We're in it.
We're not in it.
We're not on it.

48
00:02:48.851 --> 00:02:49.370
All right.
Finally,

49
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.190
13th considered by many as one of the unluckiest days of the year is almost here

50
00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:57.610
again.
This is from January,
2017.

51
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.950
Uh Oh shit.
January 13th well fuck.
Nothing happened to us.
If he's still alive.

52
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.450
If you're worried about what's in storable Bababa,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

53
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.080
What the fuck in 2000 here's some of the fun facts.

54
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.770
When is the next Friday?
The 13th and why?
Stupid.
All right,
baby.

55
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.430
We'll orange origins.
All right.
Course.
It always goes back to the Bible.
Oh,
Jesus.

56
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:26.040
His Dad's mad.
Dad's coming home.
He's not in a good fucking mood.

57
00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:29.070
He had a bad week,
you know?

58
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.130
Of course it's the kid's fault.
Stupid cunt.

59
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.650
He tried to build everything in six fucking days.

60
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.620
Typical do it yourself job.

61
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.410
Why didn't you farm it out to someone in know what the fuck they were doing?

62
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.340
Built the thing up to code yet.

63
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:47.341
Dope fucking stick in a steel beam in the middle of a fucking wood wall.

64
00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:50.210
Yeah.
Everything above it is supported better.
What about below it?
Debt.

65
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.120
What about below it?
The fuck did this music come from?

66
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.140
All right,
let's read with this music on in the background.

67
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.300
Superstition about this day is not to have,
I can't do this.

68
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.460
Start to have come about.
All right.
That's enough of that.

69
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.310
During the Middle Ages in many have biblical origin.

70
00:04:14.311 --> 00:04:18.800
Some historians have claimed it was the day on which eve bit the apple from the

71
00:04:18.801 --> 00:04:20.840
tree of knowledge.
Jesus Christ.

72
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.923
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

73
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.330
<v 1>Hold it just scared the shit out of me.
Nia.
The lovely near everybody.
Oh,</v>

74
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:32.230
with my beautiful daughter.
Two lovely ladies.

75
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.780
What's going on?
Uh,
I thought you were done.
Sorry.
No,

76
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:40.450
I was watching the videos that people sent me this week.
What's going on?

77
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:44.290
Are you going to drop her off?
No,
I can't do the podcast the way I talk.

78
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:47.620
That's why I was in here with the door closed.
It's a pocket door,
by the way.

79
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:51.720
If you wonder why,
just squeak.
Like we live in a haunted house.
No,

80
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.430
I just found another,
I just saw another place that uh,

81
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.400
I want to show you that maybe you wanted to order from.
Yeah,

82
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.370
just order me something remotely healthy.
Okay.

83
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.230
Something to stave off the calories.
I consume an alcohol.
Okay.

84
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.590
Would you like some sort of like a,

85
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.270
a bowl with rice and Tofu and that sorta thing?
I hate Tofu.

86
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.810
It's gotta be a real dead animal and vegetables.
Okay.
So you want,

87
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.190
you want meat so I shouldn't order from a vegan place then I like I vegan.

88
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:22.150
As long as there's none of that Tofu.
I don't understand what that stuff is.

89
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.440
That's like the type of shit that they seal capsule with some Tofu.
Yeah.

90
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:30.340
So liquid doesn't be good.
It's not good for you.
Tell us who is not good for you.

91
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.203
No.

92
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.960
Are you sure you're thinking until four or you when a TOEFL doesn't come from a

93
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:37.210
tree,
does it?
There's no tofu trees.

94
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.610
I thought Tofu was made from soybeans.
Yeah,
but isn't so bad for you.

95
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.810
No.
Always.
I have no idea.
Let me get your phone for you.
I don't know.

96
00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:49.360
Just if you're going to order from a Vegan place,
just get me vegetables.

97
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:53.960
Shit that I,
I,
you know,
I know what I know what it is.
I Dunno what Tofu was.

98
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.030
It's like fucking allergy or something.
Okay.
All right.

99
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:02.810
Shuffles Nia.
Do you know why Friday the 13th is unlucky?

100
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.870
I Dunno either.
I've been reading about it here.
The new,

101
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.450
and then they started to say that Eve fucking maybe bit the apple.
Oh,

102
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.730
they were in paradise.
There was no calendar.
What do they have to worry about?

103
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.460
Snow bills.
I,
you have to go to work.
Right.
You know,
what did they do in,
in,

104
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.940
in fucking eat off shit.
It Monday.
Same Shit.
Different Day.

105
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:24.290
It's fucking paradise.

106
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.310
<v 2>No salad though.</v>

107
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.580
<v 1>I was an honor to stand.
Why?
If it was paradise,</v>

108
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.640
why they had a fucking snake in there trying to fuck everything up.

109
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.033
<v 2>The devil.</v>

110
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.460
<v 1>Yeah.
But that's on God</v>

111
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:39.880
<v 2>to separate.</v>

112
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.410
<v 1>They're not to say if God made everything else made.</v>

113
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.030
He also made the comment of all cons.
Did he not?

114
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.770
<v 2>Oh No.
But the devil was an Angela like cast out.</v>

115
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.710
<v 1>So the devil was basically a bad hire.
Yes.</v>

116
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.090
It came back and tried to take his company down.
All right.
Yeah.
Okay.

117
00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.080
Let me finish reading this.
Okay.
And the New Testament,
um,

118
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.990
I love,
or they blame the woman.
Like that's why everything's all fucked up.

119
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.420
I mean,
without a doubt,
if you told a broad,

120
00:07:06.421 --> 00:07:10.170
did not go over there and eat the fucking apple,
she's going to be intrigued.

121
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.170
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

122
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.880
<v 1>You know,
like a guy wouldn't.
Whatever you did,
that's still classic thing.</v>

123
00:07:15.881 --> 00:07:18.460
Like it's substitute teaching.
Whatever you do,
don't laugh.

124
00:07:18.461 --> 00:07:20.890
Next person who labs gets to tension,
that's it.
You're done.

125
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.630
You fucking squeeze in your nose doing that fucking little kid laugh.

126
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.290
That's it.
Next thing you know,
you're missing a week of research,
uh,
recess.

127
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.810
That's why you got all these fed fucking kids.

128
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.690
The regular teacher takes the day off to substitute.

129
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:37.480
Teacher creates the tension though.

130
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.040
The one skinny kid starts laughing and then he's done.

131
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.170
He's eating that fucking food down in the cafeteria that's got all the

132
00:07:44.171 --> 00:07:45.130
preservatives in it.

133
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.670
Do you know if you fucking kill somebody younger and nobody figures it out,

134
00:07:48.671 --> 00:07:50.650
you're not in the clear for a good 40 years.

135
00:07:50.651 --> 00:07:53.580
That's how long the digging people up from 12 years ago in there.

136
00:07:53.581 --> 00:07:55.240
Then it's like they took a fucking nap.

137
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.820
<v 2>Okay.</v>

138
00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.770
<v 1>Hey,
I'll tell you these people,
they're full of preservatives,
you know?
All right,</v>

139
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.060

Today's I getting on the elliptical,
which was a good thing.
All right.

You should see me.
I look like a,

184
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.290
I don't look like I've been doing smack.

185
00:10:55.291 --> 00:11:00.291
I just looked like somebody just pinched my fucking inside of my elbow really

186
00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:05.190
fucking hard.
Um,
anyway,
so I did all that.
Ugh.

187
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.390
What a shit show that was fucking guy's sitting there going,
oh dear.

188
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.130
Do you drink it all right and like he's got his back to my bar,

189
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.450
which I told you his murderer's row,
the bottles I have there,

190
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:22.890
I told you right now I'd put it up against the 27 Yankees to 96 bowls.

191
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.690
Let's go some underrated teams.
The 83 76 hours,
somehow lost in history,

192
00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:30.210
but how fucking great day.
We're right.

193
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.600
The 86 Celtics see 85 Lakers

194
00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.310
the fuck in 2016 New England patriots.

195
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:45.370
I'm the 98 Yankees.
That was a great team for the fucking free agent.

196
00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:47.110
Their weight.
I mean,

197
00:11:47.111 --> 00:11:49.480
speaking of which though that the red sox and doing that this year,

198
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.060
it's a good year to get the package,
no matter what,

199
00:11:52.061 --> 00:11:52.871
you're going to be entertained.

200
00:11:52.871 --> 00:11:57.310
Do you get to watch like a fucking $900 million team?
Shit,
the bed or just,

201
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.340
you know,
there is no Santa Claus.
We're buying it one or the other.

202
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.870
Either way it's going to be dramatic.
Um,
so anyways,

203
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:09.250
I got a such a funny question.
I make drinks tea.
I don't fucking know.

204
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:16.630
Do I have a pocket protector?
I don't count them.
I like,
you know,
they,

205
00:12:16.631 --> 00:12:17.730
they always think,
you know what's funny?

206
00:12:17.731 --> 00:12:22.140
They fucking say having a glass of wine with your meal is actually good for you.

207
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.510
You know what I mean?
So I mean,
I don't,
I don't understand that.

208
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.020
<v 0>Okay.</v>

209
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.130
<v 1>Do you smoke?
Yeah,
Lou a little bit.</v>

210
00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.500
Fucking lying your ass off.
Um,

211
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.220
<v 0>okay.</v>

212
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.070
<v 1>Oh Jesus,
I will.
Can you imagine if he,
if you magic anybody,</v>

213
00:12:38.071 --> 00:12:40.680
even if fucking people who work there,
if you answer to any of those questions,

214
00:12:40.681 --> 00:12:43.740
fucking honestly,
you know what I mean?
Alright.
Uh,
Bruins.

215
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:47.100
And I probably shouldn't be talking about this.
Who gives a shit?

216
00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:50.210
There's a comedy,
podcasts.
These are all jokes.
Everybody.
Um,

217
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.810
this is what I did today.
My fucking dumb ass did today.
So,
you know,

218
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.380
I'm going to be the person,
a presenter at the writer's guild.

219
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.790
No,

yeah,
the writers guild awards thing.
Right.

220
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.770
And,
uh,
so let's say it's a black tie thing and I'm like,
oh fuck,

221
00:13:07.771 --> 00:13:10.440
I gotta get a fucking Tuxedo.
So I call it,
by the time I call up,

222
00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:12.510
it's too late to get one.
So Nia,

223
00:13:12.511 --> 00:13:14.670
Google some pictures and everybody seems like relaxed.

224
00:13:14.671 --> 00:13:17.010
Like they're just wearing suits with a black tie.
So I say,
fuck it.

225
00:13:17.011 --> 00:13:20.070
I'll wear one of my suits.
I pull out a suit,
I get the shirt,

226
00:13:20.071 --> 00:13:22.140
we do the whole fucking thing.
I got it to go and all that.

227
00:13:22.141 --> 00:13:24.000
So today I'm dressing up.

228
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

229
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:28.550
<v 1>You know,
I'm hanging with my daughter,

230
00:13:28.551 --> 00:13:29.570

231
00:13:29.571 --> 00:13:34.160

232
00:13:34.161 --> 00:13:37.070

And A,

233
00:13:37.071 --> 00:13:39.260

I'm looking around,

239
00:13:54.771 --> 00:13:59.240
I don't see anybody
just sitting there and it finally dawns on me.
I'm like,

240
00:13:59.241 --> 00:14:02.930

246
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.770
<v 0>Okay.</v>

247
00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.390
<v 1>I know that you know,

248
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.280

249
00:14:29.281 --> 00:14:34.220
What do you want from me?
Um,

250
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.330
uh,
this is something I got to let you guys know about.
Um,

251
00:14:38.331 --> 00:14:40.280
the Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit,

252
00:14:40.281 --> 00:14:44.840
the fifth annual Patrice O'neal comedy event,
uh,

253
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:50.180
Uh,

254
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:54.470

Um,

256
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.210
Jesus Christ with the fucking open under the door there.

257
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.130
What is ridiculous?
How am I trashing you?

258
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.400
Got Mad at you because you can make them,

259
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.840

don't yell.
You've got the kid there.

260
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.133
<v 3>What?</v>

261
00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.850
It's absolutely absurd for you to not know when things are anymore.

262
00:15:23.851 --> 00:15:28.170
It's like you're a grown ass man and he's got all dressed to go to the,

263
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.930
why is it always grown ass?
Why can't you say you're a grown up?

264
00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:35.250
I can say whatever I want to say and I'm choosing to say that you're a grown ass

265
00:15:35.251 --> 00:15:38.550
man who can't seem to write anything and is that because you're a strong woman

266
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.310
to the point where you're going to get all dressed up and be like,
well,

267
00:15:41.311 --> 00:15:42.900
what am I going to wear?
There's nothing the other,

268
00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:45.240
and then you come downstairs five minutes later like,
well,

269
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.160
it's next week with you.

270
00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.140
You need to get it together.
It's not cute.

271
00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:53.643
<v 0>Okay.</v>

272
00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.190
<v 1>Yeah.
That's like the first thing I've screwed up like that a long time.</v>

273
00:15:58.191 --> 00:16:01.820
I have a bunch of events in my phone right in the calendar section we're getting

274
00:16:01.821 --> 00:16:05.000
when things are,
you're always getting the dates wrong and it's frustrating.

275
00:16:05.001 --> 00:16:06.110
It's just annoying.

276
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:07.303
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

277
00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.490
<v 1>All right,
but how am I doing as a dad?</v>

278
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.350
<v 3>What does that have to do with anything you're doing amazingly as it all right.</v>

279
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.980
We'll stop acting like I'm in some shooting heroin in an alley acting like a

280
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.620
shooting heroin in an alley,
but you just need,

281
00:16:20.621 --> 00:16:24.030
I just don't understand why you can't ever get your schedules to,
hey,

282
00:16:24.031 --> 00:16:28.030
you're always getting the dates wrong.
Like,
oh,
it's tomorrow.
Not Today.

283
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.690
It's next week.
Not this week.
Like I don't,
I don't get it.

284
00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.370
<v 1>Yeah,
I'm busy and I don't have an assistant.</v>

285
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.580
<v 3>You will.
You should get an assistant.
I don't want another person to talk to.</v>

286
00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:43.410
I've been telling you when you get an assistant for like three years now because

287
00:16:43.411 --> 00:16:45.240
of this very reason.

288
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:45.701
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

289
00:16:45.701 --> 00:16:49.030
You want to hear all this shit I did this week that I made totally got there on

290
00:16:49.031 --> 00:16:52.180
time.
You don't.
Okay.
You know why?

291
00:16:52.181 --> 00:16:54.350
Because that would prove my point if I was a baseball and share.

292
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.760
What is your point exactly at 99% of Shit I get there on time.

293
00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.740
99% 98

294
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.390
<v 3>no and you did</v>

295
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:07.540
<v 1>get mad at me.
I'm not.
I said,
well then what's the problem?</v>

296
00:17:07.541 --> 00:17:11.020
Why did you have to draw a radically open her squeaky pocket door to come in

297
00:17:11.021 --> 00:17:12.910
here and cert yourself on the podcast?

298
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:16.390
<v 0>All right.</v>

299
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:21.020
<v 1>Are you done?
Are you kicking me out now?
Are you almost done?
No,</v>

300
00:17:21.021 --> 00:17:25.340
I've just started.
Well,
people send me a note.
I'm 17 minutes in.
Oh,

301
00:17:25.341 --> 00:17:29.120
Jesus.
And I came up here to watch the Grammy's,
but I can't turn the TV on now.

302
00:17:29.121 --> 00:17:32.180
Right?
It'll go watch the grammys.
Okay.
I'm going to,

303
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.450
is it going to be a bunch of people like right new versus about how Trump's the

304
00:17:36.451 --> 00:17:37.490
most evil thing ever.

305
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.630
There's some check that showed up on the red carpet weighing it's sparkly dress,

306
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.540
<v 3>make America great again,
and then Trump on the back of it.</v>

307
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:49.380
I don't know who she is,
but everyone's already like,
what?
Oh my gosh.
She's like,

308
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:50.280
just for somebody

309
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.570
<v 1>to show up at a Hollywood event like that and addressed it says like,</v>

310
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.830
you know it's approach.
Trump is pretty,
it's pretty paint by numbers shock,

311
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.960
I guess.
Do you think she'll get some free press out of that?
I think she will.

312
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:07.020
Yeah.
Was she wearing Madonna's Baret?
No,
she was not.

313
00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.450
I'm going to a protest.
What should I wear?
Uh,
no.

314
00:18:12.451 --> 00:18:16.050
It's just when you're pro Trump approach Trump dress is what I'm saying.
I know.

315
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.090
I know because that other shit is played out.

316
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.310
You're acting like the sky is falling,

317
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.860
so now they're going to go the other direction.
Yeah,
I know,

318
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:25.440
but I feel like that's not going to be like good press for her.

319
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.320
You know what I mean?
Hey,
totes.
Any,
any press is good.

320
00:18:28.321 --> 00:18:32.280
Press tell this dirty time works.
Yeah,
I guess so.
Okay.

321
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.560
Well you could just put out a good album,
right?

322
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.770
And not rely on your stupid clothes.
Yeah.
If you put out a good albums,

323
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.310
you can keep your clothes on.
You don't have to say who you voted for.

324
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:45.720
B can just go up there and no,
except your shiny thick.
That's true.
All right.

325
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.460
I'm going to take the baby.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
Okay,
bye.
Anyways.

326
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:56.520
Hi everybody.
I'm glad.
Yes.
All right.
If you pull the door lower,

327
00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.610
it doesn't squeak as much.
See,
there you go.

328
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.540
See that?
You almost did it.

329
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.050
You can watch the Grammy's.
Nick,
go ahead.

330
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:11.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

331
00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:16.130
<v 1>Um,
anyways,
oh,
by the way,
I'm going to fuck this up.</v>

332
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:21.320
The two fucking best channels right now in my,
in my,
uh,

333
00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:25.280
not humble opinion.
Hey,
people say in my humble opinion,

334
00:19:25.281 --> 00:19:27.410
like you're a humble person.
You're not,

335
00:19:27.411 --> 00:19:32.411
you're injecting your fucking ideas most likely into a conversation that you

336
00:19:32.661 --> 00:19:35.750
just overheard.
Or is that just me in my opinion?

337
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.740
I don't know when the humble came about,
you know,
hey,
you know,
I bought,
who am I?

338
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:43.100
Who am I?
Who are you?
You're the fucking guy that is,
is,
you know,

339
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.200
holding court right now with you with your opinions.

340
00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.170
It's not the fucking humble about this.
You shining a spotlight on yourself.

341
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.410
You know,
I'm actually in a good mood too.
Hang on a second.
Let me,

342
00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.850
let me fucking find this stuff.
There's too fucking channels out there.

343
00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:01.000
Viceland is the shit.
I already told you about that.
And now what's his face?
Uh,

344
00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:06.910
puffy.
She has a new network.
Puffy.
You can't,

345
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:08.290
<v 0>okay.</v>

346
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:12.760
<v 1>Puffy is network.
They said net worth revolt.</v>

347
00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:14.290
It's another great fucking channel.

348
00:20:14.291 --> 00:20:17.560
Both of those channels remind me of the early days of MTV.

349
00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.090
The early days of MTV was somewhere between,

350
00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.673
um,

351
00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:29.820
obviously regular television and then just basic cable fucking lunatics,

352
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.310
which I really miss.
I remember I used to watch this guy.
Uh

353
00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.440
<v 0>Huh Damon.</v>

354
00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.880
<v 1>Zach's talks about this a long time ago in the [inaudible] and Anthony Show.</v>

355
00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.130
He used to pretend he was running for office.

356
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:48.250
Damon Zach's,
there it is.
There it is.

357
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.610
This guy was a fucking superstar.

358
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:57.220
I think it was channel eight
areas.

359
00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.750
I love this fucking guy.

360
00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:07.300
Oh this is,
this isn't going to translate.
Well d a m.
O.
N.
Z.
E.
X.
N.

361
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.840
He used to do this thing where you pretend that he was running for office,

362
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.760
this crazy makeup on and just saying all this fucked up shit.

363
00:21:15.761 --> 00:21:19.340
And me and Bobby Kelly,
we'll live in together when stone.
So,

364
00:21:19.341 --> 00:21:20.920
but we would just watch that guy

365
00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.630
like late night after we did our spots,

366
00:21:24.631 --> 00:21:28.860
just ordered Chinese food and would just sit there watching the guy laughing our

367
00:21:28.861 --> 00:21:31.800
asses off and fucking getting freaked out.

368
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:33.443
<v 2>MMM.</v>

369
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:36.860
<v 1>I Dunno.
But the early days of MTV was like that and I haven't seen,
you know,</v>

370
00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:41.240
network television or basic cable be like that in a long time.

371
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:43.520
And I got to tell you those two fucking channels.

372
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:45.123
<v 2>MMM.</v>

373
00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:50.110
<v 1>Just great.
A bunch of random shit in their,
uh,
original shows.</v>

374
00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:51.913
<v 2>MMM.</v>

375
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.150
<v 1>I don't know.
Puffy is more like,
I just sat there watching it.</v>

376
00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:01.550
It was that guy a what the fuck's his name?
Not Mike Jones guys.

377
00:22:01.551 --> 00:22:06.050
Really killer Mike Killer Mike.
And I guess the guy he wraps with his white,

378
00:22:06.051 --> 00:22:08.750
I don't know anything about,
but they fucking just filmed them.

379
00:22:08.751 --> 00:22:12.020
They just sat around talking about their albums.
One Guy Smoking weed,

380
00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.830
he has like a fucking coughing fit for like 30 seconds.

381
00:22:15.831 --> 00:22:19.180
They don't even edit it out
out of habit.

382
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.440
Just sitting there and I'm like two hours into this thing going,

383
00:22:21.441 --> 00:22:23.120
how the fuck am I still watching this?

384
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.360
But it was way more interesting than a lot of,
I don't know.
I like it.

385
00:22:26.361 --> 00:22:28.610
Check it out if he,
if he,
if feel like it,
you like it,
whatever.

386
00:22:28.611 --> 00:22:32.990
What are you going to do?
Um,
anyways.
All right,
let's,
uh,

387
00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:37.670
let's talk about the world of sports as I always do,
as I eventually do,

388
00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.470
as I always make my way back to the old bread and circus here.
Um,

389
00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:47.330
Bruce Cassidy,
new coach of the Boston Bruins,
former player,

390
00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.550
came up with the Blackhawks and like the eighties,

391
00:22:49.551 --> 00:22:51.530
and unfortunately I'd like three or four knee injuries.

392
00:22:51.531 --> 00:22:54.340
This is all I know about the guy.
And then,
um,

393
00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:58.250
he paid his fucking dues as a coach coming up.

394
00:22:58.251 --> 00:23:00.710
My favorite stopped that he had on the way up,

395
00:23:00.711 --> 00:23:05.600
he coached for the Jacksonville Lizard Kinks,
which,
you know,

396
00:23:05.601 --> 00:23:08.810
I'm throwing and I'm throwing my vote and that's one of the best,
uh,

397
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.210
<v 2>okay.</v>

398
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.630
<v 1>It's one of the best fucking names from minor league tema the Lizard kinks.</v>

399
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.940
It's a reference to the doors.

400
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:21.420
They got a bunch of reptiles in Florida and fucking Jim Morrison got arrested in

401
00:23:22.121 --> 00:23:24.160
Florida for allegedly taking his dick out.

402
00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:27.400
Also known in some circles as you lizard

403
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.980
and who doesn't want to be a king?
You know,
if you've got the Sacramento Kings,

404
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.480
you got the La kings and he got the Jacksonville Lizard kinks.
Um,
anyways,

405
00:23:37.481 --> 00:23:41.340
he's undefeated so far,
you know,
granted,
you know,

406
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.880
we were playing their best hockey I felt to this season when I,

407
00:23:43.881 --> 00:23:46.970
when he took over.
But uh,
this is the new guy,
you know,

408
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:51.860
I got to a support there.
Um,
what's his face posture?
Knock with the fucking,

409
00:23:51.861 --> 00:23:54.320
uh,
with the game winner

410
00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:01.120
against the Vancouver Canucks after he made it very sketchy pass in the first

411
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:05.600
period.
He makes it up fucking unbelievable.
K down the fucking left side,

412
00:24:05.601 --> 00:24:08.920
slammed on the brakes,
just like I do it,

413
00:24:08.921 --> 00:24:13.390
pick up hockey except he actually stopped rather than continuing into the boards

414
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.300
and hurting himself.
Um,
and then fucking little,
whatever the fuck he did,

415
00:24:17.301 --> 00:24:20.740
he put it in.
It was fantastic.
Oh,
it was tremendous.
Um,

416
00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.670
but I got to tell you guys about the greatest sporting event I think I've been

417
00:24:24.671 --> 00:24:27.730
to since I went to the,
uh,

418
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:32.650
New England patriots first Los Angeles Rams when we won our first super bowl

419
00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:39.170
and all I can tell you about Duke at Cameron indoor arena.

420
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:40.680
It's like

421
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:47.500
how loud the crowd was with Vinod Terry kicked that field goal.

422
00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:52.430
It was that loud,
the whole fucking game.

423
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.670
I've never been to anything like it.
And we sat in the low,

424
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.480
he was sitting in center court.
I thought we're going to be behind the bench.

425
00:24:59.481 --> 00:25:03.200
Sorry about that.
We would send a court,
um,

426
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:07.730
not on the student's side across from them in the lower area.
And Dude,

427
00:25:07.731 --> 00:25:09.830
I'll tell you,
there's no fucking way to get out of there.

428
00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.940
There's no way to go to the bathroom.
There's no way to fucking,

429
00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.080
there's nobody coming around a concessions.
You are fucked.
You are in there.

430
00:25:18.081 --> 00:25:21.670
And that is it.
Old School.
Fucking barn.
Um,

431
00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:23.850
<v 0>okay.</v>

432
00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.740
<v 1>You went in,
it's so small.
I guess it holds like 9,000 people,
but you have,</v>

433
00:25:26.741 --> 00:25:31.741
you felt like you were in there with like 200 people and we came in and it was

434
00:25:31.891 --> 00:25:33.180
already,
uh,

435
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:37.620
they were already shooting around before the game and uh,

436
00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:38.970
we finally got to our seats.

437
00:25:38.971 --> 00:25:41.990
Like you just don't think that you seats are even going to be there because

438
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.210
everybody is so jammed in.
And um,

439
00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:47.520
we didn't sit down for the whole fucking game.

440
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.360
I guess I started sitting down during timeouts cause I'm old and I got to tell

441
00:25:51.361 --> 00:25:55.140
you,
I've never,
I've never seen an atmosphere like that ever.

442
00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:59.920
This beats everything.
I've been to the NCAA.
Uh,

443
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.840
the championship game was in the fucking Georgia dome.

444
00:26:03.841 --> 00:26:06.570
So I mean that's a shitty place to watch a basketball game.

445
00:26:06.571 --> 00:26:10.120
Even if people go nuts,
it just floats up to the top of the,
the,
the,

446
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.350
the dom and you don't even hear it.
Um,

447
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.090
<v 0>okay.</v>

448
00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:18.580
<v 1>I've just,
I,
I don't even know what,
I didn't know where to begin.</v>

449
00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.280
And then it was an unbelievable game,
just back and forth,

450
00:26:21.281 --> 00:26:24.250
back and forth when it looked like you was going to pull away,

451
00:26:24.251 --> 00:26:25.330
Duke would come back.

452
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.360
Then it looked like Duke was going to have the game on ice and then you wouldn't

453
00:26:28.361 --> 00:26:30.040
see,
would come back.
Somebody hit a three,

454
00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.220
someone else would hit a fucking three was unbelievable.

455
00:26:33.221 --> 00:26:37.000
And I was very impressed with both teams.
I like that kid on UNC number 44.

456
00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:38.650
He doesn't rattle.

457
00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:42.610
He doesn't fucking act like he changed the game of basketball when he hits a

458
00:26:42.611 --> 00:26:44.730
shot he gave a fuck about was winning.

459
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:49.080
He had some big three pointer and then they immediately called timeout and

460
00:26:49.081 --> 00:26:51.960
rather than thumping his own chest and acting like he's in Braveheart,

461
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:54.870
he came back to the bench high fiber.

462
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.930
Do you see he was pissed because they just said just let up an easy bucket

463
00:26:57.931 --> 00:27:02.010
before he hit his three.
And um,
I don't know.

464
00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:03.090
I don't know shit about anything,

465
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:06.270
but if I was a scout I would pay attention to that just as much as somebody's

466
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:11.220
actually doing great things out on the court.
And um,
it was insane.
Dude.

467
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.960
Fucking coach k coming out.
I just,
I'm reminded me of when I,

468
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:17.610
when I went to the king's game,

469
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.190
when they wrapped it up one time to win a Stanley Cup and I saw them bring the

470
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:24.780
Stanley Cup out.
It was like that except it could walk around talking.

471
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:29.160
So I want to thank,
uh,

472
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.640
I want to thank my call at the comedy zone in Charlotte for two awesome shows.

473
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.430
And thank you so much for getting us in touch with a person that hooked us up

474
00:27:38.431 --> 00:27:43.140
with the tickets a me versus the bar,
Nick.
We're all sitting there going,

475
00:27:43.141 --> 00:27:46.920
I think that might've been the greatest sporting event I went to.

476
00:27:46.921 --> 00:27:50.880
Obviously seeing the Patriots win the super bowl was bigger,
but um,

477
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:56.040
the level of excitement.
I,
I just never been,
never been to anything like that.

478
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.390
And uh,
if you ever get a fucking chance,
um,

479
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.740
that is definitely one worth stub.
Hobbing

480
00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:03.453
<v 2>MMM.</v>

481
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:08.410
<v 1>Oh,
the college give fucking the students were crazy and they had all these funny</v>

482
00:28:08.411 --> 00:28:11.020
chance and I'm sure everybody's going to say all they stole this from you.

483
00:28:11.021 --> 00:28:14.110
They stole this from this guy and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
I don't fucking know.

484
00:28:14.111 --> 00:28:15.250
But it was making me laugh.

485
00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:20.710
You don't want anyone to introduce in the UNC players,
I'll just use my name.

486
00:28:20.711 --> 00:28:21.540
They just say,
yeah,

487
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:25.960
play in fucking point guide number fucking zero bill burr.

488
00:28:25.961 --> 00:28:30.610
And then the whole student section just goes,
hi bill,
you suck.

489
00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.120
And they just did it through the whole thing.
It was childish.

490
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:38.470
It was fucking hilarious.
They started chanting.

491
00:28:38.471 --> 00:28:41.770
I couldn't tell what they were chanting,
and then I gradually figured it out.

492
00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:46.720
It was crazy towel guy.
I was like,
crazy.
What the fuck are they saying?
Crazy?

493
00:28:46.721 --> 00:28:50.430
What?
And people start turning around looking at us,
and then I realized,

494
00:28:50.431 --> 00:28:51.131
I look and be honest,

495
00:28:51.131 --> 00:28:53.560
and we look up and all of a sudden this fucking old guy gets up,

496
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:57.320
starts whipping this towel around his head,
this old fucking lunatic.
I'm like,
oh,

497
00:28:57.321 --> 00:29:00.550
I guess that's,
I guess that's the crazy towel guy,

498
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:02.083
<v 2>right?</v>

499
00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.120
<v 1>So it's going back and forth,
back and forth,
all these crazy chance.</v>

500
00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:09.550
You let your whole team down all of this shit.
The next scene,
oh,

501
00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.870
it's like halftime.
We're sitting there going like,
dude,
what the fuck was that?

502
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.660
That was 20 minutes of basketball.
They felt like a minute.

503
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:18.810
My ears were ringing.

504
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:21.630
Like I'd gone to a concert and there's still another half to play.

505
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.150
Then all of a sudden this Asian lady comes out,

506
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:29.270
this Asian lady coming out on like a fucking three story unicycle and she's

507
00:29:31.051 --> 00:29:35.790
doing that act where you,
you're fucking,
you flip the saucer Rania head.

508
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:40.380
Okay.
Which I had seen before.
I've seen the act done before.
I never seen it live,

509
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:44.440
but was fucking hilarious.
Versie and bar nick had never seen that,

510
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.820
that saying I wasn't blown away.
I was definitely blown away.
So she,

511
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.970
she goes to like flip it on.
I had no,
first of all,

512
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.520
you know when you stop on a Unicycle,
he can't just stop.

513
00:29:54.521 --> 00:29:57.030
You've got to do that front,
back,
front,
back,
front,
back to,

514
00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.950
and now she's doing that with one foot on the fucking pedal.

515
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:04.330
She's got a God damn soup bowl on one of our,

516
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.790
the end of our feet on her toes.
You under your feet.

517
00:30:06.791 --> 00:30:10.870
A lot of people notice your toes,
right?
So everybody's sitting there,
right?

518
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.520
She fucking flips it.

519
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:15.870
It does like a triple Lindy and lands on the top of her head and everybody,

520
00:30:15.871 --> 00:30:18.190
everybody's just like,
ah,
Shit.
Right.

521
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.980
So then she fucking what?
The thing's still on her fucking head.

522
00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:27.640
A little soup kitchen.
A Cup,
dare,
right.
She rides down to another,

523
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:31.660
the other corner of the basketball court.
Now she puts two down.
Now.

524
00:30:31.661 --> 00:30:36.470
First he starts going,
no way,
no fucking way.
No fuck away air right there,
Fred.

525
00:30:36.471 --> 00:30:39.820
It fucking lands whole crowd.
Oh Shit.

526
00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:44.050
Then she goes to do three,
so she's got one upright.

527
00:30:44.051 --> 00:30:45.790
The others upside down the other is upright,

528
00:30:45.791 --> 00:30:50.791
just going like right up her fucking Shin and she fucking landed that in forsee

529
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.090
stood up.

530
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.440
You ever see what black people go to church and when they call it catching the

531
00:30:56.441 --> 00:30:59.140
holy ghost,
that's what looked like happened to Paul Versey.

532
00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.350
Everybody was sitting down first.
He stood up and applauded.

533
00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:11.320
I'm fucking dying laughing.
She goes to four balls.
Everybody's like,

534
00:31:11.321 --> 00:31:16.060
no shit.
Four balls go on the air.
Land right on the head.
One,

535
00:31:16.061 --> 00:31:20.670
two,
three,
four,
whole crop,
right?

536
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:25.810
Then she goes down,
her closing bit,
not one,

537
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.580
not two,
not three or four.

538
00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.510
She puts five fucking soup bowls.

539
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:34.960
It's all the way up to her knee.
Okay.
Oh,
I forgot to tell you this.

540
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:36.850
This guy is like flipping the balls.

541
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:41.940
So he flipped one tour and he fucking threw a too short and she dropped it and I

542
00:31:42.251 --> 00:31:45.730
was going,
I fucking just jinxed her.
He just fucked with their rhythm.

543
00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:48.220
It's like calling a timeout to ice the kicker.

544
00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:52.210
So she's got five flips him up in the fucking air.
One,
two,
three,

545
00:31:52.211 --> 00:31:55.630
four and the fifth one bounced off my head.
Everybody's like,
ah,

546
00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.830
ah Jeez.
There is no Santa Claus,
right?

547
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:05.140
You know what she said?
She said,
fuck that.
Set them up again.
Right?

548
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.580
Teaching these kids,

549
00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:11.530
these fucking millennials or whatever the fuck you call these kids nowadays,

550
00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:14.890
these kids who grew up with knee pads,
elbow pads and helmets,

551
00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:19.730
when they rode bicycles,
they had play dates.

552
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:20.820
They,

553
00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:24.680
they weren't left alone in the company of adults that no one really knew who

554
00:32:24.681 --> 00:32:26.720
they were.
These,
these kids were sheltered.

555
00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.310
They don't know how to make a comeback.
These kids get drunk.
They Call Uber,

556
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:34.740
right?
Everything's just set up for,

557
00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:39.710
so they don't know how to fucking pull themselves off the mat,
you know?
Well,

558
00:32:39.711 --> 00:32:42.710
let me tell you something.
This lady on this one fucking tired bicycle,

559
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:44.780
she showed them how cause she said,
hey,
fuck head,

560
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:49.730
I don't give a shit that you throw me five more.
She set him up again,
right.

561
00:32:49.731 --> 00:32:54.350
Flip them in the air.
Landed all five fucking place goes nuts.

562
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:58.970
Just as loud as the God damned.
Almost as loud as the fucking game.

563
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:02.510
There was no break.
There was no break in the excitement.

564
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:06.020
That fucking edge will look and go,
what the fuck did we just say?

565
00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:10.670
An outcomes coach,
k fucking Duke and UNC and it gets loud again.

566
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:16.460
More and more singing,
more fucking screaming
came all the way down.

567
00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:20.120
Duke finally put the game away with like a fucking minute left with a couple of

568
00:33:20.121 --> 00:33:21.590
foul shots.
And,
uh,

569
00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:25.240
I would just sat there in the last few seconds when I knew that Duke was going

570
00:33:25.241 --> 00:33:28.670
to win.
And I just looked at,
looked around,
looked at everything I could look at,

571
00:33:28.671 --> 00:33:31.940
try to make as enough mental pictures as I could to take it in,

572
00:33:31.941 --> 00:33:34.080
because I knew I was just like,
I don't know if I'll ever get back to,

573
00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:39.590
to seeing one of these again.
But,
um,
I dunno if that didn't sell you,

574
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.940
I'm fucking Gig.
You got to do it.
That is a dude.

575
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:48.740
Fuck Madison Square Garden.
It's a mecca.
Fuck that place.

576
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:52.100
You can go down there and see the fucking ice.
Capades save your money.

577
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:56.390
Go on stub hub.
All right.
Go on stub hub and,

578
00:33:56.391 --> 00:33:58.850
and just get yourself some tickets and go there.

579
00:33:58.851 --> 00:34:02.480
You will not be disappointed and you got to go.
Well,
coachK is still there.

580
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:03.590
Who by the way,

581
00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:04.880
<v 0>okay.</v>

582
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.850
<v 1>I believe tomorrow the 13th is his 70th birthday.</v>

583
00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:10.470
How great does that guy look?

584
00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

585
00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:16.440
<v 1>Fucking guy looks like he's like maybe a year younger,
two years older than me.</v>

586
00:34:16.441 --> 00:34:21.270
I don't know.
Um,
who would thought with,
uh,
with a,
uh,
a job that's stressful.

587
00:34:21.271 --> 00:34:25.290
You could still look that good,
you know?
Um,
anyways,

588
00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:30.160
let me read a little bit of advertising.
Here we go.
Oh,

589
00:34:30.161 --> 00:34:35.050
dollar shave club,
Everybody Dollar Shave Club.
All right.
You know something,

590
00:34:35.051 --> 00:34:38.650
there's no reason to use cheap disposable rate.

591
00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:43.120
Do you use it a cheap disposable razor or pay a ridiculously high price for some

592
00:34:43.121 --> 00:34:46.690
gimmicky thing that's got a laser pointer was 17 blades.

593
00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:51.640
Make this choice and join dollar shave club before dollar shave club.

594
00:34:51.910 --> 00:34:55.330
It was either save money and get a painful shave from a disposable,

595
00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:57.370
like the ones that give away for free at the gym,

596
00:34:57.371 --> 00:35:01.840
which felt like shaving with a piece of fucking glass or he paid a fortune for

597
00:35:01.841 --> 00:35:06.670
the latest gimmicky shave breakthrough that you didn't need that had like a

598
00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:09.550
fucking laser chin detector or 17 blades or whatever.

599
00:35:09.551 --> 00:35:11.530
Dollar Shave Club is the best of both worlds.

600
00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:16.060
Worlds a premium shade and a disposable price.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.860
Get a close,
smooth shave every time.

uh,
you can't,

602
00:35:20.861 --> 00:35:25.120

603
00:35:25.121 --> 00:35:27.970
dollar shave club yet,
you're missing out.

God,

604

Do you know where to post your job to find the best candidates?

You son of a bitch.

616
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:11.610
Posting your jobs in one place isn't enough to find high quality candidates.

617
00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.510
You might as well walk down the street and say,
hey buddy,

618
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:20.200
do you want a job?
No jogging.
Sorry.
Right?
You might as well do it that way.

619
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.470
That make any sense?
Probably didn't.

This is why I stick to the copy.

622
00:36:28.181 --> 00:36:31.960

<v 1>ruda.com/burr MVMT watches,
also known as movement,
watches.</v>

639
00:37:42.581 --> 00:37:43.510
Pronounced movement.

640
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:44.820
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

641
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.360
<v 1>Was founded on the belief that style shouldn't break the bank with the 1 million</v>

642
00:37:48.361 --> 00:37:51.870
watches sold the customers in 160 countries around the fucking world.

643
00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:55.940
Movement watches has solidified itself as one of the fastest growing watch

644
00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.740
companies.
And let me tell you,
the owners of this company,

645
00:37:58.741 --> 00:38:03.410
while they're personalize,
have suffered broken marriages,
broken dreams,

646
00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.870
but God dammit,
they're getting you these fucking watches.
Um,

647
00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:11.560
the company started by two broke college kids.
They didn't have any money.

648
00:38:11.561 --> 00:38:15.160
And then somehow they started a company.
I've never understood that detail,
uh,

649
00:38:15.161 --> 00:38:17.740
wanted to wear stylish watches,
but they couldn't afford it.

650
00:38:17.741 --> 00:38:19.270
So they started their own watch company.

651
00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.660
This definitely sounds like an ivy league.
Thank you know,

652
00:38:22.661 --> 00:38:24.850
when I didn't have a fucking watch and I didn't have any money,

653
00:38:24.851 --> 00:38:28.120
I just didn't wear a watch.
I didn't start a fucking watch company.

654
00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.860
These Kennedy's how was,
okay,

655
00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.200
how is this like how you started build a fall?
Shut up movement.

656
00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:37.900
Watches start at $95 a department store at a department store,

657
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.620
you're looking at four to 500 bucks,
move and watches,
okay?
Basically,

658
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:44.470
they got a great watch.
It's not in a department store,

659
00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:47.620
so they can cut out all his fucking money and all these.
They start at 95 bucks.

660
00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:50.760
The great people won't know that there's a piece of shit.
You know?

661
00:38:50.761 --> 00:38:53.410
It's not a piece of shit,
but they won't know that.
It's not like I'm fucking,

662
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:57.760
you know,
how do we get out of this?
It's a nice watch.
All right?

663
00:38:57.761 --> 00:39:00.480
But it doesn't cost a lot of money,
okay?

698
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:12.290
All right,
and with that,
you know there's this thing,

699
00:41:12.291 --> 00:41:14.180
it's just really not responding the way it used to.

700
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.690
Is it time for a new laptop?
All right.

701
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:23.420
Do we have anything else?
Hey,
what is all this attacking on fake news lately?

702
00:41:23.421 --> 00:41:27.440
I don't understand it.
Why is the government getting so mad at fake news?

703
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:32.390
It's so fucking hilarious watching them getting up,
getting upset about that.
Hey,

704
00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:37.340
don't read their fake news.
Read our fake news.
Read our version of the fucking,

705
00:41:37.341 --> 00:41:41.720
it's all fake fucking news.
Have you ever gotten into a car accident?

706
00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:46.460
Little fender bender and the cop shows up.
Are you a police officer?

707
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:49.280
Have you ever heard two people tell you the exact same story?

708
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.450
This fucking guy came out of fucking nowhere.
Then you go over the other guy.

709
00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.810
What happened?
I came out of fucking nowhere.
I wasn't even looking.

710
00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:02.750
Never happens.
It's all fake news.
It's,
it's all opinions,

711
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:07.110
right?
For the most part.
Other than,
you know,
if somebody dies,

712
00:42:07.111 --> 00:42:11.550
this guy is fucking dead.
Okay.
You can agree on that.
How he died.

713
00:42:11.551 --> 00:42:15.930
Why died?
Who's,
who's responsible?
Oh,
Jesus Christ belt.
We get it.
Okay.

714
00:42:15.931 --> 00:42:19.820
That's all I'm saying.
That's all.
That's all I'm really saying.
All right,

715
00:42:19.821 --> 00:42:24.080
let's get to,
well,
let's get to the content here.
Um,
the read some,
uh,

716
00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:26.080
some of your letters here.
Alright,

717
00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:31.120
Yoko Ono makes Julian Lennon by letters he wrote to his dad at auction.

718
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:37.010
All right,
Bill,
is there a worst woman in history?
I hate to be happy.

719
00:42:37.011 --> 00:42:41.780
I know the Beatles days were numbered.
It wasn't just her,
but it didn't help.

720
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:47.710
Yeah.
But at the end of the day,
John Shows her,
this is what happened.

721
00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:52.990
Something happened between John and his mom and she died,
or she fucking,
I dunno,

722
00:42:52.991 --> 00:42:57.520
she beat him with a wooden spoon.
I forget how the fucking story went.
All right.

723
00:42:57.521 --> 00:43:00.970
But whatever she did or if she died,
it's not her fault.

724
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:06.870
It left him with the psychological makeup to be susceptible to not trying to

725
00:43:08.201 --> 00:43:10.480
just find a mate.
He also wanted a mom.

726
00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:11.840
<v 0>Okay.</v>

727
00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.570
<v 1>And all she had to do was make some cookies.
All right.</v>

728
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:20.900
Make him some cookies on his fucking birthday,
whatever the fuck he wanted.

729
00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:24.860
And then that was it.
This guy was done,
you know,

730
00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:29.810
I think he would eat all if he lived they somewhere in his mid forties he just

731
00:43:29.811 --> 00:43:34.140
would have been like,
all right.
You know what?
What the fuck was that?

732
00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:36.650
Maybe you would've got out.
Maybe.
Maybe he liked it.
I have no idea.
But anyway,

733
00:43:36.651 --> 00:43:39.690
so let's continue.
He said,
then there's the video.

734
00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:41.230
<v 0>Okay.</v>

735
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:44.690
<v 1>Will you call her out for screeching like a maniac during a powerful moment in</v>

736
00:43:44.691 --> 00:43:45.190
history.

737
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:50.190
Now she won't give her husband's son some paper he gave his dad 20 years

738
00:43:50.291 --> 00:43:53.500
earlier.
This story might be a bit old,
but it doesn't seem to make,

739
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:57.980
but it doesn't make it any less true.
I watched the clip,
what it is,

740
00:43:57.981 --> 00:44:02.540
what she auctioned off a bunch of his shit
is what it is.

741
00:44:02.541 --> 00:44:07.070
She's not making him pay for it.
She sold it and Julian wants to get it back.

742
00:44:07.071 --> 00:44:10.820
But because Yoko sold it,
um,

743
00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:17.110
he has to buy it back now I in defensive for what I would say is the cash cow

744
00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:22.200
died.
It's not like Yoko could go out and fucking sell,

745
00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:27.360
take a records like a beetle.
So all of a sudden she's gone like,
Holy Fuck,

746
00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:30.540
how am I still going to be able to live in the,
in the Dakota?

747
00:44:30.541 --> 00:44:35.130
So she selling all his shit or maybe her husband died.

748
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:39.210
She wanted a fucking move on and didn't want to look at all his old shit.

749
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.073
You know what I mean?

750
00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:41.390
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

751
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:45.710
<v 1>I have no idea.
Um,
but yeah,
I watched a little of that video.</v>

752
00:44:45.711 --> 00:44:50.000
Julian definitely goes hard on our end,
says,
uh,
that you think,
see,

753
00:44:50.001 --> 00:44:53.060
she's extremely manipulative and that,
um,

754
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.410
she knew what the fuck she was doing from day one and I can't remember did

755
00:44:58.411 --> 00:45:03.190
that's actually his mother.
I Dunno.
How is he related that you,

756
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.610
who the fuck knows?
I don't know.
Um,

757
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:07.060
<v 0>okay.</v>

758
00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:09.520
<v 1>Is there a worst woman in history?
Yeah,
there's way worse women,</v>

759
00:45:09.521 --> 00:45:13.300
those women that ran empires and had people killed,
you know,

760
00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:18.620
for whatever fucking reason.
You know,
the,
the,
the story of scar face.

761
00:45:18.621 --> 00:45:21.530
The second one,
the one that Pachino did was based

762
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.580
on a,
a,
you know,
there was the original movie,

763
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:30.110
but the stories that they used in,
in the,
the second one,

764
00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:31.461
uh,

765
00:45:31.461 --> 00:45:36.461
we're based on a drug dealer of that time who actually was a woman.

766
00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:41.090
So,
I mean,
yeah,
I would say if she was worse,
you know,

767
00:45:41.091 --> 00:45:45.100
having people shot in the fucking street is probably worse than a sell on some

768
00:45:45.101 --> 00:45:49.780
postcards.
But you know,
it's all up to interpretation.
You know,

769
00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.910
this is the new me,
the new meditating bill,

770
00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:56.940
the mood more relaxed bill who's undoing the fucking knots of anxiety in his

771
00:45:58.301 --> 00:46:01.570
mind?
I cannot say enough about the fucking meditating.

772
00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.473
<v 5>MMM.</v>

773
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.060
<v 1>Now that I'm not trying to like get good at it,
I'm just trying to do it.</v>

774
00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:09.720
<v 5>MMM.</v>

775
00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:14.880
<v 1>I don't flip out to the level I used to like I think,
you know,</v>

776
00:46:14.881 --> 00:46:19.470
say like 10 is the worst flipping out.
I think I used to walk around,

777
00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.260
just walk around on a good day.

778
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:26.970
I was already at a six compared to how most people are when they're just like

779
00:46:26.971 --> 00:46:28.020
totally chill it out.

780
00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:32.340
So it was a very quick and easy trip up to 10.

781
00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:37.350
Now I feel like I walk around it like a three.
I feel like I've cut it in half.

782
00:46:37.351 --> 00:46:39.450
So now when I flip out,
I kind of just go to six,

783
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:43.470
which is still totally unacceptable for most social situations.

784
00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.160
I still flip out and people look over their shoulders startled,

785
00:46:47.161 --> 00:46:51.330
but not with the level of,
of what the fuck.

786
00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:56.400
You know what I mean?
It reminds you this time I saw

787
00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:01.830
I was on like highway eight or something interstate eight,

788
00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:05.560
I think it was in Arizona and New Mexico.

789
00:47:05.561 --> 00:47:09.310
I know where the fuck was that and this bull,
it's somehow

790
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:12.810
gotten free.
I mean I was in the middle of fucking nowhere.

791
00:47:12.811 --> 00:47:17.811
I was and there was two cowboys right on horses and these are cowboys.

792
00:47:18.511 --> 00:47:20.850
They're trying to fucking rope a God damn bull,

793
00:47:20.851 --> 00:47:22.890
which I didn't know if he could do,
I don't what the fuck they were doing.

794
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:27.390
So one of them is trying to distract the bull is the other one is on a horse

795
00:47:27.391 --> 00:47:28.920
that is sneaking up behind it and,

796
00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:33.910
and the horse is sneaking up the way horses sneak up in a fucking cartoon and

797
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:37.270
this bull at the last second figured it out and he fucking turned around.

798
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.420
You know that look Bruce Willis always does when he looks over his shoulder and

799
00:47:40.421 --> 00:47:43.990
die hard.
It's the same thing except it was a fucking bull.

800
00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:47.950
That's the look that people,
when I would lose my shit prior to meditate,

801
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:53.200
I would get that look.
Everyone would fucking turn around.
Like,
you know,

802
00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:58.630
the skyscraper was on fire and it was just some fucking balding redhead flipping

803
00:47:58.631 --> 00:48:01.300
out because he couldn't figure out the new operating system on his,

804
00:48:01.301 --> 00:48:06.250
on his smartphone.
Completely unacceptable.
So,

805
00:48:06.251 --> 00:48:10.840
uh,
my temper is,
has really reduced and um,

806
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.630
I'm telling you if I can just not fucking do,
I just made the statement out loud.

807
00:48:15.631 --> 00:48:19.120
It's like my daughter's not going to see me flipping out,
you know,

808
00:48:19.121 --> 00:48:21.490
I'm not saying I want every way.
Hey,
hey,
hey,
hey.
Hey.
Hey.
What?

809
00:48:21.491 --> 00:48:24.610
She's fucking drawn on the wall at some point,
but uh,

810
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:27.370
she's not going to see me yelling at computers.
It's just not going to happen.

811
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:31.390
Okay.
And I say it out loud.
When I say it out loud,
that means it happens.
Right?

812
00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:32.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

813
00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:35.750
<v 1>I hope somebody with,
I'm trying,
fuck you guys.
I'm trying.</v>

814
00:48:35.751 --> 00:48:37.580
Anytime I talk about this too of my standup back,

815
00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:40.670
then I'm going to try to fix my temper.
People just start laughing.

816
00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:45.180
They laugh and they point and they make me feel bad.
Um,
all right.

817
00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:50.450
Italy and the European Union pay their Capitol Hill Bill.

818
00:48:50.451 --> 00:48:52.400
I'm just a bill.
Yes.

819
00:48:52.401 --> 00:48:57.401
I'm only a bill and I'm sitting here on Capital Hill and okay.

820
00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:02.300
I'm a political science professor from a school I won't name to keep with your

821
00:49:02.301 --> 00:49:07.280
policy of not naming names.
Uh,
having studied and taught the subject,

822
00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:12.230
it's fair to say I look at what goes on today from a much wider scope.

823
00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:17.240
A wider scope than who?
Me.
I would hope so.
I would hope so wider than me.

824
00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:18.950
Um,
all right.

825
00:49:18.951 --> 00:49:22.910
And that's not something that is only exclusive to receiving a master's in

826
00:49:22.911 --> 00:49:26.690
political science.
Could you pat yourself on the back anymore,
sir?

827
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:32.530
Did you elbow patch fly off you fucking left arm of your sport coat when you

828
00:49:33.501 --> 00:49:36.980
reach back to that is all,

829
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:41.540
I love this guy and that's not always something that is only exclusive to

830
00:49:41.541 --> 00:49:44.360
receiving a master's in political science.

831
00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:49.220
Sky should be wearing a scarf with a nice breeze going.
Anyone can read

832
00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:51.790
Solzhenitsyn.

833
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:56.590
Thank you for fucking sound spelling that for me and others who have honestly

834
00:49:56.591 --> 00:50:00.640
captured an important perspective of history and have a much clearer

835
00:50:00.641 --> 00:50:04.390
understanding of how and why governments and social lights have evolved through

836
00:50:04.391 --> 00:50:07.040
history.
Anyways,

837
00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:10.250
there was one thing that has flown under the radar now that I've gotten my

838
00:50:10.251 --> 00:50:11.300
resume out of the way,

839
00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:16.330
there's one thing has flown under the radar and I think it should scare the shit

840
00:50:17.091 --> 00:50:20.300
out of most European countries.
All right.

841
00:50:20.301 --> 00:50:24.590
Let me start by saying in short that the European Union parentheses,

842
00:50:24.591 --> 00:50:28.420
which in my opinion is run by fascist self interest.

843
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:32.780
Can I just stop here and say this is the most well-written fucking email I've

844
00:50:32.781 --> 00:50:37.050
ever received on the podcast.
This is incredible.

845
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:40.590
Um,
let me start by saying it's short to the European Union,

846
00:50:40.591 --> 00:50:43.100
which my opinion is run by fascist with interest,

847
00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:47.640
tried to take control of Italy's army for the sake of your time.

848
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:49.320
I will spoil the ending.

849
00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:54.890
Italy did not vote to allow the EU to take over that move by the EU.

850
00:50:55.291 --> 00:50:56.070
Alarmed.

851
00:50:56.070 --> 00:51:01.070
Some of my peers who I in 20 plus years of knowing them have not seen them

852
00:51:02.011 --> 00:51:05.640
alarmed by anything in terms of government in the scheme of things,

853
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:06.990
a banking institution,

854
00:51:06.991 --> 00:51:11.991
openly financing legislation that is trying to gain control of a foreign

855
00:51:12.661 --> 00:51:17.370
countries,
foreign governments.
Military is for the lack of a better term,
really,

856
00:51:17.371 --> 00:51:21.510
really ballsy.
Why do I feel like I missed some information here?

857
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:28.030
Okay,
so the the European Union tried to take over Italy's army.
Okay.

858
00:51:28.031 --> 00:51:33.031
I see that Italy did not vote to allow the EU to take over.

859
00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:37.250
So when you joined the uh,

860
00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:38.740
<v 0>okay.</v>

861
00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:43.630
<v 1>European Union,
they took take over your army,
is that what you're saying?
Okay,</v>

862
00:51:43.631 --> 00:51:47.590
so that move by the EU alarm.
Some of my peers.

863
00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:53.190
What move.
Oh,
trying to take over the,
okay,

864
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:55.710
but you're jumping back and forth here.
I can't tell what you're talking about.

865
00:51:55.711 --> 00:51:57.510
K to take control of Italy's army case.

866
00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:01.050
So I'm trying to take control of their army.
Yeah.
How would you do that?

867
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:04.980
Okay.
The idea that,
let me just finish this.

868
00:52:04.981 --> 00:52:09.000
The idea that certain globalist groups are trying to take control of the world

869
00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:14.360
is not an incredible idea among people who are versed in political economics or

870
00:52:14.461 --> 00:52:16.380
conspiracy theorists like myself,

871
00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:20.300
but you know something me,
they just go,
oh,

872
00:52:20.301 --> 00:52:24.660
where do you get your fucking 10 hat on?
And a you,

873
00:52:24.661 --> 00:52:26.700
if you just started saying what the fuck you just said,

874
00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:28.710
you'd probably run into the same problem like you just,

875
00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:32.520
I just said it was the best written email ever and I got lost in it because I'm

876
00:52:32.521 --> 00:52:36.450
too fucking stupid.
I understand what you're talking about,
so it's gotta be hard,

877
00:52:36.451 --> 00:52:39.300
man.
You just got to hang out with people with the fucking elbow patches on their

878
00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:40.560
sport coats,
right?

879
00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:41.830
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

880
00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:42.663
<v 1>Anyways,</v>

881
00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.580
the idea that certain globalist groups are trying to take control of the world

882
00:52:45.581 --> 00:52:48.820
is not an incredible idea among people who are versed in political economics.

883
00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:53.890
I've heard you talk about stuff like this in the context of a conspiracy and so

884
00:52:53.891 --> 00:52:58.360
other than this possibly possibly being interesting to you,
it's also too,

885
00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:01.210
it's also affirm that you are not out of your mind.

886
00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:04.180
I attached an article if you'd like to read further,

887
00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:07.180
I absolutely would look at this.
How about dad?
Everybody all,

888
00:53:07.181 --> 00:53:10.630
you can't say that I got a 10 add on tin foil hat on.

889
00:53:10.631 --> 00:53:11.860
Whatever the fuck that means.

890
00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:14.170
Half of you say that you don't even know what it means.

891
00:53:14.171 --> 00:53:19.000
You didn't get your tinfoil hat on.
You know,
I don't know what the fuck it means.

892
00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.960
Is that,
is that like my antenna?
If I'm doing some sort of pirate radio,

893
00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:28.180
tin foil hat meaning I know what it means.

894
00:53:28.181 --> 00:53:30.300
It means you're out of your fucking mind.
But how did it come about?

895
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:33.720
A tin foil hat is made from one or more sheets of aluminum foil.

896
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:39.230
I didn't want the exact or a piece of conventional head gear lined with foil

897
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:43.200
worn in the belief or hope that it shields the brain from threats such as

898
00:53:43.201 --> 00:53:47.310
electromagnetic fields,
mine control in mind.
Oh,
I see.

899
00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:51.930
I see.
Well,
you know,
that's some macgyver shit.

900
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:53.640
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

901
00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:57.630
<v 1>I can go with that.
Right.
Is that a bad thing?
Anyway,</v>

902
00:53:57.631 --> 00:53:58.650
so what were the fuck was it?

903
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:01.403
<v 5>MMM,</v>

904
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:05.060
<v 1>I've attached.
I,
I wouldn't,
I would actually,
it's a to,
how long is this?
So,</v>

905
00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:07.850
so something I can read,
you know,

906
00:54:07.851 --> 00:54:10.400
I'll read about this and I'll give you my uninformed opinion,

907
00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:14.810
my Moronica opinion on the next podcast.
How about that?
Does that work for you?

908
00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.300
Does that grab you?
Um,
all right.

909
00:54:17.301 --> 00:54:21.140
Fat guys turns out to not be fat.

910
00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:25.140
Billy twinkle bows.
This guy told,

911
00:54:25.141 --> 00:54:27.770
I was told by a doctor his whole life that he was fat.

912
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:32.990
He had this huge frontal thing on going on that turned out to not be a giant

913
00:54:32.991 --> 00:54:37.220
belly,
but 130 pound tumor.
How many people do you know?

914
00:54:37.221 --> 00:54:39.260
We'll start using the tumor defense.

915
00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:41.163
<v 5>MMM.</v>

916
00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:46.280
<v 1>I actually looked this fucking thing up.
The guy is fat.
He's very fat.</v>

917
00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:47.810
Even after the fucking tumor.

918
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:53.120
I mean like he's laying in bed.

919
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:57.050
Any has,
it's like he has an inner tube of fat going around.

920
00:54:57.051 --> 00:54:58.340
I think like that's what his neck is.

921
00:54:59.230 --> 00:54:59.920
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

922
00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:03.270
<v 1>This guy is so fucking fat.
He had 130 pound to Marnie.</v>

923
00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.970
Just thought it was part of his love handle.
He is fat.

924
00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.720
Um,
I'm glad they got it out of there.
Jeez.
How do you,

925
00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:14.170
how do you get that out of their hundred and 30 pounds?

926
00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:18.130
How the fuck Dee?
I mean,
you've got to take it out in sections

927
00:55:20.810 --> 00:55:25.730
10 pounds at a time.
You need to make 13 fucking incisions,
Jesus Christ,

928
00:55:25.731 --> 00:55:29.540
and just thrown it over your shoulder,
hitting the ground like a fucking bowling

929
00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:36.340
Jesus Christ.
Do you know I knew a guy

930
00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:38.900
<v 5>dead.
Um,</v>

931
00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:39.901
<v 1>you know,</v>

932
00:55:39.901 --> 00:55:43.830
everybody's talking about probiotics and they talk about the bacteria in your

933
00:55:43.831 --> 00:55:48.720
gut that know there's bacteria in your gut that's supposed to be there.

934
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:51.360
They try to scare the shit out of you,
but it's supposed to be there.

935
00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.160
It's there for when you die in,

936
00:55:53.161 --> 00:55:57.840
it begins to decomposing process provided you're not full of fucking

937
00:55:57.841 --> 00:56:02.670
preservatives and you just decompose because you not important and you just

938
00:56:02.671 --> 00:56:04.020
become part of the earth again.

939
00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:08.640
But we stick ups ourselves in these fancy fucking boxes because we think we're

940
00:56:08.641 --> 00:56:12.780
too good to be warm food for whatever fucking reason.
But anyways,
um,

941
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:16.910
alcohol
eats away at the good shit,

942
00:56:16.911 --> 00:56:18.890
the good bacteria that you need while you're alive.

943
00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:22.310
Like you supposed to be balanced and you're supposed to have more of the good

944
00:56:22.311 --> 00:56:25.000
bacteria.
Cause if you have more of the bad bacteria,

945
00:56:25.001 --> 00:56:27.040
you can actually enter your own fucking way.

946
00:56:27.041 --> 00:56:30.910
You're beginning to decompose while you still alive or in a short way you

947
00:56:30.911 --> 00:56:32.950
starting to die.
This is the way this guy explained it to me.

948
00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:35.320
So he started getting a distended belly.

949
00:56:35.321 --> 00:56:37.810
They didn't know what the fuck was going on and he wouldn't go to the doctor.

950
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:39.430
And then finally you found out,
you know,

951
00:56:39.431 --> 00:56:42.220
somebody said maybe you got to tape worn and that freaked him the fuck out.

952
00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.200
They could have been something alive in them.

953
00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:47.470
And he went to the doctor and then they found out that that's what it was.

954
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:51.340
And uh,
they gave him some medicine and you know,

955
00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:56.530
Eddie Ed to shit it all out.
That's basically what happened.
So,
um,
I dunno,

956
00:56:56.950 --> 00:57:00.670
even then,
I always buy the Greek yogurt and it goes bad.
I,
we think like eight,

957
00:57:00.671 --> 00:57:04.000
I'll slam a couple of scotches and the next morning I have two spoonfuls of

958
00:57:04.001 --> 00:57:05.920
fucking Greek yogurt.
You're going to,
I'll be fine.

959
00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:10.570
I was happy in the life insurance.
They sit down in a nice fucking easy,
you know,

960
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:14.230
heart rhythm.
That was also meditating when they did it.
You know,

961
00:57:14.231 --> 00:57:16.600
I was being totally present.
I was listening to the sounds of the room.

962
00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:20.890
I slowed my breathing.
I trick those fuckers.

963
00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:23.950
But I also had the Bruins game on in the background so I was trying not to react

964
00:57:23.951 --> 00:57:27.400
to what the fuck was going on cause we left this fucking country goal at the end

965
00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:30.130
of the second period with one second left.
All right.

966
00:57:30.131 --> 00:57:34.900
Crazy Saddam story.
Crazy.
All right.

967
00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:39.340
Hey Bill thought I brighten your day with this crazy account of what went down

968
00:57:39.341 --> 00:57:41.260
in Iraq when Saddam took power,

969
00:57:41.590 --> 00:57:44.590
basically the gathered all government officials in one room,

970
00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:49.060
the current military leader gets brought out on stage.
He clearly,

971
00:57:49.061 --> 00:57:53.410
he's clearly been beaten,
he admits to having committed treason,

972
00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:57.760
but clearly he hasn't.
They then start calling out officials one at a time,

973
00:57:57.761 --> 00:58:02.320
so everyone was scared shitless that they'd be called out and marched out into a

974
00:58:02.321 --> 00:58:06.100
courtyard with the others.
Then after half of them were gone,

975
00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:10.840
the remaining officials were all taken out to the courtyard and told that if

976
00:58:10.841 --> 00:58:13.390
they didn't shoot the traders,

977
00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:14.970
<v 2>okay.</v>

978
00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:16.980
<v 1>They and their families would be killed.</v>

979
00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:21.060
That way they all had blood on their hands.
Insane.

980
00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:26.690
Here's the whole account and to thank the u s still did business with sit down

981
00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:30.330
with them after that.
Ha Ha Dude.
As far as I know,

982
00:58:30.331 --> 00:58:32.130
we kind of put that guy in over there,

983
00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:34.573
<v 2>you know,</v>

984
00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:36.631
<v 1>it,</v>

985
00:58:36.631 --> 00:58:41.490
and we were cool with the guy until he fucking tried to go around us and start

986
00:58:41.491 --> 00:58:45.000
selling oil to other,
I don't know what the fuck he did.
We,
you know,

987
00:58:46.290 --> 00:58:46.700
<v 2>okay.</v>

988
00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:50.090
<v 1>You know what I mean?
Saddam Hussein to the United States.</v>

989
00:58:50.091 --> 00:58:54.420
He was like one of those fucking,
a first round draft choices that,
that's a bus.

990
00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:58.190
He was a bust for us,
you know,
in a very promising college career.

991
00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:00.620
And uh,
you know,
he just,

992
00:59:00.621 --> 00:59:03.500
he just didn't have the passion and actually he was a very passionate guy.

993
00:59:03.501 --> 00:59:07.280
He just wasn't passionate in the wrong,
I don't know who the fuck knows.

994
00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:11.420
I mean it's all evil shit.
That shit is just like,

995
00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:13.213
<v 2>mmm.</v>

996
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:17.800
<v 1>The most base level evil cause then I even trying to hide it,</v>

997
00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:20.920
but I got to tell you when Trump was talking to that fucking guy there,

998
00:59:20.921 --> 00:59:22.010
I'm from Fox News,

999
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:26.770
Bill O'reilly and Bill O'reilly's give him shit that he was friends with Putnam

1000
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:28.880
putting in or whatever his fucking name was.
And he goes,

1001
00:59:28.881 --> 00:59:33.710
the guys that he's a killer to have a fucking standing president go,

1002
00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.150
well look at this country.

1003
00:59:35.151 --> 00:59:39.190
Look [inaudible] we've done my jaw hit the fucking ground,
Mike.

1004
00:59:39.191 --> 00:59:41.930
Is he actually going to say this?
You can't say this.
Everybody knows it's true.

1005
00:59:41.931 --> 00:59:45.050
But you can't fucking say this now.

1006
00:59:45.051 --> 00:59:48.830
We only kill the bad evil the fuck out of here.

1007
00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:52.550
It's all fucking evil.
And that goes back to that fake news.

1008
00:59:52.551 --> 00:59:55.580
That's why they need to take control of the fake news so they can spin it.

1009
00:59:56.090 --> 00:59:58.790
You know what I mean?
The Guy,
he came out of fucking nowhere.

1010
00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:04.820
This Saddam Hussein,
where we had a green light,
he came out of fucking nowhere.

1011
01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:09.020
Everybody does it.
Everybody does it.
You know what?
And I fucking do it too.

1012
01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.370
We're all spinning it.
We're all spinning our own horse shit.

1013
01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:16.190
We all think we're fine.
I'm not going to speak for you guys,

1014
01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:17.870
but I'm spinning my own bullshit,
right?

1015
01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:22.640
This is my favorite video anybody's sent me in a long fucking time.
I'm,
oh,

1016
01:00:22.641 --> 01:00:25.310
by the way,
if you want to watch that sit down thing,
uh,
I'll,

1017
01:00:25.311 --> 01:00:28.730
I'll post all these videos.
I don't know if I want to watch it.
That stuff.

1018
01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.620
I Dunno.
I don't like watching shit like that.

1019
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:32.303
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1020
01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:36.100
<v 1>All right.
109 year old guy smoked cigars and drinks whiskey.</v>

1021
01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:41.230
Dear Billy deer farm state bill,
I know you have a life insurance policy tests,

1022
01:00:41.231 --> 01:00:44.420
but I thought you might want to see this is 109 year old guy.

1023
01:00:44.421 --> 01:00:47.140
Smoked cigars all day.
Not Saying it's great for everyone,

1024
01:00:47.141 --> 01:00:51.490
but figured you'd want to hear the title actually marginalized this guy's life.

1025
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.130
He's got a great attitude.
He still drives.

1026
01:00:54.131 --> 01:00:58.120
He's the oldest living World War II veteran.
You'd really enjoy this.

1027
01:00:58.121 --> 01:01:02.650
He talks about having a truck for a long time and they show his old school TV

1028
01:01:02.651 --> 01:01:06.280
with the giant dials.
He keeps it all cause it works and he likes it.

1029
01:01:06.281 --> 01:01:08.470
Come to Boston.
I fucking love this guy.

1030
01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:14.380
He said at one point he smokes 12 cigars a day.
He goes,
I don't inhale.

1031
01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:17.980
So inhale,
he goes,
you get in trouble.
The bottom line is,
you know,

1032
01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.280
whatever's genetics are,
this works for him because I know if I smoked 12 a day,

1033
01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:24.850
I have,
first of all,
I couldn't physically fucking do it,
but he,

1034
01:01:24.851 --> 01:01:28.780
and it's like a 79 looks like a 78 or 79 Ford pickup truck.

1035
01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:33.400
He had an old square TV that's still had the legs on it from like the 70s.

1036
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:35.240
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1037
01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:39.140
<v 1>The built his house in like 1940.
He still lives there.
He said,</v>

1038
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:42.830
I liked the shit that I have.
It's still works.
So I'm not buying more shit.

1039
01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.090
It's like,
what I'm trying to do now,
get rid of all this extra shit that I bought

1040
01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:48.763
<v 5>and um,</v>

1041
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.841
<v 1>I've got to tell you,</v>

1042
01:01:50.841 --> 01:01:55.841
watching this guy watching his life is the life that I'm slowly moving towards.

1043
01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.700
It's the life that I want.

1044
01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:00.543
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1045
01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:04.420
<v 1>After running around like a fucking lunatic,</v>

1046
01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:08.440
reacting to everything for the first fucking,
you know,

1047
01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.440
40 something years of my life.

1048
01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:13.563
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1049
01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:19.830
<v 1>You know,
I would like to slow down a little bit is far as being an,
I mean,</v>

1050
01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:21.960
look,
I'm still,
I know all you guys are worried.
I got God,

1051
01:02:21.961 --> 01:02:23.820
he's going to slow down.
He's not going to be fucking fun.

1052
01:02:23.821 --> 01:02:27.750
I'm still going to completely fuck up.
Still going to do dumb shit.

1053
01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.191
I'm going to be fine,

1054
01:02:29.191 --> 01:02:32.310
but I don't have to be walking or I basically walked around,

1055
01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:38.060
stuck in fight or flight mode probably from the age of eight till now.

1056
01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:44.000
And um,
I dunno,

1057
01:02:44.001 --> 01:02:46.850
it's a stupid west starts.
It's funny to observe,

1058
01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:50.990
but it really wears on the people around you and eventually it fucking wears you

1059
01:02:50.991 --> 01:02:51.411
down.

1060
01:02:51.411 --> 01:02:56.411
And it's just like the amount of fucking time that I have wasted arguing with

1061
01:02:56.751 --> 01:02:58.790
people where they're not going to change their mind.

1062
01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:02.360
I'm not going to change my mind.
I've just,
I,
I've,
uh,

1063
01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:06.650
I've done a pass that point my fucking life and it feels fucking great.

1064
01:03:07.310 --> 01:03:08.870
I just have to believe that I am.

1065
01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:10.533
<v 2>MMM.</v>

1066
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:13.860
<v 1>I'm trying to do now when I flip up,</v>

1067
01:03:13.861 --> 01:03:16.440
cause I know there's other angry constant listen to this and you listen to this

1068
01:03:16.441 --> 01:03:18.930
because I'm an angry country would it probably makes you feel better about

1069
01:03:18.931 --> 01:03:19.764
yourself.

1070
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:21.223
<v 2>MMM.</v>

1071
01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.110
<v 1>Which is why I love Bobby Knight.
But you watch Bobby Knight and you're like,</v>

1072
01:03:24.111 --> 01:03:25.580
oh my God,
I'm a fucking saint.

1073
01:03:26.350 --> 01:03:26.780
<v 2>Okay</v>

1074
01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:29.660
<v 1>this guy,
now this guy has got a temporary that day.
I'm telling you right now,</v>

1075
01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.580
if your wife ever gives you shit for having a temper,

1076
01:03:31.581 --> 01:03:34.940
it's like you think I got a temper just cut to,
you could be married to that.

1077
01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:41.600
And I love Bobby Knight by the way.
Um,
so anyways,

1078
01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:42.523
uh,

1079
01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:43.610
<v 2>okay.</v>

1080
01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:47.880
<v 1>I just now like,
uh,
I don't know.</v>

1081
01:03:47.881 --> 01:03:51.210
I tried to in the moment,
I just tried to fucking like,

1082
01:03:51.211 --> 01:03:54.660
this is funny thing that happens.
Like when my daughter,
uh,

1083
01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.840
you don't need your diaper changed.
It's like,
you know,

1084
01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:00.660
you hear him farting and everything.
So you thinking like,
okay,

1085
01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:03.000
that's definitely a,
you know,

1086
01:04:03.001 --> 01:04:05.940
when you eat without getting into the gross details,

1087
01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:11.430
just think you hear the Farc and you think that's the gun sounding the end of

1088
01:04:11.431 --> 01:04:13.860
the game.
And then when she get into it,

1089
01:04:13.861 --> 01:04:17.640
you realize that wasn't a gun sounding the end of the game or even the end of

1090
01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:21.030
the half.
That was the sound of the fucking jets flying over the game,

1091
01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.930
over the stadium right after the fucking national anthem and the game's about

1092
01:04:24.931 --> 01:04:25.764
ready to begin.

1093
01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:27.643
<v 2>MMM.</v>

1094
01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:32.210
<v 1>I left pad save yesterday blocker cheese block,</v>

1095
01:04:33.350 --> 01:04:37.700
saved my wall,
took it all on my shirt and all that.
It's just like,

1096
01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:39.900
<v 2>okay,</v>

1097
01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:42.300
<v 1>it's fucking unbelievable.
And whenever that happens,</v>

1098
01:04:42.301 --> 01:04:45.720
like a couple of times I went like,
Nia,
she,
why'd you tell me to come in?

1099
01:04:45.721 --> 01:04:48.450
She's still going like she could tell.

1100
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.510
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1101
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:53.230
<v 1>Like does any way for my wife to know whether my daughter is done</v>

1102
01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:58.960
going to the bathroom or not.
She's got no fucking idea.
And I apologized,

1103
01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:03.070
Eh,
uh,
I just addressed that I was angry and I,

1104
01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:06.820
and I did it two more to fucking times and now,
now I got it down.

1105
01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:11.380
Now we just say something as I walk up to the changing table at three or four in

1106
01:05:11.381 --> 01:05:16.180
the morning.
And I just basically say,
if she's not done,
and you know,

1107
01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:20.530
this is not anybody's fault,
this is just part of having a kid don't flip out.

1108
01:05:20.531 --> 01:05:24.580
And I,
and I'll see how that works for me tonight.
That's just base.
I just,
uh,

1109
01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:29.030
before I just kept it all in my head
and then it becomes like,

1110
01:05:29.031 --> 01:05:31.460
it isn't that it's sorta resort real,
but isn't,

1111
01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:35.510
I just find when I say it out loud,
then I could fucking address it.
And uh,

1112
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:37.070
so we'll see that.
But,
uh,

1113
01:05:37.071 --> 01:05:41.210
I gotta tell you actually fucking really enjoy changing diapers and everything.

1114
01:05:41.211 --> 01:05:44.660
We gave my daughter her first bath ever,
right in the kitchen sink,

1115
01:05:44.661 --> 01:05:45.800
old school style.

1116
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:51.200
I'm sure we've supposed to have like a fucking hazmat suit team come in and

1117
01:05:51.201 --> 01:05:54.770
disinfect the sank and she's supposed to wear a helmet and some scuba gear.

1118
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:59.030
But uh,
that's not how we're bringing her up.
We go and we're going old school,

1119
01:05:59.031 --> 01:06:00.980
I've been playing music for and everything,

1120
01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:04.700
got this exercise ball and really just kind of puts her to sleep and I just play

1121
01:06:04.701 --> 01:06:06.920
music and she just totally chills out.
Okay.

1122
01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.453
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1123
01:06:09.350 --> 01:06:12.910
<v 1>The stuff that she's enjoyed so far,
she's,
she likes Herbie Hancock.</v>

1124
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:18.550
I was playing some Billy Cobham some of this shit I just been listening to.

1125
01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:20.370
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1126
01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:25.190
<v 1>What else has she been listed?
Some of the pop stuff she really likes,</v>

1127
01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:28.460
I think they just like music in general.
They just kind of like what the,

1128
01:06:28.461 --> 01:06:32.570
what is that and a,
I dunno,
it's getting to that point.

1129
01:06:32.571 --> 01:06:34.340
She's just starting to be able to look around and eat,

1130
01:06:34.341 --> 01:06:35.360
kind of sit there going like,

1131
01:06:35.361 --> 01:06:38.390
I think she's actually looking at me right now and then raise you make a guy

1132
01:06:38.391 --> 01:06:41.600
contact.
Like,
Hey,
are you fucking looking at me?

1133
01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:46.050
Or I was just kind of drift away and look at something else.
I'm like,
all right,

1134
01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:48.330
I guess I'm still like an acid trip when she looks at me.

1135
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:49.983
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1136
01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:53.070
<v 1>But anyways,
we're having a great time and,
uh,</v>

1137
01:06:53.071 --> 01:06:58.060
even though I'm not getting any sleep,
um,
it's totally fucking worth it.
And,

1138
01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:02.000
uh,
it's,
it's,
I'll tell you if you're,
if you're an older dad,

1139
01:07:02.001 --> 01:07:03.920
it's not as fucking hard.
They tried to say,
oh my God,

1140
01:07:03.921 --> 01:07:06.290
you're old and going to try to do this.
It's like,
yeah,

1141
01:07:06.291 --> 01:07:09.170
I'm old and I have a house.
You know,

1142
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:14.120
I'm not some fucking struggling 20 something.
You know what I mean?

1143
01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.380
Fucking broke kid trying to pay off student loans and then you have a kid,

1144
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:22.070
people in their twenties,
if they complain about having a kid,
I,
yeah,

1145
01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:26.060
without a doubt.
I'll listen to that.
But if you're in your thirties and forties,

1146
01:07:26.061 --> 01:07:27.230
yeah.
Could go fuck yourself.

1147
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:35.420
All right.
That's it.
