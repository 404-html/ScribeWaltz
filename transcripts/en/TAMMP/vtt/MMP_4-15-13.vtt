Hey,
what's going on is bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.210
April 15th,
2013.

3
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.920
how are you doing this week?

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.450
Do you feel like this week is going to be a good one?
Um,

5
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:21.660
today's episode is brought to you by tig.
Um,
there,

6
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.930
<v 0>yeah.</v>

7
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.040
<v 1>Sports Fan drum set,
that's the proper word.
Um,</v>

8
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.050
seeing that dude Luke come off the bench and hit fucking,
uh,

9
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.130
three 43 pointers in a row and after three that alleyoop jam was the sickest

10
00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.630
thing that dude spike whatever.

11
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.980
I'm not the biggest college hoop fair spike whatever fucking for Michigan.

12
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.640
<v 1>You know what law ahead was joking about?
I said in the,</v>

14
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.210
he was joking like saying in the first half it was white dude's dominating the

15
00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:56.590
game with outside shots.

16
00:00:56.591 --> 00:00:59.980
Of course God knows wouldn't when our game has never been above the rim.

17
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.080
White dudes would dominating that game.
And then in the second half,

18
00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:10.081
black dudes just took it over and Bly head was cracking us up saying basically

19
00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:12.760
they were doing a reenactment of basketball history.

20
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.560
I liked the first sack half was like when fuck and a Bob Cousy,

21
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.700
you know,
back when you couldn't put your hand on the side of the ball,

22
00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:27.280
you had to fucking look.
You had to have it right on top of the ball.

23
00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:31.030
You have a watch that she had watched old basketball highlights and people

24
00:01:31.031 --> 00:01:35.170
always go like,
oh my God,
these guys suck.
They didn't suck.
If you put,

25
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.470
if you put your hand on the side of the ball to go to this side,

26
00:01:38.471 --> 00:01:43.340
that was considered a carry.
They've made all these fucking rules where a,

27
00:01:43.341 --> 00:01:46.530
what did,
uh,
by the way have all been great rules,
you know,

28
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.180
to allow these athletes to reach the reach,
the pinnacle of their,
there's their,

29
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:55.750
uh,
their sports at history.
I almost didn't get that out.
Um,

30
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.020
<v 0>okay.</v>

31
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.060
<v 1>But it was just,
it was an unbelievable game.</v>

32
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.120
And there was this fucking Louisville fan sitting behind us and dude,

33
00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:07.430
I got to tell you,
we were on the lower level and we still needed binoculars.

34
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.640
I'm not even gonna lie to you.
I mean,
it was like if we were at a,

35
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.970
if we were at like at an Atlanta Falcons game,

36
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:18.290
we would have been eighth row in the end zone.
All right.

37
00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:21.380
Cause we literally could see the wall where they would actually have like the,

38
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.240
the post nine 11 people glaring at you with their yellow coats on,

39
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.750
you know,
uh,
but instead,
because it was basketball,

40
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.150
there was,
there was like a fenced area where you couldn't go past.

41
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.550
And then there was a whole nother section of about 20 rows of these padded

42
00:02:39.551 --> 00:02:41.110
seats.
Right.

43
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.760
And then in front of that was a whole nother 20 section of just students.

44
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.090
And it was some Michigan kids who,
by the way,

45
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.100
Michigan used to be the blue and maize.
Now it's just the maze.

46
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.693
Um,

47
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.620
I got to tell you that some of these fucking uniforms and some of the shit just,

48
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.430
it's the loudest Shit I've seen since the 79 pirates.

49
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.840
And I considering that they're in the midst of making anchorman part too.

50
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.200
I think it's very,
I was actually thinking that,
you know,
how they make,
you know,

51
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:17.230
they,
they make fun of the clothes from back then in like the late seventies and

52
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:22.030
everything when they,
when they do the anchorman of this,
this time right now,

53
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.450
you know,
with sports and that type of thing.

54
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:29.080
If there's ever somebody as big as a genius has,

55
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:31.990
Will Ferrell and like 20 years is making fun of this era.

56
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.820
It's going to be shit like that.

57
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.320
Like those uniforms when Michigan played Syracuse,
I mean,

58
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:40.090
that was just fucking ridiculous.

59
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:43.960
Those yellow sneakers and the orange sneakers,
that's,

60
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.520
that's just something I would,
I'm going to say within maybe four years,

61
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.640
well,
actually probably four years,
it'll start to die off.

62
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:54.070
So I'll say within 10 years you're going to look back at those things.

63
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:58.810
It'd be like,
Jesus Christ the fuck were we thinking.
Um,

64
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.690
I saw a couple of Michigan fans with the old school,
like,

65
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.430
you know the blue where it says Michigan and yellow.
It's funny.
Tell it which it,

66
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.620
it looked like a fucking,

67
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.450
it look at HD mustard and they were all chanting go blue.

68
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.420
Like you guys don't have any fucking blue on anymore,

69
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.090
but I have to tell you we were,
so we was sitting on the Michigan side.

70
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.960
<v 0>Okay.</v>

71
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.840
<v 1>And you know,
I flunked everything in fucking high school</v>

72
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.260
and they used to sit there and try and scare the shit out of me.
You know,
going,

73
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.180
you need till years,
little language.
You got a big show,

74
00:04:36.181 --> 00:04:40.800
your GPA is above a 3.6 you're not going to get it above a bunny sat there and

75
00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:45.160
you sit in that fucking nod off just not giving a shit.
I've got to tell you,

76
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:47.610
I once did that fucking basketball game

77
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.010
and the entire student section turned around,

78
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.020
faced us and like almost just doing like this half Tomahawk Chop think they

79
00:04:57.571 --> 00:04:57.750
will.

80
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.750
They went go and then everybody behind this when Blue Oh blue,

81
00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:05.490
the whole fucking section going nuts.

82
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.210
<v 0>Okay.</v>

83
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.220
<v 1>And I said the fucking version.
I said,
you know,</v>

84
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:11.440
my freshman in high school year in high school,

85
00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:14.320
instead of scaring the shit out of me academically,
they just showed,

86
00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:17.110
it should have showed me a video of this going,
you know what?

87
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:20.380
If you actually study in high school,
you can participate in something like this,

88
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:21.460
and I would have been like,
well,
you know what?

89
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:24.310
I'm going to go home and hit the books.
I would have done that.

90
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.700
Instead of telling me all the academic shit that I need,

91
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:32.080
they should have showed me how fun college could have been if I actually studied

92
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.360
and went to a real fucking school.
No,

93
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.520
I didn't.
I completely,

94
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.150
I fucked up my freshman year of high school.

95
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:47.500
I went in there and I was thinking I was going to be old and I was going to go

96
00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:50.320
to Notre Dame University.
Those were my goals.

97
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.350
By the time sophomore year came around,

98
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.410
I was looking at Wentworth college and I was considering getting into

99
00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:58.244
construction.

100
00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.943
<v 2>Okay,</v>

101
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.220
<v 1>what a fucking idiot.
Now I go around all these big schools,
you know,</v>

102
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.080
I fucking go to these games,
go like an Lsu game or a Georgia bulldog game.

103
00:06:10.081 --> 00:06:13.940
Ohio state,
Michigan.
Just go to these fucking things and you just see these kids.

104
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:17.190
I hope the kids appreciate it.
Maybe that's what,
you know.

105
00:06:17.191 --> 00:06:20.430
I think maybe you have to be like me to really fucking appreciate how awesome it

106
00:06:20.431 --> 00:06:21.960
is to go to a school.

107
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.260
<v 2>Okay.</v>

108
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.250
<v 1>That has such an insane fucking sports program.
You,</v>

109
00:06:27.251 --> 00:06:29.620
this is what I'm jealous about those colleges kids,

110
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.720
is that for the rest of their lives,

111
00:06:31.721 --> 00:06:36.400
they can kind of stay connected to that college by following the teams.

112
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.510
And if they ever want to have like a mini reunion with the tailgate friends,

113
00:06:40.511 --> 00:06:43.480
you just pick a game once a year when you go to what and have a great fucking

114
00:06:43.481 --> 00:06:47.950
time,
you know?
Oh Jesus,
did I fuck up?

115
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.410
It's making me sad.
Um,

116
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.700
but you know what makes me happy?

117
00:06:56.701 --> 00:07:00.960
Everybody never having to go to the post office again.
Huh?
Oh,

118
00:07:00.961 --> 00:07:02.040
that was a nice segue.

119
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:07.250
stamps.com everybody you a postage meter companies used to have to have the

120
00:07:07.681 --> 00:07:09.450
monopoly on printing postage.

121
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.290
They could charge you an arm and a leg to print postage from your own office,

122
00:07:13.291 --> 00:07:14.430
but those days are over.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:48.380
we go,
we did Athens the first night
down.
Uh,

147
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.370
what does that,
it's northeast of Atlanta.

148
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.980
First day we went to the basketball game.
The next day,
the tour starts right now.

149
00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:59.970
You have to go to work,
pay for all the fucking money.
We spent the night before.

150
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.400
I don't,
I don't think at the end of this,
I don't think I made any money,

151
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:06.090
but I had a great fucking time.
All right.
Um,

152
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.700
my quarterly taxes it dude,
this is going to be a rough one.

153
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.120
Somebody's going to be eating fruit loops.
Um,

154
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.290
so we do Athens,
Georgia first,
right?
And we're all fucking giddy.

155
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.790
Just freaking out.
We do the Gig.
Have a great time.

156
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:24.930
This beautiful theater.

157
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.220
I really don't have any funny fucking stories because everything just worked out

158
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:33.570
this week.
Um,
it was a Tuesday night.
The place was packed.

159
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:39.120
Um,
what happened on that show?
Nothing.
We just had a great time.

160
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:40.620
I did have to get into with one guy.

161
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.320
<v 2>Okay.</v>

162
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.780
<v 1>One guy just kept screaming and yelling.
He was too excited.</v>

163
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.800
So I went off on him and I ended it with,
I'm ashamed of you,

164
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.670
which is quite possibly one of the funnies things.

165
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.720
One grown man could say to another one.
I am ashamed of you.

166
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:04.070
Um,
then we got off.
We got on the bus because we were,
uh,

167
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:09.170
we were driving up to,
uh,
oh.
Did we stay on the bus at night?

168
00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:15.110
No,
no,
no,
no.
We drove up to Hoover,
Alabama.
Oh,
I know.

169
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.050
I can take you through the week.
So we go up to Hoover,
Alabama to play this.

170
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.140
The next night we go up there fucking Alabama,
by the way.

171
00:10:24.141 --> 00:10:27.770
Absolutely beautiful fucking state.
I would retire.

172
00:10:27.771 --> 00:10:31.310
I'm actually thinking about retiring there for the simple fact.

173
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.600
Nobody fucking retires there.
Even never heard that in your life.

174
00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:39.740
People retire where they go out west.
Everybody goes to fucking Arizona,

175
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.630
right?
And out east.
Everybody goes to Florida.
The Midwest people,

176
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.840
they retire in the Carolinas.
All right?

177
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.270
Nobody fucking retires.

178
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.440
Nobody from outside of Alabama retires in Alabama hedge,

179
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.790
you can get like 90 acres for about $67.
Go out there.

180
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.050
Get me a spread.

181
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:01.903
<v 2>Right?</v>

182
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.500
<v 1>I don't know.
I couldn't get a direct flight anywhere that would suck less.</v>

183
00:11:06.501 --> 00:11:09.560
I was going to Mississippi.
But who cares at that point?

184
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.110
I think that that's what you do is you fucking,

185
00:11:12.111 --> 00:11:16.490
you go to a really expensive fucking places like New York,
La,

186
00:11:16.491 --> 00:11:20.060
Chicago,
and you bust your fucking ass your whole fucking life.

187
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.310
You make a bunch of goddamn money.

188
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:27.020
And then in the end you retire to a beautiful state that nobody wants to go to

189
00:11:27.021 --> 00:11:29.570
for some stupid fucking reason.
And then all the,

190
00:11:29.571 --> 00:11:32.960
all the assets that you've accrued,

191
00:11:32.961 --> 00:11:37.340
you sell those things and there were three times as much down and fucking

192
00:11:37.341 --> 00:11:40.920
Alabama.
He just retire there.
Get yourself a giant fucking dish.

193
00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:45.170
You get all the sports channels.
It's not,
they don't have food down there,

194
00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:49.640
you know,
and then pick a school,
Alabama,
Auburn,
Crimson tide,

195
00:11:49.641 --> 00:11:53.830
a war eagle,
and enjoy yourself.
Just a good old boy.

196
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.590
Right?
So then we did Hoover,
Alabama,

197
00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.520
and this is the best part right after Hoover out Alabama.

198
00:12:01.521 --> 00:12:06.110
We had to be in Columbia,
South Carolina the next night,
which I've never been to.

199
00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:10.340
So it was one of those deals where as the second the show was over,

200
00:12:10.341 --> 00:12:12.830
we got on the bus and we just started driving.

201
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:14.230
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

202
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:19.030
<v 1>And,
uh,
we got a bottle,
a makers and we just started pouring drinks.</v>

203
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.310
We popped in fucking anchorman.
Watch that,
laughed our asses off.

204
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:29.200
And uh,
I dunno,

205
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.770
we just polished off the bottle somewhere in about four or five hours into the

206
00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:35.710
fucking trip,
by the way.
We're supposed to be sleeping.

207
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:36.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

208
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.310
<v 1>We're supposed to be sleeping.
And the bus driver who slept during the day,</v>

209
00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.440
he's supposed to be up driving,
you know,

210
00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:47.950
so we get about four hours into this eight hour trip and then we pull out,

211
00:12:47.951 --> 00:12:50.900
the guy pulls over the bus and he goes,
look,
uh,
he's like,

212
00:12:50.901 --> 00:12:55.460
we're going to get there too early,
you know,
for when we check in at the hotels,

213
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
you know,
so we just got to kind of chill here for a minute,

214
00:12:59.001 --> 00:13:01.880
sleep on the bus and were like,
yeah,
cool.
No worries.
So he goes to,

215
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.800
he goes to bed,
I'm going to bed.

216
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:08.620
He goes to bed and we keep fucking drinking.

217
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.210
Somewhere in the middle of that,

218
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:12.260
<v 0>yeah,</v>

219
00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.880
<v 1>me and version,
you get into this giant fucking New York Boston argument</v>

220
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.760
that I think went on for like 40 fucking minutes.

221
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.590
It was hilarious.
Absolutely hilarious.

222
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.490
And then got real for like three minutes and then got hilarious again.

223
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.380
I'm so fucking stupid people from those two cities.
We'll never get along.

224
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.070
And then finally,
I don't know what happened at like five in the morning.

225
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:42.360
I was just like,
guys,
I got to go to bed,
right.
Versie and fucking la.
Hell yeah,

226
00:13:42.361 --> 00:13:47.340
no worries.
No worries.
Right.
So I fucking go back and in the back,

227
00:13:47.341 --> 00:13:51.990
go to bed.
And uh,
evidently first he law had just kept going.

228
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:59.970
The bus driver wakes up at like eight 30 in the morning,
comes from the back,

229
00:13:59.971 --> 00:14:02.430
walks up to the front of the bus,
opens the door.

230
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:07.170
Eddie sees fucking law ahead and versus still sitting there drinking.

231
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.200
And he goes,
man,
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
And uh,

232
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.190
I'm not gonna name names or anything like that,

233
00:14:14.191 --> 00:14:18.690
but this bus driver has seen a lot of shit.
He's driven a lot of people.

234
00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:22.830
So to get this guy to be like,
man,
you gotta be shitting me was,

235
00:14:22.831 --> 00:14:26.340
was a major fucking accomplishment.
Uh,

236
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.430
I'll take you through the 12 real quick.
So then the next night we were a,

237
00:14:29.431 --> 00:14:30.630
we drove into a,

238
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:32.820
<v 0>okay,</v>

239
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.920
<v 1>Columbia,
South Carolina,
which is from what I hear,</v>

240
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.970
just like Savannah,
Georgia,
except Nasser is the people there said.

241
00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:45.890
And um,
I dunno,
I got up around like one o'clock,

242
00:14:45.891 --> 00:14:47.000
two o'clock or some shit.

243
00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.990
And I just walked two miles from where we parked the bus outside the hotel and

244
00:14:51.991 --> 00:14:56.840
then went down to the whole old area of,
uh,
of South Carolina,

245
00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.390
Columbia,
South Carolina.
It was fucking insane.

246
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:04.990
This is a place where like bankers retired after they steal money for 60 years,

247
00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:08.650
they,
they'd fucking,
I was sitting there walking down the street and,
um,

248
00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.610
there's some horse drawn carriage thing that people are like taking a,
a,

249
00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:17.980
a tour of the area and all these old homes.
The lady has the,
uh,

250
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:22.360
the rebel confederate hat on minus the flag.
Right?
And she's like,

251
00:15:22.361 --> 00:15:26.800
if y'all look over there,
that house for sale for $9 million,

252
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.000
this old ass fucking house.

253
00:15:31.001 --> 00:15:36.001
And I'm looking at it like probably a hundred to 150 years older than my house.

254
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.540
This thing may be is from the early 18 hundreds.
Right?

255
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.010
And,
uh,
if not the 17 hundreds.

256
00:15:45.011 --> 00:15:48.880
And I'm just thinking of all the bullshit that I've gone through with my house

257
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.450
that's 90 years old and that's all I saw.
I'm like,

258
00:15:53.451 --> 00:15:55.820
you're going to pay fucking $9 million for that.
Really?

259
00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:59.230
That's what you're gonna do.
And you're going to be out fucking,
you know,

260
00:15:59.231 --> 00:16:02.030
at the movies and a pipe is going to burst and you gonna have to deal with that

261
00:16:02.031 --> 00:16:06.350
bullet.
Go Fuck Yourself.
If you play $9 million for a house,

262
00:16:06.351 --> 00:16:10.830
you're an asshole.
You're an asshole.
All right?

263
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.400
You're in banking.
That's what I would guess.

264
00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.990
You either in banking or you worked for insurance companies and collected

265
00:16:18.991 --> 00:16:19.561
premiums.

266
00:16:19.561 --> 00:16:22.830
And then when people's fucking gallbladders bursted you didn't give him the

267
00:16:22.831 --> 00:16:27.080
fucking money either did that or you invented the Flowbee.

268
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.501
Other than that,

269
00:16:28.501 --> 00:16:33.501
I don't know how you either just straight up steal shit legally or you fucking,

270
00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.250
uh,
you come up with just some dumb shit.

271
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.640
The Jack Chop,
right.
Some sort of thing to chop up lettuce,

272
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:49.050
you know,
I'll make fat people more comfortable.
That's another one.
Right.

273
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:54.180
All right,
here we go.
I'm in limbo.
Hey Bill.
I'm 22 years old from the suburbs,

274
00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.740
lawn guy land,

275
00:16:56.130 --> 00:17:00.360
the youngest of four and I guess you could say I'm the black sheep of the
family.

276
00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:04.560
I didn't go to college after high school mainly because I had no clue what I

277
00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:08.430
wanted to do and I didn't see how spending three grand at a shitty community

278
00:17:08.431 --> 00:17:11.580
college would help me figure that out.
Three grand.

279
00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.020
<v 0>Okay</v>

280
00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.660
<v 1>Dude.
See now that's what you want to go to college.
We're just three grant.</v>

281
00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.880
You come out of the day,
you're not swimming in debt,

282
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:22.260
but you have no team to follow.
Um,
anyways,
however,

283
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:27.570
I'm a decent musician and have acted in a French student films and people told

284
00:17:27.571 --> 00:17:31.650
me I'm somewhat talented in that area.
For the past year or so,

285
00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.600
I become clinically depressed.

286
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:37.860
I feel that there isn't much left for me here and I'm sick of my friends.

287
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.530
I was thinking about moving to la with a friend and his brother.

288
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:45.390
I'm hoping I can find some things out there and just mainly to get away from the

289
00:17:45.391 --> 00:17:46.380
life I have now.

290
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:51.150
Also looking forward to all the low self struggling actress ass.

291
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.930
I've heard so much about.
Um,
however,

292
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.580
over the last year or so,
my relationship with my family has met,

293
00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.580
not been going so well.

294
00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:03.480
Should I stick around and work on my life here and put the pieces back together

295
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.470
or go out there and meet some new people and have some new experiences?
Yeah.

296
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:11.400
Fucking come out to la or wherever the hell you want to go.

297
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.780
I think you're depressed because you're in a circle of people that are all

298
00:18:15.781 --> 00:18:19.800
following the same fucking lead buffalo over,

299
00:18:19.801 --> 00:18:24.450
over that cliff.
All right.
You're still going to go over a cliff as we all do,

300
00:18:24.451 --> 00:18:26.250
but you want to be following a buffalo.

301
00:18:26.251 --> 00:18:29.520
Let's go in the fucking direction you want to go to.
Oh my God.

302
00:18:29.521 --> 00:18:34.320
He's using animals as a metaphor.
Um,
sir,

303
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.710
I would say,
I mean,
if you're clinically depressed,
I mean,

304
00:18:37.711 --> 00:18:41.250
I don't know if you have something fucking like,
uh,
like,
you know,

305
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.770
chemically going on,
I can't help you with that.

306
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:46.950
But if he just fucking depressed because you know,

307
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:52.460
doing what all your friends and family is doing and it's just soul sucking every

308
00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:55.890
God damn day,
I can help you with that.
All right?

309
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.510
If you're clinically fucking depressed,

310
00:18:57.511 --> 00:19:00.750
I mean you need to see a doctor or some shit,
you know,

311
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.830
I dunno.
See what sort of witchcraft he can offer you.

312
00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:06.510
But if you just fucking depressed,
I mean,

313
00:19:06.511 --> 00:19:10.080
I would definitely a go for a change of scenery.

314
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.360
Um,
but I would also say if you're stepping into the,
to a life of the arts,

315
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:16.260
like you,
you really,

316
00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:21.120
you have to have a game plan the same way somebody who's going to become a

317
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:24.810
banker does.
Mike,
a banker goes,
okay,
um,

318
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.000
I'm going to join this evil business and I'm going to make as much fucking money

319
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.350
as I possibly can.

320
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:36.390
And if I have to make old people who actually fought for this country,

321
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:40.290
have to eat alto for the rest of their fucking lives because we're going to rape

322
00:19:40.291 --> 00:19:44.610
and pillage their 401k's.
Um,
this is,

323
00:19:44.611 --> 00:19:46.890
these are the steps I need to do.
One,

324
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.730
shut off all feelings for other human beings.
You know,
they,
they make a list,

325
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.960
justify my evil by saying I'm a small part of the bigger evil,

326
00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:03.170
but my evil is actually a very low level of evil amongst the ridiculous level of

327
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:07.840
evil.
Um,
no,

328
00:20:07.841 --> 00:20:11.420
like as far as
what I did,
um,

329
00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.710
when I became a comedian was I just,

330
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:16.030
<v 0>okay.</v>

331
00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:19.420
<v 1>They were just very small steps.
One,</v>

332
00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.080
sit down and write jokes to sign up for open mic.

333
00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:28.410
Three have the balls to go up there when they call your name for no matter how

334
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:34.230
bad or good it goes,
sign up for another open mic.

335
00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:35.410
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

336
00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:39.100
<v 1>And just,
I just kept,
I just kept going to you kind of,</v>

337
00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.620
if you look too far down the fucking road,

338
00:20:41.621 --> 00:20:44.230
it's going to become overwhelming when,
when you're,

339
00:20:44.231 --> 00:20:45.850
when you're going after something like that,

340
00:20:45.851 --> 00:20:50.710
you just handle what you handle that day.
And,
um,

341
00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:52.670
I w I would do that.

342
00:20:52.671 --> 00:20:56.540
I can tell you that if you're going to just start being a standup comedian,

343
00:20:56.541 --> 00:20:58.790
la is a really hard place to start.

344
00:20:59.320 --> 00:20:59.800
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

345
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.500
<v 1>You kind of want to have your act together and have a little bit of momentum</v>

346
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:03.334
when you go out there.

347
00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:05.480
<v 2>MMM.</v>

348
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.730
<v 1>But if you,
if you want to act and be an actor,
I mean there's,</v>

349
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:13.960
that's what is a ton of work.
But,
um,
you know,

350
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.550
I don't know when you're going to go out to la,

351
00:21:15.551 --> 00:21:17.440
but I'm sure wherever you live at,
there's,

352
00:21:17.441 --> 00:21:20.860
there's some sort of place where you can start taking acting classes,

353
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.020
which is probably what I would do,

354
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.690
<v 2>you know?
Um,</v>

355
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:28.001
<v 1>look,</v>

356
00:21:28.001 --> 00:21:30.670
if you just need a change of scenery and you want to go out in the fun in the

357
00:21:30.671 --> 00:21:34.130
sun and go live down on the beach,
um,

358
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.130
Los Angeles and greater Los Angeles,

359
00:21:36.131 --> 00:21:38.770
like south of there and everything is one of the great places you could ever

360
00:21:38.771 --> 00:21:40.690
live in your life.
I know there's a ton of traffic,

361
00:21:40.691 --> 00:21:44.310
but still some of the most beautiful women you ever going to see you don't want

362
00:21:44.311 --> 00:21:46.740
if you get outside of La,
most of them aren't even in the business.

363
00:21:46.741 --> 00:21:48.910
So now they just a beautiful woman on a beach,
you know?

364
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.730
And if that doesn't pick up your spirits,
I don't know what will,

365
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:53.690
<v 2>but um,</v>

366
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.240
<v 1>you know,
if you seriously want to become an actor and that type of thing,</v>

367
00:21:57.241 --> 00:21:58.440
I wherever you're at,

368
00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:02.400
I would start taking some acting classes to see if you actually do have a knack

369
00:22:02.401 --> 00:22:06.510
for it.
Slash if you have a passion for it.
Do you go down there,

370
00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:10.080
you start acting and then that makes you want to read some plays or makes you

371
00:22:10.081 --> 00:22:14.340
want to go rewatch some movies to learn.
If you,
if you get like the bug,

372
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:19.050
you know and you really feel like this is something you want to pursue.
Um,

373
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.330
then I would work my ass off on that.
When you,

374
00:22:21.331 --> 00:22:25.500
when I felt like I had my act together and I maybe done a player to uh,

375
00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.510
go out to la,
get yourself a fucking agent.

376
00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.800
[inaudible] and welcome to this fucked up business.

377
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:38.700
Like I've always said,
if a jackass like making get anywhere.
So could you.
Um,

378
00:22:38.701 --> 00:22:39.540
all right,
next one.

379
00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:44.980
A follow up to last week's miserable law student and some ass kissing.
All right,

380
00:22:44.981 --> 00:22:49.800
well I'm going to go blow past the fucking ass kick ass kissing.
We'll read a,

381
00:22:49.801 --> 00:22:53.260
a followup up bill.
First off,
I'm sorry about the length of this email.

382
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:57.700
I know you are busy.
Look,
you don't have to sugarcoat it.
You just write bills.

383
00:22:57.701 --> 00:23:01.180
Sorry about the length of this email.
I know you suck at reading out loud.

384
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:02.321
Anyways,

385
00:23:02.321 --> 00:23:07.321
I am a lawyer and this is just how I write and think I implore you to take 10

386
00:23:09.311 --> 00:23:12.010
minutes to read it.
You know what,

387
00:23:12.011 --> 00:23:15.850
when anybody uses the word implore and just cause you said you're a lawyer,

388
00:23:15.851 --> 00:23:17.220
I just fixed it.
You,
you,

389
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:20.530
you're speaking to the jury and you just clapped both of your hands together,

390
00:23:20.531 --> 00:23:23.950
like clash them together.
I implore you to look at the evidence.

391
00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:26.290
Uh,

392
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.820
whatever that I am generally thinking you were thanking,

393
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:35.080
thanking you for being a good man.
If you want to use some of it,
of all of it,

394
00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:38.590
feel free.
If not,
then no hard feelings.

395
00:23:38.591 --> 00:23:42.760
I promise not to show up.
Do you house house some money mom for all right.
Okay.

396
00:23:42.761 --> 00:23:46.340
Last week you read a letter from a kid who finished his first year of law school

397
00:23:46.341 --> 00:23:50.180
who was trying to decide whether to drop out and he noted that he hated law law

398
00:23:50.181 --> 00:23:51.470
school and was unhappy.

399
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.520
You told them to walk away speaking as an attorney with 10 years,

400
00:23:55.521 --> 00:23:59.780
a hundred trials,
murderers,
rapers you name it.

401
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:03.110
Please let me say this.
Your advice was spot on.

402
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.850
Oh my God.
I thought you were gonna go the other way.
I,
you're going to be like,

403
00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:09.620
let's say law school was terrible,

404
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:13.250
but once you get out of it and get it to the exciting world of sitting next to a

405
00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:16.820
rapist till you know,
dead it,
but for some reason you have to defend them.

406
00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.450
Um,
it makes it all worth worthwhile.
Um,

407
00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:26.990
in my line of work,
we use the term jaded.
Jaded is the state,

408
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.340
uh,
where an attorney no longer gives a shit about his clients.

409
00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:36.230
He simply does his job out of obligation and the need to bring in a paycheck.

410
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:39.770
Dude,
how the fuck can you be in that mindset

411
00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:43.850
with somebody whose freedom is on the line?

412
00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:45.730
<v 0>Okay.</v>

413
00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:50.430
<v 1>Do I swear to God?
Life is so fucking scary.
Once again,</v>

414
00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.420
one of the dumber things I've said,
no,

415
00:24:52.421 --> 00:24:56.040
nothing will ever be dumber than when I was on Joe Rogan's podcast and I,

416
00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.870
whatever the fuck I said about science,

417
00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:01.380
like science is like fascinating.

418
00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:07.470
It's neat.
I said something really stupid like the sciences,
like amazing.

419
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:12.180
Um,
listen,
listen to the Joe Rogan experience by the way.
Uh,

420
00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:16.350
or reach out to one of his listeners and I'm sure they can tell you where it is

421
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.220
in that podcast where I said it is,
it's really,
it was so dumb.

422
00:25:20.221 --> 00:25:23.270
I wasn't even embarrassed.
I almost felt like a,

423
00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.630
I felt a freedom,
you know,
almost like I was like someone who,

424
00:25:27.631 --> 00:25:29.760
if they come out of the closet,
you know,

425
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.860
I was coming out of the closet of stupidity.

426
00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.210
I was tired of pretending to be this person that I wasn't.

427
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.420
Is he in the closet stupid or is he out of the clis out of the closet.

428
00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:49.300
He announced to the world.
He like that Ellen member that,
Yep,
I'm gay.
I was that.

429
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.010
I should have been on the cover of Time magazine.
Yep.
I'm stupid.
Right?

430
00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:57.840
Shrugging fucking little mixer in front of me is I record the podcast.
All right,

431
00:25:57.841 --> 00:26:00.840
Dell,
we get it.
Okay.
I have 15 cases tomorrow.

432
00:26:00.841 --> 00:26:03.320
This lawyer says each of was,

433
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.290
is a human being facing prison some for decades.

434
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:11.460
The truth is that I don't give a shit about a single one.
Oh my God,

435
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.840
I'll do my job,
but be it via the path of least resistance.

436
00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:21.050
I just want to get back to my office and check La times.com I should probably

437
00:26:21.421 --> 00:26:23.190
offer some excuse,
but I won't.

438
00:26:23.191 --> 00:26:27.900
Truth is that every criminal defense attorney gets this way within three years

439
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.140
of passing the bar.
Wow.

440
00:26:31.141 --> 00:26:34.470
Are you just speaking for yourself and thinking it's everybody?
Are you serious?

441
00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.800
Oh my God,
God,
help me if I ever have to fucking go to,

442
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:40.530
<v 0>okay.</v>

443
00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.530
<v 1>Get a defense attorney.
Jesus Christ.
Anyways,</v>

444
00:26:43.531 --> 00:26:45.870
between my first and second years of law school,

445
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:50.850
I learned that I love commercial aviation.
Oh,
so here it is.
So no,
dude,

446
00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.640
you can't tell.
It's,
you can't say all lawyers are like this.

447
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:58.710
You want to be a pilot,
right?
Wait a second,

448
00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:01.950
he says,
not flying,
but rather the aircraft itself.

449
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.340
I love every little nook and cranny,
every little screw in spring,

450
00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:09.570
but I ignored my passion and press forward instead of following a dream and

451
00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:11.610
moving to Seattle where Boeing is based,

452
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:15.120
I took a big paycheck as a public defender every day.

453
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.840
Now I look in the mirror and wonder what could have been.
All right.

454
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.470
Wait a minute.
Okay,
so you,
well,
the,

455
00:27:20.471 --> 00:27:22.680
you can't lump all attorneys because some people,

456
00:27:22.681 --> 00:27:26.280
it's their dream to be an attorney and they want to go there and they want to do

457
00:27:26.281 --> 00:27:28.920
something.
Well,
I know,
I know a couple of great attorneys.

458
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.060
I have a great attorney.
The guy's a fucking animal.

459
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:38.370
He's up there prowl in this stage,
killing the crowd,
but doing it in a legal,

460
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:43.350
in the legal field.
Ah,
dude,
this kills this.
This fucking kills me

461
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.550
in all and all serious.
This kills me like nothing else.

462
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.330
Hearing stories of people wanting to do other things and they're not doing it.

463
00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.630
Dude,
what's to stop you from quitting right now and just doing it.

464
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:59.700
It's not like you're 80 anyways,
between my first and second years of law school,

465
00:27:59.701 --> 00:28:03.360
I learned that I love commercial.
I already read that part.
Sorry.
I'm,

466
00:28:03.361 --> 00:28:07.470
the sad truth is that the law student who emailed you will not listen to your

467
00:28:07.471 --> 00:28:11.730
advice.
He'll fend it.
Now that's not true,
sir.
Let's not super impose your life,

468
00:28:11.731 --> 00:28:14.730
but okay,
he'll finish law school since he's already committed.

469
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.210
If you ever get the chance,
tell him that after he ignores you.

470
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:21.900
He does not need to practice law.
A law degree opens a ton of doors,

471
00:28:21.901 --> 00:28:23.250
but the minute you take the bar,

472
00:28:23.251 --> 00:28:26.310
you commit yourself to a life of pain and unhappiness.

473
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.310
I'm not kidding of the hundred plus lawyers.

474
00:28:29.311 --> 00:28:31.650
I know not a single one likes their work.

475
00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:36.090
Every one of them will tell you not to go to law school,

476
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.940
walk away from the bar,
go become a broker.

477
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:43.230
Go teach at a JC junior college.
Go work for a business,

478
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:48.420
open a spear fishing business in Bali,
whatever.
Just don't go and take the bar.

479
00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:50.300
<v 0>Okay?</v>

480
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.280
<v 1>There are two reasons I'm writing you today.</v>

481
00:28:52.281 --> 00:28:57.080
The second that I want to commend you and say that you are not a cont,

482
00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:01.400
uh,
you speak your mind and using language you choose.

483
00:29:01.401 --> 00:29:06.020
You followed your clothes path and I've made the sacrifices necessary to later

484
00:29:06.021 --> 00:29:10.100
reap the rewards.
But more than that,
you have integrity and honor.
And for that,

485
00:29:10.101 --> 00:29:14.900
I thank you Jesus.
Dude,
don't put me on that pedestal.
I'm a fucking moron.
Um,

486
00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:16.790
and I have regrets to,

487
00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.690
I'll wake up in the middle of the night and start screaming like Ron Burgundy.

488
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.310
Ha.
Oh.

489
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.790
Trying to fucking get those thoughts of regret out of my head.

490
00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.380
We all have regrets,
sir.

491
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.120
And it's not too late for you to move to fucking Seattle.

492
00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:34.510
You know what stopping you from moving to Seattle,

493
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:39.220
one conversation with the fucking people you work with and a couple of suitcases

494
00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:44.560
that need to be filled.
That's it.
Who gives a fuck?

495
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.580
I'll tell you,
dude,
if you should,
you should follow your heart,
man.

496
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:49.580
And it's not too late.

497
00:29:49.581 --> 00:29:52.720
And don't give a fuck if you got a kids and you're married,
move them.

498
00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.090
All right?
Just move them up to save up some money.
Fucking move up there.

499
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:02.890
Live a little more modest.
It's a beautiful part of the country.
And uh,

500
00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:07.120
you know,
your kids will watch WWE,
they'll see somebody pursuing a dream.

501
00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.440
You'll be in a better mood.

502
00:30:08.441 --> 00:30:10.750
You'll be a better husband and father if you're married.
All right?

503
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:14.170
And if you single,
you got no fucking excuse.
All right,

504
00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:19.270
pack up all your three piece Matlock suits and go to Seattle.

505
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.040
Anyways,
a few months back,

506
00:30:21.041 --> 00:30:25.060
a listener wrote about how his girlfriend was upset because he went to a strip

507
00:30:25.061 --> 00:30:26.980
club and put oil on a woman's tits.

508
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:30.910
Your response was telling your advice was to reverse the situation.

509
00:30:30.911 --> 00:30:33.400
His mind then apologize.
It was brilliant.

510
00:30:33.401 --> 00:30:35.470
It was the advice that one man gives to another.

511
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:39.640
I could come up with countless examples,
but they'd all be saying the same thing.

512
00:30:39.641 --> 00:30:43.100
You tell you listeners to be fair and honest with their women,
do I?

513
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:46.360
I always think I come off as a misogynistic Douche bag there.

514
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:51.490
You tell the sad and depressed to try to get out and then seek help if on Abel

515
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.120
you tell your young to save their money and you tell people not to use drugs,

516
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:59.370
but for legitimate reasons.
Um,
I could go on and on,

517
00:30:59.371 --> 00:31:00.630
but I'd be repeating the point.

518
00:31:00.631 --> 00:31:05.310
Sad point is that your podcast demonstrates what it is to be a good man.

519
00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:09.210
Jesus Christ.
I was,
Nia was listening to this shit.
She'd be laughing our ass off.

520
00:31:09.211 --> 00:31:11.370
I appreciate this.
You said you Sarah,
good man.

521
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.940
Never let that voice in your head tell you otherwise.
Well,
listen,

522
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.520
<v 2>yeah.</v>

523
00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:20.390
<v 1>Uh,
I dunno.
It's killing me that you,</v>

524
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:25.000
that people like yourself,
your act,
you'd like,

525
00:31:25.001 --> 00:31:27.340
you're acting like wherever you live.

526
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:28.310
<v 2>Okay?</v>

527
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:32.840
<v 1>Between you and Seattle,
like you're in your,
you're behind,
you know,</v>

528
00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:38.150
the old fucking eastern block and there's a bunch of guard towers,
you know,

529
00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:42.560
and there's some sort of war zone between you and Seattle.
There isn't,
you know,

530
00:31:42.561 --> 00:31:46.580
sir,
you could actually practice law in Seattle.
You know,

531
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.310
if you just wanted to make money on the side,

532
00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:52.093
<v 2>you know</v>

533
00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.410
<v 1>this,
get this.
Listen,</v>

534
00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:55.740
<v 2>okay.</v>

535
00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:00.360
<v 1>Sit down tonight and figure out a fucking way to get your ass to Seattle.</v>

536
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:02.460
And I guarantee you,

537
00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:05.850
when you sit down and you start writing it out your game plan,

538
00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:09.660
you're going to feel the excitement that you,
that you're missing.

539
00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.560
Being a lawyer and being a lawyer is not a bad job.

540
00:32:13.561 --> 00:32:16.860
It's just not what you were supposed to do.
Okay?

541
00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:20.040
Because I guarantee you the same way you look at an airplane and you love every

542
00:32:20.041 --> 00:32:22.770
screw,
every spring,
every nook and cranny of an aircraft.

543
00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:27.430
There's lawyers who they loved the smell of a courtroom.

544
00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:30.660
They love that big wooden fucking desk.
They loved the closing argument.

545
00:32:30.661 --> 00:32:32.760
They loved that moment,
the turn,
you know,
whatever.

546
00:32:32.761 --> 00:32:37.260
What you just fucking flipping around on the other guy.
You know,

547
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.920
they love defending.
They prosecuting.

548
00:32:39.921 --> 00:32:43.520
They love the fucking sound of their shoes walking across the courtroom.

549
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:48.050
They love it.
They fucking love it.
You do not love it.

550
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.050
So my advice to you is

551
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.770
get your fucking ass to Seattle.
All right?

552
00:32:56.890 --> 00:33:00.910
Jesus Christ.
Who gives it?
What?
What are you worried about,
sir?

553
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:02.961
You're not going to have,

554
00:33:02.961 --> 00:33:07.940
you're not going to have a what do you not going to have flat screen TV doesn't

555
00:33:07.941 --> 00:33:10.460
cause shit.
Now y'all have enough,
dude,

556
00:33:10.461 --> 00:33:13.310
as long as you're willing to make the fucking sacrifice,
you can make it happen.

557
00:33:13.311 --> 00:33:15.440
All right,
well what's the matter?
What do,
what are you gonna you know?
Oh,

558
00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:19.370
I have to eat fucking great nuts every day.
Who gives a fuck?
You know,

559
00:33:19.371 --> 00:33:22.730
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch.
Who gives a fuck?

560
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.790
You know,
watched this thing on 60 minutes about fucking boy soldiers,
people,

561
00:33:28.791 --> 00:33:33.380
kids getting kidnapped turned into murderers,
you know,

562
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.120
don't even have a fucking childhood.

563
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:39.620
They get sucked right into fighting a goddamn war following this God damned

564
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:44.660
basically the closest thing to a Zombie I've ever seen in my life and their

565
00:33:44.661 --> 00:33:47.090
whole lives get fucking ruined.
You know,

566
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.020
you're a lawyer in a free country who wants to move to Seattle?

567
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:54.200
Don't fucking disappoint me.

568
00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:57.740
You better write me back and tell me you're in Seattle.
All right.

569
00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:02.930
But please,
for the love of God,
don't ever become a jaded pilot.

570
00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.210
Oh my God,
I'm so fucking bored with flying.

571
00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:11.630
I just have this feeling that I just want to push the fucking,
what is it?

572
00:34:11.631 --> 00:34:14.270
The yoke,
whatever the fuck they got.
Damn stick.

573
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:19.070
Sometimes I feel like I just want to push it forward.
Um,

574
00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:24.100
crazy x billion catching up on the podcast and you just told a story about a

575
00:34:24.681 --> 00:34:28.220
woman you used to date that threatened to kill you and then made a tin of

576
00:34:28.221 --> 00:34:32.810
brownies.
Yeah.
She said she was going to stab me.
She didn't say fatally.

577
00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:37.670
Umm,
that's where you ended the story,
Dude.

578
00:34:37.671 --> 00:34:40.640
How did you finally get rid of her in case you're wondering?
Yes,

579
00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:45.410
my life is that Dell that I actually give a shit how the story ends.
Uh,
no,

580
00:34:45.411 --> 00:34:48.420
I did kind of leave you hanging.
How did I get rid of her?
Um,

581
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.940
<v 2>okay.</v>

582
00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:53.000
<v 1>I was really young and naive and this is what she would do.</v>

583
00:34:53.001 --> 00:34:55.370
She would call me up and I would pick up the phone.

584
00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:58.130
This was before caller ID and shit.

585
00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:01.640
So I picked the phone up and it would be her and then it would be,
listen,

586
00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:02.690
I don't want to talk to you.

587
00:35:02.691 --> 00:35:07.430
And then she'd start crying and I was an idiot because I thought she was crying

588
00:35:07.431 --> 00:35:08.211
legitimately.

589
00:35:08.211 --> 00:35:13.211
I didn't realize that it was a manipulation tactic to make me feel bad and make

590
00:35:13.341 --> 00:35:15.950
me feel like I'm a fucking bully.
So I'd stay on the phone,

591
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:19.700
talk her down and be nice to her where she wasn't crying anymore.

592
00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:24.290
And then we would end with a nice ending to the phone conversation.

593
00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.540
But in her psycho stalker world,

594
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:30.470
that meant that we were somehow still connected and back together.

595
00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:32.660
And then she would call me again and I would say,
listen,

596
00:35:32.661 --> 00:35:36.110
I don't want to talk to you.
Then she'd start crying.
It was this fucking circle.

597
00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.440
I that I couldn't get out of cycle,
I should say.

598
00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:43.093
<v 2>MMM.</v>

599
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:46.100
<v 1>There's funny,
ever since Dan Cooks vicious circle came out.</v>

600
00:35:46.101 --> 00:35:48.650
I never say vicious cycle anymore.
It was a,

601
00:35:48.651 --> 00:35:52.100
it was a cycle I could not get out of.
Um,

602
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:56.360
so finally my manager at the time just says,
listen,
cause I said,

603
00:35:56.361 --> 00:36:00.860
what the fuck do I do?
He goes,
listen,
when she calls you pick up the phone.

604
00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:04.880
If it's her,
just hang up.
Just hang up.

605
00:36:04.881 --> 00:36:05.900
And that's what I just started doing.

606
00:36:05.901 --> 00:36:10.490
I would pick up the phone and she'd be like,
Billy and I would just click,

607
00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.830
I just fucking,
I just hang up.

608
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.620
<v 2>And uh,</v>

609
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.960
<v 1>within 10 days she stopped fucking calling me,</v>

610
00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:23.630
make granted at that point I was living on the other side of the country for

611
00:36:23.631 --> 00:36:26.690
half of the fucking time,
but I just kept,
I just kept hanging up.

612
00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.390
<v 2>And,
um,</v>

613
00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:33.030
<v 1>I did have the advantage,
like I said,
if not still being in the same city,</v>

614
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:36.990
but what you have to do is if you have a girl like that as you just aura guy,

615
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:38.820
well guy is different.

616
00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.750
I really feel bad for women when it comes to shit like that because guys,
um,

617
00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.753
you know,

618
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.150
I guess there are women out there that actually take it to some ridiculous

619
00:36:48.151 --> 00:36:51.840
violent level,
but obviously guys do it more often.
But I'm,

620
00:36:51.841 --> 00:36:55.770
so this is my advice for guys.
If you have some crazy lady and your fucking life,

621
00:36:55.771 --> 00:36:57.060
that's what you do.
You just gotta.

622
00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.730
You can't give him anything because people like that.

623
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:02.580
You give them one little fucking ray of light,

624
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:05.880
they latch onto that and they think you guys are getting fucking married or some

625
00:37:05.881 --> 00:37:06.714
shit.

626
00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:09.540
<v 2>Um,
all right.</v>

627
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:14.380
<v 1>The crazy ex,
that's how it ended.
I just stopped fucking,</v>

628
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:15.670
it's not really exciting.

629
00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:20.700
I just kept fucking hanging up on her and eventually she went away in every once

630
00:37:21.851 --> 00:37:26.770
in a while,
uh,
she would try to fucking reach back out and I just,

631
00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.210
just,
no,
just nothing.
Beat it.
Leave me alone.

632
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:37.090
I think she reached out and tried to friend me on my space a long time ago when

633
00:37:37.091 --> 00:37:39.700
I just did not accept it.
And then that was the last day of,
or heard of her.

634
00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:44.380
That's how you do it.
Um,
all right.
Cancer Lady.
Question.
Morning Bill.

635
00:37:44.381 --> 00:37:46.090
Big Fan.
Go Fuck Yourself.

636
00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.530
I've got myself into an inevitable situation and now needs some advice on how to

637
00:37:50.531 --> 00:37:54.580
get myself out of it.
A few months back,
I started seeing this girl who,

638
00:37:54.581 --> 00:37:58.870
a few weeks in found out she could potentially have cancer.
Oh,

639
00:37:58.871 --> 00:38:03.620
Gigi tion Jesus.
Dude.
Wow.
I wasn't an intern.

640
00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:06.670
I wasn't that into this girl to begin with,

641
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.770
but figured I'd have some fun and when the time came to end it I would.

642
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.860
But after she told me about the possible cancer diagnosis,

643
00:38:14.861 --> 00:38:19.350
I felt bad for wanting to end it.
So like an idiot,
I stuck around.
Uh,

644
00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:23.620
Jesus.
Well,
I,
if you're young,
I can't fault you for that.

645
00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.970
You know,
you now,
you think you're fucking doing or if you're doing her a favor,

646
00:38:27.971 --> 00:38:32.260
you're actually making it worse.
Ah.
Oh my God.
Dude,

647
00:38:32.261 --> 00:38:34.870
I'm getting like Deuce chills.
How do you get out of this?

648
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.280
Oh cause no matter what it's going to make it seem like you left because she had

649
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:42.580
cancer anyways.
A few months have passed and the cancer scare is over,

650
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:46.510
but now I'm stuck in this situation.
No you're not.
That's your green light.

651
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:50.230
Fucking screen doors open,
run out of there.
Needless to say,

652
00:38:50.231 --> 00:38:55.231
she's a lot more into this relationship than I am and I just want out and away

653
00:38:55.631 --> 00:39:00.220
from her maniac kids asap.
Dude,
I bet you fucking dimes to dollar.

654
00:39:00.221 --> 00:39:02.590
There was no cancer fucking scare.

655
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:06.970
I bet she did that to suck you into the fucking relationship.

656
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.960
I saw a thing on TV the other day and you know,
God knows if you see it on TV,

657
00:39:10.961 --> 00:39:13.720
it's gotta be true.
Some woman did that,

658
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:17.560
told everybody that she was dying of cancer,
including her fucking boyfriend.

659
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:22.970
The fuck head went ahead and married her
idiot.
Anyways,
he said,

660
00:39:22.971 --> 00:39:26.450
is there a smooth way out of this cluster fuck without making it obvious that I

661
00:39:26.451 --> 00:39:30.290
only stuck around cause of the cancer?
Is there a good exit strategy?

662
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:34.570
Thanks for the help and come to Toronto soon,
asshole.
Um,

663
00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.780
there's no smooth way out of a fucking relationship.
There isn't.

664
00:39:38.781 --> 00:39:41.210
You just have to sit down and say,
listen,
we need to talk.

665
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:42.560
<v 2>Okay.</v>

666
00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.160
<v 1>And then they go,
okay.
And you say,
listen,
I'm not,
I'm not happy.</v>

667
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:49.580
I'm not happy.
I think you're a great person and everything,

668
00:39:49.581 --> 00:39:54.581
but I'm just not feeling like you're the one boom right there.

669
00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:58.370
What did that take eight seconds to say that he'd just say it.
You just say it.

670
00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:03.050
Just say it and just get it out there and then the flood,
the fucking chips fall.

671
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:07.340
She's gonna to cry.
She might scream,
she might throw shit out yet,
you know,

672
00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:11.870
neighbors will be peeking through their cartons,
but just say that.

673
00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:17.480
Okay.
She might try to get you to fucking go back into,
you know,
manipulate.

674
00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:19.760
What do,
maybe we can work it out.
Would you want to talk to them?

675
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:22.440
<v 3>Maybe we could talk to somebody about it.</v>

676
00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.470
<v 1>I know I just,</v>

677
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:29.130
this is truly what I'm feeling and it isn't fair to you for me to continue

678
00:40:29.131 --> 00:40:29.941
sticking around.

679
00:40:29.941 --> 00:40:32.550
It's just preventing you from meeting the person you're supposed to be with.

680
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:36.090
And myself also,
I'm sorry,
I feel horrible,

681
00:40:36.091 --> 00:40:39.600
but I have to be honest with you and you can't fuck with that.

682
00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:42.270
And then you're out.
I mean,
no,
you're not out.

683
00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:46.320
You got to sit through another hundred 80 minutes of fucking histrionics and

684
00:40:46.321 --> 00:40:50.250
everything,
but,
but you're out.
Okay.
And you just sit down and tell yourself,
sir,

685
00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:52.800
that you know what?
Today at two o'clock in the afternoon,

686
00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.980
I'm talking to my girlfriend soon to be my ex girlfriend.
And you know what?

687
00:40:56.130 --> 00:41:01.130
From two o'clock to five o'clock is going to suck fucking donkey fucking balls.

688
00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:05.340
All right,
but five oh one on is going to be great.

689
00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:06.813
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

690
00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:11.470
<v 1>All right.
This is like,
you're a fucking junkie.
I saw that on a,
uh,
doctor,</v>

691
00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:14.690
um,
and I was fucking doctor shows

692
00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:19.220
the fuck is it?
I can't remember shit anymore.

693
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:23.420
He was basically talking about how addicts will go through fucking eight nine 10

694
00:41:23.421 --> 00:41:28.421
years of hell because they don't want to go through 10 days of a of detox.

695
00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:35.240
Rather than dealing with 10 days of retching and vomiting and feeling like

696
00:41:35.241 --> 00:41:39.260
you're fuck,
you're like your fingernails hurt.
10 days of that,

697
00:41:39.261 --> 00:41:41.870
you're going to go through 10 days of hell and be living out on the fucking

698
00:41:41.871 --> 00:41:45.320
street just to avoid those 10 days of fucking withdrawals.

699
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.780
That's what you're doing.
If you stay in a fucking relationship,

700
00:41:47.781 --> 00:41:51.620
you don't want to be all right.
Just get the fuck out.

701
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:56.390
Get out now and make me proud.
All right,
dilemma.
Dear bill,

702
00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:01.040
your Monday morning podcasts has become religion over the past five weeks.

703
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.971
I came to see it,

704
00:42:01.971 --> 00:42:06.470
the PABST theater in Milwaukee a year ago or so and have been a fan ever since.

705
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:09.620
I just thought I might bring to your attention to question that my roommates and

706
00:42:09.621 --> 00:42:11.660
I disagree upon completely.

707
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:16.520
I'm in a fight to the death against an opponent of equal size,

708
00:42:16.521 --> 00:42:20.150
strength and skill.
Which weapon would you rather have on your side?

709
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:25.450
A 20 ounce hammer with a nail nail removing hook on the end or a 28 ounce

710
00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:33.170
wouldn't Louisville slugger?
The question is,
that's not even as a joke.

711
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:34.401
Question is,

712
00:42:34.401 --> 00:42:38.330
which is the better weapon and your opponent is essentially you the fucking

713
00:42:38.331 --> 00:42:42.900
Louisville slugger.
Without a fucking doubt.

714
00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:46.170
Louisville slugger.
I can get you from a distance.

715
00:42:46.171 --> 00:42:48.900
What the fuck are you gonna do with Your Hammer?
You got a hammer,

716
00:42:48.901 --> 00:42:51.930
you've got to get insight.
Let's,
you're going to throw it at me and I got a bat.

717
00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.780
I'll fucking hit it right back at Ya.
I'll hit it over your head.

718
00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:59.840
Now you have no fucking weapon and now I'm coming right doing that fucking over,

719
00:42:59.941 --> 00:43:04.140
under,
over,
under,
right in front of my face.
I could do it.

720
00:43:04.141 --> 00:43:08.140
I could literally have that thing.
Okay.
I bet.
I bet.
Fucking right handed.

721
00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:13.550
They're the secrets over.
You now know my stats throws right batch.
Fucking right.

722
00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:19.140
Um,
drums,
right,
plays guitar,
lefty rights,
lefty.

723
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:24.000
I'm all over the fucking map,
so I fucking,
I'd have it in my left hand.

724
00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:28.260
My,
my front hand.
Like,
if I was up at bat and I would come in,

725
00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.050
do a couple step in,
step out,
step in,
step out,

726
00:43:31.051 --> 00:43:33.060
and then I just fucking wacky and your shit.

727
00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:36.360
And as you did that stupid little hop.
I'm coming up top now.

728
00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:41.820
Um,
first I'm doing short,
quick ones real quick.

729
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:45.120
Fucking you up so you count.
You know,
so you don't catch the bat.

730
00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:47.940
And then as you really start getting fucked up,
then I'm there.

731
00:43:47.941 --> 00:43:49.170
Now I'm going for a double,

732
00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:53.190
then I'm going up the fucking goddamn warning track and then that's it.

733
00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.260
And I'm swinging for a home run and you're fucking done.

734
00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.250
Split your head like a fucking melon.
Fuck you in and you and your hammer.

735
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:02.480
It's over.
Um,

736
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:06.380
whoever's picking the hammer is his thinking.

737
00:44:06.381 --> 00:44:10.570
Like what would I rather get hit with once with a bat at once with a hammer?

738
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:13.820
Hammers made on a metal bats made out of wood.

739
00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:19.430
What's the stronger fucking material?
Obviously of God Damn Hammer.
Right?
Metal.

740
00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.580
All right.
But what they're not thinking about is the distance.

741
00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.410
You don't want one.
She went,
she emailed.

742
00:44:24.411 --> 00:44:28.670
Why don't you call on the Joe Rogan podcast,
Joe Rogan experience.

743
00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.740
You'd be able to break that down.
All people.
You know what,

744
00:44:31.741 --> 00:44:35.580

748
00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:53.030

Really?
But that,

749
00:44:53.031 --> 00:44:56.420
that's the promo that I get up.
She's fucking,

750
00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:01.970
Baron von recorded a half hour special on March 11th for comedy central.

751
00:45:01.971 --> 00:45:06.890
Lookout for it.
So to Joe to Roseau over there.

752
00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:08.450
<v 0>yeah.</v>

753
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:11.810

755
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.510

Um,

756
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:26.030
I'm an idiot.
I can't even fucking read this shit.
What's wrong with me?

757
00:45:26.031 --> 00:45:26.401
You know what?

758
00:45:26.401 --> 00:45:30.830
Lemme just gonna read the final law advertisement for this week and then I'm

759
00:45:30.831 --> 00:45:34.070
going to tell you a funny story.
Actually,
I'm not,
I just said that.

760
00:45:34.071 --> 00:45:36.470
I'm going to tell you a funny story because I wanted you to fucking hang in

761
00:45:36.471 --> 00:45:38.990
there.
That's what I did.
You see what he did there?

762
00:45:38.991 --> 00:45:41.960
I just fucking lie to you after that lawyer said that I was a great man.

763
00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:46.520
I just lied to you.
Um,
I,
oh,
I know what the teaser,

764
00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:50.230
remember I was talking about Ting at the beginning of this podcast.

765
00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:54.640
Now you think in,
what is Ting?
Ting is a mobile service mobile.

766
00:45:54.641 --> 00:45:59.620
That makes sense.
Ting is no a no BS mobile service.
Uh,

767
00:45:59.621 --> 00:46:04.621
it's an M v n o reseller of the national nationwide Spiritan network.

768
00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:10.690
Uh,
they got a new hotspot.
They've just added a three g slash four g.

769
00:46:10.691 --> 00:46:12.820
Why Max Hotspot to the Ting lineup.

770
00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:17.770
