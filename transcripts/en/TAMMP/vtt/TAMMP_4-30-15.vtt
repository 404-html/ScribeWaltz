00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.210
Hey,
how are you?
How are you everybody?
It's bill bar.

2
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.640
Just check it
here on a Thursday afternoon,

3
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:15.390
just before Friday for the Monday morning podcast on a Thursday,

4
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:18.720
just before Friday during the Thursday afternoon that I'm actually recording on

5
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:21.120
a Wednesday,
um,

6
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.770
appear in Chattanooga,
Chattanooga.

7
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.330
Um,
on our way up to Lexington,
Lexington,
Lexington,

8
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.360
Kentucky and a continuing along this long journey through the south,

9
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.470
through the fucking south.
I was your last couple of days,
but yeah.

10
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.400
Did you go to the gym?
Do eat some fucking frosting.

11
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.780
Did you hate yourself afterwards?
I hate myself.

12
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:50.460
I hate what I do that do you know,

13
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:54.510
last night I went over to an intimate cake,

14
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.360
not two,
not three,

15
00:00:57.361 --> 00:01:02.100
four fingers swiped across the stop top of it and stuck it in my mouth.

16
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.360
You ever see a baby eat how they stick their whole hand in their mouth?

17
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.820
I was doing that
and it was like,

18
00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:13.660
why am I doing this?
The next thing you know,
I had the frosting,

19
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.930
I was losing my hair with it.
I was a Meth,

20
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.210
but I woke up the next day and there was a song in my head.

21
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.350
I go to the gym everyday,
it just become popping up.
Um,

22
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.860
I've actually been doing all right,
but I've been eating like an asshole today,

23
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.890
today,
like an asshole.
We,
uh,

24
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.930
picked up a law heads dad along the way out in Alabama and we stopped.
Uh,

25
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.530
they made us a homemade meal a lot.
His mom medicine,

26
00:01:44.531 --> 00:01:49.000
these homemade meal of bras and right down the street,
you know,

27
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.630
what was one of those,
a barbecue places.

28
00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:57.631
My favorite barbecue place in all of Alabama is a sauce.

29
00:01:57.941 --> 00:02:02.941
Barbecue stands for smart ass Wilsons and they got this white barbecue sauce

30
00:02:03.371 --> 00:02:06.220
that they put on the chicken and it's just,
it's fucking amazing.

31
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.530
And of course I had to get that too.
So we got that.

32
00:02:08.531 --> 00:02:10.870
We got on the bus and we're like,
well wait,
wait.

33
00:02:10.871 --> 00:02:12.070
We have for dinner we had for dinner.

34
00:02:12.071 --> 00:02:15.910
And we just kept smelling it and we were like,
all right,
fuck it.
All right.

35
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.220
Hey Dad stuff.
It was delicious.
Couple of Miller high life and,

36
00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:26.020
um,
I know you go,
I just gave away like five days at the gym.
What a fucking dope.

37
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.850
Huh?
Do you know what his life to walk the earth as a freckle dope?
I do.

38
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.740
And it's all gonna be in Mike Book that comes out never.
Um,

39
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.960
anyways,
let's,
let's,
let's get on it.
It just make a noise.

40
00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:45.810
I'd let less debt.
Let's get on the fucking,
uh,
you know,
if you knew what the,

41
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.840
the Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcasts,
you know,

42
00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:51.130
I just check in on you.

43
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.910
I do a little half hour thing just to get your view a little hump days here,

44
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.430
right?
You pay days.
You know,
I've been saying that you guys get paid on Thursday.

45
00:02:59.431 --> 00:03:03.330
That's how it was back when I had a job,
when I had a real fucking job.
You know,

46
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.400
and I guess you guys get paid on Friday now and God knows the women don't make

47
00:03:08.401 --> 00:03:11.100
as much as the men.
Um,

48
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.960
and men don't care.
Why would they?

49
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.090
They're winning in that scenario.
Sorry.

50
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.300
I think it's a tragedy.
I think it's a tragedy that when you know you,

51
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.110
you're down at the subway sandwich store and you take out fucking five slices of

52
00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:34.260
that process,
gray meat and put it on a God damn piece of bread.

53
00:03:34.261 --> 00:03:37.650
You don't make the same amount of money that is out rages.

54
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.300
And uh,
good luck to you guys trying to turn that around because,

55
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.570
uh,
I got my own problems.

56
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.560
I'll do what everybody else does.
I'll be,

57
00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:52.080
I god add his own right and then I'll just get on with my life.

58
00:03:52.081 --> 00:03:56.010
Like all those douchebags who stood up during Oscar night when,
uh,

59
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.740
the chick from fucking true romance said whatever she said,

60
00:03:58.741 --> 00:04:01.680
then everybody stood up and applauded and then everything remained the same.

61
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.460
They went right back to it.
You know,
isn't that what always happens?

62
00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:09.060
We needed to clean up the rivers and everybody hip that Bra and nobody sits down

63
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.190
promptly,
goes upside takes off this suspenders.
And what do they do?

64
00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:17.070
They take a dump right in the river.
It's how it works.

65
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.060
Anybody's a good shit when the TV cameras aren't.
Um,
all right,

66
00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:24.330
so here's the deal.
If you want them to just have me go off on some shit,

67
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.010
you know,
you just,
just a Hashtag,

68
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.560
uh,
the MMP,
no,
that's not what you want to do.
I am the fucking worst.

69
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.820
Don't listen to me here.
You hashtag t a m m p.

70
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.890
That's it.
I finally got it.

71
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.220
Send it to at the m m podcast and then Hashtag t a m m p tango.

72
00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:52.890
Alpha Mike,
Mike,
Papa.
All right,
there you go.
That's what I need you to do.

73
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.330
And then I'll just go off on shit.
And uh,
as always,
let's check in.
Let's,

74
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.250
what I'll do on Thursdays.

75
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.390
<v 2>Look into,
let's check in on the world of nothing.
What's going on this week.</v>

76
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.960
All right?
Evidently Bud light.
You know,

77
00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:08.880
they got that fucking thing where they,
uh,

78
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.180
somebody just comes in and they're like,
are you up for anything?

79
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.350
And the guy's like,
Holy Shit,
you're that guy from that thing.

80
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.191
And next thing you know,

81
00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:20.880
he's at a concert and then he's shooting pool with the captain Kirk,

82
00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:24.220
or whatever the fuck happens for the most,
Bro.

83
00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:28.790
Tastic fucking evening of their lives.
Run for your wife's right.

84
00:05:28.791 --> 00:05:32.130
It's the greatest night of your fucking life,
thanks to bud light.

85
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.050
So they for some reason on their,
on their beer bottle,
put uh,

86
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.410
the perfect beer for removing no from your vocabulary for the night.

87
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.840
Hashtag up for whatever.

88
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.470
Now how they didn't realize that this was just going to get the clamp culture

89
00:05:49.471 --> 00:05:52.650
all fucking stir it up right there.
I mean it's fucking over.

90
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.090
And they flipped out and they were just like,
oh thanks a lot bud light.

91
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.470
Thank you for promoting

92
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.400
<v 1>rape culture.
You know,
and they're all sitting there.
Oh No.</v>

93
00:06:02.401 --> 00:06:03.570
We were trying to get a,

94
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.410
we would try to get people to buy our boots.

95
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.550
We were not trying to advocate rape.

96
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.440
I love other,
did they really think that?
That that's what they were doing here.

97
00:06:16.441 --> 00:06:21.270
These women think it capital letters.
This is an okay.

98
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.520
Uh,
no means no.

99
00:06:23.521 --> 00:06:28.521
This ad perpetuates rape culture and we're hashtag not buying it.

100
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.230
I like how women are acting like they buy bud light.

101
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.230
What was the last time you saw a woman going to buy a fucking 12 pack of Bud

102
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.500
Light?

103
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.370
Bud light is for middle aged white dudes who were buttoned down shirts and a

104
00:06:42.371 --> 00:06:43.890
coming out the side of them.
Right.

105
00:06:43.891 --> 00:06:47.160
And they just ate a fucking broad and now they're trying to lighten up the real

106
00:06:47.161 --> 00:06:50.040
shit.
I'm talking about me.
Um,

107
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.050
what else we got here?
A Bud light sweetheart.
Look,

108
00:06:55.051 --> 00:06:58.010
people are criticizing bud light's new tagline,

109
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.700
claiming that it promotes rape culture.
Uh,
this is not a good slogan.

110
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.530
I know that you want us to have fun but say yes to life.
I don't know.

111
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.570
It's one of these things that people get flipping out.

112
00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:11.400
They're obviously not advocating rape,
but I mean,

113
00:07:11.401 --> 00:07:14.370
how the fuck do you know with w w when you're making booze,

114
00:07:14.371 --> 00:07:17.480
how do you not see this shit storm coming?
I'm actually going side.

115
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.020
I'm not going to say bud lights fucking morons for not seeing that shit storm

116
00:07:22.021 --> 00:07:25.800
coming.
You know what I mean?
I mean,
at this point,
if,
if,
uh,

117
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.450
if you leave the microwave door ajar in your home,

118
00:07:30.451 --> 00:07:35.210
you're somehow advocating rape culture suggesting that women's legs like the,

119
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.540
the,
the microwave door should also be a jar,
right?
Are you?

120
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:44.310
I don't know what all I know is it's a very strange climate.

121
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.390
Little all those fucking words that they use.
Um,
all right.

122
00:07:48.391 --> 00:07:52.320
What else do we got here?
Hey Bill,
you've got to talk about this story.

123
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.610
Not enough room to explain.
Uh,

124
00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.030
just more women needing apologies.
Why don't more women right into this?

125
00:08:00.031 --> 00:08:02.520
Why do you guys just listen to me and go,
this guy's a cave man.

126
00:08:02.521 --> 00:08:04.230
I don't want to listen to them.
Can we fuck it?

127
00:08:04.231 --> 00:08:07.620
Balances out a perfume from dead people?
Well,

128
00:08:07.621 --> 00:08:10.740
how do you not click on this perfume from dead Chevelle?

129
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.840
Okay.
Company makes perfume that smells like deceased loved ones.

130
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.000
This isn't real.

131
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.190
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

132
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.740
<v 1>Does anything smell grosser than your fucking grandparents?</v>

133
00:08:22.741 --> 00:08:27.420
Right before they die,
they vote.
The decomposition is already,
it's already begun.

134
00:08:27.421 --> 00:08:29.190
Right?
Having Sake,

135
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:34.470
are you guys having trouble saying goodbye to a loved one who passed away and

136
00:08:34.471 --> 00:08:36.270
you're just bottling up your emotions,

137
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.430
bottled up their scent in perfume and perfume for for 600.

138
00:08:41.431 --> 00:08:46.431
Buck Buck's Sean Dowling has more TV and more details on this wacky story.

139
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.960
I'll give me a fucking break.
Jesus Christ.
Let it go,

140
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.180
dude.
That is so fucking creepy.

141
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.360
It's funny when you're talking about grandparents.

142
00:08:57.361 --> 00:09:01.560
Everything else that's fucking creepy.
That's like some serial killer shit.

143
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.860
You want like a fucking trophy?
Um,
all right.
This is,
this is rough.

144
00:09:06.861 --> 00:09:09.180
Do we already got dead people and rape already?
I this,

145
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:12.270
this is the direction I want to go to,
right?
All right.

146
00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:17.010
Best the guy you've ever had and was it,
uh,
was it the cigar?

147
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.710
Okay.
You know what?
I'm really figuring out with all this shit.

148
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:23.340
This is just involving me having to read out loud even more.

149
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:29.550
Um,
all right,
we are collecting outrage was Duh,
Duh,
Duh.

150
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.590
Let me scroll.
Oh wait,
Mcdonald's.
Hey,

151
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:33.530
did you guys see Mcdonald's is closing some,
uh,

152
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.890
Mcdonald's had to start closing some stores.
Did I already talk about this?

153
00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:38.910
I can't fucking remember.

154
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.480
I was talking the other day how our food supplies basically become poison.

155
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.010
And I got a couple of people sending me,

156
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.520
hey bill care to send me some links to some of your research.
It did.

157
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.740
I understand I'm worthy of that criticism.

158
00:09:52.741 --> 00:09:56.430
But also if you're really going to sit there and try to tell me that I'm at not

159
00:09:56.431 --> 00:10:01.170
at least half right on how fucked up our food supply is right now.

160
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.160
All right,
I'll give you this right now.
Here's my,
I'll cite this source.

161
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.570
When I was a kid,

162
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.890
a chicken was like maybe one or two weight classes above a fucking pit pigeon.

163
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.860
And I'm not talking about a Cornish hen.
Alright,
some little fucking partridge.

164
00:10:15.861 --> 00:10:16.021
I'm,

165
00:10:16.021 --> 00:10:21.021
I'm talking about a full size adult chicken that lived a whole life,

166
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.950
accomplished his dreams before it got its head fucking lopped off.

167
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:31.460
Now like chickens look like Mark McGuire in 1998 they're fucking gigantic.

168
00:10:32.461 --> 00:10:36.240
They're like Turkey Juniors.
So like what,
what are the chickens doing now?

169
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.420
Aren't they hitting the gym?
Sorry.

170
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:46.740
Um,
to doing depth drinking some protein shakes.

171
00:10:46.741 --> 00:10:50.010
Give me a fucking break.
Give me a fucking break.

172
00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:54.810
I don't trust anything and that does not make me somebody with a tin foil hat
on.

173
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.600
It makes me fucking smart.
I love how the,
the,

174
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:02.460
the cigarette people for years sat there and they were like,

175
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.370
I don't think nicotine is addictive.
Then they passed.
And another guy,

176
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:09.050
I do not think nicotine is addictive.
When I sat each pick a date,

177
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.270
is that a thing?
They all knew it was.
They didn't give a fuck.
All right.

178
00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:14.970
But that's what they hitched their wagons to.
So they continued to lie.

179
00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.910
He look at the fucking bankers that lie at that level.

180
00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:21.090
Everybody lies at that fucking La.
Everybody lies in general,
right?

181
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.680
Forget about when there's a bunch of money whores and power involved,
right?

182
00:11:25.681 --> 00:11:28.920
Food is no different.
Why would you trust those cuts?

183
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:34.020
You know,
I don't know.
But you know what?
Go ahead and do it.

184
00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.400
Have at it for as much as I sit here and Bitch Moan and complain about it,

185
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.500
I actually tried to eat like totally a farmer's market.

186
00:11:43.501 --> 00:11:47.970
All of that stuff.
It was practically impossible.
First of all,

187
00:11:47.971 --> 00:11:50.340
you go down in the farmer's markets and the big farms,

188
00:11:50.341 --> 00:11:53.600
they're already in there and they just can legally have like,
you know,

189
00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.890
they're fucking products called,
uh,
you know,
home grown Eddie's,
you know,

190
00:11:57.891 --> 00:12:00.530
and that's just the name of some giant corporation that's got,
you know,

191
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.750
God knows what and they're fucking food.
Right.

192
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.620
And when I actually went to this farmer's market,
I was like,

193
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.220
I wanted to buy a chicken that it was just a fucking chicken.
Right.

194
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.470
I didn't want to buy a,

195
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:17.270
who's that guy who fucking ran that race and beat Carl Lewis,
the Ben Johnson.

196
00:12:17.271 --> 00:12:21.080
I didn't want the Ben Johnson fucking a chicken,
you know,

197
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.950
and this guy had all these things they all say,

198
00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:26.900
and the organic also their own natural.
And I pointed each one of them.

199
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.030
I forgot the question I was supposed to ask.

200
00:12:29.031 --> 00:12:31.820
I learned it in this documentary and ass and the guy shook his head no,

201
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.490
once the next one shook his head.
No.
I said,

202
00:12:34.491 --> 00:12:37.670
where is one that just was a fucking chicken and eight what chickens ate in the

203
00:12:37.671 --> 00:12:41.000
1920s.
And he goes all the way down there.
And I looked at it and I was like,

204
00:12:41.001 --> 00:12:42.860
that's a fucking chicken.
And he goes,
yeah,

205
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.980
that's what they look like when you don't fucking,

206
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.190
when they don't have the same workout program is Lal.
Elsedo right.

207
00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.170
So whatever,
don't listen to me.
Don't give a fuck.
Laugh at me.

208
00:12:57.171 --> 00:12:58.460
Think I'm a fucking moron.

209
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.060
But just realize you're not a fucking scientist either.
Okay.

210
00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:03.860
I don't believe anything.

211
00:13:03.861 --> 00:13:06.860
When I was watching those Baltimore riots and they came up with that,

212
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.290
we in credible sources that the gangs,

213
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:12.590
you have all gone,
uh,

214
00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:16.850
called each other up and have decided to attack the police as one collective

215
00:13:16.851 --> 00:13:21.410
unit.
I mean,
did you actually sit there and go,
oh my God,

216
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:26.460
am I watching warriors or is this really happening?
Uh,

217
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:31.160
that reeked of a horse shit.
Either somebody just made that up.

218
00:13:31.161 --> 00:13:33.110
Or if I'm on the cop side,
I'm going like,
look,

219
00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.950
we've got to crack some skulls here to get this fucking thing under control,

220
00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.920
but God knows they're going to be filming all of this and we're going to have

221
00:13:39.921 --> 00:13:44.210
even more problems.
So,
uh,
let's try to get out in front of this thing.

222
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.860
Anybody got any ideas?
Uh,
you there in the back?

223
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:52.510
<v 2>Oh,
what if we say,
uh,
uh,</v>

224
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:56.390
there's a black zombies and uh,

225
00:13:56.391 --> 00:13:58.820
they got a bulla and their teeth.

226
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.740
<v 1>All right.
That's,
you know,
it's a little out there,
but yeah,</v>

227
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.320
you're on the right track.
What are you already got the fucking,
uh,
McMurtry.

228
00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:10.270
All right,
finally somebody goes,
what have you just say the gangs,
the gangs,

229
00:14:10.271 --> 00:14:14.160
all organized
site.
Incredible.

230
00:14:14.161 --> 00:14:17.770
Falafels um,
Jesus Christ.
What a shit show.

231
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:20.350
What a shit show.
It was that deep.

232
00:14:20.351 --> 00:14:24.490
Was that deep enough for you might take on Baltimore.
Jesus Christ.

233
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:29.730
What a shit show says bill burr enough said topic over Ryan ended.

234
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.470
You know,
if they just had me say that from a hot air balloon,
so I seem neutral.

235
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:37.203
All right.

236
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.950
And I just yelled at through a bull horn down at the people by just yelled down,

237
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:48.940
crying.
What a shit show.
It would be over,
you know,

238
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.990
and they won't let me,
you know why?
Because the government want it.
Sorry.

239
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:58.300
All right,
let's get to some more of this shit here.
Um,
where am I going here?

240
00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.480
I like acting like a fucking moron on this because it makes people feel smart.

241
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.870
Right?
You guys all get the fucking give me shit.
Gi Bill.

242
00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:07.810
I thought I was fucking dumb,
but x,
Y and Z.
Go fuck yourself.

243
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.910
You just as stupid as I am.
All right bill,

244
00:15:09.911 --> 00:15:13.390
why do you think Tim Teebo still gets chances to play in the league?

245
00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.110
Is Jesus really looking out for him?
Um,

246
00:15:17.111 --> 00:15:21.720
I think cause he sells a ton of fucking jerseys.
He's a star,
uh,

247
00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.790
without the statue.
He's a status star,

248
00:15:24.791 --> 00:15:29.260
but he's got all that other stuff and uh,
you know,
come on man.

249
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.060
There's not nothing sells fucking jerseys across America.

250
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:39.010
Like a white guy that plays sports.
That's a virgin.

251
00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.920
That's into Jesus.
I mean that's,

252
00:15:40.921 --> 00:15:45.910
it's fucking over marketing teams that just jerking off.
It's just,

253
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:50.200
it's,
he did the,
I guess that's what,

254
00:15:50.201 --> 00:15:52.280
I guess that's why it would be,
but I would just think that the,

255
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.900
the Patriots sign them cause they were trying to get Aaron Hernandez under

256
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.670
control.
And I guess,
you know,
I don't know.

257
00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:02.440
The rumor was that when they both played at Florida that Tim Teebo would,
uh,

258
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:04.871
would,
would,
I don't know,

259
00:16:04.871 --> 00:16:09.871
he would like sing some Christian songs to Aaron Hernandez before games.

260
00:16:09.941 --> 00:16:10.774
So he,
you know,

261
00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:16.140
keep in mind that Jesus Christ has died for us.

262
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:19.800
Hey Aaron,
don't shoot anybody.

263
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.780
We're playing South Carolina.

264
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.900
Keep your head on a swivel.
Um,

265
00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:28.931
you know what I'm gonna do tonight?

266
00:16:28.931 --> 00:16:30.770
Cause I'm actually going to root for the fucking,
uh,

267
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.730
I got a roof for Tampa Bay to beat Detroit even though I like original six teams

268
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:41.440
because they've,
they fucking own the Canadians.
That's all I'm doing here.

269
00:16:41.441 --> 00:16:43.930
I'm just rooting against the Canadians.
It's a very negative year for me.

270
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:48.010
You know what I make is my team didn't make it so now just as fucking sad sack,

271
00:16:48.011 --> 00:16:51.820
bitter cont sitting on the right in the fucking front row,

272
00:16:51.821 --> 00:16:56.050
frosting up the glass,
just hoping they're going to fucking lose.
Actually,

273
00:16:56.051 --> 00:16:58.850
I've been touring so much admin time to watch anything.
Um,

274
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.300
I know there was some big hit in the last game that got uh,
uh,

275
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.210
a Detroit guy suspended.

276
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.770
I guess he came up off his skates is what I'm guessing you can't get mad at him

277
00:17:08.771 --> 00:17:11.950
cause it was a fucking head shot.
The guy was bent over at the waist.
I mean,

278
00:17:11.951 --> 00:17:16.720
what are you supposed to do?
Um,
I dunno.

279
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.010
I have no idea.
But I will be rooting for Tampa Bay and uh,

280
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.300
hopefully they'll fucking win and then immediately I'll start rooting against

281
00:17:25.301 --> 00:17:30.070
them because the Stanley Cup should not be in Florida ever.
It just shouldn't be.

282
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.790
You don't deserve it.
First of all,
to me that ice,

283
00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.790
I don't know if you guys and all that down to Florida,
it's going to melt.
Okay.

284
00:17:36.791 --> 00:17:41.140
Just keep that in mind.
Um,
anyways,
what else do I got here?
Uh,
Bill,

285
00:17:41.141 --> 00:17:44.170
check this out to see how crazy smart crows are.

286
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.940
There has to be some gold here.
Crows.
A smart,
well,

287
00:17:48.941 --> 00:17:53.840
I guess we know what kind of bird I wouldn't be
animal.

288
00:17:55.490 --> 00:18:00.140
What the fuck is wrong with people?
Animal.
I came to say cognition.

289
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:04.220
Crows understand water displacement.
Oh,
I've seen this

290
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:07.100
cro keeps putting what up,

291
00:18:07.101 --> 00:18:12.101
putting rocks in a cylinder to make the water come up so it can finally take a

292
00:18:12.501 --> 00:18:13.334
sip out of it.

293
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:15.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

294
00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.340
<v 1>Evidently this is amazing.</v>

295
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:21.380
Have they tried this with the other birds or is it just this one?

296
00:18:21.381 --> 00:18:26.010
Does a seagull just sit there and be like,
I can't fucking Drake it man.
Um,

297
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.910
Jesus Christ,
this looks like a fucking science test.
I flunked.
All right.

298
00:18:31.911 --> 00:18:34.520
I've had enough of these fucking hashtag things so well do when it's making me

299
00:18:34.521 --> 00:18:39.140
feel dumb.
Feeling like a Goddamn dope.
Um,
all right.
So we got,

300
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.420
we've done nine out of 11,
ladies and gentlemen,

301
00:18:41.421 --> 00:18:45.710
nine out of 11 stops on the Billy Bible belter and it's been amazing.

302
00:18:45.711 --> 00:18:48.830
We were in Mobile Ama,
Alabama,
uh,

303
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:53.190
last night and I would stop mobile.
Uh,
was um,

304
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:57.380
an English name.
You know,
I thought English settlers came up with that.

305
00:18:57.381 --> 00:19:00.950
I had to realize that it was a French colony and it was actually a French word.

306
00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.340
And uh,
I dunno,

307
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.760
they lost some fucking war next to know the English had it and then the Spanish

308
00:19:07.761 --> 00:19:11.330
had it.
And then we had,
it had no idea.
The only thing I knew about mobile,

309
00:19:11.331 --> 00:19:16.160
Alabama was Ken Burns the war and,
uh,
some Martin Luther King thing,

310
00:19:16.161 --> 00:19:18.620
I don't know if he got,
took a rock to the head or something like that.

311
00:19:18.621 --> 00:19:19.580
I was at that March.

312
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.340
We had the white shirt and he was bleeding and he had the fucking handkerchief.

313
00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.060
Everybody had handkerchiefs back then.
Just how classy people dressed.

314
00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.030
Like al was.
Martin Luther King when he died,

315
00:19:29.031 --> 00:19:33.470
he's probably like 10 years younger than me.
Maybe because he like 38,
39,

316
00:19:33.471 --> 00:19:35.900
maybe 40.
Just the way everybody dressed,

317
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.350
walking around shirt and tie suit.

318
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:41.090
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

319
00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:45.890
<v 1>Fucking handkerchief.
Nobody dresses like that anymore.
Everybody look at me.</v>

320
00:19:45.891 --> 00:19:47.420
I dress like,
I believe I'm sitting here right now.

321
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.490
I go to and sweat pants and a tee shirt.
I could go to church like this,
you know,

322
00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:55.310
people will,
some people,
older people would frown upon it,
but it'd be,

323
00:19:55.311 --> 00:19:57.710
it'd be considered.
Okay.
Um,

324
00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.130
I'm actually considering dressing up for the,
uh,

325
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.060
<v 0>yeah,</v>

326
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.900
<v 1>the Lexington,
Kentucky show.
My,
where my,
where my derby outfit,</v>

327
00:20:06.901 --> 00:20:10.980
but I don't know if I can fucking handle having that God sport coat on for my

328
00:20:10.981 --> 00:20:12.030
entire show.
You know,

329
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.480
I think sport coats if for people that know how to write jokes,

330
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:19.440
but guys like mate,
you know where it's a lot of cursing and silly faces.
I mean,

331
00:20:19.441 --> 00:20:23.490
I got a flail the arms around,
right.
Anyways,

332
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:25.260
I've been,
uh,

333
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.710
last night's show and mobile might've been that one in the Memphis one.

334
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.770
New Orleans was great.
Just was like a,

335
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:36.770
they were all great.
Knoxville,
you don't chat a Nigga.
When we played that place,

336
00:20:36.771 --> 00:20:39.170
I didn't realize that it was an old hockey rink.

337
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:43.040
I had no idea it should be such an amazing tour.
But uh,

338
00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.340
I'm not as young as I used to be.
People.
Well,
who's kidding?
Who?

339
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:51.100
Nobody is you dumb.
Fuck is somebody young,
younger than they used to be?

340
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.833
Um,

341
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.800
I'm feeling my age on this one to two weeks out is a long goddamn time,

342
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.150
right?
I can't fucking handle this shit anymore.
I'm going to have to,

343
00:21:04.151 --> 00:21:07.390
I'm going to do like fucking week long tours.
That's what I'm going to do.

344
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.870
And we wear slippers and come out on stage.
You know,

345
00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:14.140
last night they actually had a little area rug down there and my,

346
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.510
or for some reason says I need two stools.

347
00:21:16.511 --> 00:21:20.770
I guess one is if I want to sit down the other ones for the fucking bottled

348
00:21:20.771 --> 00:21:21.070
water.

349
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.320
And I've been telling my agent for the longest time we got to take that out

350
00:21:23.321 --> 00:21:24.154
there.
I don't,

351
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.640
I don't need two stools who might do some couple of dips out there.
Yeah.
Right.

352
00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:32.200
Um,
but last night I went out there and they had two chairs and a table in the

353
00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:35.800
middle with the water on it with the tablecloth and it felt like I was doing a

354
00:21:35.801 --> 00:21:40.801
little play and it actually really affected my standup and I was doing all these

355
00:21:42.911 --> 00:21:43.300
little,

356
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.660
like I immediately just acted like I was interviewing myself on some lifetime

357
00:21:46.661 --> 00:21:49.660
achievement thing and um,

358
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.570
like three or four times during my act,

359
00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:58.530
it just made my bits go in different directions and just shit that I've been

360
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.050
enjoying doing,
which is just doing a character.

361
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.220
We only hear one side of the conversation and all of that.
And uh,

362
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.930
it really enhanced that.

363
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.980
So now after all this time of saying I didn't want the two stools,

364
00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.280
I might now go,
I like two chairs with a table,

365
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.400
tablecloth and little area rug,
you know.

366
00:22:18.401 --> 00:22:23.140
And I saw Cosby pre rape allegations.
He had a set up like that.
He had a,

367
00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:26.770
he had a little area rug,
he had a chair and he had a,
he had a table.

368
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.550
I liked the extra chair cause the extra chair makes it feel,

369
00:22:30.551 --> 00:22:33.460
you can pretend like there's somebody there talking,
you know,

370
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.240
like I've been doing this stupid bit about how uh,
Bruce Jenner,
you know,

371
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.740
God bless him and everything he wants to do.

372
00:22:38.741 --> 00:22:40.000
I don't have a fucking problem with that.

373
00:22:40.001 --> 00:22:43.990
But the fact that it's a national news and a,

374
00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:47.680
there was just something about sitting there pretending to read the news and

375
00:22:47.681 --> 00:22:52.120
talking about whether or not Bruce was or was not going to keep his dick as

376
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:53.890
national news.
Meanwhile,
like,
you know,

377
00:22:53.891 --> 00:22:57.910
baby seals are Washington up onto the fucking shorts.
Nobody gives a fuck.
Right?

378
00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.570
Nobody talks about it anyways.
Um,
I don't know.

379
00:23:01.571 --> 00:23:04.480
I think that might be my new setup.
You know,

380
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.090
my new thing in my fucking ride.

381
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.770
Um,
anyways,

382
00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.770
I don't even know what happens is the last time I talked to you guys,

383
00:23:14.771 --> 00:23:17.140
I'm so fucking out of it.
Did the uh,

384
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:21.400
did the jam band Guy Fucking Yank the other guy's arm out of his socket?

385
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.120
You see that filthy play?
Oh,
I talked about that.
I actually talked about,

386
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.800
that's right.
I talked about that already.
Um,
but anyways,

387
00:23:29.801 --> 00:23:31.540
who do you like?
You know what?
I'm such a fucking moron.

388
00:23:31.541 --> 00:23:33.160
When I was sitting at trash and the clippers,

389
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.890
I was saying the blues are like the,

390
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.690
like the clippers on ice where they just never get out of the first round.

391
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.250
I had no idea that the clippers won game three at that point.
They were,

392
00:23:42.251 --> 00:23:45.220
they have to one or is it two to all I know.
Is they going to like,
uh,

393
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:46.041
what was it?

394
00:23:46.041 --> 00:23:51.041
Game six now spur spowers bars one last two where they're up flood three games

395
00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:54.650
to two.
I fucking hate that.
I know what's going on in hope.

396
00:23:54.651 --> 00:23:58.010
And I don't know what's going on in hockey is cause I'm fucking traveling with

397
00:23:58.011 --> 00:24:02.840
Verdesian Lawhead and they're uh,
you know,
they're big time fucking hoop guys.

398
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.190
And um,
you know,
I'm not going to be a cunt.

399
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.930
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna play the headliner card in San.
Hey guys,

400
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:16.690
come on.
Who's kidding?
Who,
who's telling the most shit jokes tonight?
Meet?
Uh,

401
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.790
you exactly.
Oh God dammit.

402
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:25.250
Give up the fucking television.
I am tonight.
I am going to watch that game seven.

403
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.730
I'm a watch that game seven.
It's probably gonna come on here in a few minutes.

404
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:34.030
Um,
like I said,
I am recording this on Wednesday.
So,
uh,

405
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.320
I guess as you listen to this,
you,
I know who wants.
So bill,

406
00:24:36.321 --> 00:24:38.600
why don't you give us your predictions?
You have to tell you what,

407
00:24:38.601 --> 00:24:41.750
I'll give you my prediction for,
uh,

408
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.250
for game seven,
Detroit,
Tampa,

409
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:50.630
and I'll give you the Pacquiao.
Mayweather.
All right.

410
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.940
I think Detroit wince,
I dunno why they went,
the best defenseman is out.

411
00:24:55.941 --> 00:24:58.400
I still think they fucking win because,
uh,

412
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.690
because there Detroit and cause they got a great group of youngsters,

413
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:07.760
they always seem to know like who the next fucking dat suit guy is.

414
00:25:07.761 --> 00:25:10.850
They always seem to get him Berlin's we never get them.

415
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:16.460
We get those hard working guys,
those blue collar guys going into the corners.
Um,

416
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.920
and I just think that they're going to step up.

417
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.790
I'm assuming it's a home game for Detroit.
I'm assuming it's in Detroit.

418
00:25:22.791 --> 00:25:26.120
That's if it's in Detroit.
I think that they went and even it's in Florida,

419
00:25:26.121 --> 00:25:29.390
I still think they lose because it's Florida and it's hockey and that's how it

420
00:25:29.391 --> 00:25:32.330
goes.
So I'm picking Detroit and game seven,

421
00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:38.530
I picking this spurs to finish off the clippers in game six,

422
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.980
even though it's going to be back home.
Right.
It does go back home.

423
00:25:42.981 --> 00:25:46.190
I'll fucking though.
And then,
uh,
Mayweather.

424
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:47.690
This is what I think's going to happen.

425
00:25:47.691 --> 00:25:50.990
Packy I was going to come out and he basically has about three and a half

426
00:25:50.991 --> 00:25:55.970
fucking rounds to knock Mayweather on his ass before Mayweather figures out what

427
00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:56.780
the fuck.
You know,

428
00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:01.650
he just basically has packy I was entire style figured out and then he keeps,

429
00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.970
he's just the elusive for the rest of the fight and wins a split decision on

430
00:26:04.971 --> 00:26:09.950
points.
That's what I,
I think he survived whatever pack.
Yeah,

431
00:26:09.951 --> 00:26:12.140
I was going to do.
And uh,

432
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:17.510
I think he wins on points and I think fans will be disappointed as they always

433
00:26:17.511 --> 00:26:22.230
are because nobody got knocked out.
The beauty was fucking lame.
Um,

434
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:23.203
that's what I think.

435
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:28.990
I think that some might even be more upset than a skin tag nation was when they

436
00:26:29.661 --> 00:26:33.320
showed it.
Was it Jared Leto,
Jared,
Jared,

437
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:37.700
Jerry,
Larry.
I don't know what his fucking name is.

438
00:26:37.701 --> 00:26:40.370
That guy from Dallas buyers club at won,
won,

439
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.110
won an Oscar and also was in a successful,
right.

440
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:48.340
<v 2>He walks around with a,
that James Taylor looked at,
singer songwriter.</v>

441
00:26:48.341 --> 00:26:52.750
I've seen fire and I've seen rain now saying sunny days.

442
00:26:52.751 --> 00:26:57.460
And I thought,
[inaudible] man,
I fucking hate that song.
It's like,
hey dude,

443
00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.740
you know,
I'm sorry your friend died but mine didn't.

444
00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.090
So why don't you fucking pick up the tempo and put a little sunshine in your

445
00:27:04.091 --> 00:27:07.970
music or very least let us know that you're going to sing about your dead
friend.

446
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.360
But I stopped.

447
00:27:10.361 --> 00:27:14.470
I'd CEO one more time.

448
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.690
Jesus,
what's his name?
James Taylor.
Jesus Christ.

449
00:27:19.691 --> 00:27:22.600
Whenever I see they could James Taylor,
whenever he's singing,

450
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:27.760
all I do is picture Hillary and Bill Clinton in the balcony standing up dancing

451
00:27:27.761 --> 00:27:31.180
really bad.
That's all I think of when I hear his music.
I'm sorry.

452
00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.620
I think of that and I picture James Taylor and rollerblades before the concert.

453
00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.180
You know,

454
00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.470
they did a whole story on him one time and they had them roller blading.
He said,

455
00:27:41.471 --> 00:27:45.280
I love it.
I can't stop,
can't stop rollerblading.
I really enjoy it.

456
00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:49.990
He embraced it that granted,
this is when,
when it was through the fucking roof,

457
00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.040
rollerblading was the shit.
I enjoyed it.
Play rollerblade hockey get own to me.

458
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:55.930
And I gotta tell you after a long day's work,

459
00:27:55.931 --> 00:27:59.500
putting on a pair of boy shorts and,
and skating down the street,

460
00:27:59.501 --> 00:28:02.680
I thought it was,
I thought it was very refreshing.
You know,

461
00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.990
I can only imagine if I had a pair of me undies.

462
00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.650
I want to apologize to all of you for putting that image in your got damn heads.

463
00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:16.420
Um,
so anyways,
all these comic book Nerds,

464
00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.960
right?
Comic Con fucking people flipped out,

465
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:25.030
flipped out when they saw the new one said he looked like he was from hot topic

466
00:28:25.031 --> 00:28:27.700
and all that type of shit.
Let me,
can I ask you guys,
you know,

467
00:28:27.701 --> 00:28:30.010
I always trash the comic book people because I'm not into it.

468
00:28:30.011 --> 00:28:32.800
So obviously it's gotta be stupid if it didn't appeal to me,
right?

469
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.760
There's an enlightened way to go through life.
I don't like that.

470
00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.240
That must be stupid.
Um,

471
00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.080
why do you guys get so God damn upset all the time?
You know,
like,

472
00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.330
has there ever been a time where they revealed,

473
00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:51.040
you know what the new Bat Bat jet ski was going to look like?

474
00:28:51.041 --> 00:28:55.060
That you actually thought it looked good?
You didn't think it looked lame,

475
00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:00.070
you know the sweat under your man tits didn't start to grow.

476
00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:01.770
Why do you guys always Keno?

477
00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.750
I don't have they ever picked anybody to pick baton to play Batman that you

478
00:29:07.751 --> 00:29:11.800
liked?
Who was a good Batman?
Was Adam West?

479
00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:17.840
That can't be shit.
I actually liked that shelf.
Ben and Eh,

480
00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.890
um,
sorry.
Um,
Michael Keaton.

481
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.920
I didn't like Michael Keaton when he played Batman.
I like him now.

482
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:30.660
I like him as an old curmudgeonly guy.

483
00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.350
<v 0>Okay.</v>

484
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:34.430
<v 2>When he said,
you know,</v>

485
00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:35.980
<v 0>yeah,</v>

486
00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:40.800
<v 2>what is he saying?
That movie?
He says,
that's right ice man.</v>

487
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.010
I am

488
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:46.090
<v 1>Batman.
And then he goes,
he chomps down on his teeth,
right?</v>

489
00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:51.320
And then they played volleyball and he had to keep his mask on band aid,
Dank,

490
00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.050
Dank.
Dang it.
Dang name.

491
00:29:53.051 --> 00:29:56.710
Nanny defeated the Russians and he was in the back plane upside down.

492
00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:01.300
And then Robin,
Robin Watch out for the canopy,
you know.

493
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:07.390
Then Meg Ryan cried cause Robin died.
Was that Burt Ward Jr?

494
00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:09.910
I don't fucking remember why you guys always upset.
Like who?

495
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.090
Who Do you think should play Batman?
What's wrong with Ben Affleck?

496
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:17.350
He's got the perfect job to have like most of his face covered by a mask,

497
00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:22.630
you know,
you know to be a good Batman.
Jay Leno,
Jay Leno has got a great job.

498
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:27.130
Ben Affleck,
Woody Harrelson,

499
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.080
the way he's making his John True detective.

500
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.410
Would you like any of those guys or would that get y'all,
aren't you,

501
00:30:32.411 --> 00:30:35.950
aren't you cartoon Comic Book Reading People and you just mad that they didn't

502
00:30:35.951 --> 00:30:38.830
pick you?
Is that what it really comes down to?

503
00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:43.750
Nothing can live up to what you've built it up to be.

504
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:47.560
Oh God,
it's such a cunt.
Why do I do,

505
00:30:47.561 --> 00:30:51.250
why can't I just let people enjoy shit anyways?

506
00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.520
Well they go this year,
there's a little podcast for the week.

507
00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:58.360
I'm sitting here doing my laundry.
This is life on the road.

508
00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:03.460
The most exciting part of my day was there was a washer and dryer one.

509
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:07.060
Like I have the hotel room right at the very end and right around the corner

510
00:31:07.061 --> 00:31:08.160
there's a washer and a dryer.

511
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.700
And I am so psyched that I'm washing my socks and me undies,

512
00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:17.590
me undies,
no fucking dirty shit in my luggage.

513
00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:22.610
I hate dirty.
I dirty laundry in the luggage.
Skeeves me out.
And whenever I've,
I,

514
00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:26.800
I'm on the road like this,
I always make sure like right before,

515
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:30.800
like this tour and Saturday,
right?
Say,
um,

516
00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:33.490
I'm knocking it out.
So whatever,
I have like two days,

517
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.400
two days where that's acceptable as far as he says,

518
00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:41.470
unacceptable as far as diversity effect podcast says on the all things comedy

519
00:31:41.471 --> 00:31:42.520
network,
uh,

520
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.970
a week's worth of fucking laundry in your bag and you're shutting that thing

521
00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:49.570
tight to fucking take it out of the belly of a plane.

522
00:31:49.571 --> 00:31:53.560
Five hours later in a desert climate.
Can't have that.

523
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:57.640
Can't have that on a fucking level.
Um,
all right,
so that's the,
uh,

524
00:31:57.641 --> 00:32:01.120
that's the Thursday afternoon podcast.
I hope I gave you some chuckles.

525
00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:05.920
I want to thank everybody that came out in mobile,
Alabama and Jackson.

526
00:32:05.921 --> 00:32:09.940
Mississippi was the shit was the shit.

527
00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:13.870
That's such a good time there.
And,
um,

528
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.590
I really enjoyed the city,
but from what I saw,
we kind of rolled in.

529
00:32:17.591 --> 00:32:22.330
I didn't see too much of it,
but um,
you know,

530
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.230
obviously,
you know,

531
00:32:23.231 --> 00:32:27.010
there's still flying the confederate flag underneath the American flag at the,

532
00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:31.390
uh,
the State House,
which is a hell of a thing to say.

533
00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.260
But,
um,
you know,

534
00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:40.200
everybody I met down there was nice,
you know,
I had a good time

535
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.700
<v 2>and everybody fucking hung out afterwards.
That by in the posters,</v>

536
00:32:44.701 --> 00:32:49.140
I'm coming out,
I'm making the people,
I'm shaking the hands and uh,
I'll tell you,

537
00:32:49.141 --> 00:32:51.580
underrate it.
Mobile Alabama man didn't nice.

538
00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.260
If you can't afford to fly somewhere and you just want to jump in your car and

539
00:32:55.261 --> 00:32:59.860
go hang out in a cool city that's got a bunch of great places to drink.
And,
uh,

540
00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:00.841
oh,
by the way,

541
00:33:00.841 --> 00:33:05.760
apologies accepted for that crazy lady went to this place and we were shooting

542
00:33:05.761 --> 00:33:09.600
pool and um,
this lady was just,
you know,

543
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.990
she was that level drunk that as she was walking up to talk to me,

544
00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:17.910
her friends were already apologizing for.
And uh,
you know,
so I took a picture,

545
00:33:17.911 --> 00:33:20.310
we did the whole fucking thing,
and then it was finally like,
all right,
bait it,

546
00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.173
paid it,
paid it,

547
00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:25.500
and then of course she's getting mad and then she's yelling at me going,

548
00:33:25.501 --> 00:33:29.010
you know,
I used to be your fan now at all.
Like you.
Yeah,

549
00:33:29.011 --> 00:33:33.460
so fuck you and fuck you.
You fuck up.
Fuck Great.

550
00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:37.560
You know,
saying that I was a jerk and I just yelled over,
I just said,

551
00:33:37.561 --> 00:33:41.760
you're blaming the victim.
Go sober.
Roppe tomorrow.

552
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:45.630
Do you have any sort of a human being?
You're all apologize,
you know,

553
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.270
when did you know she did it?
What a good shit,
right?
We've all been there.

554
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.900
We've all get boost up and said something.
We didn't mean to say.
All right,

555
00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.520
well he did for a kiss that wasn't there.
We've all done it.

556
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.790
All righty.
That's it.
That's it.
I hope you guys have a wonderful weekend.

557

This is all positive billion.
Thursday.

Summer's coming up.

560
00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:19.290
You want to walk down the beach showing off the guns,
Huh?

561
00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:24.220
Or maybe a fucking yeah,

Get after it.

562
00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:28.650
Have a great weekend,
Eh,

Alright.

563

Tell you to go fuck yourselves and I'm not going to do that.

564
00:34:32.261 --> 00:34:33.430
Have a wonderful weekend

566
00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.753
<v 4>MMM.</v>

567
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.530
<v 2>Friend of mine who actually runs the,

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:27.600
the m m podcast page,

570
00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.820

You know,

572
00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.200
I want to take this podcast and next level is what I do is I do the podcast then

573
00:35:41.201 --> 00:35:43.120
I,

I,

574
00:35:43.121 --> 00:35:46.540
I upload it and I sent it to the dude who runs that page and he puts all the

575
00:35:46.541 --> 00:35:49.920
fucking,
you know,
all the references up,
all the youtube videos and everything.

576
00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:54.550
Then we try to sync it where we both fucking put it on at the same time,

577
00:35:54.551 --> 00:35:59.230
you know,
taking it to the next level.
Totally lost.

578
00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:03.140
Just lost my fucking train of thought here.
Um,
oh,
that's right.

579
00:36:03.141 --> 00:36:07.520
He sent me this article.
This is the classic just dumbing down,

580
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:08.910
<v 0>okay.</v>

581
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:11.340
<v 2>Just pussy way that we're running this country right now.
These,</v>

582
00:36:11.341 --> 00:36:14.250
there's peak people actually I guess the,
uh,
the nationwide,
uh,

583
00:36:14.251 --> 00:36:18.780
the national spelling bee is coming up,
you know,
and everybody laughs at these,

584
00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:21.900
these kids who go up there,
they're right at their fucking awkward years.

585
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:22.861
You know what I mean?

586
00:36:22.861 --> 00:36:25.860
Where they have the nose of the adult and like the fucking teeth of a fucking

587
00:36:25.861 --> 00:36:30.300
two year old,
you know,
12 year old.
So,
um,

588
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.970
they have in the national spelling bee and Washington DC,

589
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:36.840
they celebrate these uh,

590
00:36:36.841 --> 00:36:40.970
these brainiac fucking kids that eventually will work for a corporation and

591
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.160
without really knowing it will probably work on some device,
settle Sunday,

592
00:36:44.161 --> 00:36:47.970
kill millions of people,
you know,
in other words,
the future.

593
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:54.710
So there's people actually they're picketing the spelling bee.

594
00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:00.330
All right.
I had to,
I had to fucking read this to actually believe it.
Okay.

595
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:04.650
It says not all spellers headed for Washington DC for the National Spelling Bee

596
00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:09.270
spelling bee on June 1st through the third think English spelling is a good

597
00:37:09.271 --> 00:37:14.271
thing that should be celebrated with spectators and judges inside the Grand

598
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.220
Hyatt Hotel.
Uh Oh wow.

599
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:20.460
While spectators and judges inside the Grand Hyatt Hotel will be pondering the

600
00:37:20.461 --> 00:37:25.461
spellings of obscure words and admiring the efforts of contestants outside on

601
00:37:25.651 --> 00:37:26.091
the streets.

602
00:37:26.091 --> 00:37:30.780
Some members of the American Literacy Council and These Simplified Spelling

603
00:37:30.781 --> 00:37:33.960
Society,
Aka the s s.

604
00:37:33.961 --> 00:37:38.961
S we'll be trying to convince Passerbuys that the English spelling is a problem

605
00:37:40.231 --> 00:37:41.340
that needs fixing.

606
00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:43.830
<v 0>Okay.</v>

607
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:46.440
<v 2>Why are people so fucking dumb?
Okay.
And then that's something.</v>

608
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:50.580
If you want to get support,
simplified spelling society,

609
00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:54.420
you don't go to the fucking nationwide spelling bee where the the kids just

610
00:37:54.421 --> 00:37:55.254
learned,

611
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:56.440
<v 0>okay,</v>

612
00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.660
<v 2>how to spell fucking rheumatoid arthritis.</v>

613
00:37:58.661 --> 00:38:01.870
So whatever the fuck they going to ask them,
can you use it in a sentence?

614
00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:06.580
Your grandmother has rheumatoid arthritis.
Okay.

615
00:38:06.581 --> 00:38:10.550
That was me really tight.
I tried it.
Isn't that two words?
Um,

616
00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.270
why don't you just go to a bar?

617
00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.170
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

618
00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:17.850
<v 2>You want to get names on that fucking petition.
That's who you're doing it for.</v>

619
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:19.740
The dumb fucks.

620
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:24.240
This is the point these people have it said like those in size side.

621
00:38:24.241 --> 00:38:26.130
They may admire the efforts of the contestants,

622
00:38:26.131 --> 00:38:31.050
but they will have signs and sandwich boards with slogans such as I'm through

623
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:35.620
with,
through,
in other words,
t,
h,
r,
u.
N,
t,
h.

624
00:38:35.621 --> 00:38:40.570
R.
O.
U.
G.
H.
I'm through with,
through and enough is enough spelled e,
n,
u,

625
00:38:40.571 --> 00:38:44.740
F,
e,
n,
u,F ,
and enough is too much spelled e.

626
00:38:44.741 --> 00:38:49.360
N.
O.
U.
G.
H.
Their aim is to alert parents,
educators,

627
00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.130
politicians,
business people,

628
00:38:51.131 --> 00:38:54.880
and others concerned about the unacceptable level of illiteracy,

629
00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:59.940
illiteracy among English speakers to the fact that a prime cause for this is

630
00:39:00.731 --> 00:39:03.820
English spelling.
Do you get it?

631
00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:09.780
The reason why there's such a high level of illiteracy is not because we

632
00:39:10.601 --> 00:39:13.720
constantly cut funding to the public schools,

633
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:19.500
not because spelling is something that's even fucking stressed by most people

634
00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:23.710
anymore.
It's because the words are too difficult to spell.

635
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:27.160
One of the pickers pickers,
one of the picketers.

636
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:29.620
This is hilarious and I can't even fucking read.
I'm part of the problem.

637
00:39:29.621 --> 00:39:32.170
I might sign these people's petition.
Um,

638
00:39:32.171 --> 00:39:35.980
one of the picketers at the ALC chair and the SSS member,

639
00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:39.670
Allen Mole from Boulder,
Colorado,
put it this way,

640
00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:45.840
are odd spelling retains words like cough bowl through and though this increases

641
00:39:47.921 --> 00:39:52.921
illiteracy and crime fix it and you fix a host of problems,

642
00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:56.720
we want to fix it to this guy is basically saying,
yeah,

643
00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.490
<v 1>that the reason why there's serial killers,</v>

644
00:40:00.491 --> 00:40:05.350
there's people holding up fucking Mcdonald's,
there's purse snatchers

645
00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:11.850
and all this type of shit is because cat is not spelled with a k.

646
00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:14.980
Yeah,

647
00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:19.980
I mean on one side I fucking respect this guy because he's actually has a cause.

648
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:23.710
He actually got off his couch and said,
you know what?

649
00:40:23.711 --> 00:40:27.700
I'm going to do something about this.
This is the reverse of what I was trying.

650
00:40:27.701 --> 00:40:32.020
Maybe that's why.
Let's get smart America bombed on my podcast.

651
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.640
You know,
you guys are waiting for this sss guy to come in here,
you know,

652
00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:41.110
I mean not,
not to be the classic person who goes,
what's going to happen next,

653
00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:46.000
but what is going to happen next?
Two plus two was like four or five,
three,

654
00:40:46.001 --> 00:40:48.280
you know,
as long as you're within one,
we'll give it to you.

655
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:50.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

656
00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.140
<v 1>Rounded off to the nearest right answer.</v>

657
00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:57.030
Learn how to fucking spell your lazy fucks as pathetic.

658
00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:01.920
And I also like how to like the illiteracy illiteracy problem is,
you know,

659
00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:04.690
that's the reason why there's fucking crime.
You know?

660
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.230
I bet those fucking bankers,
you know,

661
00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:10.140
those bankers are literate and they're great at math.

662
00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.990
They're great if fucking math where it always works out for them.

663
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:16.620
The fucking concert,
they went till fucking Ivy League schools.

664
00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.420
Why did I,
why did I take her off?
I really schools,

665
00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:26.340
Ivy League schools.
They went to Ivy League fucking schools and went to Brown.

666
00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.570
They went to Cornell.

667
00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.300
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

668
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.680
<v 1>Wentworth.
I Dunno,</v>

669
00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:35.140
that's one for you that are just some party fucking uh,

670
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:38.920
you know,
something that's,
you know what killed it?

671
00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:44.030
What killed it was a was cable.
That's what,
that's what,

672
00:41:44.031 --> 00:41:48.170
that's what really made people dump cable and the Internet.

673
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:51.710
800 fucking channels.
You know,
people used to back in the day,

674
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:56.510
they used to load up as something called a station wagon.
All right?
First of all,

675
00:41:56.511 --> 00:41:59.960
everybody had like five fucking kids back in the day.
All right.

676
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:02.630
Which was a great thing to do.
You know,

677
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:06.020
cause you know a couple of them are going to be fuck ups.
Okay.

678
00:42:06.021 --> 00:42:08.390
And you can let it go.
You can let it go.

679
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:12.140
That's why parents who have only one kid is so fucking over protective

680
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:16.610
protective is because they went all in world series of poker.

681
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:19.280
They pushed all the chips and this is their one fucking hope.

682
00:42:19.281 --> 00:42:23.630
That kid can't be a fucking serial killer.
You have seven,
eight fucking kids,

683
00:42:23.631 --> 00:42:28.270
you know one of them,
you know
you can handle it.

684
00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:33.610
You can fucking handle it.
If one of them's a phase,
the black sheep,

685
00:42:33.611 --> 00:42:34.444
what are you going to dope?

686
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:36.270
<v 0>Okay.</v>

687
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:39.330
<v 1>You know,
what the fuck are you going to do?
I mean the guy,
he's a</v>

688
00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:44.520
transvestite and sometimes pyromaniac.
Huh?

689
00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:46.530
Anybody remember that line there?

690
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:51.950
He met a transvestite and sometimes pyromaniac the greatest line ever uttered on

691
00:42:52.471 --> 00:42:53.850
the fucking a and e channel.

692
00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:58.040
Possibly in television history when they were talking about these ds,
this,

693
00:42:58.041 --> 00:43:02.310
this serial killer tandem.
That's how they described one of the guys.

694
00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.210
One of the guys was just killing somebody on his own and then he had to leave

695
00:43:06.211 --> 00:43:07.044
town.

696
00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:07.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

697
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:10.220
<v 2>Because the heat was getting too high and you went to a new town,</v>

698
00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:13.760
hangs out in some shady bar and that's where he meets his,
his,
his,

699
00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:16.460
his serial killer partner.
You know,

700
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:19.370
Kinda like when Bill Gates met that other fucking nerd and they made the first

701
00:43:19.371 --> 00:43:22.010
laptop,
these two serial killers came together

702
00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:27.980
and to describe his partner that the fucking,
that Bill Curtis guy goes there.

703
00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:31.250
He met a transvestite and sometimes pyromaniac

704
00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:38.170
<v 1>back in the day people we had station wagons and there was a whole bunch of</v>

705
00:43:38.171 --> 00:43:42.280
fucking kid.
He didn't have to have a fucking spelling bee.
Okay,

706
00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:46.660
you have a spelling bee because you only have one kid and the kid can't compete

707
00:43:46.661 --> 00:43:49.390
against himself.
You've got to go with a bunch of other fucking kids.

708
00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:53.470
Back in the day we had station wagons and they were full of fucking kids.

709
00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.200
All right.
And you just,

710
00:43:56.201 --> 00:44:00.130
you drove somewhere and on the way there,
you know,

711
00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:04.240
you listen to Mitch Miller.
Okay,

712
00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:07.730
<v 5>bullies,
Ooh,
we'll room</v>

713
00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:12.130
<v 1>right
and you're fucking,
you said Shit like,
um,</v>

714
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.570
do you get any,
do your parents would quiz you?
What are Ivy League schools named?

715
00:44:16.571 --> 00:44:18.730
The capitols of states.

716
00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.160
<v 0>Okay.</v>

717
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.290
<v 1>You know,
that's what the fuck you did and you stopped at a rest area.</v>

718
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:28.300
Your Dad sent you in there by yourself.
There was no problem,

719
00:44:28.301 --> 00:44:32.220
there was no worries.
And you walked in there

720
00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:37.740
and some guy exposes himself to you.
It is not a deal with it.

721
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:39.810
It just buried it.

722
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.860
You got back in the fucking car and next thing you know you're at a dairy queen.

723
00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:47.070
Sort of enjoying the ice cream,
but sorta not.

724
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:55.980
That's when America was intelligent.
Back when we used to have like five,

725
00:44:55.981 --> 00:45:00.270
six kids and you throw him in a fucking station wagon and then you quizzed him

726
00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:06.410
as you drove to some poor excuse for a tourist attraction.

727
00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:06.751
You know,

728
00:45:06.751 --> 00:45:11.751
you go out to go look at fucking while bill Cody's fucking log cabin.

729
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:17.850
You know your dad be sitting there seething with anger,

730
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:24.080
left arm,
all sunburned from having it hanging out the side fucking window.

731
00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:26.000
The rest of them ghost white

732
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:33.280
and that was it.
Spelling tests,
quizzes and dairy queen.

733
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Somewhere along the line it became OMG laughing my fucking ass off all this

734
00:45:39.701 --> 00:45:43.660
abbreviation.
These people want to turn it into that.
Fuck that man up.

735
00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.510
You pussies learn how to spell goddamn words.

736
00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:49.150
I did it for a month.

737
00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:54.420
I'm a better speller because it because of it because it I'm not,

738
00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:58.690
I've already forgot.
I finally conquered the word restaurant though forever.

739
00:45:58.691 --> 00:46:03.520
I couldn't remember where the you went.

742
00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:13.700
Is it restaurant or restaurant?
Restaurant.

743
00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.680

752
00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:53.570
Um,

753
00:46:53.571 --> 00:46:57.770
listen to people down the south when they talk about the South Gilder rise
again.

754
00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:01.760
Is it,

755
00:47:01.761 --> 00:47:03.350
How did that work out the first time?

756
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.300
