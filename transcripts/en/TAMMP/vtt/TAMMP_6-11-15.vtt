00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.260
On Julie,

2
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.510
what's going on?

3
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.570
This is my last night on petty a fucking awesome time.

4
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.870
Um,
so it was a little grumpy on Monday.
You know what I mean?

5
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:24.930
That's what happens when you drink outside in the sun all day to fucking tennis

6
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:28.230
match bunt.
But of rich concen you,

7
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.190
I watched the whole fucking youtube video of just,
you know,

8
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:35.160
tennis people losing their shit.
It's like they're not,

9
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.220
they were upset that their,
they want to win the championship.

10
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.130
I like when they smashed their racket and act like they give a fuck.

11
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:45.630
I don't want to see somebody out there with the Goddamn White Hanky.
Right.

12
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.490
Anyways,
I already talked about this shit on the last podcast.
Uh,

13
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.410
this is the Thursday afternoon,
Monday morning podcast just before Friday.

14
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.230
Um,
you know,
what do you,
what do you,
what do you,
what are you doing?
Huh?
Fuck.

15
00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:00.930
Are you doing,
I had a birthday actually today,

16
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.760
which will be yesterday by the time you hear this shit.
Um,
and I am,

17
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:10.080
let's see again,
finally say it right.
Count on set.
47 years old,
dude.

18
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.280
Whoa.
Getting up there.
Um,

19
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.560
I had a fucking awesome day.
Uh,
I,
me and my lovely wife walked up to,

20
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:24.210
uh,
the Eiffel Tower,
right.
And,
uh,

21
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.620
I realized,
you know,
as I'm trying to learn,
you know,
some French over here,

22
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:32.250
which is,
you know,
I,
you know,
I'm at that level where I'm like,
hello,

23
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:37.251
Mr. I would like a rotisserie chicken if you please.

24
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.140
And you know,
right off the bat,
I mean,
they know,
nobody talks like that.

25
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:46.350
Even if you pronounced it perfectly.
The like,
what is this guy a fucking robot?

26
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.470
Like nobody talks like that.
You gotta get to the point where we're like,
hey,

27
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:51.810
what's going on man?
How are you?
Uh,

28
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.000
let me get the a rotisserie chicken and let me hit,
been in beer over there,

29
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.540
however you just normally talk.

30
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.460
So then there's some other shit that you need to have to say,
like at one point,

31
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.810
um,
you know,
we're walking along the Sandra,

32
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.170
Sandra or whatever the fuck you call it.
And,
uh,
on the right bank is,

33
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.770
is Lulu and all of that shit and all those shops,

34
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:18.510
it's basically there are times square,
you know,
it's all just fucking,
you know,

35
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.480
tourists like me and,
and,

36
00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:27.060
and just fucking people who have money who want to show it off.

37
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.050
You know that road Dayo drive horse shit when people just walk around with a

38
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:34.410
bunch of fucking patent leather horseshit,
you know,

39
00:02:34.411 --> 00:02:38.280
doing the duck lip fucking selfies.
Like that's what that is.

40
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:41.800
If you get out of that,
it's great.
So we're on our way over there.

41
00:02:41.801 --> 00:02:45.270
It's like an asshole.
I'm an old man.
CanNot set,

42
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.890
I don't want to fucking walk over there.

43
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.690
So there's one of those bike Rick shot things.
So I say to that dude,
I'm like,
uh,

44
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.580
you know,
uh,
Columbian Pura dub above Ba.
And He,
and he said fucking like,

45
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.750
what'd he say?
He said won't sank.
And I'm like,
come on man.

46
00:02:59.751 --> 00:03:04.160
25 bucks just to go a thing a little bit at the fucking thing,
right?

47
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.140
So he takes us over the bridge,
whatever he's pedaling and stuff and he stinks.

48
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.670
Smells would be oh no,

49
00:03:10.671 --> 00:03:14.420
cause he French's cause he pedals around two full grown adults all God damn day.

50
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.460
And uh,
so we get to the other side,
you know,

51
00:03:19.461 --> 00:03:23.780
and this mother Fucker,
I gave him 25 euros and he goes no,

52
00:03:23.781 --> 00:03:27.460
he's like each,
it's like get the fuck outta here.

53
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.830
What are you going to 20 bucks each.
So they're,

54
00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:31.400
I'm not giving you a fucking 20 bucks each,
you know,
but,

55
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.690

56
00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:38.691

57
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.150
Key a day Connery,
which that is bullshit.
And then if he continued talking to me,

58
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.440
I should've said busy at the man.
Fuck your mother and I should have walked away.

59
00:03:48.441 --> 00:03:52.040
But I know not to say it.
So I gave him 20 euros and 10 American.

60
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.270
See that if it cost me $10 USA,

61
00:03:56.271 --> 00:04:00.650
cause I did not say kid they corner conair how do make sure you guys say this

62
00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:02.870
right?
Let me have this fucking this how you say fuck your mother.

63
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.290
Stay with me.
This is beds data.
Mad As fuck you mother.

64
00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:14.270
You've got to save that one.
There's no reason to fucking,

65
00:04:14.271 --> 00:04:16.970
you don't come out of the gate with that.
You start off with,

66
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.610
well,
it'd be a good night.

67
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.200
<v 2>Okay.</v>

68
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.850

69
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.730
20 no fucking phone saying each.

70
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.120
And that's when I go key a Dick Connery.
And then when he keeps fucking talking,

71
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.380
Dan,

This is what she said.

72
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.130
[inaudible] fuck your mother and you walk away.
What are you going to do to me?

73
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.360
Huh?
You gonna slap me near Oulu

74
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.240

Fuck him.
He took 10 American that's worth like $3 euros.

75
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.560
So I got out of it for fucking drunk tweeting,
right?
That Carolyn said,

76
00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:05.190
that's not too bad.
I think.
Um,

77
00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:10.191
excited to be back and I'm fucking Jones and so bad to do some standup.

78
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.430
Um,
I had a fucking such an awesome time over here.

79
00:05:14.431 --> 00:05:18.780
I'm all rested up and all that shit and I'm ready to go into was hilarious.

80
00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:23.580
Today was I wake up and,
uh,
and you're not going to see this video,

81
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:27.230
but my wife videotape me.
I said,
I am 47 years old.
I gotta get,

82
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.830
I gotta hit the deck here.
I got to try to bang up 47 pushups.
Uh,

83
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.600
it was an ugly scene.
I did it.
I actually did 50.
I did 50,
but I,

84
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.780
when I finished the 50,

85
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.700
I like fucking rolled over on my back and did that thing.
You know,

86
00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:49.290
you cover your eyes with your fuck in the crook of your arm and was just,

87
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:51.320
just,
you would've thought I was,

88
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.200
you know that person that runs a marathon and they get like a mile away from the

89
00:05:55.201 --> 00:05:58.720
finish line and they're shitting because their bowels have failed.

90
00:05:58.721 --> 00:06:03.130
Like that's how fucking exhausted I was.
Um,
it's bad.

91
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.410
I'm a big fucking French pastry at this point.
I,

92
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.570
I gotta do something about this shit and I'm only home for four days.

93
00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:14.320
When I get back,
before I get on the bus,
Gus and me and Joe Barton,

94
00:06:14.321 --> 00:06:17.470
nick are going to be tying the west coast.
So,
uh,

95
00:06:17.471 --> 00:06:19.570
there's going to be plenty of crown royals on that one.

96
00:06:19.571 --> 00:06:23.230
So I don't know what I'm going to do here.
I got to hit the salads or something.

97
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.010
Um,
well you could say no bill.
You could say,
hey,
hey,
you know,

98
00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:30.880
I'm not drinking on this one,
but where's the fun in that?
You know,

99
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.950
where is the fun in that?
That's what I,
that's how I look at it.
You know,

100
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.790
if you know baby seals are going to wash up onto the beach and no one gives a

101
00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:42.610
fuck,
I mean,
it's,
it's,
it's gonna be over.

102
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.180
You know what somebody said to me the other day was telling me,

103
00:06:46.181 --> 00:06:49.370
you got to have a kid.
And I was like,
I know.
I know.
And he goes,
no,

104
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.600
but you can't just have one.
You've got to have to,
it's like,
it's like douchebag

105
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.920
or you're watching the news,
you know,

106
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.260
got to have to do you really,

107
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:04.230

Huh?

108
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.730
Thrown another fucking plastic water bottle into the end of the ocean.

109
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.940
<v 2>Okay.</v>

110
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.710
<v 0>You should be looking at me going,

Thank you for not having fucking any and there's two less conscious walker.

112

I'm in the fucking world,
right?

113
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.600
Everyone should have one from here on out until it tapers off.

114
00:07:22.601 --> 00:07:23.960
And everybody will be like,
well,

115
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:28.270
what's the ramification of an entire generation of only child's?
Well,

116
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.630
how much worse can they do then what we've done,
right?
Ah,

117

120
00:07:43.451 --> 00:07:46.660
So you guys need to gather around and drink my fucking Koolaid.

122
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.030
I'll go buy a patch of fucking dirt out.
And I dunno,

123
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.880

124
00:07:57.881 --> 00:08:01.360
of the fucking world.
I know they had their floods there,
but believe me,

125
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.010
believe me,
when that shit's over,

126
00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:05.860
it's going to go right back to the shit they've been dealing with the last three

127
00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:09.700
years.
Um,
it was it three years.
I have no idea.

128
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.810
I don't know.
I'm doing this shit to fucking,

129
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.730
it's like one 13 in the morning and I got a cab to the airport at 10 30 so I

130
00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:22.690
know I'm not getting up in the morning.
Um,

131
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.460
I'm telling you guys,

Okay.

134
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.580
There's broke as college kids to come over here with a backpack and go all the

135
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:38.630
way through Europe.
And I remember when I was a young man,
long time ago,

136
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:40.460
I was a kid in college.
I remember thinking,

137
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.660
I want to do that and I never did it like an asshole.

138
00:08:44.661 --> 00:08:47.660
So then I got into the real world.
Even though I got into show business,

139
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:51.020
it's still the real fucking world.
And it took me half a century,

140
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:55.920
almost 47 years before I've been starting to come over here.
So,
um,

141
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.760
you should definitely fucking do it cause there's a bunch of ways to do it.

142
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:04.290
You can figure it out and uh,
I'm telling you,

143
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.300
if you just came over here for four or five days,

144
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.100
you just came over with four or five days,
sat in a cafe,
you know,

145
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.480
had yourself a drink and just watch the fucking city go by.
It's life changing,

146
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.090
telling you it's fucking life change.

147
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:20.910
And everybody tries to act like you got to come over here on your own.
God Damn,

148
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:25.230
yet you don't,
I got over here telling shit jokes and strip malls.

149
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.230
All right,
so I don't want to hear it.
If you want to come over here,

150
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:30.660
you can definitely fucking do it.
Um,

151
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.510
I wish I did it a long fucking time ago.

152
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:39.410
When I think of all the fucking money I blew on doing good Dole is going to

153
00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:44.640
fucking nicest is,
you know,
the dumb shit I did back in the day,

154
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.350
just blowing all this cash,
you know what I mean?
Plus she a young man,

155
00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:52.620
you fucking young,
they can stuff here in the back of the airplane.

156
00:09:52.621 --> 00:09:56.970
You shake it off.
Fucking old man like me.
I limp around for 10 days.

157
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.010
So,
uh,
I'm hoping,
um,

158
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.450
I'm hoping you guys here in some of these stories about coming over here.

159
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.400
You know,
maybe you don't want to come here,
maybe want to go somewhere else.

160
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.600
Fucking do it.

161
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.080
They looked before you get married and you've got kids and you're all fucking

162
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.610
locked down.
Just fucking,
I'm telling you figure out a way.

163
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:19.180
Stay home a couple of weekends.
I'm oversimplifying it,
but it really,
you know,

164
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:23.890
cut a plan,
you know,
get over here.
I said,
all right.
How many minutes away?

165
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.200
Up to at 10.
23.
All right.
What about,
I want to talk about it.
How about that?

166
00:10:27.201 --> 00:10:30.900
Fucking Tampa Bay lightning.
Huh?
I saw the,
uh,

167
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.940
the first period and then I fell asleep.
It's just,

168
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:34.740
they just come to the games and coming on too late.

169
00:10:34.741 --> 00:10:39.510
Like right now it's one 16 in the morning and I'm already on nhl.com wait for

170
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:41.780
this thing to start.
So already,

171
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.190
you know what's great is I don't have to watch the pregame,

172
00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:48.150
cause I know what they're saying.
Know I got at science and I as got to,

173
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.910
it's a must win for Chicago lay.

174
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:56.190
CanNot go down three one in this series and go back to Tampa.

175
00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:59.820
Wouldn't you agree?
Somebody else with a suit and a fucking pocket square.

176
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.300
Um,
but I got to say who,
who,

177
00:11:03.301 --> 00:11:06.240
who out there other than a hardcore black,
uh,

178
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:11.190
Tampa Bay lightening fan thought the Tampa Bay was going to be up to one,

179
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.080
especially have to Chicago when the first fucking game in Tampa.
Um,

180
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.560
but who,
who's kidding,
who,
you know,
Chicago's winning tonight.

181
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.020
I would be absolutely.
I don't want to jinx them,

182
00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:26.670
but I mean I would be shocked as a fucking fan if,

183
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.750
if Chicago goes back to Tampa.
Anything other than to to,
well,

184
00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:35.260
what else could they be three one down one,
three?
Yeah.
Obviously though.
Um,

185
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.220
I think the answer tonight and uh,

186
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.220
Oh man,
I hope it goes seven.

187
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.240
I hope it goes seven cause to tonight's the last game.
I'm Kinda gonna Miss.
Um,

188
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:49.440
I did see all the game too,
and I've missed all of the fucking NBA finals.

189
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.170
Um,
but that sounds like it's a great,
uh,
what is it?

190
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:59.410
Cavaliers are up to one against a golden state or as I like to call them

191
00:11:59.571 --> 00:12:04.550
Sacramento.
And
everybody's saying,

192
00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:06.170
what's his face there?

193
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.250
Steph curry hasn't been the same since they dropped them on the head.

194
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.200
I guess that's what the fuck they were talking about.

195
00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.370
I hope that isn't the case because whoever wins,
I'd like them to,
you know,

196
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.680
you don't want to see what their best guy be hurt and then you win.

197
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.190
You know what I mean?
You want to beat them at their best.
So,
um,

198
00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.580
I'm looking forward to seeing both of those things.

199
00:12:25.581 --> 00:12:27.200
I'm looking forward to seeing my dog.

200
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:32.090
I'm ready to come back and I'm ready to start this tour.
Um,

201
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.540
I,
I can't wait to get back.
So anyways,

202
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.750
what else did I want to talk about?
Jesus Christ.

203
00:12:38.751 --> 00:12:42.050
My fucking head is swimming here.
Hang on,
hang on.
Hang on.

204
00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.880
Father's Day's coming up,
right?
Do I got to talk about that Shit,

205
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:53.060
ma?
What do you mean not yet?
Really want?
What's too early?

206
00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.920
It isn't too early cause according to the advertiser and then we're advertising

207
00:12:57.921 --> 00:13:02.840
the man.
Great.
Nia,
the man,
great.
Hey,
attention grill masters.

208
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.310
If you have father

209
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.750
is a man of exquisite taste,

210
00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.640
there is no finer gift than the ultimate steak house experience.
Oh,

211
00:13:13.641 --> 00:13:16.820
you couldn't take him to the steak house?
No,
we're going to give him a man.
Great.

212
00:13:16.821 --> 00:13:18.090
And tell them to cook his own state

213
00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:24.770
that they're building them up like he's the most interesting man in the world.

214
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.580
This is now I'm just picturing some guy wearing fucking loafers in those stocks.

215
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.250
Grill in his backyard,
got a cigarette going or whatever.

216
00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.220
You know he wants a good take.
Good steak,
right man.

217
00:13:37.221 --> 00:13:41.600
Great is 100% cast iron.
Grill Grill grates the main brain.

218
00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.900
What is a man?
Great.
You ask or maybe you didn't,

219
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:47.570
but I'm going to tell you anyways,
man,

220
00:13:47.571 --> 00:13:52.571
grades are American made high quality 100% cast iron grill grates that sit right

221
00:13:52.851 --> 00:13:56.720
on top of your existing grill grates.
In other words,

222
00:13:56.721 --> 00:13:59.960
you bought a shitty little Hibachi and they're going to fix this thing for you,

223
00:13:59.961 --> 00:14:01.970
right?
It's like you bought a Chevy cavalier.

224
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.620
You didn't even get the z 24 and now they're going to throw the biggest engineer

225
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:10.310
they can't weighing in at eight pounds a piece.
Man,

tender meat with no flareups and perfect sear marks.

227
00:14:14.481 --> 00:14:17.270

228
00:14:17.271 --> 00:14:20.130
there's going to be a couple of gold dig and Stan and on the other study of

Is He really gonna wear it?

238
00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:01.590
Why don't you just slap them in the face with the man.
Great.
Jay,

239
00:15:01.591 --> 00:15:04.070
the guy likes steak.
Can you,
can you give him some dignity?

240
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.450
Kind of a fucking shirt,

241
00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:09.440
is that she'd give him a fucking clown nose and slap them with a rubber chicken.

242
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:15.500
Uh,
don't forget the brush man.

243
00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:16.430
Greatest design.

244
00:15:16.431 --> 00:15:21.431
They're long bristle brush to get down deep between each rail keeping your

245
00:15:21.831 --> 00:15:22.730
grates and prime.

246
00:15:22.731 --> 00:15:25.190
But why do they always got to have that dumb shit if you're grilling,

247
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.790
like you got to have an apron that says,
I hate Kale.

248
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.610
Why can't you like pork chops and a vegetable?

249
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:38.060
Don't you want that stuff to come out of your ass at some point in your life?
Um,

250
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:41.240
order.
But
I'm just seeing me.

251
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:45.020
Nothing else that's like those dummies that go on that diet,
dude.
I mean,

252
00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.690
not the bug bacon.
The weights fallen off make.

All right,
last one lastly,

258
00:16:08.721 --> 00:16:13.190
but not leastly.
Oh boy.
Here's the intro.
Everybody.

259
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:18.770
Hey,
hey.
Hey.
Dot,
dot,
dot.
Any of the pies there.
Hey,

260
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.960
we get their attention.
Hey,
hey,

261
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.820
you like Mike making money,
right?
Sure.
We all do.

262
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:33.140
Here's a really cool opportunity that evidently I had to share with you

263
00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.960
driving with Uber,
Uber,
Uber,

264
00:16:38.961 --> 00:16:42.800
in case you live under a fucking rock or you're over the age of 60 is that

265
00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:46.790
popular smartphone APP that connects writers with drivers.

266
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.750
Evidently,
I take Uber a bunch.
I wasn't aware of that.
Nia,

267
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:56.900
what else do I do that Uber knows that I don't do?
I love them by the way.

268
00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:01.610
Wow.
And in chatting with different drivers,

269
00:17:01.611 --> 00:17:05.630
some of them have really interesting stories as to why they drive with Uber.

270
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:09.200
Why did they do this?
Near Uber is absolutely crushing it.

271
00:17:09.201 --> 00:17:11.570
They're here in Paris right now.
I said this last time,

272
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.500
I don't take Uber because everybody's like my age and they watched fucking

273
00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:16.880
comedy central and they're like,
oh yeah,

274
00:17:16.881 --> 00:17:19.880
that freckled confirm that thing and now I know where you live.

275
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.750
And it weirds me out.
If I take a cab,
it's that low.
My friend,

276
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.210
I used to be neurosurgeon.
No,
I thrive in the carb.

277
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:34.910
Those guys don't give a shit and I do as hold my breath on the way.
Oh Man,

278
00:17:34.911 --> 00:17:39.860
I'm there.
God,

What generally spell?
Yeah,
and Irish people aren't drunk.

279
00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.850
Oh,
don't you dare,
don't you.
Let me tell you some.

280
00:17:43.851 --> 00:17:46.790
Anybody drives for 12 hours in a cab.
That's going to be a funk in there.

281
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.340
All right?
There's to be a little of Bootsy Collins up in the air,

282
00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:55.700
if you know what I mean.
And it Shannon with different noise.
Okay.
Bootsy Collins,

283
00:17:55.710 --> 00:18:00.360
the Bass player for Rod James Brown.
They played funk music.

284
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:04.280
Do I got to spell the whole thing out?
Oh fuck yes.

285
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.040
He's got some boots to get his,
I'm pitch there nothing.

286
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:14.040
What was that song when he came around?
Group is in the heart,
right?
What was the,

287
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.210
what was that thing he would say,
what was the thing he would say?

288
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.350
He had his one little know that one of the learning would say in that thing.

289
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:26.640
He be like you.
He would say something like that.

290
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:36.090
Anyway,
this is so,
this copy is so fucking dumb.
Listen,

291
00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:39.540

294
00:18:46.161 --> 00:18:49.410
It's easy to stat.
He just needed a car and a license.

295
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.490
Driving with Uber is great for anyone who needs flexibility.
Parents,

296
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.610
this is a really easy way to work around your family schedule.

297
00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:00.060
It's a great way to avoid your family.
Tunia you don't like the kids?
Hey,

298
00:19:00.061 --> 00:19:02.910

If I'm with you,

304
00:19:28.921 --> 00:19:32.100
I will be called to action.
You got a car and a license.

305
00:19:32.101 --> 00:19:35.400

311
00:19:51.871 --> 00:19:54.360
They stick in jail for fucking 30 years,
don't you?

312
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.090
Have you talked about that boogie board

313
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:05.960
and on my birthday?
Yeah,
I mentioned it.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.120
It's yard,

Yes it is.
It was.

315
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:14.270
It's one 25 in the morning and now begins the slow march to Karen sweets.

316
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:18.780
Not to test canter on sweet.
Come on.

317
00:20:18.781 --> 00:20:21.060
What does this fucking hockey game starting any,
by the way,

318
00:20:21.061 --> 00:20:24.180
I'm staying up all night watching this thing.
Are you really well,

319
00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:27.710
I'm going to stay up as long as I can.
We still have a bottle of wine left.

320
00:20:27.711 --> 00:20:29.730
I'd have finished that bottle of red.

321
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.790
Why don't they put wine in a cancer shock on it?

322
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.180
What did they put wine in a can see can shotgun it every once in a while.

323
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:41.430
Just take a fucking giant can of any wine.
He known the word not worth drinking.

324
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.550
Oh,
thank you,
mia.
You're so cultured.
I thought it was,

325
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.590
I thought it was the good stuff that is in the good stuff.

326
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.620
Doesn't Budweiser make a penal greenish

327
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.590
is how you say,
fuck your mother and French.

328
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:05.290
That's what I should have said to that guy.

329
00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:10.060
The guy in the fucking rickshaw bicycle,
but there's no need to escalate it to,

330
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.250
well,
I should have started with this,
right?
Yeah.
I should have started with this.

331
00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.550
Should have started with this.
Okay.
Yeah.

332
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.730
That's bullshit.
Yeah,
but there's really no,

333
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:27.500
then go Nomis Ja ga like,
no,
no mister.

334
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:33.490
That's bullshit.
But he say,
dude in French,
chief chief,

335
00:21:33.491 --> 00:21:36.110
remember we saw that kids today are the Eiffel Tower wearing a shirt.

336
00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:37.360
Then she'll dude,

337
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.350
how about those Gypsies that came up and tried to fucking pickpocket us?

338
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.410
Here's one for you.
Yeah.
When they come up to you,

339
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.130
when you were in a different country and like three people walk up to you with

340
00:21:48.131 --> 00:21:50.200
these,
uh,
with a clipboard,

341
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:53.710
clipboard paper with a bunch of what seems like signatures on it.

342
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:57.760
And then they walk up to you immediately speaking English.
They speak English.

343
00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.130
Yeah.
That may build this wet now.
And they just started,

344
00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.050
it hasn't walked away immediately.
They weren't.
No,
I didn't.
I said,
I said no.

345
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.740
I said with a French accent and then they walked away and I started speaking

346
00:22:08.741 --> 00:22:11.170
English and then one of them turned around and glared at me.
It's like,
fuck you.

347
00:22:11.171 --> 00:22:13.480
You're going to be,
yeah.
So as I explained there,

348
00:22:13.481 --> 00:22:18.190
let's save the Bald Eagles fucking thing.
But they're in your pockets.
Oh,

349
00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.930
party.
That's right.

350
00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:26.710
That's how you see chief chef.
So I should have been less.
Yeah,

351
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.910
no chef.

352
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:35.100
I was trying to talk like no cheese,
really bad dads out.

353
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:39.160
Bullshit and a dude.
It is.

354
00:22:39.161 --> 00:22:43.120
Wait dude it is and then,
then I walk.
Yeah.
Fuck your mother.
Right.

355
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.180
You can't walk away saying fuck fucking mother cause you get punched in the back

356
00:22:46.181 --> 00:22:50.470
of there.
You gotta you gotta Lock Eyes and whoever looks away first loses right.

357
00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:55.350
Is that how it works now?
Cause Cause I was,
I was saying look up do it.

358
00:22:55.351 --> 00:22:58.810
I added a lot of plug in Dunkin kid.
When are you looked that up?

359
00:22:58.811 --> 00:23:01.940
Because clearly you're just trying to like talk like a Boston asshole.

360
00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:03.040
I should have said that.

361
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.730
I should have said that because he wouldn't have known what it meant.
Like no,

362
00:23:06.731 --> 00:23:10.570
no the,
you know,
von sank each and it'd be a door.

363
00:23:10.571 --> 00:23:12.010
I gotta go to fucking donkey.

364
00:23:12.011 --> 00:23:14.530
So he wouldn't have not ever had no clue what I was saying.

365
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.800
And eventually he has to get on with his day
has do we?

366
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.490
Yeah,
he was pepe Le Pew though,
wasn't he?
Oh he was.

367
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.480
He was and he was so near,
did you have a good time over here?

368
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:32.610
I had an amazing time.
Well,

369
00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:37.270
what do you think of that kid on Silk Road?
Ooh,
on the wet road.

370
00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:42.190
Silk Road.
Oh,
the kid.
The guy that got sentenced to life.

371
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.690
Yeah.
Well what do we,
what are you thinking?
You think he just going to fuck?

372
00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.660
Evidently they got something here called the fucking,

373
00:23:48.661 --> 00:23:52.860
there's like an underground internet,
like the dark internet.
Yeah.
Oh really?

374
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:57.030
Yeah,
the deep Internet.
It's cold.
No it isn't.
Yes,

375
00:23:57.031 --> 00:24:00.900
it is actually easy because it has a regular internet that you serve,

376
00:24:00.901 --> 00:24:05.220
like Wikipedia and Google and your email.
What is this called?
The dark web.

377
00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:10.170
Okay,
good.
Deep Internet.
There's also,
they call it the deep,

378
00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.120
Deep Internet.
All right,
fine.

379
00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:16.260
I think that's where people like say stuff and then people just go,
oh wait,
shit.

380
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:19.620
Deep Web.
The deep web.
Okay,
you're close.
So close.

381
00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:22.210
<v 1>But yeah,
that's where all the illegal shit goes down.</v>

382
00:24:22.211 --> 00:24:26.380
But you really have to know the Internet,
I think too,
in order to get there.

383
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.650
It's not like the kind of thing.

384
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.560
<v 0>No,
it's shady.
It's like it's like buying drugs and looking at like kitty porn.</v>

385
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:37.600
Right,
exactly.
And then people arguing with that.
Ben Affleck is the new Batman.

386
00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:46.960
Oh,
hey,
how great was that video that we watched?
There was this white kid,
right?

387
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.530
W D dresses up like an old man and he

388
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:54.650
<v 1>kiki look like the um,
the,
the six flags.</v>

389
00:24:54.651 --> 00:24:58.370
Remember those commercials with the six flag with the old man and he'd be

390
00:24:58.371 --> 00:25:03.280
dancing and doing like the running man he'd,
they did,
they did,
they did it.

391
00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.090
People who are listening to this,
they remember those commercial,

392
00:25:06.091 --> 00:25:10.640
he's have those big dumb black glasses and it was clearly like a young kid and

393
00:25:10.641 --> 00:25:13.150
an old man mask and he'd be like doing the running.
Yeah,

394
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.481
<v 0>kid wasn't,</v>

395
00:25:14.481 --> 00:25:18.140
this kid had great makeup and people thought that he thought it wasn't,

396
00:25:18.141 --> 00:25:21.260
they thought it was an old man and he walks down the street late at night.

397
00:25:21.261 --> 00:25:23.060
He can do all those Michael Jackson moves.

398
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.870
So he walks like an old man and raise these people are walking by him going the

399
00:25:26.871 --> 00:25:27.291
other way.

400
00:25:27.291 --> 00:25:30.800
He'll just bust out one of those moves real quick and it freaks people the fuck

401
00:25:30.801 --> 00:25:33.770
out.
But the best part of the video is in the end,

402
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:37.430
he goes into this park late at night with,
there's all these,

403
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:42.460
these young black men right in their 20s than an old white man should be

404
00:25:42.681 --> 00:25:46.580
terrified of.
Right?
All these racist fucking white dude said,
terrified.

405
00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.680
He walks in right into the middle of him,

406
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:53.030
tells him all that clear out and starts busting out those moves and they went

407
00:25:53.031 --> 00:25:53.930
fucking nuts.

408
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.470
That was the funniest thing of could they have been more supportive?

409
00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:01.400
That's what was cracking me up about that.
Yeah.
They were going,

410
00:26:01.401 --> 00:26:05.540
they were slapping him on his old man's ass.
Tell,
tell them to keep going.

411
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:07.790
That one dude who was jumping up and down,

412
00:26:07.791 --> 00:26:12.320
my favorite one was a dude just standing on the bench with his arms up the exact

413
00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:15.430
same way.
Joe Montana,
when when he would throw for a touchdown pass,
he,

414
00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.770
he just put his arm straight up.
He was just doing that the whole time.

415
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.410
Like this guy is fucking killing it.

416
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.250
<v 1>I mean,
if you're a white person and you're not laying,</v>

417
00:26:24.251 --> 00:26:28.990
we will give you the respect that you do.
But if you're lame,
I get it.

418
00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:29.600
What

419
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.950
<v 0>now?
What does that mean?
You know what it means?
No,</v>

420
00:26:33.951 --> 00:26:36.080
I don't because there's a lot of the that could go either way.

421
00:26:36.081 --> 00:26:37.510
Like we're going to just say you're corny.

422
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.430
Get the fuck out of here or we're going to steal your bicycle.

423
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:44.130
You know,
you gotta

424
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.290
<v 1>get a frame.
I have no,
I'm talking about,</v>

425
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:50.000
I'm trying to bring people together with this shit.
All right.

426
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:53.760
You left it all ambiguous.
Then the black people that are listening,

427
00:26:53.761 --> 00:26:57.600
they know what I'm talking about.
You know you've done that twice.

428
00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.330
What do you mean,
where you'd say something?

429
00:27:00.331 --> 00:27:02.040
I don't know what you're talking about and you're like,
yeah,

430
00:27:02.041 --> 00:27:04.770
well people will listen to understand what I'm saying because I don't feel the

431
00:27:04.771 --> 00:27:06.990
need to have to explain every single little thing to you.

432
00:27:06.991 --> 00:27:09.620
That's not what I'm here for.
Jesus.
She wouldn't,

433
00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:12.720
you didn't think that I took her to like Paris,
Virginia at this point.

434
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:16.710
You'd think they'd get a little more.
Yeah.
And ignore my birthday.

435
00:27:16.711 --> 00:27:20.630
Just ended an hour and a half ago.
That's,
see,

436
00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:25.880
that's what it is guys.
When she got to know it doesn't mean shit.
Oh,

437
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:30.840
you look so handsome tonight.
Oh yeah.
I crushed him tonight,
everybody.

438
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:35.790
I went out and finally gave in to the sport coat life.

439
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.610
This is what I did.
I just saw in the pocket square life,

440
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.810
I decided that I was going to out French the frog.

441
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.920
Fuck these people with their fucking,
you know,
slick way of dressing.

442
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.060
And it went out and I got this fucking coolest sport coat with the pocket.

443
00:27:51.061 --> 00:27:54.870
Square,
the fucking shirt.
The pants look so good.

444
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:59.400
I was killing it,
killing it.
And then what happens tonight?
We went out,

445
00:27:59.401 --> 00:28:04.020
we got to that,
that fucking,
that restaurant.
They had no reservations.

446
00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:07.360
We had no reservation,
all no reservation.
Then we were like,
can we say,

447
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.390
can we sit reservation?
And we say,

448
00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.440
can we sit at the fucking bar chief and shed?

449
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.930
And they let us sit up at the bar.
We had a great uh,

450
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:23.520
a great dinner and like the head chef was there and he had these fucking
unbaked,

451
00:28:23.521 --> 00:28:27.060
unbelievable tattoos,
beautiful tattoos,
great work.

452
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.220
We taught with chatting them up about that.

453
00:28:29.221 --> 00:28:32.850
Next thing you know he's hooking us up with shots.
Two rounds of shots.

454
00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.630
Have you guys ever had Keno?
Viacom?
Nobody's ever had that.

455
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:40.560
I've ever had keynote with [inaudible] was really sounds like some whole foods

456
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.950
hippy dippy and noise out of fucking horrific.
I didn't want it and he said it.

457
00:28:44.951 --> 00:28:45.560
I didn't want.

458
00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.320
And knowing if someone said [inaudible] don't even just want to like slap them

459
00:28:49.321 --> 00:28:49.741
in the face.

460
00:28:49.741 --> 00:28:53.040
A little burlap sack like as is the dumbest thing you've ever heard of.

461
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:57.330
But it turns out it's delicious.
It tastes like water,

462
00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.970
which is the way vodka.
Yeah,
I got a minute.

463
00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:03.120
We did two not rubbing out cause we did two quick shots and I didn't feel

464
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:07.440
anything but I feel like I got a nice little buzz going on but not so much that

465
00:29:07.441 --> 00:29:10.020
I'm going to,
you know,
do something stupid.

466
00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:13.590
I think I'm such a booze bag that I wouldn't have done like another four.

467
00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.390
That's also true to feel anything.

468
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:18.290
You've been a bull's bag for the last 10 days though.

469
00:29:18.291 --> 00:29:22.560
Now last 10 days it goes back to the southern tour and then the ninth 19 shows

470
00:29:22.561 --> 00:29:25.020
in Boston.
And then I sobered up.

471
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:29.100
Didn't fucking do shit just because I had the helicopter thing.

472
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:32.190
I got that behind me.
And ever since then,
Jesus Christ.

473
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:37.440
So what happens when we go back home to my eye?
We bought dry out or dry out.

474
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.680
We're going to dry out.
We're going to exercise.
We're kind of like,

475
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.620
do you know what you want?
I want right now.
You don't want,
I want,

476
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:44.200
I want to fucking the regular cheese.
No,

477
00:29:44.201 --> 00:29:48.910
I want a giant fucking Poland spring.
I want to like two of those.

478
00:29:48.911 --> 00:29:52.360
You know those dumb hats had drunks were at football games and in the 80s where

479
00:29:52.361 --> 00:29:54.620
they had a beer in each one,
I want a giant water.
Oh,

480
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:58.180
and the two comes down to your mouth and you can drink it out of the,

481
00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:02.500
what is the point of that?
Just for funsies and silliness and did it well.

482
00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:04.550
I don't that kind of cheap to me.
Yeah.

483
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:08.110
Well I don't think that when they sold it to grown men,
as dumb as it was,

484
00:30:08.111 --> 00:30:09.880
they said this is just for funsies.

485
00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:17.500
Hey guys,
this is just for funsies the next time you're drinking.

486
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.950
Um,
so anyways,
not reading about Silk Road.
Oh,

487
00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:28.360
oh shit.
Look what look what's on.

488
00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.970
It's three hours.
What does an ace tracker,
oh,
attracts a,

489
00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:37.620
the quality of ice in different venues.
No,

490
00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:40.300
I'm totally serious.
What do you mean quality?
Well,
look,

491
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.760
if I can put it to where it freezes and then your skied on it.
No quality.

492
00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:48.390
What do you mean?
Well back in the day,
you know,
the Boston Art Garden,

493
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.520
they would have it be a little mushy because Edmonton Mattoon was faster than we

494
00:30:51.521 --> 00:30:55.750
would.
We turn it down a little bit mushy,
mushy,
like the ice,
but you know,

495
00:30:55.751 --> 00:30:59.740
it's a little slushy.
Yeah,
everybody did.
Everybody would do that.

496
00:30:59.741 --> 00:31:03.430
And then fucking Edmonton was fast,
so they would turn this extra called,

497
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.530
it's like Brady had take a little layer out.

498
00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.020
Fucking this guy puts a little more air ran.
It was bullshit.

499
00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.780
But you're all ice skaters,

500
00:31:10.781 --> 00:31:15.640
so why would you just make it optimal first of all?
And everyone's on the same.

501
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.980
I don't know what,
first of all,
I don't know what ice tracker is.

502
00:31:17.981 --> 00:31:22.420
I just made that shit up.
But no,
but Boston did.
Boston did get accused.

503
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:27.820
Boston did get accused of,
uh,
of,
of having the ice a little,

504
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.740
little mushy to give him a chance in the beginning of kids have a lot of things.

505
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:35.140
I,
everybody's getting accused of Shit over the years.

506
00:31:35.141 --> 00:31:37.120
We're just only going to get suspended and find the,

507
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:41.800
the Bruins didn't get suspended a fine for it.
Hmm.
Okay.

508
00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.120
Well now it's dumb.

509
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:48.100
You'd a week Jim or say put a fucking a banner up at Lucas oil field that said

510
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:52.420
2014 AFC finalist and I don't know,

511
00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.060
maybe he's using again.
I don't know what his deal is.

512
00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.090
That's such a low block game will begin soon.
Yeah.
The going to the Internet.

513
00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:03.760
Right.
Which means that they're uh,
showing some Ritz cracker commercial,

514
00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:08.800
but France,
uh,
cause we were talking about the book that I'm reading right now.

515
00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.250
Done as it over.
No,
go ahead.
What do you mean?

516
00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:19.030
Like I was telling you earlier tonight that I hate when you try to show me up by

517
00:32:19.031 --> 00:32:23.260
reading,
by the way,
but I'm really late on reading this book.

518
00:32:23.261 --> 00:32:27.580
I'm really laying on reading gone girl.
We saw the movie ages ago obviously.

519
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:32.110
Uh,
and now I'm finally being the book cause it was here and which one was gone?

520
00:32:32.111 --> 00:32:36.930
Girl.
Are you joking with Ben Affleck or he did gone.

521
00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:41.090
Baby gone in.
Gone Girl.
So gone girl was the one that's good plan.
Yeah,

522
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.840
he directed that was like,
you know Chuck Berry.
You did,

523
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.730
you did twist in the next year.
He came out with twist again.
Yes.

524
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.470
Chuck Berry and Ben Affleck.
Chuck Berry like Chubby,
Chubby Checker,

525
00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.790
Chubby checker.
Let's do the twist.

526
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:04.150
And then a year later he was like twist again like we did last summer.

527
00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:10.280
I feel like we sound like right

528
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:17.510
junior from a,
what is it,
the Cleveland show

529
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:23.570
maybe.
Maybe Cleveland.
Sounds like Chuck Berry.
I mean fucking Chubby checker.

530
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:28.660
My name is Cleveland Brown and I am here to say back in my,

531
00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:33.140
Oh no,
he didn't talk like that now his son dead with son die.

532
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.730
What?
No,
it's a cartoon.
Anyway,
it's just the way he said that.

533
00:33:37.731 --> 00:33:41.630
I thought he was dead.
He was overweight.
I was just saying I was reading,

534
00:33:41.631 --> 00:33:45.470
I've been reading this book and gone girl and speaking of Boston,

535
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:50.530
I just feel like Ben Affleck couldn't be more perfect casting for the role of

536
00:33:52.131 --> 00:33:54.800
nick cause you've never met him and you've read a bunch of,

537
00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:57.470
I have met him.

538
00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:05.420
I met him and I shook his hand.
Remember

539
00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:17.180
that meeting the guys he walks by don't know him,

540
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:20.200
but it was perfect cast as he was on his way to knowing,

541
00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.080
to talk to people that he actually,
no,

542
00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:32.780
when we follow each other on Twitter are ridiculous.

543
00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.920
I don't know him at all.

544
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.620
Flashed your fucking chocolate Brown eyes at him.

545
00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.080
Couldn't care less

546
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:55.520
fucking stupid videos.
What is wrong with you?

547
00:34:55.521 --> 00:34:58.110
You really have the mentality of a 15 year old boy.

548
00:34:58.111 --> 00:35:00.080
Sometimes I swear to fucking God,

549
00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.710
fucking gossip rags.

550
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.780
They're getting divorced or not.
What do you give a fuck?

551
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:21.380
Same video over and over again and falling down

552
00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:26.160
and getting into a fight.

553
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:35.770
We about Bro,

554
00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.740
we'll come at Bro.
All right bro.

555
00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:43.090
Some douchebag holding this Goddamn old ass Samsung.

556
00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:46.450
That's all I watch.

557
00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:51.220
I watch by watch puppies and babies,
so watch those,
those fucking videos.

558
00:35:51.221 --> 00:35:52.090
They make me laugh.

559
00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.260
I love watch the ones where the dogs are afraid to walk by the cats.

560
00:35:56.130 --> 00:36:00.130
I watched EDC on an ATV falling up and his friend be like,

561
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:08.080
no,
no,
I got it.
Totally got.
Anyway,

562
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:13.480
what do you read the read fucking pink is the new blog does he draws those decks

563
00:36:13.481 --> 00:36:15.550
on everybody's faces with the jazz on?

564
00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.520
Is a couple of things wrong with what you just said.
Number one,

565
00:36:18.521 --> 00:36:22.420
pink is a new blog.
Hasn't been,
well,
maybe it's still blocked.
Still have like,

566
00:36:22.421 --> 00:36:22.810
I don't know,

567
00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:27.010
but that was something that I read when we first dated like in 2005 or
something.

568
00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:29.890
Okay.
That's the one.
Yeah,
but you still did it.

569
00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.330
The drawing of the digs and things was by Perez Hilton,

570
00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:38.350
and I haven't read that in.
I don't even know how long.
All right.
Well,
yeah.

571
00:36:38.351 --> 00:36:43.090
So what,
how was that better than what the fuck I'm watching?
I don't know.

572
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:47.230
Well,
there you go.
Then.
I thought fuck is wrong with you.
I watch easy,

573
00:36:47.231 --> 00:36:51.250
fun based stuff with tabs.
100 amazing baselines.

574
00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:54.490
I watched somebody do a Stevie ray Vaughan covered today.

575
00:36:54.491 --> 00:36:59.430
I watched a bunch of Stevie ray Vaughan videos.
I was watching his shit.
I watch,

576
00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.480
uh,
what do I got?
A girl knockouts.

577
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:05.080
Golf fights to the worst because they're just grab each other's house.

578
00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.750
Hair's all street fighting

579
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.700
and you go one punch knockout number on the bottom.

580
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:18.170
That seems numbers in the bottom.
That's somebody's phone number.

581
00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:19.813
That's a phone number.

582
00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:24.320
That's New Jersey Two oh one four oh six it's an actual,

583
00:37:24.321 --> 00:37:28.900
is that 201 billion?
406 million?
No,

584
00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:32.200
no,
no,
no.
All right,

585
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:37.210
well that's a hundred that's 1,010 thousand a hundred thousand that's a million.

586
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:41.900
That's 100 million.
That's a billion.
Okay,

587
00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.190
that's 100 billion.
That's a trillion.
That'd be 20 trillion.

588
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.820
What is the point of all this?
No,

589
00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.860
cause I actually realized I see a number like that and I wouldn't know how to

590
00:37:51.861 --> 00:37:56.390
read it that way.
Well,
it helps if they put commas in it
all.
Okay.

591
00:37:56.391 --> 00:38:00.800
This is all street fighting.
One hitter,
one hitter,
quitter.
Greatest,
one punch,

592
00:38:00.801 --> 00:38:05.360
knockout ever a compilation.
Part one.
Let's watch some of these.

593
00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:10.040
Why though?
Oh,
this is boxing.
Come on.

594
00:38:10.041 --> 00:38:10.960
White to just once.

595
00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:16.470
[inaudible] wow.

596
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.710
Wow.
You barely touched him.

597
00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:28.620
Seriously.
No.
What I call bullshit.
That's some fucking,

598
00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:32.140
you know,
pulp fiction in the suits.

599
00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:37.060
Your ass goes down.
Like that's what that,
that's a Marcellus Wallace.

600
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:42.130
<v 0>Take the money and run.
Listen,
whether you believe it or not,</v>

601
00:38:42.131 --> 00:38:47.050
you're already into the video.
I know.
Yeah.
It's crazy.

602
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:51.460
Violence can be enjoyable.
We need to end this thing.

603
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:57.010
Listen to everybody.
I'm back,
uh,
back in the U S and,
uh,

604
00:38:58.540 --> 00:38:59.770
I can't wait to do this tour,

605
00:38:59.771 --> 00:39:04.450
so thank you to everybody who came out to my show so I could take my lovely wife

606
00:39:04.451 --> 00:39:06.160
here to Paris.
I never thank you guys for that,

607
00:39:06.161 --> 00:39:10.510
but it goes without saying thank you.
And um,

608
00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:15.070
and they get everybody who's shown up on this,
uh,
on this next tour coming up.
Uh,

609
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:18.480
I can't wait to do it and I've never toured this with,

610
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:21.580
I've done some shows with bargaining,
but I've never gone on a run like this,

611
00:39:21.581 --> 00:39:24.190
so it's going to be fucking great.
And uh,

612
00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:27.220
I'm really looking forward to getting back and seeing all clearly,
oh,

613
00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:31.180
when we get back.
All right,
they go shut up.

614
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:38.980
Um,
that's it.
Um,
you guys have a great weekend and I'll talk to you.

615
00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:40.013
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

616
00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:50.020
[inaudible]

617
00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:02.773
yes.

618
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:07.830
<v 4>He has some conspiracy theory for you.
Somebody said bill that they uh,
he wrote,</v>

619
00:40:07.831 --> 00:40:10.970
they are watching and um,

620
00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:14.490
I got trashed for talking about conspiracy theory.

621
00:40:14.491 --> 00:40:19.050
I've been trashed for talking about those automated checkout lines in the

622
00:40:19.051 --> 00:40:23.700
grocery store and saying that I'm paranoid and I'm afraid of technology and all

623
00:40:23.701 --> 00:40:27.750
this technology's just going to help my life and make my life more easier.

624
00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:31.230
And why don't you trust these big fucking corporations?

625
00:40:31.231 --> 00:40:33.360
Basically it's the shit that people are giving me,

626
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.400
so I have to get trashed for off,
you know,

627
00:40:35.401 --> 00:40:39.900
talking shit about all these corporations and actually having the audacity to

628
00:40:39.901 --> 00:40:40.770
think that bankers,

629
00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:45.771
we're all trying to team up and have one world bank yet up to become the loan

630
00:40:46.051 --> 00:40:50.430
sharks for not everyone,
not only individual but actual countries.

631
00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:52.853
Okay.

632
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:57.270
Which is something that I was thinking about when I was at the Rose Bowl was

633
00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:01.410
stone sober and I was sitting there on the golf course and I was looking at

634
00:41:01.411 --> 00:41:06.411
these houses up on up on the ridge of this hill that actually looked down on,

635
00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:09.390
on the Roosevelt,
the granddaddy of them.

636
00:41:09.391 --> 00:41:11.790
All of these people have a house that looks down on it

637
00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:17.250
and I was actually envisioning that those were all bankers up there and while

638
00:41:17.251 --> 00:41:22.251
the game was going on and 104,000 people or 96,000 we ever showed up for that

639
00:41:22.621 --> 00:41:24.480
game was sitting there going fucking crazy.

640
00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:29.130
One of those pieces of Shit bankers up there could put his hand on his son's

641
00:41:29.131 --> 00:41:33.260
shoulder and be like,
see all those people down there,
they owe all of us money.

642
00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:40.080
They all owe me money,
son.
I'm getting a piece of all of their fucking paychecks.

643
00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:41.243
And they don't even know it.

644
00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:45.900
They don't even know that their daddy is looking down on him right now.

645
00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:48.060
Now had been drinking

646
00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:54.400
that thought would have probably caused me to,
uh,
you know,

647
00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:57.700
entertain the thought of climbing up that hill and throwing a rock through one

648
00:41:57.701 --> 00:41:58.181
of the windows,

649
00:41:58.181 --> 00:42:01.900
which of course I wouldn't have done because even my drunkest I am aware that I

650
00:42:01.901 --> 00:42:05.340
don't want to go to jail and get raped.
And secondly,
I really,

651
00:42:05.341 --> 00:42:06.910
I'm not going to go all the way up that fucking help.

652
00:42:06.911 --> 00:42:10.180
So what I would've done is I probably would have yelled at that kid with the

653
00:42:10.181 --> 00:42:14.740
light purple slacks.
I would've commented really loud about that dude's fucking,

654
00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:18.220
uh,
Eczema flaking off into the back of his damn sweatshirt.

655
00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.780
Um,
so anyways,
this guy sends me this email and he says,

656
00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:27.340
build the vase in this blog.
When I say they are watching our big business,

657
00:42:27.341 --> 00:42:31.270
not the Illuminati,
but they are just as evil as any bank or secret society.

658
00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:34.780
They don't even need your signature.
Listen to this shit.

659
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.850
They don't even need your signature for these information gathering trader where

660
00:42:39.851 --> 00:42:44.770
programs to monitor everything from where the device is to what your heart rate

661
00:42:44.771 --> 00:42:48.700
is.
It's what is trade where.
That's the question I had.

662
00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:49.811
Um,

663
00:42:49.811 --> 00:42:54.811
you digital camera may embed metadata into photographs with cameras,

664
00:42:55.241 --> 00:42:57.820
serial number or your location.

665
00:42:57.821 --> 00:43:01.660
Your printer may be incorporating a secret code on every page at prince,

666
00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:06.040
which could be used to identify the printer and potentially the person who used

667
00:43:06.041 --> 00:43:10.210
it.
Now,
now the fucking morons,
the sheep out there,
it'd be like,
yeah,

668
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:15.160
that's in case she threatened the president ditches doing it for the good of all

669
00:43:15.161 --> 00:43:19.510
people.
Um,
if apple puts a particularly creepy patent,

670
00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:24.470
I guess Apple's applying for this as a recently applied for the use,
um,

671
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:25.270
for,
um,

672
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:29.860
you can look forward to a day when your iPhone may record your voice.

673
00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.760
Take a picture of your location,
record your heartbeat,

674
00:43:33.761 --> 00:43:36.640
and send that information back to the mothership.

675
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:41.890
This is trade aware devices that act behind your back and portray,

676
00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:46.510
portray your privacy.
Now this is what the moron sheep are going to be to say,

677
00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:51.190
well they,
he ain't doing nothing wrong.
What's the problem?

678
00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.510
That's,
that's the philosophy.

679
00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.690
That was the philosophy behind why they can record your phone calls.
Now,

680
00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:00.150
if you ain't doing nothing,
we're tacy.

681
00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:04.380
You come out frogs gate doing nothing wrong.

682
00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:10.770
Do you realize how fucking dumb that mindset is?

683
00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:16.970
So basically as long as you do what the people in power tell you what to do,

684
00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:18.990
you won't have a problem.

685
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.740
Do you understand how dangerous that is?

686
00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:29.460
Do you understand how fucking stupid it is to have that level of faith in the

687
00:44:29.461 --> 00:44:32.010
people who rule you?
You know what I

688
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:36.600
<v 0>mean?
Hey,
you haven't noticed</v>

689
00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.920
<v 4>how much power can fuck somebody over.</v>

690
00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.700
Like for some reason we only seem to focus on when celebrities get famous and

691
00:44:43.701 --> 00:44:47.030
then they wig out and start becoming these fucking mini tyrants.

692
00:44:47.031 --> 00:44:52.031
For some reason people don't feel they just have like this because they waved

693
00:44:52.061 --> 00:44:53.300
the flag and they,
they,

694
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:57.170
and they play those songs that make you choked up that they never feel like that

695
00:44:57.171 --> 00:44:59.450
they'll have any sort of ulterior motive for this.

696
00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:02.600
This is the type of technology

697
00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:08.050
<v 0>that allows a small group of people to take over the world.</v>

698
00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:14.170
<v 4>Something that's sociopath's have been trying to do since the beginning of time</v>

699
00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:19.220
and they were never able to do it because at some point your army would be

700
00:45:19.221 --> 00:45:20.150
stretched too thin,

701
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:22.493
<v 0>right?</v>

702
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:25.420
<v 4>Germans,
the fucking Roman empire,
all that shit.</v>

703
00:45:25.421 --> 00:45:27.950
At some point the fucking Japanese,
all of them,

704
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:29.690
everybody who's ever tried to fucking do it,

705
00:45:29.691 --> 00:45:32.310
at some point it gets stretched too thin.

706
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:38.500
<v 0>So America,
what we've done is we,
then,
we,
we've,
we've done the,
uh,</v>

707
00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:42.920
we're putting this base here to protect you thing,
that brilliant thing.

708
00:45:42.921 --> 00:45:47.450
That's how we got our world empire.
So we just have a base.

709
00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.720
Then also we have these insane weapons where we can nuke everybody.

710
00:45:50.721 --> 00:45:53.270
So we were able to kind of do it that way.
But the problem is,

711
00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.450
is when you really get into sociopathic thought,

712
00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:02.320
and just like those people who are so into power that it makes it dick hard is

713
00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:07.190
they want to know.
They want to be able to see everybody,

714
00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:11.990
know what they're thinking and know what they're doing at all times because not

715
00:46:11.991 --> 00:46:12.801
only they psychos,

716
00:46:12.801 --> 00:46:16.640
but with that level of power becomes this unbelievable level of paranoia.

717
00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:20.420
Like those people with those houses sitting on the ridge looking down into the

718
00:46:20.421 --> 00:46:23.630
rose bowl,
there's a fear.
Like we sit there looking up at it,

719
00:46:23.631 --> 00:46:24.980
go look at they got the fucking world.

720
00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:30.080
There was a fear of when you attain that level of wealth,
of losing all of it,

721
00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.100
and you begin on this,

722
00:46:34.101 --> 00:46:38.420
this quest to quiet your mind,
you want,

723
00:46:38.421 --> 00:46:43.421
you want to get a level of wealth and controlling your life that you are

724
00:46:44.451 --> 00:46:49.451
guaranteed that it will never go away in your lifetime or your kids' lifetime or

725
00:46:50.031 --> 00:46:50.930
your kids' kids.

726
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:55.460
So basically everybody that you know and love will be okay and you will be okay.

727
00:46:56.420 --> 00:47:00.770
You get into that psychotic fucking mindset and uh,

728
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:04.910
<v 4>you give those kinds of people this level of fucking technology and you're going</v>

729
00:47:04.911 --> 00:47:08.980
to have a problem.
I think that's unbelievable.
But that this shit is,

730
00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:11.730
so they have this,
this website here,
uh,

731
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:15.420
the eff electronic frontier foundation that is trying to fight

732
00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:21.110
these things being put into,
into the detect,
you know,
the cameras,

733
00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.790
the cell phones and all that shit.

734
00:47:22.791 --> 00:47:26.450
Like the fact that there's a tracking device in your cell phone.
Like,

735
00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:28.100
how come we didn't get to vote on that?

736
00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:31.600
How come we don't get to vote on that type of stuff?

737
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:35.410
I don't want people knowing where the fuck I am and all God damn times.
Okay,

738
00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:37.450
and I don't need you to show me,
Oh,

739
00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:41.080
we caught this fucking child molester with that.
So because of that,

740
00:47:41.081 --> 00:47:45.250
now everybody has to be like,
give me a fucking break.
They always have like,

741
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:47.130
you know,
that there's,
you know,

742
00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:50.950
a handful of good examples for that level of fucking control and then does a

743
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:55.210
zillion bad ones.
So I am 100% against the shit.

744
00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:57.570
And,
um,

745
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:00.790
there's always been evil people in the fucking world.

746
00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:05.170
There's always going to be evil fucking people in the world.
And when you get,

747
00:48:05.171 --> 00:48:08.620
when you have this kind of technology that you're going to,
you're going to stop.

748
00:48:08.621 --> 00:48:13.390
They're going to stop small,
evil like individual,
you know,

749
00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:18.340
uh,
a fucking a serial rapist.
What?
You definitely want to stop,

750
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:19.833
all right?

751
00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:25.260
But the price we're going to pay is you're going to allow a Stalin or a Hitler

752
00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:27.250
Pol Pot,

753
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:31.060
whoever the fuck you wanted that you to leave with that level of technology out

754
00:48:31.061 --> 00:48:35.140
to someone like that could get in power and run the fucking world.

755
00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.680
So,
you know,
I dunno,
I,
I

756
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:42.450
<v 0>totally 100% believe that you could roll all your fucking eyes all you want.</v>

757
00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:44.460
I honestly believe that.

758
00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:48.630
And I also believe that the reason why there's so many of us right now and that

759
00:48:48.631 --> 00:48:51.390
the people at the top are not fucking concerned about it,

760
00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:52.970
<v 4>okay.</v>

761
00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:56.960
<v 0>Is because we're all expendable.
And when the waters rise up,</v>

762
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:58.910
the temperatures goes up and everything,

763
00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.650
they're not going to be the ones who are drowning.

764
00:49:00.651 --> 00:49:04.280
You can guarantee that the user in our taxpayer money to build some sort of

765
00:49:04.281 --> 00:49:06.740
something to make sure that they're okay.

766
00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:10.190
And I think that their bailout plan because they know they can't stop people

767
00:49:10.191 --> 00:49:10.821
from fucking,

768
00:49:10.821 --> 00:49:15.821
because it feels too God damn good and Dixon pussies are readily available to

769
00:49:16.011 --> 00:49:18.230
anyone.
It's like air,
you know?

770
00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:19.900
<v 3>Okay.</v>

771
00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:23.830
<v 0>So I think what they're going to gradually do is phase us out with robots and</v>

772
00:49:23.831 --> 00:49:27.580
automated shit,
which is why I refuse to use it now.

773
00:49:27.581 --> 00:49:29.350
How fucking crazy do I sound right now?

774
00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:32.770
Has there been anything funny in the last fucking five?

775
00:49:32.771 --> 00:49:34.240
This is shit that I truly believe.

776
00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:38.590
You know corporations own like the DNA of a grizzly bear.

777
00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:42.370
That's why they don't give a fuck that they're cutting down its habitat.

778
00:49:42.371 --> 00:49:45.490
They're like,
I will fucking grow another one in a petri dish.

779
00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:50.870
<v 4>We're trying to take over everything and then wipe out.</v>

780
00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:55.310
I think they're going to try to wipe out the poor and the middle class keep a

781
00:49:55.311 --> 00:49:58.490
couple of us,
like a small handful of us.
You know,

782
00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:02.690
the way that pandas are only in like a zoos at this point or some shit.

783
00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:05.190
I don't know.
Maybe I pick the wrong fucking animal,
but that,
that,
that,

784
00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.870
that's the direction I think it's going.
All right.
This is your first crazy rant,

785
00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:14.330
which was based mainly in gut feelings in a couple of emails.
But,
um,

786
00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.200
I truly believe that

787
00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:24.200
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

788
00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.353
okay.

789
00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:39.810
<v 0>Speaking of what do you guys realize that right now,
Brett Farve</v>

790
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:46.470
is getting sued some of the ship.
How fucked up the world is right now.

791
00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:51.660
Brett Farve is getting sued by the,

792
00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:56.170
uh,
by to Massachusetts because he tried to get,
uh,

793
00:50:56.490 --> 00:50:59.930
some sort of sexual favors afterwards and they're,
they're,

794
00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:00.870
they're suing for that.

795
00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:02.660
<v 3>Okay.</v>

796
00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:05.970
<v 0>Do you understand that?
Let me say just one more time.</v>

797
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.100
Brett Farve is getting sued by a Mizzou tumor.

798
00:51:09.101 --> 00:51:13.720
Susis does that how he said my son says,
um,

799
00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:18.720
mousses um,
tumor Zzusis for,

800
00:51:18.721 --> 00:51:21.970
for asking basically to,
uh,
you know,

801
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:25.470
to bang them at the end of it,
there's sewing him.

802
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:30.390
Can you fucking believe that I just fucking bus that will,

803
00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.260
you know what that's like?

804
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:35.640
That's like me suing a comedy club because I got heckled.

805
00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:41.810
It comes with the job.
There was not any machine,

806
00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:46.230
any female most suits out there that listens to this podcast.

807
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:48.990
Are you honestly going to tell me that?

808
00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:54.090
That you've been rubbing guys bags and their legs and the chest and all that and

809
00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:58.650
you've,
no one has ever asked you for a fucking hand job at the end of it.

810
00:51:58.651 --> 00:52:02.490
It fucking comes with the territory.
That's like being a cop.

811
00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:06.870
And so when the city,
cause you got shot at
all,
right?

812
00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:13.520
You fucking put hot oil all over a guy's body and you rub everything but their

813
00:52:14.071 --> 00:52:18.750
dick.
I mean give me a fucking break.
You goddamn cock cheeses.
Yeah.

814
00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.650
People are going to ask you to rub one out.
Okay?
And if you had a shred,

815
00:52:21.651 --> 00:52:26.010
a fucking decency,
you do what?
You complete the Goddamn job.
All right?

816
00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:30.360
Because you signed says full body massage.
All right,

817
00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:35.740
last I saw my dick is still part of my body.
All right.
You know what they are?

818
00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:39.750
What?
As Susan is a like,
they like the fucking quarterback who can't get it done.

819
00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:43.380
You know,
just always comes up a little bit short.

820
00:52:43.381 --> 00:52:45.170
They should fucking interview them afterwards.
So,
you know,

821
00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:49.080
like what happened in there?
Uh,
you know,
I just didn't,
just didn't get it done.

822
00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:51.900
You know,
it's was like right there.
All I do is just reach out and grab it.

823
00:52:51.901 --> 00:52:56.130
And I just,
uh,
you know,
we didn't want it.

824
00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:01.110
We didn't want it as much as they wanted it.
Um,
that's just like,

825
00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:04.380
just,
that's such a classic,
uh,
piggyback lawsuit.

826
00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:08.830
It's like once that first stupid whore,
um,

827
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:12.420
you know,
gay Brett Farve Shit,

828
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:16.720
this is very interesting that I've noticed about horse.

829
00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.940
Once one comes out of the woodwork,

830
00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:22.090
then all of a sudden 20 come out of the woodwork,
you know,

831
00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:26.090
and then they always try to paint it as well.
We were too scared.
We were scared.

832
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:27.530
<v 4>Fuck you.
You were,</v>

833
00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:31.580
you trying to make money and you're trying to build on the momentum of the other

834
00:53:31.581 --> 00:53:36.500
case.
That's the female version of pulling a train on somebody.
You know,

835
00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:41.090
the guy version is,
you know,
you and 80 of friends,
bang the same girl.

836
00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:43.430
The female version is,
you know,

837
00:53:43.431 --> 00:53:48.431
you're a fucking whore and you're just waiting for a whore to sue a guy that you

838
00:53:48.711 --> 00:53:53.180
fucking banked and then you fucking,
you,
you draft in right behind their lawsuit.

839
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:56.010
Okay?
You know some of those myths,
Susa State,

840
00:53:56.020 --> 00:54:00.530
and they'll actually come to your house and give you a full body rub down with

841
00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:02.540
oil.
Okay?

842
00:54:02.541 --> 00:54:06.920
And then have the fucking nerve to get upset that you try to get a hand job at

843
00:54:06.921 --> 00:54:10.880
the end of it.
You know,
give me a fucking break.

844
00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:16.720
Why don't you fucking [inaudible] broads man the fuck up and start rubbing one

845
00:54:17.211 --> 00:54:20.930
out?
Is it that God damn hard,
no pun intended.

846
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:26.270
Is it that fucking difficult
to just fucking,
you know,

847
00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:31.850
it's like you're revving a motorcycle.
That's it.
That's all you gotta do.

848
00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:36.320
Up and down,
up and down with that dead fucking oil.
You in and out.

849
00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:42.200
You want that house on the hill,
sweetheart?
There's a price to pay.
All right?

850
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:46.610
And when a quarterback who owns every fucking record,
good and bad,

851
00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:50.030
and the Goddamn universe asked you to rub one out,
God damn it.

852
00:54:50.031 --> 00:54:54.260
You fucking rub one out.
Well,
maybe you don't blog in this business sister.

853
00:54:54.261 --> 00:54:56.990
That's right.
Stare at your fucking manicured toes.

854
00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:01.210
Pedicured whatever the fuck you supposed to say.
Um,

855
00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:02.843
<v 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

856
00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:14.590
[inaudible].
