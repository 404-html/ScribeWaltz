00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:21.260
I got to pass this through because otherwise the wires are all crossed to,
oh,

7
00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:25.980
I got the wires crossed.
The wires are crossed.
We're sitting here.

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.060
Is that better?
Yup.

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.630
Me and the lovely Nia we have on the reason he is here is I hit,

11
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.220
Nian and I die.

12
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.170
Became to people that yes.
Had corned beef hash for breakfast.

13
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.100
Absolutely.

14
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.150
And we are so proud and we're so happy and we just want to thank everybody for

15
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:50.581
your support,

16
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:54.690
your support over the last few months and for your thoughts during this

17
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:58.250
difficult time maybe isn't here yet.
So I've been,

18
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.320
I become like a sitcom dead just fucking hanging out with the house by big

19
00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:09.580
fucking socks.
Bill's got big fuzzy socks on the thing.

20
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.270
That's right.
You got your colon.
Yeah.
Yeah,
because I get hot.
Yeah,

21
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.150
we have hardwood floors.

22
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.650
It knee is fucking walking around more pregnant than anybody I've ever got DMC.

23
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.190
So it's like she could be standing in Antartica being like,

24
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.240
can we put on the AC?
And I'm over here fucking chilly willy.

25
00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:30.670
So I got on my uh,
pregnant.

26
00:01:30.671 --> 00:01:33.550
I'm just like a human G.

27
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.330
Gettel I am short and stout were all baby.
You're all baby.
You look good to me.

28
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.320
Thank you.
Anyways,
uh,

29
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.220
so we're sitting out here on a rainy fucking Sunday.

30
00:01:43.221 --> 00:01:47.180
It's been raining cats and dogs out here.
And uh,
did they say rainy Sunday?

31
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.710
Did I say Sunday?
I don't know.
It feels like a Sunday.
It's a fucking Thursday.

32
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:56.510
Whatever.
Pouring outside.
And you know what pissed me off yesterday on the news,

33
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.570
some fucking idiot.
Like they announced out here in California,

34
00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:01.160
they said the drought is over.

35
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.230
Does because it rains well now because it rained so much that this flooding,

36
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.140
but like this shit's going to stop and then this,

37
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.460
this is going to have to last us for like four years.
Cause you know,

38
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:14.540
the next sheet like,

39
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.080
well how much does it have to rain for it to no longer be a drought?

40
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.160
That's my question.

41
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.590
Well I think just the mere fact that it's raining mean that there's no,
no,

42
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.660
no water levels in all the reservoir was,
I believe,

43
00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:28.140
I'm just would guess that this,

44
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.610
they have to get to a certain level because when I did my bus tour burning my

45
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:36.040
own hole in the fucking California ozone,
sure.
When,
uh,

46
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.620
we went by all these big reservoirs that were for,
uh,
you know,

47
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.800
drinking water or just even people just ride boats around or whatever.

48
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.700
Like you could see the waterline.
I mean it was like to like,
you know,

49
00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:47.780
a brown stone in New York,

50
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:51.380
picture like two or three of those stacked on top of each other that low and
the,

51
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.440
it looked like it was a half mile across and he was fucking ridiculous.
Yeah.

52
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.750
It was,
it was terrifying to be honest with you.

53
00:02:56.751 --> 00:02:59.650
So evidently it's gotten up to an acceptable level,

54
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:02.410
so now everyone's going to start taking fucking long showers.

55
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:05.050
You know what I mean?
Just,
you know what kills me out here?

56
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.010
Every time when it starts to fucking rain and you wash all,

57
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.330
you watch all that water going down the La River,

58
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.840
that goes all the way down to Marina del Rey,
I believe.

59
00:03:12.841 --> 00:03:14.560
And then it just goes out to the ocean.
It's like,

60
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:19.330
why don't you capture that somehow in save it all that runoff.

61
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.450
Yeah.
I mean,
I think environmentalists would like that to happen.

62
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.800
It's a very complicated class that

63
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.950
kids couldn't have books in schools anymore.

64
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.600
If we captured the raid one and we did that,
then we'd have to cut this.

65
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:39.550
And I dunno.
It sounds like,
it seems like it's complicated.

66
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:44.020
Maybe it's not.
I don't know.
Yeah,
you have.
You have no energy today.

67
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.380
Can you hear it in my voice?
You have like rainy day energy.

68
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.200
I have rainy day in pregnant as fuck energy,
rainy day in praying.

69
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.300
It brings me down.
Well,

70
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:59.470
why don't you just fucking have the kid just fucking,
you know.
Oh,
I wish I could.

71
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:03.390
I wish we could have it right now.
Yeah.
You know what?

72
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.140
You know what's funny is I've been like joking about this on stage is the level

73
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:10.090
that people have been trying to,
uh,

74
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.920
every day I get a text it will say,
did the kid come yet?
And I'll say no.

75
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.050
And then the followup Texas,
are you nervous?
It's like,
well I wasn't,

76
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.710
I was sitting here relaxed.
Like they just get you on edge and I'm just like,

77
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.560
it's been this great process where I'm just like,
wow man,

78
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:27.940
I always listened to people.

79
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:30.730
I need to stop doing that because it doesn't help you if they just,

80
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.640
I was joking on stage like they were getting your like,

81
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.120
you know when you get a dog all excited,
like you want to go inside,

82
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.390
how do you want to go outside?
Like that's what they're doing to you.

83
00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:45.391
Like he's a baby here and you're nervous and freaking out like three or four

84
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:50.080
texts a day for like the past three days.
It's like,
no,

85
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.920
baby's not here yet.
You sound like you drank some of that.
What's that?

86
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:56.260
What's that rank?
You sound like your lien.

87
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.110
Is that what the kids are doing nowadays with the fucking cough syrup and their

88
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:03.790
Irish spring that they take a cheese grater and they fucking hair spring.

89
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.030
That's one of my favorite things to dirty sprite.
That's what future calls it.

90
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.430
I like when you got all these,

91
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.960
these fucking people on the Internet and they show you how to make it,

92
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.540
cause I was sitting,
it was a comedian.
I got to know what's going on.
Oh,

93
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:15.640
did you look online to see how it's made?
Yeah,

94
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.440
it's literally sprite and like codene like prescription and they take like a

95
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.920
car.
Someone put a jolly rancher or some shit in there.

96
00:05:23.921 --> 00:05:27.460
But like if you just look at the ingredients on the back of the fucking thing.

97
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.810
Yeah,
yeah.
Like,
uh,
I got to hand it to this generation.
All these generations.

98
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:34.900
Every time you think like,
you know,
wow.
Like,

99
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.250
like I always say in my generation there was crack babies and I'm just like,

100
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:40.900
okay,
that's it.
That's the end.

101
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.290
That's as fucked up as you as you're going to see like human beings do things

102
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:48.070
like,
like as a parent,

103
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:50.680
I wouldn't be able to be shocked like you're doing what right.

104
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.840
Then came meth heads,
which literally looked like walking dead people.

105
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.820
They're not zombies,
but they're not real people anymore.

106
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.210
They have like fucking Nate.
Like when I would do gigs out in the Midwest,

107
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.320
you know,
ion in further west into those states,
you know,

108
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.030
celebrities go to buy a log cabin and buy a fucking pretend they own a grizzly

109
00:06:11.031 --> 00:06:12.020
bear outfit.
Right?

110
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.080
If you go out there and they had like this before and after pictures of people

111
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:18.950
on meth.
Yeah,
yeah.
And I was just like,
Holy Shit that,
that made,

112
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.730
that blew my fucking mind.
And now looking at these guys,

113
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.530
I mean I guess this isn't as bad as math,

114
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:29.030
but just watching beans will always find a way to get high though new creative

115
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:32.390
ways to get high.
That's just kinda how it goes or you think,

116
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.010
but I'm a sound like an old man here.
What,

117
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:37.370
what was wrong with what the fuck we did?
You can't just drink a couple of beers.

118
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.730
I mean what's that fucking drink that they're drinking?

119
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:43.580
That's like shit homeless people do or like,

120
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.480
like full on alcoholics and people will not fucking give you like money for

121
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:50.660
booze anymore and you just don't have it that that's what they used to do.

122
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:52.480
They go and they start drinking nyquil.
Yeah,

123
00:06:52.481 --> 00:06:56.990
cause the prescription and any of that stuff is really like,
I don't know,

124
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.660
I've never drank that kind of stuff before.

125
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.680
But it's supposed to mimic the feel of opioids.
Opioids,

126
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.740
opioids,
opiates.
You mean?
Oh No opioid it is the correct.

127
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.880
We've got some bump on your ass.
No,
that's a hemorrhoid.

128
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.610
I thought opiates.
So that's opiates.
Opiates.
Hemorrhoids is also a word.

129
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.463
It is,

130
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.550
I think is that when you take like the qtip laced with this shit and you put it

131
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:29.680
in your ass.
I don't know why you were,
what the ad?
No,

132
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.310
no.
There was a thing that these kids were doing.
There was soaking something.

133
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.640
I swear to God,
I swear to God,
I went down a rabbit hole.
How these kids get high.

134
00:07:38.641 --> 00:07:39.910
There was this fucking thing they were doing.

135
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.990
They were taking something acute dip or something and it was so good in this

136
00:07:42.991 --> 00:07:47.210
shit that got you high and then they'd stick it in their ass because there's a

137
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.370
thin membrane there.
Leave it.
Yeah.

138
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:54.050
Like how people blow coke up each others ass and stuff.
No.
Yeah.

139
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:57.140
That's the thing.
That is not a thing.
I know.
You know what?

140
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.710
I'll go with the fucking Q tip up the ass.
No,
it totally is a thing.

141
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.840
Hang on a sec.
That is not a fucking thing.

142
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.780
The old coke in the ass.
Yeah.
Just picture what that looks like.
What are you,

143
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.800
your cup it in your hand and then you can go spread it wider.

144
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.800
Wider and yeah,
no fucking way.

145
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:22.760
Probably use like a straw.
It's a funnel in the Enos.
Really.

146
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:27.560
And how well do you know this person?
I do.
We've been friends for a while.

You know I've seen you drink drinks,
you use a strives astrar right.

148
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.330
That's not really crazy.

So

149
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.370
I got this bag of coke.
Hear me out.
Just hear me out.
Just sit out.
Sit Out.

150
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.040
I'm not taking my pants off.
I was just adjusting my belt.
Let's see.
All right,

151
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.160

00:08:50.161 --> 00:08:55.100

Coke up.
Yes.
Up the bum

153
00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:01.260

I got cocaine blown up my ass.

154
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.760

What?
Oh,

Of course it is.
Okay.

157
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:16.230

Kang man blows cocaine up a woman's ass.
Yeah.

159
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.500
Was he to numb it before he stuck his fatty in the thing?

160
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:29.390
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

161
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.790
<v 0>Yeah.
So okay.
Wait as well.</v>

162
00:09:31.791 --> 00:09:35.000
You don't encyclopedia dramatica investigate it more.

163
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:39.670
Just know that it's a thing that exists.
All right,

164
00:09:39.671 --> 00:09:43.270
well then I gotta look mine up.
Well,
I got to read the article here.
All right.

165
00:09:43.271 --> 00:09:47.800
This is what you need.
Some sort of fucking kitchen knife.
Wait,
wait.

166
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:52.830
Let's not tell people how to do it.
I mean,
I can say,
okay,
this is a real Neil.

167
00:09:52.831 --> 00:09:56.350
When the Internet was suddenly a buzz with rumors that getting a friend to blow

168
00:09:56.351 --> 00:10:00.400
coke up your ass with the straw was worth the trouble I had to see if I'd been

169
00:10:00.401 --> 00:10:04.840
doing it all wrong.
After all,
blow doesn't come with instructions.

170
00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:10.090
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
Get to the fucking point.
All right.
I don't know.

171
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.690
There's not gonna be a video.
This is a,
okay.

172
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.860
Okay.
Uh,
I know it's funny.
I said hoping the conversation would cover it,

173
00:10:17.861 --> 00:10:20.480
but I just wanted to understand the possible health effects on a more

174
00:10:20.481 --> 00:10:21.800
fundamental level.
Okay.

175
00:10:21.801 --> 00:10:26.270
So he called somebody physician's viewpoint in a very nice woman named Kate

176
00:10:26.271 --> 00:10:30.620
spoke to me.
I asked her about it and she fell silent.
He said,
I know.
It's funny.

177
00:10:30.621 --> 00:10:34.250
I said,
I was hoping.
She says,
it's more sad actually.
He said,
Oh yeah,

178
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.440
that's the word I should have used.
Said overall.

179
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:41.220
Kate was extremely helpful and promised to contact all the gastro,
uh,
something,

180
00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:45.890
or I'll just still,
the Internet had spoken.
I had to try it.

181
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:50.300
That,
that,
that the de this guy.
Okay.
He's,
I'm going to go with the pictures now.

182
00:10:50.301 --> 00:10:52.310
He's got the spoon.
He sticks it in a vile.

183
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:55.910
All right?
In the end,

184
00:10:55.911 --> 00:10:59.630
my high was no more significant than when I opt for the more orthodox approach.

185
00:10:59.631 --> 00:11:02.840
All right,
so people are doing it because there was the other thing,

186
00:11:02.841 --> 00:11:05.660
the thing I was talking about,
rave,
let me look this up.

187
00:11:05.661 --> 00:11:08.540
Rave drugs.

188
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.160
<v 2>Yeah.
Ass Search.</v>

189
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.610
<v 0>Somebody's got their booty eating it and all in an American festival.</v>

190
00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:21.120
Strange happenings regarding Edm festivals,
raves and drugs.

191
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.870
<v 2>Okay.</v>

192
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.660
<v 0>Strange happenings regarding Edm festival raves and drugs them.
Dot.
Dot.</v>

193
00:11:26.661 --> 00:11:30.010
Thought them and going to eat their ass.
Not really.

194
00:11:30.011 --> 00:11:34.030
And not what people are thinking.
How to smuggle in gear to a concert.

195
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.290
Jesus Christ shaking her ass at a rave party.
Wicked woman.

196
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.400
I don't know why I get it right.
We can't move off this topic.

197
00:11:42.401 --> 00:11:45.400
This is getting weird.
Let me just get weird.
We're not doing it.

198
00:11:45.401 --> 00:11:48.750
We're just researching Townsend.
Hey,
the San Diego,

199
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:55.120
uh,
moving up to Los Angeles.
Oh,
is saw something online about that.
Yeah.

200
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.570
They finally,
they're returning home where they belong.

201
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.830
They were the Los Angeles chargers for one season.
The first year,
the AFL,

202
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.950
they're back where they started.

203
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.760
Here they come round again.
Hey,
wait it nia go.

204
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:14.550
It's almost like she's having a contraction
dude.

205
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.100
You got to ask yourself as a San Diego charger fan after all the fucking

206
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:19.000
heartache and everything,

207
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:22.750
he just went through and now they're going to fucking walk out on you.
You know,

208
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.180
you gotta be asking yourself like,
what,
what,
what,
what was that off?

209
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:29.970
What was that all for?
You know,
great.

210
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:35.070
I actually am back as much as they hated as much as they hated the fucking,

211
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.710
the Patriots and Tom Brady and I had a horrible fan experience when I went down

212
00:12:39.711 --> 00:12:42.280
there and were patriots tests not real and how much realizing how much they

213
00:12:42.281 --> 00:12:46.840
hated us.
Um,
I just don't know.
I just,

214
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.080
I actually felt bad for them as fans because it wasn't that they lost,

215
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.110
it's the way they lost.
They did the old Boston red sox thing.

216
00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:57.340
What we used to do before we started winning all the championships was we

217
00:12:57.341 --> 00:13:01.210
couldn't just have the decency to just suck like the cubs all those years.

218
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.540
You don't have,
the cubs just sucked.
They had like two errors too to Eric Games,

219
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.580
one of the early eighties and then they had the fucking one where they blame

220
00:13:07.581 --> 00:13:10.870
that,
that fucking a little nerd,
you know,

221
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.900
rather than the other six people that stood up around them also trying to catch

222
00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:16.810
the ball.
They had to,
to heartbreakers.
That was it.
Other than that,

223
00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:19.300
it was a big keg party.
Everybody standing there with their shirts off.

224
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.170
They all live in Wrigleyville.
They got money.
They're not sympathetic people,

225
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.970
you know what I mean?
Um,
but charge offense,
you know what I mean?

226
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.510
They just like a,
they had that fucking old ass God damn stadium.

227
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:34.060
They wrote it out.
They were down there.

228
00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:39.270
They came close in like 95 got their fucking asses kicked was at 95 and 94 when

229
00:13:40.751 --> 00:13:44.540
Steve Young got the monkey take it off his back.
Wasn't that what it was near?
Ah,

230
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.610
yeah.
Steve Young who claimed the Patriots should have all of their championships

231
00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:52.960
taken away because a spy gate,
one of the dumbest things I ever heard,
it's like,

232
00:13:52.961 --> 00:13:56.110
yeah,
that's Great Steve.
It's a brand new rule.
It was illegal for one game.

233
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.230
So when it wasn't illegal because we were doing it back then,

234
00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:02.860
then they should get charged for it when the rest of the league was also doing

235
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:06.970
it.
Alright,
whatever.
So welcome to La.
We went from no football teams to Tunia.

236
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:08.830
Now,
how does that make you feel?
Are you excited?

237
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.840
No.
Yes.
No.
Would say no.
I don't care.
I'm kind of um,

238
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:22.510
you know,
I need to tap out and different.
You're done now.
I'm okay.

239
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.030
You're okay.
You don't have to go your birthday.
You don't look like you're okay.

240
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.253
I can make it.

241
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.880
Ooh.
It's a good distraction.
All right,

242
00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:36.920
for sure.

243
00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.580
For all the guys out there and for the ladies who'd never been pregnant,

244
00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:41.680
what does that feel like at this point?

245
00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:43.330
If you guys are wondering why I'm so fucking relaxed,

246
00:14:43.331 --> 00:14:44.830
she's had so many of these goddamn things.

247
00:14:44.831 --> 00:14:49.510
It's like somebody crying wolf crying wolf.
Yeah.
Now these are,
you know,

248
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:51.290
you should do to freak me out when I'm there.

249
00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:55.730
Just throw a glass of water on the floor and just be like,
oh,
just watch me

250
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.990
<v 3>car.
Someone had suggested that I do that to you on Twitter,
but I don't,</v>

251
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.680
I'm not original.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Um,

252
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.780
yeah,
no.
These are called Braxton Hicks contractions.

253
00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:13.890
They are getting you ready for actual real contractions and I've been having

254
00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:15.650
them more and more frequently.

255
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:19.280
Just answered the question as I'm getting close answer what question?

256
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.050
Like what does it feel like?
Oh,

257
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.810
it feels like an extreme tightening in your abdomen.
No,

258
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.500
relate it to a pain you've had before.

259
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.490
Getting slugged in the shoulder and that's never happened to be having your big

260
00:15:31.491 --> 00:15:34.130
brother grabbed you by one of your ankles and drag it back down the stairs.

261
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.910
Never happened to me.
And this is the only way I can relate to,

262
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.960
it's like just in the ear.
It's like he,
it's like someone is in your stomach,

263
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.620
stretching it out as tight as it can go.

264
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.260
And then it slowly goes back to normal.

265
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.800
<v 0>Running into the living room cause you missed a big play looking at the TV and</v>

266
00:15:51.801 --> 00:15:55.610
running full speed into the coffee table.
Stomach first.
Sure.

267
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.370
The stomach first.
Okay,
there we go.
I did that.
Yes,

268
00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.950
I did that on Monday when I watched,

269
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.640
when I watched uh,
the Alabama Clemson game.

270
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.830
And I know Neil is once you don't like football.

271
00:16:09.831 --> 00:16:12.470
I know you heard me screaming when Clemson scored that last.

272
00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.010
<v 3>You were definitely screaming.</v>

273
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.370
<v 0>I would be the worst announcer ever.</v>

274
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.520
You don't like the great answers have to be like,
do you believe in miracles?
Yes.

275
00:16:23.521 --> 00:16:26.840
Or like he did it.
He did it.
Flutie did it.
They have like something,

276
00:16:26.841 --> 00:16:28.760
you know the shot heard round the world.

277
00:16:28.761 --> 00:16:32.000
What are the fuck it was the giants win the pennant.
The job I just went like,

278
00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.170
<v 3>yeah.
You weren't going crazy there.
Yeah,</v>

279
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.030
I saw it as like one of the crimson tide.

280
00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:46.010
<v 0>Oh me d d.
Um,</v>

281
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.220
I actually,
when I was watching that fucking that game I was uh,

282
00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.070
I was actually happy for either team winning cause my,
my,

283
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.970
my hatred of Alabama is completely phony.

284
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.720
I'm not from down south.
You know,

285
00:17:01.721 --> 00:17:04.810
I just picked Lsu because I thought that last miles was a gap,

286
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.690
though I thought he was crazy eating grass and shit,
you know,

287
00:17:07.691 --> 00:17:09.380
going forward on fucking field goals,

288
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:13.930
having the field goal kick of run down the fucking street and slippers scored

289
00:17:13.931 --> 00:17:16.510
touchdowns.
I was like,
Hey,
I'll fucking go with these guys.
You know?

290
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.690
So it just became fun to root against them.
But it was also,

291
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:22.020
I'm a big fan of history,
Nia.
And,
uh,

292
00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:26.200
he would have tied Paul Bear Bryant if he won another championship.

293
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.330
And I'm also,

294
00:17:28.331 --> 00:17:31.720
La head was saying that Alabama is overrated because yes,

295
00:17:31.721 --> 00:17:33.520
he see was weak and then out.

296
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.520
So then I was kind of rooting for Alabama to beat a team that just fucking beat

297
00:17:38.531 --> 00:17:42.910
the shit out of the Ohio state buckeyes 31 to nothing.
Um,

298
00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.740
I was kind of hoping for that.

299
00:17:44.741 --> 00:17:47.260
But then also you've got to get a root for Clemson.
They're the underdog,
right?

300
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:52.650
It's phenomenal.
This is how much of a Cleveland Guy,
okay.

301
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.050
Jason Law hit is what I love,
Jason.
Okay.

302
00:17:55.051 --> 00:18:00.051
But he has the disease of being a Cleveland Sports Fan when fucking,

303
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.830
uh,
Clemson went up because what happened was Clemson scored,

304
00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.130
it looked like they were going to win the game and an Alabama went right down

305
00:18:08.131 --> 00:18:10.500
the field and gave him the old right there,
Fred.

306
00:18:10.501 --> 00:18:14.490
And then Clemson came back when it looked like there was really no time left.

307
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.920
And then they scored and then they want,
right?

308
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.400
So when Clemson went up and it looked like Alabama wasn't gonna have enough time

309
00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:26.730
to score,
Jason texts me about their head coach saying,

310
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:30.750
he'll find a way to fuck this up.
And I just wrote back,
Jesus Christ,
Jason,

311
00:18:30.751 --> 00:18:32.880
can you just believe?
And then sure enough,

312
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.570
Alabama goes down and scores a touchdown.

313
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.380
And then Jason writes to me,
you Clemson,

314
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.990
you'll lose some almost trying to look like you win some,

315
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:44.430
you lose some or something like that.

316
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.930
And then Clemson goes down against all of his fucking negative vibes.

317
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:52.800
They go ahead,
they score the winning touchdown.
You know what he says to me?

318
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.240
He goes out of they should have won it last year.
Want to last year two,

319
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.830
they finally won a championship.
That's what he says.
Um,
I don't know.

320
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.440
Classic Cleveland Guy.
Anyways,
near uh,

321
00:19:04.441 --> 00:19:08.900
we're going to go see a double feature today,
Huh?
Yes.
You're taking me to a,

322
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.170
what am I going to go?
See?

323
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:16.490
<v 3>We're going to go see moon.
Are you having another one?
Yes.
All right.</v>

324
00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.390
It's the five one.
One rule.
So that's two within five minutes.
I know,

325
00:19:20.391 --> 00:19:24.320
but this isn't a real contraction.
This is just the way you never had a baby.

326
00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.460
Did you guys do at the end of this fucking thing?

327
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.180
I've always said he heard a baby crying.
What the fuck?

328
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.090
Because I know this is,
they say,
you know,

329
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:40.180
you know when the contraction is real and it's like you got to know when to hold

330
00:19:40.431 --> 00:19:44.750
them.
I don't think I'd be able to
hang out and hold a microphone.

331
00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.630
<v 0>The hair.
The kid.
Yeah.
No wind to podcast.
You nailed.</v>

332
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.990
But cow Joe babies sitting on.

333
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:57.130
So they'll be time for cotton when the Braxton Hicks is done.

334
00:19:58.410 --> 00:19:59.243
<v 3>Right,
exactly.</v>

335
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.460
We're going to go see moonlight and they weren't going to see hidden figures.

336
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.400
And this is all dependent.
I mean hopefully,
yes,

337
00:20:05.401 --> 00:20:08.100
I won't be moonlight and hidden figures.

338
00:20:08.101 --> 00:20:11.300
My water won't be breaking during any of these.
I was just,

339
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.940
is this make bill woke day

340
00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.540
<v 0>trimester guy?
So I got to just agree with everything that she fucking said.</v>

341
00:20:19.541 --> 00:20:20.560
So I got to go see that.

342
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.370
Then I got to go see hidden figures where you know they're going to do a total

343
00:20:24.371 --> 00:20:28.030
overcorrection of fucking history and they're gonna have a bunch of guys running

344
00:20:28.031 --> 00:20:28.864
around.
Like why wait?

345
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.830
<v 3>It's supposed to be a really good movie and I'm excited to see it.
I know.</v>

346
00:20:34.831 --> 00:20:39.300
And it's,
it's keyword based on a true story.
Carson,
isn't it?

347
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:44.660
Kevin fucking Cosla and my girl Jenelle Manya who I love so much.

348
00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:50.020
Remember when went to see her in concert?
We saw before she was famous,
famous,

349
00:20:50.021 --> 00:20:51.610
famous.
We saw when she was just famous,

350
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.420
she was jumping around on the saddle shoes and when she was opening for
somebody,

351
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.650
not all,
she closed.
No,
she opened for Jamie Lidell at the Avalon.

352
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:04.240
Don't you remember?
I had seen her in a magazine and I was like,
who is this?

353
00:21:04.241 --> 00:21:06.460
And I listened to some of her music and I'm like,
that's cool.

354
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.910
And then do do the week of our wedding,

355
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.140
she was playing at the House of Blues and I went to go see her a couple of days

356
00:21:14.141 --> 00:21:17.650
before our wedding and it was awesome.
And what was my maid of honor?

357
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.650
They took a picture together and we ended up hanging out with her.

358
00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:21.730
And what did you man

359
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.920
<v 0>afterwards?
What?
What did you have to eat afterwards?
What?
What are you saying?</v>

360
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.220
You just getting to into a lot of detail here.
Oh well excuse me.

361
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:35.130
Sorry.
I got cabin fever.
Nia.
I said yesterday,
man,
we watch it.
We watched,

362
00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.790
I sat in the fucking laid in bed with you.
Yes.

363
00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.790
And we watched all those fucking game shows.
Yeah.

364
00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.930
We watch jeopardy.
Wait for,
for one.
Oh first we watched the news.

365
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.970
We've turned into a real old couple.

366
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:53.080
We watched the news and then we went on to Trump yelling at that guy and CNN

367
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.480
fake news.
Fake News.
I won't answer that.
Let her talk.
Don't be rude.

368
00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.900
Don't be rude.
Jeopardy.
And then we watched a wheel of fortune.

369
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.140
Wheel of fortune got boring.
They got rid of all their fucking,

370
00:22:09.141 --> 00:22:13.490
they used to have the worst fucking prize as you had to pick from right in the

371
00:22:13.491 --> 00:22:16.910
end,
they'd be,
it was always like for a $600,
I'll uh,

372
00:22:16.911 --> 00:22:21.260
I'll take the brass bed frame.
Uh,
for five 60,

373
00:22:21.261 --> 00:22:24.830
I'll take the grandfather clock.
I saw like old people shit.

374
00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:30.500
300 bucks.
I'll take the estate jewelry.
Oh my God,
Dad,
father clocks.
I'll take,

375
00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.180
put the rest on a gift certificate.

376
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.610
How many people went bankrupt?
Every other fucking spin.
Yeah,

377
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.710
that nerdy black kid.
Every time you would get ahead,
Calvin,
every time.
Calvin,

378
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:50.170
we'll get ahead
and he didn't win in the end.
I was so sad.

379
00:22:50.171 --> 00:22:52.750
I mean he won,
but then he didn't get the final puzzle.

380
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:58.250
I think all the Calvins world,
we're winners that day.
All right,
patch.

381
00:22:58.251 --> 00:23:02.630
Say Jack is 70 years old.
Alex Tra Beck is 76.

382
00:23:02.631 --> 00:23:05.360
Alex Trebeck is under contract for another two years.
This is,

383
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.120
this is why my fucking add reacts when I watch the game show.

384
00:23:08.121 --> 00:23:11.750
Cause after a while I can't watch those people excitedly yelling out letters.

385
00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.970
Say the lacy,
you'll see there is two C's.

386
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.810
You want to solve a puzzle or could they do spinning?

387
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:20.860
I'm going to get 10 new Spain,

388
00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:26.493
three 50

389
00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.690
is there an l?
Ooh,
I'm sorry.

390
00:23:32.691 --> 00:23:35.300
There's no l Calvin spin the wheel

391
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:47.000
fucking drove me insane and I can't even,
I never know what it says.

392
00:23:47.001 --> 00:23:50.130
You can have everything but the vowels of still go cat

393
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.210
kitchen titty.
I can never understand.
I never know what the fuck it is.

394
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.890
You're really good in sports.
Jeopardy.
We watch some sports jeopardy this week.

395
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.890
We've been watching a lot of game shows.
That's true.
Oh my God.

396
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.670
Was Killing at sports jeopardy.
The shit that doesn't matter in life.

397
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:09.230
I know everything about

398
00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.310
speaking of which,
how about those Celtics?
Huh?

399
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.690
Sally had a tough one against the fucking raptors of the huskies.

400
00:24:19.691 --> 00:24:20.650
Whatever the fuck they were doing.

401
00:24:20.651 --> 00:24:24.760
Everybody's doing their throwback fucking jerseys.
Um,
Jesus Christ.

402
00:24:24.761 --> 00:24:28.150
I don't know one person's name on the Toronto Raptors,

403
00:24:28.151 --> 00:24:32.160
but I do know DeRozen now.
Holy Shit.
That guy just,
he hit her.

404
00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:36.230
I thought he kept saying the Rosa and of course I just kept thinking of Joe,
Joe,

405
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.390
Joe Rosa of this kind of thing.
He showed her rosa killed him.

406
00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:43.140
He killed us on the raptors.
There's the Photoshop right there.

407
00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.130
I want to see Jodie Rosa.
We,

408
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.710
if you can find a fucking picture of him where he kind of looks confident,

409
00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.070
you know Joey put up,

410
00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.790
put them in with that Toronto huskies fucking throwback,

411
00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.270
that guy to rose and killed this man.
Finally,

412
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.220
when he scored like his 41st point,

413
00:25:03.221 --> 00:25:06.310
I think he turned around and looked at our bench or at the crowd and it was,

414
00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.460
I didn't even make me upset.
It's just like,
yeah,
dude,
the,
you couldn't,

415
00:25:09.461 --> 00:25:12.640
you couldn't cover the guy.
We had a,
we fucking had them.

416
00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.750
Toronto was exactly what we thought they were,

417
00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:22.590
but that's a,
that's that's,
you know,
that's where we're at.
We,

418
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.131
we fight,

419
00:25:23.131 --> 00:25:26.520
we fucking beat everybody else except for the people we're going to run into in

420
00:25:26.521 --> 00:25:28.320
the late rounds of the playoffs.
So,
uh,

421
00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:33.360
it's looking like the Celtics win around or maybe too,
who knows?
Depending on,
uh,

422
00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.690
but you know,
that was to become the second seat in the east,

423
00:25:36.691 --> 00:25:40.310
which would have been sweet,
right?
Because this number two place 70,

424
00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:45.020
you know this,
did you just fall asleep?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

425
00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:49.430
I feel you want to listen to me read out loud.
Bruins got the prejudice.

426
00:25:49.431 --> 00:25:53.330
We beat the blues the other day.
Put me to sleep.
You know what?

427
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:58.260
What about when I'm watching your fucking you stupid reality shows it.
Huh?

428
00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:02.250
I actually enjoy them.
Right?
I'm not fucking angry anymore,
Nia.
I try.

429
00:26:02.251 --> 00:26:05.170
I'm trying to keep the anger going.
I don't have it anymore.
Walking,

430
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:08.040
meditating everyday.
You know what's funny though is me being less angry.

431
00:26:08.041 --> 00:26:10.920
It's like freaking you out.
It's not freaking me out.

432
00:26:10.921 --> 00:26:13.590
I literally gave you prompts all yesterday when we,

433
00:26:13.591 --> 00:26:18.570
after the doctor's appointment and we sat there and we had a nice brunch and I

434
00:26:18.571 --> 00:26:19.650
told you how proud of

435
00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:28.780
and used to it used to unnerve me a little bit when you were calm because I just

436
00:26:30.301 --> 00:26:33.300
thought nothing was wrong with you.
Okay,
look,
I was plotting,

437
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.720
doing something to you.
Oh my God.
Our old friends here,

438
00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:44.370
Indo Chino Indochino is one of the largest to measure men's wear brands and

439
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:51.570
nothing says I'm happy in my relationship.
Like getting some men's wear.

440
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:55.710
Get a high quality suit made to your exact measurements.
That's the fucking Shit,

441
00:26:55.711 --> 00:26:58.230
man.
When he got a job where you got to wear a suit,
you come home like who?

442
00:26:58.231 --> 00:27:00.090
Beaumont.
The beginning of the,
leave it to beaver.

443
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.660
Bespoke means for a perfect fit.
Uh,

444
00:27:03.661 --> 00:27:06.480
what's a spoke bespoke?
What does bespoke,

445
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:10.410
isn't that a suit that's made just for you?

446
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:15.030
Like all of Conor Mcgregor's suits all that guys get some nice suits.

447
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:16.021
Hey Dell.

448
00:27:16.021 --> 00:27:18.720
I'll tell you that guy at the only thing nicer than the way knock she had is the

449
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:21.960
focus suits he wears.
All right.
You will dress like Conor Mcgregor one day.

450
00:27:21.961 --> 00:27:23.490
I'm going to make it happen.
Yeah,

451
00:27:23.491 --> 00:27:25.740
and then you'll see exactly how many pounds I need to lose.

452
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:30.060
The thing about Conor McGregor is he's in fucking fucking championship shape.

453
00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:35.490
Okay?
I'm in pull,
Lucas shape,
sweatpants and a hoodie.
All right?

454
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.700
You get to,
you get to customize your suit just the way you want it.

455
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.420
Here's how it works.
Visit a show room,
our shop

456

Choose your custom customization from lapels to pleats to jacket linings and

459
00:27:50.691 --> 00:27:51.530
moral.
That's pretty cool.

460
00:27:51.531 --> 00:27:54.080
You can make a fucking really loud suit or something classy.

461
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:58.010
Submit your body measurements,
place you all.
Don't do that.

462
00:27:58.011 --> 00:28:01.100
Don't submit your fucking measurements over the over the Internet.

463
00:28:01.101 --> 00:28:01.940
Don't ever do it.

464
00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.480
Do you think online banking spad you submit your body measurements over the

465
00:28:05.481 --> 00:28:06.140
Internet.

466
00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:10.160
The fucking Illuminati starts making a robot to your exact specifications and

467
00:28:10.161 --> 00:28:13.580
all of a sudden you know everybody notices that you're acting weird.

468
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:15.560
You know you're kind of you,
but you're not you.

469
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:19.190
That's because the robot showed up one day and you were like,
hey me,

470
00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.350
what are you doing here?

blue apron.
You know,
not all ingredients are created equal.
No.

487
00:29:19.431 --> 00:29:20.510
Jesus who wrote this?

488
00:29:20.511 --> 00:29:24.120
That fucking guy Trump just appointed to a attorney general.

489
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:29.850
<v 5>You know,
not all ingredients are created equal.
Some of them,</v>

491
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:39.610
Oh they,

maybe they can't ban.

492
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.410
Okay,

Do with Oh,
set shot the jump shot.
All right.</v>

494
00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:51.670
Fresh high quality ingredients make a real difference.
So important to know.

495
00:29:51.671 --> 00:29:53.200
So it's important to know where your food comes from.

496
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.190
Talking about your personal experience with Blue Apron.
Oh Jesus.
You know,

497
00:29:57.191 --> 00:29:59.920
I always wore white aprons and I put on a blue one and you know,

498
00:29:59.921 --> 00:30:04.120
I felt I felt a little cooler affordable for less than $10 per person.
Per meal.

499
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:07.990

I have to tell you this guys,

501
00:30:09.851 --> 00:30:11.950

502
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.860

especially become old like me,

503
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.490
is what the fuck you put into your body.
So one of the big pains in the ass,

504
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.410
it's going to the Goddamn grocery store.

505
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.530
Wouldn't it be wonderful if somebody just brought the shit to your fucking door

506
00:30:23.531 --> 00:30:26.150
all measured out and you can just throw it together after you work out?

507
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.640
Wouldn't that be fucking perfect?
Wash the pounds,
go away.
Suddenly,
you know,

508
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:33.730

519
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:17.860
L Y,
F,
T.
Lifed.
You know about Lyft,
right?

520
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.310
This is like when you're in eighth grade,
somebody brings up something,
you know,

521
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:24.490
something about sex.
You know what that means,
right?
You're like,
yeah.

522
00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.890
What does it mean?
Um,

523
00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:32.260
it's the APP that gets you a ride in minutes on demand 24,

524
00:31:32.261 --> 00:31:35.050
seven for less than the cost of a cap.

525
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:39.970
Please include all of the following points during your read.
Of course,
I will.
Um,

526
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:44.050
oh,
you're back.
I'm back.
I was worried you went and just had a baby.

527
00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:48.490
Needs a bath if you tried Lyft,
you know what I mean?
With Lyft,

528
00:31:48.491 --> 00:31:52.930
you just download the APP requested driver and they show up in three and a half

529
00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:57.580
minutes on average
fucking sweat and all coked up.

530
00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.750
That's really fast.
Every driver delivers.
Every,

531
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.860
every Lyft driver is fully vetted through their 10 point safety standard.
Yeah.

532
00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.240
Unlike those other cunts,

533
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:11.590
once you got ahead and fucking hands and a foot to step on the gas pedal,

534
00:32:11.591 --> 00:32:15.430
you've got a job over there including criminal and DMV background checks.

535
00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.210
You know,

536
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:20.170
you'll get around quickly and safety lift drivers are rated after every ride.

537
00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:21.700
So only the best stick around.

538
00:32:21.701 --> 00:32:25.420
You don't have to worry about getting into a filthy car with some creepy dude

539
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.710
like they do over there.
Um,
I can't say the name of them,

540
00:32:29.711 --> 00:32:34.600
but it rhymes with boober.
Justin boober girl,

541
00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:39.890
you know,
you're the one for me.
Whoa.
That's boy band shit right there.
With Lyft,

542
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.940
you can tip in the APP,
which obviously leads to happier drivers.

543
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:46.700
Nine out of 10 Lyft riders get a perfect five star rating.

544
00:32:46.701 --> 00:32:50.420
That's because most people are too mean to give a tent and like risk like rex

545
00:32:50.421 --> 00:32:55.190
reed right now are too mean to not give a tip.
Sorry.

546
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:58.220
Some sort of Gong show shit just fell into my head.
Bigger isn't always better.

547
00:32:58.221 --> 00:33:00.440
People lift isn't the biggest ride sharing app,

548
00:33:00.441 --> 00:33:02.750
but it's the fastest growing in the highest rated one.

549
00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.720
I'm talking quality over quantity.
Thanks to lift.

550
00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.090
You got an easy way to avoid drunk driving.

551
00:33:08.091 --> 00:33:11.780
You never have to bum a ride and you never have to worry about parking is so

552
00:33:11.781 --> 00:33:13.910
perfect for fucking la.
I'll tell you that right now.

553
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.960
A lot of people are actually getting ry,
getting rid of their drivers,

554
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:21.470
the cars and and uh,
relying on Lyft to get around.
This is a brutal read.
Sorry.

555
00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:25.380
And you know what?
I don't blame him.
Well,

556
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:29.360
how the fuck do you know or light blame?
I doubt it's a nice guests lift.

557
00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:33.020
All right.
Right now,
Lyft is offering our listeners a special deal.

558
00:33:33.021 --> 00:33:35.780

00:33:35.781 --> 00:33:39.650
That's up to $30 value when you enter a promo code or just download the free

560
00:33:39.651 --> 00:33:41.750
Lyft app today and went,
wait,
that's confusing.

561
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:46.370
Lyft is offering our listeners a specialty to get three free rides up to $10

562
00:33:46.371 --> 00:33:50.540
each aisle.
So they take you around the block.
We all right,

563
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:55.430
we want to go to the store that's gonna cost you money.
All right?
Uh,
where am I?

564
00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.530
Promo Code Burr Bill Burr,

565
00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.190
enter Promo Code Bill Barr at their website.

566
00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.920
Whatever the fuck it was that I said and I was that,
was that a good read?

567
00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.280
How come they don't have,
they don't have their website in their,

568
00:34:07.281 --> 00:34:10.670
do they do you know I had an idea the other day.
Nia,

569
00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:13.200
can you believe that I had an idea.
You,

570
00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:16.430
you um,

571
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.200
I want to buy like a 1948

572
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:27.090
like Cadillac limousine.
Okay.
I have the,

573
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:30.440
just whenever they fucking have the interior looked nice,
however,

574
00:34:30.441 --> 00:34:33.480
the outside of the car,
whatever.
Okay.
Then you get the powertrain,

575
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.650
the Sh air shocks all and shit.
Gas Monkey,
the whole fucking thing up.
Right.

576
00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:40.670
And then I get a fucking,
I get a driver,
right?

577
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:44.240
So I never have to deal with la traffic again.
I just jumped in the back.

578
00:34:44.241 --> 00:34:47.900
I got a little fucking bar,
I've got a little humor,
doors,
some cigars,

579
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:51.350
and then I got a little Wifi so I can get hammered.

580
00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:54.230
Smokers cigar to some business calls.

581
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:57.530
And then anytime there's ran around the city all day,
no,

582
00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:59.600
anytime I want to go out,
you cause out here.

583
00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:01.760
The big thing with La is there's no place to park.

584
00:35:01.761 --> 00:35:05.420
Like you'll pull into a strip mall that has like 10 fucking businesses and they

585
00:35:05.421 --> 00:35:10.280
have like 15 parking spots.
Right.
And they tell the employees not to park there,

586
00:35:10.281 --> 00:35:12.620
but you know they're going to park there and there's never any place to park.

587
00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:16.640
Sure.
If this guy just pulled up whap way parkway it and I just got out,

588
00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:21.980
then he fucking drove away.
How much things would cost to have to have a driver?

589
00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.640
Does the driver Hong Kong have a fucking driver?

590
00:35:25.641 --> 00:35:29.660
Like I mean just sits down the street like a creek.

591
00:35:29.661 --> 00:35:34.540
Read the fucking newspaper.
I think there's a lot of holes in this fucking thing.

592
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.830
A few hundred bucks a day for sure.
Bullshit.

593
00:35:37.831 --> 00:35:40.590
Nobody's going to sit here for fucking 24 hours for 200 bucks.
Yeah,

594
00:35:40.591 --> 00:35:43.690
they would call her ass.
The other word,

595
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.940
you can definitely hire a private driver that's just on call for you.
You say,

596
00:35:47.941 --> 00:35:50.970
Hey,
can you get here at 10 or whatever.
I got to go here,

597
00:35:50.971 --> 00:35:53.160
here and here and just hang out until I need you again.

598
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.820
If you pay somebody enough,
they'll do it.
Why wouldn't I?
You know what?

599
00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:57.900
As I liked driving too much,

600
00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:01.110
but there's those times like whenever you go into a fucking game and all that,

601
00:36:01.111 --> 00:36:05.370
I'm basically describing having my own lift,
you know?
Yeah.

602
00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.460
Cause I don't like it cause now it's just one person who knows where I live.

603
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:09.420
Whereas those other people,

604
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.480
they know where everybody knows where you fucking live and then they fucking

605
00:36:12.481 --> 00:36:14.910
track you.
Yeah.
It's like we just did Uber.

606
00:36:14.911 --> 00:36:19.911
Does Uber know those guys do that all the fucking time?

607
00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.970
They start tracking it.
Then they listened.
They hack into your phone.

608
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:23.820
They start listening to you.

609
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:29.270
You can corned beef hash looking at your raved drugs ass search.

610
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.070
Yeah.
Watching somebody take a straw,

611
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.980
blow cocaine up your ass as you're going like,
hey,
you know,

612
00:36:34.981 --> 00:36:38.370
I don't feel any higher than us.
I guess it was really no reason to do that.

613
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.520
Let's just do it.
There are nasal passages like we did before.

614
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:44.850
That's like something jackass.

615
00:36:44.851 --> 00:36:47.790
What had done back in the day and they would all be laughing the fucking asses

616
00:36:47.791 --> 00:36:49.950
off.
That was the part of the movies I could never share.
They've done it.

617
00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:53.310
I could never like those parts of the movie where there was,

618
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.430
there was always those parts where they would just do something like a pubic

619
00:36:56.431 --> 00:36:59.610
hair sandwich or put that little toy car up his ass.

620
00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:03.000
You think Steve own never had coke blown up his ass.
I mean,

621
00:37:03.001 --> 00:37:06.210
I'm sure if that was this thing for like two weeks now.

622
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.510
I don't think he did that.
He's a very conventional person.
Okay.
Man,

623
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:13.220
when he steps away from the camera,
he's very conservative.
Right?

624
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.990
I've done stand up with them a couple of times.
He fucking great guy.

625
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:19.830
He said that.
He said he's like a really nice person.
Yeah.
With an,

626
00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:24.750
with an incredible fucking like sense of humor,
right.
Really,
really funny.

627
00:37:24.751 --> 00:37:29.430
Fucking guy.
Um,
all right,
legal zoom.
This is the last one.
Everybody.
Legal Zoom.

628
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:34.080
Start of a new year's perfect opportunity to hit the reset button for a fresh

629
00:37:34.081 --> 00:37:37.200
start to finally get around to things you've been putting off for too long and

630
00:37:37.201 --> 00:37:39.300
legal zoom.com is where you make it happen.

631
00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:42.510

633
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.220
Don't let legal questions hold you back.
Sorry.

634
00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:49.470
It just seems like it's always such dry coffee with these people.

635
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.790
It seems you don't even let that black dude who does the,
uh,
was it all state?

636
00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.350
Dennis Haysburt.
Yeah.
Dennis Haysburt.
Are you in good hands?
He's Jewish.

637
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:02.850
I didn't know that.
They see was he,
is He Sammy Davis Jr son?

638
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.710
Cause I know he converted.
His last name is Haysburt.

639
00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:11.920
Oh he said he's Berg and Hayes boy.
No.

640
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:16.560
All right.
The legal world can be challenging to navigate.

641
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:19.920
That's why legal zoom was created over 15 years ago.

642
00:38:19.921 --> 00:38:22.530

643
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:26.400
the confidence you already have and the know how to wrap up your legal needs.

644
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.200
And since legal zoom isn't a law firm,

645
00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:30.980
you know I have to worry about expensive hourly fees.
Instead,

646
00:38:30.981 --> 00:38:33.240
you can get legal advice at flat rates from the network,

647
00:38:33.241 --> 00:38:35.890

649
00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:42.910
running your business.

There you go.

652
00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:53.861
All right,
let's end.

653
00:38:53.861 --> 00:38:58.861
And let's talk about a Meryl Streep's Golden Globe speech.

654
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:02.320
What did you think about that and IA?
Did you think it was historically accurate?

655
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.660
Was it something that data debate sad?

656
00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:11.080
There was something that I wasn't surprised that she said
she's been a,

657
00:39:11.081 --> 00:39:13.750
you know this,
she does this.

658
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.660
I wasn't mad in it and in,

659
00:39:16.661 --> 00:39:20.500
I mean the only thing I took offense to,
I wasn't mad.

660
00:39:20.501 --> 00:39:23.620
Aside from the usual thing of like,
oh good.

661
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:26.890
Someone who pretends to be somebody else going to tell us how the world needs to

662
00:39:26.891 --> 00:39:30.230
be run.
All right.
You thought it was a little,
what's word fame?

663
00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:34.180
What's your new word that you learned?
Oh,
sanctimonious.

664
00:39:34.181 --> 00:39:35.920
He thought it was a little thing to ammonious.

665
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.210
I really don't know what that means.
Cool.

666
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.510
Little holier than now.
I just did.
Oh,

667
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:47.470
those are always just cringe worthy moments when everyone from a Margaret Moore

668
00:39:47.471 --> 00:39:49.720
who,
whatever his fucking name is,
Michael Moore,

669
00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:53.790
Margaret and Meryl Streep and all these people are got to be like,

670
00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.650
<v 5>guys,
you know,
we're living in a really dangerous time right now.</v>

671
00:39:57.651 --> 00:40:01.970
I just really think it's really important for us all to hold each other and your

672
00:40:01.971 --> 00:40:04.970
loved ones a little bit closer.
Just that it's filler.

673
00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:10.770
<v 0>It's fucking filler.
It's just filler.
I just don't,
I,
I don't,</v>

674
00:40:10.771 --> 00:40:14.700
I don't fucking buy it.
And then in the end you fucking attack bread and circus,

675
00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:17.240
you know,
football and MMA.
Yeah.

676
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:21.150
Like we're all a bunch of movies and I like MMA.
How come?

677
00:40:21.151 --> 00:40:22.290
They have to be separate?

678
00:40:22.291 --> 00:40:27.291
But the majority of her message I thought mean was feeling yourself is an art

679
00:40:28.531 --> 00:40:31.930
form.
Defending yourself as an art form from Dominica.

680
00:40:31.931 --> 00:40:36.900
Doing martial arts always picked the Oregon could do.
Um,

681
00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:40.110
yeah.
Well like I said,
this is,
this is,
you know,

682
00:40:40.111 --> 00:40:42.480
Merrill and are there actors like her,

683
00:40:42.481 --> 00:40:45.850
they'd have a platform and they feel passionate about it and so they speak on
it.

684
00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:47.910
You give me one instance,
anything wrong with that?

685
00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:51.000
Give me one fucking cause and I'll give you the speech right now off the top of

686
00:40:51.001 --> 00:40:55.680
my head with every fucking cliche and I would be called brave if anybody gave a

687
00:40:55.681 --> 00:41:00.330
fuck about me.
God,
give me a topic.
Well,
what are you care about?
No,

688
00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.610
that's not the point.
The point is giving me something.

689
00:41:02.611 --> 00:41:05.250
I don't even know anything about it.
I could still give the speech.
Oh,

690
00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.910
I'm saving the whales.
You know,

691
00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.240
when you look at the earth from space,

692
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:16.020
which so few of us get the chance to do like I did in this movie when I

693
00:41:16.021 --> 00:41:20.460
pretended to be an astronaut,
most of it is water.

694
00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.790
And the biggest thing in the water are whales

695
00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.950
<v 5>and like us,
they also communicate.</v>

696
00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:32.000
And just because we don't understand that,
let me finish.

697
00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:37.330
Just because don't understand them does not mean that they are not saying

698
00:41:38.091 --> 00:41:43.091
something and they do not deserve a voice that needs to be heard.

699
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:48.740
<v 0>And despite the current administration,</v>

700
00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:54.970
<v 5>I,
Bobby,
continue fighting for these whales.</v>

701
00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:00.330
<v 0>Thank you.
Sorry,
I kind of petered out,
but you don't want to be,</v>

702
00:42:00.331 --> 00:42:04.420
I still fucking did it.
I still did it.
And then maybe the next day be like,

703
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:08.300
it was so brave.
I loved his Cumberbun.
You know,

704
00:42:08.301 --> 00:42:12.830
he was glowing.
He thanked his wife,
be thanked the whales,

705
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:16.600
he took his shiny thing and then he fucking,
you know,
I dunno.

706
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:21.640
Took a fucking stretch SUV burning low lead fucking gas into the fucking sunset,

707
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:28.040
right?
Yeah.
I just don't,
I,
I don't,
I don't give a flying fuck.

708
00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:32.870
I don't need a fucking lecture from an actor on what's going on.

709
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:34.400
I didn't feel like a lecture.

710
00:42:34.401 --> 00:42:37.400
It just felt like she was passionately talking about something that she felt

711
00:42:37.401 --> 00:42:39.530
strongly.
And you know what if Hillary Clinton got in,

712
00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:43.190
who fucking blew the bankers in 2008 do you think she would have given a speech

713
00:42:43.191 --> 00:42:46.670
about that?
No.
How many people that they've crushed?

714
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:50.110
How many people are upside down in a fucking house right now?
No.
Yeah,

715
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:52.070
I wouldn't have given speech.
Of course she wouldn't have.
Why?

716
00:42:52.071 --> 00:42:55.880
Because she wears a blue bra and fucking Trump was fucking red underwear.

717
00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:00.230
It's fucking stupid.
It's like listening to the Yankees and red sox fans.

718
00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:04.070
I don't know.
I'll be on it,
but this has been this podcast

719
00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:09.140
<v 5>and I want you guys to know,
I don't feel that I'm any different than you.</v>

720
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:13.830
<v 0>I'm walking around right now.
I'm not special.
Okay?</v>

721
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:21.190
I'm just a person that decided to listen to themselves and I feel that that's

722
00:43:21.321 --> 00:43:25.190
what everybody needs to do and that's not what we're teaching in the educational

723
00:43:25.191 --> 00:43:26.024
system.

724
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:29.810
Do you not have something that you feel strongly about that you wouldn't maybe

725
00:43:29.811 --> 00:43:31.880
use your platform to discuss?

726
00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.000
It's a bunch of Shit I feel strongly about,

727
00:43:36.001 --> 00:43:40.140
but I don't feel like I'm the fucking be all end all and my point,
in my opinion,

728
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:45.150
I'll end up,
but you have and podcasts that you do twice a flake gate,

729
00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:47.430
the flight gate,
I still fucking passionate about that.

730
00:43:47.431 --> 00:43:52.431
So you have two times a week where you have a guaranteed audience of thousands

731
00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:54.890
upon thousands of people listening to you.
Something here,

732
00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.110
I started going Meryl Streep,
Finish Times a fucking week.

733
00:43:58.111 --> 00:44:00.150
I would have no podcasts.
Oh,
I would be podcasting,

734
00:44:00.151 --> 00:44:04.650
but no one would be listening to me finish.
You're being rude.
You're being rude.

735
00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:06.900
No fake news.

736
00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.950
And you had a chance to talk about like here,

737
00:44:10.951 --> 00:44:12.840
this is the thing that I really feel strongly about.

738
00:44:12.841 --> 00:44:16.200
I feel like people should know.
I want to share.
You don't.

739
00:44:16.201 --> 00:44:20.890
You don't think that you should do that?
No.

740
00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:26.380
Oh,
okay.
Well,
there you go.
How dumb are people?
They don't know what's important.

741
00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:29.650
People know it's important.
People are not dumb.
I've traveled around people.

742
00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:33.390
I don't walk around people like,
Oh my God,
Bill,
talk slower.

743
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.940
I can't get my head around your phone.
Not that.

744
00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:38.610
It's not about like patronizing people.
It's like,
Hey,

745
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:41.730
here's this thing that came up recently.
This is how I feel about it.

746
00:44:41.731 --> 00:44:45.320
I feel strongly about it and here's why.
Maybe you feel this way too.

747
00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:47.010
Maybe you didn't know about this issue.

748
00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.300
Maybe this will maybe help you open up a little bit more about it.
Hey,

749
00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:53.010
that's a great delivery.
Somebody ought to try that sometime.

750
00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:57.600
Are you making fun of me?
No.
Meryl Streep was not delivering it that way,

751
00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:02.490
right?
Well,
he was wagging her fucking finger.
She wasn't wagging.

752
00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:06.180
She was getting a lifetime achievement award and she got up there degree.

753
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:14.710
What were you in?
Were you in this year?
Nothing.
I like,

754
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:18.540
why is she going to live?
They've given her every fucking trophy out there.

755
00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:22.780
They're going to give her another one.
Yeah,
she's Meryl Streep.
Listen,

756
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:27.040
she gets all the awards.
Okay.
Okay.
Let me,

757
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:31.170
I'm not saying she shouldn't get the fucking awards,
but why can't you?

758
00:45:31.171 --> 00:45:34.260
But why does it bother you so much that she gets up there and she talks about

759
00:45:34.261 --> 00:45:36.330
what she's passionate about it,
it doesn't bother me so much.

760
00:45:36.331 --> 00:45:39.960
I'm just choosing to make fun of it.
Oh that's all.
Okay.

761
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.800
I find it just cringeworthy when I don't fucking want to listen to,
uh,

762
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:48.660
you know,
George Kennedy talked to me about the fucking ozone layer,
you know,

763
00:45:48.661 --> 00:45:51.330
he just passed away.
You know what I mean?
Charles Bronson copy.

764
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:55.410
Well the thing is you're not big on award shows period.
I think they're silly.

765
00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:58.080
Right.
And then the speed,
I understand why you have to do it.

766
00:45:58.081 --> 00:46:02.130
I think a lot of people that go to them go to them because you have to,

767
00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:07.270
right.
Cause you have to,
cause what it is is you go in there like,
uh,
you know,

768
00:46:07.271 --> 00:46:08.920
you've got to support the project that you're in.

769
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:13.070
If is the family gets fucking nominated for something,
I would go yeah,

770
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.410
when I go up there and they fucking stand up there on a deck of day.

771
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:20.280
Medalia but I mean you've got to do it.
Yeah.
You have to do it cause that's,

772
00:46:20.281 --> 00:46:24.050
that's part of the thing that you signed up for.
It's good.
You know,
if,

773
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:27.480
if it wins Shit,
the writing staff,

774
00:46:27.481 --> 00:46:30.030
they make more money because then they get to be like,
oh wait,
you know,

775
00:46:30.031 --> 00:46:33.120
I wrote her an Emmy Award winning show or the fucking I an SB,

776
00:46:33.121 --> 00:46:37.110
whatever the fuck he get.
Right.
You have to play the fucking gay.
Yes.

777
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:41.740
So just go up there.
It say thank you.
I appreciate it.

778
00:46:41.741 --> 00:46:44.910
Take you shiny thing and take a fucking walk like this.

779
00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:48.330
The thing I don't like Trump.
Okay.

780
00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.480
I don't like the fucking shit he's doing.
I don't like the people he's picked it,

781
00:46:51.481 --> 00:46:55.590
but I don't need Meryl Streep.
Like I once I sit there like,
oh wait a minute.

782
00:46:55.591 --> 00:46:58.590
He's not a book guy.
Like,
oh thank you Meryl Streep.

783
00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:04.040
Thank you for squeegeeing my fucking third eye.
I know,

784
00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.740
I think it's say,
uh,

785
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:09.060
I think it's one of those things where you're famous too fucking long and you

786
00:47:09.061 --> 00:47:12.360
just start thinking that like everything that you're doing is a little more

787
00:47:12.361 --> 00:47:15.670
important that it is.
You know what I mean?
I have to be honest with India,

788
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:18.930
like before I got into this business,
no one ever like,

789
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.940
I'm trying to think like a,
at least using that technique,

790
00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:27.610
no one ever influenced me.
Like I like,
um,

791
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:30.100
there's people that influence me like,
oh,

792
00:47:30.101 --> 00:47:33.370
I want to listen to more of that music for a,
Oh wow,
there's,

793
00:47:33.371 --> 00:47:37.390
there's a part of the world like that.
I'd like to see that.
But like,
you know,

794
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.980
I actually,

795
00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:42.100
I don't see how like somebody make it like a fucking three minutes speech is

796
00:47:42.101 --> 00:47:44.760
going to have more of an impact than someone that you live your day to day with

797
00:47:44.761 --> 00:47:47.200
or your parents [inaudible] you know,
that's like,

798
00:47:47.201 --> 00:47:50.200
that's get that doctor Phil Shit.
Like when they solves problems and like,

799
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:53.010
while we watched that shit too.
Oh right.
We watch doctor Phil too,

800
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:56.570
dude living in the truck.
Oh.
And we have watched like judge Judy,

801
00:47:56.571 --> 00:47:59.720
we had a whole like stay at home mom day.
This dude,

802
00:47:59.721 --> 00:48:04.520
this dude was living in a truck with his kid and at night he was in during the

803
00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.640
night,
he was in a shelter and they drove around in the truck and it was just,

804
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.600
well,

805
00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:12.500
this kid with his two year old hitting him like Gatorade and sodas and stuff,

806
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.340
and he goes,
you know what?
Sometimes the kid doesn't eat,
but you know,

807
00:48:15.341 --> 00:48:17.110
I always try to make sure you know I,

808
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:20.890
I feed them when I can make sure he's got plenty of sugar and caffeine.
He said,

809
00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:24.490
yeah,
like that was like,
that was good.
He doesn't get,

810
00:48:24.491 --> 00:48:28.930
he doesn't get them like bottles of water.
He gets it and Gatorade and Coca Cola.

811
00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:33.490
That kid look fine and they never showed us say,
do you mean no,

812
00:48:33.491 --> 00:48:35.270
that was the music yet.
That was the music.
No,

813
00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:40.090
he looked like a feral animal roaming around a little bit.
Cute little kid.

814
00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:43.620
Yeah,
he did it,
but he also looked like a little,
I don't know.
Kids are dirty,

815
00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.680
not market.
I might tell you something right now.

816
00:48:46.681 --> 00:48:49.450
That kid's going to be able to figure out shit more than most of these Goddamn

817
00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.520
millennials,
you know,
that sat there with their clean fucking fingernails.
Lice,

818
00:48:53.521 --> 00:48:56.190
free heads in their fucking laptops.

819
00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:03.120
All right,
I got to get on with my day here.
Um,
all right,
that's it.

820
00:49:03.121 --> 00:49:07.860
That's the podcast to the movie.
Let's all go to the lobby.

821
00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:12.750
Let's all go to the lobby.
Let's all go to the lobby and the gate.

822
00:49:12.751 --> 00:49:15.690
What we did on the elliptical.
Alright,
go fuck yourselves.
Have a nice weekend.

823
00:49:15.691 --> 00:49:16.830

Okay.
Mama listing book.

827
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:29.870
I invest in a thing

828
00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:50.440
<v 6>Monday morning podcast and this is something I have to start off.</v>

829
00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:55.390
I've got to start right out of the gate talking about because someone had,
uh,

830
00:50:55.420 --> 00:51:00.370
someone was bitching at me that they liked my page,
but they couldn't,

831
00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:06.620
they couldn't shut off my podcasts so they could watch the other videos.
Um,

832
00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.640
if you are new to my page and you're listening to this podcast and you're

833
00:51:09.641 --> 00:51:12.580
already bored with it,
all you gotta do is just scroll down.

834
00:51:12.581 --> 00:51:16.000
It's right on the right hand side.
And it's a little XC.
Just click on it.

835
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:21.160
You'll burn half a calorie donuts and then you can do whatever else you want to

836
00:51:21.161 --> 00:51:25.570
do on the site.
All right.
Okay.

837
00:51:25.571 --> 00:51:30.550
Bruce,
can you figure that out?
Um,

838
00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:34.510
anyways,
what's going on?
How are you?
How was your week?

839
00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:36.520
Do you have a nice week everybody?

840
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.080
I actually had a great fucking week.
I'll show you.
When people do that,

841
00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:44.380
they ask you about something and they don't really give a fuck.

842
00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:47.080
They just setting it up so they can talk about it.
It's like,

843
00:51:47.081 --> 00:51:48.550
I knew I had an awesome week.

844
00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:52.030
So rather than just coming out and being braggadocious,

845
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:56.080
if that's even a fucking word,
and just saying,
I had an awesome week,

846
00:51:56.081 --> 00:52:00.520
I had to actually act like I was a considerate human being and remotely gave a

847
00:52:00.521 --> 00:52:04.780
fuck about what your week was like.
I had an awesome week.

848
00:52:04.781 --> 00:52:07.540
This is what I want to get to.
You don't want the end.
People do that.

849
00:52:07.541 --> 00:52:10.150
And then you start to talk about your weekend and like they start doing that.

850
00:52:10.151 --> 00:52:14.830
Nod that,
wrap it up.
That really hyper quick fucking chip Monck nod like Eh,

851
00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.820
maybe a little circular motion with the left hand light.

852
00:52:17.821 --> 00:52:22.821
Let's get to the point so I can get on and just download all my shit on the your

853
00:52:24.011 --> 00:52:26.230
spirit.
All right.
Wow.

854
00:52:26.231 --> 00:52:28.720
What an intro that's not going to make you want to listen to this.
Anyways,

855
00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:33.280
this is basically my awesome week.
I went to the Improv in Tampa,

856
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:34.833
Florida.

857
00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:40.000
I have to say that just in case there's a city in Ohio also named Tampa cause I

858
00:52:40.001 --> 00:52:43.630
know they have Miami,
Ohio.
Just fucking hilarious.

859
00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:48.610
It's got them frozen state.
I live in West Palm Beach,
Florida.

860
00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:53.250
No,
Ohio outside of Dayton.
Um,

861
00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:55.000
yeah,
so I was,

862
00:52:55.150 --> 00:53:00.150
I cannot begin to tell you guys how much dread I was looking at my first two

863
00:53:01.241 --> 00:53:04.630
gigs of this year,
Tampa,
Florida and Houston,
Texas.

864
00:53:04.631 --> 00:53:09.280
Both cities I was looking at with dread.

865
00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:12.910
I'm still looking at Houston with dread.
Why you ask,

866
00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:15.190
is it because you don't like Tampa?

867
00:53:15.191 --> 00:53:20.191
Bill did is you got something against the oil makers in Houston now it's because

868
00:53:21.311 --> 00:53:24.340
the last time I went to both those towns combined,

869
00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:29.190
I think 30 people came up to came out to see me,
you know,
and I'm like,

870
00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:33.140
I'm not going to lie to you guys.
I'm an older fellow at this point.
And,
uh,

871
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:36.480
going on the road can be hard sometimes and if you don't believe me,

872
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.360
just talk to that Filipino who's singing for journey.

873
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:42.990
He's already bitching fucking little pussy.

874
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:48.600
You believe that guy fucking guy's singing karaoke in a third world country and

875
00:53:48.601 --> 00:53:53.400
now he's playing the Goddamn fucking La Forum and he's complaining about how

876
00:53:53.401 --> 00:53:58.230
lonely the road is because he's been out there for fucking six weeks.

877
00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:00.990
Jesus Christ.
You know,

878
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:05.820
I can't tell if that guy is just a whiny little con or fee or fees of fucking

879
00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:06.840
maybe does,

880
00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:09.750
knows who he is and he can actually step outside of this and you don't do it.

881
00:54:09.751 --> 00:54:13.860
I really just wanted to fucking sing karaoke and uh,
you know,

882
00:54:13.861 --> 00:54:18.300
singing with you guys was awesome and I'm over it cause I know it really makes

883
00:54:18.301 --> 00:54:18.781
me happy.

884
00:54:18.781 --> 00:54:23.781
My friends and my family and making little Bok Choy as I squat and my hut or

885
00:54:24.121 --> 00:54:26.880
whatever the fuck it is that they do over there at typical American.

886
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.030
I don't know where you from.
You know,

887
00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.340
I think you're squatting in a hut eaten Bok Choy.

888
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:35.640
I didn't even know about Joe is,
and I've had it,
I think it's Korean.

889
00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:40.770
Is that Kimchi?
Um,
boy have a fuck that guy.

890
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.650
You know what I mean?
Why can't you just be honest and just be like,

891
00:54:43.651 --> 00:54:45.540
you know what?
Um,

892
00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:50.190
I thought I liked journeys music when I was singing it once every other Tuesday

893
00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:51.730
and um,

894
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:56.670
King Fung Woo's bar and grill in fucking the Philippines,

895
00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:01.710
but uh,
you know,
singing it,
every night's kind of fucking boring.

896
00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:04.560
And I'm out here with a bunch of fucking geezers.

897
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:08.220
We're trying to recapture some other shit.
And one of them,

898
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:11.820
the guy who the keyboards is still wearing his tight pants and it's just

899
00:55:11.821 --> 00:55:13.170
something I don't like seeing,

900
00:55:13.171 --> 00:55:17.730
but I don't have enough say in the band being as I'm a fucking contest winner.

901
00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.820
Jesus Christ.
Can you imagine the awkwardness on the road?

902
00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:24.360
Like this fucking guy that could go,
you know,

903
00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:28.590
they actually went through all the bullshit that band.
Okay.

904
00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:33.300
They ate fucking spaghetti every God damn week,
whatever the fuck they did.

905
00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:38.480
They lived in a van and they fuck in down by the river and they fucking made it.

906
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:40.260
You know,

907
00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:44.580
they made it and then they got no big fight with Steve Perry because he thought

908
00:55:44.581 --> 00:55:46.200
he could go on his own making oh,

909
00:55:46.201 --> 00:55:51.201
Sherry and some other forgettable sappy shit and uh,

910
00:55:51.391 --> 00:55:53.970
you know,
lawsuits,
all that behind the music shit.

911
00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:57.840
And now they're back on tour again and they just fucking plucked this guy,

912
00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.800
you know,
up out of a tsunami and now he's playing,
look,

913
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:05.100
I just don't understand how,
how do you fucking bond?

914
00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:08.700
You know what I mean?
That'd be like me.

915
00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:13.730
Last time I played quarterback I think was just fucking some pickup game in

916
00:56:14.431 --> 00:56:18.540
eighth grade and all of a sudden I'm fucking,
you know,

917
00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:20.790
I show up in week,
week 15

918
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:25.750
for the ravens that don't know.
You made the point.

919
00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:28.240
Why don't you get back to you Greg Week?
Hey,

920
00:56:28.241 --> 00:56:31.160
why don't I own up to the fact that I told you guys last week that my,

921
00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:36.070
the Carolina Panthers were my dark horse and I believe that Jake the loan and

922
00:56:36.071 --> 00:56:37.330
what happens,
I jinxed him.

923
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:42.280
You heard of the sports illustrated jinx is a new genx in town and you fucking

924
00:56:42.281 --> 00:56:46.750
listening to it.
So my apologies to everybody in Carolina.
Um,

925
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:51.310
in my mind I'm going to Carolina.
All right,

926
00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:54.760
let me get back to my awesome weeks 20 ways.
Yeah.
Last time I went to Tampa,

927
00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:57.520
nobody fucking showed up.
And uh,

928
00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:02.560
and it was really disheartening because I think at that point my HBO special was

929
00:57:02.561 --> 00:57:06.400
out and that type of thing and that's when it really just hit me how fucking

930
00:57:06.401 --> 00:57:09.490
hard this businesses.
And I was really like,
wow,
man,

931
00:57:09.491 --> 00:57:12.250
what the fuck do I have to do?

932
00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:16.780
So I went to Tampa and what happened?

933
00:57:16.781 --> 00:57:21.280
I showed up and a bunch of fucking people showed up and they were great crowds

934
00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:25.570
and I got like,
you know,
a couple,
two or three partial standing ovations.

935
00:57:25.571 --> 00:57:28.070
I was killing it.
I was having a great time after my nuts.

936
00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:33.120
Nice month of rest and relaxation from a bunch of finance bitches.

937
00:57:33.461 --> 00:57:36.920
Came out to the club baby.
Um,
no,

938
00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:39.290
a lot of good looking broads down there and uh,

939
00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:43.510
and I'd probably drink too much fucking to what a three nights

940
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.193
was a good time.

941
00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:50.320
We don't like that Kyle had show if anybody from that show is listening,

942
00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:54.920
um,
tell him I said thank you.
So fucking great show.
I'm going to list,

943
00:57:54.921 --> 00:57:56.920
this is how cool this is.
How great the whole week was.

944
00:57:56.921 --> 00:57:59.830
I went in to the cow head show right off the bat.

945
00:57:59.831 --> 00:58:02.080
That guy's totally cool right off the bat.

946
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:05.530
He knows how to give a great interview.
I don't have to do material.

947
00:58:05.531 --> 00:58:08.890
We just vibing,
everything's flowing.
And then all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

948
00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:11.500
a guide,
one of my buddies from high school,

949
00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:16.000
when I had season tickets to the patriots in 1989 when they sucked and we used

950
00:58:16.001 --> 00:58:20.050
to all pile in the back of his landscaping truck with that half keg of fucking

951
00:58:20.051 --> 00:58:24.580
beer and a bag of chips that he fucking calls up,

952
00:58:24.970 --> 00:58:26.380
find out he's living down there.

953
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:29.620
Next thing you know where on the radio together talking about Shit we did 20

954
00:58:29.621 --> 00:58:32.680
years ago,
and if that wasn't cool enough,

955
00:58:32.681 --> 00:58:36.610
they had an electronic drum kit there and they came out of the radio break

956
00:58:36.611 --> 00:58:40.120
playing the immigrant song and I was on the drums playing fighters with fucking

957
00:58:40.121 --> 00:58:41.560
heaven,
this total geek moment.

958
00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:44.620
And then I went down to the club and it was fucking,
you know,

959
00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:48.820
I'm not going to say it's packed,
but I got into the upper deck,
you know,

960
00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:51.400
just picture a uh,

961
00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:57.040
just picture and Atlanta Braves game when they finally make it to the fucking,

962
00:58:57.850 --> 00:59:01.060
the,
the NLCS.
That's how full the club,

963
00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:06.520
it's about three quarters full.
Fuck you guys.
That was all happy with that.

964
00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:07.990
I thought that was,
I mean nobody down there.

965
00:59:07.991 --> 00:59:09.460
So I want to thank everybody down there.

966
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.300
So Houston you got to come through for me.
Okay.

967
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:17.570
Want to go up and I play that Improv that's underneath that overpass and that

968
00:59:17.571 --> 00:59:20.170
strip mall where evidently there's a lot of violence.

969
00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:25.760
Who the fuck did the research on that one
anyways?

970
00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:30.320
I also like when you walk into that one,
how it looks like scar faces,
lobby.

971
00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:36.470
Just the fucking,
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,

972
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:39.170
why am I shitting on a club then I'm going to,
no,
it's a great time.

973
00:59:39.171 --> 00:59:42.310
It's a great part of town.
And uh,
all I know is I got to,

974
00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:45.510
I finally got my new wow.
It's together and I'm really happy and it's,

975
00:59:45.511 --> 00:59:48.010
it's really,
it's,
it's a,
if things are going good,

976
00:59:48.011 --> 00:59:51.470
so just fucking come out all right.
For the love of God.
But either way,

977
00:59:51.471 --> 00:59:52.131
even if it sucks,

978
00:59:52.131 --> 00:59:56.150
I'm going to south pole guitars so I'll still have a good time and I'm going to

979
00:59:56.151 --> 00:59:59.800
go skating at your fucking mall cause I'm,
let's say,

980
01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:04.610
oh right.
So let's get into the podcast here.

981
01:00:04.611 --> 01:00:07.400
So I have hyped what I have coming up.

982
01:00:07.401 --> 01:00:11.290
I'm going to be at the Improv in Houston and a,

983
01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:14.360
these are the dates.
Uh,

984
01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:19.420
22nd 23rd and 24th go to Improv to Dotcom for all information.

985
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:22.970
And I'll be selling my brand new DVD.

986
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.870
I'll be standing there like a fucking jackass in the end cause I have no pride.

987
01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:32.330
Um,
actually I decided something,
um,
that,
you know,

988
01:00:32.331 --> 01:00:33.890
cause there's a lot of guys are like,
you know,

989
01:00:33.891 --> 01:00:37.340
once they get past a certain level they don't want to stand there selling

990
01:00:37.341 --> 01:00:40.710
merchandise at the end of this show.
Um,

991
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:44.570
cause you feel like an idiot sometimes.
And um,

992
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:46.280
I got to admit I don't,

993
01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:50.210
I actually like kind of meeting people left shows lungs are not drunk morons

994
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:55.520
slapping me too hard in the back and spitting on me inadvertently.

995
01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:56.540
I don't mind that shit,

996
01:00:56.541 --> 01:01:00.200
but this is something that I'm not doing anymore or at least I want to say I'm

997
01:01:00.201 --> 01:01:02.540
not going to,
um,
who's kidding,

998
01:01:02.541 --> 01:01:05.750
who I'm going to do it because there's nothing worse than bringing DVDs home and

999
01:01:05.751 --> 01:01:08.840
your luggage,
you fucking bag weighs like 80 pounds.

1000
01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:13.840
But like I hate when I work at club where I have two shows and however the crowd

1001
01:01:15.831 --> 01:01:16.664
walks in,

1002
01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:21.200
there's not enough room to have the next crowd stand there and have the other

1003
01:01:21.201 --> 01:01:22.460
crowd walk out.

1004
01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:27.200
So they send the first crowd out the side door and if you want to sell your

1005
01:01:27.201 --> 01:01:30.530
merge,
you're literally standing outside the club.

1006
01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:35.540
And I cannot begin to tell you how much of a fucking moron

1007
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:40.040
I feed in people's eyes too.
When they see me,
like I was doing,

1008
01:01:40.041 --> 01:01:44.600
like I was standing outside the Improv and not Tampa.

1009
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:48.990
And they have like,
it's one of those,
you know,
as the,

1010
01:01:48.991 --> 01:01:52.190
as the guy like a sports bought a movie theater,
it's all like this one little,

1011
01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:53.780
they can say an outdoor mall.

1012
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:57.740
And I'm literally standing there and people are going,
excuse me,
excuse me.

1013
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:59.900
People who don't give a fuck about the shell,

1014
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:04.760
who have no idea who I am and an audience members who like give a shit,

1015
01:02:04.761 --> 01:02:09.761
who I am really see where I am in this business in that moment is some plumber

1016
01:02:09.861 --> 01:02:13.970
just goes,
hey,
uh,
a pasty.
When did you get the fuck out of the way?

1017
01:02:13.971 --> 01:02:18.560
So I can go see a,
well,
you know,
oh my God,

1018
01:02:18.561 --> 01:02:21.940
what Benjamin Buttons.
This is going to be at disjointed podcast.

1019
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:24.090
I don't give a fuck.
Right?
I'm on some new diet.

1020
01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:28.020
My fucking just had eight egg whites.

1021
01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:32.370
I'm never doing that again man.
It's just fucking brutal.

1022
01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:37.380
I saw that movie Benjamin Buttons.
Bill,
can you stick with the subject?
Yes,

1023
01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.070
that's what I'm saying.

1024
01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:42.480
I don't want to fucking stand outside of club and do that shit anymore.
Okay.

1025
01:02:42.481 --> 01:02:45.360
I'll stand in the club,
but there's a table,
you know,

1026
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.240
I would even make the change.
I don't give a shit,

1027
01:02:48.241 --> 01:02:51.330
but I think I'm going to draw the line and I'm not going to stand outside of

1028
01:02:51.331 --> 01:02:56.331
venue dealing with the elements and people on their way to a fucking Applebee's.

1029
01:02:57.270 --> 01:03:00.600
As I tried to hock my merchandise because,
uh,
I've,
I've gotta admit,
I felt,

1030
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:04.020
I felt,
uh,
felt pretty,
uh,
pretty pathetic,

1031
01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.550
pretty fucking pathetic.
So,
um,
anyways,
let's get on.

1032
01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:12.930
Let's get on with the podcast here and remind me to talk about led Zeppelin

1033
01:03:12.931 --> 01:03:15.000
later.
I don't know how you're going to do that,

1034
01:03:15.001 --> 01:03:16.260
so I might as well talk about it now.

1035
01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:20.610
I'm pretty devastated because I fucking love that group.

1036
01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:25.500
And I had heard rumors and I kind of knew they had a couple of blues songs that

1037
01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:30.501
they reworked in air quotes and they didn't quite give people credit for it and

1038
01:03:32.881 --> 01:03:37.440
uh,
evidently it goes way beyond that.
And uh,
there's some stuff on youtube.

1039
01:03:37.441 --> 01:03:41.280
I'm always looking at led Zepplin shit cause I'm a huge John Bonham fan and

1040
01:03:41.281 --> 01:03:44.940
somehow I stumbled across this thing cause I guess the Youtube Guy was just on

1041
01:03:44.941 --> 01:03:45.780
Howard Stern.

1042
01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:51.240
So there was a lot of shit on them about them stealing material.
And uh,

1043
01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:57.030
all I can say is wow,
it went beyond a couple of songs.

1044
01:03:57.570 --> 01:03:58.620
It went into,

1045
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:03.210
I mean every song but two songs and their first album,

1046
01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.250
half the songs on their second album,

1047
01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:10.460
they're even trying to say that they ripped off the intro to stairway to heaven.

1048
01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:15.480
They had like an opening act on tour with them.
I just,
I dunno,

1049
01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.460
I don't know how to process it.
And not only that,

1050
01:04:17.461 --> 01:04:20.730
I just brought my about my nephew,
the fucking box set,

1051
01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:23.670
the entire digitally remaster,

1052
01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:27.210
remaster box set of led Zepplin for Christmas.
You know,

1053
01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:32.950
thinking I'm the cool uncle and I just gave him a,
uh,

1054
01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:36.330
a box of stolen shit.

1055
01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:41.550
Just fucking brutal checkout that Jeff Beck album truth.

1056
01:04:41.551 --> 01:04:44.040
I just downloaded it.
How many more times?

1057
01:04:44.041 --> 01:04:47.460
He literally takes a section straight up from the guy,

1058
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:51.330
but you know,
I think that's on those other guys.
They should should've just fun.

1059
01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.100
You know,
you know what it is.
You can't do anything.

1060
01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:54.630
It's nothing you can do about it.

1061
01:04:54.631 --> 01:04:57.810
They fucking steel and they get credit and they get taken into the hall of fame

1062
01:04:58.910 --> 01:05:02.370
is fucking brutal.
All right.
That was a bummer.
All right.
Did I just say a bummer?

1063
01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:05.010
They actually kind of worked because I was talking about music from the 60.

1064
01:05:05.011 --> 01:05:09.300
[inaudible] that was a bummer man.
What a drag.
Um,

1065
01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:11.400
all right.
Anyway,

1066
01:05:11.401 --> 01:05:15.000
so last week I got up on my soapbox a little bit or my Ottoman,

1067
01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:17.470
if you want to get technical.
And

1068
01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:23.440
I was talking about last week how I'm sick of going into these places of

1069
01:05:23.441 --> 01:05:26.950
business and with this new technology,

1070
01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:31.980
they're firing fellow Americans and they're making me do the,

1071
01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:37.450
the fired employee's job.
And to me that is not progress.
All right?

1072
01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:39.130
That is,
uh,

1073
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:42.910
adding another person out there who's going to be competing for me for a job

1074
01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.070
while I do their fucking job for free.

1075
01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.770
So I asked people what they thought about that shit.

1076
01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:52.060
You know what I'm talking specifically about going into a grocery store and they

1077
01:05:52.061 --> 01:05:55.240
want me to check myself out.
Okay.

1078
01:05:55.241 --> 01:05:58.540
As if I'm somehow going to do it faster than a cashier.

1079
01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:01.900
That seems to be the illusion here that that makes it faster.

1080
01:06:02.890 --> 01:06:03.401
You know what I mean?

1081
01:06:03.401 --> 01:06:07.750
Somebody who actually works there and does it 9,000 times a day so they can only

1082
01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:11.500
have to look at the fucking keyboard.
Goddamn Stevie wonder,

1083
01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:13.030
fucking blowing through it,
you know,

1084
01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:16.420
and somehow I'm going to be quicker than that,
you know?
So anyways,

1085
01:06:16.421 --> 01:06:21.190
I asked people what they thought about it and uh,
I got an interesting,

1086
01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:22.120
I got to,
you know,

1087
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:27.150
basically I took two of them that kind of summed up everybody's shit and then I

1088
01:06:27.911 --> 01:06:31.360
switched up some of the guitar parts and I called it stairway to heaven.
No,

1089
01:06:31.361 --> 01:06:34.090
wait a minute.
All right.
Um,
somebody said,
I agree with you.

1090
01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:39.160
New Technologies often make certain jobs obsolete,
but they also create new ones.

1091
01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:39.994
And this case,

1092
01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:43.780
I don't think there are enough low level jobs out there to start getting rid of

1093
01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:48.610
cashiers.
Um,
yeah,
and I definitely agree with you.
I,

1094
01:06:48.611 --> 01:06:52.900
I don't feel like
they're making you,

1095
01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:55.690
you're walking into the grocery stores,
the customer,

1096
01:06:55.691 --> 01:06:59.650
they're making you be a cashier for free and everyone's sitting there going out.

1097
01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:01.760
It's quicker.
This is what this guy said.

1098
01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.030
This guy is saying let's guys find to go bill.

1099
01:07:04.031 --> 01:07:06.370
As far as the self checkout line and grocery store,

1100
01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:08.950
I can't agree with your take on the situation.

1101
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:14.190
Any place I have seen with self checkout lines still have regular lines as well.

1102
01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:16.420
Can you believe that point?

1103
01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:21.280
Any place I've seen with self checkout lines still have the regular lines as

1104
01:07:21.281 --> 01:07:22.114
well.

1105
01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:26.590
Obviously they're just not overnight going to get rid of everybody.

1106
01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:32.550
They're teaching you how to be a cashier for free and once we all get it down,

1107
01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:36.970
eventually they're going to get rid of everybody the same way.

1108
01:07:36.971 --> 01:07:38.650
They don't want it with like those tolls,

1109
01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:42.580
those easy fast things that you know never.

1110
01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:45.280
There was only one easy pass line.
Now it's down.

1111
01:07:45.281 --> 01:07:48.310
There's only one toll booth line and sometimes you get off the exit.

1112
01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:51.760
There is no toll booth.
You just better have the fucking right amount of change,

1113
01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.790
you know?
I guess that does make it easier,

1114
01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:57.820
but also let them know where the fuck you are.
Which annoys the shit on me,

1115
01:07:57.821 --> 01:07:59.110
but I wasn't bitching about that.

1116
01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:04.090
It would be only reason why 10 out of 10 lines are not automated is because it's

1117
01:08:04.091 --> 01:08:08.050
a new technology and that's why they have the douche standing there teaching you

1118
01:08:08.051 --> 01:08:08.920
how to fucking use.

1119
01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:14.040
They teaching you how to be a cashier so they can fire other cashiers and then

1120
01:08:14.201 --> 01:08:17.780
they don't have to pay cashiers and you as the customer who used to just come up

1121
01:08:17.781 --> 01:08:21.950
with your food to stand there and rubbed your fucking balls looking around you.

1122
01:08:21.951 --> 01:08:25.010
Don't you understand the arrogance of that.
Hey,
why don't you come into my store,

1123
01:08:25.011 --> 01:08:28.730
pick out what you want.
You figure out what the fuck you all me pay me,

1124
01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:31.970
stick you stick it in the bag and then get the fuck out of my store.

1125
01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:37.460
You'll find a problem with that.
Anyways,
this guy continues to say,

1126
01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:42.610
I don't think anyone is losing any jobs or that grocery stores are going to turn

1127
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:47.210
into self serving only venues.
I'm sorry,
but I'm going to stand in line.

1128
01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:51.050
I'm not going to stand in line behind the soccer mom who's buying enough

1129
01:08:51.051 --> 01:08:55.760
groceries to last the entire winter.
Meanwhile,
all I got is a box of cereal,

1130
01:08:55.790 --> 01:08:56.840
cereal,
and milk,

1131
01:08:57.230 --> 01:09:01.100
and now I have to tell myself I'm doing a good thing for the workforce by Resu

1132
01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:05.960
refusing to serve myself and the self checkout line.
Not In this lifetime.

1133
01:09:05.961 --> 01:09:10.070
My fine feathered friend,
he really thought he made a great point there.

1134
01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:13.790
What do you know what?
I think you're a retard when you think about that.

1135
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:19.070
Who stands in line in front of behind somebody who's got enough fucking

1136
01:09:19.071 --> 01:09:22.310
groceries for the winter when all you have is a box of cereal and milk?

1137
01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:26.670
Have you ever heard of the express checkout eight items or less heavy?

1138
01:09:26.690 --> 01:09:31.130
You never noticed that.
You know what?

1139
01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:34.820
That,
that uh,
that this fucking pissed,
that whole thing just pissed me off.

1140
01:09:34.821 --> 01:09:35.331
You know what?
Get,

1141
01:09:35.331 --> 01:09:39.200
it's great to get stand in line and go do a job you didn't have to do before and

1142
01:09:39.201 --> 01:09:42.350
do it for free and put somebody else out of work and tell yourself that it's

1143
01:09:42.351 --> 01:09:43.184
fucking quicker.

1144
01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:46.880
The same way they're doing that on TV where they got that commercial and they

1145
01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:51.350
try to mind fuck you into thinking that using your ATM card is quicker than

1146
01:09:51.351 --> 01:09:54.590
using cash.
You know,

1147
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:57.710
come on man,
you should fucking head.
You know what?

1148
01:09:57.711 --> 01:09:59.390
They're doing this phase and out cash,

1149
01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:03.880
so now there's no more under the table bullshit out there and you're going to

1150
01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:08.840
get taxed even fucking more and they'll know where you are at all fucking times.

1151
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:12.590
That's what they're doing.
Alright?

1152
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:16.970
Debit cards are not quicker than cash,
and I love the commercial that they have.

1153
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:18.530
I don't know if this is still running it,

1154
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:22.910
but they literally used homophobia to try to convince you.

1155
01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:28.730
You know,
they,
they put into that part of your brain,
Hey,
I'm not sucking Dick.

1156
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:32.510
I'm going to use a fucking debit card.
They basically had this commercial,

1157
01:10:32.511 --> 01:10:35.810
they had a bunch of people buying a Steelers jerseys.

1158
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.530
I remember they're all buying football jerseys and they're going through the

1159
01:10:39.531 --> 01:10:42.590
line and everybody's using a debit card and they're playing that bugs bunny

1160
01:10:42.591 --> 01:10:46.160
music.
Dunt dunt Duh,
Duh,
Duh,
Duh,
Duh,
Duh,
Duh,
Duh,
Duh,
Duh,

1161
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:48.440
and everything's going great and it's,

1162
01:10:48.441 --> 01:10:52.370
and people are swiping at once and they just grabbing the bag and the whole

1163
01:10:52.371 --> 01:10:55.670
transaction takes literally two seconds.
Okay.

1164
01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.530
Which has not been my experience ever.

1165
01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:01.040
The Guy fucking tried to put the password in,
it doesn't fucking work.

1166
01:11:01.041 --> 01:11:04.520
They swipe it three times and the cashier finally spins the thing around,

1167
01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:09.080
tries to do it themselves.
It's a big fucking pain in the ass.
So anyways,

1168
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:13.290
after all these guys cruise through,
then this,
you know,
buying football jerseys,

1169
01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:18.530
this fucking guy comes up to buy tennis balls with a pink sweater tied around

1170
01:11:19.951 --> 01:11:24.360
his neck and he's piece paying cash.
And the second he takes out the cash,

1171
01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:25.201
you know that,

1172
01:11:25.201 --> 01:11:28.320
that music just comes to a dead halt and everybody's staring at them.

1173
01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:34.200
You get it,
you know,
football men,
tennis,

1174
01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:39.880
pink sweater,
Fag,
I just fucking unreal.
You know,

1175
01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:41.940
fuck this shit.
I'm just gonna go live in the fucking mountains.

1176
01:11:41.941 --> 01:11:43.260
I'm tired of trying to convince people.

1177
01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.380
I had this stupid girl in the front row as explaining the whole fucking thing to

1178
01:11:46.381 --> 01:11:47.214
her.
And she's like,

1179
01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:51.030
still told me that the thing that she was going to use the automated checkout at

1180
01:11:51.031 --> 01:11:54.990
the cashier at the,
at the grocery store,
because I go,
why?
She goes,
because it's

1181
01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:00.280
how,
how has it,
how has it quicker,
you know,

1182
01:12:00.281 --> 01:12:01.860
you could teach me how to change a fucking tire.

1183
01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.420
I'm not going to do a quick and then I'm fucking mechanic or change my oil or

1184
01:12:06.421 --> 01:12:10.680
what I don't fucking whatever,
whatever,
whatever.
Standing those fucking lines.

1185
01:12:10.681 --> 01:12:14.970
You've fucking drones.
Oh see all childless again,

1186
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:18.120
when people have a different opinion,
this is why I can't sustain a relationship.

1187
01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:21.960
Okay,
let's get,
let's get to the,
you know,
it really is,

1188
01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:26.970
I'm just fucking annoyed that I found out that one of the groups that I loved

1189
01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:32.040
has stolen all this God damn music.
I want to do it.

1190
01:12:32.041 --> 01:12:32.731
It just,
you know,

1191
01:12:32.731 --> 01:12:34.890
you know what's funny about it lets up on as they always had that,

1192
01:12:34.891 --> 01:12:38.640
that cheesy shit where they would just like trying to say that they all sold

1193
01:12:38.641 --> 01:12:39.780
their soul to the devil.

1194
01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.170
Everybody sold their soul to the devil except for John Paul Jones.

1195
01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:48.150
And that's why all about that horrific shit happened.
Like John Bonham died.

1196
01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:52.980
Robert Plant got in a car accident and this kid died mysteriously and uh,

1197
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:56.490
Jimmy Page,
I dunno,
he fucking,

1198
01:12:56.910 --> 01:13:00.150
his eyes got all squinty.
I Dunno.
What the fuck,
what happened?
Jimmy page?

1199
01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:05.570
He didn't lose a finger.
That was a guy from black sabbath.
Bam.

1200
01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.270
Did Jimmy page.
He had a castle.
I Dunno some,

1201
01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.390
I'm going to Jimmy page,
some Adam bad to everybody.

1202
01:13:12.391 --> 01:13:14.280
But you know what the reason it wasn't that they sold the soul,

1203
01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.860
it was Karma for steel and all those fucking songs

1204
01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:22.890
you've been inducted into the hall of fame.
All right.
Whatever.

1205
01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:27.120
Okay.
Anyways,
you know what?
I should have been more mature about that.

1206
01:13:27.121 --> 01:13:29.670
Some people don't fucking agree with me on those.
Uh,

1207
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:35.850
those automated lines.
I just,
I know I can me,
it's clear as fucking day.

1208
01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:41.540
It's clear as fucking day,
you know,
I'm not a hundred percent against you.

1209
01:13:41.541 --> 01:13:44.940
Like when I go to the airport,
sometimes that automated shit is quicker.

1210
01:13:44.941 --> 01:13:47.910
Like when you go to check yourself in for a flight,
that's definitely,

1211
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:49.830
definitely fucking quicker.

1212
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:54.060
But when I get on the plane and they start telling me I need to fold up my

1213
01:13:54.061 --> 01:13:57.810
blanket to help expedite the cleaning of the cabin,
go fuck yourself.

1214
01:13:58.770 --> 01:14:01.890
All right?
That's for the cleaning crew.
I'm sorry they fired the cleaning crew.

1215
01:14:01.891 --> 01:14:05.670
I'm not doing that fucking job.
I did my job.
I got on the plane.

1216
01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.820
I said a prayer on takeoff and landing that we wouldn't crash.

1217
01:14:08.821 --> 01:14:12.520
I didn't try to open the emergency door or charged the cockpit.
I'm done.

1218
01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:15.300
You know,
I'm not taking out a fucking limp.
Russian,

1219
01:14:15.330 --> 01:14:19.420
a crumb bar and cleaning up my fucking area.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1220
01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:23.110
I don't work for the airline.
And we go,
Hey,

1221
01:14:23.111 --> 01:14:24.430
and I'm getting a new laptop this week,

1222
01:14:24.431 --> 01:14:27.460
so this is the last time you're going to hear that fucking annoying clicking

1223
01:14:27.461 --> 01:14:30.940
sound,
trying to do it smoother.
All right,

1224
01:14:30.941 --> 01:14:33.310
let's get to the podcast questions for the weekend.
I got to tell you guys,

1225
01:14:33.311 --> 01:14:36.420
this is going to be a short podcast this week because,
uh,

1226
01:14:36.850 --> 01:14:41.530
I have a ton of shit to do.
I'm like,

1227
01:14:41.531 --> 01:14:45.390
can I just be nicer?
Um,
I appreciate you guys all listening to my podcast.
Like,

1228
01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:49.120
I have to go back into there,
the 700 club guy,
you know,

1229
01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:53.350
put your hands on your lap top screen.
Let's say praying for cheese.
I'm no,

1230
01:14:53.351 --> 01:14:56.350
I appreciate all you guys listening and all that type of stuff and uh,

1231
01:14:56.710 --> 01:14:59.920
we're gonna be blown through it.
Why can't you have a sensitive moment,
Phil?

1232
01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:04.750
Why can't you open up?
Okay.
Take a deep breath.
Let it out.

1233
01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:09.580
I appreciate the fact that all you guys listen to my podcasts,

1234
01:15:10.150 --> 01:15:13.600
but uh,
I have a lot of um,
things that I have to get done to.

1235
01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:17.200
I can't fucking do it.
I got a lot of shit to do.
All right,
question number one.

1236
01:15:17.290 --> 01:15:21.790
Uh,
Bill,
you often talk on the cast of how people shouldn't work.

1237
01:15:21.791 --> 01:15:24.520
Certain jobs that helped the man

1238
01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:28.150
fucked and fucked the common folk.

1239
01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:33.150
One of my jobs I currently work cause I'm broke is essentially telemarketing and

1240
01:15:33.551 --> 01:15:38.500
I go home from it feeling dirty,
but who's fault is it really mine or the dopes?

1241
01:15:38.501 --> 01:15:43.480
I'm fucking and where exactly do draw the line of what jobs to not work

1242
01:15:43.481 --> 01:15:46.870
according to your personal standards.
All right.

1243
01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:49.120
A telemarketing.
I mean,

1244
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:55.900
that's not making me do a job.
So I mean,
as annoying as it is,

1245
01:15:55.901 --> 01:15:57.940
you can,
you can sign yourself up for that.

1246
01:15:57.941 --> 01:16:02.020
Don't call list on the Internet if you guys want to look that up.

1247
01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:06.790
I did that and nobody ever fucking calls me.
And uh,
um,
but I mean,

1248
01:16:06.791 --> 01:16:10.000
I don't know what you'd tell a marketing.
You say you go home feeling dirty.

1249
01:16:10.001 --> 01:16:13.750
I'd have to know what it is that you do because you're like,

1250
01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:18.460
I feel really guilty,
but who's fault is it?
Mine or the dopes?

1251
01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:20.470
I'm fucking so obviously,

1252
01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:24.520
whatever you're selling them is bullshit and you know,
it's bullshit,

1253
01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:30.210
but you're telling them that it's,
it's great shit.
So,
uh,

1254
01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:34.930
who's fault is that?
Ah,
that's yours.
I'm going to say that's yours.

1255
01:16:35.730 --> 01:16:39.820
You know,
you know,
dude,
you know what's yours?

1256
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:43.930
You go home feeling dirty.
You're obviously doing some shit you don't want to do.

1257
01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:46.360
But I understand any port in a storm,

1258
01:16:46.361 --> 01:16:50.710
I don't know if he's selling people sham wows like morons like me and I buy it a

1259
01:16:50.711 --> 01:16:53.260
fucking things.
You know,
you're not really hurt.

1260
01:16:53.290 --> 01:16:55.720
I don't know what the fuck I'd have to know what you're selling.
You know,

1261
01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:59.350
if it's selling those fucking mortgages that screwed over this economy,

1262
01:16:59.830 --> 01:17:02.830
then you should feel dirty.
But,
uh,
I dunno,
I don't fucking know.

1263
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:05.441
I'm trying to think,
you know,

1264
01:17:05.441 --> 01:17:09.070
something I used to tell the market so I can't judge you.

1265
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:14.110
I refuse to sell newspaper subscriptions over the phone and you know,

1266
01:17:14.361 --> 01:17:16.580
when you're just doing that sort of cold calling,

1267
01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:19.790
the only weapon you have is the lie your ass off.

1268
01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:24.320
And the only way I got through it was trying to make the guy next to me laugh.

1269
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:29.090
I used to go by Bill Macdonald and uh,

1270
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:31.280
the other guy,
what the fuck did he get?

1271
01:17:31.281 --> 01:17:34.460
One of the guys I worked with actually went by the name Keith Crowder,

1272
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:38.840
who was the name of one of the guys who actually played on the Boston Bruins and

1273
01:17:38.841 --> 01:17:39.920
we were in Boston.

1274
01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:46.010
He used to call people up,
hey,
how you doing?

1275
01:17:46.011 --> 01:17:49.550
This is Keith crowd or calm from the Boston globe.
And people would just,

1276
01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:53.090
every once in a while some of you like,
oh yeah,
Keith Crowder.
He'd be like,

1277
01:17:53.091 --> 01:17:54.480
Oh yeah,
you gotta be,
Oh,

1278
01:17:54.490 --> 01:17:58.130
you played for the Bruins and [inaudible] got it's my cousin.

1279
01:17:58.131 --> 01:18:02.060
Or he would just say that.
Oh yeah,
I get that all the time.
You know what I mean?

1280
01:18:02.061 --> 01:18:06.380
Like if your name was actually Barry Manilow or some shit,
um,

1281
01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:09.650
I don't know,
Dude.
I'm not trying to make you feel guilty.

1282
01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:11.620
I would just try to get out of that fucking job.
But dude,

1283
01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:14.300
if he can't get out of that job,
I mean,
what do you,
what are you gonna do?

1284
01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:17.100
And all depends on what you're doing,
dude.

1285
01:18:18.170 --> 01:18:22.570
If his stealing from old ladies and taking that their life savings and uh,

1286
01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:24.920
you know,
I had a buddy of mine,

1287
01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:27.230
he was doing something like that and he ended up in jail.

1288
01:18:27.230 --> 01:18:31.340
See Better Watch out whatever you're doing.
Um,

1289
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:34.580
you know what I'm really feeling like I'm fucking getting preachy and righteous

1290
01:18:34.581 --> 01:18:39.370
here.
Um,
and I don't know shit.
Just know that I don't lead,

1291
01:18:39.450 --> 01:18:42.380
you know,
even all that shit I just said about led Zeppelin.
Actually,

1292
01:18:42.381 --> 01:18:42.741
you know what,

1293
01:18:42.741 --> 01:18:46.580
that wasn't just youtube shit I watched on Youtube and this kid had the music to

1294
01:18:46.581 --> 01:18:49.810
back it up.
So,
but anything else is a,

1295
01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:53.780
that comes in our mouse mostly is bullshit.
All right,
question number two.
Uh,

1296
01:18:53.781 --> 01:18:58.130
Bill,
is there any way to get links to the individual podcast?
I try to subscribe,

1297
01:18:58.131 --> 01:18:59.270
but I don't think it worked.

1298
01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:02.360
I'm not really as retarded as a computer makes me look.

1299
01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:05.000
I could not identify with you more.

1300
01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:09.410
That's exactly what happens to me every time I tried to watch or listen to

1301
01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:13.100
anything on the,
on the computer and I have no idea.
I don't know how to help you.

1302
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:18.920
I really don't.
Um,
I'm like,
I don't know.

1303
01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:23.540
I'm like,
what the fuck is that?
That that holiday and commercial,
you know?

1304
01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:25.580
No,
I don't know.
I don't know computers,

1305
01:19:25.581 --> 01:19:28.580
but I stayed at a Holiday Inn last night and Holiday Inn express or whatever the

1306
01:19:28.581 --> 01:19:31.160
fuck it is.
That's how I am.
You know,
I'm on the computer.

1307
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.620
I know how to put up a podcast,

1308
01:19:33.621 --> 01:19:35.420
but I don't know how to do any of that other stuff.

1309
01:19:35.421 --> 01:19:39.230
So if anybody's listening has this information and what's the email or two to
me,

1310
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:43.760
I'll read it next week and I'll pass it off as my own.
Just like Jimmy page.

1311
01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:47.540
Skinny icon.
All right.
Question number three.

1312
01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:53.360
You must get a ton of podcasts,
questions and overrated,
underrated stuff.

1313
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:56.890
How do you decide which ones to use in your podcasts?
Um,

1314
01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:00.830
I basically any anytime somebody,
if it's a repeat question,

1315
01:20:02.150 --> 01:20:06.020
um,
like I,
I try to ignore those,

1316
01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:08.370
but once every six months I will answer the question,

1317
01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:12.330
how did you get involved in stand up?
But,
um,
and then just,
yeah,

1318
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:13.201
they're good questions.

1319
01:20:13.201 --> 01:20:16.830
I feel like I can go off on them and they have funny then that's basically how I

1320
01:20:16.831 --> 01:20:20.370
do it.
But if it's a slow week,
I'll read every God damn one of them,

1321
01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:24.330
cause I don't get a ton of them.
I get like a dozen or so,
so a,

1322
01:20:24.331 --> 01:20:26.410
so if you have a question,
are you thinking like,
Oh man,

1323
01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:29.940
he's not even going to read it.
[inaudible] chances are I will read it.

1324
01:20:29.941 --> 01:20:33.000
You got an 80% chance.
How about that?
80% chance.

1325
01:20:33.001 --> 01:20:37.500
And that's based on not even mathematically studying it on any level.
All right,

1326
01:20:37.501 --> 01:20:42.060
question number four,
Bill.
Have you ever seen two guys start comparing scars?

1327
01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:46.800
Are these two guys just a bunch of tools or what?
Usually by the end,

1328
01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:52.140
one or the other has pulled up his shirt and pulled down his pants.
What?

1329
01:20:52.141 --> 01:20:55.950
A bunch of fags.
I got to admit,
I've never seen that.

1330
01:20:57.030 --> 01:21:00.840
Do you hang out in a pirate bar?
I have no idea.

1331
01:21:02.970 --> 01:21:07.170
That would be weird.
I,
yeah,
that's kind of awkward.

1332
01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:13.080
Uh,
reminds me of a,
that,
that,
that scene in jaws where they just sit around a,

1333
01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:17.670
yeah,
this right here.
Fucking
electric eels Zap me.

1334
01:21:17.671 --> 01:21:21.750
Oh yeah,
this a sting ray stuck me in the nuts,
whatever.

1335
01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:26.880
Now I've never seen that,
but I'm,
I,
the way the picture you painted,

1336
01:21:26.881 --> 01:21:31.260
I'd have to agree with your assessment.
You've got to say something like,

1337
01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:35.430
why don't you two fucking hacked up pussies?
Pull up your pants please.

1338
01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:40.620
For the love of God.
Anyways,
you know,

1339
01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:41.461
I resent seeing,

1340
01:21:41.461 --> 01:21:46.461
I resent seeing a middle aged man who has a smooth chest and that because they

1341
01:21:47.221 --> 01:21:48.054
shaved it.

1342
01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:53.120
Just the hair never came in and they got those fucking five daddy long legs

1343
01:21:53.551 --> 01:21:57.780
hanging off a one nipple and they don't work out and it's just all just,

1344
01:21:57.781 --> 01:22:01.860
it looks like a,
it looks like a melted snow man.

1345
01:22:05.090 --> 01:22:08.610
Ah,
that's why I don't,
I'm not a Jew.
I'm not a member of gym.
All right,
Bill,

1346
01:22:08.611 --> 01:22:13.200
if you and Jim Norton Never Comparative Appendix Scars.
Uh,
no,

1347
01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.210
no I haven't.
No,
I,
I,

1348
01:22:15.211 --> 01:22:18.340
this is a whole new fucking world that I don't want to get involved in.

1349
01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:22.560
This is some sort of,
do they have scar porn?

1350
01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:26.670
This is really making me uncomfortable.
Uh,
Bill,
besides your appendix scar,

1351
01:22:26.671 --> 01:22:29.910
what is your best scar and how did it happen?
All right,
they can answer this one.

1352
01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:34.911
I have one right above my left eyebrow that you can only see when if I'm

1353
01:22:34.921 --> 01:22:36.180
imitating the rock.

1354
01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:41.960
And how I got it was my older brother threw me off the porch headfirst and I

1355
01:22:43.051 --> 01:22:47.730
landed like a lawn dart into a flagstone.
This is basically,

1356
01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:51.960
it's basically the story.
We had a,
you have a,
you know those,
those,

1357
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:56.370
those porch swings that they have back in the day where uh,
if you,
if you came,

1358
01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:02.040
if you recording back in the day you'd come and they wouldn't let you go

1359
01:23:02.041 --> 01:23:05.440
anywhere.
So you'd sit out on a,
on a spring and it's on a swing.

1360
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.420
It's like basically a love seat,

1361
01:23:07.421 --> 01:23:11.680
but it's a swing and you sit out there and sing like light or rose or something.

1362
01:23:11.681 --> 01:23:13.420
Lot rose.
I'm home again.

1363
01:23:13.450 --> 01:23:17.170
Roseann barbershop quartet would show up like in the music man.
Yeah,

1364
01:23:17.171 --> 01:23:18.190
we had one of us.

1365
01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:23.230
So somehow my brother pissed me off and he was swinging like a fucking maniac on

1366
01:23:23.231 --> 01:23:27.430
that thing.
So I grabbed,
I think it was a rake.
I Dunno what,

1367
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:31.180
that it's not important what the business end of it was because it's really,

1368
01:23:31.181 --> 01:23:35.230
the story is about the handle of whatever I grabbed.
So it's a brome,
it's a rake.

1369
01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:40.540
I don't know what the fuck it was.
And as when he got up to the top,

1370
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:44.770
I stood underneath him like I was in 300 you know,

1371
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:50.260
and I just held that stick up and I fucking caught him right in his stomach.

1372
01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:54.070
And I held him for probably like half a second.

1373
01:23:54.490 --> 01:23:57.460
And then I dropped the broom handle,
whatever.

1374
01:23:57.461 --> 01:24:02.461
And I turned around and I went to run off of the porch and he had the momentum

1375
01:24:02.921 --> 01:24:06.940
of the swing coming down.
So he immediately was like right behind me.

1376
01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:09.130
Like you have a watch the roadrunner and the coyote.

1377
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:11.180
When the coyote chases the road runner,

1378
01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:16.240
Rolando goes flying by him and he's at a dead stop and somehow he catches all

1379
01:24:16.241 --> 01:24:18.670
the way up to them except for the last three feet.

1380
01:24:18.671 --> 01:24:21.400
That's what the fuck my brother did.
But he had the aid of a swing.

1381
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:26.770
So I'm right at the top step of the porch and he just sort of pushed me in the

1382
01:24:26.771 --> 01:24:30.010
middle of my back.
Look Claude Lemieux action.
Right?

1383
01:24:30.490 --> 01:24:33.850
And that's when I just went fucking airborne.
And uh,

1384
01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:37.540
I don't know if I ever told you this guy is the size of my huge head right now.

1385
01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.420
I had this head when I was,
it was the same size when I was born,

1386
01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:45.250
so I was probably 11 years old.
So let's,
you know,
for the sake of the story,

1387
01:24:45.251 --> 01:24:46.810
I'm fucking top heavy,
right?

1388
01:24:46.811 --> 01:24:51.811
So I immediately start going down like a fucking javelin and it happened so

1389
01:24:54.491 --> 01:24:56.800
fast,
I couldn't get my hands out.
He,
if I could,

1390
01:24:56.950 --> 01:25:01.950
I would've broke both my wrists trying to stop terminal velocity of my skull and

1391
01:25:02.261 --> 01:25:07.090
I just fucking went headfirst into this flagstone and a had a nice gash.

1392
01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:10.420
Actually took out a little chunk of my skull,
a little sliver of it,

1393
01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:14.140
of my Frankenstein brow.
And,
uh,

1394
01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:20.550
I just remember getting up and I went back up to the top of the porch and I was

1395
01:25:20.561 --> 01:25:24.910
leaning over the banister cause I didn't want to start bleeding in the house

1396
01:25:24.911 --> 01:25:27.940
cause I knew my dad was going to freak out cause he already had to stitch me up.

1397
01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:33.310
My Dad's a dentist,
so,
uh,
it's kind of cool.
Anytime you got stitches,

1398
01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:36.580
you didn't have to go to the hospital.
He just fucking,

1399
01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:39.730
it was like go like in between periods.
They just sew you up on the bench.

1400
01:25:39.731 --> 01:25:42.640
He just,
I can't do it right there and we,
you know,
it's funny,

1401
01:25:42.641 --> 01:25:45.790
we always ended up having to get stitches on his day off,
pull past,

1402
01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.440
it used to work like three weeks in a row,

1403
01:25:47.441 --> 01:25:51.850
we get one day off and then one of us would fall out of a tree or accidentally

1404
01:25:51.851 --> 01:25:56.110
in air quotes,
throw a fucking rockets.
And you know,
I did that one.

1405
01:25:56.410 --> 01:25:59.770
And uh,
we always use the same excuse,

1406
01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:03.950
I was running through the woods and I tripped and he'd be like,
oh Christ's sake,

1407
01:26:03.951 --> 01:26:08.780
I don't need this shit
any fucking either.
Yeah,

1408
01:26:08.781 --> 01:26:13.280
he just lays down on the sofa.
You don't numb us up.

1409
01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:17.000
And he starts stitching us up and we'd be going out and he'd be like,
come on,

1410
01:26:17.001 --> 01:26:21.830
stop it.
Stop it.
That doesn't hurt that bad.
And uh,

1411
01:26:21.831 --> 01:26:25.770
yeah,
then you'd have a fucking scarf.
There you go.
That's my,
uh,

1412
01:26:26.690 --> 01:26:30.620
do I have any other ones?
I got bit in the face by my own dog.

1413
01:26:31.730 --> 01:26:35.600
That was a good one.
We had this little West Highland terrier and uh,

1414
01:26:35.630 --> 01:26:39.830
we just kept fucking with them.
Um,
I don't know why.

1415
01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:41.930
I can't even remember why at this point is so fucking long ago.

1416
01:26:41.931 --> 01:26:44.030
We basically turned them into an attack dog.

1417
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:47.650
We started off just rough housing with them and then he would bite.

1418
01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:48.530
It's a little too hard.

1419
01:26:48.531 --> 01:26:52.700
And then we moved onto a garden glove and we started playing will be called the

1420
01:26:52.701 --> 01:26:56.210
glove game and we just keep pushing them in the face and then he figured out how

1421
01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:58.730
to bite.
So then we moved on to,

1422
01:26:58.731 --> 01:27:03.380
I think like hockey sticks and we just,
you know,
wasn't hit them really hard.

1423
01:27:03.381 --> 01:27:04.550
We just sorta like actually,
you know,

1424
01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:06.260
had trying to dig out the puck in the corner.

1425
01:27:06.261 --> 01:27:10.790
We kind of do that shit and he'd start biting at it.
And I remember when he,

1426
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:14.510
when he would bite down on it and he finally learned to start shaking it going

1427
01:27:14.511 --> 01:27:16.160
like,
oh,
I'm doing that shit.

1428
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:20.360
We thought it was the funniest shit ever,

1429
01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:25.570
you know?
And we were all like,
ages two to 10,
you know,

1430
01:27:25.610 --> 01:27:29.250
this is back in the day too,
when,
you know,
there was no Oprah Winfrey,

1431
01:27:29.251 --> 01:27:32.330
so people didn't know that you shouldn't leave fucking five kids under the age

1432
01:27:32.331 --> 01:27:37.160
of 10 at home with a dog and electricity,
you know?
And uh,

1433
01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:39.360
so yeah.
So we just turned this talking to a fucking attack though.

1434
01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.000
How can we really taught him how to bite?

1435
01:27:41.001 --> 01:27:45.080
And we all thought it was hilarious until he started doing it to us.
And,
uh,

1436
01:27:45.170 --> 01:27:49.310
so one day my brother is sitting on the couch and he's eating a sandwich and my

1437
01:27:49.311 --> 01:27:53.000
dog sitting there sitting up begging,
you know,
little shit,
little terrier.

1438
01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:57.800
So I start crawling up next to him just going,
hey,
I'm going to get to food.

1439
01:27:57.890 --> 01:28:00.360
I'm going to get the food.
He said,
nick on er,
er,

1440
01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:03.350
he keeps looking over at me and I just kept creeping up going,

1441
01:28:03.351 --> 01:28:04.520
I'm going to get the food.

1442
01:28:04.730 --> 01:28:07.190
And then he started doing like that half a fucking smile.

1443
01:28:07.370 --> 01:28:10.640
Show me his fangs and what?
Laughing.
Laughing.

1444
01:28:10.670 --> 01:28:13.250
That's always do just drive him fucking the same way we do it in my little

1445
01:28:13.251 --> 01:28:17.940
brother just piss him off.
We just fun to watch somebody lose their shit.
And uh,

1446
01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:21.680
the dog was no exception.
And then I don't know what happened.

1447
01:28:21.681 --> 01:28:26.390
I took it too far and he just lunged over to bite me.
And I was,

1448
01:28:26.391 --> 01:28:29.930
my face was at his face,
his level,

1449
01:28:29.931 --> 01:28:33.890
and he just grabbed me on the same side,
same side.

1450
01:28:33.891 --> 01:28:35.270
When my brother threw me off the porch,

1451
01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:39.860
he fucking sunk in just below my eye into my cheek.

1452
01:28:39.861 --> 01:28:44.570
And then one of his lower canines was actually inside my mouth and he had my

1453
01:28:44.571 --> 01:28:49.571
entire fucking left cheek and he went like that.

1454
01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:55.310
And he knew we fucked up too because he's getting me on the leg and he didn't

1455
01:28:55.311 --> 01:28:57.500
give a fuck.
Boy when he did that,
when he was like,
oh shit,

1456
01:28:57.890 --> 01:29:01.830
that's easily a 10 minute misconduct if not in fucking game suspension.

1457
01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:07.020
Um,
yeah.
And that was a,
it was a,
that was a rough walk into the bathroom.

1458
01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:11.370
I remember that.
I get hurt.
It kind of felt like a,
I was just like a,

1459
01:29:11.371 --> 01:29:14.640
I was worried I was going to be deformed.
So that was the thing.

1460
01:29:14.641 --> 01:29:16.290
Like I was going to look in the mirror,
I was like,
oh my God,

1461
01:29:16.291 --> 01:29:17.124
am I going to look like a,

1462
01:29:18.030 --> 01:29:21.010
like someone who just got bitten and faced by a fucking terrier and somehow I

1463
01:29:21.011 --> 01:29:24.000
did.
He kinda,
they were like puncture wounds.

1464
01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:28.320
I still see him and I'm looking in the mirror right now.
It kind of faded away,

1465
01:29:28.990 --> 01:29:32.250
but that the one on my upper lip,
I don't fucking know.

1466
01:29:32.370 --> 01:29:35.190
But then I had to go to my dad's office and he was already working on other

1467
01:29:35.191 --> 01:29:38.670
people.
So he was pissed and it was also embarrassing.

1468
01:29:38.671 --> 01:29:40.710
The next day when I went to school,
you know,

1469
01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:44.740
face is all bruised up and I had stitches were having,
he faced and I was like,

1470
01:29:44.741 --> 01:29:48.990
God,
I got bit by a dog who's dog?
Oh my dog.
And like,

1471
01:29:48.991 --> 01:29:52.620
did you get rid of it now?
Why not?

1472
01:29:52.621 --> 01:29:57.390
Because my family is fucked in the head.
What do you think?

1473
01:29:58.830 --> 01:30:01.630
You know,
dogs aren't supposed to do with that shit.
They supposed to,
you know,

1474
01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:05.790
chase frisbees and be skipping along with you as you walked back from catching

1475
01:30:05.791 --> 01:30:09.270
catfish.
Right.
And that's supposed to bite you in the fucking face,
but you know,

1476
01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:13.590
I deserve to.
So there you go.
There's my scar stories for the week.

1477
01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:17.460
Um,
I didn't get a chance to get to underrated overrated this week.

1478
01:30:17.490 --> 01:30:19.950
I'll just add to them next week we'll have a giant,

1479
01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:24.060
we'll have a bonus section of underrated overrated because there was some really

1480
01:30:24.061 --> 01:30:27.660
good ones this week.
And,
uh,
and that is it.
Um,

1481
01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.430
what do I got?
What?
I got a hyper real quick.
Oh,
please.
Uh,

1482
01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:34.710
please come see me at the Improv in Houston,
Texas.

1483
01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:40.710
Go to Improv,
the number two.com or you can click on the link.

1484
01:30:40.711 --> 01:30:43.650
Went on my homepage and Boston.

1485
01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:48.840
I am a big trip back to Boston in February 6th and I'm not trying to be a

1486
01:30:48.841 --> 01:30:53.740
cheeseball here,
but tickets are fucking,
they're selling like hotcakes

1487
01:30:55.250 --> 01:30:59.580
in such a ridiculous fucking statement that's selling like hotcakes really.

1488
01:31:01.050 --> 01:31:02.400
Who came up with that?
You know,

1489
01:31:02.670 --> 01:31:05.400
you know what I'm having and I'm every going to try to explore that comedically.

1490
01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:10.110
Cause that is just such a hacky,
like want to be Jerry Seinfeld fucking bit,

1491
01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:13.960
you know,
someone like hardcore drugs or what's the deal with Glenn?

1492
01:31:14.130 --> 01:31:18.930
Was there a period?
And
um,

1493
01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:20.970
I like how I said it wasn't going to do that and then I just did it.

1494
01:31:20.971 --> 01:31:23.000
What do you think about that?
You know,

1495
01:31:23.790 --> 01:31:26.190
so right now you guys should just be shutting up the podcast because I've

1496
01:31:26.191 --> 01:31:30.390
obviously established the fact that,
that I'm not a man of my word.

1497
01:31:31.690 --> 01:31:31.970
You know,

1498
01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:35.250
I worked with this comedian Ryan Dalton this weekend and I was going to do

1499
01:31:35.251 --> 01:31:36.990
something.
I really fucked it up.

1500
01:31:38.610 --> 01:31:42.180
I was meaning to try to get some girl to show her tits at the end of the show.

1501
01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:46.470
And we were trying to come up with a way to do it,
you know,

1502
01:31:46.471 --> 01:31:50.130
I was going to do it in a silly way.
Like,
come on man economy's bad,
you know,

1503
01:31:50.131 --> 01:31:53.400
just,
just do it for America.
Just make it silly.
You know,

1504
01:31:53.401 --> 01:31:55.110
there'd be one girl would be willing to do it.

1505
01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:00.520
And then we try and thinking about like reverse psychology,
like a,
you know,

1506
01:32:00.521 --> 01:32:04.450
I've had to,
you know,
keep it going for Ryan.
Any of these need a great comedian,

1507
01:32:04.630 --> 01:32:06.340
I'll tell you.
But he's really bashful off stage.

1508
01:32:06.341 --> 01:32:08.020
And the other night this girl was showing her tits and he,

1509
01:32:08.021 --> 01:32:10.240
he just turned off beat red is one of the funniest,
you know,

1510
01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:15.220
try to fucking make it look like he's not a little fucking creep,
you know,

1511
01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:17.231
you have,

1512
01:32:17.231 --> 01:32:21.460
the reality was was I wanted to see some titties and I was using him as an
excuse

1513
01:32:24.150 --> 01:32:25.840
and I kind of forgot to do that.
You know,

1514
01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.590
I was really upset with myself because if I,
I,
if I miss a joke,

1515
01:32:29.591 --> 01:32:32.530
I forget to do a joke.
I don't give a fuck of a how do the joke next show.

1516
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:37.570
But you know,
when you miss out on titties,
you know that one sticks with you.

1517
01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:41.290
All right?
That's it.
That's the podcast for this week.
Thank you for listening.

1518
01:32:41.291 --> 01:32:45.910
As always.
Uh,
everybody have a great week and a wow.

1519
01:32:45.911 --> 01:32:50.590
My Christmas,
he's fucking dead.
This thing is fucking dead.
Cold,

1520
01:32:50.591 --> 01:32:53.740
dry and brittle.
This thing is,
sorry,
buddy.

1521
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:55.720
Christmas is over.

1522
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:56.663
<v 1>All right.</v>

1523
01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:22.603
Yeah,

1524
01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:56.520
the
long

1525
01:34:04.150 --> 01:34:08.150
time.
About two weeks.
Same

1526
01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:11.923
time.

1527
