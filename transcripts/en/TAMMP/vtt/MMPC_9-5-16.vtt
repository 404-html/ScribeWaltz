1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.880
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill bird.

2
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:05.970
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:10.240
September 5th,
2016 what's going on now?
Why?
Yeah.

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.630
Uh,
sorry,
the podcast is so late today.
Uh,
that's a lie.
I'm not sorry.

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.350
I'm full is what I am.
I went to a Labor Day party,
you know,

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.550
I had to make a fucking pie,
you know,
it's what I do.
They go,
hey,
you know,

7
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:27.720
bring something,
do this,
do that,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And I said,
Hi man,
I'll fucking,

8
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.460
I'll bring 'em.
I'll make a fucking pie.
And uh,

9
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.830
<v 1>yeah,</v>

10
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.950
<v 0>I was doing that this morning and then the thing started at noon and I went over</v>

11
00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:41.240
there and uh,
had been doing so well with my diet last week.

12
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.890
I W I told you it was almost one 90.

13
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:47.891
It was 189.8 I need to get down to a buck 71 72 for my special on October 21st.

14
00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:55.200
So I stepped on the scale yesterday and die even though the way in was,
uh,

15
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.400
for Tuesday.
By Tuesday I wanted to be down to one 86.

16
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.560
But I was a one 85.6 by Sunday.

17
00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:06.590
So the first week you always do a big drop.
You can drop like three,

18
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:11.530
four pounds just because your body so fucking shocked.
Like,
Oh my God,
Salad,

19
00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:12.470
what the hell is this?
You know,

20
00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:15.770
and you throw a little bit of cardio when it you can drop.
But now this week,

21
00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:20.150
this week is the week you bought my body goes like,
oh,
so we're doing this now.

22
00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:24.140
Okay.
And then,
then it starts to slow down.
So,
um,

23
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.620
I really got to go hard.
So I got down to one 86,

24
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:32.240
one 85.6 made it by four ounces.
And um,

25
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.930
so next week I gotta be one 83.
That's it.
I just keep going.
One eight,

26
00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:42.550
three one 81 77,
one 74,
one 71 and then I should have like a week to go.

27
00:01:42.551 --> 00:01:46.900
And as long as I'm not a fucking moron,
um,
I won't look like fucking belly fat,

28
00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:50.680
tits,
all my special in between specials,
you know,
what are you going to do?

29
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.030
But yeah,
that's one of the good things about doing a special every,
every,

30
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:58.890
every two years.
Man,
I get in shape.
So anyways,

31
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:02.790
I went to this party today and it was just like,
ah,
so fucking late.

32
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:04.020
Everything laid out right.

33
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:05.910
And then in the other room they had the salads and that's,

34
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:09.630
if I saw those I would've gone for him cause I was in such a good head space.

35
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.940
I had my eggs with my fucking oatmeal,

36
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.920
I had a grapefruit for fucking snack on my body was not,
was just like,
well good,

37
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.700
well good.
Well not craving sugar,
not crave and salt.
And I went in there,

38
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.550
the salads were in the other Roman right out in the open.
They had,

39
00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:25.410
they had burgers,
they had dogs,

40
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:28.680
they had a Nacho making machine and old freckles hit it.
Dow.

41
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.570
I hit every gate and every station.

42
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.340
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

43
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.650
<v 0>What in there?
Like ric flair.
Woo.</v>

44
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.040
Just fucking ate them all stead voice in the back of your head,
sadly.

45
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.090
What are you doing?
Stop.
And I just couldn't stop.
What do you want?

46
00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:45.760
Something to drink?
You know,
we got waters,
we've got beer.
We got over here,

47
00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:48.370
what do you want?
What do you want us?
And I'm thinking,
drink of water.

48
00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:52.960
My mouth just goes,
ah,
yeah,
try a beer.
So I had a beer,
then I had a root beer.

49
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.350
Then I had a little this banana cream pie.

50
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.090
Then of course I had to cut no my Pi because nobody was fucking eaten it.

51
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.700
That happens a lot,
by the way.

52
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.220
You know there's that thing when you become an adult and you've just complete,

53
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.550
you've completely lost all sense of who the fuck you are.

54
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.770
You know you're in a relationship.
You just fucking busy.
24 seven you got bills,

55
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.800
your kitchen's fucked up.
You know what I mean?

56
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.290
You don't even know what you're doing anymore.
You're putting on weight.

57
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.500
The one thing that you have as a fucking adult is that you go to a party,

58
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:29.980
you make some food,
and you just sit there hoping somebody's going to eat it.

59
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.270
Say It's good and validates your fucking existence.

60
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.190
You know nobody,
nobody dug into the pie.
And then there's,
then there's tricks.

61
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.970
There's tricks.
What you do is when nobody's looking,
you dig into your own shit,

62
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.910
right?
You're trying to position to a place where other people could see it.

63
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.630
You know,
when you dig into your own pie or your own fucking souffle,

64
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:52.510
whatever the fuck he made.
Right.
Hoping that,
you know,

65
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.200
it's like when you're at an auction,
you know,
and you're selling a car,

66
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:57.460
nobody's bidding on it.
You know,

67
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:00.790
there are people that will actually bid on their own car trying to get people

68
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:05.740
going.
Did your prime the pump,
you're playing a little fucker.
Nah.
Yeah.

69
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:09.220
You playing little gambling.
Oh,
I'm laying it down.
That's how fucking,

70
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.990
how much I ate today.

71
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.740
Lay it down on the fucking floor like a God damn freckled dog.

72
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.210
Um,
yeah,
so then people finally dug into it.

73
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.760
A cross was great as always,
but I don't know if the,

74
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:26.050
if the blueberries weren't worth fucking right or if I didn't use enough sugar.

75
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.870
You know,
this one called for like lemon zest.

76
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:31.150
I felt like they should've been lemon juice in there.

77
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.190
There was just way too fucking tart though.

78
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.490
So I guess the lemon juice wouldn't have helped.
It needed something else.

79
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:38.770
So I got to tell you,
it needs something else.
Oh,

80
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.310
you should've seen the pie crust though.
The whole upstairs,
downstairs.

81
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:43.660
You know anybody can,

82
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:47.470
you know the downstairs one is hard enough when we tried to make that top pie

83
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:52.210
crust to meet the other one.
Oh that is a shit show.

84
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.110
That is a fucking shit show waiting to happen the first few times I made it

85
00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:58.430
there would always like split at the top and then you just,

86
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.290
you want it to be totally smooth,
right?

87
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:05.430
Cause you can't peek if you fuck up the bottom and no one sees it because you've

88
00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:06.011
got to fill in.

89
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:09.160
But if you fuck up the top one that some people know if you're an expert or

90
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:12.850
you're intermediate or you suck.
And this one actually came out great.

91
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.340
And uh,
and then of course the feeling wasn't that good.
But uh,

92
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.930
if you had a little scoop of ice cream with that,
it was fine.
So embarrassing.

93
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.240
I had to go fucking eat my own pie.
No,

94
00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:23.890
actually I mentioned it to the host and it was like,

95
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:26.200
which one's your made you made the blueberry and then he sat down.

96
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.490
He just fucking had it just because I was bringing it up.
He knew it.
He knew it.

97
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.310
I was like the fucking,
you know,

98
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:36.490
I was like the CIC without the date on prom night.
He felt bad.

99
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.550
That's what it was.
It was a sympathy fucking pie.

100
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.540
Slice of pie yards is too fucking weird.
Now talking about pie and ladies,

101
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.940
what do you want from me?
I'm fucking full.

102
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.080
So anyways,
I hope you guys had a great Labor Day weekend.
Um,

103
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.740
I can't believe it's already football season,
just being away for the last month.

104
00:05:56.741 --> 00:06:00.170
It was great.
I missed one whole month of dog day baseball.

105
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:02.210
Now all of a sudden baseball's interesting to me.

106
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:05.150
The Red Sox to fucking read sharks at two games out.

107
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.840
I could probably only name one person on the team.
I know it's big.

108
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:12.290
Poppie's last fucking year.
It's his last month.
I know.
Once he goes,

109
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.480
I don't think I know anybody on the team.

110
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.093
<v 1>Okay.</v>

111
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.440
<v 0>We had the pant at third base,
but I don't even know if he's around anymore.</v>

112
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.560
I think he just left.
He just sorta aid is way out of baseball.

113
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.360
It's very unfortunate thing.
Um,
fucking hilarious to me though,

114
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.250
you know,
cause I didn't pay him.

115
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.210
That's funny to me that he finally got all that fucking money.
He was like,

116
00:06:33.211 --> 00:06:34.730
you know what,
my whole life I was,

117
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.670
I've been broke and I had to eat ramen noodles and all that.

118
00:06:38.671 --> 00:06:43.050
Now they just paid me enough money,
even if I never play again,
fuck this.

119
00:06:43.051 --> 00:06:44.760
And he just goes out each house down.

120
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.860
But um,
I didn't even know that was fuck,
I'm so out of the loop over here.

121
00:06:50.861 --> 00:06:54.310
I didn't even realize that it was a college football season and I was driving

122
00:06:54.311 --> 00:06:57.040
down the highway,
you know,
I was driving,

123
00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:59.590
I was going to go fly and um,

124
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.460
I just saw in the billboard,
so USC,
Alabama,
and I get the fuck Outta here.

125
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.170
USC and Alabama.
Those are two teams that I have rooted against Alabama.

126
00:07:10.171 --> 00:07:12.840
Just lately,
once I jumped on Ellis shoes bandwagon,

127
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.070
of course after they won a national championship and that's when I decided to

128
00:07:17.071 --> 00:07:18.720
jump on when I first moved out here and,
uh,

129
00:07:18.721 --> 00:07:22.190
finally had time to watch college football and still do a set at night.
Uh,

130
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.200
but I've been rooting against USC forever because I was a Notre Dame fan growing

131
00:07:27.541 --> 00:07:32.290
up.
And,
um,
I don't know.
It just says,
see,
I don't know what it was.
They were just,

132
00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:36.550
were,
were I always root against like the best team saying like everybody roots

133
00:07:36.551 --> 00:07:38.560
against the Patriots.
I get it.
You know what I mean?

134
00:07:38.561 --> 00:07:40.630
I know you think were cheaters.
Yeah,
yeah.
Whatever.

135
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.370
Go Watch some of that Oakland Raiders Shit that hit on Lynn Swann where he just

136
00:07:45.371 --> 00:07:47.170
fucking want even given all of that,

137
00:07:47.171 --> 00:07:49.710
got all of that guys hits whatever his fucking name was.

138
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.960
Can't remember his fucking name.
He's like,
yeah,
we used to intimidate people.

139
00:07:52.961 --> 00:07:53.471
It's like you're,

140
00:07:53.471 --> 00:07:56.770
you're just punching someone when they're not looking in the side of the fucking

141
00:07:56.771 --> 00:08:01.710
head.
Um,

142
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:06.260
anyways.
Anyways,
forget about having steroids delivered to your wife.
Um,

143
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.820
but anyways,
so I've always rooted against teams like that.
And uh,

144
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.670
back when they had Charles White,
right through Marcus Allen and everything,

145
00:08:12.671 --> 00:08:15.580
I used to always rooted against those guys.
And,
uh,

146
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.160
and of course lately I've been rooting against Alabama for the last five,

147
00:08:18.161 --> 00:08:20.890
six years just because it's fun.
And,
um,

148
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.230
now they're both playing each other and I was just like,

149
00:08:23.231 --> 00:08:24.850
who the fuck am I going to root for?

150
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:26.830
So watch the beginning of the game and you know,

151
00:08:26.831 --> 00:08:29.200
this show in the highlight of USC coming out,

152
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.740
like do a bunch of craze dogs right at the end of a fucking you one of those

153
00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:37.210
backyard leash things,
you know,
clothes wired that they're wrong.
Then I'm like,

154
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:39.790
these guys are ramped up.
They're not afraid of the big stage.

155
00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:41.650
They're ready to go.
This is going to be a game.

156
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:44.110
And like for the first couple of USC possessions,
you know,

157
00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:46.630
they sack the quarterback,
they up down the field,

158
00:08:46.631 --> 00:08:49.240
they throw little field goal action.

159
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:55.240
Then they fucking threw that state,
try to that fucking sweep Jesus.

160
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.170
Who the fuck is that?
Cornerback Humphrey,
that guy

161
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:07.330
somebody been at and by somebody I mean us,
we bet a draft.
That guy,

162
00:09:07.331 --> 00:09:12.280
I think he's up for next season.
Sorry,
typing in the pot,
the password ever.

163
00:09:12.281 --> 00:09:17.020
So slowly and there we go.
Marlin Humphrey,
Jesus Christ.

164
00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.500
What a fucking hit.
He came out of nowhere.

165
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.980
They will run in the sweep and I was sitting in Hong gone,

166
00:09:23.981 --> 00:09:26.590
you can't do this against Alabama.
They're going to string it out.

167
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.390
And then the guy tries to cut back inside.

168
00:09:28.391 --> 00:09:31.720
He gets had made me about back outside there,
Fred.

169
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:33.170
<v 2>Okay.</v>

170
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.700
<v 0>Oh,
we took the helmet.
Well sorry.</v>

171
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.610
Blown out years and he took the fucking helmet right out of the Goddamn Shit.

172
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.530
I'm surprised they didn't call it helmet,

173
00:09:39.531 --> 00:09:43.400
the helmet because you get mostly his chest.
And um,

174
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.480
then my wife was downstairs,
you know,

175
00:09:46.481 --> 00:09:49.090
I hadn't spent any time with or whatever and I was just like,
all right,

176
00:09:49.091 --> 00:09:52.900
I'm taping this game.
I'll come back to this in a minute.
And uh,

177
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.470
you know,
whatever.
Went downstairs,
couple hours,
hung out with my wife.

178
00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:02.080
She watched one horrific fucking show after another.
Oh my God.

179
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.210
Oh my God.
The horror,
the horror of what she was watching.

180
00:10:07.211 --> 00:10:09.550
She finally shut it off and then we started watching this,

181
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.710
this series on Netflix.

182
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.630
It was something about these chefs and was all these,
these French cooks.

183
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.011
And uh,

184
00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:22.970
it was great to hear the French language cause I kind of stopped once again,

185
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.530
I was picking up,
you know,

186
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.160
little phrases here or there that made me feel good in these fucking,

187
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.900
these chefs were incredible.
We watched like two or three episodes of it.

188
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.120
Of course,
I don't know what the name of it is,

189
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.310
but it made me want to live in Paris for like fucking three months,
four months,

190
00:10:40.311 --> 00:10:40.611
five,

191
00:10:40.611 --> 00:10:44.510
whatever it would take just to get kind of passable and take a pastry making

192
00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:49.180
class.
I know that sounds like the stupidest thing ever,

193
00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.260
but this fucking guy,

194
00:10:50.261 --> 00:10:52.960
he takes like an apple and he was going like this guy was an artist.

195
00:10:52.961 --> 00:10:54.520
He was just sitting there going like,
you know,

196
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.230
I was so sick of making all these fucking thing.
Hey,

197
00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.900
I had to come up with some new
thing to do with an apple.

198
00:11:01.901 --> 00:11:05.260
And He fucking just imagine if you just kept peeling a thing,
right?

199
00:11:05.261 --> 00:11:08.050
If you would just peeling the skin off but you just kept going all the way down

200
00:11:08.051 --> 00:11:08.884
to the core.

201
00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:13.890
He did that and it was all one piece you did with some hand crank thing and he

202
00:11:14.441 --> 00:11:14.681
said,

203
00:11:14.681 --> 00:11:18.610
I wanted to make a rose out of out of an apple and he somehow did it and turn it

204
00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:22.810
into a dessert.
You fucking chopped a duck in a,

205
00:11:22.811 --> 00:11:25.030
in a chicken in half.
And he sewed them together,

206
00:11:25.031 --> 00:11:30.031
which was very naziesque slash American horror story that kind of creep me out.

207
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.860
And then of course they had to show how they fucking,
they were cooking lobsters,

208
00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:39.950
live lobsters over an open flame.
Could I can show you guys a question.
What,

209
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.010
what are the lobster ever do to us?

210
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.130
<v 2>Okay.</v>

211
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.540
<v 0>Every other animal has the decency of being dead before we fucking least in this</v>

212
00:11:47.541 --> 00:11:48.890
country.
I know other countries,

213
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.180
they got fucking Matt maggots running around their apple jacks for extra
protein.

214
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.960
Know that's like us putting way potter into our shakes.

215
00:11:55.961 --> 00:11:59.410
They put like fucking bugs and stuff,
you know what I mean?

216
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:00.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

217
00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:03.090
<v 0>Like they actually excited that there's bugs in their house.</v>

218
00:12:03.091 --> 00:12:05.400
You know what I mean?
It's like,
it's like the food truck came by,

219
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.330
but in our country,
right.
Like that stuff is like,
it's looked down upon every,

220
00:12:09.331 --> 00:12:12.960
you know,
that's,
that's the great thing about traveling.
You know what I mean?

221
00:12:12.961 --> 00:12:16.170
You just sit there,
oh,
toe cheese.
Oh,
that's a delicacy over here.
You know,

222
00:12:16.171 --> 00:12:19.650
that's one of the wonderful things.
Puts a little spring in your step.

223
00:12:19.651 --> 00:12:21.180
A little twinkle in your eyes.
So anyways,

224
00:12:21.181 --> 00:12:24.360
I'm watching this fucking lunatic and um,

225
00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.520
for the life of me,
I don't know why they just can't.
At least just,

226
00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.970
can you just fucking,
I dunno.

227
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:35.240
Can they make it like a little lobster hammer and just fucking knock,

228
00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:35.901
knock it out.

229
00:12:35.901 --> 00:12:40.010
At least does it have to be squirming on the flame and you have to keep telling

230
00:12:40.011 --> 00:12:43.910
me that it doesn't feel pain.
It doesn't have a central nervous system.

231
00:12:43.911 --> 00:12:46.220
Whatever the fuck they try to say.
It's just like,

232
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.930
like what?
It's like an Amoeba.
It isn't.
Okay.

233
00:12:51.931 --> 00:12:54.330
The fucking things got eyeballs and shit.
It's walking around.

234
00:12:54.331 --> 00:12:56.760
It's got its little tentacles,
what we call it.
Those,

235
00:12:56.761 --> 00:13:00.240
those big fucking thing's coming out.
They can see it,
breathes,

236
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.920
you gotta have paid.
That's part of survival,
right.

237
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.030
Which shows a way to shut it off.
You know what I mean?

238
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.850
Especially with people getting like tortured to death.

239
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.380
You could just shut it off and the guys saw in your hand off,
you're like,

240
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.210
oh yeah,
he's that.
Was that what you're doing?
Um,
Jesus,

241
00:13:18.211 --> 00:13:20.660
I'm all over the map.
I was talking about La fucking Nadella.

242
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:24.480
She always talking about Alabama USC.
Now where the hell am I?
So anyways,

243
00:13:24.481 --> 00:13:27.150
the guy got sick of talking about a week after a while,

244
00:13:27.151 --> 00:13:29.880
he just got sick of the blood of all the animals in the,

245
00:13:29.881 --> 00:13:32.640
and he got three stars over and um,

246
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:33.870
<v 1>okay.</v>

247
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.450
<v 0>In France in three stars is the highest you can get,</v>

248
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.330
which is so fucking Parisian.
You know what I mean?

249
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.810
There's so fucking understated and classy.
I hate to say it is American,

250
00:13:42.811 --> 00:13:47.010
but they really are.
They really earned their snooty fucking behavior over there.

251
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.870
The people that style their clothes,
that they crush it.
You know what I mean?

252
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:56.760
You know Mr t,
we got himself a gold chain and there was this like,
you know what?

253
00:13:56.761 --> 00:14:00.330
One isn't enough.
Let me get fucking 9,000 of them and hang around.

254
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.070
They're the exact opposite of that.

255
00:14:02.071 --> 00:14:05.010
They got like all mode muted colors and then Bam,

256
00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:09.060
a sick ass pair of shoes or a hat or the ladies with their bags,

257
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:14.400
just fucking class.
It's not like,
you know,
it's not like as loud Americans,

258
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:19.260
you know?
But it's good to be loud sometimes.

259
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.610
You know?
I like a fucking muscle car like anybody else.
I like it.

260
00:14:23.611 --> 00:14:26.010
I like the Wendy's triple fucking cheeseburger.

261
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.310
I have it tell you guys that time where I was standing in the line with me and I

262
00:14:29.311 --> 00:14:32.610
just kept making fun of the triple cheeseburger at Wendy's,
just kept going.

263
00:14:32.611 --> 00:14:35.460
Who the fuck would order a triple cheeseburger?
I just kept going,

264
00:14:35.461 --> 00:14:38.700
come get her book and let me get a triple cheeseburger the book.

265
00:14:38.701 --> 00:14:42.000
And I just kept doing their triple cheeseburger and I just kept saying it.

266
00:14:42.001 --> 00:14:45.390
When I went up there,
I wasn't thinking and I just said triple cheeseburger.

267
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.980
And then after I said it,
I was just like,
well fuck it.
I'll,

268
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.900
I'll eat it.
And you know what?
It's delicious.
And I still think about it.

269
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.030
I still remember where I got it.

270
00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:59.480
I was on like Lexington Avenue in New York City or maybe second hour.

271
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:03.130
I was on the east side was the last time I had a triple cheeseburger.
Fuck,

272
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.920
that was like seven,
eight years ago,
nine years ago,
10 maybe.

273
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.530
Um,
anyway,
so the guy just decides out of the fucking blue,

274
00:15:12.531 --> 00:15:15.590
this guy decides is French chef.
I'm back,
I'm back in Paris again.
Okay.

275
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.700
He just decides he's not going to fucking,
he's sick.
All the blood,

276
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.060
gutting all the animals and all of that shit.
He doesn't want to do it anymore.

277
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:28.061
He's just going to go 100% vegetarian at his restaurant and he might lose his

278
00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:32.310
stars
in Parisian cuisine or in France.

279
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:36.570
You lose your stars.
It's like,
it's,
it's like losing your soul.

280
00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.370
And he just made the decision.

281
00:15:38.371 --> 00:15:42.000
He actually went to the board of the people that gives them the stars and just

282
00:15:42.001 --> 00:15:45.120
said,
look,
I'm taking meat off the menu.
I'm just going all vegetarian.

283
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:50.460
And they were like,
are you Outta your mind?
And he goes,
no,
no,
I'm not.

284
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:54.690
I'm just doing vegetarian shit.
And uh,
you know,

285
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.440
do what you want with my stars.
You know,
and I'll leave it at that.

286
00:15:58.441 --> 00:16:01.380
And then you watch the rest of the fuck.
Well,
mostly not going to watch it,
right?

287
00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:01.531
Well,

288
00:16:01.531 --> 00:16:03.990
if then fast forward to the next five minutes because they're going to ruin it

289
00:16:03.991 --> 00:16:08.460
for you.
So he ends up doing it.
He fucking crushes it and he retains his stars.

290
00:16:08.461 --> 00:16:12.480
But then eventually he did bring the meat back because it's such a big fucking

291
00:16:12.481 --> 00:16:15.360
deal.
But he also learned how to crush it with the fucking vegetables.

292
00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.850
But this guy was like a lunatic man.
Like he,

293
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.660
he was like a pro prolific comedian where he just,

294
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.170
once he had his hour a killer shit,
he just,
he just flushed it down.

295
00:16:25.171 --> 00:16:28.920
The toilet shot a special.
Now moving onto the next one.
You know,

296
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.450
I don't know.
I was pretty amazed by it.
But let's get back to,
fuck.

297
00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:34.630
I know I'm all over the place.
Okay.

298
00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.830
My sugar is through the fucking roof right now.
My mouth is dried out.

299
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.250
My body's like,
what the fuck?
And after it.
Now,

300
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.750
not only do I have my body in this level of shock,

301
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.600
I'm actually in about a two hours.
When my stomach's settles,

302
00:16:45.601 --> 00:16:47.460
I'm going to do my 45 minutes of cardio.

303
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.480
I'm just gonna try to like salvage some sort of,
you know,

304
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.470
like if this was a football game,
I'm down by 20.
But like,
I'm just at this point,

305
00:16:55.471 --> 00:16:59.080
like I don't want to lose by 25.
That's,
that's all I'm doing here.
Okay.

306
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:00.263
<v 3>MMM.</v>

307
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.890
<v 0>And then I go on the fucking road,
right?
I got a Gig in long island on Wednesday,</v>

308
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.240
and then Charlotte and then

309
00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:08.980
<v 3>no,
Columbia,</v>

310
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.850
<v 0>Charleston,
South Carolina,
and then Charlotte.
And then I got two cities,</v>

311
00:17:12.851 --> 00:17:16.330
Richmond and,
uh,
somewhere else in fucking Virginia.

312
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.620
And then I come back on Monday.

313
00:17:17.621 --> 00:17:22.140
So this is going to be the big test and I'm on the road.
All right.

314
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.390
I gotta make sure I'm not going to be fucking eating like an asshole.

315
00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:30.160
I got to find elliptical machines and four or five different goddamn cities and

316
00:17:30.161 --> 00:17:33.280
you know,
every fucking hotel.
Do you have a gym?
Yeah,
we have a gym.

317
00:17:33.281 --> 00:17:34.310
It's on the fourth floor.

318
00:17:34.311 --> 00:17:37.630
And you go down there and they have like a fucking treadmill that they bought in

319
00:17:37.631 --> 00:17:42.580
like 1978.
You know,
if there's a picture like bill Rogers on the side,

320
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.840
he won the Boston marathon a couple of times in the late 70.

321
00:17:45.841 --> 00:17:47.190
[inaudible] you know,
back when,
uh,

322
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:51.330
I think it was before Kenyans were to run in marathons because once they let the

323
00:17:51.331 --> 00:17:53.040
Kenyans run,
that's,
that's been it.

324
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.850
I can't remember the last time there was like Angel Salazar,

325
00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.460
I think that was his name at Bill Rogers.

326
00:18:00.461 --> 00:18:02.500
And they would fucking win every one of them,
it seemed.

327
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.620
And then what's the Kenyans came and then that was,

328
00:18:05.621 --> 00:18:10.621
it was fucking over talking like a 36 year run at this point.

329
00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:17.800
So anyways,
um,
I'm finally going to finish this so that I have five finally.

330
00:18:17.801 --> 00:18:21.910
Um,
oh,
I went down to the comedy store and I did a,
I did a set.

331
00:18:21.911 --> 00:18:25.540
So I was just like,
did anybody see the end?
What was the final,

332
00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.280
all the Alabama SC game?
I shut it off when USC was up three to nothing.

333
00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:35.860
So he told me it was like 51 to six Alabama came back in the old right there,

334
00:18:35.861 --> 00:18:39.100
Fred.
So I,
uh,
I watched some of the highlights,

335
00:18:39.101 --> 00:18:42.490
but I'm telling you that fucking cornerback,
Jesus Christ,

336
00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.120
Jesus Christ,
he would make a great Pittsburgh stealer.

337
00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.670
He would make a great New York giant.
You know,

338
00:18:52.671 --> 00:18:56.410
there's teams that just always have great defenses.
You know,

339
00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.060
if we sign them,
we'll keep them right until he makes a pro bowl.

340
00:19:01.061 --> 00:19:06.061
And then we'll let him go and then I'll end up going to the jets or somebody,

341
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.680
the bills or the dolphins.
Not only will you let him go,

342
00:19:08.681 --> 00:19:10.390
he'll sign in our fucking division.

343
00:19:10.391 --> 00:19:13.750
But I hope we get that guy or get somebody like,
I mean,

344
00:19:13.751 --> 00:19:16.750
granted what he did was at the collegiate level,
but it was really impressive.

345
00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:20.530
He shut down.
Um,
whoever uscs guy was,

346
00:19:20.531 --> 00:19:22.380
I don't know shit about college football the same way.

347
00:19:22.381 --> 00:19:26.110
I don't know shit about fucking formula one racing.
I don't know shit.

348
00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.870
I just talk.
All right.
Um,

349
00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.760
he shut down like I guess their Dez Bryant Level Guy.

350
00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.730
Guy had one catch for like nine yards from the third quarter.

351
00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:41.470
He intercepted a pass for like,
uh,
for a touchdown.
I mean like he just,

352
00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.890
it was it you just looking at the guy and then he came up and shut down the

353
00:19:44.891 --> 00:19:47.500
fucking sweep,
put that guy on his ass.

354
00:19:47.501 --> 00:19:50.770
And that's the kind of guy that's the kind of guy you're white up.
Jesus.

355
00:19:50.771 --> 00:19:53.890
He's a comedian.
He knows how to build a football team now.
Anyways.

356
00:19:53.891 --> 00:19:56.680
Do you guys watch any of the Formula One race and I've gotten any you guys into

357
00:19:56.681 --> 00:20:01.660
that shit?
Uh,
what's his face?
Lewis Hamilton.

358
00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.930
I don't understand.
How do they fuck up the start of the race?

359
00:20:04.931 --> 00:20:09.550
The guys in the pole position and all of a sudden they turn into like these

360
00:20:09.551 --> 00:20:10.890
funds.
Do you ever like learn how to,

361
00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.810
the first time you learned to drive a clutch,
you let out the clutch too fast.

362
00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:15.610
You don't give it enough throttle and you'll stall.

363
00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.900
It's like they do that except in front of a zillion people around the world

364
00:20:19.901 --> 00:20:23.860
watching it.
This guy was in first place by the time they got to the first turn,

365
00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:27.790
Lewis Hamilton,
the champion.
Okay.

366
00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.650
The fucking guy was in sixth place.

367
00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.790
Nico Rosberg took the lead a never gave it back,

368
00:20:33.791 --> 00:20:37.270
but it was a great fucking race.
Um,
Jesus Christ,

369
00:20:37.271 --> 00:20:41.230
the Italian fans were going crazy.
Fucking crazy.

370
00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:45.820
Just willing Ferrari to get to the podium,
which is the first three.

371
00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.250
And that sport,
which I think also in the Olympics,

372
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.930
they're all starting to run together.
They,
uh,
they got third and fourth place.

373
00:20:52.931 --> 00:20:56.950
So they made the podium and those Italian people went fucking bananas.

374
00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:02.170
Fuck.
Even if the announcers are going,
can you imagine if they actually won?
Uh,

375
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.260
but it was a,
it was a great race.
Whatever.

376
00:21:05.261 --> 00:21:09.220
I still don't understand the soft super soft,
the medium tires,

377
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.690
that's all the one I'm really starting to understand is that when you pit and

378
00:21:13.691 --> 00:21:18.691
what tire you are using evidently is like one of the biggest things in the race

379
00:21:19.271 --> 00:21:21.820
because I don't know whoever,

380
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:26.590
whoever fucking makes it into the first turn first they win the race.

381
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.930
Every fucking race I've watched,
it's,

382
00:21:29.931 --> 00:21:32.890
it's a race from the starting line to the first turn.

383
00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:36.070
Whoever comes out in front that's fucking it over.

384
00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:37.380
You've won the race and then the,

385
00:21:37.381 --> 00:21:39.870
then the whole battles for second through fucking sixth,

386
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.600
and then he's holding a super soft about this.

387
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.980
You know,
Ricky Bobby's on the mediums now.

388
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.070
Those are a little bit heavier,

389
00:21:50.071 --> 00:21:52.770
but he's going to be able to stay out there for another 23 fucking laps or

390
00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:53.790
whatever the hell's going on.

391
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:56.400
And I really try to pay attention to figure out what's going on,

392
00:21:56.401 --> 00:21:59.790
but I can't quite figure it out.
I guess with the super soft,

393
00:21:59.791 --> 00:22:02.700
they tear up quicker because I know what that one fucking car,

394
00:22:02.701 --> 00:22:05.360
what the hell is it called?
The,
the,
uh,
the one that,

395
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.110
the pet fastest production car,

396
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:12.870
it basically can go like 220 miles an hour.
But you know,

397
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:16.010
it can drive like 220 miles an hour.

398
00:22:16.011 --> 00:22:21.011
But at that speed you'll literally where the tires off in like 15 minutes.

399
00:22:21.231 --> 00:22:25.580
But that's okay because you run out of gas and like 13,
how fucked up is that?

400
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:27.660
So maybe the super soft.

401
00:22:27.661 --> 00:22:31.370
So I like that if anybody has any information because I'm going to keep fucking

402
00:22:31.371 --> 00:22:35.420
watching it.
They're in Singapore next,
they're done with Europe,

403
00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:41.150
they're going over to Singapore now,
which I'm looking forward to because I'm,

404
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:43.403
you know,

405
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.980
when they go start traveling around Southeast Asia and they're going to like

406
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.920
Japan and all that,

407
00:22:46.921 --> 00:22:49.710
like that's a part of the world that really interests me because,
you know,
I've,

408
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.760
I've only,
I went there one time but it was only for a few days.
And uh,

409
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:55.260
<v 2>yeah,</v>

410
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.670
<v 0>I don't know.
That's one of the cool things that,</v>

411
00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.740
one of the things I really do enjoy about that sport.

412
00:22:58.741 --> 00:23:01.200
And I guess I wish I could get into soccer man,

413
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.440
cause I know that they go all the way around the world.
You know,

414
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.180
maybe that's why I let people are good at geography.

415
00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:10.110
They watch actual world sports,
you know?

416
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.360
And if you actually win a world championship,

417
00:23:12.361 --> 00:23:16.590
you competed against the fucking world.
Does that make sense?
All right,

418
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.420
I'm going to shut up now.
Let's,
uh,
while I'm out,

419
00:23:18.421 --> 00:23:20.530
I'm going to read some advertising.
Um,

420
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:23.260
I hope this podcast is making sense by the way,
because,
uh,

421
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.400
I literally feel like I could take a Thanksgiving Day nap right now.

422
00:23:26.401 --> 00:23:30.720
I don't know what the fuck I was doing.
I had a burger,
I had a fucking hot dog,

423
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.070
Nachos,
beer,
root beer,
trying to go through my head.
I just lost count.

424
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.690
I just was like,
what the fuck are you doing?
Oh,
Billy fat.

425
00:23:38.691 --> 00:23:42.330
It's a all right dollar shave club,
everybody.
I was like Bluto in animal house.

426
00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.100
All right.
Dollar Shave Club.

427
00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:45.300
<v 1>Okay</v>

428
00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.500
<v 0>guys,
I appreciate</v>

429
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.020
<v 4>you listening to the show.
And,
uh,</v>

430
00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:51.750
and wanted to do something to thank you.

431
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.800
So I contacted my friends@dollarshaveclub.com and arrange for them to give new

432
00:23:58.621 --> 00:24:03.621
net members a month of the executive razor for free just for buying a tube of Dr

433
00:24:04.571 --> 00:24:08.230
cabbies.
Easy shave butter.
I did nothing like that.

434
00:24:08.231 --> 00:24:11.590
I've never talked to those people.
I would not call them.

435
00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:12.960
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

436
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.070
<v 4>Why do they write shit like that?
Do you guys really whoa.</v>

437
00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:18.000
Well look at Billy's really going the extra mile for us.

438
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.490
Whatever the fuck they they give you.

439
00:24:20.491 --> 00:24:23.790
They made that decision and then I just read it.
Um,

440
00:24:23.791 --> 00:24:26.790
evidently I'm super excited that they're doing it for you.

441
00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:30.060
Now let me remind you why me.

442
00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:34.500
Millions of others have joined as me as a proud member of the club,

443
00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.770
<v 0>not a member of the club.</v>

444
00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:40.900
Anything that involves going online and registering for shit,
I,

445
00:24:40.901 --> 00:24:44.620
I won't do it.
I won't do it because I can't figure it out.

446
00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.750
It takes too long.
I have to call somebody.
It's like,
it's like dad,

447
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.480
who wants to be a millionaire,
right.
You know what I mean?

448
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.110
One of the worst fucking shows of all time.
Who wants to be a millionaire?

449
00:24:57.111 --> 00:25:00.170
And then like the people were so fucking dumb on that they had to call their

450
00:25:00.171 --> 00:25:04.220
friends like halfway through.
Like,
can you help me out?
You know what I mean?

451
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:06.760
That doesn't happen on jeopardy.

452
00:25:06.761 --> 00:25:10.210
That doesn't even happen on fucking wheel of fortune prices.
Right.
You know,

453
00:25:10.211 --> 00:25:12.600
you kind of look out to the crowd and everyday

454
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:13.603
<v 4>Zigler,</v>

455
00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:23.010
<v 0>I don't know.
Anyways,
um,
let's get back to this shit here.
All right,</v>

456
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.600
you,
you get the first class,

457
00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.510
you get a first class shave when you use the executive blade,

458
00:25:27.511 --> 00:25:29.160
and that's without even hurting your wallet.

459
00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:33.210
And when you use the executive with their Dr Carver's shave butter,

460
00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.720
the blade gently glides across for the smoothest shave.
Yeah,

461
00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:41.510
<v 4>Abba shave butter isn't your average shave cream.
Ah,</v>

462
00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.940
what's made out a death of deals and baby buts.

463
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:48.230
It's a unique conditioning formula with high quality natural ingredients,

464
00:25:48.231 --> 00:25:52.800
leaving your skin unbelievably soft and smooth.
Now's a great time to,

470
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:12.470
<v 4>oh look who's back everybody.
But Oh boop,
boop me undies.</v>

471
00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.860
Mandy's making up blueberry Pie Badu due to me undies.

472
00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:21.900
Biondi keep eating and you don't know why and all of a sudden your balls are at

473
00:26:22.381 --> 00:26:25.560
your feet,
but they feel real comfortable.
And that's real neat.

474
00:26:25.561 --> 00:26:28.560
Cause when you were fucking me undies.
Yeah,

475
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.970
they fucking put your nuts in a hammock or maybe your twat.

476
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.750
Now when Pfos,

477
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.920
those beef fucking cartons,
all right,
Mandy's,

478
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.760
whether you're wearing a suit

479
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:48.540
<v 0>or sweats,
you spend almost 24 hours a day in your underwear.</v>

480
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:53.600
But instead of making a statement like Superman's tights under his everyday

481
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:57.780
clothes,
your,
your underwear is probably boring me.

482
00:26:57.781 --> 00:27:02.710
UNDIES is here to help change that.
Um,
please include modal.
All right.

483
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.120
Every player of me undies is made with from sustainable sources.

484
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.700
Madell of fabric that's twice as soft as cotton.

485
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.150
Nothing can describe the fit and feel of me undies.

486
00:27:12.151 --> 00:27:15.120
You got to feel it up against your balls.
You,
yourself.

487
00:27:15.121 --> 00:27:17.910
I could try to explain it to you.
Okay.

488
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.300
But it'd be like somebody trying to explain that first hit of heroin.

489
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:22.740
You know what I mean?
You know,

490
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.500
they always say it's like being held in your mother's arms.

491
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.990
It's like being held in your mother's arms.
Well,

492
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:31.770
what if you came from a family and they weren't huggers?
You know what I mean?

493
00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:33.540
Now you might as well just be saying like,

494
00:27:33.541 --> 00:27:36.960
it's like the first time you drive a Lamborghini.
I never drove.

495
00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:39.570
Uh,
once you try them on,

496
00:27:39.571 --> 00:27:43.830
you understand why they're called the world's world's world's most comfortable

497
00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:48.750
underwear.
And if you don't love your first pair of me undies,
they're free.

498
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.570
No questions asked me.
UNDIES has dozens of,
of course it is.

499
00:27:51.571 --> 00:27:52.710
What are you going to give it back to them?

500
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:56.790
You already walked around farting in it and God knows what else.

501
00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:59.550
Shook your dick off.
And then the rest of it dried up in there.

502
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.160
No questions asked me.

503
00:28:01.161 --> 00:28:05.520
And he says dozens of styles and limited edition prints to help you make a

504
00:28:05.521 --> 00:28:09.270
statement with your underwear,
whether anyone can see them or not.
Remember,

505
00:28:09.271 --> 00:28:13.410
Superman,
a shipping is free and the U S and Canada.

506
00:28:13.411 --> 00:28:17.610
And you can save up to $8 a pair with the [inaudible] subscription plan.

507
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:21.390
Get the subscription or a single pair.
Uh,

508
00:28:21.391 --> 00:28:24.680

509
00:28:24.681 --> 00:28:29.190
[inaudible] that's [inaudible] dot com slash burr for 20% off your first order.

510
00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:34.800
[inaudible] dot com slash bar how many more fucking things we got here?

511
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:41.240
Three.
Four.
No,
no,
no.
Those are the reeds.

512
00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:48.860
All right,
two more.
Two more.
Sorry everybody.
Sorry.
It's the fucking sugar.
Um,

513
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:53.070
or blue apron.
Everyone.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
Speaking of food,
you know,

514
00:28:53.071 --> 00:28:57.840
not all ingredients are created equal.
Okay?
Jesus,

515
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:02.850
separate but equal is very racist here.
This is for food,
Huh?
Uh,

516
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:05.280
this is like reverse America.
Fresh,

517
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:08.940
high quality ingredients taste better and better and are better for you.

518
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.550
So it's important to know where your food comes from.

519
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:17.310
Talk about your personal experiences with blue apron.
Oh,
I've never used it.

520
00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:21.660
So you know,
it looks fucking great on the commercial.
Jesus Christ,

521
00:29:21.661 --> 00:29:22.560
they got a good commercial.

522
00:29:22.561 --> 00:29:26.610
You see that one where the guy's got the Thai noodles?
Fucking unbelievable.

523
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:30.120
Then at the end they show like the silhouette and you could see is get a blow

524
00:29:30.121 --> 00:29:32.040
Joe.
It's just like,
wow,
these guys are really,

525
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.750
they're really claiming a lot with this food.
Uh
Oh,

526
00:29:37.751 --> 00:29:40.290
maybe it fell asleep watching cinema,
I don't know.
Uh,

527
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.830
for less than dollars per meal,

528
00:29:41.831 --> 00:29:44.970
Blue Apron delivers seasonal recipes along with pre,

529

533
00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:02.500
suppliers,
family run farms,
fisheries and ranchers,

534
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:04.810
whether it's Japanese ramen noodles,

535
00:30:04.811 --> 00:30:07.480
wild caught Alaskan salmon are heirloom tomatoes.

536
00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:10.060
Blue Apron is bringing you the best.

537
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:14.740
New recipes are created weekly and are not repeated within a year.

538
00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:19.210
That's incredible.
Choose your meals from,
from a variety of recipes,

539
00:30:19.211 --> 00:30:21.600
or let blue apron culinary team surprise.
You know,

540
00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:25.480
if I had a fucking marketing bone in my body,

541
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.170
also,
if I wasn't on the road up until my special,

542
00:30:29.171 --> 00:30:33.820
I would just eat fucking blue apron every God damn night and workout,

543
00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:37.420
right?
I tell him to send me this shit for free.

544
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.990
I'll keep hyping them and I'll give them the credit for me losing weight,

545
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:44.380
you know,
rather than I'm going down to the elliptical every day,

546
00:30:44.381 --> 00:30:47.800
sweating like a fucking junkie in a holding cell.
Uh,
anyways,

547
00:30:47.801 --> 00:30:50.650
customize your recipes each week based on your preferences.

548

Choose delivery options to fit your needs.
There's no weekly commitment,

549
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:56.980
so you only get deliveries when you want them,
which is great.

558
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:23.750
I swear to God I could really fucking,

<v 0>I'm actually thinking about doing it cause you know,</v>

561

You know,
I'm always,

562
00:31:31.121 --> 00:31:34.120
I'm always too intimidated.
Like there's,
there's all these places out here,

563
00:31:34.121 --> 00:31:36.400
Korea town,
Thai town,
Chinatown,
all of that.

564
00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:39.490
And I always look into their markets and everything and I'm just so fucking

565
00:31:39.491 --> 00:31:42.610
intimidated because I don't know what any of this shit is,
you know?

566
00:31:42.611 --> 00:31:44.170
I don't know what the fuck's going on.
You know?

567
00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:47.830
Then when you were in like Chinatown and like a San Francisco,

568
00:31:47.831 --> 00:31:48.760
they got all this stuff,

569
00:31:48.761 --> 00:31:52.450
but then you see like a whole duck just hanging by his neck and he's just like,

570
00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.330
oh my God.
You know,

571
00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:57.700
you start thinking about Vietnam movies that you watched and you know the deer

572
00:31:57.701 --> 00:32:00.190
hunter and then all of a sudden you'd start sweating and you get out of there

573
00:32:00.191 --> 00:32:02.860
and next thing you know you're eating a cheeseburger when you should've got a

574
00:32:02.861 --> 00:32:06.790
burrito.
You're in San Francisco.
All right,
score big everybody.

575
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:08.610
<v 2>Okay.</v>

576
00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:11.850
<v 0>You're paying too much for tickets between all the markups.</v>

577
00:32:11.851 --> 00:32:14.970
Last minute convenient charges,
even printing home fees,

578
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.740
you end up paying court side prices for nose bleed,
bleed,
bleed seats.
Sorry.

579
00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.290
Scorebig is here to change that.
Guys,

580
00:32:22.291 --> 00:32:24.570
I don't know about this company to be honest with you.

581
00:32:24.571 --> 00:32:26.970
I think this is just another fucking scalping site.

582
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:28.530
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

583
00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:31.080
<v 0>You know,
I think what they're claiming they end up doing.</v>

584
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:35.940
Did you know that 40% of all live event tickets go on?
Sold that?
No,

585
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.680
that's not true.
That is not true.
That isn't.

586
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:41.730
I know what happens is,

587
00:32:41.731 --> 00:32:45.240
is you fucking assholes go and you buy them up and act like you got him.

588
00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:49.110
Something happens.
I Dunno.
This is so fucking thick.
Seems fishy to me.

589
00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:53.010
And did you know there's a place to get seats at huge savings.

590
00:32:53.011 --> 00:32:54.050
It's called ScoreBig.

591
00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:57.720
Scorebig works directly with your favorite teams and artists to get oh good.

592
00:32:57.721 --> 00:33:01.860
So they get a cut and artists to get their unsold seats at unpublished prices.

593
00:33:01.861 --> 00:33:05.400
That's bullshit.
That's bullshit.

594
00:33:05.401 --> 00:33:08.010
People's scalp tickets to my shows all the fucking time.

595
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.820
And fans end up yelling at me and I'm not,
I don't make any money off of that.

596
00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:15.600
I get that all the time.
Dude,
you're funny.
You're not this funny.

597
00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.550
And then I look and I go,
Jesus Christ,
and I called my age and go,

598
00:33:18.551 --> 00:33:21.390
what the fuck are we charging us money for?
He's like,
we're not doing that.

599
00:33:21.391 --> 00:33:26.350
Those are scalpers.
I don't know,
maybe score,
maybe score big on the level.

600
00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:29.770
I'm gonna have to do a little research here.
Only with score big.

601
00:33:29.771 --> 00:33:30.940
Can you name a ticket price?

602
00:33:30.941 --> 00:33:35.380
It'd be guaranteed to pay below box office up to 60% off.

603
00:33:35.381 --> 00:33:39.730
Now see right there,
they're talking some shit there below box office,

604
00:33:39.731 --> 00:33:43.500
self box offices,
a hundred bucks,
you know?

605
00:33:43.501 --> 00:33:45.780
Then you should be getting it for 40,
right?

606
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:52.310
Or at least under whatever the fuck that,
because they say up to 60% off.

607
00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:56.900
All right,

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.660
Oh,

That's,
that's part of a question.
I will sit in their reading.

625
00:35:02.661 --> 00:35:05.960
They're like,
what the fuck is that thought?
That was like the end of the copy.

626
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:10.340
I think that was some code to save money.
It's somebody question.
All right,

627
00:35:10.341 --> 00:35:15.120
hang on a second.
Jesus Christ.
Okay,

let's,

628
00:35:15.121 --> 00:35:19.380
let's,
let's read some questions here for the week,
shall we?
Um,

629
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:22.710
all right.
By the way,
as I mentioned,
everybody a Wednesday,

630
00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:24.210
I'm going to be back out in Long Island.

631
00:35:24.211 --> 00:35:28.290
This is the makeup date for that show that I had to cancel because of the

632
00:35:28.291 --> 00:35:31.020
snowstorm.
Whenever the hell that was back in January.

633
00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:36.240
I'm doing two shows out there.
Um,
with Vinnie.
Mark,

634
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.280
one of my great friends,

635
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:42.180
one of the nicest people I ever met in show business when I first started.
Uh,

636
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:47.310
it was very nice to me.
Uh,
did I ever tell you guys that,
oh my God,

637
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:52.080
like this story,
there's very few times in my career where

638
00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:54.461
I actually,

639
00:35:54.461 --> 00:35:58.690
when I was on my way starting out that I actually thought about quitting.

640
00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:00.933
<v 3>MMM.</v>

641
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:03.001
<v 0>I remember the,</v>

642
00:36:03.001 --> 00:36:07.080
for the first time I was still living at home with my parents and there was some

643
00:36:07.081 --> 00:36:10.050
big football game on like BC was playing Notre Dame.

644
00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:11.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

645
00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:15.080
<v 0>And,
uh,
I had a Gig in some hell room down and,
um,</v>

646
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.910
Donna Rhode Island,
and never forget it.
This,

647
00:36:20.911 --> 00:36:24.630
this always makes me have a panic attack because I said to my brother,
I go,

648
00:36:24.631 --> 00:36:28.000
I don't know man,
you guys are hanging out.
You're watching the game.
Uh,

649
00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:32.280
I don't know.
I don't,
I don't feel like going.
And my brother said,
uh,
he said,

650
00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:36.360
you should go.
And I ended up going down there and I had a good set.

651
00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.540
And then I never had that feeling again.
And I always thought like,

652
00:36:39.541 --> 00:36:41.520
what the fuck if he didn't say that,

653
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:48.200
like if I didn't go when I be that guy who started and just quit,
you know,

654
00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.450
so anyways,
the next time I had it,
because I can,

655
00:36:50.451 --> 00:36:55.250
I've only had it like two or three times in my career.
The next time I had it.

656
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:58.790
Um,
I definitely believe me had times where I,

657
00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:03.870
I thought I made the wrong decision,
or I was just sitting there going like,

658
00:37:03.871 --> 00:37:06.540
am I going to be the guy who just never fucking sells a ticket?

659
00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.520
Am I going to be that guy?
You know?

660
00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.560
And I remember going back to the fucking hotels.

661
00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:11.920
<v 3>Okay.</v>

662
00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:16.780
<v 0>I'm in one night in particular going back to the hotel and I wrap the pillow</v>

663
00:37:16.781 --> 00:37:21.040
around my head,
like ear muffs,
you know,

664
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:25.730
I was telling this story to Marin the other night.
He was laughing.

665
00:37:25.731 --> 00:37:27.530
I said it wrapped it around my head,

666
00:37:27.531 --> 00:37:32.000
like ear must run the back of my head trying to block out the negativity,

667
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:34.820
you know,
which is still because it was coming from inside my brain.

668
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:38.760
<v 3>Um,
but uh,</v>

669
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:41.190
<v 0>when I first met Vinnie mark,</v>

670
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:45.900
I just moved to New York and I got my first manager and he hooked me up with

671
00:37:45.901 --> 00:37:49.230
this Gig.
It was somewhere out in the,
it was either,

672
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:53.700
I want to say it was either Brooklyn or long island.
I can't remember what,

673
00:37:53.701 --> 00:37:55.290
I can't remember if it was pips.

674
00:37:57.490 --> 00:38:01.540
I don't think it was because the green room wasn't like a comedy club,

675
00:38:01.541 --> 00:38:05.260
Green Room.
It was just this,
it was a shit hole.
Whatever it was.

676
00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.680
Yeah.
It wasn't pips cause pips had like head shots and stuff does,

677
00:38:09.681 --> 00:38:11.450
had no head shots.
I think pips was later.

678
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:13.743
<v 3>MMM.</v>

679
00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.960
<v 0>But I went down there,
man,
and
Vinnie was headlining.</v>

680
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.980
And then this guy,

681
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:25.040
this the Middle Act was one of these guys who used to be a headliner.

682
00:38:25.951 --> 00:38:29.730
He was a headliner during the 80s,
boom,
because there was,

683
00:38:29.731 --> 00:38:34.240
they had more fucking rooms doing comedy than they actually had comedians that

684
00:38:34.241 --> 00:38:36.190
could fucking fill it.
You know,
it's like those,

685
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.670
it's like the Djs now out in Vegas,
they got more Dj Romes than they have,

686
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:44.050
you know,
major known,
uh,
big name Djs that can fill them.

687
00:38:44.051 --> 00:38:46.750
So they'd like just naming that price out there and that clean it up.

688
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.900
God bless him.
Right?
So,
uh,

689
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:55.660
this guy was living that life headlining just because it was in the middle of a

690
00:38:55.661 --> 00:38:57.040
boom.
And anyways,

691
00:38:57.041 --> 00:39:00.430
it all came crashing down and this guy was no longer headlining.

692
00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:05.020
And during the day he was driving a bus and this guy was one of the most

693
00:39:05.021 --> 00:39:07.270
negative fucking people ever.

694
00:39:07.271 --> 00:39:11.830
And I showed up and I didn't know how I was too young.
I didn't know.

695
00:39:11.831 --> 00:39:14.440
I didn't have like the defense shields up,
like,
yeah,
fuck this guy.

696
00:39:14.441 --> 00:39:16.600
I'm not listening to this guy.
Everything that he said.

697
00:39:16.601 --> 00:39:20.260
I took his law and he was basically trying to convince me to quit.

698
00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.360
And,
uh,

699
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:26.920
what's his face while Vinny was up on stage?

700
00:39:26.921 --> 00:39:30.490
This guy was just getting in my fucking ear and then the next night it had to

701
00:39:30.491 --> 00:39:34.330
come back again.
And while the Middle Act was on stage,
I was just,

702
00:39:34.331 --> 00:39:37.300
I was talking to Vinnies go,
man,
that guy who's saying this saying this.

703
00:39:37.301 --> 00:39:39.460
And he was just really,
it was like,
man,
don't listen to that fucking guy.

704
00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:44.620
And Vinnie was totally silly.
He was upbeat,
he was having a great time.
And

705
00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:49.730
I dunno,
I just set up,
before I talked to Vinnie,

706
00:39:49.731 --> 00:39:51.380
I was literally just sitting there like going like,

707
00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:52.900
I don't know that I can do this.

708
00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:54.330
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

709
00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:59.010
<v 0>I can't,
I can't sit and listen to like,
is this,
this is what New York comedy is.</v>

710
00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:01.550
You go do a Gig.
You know,

711
00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:04.260
I was already feeling weird because I was out of Massachusetts.

712
00:40:04.261 --> 00:40:05.790
Nobody talked like me anymore.

713
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.960
I was like this fucking little baby deer wandering around trying to figure out

714
00:40:09.961 --> 00:40:13.400
where it,
where it could get stage time and um,

715
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:15.280
<v 1>okay.</v>

716
00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.440
<v 0>You know,
New York seemed like a million miles away back then.</v>

717
00:40:17.441 --> 00:40:19.930
This is the mid nineties.
I mean,
people,
I didn't even,

718
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.700
I hadn't even bought my first laptop yet.

719
00:40:21.701 --> 00:40:24.610
Forget about even it never even been on the fucking internet as far as I

720
00:40:24.611 --> 00:40:25.444
remember.

721
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.863
<v 1>MMM,</v>

722
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.910
<v 0>no,
I think it had been a little bit,
no,
I didn't.</v>

723
00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:36.690
I bought my first laptop in 1996 I remember it was like just thick as the first

724
00:40:37.091 --> 00:40:41.290
flat screen TV to probably weighed just as much.
So anyways,

725
00:40:41.291 --> 00:40:44.290
meaning that New York was a million miles away.
I didn't know anything about it.

726
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:45.520
And I just remember just thinking like,

727
00:40:45.521 --> 00:40:48.760
if this is what every fucking weekend is going to be like in this place,

728
00:40:48.761 --> 00:40:53.530
I might be moving back home.
And he was a guy once again,
just by luck,

729
00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:57.370
somebody came along and fucking talk me out of whatever the hell my head was

730
00:40:57.371 --> 00:41:00.960
saying.
So anyways,
all these years later,
we get to do another weekend together.

731
00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:05.620
So very excited to be working with him.
Do for the rest of the tour.
Um,
Todd,

732
00:41:05.621 --> 00:41:09.340
rex,
Todd,
Rex,
ladies and gentlemen,
t rex,

733
00:41:09.341 --> 00:41:13.090
the fucking lunatic.
Uh,
it's going to be opening for me.

734
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:16.140
I'm fucking hilarious guy.
Uh,

735
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:20.320
he's going to be going all the way through the Carolinas and a into Virginia

736
00:41:20.321 --> 00:41:22.780
with me.
So a good at my work cut up.

737
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:25.520
So I probably shouldn't eat all that God damn food.
But with that,
let me,
uh,

738
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:28.900
let me do some of the reeds here for this week.
All right.
Um,

739
00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:34.670
Dakota access pipeline,
whatever the fuck this means.

740
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:36.770
You definitely have my,
uh,

741
00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:38.790
<v 2>okay.</v>

742
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:40.800
<v 0>Peaked my interest here.
Pay High.
Bill,</v>

743
00:41:40.801 --> 00:41:43.020
I've been listening to your podcast for one and a half years.

744
00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:44.580
You're a very funny comedian.

745
00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:49.410
I was hoping to get your thoughts on the Dakota access pipeline.
Now,

746
00:41:49.411 --> 00:41:52.950
for some reason I feel like this is some sort of jokey thing and they just

747
00:41:52.951 --> 00:41:54.360
wanted to hear me say it out loud,

748
00:41:54.361 --> 00:41:59.361
but I'll look it up to cota access pipeline.

749
00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:01.230
Let's see what the fuck this is.

750
00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:06.060
Dakota access pipeline protests in North Dakota turned violent.

751
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:10.820
All right.
When the protests not turned violent.

752
00:42:10.821 --> 00:42:14.480
It's always this protestors and then the cops show up.
They,
yeah,
bye.

753
00:42:14.481 --> 00:42:15.470
Take it easy.

754
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:18.000
<v 5>So he got you fucking take it easy,
man.</v>

755
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:23.080
<v 0>Somebody throws a punch and then it's,
it's a fucking,
it's a bra.</v>

756
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:26.550
All right.
Protest against the Dakota access pipeline in North Dakota.

757
00:42:26.551 --> 00:42:27.720
Turned violent on Saturday,

758
00:42:27.721 --> 00:42:30.990
demonstrated supporting the standing rock Sioux tribe.

759
00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:35.910
Faced off with private security officers from the Dallas based engine energy

760
00:42:35.911 --> 00:42:40.760
transfer partners.
Wait,
it's on native American land and they have,

761
00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:44.250
and the big corporation as their own security officers.

762
00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.000
<v 2>Okay.</v>

763
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.960
<v 0>Is Julia Roberts already optioned this for a Oscar winning role.</v>

764
00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:53.680
She goes in and somehow figures out how to defeat the Dallas space energy

765
00:42:53.681 --> 00:42:54.760
transfer partners.

766
00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.590
A video from the scene showed security offers is threatening protesters with

767
00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:04.270
dogs.
As all things consider reported,

768
00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:08.710
hundreds of native Americans from tribes across the country have set up a camp

769
00:43:08.711 --> 00:43:10.810
near the construction site in North Dakota.

770
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.590
The army corps of engineers approve the oil pipeline in July,

771
00:43:14.591 --> 00:43:17.530
allowing it to run under the Missouri River,

772
00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:21.040
close to the standing rock Sioux tribe reservation.

773
00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.930
And you know what's going to happen eventually.

774
00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:24.030
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

775
00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:27.540
<v 0>That pipeline is going to burst as they always do.</v>

776
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:31.980
Protestors worry that the $3.80 8 million billion pipeline,

777
00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:37.160
which is slated to run through four states could disturb sacred sites and effect

778
00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.550
the reservations.

779
00:43:38.551 --> 00:43:43.551
Drinking water abso-fucking-lutely if human beings are involved is always the

780
00:43:44.791 --> 00:43:46.090
chance.
Second happen.
The,

781
00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:50.820
the show democracy now was at the site of the protest Saturday and documented

782
00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:52.110
some tense moments.

783
00:43:52.111 --> 00:43:56.910
Dogs appeared to bike protestors and security guards appeared to use pepper

784
00:43:56.911 --> 00:43:57.271
spray.

785
00:43:57.271 --> 00:44:02.271
Warning the video below includes some fleeting explicative.

786
00:44:02.311 --> 00:44:03.810
So I think I can handle this.

787
00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:14.790
<v 5>We're standing at the construction site of the Dakota access pipeline.</v>

788
00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.600
It looks like there are

789
00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:20.130
<v 0>please.
Yeah.
These people are not going to win.
It's just,</v>

790
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:25.160
it's a bunch of people saying no wearing like hipster hats while people drive

791
00:44:25.741 --> 00:44:29.720
bulldozers.
It's already happening.
Um,

792
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:33.360
oh yeah.

793
00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:33.770
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

794
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:36.980
<v 0>It looks disorganized as a bunch of different signs.</v>

795
00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:41.620
<v 5>Chicken,
chicken.
Where are you still get Washington?</v>

796
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:45.710
Can you describe what you see?

797
00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:46.740
<v 0>This is so nuts.</v>

798
00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:48.840
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

799
00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:52.320
<v 0>To come down and yell at people on bulldozers,
like I guess,
cause you want it,</v>

800
00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:56.220
you want to get the,
uh,
the attention of the media with their,

801
00:44:56.221 --> 00:44:59.700
on bulldozers on the other side of a wire.
So like what,
what are you going to do?

802
00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.450
Uh,
once protest is arrived at the construction area,

803
00:45:04.451 --> 00:45:07.390
they broke down a wire fence by stepping in,
jumping on it.

804
00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:08.360
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

805
00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:08.841
<v 0>Then of course,</v>

806
00:45:08.841 --> 00:45:12.350
immediately they're trespassing according to numerous witnesses within five

807
00:45:12.351 --> 00:45:15.770
minutes to crowd of protesters estimated to be a few hundred people became

808
00:45:15.771 --> 00:45:19.490
violent.
They stampeded into the construction area with horses,

809
00:45:19.491 --> 00:45:24.160
dogs and vehicles.
Okay.
And it was said more.

810
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:25.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

811
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:27.980
<v 0>The sheriff said it was more like a riot than a protest,</v>

812
00:45:27.981 --> 00:45:30.380
but the cops always say that,
you know,

813
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:33.050
and then the protest is always say the cops throw the first punch.

814
00:45:33.051 --> 00:45:37.680
You never know who to believe.
This is like,
let's,
let's watch this.

815
00:45:37.681 --> 00:45:42.330
This is like a protest to WWE.
All right,
this guy's got a cell phone.

816
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:48.200
He looks to be native American or maybe he's a appropriating their culture,

817
00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:51.090
you know,
having his hair long.

818
00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:52.420
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

819
00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:54.850
<v 0>I don't know what's going on.
There's a fucking helicopter.</v>

820
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:55.930
<v 2>Okay,</v>

821
00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:58.100
<v 0>let's get to the dogs.
Water is life.</v>

822
00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:01.070
Somebody held that and it was written and it was a feather in the background.

823
00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:06.200
All right.
Now who's a woman?
Oh,
this isn't gonna end.
Well,

824
00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:10.490
they're going through the fence.

825
00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:19.980
Oh Shit.
Oh,
somebody got nice tackle.

826
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:24.780
Nice tackle.
Oh,
now they got some dogs.

827
00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:28.900
<v 5>The security,</v>

828
00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:31.390
<v 0>I think they just did.
They're going to Adam and square here.</v>

829
00:46:31.391 --> 00:46:34.180
They just trying to get in front of them.
Yeah.
This sounds great.

830
00:46:34.181 --> 00:46:37.390
This sounds like a,
the usual big business thing that they,

831
00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:41.260
I don't know anything about it.
I don't know anything about it.
Um,

832
00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:46.160
I do feel like eventually they're going to do enough of that fracking and then

833
00:46:46.161 --> 00:46:49.250
they'll fuck up all the water,
all the drinking water.

834
00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:51.850
And I don't think corporations care.
I just think that'd be it.

835
00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:55.010
Well then that's great.
Then there'll be no fresh water for anybody to use,

836
00:46:55.011 --> 00:46:59.270
so they'll have to all go to Nestle for their fresh water.
You know,

837
00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:02.990
and then we'll say that it's just still,
but it really isn't.
It's SORTA is.

838
00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:04.610
And when they get sick,

839
00:47:04.611 --> 00:47:07.580
the class action suit versus the money we're going to make.
Yeah.

840
00:47:07.581 --> 00:47:12.500
We're not going to give a fuck.
We'll pay him off.
That'll be yet,
Eh,
uh,

841
00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.450
I dunno.
Yeah.
I don't,
I don't have any faith in anything to be honest with you.

842
00:47:17.451 --> 00:47:20.900
I think we're just going to completely destroy the planet and each other.

843
00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:23.900
But in the meantime,
if I could make you laugh a little bit,

844
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:30.010
do you ever at the end of Carlin's life

845
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:33.730
<v 1>when people were saying he got to fucking angry,
I didn't think that.</v>

846
00:47:33.731 --> 00:47:37.180
I was just like,
yeah,
this guy's making a lot of sense to me.

847
00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:41.950
It was still funny to me.
Still made sense.
I thought,
uh,

848
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:47.860
I dunno.
However he read the tea leaves,
it made sense to me.
Um,

849
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:49.800
okay.

850
00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.800
<v 0>Oh,
just about the whole way we go about fucking communicate with each other.</v>

851
00:47:52.801 --> 00:47:57.410
We just end up screaming and yelling and then we get physical and somebody hits

852
00:47:57.411 --> 00:48:00.900
somebody and then I'll all hell breaks loose.
That's,
that's what happens.

853
00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:03.390
It happens,
you know,
I do it.

854
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:07.890
I started discussing this election with some people the other day,

855
00:48:07.891 --> 00:48:10.320
and within three minutes of me talking,

856
00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.980
three quarters of the people walked out of the rump.
I mean that,

857
00:48:12.981 --> 00:48:17.520
that's how in sufferable I am.
Is that the right word?
Um,

858
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:23.140
women's suffrage,
uh,
whatever the fuck it is.
What do I think about it?

859
00:48:23.141 --> 00:48:26.290
I'm starting to get your thoughts and just go to access pipeline.
Um,

860
00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:33.030
I don't know,
Dude.
There's just too many fucking people because everyone,

861
00:48:33.031 --> 00:48:36.750
you know,
I love a Tesla.
I love a Prius,
Prius and all that shit,

862
00:48:36.751 --> 00:48:38.580
but if you get all these cars,

863
00:48:38.581 --> 00:48:42.600
then all of a sudden everybody has to plug in their car,
then that's more energy.

864
00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:44.700
I know when you make electricity that,
you know,

865
00:48:44.701 --> 00:48:48.120
you need machines and the machines need the oil sell.
It's just,

866
00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:53.180
it's we consume is what we do and there's too many of us.

867
00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:56.850
That's the fucking problem.
All these technological advances,

868
00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.680
myths that we make are tremendous.

869
00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:03.660
It's just the amount of people that have to live off of him.
That's where a,

870
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:08.100
it's like getting fat.
You know what I mean?
All fat is,
is you're,
you're,

871
00:49:08.101 --> 00:49:10.440
you're taking in more calories than you're burning.

872
00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:15.720
And that's kind of like what we're doing,
except we're taking more,

873
00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:19.350
more than we're given back and eventually it's,
it's got to run out.

874
00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.353
Uh,

875
00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:26.850
so I think there's going to be a drastic decision at some point it's going to

876
00:49:26.851 --> 00:49:30.600
have going to have to be made about the population.
You know,

877
00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.320
it's just inevitable.
There's gay,
you know,

878
00:49:34.321 --> 00:49:38.970
when there's fucking 6 billion people left.
Why did I pick that number?

879
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:44.070
I shouldn't have said that now,
but let me take a,
a more empathetic number.

880
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.650
Cause that's what I was thinking of.
I was only thinking Hitler.
I mean,

881
00:49:46.651 --> 00:49:48.960
someone's going to have to fuck someone is going to end up doing that.

882
00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.393
<v 1>Okay.</v>

883
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:55.180
<v 0>If we could somehow all sit down and talk this out in this book,
but you just,</v>

884
00:49:55.181 --> 00:49:56.050
what you would literally have to do,

885
00:49:56.051 --> 00:50:00.070
you'd literally have to try to get everybody in the world on the same page and

886
00:50:00.071 --> 00:50:03.700
to see it the same way.
You know,

887
00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:08.670
you had a fear of Jira.
Fucking,
you get your order a UFC event,

888
00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:10.440
you get 10 people in the room.
I mean,

889
00:50:10.441 --> 00:50:12.870
how many can people agree on the one place to order from?

890
00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.090
If you put it up to a vote,

891
00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:18.120
you know you're going to get the whole world to get on page.

892
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:22.140
It's somebody who's going to have to do the old right there,
Fred.
Um,

893
00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:24.663
<v 1>yeah,</v>

894
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:29.630
<v 0>I dunno dude.
They should,
they should
do it first voluntarily.</v>

895
00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:35.060
Like they should be all right.
This is the deal we're going to have to take out.

896
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:40.130
We got to get this number down below a billion and there's seven and a half

897
00:50:40.131 --> 00:50:44.720
billion of us.
So,
uh,
we're going to get to this number no matter what.

898
00:50:44.721 --> 00:50:45.201
It's like when a,

899
00:50:45.201 --> 00:50:49.940
when a fucking flight is oversold and they try to get some volunteers,
you know,

900
00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:55.100
I wonder if the tree huggers,
you know,
I'm a lazy tree hugger.

901
00:50:55.101 --> 00:50:57.640
I love nature,
but you know,
you know,

902
00:50:57.650 --> 00:51:02.240
I'm not going to go make a sign or chain myself to a sapling,
you know,
so,

903
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:05.540
you know,
I talk a good game,
but I,
I don't do any of the shit.
Right.

904
00:51:05.541 --> 00:51:08.540
So what I'm wondering is if,
if they go on,
look,

905
00:51:08.541 --> 00:51:11.480
we're going to get the population down below to 1,000,000,001 way or the other.

906
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:16.180
We're asking for some volunteers.
If you're willing to,
to,
uh,

907
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:19.010
walk into the wood chipper or whatever the fuck you have to do.

908
00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:20.850
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

909
00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:23.910
<v 0>Um,
you know,
we'll give a voucher</v>

910
00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:31.710
to the surviving members of your family or whatever.
I mean,
but even then,

911
00:51:31.711 --> 00:51:34.500
they mean they have to,
if you're gonna,
if you're going to cut it by that much.

912
00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:38.790
Um,
cause I literally think that that's what,
that's what we're going to run into.

913
00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:39.190
Yeah.

914
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:40.023
<v 1>And</v>

915
00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:43.220
<v 0>then there's going to,
there's going to be this big fun,
like,</v>

916
00:51:43.221 --> 00:51:44.650
I think that that Bilderberg Shit,

917
00:51:44.651 --> 00:51:47.830
like this is what they have to talk about going,
okay,

918
00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:52.930
we have to keep the best of the best of each race,

919
00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:56.800
each gender.
Yeah.
Hope that they're going to do that.
Right.

920
00:51:58.370 --> 00:51:59.203
<v 1>And</v>

921
00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:02.900
<v 0>yeah,
and then everybody else has to go and then they to be one waiting,
wait,</v>

922
00:52:02.901 --> 00:52:05.440
wait,
we don't want to mow our own lawns.
Right?

923
00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:09.010
We've got to keep some meat heads around a pick shit up.

924
00:52:09.011 --> 00:52:12.400
We don't want to have to like if we kill too many people then all of a sudden we

925
00:52:12.401 --> 00:52:14.740
have to build our own log cabins.
We don't want that.

926
00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:18.130
So it's going to be really like,
you know,

927
00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:25.130
is going to have like have like their own fucking city that we don't know about.

928
00:52:25.131 --> 00:52:26.240
Right.
And everybody goes to like,

929
00:52:26.241 --> 00:52:29.420
almost like Superman's hide out and everybody goes up there.
Right.

930
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:34.040
And it's enough people to keep humanity going,

931
00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.760
but at this point you need enough people.
Do you ever see that fucking thing?

932
00:52:37.761 --> 00:52:41.120
Like what would happen if all the people went away and after like I don't know

933
00:52:41.121 --> 00:52:44.210
how many days,
like the nuclear reactors,
the,
uh,
the,
the,
the,

934
00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:49.280
they all had like the meltdowns because whatever was going on and wasn't keeping

935
00:52:49.281 --> 00:52:52.730
those,
those fucking things at homer Simpson always takes home with them.

936
00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:58.760
They don't keep it cool.
Jesus.
I'm way in over my head now.
Huh?
Um,
I don't know.

937
00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:01.760
I'm fucking people you'd have to keep alive,
but uh,
I,
I just don't see it.

938
00:53:01.761 --> 00:53:04.010
So as far as the Dakota access pipeline,

939
00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:08.000
that's just one of those things where I watch it and I feel bad for the people

940
00:53:08.001 --> 00:53:10.460
that live there and I am,

941
00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.650
I don't really know enough about the other end of it.

942
00:53:14.651 --> 00:53:15.970
I know that trying to make money,

943
00:53:15.971 --> 00:53:20.920
but they also are also trying to keep 300 million people living at a certain

944
00:53:20.921 --> 00:53:23.890
standard of living.
Right.
Aren't they here in this country?

945
00:53:23.891 --> 00:53:26.170
I have no fucking idea.
All right.
Jesus Christ that,

946
00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:29.940
that literally gave me a headache.
All right.
Stop paying bills.

947
00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:35.230
Hey Bill.
Thanks to the left's,
you're welcome.
Thank you for listening.

948
00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:40.360
I'm in search of the solution to the fucking bankers.
Oh,

949
00:53:40.361 --> 00:53:43.630
in search of the solution for the fucking bankers.
I had a crazy thought.

950
00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:48.790
What if the 99% just simply stopped paying all of our bills to major

951
00:53:48.791 --> 00:53:52.330
corporations,
mortgage credit cards,
line of credit.

952
00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:55.060
I'm not exactly convinced it's a solution,

953
00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:59.920
but you can imagine the chaos even if half of the population did that.

954
00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:01.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

955
00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:03.850
<v 0>Uh,
just thought it would be interesting to get your thoughts on this.</v>

956
00:54:03.851 --> 00:54:06.310
Now I must get back to cleaning this grocery store.

957
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:12.410
Fuck you and everything you do.
I had to bring that back.
All right.
Uh,
I would,

958
00:54:12.411 --> 00:54:15.940
if people used to say that I like that.
Fuck you and everything you do.
Um,

959
00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:18.030
<v 1>okay,</v>

960
00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:20.100
<v 0>well here's the thing.
All right.
Um,</v>

961
00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:22.763
<v 1>okay.</v>

962
00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:25.190
<v 0>If everybody just didn't pay their bills then like</v>

963
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:31.050
the whole thing would stop and the,
and they would put a lock on all the banks.

964
00:54:31.051 --> 00:54:34.260
I mean,
all that money that they loaned out is,
that's your money.
That's my money.

965
00:54:34.261 --> 00:54:37.090
That's regular people's fucking money.
All right.

966
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:40.500
It's not rich people's money then at loans,
unless they put it in a bank,
I guess.

967
00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:45.180
Um,
yeah,
like that,
that would not work.

968
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:47.880
That wouldn't work.
And then they would just be like,
all right,

969
00:54:47.881 --> 00:54:51.300
well then you guys have no more money and you know them.

970
00:54:51.301 --> 00:54:55.510
They fucking the super,
the 1%,
I mean,
they,

971
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:56.910
<v 1>okay.</v>

972
00:54:56.910 --> 00:55:00.120
<v 0>They got like fucking wine cellars and shit and they got like,
you know,</v>

973
00:55:00.121 --> 00:55:03.950
they got like,
they like,
like they used to leave the,

974
00:55:03.951 --> 00:55:06.290
the like woolly mammoth steaks,
you know,
they,
they get,

975
00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:10.200
they got fucking food for days,
for months.
They can totally wait us out.

976
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:14.360
Um,
there's all,

977
00:55:14.361 --> 00:55:18.020
the only way to fix all of this was human beings would have to have been wired

978
00:55:18.021 --> 00:55:20.990
differently and we're not,
at the end of the day,
you know,

979
00:55:20.991 --> 00:55:23.690
a lot of the shit that the upper 1% is doing,

980
00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:28.700
I think all of us would also be doing if we had that opportunity.

981
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:33.680
It's just sort of natural,
you know what I mean?
I Dunno.

982
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.810
<v 1>Okay.</v>

983
00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:39.810
<v 0>Who would they go?
You know,
people don't handle power wealth.
My,
myself included.</v>

984
00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:44.920
Um,
that's an interesting thought.
I have no fucking idea.

985
00:55:44.921 --> 00:55:49.060
I just wish that they would just,
they would just,
you know,

986
00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:54.200
I pay my bills.
Why can't this country pay the bills?
Why can't you just keep,

987
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:56.990
you know,
why?
Why do we always got to be in this level of fucking debt?

988
00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.050
They just keep going and going and going and going and going,

989
00:56:00.051 --> 00:56:04.550
and they act like the,
to someday,
like the shit's not going to hit the fan.
Um,

990
00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:05.870
Jesus guys,
king,

991
00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:08.660
can you tell by these answers to these questions you're asking me?

992
00:56:08.661 --> 00:56:12.260
They're just way beyond my ability.
Maybe this is why you do it.
All right,

993
00:56:12.261 --> 00:56:14.150
lady Fan heckler question.

994
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.120
<v 4>Uh,
hey there bill.</v>

995
00:56:17.121 --> 00:56:22.121
I'm a [inaudible] fan and I would like your opinion on a situation.

996
00:56:22.161 --> 00:56:23.200
Amy Shu

997
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:28.750
<v 0>and counted on her tour in Stockholm early on in her set.</v>

998
00:56:28.751 --> 00:56:30.940
A male heckles shouted,
show us your tits.

999
00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:36.420
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1000
00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:38.550
<v 0>Oh,
it's hilarious.
She heard it.</v>

1001
00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:42.720
Had the audience points of the guy and shut them down pretty quickly.
What?

1002
00:56:42.721 --> 00:56:45.450
The few jokes.
All right,
good for her.
She also sit,

1003
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:49.680
said if he yelled out again,
she'd have him kicked out.
Well,

1004
00:56:49.681 --> 00:56:53.550
literally five seconds later he yelled out again.
Yeah,

1005
00:56:53.551 --> 00:56:57.990
this guy's a class clown,
you know,
next person does that gets the attention.

1006
00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:01.050
And she did have him thrown out of the show.
Well,
it's her show.

1007
00:57:01.051 --> 00:57:03.450
She can do what she wants.
My question is,

1008
00:57:03.451 --> 00:57:08.310
at what point would you have a heck with thrown out or when have you had a

1009
00:57:08.311 --> 00:57:10.530
heckler thrown out is a great question.

1010
00:57:10.531 --> 00:57:13.830
I have no problem with their controlling the vibe at our own show,

1011
00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:18.180
especially when there were a ton of other audience members for whom the show

1012
00:57:18.181 --> 00:57:21.060
might have been ruined if the guy kept shouting.
Yeah,

1013
00:57:21.061 --> 00:57:24.330
they came there to hear her act,
you know what I mean?

1014
00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:25.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1015
00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:29.790
<v 0>He got one,
show me your tits.
She fucking road with that and said,
hey,
you know,</v>

1016
00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:33.730
it's not like,
it doesn't sound like,
you know,

1017
00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:36.820
unless she was talking about our tits,
which it doesn't sound like she was,

1018
00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:40.750
it doesn't sound like it had any context to what she was talking about.

1019
00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:43.150
If someone just yells that out,
then if it,

1020
00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:46.240
if someone's just going to just keep yelling,
fuck you,
blah blah blah,

1021
00:57:46.241 --> 00:57:47.170
or something like that,

1022
00:57:47.171 --> 00:57:52.171
then you know as a comic you could just stand there and just trash the guy for

1023
00:57:52.541 --> 00:57:54.220
the whole hour and still get paid,

1024
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:58.540
but like the rest of the crowd is not going to walk away happy.

1025
00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:02.650
That has been my experience when you do something like that.
So anyways,

1026
00:58:02.651 --> 00:58:03.670
she continues.
She says,

1027
00:58:03.671 --> 00:58:06.010
I have no problem with to controlling the vibe at our own show,

1028
00:58:06.310 --> 00:58:09.580
especially when there were a ton of other audience members for whom the show

1029
00:58:09.581 --> 00:58:12.730
might have been ruined if this guy kept shouting.
However,

1030
00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:16.780
I've also seen you handle hecklers in your specials and shows without having

1031
00:58:16.781 --> 00:58:21.570
them ejected.
Um,
this case might be different senses.

1032
00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:25.960
Hex Is Haeckel was sexual in nature and as far as I know,

1033
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:28.540
no heckler has ever shouted.
Show us your Dick.

1034
00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:36.750
Do you want stage?
Oh my God,
that would fucking kill me if somebody all day,

1035
00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:42.040
any who just curious is what you thought about at the video of the situation at

1036
00:58:42.041 --> 00:58:44.260
this link.
If you want to see it.
Uh,

1037
00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:47.140
can't wait for season two of emphasis for family and best of luck with your

1038
00:58:47.141 --> 00:58:50.080
upcoming special.
Thank you very much.
Um,

1039
00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:52.090
<v 1>okay.</v>

1040
00:58:52.090 --> 00:58:54.420
<v 0>Once you're,
I dunno,</v>

1041
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:57.580
I think once you're at a level where you're selling tickets and it's your crowd

1042
00:58:57.581 --> 00:58:59.380
and everything,
uh,

1043
00:58:59.381 --> 00:59:02.740
I think you just do run your show how you want to have your show run.

1044
00:59:02.741 --> 00:59:05.830
I know that there's comics out there that say no heckling.

1045
00:59:05.831 --> 00:59:08.080
There's other people that don't give a shit about heckling.

1046
00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:09.520
I'm one of those people.
I don't,

1047
00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:11.333
<v 1>mmm.</v>

1048
00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:15.250
<v 0>I don't mind.
90% of heckling,
you know,</v>

1049
00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:20.251
it's that 10% where you just didn't want to be there or you're just completely

1050
00:59:20.711 --> 00:59:23.870
fucking Mike wasted drunk.

1051
00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:25.583
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1052
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.080
<v 0>And you're just there.
You're just gonna.
You're gonna.</v>

1053
00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:29.490
Even if I get the better of you,

1054
00:59:29.491 --> 00:59:32.400
you're still just not going to shut up and you're just there to ruin everyone's

1055
00:59:32.401 --> 00:59:36.480
good time.
At that point,
I would say like,
listen,
and I would,
you know,

1056
00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:39.060
give the person the money back.
It's like I'm not trying to be a deck,
you know,

1057
00:59:39.061 --> 00:59:42.660
maybe next time or go see another comic.
But,
um,

1058
00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:45.490
I've only had to do that a handful of times.

1059
00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:47.523
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1060
00:59:48.610 --> 00:59:50.260
<v 0>When I first did the opiate Anthony Show,</v>

1061
00:59:50.261 --> 00:59:55.070
there was this guy I remember came down.
And,
uh,

1062
00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:57.100
he just didn't get it.
Like he came down

1063
00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.890
on the first show and was just screaming and yelling and screaming and yelling.

1064
01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:06.430
The whole fog.
It was,
it was crazy.
And um,

1065
01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:11.990
then he showed up
like two nights later again,

1066
01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:17.550
and he sat right down front and one of the waitresses overheard him.

1067
01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:20.130
I'm going to yell out the punchlines to all of his jokes

1068
01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:25.930
so I,
what I should have done was immediately say,
get that Guy Outta here.

1069
01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:29.620
Get 'em out of here,
give him his money back.
I'll take a picture with them.

1070
01:00:29.621 --> 01:00:31.630
Just get them out of here.
Cause I don't want to deal with this guy.

1071
01:00:31.631 --> 01:00:34.330
This guy's wasted and it's going to ruin the show for everybody.

1072
01:00:34.331 --> 01:00:35.470
And he was here two nights ago.

1073
01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:38.380
I can't come up with 60 new minutes and fucking two nights.

1074
01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:41.890
And he was deliberately going there to mess up the fucking show.

1075
01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:45.310
But the weird thing was,
was he didn't go there in a malicious way.

1076
01:00:45.311 --> 01:00:48.520
He thought it was funny and it was one of those things that was really in the

1077
01:00:48.521 --> 01:00:52.600
spirit of the opie and Anthony Show.
But this wasn't the opiate Anthony show.

1078
01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.350
This was a standup comedy show.

1079
01:00:54.351 --> 01:00:58.690
So it was an awkward thing and I had to get them out of there or else he was

1080
01:00:58.691 --> 01:01:02.200
going to fuck it up for everybody and he was fucking beside himself.

1081
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:06.370
I mean we can,
we don't understand.
I love you though.
You don't understand.
Right.

1082
01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:11.470
So they ended up kicking him out classic way like the way a comedy club kicked

1083
01:01:11.471 --> 01:01:15.010
somebody out is they get them just be on the threshold of the door and

1084
01:01:15.011 --> 01:01:18.670
immediately turned a blind eye to the person like,
well that takes care of that.

1085
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.220
Right.
Then they inevitably come back in,

1086
01:01:21.221 --> 01:01:25.690
which this guy did and I was selling cds.
This isn't long ago.
It was,

1087
01:01:25.691 --> 01:01:29.380
I was selling cds after the show and I look up and this is fucking guy again,

1088
01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:36.370
pleading his case with me and then he got so mad,
he goes,
I'm never come on one,

1089
01:01:36.371 --> 01:01:39.750
two year shows again.
And I was like,
good,
good.

1090
01:01:39.751 --> 01:01:42.300
The amount of stress and anxiety brought to me,
blah blah.

1091
01:01:42.301 --> 01:01:44.070
And then like the end of the night,

1092
01:01:44.071 --> 01:01:47.460
someone had broken the window out front of the club and I always thought it was

1093
01:01:47.461 --> 01:01:49.600
Sam.
I have no idea.
So,
um,

1094
01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:54.960
my thoughts on heckling is basically,
uh,
it's a part of the art form.

1095
01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:57.990
And I also think it's,
it's a part of the art form that makes it really cool.

1096
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:59.640
But that's also,

1097
01:01:59.641 --> 01:02:03.720
I don't define the rules of it and it's just one of the things that I enjoyed

1098
01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:05.370
that always scared me in the beginning,

1099
01:02:05.371 --> 01:02:07.110
that I always thought was so cool about comics,

1100
01:02:07.111 --> 01:02:10.440
that people would yell at them and they could just handle them and then continue

1101
01:02:10.441 --> 01:02:14.820
on with their act.
Um,
and the way I look at it,

1102
01:02:14.821 --> 01:02:19.200
I say a lot of ignorant shit when I'm on stage and,
uh,
you know,

1103
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:20.670
provoke people and stuff.

1104
01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:25.020
Like I can't expect them to sit on their hands the whole time.
And I,
you know,

1105
01:02:25.021 --> 01:02:28.530
I like it.
I actually enjoy when people yell shit at me,
you know,
to a point,

1106
01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:32.950
you know,
but if it's on topic,
Somebody Yell Shit of,

1107
01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:35.360
I always gorgeous say,
what'd you say?
No,
I'd go back and forth.

1108
01:02:35.361 --> 01:02:36.960
You know what I mean?
But uh,
yeah,

1109
01:02:38.290 --> 01:02:39.123
<v 3>you know,</v>

1110
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.590
<v 0>I dunno.
I mean it's,
it's kind of a part of being a comedian,</v>

1111
01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:48.120
but I think after a while and once,
you know,
you said it was in Stockholm,
Sweden,

1112
01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:50.700
them,
and that's an important show.
You be going over there.

1113
01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:53.850
You're not like the other ones aren't.
But then here year in another country,

1114
01:02:53.851 --> 01:02:57.120
you want to make sure you have an a good show and right out of the gate if

1115
01:02:57.121 --> 01:03:01.470
someone comes in,
they come in at you like that.
Um,
they're testing you.

1116
01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.040
And I know a lot of it's going to be made like,
you know,
oh,
it's a sexting.

1117
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:08.520
And you know,
that's not a heckle is,
it's this data now.
It,
it's,

1118
01:03:08.521 --> 01:03:12.510
it's the basic thing where it's like you're being tested by the crowd.

1119
01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:17.900
So what the comic has to do is throw the fucking hammered down or else the crowd

1120
01:03:18.691 --> 01:03:22.550
takes control the show.
And you're going to have a long fucking evening.
So yeah,

1121
01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:27.400
there's a million different ways to do it.
That's how she chose to do it.

1122
01:03:27.401 --> 01:03:31.650
It's her fucking show.
So then you go,
that's what I think.
I think however,
the,

1123
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:36.450
however the comedian decides to handle it is,
is the way to handle it.
Um,

1124
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:40.370
I dunno,
I just make it all the crazy,

1125
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:46.560
some of the shit that people have said to me over the years.
Best one,
everyone's,

1126
01:03:46.570 --> 01:03:51.260
when I was at danger fields,
somebody yelled out,
Eh,
uh,

1127
01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:57.330
anything read in on stages that,
and yous said Faggot.

1128
01:03:58.150 --> 01:04:00.450
It's so they use like homophobia.

1129
01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:01.970
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1130
01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:05.810
<v 0>For whatever fucking reason.
And uh,
I'll never forget that.</v>

1131
01:04:05.811 --> 01:04:10.811
Heco because it was so like anything red and on stage it was like,

1132
01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:13.880
it was like worded,
like I was in second grade.

1133
01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:16.293
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1134
01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:18.040
<v 0>But this guy was like,</v>

1135
01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:21.670
I don't like the anger that was coming off of this guy and the group of people

1136
01:04:21.671 --> 01:04:22.331
that he was in with.

1137
01:04:22.331 --> 01:04:27.331
I knew if I engaged and there was no security at that club and I could not beat

1138
01:04:27.881 --> 01:04:31.490
up him much less him and two of his fucking friends.
And I just,
you know,

1139
01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:35.260
I liked the Mike stand where it was rather than wrapped around my Charlie Brown

1140
01:04:35.261 --> 01:04:37.060
heads.
So I didn't say anything.

1141
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.560
I didn't say anything.
I,
I've had a,

1142
01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:45.050
<v 2>okay.</v>

1143
01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:49.670
<v 0>You know.
Oh Jesus Christ.
Oh,
the memories coming back.</v>

1144
01:04:49.671 --> 01:04:51.710
I bet I've had shit thrown at me.

1145
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:56.120
So wait.
So dental philosophy,

1146
01:04:56.121 --> 01:04:59.270
one time I remember I was talking about working in a dental office when I was

1147
01:04:59.271 --> 01:05:02.780
younger and somebody in the middle just through dental floss like that would add

1148
01:05:02.781 --> 01:05:03.381
to the bit.

1149
01:05:03.381 --> 01:05:07.760
Somehow I had pissed off a woman in Tampa at one time and she threw a glass ice

1150
01:05:07.761 --> 01:05:08.594
at me.

1151
01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:10.550
<v 3>Uh Huh.</v>

1152
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:15.030
<v 0>So we can do a dinner roll at me,
had a lot of shit thrown at me.</v>

1153
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.823
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1154
01:05:19.070 --> 01:05:23.240
<v 0>And then just every fucking thing I remember being on stage one time at the</v>

1155
01:05:23.241 --> 01:05:24.440
Boston comedy club.

1156
01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:25.960
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1157
01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:28.120
<v 0>And they've used these two black women's sitting in the front and there was</v>

1158
01:05:28.121 --> 01:05:31.990
barely anybody and there was late night and I was bombing and there was this two

1159
01:05:31.991 --> 01:05:36.991
black women in the front and one of them had put her head on the other girl's

1160
01:05:37.061 --> 01:05:38.890
shoulder and was pretending to sleep.

1161
01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:43.990
And it bothered me for about six years that cause I had a glass of water on

1162
01:05:43.991 --> 01:05:45.160
stage with the straw.

1163
01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.550
It bugged me for six years that I didn't think in that moment.

1164
01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:51.400
You know when you put your finger over the top of the straw and you keep the

1165
01:05:51.401 --> 01:05:54.400
water in it to come over and just then then let it go right on her face.

1166
01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.330
That's what kills you is a comic.

1167
01:05:59.570 --> 01:06:03.740
It's the thing you should have said or the thing you could've done afterwards.

1168
01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:05.090
Um,

1169
01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:08.360
but I really think that that to me that is one of like when I used to listen to

1170
01:06:08.361 --> 01:06:10.550
the Richard Pryor albums and stuff when I was growing up,

1171
01:06:10.551 --> 01:06:12.560
like one of the coolest things ever was,
you know,

1172
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:16.460
listening to him going back and forth and is unbelievable special.

1173
01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:19.790
They did down in Long Beach where they had him go on early.

1174
01:06:19.791 --> 01:06:23.150
He just wanted to get out there and people hadn't gotten back to their seats.

1175
01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:27.320
Like,
I really felt like that interaction there,
it was like,
it,

1176
01:06:27.321 --> 01:06:31.370
it just put them in this zone and he just stayed in there for like an hour and

1177
01:06:31.371 --> 01:06:32.420
18 minutes.

1178
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:36.890
And I think with that type of shit and the guy going up with the camera and

1179
01:06:36.891 --> 01:06:40.940
stuff,
I like no security.
I really feel like that.

1180
01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:42.330
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1181
01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:45.480
<v 0>You know,
that interaction with the crowd,</v>

1182
01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:51.210
you know,
that energy that they were giving them.
I think that that's what,

1183
01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.490
why that that specialist,
what it is.

1184
01:06:55.940 --> 01:07:00.170
So I'm not against tackling or anything like that,
but I,
you know,
every comic,

1185
01:07:00.171 --> 01:07:02.350
like I said,
you know,
if they feel like it's crossing the line,

1186
01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:05.600
he just feeling it's at that tipping point and I got the chop the head off

1187
01:07:05.601 --> 01:07:09.240
somebody sometimes you got to do that.
So good for her.
All right.

1188
01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:13.550
Emotionally cheating.
Uh,
Hi Bill,

1189
01:07:13.610 --> 01:07:16.880
a big fan of your stand up in the standup in the MLM podcast.

1190
01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.730
I wanted to get your advice on our relationship question.

1191
01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:23.540
I got married to my wife last year in September,

1192
01:07:23.541 --> 01:07:26.480
who I've known for 10 years.
Um,

1193
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:30.650
prior to tying the knot at the start of this year,
my wife,
age 30,

1194
01:07:30.651 --> 01:07:34.520
admitted to me that she has been emotionally cheating.
Jesus.
She told you,

1195
01:07:34.521 --> 01:07:35.570
why did she tell you?

1196
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:37.280
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1197
01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.220
<v 0>As far as I know,
no physical cheating on me,</v>

1198
01:07:40.221 --> 01:07:44.930
which started a couple months prior to us getting married with their 51 year old

1199
01:07:44.931 --> 01:07:49.670
coworker who's a divorcee with two kids.
What?

1200
01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:52.400
I was completely blind,

1201
01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:57.710
he said cited it's blind sided,
not sighted,

1202
01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:02.450
blindsided and in and in shock.

1203
01:08:02.451 --> 01:08:04.340
When she told me this about a month ago,

1204
01:08:04.341 --> 01:08:07.640
she told me she needs to go find herself.

1205
01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.030
Oh yeah.
She okay.

1206
01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:16.060
And it has recently moved out into her own apartment and we are separated.

1207
01:08:16.101 --> 01:08:18.950
Most likely headed towards a divorce.
That's why she told you,

1208
01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:21.410
thankfully we do not have any kids together.

1209
01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:26.620
My Dad keeps telling me to try and woo her back and work out our marital issues.

1210
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.280
Even if I could do that,
I'm not sure.

1211
01:08:28.281 --> 01:08:32.000
I want someone who has betrayed Merrill Lynch trusts and scarred me in such a

1212
01:08:32.001 --> 01:08:36.050
way.
What do you think,
uh,
looking forward to season two is f efforts for family?

1213
01:08:36.051 --> 01:08:38.260
Keep up the good work and go fuck yourself.
Um,

1214
01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:44.740
I think you're in a great position.
You should stay there,
dude.
Fuck this.
Okay.
Um,

1215
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:51.410
you've known him for 10 years.
She's 30,
so you met a real young,

1216
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:56.720
she didn't get to go out and go do everything that she wants to do and uh,
yeah,

1217
01:08:56.721 --> 01:09:00.230
dude,
I would walk away,
you know,
if you guys are roughly the same age too,

1218
01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:04.100
you still got a lot of time and I would,
you know,
uh,

1219
01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:07.880
she did you a huge favor.
Just look at it that way,
dude.
Okay,

1220
01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:12.590
football season's here.
Get the NFL package,
you know,
start hitting the gym.

1221
01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:16.940
Just get on with your life,
man.
That's what I would honestly do.
And just,

1222
01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:21.500
you know,
get yourself in a great positive head space.
You don't have any kids.

1223
01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:24.320
She was upfront and honest.
She's 30,

1224
01:09:24.330 --> 01:09:28.670
she's fucking got a tongue hanging out about some 51 year old.
I Dunno,

1225
01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:33.710
that's fucking weird to me.
But I'm also a guy.
Um,
uh,
let it,

1226
01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:38.190
let it go.
Math,
you don't,

1227
01:09:38.191 --> 01:09:40.960
when you let a fish run on the line,
maybe tired out that just,

1228
01:09:40.961 --> 01:09:44.410
I would literally throw the whole rod and the water.
Just let that one get away.

1229
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:48.260
Cut the line.
Fuck that.
Like I said,
um,

1230
01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:55.000
oh fuck that dude.
Go travel.
Go to Europe.
Go do something.
I Dunno.
Go.

1231
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:57.770
Yeah,
you don't,
you don't need that shit in your life.
Thank God.
You know,

1232
01:09:57.771 --> 01:10:01.520
I actually felt relieved once I was reading that we're going to go to the end,

1233
01:10:01.521 --> 01:10:03.290
that you guys are going to get divorced.
You don't have any kids.

1234
01:10:03.291 --> 01:10:06.320
That's fucking great,
dude.
You're in a great position.
Don't listen to your dad.

1235
01:10:06.321 --> 01:10:09.320
He's probably old school.
It's a hell of a thing for me to say.

1236
01:10:09.321 --> 01:10:12.710
I don't know your dad,
but I just,
you know,
all people are,

1237
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:17.250
they're always in a dead.
Work it out,
blah,
blah,
blah.
You know.
Fuck that.
Um,

1238
01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:21.170
I,
yeah,
football season,
yet

1239
01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:27.290
you don't get yourself a kegerator.
Just don't get fat.
You know,
like me.

1240
01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:31.280
All right,
the Unicorn.
Uh,
I'd love your feedback slash advice on this.

1241
01:10:31.281 --> 01:10:35.980
I recently met a very sweet,
smart and attractive lady.
Uh,

1242
01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.120
we've been texting back and forth for a few days,

1243
01:10:38.121 --> 01:10:40.520
getting to know each other and eventually got to the,

1244
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:44.790
how many people have you slept with?
Question.
Okay.

1245
01:10:44.791 --> 01:10:49.791
I was upfront and honest and told her my number and when it was her turn,

1246
01:10:50.011 --> 01:10:54.420
she told me she was a virgin.
That's right.
She's a unicorn.

1247
01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:57.420
I never heard that expression,
but it doesn't stop there.

1248
01:10:57.421 --> 01:11:02.220
She went on to tell me she's never had a boyfriend.
Keep in mind she's 21.

1249
01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:06.720
Okay.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm old school and love that she's a virgin,

1250
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:11.250
especially in this world of full of who was,
but it's still weird.

1251
01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.720
Um,
Jesus pleasing.

1252
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:18.600
You just called every other woman out there basically who gives sex whores and

1253
01:11:18.601 --> 01:11:20.400
then she's weird.
All right.

1254
01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:24.660
We went on the first date a few days later and she lived up to my expectations.

1255
01:11:24.661 --> 01:11:28.110
She was hot,
smart,
funny,
and I had a great time.
My question is,

1256
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:32.250
how is it possible that the smoking hot and seemingly perfect girl is a virgin,

1257
01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:35.370
let alone has never had a boyfriend?
I'm not complaining,

1258
01:11:35.371 --> 01:11:39.720
but I'm wondering if she's lying or if there's something that I don't see.

1259
01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.220
Well,
I mean I think you're going to physically,
you're going,

1260
01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:44.400
I think you're going to,
you know,

1261
01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:49.170
once she played softball and the ball took a weird hop.
Right.
Um,
wait,

1262
01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:50.490
whose story was that?

1263
01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:56.970
Oh my God,
that just popped into my head.
There was a comic from way back when.

1264
01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.260
I don't even think she does it anymore.

1265
01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:04.580
You said tell a story on stage about how she's playing some sport and it's got

1266
01:12:05.041 --> 01:12:08.610
hit and broke her hymen.
Um,

1267
01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:14.220
oh fuck.
I don't know what to tell you dude.
He said,
what's he saying?
You know,

1268
01:12:14.221 --> 01:12:17.040
I don't want to get into something with her.

1269
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:18.900
And then finally she's a crazy or worse.

1270
01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:22.590
Thank you for the feedback and as always,
go fuck yourself self do what?

1271
01:12:22.591 --> 01:12:26.100
Just keep dating her and just see how it goes.
If she's fucking nuts,
walk away.

1272
01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:27.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1273
01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.800
<v 0>If she is great.
I mean,
21 that's a little older,
but I mean,</v>

1274
01:12:31.801 --> 01:12:36.310
it's not like 31,
you know,
26,
27,

1275
01:12:36.311 --> 01:12:37.840
that's when you starting to go like,
you know,

1276
01:12:37.930 --> 01:12:40.600
but someone could just be really fucking walled off,

1277
01:12:40.601 --> 01:12:45.280
really could've had overbearing parents or whatever.
Um,
I don't know.

1278
01:12:45.281 --> 01:12:49.090
She kind of really let you in and told something really intimate about herself.

1279
01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:52.090
Um,
you're,

1280
01:12:52.330 --> 01:12:55.480
you're in a spot where you're waiting for the other shoe to drop.

1281
01:12:55.481 --> 01:12:58.330
So if I was you,
I'd be asking myself,
why am I asking that?

1282
01:12:58.630 --> 01:13:00.430
Who did I date before this?

1283
01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:03.730
That's making me think that this is going to be an absolute shit show.
Now,
look,

1284
01:13:03.731 --> 01:13:07.030
I would be lying to you if I,
if I said that.

1285
01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:08.533
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1286
01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:12.070
<v 0>You know,
if someone was smoking hot or something like that came up to me,</v>

1287
01:13:12.071 --> 01:13:14.110
I would think at some point someone would have talked to her in,

1288
01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:18.550
to the rack by 21 nowadays,
but 21 isn't that old.

1289
01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:23.470
Um,
I say,
write it out.
It's a good enough situation.

1290
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:27.460
See what happens.
And a,
if you're worried that she's a psychologist,
you know,

1291
01:13:27.461 --> 01:13:29.110
just don't get to fucking a,

1292
01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:31.653
<v 1>you know,</v>

1293
01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:35.180
<v 0>crazy.
And like with the chick and then,
you know,
after a while,</v>

1294
01:13:37.410 --> 01:13:40.380
I dunno,
maybe could actually have a conversation with her at some point.

1295
01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:43.330
Don't be so blunt.

1296
01:13:43.331 --> 01:13:47.010
Like how how's some fucking chickens hard is you never had a dick in her.

1297
01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:48.760
And we don't say it like that.
Just be like,

1298
01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:50.400
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1299
01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:53.350
<v 0>I dunno.
You know what,
don't listen to me.
Don't fucking bring that up.
I,</v>

1300
01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:55.380
but I would continue to see her if you having a good time.

1301
01:13:55.381 --> 01:14:00.360
I would continue to see her and um,
you know,

1302
01:14:00.361 --> 01:14:01.380
if you're really concerned,

1303
01:14:01.381 --> 01:14:05.070
I would just hide the knives in your kitchen the first time she stays over,

1304
01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:07.073
<v 1>you know,</v>

1305
01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:10.110
<v 0>let's make sure the bats on your side of the bed.
It's really,</v>

1306
01:14:10.111 --> 01:14:14.380
think this is going to be a problem,
but a,
that's if she even gets in the bed.

1307
01:14:14.381 --> 01:14:19.060
So we'll see.
Um,
all right.
That's it.
That's a podcast for this week.

1308
01:14:19.230 --> 01:14:23.410
I apologize for it being a little bit late,
but,
um,
you know,
whatever.

1309
01:14:23.411 --> 01:14:26.440
I figured most of you had the fucking day off.
All right.
All right.

1310
01:14:26.441 --> 01:14:27.370
Go fuck yourselves.

1311
01:14:27.371 --> 01:14:31.600
I'll check in on Thursday when I'll be in beautiful Charleston,
South Carolina.

1312
01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:31.990
All right.
