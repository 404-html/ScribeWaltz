00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.640

Huh?
All right.
Come on.
You moved out.
All right.

7
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.360
Your parents aren't there anymore to picky up.

8
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.930
Dust you off and make you a little fucking ham sandwich.
Maybe PB and j,

9
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.190
whatever it was.
Huh?
They're not there anymore.

10
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.720
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.830
<v 1>Okay.
Can you were on your own,</v>

12
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.940
just time for you to toughen the fuck up.

13
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.800
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.340
<v 1>Go home to your apartment and you can have a little cry.
Um,</v>

15
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.390
I know what I'm talking about.
Ah,
I'm in New York City here.

16
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.890
I'm getting ready for a couple of shows here in the New York comedy festival.

17
00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:05.060
I'm doing the Goddamn comedy jam tomorrow.
And uh,

18
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.690
and then I'm doing my Gig,
um,
down the street.

19
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:12.140
They had the garden on Saturday and then that's it.
Oh,

20
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:17.000
Billy red face itch.
The holiday season.
Dooby dooby Doo.

21
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:18.800
I'm already mentally drinking eggnog.

22
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.660
This is my last two fucking road gigs of the year.

23
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.140
And uh,
then,
uh,
basically I am in town,

24
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.740
I'm in La and I get to hang with my dog,

25
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.460
my beautiful wife just fucking chill out.

26
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.750
And you know what I'm going to be doing?

27
00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:40.250
I'm going to the gym every day cause I been eating like a fucking animal.

28
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I just been it fucking eat like an animal,
but it's not bad.
I'm on,

29
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.300
I'm probably like a buck 75 or something as opposed to being up close to a buck

30
00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:50.750
90.
So I'm stopping it right here.
It stops today,

31
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.050
um,
before it gets too out of control and a,
I'm going to go back down again.

32
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.370
So,
um,
that is my goal.
But who gives a fuck about that?

33
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:05.480
So I know what you gotta be thinking.
You know that I'm a fucking sports fan.

34
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.130
You know that I love the dimpled wondered Tom Brady,
right?

35
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.570
Old Chin dimple himself.
You gotta be thinking,
well,

36
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:17.571
Bill Tom Brady and the fucking New England patriots are playing the New York

37
00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:22.631
football giants on Sunday was all fucking Eli manning the football gods,

38
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:24.500
right?

39
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.200
<v 3>Hello.
Eli fumbles the ball.</v>

40
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.280
It bounces right back and do his own head.
He throws up

41
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.190
a giant catches up.

42
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.690
Dennis Act called touchdown giants.
Oh my God.

43
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.260
Thank God.
I say Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

44
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.060
<v 1>All right,
we're playing him.
Eli Fades back to pass.</v>

45
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:54.710
He throws his arm back,
the ball comes out of his hand,
goes off the refs Dick,

46
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.190
back to fucking Eli.

47
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.880
<v 3>It's a down the field without luck.
Touchdown.</v>

48
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.310
<v 1>Um,
I get booked.
Some dumb reason.</v>

49
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.110
I'm going to go to this game.

50
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.860
Football Gods Love Eli Manning.

51
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.470
I'm not saying he's not a fucking great quarterback.

52
00:03:15.471 --> 00:03:18.500
The Mat is just draws a hell of a fucking bolt,
but I'm just saying

53
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.690
<v 3>Eli fades back to pass and it sac for a loss.</v>

54
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.740
There's a flag on the field.

55
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.810
Personal file gives a giants a first down

56
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.890
Eli page,
back to pass.
Here comes the rush.
She rolls up,

57
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.290
he throws a duck.

58
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.500
The quarterback Ms Times is lands on his head,
cats and got cash.

59
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.983
<v 0>Okay,</v>

60
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.140
<v 1>I'll tell you Mike,
boy,
I'm going to the fucking game.</v>

61
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.870
I just want to see how the fuck he's going to beat assist type.

62
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.650
<v 0>Okay.</v>

63
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.230
<v 1>It's not going to be just a regular fucking play.</v>

64
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.640
<v 0>Okay?</v>

65
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.270
<v 3>Anytime.
Hey,
Eli fades back to pass,
throws it to us.</v>

66
00:04:09.271 --> 00:04:13.230
Sunday Samuel hits him in both his head dead,
eight drops.

67
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.820
How does he like doing?
Hey,

68
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:21.250
throw interception and it was dropped.

69
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.820
<v 1>Um,
nightmares.
Nightmares or this guy.
So I'm just wondering how the fuck,</v>

70
00:04:26.821 --> 00:04:29.110
what weird God damn way are we going to lose

71
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.300
it is one of the great things about sports.
I mean,

72
00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:34.950
what are the fucking odds that when we filed,

73
00:04:34.951 --> 00:04:38.070
we're going to fucking play him again?
It's The Sunday night game.

74
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.790
Everybody wants to see it and we're going to begin to feed it just like we were

75
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:46.110
when we were 18.
And,
all right,
it's going to be fucking tremendous.

76
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:48.300
And I'm going to go there and I'm going to root for the Patriots,

77
00:04:48.301 --> 00:04:52.080
but I'm not going to be an asshole.
I'm not wearing any patriots paraphernalia.

78
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.310
I mean,
certainly not this one.
It gets so much fucking shit.
But I,
I would,
I,
yeah,

79
00:04:56.311 --> 00:04:58.380
you're right.
You guys fucking own us.
What do you want from me?

80
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.690
I'm hoping it turns around today,
but I'm calling it right now.
Okay.

81
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.410
I don't know how long he liked and have that horseshoe up his ass,

82
00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:08.820
but at some point the fucking,

83
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.110
the slippers got to turn into a pumpkin or whatever the fucking fairy tale is

84
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.390
some fucking point.
The lox got a swing our way.
Right.

85
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.240
So anyways,
I'm going to that game.
I'm actually really looking forward to it.

86
00:05:21.241 --> 00:05:23.640
I haven't been to the new giants stadium and uh,

87
00:05:23.641 --> 00:05:26.400
as I told you guys for a long time,
I have actually a closet,

88
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.050
a New York giant fans.
I like all the defensive teams,
you know what I mean?

89
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.190
And uh,
I love the giants linebackers in the,
uh,

90
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.560
eighties.
I wasn't a big film McConkie Fan.
He just got a little bit too excited.

91
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.520
I thought he stole John Oates look.
And uh,

92
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.760
I dunno that I knew he wanted to score a touchdown and Bavaro picks him up and

93
00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:52.430
spins him around like they were a couple of figure skaters.
I mean,
I just,

94
00:05:52.431 --> 00:05:55.550
I just wasn't into it.
I liked the viral though.
Um,

95
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.740
<v 0>okay.</v>

96
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.220
<v 1>But Harry Carson,
was it Brad Van Pelt?</v>

97
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.970
I liked Eileena there.
There that's,
but that's fucking football history man.

98
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.170
You're going back to those.
I like those old NFL teams though.

99
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.010
Cleveland Browns,
Cleveland Rams.

100
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.120
Um,
the packers,
right.

101
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.240
The old school shit colts when they were in Baltimore.

102
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.910
You know what sucks about the NFL.
They do everything pretty much.
Right.
Um,

103
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.280
I don't,
I the last few years,

104
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:30.500
so with all this pink shit in the fucking military stuff,

105
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:35.420
just making money hand over fist on cancer in war,
it's just a little weird.

106
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.943
Um,

107
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.300
but I just wish that they would talk about the old NFL more.

108
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.870
They never taught.
All the other sports really seem to respect the history.

109
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:49.871
And for some reason the NFL acts like nothing really happened prior to the NFL

110
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:55.140
and the AFL merger and that it became the Superbowl error.

111
00:06:55.141 --> 00:06:57.290
And it just seems like everything is just about that.

112
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.980
You get a little bit of Jim Brown,
he get a little bit of cults,
giants,

113
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:05.670
Yankee Stadium,
greatest game ever played.
Um,
you know,

114
00:07:05.671 --> 00:07:09.390
a little Dick Butkus Gayle Sares and of course the packers.
But I mean that,

115
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.680
that's it.
You get nothing.
You get nothing.

116
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.940
You fucking watch baseball.
Every time he put on fucking baseball.
This saint boy,

117
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.500
oh boy.
And I went to Ebbets field and holy macrolide to dodge some trolleys.

118
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.730
That's why they're the Dodgers to trolley Dodgers.
And we went there and boy,

119
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.240
oh boy,
Babe Ruth came down.
They always fucking talking about it,
right?

120
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.630
Hockey's forever show in Montreal.

121
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.950
Canadiens rocket Rashard that bumble motherfucker,
whatever his name is,

122
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.020
Toronto Maple Leaf Gardens.

123
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:44.021
Everybody shows the old shit night basketball show the fucking Celtics run

124
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:48.320
around.
But granted,
that's the same fucking period,
right?
Is a super.

125
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:51.530
For some reason the NFL just acts like that doesn't exist.

126
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.390
They don't count the NFL championships,
thus making the Steelers,

127
00:07:56.391 --> 00:07:57.260
the Yankees,

128
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.580
Canadian Celtics have a football rather than the packers who it should be.

129
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.000
You know,
Bill,
you've presented this argument numerous times and nobody cares.

130
00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:06.950
All right?
It's just something I was talking about.

131
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.020
Let's talk about some dumb shit.
Let's talk about those Starbucks cups.

132
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.770
They used to have like snow flakes and reindeer on them.
Um,

133
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.570
I actually understand why people were fucking offended by that.
You know,

134
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:21.620
it's fucking annoying.

135
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:26.650
I don't understand how religion can be offensive and it's not even the religion.

136
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.590
Right.
But it kind of is because that Santa Claus Shit,

137
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.530
that's the shit that Christians tell their kids.

138
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:39.080
You know Santa Claus,
you know,
you,
Oh,
you better watch out.
You better not cry.

139
00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:43.880
You better not pout.
I'm telling you why Santa Claus is coming to town.

140
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.830
He has some silver bells.
He has some mistletoe,

141
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.350
he's riding along in a one horse open sleigh for goodness sake.

142
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.340
Oh,
Dasher,
dancer,
prancer and vixen,

143
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.950
Johnny Mathis and something else.
Um,

144
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.090
yeah,

145
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.030
that's what you tell your kids before you're ready to tell them the real made up

146
00:09:08.031 --> 00:09:12.800
story about a Jesus died for your sins.
And I just don't understand.

147
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.280
Like somewhere along the line,
what should somebody want?

148
00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.970
Merry Christmas became like offensive.

149
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.760
Like if somebody said to me,
you know,
happy Hanukkah,
happy Kwanzaa,

150
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:27.710
I wouldn't be looking at clinician.
That's offensive.
Don't say that to me.

151
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.260
She fucking religion.
It's what you say around the holidays.

152
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.890
I don't have a problem with it.
Well,
you get so fucking politically correct.

153
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.190
You can't even have a fucking snowflake in a rain day or on it

154
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:43.750
because some poor baby has a fucking menorah or a fucking whatever the fuck else

155
00:09:43.841 --> 00:09:47.270
you got going on this time of year and it gives a fuck put on manure on it.

156
00:09:47.271 --> 00:09:48.290
I don't give a shit.

157
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:50.020
<v 0>Okay.</v>

158
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.190
<v 1>Can you imagine that?</v>

159
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.420
Can you imagine being so fucking childish that you've fucking,

160
00:09:55.810 --> 00:10:00.460
if there's a god Damn Cup in it and they got some fucking Christmas shit from a

161
00:10:00.461 --> 00:10:01.271
different religion,

162
00:10:01.271 --> 00:10:05.020
that for some reason that ruins your experience going to a coffee house to the

163
00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:08.890
point that they have to change the cup.
It's not that it's a Red Cup.

164
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.310
It's not that they,
whether they have it or not,
it's why they change it.

165
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.970
I think if that's even the fucking story,
that's as far as I could tell,

166
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.400
and I gotta be honest with you,

167
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:22.470
like stories like that is when liberals love to come out with this smug fucking

168
00:10:22.511 --> 00:10:24.900
looks on their faces,
you know,

169
00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.260
like dead fucking broad there that dancers around and shit,
she is big.

170
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.800
It should to cut bitch.
It's a cup,
whatever,
you know,

171
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.710
it's just a zillion fucking people that are of that religion,

172
00:10:35.711 --> 00:10:38.530
that kind of like the little snowflake in a ranger.
Yeah.
Fuck all of them.

173
00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.980
Fuck all of them.
But this fucking guy over here becomes a woman.

174
00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:44.860
Then all of a sudden everybody's supposed to fucking,
you know what I mean?

175
00:10:44.861 --> 00:10:48.160
It doesn't make any sense.
They're all about like,

176
00:10:48.161 --> 00:10:52.030
if one person has a fucking problem,
then they're like,
oh,

177
00:10:52.031 --> 00:10:55.870
everybody needs to stop.
But if everybody's into one thing,
they're like,
yeah,

178
00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.840
fuck you.
One thing,
I don't understand that math on it.

179
00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:00.940
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

180
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.630
<v 1>Ketchup.
You respectful to everyone.
Um,</v>

181
00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:06.520
I probably missed the whole point of that fucking story,

182
00:11:06.521 --> 00:11:08.500
but as far as I realize that people,
you know,

183
00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:13.000
they took off snowflakes and reindeers because somebody in fucking,

184
00:11:13.001 --> 00:11:18.001
I don't know where bitched that the cup hurt their feelings last Christmas.

185
00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.740
Is that what happened?
You know,

186
00:11:20.741 --> 00:11:23.170
Bill kind of helps if you actually know what the story is before you have a

187
00:11:23.171 --> 00:11:27.520
strong point of view on it,
or at least allowed point of view,
oh fuck you,

188
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.380
fuck you in the holiday season.

189
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.320
I'm just glad I don't fucking drink coffee.
What a fucking waste of time that is.

190
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.300
You know what I mean?
I'm not saying it's not delicious.

191
00:11:40.301 --> 00:11:43.450
Once you get over how bitter it is and you've got to pour a pound of fucking

192
00:11:43.451 --> 00:11:44.284
sugar in it.

193
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.620
I'm just saying the amount of times you just see people standing in these

194
00:11:47.621 --> 00:11:51.310
fucking lines at the airport or outside of Starbucks and you like,

195
00:11:51.311 --> 00:11:54.710
is Bruce Springsteen in there?
Is he playing that coffee house?

196
00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:58.610
Cause that's the only fucking reason you could ever explain standing in a line

197
00:11:58.611 --> 00:12:02.000
that fuck fucking long to be like,
let me get a Frickin Frappe,
a Copa Mocha,

198
00:12:02.001 --> 00:12:06.830
whatever the fuck you guys get junkies.
Do you understand that?

199
00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:11.540
I wouldn't stand in a line like that for beer liar.
I've done it at games.

200
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.680
At least they get a good buzz going.
Right.
Well I guess coffee is a drug too.

201
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.900
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

202
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.570
<v 1>Geez.
I'm just really destroying all my opinions here this week.
Right?</v>

203
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.670
You guys don't even need to do it.
I always feel bad for those,

204
00:12:23.671 --> 00:12:25.710
but I don't feel bad for him.
She's like,
why like that?

205
00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:27.270
That alone would be enough to quit.

206
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:29.383
<v 4>You know what I mean?</v>

207
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.620
<v 1>Speaking of which I'll read face said he was done with cigars and I think I am.</v>

208
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:35.911
I just fucking,

209
00:12:35.911 --> 00:12:40.080
I just can't deal with that the whole next day and my mouth tastes like a

210
00:12:40.081 --> 00:12:45.000
fucking ashtray.
I oded on them.
I'm done.
So,
um,

211
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:49.820
last night I was actually a,
Oh,
you know what I did this week?
I was,
oh,

212
00:12:49.821 --> 00:12:53.360
Billy Broadway.
I was here in New York.
And uh,

213
00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.220
I never go to Broadway shows because I think they stink.
You know what?

214
00:12:57.221 --> 00:12:59.960
I want to see a bunch of lions running around talking to cats and then singing a

215
00:12:59.961 --> 00:13:02.580
song about it.
Right?
Why,
why would I want to do that now?

216
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:07.390
Like I think that they stink.
I just,
um,
I know,

217
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.710
but everybody's singing and dances maybe just reminds me of what a pessimistic

218
00:13:10.711 --> 00:13:12.270
cunt I am.
So I have a hard time sitting there.

219
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.333
<v 4>Right?</v>

220
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.580
<v 1>But I'll go see a play if a play is good.
Plays a Batman.</v>

221
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.210
Back in the day somebody said,
hey man,
I want you to go to a play.
You're like,

222
00:13:22.211 --> 00:13:25.660
oh my God,
I'd rather hit your band play,
you know,

223
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.060
fucking horrific.
Right.

224
00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:31.510
But I've actually seen some really good ones on a Tuesday night.

225
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.130
I went to go see fool for love,
which is a Sam Shepard play.

226
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:41.350
I hope I say this name right.
Starring Nina Arianda and Sam Rockwell.

227
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.700
And,
um,
I know what you guys are thinking like,
oh,
Bill,
what do you,

228
00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:48.220
what do you think you're too good for us now you're going to go see a play on

229
00:13:48.221 --> 00:13:51.370
Broadway where you're wearing a scarf.
You fucking pansy

230
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.960
little fucking pocket square.
Um,

231
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.580
I uh,
what did I do?
I went to go see it.
Uh,

232
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:08.640
Sam Rockwell is actually doing a voice of one of the characters Vick on,

233
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.430
uh,
in emphasis for family,
which is coming up December 18th.

234
00:14:12.431 --> 00:14:16.570
Everybody looked for the look for the official trailer coming out sometime in

235
00:14:16.571 --> 00:14:21.340
the next 10 days.
I'm all excited over here.
So,
uh,

236
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.160
you know,
he was in a play and I was like,
I got to go down and go see him,

237
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.440
check it out.
Me and you went there and as always see,
absolutely blew us away.

238
00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:34.890
And I was unfamiliar with a Nina Arianda and she was amazing just to fucking

239
00:14:34.931 --> 00:14:39.130
amazing play.
And uh,
you know what's great too is it's about 70 minutes long.

240
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:44.860
It's a great one to,
to fucking,
you know,
dip your toe in,
you know,

241
00:14:44.861 --> 00:14:47.950
cause even if you're not into it,
right,
you just to be like,
all right,

242
00:14:47.951 --> 00:14:51.070
well it's almost over.
You know,
you can get some booze,
right?

243
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.420
You go with the bear and then you get yourself a little shot,

244
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.740
get a little glow going.
Uh,
no,
it was actually,
it was an awesome time.

245
00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:02.060
And then the next night,
last night I went and I saw a hand to God,

246
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.060
swear to God,
I saw a hand to God.
Uh,

247
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.960
Bob Saget was in that one and he's like,
hey,

248
00:15:08.961 --> 00:15:11.960
why don't you come over and fucking check it out?
And he crushed it.

249
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.570
Bob fucking Sagat destroyed and a sexy,

250
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.940
a show written by a standup comedian as Steven Boyer.

251
00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:23.420
And I was talking to him after the show.
He mentioned that he,
uh,

252
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.410
I guess we did a show together to co,
uh,
comedy store a long time ago,

253
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.160
but everybody in the cast,
Geneva Carr,
Michael Oberholser,

254
00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:33.830
hope he said his last name right.
We're all fucking hilarious.
And uh,

255
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.390
I saw two Broadway plays and I thoroughly enjoyed myself so you know what I'm

256
00:15:38.391 --> 00:15:41.360
doing today?
I'm going to go out and go buy myself a little scarf,

257
00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:42.830
a top hat and a walk.
Walking cake.

258
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.810
Pretend I'm one of them sophisticate silver there.
You know what I'm saying?

259
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.400
Um,
anyways,
self,

260
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.940
I got two more fucking shows.
I'm doing the Goddamn comedy jam tomorrow,

261
00:15:55.941 --> 00:16:00.290
which is sold out 600 fucking people.
All freckles.

262
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:04.010
Better not drop the drum sticks on that night.
Um,

263
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:08.390
it's going to be a great time.
And then on a Saturday,
uh,

264
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.870
when the garden is still empty,
it's going down.
Dude,
I'm going to,

265
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.980
I got a drum kit in there and some of the guys from the comedy jam are going to

266
00:16:15.981 --> 00:16:19.850
come over and a in an empty Madison Square Garden.
We're going to play.

267
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.420
We're going to fucking butchers some songs for a good 90 minutes.

268
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:27.140
And I know what you guys are thinking.
He going to make any video?
Uh,
no I'm not.

269
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.500
No,
I'm gonna.
I'll make a little bit,
but you know,

270
00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.620
I already know I stink as a drummer and I don't need it.

271
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.150
Like reaffirmed a thousand times on social media,

272
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.750
epic,
balding,
freckle,
drumming,
fail.

273
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.890
And I know God damn well it will get more hits than any fucking standup special

274
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.090
I ever put out.
It would hurt my feelings.
I'm allowed to be sensitive.

275
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.570
She has the hobby.
Go Fuck yourself a cake.
Why don't you put up a video?

276
00:16:56.571 --> 00:17:00.310
You make an a ship model in a bottle,
whatever is that you do present.
Oh,

277
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.270
turn around job then go,
I've got it on in the background.
I'm in to hook people.

278
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:10.190
I got a fucking problem now you can't be into hockey and hoop and still have a

279
00:17:10.191 --> 00:17:12.530
relationship.
You know,

280
00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:16.640
you can be single and do that yoga almost gotta be single and unemployed to be

281
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:20.610
able to like that.
To me,
that's the ultimate sports fan.
Somebody that can,

282
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:25.250
that can talk intelligently about Nhl and NBA.

283
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:30.500
Cause both seasons obviously happened simultaneously in his fucking 160 God damn

284
00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.730
games between one hockey team and one basketball team.

285
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.550
So around the fucking league,
I don't know how many games that is,

286
00:17:37.551 --> 00:17:40.460
to actually be able to know what the fuck is going on is pretty,
uh,

287
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:42.530
pretty incredible,
you know,

288
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.480
and obviously I can barely talk intelligently about fucking,
um,

289
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:50.850
Dnhl although I'm getting better because the face off.com I'm telling you,

290
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.420
you got to go to the site.
I was doing it yesterday.
I was watching the blues,

291
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.430
the blues,
and um,
who was it?
The devils.

292
00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.570
I just had this side open head and open to different windows and I had all the

293
00:18:03.571 --> 00:18:08.040
blues on one side and the fucking devil's on the other.

294
00:18:08.041 --> 00:18:10.920
So I knew when that first line was going against their second line and all

295
00:18:10.921 --> 00:18:14.490
that's fucking priceless.
Fucking priceless.

296
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:19.070
Um,
so anyways,
so let me read a little bit of advertising here.

297
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.780
We're about halfway through and a dude,

298
00:18:21.781 --> 00:18:25.920
I gotta to get my ass back to the fucking gym.
Holy Shit.
What a fucking dope.

299
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.300
You know what?
I've given half of it back.
Okay.

300
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.250
And uh,
I got to stop this time cause I always give it,
I give,

301
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:39.180
I always give it all back.
You know,
like a fucking degenerate gambler.

302
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.700
You go down to the Black Jack Table,
right?

303
00:18:41.701 --> 00:18:46.020
And you make all that fucking money and Europe and do you go back to the room

304
00:18:46.021 --> 00:18:49.200
now you keep playing to keep playing.
You gave it all back and then son,

305
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.160
Jesus Christ,
these guys are shooting like shit.
Yeah.

306
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:53.683
<v 4>MMM.</v>

307
00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.840
<v 1>But anyways,
this is the way to watch NBA hoop by the way too.</v>

308
00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.190
You watched the replay,

309
00:19:00.191 --> 00:19:03.850
the fucking blow through it as opposed to the 58 fucking time outs in the end of

310
00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:08.560
the game.
A precinct is to dwell in that,
want to get blown right by.

311
00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.070
I think a lot of people thought he's stunned because he looks like Shawn Bradley

312
00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.130
the fuck.
Give them the fucking ball.
Sorry.
All right.

313
00:19:18.131 --> 00:19:20.770
I'm a stop watch cause I know it's annoying.
Alright,
there we go.

314
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.670
A couple of reads for this week.
Everybody.
Oh,
they're back.

315
00:19:24.671 --> 00:19:28.300
Everybody club.
Debbie.
Tear club.

316
00:19:28.301 --> 00:19:31.840
W Don't you hate it when your wine looks like a 10 but winds up tasting like a

317
00:19:31.841 --> 00:19:35.800
six or even worse when you walk into the store to pick out your wine,

318
00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:39.910
you could easily be fooled into a situation just like this

319
00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.050
sentence always screws me up.
Um,
all right,

320
00:19:44.051 --> 00:19:48.640
well now there's this new wine club club.
Debbie,
Debbie,

321
00:19:48.641 --> 00:19:50.440
a tear my daddy and my dad is proud of me.

322
00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:55.420
Two Term President beat by four years,
they've changed everything.

323
00:19:55.421 --> 00:19:59.170
No more being fooled by wines that pretend to be hotter or tastier than they

324
00:19:59.171 --> 00:20:02.770
actually are.
It's easier,
easy.
It's easy.
Sorry.

325
00:20:02.771 --> 00:20:07.060
You just go to club debbie.com and answer six simple questions.

326
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.510
Their algorithm creates a palate profile just for you.

327
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.610
Then they send wine directly to your door,

328
00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:17.410
perfectly customized to match your tastes.
Glub Debbie,
I could speak Spanish.

329
00:20:17.411 --> 00:20:19.800
Everybody thinks I'm an alcoholic,
but I learned how to do that.

330
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:23.960
Get the evil doers shot.
Fool me once a is Lee,

331
00:20:23.961 --> 00:20:27.040
the leading is leading the grape to glass wine revolution.

332
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.230
They worked directly with vineyards to cut out the middle man,

333
00:20:29.231 --> 00:20:32.950
which saves you money.
So club Debbie as my vice president over there,

she's making all the decisions.
You get premium wine,

347
00:21:25.161 --> 00:21:28.850

348
00:21:28.851 --> 00:21:30.410
quality candidates these days.

349
00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:34.580

360
00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.840

Um,
all right,

361
00:22:20.841 --> 00:22:24.570
let's get back to the podcast here.
The board guest.
Uh,

362
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
so I'm actually gonna meet a friend today for some more high calorie dining for

363
00:22:31.041 --> 00:22:35.900
lunch,
like a fucking dope.
And I had been drinking like a God damn fish.

364
00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:41.020
I went to Sagat show by myself cause my lovely wife was visiting some friends

365
00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.370
and uh,

366
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:48.430
I started off with a Budweiser and a maker's mark and a great way just sipping

367
00:22:49.971 --> 00:22:50.571
along there.

368
00:22:50.571 --> 00:22:53.400
Right as you watched the first you get all the way to the intermission,

369
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.850
he'd go out,
you get yourself another one.
I stayed,

370
00:22:55.851 --> 00:22:57.200
stayed away from the beer though.

371
00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.700
I got me another little makers and I sat there and a dude.

372
00:23:01.701 --> 00:23:04.670
I was fucking glowing the whole show.

373
00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.300
Maybe that's why I enjoyed both of those performances.

374
00:23:08.301 --> 00:23:11.860
Maybe it wasn't the performances.
Do you think it was the booze out?

375
00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.860
It's not true.
May I'm just an alcoholic.

376
00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.150
I know I drink like one,
but the thing is,

377
00:23:19.151 --> 00:23:21.610
the reason why I don't think I'm an alcoholic because I can literally just stop

378
00:23:21.611 --> 00:23:22.520
and be like,
all right.

379
00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:23.890
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

380
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:26.860
<v 1>Then I start back up again.
It's because I crave it now is you know why it is.</v>

381
00:23:26.861 --> 00:23:31.670
It's some fucking bored.
Jesus Christ.
Look at her,

382
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:36.170
my goodness.
The Hornets cheerleaders.
There you go.

383
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.333
God bless him.

384
00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:42.440
One and all four girls and probably make like $11 a fucking game.

385
00:23:42.441 --> 00:23:45.620
Do you know that
out of all the out,

386
00:23:45.621 --> 00:23:49.490
they actually probably make less money than the children that sewed together.

387
00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:52.400
They're fucking mini skirts in the sweatshop and El Salvador.

388
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.680
That's how bad they get fucked over.

389
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:59.600
And then this is big pipe dream that you know when the Charlotte Hornet calendar

390
00:23:59.601 --> 00:24:04.601
or the Vancouver lady connects calendar comes out that they're going to get a

391
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:08.270
piece of it and make all this fucking money.
They don't make any fucking money.

392
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:09.321
Gay.

393
00:24:09.321 --> 00:24:12.680
They heard that cute little feet jumping around doing all the tumble and shit

394
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:15.980
and then they're not allowed to fuck one of the players and maybe getting to his

395
00:24:15.981 --> 00:24:18.710
pockets.
You know what I mean?

396
00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:25.070
It's like
a gold digging.
A whore would look at that.

397
00:24:25.071 --> 00:24:29.330
Like that's just a dead end job.
That's like a cubicle job for a whore.

398
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.330
But these ladies,
you know,
they like cheering on the teams.

399
00:24:32.331 --> 00:24:35.650
They cat to the amount of fucking money that they're not making cause then

400
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.493
unreal.

401
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.500
When did you think that they get at least a couple of hundred bucks a game?

402
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:45.510
You know what I mean?
When you get bed Doo,
Doo,
Doo,
Doo,
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo dude,

403
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:50.090
whatever their fucking saw.
Oh y'all ready for this?
Wang,
Wang,
Wang,
Wang,
man,

404
00:24:50.091 --> 00:24:54.920
whatever the fuck the song is,
right?
Everybody clap your hands to check,
check,

405
00:24:54.921 --> 00:24:55.701
check,
check,
check,
check.

406
00:24:55.701 --> 00:25:00.220
And they'd come out this stomping their little cute feet right there.

407
00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:04.670
Little B Cup,
a cup titties,
right?
It'd be buddies.
Slap your tits.

408
00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.930
And they go and they don't make any fucking money.

409
00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.420
And they sit there and they still smile.

410
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.840
And if they even look at a planning and a lot of watch the fucking gang,

411
00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:19.430
they gotta have the back to the Goddamn game,
right?
And is the thing too,

412
00:25:19.431 --> 00:25:23.320
if one of those players went out one of those plates,
it's that,

413
00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:26.480
that fucking Lou that we used to be on the,
the Nix.

414
00:25:26.481 --> 00:25:27.950
Is he playing with the Hornets now?

415
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:32.240
He's got his fucking hair shooting straight up like that big time.

416
00:25:32.241 --> 00:25:34.760
Hollywood producer wins like an Oscar of you five years,

417
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:40.490
Brendan Glazer Fraser,
and it was fucking name is.

418
00:25:40.491 --> 00:25:41.324
Anyways,

419
00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.440
if one of the players would have go out and fuck all of the cheerleaders,

420
00:25:45.441 --> 00:25:46.340
you know what would happen?

421
00:25:46.341 --> 00:25:50.750
They'd get rid of all of the cheerleaders and that's what needs to stop.

422
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:55.900
I sound like one of those feminists right now.
One of those feminists.
Ladies.

423
00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.790
Ladies,
are you tired of working for men?

424
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:04.160
I use sick of getting paid less money to do the exact same job.
Well,

425
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.610
why don't you get off your cute little ass and start your own business?

426
00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.020
When are you going to wake up and realize that men who don't work for themselves

427
00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.130
are also getting fucked over?
Quit.

428
00:26:14.131 --> 00:26:19.131
She crying and Ugo higher developed brains to get into business with another

429
00:26:19.161 --> 00:26:24.110
broad and then you too can make zillions of dollars.

430
00:26:24.111 --> 00:26:27.710
You too can have your own yacht that youtube can pour the waste from your

431
00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:32.270
business into the drinking water and claim that you had no idea what was going

432
00:26:32.271 --> 00:26:36.370
on.
You too could then have a fall guy.
Huh?

433
00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.240
And you could make it a guy you couldn't unless you think that's unfair to then

434
00:26:41.241 --> 00:26:45.160
make it a fall lady.
I had no idea.

435
00:26:45.161 --> 00:26:47.850
I did not act alone.
Okay.
We put in the back of my car.

436
00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:49.130
<v 0>Ooh.</v>

437
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:53.640
<v 1>Oh this bitch moaning and complaining.</v>

438
00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:58.080
Now I get no sympathy for any of my balding,
redheaded male.
Okay,
go ahead.

439
00:26:58.081 --> 00:27:01.190
Cry me a fucking river.
Oh,

440
00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:04.350
you think you're getting sympathy over here?
Well,
cause it's fucking,

441
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.820
cause it's Christmas time and what's left in my hair is the same color as Santa

442
00:27:08.821 --> 00:27:09.151
suit.

443
00:27:09.151 --> 00:27:11.880
All of a sudden you think you're coming over here and I'm giving out free hugs.

444
00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.740
Doesn't work that way.
I'll tell you right now,

445
00:27:15.741 --> 00:27:17.420
I body slam fucking Hillary Clinton.

446
00:27:17.421 --> 00:27:21.350
If I could write her own fucking pants suit right on a table.

447
00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:23.840
Get with the DD.
Take.

448
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:28.900
I do it just for lying and pretending like you give a shit about people she's

449
00:27:30.171 --> 00:27:32.690
going to get in.
If she gets in,
it's cause she's got a clamp.

450
00:27:32.691 --> 00:27:36.110
I'm telling you right now,
dead,
dead fucking.
It's the only goddamn reason why.

451
00:27:36.111 --> 00:27:37.520
Why?
Why else would you vote for?

452
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.240
Why would you vote for the plumber's wife to come in and fix your sink?

453
00:27:41.241 --> 00:27:42.350
It doesn't make any sense.

454
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.830
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

455
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:51.070
<v 1>You know what I would do if I was abroad,
I'd start my own folly ball league,</v>

456
00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:56.470
you know,
set of trying to get into the NFL.

457
00:27:56.471 --> 00:27:59.710
You don't want to do that shit.
It's run by guys.
You know,

458
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.530
they don't give a shit up to guys.
Beat the shit out of women.

459
00:28:02.531 --> 00:28:05.980
You want to work for those animals.
You want to do,

460
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:10.540
you going to give your talent to those constant,
they can make money off of you.

461
00:28:10.541 --> 00:28:13.690
Fuck that.
Why don't you become the uh,

462
00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.930
foreign or your own sports league?
This is what you do.

463
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:24.270
You pick a fucking sport.
Women are good at like volley ball,
right?

464
00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.570
And it's got the crossover appeal because every guy likes looking at their

465
00:28:27.571 --> 00:28:29.340
fucking thick thighs and their booties.

466
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.880
So we'll be watching to you guys own the fuck and thank you.

467
00:28:32.881 --> 00:28:36.510
Start putting out jerseys right?
Then women go and support it

468
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.300
and then you guys would make great money.

469
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:45.030
Is that fucking Kurt Rambis speaking and getting close line?

470
00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:50.100
It is.
Oh Kurt Rambis size lost it all in the back.

471
00:28:50.101 --> 00:28:53.550

473
00:28:56.041 --> 00:28:57.780
you put them in suits,

474
00:28:57.781 --> 00:29:01.910
Unless the standing next to another eight foot guy,
they really are like,

475
00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.140
they are absolute freaks.
A fucking nature.

476
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.033
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

477
00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.070
<v 1>I remember when I was a kid,</v>

478
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:10.550
if there was somebody just like shot up one year went from like five,

479
00:29:10.551 --> 00:29:13.610
six to six for the dude was tripping over himself.

480
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:15.500
<v 0>Okay.</v>

481
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:15.771
<v 1>That's,</v>

482
00:29:15.771 --> 00:29:18.620
that's what big guys used to be like back in the day and you just stuck them

483
00:29:18.621 --> 00:29:22.370
under the hoop and they put their arms up and you threw the ball up to the

484
00:29:22.371 --> 00:29:25.130
ceiling and they caught it and they turn it around and they stuck it in the net.

485
00:29:25.131 --> 00:29:26.120
Like they're playing a nerf gun.

486
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:27.660
<v 0>Okay.</v>

487
00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.730
<v 1>Not alike.
They're like fucking a,</v>

488
00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:31.460
<v 0>yeah.</v>

489
00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.700
<v 1>Oh,
they're coordinating.
So I can imagine.</v>

490
00:29:34.701 --> 00:29:38.900
They always said they've Lebron James ever played fucking football.
Holy Shit.

491
00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.860
Okay.
It would be the,
if he catch the ball,
which you know,
we can,
right.

492
00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.250
I think he's demonstrated that he has athletic ability to,

493
00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:51.251
that guy would be like the greatest fucking tight end of all time provided he

494
00:29:51.411 --> 00:29:54.440
didn't get his knee blown out.
That's the,
that's the big fucking thing with,
with,

495
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:57.770
with football.
Oh,

Is it a dangerous game?

496
00:29:57.771 --> 00:30:00.800
It takes its toll on your body.
Wow.
We never knew that bill.

497
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.070
Thanks for fucking Shaman in there.
Um,

498
00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.230

Had a lot of good fucking memories on that fucking show.
You know,

507
00:30:33.741 --> 00:30:37.270
I wish it was the way was,
but it isn't,

508
00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.670
but it's still a good fucking time.
Um,

That's it.
Go fuck yourselves.

I can't wait to see,

512
00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:01.420
is he finally going to throw a pick that we hold onto?
Huh?
Oh,
we do.

513
00:31:01.421 --> 00:31:05.020
We have not beat these fucking guys since the last game of 2007.

514
00:31:05.021 --> 00:31:09.070
They've owned us in the Superbowl the pre season,
that season,

515
00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.850
wherever you want to fucking play us.
Wherever we want to play them.

516
00:31:12.851 --> 00:31:16.720
They beat our fucking asses.
These are the only guys.
So,
uh,

517
00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.330
I dunno,
I think,
I think maybe,
maybe.
Does it end now?
I Dunno.

518
00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:22.860
JPP is back.

519
00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:24.190
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

520
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:27.430
<v 1>Which is fucking unreal.
The guys basically playing with one hand.</v>

521
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.550
Do you think it's smart that they wrapped the whole thing up?

522
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.720
What'd you want to lease?
You use a couple of your fingers to grab onto somebody.

523
00:31:34.721 --> 00:31:36.010
I'm not trying to be a dick here,
but I mean,

524
00:31:36.011 --> 00:31:39.190
can I got used a little bit of his hand?
All right,

525
00:31:39.191 --> 00:31:42.140
I'm going to shut up me and we all know,
Bill.
It's,
yeah,
it's a dump thing.
You,

526
00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:42.521
you know,

527
00:31:42.521 --> 00:31:45.850
you know better than the guys who fucking the trainers for the giants on how to

528
00:31:45.851 --> 00:31:46.990
wrap up his fucking hand.

529
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:48.523
<v 0>Okay.</v>

530
00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.940
<v 1>Um,
all right.
That's it.
I overstayed my welcome.
Okay.</v>

531
00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:53.950
And now we're going to play a little bit of music chosen by the,
the,

532
00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.660
the wonderfully talented Andrew [inaudible] and we'll go into a throw back

533
00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:02.870
portion of the Monday morning podcast from a time not too long ago or possibly

534
00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:08.940
up to eight years ago.
Sometimes.
I don't know when to get off.

535
00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:10.260
All right.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye.

536
00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.353
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

537
00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.440
let's talk about it.
Absolutely.

538
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:11.201
<v 1>We fucking,</v>

539
00:33:11.201 --> 00:33:15.770
it enrages me as opposed to everything else that keeps me so nice and fucking

540
00:33:15.771 --> 00:33:19.700
calm.
Um,
somebody sent me a story.

541
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:25.580
This is unfucking believable.
Some guy goes to jail.

542
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:27.560
All right.

543
00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:33.140
For Rape Wasn't this Amanda spent 25 years in prison for a crime he did not

544
00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:38.210
commit.
All right?
He went to jail for,
uh,

545
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.200
for the rape of some woman.
And in 2008,

546
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:45.290
after DNA proved he could not have been the attacker,

547
00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:50.270
he was awarded $4 million compensation.
That's what he got.

548
00:33:50.271 --> 00:33:52.020
$4 million.
Well,
you know,
and,

549
00:33:52.021 --> 00:33:57.021
and sex offenders get treated the worst in prison.

550
00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:03.530
All right?
So that guy,
you know,
let's just say it was just some regular dude.

551
00:34:03.531 --> 00:34:04.670
He's like a fucking,
you know,

552
00:34:04.671 --> 00:34:09.200
construction worker maybe took a couple of karate classes,
whatever.

553
00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:12.710
Now he's in fucking fun to doe.
People want to beat them down.

554
00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:16.040
Somebody is going to try to grape on the stuff we've all seen Shawshank

555
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:16.790
redemption.

556
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:20.810
This is what this guy went through for 25 fucking years and they didn't even do

557
00:34:20.811 --> 00:34:24.020
it.
Don't even fucking do it.

558
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:28.490
So they give the guy $4 million,
he knows something.
Those pieces shit back.

559
00:34:28.491 --> 00:34:32.570
Or mother fuckers are going to come in and tax them and hit them for half of

560
00:34:32.571 --> 00:34:36.080
that.
You know,
that should be taxed fucking free.

561
00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:39.830
But here's where it gets worse.
All right?

562
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:45.650
The Guy Faces a court battle to keep hold of the money he was awarded for his

563
00:34:45.651 --> 00:34:48.920
wrongful conviction.
Um,

564
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:55.270
because now his ex wife who divorced him three years into his life sentence has

565
00:34:56.541 --> 00:35:01.541
taken him to court in a bid to get a share of the $4 million compensation.

566
00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.060
She claims he owes her the money.

567
00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:07.140
<v 6>Okay.</v>

568
00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:12.140
<v 1>That she would have been entitled to had they divorced and shared their assets.</v>

569
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.330
Can you fucking believe this shit?

570
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.800
This guy went to jail for the worst fucking crime.

571
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:24.690
<v 6>Okay.</v>

572
00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:25.590
<v 1>All right.
One of them.</v>

573
00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.350
It's gotta be up there if you want to fucking argue about it.
Right.

574
00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:29.970
<v 6>Okay.</v>

575
00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:33.030
<v 1>He didn't even do it.
He's sitting there going,
honey,
I didn't do this.</v>

576
00:35:33.031 --> 00:35:36.420
She got to stick by my side.
She hangs in there for three years.

577
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:39.130
Go Yourself.
I'm Outta here.

578
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.670
<v 6>Okay.</v>

579
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:45.670
<v 1>What do you think she's with doing for the last fucking 22 years?</v>

580
00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:51.520
As far as I can tell,
besides not working on a career,

581
00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:54.280
she's been out there suck in a whole bunch of other dicks.

582
00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:55.680
<v 6>Okay.</v>

583
00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.910
<v 1>That's what she's been doing.</v>

584
00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.980
So now it turns out that this motherfucker didn't do it.
Okay.

585
00:36:01.981 --> 00:36:04.020
If she stuck by his fucking side.

586
00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:06.360
<v 6>Okay.</v>

587
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.670
<v 1>Stop by his fucking side.
This right here was a Hollywood movie,</v>

588
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:13.270
but she fucking left.
All right.

589
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:18.990
She left it tillers steak and push smelt all that fucking money.

590
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:21.580
All right,
this is what I want to know.

591
00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:26.350
Why is it this fucking show on the view right now?
Oh,

592
00:36:26.351 --> 00:36:29.500
one of those shows with all those ways.

593
00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.870
Why isn't it on those shows?

594
00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:36.370
Why do they constantly show only guys doing shit to women?

595
00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:37.770
<v 6>Okay.</v>

596
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:42.720
<v 1>You know I get it.
Some fucking psycho throws acid on his ex girlfriend.</v>

597
00:36:42.721 --> 00:36:45.930
You got to expose that guy.
You got to teach people about that shit,

598
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.990
but how about a little bit of fair and balanced reporting?

599
00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:50.450
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

600
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:52.220
<v 1>You think they're going to go after this fucking thing?</v>

601
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:56.330
You think that those fucking whores saw this story in the green room.

602
00:36:56.331 --> 00:36:58.820
You think they'd be like,
Oh,
you know what?
Maybe we should talk about this.

603
00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:00.800
They're never talking about shit like this.

604
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:06.350
All they do is talk about when bad shit happens to women and if you,

605
00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.620
if I like this shit here that I'm talking about would come off as fucking

606
00:37:09.621 --> 00:37:14.000
misogynistic hatred towards women.
It's unreal.
Well,

607
00:37:14.001 --> 00:37:18.410
you're taking this isolated,
this isolated incident and then,
you know,
I'm not,

608
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:22.310
this isn't an isolated incident.
Sugar Shane Mosley's getting a divorce,

609
00:37:22.311 --> 00:37:23.840
one of the greatest boxers of all time.

610
00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.380
His ex wife not only taken his fucking money,
all right?

611
00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:31.370
She wants the championship belts too and she was awarded them.

612
00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:35.000
This kind of shit happens all the fucking time.

613
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:41.100
Unfucking believable.
Can you find in after,

614
00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:43.030
you know what the funny thing is she's going to get some money.

615
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:44.800
Should get money out of it.

616
00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:46.210
<v 6>Okay.</v>

617
00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:50.170
<v 1>The same way you hold the door for them,
they don't pay for their fucking drinks.</v>

618
00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:51.760
They turn around and get hammered.

619
00:37:51.761 --> 00:37:55.270
Throw a drink and your face and then the bouncer puts you in a choke hold,

620
00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:59.380
drags you up and then you go to court for disturbing the fucking piece.

621
00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:03.730
And what the fuck does she do?
She,

622
00:38:03.731 --> 00:38:05.850
she's in there feeling justified.

623
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:10.620
Wondering if if you know she has a lawsuit against you cause she dislocated her

624
00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:13.110
elbow when she threw a beer bottle at your fucking head.

625
00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.140
<v 6>Okay.</v>

626
00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:19.040
<v 1>Unfucking believable.
I swear to God,
if I could do life over again,</v>

627
00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:21.800
I would be a judge,
you know?

628
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:23.360
<v 6>Okay.</v>

629
00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.760
<v 1>And I would have a whole briefcase full of hammers because by the end of the
day,</v>

630
00:38:26.761 --> 00:38:31.410
I would throw them at so many of these cunts fucking heads.
Yeah.

631
00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:34.880
Jesus Christ.
You know,
I quit.
And then I would just be,
he hates women.

632
00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:36.920
I would be disbarred within two seconds.

633
00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.000
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

634
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.270
<v 1>Oh,
I would love to be a judge lady.
You might be the most,</v>

635
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:48.390
if I could throw someone in prison for being an absolutely reprehensible,

636
00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.720
incurable fucking money grubbing whore,
it would be you.

637
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:54.740
<v 6>Okay.</v>

638
00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:56.870
<v 1>But I can't,
the law does not allow me.</v>

639
00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:02.380
So why don't you do me a favor in a room full of perverts and scumbags.

640
00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:04.640
You are the worst.

641
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:07.820
So get out of my fucking courtroom and make it a little cleaner.

642
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:13.220
You fucking piece of shit.
I don't know.
This isn't even funny anymore.

643
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.380
This is just absolutely fucking ridiculous.

644
00:39:15.381 --> 00:39:18.830
And what's even more ridiculous is the lack of,

645
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:21.143
<v 6>okay.</v>

646
00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:24.230
<v 1>National exposure.
A story like that's going to get.
So you know what?</v>

647
00:39:24.231 --> 00:39:27.970
So let's keep a tally,
shall we?
We'll start with the sugar.

648
00:39:27.971 --> 00:39:30.280
Shane Mosley something,
you know,
he's going through a divorce.

649
00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:33.400
She also has to get the fucking championship belts.
You know why?

650
00:39:33.401 --> 00:39:36.880
Because they match your fucking shoes or because it's a vindictive move and

651
00:39:36.881 --> 00:39:38.980
she's trying to break a myth,
you know?

652
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.550
<v 6>Okay.</v>

653
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:43.940
<v 1>We'll go with like the lighter ones.
Coby.
Brian's getting a divorce.
Okay.</v>

654
00:39:43.941 --> 00:39:48.020
He's worth 380 million.
That means his fucking wife is going to get 190 million.

655
00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.990
Probably can't hit a lay up on a fucking nerf hoop set,

656
00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:53.953
<v 6>you know,</v>

657
00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:59.550
<v 1>and a bunch of broads will be like,
yeah,
she's entitled to it.
She supported</v>

658
00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:06.340
unfucking believable.
Just robbing these guys fucking blind.

659
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:09.100
What about that God damn yellow diamonds.
He bought her.

660
00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.820
Why don't you go take that down to a pawn shop and live off that for the rest of

661
00:40:12.821 --> 00:40:16.540
your fucking life?
All right there.
Ringless

662
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:19.590
<v 6>yeah.</v>

663
00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:20.760
<v 1>Unfucking believable.</v>

664
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:25.440
How many more men are going to get sliced in half with these fucking,

665
00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:26.970
I just unbelievable.

666
00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:30.300
It's unfucking believable and they don't do any stories about it.

667
00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:31.920
<v 6>Okay.</v>

668
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.820
<v 1>And when you bring it up,
Lo,
you know,
we shouldn't have married her.
Yeah.</v>

669
00:40:36.821 --> 00:40:40.930
She should've ducked.
What if I said that right?
That I'm a fucking asshole.

670
00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:46.990
Ah,
Bill,
where did the Christmas go?
What happened to the holidays?

671
00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:51.790
Joe?
Joe,
fuck,

672
00:40:51.791 --> 00:40:55.930
I can't believe I got to go Christmas shopping.
Unbelievable.

673
00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:00.340
All right,
so there you go.
If you want to look up that story,

674
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:04.930
we actually got that story from a great website called Barstool sports.

675
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:07.810
It's all Boston shit.
Uh,
so just to warn you,

676
00:41:07.811 --> 00:41:11.440
if you're a sports fan of other sports,
uh,
but you know,

677
00:41:11.441 --> 00:41:14.290
they do have stories like this.
All right.

678
00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:15.780
<v 6>Okay.</v>

679
00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:19.650
<v 1>The guy's name's Steven Phillips.
His ex wife is named Tracy trucker.</v>

680
00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:21.920
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

681
00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.030
<v 1>Oh,
what a cunt.</v>

682
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:24.220
<v 6>Okay.</v>

683
00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:28.090
<v 1>Do that as first ballot hall of fame.
Cont right there.</v>

684
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.920
No question.
We're waiving the five year rule.
You're going right in.

685
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:03.763
<v 5>Awesome.</v>

686
00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.700
<v 1>All right,
let's go to advice for the week.
Uh,</v>

687
00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:20.650
advice late at the office wants it.
Okay.

688
00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.920
Hey Bill,
I was wondering if you,
and the lovely Nia,
if she's around,

689
00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:27.040
could help me with an issue I've been having the past couple of months.

690
00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:32.170
It has to do with the fucking lady at work.
Um,

691
00:42:32.171 --> 00:42:36.160
so this girl started at my office a little over two months ago and I've been

692
00:42:36.161 --> 00:42:38.410
training her on basically everything.

693
00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:43.810
So we've been spending a lot of time together Q,
the porno music.
All right.

694
00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:47.500
Um,
now this girl is by no means a smoke show,

695
00:42:47.501 --> 00:42:52.501
but she is cute and she's the type of girl who gets more attractive when he gets

696
00:42:52.601 --> 00:42:55.960
to know her because she's pretty cool.
We have a lot in common,

697
00:42:55.961 --> 00:42:59.830
like musical tastes and we both liked the same beer among other things.
Oh,

698
00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:04.270
so you've obviously gone drinking or at the very least you've discussed,

699
00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.020
you know,
going out and having a few.

700
00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:12.220
You know what's so funny about that sir,
you didn't even think of that question.

701
00:43:12.221 --> 00:43:14.980
You addicted you.
Dick is always closing.

702
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:18.880
Your Dick is always in a two minute offense,
you know,

703
00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:21.490
but you gotta be careful because just like Brett Farve,

704
00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:25.990
it will throw back over the middle for a pick six.

705
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:27.820
And I think that that's what you're about ready to do.

706
00:43:27.821 --> 00:43:32.440
If you start banging some broad at work,
unless you have the skills.

707
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:35.080
Let me finish reading this thing here.
All right.

708
00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:39.160
Our job requires a lot of time on the road.
Oh God.

709
00:43:39.161 --> 00:43:43.090
This is just totally set up.
Our job requires a lot of time on the road,

710
00:43:43.091 --> 00:43:46.660
so we have a lot of time to talk to each other while in the car.

711
00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:52.720
Uh,
you're in the car.
She smells good.
She's crossing her legs.

712
00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.500
How many times he got in a fucking hard on us.
You've been driving with her,

713
00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:01.940
trying to keep up some stupid conversation as you Dick's.
Go and do it.
Do it.
Um,

714
00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:05.580
anyways,
a lot of what we've been talking about is hookup,

715
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:10.150
hookups and sex,
and what we both like and don't like.
Dude,

716
00:44:10.151 --> 00:44:14.350
this is a layup.
You're in there.
And as I could have predicted,

717
00:44:14.351 --> 00:44:17.200
a bit of sexual tension began to arise.

718
00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:20.830
What do you mean you could have predicted,
dude,

719
00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:25.600
don't fucking play this game with me.
All right?

720
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:28.300
You know what?
You're doing

721
00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.940
it a little bit of sexual that you fucking created.

722
00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:38.820
You're steering the conversation towards this.
Exactly like you should be doing.

723
00:44:38.821 --> 00:44:41.980
This is right down the checklist.
By the time I get done reading the show,

724
00:44:41.981 --> 00:44:46.170
probably fucking blow a loner.
You're doing everything you can to fuck this girl.

725
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.131
Anyways.

726
00:44:47.131 --> 00:44:51.540
What didn't help the situation was one day when we admit to each other that we

727
00:44:51.541 --> 00:44:56.090
would bang each other if she didn't have a boyfriend.
Oh Jeez.

728
00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:02.190
Dude,
listen.
Before we go any further,

729
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.120
I totally respect what you're doing here.
All right.

730
00:45:06.121 --> 00:45:09.190
What I don't respect is the way your,

731
00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:13.020
you're telling it to me as if this shit is just happening and you're not

732
00:45:13.021 --> 00:45:17.190
manipulating the situation.
Okay?
You totally manipulate the situation.

733
00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:20.820
This is like tee ball.
This is like pussy tee ball at this point.

734
00:45:20.821 --> 00:45:24.420
It's just sitting right there waiting for you to knock it out of the park and it

735
00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:28.710
was all because of the excellent fucking work that you've done.

736
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:33.390
All right,
I'm going to continue to read this.
All right,

737
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:37.860
but I want to tell you and everybody else don't fucking talk to me like I'm an

738
00:45:37.861 --> 00:45:41.820
idiot.
[inaudible],
you know,

739
00:45:41.821 --> 00:45:43.450
and I had this sexual tension of you,

740
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:47.520
cause we're sitting there talking about banging.
How did you get on that subject?

741
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:52.740
What dumb subject was she talking about as you sat there and sort of fucking

742
00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:57.280
forced the conversation,
you know,
not forced,
cause then she would have no,

743
00:45:57.281 --> 00:46:00.930
you just sort of gradually,
uh,
how did you do it?

744
00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.850
How'd you compliment a shoes or something?
You know,
that's always a good thing.

745
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:07.530
You know what the great fucking way,

746
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:12.660
if you're trying to figure out how to turn the topic to sex and you're,
you know,

747
00:46:12.661 --> 00:46:17.661
you're not in a bar or anything is you actually compliment another woman that

748
00:46:17.701 --> 00:46:21.960
walks by me.
Wow,
there's a beautiful woman I could really,
you know,

749
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:23.610
and women just find that fascinating.
Why,

750
00:46:23.611 --> 00:46:25.470
what do you like about him and blah blah,
blah blah.

751
00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:29.460
And you start with that as a jump off point and then you're in,
you know,

752
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:32.580
and you're in,
you're in.
Okay.

753
00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:35.760
Just don't reach out and grab a titty in a moment of fucking reflects though,

754
00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.830
because then you'll have a problem.
All right,
here we go.

755
00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:40.170
The sexual tension only got worse as we talked,

756
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:44.580
as we talked about it more saying what we would do if we ever hooked up with

757
00:46:44.581 --> 00:46:45.960
each other.
Yeah.
First of all,

758
00:46:45.961 --> 00:46:50.520
this girl does not love her boyfriend and uh,
yeah,

759
00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:55.370
this is,
this is over.
This is like a fucking red shoe diaries at this point.
Uh,

760
00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:58.890
meanwhile when we are in the office,
she calls me from her desk,

761
00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:04.560
from her desk to mine and sends me email trying to Chitchat and shit and

762
00:47:04.561 --> 00:47:09.450
basically flirts hardcore a seat right there,
dude,
right there,

763
00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.020
right there.
You just had a meltdown in the nuclear plant.

764
00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:16.370
It's starting to spill over.
You got to get this girl under wraps.

765
00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:22.200
This is bad to the point where people have asked if there's anything going on

766
00:47:22.201 --> 00:47:26.610
between us.
Uh,
you sloppy.
You're young and you sloppy.
Uh,

767
00:47:26.611 --> 00:47:30.610
when were out of work.
She texts me constantly,
which gets a little annoying,

768
00:47:30.611 --> 00:47:33.100
but I'd be a liar if I didn't like it because I mean,

769
00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:36.010
who doesn't like flirting with an attractive lady?

770
00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:39.100
You told me before that she wasn't really that attractive.

771
00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:42.040
But after a while she starts getting more attractive.
What?

772
00:47:42.041 --> 00:47:47.020
After she says she wants to suck your Dick.
Ah,
fuck.

773
00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:48.461
You know what this is.

774
00:47:48.461 --> 00:47:53.350
This chick is like a virus and she's already contaminated your entire workspace.

775
00:47:53.351 --> 00:47:55.270
This,
this might be beyond my help.

776
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.110
I don't even know where you're going with this.
Anyway,

777
00:47:57.111 --> 00:48:01.120
it's a situation came to a head one Saturday night when she texted me saying she

778
00:48:01.121 --> 00:48:05.680
wants to be drunk,
honest with me.
I literally said,

779
00:48:05.681 --> 00:48:09.700
oh Jesus to myself,
why you created this situation?

780
00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:12.880
And he goes,
and I asked what she meant.

781
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:17.620
She went on to say she wanted to make out with me because she's never felt this

782
00:48:17.621 --> 00:48:18.610
way about someone.

783
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:23.440
And even though she loves her boyfriend who she's about to move in with implants

784
00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:27.610
on marrying,
she doesn't think that making out with me is a big deal.

785
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:31.840
I kind of brushed it off as a drunk text and when she texted me the next day,

786
00:48:31.841 --> 00:48:36.340
I asked her if she had changed her mind and she said no,
and she still wanted to.

787
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:41.860
So I asked,
so I asked you this,
sir,
what the fuck do I do?

788
00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:46.030
I know it sucks to be cheated on because I've been cheated on and I don't want

789
00:48:46.031 --> 00:48:50.410
to do that to this dude because I've met her boyfriend once and he's a good guy.

790
00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:53.050
At the same time,
he's not my friend.

791
00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:58.240
Here's where is dick comes in to argue the other side of it.
At the same time,

792
00:48:58.241 --> 00:49:02.350
he's not my friend and therefore I feel I need,
I,
I need to be loyal.

793
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:05.950
I don't need to be loyal to him by not hooking up with his girlfriend.

794
00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.470
I know it'd be a sleazeball move on my part,

795
00:49:08.471 --> 00:49:12.680
but she's old enough to make our own decisions and she has told me it wouldn't,

796
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:15.490
it wouldn't affect a relationship with him.

797
00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:21.940
Oh Jesus.
Do.
Whether or not she's actually,
that's actually true.

798
00:49:21.941 --> 00:49:25.870
I won't know unless I go through with this and wait for the fallout.
Exactly.

799
00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:30.730
Once again,
she,
she told me she wants to do that.
She wants to,

800
00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:33.910
all she wants to do is make out and not bang,

801
00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:38.740
but I know myself and as a 23 year old guy making out doesn't quite do it for me

802
00:49:38.741 --> 00:49:42.100
anymore.
So I know I'll try to go further.
Let me know what you think.

803
00:49:42.101 --> 00:49:45.400
Thanks in advance.
Love the part Erica.
All right.
All right.
All right.

804
00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:50.800
The question you got to ask,
you need to ask two questions.

805
00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:54.250
How much do you like your job and to,

806
00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.380
can her boyfriend beat the shit out of you?

807
00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.080
Does he have any felony convictions or anything like that?

808
00:49:59.081 --> 00:50:02.950
Because this whole thing is going to blow up in your face.
Um,

809
00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:07.870
this is a confused woman.
She doesn't know what she wants to do.

810
00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:11.830
She does not have be in a relationship.
She's fucking,
she's actually using you.

811
00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:17.680
Um,
and you guys are going to fuck.
You might not fuck the first time,

812
00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:18.670
but she gonna fuck.

813
00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:22.720
And then you're going to fuck on a regular basis unless you decide you don't

814
00:50:22.721 --> 00:50:27.230
want to and it's going to get weird.
This is one of these girls,

815
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.170
no matter what,
it's going to get fucking weird.
So,

816
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:36.230
alright,
I don't know what to tell you here because I don't know all the details,

817
00:50:36.231 --> 00:50:40.730
but the smart move here is to not fuck this woman,

818
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:45.830
okay?
People already know this sexual tension.

819
00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:47.720
So if you know she has a boyfriend,

820
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:51.980
they know she has a boyfriend and you're just going to look like a piece of shit

821
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:55.070
and the whole thing's going to blow up and it's going to be gossip and you've

822
00:50:55.071 --> 00:51:00.071
have any sort of like desire to move up in that country,

823
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:02.060
your country,
that company,

824
00:51:02.061 --> 00:51:07.000
you're really going to fucking screw that aspect of it up.
Um,

825
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.620
there's plenty of fucking women get 23 years old.

826
00:51:09.621 --> 00:51:13.910
You in the prime me of fucking life.
Go out and fuck somebody else.
All right?

827
00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:18.760
And that whole thing there,
you know,
she's got a boyfriend and you know,
blah,

828
00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:23.090
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
I agree with you.
That's not your fucking fault,
okay?

829
00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.680
But the thing about it is,

830
00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:28.850
what makes it weird is you're going to see this girl again the next day and the

831
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:30.890
next day and the next day.
You know what's going to happen is,

832
00:51:30.891 --> 00:51:33.680
you know you're in your head.
You can be like,
yeah,
we just fucking,

833
00:51:33.681 --> 00:51:35.030
cause she said would just fucking,

834
00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:38.450
and she said it isn't a big deal because she said it isn't a big deal.

835
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.380
And you know what?

836
00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:42.830
She's gradually gonna suck you into having a fucking relationship with them and

837
00:51:42.831 --> 00:51:45.380
you're going to have to have to break up with somebody that you're not even

838
00:51:45.381 --> 00:51:48.890
going out with at fucking work and that she's going to make your life a living

839
00:51:48.891 --> 00:51:50.150
hell.
This fucking girl,

840
00:51:50.151 --> 00:51:53.540
not only could she not keep a god damn legs close so you know she can't keep her

841
00:51:53.541 --> 00:51:54.470
fucking mouth shut.

842
00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:57.950
She's going to talk to somebody else and the whole thing's gonna fucking blow
up.

843
00:51:59.020 --> 00:51:59.853
All right,

844
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:05.690
so my advice to you is don't fuck this girl.

845
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:09.590
Have a mature conversation with her and say,
look,

846
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:14.900
it'd be one thing if you were single,
but you're not.

847
00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:19.310
You have a boyfriend.
I feel bad.
I met the guy.
You want to move in with them.

848
00:52:19.311 --> 00:52:22.280
You want to get married?
This is the way you do.
Just sit there.
I just,

849
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:26.930
I really find you attractive.
I would really love to hook up with you,
but I just,

850
00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.880
I can't,
I wasn't raised that way.

851
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:32.930
You just back out of it that way and just get the fuck out of it,
man.

852
00:52:32.931 --> 00:52:33.764
I'm telling you,

853
00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:39.260
unless you haven't been laid in a while and you don't give a shit about your job

854
00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:43.490
than just fucking bang a right on your goddamn desk in front of the security

855
00:52:43.491 --> 00:52:47.320
cameras,

puts your website,

856
00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:48.650

857
00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:58.870
and you know what the fucking come right now face.

858
00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:03.010
Give this dirty whore what she fucking deserves.
You know?

859
00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:09.070
But other than that,
I'm telling you the downfall of men.

860
00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:11.230
It's our dicks.
Dicks.

861
00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:14.680
Get us in more fucking God damn trouble than anything else.

862
00:53:14.681 --> 00:53:19.681
And if you can somehow make a rational decision despite they'll fucking moron.

863
00:53:20.921 --> 00:53:21.341
Shit,

864
00:53:21.341 --> 00:53:26.341
your Dick is saying your Dick is like that diva wide receiver on the football

865
00:53:26.721 --> 00:53:31.130
team screaming for the ball every other play,
you know,
and you know,

866
00:53:31.131 --> 00:53:35.510
God damn well it's double coverage.
Okay.

867
00:53:35.511 --> 00:53:39.050
All you need to do is just fucking wind down the last two minutes of the game.

868
00:53:39.051 --> 00:53:42.350
And as you had fucking Douche screaming at you,
what are you going to do?

869
00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:49.440
You know,
that's a tough one.
That's really a tough one.

870
00:53:49.441 --> 00:53:52.150
But I'm,
you know,
if you're going to break up with a,

871
00:53:52.151 --> 00:53:56.460
just act like you're an honorable human being and just say,

872
00:53:56.461 --> 00:53:58.350
I can't do it because you have a boyfriend.

873
00:53:58.351 --> 00:54:02.820
Just say like you believe it and then get out of it and,
and you watch,

874
00:54:02.821 --> 00:54:05.160
you watch what happens.
Okay.

875
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.910
This is still gonna be fallout to that and it's just,
it just feels like weird.

876
00:54:08.911 --> 00:54:13.830
Like you're not like talking to me any more,
bitch.
Fuck you.
You're psycho.

877
00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:18.930
Okay.
You already have a situation on your hands,
please.
By the,
by the way,

878
00:54:18.931 --> 00:54:22.380
I'm actually invested in this emotionally.
Now.
I want to know what happens.

879
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:26.550
Please let me know if you fucker,
if you don't fuck her.
What happens?

880
00:54:26.551 --> 00:54:30.180
What doesn't happen in all that?
All right.
Um,

881
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:36.310
Jesus Christ,
Jesus grabs a fucking situation.

882
00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:05.210
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

883
00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:12.360

884
00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:13.330
<v 1>Douche bags.</v>

885
00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:19.350
Fucking douchebags trying to get this God damn iPhone for what?

886
00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:25.030
Everybody's going to have one in six weeks.
All right?
They got like fucking,

887
00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:31.260
they got like 20 cargo ships burn off the coast filled with them just,

888
00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:35.680
just in a holding pattern.
Just trying to work up the fucking nerd frenzy.

889
00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:38.950
And what are you doing?
You biting into it?

890
00:55:39.490 --> 00:55:44.440
Go Fuck yourself ghost of Steve Jobs.
Okay?

891
00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:48.210
You want me to buy your phone?
Fuck.
Oh,

892
00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:52.950
put it in the Goddamn store stock.
You're fucking shells.

893
00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:56.560
All right.
When you got plenty of them,

894
00:55:56.561 --> 00:55:59.890
then you fucking call me and I'll go down and get you God damn.

895
00:55:59.891 --> 00:56:02.880
Fuck you mother fucker.

896
00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:07.660
You recently dead,
son of a bitch.
You're going to fucking sit there.

897
00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:11.320
You know it's fucking ridiculous.

898
00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:16.420
I have listened to fucking Bobby Kelly did.
They got plenty of them.

899
00:56:16.421 --> 00:56:20.460
Did go down to the studs and I fucking go down there and they don't have them

900
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:24.170
and they go,
well,
you know,
we released a couple,
uh,
if you can,

901
00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:29.010
if you go to our website,
dude,
fuck your website,
Sarah.

902
00:56:29.011 --> 00:56:30.480
Don't use that language in this store.

903
00:56:30.570 --> 00:56:35.040
This isn't a fucking store store has stuff that I can buy.

904
00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:38.850
I don't walk into a store and then you tell me to go to a computer back at my

905
00:56:38.851 --> 00:56:39.684
house.

906
00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:43.870
<v 7>Right.
This is still a store.
Right?</v>

907
00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:51.130
<v 1>Why don't you fucking call me when you,
when you got the shit that I want.</v>

908
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:53.500
Sit here.
Play your fucking games.

909
00:56:55.310 --> 00:56:56.143
<v 7>You know,</v>

910
00:56:57.220 --> 00:57:01.840
<v 1>I know.
I know that you didn't come up with it with your stupid genius tee shirt.</v>

911
00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:04.070
<v 7>Okay?</v>

912
00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:07.690
<v 1>Yeah.
How much of a fucking discount did they give you on,
on the fucking iPhone?</v>

913
00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:09.380
Futile play ball.
How Seth,

914
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:13.960
for you to sit here and lead people around like this and create this artificial

915
00:57:13.961 --> 00:57:17.620
fucking frenzy for these God damn phones.
Really?

916
00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:20.800
You came out with a new phone and you only made 18 of them.

917
00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:25.030
You fucking cunts.
I'm sticking with the droid.
Hmm.

918
00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.030
I'm sticking with this thing.
You know,

919
00:57:28.031 --> 00:57:31.960
I like the droid cause if you want one you could just walk over and buy it.

920
00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:37.000
I want to hear from any of you can'ts who listen to my podcasts.
Go on.
Yeah.

921
00:57:37.001 --> 00:57:39.690
You just go at,
you just glide year and yet you,
you just preorder.

922
00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:41.080
I'm not fucking doing that.

923
00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:43.203
<v 7>All right.</v>

924
00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:49.780
<v 1>I got too much shit to do during the course of the day to fucking sit here and</v>

925
00:57:50.391 --> 00:57:53.180
start filling out packing lists like I'm working in their warehouse.

926
00:57:53.181 --> 00:57:56.270
I don't work for those assholes down with the I store.

927
00:57:56.330 --> 00:58:01.070
Whatever the fuck you call it.
Fuck them.
Fuck their phone.
Okay,

928
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:04.760
I'm going to get one.
I'm going to go one after the first of the year,

929
00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:09.560
but all you dumb fucks out there who spent way too much money on people.

930
00:58:09.561 --> 00:58:10.640
You don't really give a fuck.
