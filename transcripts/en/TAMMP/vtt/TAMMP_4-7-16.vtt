00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.060
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn is time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.061 --> 00:00:07.830
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast,
Dan.
Huh?

3
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.500
Ah,
just checking in on you.
What's going on?
How are you?

4
00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:18.160
How's your week going?
Are you having a rough one?
Will.
It's okay.

5
00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:22.390
It's almost over stars day.
You know,
don't you hate your boss?

6
00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:26.080
A little less on Thursday.
Eight comes in.
Hey,

7
00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:30.340
go over there and do what I say.
And you're like,
oh,
chubby cheeks.

8
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.030
You know.
Gee,
you love to say that to him.

9
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.450
Just grab his muffin top doll.
Watch Vito dose job doing.

10
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.850
Can you technically get fired for that?
He,
Oh,

11
00:00:46.851 --> 00:00:50.180
you have to do is just when you're going in for the disciplinary meeting,

12
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.040
he just,
you know,
you just stay in the pocket.
Just be luck.

13
00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:59.720
I have no problem doing what this man says,
but I can't fight the fact that,
yeah,

14
00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:03.790
I think he's adorable.
We look at them once.

15
00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:05.780
You want to go up there and give him a little,
you know,

16
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.160
oh well we'll put on a chai day.
Yeah,

17
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.980
that's a fucking great way to get your ass fired.
I don't know.

18
00:01:14.981 --> 00:01:18.190
What if everybody does it though.
You know the strength in numbers.

19
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.080
Is this like a Sally field movie?
Should I be fucking standing up holding a sign?

20
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.950
You know,
union,
right?
So brave.

21
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.830
It was so brave what she did in the mines.
MMM.

22
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.510
Is there any word more overused in the entertainment,

23
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:39.630
specifically the movie acting business then brave.

24
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.950
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.420
<v 1>Jesus fucking Christ.
As any actor ever looked up that fucking word.</v>

26
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.110
The way you went out there with that band,
Dan,
it was such a brave performance.

27
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.020
Not Jesus Christ.
You know,
just cook.

28
00:01:56.021 --> 00:01:58.810
When she'd go over to craft service and get yourself something that has yogurt

29
00:01:58.811 --> 00:02:03.190
in it,
you're fucking stupid.
You know,
courageous,
brave,

30
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.470
important.
This was a story that needed to be told.

31
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.350
Oh my God,
those fucking award shows.

32
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.670
And it never dawns on him the irony that everything we're wearing colluding with

33
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:21.790
the sweatpants and t shirt I have on right now is all made in a sweatshop by

34
00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:26.010
some crying child and fucking three in the morning and check in and wherever

35
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.490
Honduras assumption right.

36
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.730
And they're all up there acting like they give a fuck about people.

37
00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:31.630
It's like you dealt,

38
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.790
you want to go when there you want fucking Ruth buzzy or whatever fucking name

39
00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:39.850
is to say what you're wearing.
Looks good.
You know,

40
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.850
and then you want to win the shiny thing and you want to cry and thank your

41
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:49.110
mother and pretend you're down to earth and go back to your fucking infinity

42
00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:52.350
pool.
That's what you really want to do.
Right.
Do a little fucking,
you know,

43
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.300
you have Jack Nicholson come over and do some blow off your titties.
You know,

44
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.650
if you're a guy,
uh,
you,
who,
who knows what you want to do out here.

45
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.083
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

46
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.310
<v 1>I ain't know what I'm talking about.
You know,</v>

47
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:10.120
I'm just having one of those scatterbrain days and I went to bed early last

48
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.170
night,
you know,
as I always do,
whenever I go on tour with Versie and Bart,
nick,

49
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:18.970
I think all of us like for the next three days have to like dry out and try to

50
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:23.490
get about,
oh,
about 14 hours sleep.
Um,

51
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.450
so yeah,
I'm,
I'm off the booze.
I'm off to cigars.
You know,

52
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:32.290
the usual fucking thing.
I'm all over the goddamn place.
And um,

53
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.270
oh fuck.
You know what?
Somebody told me yesterday,
here's a new thing.
All right,

54
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:42.130
how fucking in this fucking world that just keeps getting more and more creepy.

55
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.910
You know,
that whole big brother thing,
but blah,
blah blah,
blah,
blah.

56
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:50.470
And then people are saying,
oh,
big brother turns out it's actually us.
Um,

57
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.310
and it is,

58
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.540
it is because we're just keep going along with this shit.

59
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.713
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.740
<v 1>Liz is built,</v>

61
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.720
just tell the fucking story before you go on your stupid little rant here.

62
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.830
Alright.
So Buddy might tells me the other day,
right?
He,
uh,

63
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.520
that a friend of his came over to do some work on his house because,
uh,

64
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.120
if you own a house,
you're constantly trying to fix it so it doesn't fall down.

65
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.430
That's what they don't tell you.
You know,

66
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:18.010
when they show the commercial and the real estate commercials,
you know,

67
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.110
a white picket fence,
golden retriever,

68
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.090
your wife had six kids and she's still hot,
right?
There's not,

69
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:29.800
the other song goes anyways,
and they're all running around there.
They're,
uh,

70
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.340
you know,
ridiculously green,
front yard played Frisbee,
you know,

71
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:36.330
the dog's not trying to eat anybody.
The wife's laughing.

72
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.020
The kids are all good looking right,
everything's fine,
right?
Nobody has a list.

73
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.060
Nobody has,
you know,
fucking jealousy issues.
You know,

74
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.890
guy doesn't have dad bod.
He's basically crushing it.

75
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:50.010
They can and you just look at it and you're like,
you know what,
if I,

76
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.370
if I know if I buy a house,
you know,
I know I'm not going to look like that,

77
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:58.450
but is that the mood I'm going to be in?
It's like a drug,
right?
So anyways,

78
00:04:58.451 --> 00:04:59.460
he fucking um,

79
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.100
he fucking has his guys buddy come over and do some work.

80
00:05:05.101 --> 00:05:08.040
So he goes to pay him and is it all good guys do are you don't need to pay him.

81
00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:10.530
You don't even pay me.
And he's like,
no,
come on,
I want to pay it.
Nah,

82
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.270
tell you I'm not going to accept it.
Just take the fucking money.
Right.

83
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.680
They had to do a sketch like that with too polite friends and it ends up in a

84
00:05:16.681 --> 00:05:18.720
knife fight and one person finally kills the guy.

85
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.970
And then fucking stuffs the money in his mouth.

86
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.640
Should they do a sketch like that?
I think they should.
Um,
anyways,

87
00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:28.350
so he goes for finally the guy goes,
you don't have to pay me,

88
00:05:28.351 --> 00:05:30.930
just get me a case of beer.
So the guy goes fine.

89
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.420
So the closest place that add a little bit,
oh,

90
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.480
was cvs.
So it goes down to cvs.

91
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.960
<v 3>Okay.</v>

92
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.960
<v 1>He buys the fuck in case of beer and the lady behind the lady behind the counter</v>

93
00:05:46.421 --> 00:05:51.010
goes,
do you have an id?
And he's looking at her like,
bitch,
I'm 50.

94
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.840
But he goes,
do you really think I,
you know,
you don't think I'm of age?

95
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.890
She goes,
I need to swipe your license.
And she,
he goes for what?

96
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.100
She goes,
oh um,

97
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.300
basically for health insurance purposes they record,
you know,

98
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.420
if you drink or not and if you drink,

99
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.660
your premium goes up because you're a drinker.

100
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.620
Now what the fuck this cds give a shit about rat and everybody out who's a

101
00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:23.000
fucking booze face out there,
right?

102
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.250
Cause you know what it is the money that they're going to fucking be able to to

103
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.840
knock up,
you know on your premium to pump it up.
CVS gets,

104
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:36.140
it gets a little kickback.
So I would fucking works.

105
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:39.840
It's like when I drive you to fucking amazon.com right?

106
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.620
If you go through my website they get me a little eight.

107
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:47.300
Thanks for sending some business our way.
Break you off a couple of homies.
Right.

108
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.150
But I'm not costing any more money.
I'm the hero where this,

109
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:55.610
I don't cost you any more money.
Whether you go directly to Amazon,

110
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:58.430
if you go to my website,
it doesn't make any difference to me.

111
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.110
And I'm also not ratting you out.

112
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.410
What I'm trying to say here is I am a way better person than cvs.
No,

113
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:08.510
I'm fucking with you.
Look where I'll try to make money out of here.
But that's,

114
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.450
that's really fun.
It's fucking ridiculous.
I actually,

115
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:14.630
I was trying to look at it from the insurance company side of it cause you know

116
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:18.180
God damn well everybody goes in there and lies.
Do you smoke?

117
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.060
No.
You drink.
No,

118
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.420
I mean maybe I'll have a beer,
I don't know,

119
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.460
on the 4th of July to support the troops.

120
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:29.723
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

121
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.020
<v 1>Do you engage in any,
uh,
drug activity?</v>

122
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.840
I mean foods or drugs?
Self,
technically,
yes,
but I mean that others,
Nah,
no,

123
00:07:39.841 --> 00:07:44.610
I would do you have unprotected sex with prostitutes?

124
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.130
Listen,
I got a phone call.
Can I,
can I take this?
You know,
you know,

125
00:07:50.131 --> 00:07:52.080
he knows the deal.
You'll lie your fucking ass off.

126
00:07:52.081 --> 00:07:56.190
You're going to get life insurance.
You lie your fucking ass off.
Right?

127
00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.690
So on one side,

128
00:07:57.691 --> 00:08:01.200
I actually have empathy for insurance companies because I understand that aspect

129
00:08:01.201 --> 00:08:05.850
of it.
Provided they ever fucking paid out any God damn money remotely.

130
00:08:05.851 --> 00:08:09.660
Like they said they were gonna you know the deal,
you pay for insurance,

131
00:08:09.661 --> 00:08:12.000
they say you're covered and you say to them,
hey,
if this happens,

132
00:08:12.001 --> 00:08:15.870
am I going to be covered if I,
I got the,
uh,
the old stuff,
the toe insurance.

133
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:20.310
So if I wake up in the morning,
I stubbed my toe.
Okay,
I'm a man,
I can take it.

134
00:08:20.311 --> 00:08:23.190
But if I break my fucking tail,
okay.
And you know,

135
00:08:23.191 --> 00:08:26.340
my job is to skip on stage every night.
If I have to take a night off,
can you,

136
00:08:26.341 --> 00:08:30.540
can you kick me?
Do you know the fucking $25 feature spot money?

137
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.110
Can you kick that to me?
They're like,
absolutely,
I got high.
So if I break my toe,

138
00:08:34.111 --> 00:08:36.510
stub my toe in my house of cards,
yeah,
absolutely.

139
00:08:36.511 --> 00:08:39.570
You're covered right now what happens?
You start be telling you break it.

140
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.280
If I can call them up,
they're like,
okay,
I gotta go send it through the,
uh,

141
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:46.650
you're not getting paid quadrant quadrant of the fucking insurance company.

142
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.630
Then they come back and what do they do?

143
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.660
They'll give you like fucking 13 bucks instead of the 25 they owed you nine or

144
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.850
13 between 25 doesn't seem like a lot money,
right?

145
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.690
But you just ratchet that up there.
Right?
But if they owed you two 50,

146
00:08:59.691 --> 00:09:00.680
now I give you one 30.

147
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.730
What they owed you 25 grand and the only gave you fucking six.

148
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.870
That's what the fuck they do.

149
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.410
They're in the business of taking your fucking money and buying themselves a

150
00:09:09.411 --> 00:09:10.130
yacht.

151
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:15.130
And fucking bang in Victoria secret models in the ass while looking at the next

152
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.250
year's model of fucking,
uh,
yeah,
that's,
that's what they're in the business of.

153
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.160
They are not in the business of fucking help with people during the business of

154
00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:24.710
taking your money,
telling you that you're going to be covered.

155
00:09:24.711 --> 00:09:28.850
And then when you go,
dude,
what the fuck?
Right?
They go,
yeah,

156
00:09:28.851 --> 00:09:32.420
go fuck yourself cause we got more money.
Take it or leave it.
Right.

157
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.300
And what should happen is like,
you know,
when,
uh,

158
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:40.670
do you remember the mighty heroes when they would send out that little signal

159
00:09:40.671 --> 00:09:42.890
and then they'd all fucking tour diaper man and strong man,

160
00:09:42.891 --> 00:09:44.630
they'd all turn into something,
what was it?
Batman.

161
00:09:44.631 --> 00:09:46.820
I don't fucking remember what everybody's insured by.

162
00:09:46.821 --> 00:09:49.880
That company should go at those cons to be like,
dude,
what the fuck?

163
00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.260
I thought you said this guy was covered.

164
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.710
<v 3>Okay,</v>

165
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.020
<v 1>this is what you're doing to him.
You're going to do it to all of us.
Right.</v>

166
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:59.080
I'm going back to the Sally field thing.
You know what the problem is?

167
00:09:59.081 --> 00:10:02.260
Is nobody likes their neighbor.
You know,
you look across Danum,

168
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.460
you look at the car he's driving,

169
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.830
he looked at his wife either don't understand what he bought or you want it.

170
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.050
There's never a middle ground like,
yeah,
you know,

171
00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:12.440
I'm pretty much on par with this guy and I keep my ego can handle living across

172
00:10:12.441 --> 00:10:15.500
from him.
You either going to resent them or not understand them.

173
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.130
So then when he gets fucked out of money,
he's telling you the story.

174
00:10:19.131 --> 00:10:21.290
You're sitting there nodding your head,
acting like you don't like it.

175
00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:24.680
But yea two minutes is a part of your soul is getting filled up,
isn't it?

176
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.340
Admit it.
You know like your neighbors,
right?

177
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:29.720
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

178
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.920
<v 1>If it really came down to it,</v>

179
00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:35.600
don't you want a house is big as your house and your neighbors when it'd be

180
00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:37.250
great if they just weren't there anymore.

181
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.480
Somehow there was wasn't any like forensics and they could figure it out that

182
00:10:41.481 --> 00:10:44.720
you a hastens his demise and took over his house.

183
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.010
Just added a fucking hallway between your house and his right.

184
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.600
Then the whole other house is yours.
Right?

185
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.510
So when your wife and kids are driving you nuts,
you just say,
listen,

186
00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.320
Daddy's going over to his other life.
I'll be back when I can deal with you.

187
00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.000
And everybody just looks at you like those,

188
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.510
that family in that real estate commercial just smiling and waving,
being like,

189
00:11:04.511 --> 00:11:05.680
yeah,
it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

190
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.910
All right then do you go in there right and said he's you want,
you've got booze,

191
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:11.440
you got cigars,

192
00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.460
you know you got him a PSU slash your fucking whore.

193
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.090
They ought to have that the timeout room for a married guy.
You know,

194
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.730
and I know what you ladies to take it.
Well,

195
00:11:24.731 --> 00:11:27.940
why don't they have a time out room for women?
Ain't no what I say?
Well,

196
00:11:27.941 --> 00:11:32.070
why don't you come up with it?
The world doesn't owe you around a drinks.
Okay,

197
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.370
now God damn it,
you got debt multitasking.
Bray.

198
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.300
Once you sit down with a couple other prods or be in your room,

199
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.990
you know bunch shit that makes you live longer.
See if you notice what the guy,

200
00:11:43.991 --> 00:11:48.160
everything I said would slowly fucking kill me.
The bows to cigars,
the horse,

201
00:11:48.161 --> 00:11:52.050
all of it just,
it just eats away at your soul and your fucking liver,
right?

202
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.650
Women would go on there.
The first one,

203
00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:57.190
the first things they'd probably want is like the most beautiful fucking tub

204
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.130
they ever could find so they could take a nice fucking bath.

205
00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:03.100
You know what their crazy little fucking soaps,
right?

206
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.900
And have a whole spa day and they'd have a friend that they could sit down and

207
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:11.770
get all of that resentment out of their heart with someone who can actually

208
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:13.920
listen to it.
They download all that shit.

209
00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.340
He just totally clean up their soul before they go into the next room and get

210
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:20.090
fucking banged by Brad Pitt.
You know,

211
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.200
whoever the fucking Jake Gyllenhaal guy is now a days.
Who is it?

212
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:28.600
Is it Justin Bieber?
Has he become a man yet?
He's in his 20s,
right?

213
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.420
He's riding the wave out of teen idol.

214
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:34.690
Dumb slowly becoming a man might,

215
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.080
as long as he doesn't remake blue lagoon,

216
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.400
I think that kid's going to be all right.
Um,
anyways,

217
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:46.080
I'm not Jesus Christ is 12 minutes of your life.
You'll never get back,
huh?
Um,

218
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.980
you know what today is about everybody.
Today's not about you.

219
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.990
Today's not about me.
Today's not even about America.
You know what today's about.

220
00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:01.590
Today's about the Boston Bruins versus Detroit Red Wings.

221
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.360
That's what it's all about.
Okay?

222
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.360
It's funny that they play all these fucking games and they can come down to one

223
00:13:07.361 --> 00:13:12.280
God damn game for those of you who don't watch hockey,

224
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:17.210
all right?
Which is kind of me.
I just pay attention to it because I've,
ah,

225
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:21.100
you fucking consequence.
Can I pass?
What ever worked the first fucking time?

226
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.650
You know,
they're always like,
you know,
that's not secure enough.
Well,

227
00:13:26.651 --> 00:13:28.030
it's like,
it's so fucking secure.

228
00:13:28.031 --> 00:13:31.120
I can't do it on one time while I'm still in a fucking podcast.

229
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.210
Jesus fucking Christ.
Anyways,
they play all these goddamn came.

230
00:13:36.211 --> 00:13:39.940
Let me get back into the nicest soothing tone that I had earlier.
Um,

231
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:44.590
they play all these fucking games,
80 goddamn games,
whatever the hell it is.

232
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.920
And you would think that,
you know,
by now everything would be all sorted out,

233
00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.190
right?
Let's go to the playoff picture,

234
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.620
the playoff picture.
Here we go.
I didn't need a picture.

235
00:13:56.621 --> 00:13:59.230
I need a brow to playoff bracket.
I can't read that shit.

236
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.650
Bracket.
Challenge the fucking standings.

237
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:09.370
That's how,
that's how old I am.
I think.
I feel like if I just yell at a website,

238
00:14:09.371 --> 00:14:13.360
I'll do what I want.
Um,

239
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.070
all right,
so the,
so the fucking red wings have 93 points.
Ah,

240
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.270
they got 93.
That's right.
Cause they,
that's right.

241
00:14:22.271 --> 00:14:27.160
Cause they beat the fucking filthy flyers.
All the flyers needed that one.

242
00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:29.030
The flyers needed that one.

243
00:14:29.031 --> 00:14:32.950
If for some reason I root for the Philadelphia Flyers,
I like,

244
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.360
you know what I mean?
I know that they'd been dirty and fought knowledge ship.

245
00:14:37.361 --> 00:14:40.600
You can't tell me it wasn't entertaining.
You know,

246
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.430
Ron Hextall come and flying out of the net because he's pissed that he lost the

247
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.360
Stanley Cup finals.
I've always enjoyed that shit.
Um,

248
00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.920
I don't like the fence,
but I,
I really liked the team.

249
00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.910
Uh,
but you know,
Philly fans work at,
you're not liking making you not like them.

250
00:14:58.911 --> 00:15:03.140
So they did the job with me.
I don't like him.
Um,
so anyways,
so Detroit beat him.

251
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.970
So as of right now,
Detroit has 93 points.

252
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.390
Philadelphia has 91.
The Bruins have 91,

253
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.640
but for whatever fucking reason,

254
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.030
I guess head to head maybe or we have a game at hand.
I don't know what,

255
00:15:17.031 --> 00:15:21.770
we're still under the fucking bar line.
So basically tonight,
tonight,

256
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.800
the red wings I think could solidify and let's say you have two more get look to

257
00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:28.990
choice Detroit wins tonight.

258
00:15:28.991 --> 00:15:32.180
There they're either in or they have totally fucking,
you know,

259
00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:35.660
they'd have to basically,
yeah,
put me in net to not make the playoffs.

260
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:36.980
But if the Bruins,

261
00:15:36.981 --> 00:15:41.981
when we would go up two points on the Philadelphia flyers and a,

262
00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:45.140
this is the biggest fucking game.
They're all big games this week,

263
00:15:45.141 --> 00:15:49.610
but this is a full whole benefit.
This is a big one this week.
And uh,

264
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.700
and other Redwings haven't been the greatest in the past few years,

265
00:15:52.701 --> 00:15:54.890
but they've got enough guys left.
Oh,
and by the way,

266
00:15:54.891 --> 00:15:57.200
I want to say a shout out to that fucking Twitter cunt.

267
00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.260
That fucking laughed at me when I said,
you know,
Carolina fucking,

268
00:16:00.261 --> 00:16:03.650
I feel like they always get the best of us.
And he was saying like,
oh,

269
00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:06.530
we're the Bruins are six [inaudible] two the last fucking tie.
Well,
you know,

270
00:16:06.531 --> 00:16:07.910
something,
I never forgot that game.

271
00:16:07.911 --> 00:16:12.050
Seven and 2009 when they came back and they fucking beat us.

272
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:15.350
And just times,
every time there's a big game like that,
you know,
something,

273
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.950
they always beat us.
And what happens?
We played those contacts and what happened?

274
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.660
What happened?
They ended up beating us in a shootout,
but we did get one point,

275
00:16:23.661 --> 00:16:28.590
thank Christ.
Um,
I think you do right?
Don't you get one point?

276
00:16:28.591 --> 00:16:30.610
If I don't,
every time I turn it on,
they fucking change the rule.

277
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:33.950
Now they're doing three on three in the overtime,
which I liked,
but you know,

278
00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:38.060
it makes me feel like I,
I blacked out for five years.
So anyways,

279
00:16:38.061 --> 00:16:42.470
we got to win that game tonight.
Um,
and I was hoping,
uh,

280
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.080
Detroit would look a little more tired than they did last night,

281
00:16:45.081 --> 00:16:47.420
but they totally looked like they were on their fucking game.

282
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.360
The one thing we got going is it's back to back.
Um,

283
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.980
which usually during the season you'd have a let down,

284
00:16:54.981 --> 00:16:58.040
but there's too much at stake.
So I think this is going to be a tough game.
And,

285
00:16:58.041 --> 00:17:02.300
uh,
um,
I dunno,
my heart says we're going to win,

286
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:06.560
but I don't know.
We'll see.
It's been tough for us lately.

287
00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.160
All right,
let's,
uh,
oh,
and by the way,

288
00:17:10.161 --> 00:17:13.580
the amount of people that hate the fucking Bruins,
I,
I,
it's like for what?

289
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:18.170
We want one cup in 40 years,
the fuck is your problem.
You know,

290
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.710
I love when all fucking teams sit there and they act like,
you know,

291
00:17:21.711 --> 00:17:25.850
this team's dirty in this team has excuses,
but our team's fucking squeaky clean.

292
00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.730
You know,
I see the pieces of shit on my team,

293
00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:31.250
just the way I see him on your team,
you know,

294
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:35.510
I see your fucking coaches screaming and yelling anytime anybody touches your

295
00:17:35.511 --> 00:17:39.260
players.
And then when your players touch somebody else,
then don't give a fuck.

296
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:44.030
Everybody does that.
It's called being an immature cont,

297
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.170
you know,
welcome to the party.
Have a seat.
Can I get you a drink?
All right,

298
00:17:49.171 --> 00:17:54.050
score big everybody.
A little little advert to miss Muslim.
Since uh,

299
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:58.250
you're paying too much for tickets between all the mark ups and last minutes.

300
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:02.070
Convert convenience charges,
even printed home fees.

301
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:06.690
They really charge you to print tickets at home.
It's fucking unbelievable.

302
00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.920
All those types of charges I'm telling you,
that just ends up,
you know,

303
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.720
that's just somebody standing in a foyer of a house he can afford just raining

304
00:18:15.721 --> 00:18:19.170
money down on prostitutes.
She ever watch American greed.
That's that.

305
00:18:19.171 --> 00:18:21.300
It gradually all adds up to that.
All right,

306
00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:23.970
you end up paying court side prices for nosebleed seats.

307
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.340
scorebig.com is here to change that.

00:20:13.411 --> 00:20:15.890
the guy was like,
hey,
how'd you get tickets?
It's like,

336
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:20.040
his scalp demand how much you pay.
And I answered him.
He's like,

00:20:20.041 --> 00:20:23.280
we got these for this.
It's like,
oh yeah.
Does that make you feel better?

338
00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:26.330
You tight?
Fuck,
I couldn't.
Every once in a while it's like,
you know,

339
00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.420
just in those moments you're like,

340
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:31.800
why didn't I just let another adult do that to me?
You know,

341
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.330
then you hate yourself.

342
00:20:33.331 --> 00:20:35.520
Then you're a little surly to your wife and next thing you know,
yeah,

343
00:20:35.521 --> 00:20:40.230
she's not banging you,
uh,
Boll and branch.
You know,

344
00:20:40.231 --> 00:20:43.710
you probably spend more time with your bedsheets than anything else you own.

345
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.380
You really shouldn't skimp on your bedding,

346
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.290
but most people do because great sheets are very expensive.

347
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.740
Thanks to Boll and branch,
that's not the case anymore.

348
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.030
And when you spend the big bucks on sheets with a super high thread count,

349
00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.620
you think you're getting the best.

350
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.990
But what you're really getting is marketing Mumbo jumbo.
Oh my God,
dude,

351
00:21:04.991 --> 00:21:08.290
am I really have to read five paragraphs about sheets?
Thread counts,

352
00:21:08.291 --> 00:21:12.670
have nothing to do with quality and don't get me started on so called Egyptian

353
00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:15.520
cotton.
The fuck is that.
That just came,

354
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.000
just just the name of a plant grown in Pakistan,
in China.

355
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.600
Uh,
well,
you know,
didn't back in the day.

356
00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.330
Then they'll know white man bring his ships over there for all the fucking

357
00:21:25.331 --> 00:21:29.290
spices and sheets.
Isn't that what happened?
Um,
you value,

358
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.070
you value your sleep.
They'll put words in my mouth,
but you know what?

359
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.630
You're writing instinctive son of a bitch.

360
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.970
But whenever you head to a department store,

361
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.810
you're forced to pay a huge markup for sheets that aren't even that great.

362
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.690
Boll and branch sheets are different.
First of all,

363
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.970
let me cross my legs during this part.
First of all,

364
00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.470
sit down and let me tell you a story.

365
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:52.270
You can only get them@andbranch.com so you know you're paying for quality sheets

366
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.880
and not for overhead.
And quite frankly,

367
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:59.410
they're the most comfortable sheets in the world they made with the entirely

368
00:21:59.411 --> 00:22:02.890
organic cotton and a nights sleeping on bowling and branch sheets.

369
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.450
Makes your day so much better.

370
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.930
Three US presidents sleep on Boll and branch.

371
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:12.760
Well how do you know that?
Isn't there like a security issue?
Jesus.

372
00:22:12.761 --> 00:22:17.140
How filthy or Bill Clinton's
fucking animal.

373
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:18.400
Uh,

374
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.660
these are people who can afford to sleep on any brand of sheets in the world and

375
00:22:22.661 --> 00:22:25.990
they even choose bold and they even choose boll and branch.

376
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.080
How can they afford to sleep on any brand in the world?

377
00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:33.130
They only make 400 grand a year before taxes.
Oh,
that's right.

378
00:22:33.131 --> 00:22:36.700
Cause then they give speeches for fucking 500 grand a night to everybody who put

379
00:22:36.701 --> 00:22:40.690
him in office.
So they wash their bribe money.
Oh,
shut up bill.
Okay,
here we go.

380
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.390
They even cut out all the middlemen,
department store markups,

381
00:22:43.391 --> 00:22:48.040
which by the way are up to 800% so you're getting amazing luxurious sheets for a

382
00:22:48.041 --> 00:22:50.980
couple of hundred bucks.

428
00:25:18.111 --> 00:25:21.810
Shit.
Before I get off the podcast,
why did,
down here,

429
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.010
you guys know that song by sting love is stronger than justice.

430
00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.610
A lot of people sleep on stink,
you know,
cause he comes out all yoga it up,

431
00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:33.090
still looking like he could bang a 22 year old and every he's like,
ah man,

432
00:25:33.091 --> 00:25:37.020
that's fucking a baby boomer elevator music.
Uh,
well I like it.

433
00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:42.780
I like it.
Um,
is a song on a,

434
00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:46.470
what does that 10 summers tails is a song.
Love is stronger than justice.

435
00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.270
It's just some drum nerd shit.

436
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.920
Now I've listened to that song at least a thousand fucking times and I thought

437
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:56.550
it was like,
I don't know if it's bar a measure.
I don't know to say it.

438
00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.960
I thought you counted seven twice then you counted four,
four,

439
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:04.430
then three,
four and then seven.
Right.

440
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.680
She can I actually play this here.
Why don't I play the fucking song?

441
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:09.480
I'll show you.
So this is some fucking,

442
00:26:09.481 --> 00:26:12.660
this is the dumbest Shit I think I'm going to do.
Oh,
that's right.

443
00:26:12.661 --> 00:26:17.190
I can't play it on my fucking laptop for whatever fucking reason.
Um,

444
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:18.931
yeah.

445
00:26:18.931 --> 00:26:22.200
Cause I have too many things signed into fucking iTunes and then my old shit,

446
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.450
I can't,
I don't remember the password for.

447
00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.100
<v 3>Okay.</v>

448
00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.590
<v 1>I thought the big brother was looking at me through the camera.</v>

449
00:26:28.591 --> 00:26:33.360
Can't they fucking see?
Can't they see that?

450
00:26:33.361 --> 00:26:36.000
Is that it's made,
let me see if I can fucking play this for you.

451
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:38.350
<v 3>Okay.</v>

452
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:42.380
<v 1>All right.
So I always thought that this is how you counted it,
right?</v>

453
00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.860
<v 4>Three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
one</v>

454
00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:00.570
<v 1>right?
It finally dawned on me today that when I was counting four,</v>

455
00:27:00.571 --> 00:27:03.120
four and then three four,
four plus three is seven.

456
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.460
She can count the whole fucking thing and she's seven

457
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.260
<v 0>that ain't the one.
Here we go.</v>

458
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:16.980
<v 4>One,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,</v>

459
00:27:16.981 --> 00:27:21.220
three,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
four,
three,
four,
five,

460
00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:22.390
<v 1>six,
seven one.</v>

461
00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:27.550
So it's really for fucking measures is seven and I was like,
oh,

462
00:27:27.551 --> 00:27:30.680
the plane who fucking seven twice.
Then they go for,

463
00:27:30.681 --> 00:27:34.000
for dentistry for days back to seven.

464
00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.770
It's like no stupid.
They're just making it sound like it's in four,

465
00:27:38.771 --> 00:27:42.220
four and then all of a sudden they lop off one beat and you're like,
oh,

466
00:27:42.221 --> 00:27:44.260
what the fuck?
But back to one again,

467
00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:48.070
which really is the layman's term for still being at seven.

468
00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.710
I learned that while walking at pit bull picking up dog shit this morning.
Ah,

469
00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.120
what the fuck are you been doing?

470
00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.880
So anyways,
um,

471
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.960
<v 5>how the fuck do I get out of this?
You know,
the defense in me,</v>

472
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:08.970
as much as I also loved that album,

473
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.320
that fucking out of all the new shit that I listened to,
uh,
you know,

474
00:28:13.321 --> 00:28:15.210
as I watched the Grammy's and I was like,

475
00:28:15.211 --> 00:28:20.040
I am downloading everything that wings some Grammy's here,
right?

476
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.220
Not Everything,
but you know,
so I basically,
I downloaded a,

477
00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.760
I can't remember Alabama shakes the weekend.

478
00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:28.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

479
00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.920
<v 5>Leonardo Dicaprio.
It's a fuck set guys.
That rapper who won everything,</v>

480
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:36.640
I can never remember Kendrick Lamar,
right?
I downloaded all,
all his shit that,

481
00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:41.040
and I like all of this stuff I got to tell you like,
uh,

482
00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:43.950
the one that actually I liked the best is the weekend.

483
00:28:43.951 --> 00:28:47.850
I just think it's a fucking,
it's an unbelievable album.
Unbelievable.

484
00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:48.540
Guys get 'em amazing

485
00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:52.410
<v 1>voice and some of the songs,
he really does sound a lot like Michael Jackson,</v>

486
00:28:52.411 --> 00:28:56.940
but not in,
not even in a bad way,
just like influenced by the guy.
Um,

487
00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:00.000
so this morning when I walked,
when I was walking around the block,

488
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:05.030
I listened to rat round and round starting the day off with the little Bobby

489
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:09.420
blue.
Right?
Did I listen to that?

490
00:29:09.421 --> 00:29:14.130
Sting song and I was thinking like,
ah,
that's what I figured out.
Wait a minute.

491
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:15.750
Four,
three is seven and what the fuck?

492
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.900
Literally picking up dog shit with a big goofy grin on my face and this fucking

493
00:29:18.901 --> 00:29:22.620
beautiful woman jog by looking at me like it was just got excited about dog
shit.

494
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.730
See listening to a podcast about dog shit.
Just one of those moments,
you know,

495
00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:31.080
he's just like,
yeah,
whatever,
you know.
Anyways.
And then I was just like,

496
00:29:31.081 --> 00:29:34.290
all right,
I keep,
as much as I keep trying to listen to new music,

497
00:29:34.291 --> 00:29:38.850
I keep going back to the shit I listened to when I was growing up.
So,
um,

498
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.670
out of all the ones that I keep coming back to that guy's fucking album,

499
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:46.450
I just think it's the shit.
So I'm not,
I'm not 100% over the hill,

500
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:50.320
you know what I mean?
And I actually have,
unbeknownst to me,

501
00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.410
I have a college gig coming up,
which I'm very excited,

502
00:29:53.411 --> 00:29:57.880
but I rarely do college gigs anymore.
I don't know why,
you know,

503
00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:01.870
I have to keep doing college kids cause I gotta keep my fan base being,
you know,

504
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.930
I've got to keep getting the next generation of people.
That's how it works.

505
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:06.581
You know,
you can't,

506
00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:10.930
you don't want to grow old with your crowd and they're just reminding you how

507
00:30:10.931 --> 00:30:13.210
old you are.
It's like I should only think that,
you know,

508
00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:17.740
twice a day when I'm brushing my teeth,
you know,
put the toothpaste on.

509
00:30:17.741 --> 00:30:22.120
You start brushing,
you look up what a foe.
Oh,
it's me.
You know,

510
00:30:22.121 --> 00:30:26.680
I only want to feel that twice,
fill it twice

511
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:31.690
<v 5>in a day.
Um,
but uh,</v>

512
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:33.240
<v 3>okay.</v>

513
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.050
<v 5>What happens is,
is if you just kind of state,
you know,
with your fan base,</v>

514
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.220
you know,
they get married,

515
00:30:38.221 --> 00:30:41.760
they have kids and even if they want to come out this so fucking tired,

516
00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:46.140
they just want to sleep if they actually get a moment,
you know what I mean?
So,

517
00:30:46.141 --> 00:30:49.500
uh,
you got to keep the young kids coming out.
The young kids,

518
00:30:49.501 --> 00:30:54.330
they can't feel their face,
but they love it.
Um,
oh Jesus.
All right.

519
00:30:54.331 --> 00:30:57.960

Okay,

552
00:33:16.671 --> 00:33:20.240
in front of me,
but then adulthood raped me in the eyes.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.280
How Jesus could you be more dramatic?

554

crazy broad,
broke my heart.

557
00:33:34.821 --> 00:33:39.821
I had to cut away old friends and family shutting me out of their smiles.

558
00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:44.810
All right,
dude.
This is like getting creepier with each sentence.

559
00:33:44.811 --> 00:33:46.780
If you don't bring this around in like two sentences,

560
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:47.900
I'm not going to abandon this.

561
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:52.850
Had to cut away from old friends and family shutting me out of their smiles.

562
00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:57.290
Dude,
what did you do that your friends and family decided they didn't want to be

563
00:33:57.291 --> 00:34:02.230
around you?
Uh,
anyways,
I don't feel sorry for myself or want any pity.
Uh,

564
00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:05.180
I just,
you're not going to get any so good.
I'm glad you don't.
He goes,

565
00:34:05.181 --> 00:34:10.130
I just want to know how to get out of this.
Never ending routine of demise.
Well,

566
00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:14.000
first of all,
I would stop using those golf,
death,
metal words,

567
00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.190
you know,
demise.
What else you got in here?

568
00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:22.450
Adult raped me in the eyes.
These,
he like song lyrics,

569
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:24.543
<v 0>you know,</v>

570
00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:28.590
<v 1>to press dude.
What would be the name of his tractor?
Barker.</v>

571
00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:33.460
I'm sure you're going to wipe wipes,
right?
It sounds like I can't sing like that.

572
00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:39.310
Where do you all like digital keyed up to my eyes and all these fucking kids

573
00:34:39.311 --> 00:34:41.760
getting like wet fucking whiplash.
Um,

574
00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:47.180
I work too much in a jeweler that was supposed to pay for my comedy career when

575
00:34:47.321 --> 00:34:50.410
I don't work.
I uh,
I was supposed to pay for my comedy career when I,

576
00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.800
when I don't work,
uh,
I sleep or oh,
when I don't work,

577
00:34:53.801 --> 00:34:56.980
I sleep or watch endless DVDs.
I'm 24 years old.

578
00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:00.760
What the fuck this reads like you 56,
dude,
he goes,

579
00:35:00.761 --> 00:35:04.360
I'm tired all the time from all the hating of the world and my body just won't

580
00:35:04.361 --> 00:35:07.270
listen to this screaming frustration in my soul.

581
00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:08.750
<v 0>Okay</v>

582
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:11.840
<v 1>Dude,
you listen to like you listen to progressive metal.</v>

583
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:14.070
I'm guessing by the words you use here,
uh,

584
00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.890
either that you played dungeons and dragons.

585
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.070
I'm really not helping you to depression by shitting on you through all of this.

586
00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.450
Um,
don't worry.
I'm going to give you some sunshine here in the end here.

587
00:35:23.451 --> 00:35:25.730
So I sometimes get a Spock,

588
00:35:25.731 --> 00:35:29.480
a motivation to get back in shape and s and start writing script,

589
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.990
but only lasts for a day or two at the most.
Yeah,

590
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.650
exactly.
And then,
and then the work comes and you have to keep going.

591
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:42.830
And that's what separates the people in life who fucking work and in make it.

592
00:35:42.901 --> 00:35:47.520
And those who don't,
you know,
everything's fun for a couple of fucking days.

593
00:35:47.521 --> 00:35:49.740
I'm going to get shredded.
I'm going to join a box and Jim,

594
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:52.290
I'm going to look like I'm going to fight in a title fight and you go down
there,

595
00:35:52.291 --> 00:35:53.610
you skip rope.
I'm going to get abs.

596
00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:55.650
You doing all the fucking shit in two days in,
you know,

597
00:35:55.651 --> 00:35:58.920
after two days you get tired.
All right?

598
00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.500
And that's what you need the discipline to get up and go over there.

599
00:36:01.501 --> 00:36:02.640
Even though you don't want to,

600
00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:07.130
you know people who've written Oscar winning scripts.

601
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.020
I bet they don't like fucking doing it on,
on a certain level,

602
00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:14.460
but they keep going.
So I would just tell you to keep fucking going.
Anyways,

603
00:36:14.461 --> 00:36:16.620
let me read the rest of this drum overly dramatic shit.

604
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:20.670
I've lost all faith in the world.
Have nothing to fight for anymore.

605
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.541
I respect you.

606
00:36:21.541 --> 00:36:25.800
Go Fuck yourself attitude and want and want to know what you did to finally pick

607
00:36:25.801 --> 00:36:28.950
yourself up from your Darfur inflicted depression.
Uh,
sorry.

608
00:36:28.951 --> 00:36:31.950
It's not the funniest emails,
but I could really do with you guys.
I know,
dude,

609
00:36:31.951 --> 00:36:34.350
I'm fucking with you.
I know you're going through some shit.
So I'm,
here we go.

610
00:36:34.351 --> 00:36:36.960
I'm going to help you out here.
Uh,
first thing I would do,

611
00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:40.050
get rid of the KFC in wet wipes.
All right?

612
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:43.560
If you're already kind of a depressed dude,
if you eat bad food,

613
00:36:43.561 --> 00:36:46.680
that's just going to add,
because I'm just speaking personally.
Once again,

614
00:36:46.681 --> 00:36:49.500
not a licensed guy here in case you throw yourself off the fucking roof.

615
00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:53.280
All right?
Um,
yeah.
Number one,

616
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:58.830
this is what I do.
Go.
He'd go out and get something healthy to eat,
you know,

617
00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.240
drink some water.
Okay.
Get eight hours sleep,
wake up and need something healthy.

618
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:07.740
Then go to the grocery store when you full and go buy a bunch of healthy shit.

619
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:09.900
Okay?
Chop up the veggies,

620
00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:12.800
chop up the lead to get a fucking salad already made in this.

621
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:16.080
You don't have to think about it.
All right?
Cook up some fucking chicken.

622
00:37:16.081 --> 00:37:18.180
Chop that shit up.
Make some chicken salad.

623
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.380
You got that in there to get yourself some fucking lunch breed and get yourself

624
00:37:22.381 --> 00:37:25.230
some real bread from a fucking bakery.
Start with that bullshit.

625
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:27.420
You start eating right and then just start working out.

626
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:31.230
You're automatically gonna feel good about yourself and fucking stick with that

627
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:35.010
as far as that other shit goes.
Dude,
you're 24 years old.
All right.

628
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.640
I started comedy when I was 24 you sound like you've already been doing it and

629
00:37:38.641 --> 00:37:42.120
quit,
so you're ahead of where,
where I was at at your age.

630
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:45.850
So there's no reason to be depressed.
All right?
Um,

631
00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:51.870
this is how I got beyond my depression was I just started observing it.

632
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:56.970
I looked at it as a spectator rather than feeling a thought and just accepting

633
00:37:56.971 --> 00:37:59.580
it and then being dragged to the bottom of the fucking ocean with it.

634
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.340
I just started to pay attention.

635
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.610
I just sat there and listened to what my brain was telling me and it was a bunch

636
00:38:05.611 --> 00:38:08.490
of negative,
oh my God,
I'm going to fail and I have to go back,

637
00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.260
move in with my parents and they're going to die.

638
00:38:10.261 --> 00:38:12.270
I'm going to be able to afford to pay for the house and then I'm going to be

639
00:38:12.271 --> 00:38:16.290
homeless and then I'm just going to die.
And uh,
you know,

640
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:17.610
nothing's ever going to work out for me.

641
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.340
You know those with the thoughts I was having.

642
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.400
So I just sat back and observed him and I just started going,

643
00:38:23.401 --> 00:38:27.180
I don't want to think that.
I want to think that.
And I would just,

644
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.160
as I felt him coming,
I would just replace it with like a positive thought.

645
00:38:32.161 --> 00:38:34.830
I know this is really corny and simple,
but I kind of started doing that.

646
00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.890
And the more I did that because it didn't quite work as to what actually did

647
00:38:39.891 --> 00:38:40.880
work in the beginning at all.

648
00:38:40.881 --> 00:38:44.180
But like I just kept doing it more and more and then I just became conscious of

649
00:38:44.181 --> 00:38:48.980
when my brain was going in that direction.
And I'm working out,

650
00:38:48.981 --> 00:38:53.420
helps me eating right.
Helps me going down to a comedy club,

651
00:38:53.421 --> 00:38:58.070
telling jokes helps me out playing drums,
wrestling with my dog,

652
00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:02.630
you know,
taking me out to dinner.
Just go do something.

653
00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:07.220
Like it's just a choice,
you know,

654
00:39:07.221 --> 00:39:08.900
July 30th so I'm going to happen once.

655
00:39:08.901 --> 00:39:13.850
So am I going to fucking be a miserable cunts on this?
Or I said July 30th,

656
00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:16.400
2012 is only gonna happen unless it's just,
it's just a fucking choice dude.
So,

657
00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:18.560
you know,
if what you're dealing with his clinical,

658
00:39:18.561 --> 00:39:21.140
then it's obviously way beyond me.
So I don't need,
you know,

659
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:25.370
and then I'll like to fucking apologize.
Like Fred Willard,
um,

660
00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:29.600
I'm sorry that you didn't go to a psychiatrist and you went to a hacky comedian

661
00:39:29.601 --> 00:39:30.230
instead.

662
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.490
<v 6>Evidently that's my fault</v>

663
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:54.750
because,

664
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:17.230
<v 1>um,
all right,
why don't we end with this segment?</v>

665
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:21.460
I'm sure I can do another 10 minutes on this to give you at least 45 minutes for

666
00:40:21.461 --> 00:40:25.350
the week.
Let's end with this.
This segment,
oh Jesus,

667
00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:29.500
which is really taking on a life of its own.

668
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:33.010
I thought it was going to die,
but it is somehow risen.

669
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:42.600
Um,
okay.
Here we go.
And get ready for bill is the dumbest person on the planet.

670
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:43.920
All right?
Feel for what it's worth.

671
00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:47.700
I think you're fucking crazy and irresponsible explanation point.

672
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:52.890
I can ever say the x,
x skull exclaim exclamation.
There we go.

673
00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.070
Exclamation point.
That's one of the,
you know,
those,

674
00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:56.550
those words that you kind of know how to say,

675
00:40:56.551 --> 00:40:59.790
but you just sort of fly through them.
[inaudible] uh,

676
00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:04.320
what kind of person talks about God like that?
And I love this shit.

677
00:41:04.321 --> 00:41:08.880
This is what they all do.
You should.
And I believe deep down inside you are,

678
00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:10.860
be ashamed of yourself.
Dude.

679
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:15.780
This is what I love about these fucking maniacs is they're so wrapped up into

680
00:41:15.781 --> 00:41:18.960
what they believe that they listened to.

681
00:41:18.961 --> 00:41:23.961
How much this person just keeps fucking including other invisible people and

682
00:41:23.971 --> 00:41:27.990
then superimposing what he believes in to what you know.
He thinks.

683
00:41:27.991 --> 00:41:32.991
I truly believe because he's so wrapped up in his own fucking world that he

684
00:41:33.261 --> 00:41:37.250
can't possibly even fathom that somebody has a difference of opinion on this

685
00:41:37.251 --> 00:41:40.490
subject.
So he goes,
uh,
you should,

686
00:41:40.491 --> 00:41:44.300
and I believe deep down inside you are,
be ashamed of yourself.
Dude.

687
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:48.470
Are Your mom and dad's still alive?
What exactly does that have to do with any,

688
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:53.660
your shtick with respect to God is hurtful,
offensive,
offensive,

689
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:58.100
and despicable.
Um,
in three things,
it always has to be three things.

690
00:41:58.101 --> 00:42:01.370
It can't be hurtful and despicable or offensive and hurtful.

691
00:42:01.371 --> 00:42:04.490
It has to be hurtful,
offensive,
and despicable.

692
00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.760
Just like comedy has to come in threes.
Um,

693
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:12.550
how difficult it must be to spew hatred and vulgarities for shock.

694
00:42:12.681 --> 00:42:15.860
Value.
Laughs,
no talent in that my friend.

695
00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:20.660
That's the classic place that people go.
Um,
whenever you,

696
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:21.643
whenever you,

697
00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:26.540
this is the classic guy where everything is funny until it comes around to the

698
00:42:26.541 --> 00:42:31.040
subject that they take seriously,
100%.
And no one can even joke it,

699
00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:34.940
joke about it or even question it on any level and then they always say that

700
00:42:34.941 --> 00:42:38.090
you're just doing it for shock because they find it shocking.

701
00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:42.260
It's like really my views on women,
women haven't been,
you know,

702
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:44.300
that didn't offend you.

703
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:47.090
All the shit that I've said over the two fucking years and none of that is

704
00:42:47.091 --> 00:42:50.120
offended you and now all of a sudden this does anyway,
so he goes,

705
00:42:50.121 --> 00:42:51.710
enjoy your success,

706
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:56.870
air quotes and all the money you were making on the backs of hard working decent

707
00:42:56.871 --> 00:43:01.670
people that understand what it means to follow the rules and be the best they

708
00:43:01.671 --> 00:43:05.120
can be without putting other people and god down.

709
00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:09.590
The rest of us are watching and we are not laughing.

710
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.890
Dude,
how many people are in your bedroom as your,

711
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:19.370
do you have a group podcast listening party every week?
All right,

712
00:43:19.371 --> 00:43:20.240
let's get back to that.
Oh,

713
00:43:20.241 --> 00:43:24.470
evidently I am making money on the backs of hard working decent people.

714
00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.260
So let me get this straight because I'm standing on a stage.

715
00:43:27.261 --> 00:43:29.360
Evidently what I'm doing is not hard work.

716
00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:33.470
And if people are sitting in the audience automatically,
they're all decent,

717
00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.530
hardworking people.
And not only that,

718
00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:38.690
I'm making money on the backs of them,

719
00:43:38.691 --> 00:43:42.120
really do I have some sort of comedy sweatshop,
you know,

720
00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:44.630
comedy factory was sweatshop Labor.

721
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:48.620
What I do is actually takes advantage of no one.

722
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:54.230
I stand on a stage and I,
I tell jokes and if you like what I say,

723
00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.780
you,
you sit and listen.
And if you don't,
you'll walk out

724
00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:02.840
right where,
where,
you know,
and I love how just because you're in the crowd,

725
00:44:02.841 --> 00:44:04.930
that means you're a decent human being.
Do you know the,

726
00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:08.510
the amount of fucking freaks and scumbags that come up to me,

727
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:12.860
and this is what I found at a comedy show for the most part,
decent people.

728
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:15.770
They leave after the show.
I didn't want to bug them.

729
00:44:15.771 --> 00:44:19.820
And then they walk out and then mania come up to me,

730
00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:24.260
you know,
let us do some Jaeger and they fucking spitting in your face and shit,

731
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:28.940
you know,
believe me.
All right.
But I know I made fun of God.
So now,
uh,

732
00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:29.540
you know,

733
00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.700
now all of a sudden I'm now all of a sudden you want to talk about people
making,

734
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:35.100
making money off of decent,
hardworking people.

735
00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:38.400
Take a look at fucking organized religion.
All right?

736
00:44:38.401 --> 00:44:40.230
Those guys don't make those guys live in pretty good.

737
00:44:40.231 --> 00:44:44.070
Scaring the fucking shit out of you.
Every God damn week.
All right.

738
00:44:44.071 --> 00:44:47.490
And I'm entitled to an opinion and I never was cramming,
in my opinion,

739
00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:50.040
down your throat.
I wasn't okay.

740
00:44:50.041 --> 00:44:53.850
You believe in what you believe in and I 100% respect that,

741
00:44:53.851 --> 00:44:57.240
but I have the right to question it.
You know,

742
00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:02.670
and you shouldn't find it shocking that I questioned it.
You should do,

743
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:06.120
shouldn't you just be what Jesus would do when Jesus just start praying for me.

744
00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:09.450
Anyways,
let's,
let's continue this just in case you're interested.

745
00:45:09.451 --> 00:45:10.560
I was raised Catholic,

746
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:14.640
married and raised my children Catholic and definitely have my doubts about the

747
00:45:14.641 --> 00:45:17.610
whole organized religion thing.
Great.
So you agree with me?

748
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:22.360
Not even sure that I believe in God.
Once again,
there's another appoint that we,

749
00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:23.213
that we agree on.

750
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:27.360
I lost my father three years ago and never would have uttered these words in his

751
00:45:27.361 --> 00:45:29.130
presence.
Neither would I.

752
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:34.050
What am I voice go up so they know what dude,

753
00:45:34.051 --> 00:45:38.520
I did it on a podcast.
All right,
I'm sorry your father passed away,

754
00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:40.950
but you know that has nothing to do with me.

755
00:45:40.951 --> 00:45:42.120
Do you understand what you're doing here?

756
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.000
Now all of a sudden you're making it seem like I'm walking in with my Mr

757
00:45:45.001 --> 00:45:49.980
microphone into the intensive care saying,
there's no god,
you know,

758
00:45:49.981 --> 00:45:53.940
whispering into somebody's ear in a coma.
He just go into the ground.

759
00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.040
We're all like,
dear,
I'm not doing that.

760
00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:59.430
I'm doing a podcast and I'm fucking around.
All right.

761
00:45:59.431 --> 00:46:02.190
If you want to take it seriously,
that's your problem.
Okay,

762
00:46:02.191 --> 00:46:06.150
and if you want to bring up your father passing away as some way to try to guilt

763
00:46:06.151 --> 00:46:10.860
me in to feeling like,
I mean,
you know what I'm saying?
In a hateful,
hurtful,

764
00:46:10.861 --> 00:46:14.010
fucking way.
Dude,
those are all your issues.
They have nothing to do with me.

765
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:16.580
All right,
send.

766
00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.470
He goes on to say that his dad believed that there was something out there

767
00:46:19.471 --> 00:46:22.230
responsible for all the beauty in the world,
uh,

768
00:46:22.231 --> 00:46:25.890
in our world and for our lives as human beings.
I don't even disagree with that.

769
00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:30.780
I just know human beings have no idea what it is until they fucking die.

770
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:34.290
So I'm not gonna sit there and listen to another human being who tries to scare

771
00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:38.670
the shit out of me and who living in a fucking palace telling me that if I

772
00:46:38.671 --> 00:46:40.410
become rich,
I'm not going to heaven.

773
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:44.340
I'm not out of my mind to think that that reeks of a fucking scam.

774
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:48.660
The same way late at night when they have those fucking gold coins that

775
00:46:48.661 --> 00:46:53.340
evidently are with 50 bucks and they're selling them for 1999 that that doesn't

776
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:58.170
recover.
Scam.
Somebody actually sent me a,
a,
an email.
Of course I didn't save it.

777
00:46:58.171 --> 00:47:03.060
Evidently get sprayed with like a dollar,
something worth of gold.
Okay,

778
00:47:03.061 --> 00:47:05.970
so they're making,
what is that?
A 2000% profit.

779
00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.380
All right.
Believe it or not,

780
00:47:10.381 --> 00:47:14.250
just because you're walking around and talking about religion and the afterlife

781
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:17.880
and and doing unto others and you're talking this great game,

782
00:47:17.881 --> 00:47:20.910
it doesn't mean that you can't be full of shit.

783
00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.113
<v 3>All right?</v>

784
00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:27.890
<v 1>Okay.
And I'm not saying that I'm right about what I feel,
but this is just it.</v>

785
00:47:27.891 --> 00:47:31.810
It reeks of,
of,
of,
of a scam.

786
00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:36.850
I really believe that there is some sort of thing out there and I wouldn't be

787
00:47:36.851 --> 00:47:39.460
surprised if there is something after this.

788
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:42.880
I wouldn't be surprised if you just go into the ground and you decay and you

789
00:47:42.881 --> 00:47:44.530
give life to the next fucking thing.

790
00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:49.470
I wouldn't be surprised if earth is punishment for something that I did in,

791
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:51.160
in a different solar system.

792
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:55.180
That's another thing about religion and forget about the dinosaurs is it doesn't

793
00:47:55.181 --> 00:47:58.420
even bring up space.
Okay.

794
00:47:58.421 --> 00:48:02.350
Let's say there is this all powerful big being.
Okay.
Okay.

795
00:48:02.351 --> 00:48:04.000
And I'm just trying to question this right now,

796
00:48:04.001 --> 00:48:06.580
so I'm not trying to be shocking or I'm just questioning this.

797
00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:11.140
Let's say there is this all powerful being being that created the everything

798
00:48:11.141 --> 00:48:15.040
that there is.
Okay?
The entire solar system.

799
00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:20.830
Why would you do all of that and just put people on this one planet that's like,

800
00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:25.030
you created an,
an uh,
uh,
you built this house that has

801
00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.850
an infinity basically amount of rooms,

802
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.570
bedrooms,
and you just put everybody,
you're only using one room in the house.

803
00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.780
It doesn't make any fucking sense whatsoever.

804
00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:43.750
And that's one thing about Scientology for as much shit as people give

805
00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:48.190
Scientology,
at least it has the brains to incorporate outer space,

806
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:53.230
you know?
I don't know if that's a really good point,

807
00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:57.670
if that's really fucking stupid,
but you know,
I don't fucking know.

808
00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:02.500
So anyways,
yeah,
dude,
I wasn't trying to offend you or anything that you fucking,

809
00:49:02.501 --> 00:49:06.010
I was just trying to be funny and I'm just fucking around and if you want to

810
00:49:06.011 --> 00:49:10.720
take this shit seriously,
that,
that is totally your fucking choice.
Um,

811
00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:14.800
you know,
that's it.
All right.
I'm fucking done with that.
All right,

812
00:49:14.801 --> 00:49:18.310
let's move on to the next person trashing me.
Um,

813
00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.260
oh,
what the fuck?

814
00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:23.210
<v 3>Okay.</v>

815
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:27.980
<v 1>Where the fuck is it?
Jesus Christ.
I think I only buy,
we put one of my thought,</v>

816
00:49:27.981 --> 00:49:30.230
I had another one.
I'm really just organize this week.

817
00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:33.380
That's because you don't have Jesus in your life.
You don't want to have Jason.

818
00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:37.590
Another guy said,
I love how you pick on a,
on a,
on a,
on a,
uh,
uh,

819
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:39.830
a punching bag of religion,
basically saying like,

820
00:49:39.831 --> 00:49:41.540
it's very easy to make fun of Christians,

821
00:49:41.541 --> 00:49:46.520
but I don't dare make fun of Muslims because if you make fun of them,
Oh Shit,

822
00:49:46.521 --> 00:49:47.720
look what's going to happen.
You know?

823
00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.990
And which I thought was fucking hilarious because the person was sitting there

824
00:49:50.991 --> 00:49:54.380
talking about how insensitive I am.
And then it basically,
in a round about way,

825
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:58.640
we're alluding to the fact that people who are Muslim means that you're a,

826
00:49:58.641 --> 00:50:01.760
you're a fucking,
uh,
uh,
you know,
you're going to blow up.

827
00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:05.690
Like they're all going to blow up planes and that type of shit.
You know,

828
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:08.090
I went to a wedding one time,
this girl was Pakistanian.

829
00:50:08.091 --> 00:50:11.930
They actually address that,
that what they fucking hate it was at all.
You know,

830
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:15.020
Christians thought that all of them just wanted to walk around blowing up shit.

831
00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:16.790
And,
uh,
and I also,

832
00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:19.730
it was funny that this guy's fucking sitting there suggesting that,
uh,

833
00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:23.270
people just because they're Christian,
that they're peaceful.
When do you know,

834
00:50:23.271 --> 00:50:27.800
what is it?
Once every 18 months,
some Jesus freaks fucking kills an doctor.

835
00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:32.860
That's pretty much par for the course,
isn't it?
Um,
no,
and it's,
it,

836
00:50:32.861 --> 00:50:35.450
it's not safe to make fun of Jesus freaks.
It really isn't.

837
00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:36.960
It really fucking isn't.

838
00:50:36.961 --> 00:50:41.960
And I think Bill Maher is out of his fucking mind to say what he says in like,

839
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:46.670
or actually has balls the size of the Grand Canyon to say what the fuck he says,

840
00:50:46.671 --> 00:50:50.920
and then just walk out in Wade into those people and just like,

841
00:50:50.921 --> 00:50:53.150
I would never do that shit anyways.

842
00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:57.440
And I got to admit the level with which that people take this shit seriously.

843
00:50:57.441 --> 00:51:01.550
It actually kind of creeps me out to eat,
to continue talking about this shit.
So,

844
00:51:01.551 --> 00:51:04.580
uh,
this might be the last fucking week of it because I've definitely made my

845
00:51:04.581 --> 00:51:05.450
fucking points.

846
00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.480
And at this point we're just going to go around in circles and I'm just going to

847
00:51:08.481 --> 00:51:13.280
piss people off.
So,
uh,
let's move on to this last guy.

848
00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:16.610
What?
She brought up some great points.
Um,

849
00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.360
all right,
set a bunch of Nice stuff.
And then he said,
all right,

850
00:51:20.361 --> 00:51:24.350
enough with the Dick Sucking.
I was going to,
I was going to criticize religion,

851
00:51:24.351 --> 00:51:28.990
but to describe those belief is,
is to mock them that,
and you know what dude?

852
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.710
That's what I learned.
Um,
yeah.
If you describe them,

853
00:51:33.711 --> 00:51:36.440
then you start making fun of them and then everybody gets mad.

854
00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:40.550
Or as you're saying,
they're just so ridiculous.
You just have to,
you know.

855
00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.700
Anyways,
let's fly ahead here.
Yeah.
He said,

856
00:51:43.701 --> 00:51:47.660
you mentioned needing a code in the absence of religion to live by.
Um,

857
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:52.100
I'm not sure how much,
um,
of the,
I don't read thing as a Shtick,

858
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:57.200
but I recommend an excellent text used in an intro to Undergrad and Undergrad

859
00:51:57.201 --> 00:52:02.030
ethics course called the elements of moral philosophy by James.

860
00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:05.050
I don't know if that's rock Kells or Rachael's.
Um,

861
00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:07.700
everybody goes on and on about Jesus.

862
00:52:07.701 --> 00:52:11.150
But Socrates who define morality is how we ought to live.

863
00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:14.870
Let it compelling life.
As you probably know.
Actually,
I don't,

864
00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:18.350
I just know him as a party reference.
Um,

865
00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:20.870
what do you fucking Socrates,
you know,

866
00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.930
that's one of those references that even more ons can use and get away with.

867
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.140
And I'm sad to say I'm one of those people.
Um,
he said,

868
00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:30.230
I didn't know the shit he was found guilty of corrupting the youth.

869
00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:35.390
He thought Zeus,
Venus areas,
et Cetera,
smacked of bullshit.

870
00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:40.310
All right?
Think about that.
Right?
They're corrupting the youth.

871
00:52:40.311 --> 00:52:44.240
Now I Christians,
Muslims and everybody today would say that.
Yeah,

872
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:48.470
that is bullshit.
That those people do not exist because now we've evolved to,

873
00:52:48.471 --> 00:52:51.980
there's only one God.
There's only one bank.

874
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:56.840
There's one world power.
Um,
and let's see.
And as punishment,

875
00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:01.310
he was forced to take his own life by drinking hemlock poison.

876
00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:06.380
Once again,
another death because of organized religion.
You know,

877
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:10.130
these Jesus freaks,
these,
these people who were into fucking,
I even got one.

878
00:53:10.131 --> 00:53:13.310
The reason why I don't make fun of,
uh,
the Muslim religion has really,

879
00:53:13.311 --> 00:53:14.750
because I don't know anything about it.

880
00:53:14.751 --> 00:53:17.330
And the reason why I make fun of Christianity is because that's what I was

881
00:53:17.331 --> 00:53:20.690
brought up.
And those are the stories that,
that I,

882
00:53:20.691 --> 00:53:25.580
that I hear and all I know about Muslims is basically,
uh,
you know,

883
00:53:25.610 --> 00:53:28.310
the couple of wars with Iraq.
So I basically don't know shit.

884
00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:29.141
I just think what you,

885
00:53:29.141 --> 00:53:33.260
you've wrapped your wrap your women up and bounty paper towels and then cut the

886
00:53:33.261 --> 00:53:36.290
clips off.
Am I wrong?
Am I wrong on that one?

887
00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:40.690
If they're not allowed to show their fucking songs because,
uh,

888
00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:44.150
you're going to get an erection and because you were that bed sheet,

889
00:53:44.151 --> 00:53:46.280
everybody's going to fucking see it.
I don't really think about it,

890
00:53:46.281 --> 00:53:49.010
but I would definitely make fun of it if I knew something about it,
but I don't.

891
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:49.580
All right.

892
00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:52.490
And I reserve the right to make fun of the fucker religion that I was brought
up.

893
00:53:52.491 --> 00:53:55.420
And,
um,
so anyways,
he says I'm,

894
00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:58.010
Socrates was a humble man,

895
00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:02.720
famously announcing all I know is my ignorance.
Um,

896
00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:07.010
he sought one.
I love people who would take that at face value.
He shut.

897
00:54:07.011 --> 00:54:09.620
He was your fucking moron right there.
Right there.
You know,

898
00:54:09.621 --> 00:54:13.520
Jesus is the solution.
He sought answers to questions,

899
00:54:13.521 --> 00:54:17.150
whereas religion prohibits questioning answers.

900
00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:18.410
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

901
00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:20.240
<v 1>a fucking brilliant.
This guy is really smart.</v>

902
00:54:20.241 --> 00:54:23.460
You should do a podcast instead of me.
I'm a fucking idiot.
Listened to that.

903
00:54:23.461 --> 00:54:25.400
He sought answers to questions,

904
00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:29.240
whereas religion prohibits questioning answers.

905
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:34.300
And if anything fucking proves that it's the 50 emails I got this week.
Ah,

906
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:36.320
I like how I'm actually asking like,

907
00:54:36.321 --> 00:54:40.220
I'm questioning religion on any sort of intelligent level.
Um,
I think actually,

908
00:54:40.221 --> 00:54:42.940
I think I am just because I say cut and fuck doesn't mean I'm not,
uh,

909
00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:47.510
bringing up some good questions.
All right.
Let's finish this for,
uh,
for Socrates.

910
00:54:47.511 --> 00:54:49.760
The unexamined life is not worth living.

911
00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:51.020
<v 3>Okay.</v>

912
00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:54.710
<v 1>Um,
his sentiments on marriage and nagging women are remarkably,</v>

913
00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:58.790
remarkably similar to your own,
so underrated.
Socrates,

914
00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:02.360
overrated.
Jesus.
Uh,

915
00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:07.440
yeah,
yeah.
That's,
you know,
that's dead.
That is the one thing,

916
00:55:07.441 --> 00:55:08.430
and I'm not being a dick here,

917
00:55:08.431 --> 00:55:13.431
that I don't understand about people who like I respect people who who you know

918
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:17.010
are raised in religion or,

919
00:55:17.011 --> 00:55:21.090
or find a religion that speaks to them and that they decided to commit their

920
00:55:21.091 --> 00:55:23.710
lives to what?
And what I don't understand is,
you know,

921
00:55:23.711 --> 00:55:28.260
and it brings you this piece,
right?
Am I wrong there?
All right,

922
00:55:28.261 --> 00:55:32.850
so it brings you this piece,
but then if anybody questions,

923
00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.050
<v 3>okay.</v>

924
00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:39.310
<v 1>That belief that you have,
how quickly it turns violent,</v>

925
00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:46.250
like the amount of people who died because they question these a holy people is

926
00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:54.770
you don't find that fucking like hilarious and ridiculous on any level.

927
00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.490
Like they're sitting there calling the other person the devil because they're

928
00:55:59.491 --> 00:56:04.491
questioning their beliefs and they're saying that that other person is going to

929
00:56:04.591 --> 00:56:09.210
hell and then they turn around and kill the person because they don't believe in

930
00:56:09.211 --> 00:56:11.760
the holy pure way that they live their life.
I mean,
I just,

931
00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:13.140
I can't get behind that.

932
00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:15.000
<v 3>Okay.</v>

933
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.120
<v 1>I can't get behind that the same way.
Is it the same way?</v>

934
00:56:18.121 --> 00:56:19.680
It's just because you're a red sox fan,

935
00:56:19.681 --> 00:56:24.030
you can't recognize the talent of Derek Jeter and I gotta be do full cubies you

936
00:56:24.031 --> 00:56:27.450
fig.
Now he's the shit.

937
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:32.850
I don't know.
I don't want to fucking know why.
Why do I continue with this shit?

938
00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:37.050
Um,
I dunno.
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,
that's the podcast for this week.

939
00:56:37.051 --> 00:56:39.540
And once again,
I'm not disrespecting your religions.
Okay?

940
00:56:39.541 --> 00:56:44.490
But this is my podcast and when I bring shit up,
I fucking go off on it.
And I,

941
00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:49.580
and I definitely go over the top saying that somebody was pet play in the

942
00:56:51.061 --> 00:56:55.710
upright bass with Jesus is juggler is fucking hilarious because it's over the

943
00:56:55.711 --> 00:56:59.010
top.
And I believe the God in my world thinks it's funny.

944
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:00.460
<v 3>Okay.</v>

945
00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:03.130
<v 1>He's God.
Why would he be intimidated?
I,
there's another thing too.</v>

946
00:57:03.131 --> 00:57:07.060
I don't understand why God would make all this stuff.
Okay.

947
00:57:07.061 --> 00:57:10.450
And then just be so doe angry all the time.
Jesus Christ here.

948
00:57:10.451 --> 00:57:14.950
I gone back in it again.
I got a lot of questions.
Fuck you.
It's by podcast.

949
00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.080
I know.
That's why I don't understand.

950
00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:20.283
<v 3>Okay.</v>

951
00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.520
<v 1>You know,
I,
it's,
it's more like,
you know,
when you,</v>

952
00:57:22.521 --> 00:57:25.160
when you build a bookshelf and yet you're just standing back a Meijer and your

953
00:57:25.161 --> 00:57:28.280
work and then it falls down on the floor and you're like God damn fucking piece

954
00:57:28.281 --> 00:57:32.120
of Shit and you start blaming the bookshelf even though you made it,

955
00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:35.120
you're the one who put it up there.
You know,

956
00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:39.310
I guess technically.
Dot.
God didn't make a,

957
00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:44.340
he didn't make titty bars.
I guess those are man made,
but uh,

958
00:57:44.341 --> 00:57:48.480
you know the broad cinema ma or
wow.

959
00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:51.630
I'm really fucking,
I was just going to say,
made in his image.
Isn't that,

960
00:57:51.631 --> 00:57:56.550
isn't that what you guys say?
They found a dabble.
Dabble.

961
00:57:56.551 --> 00:58:00.210
They got the devil in him.
Um,
all right.
What have,

962
00:58:00.211 --> 00:58:02.520
all I'm saying is because it really got serious this week,
people,

963
00:58:02.521 --> 00:58:04.770
people really get fucking,
they took it a little too seriously.
All right,

964
00:58:04.771 --> 00:58:08.790
so back the fuck off.
Stop taking it so God damn seriously.
And you know,

965
00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:12.690
why don't you actually practice what your preacher preaches and why don't you go

966
00:58:12.691 --> 00:58:17.220
pray for me?
Why don't you do that instead of coming on here telling me,
you know,

967
00:58:17.221 --> 00:58:20.670
you've given me your wrath.
Isn't that one of the seven deadly sins?

968
00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:22.150
You fucking maniacs.

969
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:27.270
You just as fucked up as I am and you don't know shit either.
Alright.

970
00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:33.150
Alright.
I'm sorry.
God bless all of you.
Okay.

971
00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:37.020
I hope you find what works for you and a seriously,
if I'm bugging you,

972
00:58:37.021 --> 00:58:39.690
don't listen to the podcast.
God knows I'm not making any money off it.

973
00:58:39.691 --> 00:58:43.170
I don't give a fuck.
Ah,
that's it.
You guys all have a great weekend.
A,

00:58:43.171 --> 00:58:44.820
I tell you where I was going to be this week,

975
00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:49.740
but I'm worried some Jesus freak is going to show up.
So,
uh,
that's it.
That's it.

976
00:58:49.741 --> 00:58:52.800
Have a great week and I'll talk to you next Monday.
Hopefully

977
00:59:31.350 --> 00:59:31.960
<v 6>some.</v>
