00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.820
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:06.090
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.910
January 21st,
2013 how's it go?

4
00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:15.911
And you get the day off on Matt King Day.

5
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.420
Is it Martin Luther King Day?
I think it is.
I'm not sure.

6
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.400
I have no fucking idea.
Um,
I saw it mentioned,

7
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.810
somebody said something about Martin Luther King on the Internet,

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.510
on Facebook,
and it was a white guy.

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.410
So I figured white guys will only comment about mountain Martin Luther King

10
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.190
around Martin Luther King Day.
So I'm going with that.
You know,

11
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:45.360
this is one of these times a year where it's fucking George Washington Day in

12
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:49.700
Lincoln Day that's present.
Is this the same day?
This?
Well,

13
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.070
there's a couple of these days here.
We're,

14
00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:54.270
all of a sudden everybody's got a day off and I'm suspecting that people have a

15
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:55.710
day off because,
uh,

16
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.250
I went over to nhl.com to see if the Bruins were playing tonight.

17
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:01.050
And Lo and behold,
they're playing right now,

18
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.340
one to one after one period,
you know,
and I'm like,

19
00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:11.690
well,
who the fuck is at that gate?
Shouldn't everybody be at work.
And I was like,

20
00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:15.800
wait a minute.
Some white guy said something about Martha.
Ah,
Shit.

21
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:17.390
It's a fucking day off.

22
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.650
It's a beautiful day off in the neighborhood.

23
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.850
[inaudible] um,

24
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.430
how great is it that hockey's back for hockey fans?

25
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.070
I can't believe how much I missed it.
Um,

26
00:01:31.071 --> 00:01:34.280
I actually started this podcast late cause I wanted to watch the first period,

27
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.790
um,
on my computer.

28
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.760
I watched a ton of sports this weekend.

29
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.840
I will get to the football in my patriots losing.
Um,

30
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.480
which dude,
what?
Fuck it,
I'll get to a right now.

31
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.530
I did I call it or did I call it [inaudible] been telling you all year the

32
00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:57.590
Patriots different stinks and that fucking what's his face?

33
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.520
Tay?
Leave quietly over the fuck you say his name.

34
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.540
That guy was the glue that was holding that thing together.

35
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.870
He was shutting down that whole side of the field when he pulled up lame with

36
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:11.900
his hamstring.
There I was,
I texted Versie I said,

37
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:16.880
watch Joe FLACCO air quote heat up.
And that was the end of it.

38
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.440
And uh,
that's it.
I don't know how many more fucking examples you need.

39
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.120
I don't give a shit how good your quarterback is.

40
00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:26.870
If you don't have a fucking defense,
you're gonna lose.

41
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.430
And I shut it off before I had to watch Ray Lewis cry again and thank Jesus,

42
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.743
you know,

43
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.590
for helping them to win this football game when Jesus does not give a shit.

44
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.410
You know,
I would never say this to Ray Lewis.

45
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.300
I wouldn't even say it to his nostrils.

46
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.430
<v 0>Okay.</v>

47
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.851
<v 1>I don't know why.</v>

48
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:51.690
It's the first thing I thought of when that guy gets going is fucking no starts

49
00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:52.160
flaring.

50
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.490
He's literally like a God they bull probably forget about what are the greatest,

51
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.070
he's basically the lt of a,
I

52
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.680
<v 2>wouldn't even say he's not,
no one's Lt lts lt,
but whatever.</v>

53
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:06.940
He's the closest thing to lt that the AFC has ever had.
But uh,

54
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:09.010
when that guy gets going,
man,
I just,
you know,

55
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.620
he's the kind of guy you would just agree to.

56
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:15.650
Whatever the fuck he was saying once he fucking gets going.
You know,
I,

57
00:03:15.651 --> 00:03:18.700
I watched a thing on Ray Lewis one time.
I think I've brought this up before.

58
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.100
They did a behind the scenes,
whatever you know,
beyond the lines

59
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.960
<v 1>with,
without that original ESPN guy.
Right.</v>

60
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.130
And they did a whole thing on fucking Ray Lewis and Ray Lewis was talking about

61
00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:36.030
his dad that took off on him.
I don't know if you guys have ever seen this.

62
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.050
And uh,

63
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.700
he and ray went to the same high school his dad went to and he always wanted his

64
00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:43.890
dad to show up to a game and his dad never showed up.

65
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:48.270
So he just started breaking his dad's records and he starts getting all intents.

66
00:03:48.271 --> 00:03:48.600
He's like,

67
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.860
and in every record that I broke and their play in this fucking keyboard in the

68
00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:54.820
background,
just one note,
just an,

69
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.250
and it's intense fucking one with this weird effect on it.

70
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.220
That was the most intense thing I ever saw in my life.

71
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.490
I though it was so fucking unreal.
I actually,

72
00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:07.980
I went to the gym for two weeks straight.
That's how,

73
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.080
that's how inspiring ray Lewis's

74
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.510
<v 2>every day I'd wake up and I,
you know,
after like three days,
you know,</v>

75
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.670
I start slipping back into who I really am,
which is a fucking pussy.

76
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:22.720
He wants to lay on the couch and eat cheese doodles by just kept hearing.

77
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.970
As you know,
I just kept hearing,
you know,
ray Lewis would go to the gym.

78
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.370
Ray Lewis is at the fucking gym right now

79
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.130
doing butterflies with his nostrils,
you know,
just flaring them out.

80
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.520
So anyways,
yeah,
I didn't stick around to watch that.

81
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.880
Jesus does not care,
you know,
or God or,
or Galloway,

82
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.380
whoever the fuck he pray to.
You got to think that,
you know,

83
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.880
I had of his laundry lists of dreams that he's going to make true would probably

84
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.140
be people a,
I'm being held captive.
Uh,

85
00:04:55.141 --> 00:04:59.940
I think they're going to saw my head off on Al Jazeera.
Uh,
I,

86
00:04:59.941 --> 00:05:00.520
I make

87
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.230
<v 1>Nike fucking sneakers and a sweatshop.
How bout,
uh,
how bout a cubicle?
God,</v>

88
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:08.380
can you hook me up?
How about every other Saturday?

89
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.480
Maybe I could only work 17 hours.

90
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.310
I think those prayers are a little higher on the,
uh,
on the list,

91
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.930
<v 2>you know,
then can I please when this,
this,
this footy game.</v>

92
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.580
But um,
anyways,
I'm actually excited about the Superbowl now.

93
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.000
I was kind of glad the Patriots lost in a way because I didn't want to see Tom

94
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.030
Brady lose another fucking Superbowl and listened to morons below.

95
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.180
<v 1>Oh,
was it for now?
Now what's with them?</v>

96
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.740
<v 2>Like you can literally like,
oh,</v>

97
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.490
he was the shit and could win Superbowls in what now he forgot how to do it.

98
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.720
You know,
I,
I don't,
I can't,
I can't talk to people.

99
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.910
I can't talk to people who do shit.
I,

100
00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:51.660
and also like people who will be like the pages Gilligan with fucking 90 half

101
00:05:51.661 --> 00:05:55.020
point fave,
which eight and a half a game time.
What the fuck dude?

102
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.060
What a fucking upset.
Right?

103
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.230
<v 1>You know that fucking Espn Shit.
Look,
this is the deal.</v>

104
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:04.910
Morons,

105
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.810
morons in general gamble on football and when playoffs come around playoffs

106
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.820
every more.
It's like the super bowl.

107
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.710
Everybody who didn't even fucking watch shows up to watch that Goddamn game.

108
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:19.880
And this is same thing with playoffs.

109
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:24.350
These gamblers who don't watch come out of the fucking weekend,
warrior gamblers,

110
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:28.520
they come out,
they don't know shit about football.
You know,

111
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.010
they barely watch it,
but they know Tom Brady and bill Belichick.
Oh,
they play in,

112
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.650
let me put some money on them.
That's why the spread is so wide.

113
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.260
You know what I mean?
That's what that,
that's basically what it is.
It's,

114
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.130
it's Vegas is trying to get money on both sides of the ball.

115
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.990
So what they have to do is,

116
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:51.830
because there's so many fucking rubes out there who the second they see Tom

117
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.640
Brady and that dimple in his chin and his fucking [inaudible],

118
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.280
they're going to throw down a hundred bucks on him basically.
At that point,

119
00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:00.830
if the Patriots win,
they're gonna lose their shirts.
So they got,

120
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:02.660
they got a fucking expand the spread.

121
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.560
Everybody else who's been watching all year,
it's like,
well wait a minute.

122
00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:10.430
The fucking patriots played the Ravens earlier this year and the game was 31 to

123
00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:13.880
30 we'll let them 30 fucking points to this team.
Only one by one.

124
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.440
Why the fuck would we be nine and a half point favorites a mere four months

125
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:19.790
later,
you know,

126
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.123
<v 4>I don't know.</v>

127
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.920
<v 2>Or is this hindsight?
Is 2020?
I'm just saying whatever.</v>

128
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.560
Congratulations to the ravens.
Uh,
once again,

129
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.910
your defense has got you there.
And I,
for one,

130
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.230
I'm going to Ms. Ray Lewis,

131
00:07:35.231 --> 00:07:38.890
but I am not going to miss playing the fucking ravens with that goddamn defense.

132
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.390
I'm not.
And I think you have Trent Dilfer 2.0 at quarterback.

133
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.840
I'm not buying into this guy actually had a conversation with somebody and I was

134
00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.220
like,
I don't even like,
he goes,
Yep,

135
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.070
<v 1>come on man.
He goes,
he doesn't stink.
He's in the top 10 in the league.</v>

136
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.460
I don't think he is.
I think he's like 12.

137
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.770
You know,
I would put Peyton Brady breeze,

138
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.450
Aaron Rodgers.

139
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.480
I put Matt running ahead of him and I kept my voice crack when I said Matt Ryan

140
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.120
People,
I will put me Ryan ahead of him.

141
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.000
I'd rather have an what the fuck is with my boy.

142
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:19.890
<v 4>Okay.</v>

143
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.600
<v 1>Um,
I got to go see a nutritionist.</v>

144
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.200
<v 2>So it says here on your chart that you're experiencing phlegm and your voice is</v>

145
00:08:27.201 --> 00:08:29.000
cracking on your podcast.

146
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.570
<v 1>Um,
I put,
I put Andrew Luck.
I'd read them.
Andrew luck than Joe Flacco.</v>

147
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.650
Who else can I throw out there to Piss off some Baltimore Fan?

148
00:08:37.651 --> 00:08:40.260
Then I can be pissed.
They're in the Superbowl.
So here we go.

149
00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:44.040
Harbaugh versus Harbaugh competing for daddy's attention.

150
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.590
Who Do you think's going to win?
You know,

151
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.120
I'll tell you right now,
this is the only way I feel the ravens are going to win.

152
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.970
Okay.
Okay.
Because I,
I,

153
00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.510
this is Jim Harbaugh.
Ah,
I think,

154
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:01.620
<v 4>okay.</v>

155
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.620
<v 1>The only thing he has to worry about is right now he is unbelievably under</v>

156
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:07.933
nourished.

157
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.490
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

158
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:14.490
<v 1>Am I the only guy who's noticed the transformation in his fucking chest,</v>

159
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:18.600
his neck,
his shoulders and his face?
He,

160
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.180
he used to be fucking jacked and I swear to God,

161
00:09:22.181 --> 00:09:26.890
I think that that guy is looking at x's and o's and some walk in closet in the

162
00:09:26.891 --> 00:09:31.891
bowels of fucking candle stick for like 20 hours a day and he's not eating

163
00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.290
because now he's wearing dockers.

164
00:09:35.291 --> 00:09:38.070
He starting to look like Bill Clinton used to look before the heart attack.

165
00:09:38.071 --> 00:09:41.950
We've got those mother and hips and he's,
he's getting all fucking gaunt.

166
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.140
Somebody's got to get that guy,
his steak,
you know,
get them some suck.

167
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.060
Some fucking,
uh,
what do you call those things?
Dumb bells.

168
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:56.290
Get him something perfect pushup.
I Dunno what it is.

169
00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.540
He doesn't give a fuck how he dresses.

170
00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.000
He's been wearing that stupid black pullover,

171
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:05.680
that linty thing with those dockers.
Mandy,
he,
he's,
he's,
he's scaring me.

172
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.010
<v 2>You know,
somebody get that guy is say,
I want you to be like,
listen,</v>

173
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.010
I know you're driven,
but for the love of God,
can you fucking eat something?

174
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.720
We're right.
We're right on the cusp.

175
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.480
<v 1>Um,
but I,
you know,</v>

176
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.660
I don't have any major predictions other than I think the 40 niners are going to

177
00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:25.290
win.
I think they're going to,
I think that,
uh,

178
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.850
I just don't,
I think that defense is good enough.
I don't feel,
you know,

179
00:10:31.851 --> 00:10:34.550
I don't fuck,
I don't know shit about the Ford 49 is a weird,

180
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.720
they play the Patriots.
They put up 31 points on it on us and our shade defense,

181
00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:41.060
and then they play Seattle,
which I think is the debt teams,

182
00:10:41.061 --> 00:10:45.110
the future and the NFC,
if they can keep everybody there,

183
00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:48.040
they got that unbelievable defense.
They fucking shut them down,
right?

184
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.580
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

185
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.630
<v 1>They play the falcons.</v>

186
00:10:50.631 --> 00:10:54.860
The falcons are fucking scoring points like Goddamn pinball machine to start it

187
00:10:54.861 --> 00:10:55.581
out.
So I don't know.

188
00:10:55.581 --> 00:11:00.080
I don't know that I have that much faith in those guys as much as I did a few

189
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.010
months ago.
But I do know this.

190
00:11:01.011 --> 00:11:04.790
I don't think anybody listening really gives a fuck.
Good Lord.

191
00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:09.080
Am I turning into one of those analysts?
If I'm the fucking 49 his defense,

192
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.700
I gotta be thinking,
um,

193
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:17.360
<v 2>oh,
here's one.
Did you guys watch,

195
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:20.450
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

196
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.120

Let me,
let me do a little advertising before I get into that,</v>

Lord,
is that just literally directed at me?
I got to do all of that stuff.

230
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:19.930
I got to get a will.

231
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:22.240
<v 1>You know,</v>

232
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.350
I gotta make sure all my ducks are in a row here considering I fly every other

233
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.530
weekend.
Did you see that frigging story with a,
yeah,
they had a ground,

234
00:13:29.531 --> 00:13:30.364
that airplane,

235
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.870
they had a problem with the battery had the problem with the battery,
you know,

236
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.000
like your car,
except it's a fucking plane,

237
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.223
<v 4>you know,</v>

238
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.650
<v 1>I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
All right,</v>

239
00:13:41.651 --> 00:13:43.000
let's get back to Lance Armstrong.

240
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:48.780
So Oprah had an in depth interview with Lance Armstrong was a dump.

241
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.470
It was actually fucking hilarious.

242
00:13:50.471 --> 00:13:54.190
I was watching it with the lovely Nia and uh,

243
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.010
I was just laughing my ass off.

244
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.780
<v 2>It was,
it was phenomenal.</v>

245
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.160
<v 1>Like she's sitting there going like,
um,
so we,
we,</v>

246
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.580
you basically injecting,
you know,

247
00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:13.410
fucking horse Jizz steroids into you for every race.

248
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:18.390
And he's like,
yes,
yes,
I will.
I wait for all tours.
He's like,
yes,

249
00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:23.250
I was.
She's like,
did you consider it cheating?
And he's like,
ah,

250
00:14:23.251 --> 00:14:24.780
at the time,
no,
no,
I didn't.

251
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.090
It's like a course he didn't,
you know,
what pissed me off about Lance,

252
00:14:33.091 --> 00:14:36.240
I guess it was kind of a good move on his part that he didn't go like Oprah.

253
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:40.560
Did you do any research into this sport?
Did you notice the top 20 guys?

254
00:14:40.561 --> 00:14:45.000
We're all fucking doing this shit to,
you got to fight fire with fire.

255
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.750
You can't bring a knife to a gun fight if everybody else is jacked up.

256
00:14:48.751 --> 00:14:52.660
I got to be jacked up too.
For Fuck Sakes.
The worst thing.
No,
I didn't.

257
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.910
I actually liked the opera interview and it was kind of funny watching her be

258
00:14:55.911 --> 00:15:00.510
dumbfounded.
Bye.
This guy's complete lack of,

259
00:15:00.511 --> 00:15:02.430
uh,
you know,

260
00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:06.180
just not giving a shit when he was cheating.
Um,

261
00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.640
and then the whole thing was funny to me,
cause I,
you know,

262
00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:11.580
I'm old enough to remember when Oprah used to interview fucking midgets who want

263
00:15:11.581 --> 00:15:14.820
to fuck their mailman's brother,
you know,
so I dunno,

264
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.180
I feel like she kinda cheated her way up to,
didn't shake.

265
00:15:18.181 --> 00:15:21.390
Then you kind of host a carnival shelf to get where you are acting and then all

266
00:15:21.391 --> 00:15:25.110
of a sudden you went like,
wait a minute.
I've been doing some soul searching.

267
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:30.510
That's completely not the same thing.
I just like making fun of Oprah.
So,
um,

268
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.230
anyways,
they do the whole interview and then,
uh,

269
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.680
they go on ESPN.
This,

270
00:15:39.681 --> 00:15:43.160
this was like ESPN this week was just a total mail hissy fit.

271
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.930
You know,
that stupid Notre Dame story.

272
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:51.460
Have you ever seen more of a non fucking story in your life?

273
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.570
Why do I give a shit about that?
He didn't lie to me.

274
00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.860
I don't even care if he knew it was a made up person and he wanted more

275
00:15:59.861 --> 00:16:04.600
attention.
I think that's fucking hilarious.
That's hilarious to me.

276
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:08.980
And if he got away with it,
good for him.
I don't give a fuck.
Why don't,

277
00:16:08.981 --> 00:16:13.840
why do I give a shit
if anybody for the love of God,
like four or five days.

278
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.910
So this is that it takes today.
It takes another bizarre turn.

279
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.740
I don't know.
I,
I,
you know what,
I so don't give a fuck.

280
00:16:23.741 --> 00:16:26.920
I don't even have anything funny to say about it.
You know,

281
00:16:26.921 --> 00:16:31.300
it's funny that Nia finally wanted to pay attention to ESPN and uh,

282
00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:32.830
what I ended up doing was I,

283
00:16:32.831 --> 00:16:34.900
cause I couldn't listen to it for more than a minute.

284
00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:38.260
I just hit record on sports center for the first time ever.

285
00:16:38.261 --> 00:16:42.280
I recorded sports center for her and I had to turn the channel because I don't

286
00:16:42.281 --> 00:16:44.650
give a shit about a football players love life.

287
00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:46.613
<v 4>You know,</v>

288
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.800
<v 1>nobody died,</v>

289
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.553
<v 4>right?</v>

290
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.990
<v 1>Nobody got killed.
There was no nobody.
You know,</v>

291
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.460
you would have thought a double murder happened to.
I don't know.
So anyways,

292
00:16:57.461 --> 00:16:59.240
so I'm watching fucking Rick Riley,

293
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:04.780
Rick Riley's talking about Lance Armstrong and I guess Rick Riley was backing

294
00:17:05.061 --> 00:17:10.061
Lance and he was just having this hissy fit about his reputation because he back

295
00:17:10.891 --> 00:17:15.170
Lance Armstrong like anybody gives a flying fuck about Rick Riley

296
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:20.070
when Lance Armstrong,
when he finally,
you know,
came out that he did it.

297
00:17:20.071 --> 00:17:23.370
Did anybody go like,
oh my God.

298
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.370
Now what happens to Rick Riley?

299
00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:31.440
Like he made that whole fucking thing about himself.
You know he made,

300
00:17:31.441 --> 00:17:33.750
he said they're going,
he made me look like a fool.

301
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:39.600
I was typing things,
supporting him.
Rick,
relax.

302
00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.010
Nobody's blaming you.
Nobody gives a flying.
Fuck this.
This really isn't on you.

303
00:17:44.011 --> 00:17:47.400
This is about lance.
This isn't about you.
Okay,

304
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:51.180
so why don't you just close laptop,
fucking relax.

305
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.150
<v 3>Okay.</v>

306
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:57.310
<v 1>Like he felt betrayed.
It's like,
Rick,</v>

307
00:17:57.311 --> 00:17:59.530
what are you fucking special?
He lied to the whole world.

308
00:17:59.531 --> 00:18:03.680
He's not going to lie to you.
Like,
Hey,
listen,

309
00:18:03.681 --> 00:18:06.720
I know I just went on national television and said that I,
uh,
I,

310
00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:10.520
I don't cheat in those races,
but I,
I actually am cheating.

311
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:15.890
Uh,
I've cheated every race and I plan to continue cheating in the future.

312
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:19.940
And now that you know that,
um,
I have to kill you.

313
00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.060
You know,
I don't know.

314
00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.720
I was really hoping for more on all both of those subjects.

315
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:31.900
I was hoping that I was going to have something a little more funnier.
You don't,

316
00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:36.290
is I just,
I'm worn out.
I don't give a F.
I,
I've just,

317
00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:43.180
I watched that fucking game yesterday and we lost and Nia was going to go see

318
00:18:43.181 --> 00:18:45.940
lady Gaga last night and at the last second,

319
00:18:45.941 --> 00:18:49.960
her friend bailed actually the day before her friend bailed.

320
00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:54.070
So she goes,
do you want to go?
Would you go with me?
And I was just like,
yeah,

321
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.770
I'll fucking go to that.
I'll go to it.
And I'm a comedian.

322
00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.050
I need to know what the fuck's going on in pop culture.

323
00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:02.230
I will go to this stuff and I would go to this thing.
And she goes,

324
00:19:02.231 --> 00:19:06.370
do you realize how funny is it going to be if somebody who listens to your

325
00:19:06.371 --> 00:19:09.640
podcast is at that thing and sees you at that?
And I said,
yeah,

326
00:19:09.641 --> 00:19:13.600
it's going to be fucking hilarious.
So I went down there and get ready to see,

327
00:19:13.601 --> 00:19:17.740
you know,
no,
let,
let's,
let's tell this in chronological Ori Order.

328
00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.300
I'm watching the Patriots game over a buddy of mine's house and I'm just

329
00:19:22.301 --> 00:19:27.010
pounding beers.
I don't know why I bought a 12 pack.

330
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.840
They were set up and I just felt like I had to knock them all down.
And I think,

331
00:19:31.841 --> 00:19:34.690
I think I had at least seven of them,
if not eight.

332
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.330
And somebody else who was digging into him too.
I can't fucking remember

333
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.560
one of those things where you're not really totally hammered,

334
00:19:41.561 --> 00:19:44.470
but you forget your sunglasses.
You don't like that kind of level drunk.

335
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.790
So,
and how I got to race home and,
uh,

336
00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.420
you know,
shut myself off in the third quarter,
just like I'm at the game.

337
00:19:55.421 --> 00:19:59.960
I just start drinking waters and eating fucking chicken wings and shit and a

338
00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:05.530
sober up jump in the car,
drive home,
put on a shirt.
Oh wait,
no,

339
00:20:05.531 --> 00:20:06.580
we took a cab.
That's right.

340
00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:10.540
We ended up taking a cab over to staples center and we miss the open act,

341
00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:13.540
which I'm like bonus,
cause I know I'm not going to like them.

342
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.100
And we come fucking walking into the staples center and right as the show starts

343
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:24.120
and lady Gaga comes out of a fake castle on a horse and starts walking around

344
00:20:24.971 --> 00:20:26.590
the arena and you only do that big thing.

345
00:20:26.591 --> 00:20:29.620
Now they got like the big fucking half a semi circle loop with a bunch of

346
00:20:29.621 --> 00:20:33.230
fucking raven kids in the middle of it.
And um,

347
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:38.980
that's what started it off.
And then she sang one of her songs and then,

348
00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:39.850
uh,

349
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:45.280
then she went back into the castle and then all of a sudden it looked like it

350
00:20:45.281 --> 00:20:46.750
was a Turkey with its legs.

351
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:49.570
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

352
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:53.770
<v 1>And,
uh,
she came out of the vagina that unzipped it and came out of that,</v>

353
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.633
you know?

354
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:56.360
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

355
00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:01.100
<v 1>And then sang another fucking song,
you know,
bunch of shredded gay guys,</v>

356
00:21:01.101 --> 00:21:04.250
old five,
six,
seven,
eight,
all at the same fucking time.

357
00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:09.980
And then she just starts spewing this fucking self-help Horse Shit,

358
00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:15.900
you know,
doing that stupid dramatic pause to milk the crowd.
She says like,

359
00:21:15.901 --> 00:21:16.830
you know,

360
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:20.770
<v 5>it's great to be here today.
Los Angeles there is like,</v>

361
00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.130
<v 4>okay,</v>

362
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:28.520
<v 5>okay.
The message out there for anyone who's ever felt different,</v>

363
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.780
if you feel different.
No,
they blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

364
00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:37.540
<v 1>Fucking bullshit about being,
it was literally like,</v>

365
00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.820
it was like gay spinal tap.

366
00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:41.770
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

367
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:46.240
<v 1>And it was honestly,
it was a terrible fucking show.
Terrible show.</v>

368
00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:50.650
The fucking dancing was terrible.
She can sing,
but she stinks.
It dancing.

369
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.800
She's on a fucking horse.
She comes out of a vagina.

370
00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:58.090
How many times has that been done?
Why did you come out of the vagina,
Lady Gaga?

371
00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.940
Let me guess.
This album was a rebirth for you.

372
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:06.070
You fucking hack ripping off Madonna right left.
First of all,

373
00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:10.330
she's got that one song that I've,
I don't know what Madonna's song is.

374
00:22:10.331 --> 00:22:14.080
I never know.
I,
whenever I hear it,
I start singing the other Madonna song.

375
00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:17.290
She right,
she's ripping off Madonna right down.

376
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:19.660
She had a black Jesus,

377
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.070
<v 4>okay.</v>

378
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.680
<v 1>And the crowds eating it up.
And I'll,
and I,
at first I'm like,</v>

379
00:22:23.681 --> 00:22:28.300
you gotta be fucking,
she's doing the black Jesus thing,
like a prayer.

380
00:22:28.301 --> 00:22:33.010
Am I the only gun?
I looked around,
I was like,
Oh my God,
I'm old.
I'm old.

381
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:34.751
I'm fucking old.

382
00:22:34.751 --> 00:22:37.270
And I'm sitting there and all I want to do is just start trashing.

383
00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.250
I want to start heckling,

384
00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:43.160
which I did a couple of times in Nia just gave me the look and I was like,

385
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.930
I can't ruin this for her.

386
00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.620
She was going to go here with somebody else who's going to be waving glow
sticks.

387
00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.820
And I agreed to come here.
I can't be a cunt.
So,
um,

388
00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:57.890
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I sat down after the first fucking song and,

389
00:22:57.891 --> 00:23:00.290
uh,
it was really difficult to listen to.

390
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:02.990
It was really fucking annoying.

391
00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.630
Way More knowing that I thought I was going to be I that that was gonna be all

392
00:23:06.631 --> 00:23:10.730
right.
You know,
it's still going to be on some level.
Appreciate it.

393
00:23:10.731 --> 00:23:14.390
This is pop shit.
I can try to come here and enjoy this shit,
and it was,

394
00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:15.740
it just really wasn't a good show.

395
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:19.730
I can't fucking,

396
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.710
<v 4>okay.</v>

397
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.630
<v 1>Oh,
with the stupid dramatic pauses,</v>

398
00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.960
why does singers always have to look up in the air halfway through a sentence

399
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.090
and just get another applause break?

400
00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.490
I saw a band the other night and this little fucking club and the guy was doing

401
00:23:33.491 --> 00:23:38.140
that.
He was like,
you know,
this is the first time.

402
00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.290
Then he looks up to see you like,

403
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.620
and it's just dead silence and then the crowd always gives into the fucking

404
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:45.583
silence.

405
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.680
I don't know if they feel uncomfortable with and they just feel they have to

406
00:23:48.681 --> 00:23:50.610
fill it up by going,
Woo.

407
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:56.210
Then the guy finishes the sentence that we'd been in Los Angeles in three years.

408
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:01.490
It's like,
why couldn't you just complete that sentence?
Why couldn't you just go,

409
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:02.031
hey,
you know,

410
00:24:02.031 --> 00:24:06.920
this is the first time we've been in Los Angeles for La for like three years and

411
00:24:06.921 --> 00:24:09.290
we're happy to be back cause you guys are great fans.

412
00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.110
You could do that and like fucking what was that?

413
00:24:12.111 --> 00:24:16.610
How long did it take me to say that?
3.5 seconds.
It takes him like 30 seconds.

414
00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.280
Los Angeles is a city

415
00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.980
that's on the west coast of this country and you know,

416
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:34.320
I was fucking horrible.
So anyways,
Lady Gaga is on stage.

417
00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:39.360
I can't believe I have this fucking story.
I feel like I dreamed it.
Um,

418
00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:44.490
she just goes,
she's fixed finishes another one,
her fucking horseshit songs.

419
00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:49.540
I think at that point she was like dry humping a Yak to protest,
uh,

420
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.050
some sort of Middle Eastern thing.
I don't know what the fuck was going on.

421
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.490
And by the way,
they heard drummer was the shit.

422
00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:59.130
And I really would have enjoyed watching him,

423
00:24:59.131 --> 00:25:03.720
but he appeared to be in the dungeon section inside the fucking castle because

424
00:25:03.721 --> 00:25:07.620
God forbid that somebody else out on the fucking stage taken away from your

425
00:25:07.621 --> 00:25:10.500
fucking horse shit.
Oh my.
And then she had,

426
00:25:10.501 --> 00:25:12.810
she had two plants in the crowd

427
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.040
to clear fucking plant.

428
00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:19.970
She calls some fucking young gay kid on the crowd and tells him it's okay.

429
00:25:19.971 --> 00:25:22.850
And the kid starts fucking cause like,
how did you get his number?

430
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.710
When did you get his number?
How did they have a miked up?

431
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:32.540
How can I hear this guy clear as fucking day talking into a fucking cell phone

432
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.050
that's going through the roof of the staple center to outer space,

433
00:25:36.051 --> 00:25:40.370
back down to the fucking through the roof again to lady Gaga who's got drapes

434
00:25:40.371 --> 00:25:45.110
around her fucking head,
right?
Crowds eat it up like,

435
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.560
oh my God,
she's a sate look at her reaching out.
Right?

436
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:53.360
And then the worst part was she sitting there dancing around and she's only a

437
00:25:53.361 --> 00:25:56.840
little bit better dancer than I am and I'm fucking horrific.
So she's up there.

438
00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.470
Um,
and then she goes,

439
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:04.220
where's that guy with the green hair and the crowd get up on the stage,
you know,

440
00:26:04.221 --> 00:26:06.460
cause she's so down to earth and the dude,

441
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:10.790
the green hair dude gets up on the fucking stage,
shirtless shredded.
Right?

442
00:26:10.791 --> 00:26:12.140
So right there,
you know it's a plant,

443
00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.630
although there were a lot of gay guys there and gay guys are always fucking

444
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.270
shredded,
so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt on that.

445
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:20.990
So the shirtless fucking shredded dude with the green hair gets on,

446
00:26:20.991 --> 00:26:24.140
runs up the runway,
doing his best to act like he's shocked,

447
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:30.290
and then they go into this fucking dance routine in this dude knows every

448
00:26:30.291 --> 00:26:35.120
fucking move right down to when to leave with the other dancers and walk into

449
00:26:35.121 --> 00:26:37.430
the castle.
It's like,
why is he going into the castle?

450
00:26:37.431 --> 00:26:40.400
I thought he wasn't just some random guy you pulled out of the fucking crowd.

451
00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:42.640
Should he go back to his God damn seat?

452
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:47.930
How much of a grumpy cunt to my that I'm really ripping the shit up for.

453
00:26:47.931 --> 00:26:52.880
It was fucking I,
I gotta tell you.
I was really,
I was really disappointed.

454
00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:57.410
I felt like I put myself in them in the head space where I could enjoy this.

455
00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:02.030
I was already seven beers in,
I grabbed a little bit of Mcdonald's on the way in,

456
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.270
had a quarter pounder with cheese and some French fries.
I'm like,
all right,

457
00:27:05.271 --> 00:27:08.420
let's see.
Uh,
let's see this fucking,
let's see this.

458
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:13.630
I know she can sing so it should be halfway decent and it was just was Ah,

459
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.980
and in the songs and then just sitting there with fucking every time drapes

460
00:27:18.981 --> 00:27:23.000
around her face.
It's like when are you just going to accept your nose?
We get it,

461
00:27:23.001 --> 00:27:25.970
you know like your nose but you're afraid to get a nose job cause you think it's

462
00:27:25.971 --> 00:27:29.090
going to change the sound of your voice just for when do you get you sitting

463
00:27:29.091 --> 00:27:33.140
there telling all these young gay kids,
it's okay that they're different in air.

464
00:27:33.141 --> 00:27:33.351
It is.

465
00:27:33.351 --> 00:27:36.620
You can't even accept your face walking around like that chick from the ring,

466
00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:39.530
your hair all in your God damn face.

467
00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:47.830
Fucking awful
it finish it every song and then she just sit there.

468
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.550
I'll wrapped and drapes in the being,

469
00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.530
breathing into the mic,
which was super fucking annoying.
And then she was like,

470
00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:59.070
I hope you guys are having a good time today

471
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.240
cause if you're not,
I don't give a fuck.

472
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:11.220
I said I don't give up.
Whole crowd goes nuts.

473
00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.300
And then she proceeds to give a fucking speech about how much she doesn't give a

474
00:28:15.301 --> 00:28:18.930
fuck.
Goes over to another shredded gay guy,

475
00:28:18.931 --> 00:28:23.730
fucking backup dancer.
You know,
hey fucking soliloquy.
Do you,
do you give a fuck?

476
00:28:23.731 --> 00:28:26.610
He's like,
I don't give a fuck.
Hey either.
Either.

477
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:36.070
I think that's when I heckled and I got my first dirty look from the air because

478
00:28:36.071 --> 00:28:38.230
it's literally like,
you know,
if you don't give a fuck,

479
00:28:38.231 --> 00:28:43.180
get on with the not giving a fuck,
why would you stop and give a speech?
You know,

480
00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:48.210
that's something I've learned in life is if you don't give a fuck,
you just,
you,

481
00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:53.170
you,
you don't say you don't give a fuck.
If you don't give a fuck other people,

482
00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:57.850
they recognize it and they say it for you.
Hey Dude,
you know,
you know that kid,

483
00:28:57.851 --> 00:29:01.450
uh,
you know,
like Kid Mike.
Yeah,
I do that kid that he doesn't give a fuck.

484
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:04.360
Seriously,
that cute.
And then you tell the fucking story.

485
00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:06.730
But Mike isn't walking around gone,
you know,

486
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:09.370
telling everybody that he doesn't give a fuck.

487
00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:15.100
She clearly gives a fuck.
She gives a fuck how she looks.

488
00:29:15.101 --> 00:29:16.570
I don't think she likes the way she looks.

489
00:29:16.571 --> 00:29:20.500
And I think that that's why she fucking walking around with an Afghan or
fucking,

490
00:29:20.501 --> 00:29:24.880
I don't know what you call it,
upholstery,
Oliver fucking face.

491
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.890
I Dunno.
Whatever will should,
I just enjoyed the,
the,
the,
the,
the,

492
00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:32.310
I don't know if they're the fucking,

493
00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:38.010
I dunno what I was really,
I mean,
as dumb as this sounds,

494
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.920
I went there with some sort of expectations and I just,
you know,

495
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.870
I thought the drummer was the best part of the fucking show and he was,

496
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.020
he was in a castle and I couldn't fucking see him.
Granted his,

497
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:52.080
his drum strix we're lit up so I could seek some of this shit that he was doing.

498
00:29:52.451 --> 00:29:53.284
But uh,

499
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.000
<v 4>okay.</v>

500
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.150
<v 1>I Dunno.
And then there was some sort of,
there was some sort of story going on.</v>

501
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.660
I felt like they were like workshopping a musical and they didn't really have

502
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:05.500
the full story.
They just kept being this face that would blow up.

503
00:30:05.501 --> 00:30:08.590
And it was lady Gaga is,
and she would just be speaking monotone,

504
00:30:08.591 --> 00:30:10.000
like she was some sort of Zombie,

505
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.450
which I guess was supposed to give it some sort of depth.

506
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:18.510
Can you guys believe that if somebody's 44 going to be 45 is wasting this much

507
00:30:19.091 --> 00:30:24.040
time talking about how I was disappointed at a lady Gaga concert as if that

508
00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:29.041
fucking show in any shape or form was designed to appeal to some fucking

509
00:30:29.291 --> 00:30:33.040
redheaded cont like make,
you know,
whatever.

510
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:37.030
I had to get that out because there's a chance in the end might be coming down

511
00:30:37.031 --> 00:30:39.820
to the podcast and I did a real good job.

512
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:41.140
<v 4>Okay.</v>

513
00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.770
<v 1>Not taking the piss out of that show when I was there and not ruining it for,</v>

514
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.170
but,
uh,
anyways,

515
00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.710
<v 2>fucking,
it was really bad.</v>

516
00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:53.483
<v 4>Okay.</v>

517
00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:56.660
<v 2>You know what I mean?
Even Madonna concerts back in the fucking day.
Oh,</v>

518
00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:00.630
that was another thing that she fucking said she was going like,
you know,

519
00:31:00.631 --> 00:31:02.220
when I started out,
uh,

520
00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:05.060
<v 1>dramatic</v>

521
00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:09.860
<v 2>pause,
people didn't think that I could bring the underground gay scene to the</v>

522
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:14.630
mainstream.
You know,
it's like,
why are you ignoring Madonna?

523
00:31:14.631 --> 00:31:16.730
Didn't Madonna do that like 20 years ago?

524
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:18.470
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

525
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:21.140
<v 2>Then the village people kind of start it.
You always funny about</v>

526
00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:22.603
<v 4>like</v>

527
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.520
<v 2>it was so it was,
that shit was so fucking underground in the 70s,</v>

528
00:31:26.521 --> 00:31:31.521
right into the 80s that morons like me didn't know that like half the people you

529
00:31:32.111 --> 00:31:35.040
were listening to what gay you had?
No,

530
00:31:35.041 --> 00:31:38.610
even though like you'd be listening to a band called Queen and the guy's

531
00:31:38.611 --> 00:31:39.860
prancing around.
Okay.

532
00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:41.240
<v 4>Okay.</v>

533
00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.720
<v 2>In is in fucking why don't know what the diapers,
adult diapers,</v>

534
00:31:44.721 --> 00:31:46.670
I don't know what he was doing walking around barefoot.

535
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:49.370
You still like the music was you,
didn't you

536
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:53.760
<v 1>still in?
No,
I watched the other day I was watching this Judas Priest concert,</v>

537
00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:58.920
uh,
I forget where the fuck they were.
It was like in the early eighties.

538
00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.450
<v 4>Okay.</v>

539
00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:05.250
<v 1>And Rob Halford is coming out like in like literally fucking</v>

540
00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:07.400
<v 4>yeah,</v>

541
00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.580
<v 1>like essence,
this SNM outfit</v>

542
00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:15.570
and he had no fucking idea.
Um,

543
00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.820
I know there's like 20 guys like that.

544
00:32:17.821 --> 00:32:20.880
It was still an but like that Madonna's shit when she knew that all add Vogan

545
00:32:20.881 --> 00:32:24.690
crap.
That was like 20,
almost 25 years at this point.
So I don't know.

546
00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:25.970
<v 2>I think that's just what it is.</v>

547
00:32:25.971 --> 00:32:30.830
I think I'm just an old fucking guy and I imagine when I was watching whatever

548
00:32:30.831 --> 00:32:31.940
the fuck I was watching,

549
00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.960
they were all going to Zeplin did this like 15 years ago as I'm sitting there

550
00:32:35.961 --> 00:32:38.210
freaking out watching a band called Cinderella.

551
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:45.170
I think that was the point of it.
No offense to lady Gaga fans.

552
00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:48.890
I think I just realized how fucking old day was all right and I just watched my

553
00:32:48.891 --> 00:32:52.580
team loose.
Okay.
stamps.com everybody,
uh,
intro,

554
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.260
not supposed to read intro part.
Um,
if you haven't heard yet,

555
00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:01.500
postage rates are changing again.
You know what that means.

556
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.250
The post office will be even more crowded than usual.
Yeah.

557
00:33:04.251 --> 00:33:07.820
Cause a bunch of old people running down there to get this stamps because the

558
00:33:07.821 --> 00:33:09.980
bankers stole their 401k.
Okay.

559
00:33:09.981 --> 00:33:13.640
That's the real story behind this advertising on stamps.com.

560
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:18.050
That's why I use stamps.com to send out all my DVDs each and every week.

561
00:33:18.051 --> 00:33:20.720
By the way,
the hardcopy of you people have all the same.

562
00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.560
Is going to be coming out soon and I will be selling that at the end of all my

563
00:33:24.561 --> 00:33:26.720
live shows and eventually on my website.

564
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.200
And how will I get those DVDs to my shows?

565
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:34.430
We'll I'll be using stamps.com dog dog gone it.
Um,
why?

566
00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:38.510
Because I can buy and print official US postage right from my drat desk using my

567
00:33:38.511 --> 00:33:42.350
own computer and printer stamps.com always updates the postage rates for you

568
00:33:42.351 --> 00:33:45.320
automatically.
And unlike those postage meters companies,

569
00:33:45.321 --> 00:33:47.900
stamps.com never charges a fee to do it.

570
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:52.070
So a stamps.com you will always get the exact post did you need for any letter

571
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.990
or package the instant you need it,

572
00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:57.380
you'll never even have to go to the post office again.
Um,

573
00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:00.740
I got to tell you it's a dream.
It's a dream to not have to do that.

574
00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:05.150
I've been using stamps.com for the last,

575
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:06.440

578

579
00:34:15.101 --> 00:34:18.500

Sad news this week
on the podcast,
uh,

587
00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:49.470
the great Earl weaver or a weaver,
right?

588
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.353
<v 5>Ooh,</v>

589
00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:56.780
<v 2>he,
I'm sorry.
He passed away a this week and uh,</v>

590
00:34:56.870 --> 00:35:01.840
he was one of my favorites.
He's a throwback coach.
Uh,

591
00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.200
we got a great clip of him.

592
00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.413
<v 4>MMM.</v>

593
00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.750
<v 2>He,
he's,
there's two great clips of him.</v>

594
00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:14.130
I got to find the other one was he hit the first one is when he comes out and

595
00:35:14.131 --> 00:35:18.140
he's arguing,
I believe it's a buck and he's yelling at the umpire.
It

596
00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:22.250
<v 5>goes,
you know what,
you are out here for what God damn reason.</v>

597
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:26.870
And the umpire is hilarious.
He goes,
why is that Earl?
And he goes to fuck us.

598
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:30.680
He's like,
ah,
that's a budget.
That's true.

599
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.740
You came out here to fuck us.

600
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:38.160
<v 2>And you know what's great is the umpire is just so sicker.
Earl</v>

601
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.900
<v 1>weaver.
He's like,
ah yeah cause Earl weaver like threatened some of the guys.
Ah,</v>

602
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:45.180
Earl,
you're not going to knock anybody on your ass.
He goes,

603
00:35:45.181 --> 00:35:47.880
what are you going to do fuck up another world series?

604
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.570
I think he was making reference to the fact they were up three games to one

605
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.420
against the pirates.
I was too young.

606
00:35:57.421 --> 00:36:01.650
I don't know if Earl made some bad calls with the um,
you know,

607
00:36:01.651 --> 00:36:04.410
the pitchers he put it in or whatever.
I think it was more the pirates.

608
00:36:04.411 --> 00:36:07.500
It was just a destiny to win that year.
But uh,

609
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:11.820
the empire literally says to do what Earl fuck up another world series.

610
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:16.350
And he said,
it was in Earl goes,
I've won more than I've lost.

611
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:20.250
And the umpire is like,
no you haven't.
No you haven't.
An Earl goes,

612
00:36:20.251 --> 00:36:24.270
I'm talking about games.
Fucking hilarious.

613
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.000
See on Paris basically calling him out,

614
00:36:27.001 --> 00:36:31.230
go and you lost more world series that you managed and then you won an Earl goes

615
00:36:31.231 --> 00:36:34.050
with the technicality.
Yeah,
but I won more world series games.

616
00:36:34.051 --> 00:36:38.790
It's fucking hilarious.
Um,
the,
you know,

617
00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:40.140
I really hope,

618
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:43.920
I just don't think that there's going to be another guy like him this day and

619
00:36:43.921 --> 00:36:48.810
age would like to actually get audio back then was so rare where nowadays I just

620
00:36:48.811 --> 00:36:49.644
feel like,

621
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:51.543
<v 0>mmm.</v>

622
00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.860
<v 1>I Dunno.
They just don't go off the way they used to.</v>

623
00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:56.140
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

624
00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:58.810
<v 1>They would just some great ones.
And he was,
he was the best of the best,</v>

625
00:36:58.811 --> 00:37:03.811
I would say Earl weaver as far as yelling at an umpire might've been the Jordan.

626
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.290
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

627
00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:09.480
<v 1>Or,
or the Bobby Knight.
I would say
I,</v>

628
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:14.380
Bobby Knight always came off like a baby to me.
You know,
like throwing chairs,

629
00:37:14.381 --> 00:37:16.600
like a little kid throwing his toys and stuff.

630
00:37:16.601 --> 00:37:19.900
He always came off like a baby to me and a phony tough guy.

631
00:37:19.901 --> 00:37:24.050
Earl weaver or waiver to me just kinda came off like a,

632
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.480
just like a B was just like a fucking badger,

633
00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:28.873
<v 0>you know,</v>

634
00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:32.190
<v 1>a little wolverine or something like that.
I don't know.</v>

635
00:37:32.191 --> 00:37:34.440
There was just something fucking home cause he was just a little guy.

636
00:37:34.441 --> 00:37:39.441
The greatest thing about this clip is I think he walks away like four times and

637
00:37:39.661 --> 00:37:43.530
every time he stops and walks back,
the crowd goes even crazier.

638
00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.260
And it was almost like watching Hulk Hogan,

639
00:37:46.261 --> 00:37:50.920
like milking a crowd right before he rips his shirt off.
It's just,
I dunno Eddie,

640
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:54.630
it's another thing that makes me feel old.
I'm the late,

641
00:37:54.631 --> 00:37:58.950
great Earl weaver passes away.
So anyways,
hey,

642
00:37:58.951 --> 00:38:00.810
let's check in on the Bruins and see how they're doing here.

643
00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:02.763
<v 0>MMM.</v>

644
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:07.890
<v 1>By the way,
this is free advertising.
It's still one to one in the second period.</v>

645
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.610
I love this,
by the way,
when you can fucking,
uh,
you can watch the game.

646
00:38:11.611 --> 00:38:13.710
So you get the package on the computer.
Cause I'm on the,

647
00:38:13.711 --> 00:38:15.390
I got a big tour coming up.
Everybody.

648
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:20.840
I'm really excited about this and I'm a play in all these unbelievable venues.

649
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:26.730
And,
uh,
I dunno,
I get amped up for this.
Like,
fuck.
Like if I was playing sports,

650
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.290
you know,
gold went to all these places and just wanting to make sure,
you know,

651
00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:35.070
you give people their money's worth.

656
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:53.590

657
00:38:53.591 --> 00:38:57.790
but I'm doing two benefits next week on the Patrice O'Neal.
One is sold out.

658
00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.040
There is a chance that some tickets at the last,

659
00:39:00.041 --> 00:39:02.360
second might be made available depending on,
uh,

660
00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:06.330
we gotta make sure all family and friends get their tickets.
Um,

661
00:39:06.331 --> 00:39:09.070
we set aside some,
so,
uh,
there might be some extra ones.

662
00:39:09.071 --> 00:39:13.420
I'll give you guys a heads up on Twitter.
Um,

663
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:19.210
but on Monday the 18th,
I'm doing a benefit for a good friend of mine,

664
00:39:19.211 --> 00:39:24.160

666

667
00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:33.160
<v 2>I know tickets are on sale for that one.
I think that one.
What am I sold out too?</v>

668
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:35.320
But,
uh,
just in case there are some tickets.

669
00:39:35.321 --> 00:39:39.210
Both of those are wonderful causes obviously.
And then I get to go home.

She'll be another good time here.
All right.

694
00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.360
A response to kid wanting to move to Florida.
Hey Bill,

695
00:41:10.361 --> 00:41:11.650
listening to this week's pod.
Oh,

696
00:41:11.651 --> 00:41:14.680
this was from last week with a 24 year old kid who was about ready to get

697
00:41:14.681 --> 00:41:17.500
married,
was sick in New York and wanting to move down to Florida.

698
00:41:17.501 --> 00:41:20.140
And I was giving him some advice and he was young.
It was a good time to do it,

699
00:41:20.141 --> 00:41:24.260
but,
uh,
just know that you are moving a world away from um,

700
00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:26.650
Jersey and New York.
So anyways,
he says,
listen,

701
00:41:26.651 --> 00:41:28.930
to let this guy says listening to this week's podcast.

702
00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:32.620
And just want to throw my 2 cents about,
ah,

703
00:41:32.621 --> 00:41:36.470
this kid wanting to move to Florida as I was in the exact same situation as this

704
00:41:36.471 --> 00:41:39.140
guy.
I think you gave some great advice.
Thank you.

705
00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.470
Making a big change and moving away from family,
friends,

706
00:41:42.471 --> 00:41:46.760
et Cetera is a big change and it takes a while to get that same set of going

707
00:41:46.761 --> 00:41:47.780
into your new place.

708
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:51.830
The only additional advice that I could give to this guy is to travel checkout

709
00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:55.790
places and see what he and his girlfriend light try Chicago,
Portland,
La,

710
00:41:55.791 --> 00:41:59.080
San Diego,
Austin,
et Cetera.
What was it?

711
00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:01.190
Some great cities you just picked their by the way,
uh,

712
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:05.270
each have their own vibe and attitude in job markets.
You were spot on.

713
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:10.670
Uh,
with the New York northeast attitude.
I think he's talking to me now.
It's,

714
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:14.620
it's foot on the floor.
Get out of the way.
I found it to be too conference,

715
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:19.990
too confrontational and self centered I guess when he lived other places and

716
00:42:20.001 --> 00:42:22.340
this guy seems to have a similar outfit.
Look,

717
00:42:22.341 --> 00:42:25.880
unfortunately I think his girlfriend is right.
New York isn't going to change.

718
00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:29.840
He's just going to become more bitter and if they get a house,
mortgage,
kids,

719
00:42:29.841 --> 00:42:33.060
et Cetera,
I'd probably only gets worse than he feels like he's tied down to the,

720
00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.540
the place he's in.
Like you said,

721
00:42:35.541 --> 00:42:37.880
he's young enough trying to make a move and if it doesn't work,

722
00:42:37.881 --> 00:42:42.110
he could move back.
I just say you should do some traveling and scout first.

723
00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:43.161
At a minimum.

724
00:42:43.161 --> 00:42:45.410
It gives them a break from the New York attitude and lets you clear your head

725
00:42:45.411 --> 00:42:46.280
and get a perspective.

726
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:50.690
A best case he finds somewhere that seems like a fit for his and his

727
00:42:50.691 --> 00:42:53.270
girlfriend's personalities.
Yeah,
that's a huge fucking thing.

728
00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:54.861
You know what I mean?

729
00:42:54.861 --> 00:42:57.950
You definitely want to travel around and try some shit out because if you just

730
00:42:57.951 --> 00:43:01.110
go to one place,
God forbid you don't like it,
but your girl or your,

731
00:43:01.111 --> 00:43:05.420
your boyfriend loves it and then you stuck there.
Uh,
I know somebody like that.

732
00:43:05.421 --> 00:43:10.190
They moved to Tampa and the dude loves it and his wife is fucking miserable.

733
00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:12.590
You see it on her face.
Every time I see her,
hey,

734
00:43:12.591 --> 00:43:15.950
it's still kinda not liking it and she's just,
you know,

735
00:43:15.951 --> 00:43:17.320
you're warming up to it a little bit.

736
00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:20.690
She's just fucking shakes her head slowly and you know,

737
00:43:20.691 --> 00:43:23.780
the guy's an idiot and he's like,
oh,
I don't know what a problem is.
I love it.

738
00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:28.430
You know,
it's like,
I dunno how he does that.

739
00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.840
I couldn't have,
Neil was miserable living somewhere.
You know,
once,

740
00:43:32.841 --> 00:43:36.170
if you're fucking,
your girl is miserable.
That's it,
man.

741
00:43:36.171 --> 00:43:37.310
You gotta get the fuck out of there.

742
00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:41.390
She's going to bring that misery down on you.
All right.
Men are studs.

743
00:43:41.391 --> 00:43:45.620
Women are whores.
Um,
had that conversation last week with the lovely Nia.

744
00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:47.541
She says,
Bill,

745
00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:52.190
my wife and I went to a marriage retreat one summer and the guest speaker said a

746
00:43:52.191 --> 00:43:54.950
quote that stuck with me.
The quote was,

747
00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:58.550
a key that can open many locks is called a master key.

748
00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:03.080
A lot that can be opened with many key is considered useless.

749
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:07.850
Just a bit of ammunition.
The next time you get into a heated argument,
stay safe.

750
00:44:07.851 --> 00:44:08.750
Go Fuck Yourself.

751
00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:10.770
<v 0>MMM.</v>

752
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.460
<v 2>I would love to say that.
I get it.
I get that quote,
but I don't get it.</v>

753
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:18.520
As it pertains to men are studs women or horse

754
00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:24.830
because uh,
I know what I was saying that the reason why if a guy goes out,

755
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:26.660
bags,
a bunch of women,
he's a stud,

756
00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:31.720
he's a stud because that's a skill he has to talk all those women into bed.

757
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.200
<v 1>He's got a warm,
he's got to seduce him.</v>

758
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:35.563
<v 3>You know,</v>

759
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:38.750
<v 1>he's got to spin them around.
The dance floor has got to tell some jokes.</v>

760
00:44:38.751 --> 00:44:41.810
He's got to spend the plates.
Women can just show up and be like,

761
00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:47.780
you know,
and they can have a fucking 10 on one if they want to.

762
00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.080
You know what I mean?
That's what I was saying.
So we says a key,

763
00:44:53.081 --> 00:44:55.750
they can open many locks is considered a master key.

764
00:44:55.751 --> 00:44:58.840
So I guess that that's the guy being able to talk all the broads and bed.

765
00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:02.980
A lock that can be opened with many keys is considered useless.

766
00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.150
That's where it goes off the rails for me

767
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.950
and fuck all you guys who are laughing at me.
I don't get it

768
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:16.740
because I dunno if you kind of look at guys,
we,
for the most part,

769
00:45:16.741 --> 00:45:21.450
we will fuck anything that moves so we can also be considered useless led around

770
00:45:21.451 --> 00:45:22.290
by our dicks.

771
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:24.043
<v 3>You know?</v>

772
00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:27.380
<v 1>I really wish if I could go back and be young again</v>

773
00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:31.440
and go back to that lady Gaga concert,
sorry.

774
00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:32.763
<v 3>MMM.</v>

775
00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:39.080
<v 1>Oh,
there's another dumb fucking thing.
She said,
Dan annoyed me.</v>

776
00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:44.000
If you want to do subdued and people say you can't do it,

777
00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:48.130
long pause.
You just roll the fuck over.

778
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:52.310
I right.
Never.
He goes fucking nuts.
And that,
that statement really bugged me.

779
00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:57.140
It's like,
you know,
you're really speaking to like 20,000 people at this point.

780
00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:59.080
Lady Gaga,
I know.
She think he gives,

781
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:00.920
shouldn't be painting with such a broad brush.

782
00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:04.300
Don't you think he should maybe realize what the fuck some people are thinking?

783
00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:05.780
What if you have a pedophile in the crowd?

784
00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:09.910
You thinking of doing something and people say you shouldn't do it.

785
00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:14.320
You Rama fuck over.
You know what?
I'm saying,
what are you going to a pyromaniac,

786
00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.150
you know,
just get some,

787
00:46:17.151 --> 00:46:20.980
he's got green hair and abs doesn't automatically mean they have the best of

788
00:46:20.981 --> 00:46:21.814
intentions.

789
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:28.020
So why don't you fucking take you a sweaty face out from underneath all that

790
00:46:28.021 --> 00:46:30.900
carpet she got wrapped around them and think about what you're talking about.

791
00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:33.930
It's my computer going to crash you running out of fucking

792
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:40.660
running out of juice here.
Uh,
let's read the last advertising just in case.

793
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:45.430
Uh,
he voice,
oh,
I like this.
This is awesome.

794
00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:50.220
He voice he voiced is what professionals use to save time and work smarter.

795
00:46:50.221 --> 00:46:53.560
He voice converts all your voicemails to texts and sends it directly to your

796
00:46:53.561 --> 00:46:56.800
cell phone right there,
right there alone.
It's worth,

797
00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.900
it's worth the price of admission.
Uh,

798
00:46:58.901 --> 00:47:02.380
no interrupting your day to check your voicemail or waiting till after meeting

Let me read this one before.

824
00:48:26.381 --> 00:48:27.670
The whole thing crashes here.

825
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:31.150
Maybe cause I'm watching the Bruins game at the same time as that's what's

826
00:48:31.151 --> 00:48:32.380
sucking away all the energy.

827
00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:39.490
Still one to one after two
Marshawn during the interview.

828
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.840
Hope and he comes on.
This year is a little off.
Last year.
Is it me?

829
00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:45.610
What does it mean?
He had a kind of an off year,

830
00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.420
a relationship advice for a lady.

831
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:54.490
Um,
oh wait,
I skipped one.
Now let's do the lady one herring.
Fucking trash.

832
00:48:54.491 --> 00:48:57.910
And Lady Gaga.
Let's,
let's try to help out one of the broads there.
Um,

833
00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:01.870
I'm emailing you tonight with the hopes of,
of saving my relationship.
Yes,

834
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.040
that's right.
Bill Burr.

835
00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:07.780
You just might be the savior to the only thing that truly matters to me.
Oh,
okay.

836
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:11.420
Great.
No pressure here.
Um,

837
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:15.700
please,
if you do so if you care about before.
Okay.

838
00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:20.050
I met my boyfriend and a Blah in 2010.
Yes,

839
00:49:20.051 --> 00:49:24.490
a shitty college bar in shipment iceberg,
Pennsylvania.

840
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.180
If you were to ask any former or current student from ship,

841
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:29.770
what's the best bar in ship?

842
00:49:29.771 --> 00:49:34.771
They tell you this place and rave abar it as if it was the fucking Taj Mahal

843
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:35.620
Mahal.
Uh,

844
00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:38.800
the fact that our story began in this place might be an indication that there is

845
00:49:38.801 --> 00:49:40.780
something seriously bizarre about our relationship.

846
00:49:40.781 --> 00:49:43.930
But I assure you are pretty normal people now meeting to meeting somebody when

847
00:49:43.931 --> 00:49:48.490
you're college age.
If you're in a college bar and you can this still,

848
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:51.070
you still drafted in the first round,
you know what I mean?

849
00:49:51.071 --> 00:49:55.230
Everybody's 2122 you meet some broadened a bar at fucking,
you know,

850
00:49:55.540 --> 00:50:00.010
28 29 you know,
that's where you know,
you're trying to find that,
you know,

851
00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:05.010
I dunno that diamond in the rough and the fucking six round.

852
00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:08.520
That's like the fourth round by then once you get in the 30s that's just like,

853
00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:13.420
you know,
supplemental draft.
Anyways,
in the past two and a half years I,
I've met,

854
00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.810
I have known and have been with him.

855
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:18.880
He has been an avid fan of yours.

856
00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:23.500
I took him to a show of yours at the tower theater and Upper Darby and we hope

857
00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:27.440
we hopped in the front of the line for the meet and greet where he proceeded to.

858
00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:31.870
Thank you for having him as if you've personally invited him.
I have.

859
00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.370
I have yet to let his star struck moment go.

860
00:50:34.371 --> 00:50:36.830
It's something we still laugh at all the time.
All that's great.

861
00:50:36.831 --> 00:50:40.730
You break his balls.
Good.
You're a hot shit.
Um,

862
00:50:40.731 --> 00:50:45.731
he's the writer of the whore fiance email that you write an email of what Jesus

863
00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:49.460
Christ.
Enough with the fucking detail.
Here we go.

864
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:52.940
I am hoping that you help me with this.
I'm so incredibly in love with this man.

865
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:56.180
We are currently,
we currently live together,
but our lease is almost up.

866
00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:00.170
We both been battling some issues lately and my pathetic bout of depression is

867
00:51:00.171 --> 00:51:04.280
killing the relationship already planned on working on things I know I need to,

868
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:08.720
but what else can I do to show him that I really will do anything for him?

869
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:11.270
I know actions speak louder than words,

870
00:51:11.271 --> 00:51:15.170
but I can not prove a complete turnaround overnight.
Especially,

871
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:19.490
especially since he has already been moving his things out.
Oh,

872
00:51:19.491 --> 00:51:22.840
he's already moving out.
Jesus Christ.

873
00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:25.130
You got me here at the point where it's,
you know,

874
00:51:25.131 --> 00:51:27.350
clip the fucking red wire or the green wire.

875
00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.650
I'll honestly do whatever it takes to save our relationship.

876
00:51:30.651 --> 00:51:31.790
He means the world to me.

877
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:36.020
What can I do to show him that if he just gives me a chance,

878
00:51:36.021 --> 00:51:39.230
I will fix this and do whatever it takes to be there for them.
Uh,

879
00:51:39.231 --> 00:51:42.770
this is an absolute act of desperation.
Bill.
I'm at my wit's end.

880
00:51:42.771 --> 00:51:45.860
I'd appreciate your advice.
Well,
I would tell him what you just told me,

881
00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:49.310
that you're willing to do that and you might have to let him

882
00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:52.180
<v 6>move out.
Um,</v>

883
00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:56.640
<v 1>listen,
if you're at a level of depression that it's affecting your relationship</v>

884
00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:02.760
with someone that you,
you seem to,
you're saying you absolutely love to death,

885
00:52:02.761 --> 00:52:04.680
then you really do need to work on yourself.

886
00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:10.820
And unfortunately you might have to let this guy go while you get your shit

887
00:52:11.071 --> 00:52:13.440
together.
You know what I mean?

888
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:16.580
<v 6>Um,
but</v>

889
00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.500
<v 1>it doesn't mean you just let the guy go without telling them how you feel.</v>

890
00:52:19.501 --> 00:52:22.290
I would tell him what you told me and then just say that you go,

891
00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.890
you are going to work on yourself.
You'd appreciate it that he would,

892
00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:28.050
if he would stay with you during this process,

893
00:52:28.051 --> 00:52:29.700
but I don't know how long he's been dealing with that.

894
00:52:29.701 --> 00:52:31.920
It seems that the guys already moving out that he's,

895
00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:35.340
he needs a break from it and that could be a good thing.

896
00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:39.170
<v 6>But,
uh,
I dunno.
I Dunno.</v>

897
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:42.220
<v 1>Fucking depressed.
You are clinical.</v>

898
00:52:42.221 --> 00:52:43.690
I don't know what the F I can't deal with that,

899
00:52:43.691 --> 00:52:47.020
but a few do you feel like me and you suffer from bouts of depression.

900
00:52:47.021 --> 00:52:50.140
You have to figure out how your mind works so you can feel yourself going into

901
00:52:50.141 --> 00:52:54.750
one.
You can talk yourself out of it.
But uh,
yeah,

902
00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:59.560
it was that awful.
I mean,
like I said,

903
00:52:59.561 --> 00:53:01.060
it's not like it's the beginning of this,
this,

904
00:53:01.061 --> 00:53:04.540
this dude is literally taken his fucking posters down off the wall.

905
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:06.463
<v 6>Uh,
you know,</v>

906
00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:08.850
<v 1>as you're giving this speech,</v>

907
00:53:08.851 --> 00:53:11.630
there's going to be an echo in your apartment because he's more ads just

908
00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:16.230
pressing,
sorry,
I'm gonna fucking steer right into it.
Listen,

909
00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:21.000
just tell the fucking guy how you feel and tell him you going to work on

910
00:53:21.001 --> 00:53:23.580
yourself and don't,
don't have that.
Just be lip service.

911
00:53:23.581 --> 00:53:28.230
Actually go out and do it.
Go to therapy.
Figure yourself out.

912
00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:32.190
Okay.
And you might have to fucking lose this guy and you might have to fuck this

913
00:53:32.191 --> 00:53:33.650
thing up and it'll,

914
00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:37.800
it's part of the journey that for some fucking reason,
yeah,

915
00:53:37.801 --> 00:53:41.520
this is the hand you've been dealt and hopefully you come out the other side,

916
00:53:41.521 --> 00:53:44.000
but you're not going to if you don't work on yourself.
Um,

917
00:53:45.310 --> 00:53:47.410
<v 6>and that's it.
All right.</v>

918
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:52.660
<v 2>I hope everything works out for you.
God bless you.
There we go.</v>

919
00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:54.830
And with that,
I think I'm out of shit to read this week.

920
00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:57.203
<v 6>MMM.</v>

921
00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.100
<v 2>All right.
How can I,
how can I wrap this fucking thing off?</v>

922
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.033
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

923
00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:04.060
<v 2>Sat there,
Piss,
Moan and complain.
And really,
Bill,</v>

924
00:54:04.061 --> 00:54:06.760
you went to a lady Gaga concert and you didn't fucking enjoy it.

925
00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.073
<v 6>MMM.</v>

926
00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:13.130
<v 2>Let's do this.
My new favorite thing to do.
Check in what science?</v>

927
00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:15.020
The next dumb thing scientists are doing.

928
00:54:15.021 --> 00:54:18.980
These fucking egg heads are doing all right.
This is the latest thing.
Russia,

929
00:54:18.981 --> 00:54:22.790
the United States and Great Britain are facing off.
Isn't that great?

930
00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.640
Why would they ever work together?

931
00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:27.880
<v 6>Oh,
okay.</v>

932
00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.170
<v 2>That's another thing about that Lance Armstrong Shit.</v>

933
00:54:30.171 --> 00:54:34.130
I hate when people like that.
Rick Riley will you like,
oh,
why do I tell my kids?

934
00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:36.680
It's like,
why don't you tell him the fucking truth?

935
00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.440
Why don't you tell them what you saw?

936
00:54:42.050 --> 00:54:47.050
That there's a certain level of of power and fame and wealth that you get to

937
00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:52.910
the level of temptation at that the level of fucking pussy that you can get at

938
00:54:52.911 --> 00:54:56.840
that level will cause you to shoot fucking horse tranquilizers into your ass so

939
00:54:56.841 --> 00:54:58.300
you can win on a fucking bicycle.

940
00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:01.820
<v 6>You know?
Why don't you just tell him that?</v>

941
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:07.530
<v 1>Start with that and go right into the fact that there's no Santa Claus.</v>

942
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:09.090
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

943
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:10.460
<v 1>just what?
Why did,
why do,</v>

944
00:55:10.461 --> 00:55:13.460
I guess because you love your kids and you want to keep him innocent and that

945
00:55:13.461 --> 00:55:16.490
type of thing and you want to shelter them from that,

946
00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:18.560
which I totally respect.

947
00:55:18.561 --> 00:55:23.480
But in the end when it finally comes out and they're seeing it,
you,
you gotta,

948
00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:28.640
you gotta give them a dose of reality.
And I don't think parents do that,

949
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:31.280
which is why you have guys like Rick Riley who,

950
00:55:31.281 --> 00:55:35.420
who's still walking around like a little kid hurt.

951
00:55:35.421 --> 00:55:37.670
Like he just found out there's no Santa Claus.
It's like,

952
00:55:37.671 --> 00:55:40.730
how fucking long you've been rubbing elbows with athletes.

953
00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.570
I don't even by Rick Riley's fucking hurt.
I don't,
I don't buy it.

954
00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:50.360
The shit that those sports writers say,
you know,

955
00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:54.530
all this stuff that they've been around,
all the ego maniacs,
all that shit,

956
00:55:54.531 --> 00:55:58.770
all the horn around on the wives,
the corked bats,

957
00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:01.280
the fucking steroids,
all of that fucking shit.

958
00:56:01.281 --> 00:56:05.520
How many fucking guys have to fall before?
You're not surprised anymore.
I,

959
00:56:05.521 --> 00:56:06.980
I don't get it.
So anyways,

960
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.233
<v 6>plowing ahead here.</v>

961
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:10.531
<v 2>Russia,</v>

962
00:56:10.531 --> 00:56:13.950
the United States and Great Britain are facing off rather than working together.

963
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:18.420
And this cold war is set in the coldest place on earth.

964
00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:23.590
A trio of teams from three countries have spent years planning,

965
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:28.800
drilling and digging in a race to reach one handful of fresh water lakes buried

966
00:56:29.441 --> 00:56:34.000
up to a mile and a half beneath art.
Antarctica is trillion tons of ice.

967
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:37.870
Why are they doing it?
Same fucking reason.

968
00:56:37.871 --> 00:56:42.130
Lance took his drugs cause there's pussy at the end of that rainbow.

969
00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:46.670
<v 4>Uh,
there's money.</v>

970
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:52.120
<v 2>All right.
And whores love money and nobody fucks you better than a whore.</v>

971
00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:54.970
And these scientists,
they want to get some of that.

972
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.410
They want to get some of that fucking blue label that Johnnie Walker Blue Pussy

973
00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:03.340
before they,
they just,
they,
I dunno,

974
00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:06.790
they have an aneurism and fall face first into a fucking petri dish.

975
00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:10.310
Drown in a petri dish.
Anyways,

976
00:57:10.311 --> 00:57:15.210
the studies hopes to find new life forms in pitch dark,
freezing,
uh,

977
00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:17.810
pitch dark,
freezing water that I've never seen the sunlight.

978
00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:21.810
Well that's good.
That's good.

979
00:57:21.811 --> 00:57:24.330
So you're going to drill down there and maybe some sunlight in and maybe,

980
00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:25.960
maybe we can kill what lives down there.

981
00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:27.943
<v 4>Yeah.
Know,</v>

982
00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:32.250
<v 2>I just don't understand why.
How long isn't it?</v>

983
00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:35.240
Is Science going to fuck with nature of just

984
00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.113
<v 1>leave it alone,</v>

985
00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.800
<v 2>let the mosquitoes kill us.</v>

986
00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:43.030
This is why mosquitoes fly around the fucking a flyer on the world,

987
00:57:43.031 --> 00:57:46.090
but fucking are all around the world with diseases to kill us because if they

988
00:57:46.091 --> 00:57:48.040
don't,
this is the shit we're going to do.

989
00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:50.530
We're going to go to the bottom of the planet and explore,

990
00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:53.830
expose this pristine lake.
Can't you just leave it alone?

991
00:57:53.831 --> 00:57:58.670
You're fucking egg headed conch.
What is there to gain?

992
00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:01.950
Why do we need to know what's down there?

993
00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:05.053
<v 4>I Dunno.</v>

994
00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:08.590
<v 1>You know,
I don't get these sites.
It's like didn't,
didn't they see the thing?</v>

995
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:13.330
I hope there really is something down there that just completely wiped them out,

996
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:18.190
but yet it wouldn't work.
We'd just go down there.
We'd hunt it down,
you know,

997
00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:22.230
stick it in a circus and make it ride a bicycle with a muzzle on

998
00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:29.390
and then act surprised one day when it just fucking makes a left turn on the

999
00:58:29.391 --> 00:58:32.450
bike and just starts fucking doing that grizzly bear bitch.

1000
00:58:32.451 --> 00:58:35.280
Slap breaking people's fucking necks.

1001
00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:40.050
I root for animals when they attack people.
I really do.
You know,

1002
00:58:40.051 --> 00:58:44.340
unless it's,
it's somebody that's innocent,
you know,

1003
00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:49.050
by innocent,
I mean you're,
you're a a,
you're not an adult.

1004
00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:54.120
If you're a kid and you don't know any fucking better,
obviously,
you know,

1005
00:58:54.121 --> 00:58:57.690
or you're old and you wanted to get the fuck away from it,
but you're too slow.

1006
00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:01.140
Then I root for the human being.
But you know,

1007
00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:04.410
remember that girl who leaned up against the bear cage to take a picture and the

1008
00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:08.340
fucking bear was like trying to pull her into the cage and she couldn't fucking

1009
00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:13.250
move,
you know?
And she starts going gag gun.

1010
00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:19.100
<v 2>Aw,
the lovely Nia.
Everybody.
Hello?
Hello.</v>

1011
00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:22.370
So Nia was telling everybody about

1012
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:23.840
<v 5>a,
the lady Gaga concert.</v>

1013
00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:25.610
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1014
00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:27.320
<v 5>Yeah.
Did you,
did you enjoy it?</v>

1015
00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:34.440
<v 1>Hello?
Ah,
forget it.
Do you have that other microphone,
by the way?</v>

1016
00:59:34.441 --> 00:59:38.730
If you want to fucking come on this thing.
Oh,
that's all right.

1017
00:59:40.590 --> 00:59:43.400
Well,
I mean,
I'm almost at the end of the podcast anyways.
I'm,
I'm,

1018
00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:44.760
I'm like 59 minutes,

1019
00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:50.600
almost an hour into this fucker.
You want to come on?
Yeah.

1020
00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:52.000
<v 5>Why don't you just sit right here.</v>

1021
00:59:52.001 --> 00:59:55.840
We use the same microphone like were some of the backup singers at Lady Gaga.

1022
00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:00.490
<v 1>I was.
Hi Cleo.
All right,
let's let's,</v>

1023
01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.720
there's people sitting here right now wanting entertainment.
Okay.

1024
01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:08.900
I was sitting on a fucking couch together while you pet the dog is not going to

1025
01:00:08.901 --> 01:00:11.490
work.
You know what?
Go get another microphone.
Let's,
let's,
let's look at this.

1026
01:00:11.491 --> 01:00:16.480
This is cozy.
This is good.
Yeah,
but cozy isn't funny.
Go,
go,

1027
01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:20.910
go,
go,
go,
go,
go get the other microphone.
Get up.

1028
01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.201
I want it.
Yeah,

1029
01:00:22.201 --> 01:00:24.990
cause I've been telling people how much I enjoyed the lady Gaga concert.

1030
01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:28.680
Why are you lying?
Oh,
did you pick up that energy from me?

1031
01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:34.560
Say Low way with someone's daughter.

1032
01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:39.390
Sorry.
We've been listening to a lot of Van Halen lately.
Cleo.

1033
01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:44.040
This is what's known as a giant low.
Now,
if I was lady Gaga right now,

1034
01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:47.430
I could just sit here staring up at the fucking ceiling and everybody would be

1035
01:00:47.431 --> 01:00:50.160
cheering,
but that's not how a podcast works.

1036
01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:51.590
<v 4>Okay?</v>

1037
01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:53.870
<v 1>We got my dog's teeth cleaned the other day.</v>

1038
01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:55.550
She's got a problem with their fucking teeth.

1039
01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:58.400
Has Ginger vitis so they had to put her under and uh,

1040
01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:04.190
we picked her up at the vet and she was still high and whenever they gave her,

1041
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.210
she had these crazy fucking eyes.
It really freaked me out.

1042
01:01:08.211 --> 01:01:10.610
And actually for half a second I was sitting there going like,
you know,

1043
01:01:10.611 --> 01:01:13.190
all that stuff they say about pit bulls,
how they are nuts.
And they just,

1044
01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:17.690
they just fucking snap out of nowhere if ever I thought that that was actually,

1045
01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:22.370
<v 5>well,
I just got saved by the bell.
You would just trashing me somehow.</v>

1046
01:01:22.371 --> 01:01:24.530
That wasn't recording.
Let's go back to this.
So,

1047
01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:27.520
<v 1>so evidently I,</v>

1048
01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:29.250
<v 4>okay.</v>

1049
01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:32.290
<v 5>I haven't done only what you're saying.
I ruined this then we got,</v>

1050
01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:36.720
it was literally you just sitting down.
Oh,
this is such a tragedy.
You just,
well,

1051
01:01:36.721 --> 01:01:38.500
you were hammering me.
Well,

1052
01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:43.230
there's no shortage of irritation from last night so we can retell the story.

1053
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:44.510
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1054
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:47.050
<v 5>What do you want to know?
I thought I,
I thought you,
I know I,</v>

1055
01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:50.300
those I know sort of ruined it.
You didn't ruin it.
I actually,

1056
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:55.160
I woke up three times,
only yelled out three times.
You know what,

1057
01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:58.880
when I do the bitch please podcast,
which will be happening soon,
by the way,

1058
01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.490
I need to talk about,
you know what,

1059
01:02:01.491 --> 01:02:05.870
I'm going to save it because last night was a perfect example of,

1060
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:09.890
you know,
women need to realize their,
their,

1061
01:02:09.891 --> 01:02:14.090
their boyfriends strengths and weaknesses.
And I knew,

1062
01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.620
I knew that this sort of thing was going to be a weakness and I should have

1063
01:02:19.621 --> 01:02:23.670
listened to that instinct.
Okay.
But anyway,
the point is,

1064
01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:28.710
I went there and I got more drunk.
You were drunk as a skunk.
All right,

1065
01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:31.800
let's start from the beginning.
Okay?
But I want you to know this.

1066
01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:36.270
I want you to know this.
I'm not saying I'm innocent.
I need you to,
no,

1067
01:02:36.271 --> 01:02:38.820
you don't need to.
I don't need to hear anything,
right?
And I went there,

1068
01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:43.200
I wanted to have a good time.
I was like,
yes I did.

1069
01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:46.340
Cause you would have tried if you,
but you didn't because it's like,
hey man,

1070
01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:49.790
she fucking rode a horse out of a vagina.
That was,
no,

1071
01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:50.880
that was something different.

1072
01:02:50.881 --> 01:02:55.320
She came out of a vagina and it's just ridiculous to talk about.

1073
01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:59.100
It was the,
it was the spinal tap.
Oh No.

1074
01:02:59.101 --> 01:03:01.290
I mean it was the gayest thing ever,
but it was,

1075
01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:05.020
I mean I thought it was fantastic.
It was every okay musical theater,

1076
01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:09.880
crazy artsy kind of fantasy rolled into one.

1077
01:03:09.881 --> 01:03:14.410
It was completely over the top and completely ridiculous.
But it was so much fun.

1078
01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:18.520
I had a great time.
No,
what happened is this,
I'm the worst.
You came,

1079
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:23.050
you came home.
What happened was your garage as a bailed on you bailed on you.

1080
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:25.870
Okay.
Bad fit for that team.
Well,
no,

1081
01:03:25.871 --> 01:03:28.240
I never went to Howard with the Lakers.

1082
01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:31.180
Once we got tickets and I realize how much they were,

1083
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:33.520
I asked a couple people and they,
you know,

1084
01:03:33.521 --> 01:03:37.720
weren't able to do it for various reasons.
Nobody bailed.
No one said to me,
yes,

1085
01:03:37.721 --> 01:03:38.531
I'm definitely going.

1086
01:03:38.531 --> 01:03:41.260
Cause we didn't have definite tickets until the last minute.

1087
01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:46.340
So you come back from watching the pats and the ravens.
Yeah.

1088
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:50.080
Very good.
Um,
I walked down the street.
I was drunk.
Yeah,

1089
01:03:50.081 --> 01:03:51.760
you came while you were drunk.

1090
01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:56.761
You told me you had pounded six beers and you were sloppy and you were sliding

1091
01:03:56.831 --> 01:04:00.400
around on the hardwood floor on your,
your stocks,
probably seven or eight.

1092
01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:03.010
It's trying to find,
yeah,
exactly.
Trying to find your shoes,

1093
01:04:03.011 --> 01:04:06.760
which took half an hour for some strange reason.
Didn't 10 an hour.

1094
01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:08.140
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1095
01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:10.390
<v 5>I'm trying to do what you do,
which is to make it funny.</v>

1096
01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.233
<v 1>All right.</v>

1097
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:15.780
<v 5>You're such a fucking hypocrite on your own damn podcast.</v>

1098
01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.750
It's like you want to live in this world where it's like all your,

1099
01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:21.870
your rules and then someone comes in and tries to do a little bit of it and

1100
01:04:21.871 --> 01:04:22.740
you're not having it.

1101
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:27.300
<v 1>Look,
I gotta be honest with you.
It is my podcast.
So it is my fucking rules.</v>

1102
01:04:27.301 --> 01:04:30.840
But when I said that it didn't take a half hour,
that was,
it wasn't coming from,

1103
01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.940
I was coming from me being embarrassed,
like,
oh,
was I,

1104
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:36.660
<v 5>you should be embarrassed because you were embarrassed.
Okay.</v>

1105
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:41.250
So then we got into a cab.
Tell the story.
What did I say when I,

1106
01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:45.150
when I,
when I went into this and I saw the women over there,
we're walking up to,

1107
01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:48.190
to try to find,
we'll call and there was just a group of girls standing,

1108
01:04:48.191 --> 01:04:51.400
talking to each other about to go in or whatever and you just go,
okay,

1109
01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:58.800
really loud.
I remember that.
That was fun.
Apropos of nothing apropos.

1110
01:04:58.990 --> 01:05:02.770
No
their horse shoes on.

1111
01:05:02.771 --> 01:05:04.830
What are we not supposed to say?
Something you all,

1112
01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:08.230
you're not supposed to say anything.
You shut your fucking mouth.

1113
01:05:08.231 --> 01:05:12.770
Some fucking attention.
I just forgot the guy park in the cab.

1114
01:05:12.771 --> 01:05:15.120
So we're in the cab way worse in,

1115
01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:18.010
in traffic or something cause you bill's drunk.
Wherever.

1116
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.360
I plan on having drinks of this thing.

1117
01:05:19.361 --> 01:05:22.120
So we're taking cab and being responsible and this,

1118
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:26.460
this young white guy who's homeless who comes up with this side.

1119
01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:29.590
Do you remember this?
And the sign said smiles are free.

1120
01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:34.030
Can you just get a job?
You fucking bomb.
Yeah.

1121
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:37.570
I'm reverse racist when it comes to homeless people.
White,
Male,

1122
01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:41.410
fucking heterosexual.
There's no reason for you to be homeless.

1123
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:46.570
Poverty affects a lot of different people.
Bill,
not just the way lady Gaga Gaga,

1124
01:05:46.571 --> 01:05:50.290
wait,
done that.
She would've been like poverty and looked up at the ceiling

1125
01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:53.320
affects everyone.

1126
01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.770
So you're saying because he's like a white male age this to this.

1127
01:05:56.771 --> 01:05:58.870
It's like why are you you,
you've kind of,

1128
01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:02.520
you're already set up for so called success and that's why what,

1129
01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:04.870
you know what we're getting,
we're getting past the point anyway.

1130
01:06:04.871 --> 01:06:08.080
We get in there and then you do your,
you do your ladies thing.

1131
01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:09.460
What if it were that simple?
He w

1132
01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:11.203
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1133
01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:15.370
<v 1>like tapping out of this.
You can kick ass.
Don't do that.
Don't be like that.</v>

1134
01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:20.410
Listen,
there's a reason why the expression bum exists.

1135
01:06:20.830 --> 01:06:22.400
You're a bum.
There's,
there's,
uh,

1136
01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:25.510
the reason why that word came up is because there's people out there who are

1137
01:06:25.511 --> 01:06:29.900
bumps.
Okay?
Smiles are free.
First of all,

1138
01:06:29.901 --> 01:06:32.870
he's a hack.
He didn't come up with that.
It's nothing fucking original.

1139
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:35.670
He's not thinking outside the box.
To me,
this guy needs to,

1140
01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:40.020
he needs to challenge himself.
I mean,
you think I liked getting heckled on stage.

1141
01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.550
I go up there to make you fucking laugh.

1142
01:06:41.551 --> 01:06:44.160
Forget about your problems that go on stage.
Hey,
go fuck yourself.

1143
01:06:44.161 --> 01:06:45.720
You read at a con I to deal with that.

1144
01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.330
This guy should be walking up and down the street with his stupid sign.

1145
01:06:48.331 --> 01:06:49.164
He doesn't get heckled.

1146
01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:52.960
<v 5>Can we go back to the lady Gaga thing?
Sure.
I'm at,
I know I brought it up.</v>

1147
01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:55.510
I shouldn't have because I'm already annoyed with you.

1148
01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:57.300
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1149
01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:02.010
<v 5>Oh really?
So anyway,
we get into the show and what else happened?</v>

1150
01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:05.730
What?
I said,
why did I have you wanted to get better?
I was having a good time.

1151
01:07:05.770 --> 01:07:08.440
Good Berate me.
Think people should be berated.

1152
01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:11.550
You deserve to be berated after the things that you pulled last night.

1153
01:07:11.730 --> 01:07:16.540
Then as we're in the concert at various times,
you go,
Jay,
there's fucking cry.

1154
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:21.620
Oh,
what the fuck?
Fucking the self help horse shit.
Oh,

1155
01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:23.100
it's driving me fucking nuts.
Nia.

1156
01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:27.300
She was doing that after every fucking song and I only said Jesus fucking Christ

1157
01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:30.030
three times.
It was a fucking two hour fucking concert.

1158
01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:33.180
You actually only said at once.
I was exaggerating.
Okay.

1159
01:07:33.181 --> 01:07:36.600
So I only said at one fucking time and the whole time I'll go and do not ruin

1160
01:07:36.601 --> 01:07:40.490
this for Nia.
Well,
guess what?
You failed.
What?

1161
01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:44.400
John?
My God,
epic fail.

1162
01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.110
I got to tell you something.
Let me tell you,

1163
01:07:49.111 --> 01:07:52.860
don't like something you are going to do.
You know what?
I took you there.

1164
01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.510
Why did you?
Because I love you.

1165
01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:56.670
That's why I knew it was fucking important to you.

1166
01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:58.860
And I knew that you were bummed that your friend bail.

1167
01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:00.390
And I said I was gonna fucking go.

1168
01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:03.240
Should I had eight bud wives before I went there?
No,

1169
01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:04.860
but even in my drunken stupor,

1170
01:08:04.861 --> 01:08:07.860
yelling at white homeless people and those fucking girls with the horse shoes,

1171
01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:12.600
I still only said Jesus fucking Christ in two and a half fucking hours watching

1172
01:08:12.601 --> 01:08:14.760
somebody pulling plants out of the fucking crowd,

1173
01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:18.620
ripping off Madonna who couldn't really even fucking dance coming out of a

1174
01:08:18.621 --> 01:08:22.460
castle and a fucking vagina.
I always said,
I said,
Jesus fucking Christ.

1175
01:08:22.461 --> 01:08:24.980
Three times,
that's pretty fucking shouldn't have gone then.

1176
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.570
You should not have gone.
And I said to you beforehand,
why are you doing this?

1177
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.690
You know,
this is not your thing.
You want to do Gaga.

1178
01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:36.140
When she was at the Wiltern and no one would go and man,

1179
01:08:36.141 --> 01:08:39.620
you brought and no one will go through and maybe me feel bad and you fucking

1180
01:08:39.621 --> 01:08:43.460
been bringing it up for four fucking years.
And I was like,
God damn it,

1181
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:46.250
she's going to see it this time and I'm going to go there.

1182
01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:48.470
And it had I not had an eight fucking Budweiser's,

1183
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:51.800
I just would have rolled my eyes and said,
Jesus fucking Christ.
Okay.

1184
01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:55.520
But the problem with Lady Gaga is no one in her fucking circle is going,

1185
01:08:55.521 --> 01:09:00.260
Jesus fucking Christ.
Of course not.
She's a huge pop star,
right?
Well,

1186
01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:03.700
you know what is,
it's very easy actually helping routes to say,
oh,
right.

1187
01:09:03.701 --> 01:09:08.530
It's like she needs your fucking house.
Are you kidding me?
That whole place.

1188
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:12.530
Great with a seat.
The seats were amazing.
I got great pictures.
No,

1189
01:09:12.531 --> 01:09:15.800
I had a great time.
But like I said,

1190
01:09:15.801 --> 01:09:20.210
I will discuss this on my own podcast.
The bitch please podcasts.
Um,

1191
01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:22.670
can I get a little bit of credit?
Jesus fucking Christ.

1192
01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:25.640
Only three times what I saw at once.
Okay.

1193
01:09:25.641 --> 01:09:30.590
I said it one fucking time watching that spinal tap shit didn't even need to say

1194
01:09:30.591 --> 01:09:32.900
it at all.
I said to you,
don't come.

1195
01:09:32.901 --> 01:09:35.000
If it's going to be something where you're going to be rolling your eyes and

1196
01:09:35.001 --> 01:09:38.000
being obnoxious and what happened?
You came and you were obnoxious.

1197
01:09:38.690 --> 01:09:43.280
You don't even remember.
You were like,
I wasn't drug.
What are you talking about?

1198
01:09:43.281 --> 01:09:44.780
You don't even reply or half this shit.

1199
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:48.530
I'm telling you it for the phrase how I remember it.

1200
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:52.070
It doesn't matter how you remember your two drunks or am I writing up for the

1201
01:09:52.071 --> 01:09:55.460
first song?
By the second song I was sitting down and I was like,
I don't care.

1202
01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:58.280
It doesn't matter if you're sitting down and I was like,
wait a minute,

1203
01:09:58.910 --> 01:10:02.060
I don't want to,
I don't want to ruin this for it.
And I stood back up.

1204
01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:05.420
At one point I was texting with a friend of mine about the game and you said,

1205
01:10:05.421 --> 01:10:07.210
who are you texting too?
Yeah,

1206
01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:11.300
that's the longest text I've ever seen and I was fucking breaking down the game

1207
01:10:11.301 --> 01:10:15.390
and I was letting you enjoy the fucking,
the thing that I did.
Enjoy it.
Okay,

1208
01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:16.970
enjoy it.
But

1209
01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:22.800
I used to listen to my instincts on that one,
which is what?

1210
01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:28.060
That you shouldn't have gone.
All right,
well fuck it then.
I tried.

1211
01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:32.950
I tried.
I tried and tried and failed miserably.

1212
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:38.180
I thought you were having a good time.
I was having the time,
but you didn't know.

1213
01:10:38.181 --> 01:10:42.920
There were moments where I was just like,
yeah,
you know something.

1214
01:10:43.190 --> 01:10:47.330
What's,
you should have listened to your instincts.
Listen to this podcast.

1215
01:10:47.331 --> 01:10:50.610
Know better than go to a lady Gaga concert with me.
They know better than that.

1216
01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:54.950
I know.
I know now I did.
You know those tickets?

1217
01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:56.630
We're not fucking cheap.
They were not.

1218
01:10:56.631 --> 01:10:59.930
They were not cheap and I fucking went there and I put some fucking money in

1219
01:10:59.931 --> 01:11:04.290
that broads fucking pockets and after the fifth fucking hour of her,

1220
01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:08.900
of her self help horseshit and then claiming that everybody said that you

1221
01:11:08.901 --> 01:11:13.530
couldn't bring the gay underground and the mainstream when fucking it it.

1222
01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:17.880
It hasn't been underground.
Underground for forever.

1223
01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:21.380
Yes.
Well,
they make sitcoms about gay guys.

1224
01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.570
They said will and grace to fucking modern family.

1225
01:11:24.571 --> 01:11:26.520
That show that's ripping off modern family.

1226
01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:30.960
That fucking gay black dude on the Tyra banks show was the chandelier on his

1227
01:11:30.961 --> 01:11:34.150
fucking head.
The other one with the silver hair,

1228
01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:36.240
it's not underground anymore.

1229
01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:42.840
You try to describe things that you don't know the names of his next top model.

1230
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:45.510
Fantastic.
America's next top.
My America's next top model.

1231
01:11:45.511 --> 01:11:50.040
Take that fucking guy there.
Who,
who like you know the j?
Yeah,

1232
01:11:50.041 --> 01:11:53.570
that dude and Mister Jay Master Jay has,
let me tell you something.
That hair,

1233
01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:57.150
if that fucking guy was on TV when I was growing up,

1234
01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:01.150
they would have been fucking like,
oh.
Like they wouldn't be like what?

1235
01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:04.530
They couldn't believe it if he was just like,
ah,
like,

1236
01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:08.100
or if there was anybody openly gay when I was growing like it's,
it's over.

1237
01:12:08.101 --> 01:12:12.300
Nobody gives a fuck anymore and they shouldn't.
Okay.
It's,
it's like a,

1238
01:12:12.301 --> 01:12:13.134
I can't explain.

1239
01:12:13.290 --> 01:12:18.290
I can't explain for her to claim that like what I watched last night.

1240
01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:24.060
All right.
And no way.
I guess if she was in Nebraska that would be shocked.

1241
01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:28.740
But I watched that shit and none of it was shocking to me and I was just sort of

1242
01:12:28.741 --> 01:12:33.540
looking at it going like,
she's fucking ripping Madonna off brutally.

1243
01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:36.690
Yeah.
But when she came in on that black horse though,
that was like,

1244
01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:41.100
I stopped in my tracks.
We hadn't even gotten to our seats yet and I was like,

1245
01:12:41.101 --> 01:12:42.810
what I got

1246
01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:48.050
because I really don't want anything that's going to continue to disappoint.

1247
01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:51.270
This is actually making the mail.
This is going to make fun of me though.
Yeah.

1248
01:12:51.271 --> 01:12:55.830
I was so drunk at that point when I brought up the horse on the podcast,

1249
01:12:55.890 --> 01:12:57.150
there was part of me going.

1250
01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:00.570
Now was that a horse or is that two people in the horse?

1251
01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:04.110
You know when you're hanging under the guise waste and then you walk in,

1252
01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.510
you know the Horse Costume,

1253
01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:10.290
you know horse costume back like is the ass and somebody who's at the front.

1254
01:13:10.290 --> 01:13:11.600
Yeah,
I couldn't and it off.

1255
01:13:11.601 --> 01:13:15.960
It was two guys on like stilts now as an actual horse.
It was an actual horse.

1256
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.850
Beautiful horse.
Poor fucking horse.

1257
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I know it was on the road back habit everywhere with them.

1258
01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:27.000
Maybe it's a different horse and every city they planned it out and she was
like,

1259
01:13:27.001 --> 01:13:30.450
I need to have a black stallion.
Alright,
sure.
Everywhere we're,
no,

1260
01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:31.963
they brought that horse.

1261
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:35.910
You have to have a horse that isn't going to freak out with a bunch of shirtless

1262
01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:40.770
people.
Gyrating all,
oh God.
What about the girl who's just completely naked?

1263
01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:42.420
She goes,
it goes,

1264
01:13:42.421 --> 01:13:46.500
give it up naked mermaid and then they just show this girl,

1265
01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:50.730
just God,
God.
I said,
are you over 18 he says,
okay,
good.
All right,

1266
01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:56.010
well she had her tits out.
Yeah,
that was funny.
And I laughed.
I laughed.
No,
Nia,

1267
01:13:56.011 --> 01:14:00.140
I swear to God.
In my heart of hearts,
I came there to be entertained.

1268
01:14:00.141 --> 01:14:02.790
You know what?
I believe you because I know you.

1269
01:14:02.791 --> 01:14:06.750
I believe that you the of course,
the only reason why you,

1270
01:14:06.751 --> 01:14:11.751
you build bird would ever go to a lady Gaga concert is because you love me.

1271
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.610
I know that because there is no way in hell you would ever do that for anyone

1272
01:14:15.611 --> 01:14:18.520
else.
Never.
No.
And she can sing.
She like she,

1273
01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.270
she say she can sing lives with drummer was the shit I had.
My God,

1274
01:14:22.271 --> 01:14:25.640
that drummer was awesome to Betty was in the dungeon.
You couldn't even see

1275
01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:30.460
that guy was fucking,
oh I get it.
I know you have good intentions but that's,

1276
01:14:30.490 --> 01:14:32.350
that's my point though.
You,

1277
01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:36.190
I as someone who is in a relationship and has known you for a long time,

1278
01:14:36.191 --> 01:14:39.820
like I need to understand your limitations and as much as you might have good

1279
01:14:39.821 --> 01:14:44.140
intentions,
I have some sort of special needs,
special needs.

1280
01:14:44.141 --> 01:14:45.440
You are my special.
Nice.

1281
01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:49.870
You have good intentions

1282
01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:55.120
and I need to recognize that in you and be like,
oh he can't go to this.

1283
01:14:55.121 --> 01:14:59.620
Cause he won't.
He won't know how to ads.
So it's fine.
But I appreciate you.

1284
01:14:59.621 --> 01:15:00.670
You got take it to me.

1285
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:04.420
I will go to that shit again and this time I will be stoned,

1286
01:15:04.421 --> 01:15:09.040
fucking sober and I won't yell out Jesus fucking Christ.

1287
01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.650
I wish I knew what the fuck she said when she said it.

1288
01:15:11.651 --> 01:15:15.490
And I swear to God it would have been.
I would be,
I would be vindicated.

1289
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.440
I just don't have that evidence cause I don't remember it.
Okay,
wow.
Whatever.

1290
01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.850
All right,
whatever.
That's the podcast for this week.
Okay.

1291
01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.900
Can we talk about my podcast?
Yeah.
What about your podcast?

1292
01:15:25.901 --> 01:15:27.400
Whatever now you get is going to shit all over.

1293
01:15:27.401 --> 01:15:28.900
Miss going to be more of an extension of this,

1294
01:15:28.901 --> 01:15:32.050
except I won't be there to defend myself.
He exactly perfect.

1295
01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:35.450
Then I'll be listening.
Oh

1296
01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:41.950
no I'm not.
I'm really trying not to do like the female bill burr.

1297
01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:45.880
That's not what I'm going for.
What is it?
What you like can't do.
This is

1298
01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:51.760
what you do is just do a 10 minute one.
There were 15 minute one.

1299
01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.550
You just build it up and you just naturally figure out which way it's going to

1300
01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:59.950
go and that's what you do and then you know there'll be people from this podcast

1301
01:15:59.951 --> 01:16:02.680
that we'll go over there and then.
Then there'll be people from this podcast.

1302
01:16:02.681 --> 01:16:05.890
Well it's too much like this.
I'm not into that,
so some of them won't.

1303
01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:09.160
But other people you're pulling,
you're pulling your own crop.

1304
01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.520
I have to be like lady Gaga and not have any fucks to give.
Yeah,

1305
01:16:12.521 --> 01:16:13.354
you don't give a fuck.

1306
01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:17.860
But I liked that part of it because all this week I've been dealing with a bunch

1307
01:16:17.861 --> 01:16:21.790
of other stuff and it's like,
yeah,
you really can't give a fuck sometimes.

1308
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.880
So that was my takeaway from it.
I had an awesome time in that concept.

1309
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:28.960
Thank you for getting sick eds.
I really appreciate it.
It,
it was so much fun.

1310
01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:30.190
You know how much it meant to me.

1311
01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:33.700
But when her next album comes out and I go to the next show because I plan on

1312
01:16:33.701 --> 01:16:36.850
going in the next show because I had that much fun.
You are not coming.
Okay.

1313
01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:38.680
And I'll take care of it on my own.

1314
01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:43.830
I'll find somebody else and I agree saying this to me like there's going to be a

1315
01:16:43.841 --> 01:16:48.100
debate and you are not allowed to go away.
Now I feel like a Douche.

1316
01:16:48.101 --> 01:16:51.360
I'm almost a 45 year old guy and I'm sitting there shitting on a God damn pop

1317
01:16:51.361 --> 01:16:52.780
star.
Good for her.
God bless you.

1318
01:16:52.781 --> 01:16:56.710
Sell at the fucking staple center when there's no music industry anymore.

1319
01:16:56.710 --> 01:16:59.410
It's an amazing accomplishment that she did it and yeah,

1320
01:16:59.470 --> 01:17:02.440
she's not trying to appeal to some guy,

1321
01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:07.980
a 45 year old guy who just drank eight Budweiser watching AFC championship game.

1322
01:17:08.710 --> 01:17:13.190
Yeah,
you are not exactly sure.
What was the show?
Not In your wheelhouse.

1323
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:17.390
Wow.
What an edgy comedian who you're going to tech next week,

1324
01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:21.980
but whatever that new boy band is that did the drew Brees commercial.
Right.

1325
01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:27.230
Well anyway,
anyways,
I really hope everyone listening.

1326
01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:28.670
I put it on Twitter and stuff,

1327
01:17:28.671 --> 01:17:32.260
but like I'm starting to basically use podcast soon.
Just giving you a hand.

1328
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:36.350
Thank you.
And I emailed me questions.
I'm making it an an advice show.

1329
01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:39.440
You stopped doing that nauseous.
Yeah,

1330
01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:41.990
it is just like your whole demeanor last night.

1331
01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:45.240
So make sure you email me some questions.
I'm doing an advice show.

1332
01:17:45.241 --> 01:17:47.670

1338
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:13.310
So send them my way.
Okay.
All right.
Now before you read your emails,

1339
01:18:13.311 --> 01:18:16.730
put on your Tufts skin suit.
Yes.
Cause there's a lot of tough Pete.

1340
01:18:16.731 --> 01:18:19.260
There's some of the toughest typers you've ever seen it.
Oh yeah.

1341
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:22.940
They're real real brain.
All those guys on Twitter,
on the inner,
Ooh,

1342
01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:24.950
some of the toughest typing I've ever read.

1343
01:18:24.951 --> 01:18:29.951
I know Twitter feeds my fingers actually quiver when I go to hit and block.

1344
01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.150
All right.
Everybody hope you enjoy it.

1345
01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:38.900
<v 2>Yes.
Evidently I'm a drunk old conch and my apologies to lady Gaga.</v>

1346
01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:42.400
God bless you.
Continued success.
Uh,

1347
01:18:42.650 --> 01:18:46.190
and I really believe now that that guy with the green hair that he pulled out of

1348
01:18:46.191 --> 01:18:46.350
the,

1349
01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:49.220
she pulled out of the crowd that knew all the dance routines was actually just

1350
01:18:49.221 --> 01:18:52.880
some fucking guy was such a big fucking fed that he knew everything and knew

1351
01:18:52.881 --> 01:18:56.420
when to go into the castle through the vagina.
God bless you.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1352
01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:57.260
I'll talk to you next week.
