Hey,

Just before Friday.

3
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.770
I'm just checking on your,
on your,
uh,
I fucked up today.
I,
uh,

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.050
I forgot it was Thursday.
I really wasn't doing shit today.

5
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.120
It's just one of those,
uh,
you know,
you never had one of those days.

6
00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:25.220
You didn't know it was Thursday or how is it Thursday?

7
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.930
I thought it was Wednesday.
Yeah.

8
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:31.320
I had one of those days and I was just fucking driving around.
I met a buddy,
uh,

9
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:32.840
it was on my way out to a

10
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.260
<v 0>okay</v>

11
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.330
<v 1>fucking Santa Monica to go smoke a cigar.</v>

12
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:40.470
My first one in like a month and a Andrew's like,

13
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:43.710
you're going to record today.
And I was like,
record?
And he's like,
yeah,

14
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:48.330
it's Thursday.
I was like,
oh Geez.
Is there,
so,
uh,
my apologies.

15
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.980
My apologies.
I didn't check in on you.
Yeah,
I almost didn't,

16
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:56.340
did you feel not loved?
You know,
this is when you really think about it.

17
00:00:56.341 --> 00:01:00.030
This is like the end of one of those feel good like Christmas movies or

18
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:03.630
afterschool specials and like we didn't think you were coming and then you're

19
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:04.464
dead.

20
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.030
But I guess I didn't for most of you cause there's 10 26 La time as I'm

21
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:11.400
recording this.
So most of you guys back east.

22
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.440
<v 1>It's central time.</v>

24
00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:18.441
I just fucked over half the people in this country as far as not checking in on

25
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:20.640
him as far as people that listen to this podcast.

26
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:24.120
So I'm basically saying that if this was a presidential campaign,

27
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.270
this would be the end of my campaign.
I would have to,
uh,

28
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.750
I'd have to try and fight it off,
you know?

29
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.510
<v 0>Okay.</v>

30
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.480
<v 1>Most of Bard,</v>

31
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.930
you tell the people of America,

32
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:41.931
you're going to do a podcast every Thursday as last Thursday.

33
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:44.820
And even good about it the last year or so.

34
00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:49.821
But last Thursday you actually did not check in on the east coast or the central

35
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:54.360
coast or the central part of the country,
whatever it's called.

36
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.010
That's half the country.

37
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:59.460
Is this what the American people can look forward to if you are elected

38
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:02.720
president?
I brought Debbie,
I,
you know what,
yeah,
they can look forward to,

39
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.320
you know,
I didn't think I was going to get this far.

40
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

41
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.260
<v 1>You know,
I thought I was doing pretty good reading the shit off there.
I'm,</v>

42
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:11.840
excuse me,
reading this,
the,
uh,

43
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.230
the stuff off of the teleprompter and now I guess it's over.

44
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.800
So well,
yeah,
sorry to the east coast and the central areas.

45
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.050
My,
no,
it's our food supply and where a lot of a,
I dunno,

46
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.570
a lot of the comedy and the cold weather comes from right.

47
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.850
So I apologize.
Oh,
Jesus.
Um,
yeah.

48
00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:39.340
I had my first garden like fucking month and it was delicious.
It was delicious.

49
00:02:39.341 --> 00:02:42.280
It was bad.
It was bad.
I fucking went to the,
uh,
the cigar shop.

50
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.410
The guy was a like,
where you Ben?
I was like,
Hey,
you know,

51
00:02:45.411 --> 00:02:48.670
I'm down to two a month.
He goes,
oh,
it's great.
It's great.
A fucker went in there.

52
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.610
It was just,
I just missed it.
I missed the smell.

53
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.810
I sound like fucking champ kind.
I miss the way you smell.

54
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.990
And I went in there was hilarious.

55
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.280
<v 2>I went to this place,
Hollywood smoke out in,
um,
out in,
uh,</v>

56
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.710
Santa Monica and as I was driving down main street,
great,

57
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.410
great fucking street out here in La,
you know,

58
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:14.650
it's Saint Patty's day and it was just getting geared up was like right around

59
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:15.320
six 30,

60
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.320
like just the absolute fucking shit show that is Saint Patrick's day out here

61
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.960
and I should say in the United States,
absolute Shit Shield,

62
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:29.110
the fucking light green plastic hats,

63
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.270
those fuck heads are out,
you know.
And then you had the,
the girls,
you know,

64
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:37.390
of course Horan it up.
You got to love that.
I still,

65
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.060
he's smoking hot fucking chicks with like,

66
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.170
but the same colored like is those green plastic hats,

67
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:48.040
like mini skirts with like thigh highs on.
So I'm like,
all right,

68
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:52.840
they're obviously slinging drinks or maybe they're not,
you know,

69
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.460
maybe they really are attention horse because I swear to God,

70
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:00.340
I don't know what the fuck you'd go out in public wearing something like that

71
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:04.840
for on a night when people who usually don't drink are going to get even more

72
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:06.510
hammered or I guess any,

73
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.090
it's just amateur night and you're going to fucking walk around with something

74
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:13.180
like that.
Well what's wrong with you?
Jesus Christ.

75
00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:16.780
Didn't your mother ever talked to you and sit you down and be like,
listen,

76
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.410
there's nothing wrong with dressing like a who uh,

77
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.460
just do not do it on the following holidays.
Saint Patrick's Day,

78
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.620
New Year's and the 4th of July.
Okay.
Every other time.
Thanksgiving.
Okay.

79
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:32.560
You want to let the girls dot a little bit.
I don't have a problem.

80
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:36.610
Just don't say sit across to me at the dinner table cause you're still my little

81
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:37.331
girl.
All right.

82
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:40.340
Unless they have some big like floral arrangement and you can see,
you know,

83
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.600
you can,
you can blow your boyfriend at that point.
I'm not going to know,

84
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:46.480
but don't do it because you give your father a heart attack.
Right.

85
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.130
Then they ever sit you down and tell you that ship.
Well,

86
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.520
if they did,
they didn't say it to these two.
They were walking down the street.

87
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.750
I mean,
it's fucking unreal.

88
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.180
Like literally like hookers didn't dress like that when I was a kid.
Um,

89
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.430
and it got me thinking like what the,

90
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:07.300
I always forget what the fuck Saint Patrick's day is.

91
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.610
So I'm going to Google that right now.
Saint Patrick's Day.
Here we go.

92
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.910
All right.
We all know it's on March 17th.

93
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.510
Is this the thing where the guy chased the snakes out of the fucking town,

94
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.980
which just completely seems like a bullshit story to make or was that some other

95
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:25.030
guy was a flute?

96
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.810
Did that guy know it was the Pied Piper and he got rid of the rats.

97
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.820
That was their problems back then.

98
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:33.580
It wasn't my phone died and my fucking Internet is too slow.

99
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:36.220
They literally had fucking reptiles and rodents

100
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.710
fucking spreading disease that was age back then.
You know,

101
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.240
she said a bunch of fucking rats would come to town and they'd bite one fucking

102
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:49.570
dude.
They then brats no to right.
The they fucking,
they would,

103
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.470
they'd fucking bite this studly as guy there and he,

104
00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:56.620
he's of course fucking tag in every winch in town and next thing you know,
right.

105
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.210
They're all coughing on their fucking husbands or that it was over.

106
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.140
And then thank God some guy would come by,
some guy who's probably,
you know,

107
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.070
never got picked to go on the rape and pillage tours,
you know,

108
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.040
that was like getting picked last in gym class back then.
Right.

109
00:06:12.041 --> 00:06:14.110
And all of a sudden he just finds his head and talent.

110
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.460
He picks up for flute and he fucking dances around and everybody follows him out

111
00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:20.740
of town.
All the rats do.
Right.

112
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.190
You know what's funny about that story is they never say,

113
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.330
once he gets out of town with the rats,
like then what did he do?

114
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.150
You know,
fucking throw the flute at them and then run back,

115
00:06:34.151 --> 00:06:36.160
double back to town and hope that they're a little rat.

116
00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:41.050
Brains can't figure it out.
I mean they found it once,
right?

117
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.470
I don't know.
All right.
Let's get case.

118
00:06:43.471 --> 00:06:48.280
Saint Patrick's Day is the day of the festival of Patrick.
Oh,

119
00:06:48.281 --> 00:06:49.630
thank you.
Well,
that,
that sums it up.

120
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.790
It's a cultural and religious celebration held on the 17th of

121
00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.490
the Torah.

122
00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.490
The traditional death date of Saint Patrick who lived from three 85 to four 61

123
00:07:02.531 --> 00:07:07.180
that's a fucking good Ron for back then,
Huh?
He really wasn't saint,
not smoking,

124
00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:12.030
not drinking,
not most of them with the who was what's said?

125
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.240
That's 70 let's see,
15 and 61 oh shit.
We all know that.

126
00:07:16.241 --> 00:07:20.990
76 years.
I was like living to 110 now and I evidently,

127
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.710
he was the foremost patron saint of Ireland.

128
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.740
This guy was a fucking five star general here.

129
00:07:26.741 --> 00:07:30.190
Saint Patrick's day was made an official Christian feast day in the early said,

130
00:07:30.191 --> 00:07:32.200
well,
what the fuck did Saint Patty Dope?

131
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:33.590
<v 0>Okay,</v>

132
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.390
<v 2>Saint Patrick,
let's get back to this fucker.</v>

133
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:40.310
Let's see why he became a Saint Patrick of violin redirects here.
Oh Jesus.

134
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:44.030
Doesn't he look miserable?
Does anybody look happy in a stained glass window?

135
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.240
They always will look.
They got the fucking weight of the world on them.

136
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.790
What is wrong with my religion?

137
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.630
Jesus can as is that one picture of Jesus smiling,

138
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.830
like cracking up,

139
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.880
hanging out with the apostles and somebody farted or something and they just

140
00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:01.490
decided to paint them in that moment.
They just never do it.

141
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.580
He must've had some fun.
Right?
Well,
speaking of Hoas,
Dinny fuck,

142
00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:10.820
and he laid down with the,
what the fuck was her name?

143
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.880
That's a good horn name from back then.
Huh?
Apple.
All right.

144
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.990
All right.

145
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:25.960
Saint Patrick or this was a fifth century Romel Ramano Bro.

146
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.890
Oh No.
Come on.

147
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:32.750
Ramano British Christian missionary and Bishop in Ireland known as the apostle

148
00:08:32.751 --> 00:08:36.080
of Ireland.
He's the primary patron saint of Ireland.

149
00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:37.850
This all sounds like filibustering right now.

150
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:41.510
Like they're trying to kill a bill along with saint thou who gives a fuck.

151
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:45.380
He's also said the burp does equal two apostles.

152
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.460
The date of Patrick's life cannot be fixed with certainty,

153
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.000
but on a widespread interpretation.
He was an active,

154
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.210
he was active as a missionary in Ireland.
Oh,
we spread

155
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.130
<v 1>the disease there.</v>

156
00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:58.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

157
00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.590
<v 1>They celebrate this guy.</v>

158
00:08:59.591 --> 00:09:02.200
He brought that fucking horrific religion to them and now look at them.

159
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.910
This still drinking because of this guy's mission.
Uh,

160
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.020
during the second half of the fifth century,

161
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:14.050
early medieval tradition credits him with being the first bishop of a something

162
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.320
primate of Ireland.

163
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:16.940
<v 0>Okay.</v>

164
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.030
<v 1>Now he's hanging with an ape.
All right.
I didn't know those gorillas and fucking,</v>

165
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:24.530
it's probably a chimp,
right?
No,
it could be a chimp that fair skin.

166
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.280
Well,
actually they all got fair skin there.
Maybe that's where you go.
If,

167
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.340
if you get a sunburn,
the grill is like,
yeah,
fuck that.
I need the heat,
man.

168
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.233
You know,

169
00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:36.770
stupid fucking chimps going up there with that fucking white face like me.

170
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.190
All right.
According to the confederacy of Patrick,
when he was about 16,

171
00:09:40.191 --> 00:09:42.260
he was captured by Irish pirates.

172
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.820
You mean drunks from his home in Great Britain.
I always from Britain.

173
00:09:46.821 --> 00:09:51.821
Now fuck is what this guy's guy was all over the place and taken as a slave to

174
00:09:51.921 --> 00:09:56.660
Ireland,
looking after animals where he lived for,
you're working on a farm.

175
00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:01.430
They're really ramping this guy up where he lived for six years before escaping

176
00:10:01.431 --> 00:10:05.330
and returning to his family was pretty amazing.
How the fuck did he do that?

177
00:10:05.331 --> 00:10:06.164
He needed a boat.

178
00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:07.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

179
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.030
<v 1>People are incredible shaped.
Any probably swam it.
Right.
You know?</v>

180
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:17.170
That's probably why he lived so fucking long.
You do that one time.

181
00:10:17.171 --> 00:10:20.980
If you swim from Ireland to go back to fucking London,

182
00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.710
wherever the fuck he was from,
I mean,
yes.

183
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.720
Basically you've gotten all the cardio that you need to do in your life out of

184
00:10:27.731 --> 00:10:28.031
the way.

185
00:10:28.031 --> 00:10:32.350
The guy was probably fucking shred until he was like 66 then the last 10 years

186
00:10:32.351 --> 00:10:35.830
are brutal.
All right.
After becoming a cleric,
whatever the fuck that is,

187
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.100
that's either an accountant or something religious.

188
00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.370
He returned to know I would click on it,
but it's not highlighted,

189
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.660
which makes me feel dumb.

190
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.850
I'm supposed to like automatically know what that means.

191
00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.310
He returned to northern and western Ireland.

192
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:49.780
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

193
00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.000
<v 1>Oh,
that's a smart move for you.
Fucking leave the country,</v>

194
00:10:52.001 --> 00:10:54.340
the dead enslaved you and then you come back.

195
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:56.590
<v 0>Okay.</v>

196
00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.780
<v 1>Fucking Ian Mcshane.
In later life,</v>

197
00:10:58.781 --> 00:11:02.200
he served as a bishop but little teddy bash,

198
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.280
Mr. Black Magic.
Um,

199
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:08.800
but little is known about the places where he worked by the seventh century.

200
00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:12.430
He had already come to read.
Nobody knows anything about this fucking guy

201
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.420
you served as a bishop,

202
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:18.510
but little is known about the places where he was a fucking bishop.

203
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.180
It was kind of a bishop somewhere over there.

204
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:22.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

205
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.400
<v 1>Making it seem like he like he was a cobbler a by the seventh century.</v>

206
00:11:27.401 --> 00:11:32.100
It already comes out to be revered as the patron saint of Ireland.

207
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:34.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

208
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.620
<v 1>All right.
I don't want to be a cunt on Saint Patrick's Day,</v>

209
00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:39.230
but don't you think there's a little gap in the information there?

210
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.470
This is like the story of Jesus where it's like,
Yay.

211
00:11:42.471 --> 00:11:47.471
He was a little baby and they brought some gifts over and then he was 33 on a

212
00:11:47.601 --> 00:11:51.510
cross.
Some point he did some carpentry and he banged a horse.

213
00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.780
The other than that,
right.
There's and nothing there.

214
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.080
This fucking guy was a bishop somewhere in western northern and western Ireland

215
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.240
little's known about that.

216
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:04.270
And then by the seventh century he was a patron saint of Ireland.

217
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:11.410
What did he do?
Name dating to Patrick's theories.
Life.
All right,

218
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:12.370
let's get to his life.

219
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.533
<v 0>Okay.</v>

220
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.860
<v 1>The age of 16 he was captured by hours.
I already read this shit</v>

221
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.120
to six years of captivity.
He heard a voice,
sorry.
Yeah.

222
00:12:24.121 --> 00:12:26.970
He went crazy telling him that he would soon go home.

223
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.290
It sounds like it was malnourished to me and then that that his ship was ready.

224
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.560
Fleeing as master kind of sounds like a Batman Robin relationship,

225
00:12:36.561 --> 00:12:39.610
if you know what I mean.
They keep was the gimp.
He traveled to a pool.

226
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.580
He traveled to a port 200 miles away.

227
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:46.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

228
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:50.410
<v 1>Travel.
Travel.
How he took the subway.
You mean you walked where?</v>

229
00:12:50.411 --> 00:12:54.700
He found his ship and was difficult and with difficulty persuaded the captain to

230
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:59.070
take him in.
Yay.
Fucking blow them.
That's about it.

231
00:12:59.071 --> 00:13:00.930
That's the most difficult persuasion.
Right.

232
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.250
Unless you know he was happy to be with his master early.
I don't know.

233
00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:06.570
This all sounds like,
I don't know,

234
00:13:06.571 --> 00:13:09.960
some sort of gay love triangle to me after three days sailing,

235
00:13:09.961 --> 00:13:12.600
they landed presumably in Britain.
You know what?

236
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.480
I'm glad we drink on this fucking day.
You know,

237
00:13:15.481 --> 00:13:16.770
if you're going to be that fucking vague,

238
00:13:16.771 --> 00:13:19.560
this is like why you feel the next day after you went and Dick,

239
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.280
what'd you do last night?
I Dunno,

240
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.290
I was kind of a drunk in our western La that,
uh,

241
00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:30.160
the cops came and I fucking heard this voice in my head saying,
uh,

242
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.230
that there was a,
uh,
a ship waiting for me,
you know?
Yeah.

243
00:13:34.231 --> 00:13:37.740
What do you mean you called Uber?
Yeah,
basically.
All right.

244
00:13:37.741 --> 00:13:40.720
I apologize for all of that.
Happy Saint Patrick's Day.
Everybody.

245
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.270
A lot of you are probably still up drinking,
getting shit faced and all that.
Um,

246
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.700
why not?
Why not?

247
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:49.230
<v 0>Okay.</v>

248
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:53.880
<v 1>I missed all the match madness.
Um,
I don't watch the first fucking rounds.</v>

249
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:57.990
You know what I mean?
Every once in a while this upset there's an upset,
right?

250
00:13:57.991 --> 00:14:01.620
You should just watch holy cross.
They fucking disappoint somebody every year.

251
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.600
Send everybody going home crying.
I'm going to try to watch on Saturday,
but a,

252
00:14:06.601 --> 00:14:08.910
I'm busy over the next couple of days,
but,
um,

253
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.180
I have been watching my Bruins again and after that big fucking hot streak,

254
00:14:12.181 --> 00:14:16.210
I start watching them and then they start losing.
So,
uh,

255
00:14:16.211 --> 00:14:20.640
they're playing the kings this Saturday and uh,

256
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.910
I'm going to take the gang because I feel like if I don't watch it live,

257
00:14:23.911 --> 00:14:26.250
they're going to win and then I could watch it and I can enjoy it.

258
00:14:26.251 --> 00:14:27.320
But I'm starting to,
you know,

259
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.570
ramp back up with the hockey is the playoffs are coming and I watched the kings

260
00:14:30.571 --> 00:14:34.800
verse the Dallas fucking stars,
um,

261
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.850
get ready for a barn burner and the kings just came out and gave him the old

262
00:14:38.851 --> 00:14:42.930
right there.
Fred gave him to fucking quick ones.
Then,
um,
you know,

263
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.340
and I was sitting at home,
you don't mocking announces gut.

264
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:49.260
I'll tell you right now,
the next goal is lost support.
Goal is gay,

265
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.310
obviously KCC,
they go up three nothing or that's the stars.
Cut It in half.

266
00:14:54.311 --> 00:14:56.710
We can do the fucking math when the numbers of that low.

267
00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.930
So what you got to love about hockey.
You know,

268
00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:02.080
the numbers are always nice and low.
It's very rare.
Does it go over?

269
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.800
You never really have to count over five.
I think that's why it appeals to me.

270
00:15:05.801 --> 00:15:06.940
That and the fighting,
right?

271
00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:11.830
So the star score next and it's two to one and then they dead.
You thinking,
okay,

272
00:15:11.831 --> 00:15:16.330
here we go.
We got a game and that Bam fucking they score again.
Three,
two,

273
00:15:16.331 --> 00:15:19.000
one after one.
The next thing you know,

274
00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:21.700
I go out and make myself a grilled cheese sandwich and I come back and it's

275
00:15:21.701 --> 00:15:23.680
fucking five to one.
However,

276
00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.440
that doesn't mean that's how it's going to go in the playoffs.
Um,

277
00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:29.470
those are two of my favorite teams out in the West.

278
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.000
Of course the Romans are always my favorite,

279
00:15:31.001 --> 00:15:32.710
but out of the Kings are stars are really fun to watch.

280
00:15:32.711 --> 00:15:37.030
So I'm getting psyched for the,
uh,
for the hockey playoffs.

281
00:15:37.031 --> 00:15:38.200
Speaking of which,
um,

282
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:43.070
I have an open invite to do the great Joe Barton next puck off podcast and a,

283
00:15:43.071 --> 00:15:47.860
I'm going to try to do that sooner rather than later.
But,
um,

284
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.190
I'm excited about that and I got to get into the whole march madness thing.

285
00:15:51.191 --> 00:15:55.030
So that's basically,
that's basically my life.
Right.
And,
um,

286
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.740
so you're probably thinking like,
well bill,
you know,

287
00:15:56.741 --> 00:16:00.730
I know you tell jokes at night,
you have to know when you're fucking spots are.

288
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.530
How did you forget it was Thursday?
Well,

289
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:08.440
all freckles here had a really fucking busy day because a,
they started a,

290
00:16:08.441 --> 00:16:13.420
they started making my,
my little baby gym,
my little getting shaped,

291
00:16:13.421 --> 00:16:17.770
Jim getting shaped girl Jim at the back of my,
uh,
garage.
And uh,

292
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.690
so I had to clear everything out.

293
00:16:19.691 --> 00:16:23.140
And unfortunately I had to put my truck in storage for the next couple of weeks.

294
00:16:23.141 --> 00:16:24.670
I was only going to take them like two or three weeks,

295
00:16:24.671 --> 00:16:29.050
which means six months in construction talk,
um,
for them to,
uh,

296
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.750
to complete this project.
And,
uh,
I,

297
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.160
I can't tell you how fucking sad I was dropping that truck off.

298
00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:41.740
It's unreal.
Every time I look at that truck or I start driving it,

299
00:16:41.741 --> 00:16:44.610
I have this big goofy fucking grin on my face like you ever hear?

300
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.830
Like when people drown,
you know,

301
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.030
after you go to the horror of drowning,
right?
Areas as you go to pass out,

302
00:16:52.031 --> 00:16:53.980
like all this dopamine is released.

303
00:16:53.981 --> 00:16:56.950
And I guess when they find you under water and your cement shoes,

304
00:16:56.951 --> 00:17:01.420
you have this goofy smile on your face provided they didn't drop him like a

305
00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.920
thousand feet of water on your head,
didn't it fucking explode?
Um,
you always say,

306
00:17:04.921 --> 00:17:08.800
I guess have this fucking like when they find scuba divers and underwater caves,

307
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:13.510
um,
you know,
cause they get lost.

308
00:17:13.511 --> 00:17:16.750
I mean Jesus Christ talking about that most fucking horrifying thing ever.

309
00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.580
Fucking going in there.
I mean,
Jesus Christ.
What do when mean,

310
00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:23.050
what do you do when you're underwater?
You can't drop breadcrumbs.

311
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.990
How'd he get back?
There is no fucking,

312
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:33.760
that is the most fucking insane thing you could ever do.

313
00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:36.790
Let's go explore some underwater caves.

314
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.390
Can you imagine that shit and then you fucking get lost.

315
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.020
Wow.
Dude,
there's got to be stories of people that survived.

316
00:17:46.021 --> 00:17:47.280
I want to hear that mind.

317
00:17:47.281 --> 00:17:52.281
Fuck how the fuck you keep yourself calm cause you know you're going to panic

318
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:56.210
and then you're going to start breathing faster and that fucking Shit,
you know?

319
00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.760
Oh my God.
I don't know what I would do.

320
00:17:59.761 --> 00:18:03.210
I would just get my flippers going as fast as I could and try to knock myself

321
00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:04.440
out against the fucking wall.

322
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:06.660
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

323
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.970
<v 1>You know,
and you couldn't because you're underwater.</v>

324
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.230
You can't even fucking knock yourself out.
What do you do then?

325
00:18:13.231 --> 00:18:15.900
I think you just swim up to a big fish and give it the finger and hope it

326
00:18:15.901 --> 00:18:19.830
fucking what she out of them out of your misery.
Um,

327
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.510
the fuck was I talking about?
Fuck did I get onto that?

328
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.270
I was talking about dropping the Oh,
driving a truck off.
Yes.
So,
um,

329
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.620
I gotta be honest with you man.
Like,
like no new cars do it for me.

330
00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.170
They're all the fucking same.

331
00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:37.290
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

332
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:39.870
<v 1>Pisses me off.
You know,
cause my car is getting old man.</v>

333
00:18:39.871 --> 00:18:43.920
My car is like eight years old.
Granted seven or eight years old.
Yeah.

334
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:48.680
It's going to be eight years old since I've had it October this year.
And,
um,

335
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:53.550
I've maintained the thing,
you know,
I take it back to the dealership.

336
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:57.840
I haven't do the whole thing.
I pay through the fucking nose and,
uh,

337
00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.020
it runs like a God damn top.
It runs like a fucking top to the point.

338
00:19:01.021 --> 00:19:05.070
I'm not even nervous about saying it,
but the interior's going to shit,
right.

339
00:19:05.071 --> 00:19:08.280
The steering wheels all fucking worn out.
And uh,

340
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.670
but I love the car because I can park it anywhere and I don't give a fuck if

341
00:19:11.671 --> 00:19:14.450
anybody drives into the thing.
Um,

342
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.580
but my buddy who I smoke cigars with,

343
00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:21.420
he's got this fucking Cadillac and I really like it,
you know,

344
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.520
<v 2>and I like him more than the fucking,</v>

345
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.940
I dunno everybody out here is leases of fucking

346
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.900
<v 0>okay.</v>

347
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.740
<v 1>The BMWS,
the fucking most,
every other dose has one of those out here.</v>

348
00:19:31.741 --> 00:19:35.010
So I don't want to get one of those.
And uh,

349
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:36.960
<v 0>okay.</v>

350
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.840
<v 2>Audi's are cool.
You know what,
God,
Audis,
Audi,</v>

351
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.640
Audi's is like the fucking bill Bellacheck draft pick.

352
00:19:41.641 --> 00:19:45.420
That's the second round guy or the guy who gets picked in the third round and

353
00:19:45.421 --> 00:19:48.690
has something to fucking prove.
Like,
I feel like Audi has something to prove.

354
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.130
You get more bang for your buck.

355
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:54.480
We're fucking BMW and a fucking,
you know.

356
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:55.470
<v 0>Okay.</v>

357
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:56.281
<v 1>Mercedes,</v>

358
00:19:56.281 --> 00:20:00.210
they like the first round draft pick holding out for a fucking bigger contract.

359
00:20:00.211 --> 00:20:04.550
Fuck those cars.
Right?
No,
I'm German too,
man.

360
00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:08.570
I'm mostly German.
I should be fucking,
I guess Audi's German too,
right?

361
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.320
I Dunno.
But,
um,
I like buying American shit though,

362
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.610
even though it's probably built the fucking Mexico or Turks and Caicos,

363
00:20:16.611 --> 00:20:20.720
whatever the fuck they build them now.
Um,
so I'm thinking like,
all right,

364
00:20:20.721 --> 00:20:21.890
well my buddy's got a Cadillac.

365
00:20:21.891 --> 00:20:24.740
I can't go and get a fucking caddy pull up next to him and look like single

366
00:20:24.741 --> 00:20:26.320
white female freckles over here.
Right.

367
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.660
<v 2>So I go,
what about the fucking Lincoln mark five or whatever.</v>

368
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.770
Don't they still make that car?
So I go to the fucking Lincoln website.

369
00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.420
When the fuck did they deep ball that car or did it just not keep up?

370
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:42.440
That thing used to be the answer to Cadillac and that you can get one for like

371
00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:43.670
35 grand.

372
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:44.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

373
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.600
<v 1>Which is not,
it's still 35 grand.
But I thought would they would,</v>

374
00:20:47.601 --> 00:20:51.680
it would be like up there
like with the caddies,

375
00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.190
like the caddies or like,
you know,
they,

376
00:20:54.191 --> 00:20:58.850
they kind of end where all the high end BMW's and Mercedes fucking end.
Right.

377
00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.690
So I figured the Lincoln was going to be up,
like I thought I was going to,

378
00:21:01.691 --> 00:21:03.800
you know,
it'd be like some luxury car and this is the thing,

379
00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:07.220
nobody drives one of those,
which should be great.

380
00:21:07.221 --> 00:21:10.670
So I got something a little different.
It's got nice,
you know.
Nice fuck.

381
00:21:10.671 --> 00:21:14.300
It's a great old man car.
Fucking Lincoln,
you know,

382
00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.750
you drive around in it,
people look at you,
they gotta look at that guy.

383
00:21:17.751 --> 00:21:20.300
He's probably a member of the NRA.
I don't want to fuck with that guy.

384
00:21:20.301 --> 00:21:24.050
It's a fucking,
it's a classic old man car.

385
00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.640
And uh,
I dunno if I'm looking at the wrong model,
but they have like,

386
00:21:28.641 --> 00:21:33.200
all they have is fucking SUV is now.
And then they have like the,
uh,
I don't know.

387
00:21:33.201 --> 00:21:34.370
I looked at the car and was like,

388
00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.430
you ever see somebody used to go to the gym every day and then they don't

389
00:21:37.431 --> 00:21:41.240
anymore.
And you can see,
you can kind of see like,
oh yeah,

390
00:21:41.241 --> 00:21:43.280
that guy used to work out and now we,
uh,

391
00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.480
now he gets like three appetizers before he dies into the fucking,

392
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.550
I'll speak to that dude.
I,
when I dropped the car off,

393
00:21:52.551 --> 00:21:54.560
I had to wake my lovely wife up and she,
you know,

394
00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:58.670
follow me over and it was early in the morning.
She's not a morning person.
Right.

395
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.620
And,
uh,
so I told her I'd take her on,
go to breakfast.
She of course eats healthy.

396
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:05.363
<v 3>MMM.</v>

397
00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:07.940
<v 1>You know,
still looking gorgeous.
And I,</v>

398
00:22:07.941 --> 00:22:12.941
first thing I see on the menu was a eggs benedict with fucking pulled pork and

399
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:18.460
you know,
came with potatoes and like an asshole.

400
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:21.110
I ordered it and I have been paying for it the whole day.

401
00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.970
I've barely been able to keep my eyes open all day while you youngsters out

402
00:22:25.971 --> 00:22:30.260
there,
that's what fucking happens to you when you get older or young.
Dude,
Yo,

403
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:34.120
you got low miles on your digestive track,

404
00:22:34.121 --> 00:22:37.370
you can go eat something fucked up and then go play Frisbee football,

405
00:22:37.371 --> 00:22:38.660
whatever the fuck it issue.
Kids do.

406
00:22:38.661 --> 00:22:41.360
Go fly a drone around an airport and freak out some pilots,

407
00:22:41.361 --> 00:22:45.140
whatever it is that you guys do,
whatever you wacky kids do,

408
00:22:45.141 --> 00:22:48.530
put on a virtual reality fucking helmet and a,
I dunno,

409
00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.310
take video if you fucking next door neighbor and then you fucking bagging them

410
00:22:52.311 --> 00:22:54.530
and then you feel weird when you see when you go to get the mail,

411
00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.730
whatever it is you kids do.
Um,
yeah,

412
00:22:58.731 --> 00:23:01.610
you can do that after reading fucking Mcdonald's.
I,
I cannot,

413
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.303
I can't.

414
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.240
We actually postmate had McDonald's the other day and like fucking 1230 at night

415
00:23:08.241 --> 00:23:12.380
and I got to tell you,
it was fucking delicious.
And the next day I woke up,

416
00:23:12.381 --> 00:23:14.390
I was like,
did I get into a bar fight last night?

417
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:19.100
And you lose horrifically like was I the guy like laying,

418
00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:22.190
you know those old school bars where they didn't have stools and they just had

419
00:23:22.191 --> 00:23:24.110
that brass rail fee to put your foot up on.

420
00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:27.560
You ever see a guy who ends up like in between the bar and that thing while

421
00:23:27.561 --> 00:23:29.000
there's like three people kicking him,

422
00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:33.320
you know that that classic guy in every other bar and fucking Boston.

423
00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:40.340
I felt like that happened to me and they just kicked me right in the stomach,

424
00:23:40.341 --> 00:23:44.660
the entire fucking beat down.
Um,
what did I order?
You didn't ask.

425
00:23:44.661 --> 00:23:46.430
I got double cheeseburgers

426
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:51.430
<v 2>and the fucking large fry and I enjoyed every second of it and I distinctly</v>

427
00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:56.300
remember at least three times Nia looking over at me telling me to slow down.

428
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:58.790
I fucking eight Lincoln.
I,
you know,

429
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.710
I ate like a guy that fucking ordered out for Mcdonald's.
So as you can tell,

430
00:24:03.711 --> 00:24:06.830
my gym can't get here soon enough.
Um,

431
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.390
I ordered,
I ordered all of my shit from rogue fitness.

432
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:16.870
Thanks a lot for not fucking hooking me up and recognizing my h level celebrity

433
00:24:17.421 --> 00:24:20.330
status.
You could at least given me a fucking one kettle bell.

434
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.540
He couldn't even do that.
Well,
I got to beg you guys,

435
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:28.850
you know I love about it is I don't know Yanni think.
And if you fucking wait,

436
00:24:28.851 --> 00:24:33.110
show up and they're too heavy,
I'm going to trash it.
Um,

437
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.830
I ordered the weights and I wanted the colorful ones and near tease me out of
it.

438
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:41.830
She actually used like some sort of like Jedi mind trick with a little bit of

439
00:24:42.651 --> 00:24:44.090
fucking homophobia.
She's like,

440
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:47.720
those are the ones you're going to get that rainbow color.
She goes,

441
00:24:47.721 --> 00:24:49.910
they look a little corny.
I go,
I like them.
They're different.

442
00:24:49.911 --> 00:24:54.911
Like the 45 is a blow and then the 30 fives or a night,

443
00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:00.740
a nice lime green and then the 25 is a yellow.

444
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.090
I didn't think it seemed more than,
didn't seem a feminine to me.

445
00:25:05.091 --> 00:25:08.140
It seemed more like a Fisher prices first.
Uh,

446
00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:11.500
I know your first fucking dumb bells.
I Dunno.

447
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.300
So she teased me into getting the fucking manly once,
you know,

448
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.740
like the Clint Eastwood once the old school fucking once.

449
00:25:18.741 --> 00:25:23.741
So I got those in a weak bench and I got a little fucking retractable rack with

450
00:25:25.671 --> 00:25:29.750
my pull up bar.
And A,
I dunno,
we'll see what happens.

451
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:34.820
You know,
it's funny,
as I have the ability to do squats with this thing,

452
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:39.200
if I want to add,
uh,
like most guys,
I hate to end legs.

453
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.560
I don't know what it is.
It's just,
it's not sexy.
You know what I mean?

454
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.260
You fucking do anything in the upper body.
You know,

455
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.480
all you do is you do like 1 cent,

456
00:25:47.481 --> 00:25:51.530
you spend the next 20 minutes flexing in the mirror with your legs.

457
00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:55.490
You just like,
oh fucking hurts.
You know,
and you just,

458
00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:00.620
you really don't get anything or you don't,
there's no ego boost to legs,
right?

459
00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:04.020
If you fucking never miss leg day,
like you're,
you're the,

460
00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.920
the level of discipline that you have.
I have to respect that.

461
00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.980
I put you right underneath people that have the balls to explore an underwater

462
00:26:12.891 --> 00:26:16.010
cave in.
Um,
all right.
And with that,
let's,
uh,

463
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:18.590
let's read a little bit of advertising.

464
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:22.960
God knows it won't be rogue fitness as mother fuckers.

465
00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.240
Where did they get off?
Blown off and nobody liked me.

466
00:26:26.241 --> 00:26:29.360
Can you fucking believe that every God damn day you,
you're on TV.

467
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.160
And they show somebody,
right?

468
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:35.810
Somebody I used to be on Charles in charge is getting a new fucking deck.

469
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.360
You know,
he's getting his dream deck and he's go,
oh my God,

470
00:26:38.361 --> 00:26:43.361
I can't believe you guys did my wife set this up all I asked for a couple of

471
00:26:43.641 --> 00:26:44.030
fucking,

472
00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:47.840
<v 1>you know,
barbells,
hey,
we get back to me.</v>

473
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.750
<v 4>Okay.</v>

474
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:54.580
<v 1>It's coming off real cold,
rogue fitness.
Um,
anyways,</v>

475
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:57.970
by the way,
rogue fitness.
According to them,
all of this shit is made in,

476
00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:02.140
made in America.
Now,
granted,
they might be using illegal immigrants,

477
00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:06.270
you know,
with welding masks or whatever the,
however the fuck you make weight,

478
00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:07.871
you know,
you know,

479
00:27:07.871 --> 00:27:10.800
they're doing that in making the horse shoes and like fucking 20 other things.

480
00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:15.580
Poor bastards.
Um,
you don't want Donald Trump wants him out of the country.

481
00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:20.560
I'll tell you.
Um,
all right,
me,
Andy's,

482
00:27:20.561 --> 00:27:25.200
everybody.
Oh,
but it'll boop,
boop.
Me,
Andy's me.
Andy's Amar fucking fed shit.

483
00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.550
[inaudible] do do,
if I keep eating Mcdonald's,

484
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.040
I won't even get to where underwears.
Uh,
but if I do,
I can dry off my balls

485
00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.150
and fucking flush them down the toilet.
In a bathroom stall.

486
00:27:37.151 --> 00:27:40.450
I always say bathroom stall now.
Okay.
Whether you're wearing a suit or sweats,

487
00:27:40.451 --> 00:27:43.870
you spend almost 24 hours a day in your underwear unless you're like a fucking

488
00:27:43.871 --> 00:27:44.880
filthy animal.

489
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:48.550
And they've understood guys that don't wear underwear because I swear to God,

490
00:27:48.551 --> 00:27:51.730
no matter how much is shake your Dick after you take a Piss,

491
00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:55.510
no matter how much you fucking Ypo and stick a whole box of cleanups up there,

492
00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.970
there's always going to be a little tinkle.
You know what I mean?

493
00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.510
You never realize it to that day.
You go fucking,
you know,

494
00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.960
you go commando and then you're walking out of the bathroom.
You're like,

495
00:28:04.961 --> 00:28:09.850
why is one of my calves sweating?
Oh,
that's right.
Right.

496
00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.270
You need it though.
Oh,
boat boat me,
Andy.
Sorry ladies.

497
00:28:13.271 --> 00:28:15.460
But that's the way it works.
All right.
Okay.

498
00:28:15.461 --> 00:28:20.380
But instead of making a statement like Superman's tights under his co,
uh,

499
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.820
under his everyday clothes,
your,

500
00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.930
your underwear is probably boring me undies is here to change that.

501
00:28:28.931 --> 00:28:32.330
I think there was a joke in there and I blew it.
Um,
all right.

502
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:37.950
Every pair pair of me undies is made from sustainable source modal model of

503
00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:41.800

504
00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:47.650
Nothing can describe the fit and the feel of Mont me undies yet we're still

505
00:28:47.651 --> 00:28:50.710
going to have more copy.
I love how you can't fucking describe it yet.

506
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:53.230
I still have to read 20 more fucking paragraph.
So this shit.

507
00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:54.760
But once you try them on,

508
00:28:54.761 --> 00:28:57.760
you'll understand while they're called the world's most comfortable underwear.

509
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.520

510
00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:04.600
No questions asked.
Hey,

Keep it.

511
00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.770

Copy me.
And he said,

512
00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:13.030
why can't I send it back to you?
The soiled underwear.
You know,

513
00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.990

515
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:24.210

uh,
enter burr.

572
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:55.140
So all Billy fucking drum stick.
I got these,
uh,

573
00:32:55.141 --> 00:32:58.090
these new Zildjian cymbals,
right?
Um,

574
00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:04.250
the fuck do you spelled Zildjian
where are they?

575
00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:08.340
Oh,
they got these new fucking
symbols,
right?

576
00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:09.780
That they actually made.

577
00:33:09.781 --> 00:33:12.540
They almost look like you remember those Mesh shirts that people were in the

578
00:33:12.541 --> 00:33:17.160
eighties?
Um,
they look like that,
right?
And uh,

579
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.610
they thought it'd be this cool new sound and it barely made a sound.

580
00:33:20.611 --> 00:33:21.510
So they thought it was a,

581
00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:26.250
they were a failure until somebody figured out that they're actually great for

582
00:33:26.251 --> 00:33:28.950
practicing in if you can't,
you know,
play loudly.

583
00:33:28.951 --> 00:33:33.300
So I obviously didn't make a drum room,
so I had my little practice pad kit,

584
00:33:33.301 --> 00:33:36.720
and now I got symbols on them and that fuck the fuck and shit.

585
00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.230
There's still loud as hell.
I can't play with my wife is home,
but you know,

586
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:44.730
she's always working.
So when she leaves,
I sit down and play and I got to admit,

587
00:33:44.731 --> 00:33:48.420
man,
they're fucking awesome.
And you know,
a couple hundred bucks.

588
00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.460
It's not that bad.
Nice and fucking cheap.

589
00:33:50.461 --> 00:33:53.190
You get to play along and even though they got all the fucking holes in them,

590
00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:57.150
you can still bounce the sticks.
Work on you.
A little technique there,
you know,

591
00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.750
be a little fucking maniac.
Whatever the hell it is you want to do.

592
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:05.040
Where the hell are they?
Oh,
then I called sound off.
What the fuck are they?

593
00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:06.000
God dammit.

594
00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.450
I got to get the names of these things because they're fucking awesome

595
00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.300
cause shit I should have fucking said I do.
Yeah,

596
00:34:13.301 --> 00:34:17.350
they wouldn't give me any free shit with they.
I want free shit man.

597
00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:20.890
I've come to that point.
I want some free fucking shit.
God Damn it.

598
00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:25.300
I'm gonna start talking about apple.
So I'm going to start small.
All right.

599
00:34:25.301 --> 00:34:28.450

I got fucked.

602
00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.790
I didn't know that.
God dammit.
I spent like 70 bucks to bucks.

603
00:34:42.791 --> 00:34:46.470
What a dope.
Ah,
Jesus cried looking at it.

604
00:34:46.471 --> 00:34:50.620
I hate a fucking wait like a month from to come in.
What is wrong?

605
00:34:50.621 --> 00:34:52.410
I just don't like computer.
I should try,

606
00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.810
should try to like computers more every once in a while.
Oh Shit.

607
00:34:55.811 --> 00:34:58.000
It's already 34 fucking minutes,
isn't it?
Um,

608
00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:01.300
and it's late at night and I got an early day tomorrow.
So,
uh,

609
00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.800
was there anything else that I wanted to talk about?
You know,

610
00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:10.870
I'm so sick of people talking about their fucking brackets.
I don't give a fuck.

611
00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:15.850
I'll do,
by the way,
I was a,
he's an La story for you.

612
00:35:15.851 --> 00:35:18.190
I was out in my car the other day,
right?
And all of a sudden,

613
00:35:18.191 --> 00:35:22.480
like four fucking police cars just went flying by me.

614
00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.270
And then this and right above me there was like,

615
00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.020
I swear it seemed like another four fucking helicopters.

616
00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:32.710
And I was like,
what the fuck?
The fuck is that?
Right?

617
00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:37.090
So I go home later and I watched the God damn news and some fucking

618
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.220
had stole,
stolen a police car.

619
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:43.950
So the first fucking one that went by,

620
00:35:43.951 --> 00:35:48.200
I never saw the guy was actually the fucking dude they would chase.

621
00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:50.610
And I thought it was a bunch of them go in and I swear to God,

622
00:35:50.611 --> 00:35:54.510
if they had been doing like fucking 90 miles an hour down this road,

623
00:35:54.511 --> 00:35:58.650
that was like a 30 mile an hour zone,
right.
So,
uh,

624
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:03.120
you know,
they fucking follow the guy,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada and all that.
He won't stop.

625
00:36:03.121 --> 00:36:04.530
They spit them out,
they won't stop.

626
00:36:04.531 --> 00:36:09.360
And then finally this fucking cop in like the police SUV just fucking gives him

627
00:36:09.361 --> 00:36:13.030
the old right there,
Fred to the fucking driver's side door.

628
00:36:13.031 --> 00:36:16.890
It just totally just cave this thing in.
And I was just like,

629
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:21.720
oh Jesus Christ.
That's at least a separated shoulder full life.

630
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:25.530
And uh,
I guess they ended up shooting the guy.
I mean,
you know,

631
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:29.430
I mean at some point you,
you,
you know,
you have to use deadly force.

632
00:36:29.431 --> 00:36:33.270
Somebody is driving 90 miles an hour around just regular people.
You know,

633
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:36.060
if he was around irregular people,
that's understandable.

634
00:36:36.061 --> 00:36:38.280
You can go up on the sidewalk.
Nobody cares.
But he was around,

635
00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:42.720
he was around regular people.
They spun them out.
He wouldn't do they,
you know,

636
00:36:42.721 --> 00:36:47.040
they fucking removed his shoulder with an SUV and this motherfucker's still

637
00:36:47.041 --> 00:36:51.960
going at it and they just sigh,
you know,
we get what you're communicating.

638
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.260
You don't want to be here anymore.
And then that was it.

639
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:58.650
Fucking unreal man gave me the creeps,

640
00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:03.510
seeing somebody drive by knowing like this was the last like fucking 30 minutes

641
00:37:03.511 --> 00:37:08.070
of their life.
Unbelievable.
But having said that,

642
00:37:08.071 --> 00:37:13.071
I would rather go out like that then get lost in an underwater fucking cave.

643
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:14.790
God dammit.

644
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:19.470
I is there like a documentary on this gotta be something I got lost in an under,

645
00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.240
you know,
and you know the deal,

646
00:37:21.241 --> 00:37:24.840
like it's always like they'd tell those stories and the guy's like,

647
00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:28.230
they're playing the creepy music.
And it was like,
yeah,

648
00:37:28.231 --> 00:37:31.740
me and a buddy of mine decided that we were going to go explore some underwater

649
00:37:31.741 --> 00:37:33.010
caves and they just keep,
you know,

650
00:37:33.011 --> 00:37:36.510
and they start doing the reenactment and they just keep cutting.

651
00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:40.350
They know they show two divers,
but they just keep cutting back to the same guy.

652
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.140
And after like the third time they go back to and be like,
all right,

653
00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:46.700
well obviously the other dude fucking died or a,

654
00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:48.760
he got some serious fucking brain damage.

655
00:37:48.761 --> 00:37:51.090
Something happened because he's not in the documentary.

656
00:37:51.091 --> 00:37:53.010
What the fuck is going on?
And sure enough,
you know,

657
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:56.430
then there's always that creepy thing of like,
well,

658
00:37:56.431 --> 00:37:59.010
how come you lived in your friend?
Didn't I know what happened?

659
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:02.850
You fucking panicked and you grabbed his fucking regulator or whatever the fuck

660
00:38:02.851 --> 00:38:04.410
you called it,
right?

661
00:38:04.411 --> 00:38:07.290
And then you had all the air and he didn't have any and you got to go to bed

662
00:38:07.291 --> 00:38:10.460
with that every night,
you know?
I don't know.

663
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.030
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
All right.
Listen,

664
00:38:12.031 --> 00:38:14.310
I have to go to bed.
I got some shit to do.
I apologize.

665
00:38:14.311 --> 00:38:18.170
Happy Saint Patrick's day to everybody.
I hope you guys had a great one.
Uh,

666
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.100
hope you guys have a wonderful fucking weekend.

667
00:38:20.101 --> 00:38:22.470
And I know there was something else I wanted to talk to you about.

668
00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:28.020
Something that happened to me early in my week.
Fuck right.

669
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.860
Maybe on Monday,
maybe I'll remember it Monday.
I'll write it down.
Okay.
That's it.

670
00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.350
Have a wonderful weekend and I'll talk to you on Monday.

671
00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:24.803
<v 4>She changed.</v>

672
00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:31.700
She is

673
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:44.470
<v 5>the podcasts weapon of the week.</v>

674
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:46.430
<v 6>People send these things into me</v>

675
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:52.280
and I never have them in front of me,
which causes long awkward pauses.

676
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:58.040
All right.
Uh,
okay.
He has a podcast.
Question number one,
Phil,

677
00:39:58.041 --> 00:40:01.400
what does an east coast transplant do on Saint Patrick's Day?

678
00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:05.360
You're already know what it's like in Boston and in New York City.

679
00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.950
Is it the same or does no one in La really care?
Um,

680
00:40:09.951 --> 00:40:11.990
I might've mentioned this on my other podcast.

681
00:40:11.991 --> 00:40:15.980
I do not participate on Saint Patrick's Day actually went out last night.

682
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:17.600
You know,
I went out,

683
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:21.860
I got myself a couple of Jamison's and I had a corned beef sandwich and that's

684
00:40:21.861 --> 00:40:22.340
it.

685
00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:27.080
I do not go out on Saint Patrick's day is a sandwich or night,

686
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:32.000
same way New Year's eve is a bunch of people who a don't know how to drink,

687
00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:34.850
drink way too much.
They were green plastic hats.

688
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:39.590
They sing no fucking near green alligator and a long neck goose,

689
00:40:39.591 --> 00:40:44.410
all these stupid ass fucking songs.
And,
uh,
I dunno.

690
00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:49.400
It's,
it's,
it makes me sad.
Saint Patrick's Day.
It makes me sad because,

691
00:40:49.401 --> 00:40:53.300
uh,
when I look at what the Irish culture has chosen to focus on,

692
00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:57.200
it's no wonder we're all a bunch of angry psychopaths

693
00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:03.750
that uh,
even when we go to therapy,
you evidently it doesn't affect us.
Oh,

694
00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:05.180
is anybody else Irish out there?

695
00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.450
Like you have a go to a wedding that's not an Irish wedding.

696
00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:12.020
I went to a Jewish wedding and I went to a wedding a long time ago.

697
00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:16.070
This girl who was a Pakistanian and the weddings,
they were beautiful.

698
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:18.770
It was really a nice environment.

699
00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:22.970
It was all about the union of two people who are going to spend their lives

700
00:41:22.971 --> 00:41:27.971
together and a celebration of that and you go to an Irish wedding and the day

701
00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:31.940
is,
the main focuses is like when you get the invite,
it's like dog,

702
00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:36.290
is it to be an black?
Really,

703
00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:40.070
I'm flocking there.
That's what it is.

704
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:45.130
That's all people give a shit about is can I go there and get fucked up for,

705
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:49.400
for no money.
That's the big question.

706
00:41:49.401 --> 00:41:53.780
And then people get hammered and then resentments come out and then inevitably

707
00:41:53.781 --> 00:41:54.770
there's going to be a fight.

708
00:41:56.270 --> 00:42:00.770
Maybe that's why I like cocky reminds me of weddings I went to when I grew up.

709
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:03.170
So again,
back to your question,

710
00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.850
people do celebrate Saint Patrick's day out here is

711
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:11.240
I go to this place,
Tom Bergin stone on Fairfax,

712
00:42:11.241 --> 00:42:14.270
just south of Wilshire because it's a,
it's a mellow place.

713
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:17.960
They've got a jukebox in the corner that play in music,
but it's like background.

714
00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:22.220
It's not like you're going to listen to this whether you want to or not,

715
00:42:22.221 --> 00:42:27.020
sort of martial law sound system that they have and all these other bars where

716
00:42:27.021 --> 00:42:29.270
you got to sit there and scream at the person next to you,

717
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:31.820
much like they swim on ESPN.

718
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:35.120
Look at me just tying everything together this fucking week.
So yeah,
no,

719
00:42:35.121 --> 00:42:36.270
they definitely celebrated.

720
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:40.720
Obviously it's not the way it is back east because there's not a bunch of,

721
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:44.360
uh,
there's not as many Irish people out here,
but they're definitely out here.

722
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:48.470
They definitely do drink and they wear the green hats and all that type of shit.

723
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:53.480
But,
uh,
there's no parade,
there's no bagpipes.
There's just the boost.

724
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:58.010
We did just,
just,
just basically bare bones to the couple of corn beef sandwiches

725
00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:01.240
<v 4>corner and there's 12,000 kegs.</v>

726
00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:11.960
[inaudible]

727
00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:57.770
<v 1>I did it show in Dublin,
Ireland.</v>

728
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:01.320
All the crowds were great,

729
00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:06.160
but I got to tell you those fucking people in Ireland as a funniest,

730
00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:11.150
I can't even explain.
I sweat.

731
00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:14.280
It was just something about like when I go through Great Britain and Ireland,

732
00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:19.260
it's like Scotland and Ireland.
They liked the knuckleheads that I grew up with.

733
00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:22.830
And when I go to London,
London is like,

734
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:27.860
[inaudible] is kind of like all the people that I met when I went to New York

735
00:44:27.861 --> 00:44:31.560
that were from Boston.
So they,
they did move away from where were from,

736
00:44:31.561 --> 00:44:35.670
but they still brought that thing with them cause people in London are
hilarious.

737
00:44:35.671 --> 00:44:40.671
But I was doing a show Dublin on Monday night at the,

738
00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:45.090
the,
the vicar Ficker street theater or something.
Just this awesome venue.

739
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:47.280
And uh,
anyway,
so it was,

740
00:44:47.281 --> 00:44:51.600
it was on a Monday night and that's a really hard night to try and sell tickets.

741
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:54.240
And these people showed up in force.

742
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:55.710
<v 0>Okay.</v>

743
00:44:55.710 --> 00:45:00.630
<v 1>And I can't even tell you how
they were fucking hilarious.</v>

744
00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:05.631
Like I was on stage and there was this thing I was talking about about people

745
00:45:06.571 --> 00:45:10.530
hugging their kids and how that could pit is a good thing.

746
00:45:10.531 --> 00:45:12.920
But if you do it too much it could potentially make a weaker.

747
00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:17.930
So I mentioned and all I've been telling this story for like six to eight months

748
00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:21.980
and I've been saying how that,
you know,
my mother wasn't a hug,

749
00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.570
hug her and didn't hug us when we were kids.

750
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:28.740
And people just listen and it's just a small detail that leads to this other

751
00:45:28.741 --> 00:45:30.120
part that I want to talk about.

752
00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:33.960
So I've said that line

753
00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.690
uneventfully that's even a fucking word with with no,

754
00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:42.880
no issue whatsoever for like six months.

755
00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:47.380
Now I'm in fucking Ireland and I just throw that line out there like I'm not

756
00:45:47.381 --> 00:45:48.910
even thinking about it and say,
yeah,
I said,
you know,

757
00:45:48.911 --> 00:45:52.240
my mother didn't hug me when I was a kid and I'm getting ready to say the next

758
00:45:52.241 --> 00:45:56.020
sentence.
And like 15% of the crowd goes,
aw,

759
00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:01.990
I'm not even doing it the way they did.

760
00:46:01.991 --> 00:46:05.700
It just collectively broke my board.

761
00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:08.980
It was just such the classic fucking,

762
00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:13.450
it was like that Boston Irish thing that I grew up with distilled to its purest

763
00:46:13.451 --> 00:46:18.240
form with actually real Irish people were
I,

764
00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:21.640
you'd almost have to be that a fucking understand what was behind it.

765
00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.420
It was like I opened the emotional door,

766
00:46:25.421 --> 00:46:29.950
just a crack in automatically.
It's just,

767
00:46:29.951 --> 00:46:33.040
they just bust your balls about it.
Like you're fucking,
you know what?

768
00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:35.020
Like you think they,
I think we got hugs.

769
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:39.430
You're freckled can't shut the fuck up and tell the judge I can't even,
it just,

770
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:43.150
I,
I've been trying to,
I would try to explain it to Nia.
She laughed,

771
00:46:43.151 --> 00:46:46.870
but it's still,
yeah,
you kinda had to be there and then,

772
00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:48.861
you know,

773
00:46:48.861 --> 00:46:51.760
so I laughed at when I'm a fucking trying to get your sympathy and trying to get

774
00:46:51.761 --> 00:46:54.550
to this mess.
Next spot you assholes.
And the whole crowd fucking laughs.

775
00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:56.730
And then like a half hour later,

776
00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:02.460
what I had done when I was over there was I bought a bunch of DVDs with me.
Um,

777
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:04.200
like just the,
uh,

778
00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:08.580
basically the DVD itself with this little paper thing and I was just handing

779
00:47:08.581 --> 00:47:12.600
them out to people cause I'm trying to get them to show other people,
you know,

780
00:47:12.601 --> 00:47:15.480
when I'm out there so I can keep coming back.

781
00:47:15.481 --> 00:47:18.330
Basically trying to get them to spread the word on my comedy.

782
00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:20.910
And then someone's just like,
well why don't you just put it on Spotify?

783
00:47:20.911 --> 00:47:23.580
You dumb fucking I'm okay cause I'm old.
Alright.

784
00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:27.150
I feel like I have to bring the hard copy.
So I tell these assholes

785
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.150
that I'm them free DVDs at the end of the show

786
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:36.850
and I'm halfway through that Spiel,
telling them that they're getting a free DVD.

787
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:38.463
All right?

788
00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:42.130
And I'm in the middle of it and I hear this guy in the back of the cry goes,

789
00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.780
Oh fuck off.

790
00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:53.020
I don't even think I even explained what I was doing.

791
00:47:53.021 --> 00:47:55.360
I don't know if I had gotten to the part where they were free.

792
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.510
I don't know what the Fuck Oh,

793
00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:01.210
it was the fact that I was trying to once again go to a nice place where,
hey,

794
00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:03.220
you know,
I really appreciate you guys coming out.

795
00:48:03.221 --> 00:48:06.940
This really means a lot to me and I want to keep coming back here cause I think

796
00:48:06.941 --> 00:48:09.370
you've got a great comp country or whatever.
And I just,

797
00:48:09.371 --> 00:48:13.180
just opening the door that much.
Oh fuck off.

798
00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:17.720
So I finally just looked at him.
I went,
Jesus Christ,
they were already left.

799
00:48:17.721 --> 00:48:21.820
And I was like,
you know what?
I played in 20,
almost 22 years as a comedian.

800
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:26.950
I have played in front of some miserable motherfuckers,

801
00:48:26.951 --> 00:48:27.970
but you guys,

802
00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:31.840
and they were already laughing or the most miserable fucking concert I've ever

803
00:48:31.841 --> 00:48:36.510
been in.
And they loved it,
absolutely loved it.
And um,

804
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.050
it killed me that I couldn't go out drinking with the crowd

805
00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:42.470
<v 4>cause I had a fucking go a head,
an early flight.</v>

806
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:53.150
[inaudible]

807
00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:31.070
good question.
Bill.
I'm a gay Guy Fan

808
00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:34.690
<v 1>who was never has never has any problems downloading your podcast.</v>

809
00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:36.220
Oh Jesus Christ.

810
00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:41.650
I'd send you a free fucking DVD if he gave me a fucking address.

811
00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:43.620
Monta country.
We just can't,

812
00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:48.580
what's with the poet cares to cute downloaded what is with you.
It's not me.

813
00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.730
My website is fine.
It's never crashed.

814
00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:55.143
<v 4>Okay.</v>

815
00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:56.311
<v 1>Anyways,
you say,</v>

816
00:49:56.311 --> 00:49:59.700
I mentioned that because in the comments every week your listeners seem to think

817
00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:04.350
there is some correlation between not being able to download it and being a fig.

818
00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:08.340
Um,
first this Eaton,
they're actually quoting one of my jokes.

819
00:50:08.341 --> 00:50:09.660
If you haven't seen the joke,
okay.

820
00:50:09.661 --> 00:50:13.410
If you think I have a bunch of homophobes I did this bit called what do you

821
00:50:13.411 --> 00:50:17.580
effect?
And it had to do with,
uh,
it was actually anti homophobia,

822
00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:20.700
although some gay people,
the second they hear fag,

823
00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:23.790
they stand up and yell homophobe and what run out of the room.

824
00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:29.600
I call that a story.
Seattle.
Um,
anyways,
first,

825
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:33.950
this email isn't meant at all to get you to censor or to BPC.

826
00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.120
I like your stuff a lot.

827
00:50:35.121 --> 00:50:38.750
Your point of view was hilariously balls out and usually different from the same

828
00:50:38.751 --> 00:50:41.390
old comedy cliches.
But I'm curious,

829
00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:45.800
with all the hundreds of things you and your listeners identify as gay,

830
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:51.050
do you really still think most gay guys are the old stereotypes on most sitcoms

831
00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:55.490
and in Leno's monologue jokes out?
Jesus,
you're going to talk down to me,
sir.

832
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:59.360
Is that what it is?
Is that what you're going to do here?
Yeah,
I think that,

833
00:50:59.361 --> 00:51:02.510
I think you all go like the food is hair.

834
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:08.120
Don't you guys sing everything?
Is it really rarely?
Of course.
I don't think that,

835
00:51:08.121 --> 00:51:12.350
it's just funny and not to mention when we say stuff is gay,

836
00:51:12.351 --> 00:51:16.270
it has nothing to do with homosexuality.
Okay.
When you said,
you know,

837
00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:21.170
you liked this lamp,
now it's fucking gay.
Why is it gay?
Look at it.
It's gay.

838
00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:25.490
All right.
It just means it's a lame staying.
You know what it is?

839
00:51:25.491 --> 00:51:29.630
It just gives you that,
you know,
anything that gives you that feeling of,
um,

840
00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:32.090
it's not love.

841
00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:33.700
<v 7>Okay.</v>

842
00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:38.160
<v 1>I don't know what it is.
Uh,
what I,
you know,</v>

843
00:51:38.161 --> 00:51:39.030
I don't even know what the word is.

844
00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:43.990
What does that fucking word when you're just,

845
00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:47.750
you know,
when you just sit in there,
your girl like you,

846
00:51:47.751 --> 00:51:51.190
you take a night off from work and you're sitting there with your girl and she,

847
00:51:51.191 --> 00:51:53.980
you know,
and she,
you know your rent of a video.

848
00:51:53.981 --> 00:51:58.420
Whenever the fuck he do now snap your fingers and it appears in your TV.

849
00:51:58.421 --> 00:52:00.790
I'm so fucking far behind.
I can even use an iPad.
I don't know.

850
00:52:00.791 --> 00:52:03.640
I don't know what your kids do nowadays.
Back in the door,
you went to a day,

851
00:52:03.641 --> 00:52:06.280
you went to a fucking video store,
all right?

852
00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:10.660
And pretended to want to watch a fucking romantic comedy when you really wanted

853
00:52:10.661 --> 00:52:13.840
to walk through those saloon doors and look at the porn off,
right?

854
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:16.000
That fucking feeling when you come home,

855
00:52:16.001 --> 00:52:20.140
when you're sitting there and you've made some food and your girl gets all

856
00:52:20.141 --> 00:52:23.760
excited,
it was like,
it ain't nice.
It's just,
you know,

857
00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:27.760
this does just enjoying each other.
Whatever that fucking feeling is,
that's gay.

858
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:32.260
Okay.
But I don't know what to call that fucking feel.
And to me that's gay.

859
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:33.623
All right.

860
00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:37.150
Now every once in a while I'll look like a fucking chair or a lamp or somebody

861
00:52:37.151 --> 00:52:39.790
asks me to do something and I get that same film like this fucking gay.

862
00:52:39.791 --> 00:52:44.160
I don't want to do it.
It has nothing to do with gay people.
All right?

863
00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.570
So don't get sensitive on me,
sir.
I know you're not.

864
00:52:46.571 --> 00:52:49.520
I know this person is not being a dick.
So anyways,
he says,
uh,

865
00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.700
do you guys think we're all the gay guys and the old stereotypes of Sitcoms,
uh,

866
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:55.750
or in Leno's monologue,
um,

867
00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:00.760
is it because the ladies make you watch dope,
Bruh?
And the view,

868
00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:06.520
the view hags who just love having gay guy girlfriends because they love

869
00:53:06.521 --> 00:53:11.260
emasculating men any frigging way they can.
Oh,
I get this guy,

870
00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.550
this guy's a bear.
He's one of those gay guys.

871
00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:18.190
You know the kind of guy you're hanging out with on the construction site.

872
00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.310
Somebody picks on you,
right?
And this guy comes to your rescue,

873
00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:25.590
fucking turns them all into a pretzel,
you know,
and you're like,
Christ,

874
00:53:25.591 --> 00:53:26.340
that's a fucking

875
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.173
<v 2>guy's guy.</v>

876
00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:30.210
And then all of a sudden he just sits down and there's just something about the

877
00:53:30.211 --> 00:53:33.480
waste crossing his legs.
You're like,
what the fuck is with this dude?
All right.

878
00:53:33.481 --> 00:53:36.810
And then one day he just says,
listen,
I've got something to tell you.

879
00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:42.810
I see what you're saying.
I get it.

880
00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:46.020
That's like me being a German Irish guy and I'm like,

881
00:53:46.021 --> 00:53:48.450
we're not all Nazis and drunks,
but you know,

882
00:53:48.451 --> 00:53:51.640
if you put on the history channel or if you go on and Saint Patrick Patty's day,

883
00:53:51.641 --> 00:53:56.490
you know,
you get your cert,
you're defined by the worst of your group.

884
00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:01.020
Unfortunately.
That's Kinda how it works.
Um,
but no,
I don't,

885
00:54:01.021 --> 00:54:04.780
obviously you don't think people like that I saw will and grace than they are

886
00:54:04.781 --> 00:54:08.490
both ends of the spectrum.
We'll was sort of like,
you know,

887
00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:13.890
just a regular guy.
And then the other guy was just like,

888
00:54:13.891 --> 00:54:16.110
oh my God,
all right.

889
00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:23.510
<v 1>Singing my lines.
No,
I didn't.
I thought that that guy was actually good.
Right?</v>

890
00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:25.970
Why do I answer these fucking questions?
You know,

891
00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:30.200
all it does it just expose how fucking stupid I am.
Um,
so anyways,
he says,

892
00:54:30.201 --> 00:54:34.100
so do you still think after seeing the gay soldiers in the news and the boring

893
00:54:34.101 --> 00:54:38.240
normal gay marriage activist?
Dude,
I don't think that nobody thinks that.

894
00:54:38.241 --> 00:54:40.760
I actually,
some people think that.
No,
I don't think that.
All right.

895
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:45.160
I'm just breaking balls.
They're twinkle toes.
Um,
or the only gay guys.
Why?

896
00:54:45.161 --> 00:54:47.180
Just going to keep reading the rest of this for whatever fucking reason.

897
00:54:47.181 --> 00:54:51.800
Or the only gay guys who have been out to you,
uh,
out to you.

898
00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:54.380
Really just hairdressers and interior decorators.
Sir,

899
00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:56.420
how many examples are you going to give me?

900
00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:03.010
<v 2>All right.
Pop Up,
up,
up,
up.
Okay.
I'm done with that.
No,</v>

901
00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:06.340
I don't think they're all like that.
All right,
so this is what it's like.
Yeah,

902
00:55:06.341 --> 00:55:07.174
I understand that,

903
00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:12.180
that some of you guys look like Mike Ditka add a act like Mike Ditka yet,

904
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.260
you know,
don't like Mike Ditka for the same reasons I did.

905
00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:25.880
<v 1>I understand that sir.
I think a lot more people do understand that.
Um,
you know,</v>

906
00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:28.280
yeah,
there's all kinds of stereotypes out there.
All right.

907
00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:30.620
Look at me for the redheaded male,
you know,

908
00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:33.980
you think I don't want to be a fucking,
you know,

909
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:37.910
start an action movie and be the guy who knows every type of karate and kicked

910
00:55:37.911 --> 00:55:39.320
the shit out of people and shoot the gun.

911
00:55:39.321 --> 00:55:44.240
Do you think they ever going to give that role to a fucking freckled faced
pasty,

912
00:55:44.241 --> 00:55:46.700
redheaded jackass like me?
They're not.

913
00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:48.373
<v 2>All right.</v>

914
00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:51.080
<v 1>Who am I going to be?</v>

915
00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.900
I'm going to be the guy who needs to be rescued or the guy who's good with

916
00:55:53.901 --> 00:55:54.734
computers.

917
00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:59.770
<v 2>All right,
well y'all got to fucking axe to grind,
sir.
All right,</v>

918
00:55:59.771 --> 00:56:03.590
so maybe you were just checking in,
maybe you just making sure,
um,

919
00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:08.200
<v 1>you know,
I didn't even get his joke,
a really gay question.
Like,</v>

920
00:56:08.201 --> 00:56:10.380
I'm going to say that question was getting,
you see what he's doing.

921
00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:13.600
He was like mocking me and showing a sense of humor at the same time.

922
00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:18.430
You see that he was testing my intelligence while flirting.
Um,

923
00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:21.400
I had a gay question last week.
I said,
what do you call a group of gay men?

924
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:23.730
This gay guy says,
evidently they're called giggle.

925
00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:28.920
<v 2>A group of gay men are called a giggle.
No,
they're not.</v>

926
00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:33.210
There's no fucking way.
All Gay guys call a group of gay men giggles.

927
00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:36.210
You know who called it douchebags who happened to be gay?

928
00:56:36.211 --> 00:56:37.410
I'm sure that they say that.

929
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:39.400
<v 7>Okay,</v>

930
00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:43.660
<v 2>a giggle,
Beth.
Go fucking blow someone.</v>

931
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:45.783
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

932
00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:52.510
<v 2>Ah,
I swear to God.</v>

933
00:56:52.511 --> 00:56:56.140
If I was ever to have the charisma of a mass murderer,

934
00:56:56.170 --> 00:56:58.540
that's who I would kill Douche bags.

935
00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:01.900
All groups would be allowed to stay around.

936
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:05.530
But you would have to prove to me that you weren't a douchebag.

937
00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:09.700
And if you then who would you make fun of?

938
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:21.270
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>
