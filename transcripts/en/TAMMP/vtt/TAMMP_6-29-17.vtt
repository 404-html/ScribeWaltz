00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.240
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn is time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:08.300
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:13.301
And I am just checking in on you.

4
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.220
Who's that?
Check aid and argue your can't.
Sorry,
I'm in New York.

5
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.550
You know,
all of a sudden you just going to start doing your little Sinatro vibe.

6
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.310
Um,
Joe,
I'm going out and I'm buying a new pair of fucking sneakers today.

7
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.430
Go Away.
Are going to get you do you to get the Jordan five still?

8
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.790
I don't know what I'm going to get.
You know I'm going to,

9
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.860
I'm getting some old man running sneakers.
I need some workout sneakers.

10
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.010
You know I bought the ones that were on better call Saul for the old ladies that

11
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.180
you guys watched the rest of that series.
Did you see it yet?

12
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.290
Can I ruin it for you?

13
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.530
I'm going to tell you in the last episode and the last scene when the guy says,

14
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.480
<v 0>okay,</v>

15
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.790
<v 1>just trying to get all you guys to scamper for your fucking pause buttons.
No,
no,</v>

16
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.683
no,
no.

17
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.120
People literally run out of the room.
People run out of the fucking room.

18
00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:11.330
When you'd start talking about a show,
they haven't seen the last episode yet.

19
00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:13.130
Have they do that?
You know what I mean?

20
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.470
But if you just sit there and you're fucking,
somebody rips a fire,

21
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.340
people just put a fucking shirt over their nose.
Oh,
who did that?

22
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:24.810
You're literally inhaling air from this guy's ass.
You know?

23
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.630
And that doesn't make it leave the room.
But if,
God forbid,

24
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:30.090
somebody brings up the last episode of a fucking show,

25
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:34.080
you haven't seen everybody runs out like the building's on fire.
Yeah.

26
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.730
Um,
it is a perfect,
perfect day in New York City.

27
00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:42.460
The breeze,
dude,
this breeze,

28
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.240
top five breezes ever this breeze.

29
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.030
My top five ever.
That's a very easy thing for,

30
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.640
as you would actually rank his breezes.
Top five reasons ever.

31
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.990
Dude.
I was sitting there,

32
00:01:55.991 --> 00:02:00.040
I had on a pair of Jordan's sexes with the Fucking v Neck with the chain on the

33
00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:04.990
outside over,
over.
Waitress came up to me.
She could barely take my order.

34
00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:07.570
She couldn't,
she couldn't even like she was taking in.

35
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.190
The whole thing was ridiculous.
New Para guests,
jeans over.

36
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.270
Ah,
fuck.
Anyways.
Um,
yeah.

37
00:02:22.271 --> 00:02:24.490
So I'm up in fucking Porchester.

38
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.720
I don't know what Port Chester is.
They know Westchester.

39
00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:31.270
There's east Chester and Alva dentally.
There's port Chester,

40
00:02:31.271 --> 00:02:34.570
which I believe is just Connecticut.
I'm there tonight,

41
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.820
I'm there tomorrow and then I'm there on Saturday.

42
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:41.170
<v 0>Okay.</v>

43
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.320
<v 1>And then I'm done and I'm back.
And uh,
I'll tell you right now,</v>

44
00:02:44.321 --> 00:02:49.321
you have not experienced loneliness till you have a fucking kid and then you

45
00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:52.140
leave my favorite part of the fucking days when my kid wakes up.

46
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.120
You know what I mean?
Cause like they're super fucking rested and they just,

47
00:02:57.121 --> 00:03:01.900
you know,
life hasn't beaten down yet.
They don't have any credit card debt.

48
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.800
Then they'll get some psycho blowing up their phone.
They don't have this shit.

49
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:10.180
They got to do some fucking receipt.
They have to find,
they got,

50
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.390
they got nothing.
They,
the look of contentment on her face.

51
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.850
You know when you go down,
when you go to give her a kiss,

52
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:18.280
like she lifts all of her limbs come up

53
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.020
like a baby's ability to do leg lifts.

54
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.250
I don't know how the fuck if I tried to do what she did,
just straight up,

55
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.690
just lift some write up.

56
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.060
I don't get it set.
Ted's suck in their toes.

57
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.640
Evidently I was that flexible at one point.

58
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.330
Tell you that a couple of million miles in the back of the fucking plane.

59
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:42.000
That'll,
that'll take the infant radar.
You,

60
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.180
that'll take this Flaco right out of your eye.
Um,

61
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.730
that's what I missed the most,

62
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:56.590
so that I will always face time with my lovely lady and um,

63
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.300
as the best.
It's the best,
but it sucks and I'm on the road,

64
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:06.040
but I just started here being like,
you know what?
I'm earning money someday.

65
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.970
So when she has to go to private fucking,
uh,

66
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.890
kindergarten for 90 grand a year or whatever the hell it costs because evidently

67
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:17.410
she goes to a public school,
she's going to get stabbed.

68
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.480
You know what happened?
What happened to the public schools?

69
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:26.620
Was that the computers?
Is that what it was?
Everybody had to have a tablet,

70
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.000
a laptop,
some sort of interface.
Is that what happened?

71
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:33.400
And went right through the fighting and all of a sudden we couldn't keep up with

72
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:33.761
China.

73
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:38.440
How to fuck his China beaten us the overhead of a fucking billion people alone.

74
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:39.820
I mean,
we should be like,

75
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:43.960
we should get everything at a 60% discount over here as far as educating our own

76
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:46.780
people.
Does it make any sense?

77
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.780
Does any of it make any fucking sense?

78
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:53.710
Does it make any sense how so many people are fucking struggling out there and

79
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:58.711
they just keep building these luxury apartments and he's fucking giant goddamn

80
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.490
houses.
Oh,
right.
And they,
oh yeah,

81
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:05.860
it's money from Russia.
It's Ronnie from China.

82
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.730
It's oil money from the Middle East.
Now listen,

83
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:11.320
I don't know what to do about China.

84
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:14.440
I don't know what to do about Russia and I don't know what to do about the

85
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.441
Middle East.

86
00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:18.250
But that's not going to stop me from telling you what to do about all these

87
00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:21.520
things I just ate.
Why is my stomach grumbling?
Um,

88
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.890
he says,
all you gotta do for the Middle East.
Okay.
All we do is we just,

89
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.060
you're fucking,
you embrace solar power.

90
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.530
That's it.
How do we do that?
How do we do that with the oil companies?

91
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:38.590
If somebody fucking,
it will be,
if we actually went into solar direction,

92
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.340
wouldn't a bunch of planes start crashing that had the leaders of the solar

93
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:44.740
movement on them?
Yes.
That would definitely happen.

94
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.790
They would definitely take them out.
So what do you do?
This is what you do.

95
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.590
You give the son to the oil people.
Okay,

96
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:58.300
you draw up a contract and you say the sun is yours.
All right.

97
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.790
Now what are they going to do with the site?
They can't put it out.

98
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.640
They can't touch it.
It'll burn their fucking hands,

99
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.900
but they just make the money off the fucking,
uh,
the solar power.

100
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.920
Okay.
And if they could just somehow handle that,

101
00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:14.590
those people in the Middle East to sitting on a bunch of Goop,

102
00:06:14.591 --> 00:06:18.070
that they can make money off of it or they could just seamlessly fucking walk

103
00:06:18.071 --> 00:06:21.190
away from that Shit.
If I was president,

104
00:06:21.191 --> 00:06:25.270
I would literally give oil companies federal fucking grants to fucking get the

105
00:06:25.271 --> 00:06:29.260
solar thing going.
You guys own the sun.

106
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.310
I would just keep walking.

107
00:06:30.311 --> 00:06:35.290
But you own the sun and they'd be sitting above 4.0 poker stuff for this stuff

108
00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:38.650
with a middle way stove,
dude.
Fuck that stuff.

109
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.113
<v 0>All right?</v>

110
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.100
<v 1>You want that stuff?
Is that,
that stuff's like a,
the dub took an Atari.</v>

111
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.660
It's like the Reebok pump.
Nobody gives a shit.
Okay?

112
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:53.890
This is the new shit.

113
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.730
This is the new shit we're giving you the fucking son,

114
00:07:00.431 --> 00:07:01.264
son.

115
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.310
You understand that you all own the center of the solar system,

116
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.340
<v 0>all right?</v>

117
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.380
<v 1>And every fucking little bit a heat that comes off that thing that trickles down</v>

118
00:07:14.381 --> 00:07:17.860
on a mic.
Freckled ball.
Goddamn head.
You own,

119
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.600
you put a fucking meter right on my back.
I don't give a shit,
okay?

120
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.180
And I know what you guys are thinking.
Ah,
built.

121
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.420
This doesn't make any fucking sense.
I don't give a shit.
Let's listen to me.

122
00:07:28.421 --> 00:07:32.010
Hear me up.
You give these people the sun,

123
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:38.120
you give him the Goddamn son.
All right?
And then what?

124
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.470
What happens over in the Middle East,
this sitting on all of this fucking goop,

125
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.260
alright.
And all of a sudden it's not worth,
it's not worth diddly squat,

126
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.970
okay?
And all of a sudden the fucking,
the bill start piling up.

127
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.170
They don't know what to do.
They start selling their properties over here.

128
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.750
They want to give money to the terrorist groups saying,
oh,

129
00:07:59.751 --> 00:08:01.160
cut the money to do it.

130
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.590
You have fucking bleed them dry.
Then that's it.

131
00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:10.100
And then they go back to doing whatever the fuck they want to do over there.

132
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.580
God forbid they live their lives they way they want to live it over there.

133
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:14.653
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

134
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:21.160
<v 1>God forbid they're not into Jesus and Starbucks,
God for fucking bid.</v>

135
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.940
They want to walk around and some clothes that are actually functional for the

136
00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:28.720
part of the world they live in.
You just leave them the fuck alone.

137
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.650
And then all they gotta do is just keep driving around in cars and all of that

138
00:08:32.651 --> 00:08:35.200
shit.
So they,
you know,
they'll make a lot less money,

139
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.470
but they won't have us over there going at,

140
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.620
you should do this and you should do that.
We just get the fuck out of there.

141
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.630
And then we're over here,
solar powered everything

142
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:48.423
<v 0>right.</v>

143
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.530
<v 1>Just think about everything you think about your shirt,
solar powered,
everything.</v>

144
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:56.590
Everything fucking solar powered.
Know what you thinking?
Well Bill,

145
00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.610
what happens at night?
You'd go to bed.

146
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.710
What do people do in Alaska during the winter?

147
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.690
We got to get out.
We got again,

148
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.420
I a bad place.

149
00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.350
If it's the last thing we ever do,

150
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.300
it's bankrupting us.
It's making it very few people at ton of fucking body.

151
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.060
It is bankrupting us.
We're not going to see,
cannot solve

152
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.300
that shit.
Okay.

153
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:30.370
<v 0>Okay,</v>

154
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.880
<v 1>so now that we know you can't solve it because I said you can't solve it without</v>

155
00:09:33.881 --> 00:09:34.810
doing any research.

156
00:09:34.811 --> 00:09:37.900
Now that now that I've established that as a fact on my own podcast,

157
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.950
the only thing,
other reason to be over there is this sitting on all that goop,

158
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.060
but now we don't need the group,
the group,
the group,
the group is on fire.

159
00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.270
We don't give a fuck.
Keep it.
Right.

160
00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.890
You give the son to the oil companies.

161
00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:00.040
That's it.
Just go total solar power.
You know Jimmy Carter,

162
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.520
that Georgia peanut farmer,
he said it 40 years ago.
He said,

163
00:10:03.521 --> 00:10:07.000
we are addicted to oil.
We've had.
We just kept going and going and going,

164
00:10:07.001 --> 00:10:10.330
and now look at us now.
Look at us now.

165
00:10:10.331 --> 00:10:12.670
Look at US spending all this fucking money over there.

166
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.790
They're giving it to the concept of shooting shit at us,
right?

167
00:10:15.791 --> 00:10:17.140
And then when shooting back at them,

168
00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:20.800
they're making all this money and then they come over and they buy a 50 fucking

169
00:10:20.801 --> 00:10:25.260
thousand square foot house overlooking our shit.
Overlook.

170
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.810
Look in RJ.
Hey,
we overlook you

171
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.120
were up on the hill,
not the other way around.

172
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.013
<v 0>Huh?</v>

173
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.180
<v 1>You give them the sun.</v>

174
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.260
<v 0>Okay.</v>

175
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.050
<v 1>Oh God,
you guys,
I'm telling you,
I would have to,</v>

176
00:10:43.051 --> 00:10:44.850
I would fucking sell those oil guys.

177
00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:48.420
I would have a meeting under a mountain or wherever the fuck do you meet with

178
00:10:48.421 --> 00:10:51.500
these fucking people that really run shit.
You know,

179
00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:52.500
you're underneath the mountain.

180
00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:56.520
You got this fucking underwater waterfalls and shit.
Right?

181
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.220
There's like these planet of the apes plucking things,

182
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:01.660
walking or whatever the fuck goes on underneath that thing.
Right?

183
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.620
And you just tell him,
I miss that shit.
Why would I can't,

184
00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:10.620
I can't do a waterfall and my fucking the dude from police academy,

185
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.700
I can't do that.
Sound effects?

186
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.713
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

187
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.410
<v 1>Gentlemen.
I came here.
I came underneath this mountain tonight.</v>

188
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.193
<v 0>Okay.</v>

189
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:24.400
<v 1>To keep you the son.
I'm sorry.
I don't have my proper recording equipment here.</v>

190
00:11:24.401 --> 00:11:27.440
I can't,
I can't do my illuminati media.
You give him the fuck him.
The fucking

191
00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:36.250
give them the fucking the ball.
Ball Ball,

192
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.130
ball ball.
That's what I would do.

193
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.230
Instead of going over there talking about evil doors and doors are evil and

194
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.970
fucking this,
that and the other.
Yep.

195
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:48.750
Pack the whole fucking Shit Up.

196
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:55.490
That's it.
You pack it all up.
Sent over 10 cargo planes.

197
00:11:55.491 --> 00:11:59.840
You bring the men and women at the allied forces.
You bring them home,

198
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.153
<v 0>right?</v>

199
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.190
<v 1>You say you can keep your Google,</v>

200
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.140
you can keep you say,

201
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:14.820
but I want some of those cool clothes.
I like the clothes they wear over there.

202
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.200
The Jane Open ended one,
Z,
whatever the fuck you call it.

203
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.320
I think those things are cool,
man.
I wish I want,
I want one of those.

204
00:12:22.321 --> 00:12:24.660
Can I buy one of those without offending Muslims?

205
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.560
Could I talk my way out of a beheading if I put one of those on,
just went,

206
00:12:29.561 --> 00:12:33.240
look man,
I'm a chef.
I'm a red head.
It was hot out.
I look,
I look on I,

207
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:38.680
what am I supposed to do
when they get my face?

208
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:43.300
You'll blow away.
Um,
that's it.

209
00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:46.720
That's all I wanted to say today.
Give the oil companies this son,

210
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.260
you'd give it to them and then the whole fucking thing is over.

211
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.433
<v 0>Whatever.</v>

212
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.580
<v 1>I believe I can fly.
Um,</v>

213
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.690
so I got to get here tonight and I'm going to go,
well,

214
00:13:01.691 --> 00:13:04.540
I'm going to go play some drums,
is a little rehearsal studio down the street.

215
00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:07.180
I'm going to go play my fucking drums for a couple hours.

216
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.840
I was going to go ride around on one of those fucking Citibank fucking banker

217
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.530
bicycles,
but there's never any,
they got like 14 for the whole city.

218
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.860
And then also what kind of an asshole rides a bicycle in a city.

219
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.870
You know what I mean?
What am I in Europe?
How many people die a year in Europe?

220
00:13:22.871 --> 00:13:25.390
Just riding around on bicycles in a fucking city.

221
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.880
So it's fucking cars go by Wa wa we fucking get another ambulance going over to

222
00:13:33.861 --> 00:13:34.930
pick up some fucking,
okay.

223
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:36.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

224
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.830
<v 1>Six foot,
three inch,</v>

225
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:42.270
fucking 110 pound European that you could take it out on his bicycle that has a

226
00:13:42.271 --> 00:13:43.310
basket on the front.

227
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.053
<v 0>MMM.</v>

228
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.640
<v 1>I liked riding bicycles.
Oh,
you know what?</v>

229
00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:52.150
I watched this documentary called ovarian psychosis.

230
00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.510
Right?
How do you not click on that?

231
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.560
I first clicked on this action movie and it was just the same fucking shit.

232
00:13:59.561 --> 00:14:01.660
The one guy who beats the fuck out of everybody.

233
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.990
Nobody ever think they all have guns,
but they never think to use it.

234
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.470
And I was just like,
I've seen this a million times.
It's really loud.

235
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.190
And look at that nice classic car.
They're racking the fucking thing.

236
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.170
I can't watch the ship.

237
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:18.940
So I shut it off and I saw this thing called a variant psychosis and I was like,

238
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.780
I want,
I want,
I got work.
I see what this is about.
It was about some,
uh,

239
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.760
some women in east La,

240
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.820
mainly Mexican who are sick of fucking being scared women and they started their

241
00:14:29.831 --> 00:14:34.600
own group when they ride around these women's only,
uh,
you know,

242
00:14:34.601 --> 00:14:38.380
riding bicycles when there's like a full moon or some shit.
I Dunno.

243
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:43.170
I Dunno.
So I was watching this stuff and of course typical guys look goodwill,

244
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.690
women's,
all we go,
so

245
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.680
does all the bud,
right.

246
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:53.650
I hate when people act like it's a level playing field,

247
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:56.050
you know what I mean?

248
00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:01.400
It's like they're having this thing because it's not a level playing field.

249
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.020
One of the women in there was just like,

250
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:05.340
everything's kind of full fucking men only.
What's your,

251
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.190
it really is when you really look at it.
Okay.

252
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.480
I don't want him to fucking come off as like a complete God damn liberal here.

253
00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:14.160
All right.
But you know,
it really is,
it's,
it's just,

254
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.550
it's there for the taking for you.
When you're a guy,
you know,

255
00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.050
not saying you're going to get it.

256
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:19.960
<v 0>Okay.</v>

257
00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.890
<v 1>Nine out of 10 people still fail.
That's one thing that feminists don't realize.</v>

258
00:15:23.891 --> 00:15:24.101
You know,

259
00:15:24.101 --> 00:15:26.590
when you listen to them talking about what it's like to be a guy that had this

260
00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:30.730
cartoonish idea of what it's like to be a guy who just show up.
Oh.

261
00:15:30.731 --> 00:15:35.620
And the classic one,
the more you act like a Dick,
the more people respect you.

262
00:15:35.621 --> 00:15:39.160
I love that one.
If a women of a woman does it,
she's considered a bitch.

263
00:15:39.161 --> 00:15:41.230
If a guy does it,
it's like,

264
00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:43.730
<v 0>yeah,</v>

265
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:47.090
<v 1>Tempe ever done a survey,
just asked the general public,
Hey,</v>

266
00:15:47.091 --> 00:15:51.080
if you had your choice between working for somebody nice or working for a

267
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:54.530
complete fucking asshole who treats you like shit,
which would you pick?

268
00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.080
Yeah,
nobody does.
I think the,
when I meet successful people,

269
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:03.740
truly successful people that get it

270
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:10.250
successful in there,
personal life and in their professional life,

271
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:14.300
those people,
I always meet,
their always humble.
There's self deprecating.

272
00:16:14.301 --> 00:16:19.190
They walk into a room,
you want to be around him and they,
they,

273
00:16:19.191 --> 00:16:21.030
they're good at talking to people.

274
00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:25.440
They don't come in like fucking Alec Baldwin in Glengarry Glen Ross.

275
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:31.410
Um,
that bullshit that men respect a gay,
like they fucking record of fucking,
no,

276
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.810
I don't,
I don't respect anybody.

277
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:37.260
Like what I see is an insecure asshole who's afraid it's all going to go away by

278
00:16:37.261 --> 00:16:41.990
the African.
Um,
anyway,
so I'm watching this documentary,

279
00:16:41.991 --> 00:16:43.310
check it out.
It's actually really,

280
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.550
you're only gonna get bothered me about the documentary is the way they spelled

281
00:16:46.551 --> 00:16:49.690
psychosis,
ovarian psychos.
It's like,

282
00:16:49.691 --> 00:16:53.830
but you're on cycles.
So why didn't you spell the first half?

283
00:16:53.831 --> 00:16:58.780
Like cycle and the rest like psycho,
you know,
a little wordplay there.

284
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.760
Nothing.
All right.
Anyways,
so I watched it.

285
00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.240
It was interesting and actually it's this one woman said in it,
you know,

286
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.840
cause she'd been through all this shit when she was,
uh,

287
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.690
a little girl with their mother and then she had a daughter,

288
00:17:13.691 --> 00:17:17.140
I believe she was at least she had a kid.
She became a mom.

289
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:22.420
And then her mother said,
well,
now do you at least understand me?

290
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.080
I bet you understand me a lot more.
And she said to her mother,
no,

291
00:17:26.081 --> 00:17:29.560
actually I've never understood you less.

292
00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.670
And actually cringed when I,
when I saw that.
And I was just like,
you know,

293
00:17:33.671 --> 00:17:36.130
that's something,
if you feel it,
you don't say to your mom

294
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.030
like,
what do you get out of saying that to you mother?

295
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:47.030
All you're going to do is devastator and make her feel like she completely

296
00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:50.020
failed as a mom and it

297
00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.180
<v 0>doesn't get you any real estate.
That's something you say to your friend.
Yeah.</v>

298
00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.260
<v 1>And now that I have a kid,
it's just like,</v>

299
00:17:56.261 --> 00:17:57.970
I don't even understand what the fuck my mother did to me.

300
00:17:57.971 --> 00:18:01.360
Even more than you fucking clunky wine coolers and then that's it.

301
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.920
You don't say it to your mind.
We're checking.

302
00:18:05.921 --> 00:18:08.640
Call us.
Um,

303
00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:14.700
I just watched the Schick hydro transformer ad that made those dollar shave club

304
00:18:15.311 --> 00:18:17.080
ads make even more fucking sense.

305
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.340
The blade literally turned into one of those fucking robots.

306
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.080
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

307
00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.150
<v 1>Why is [inaudible] wagging his finger at me?</v>

308
00:18:25.151 --> 00:18:29.320
Like he just blocked a shot in a mobile one commercial.
Is he out of NBA Money?

309
00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.300
Where the fuck did he come from?
I don't know.

310
00:18:31.301 --> 00:18:36.150
Where did he buy one too many fucking gold chains and some shit and he's like

311
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.880
called up his agent or I need to work again.
Was that Schwartzenegger?

312
00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:43.850
I don't know.
I don't have no idea.
Um,

313
00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.430
I don't have my ads.
I'll have to read the ad at the end of this fucking thing.

314
00:18:49.431 --> 00:18:52.520
Whenever that,
whenever the fuck that thing comes in,
I have no idea.
Oh,

315
00:18:52.521 --> 00:18:54.830
by the way,
I forgot to bring this up.

316
00:18:54.831 --> 00:18:57.740
Season three of f is for family is going to happen.

317
00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:00.020
Thank you so much to everybody who watched,

318
00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:05.150
we are now I'm breaking stories for season three.

319
00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:09.890
It's animation.
So season three or to come out somewhere in late 2019.

320
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.880
Now we're hoping that we can have it come out.
You know,

321
00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:18.110
we came out May 30th of uh,
this year.

322
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.130
So that's when I'm personally,
that's what I'm shooting for now.

323
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.990
I haven't communicated that to anybody I've worked,
I'm working with.

324
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.460
I'm just assuming that they already know that and,
and if it doesn't happen,

325
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:31.520
I will just get quiet for no reason around them.

326
00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.450
That's the way I was taught to communicate with others while growing up.

327
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:37.940
Do all the math in your head.

328
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:41.630
Do not communicate it to anybody and when they don't see it,
the way you see it,

329
00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.770
you just stopped talking to people.
That was the way it was done.

330
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.400
And then you just don't talk to him for like three days.
And then,

331
00:19:49.401 --> 00:19:50.630
then when they finally like,

332
00:19:50.631 --> 00:19:53.520
well I guess I'm not going to fucking talk to you again.
You then out of nowhere,

333
00:19:53.521 --> 00:19:57.560
it bring up whatever game happened last night and you start talking about it

334
00:19:57.561 --> 00:19:59.720
like the last three days.
Never fucking happened.

335
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.500
That's the way it was done

336
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.090
when I was growing up.
Um,
hey,

337
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:12.080
one of these days I'm actually going to fly up to port Chester and helicopter.

338
00:20:12.081 --> 00:20:14.250
I'm trying to convince this guy to put dual controls on.

339
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.350
It's the whole fucking purpose of me going right.

340
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.750
Fly over the George Washington bridge.
I just want to see how you,
uh,

341
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:26.770
transition through all this fucking commercial airspace where you have JFK,

342
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.780
you have LaGuardia and you have new work.

343
00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.370
But I see helicopters all the time going up and down the Hudson Bay.

344
00:20:34.371 --> 00:20:38.030
So there's gotta be some corridor that they're allowed to fly.

345
00:20:38.031 --> 00:20:41.540
Like probably I would guess no higher than like,

346
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.750
I dunno,
they fly it really fucking low,

347
00:20:44.751 --> 00:20:46.330
but I never know if it's like sightseeing,

348
00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:50.710
but I wouldn't think you'd be any higher than a thousand feet
and he just Kinda,

349
00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.970
you know,
and then just look out for Sally when he comes to landed

350
00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.980
in the Hudson Bay.
Um,

351
00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:03.020
I do know with lax you either transition along the beach at a below one 50 or

352
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.420
you go along supported a boulevard,
which I never do that one.

353
00:21:06.421 --> 00:21:10.110
That one always scares the shit out of me because you look down and there's a

354
00:21:10.111 --> 00:21:12.450
jumbo jet underneath you.
And I always think like,

355
00:21:12.451 --> 00:21:16.860
what if she aborts is landing and just fucking yanks back on the stick.

356
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:22.070
Then I got this fucking 300 person missile coming right at me and my little

357
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:23.003
[inaudible],

358
00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:25.123
<v 0>you know,</v>

359
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.730
<v 1>you ever see a cheetah running down a baby,
whatever.</v>

360
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.760
That's what it would be like accepted,
see aviation version of that.

361
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:36.460
And I would be the baby gazelle,
not even a gazelle.

362
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.660
A baby turtle.
How slow is a baby turtle?

363
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.590
Is there anything sadder than watching that documentary?

364
00:21:43.591 --> 00:21:46.800
When those baby turtles try to make it to the ocean and all those fucking

365
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.710
seagulls come down and pick off nine out of 10 of them.

366
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.930
I fucking love turtles.
I had a pet turtle when I was a kid

367
00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.000
<v 0>and um,</v>

368
00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:03.310
<v 1>used to feed it like dead grass hoppers and shit.
I love this fucking thing.</v>

369
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.540
I love cleaning the tank,

370
00:22:04.541 --> 00:22:08.020
making sure its shell stayed fucking wet and all that so it wouldn't crack.

371
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:13.900
And uh,
had my little tank set it up.
I fucking love this thing.

372
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.120
I love watching it coming up for air and all that shit.

373
00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:19.570
So one time I went to church because that's what I used to do every Sunday.

374
00:22:19.571 --> 00:22:21.890
Right.
So I went to church with my feet and we baggies.

375
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:27.790
So we go to church and uh,
I came home

376
00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:29.503
<v 0>okay.</v>

377
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:33.150
<v 1>And the turtle was the way I positioned the rock.
The turtle</v>

378
00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:38.860
had gone head first into the water and it's turtle ass was out of the water.

379
00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:40.250
<v 0>Okay.</v>

380
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:45.200
<v 1>I went over and I picked it up and its head was sunk all the way back.</v>

381
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:51.730
Intuit's like Shell and its eyes would close and his mouth was open and it

382
00:22:51.731 --> 00:22:52.564
wasn't moving.

383
00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:53.730
<v 0>Okay.</v>

384
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.580
<v 1>And I was like,
oh fuck,
it's a dead.
Did it drown?</v>

385
00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:01.020
And I went downstairs and I said,
dad,
it's my turtle dead.
He goes,
yeah,
he's gone.

386
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:07.020
And I was fucking devastated.

387
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.800
So I took them rather take a brown,

388
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:11.610
<v 0>okay,</v>

389
00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.490
<v 1>you know you put your lunch in the Brown,
like lunch bags,</v>

390
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:15.750
put the turtle in there.

391
00:23:15.751 --> 00:23:19.350
And then I went out in the woods and dug it a little grave and put the marker up

392
00:23:19.351 --> 00:23:23.010
and then that was it.
And then my dad was like,
well,
we'll get you another one,

393
00:23:23.011 --> 00:23:26.610
we'll get you another one.
I was like,
no,
I don't deserve it.
I blame the turtles.

394
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.950
I,
it was my fault.
I set up the fucking

395
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.830
the rocks wrong.
And that was just said,
sag.
I'm saying,
that's it.
That's it.

396
00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:34.620
I'm done.

397
00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.600
<v 0>You know I've done,</v>

398
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.630
<v 1>I'm not going to kill another fucking turtle.
And it was so weird,</v>

399
00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.570
like four days later we were driving down the street and it was a turtle

400
00:23:43.571 --> 00:23:46.560
crossing the street.
This is when there was actually animals,
you know,

401
00:23:46.561 --> 00:23:48.570
before we fucking killed and ate all of them.
You know,

402
00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.390
I blamed the food network for that,
you know,

403
00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:54.480
and all these fucking assholes going around eating bizarre foods.

404
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:55.950
<v 0>Okay,</v>

405
00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.240
<v 1>I'm in Timbuktu,</v>

406
00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:00.170
Wheaton maggots right now all of a sudden everybody's gotta eat maggots to

407
00:24:00.171 --> 00:24:01.320
servant grasshoppers.

408
00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:06.030
It fucking Marriner games or whatever the hell they doing up there.
Um,

409
00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:10.760
this is America.
We don't eat grasshoppers.
Well,
you Doritos,

410
00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:12.690
Taco Bell.

411
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:15.463
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

412
00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:17.470
<v 1>You give them the sun.
Everybody.</v>

413
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.160
I'm telling you that would turn this country around.
Turn this country Rao.

414
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:26.470
Just give him a son.
That's it.
So anyways,

415
00:24:26.471 --> 00:24:29.620
I flew the other day on a,
on Tuesday,

416
00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.970
I hadn't flown like a month and I flew like a fucking champ to the point.

417
00:24:33.971 --> 00:24:38.470
I actually got a God damn compliment from my instructor.

418
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.520
A unsolicited said,
you're flying great today.

419
00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:45.490
Made me feel really good.
Okay,
I've done my auto rotations.

420
00:24:45.491 --> 00:24:49.410
I'm ready to get back out there and solo.
So there's a flight I want to do.

421
00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:54.700
I want to fly up to San fucking Barbara Solo.

422
00:24:54.701 --> 00:24:57.100
So that's what I'm working towards and um,

423
00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:01.360
I'm really looking forward to it and been flying a lot in the valley and

424
00:25:01.361 --> 00:25:05.980
everything,
getting to know all of that stuff.
Um,
it's so fucking cool.

425
00:25:05.981 --> 00:25:07.900
Yesterday we were actually going to two days ago,

426
00:25:07.901 --> 00:25:12.070
we're going to try to fly over to Santa Monica airport cause I know that they're

427
00:25:12.071 --> 00:25:14.800
going to,
they are allegedly closing it in five years.

428
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.920
We'll see what the fuck happens.
So I was like,
well I never landed there.

429
00:25:17.921 --> 00:25:20.380
I might as well go over there and check that place out.
But what we wanted to do,

430
00:25:20.381 --> 00:25:22.390
like pad work,
they don't like to do that over there.

431
00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.310
Noise abatement's and all that.

432
00:25:24.311 --> 00:25:26.440
They don't want some helicopter flying around and all that shit.

433
00:25:26.441 --> 00:25:27.610
So we just said fuck it.

434
00:25:27.611 --> 00:25:31.360
We flew up along the coast from it by the Pacific Palisades.

435
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:32.410
And you just sit in there and look,

436
00:25:32.411 --> 00:25:35.770
and that's what this the whole give him the son Shit came from,
I looked,
I said,

437
00:25:35.771 --> 00:25:37.750
look at that fucking house they're building.

438
00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.410
This house was the size of this house.

439
00:25:41.411 --> 00:25:43.300
I looked at it and I said to the instructor,
go,

440
00:25:43.301 --> 00:25:47.410
that looks like if they're building a fucking mall that I would never go into

441
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.320
going like that's going to be too crowded.
And it was somebody's house.

442
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:55.590
It was going to cost half a fucking billion dollars and there was some prince of

443
00:25:56.081 --> 00:26:01.050
some fucking country in the Middle East,
you know,

444
00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:05.520
was going to move.
That's like his fucking house on the other side of the world.

445
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.810
That's his cottage.
And that right there,
I was just like,

446
00:26:09.811 --> 00:26:12.030
how much fucking money we give it to these people.

447
00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.540
It's time to give the old companies to son.
That's,
that's all you do.

448
00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.790
So there's still in control of everything.
You know,

449
00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:26.220
they could give us empty threats,
well shot off,
you know,
like they could do it.

450
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.910
Um,
so anyways,

451
00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.460
we're flying over there and I'm just looking at all these fucking houses and I

452
00:26:32.461 --> 00:26:36.960
looked down,
I see this one,
it was fucking beautiful house.
I got Jesus Christ.

453
00:26:36.961 --> 00:26:38.100
Look at that one.
They have like these,

454
00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.520
this glass where you couldn't see it at all.
Like ceiling.

455
00:26:41.521 --> 00:26:43.800
The floors is fucking look like a goddamn yet.

456
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:47.920
But it was a house and uh,
and all those guys,

457
00:26:47.921 --> 00:26:49.990
they was give tours so they know all the celebrities.
He's like,
oh,

458
00:26:49.991 --> 00:26:52.090
that's so and so's fucking house.
And I was like,
wow,

459
00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:55.090
that's what 20 million a movie gives you.

460
00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.360
And I'm not going to say the guy's name because he probably has enough fucking

461
00:26:58.361 --> 00:27:01.900
people looking at his house.
Although recently they said that he sold it.

462
00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:03.970
So I have no fucking idea.
But anyways.

463
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:06.343
<v 0>MMM.</v>

464
00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.810
<v 1>I had a great time.
I did have a great time.</v>

465
00:27:08.811 --> 00:27:11.410
The only thing it was whenever I land off airport,
I all,

466
00:27:11.411 --> 00:27:15.230
all the fucking shit that I know to do the downwind checks,

467
00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.510
you know,
all of that.
I forget to do all of it.
That's the only part I fucked up.

468
00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.020
So we're doing like this pinnacle landing and I,
you know,

469
00:27:24.021 --> 00:27:27.830
you set up downwind base and then go final and I fucking,

470
00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:32.780
you know,
I was coming in for landing,
I was still doing like 65 knots.

471
00:27:32.781 --> 00:27:36.290
Like I'm supposed to be down to like 30,
you know,
slowing down and shit.

472
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.570
Guys going right,
you're going a little fast.

473
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.710
I want to do some s turns here.
But anyways,
I am a,
yeah,

474
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:48.180
very excited to do that type of shit.
And a,

475
00:27:48.181 --> 00:27:51.200
this is the time when I would usually read some advertising there,

476
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:55.410
but I don't have any,
what else can I talk about here?
Let's look it up.

477
00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.430
I have to hum my password.
I say can't,
you know,

478
00:27:59.431 --> 00:28:02.040
I got in here late and I watched the little at the end of the fucking Yankee

479
00:28:02.041 --> 00:28:06.270
scheme,
the BB bombers over there fucking kicking the shit out of everybody.

480
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.640
Um,
oh,
you know,

481
00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:12.170
I love about my building here in New York is we have rooftop access and to,

482
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:19.770
I feel like that's part of,
uh,
the New York spirit.

483
00:28:19.771 --> 00:28:21.290
She gotta be up on a fucking roof.

484
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.630
The only thing that sucks is you can't smoke up there.
You know?

485
00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:28.520
They just have like chairs.
I don't even think he can smoke.
I just said smoke.

486
00:28:28.521 --> 00:28:29.810
I don't think you can eat.
You know what I mean?

487
00:28:29.811 --> 00:28:33.740
I think you just can go up there and like read books.
It's like,
what the fuck?

488
00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.353
You know what I mean?

489
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:39.680
It's probably camera's up a cane and go up there and bang your bride.

490
00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:44.270
He like this going like,
Huh.
Coiling and he can't do that anymore.

491
00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.630
Back in the day,
back in the 90s when I was there,

492
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:49.520
I got pine sharp on in the background.

493
00:28:49.521 --> 00:28:54.380
Somebody is trying to sell a Maria eliminator.
Yeah,

494
00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.730
it looks like that looks like an Apollo three speed I think.

495
00:28:56.731 --> 00:28:57.770
I don't know if you guys noticed,

496
00:28:57.771 --> 00:29:01.950
but bill on F is for family has a bike like that and it was a bike I always

497
00:29:01.951 --> 00:29:03.300
wanted and my parents were like,

498

499
00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:08.460
we're not going to get you one of those cool chopper looking bikes.

500
00:29:08.461 --> 00:29:13.140
We're going to get you one of the fucking nerdy.
Once you know beach rambler,

501
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:18.330
let's see what the fuck this guy's asks him for.
This the f three eliminator

502
00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.810
eliminate or mark to or what are you going to do?

503
00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:29.220
How much are you going to get through this?

504
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:34.690
<v 0>So what are your concerns court?
Um,

505
00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:40.520

They always fuck him over actually the seat,
uh,</v>

506
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:44.270
some of the metal fleck as you can see,
has a little scratch on it.

507
00:29:44.271 --> 00:29:48.620
So I'm going to give you one 90th of what your asking price was.

508
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:50.463
<v 0>MMM.</v>

509
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:55.800
<v 1>You don't kills me.
Those fucking bikes were like,
I don't know what they do.</v>

510
00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:57.340
Probably 60,
70 bucks,

511
00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:00.670
which is a lot of money back in the day and now they're worth like hundreds and

512
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:04.210
hundreds of pills called inflation.
It's called the Federal Reserve.

513
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.590
Um,
all right.
I just went down the rabbit hole.
All right.
Um,
that is the thing.

514
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.840
I was just checking in and you guys,

515
00:30:10.841 --> 00:30:14.230
I've just given you a couple of laps on your ride home or whatever the fuck it

516
00:30:14.231 --> 00:30:16.210
is that you're doing.
Um,

517
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.720
I guess I'll do the advertising read whenever the fuck I get that and I'll just

518
00:30:19.721 --> 00:30:20.920
splice it on the end of this,

519
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:22.630
which is what you're going to listen to in two seconds.

520
00:30:22.631 --> 00:30:26.310
So I don't know why I just explained it.
All right.
Uh,

557
00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:27.220
the world is mine fountain at the foot of the landing of the fucking two stairs.

558
00:32:27.711 --> 00:32:28.880
One goes up,

561
00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.320

567
00:32:53.551 --> 00:32:57.530

When you're under a mom giving people this shot,

568
00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.260

it can give you the sense.

569
00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:04.110
So when your big day or special event rolls around this spring,

570
00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:07.240
look just as great as you feel.
There's fruit,

571
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:11.460
they feel better when they were like black tops@laptops.com

572
00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.240
<v 3>yeah,</v>

573
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.920
<v 2>with high quality rental suits and Tuxedos delivered to your doorstep.</v>

574
00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:22.010
The black talks gives you a new way to rank what would are free home try on.

575
00:33:22.801 --> 00:33:25.620
You get to see the fit and feel the quality.

576
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:30.640
Assume that your balls roll around the past months before the event before you a

577
00:33:31.271 --> 00:33:33.810
man.
And the best part is it's completely done online.

578
00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:38.550
The Black Tufts Dotcom lets you create your luck or choose from tons of styles.

579
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.320
So that was six elected outfits.

580
00:33:40.321 --> 00:33:43.190
I love you to do this on the Internet someday when you're fucking robot with

581
00:33:43.191 --> 00:33:46.200
placement shows up dressed like James Bond,
like I recognize that.

582
00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:51.390
I recognize that face that it fucking kills you.
It won't be a gentleman robot.

583
00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:56.510
So it's like this usually retail for 1200 bucks today,
but as the black socks,

584
00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:01.540
they started just $95 why would you say 1200 bucks?

585
00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:07.630
Yeah.
They just start at nine five not the $1,200 one
oh Jesus.

586
00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:12.070
If you have any questions or issues,
their
expert customer,

587
00:34:12.071 --> 00:34:15.100
you can see there's your back every step of the way.

588
00:34:15.101 --> 00:34:18.280
After ordering your suit will arrive 14 days before your bet.

589
00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.990
If anything is less than perfect,

590
00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:23.350
the black Tux will send you a free replacement right away.

591
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:27.580
When your event is over,
just drop your rental back in the mail.

592
00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:29.050
Shipping is free both ways.

593
00:34:29.051 --> 00:34:33.850
How easy is that stand out at your event for the right reasons with laptops to

594
00:34:33.851 --> 00:34:38.851
get $20 off your purchase it the black Tux dotcom slash for the Black Tux.

595
00:34:40.691 --> 00:34:44.470
Dotcom slash burn for $20 off of your purchase.

596
00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:50.710
All right,
lift.
Everybody lifts knows that their drivers are what?

597
00:34:50.711 --> 00:34:54.190
Keep them moving so they do everything they can to make sure that the drivers

598
00:34:54.191 --> 00:34:57.190
are in happy on every trip.
Man.

599
00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:01.630
Lyft is the ride sharing company that believes in treating his people better

600
00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:04.780
live.
This is so much shade against Uber.
It's hilarious.

601
00:35:04.781 --> 00:35:07.330
We actually treat our people like people.

602
00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:11.350
Let's believes that being a ride sharing drivers should be fun.

603
00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:15.310
And you're having a good time if you're out of good science or your passengers.

604
00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.110
Well,
I mean within reason,

605
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:23.700
a lift was can think of some scenarios while I was with was the first to offer

606
00:35:25.481 --> 00:35:29.440
in activity.
When you drive for Lyft,
you keep 100% of the tips.

607
00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:32.980
Drivers have been pay over $200 million in tips.

608
00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:34.900
Since the feature was introduced.

609
00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:40.090
Express pay less drivers get paid almost instantly instead of waiting for weeks.

610
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:42.970
Lyft as even taking the guesswork out of pickups,

611
00:35:42.971 --> 00:35:47.971
the new amp device use color coding to help passengers find their drivers.

612
00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:50.410
You can earn hundreds.
That's actually really cool.

613
00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:52.760
I was wondering why they will lit up differently.
Uh,

614
00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.900
you can earn hundreds of dollars a week plus tips on earn more money,

615
00:35:55.901 --> 00:35:59.680
dry forwards.
Never been easier to give yourself a raise.
It's a simple formula.

616
00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:01.690
Appy drivers being happy passengers.

617
00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:05.500
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 Lyft rides in a perfect five star rating.

618
00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:10.530
Go to lift.com/bird today and you can get a $500 new driver bonus.

628
00:38:29.711 --> 00:38:32.980
June 29th,

629
00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:37.320
2009 and that was an MP three by one of my listeners.
Uh,

630
00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:42.190
kind of an old school one,
which I kind of liked.
Uh,
you know,

631
00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.960
little old school,
a little new school,
you know,
still had,

632
00:38:44.961 --> 00:38:49.961
they had the eighties heavy metal radio station sound to it.

633
00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:54.390
And then it also had like that,
the newer sort of a,
what do they call that?

634
00:38:54.391 --> 00:38:56.180
That cookie monster singing where people

635
00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:57.820
<v 5>red,
red,
red,
red,
red row.</v>

636
00:38:58.970 --> 00:38:59.780
<v 2>You know,</v>

637
00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:04.190
I really respect the musicianship of being able to play that fast,

638
00:39:04.191 --> 00:39:08.820
but I have to admit,
I,
maybe I'm too old,
but I just can't listen to some

639
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:10.610
<v 5>guy go,
Rah,
Rah,
Rah,
Rah,
Rah Rah Rah</v>

640
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:15.280
<v 2>without laughing.
Or it just seems ridiculous to me.
But,
uh,</v>

641
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:19.760
but maybe that's me.
I Dunno.
But,
uh,
thank you for the a,

642
00:39:19.761 --> 00:39:21.680
I know those things take a long time to put together,

643
00:39:21.681 --> 00:39:24.530
so I appreciate anybody who does one.
And I actually got a,

644
00:39:24.531 --> 00:39:26.570
I got another one this week was,
so,
uh,

645
00:39:26.571 --> 00:39:30.620
next week there'll be a different intro and if you're new to my podcast,

646
00:39:30.621 --> 00:39:31.910
that's one of the things,
um,

647
00:39:31.911 --> 00:39:35.660
every once in a while one of my listeners will put together an MP three and then

648
00:39:35.661 --> 00:39:40.400
it takes me eight days to figure out how to fucking sink it up and garage band.

649
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:44.900
I just wish I knew a way where I could play it and talk over it like you would

650
00:39:44.901 --> 00:39:46.070
on like a,
a,

651
00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:52.180
a fucking a I guess a radio show if anybody knows how to do that.

652
00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:53.721
You know what?

653
00:39:53.721 --> 00:39:57.470
There was a fucking question I was going to ask you guys some sort of computer

654
00:39:57.471 --> 00:40:01.490
question.
God dammit.
I gotta I gotta write these things down.

655
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:06.080
I really got to write these things down anyways.
I'm still in New York City,

656
00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:09.920
everybody.
I am down to my,
uh,

657
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:14.240
the final week.
I just have one more scene to shoot.

658
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:18.740
I got two lines.
That's all I got left and then,
uh,

659
00:40:18.741 --> 00:40:22.850
then I'm out of the movie and it's been,
uh,
it's been great.

660
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:25.880
It's been a great experience.
And,
uh,

661
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:31.190
but I am going a little bit nuts because I've been away from my life for so

662
00:40:31.191 --> 00:40:33.880
long,
which,
uh,
I dunno.

663
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:36.740
I think a lot of you guys maybe don't get to experience that if you have more of

664
00:40:36.741 --> 00:40:40.910
a real life where you get to just go to work and then come home.
Um,

665
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:44.810
you don't like when you go on vacation,
how it's fun for the first fucking week,

666
00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:48.040
you know,
and everything's cool.
We're going to be,

667
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:49.460
it takes a couple of days to relax,

668
00:40:49.461 --> 00:40:52.370
but then they comes to that point where you get an a vacation where you kind of

669
00:40:52.371 --> 00:40:55.610
ready to go home and you know,
you need to,
you need to,

670
00:40:56.690 --> 00:41:00.530
you just need to sleep in your own bed.
Yeah,
I just want to go home,
you know,

671
00:41:00.531 --> 00:41:03.980
see my dog and fucking,
you know,
put them in a full pull,
put,
you know,

672
00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:07.190
put her in a full Nelson,
maybe give her a couple of jabs to her,

673
00:41:07.191 --> 00:41:11.210
a little doggie nose.
Uh,
yeah,
that's another thing.
If you new to my podcast,

674
00:41:11.211 --> 00:41:15.500
I really love kicking the shit out of my dog.
Um,
it's uh,

675
00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:20.810
I'm kidding.
You know,
now you know what this really is.
This is me,

676
00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:24.110
my inability to say that I miss people in my life.
Okay.

677
00:41:24.111 --> 00:41:28.490
This is my fucking Irish Boston,
you know,

678
00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:32.510
inability to hug right now to say that I actually,
uh,
you know,

679
00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:36.320
maybe miss people in my life.
See,
I have to have an ambiguous right now.

680
00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:41.210
So anyways,
yeah.
So I've been fucking staying here in New York,

681
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:46.580
you know,
going to the same God damn diner every morning.
And uh,

682
00:41:46.581 --> 00:41:50.990
I know this is a really hacky premise and I say that every week as I throw out

683
00:41:50.991 --> 00:41:51.824
hacky shit,

684
00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:56.030
but what is the deal with ordering orange,

685
00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:00.980
orange juice and they charge,
they charge.
I had a small,
they charged me for 50,

686
00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:02.421
you know,

687
00:42:02.421 --> 00:42:05.060
I got a couple of eggs so I thought it was going to come in and about like

688
00:42:05.061 --> 00:42:07.430
fucking uh,
you know,

689
00:42:07.431 --> 00:42:12.431
the $13 range and next thing you know it's like I owed like 25 bucks is cause I

690
00:42:13.521 --> 00:42:17.660
ordered a fucking orange juice.
Is it,
cause everybody loves it.

691
00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.730
You know,
there's no shortage of oranges.
It's,

692
00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:29.030
I dunno,
Jesus Christ,
this podcast socks,
this rate,
this podcast really sucks.

693
00:42:29.031 --> 00:42:32.900
Thank God I had an intro cause I I d I literally just ran out of steam right

694
00:42:32.901 --> 00:42:37.610
there.
You know what is the deal with oranges bill?

695
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:41.960
Huh?
All right,
let's talk about some fucking topical Shit.

696
00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.840
Jeezy you would think that I would bring up some other shit.
Maybe some other,

697
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.890
let's just backtrack with all the crazy shit that's happened this week.

698
00:42:48.891 --> 00:42:53.390
All right.
Bernie Madoff just got a 150 fucking years in jail

699
00:42:55.040 --> 00:43:00.040
for being the piece of shit that he evidently is because the guy got convicted

700
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:04.490
for a,
you know,
that whole Ponzi scheme.
I think that's great.

701
00:43:04.491 --> 00:43:08.240
I totally backed that.
The fact that they gave him the maximum amount.

702
00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.780
I was already getting pissed when his lawyer was like,
well,

703
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:16.910
he's this age now and so he's probably only going to live another 13 years.

704
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:20.600
So we want,
we'd like if he just gave him 12 years,

705
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:26.390
well why should he get out at all?
He's going to live another 13 years.

706
00:43:26.391 --> 00:43:30.920
Well let's give him 14 to make sure he fucking dies in prison.
You know,

707
00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:32.241
I'll tell you,

708
00:43:32.241 --> 00:43:35.390
out of all the fucking things that you can do short of like physically

709
00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.550
assaulting somebody is,
you know,

710
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:42.620
if you steal old people's money,
okay.

711
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.950
And they work their asses off their whole life.
You know,

712
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:49.400
especially some of these rich old people who,
you know,

713
00:43:49.401 --> 00:43:53.570
worked really hard taking advantage of sweatshop labor and you come in there

714
00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:59.330
and no,
I'm just fucking around,
but seriously,
you know what I mean?
Like,

715
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:01.940
and then they ended up having to eat dog food.

716
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:06.980
You took their whole life's work away,
man.
I can't imagine that.
I mean,

717
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:10.010
God bless those old people for not coming down there and just literally killing

718
00:44:10.011 --> 00:44:14.600
the guy.
I would actually contemplate that.
You know,

719
00:44:14.601 --> 00:44:16.610
what kind of jail do you think that they would send to you?

720
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:20.450
Send you two if you would like an 85 year old guy who had worked his whole life,

721
00:44:20.451 --> 00:44:23.780
you get 85 that means you probably fought in at least one war.

722
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:28.640
So you're a veteran.
She already got the like right there.
Everybody's like,

723
00:44:28.641 --> 00:44:32.040
well fuck that.
That guy used to be a marine,
you know,

724
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:37.620
fought for our freedom.
He did the right thing his whole life.

725
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:42.650
Then he got burned by this fucking feathered mullet jackass and then he shot him

726
00:44:43.381 --> 00:44:46.620
in the head.
He actually saved us some fucking,
some tax payer money.

727
00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:48.810
I don't know what kind of jail where they send you to.

728
00:44:48.811 --> 00:44:50.220
They couldn't send you to 11 worthless.

729
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:54.570
It's not like you're fucking fought dogs like Michael Vick.
Right?

730
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.380
So anyways,
that guy got 150 years.
I think that's that.
That's great.

731
00:44:58.381 --> 00:45:02.520
But I don't understand why those other bankers who loaned all of our hard earned

732
00:45:02.521 --> 00:45:06.750
money out to fucking homeless people,
you know,

733
00:45:06.751 --> 00:45:10.410
who then defaulted on loans and then not only do they not go to jail,

734
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.920
they asked for more fucking money that they already print and the print and then

735
00:45:13.921 --> 00:45:18.030
they charged us the interest on it.
Is Anybody,

736
00:45:18.031 --> 00:45:20.100
did anybody out there major in economics?

737
00:45:20.101 --> 00:45:23.790
Can anybody out there explained to me how how we keep printing money with no

738
00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:27.420
gold behind it and catch up isn't like $72 a bottle.

739
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:32.040
Can anybody out there?
Can anybody explain that to me?
You know,

740
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:33.390
and if you listen to this podcast,

741
00:45:33.391 --> 00:45:36.630
you know that's a major pet peeve of mine was when somebody comes up to me and

742
00:45:36.631 --> 00:45:38.910
they tell me that whatever I'm talking about,

743
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.500
they majored in it in college as if that's some sort of fucking uh,

744
00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:49.260
uh,
what is the expression thorn in your crown?
That's not it.

745
00:45:49.261 --> 00:45:52.560
Jewel in your side.
I don't know what the fuck it is.
You know what I mean?

746
00:45:52.561 --> 00:45:56.640
It's like,
dude,
you,
you,
I hate people who go to college and Major and shit.

747
00:45:56.641 --> 00:45:58.410
And then they think that that automatically,

748
00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:02.250
that makes them a fucking expert on the subject.
It's like douchebag.

749
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:06.750
You went there and you read the books that they gave you.
Okay?

750
00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:12.890
The fucking school is aligned with a certain like viewpoint.

751
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.730
And then you read 50 fucking books with the same goddamn viewpoint,

752
00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:23.120
all right there fucking viewpoint,
which is encouraging you to,
to,

753
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:26.970
to go out and pay for a fucking education that's not even worth what they're

754
00:46:26.971 --> 00:46:30.600
charging you.
For you to come out of school,
be 80 a hundred grand in debt.

755
00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:33.030
Somewhere along the line,

756
00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:37.500
the banks give you a fucking credit card with like a $3,000 limit only,

757
00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:40.890
even though you're only making 300 bucks a week at hot topic or whatever the

758
00:46:40.891 --> 00:46:42.230
fuck you're doing.
So they get,

759
00:46:42.231 --> 00:46:46.650
you're buried in that debt and then you're supposed to knock up some broad by 26

760
00:46:46.651 --> 00:46:49.500
28 have a kid and then go buy a fucking house.
She had done,

761
00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:54.180
you're on the wheel to yet 90 you'll fucking done.
All right.

762
00:46:54.181 --> 00:46:57.390
So I don't know what I'm talking about,
but I'm just,
you know what,
I'm sick of.

763
00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:00.000
I just don't like when I make a point and somebody challenges it.

764
00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:05.220
That's what it is.
Especially with the college education.

765
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:09.450
But anyways,
I don't understand why those guys aren't in fucking jail.
So anyways,

766
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:14.460
let's,
let's back up more.
Michael Jackson.
I had no idea how big that guy was.

767
00:47:14.461 --> 00:47:19.200
I forgot.
I don't know if any of the rest of you will like this,
but I literally,

768
00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:23.130
I forgot how famous that guy was.

769
00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:26.280
Why I should say more like how talented he was.

770
00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.940
Because the last,
really,
to be honest with you,

771
00:47:30.941 --> 00:47:32.920
from about 91 92,

772
00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:38.490
the last 1718 years was so not even about his music or his talent.

773
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:43.270
It was all about his plastic surgery.
Those trials he went through,

774
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:47.920
um,
the plastic surgery,
you know,

775
00:47:47.921 --> 00:47:48.880
just all the weird stuff.

776
00:47:48.881 --> 00:47:53.881
And then another thing about him was I really felt that he was kind of like a

777
00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:57.850
comedian who stopped writing a brilliant comedian.
You know,

778
00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:01.330
he just kept wearing those penny loafers and he kept doing that,

779
00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.130
kicking his leg up.
You know,

780
00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:08.200
he does that little knee thing and then the little mime step to the side and he

781
00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:13.390
throws his fucking hand up into the air,
sort of the John Travolta like,

782
00:48:13.391 --> 00:48:18.350
I'm going to disco dance,
but wait a second,
I'm stopping,
you know.
But anyway,

783
00:48:18.351 --> 00:48:22.990
so the guy dies and then uh,
they started showing all his videos on MTV,

784
00:48:22.991 --> 00:48:24.160
if you can fucking believe it.

785
00:48:24.161 --> 00:48:28.750
They actually showed videos on MTV and I came in from shooting the movie had

786
00:48:28.751 --> 00:48:32.710
like five in the morning and I sat there and I watched his videos for like a

787
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:37.540
fucking hour and I,
I remembered once again,
how would a giant,
that guy was,

788
00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.520
I don't know if you guys are old like me,

789
00:48:39.521 --> 00:48:43.120
but for some of you youngsters out there when that thriller video came out,

790
00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:47.530
I can't even explain.
It was,
it was fucking great.
It was ridiculous.

791
00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:51.520
I just wished that you could just watch all the videos that,
that like

792
00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:58.150
had taken place before that video.
Have you ever seen that journey?

793
00:48:58.151 --> 00:49:00.520
One,
that awful journey video where,

794
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:02.860
I mean I'm not really into the music of journey,

795
00:49:02.861 --> 00:49:07.240
but those were all top notch fucking musicians.
All right.

796
00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:11.500
What's his face there?
Uh,
the lead singer,

797
00:49:11.501 --> 00:49:16.000
they're unbelievable voice even though I just didn't like,
and uh,
they had drama.

798
00:49:16.001 --> 00:49:18.080
Steve Smith is like,
he's continued to have,

799
00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:20.860
he's like one of the greatest drummers in the world right now.
Considered that.

800
00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:23.500
But for some reason when they made the video,

801
00:49:23.501 --> 00:49:26.410
you have all these top notch fucking musicians.

802
00:49:26.411 --> 00:49:30.730
For some reason they decided that they should rather than have one of the

803
00:49:30.731 --> 00:49:32.830
greatest drummers in the world drum they,

804
00:49:32.831 --> 00:49:36.820
that he should air drum and that all the guitars should air guitar.

805
00:49:36.821 --> 00:49:41.110
And then the worst thing ever,
they had the keyboardist air keyboard

806
00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:45.310
and then they will all fucking just hunched in together,

807
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:48.250
like sort of just stopping the foot.

808
00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:52.200
It was fucking embarrassing then.
So anyways,

809
00:49:52.201 --> 00:49:57.201
so thriller came out and basically what MTV would do was they actually had a

810
00:49:57.671 --> 00:50:00.160
debut with the video.
That's how fucking huge it was.

811
00:50:00.161 --> 00:50:03.730
I remember they used to do debuts,
but it was just everybody fucking watched it.

812
00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:07.540
And it wasn't just like they debuted it and then it was in the rotation they

813
00:50:07.541 --> 00:50:10.330
like showed it at like whatever,
like three o'clock in the afternoon,

814
00:50:10.331 --> 00:50:13.330
right is the kids came home from school and then they will like we will be

815
00:50:13.331 --> 00:50:18.100
showing it again at six and then you'd go live your little fucking,

816
00:50:18.101 --> 00:50:18.521
you know,

817
00:50:18.521 --> 00:50:23.521
I'm 12 year old life and then you'd come back with fucking five 58 you'd sit

818
00:50:24.551 --> 00:50:29.020
there with your jaw on the floor,
you'd it again.
And then they'd be like,

819
00:50:29.021 --> 00:50:30.580
we're going to show it again at nine.

820
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:34.000
And then once we get off right before you went to,
you've watched it again.

821
00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:37.210
And then the next day everybody go to school.
Do they show it four times?

822
00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:38.440
I saw it five times,

823
00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:42.490
no where you'd have to stay up to three to fucking board like these stupid

824
00:50:42.491 --> 00:50:46.930
arguments.
And they did that full,
I don't feel like a fucking week.

825
00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:50.980
It was unreal.
And I actually watched it.
Uh,
that's the first time I,

826
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:54.130
they actually showed the full length one and I don't think I've seen the full

827
00:50:54.131 --> 00:50:57.610
length version of that since the 80s.
And uh,
I dunno,

828
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:59.860
it was fucking amazing.

829
00:50:59.861 --> 00:51:02.440
And then it's also sad because you're looking at the guy and that's what I was

830
00:51:02.441 --> 00:51:04.930
doing.
I looked at the old videos,
I'm like,
he was a good looking guy.

831
00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:09.700
The fuck did he do or like a,
as you're watching them gradually,
you know,

832
00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:13.620
have operations you just right there.
We should have stopped right there.

833
00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:14.880
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

834
00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.320
<v 2>right,
right there.</v>

835
00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:17.660
<v 3>Okay.</v>

836
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:20.600
<v 2>Stop.
Freeze one,
two,
three red light.</v>

837
00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:25.610
But he just kept fucking going.
And uh,
I dunno,

838
00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:28.970
one of the thing that pissed me off was I was reading in the post,

839
00:51:28.971 --> 00:51:32.870
it was a guy writing for the post saying how he actually was at the second child

840
00:51:32.871 --> 00:51:37.871
molestation trial and was saying how ridiculous it was and how he couldn't even

841
00:51:39.291 --> 00:51:43.160
believe it went to trial.
That the charges were such bullshit.

842
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:45.200
And I just remember thinking going,

843
00:51:45.201 --> 00:51:48.350
where the fuck was that story in the post during that time?

844
00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:54.070
Because I was reading the post because I like the sports page and all they did

845
00:51:54.321 --> 00:51:57.590
was just talk about what,
uh,
you know,
they,
they had him convicted in the paper.

846
00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:01.670
So in my mind,
he was fucking convicted.
I,
I hate when papers do that.

847
00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:03.050
<v 3>Okay.</v>

848
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:07.190
<v 2>Like they go all the way to the left and then when they realize you know that</v>

849
00:52:07.191 --> 00:52:10.790
they can't go to the left anymore,
then they present the fucking right.
You know,

850
00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:13.720
I dunno what the fuck I'm saying that,

851
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:18.350
but all I know is I actually started believing that he was just a really

852
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:22.850
gullible jackass and was kind of wide open to that stuff.
But,
you know,

853
00:52:22.851 --> 00:52:26.150
then this is how this how I'm going to leave it because the guy was acquitted

854
00:52:26.151 --> 00:52:28.430
twice.
I'm going to,
I'm going to

855
00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:32.610
believed that he was innocent,
but this is the deal.

856
00:52:32.611 --> 00:52:35.130
I would believe that the guy was innocent,
but if I had a kid,

857
00:52:35.131 --> 00:52:37.920
I wouldn't leave them alone with them for like three seconds.
How about that?

858
00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.540
You know what I mean?
That's

859
00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:47.430
not Mike.
I hear you.
I totally believe you.
Yeah.
Those charges were fucked up.

860
00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:51.810
Uh,
we're going to go now and,
uh,
yeah,

861
00:52:51.811 --> 00:52:55.010
we're going to slowly back towards the car.
And,
uh,

862
00:52:55.011 --> 00:52:56.700
as I listened for the Choo Choo train,

863
00:52:56.701 --> 00:53:01.530
as it goes around your house to make sure that I don't get run over by it.
Uh,
no,

864
00:53:01.531 --> 00:53:04.380
I don't want a glass of wine.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

865
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:09.300
A Farrah Fawcett died.
This is a really sad,
weak Farrah Fawcett.

866
00:53:09.301 --> 00:53:13.590
I believe that was my first,
um,

867
00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:18.900
no,
it wasn't.
You know what?
Kate Jackson was my first fantasy famous girlfriend,

868
00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:22.950
and that's when she was on the rookies.
You guys remember the rookies?

869
00:53:22.951 --> 00:53:27.951
Ben and then Ben and Ben Nnnn.

870
00:53:28.431 --> 00:53:31.450
It did.
It did.
It did.
It did.
It did.
It did it did it.

871
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:35.220
<v 6>Remember that Shit.
Well,
there,
those great seventies</v>

872
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:40.700
fucking TV shows in all right.
Theme songs like that anymore,
right?
Number Swat.

873
00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:45.670
<v 2>But uh,
but that Baba Dilla,</v>

874
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:50.660
Dilla,
Dilla,
Dilla,

875
00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:54.680
<v 6>back when they had musicians,
it'd be a whole fucking orchestra.</v>

876
00:53:54.681 --> 00:53:59.090
Pbs To make God damn livings writing TV themes.
But anyways,

877
00:53:59.091 --> 00:54:02.240
Kate Jackson,
she was like the original Dimi more,

878
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:05.630
however you say that fucking cougars name.
Huh?

879
00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:09.000
With their fucking lead pipe titties.
Um,

880
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.730
<v 3>okay.</v>

881
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:14.000
<v 6>Yeah,
she played,
she was,
it was the whole shear,
the sexy voice.</v>

882
00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:17.570
Absolutely beautiful eyes,
beautiful hair,
the whole fucking thing.

883
00:54:17.571 --> 00:54:22.070
She was so fucking hot and she was dressed like a nurse and there was no fucking

884
00:54:22.071 --> 00:54:26.240
Internet.
There was no porn.
There was no,
I had nothing.

885
00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:29.240
That was a man without a fucking country back then.

886
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:33.470
So I would just sit there fucking Mesmer.
It was a,
it was a perfect show.

887
00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:34.850
And she's married to the cop.

888
00:54:34.851 --> 00:54:38.750
The cops character's name I still remember was Mike Danco.
Right.

889
00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:42.200
That's like a classic seventies macho.

890
00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:47.550
I'm fucking hitting it right name Mike Danco.
Uh,

891
00:54:47.551 --> 00:54:50.210
Mike Danco mother fucker.
That's how we should have said it.
There's no,

892
00:54:50.211 --> 00:54:53.060
they should have beeped out motherfucker every week when somebody said his name,

893
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:55.540
you know,
and I used to watch that show gone.

894
00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:59.330
I can call and that's what I'm going to do in life.
I'm going to be a cop.

895
00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:03.530
I'm changing my name to Mike Danko and I'm marrying some hot ass fucking nurse

896
00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:06.230
and I'm banging are in that fucking nurse outfit.

897
00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.530
I don't even think shit like that.
I was like so innocent.

898
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:13.430
I'd even have thoughts like that.
I,
I was literally like in love.

899
00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:18.560
Remember that when you actually had that in before you ever met some girl who

900
00:55:18.561 --> 00:55:22.730
just fucked up your whole view of women and you actually viewed them as if they

901
00:55:22.731 --> 00:55:25.850
were like these angels because they were so gorgeous.
You know,

902
00:55:25.851 --> 00:55:28.700
before you realize that a three out of four weeks a month,

903
00:55:28.701 --> 00:55:32.390
they're going to be absolute fucking maniacs.
But I digress.

904
00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:38.180
So,
um,
yeah,
so Farrah Fawcett dies.
Talk about,
you know,

905
00:55:38.181 --> 00:55:39.770
out of all the fucking days to die,

906
00:55:39.771 --> 00:55:44.640
you die on a day when a guy do.
Michael Jackson is so famous.

907
00:55:44.641 --> 00:55:45.690
If you guys seen that thing,

908
00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:50.900
an entire prison yard in the Philippines work nine hours to reenact the thriller

909
00:55:52.831 --> 00:55:55.950
dance,
and they did it and they put it up on Youtube.

910
00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:59.040
These are prisoners in the fucking Philippines.

911
00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:00.440
<v 3>Okay.</v>

912
00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:05.000
<v 6>That the risk of pissing off all you white trash,
ice road truckers out there.</v>

913
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:10.140
Fuck Elvis Presley.
Elvis Presley
was,

914
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:14.810
he just wasn't anywhere near that.
He was,
he was huge jobs.

915
00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:18.570
A bunch of people right now.
Now wait a minute,
that's the fucking King,
man.

916
00:56:18.571 --> 00:56:19.740
You don't say that Shit.

917
00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:23.830
Elvis Presley was the king.

918
00:56:23.831 --> 00:56:28.480
You understand that buddy Michael Jackson was the king of Pop.

919
00:56:28.481 --> 00:56:33.280
Do you understand that?
That means he is.
His Kingdom is clarified.

920
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:38.650
He's the king of everything.
No,
he's the king of fucking pop.

921
00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:41.230
Elvis Presley was the fucking king period,

922
00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:46.540
which means Michael Jackson was his fucking subject.
Um,

923
00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:47.861
I get that.

924
00:56:47.861 --> 00:56:51.520
And also Elvis Presley didn't have the advantage of the worldwide web.

925
00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:53.050
You know what I mean?

926
00:56:53.050 --> 00:56:56.980
Where you can have as little talent as the chocolate rain guy and you can go

927
00:56:56.981 --> 00:57:00.640
national.
So I can only imagine if,
you know,

928
00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:03.100
Ed Sullivan could have put that fucking,
you know,

929
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.830
I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Whatever.

930
00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:08.260
I had to defend Elvis a little bit.
I,
I,
you know,

931
00:57:08.261 --> 00:57:11.920
I used to make fun of Elvis and then I went to his house one time when I was on

932
00:57:11.921 --> 00:57:15.760
the road and I went in there thinking I was going to get a bit and thinking it

933
00:57:15.761 --> 00:57:17.860
was going to be funny.
And you know what,
it was just sad.

934
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:22.390
I just saw a guy who was basically the original behind the music guy.

935
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:27.100
Um,
and who was like,
even in death,

936
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:29.500
we're all Wah.
I just,
I felt like I was just like,

937
00:57:29.501 --> 00:57:31.570
I'm just intruding on this guy's house.

938
00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:35.350
And then you walk out back in the his grave and everybody's taking pictures next

939
00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:40.090
to his grave.
It's just like,
uh,
you know that how should be haunted.

940
00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:43.930
Like Elvis should literally be haunting that house and scaring the shit out of

941
00:57:43.931 --> 00:57:47.230
those fucking people.
But God knows they still wouldn't even get it.

942
00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:51.310
They would still thinking,
you know,
he's singing,
he's singing from the grave.

943
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:55.840
It's a little more vulgar than I remember,
you know.

944
00:57:57.310 --> 00:58:00.270
I mean,
I guess he didn't ride his own lyrics.
Hell,
we probably fucking stole.

945
00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:04.330
If you believe what some of them people of color are saying about his music.

946
00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:08.710
Um,
all right,
what are we doing here?
Let's get on with the,
Oh,

947
00:58:08.711 --> 00:58:11.500
wait a minute and now we have to go back before that.
Who Else fucking die?

948
00:58:11.501 --> 00:58:15.610
That was some Ed Mcmahon died.
Ed Mcmahon.

949
00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:20.890
Ed make man died.
And I hated after fucking,
you know,
Michael,
you know,

950
00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:25.630
Ed Mcmahon dies,
then a Farrah Fawcett dies and Michael Jackson dies.

951
00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:30.610
And then there's always that Douche bag who has to be like,
yeah,
she bed.

952
00:58:30.611 --> 00:58:35.410
Things come in threes.
You know,
bad things come in threes.

953
00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:40.210
Really?
What about Dave?
David Carradine.
You know what about him?
He died.

954
00:58:40.211 --> 00:58:44.230
That makes for stupid.
Some old lady died of heat stroke.
I saw that on the news.

955
00:58:44.231 --> 00:58:48.580
That's five.
What was it all in the same week?
Well,
you know what?

956
00:58:48.581 --> 00:58:50.980
I got two words for you.
Billy Mays,

957
00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:54.550
not Billy Mays and I fucking die toe.

958
00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:56.710
So there you go.

959
00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:01.240
That's four famous mother fuckers in one God damn week.
You know what?

960
00:59:01.241 --> 00:59:02.240
Somebody told me something,

961
00:59:02.250 --> 00:59:04.690
somebody wrote me a hilarious fucking email was saying like,

962
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:09.130
how the fuck they couldn't believe that they didn't see Billy Mays dying.

963
00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:12.550
They couldn't see his death come when he clearly looks like he ate four pounds

964
00:59:12.551 --> 00:59:16.870
of Bacon every God damn morning.
He really did.
You ever do?

965
00:59:16.871 --> 00:59:19.690
I hate when people do that.
Like you always predict some shit after it happens.

966
00:59:19.691 --> 00:59:23.120
But I gotta admit once Billy Mays died,
you were kind of like,
well,

967
00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:27.170
he really did have that heart attack face,
didn't he?
He just had that,

968
00:59:27.171 --> 00:59:30.290
that bluedot beard and he was always screaming.

969
00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.920
And not only that,
he was around all that cleaner.

970
00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:37.580
How many takes do you think they did as he was sitting there spraying that oxy

971
00:59:37.581 --> 00:59:42.140
wash?
Fucking whenever the hell it was called,
that oxy oxy clean.

972
00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:44.480
Do you guys ever get that shit?
Did you,

973
00:59:44.481 --> 00:59:48.470
did you feel that it made your whites a whole lot wider?
I don't think it did.

974
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:51.710
That's why I think Billy Mays.
Dot.
I think it was from all that lying,

975
00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:53.270
he just couldn't do it anymore.

976
00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:57.770
Screaming about fucking alarm clocks that can scratch your back or whatever the

977
00:59:57.771 --> 01:00:02.090
hell he had.
I Dunno.
So whenever,
there you go.

978
01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.050
What a fucking month.
Huh?
David Carradine.
God bless them.

979
01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:08.630
And I really think it's bad that people actually give them shit.

980
01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:10.080
I have no problem with,

981
01:00:10.081 --> 01:00:14.480
with the fact that he liked to put on fish nets and hang himself.
You know,

982
01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:20.030
I hope that I'm that much of a freak.
It's 72 fucking years old.
You know,

983
01:00:20.031 --> 01:00:23.270
I just,
I just,
I got really like a,

984
01:00:23.271 --> 01:00:27.080
I got inspired by the fact that he was doing that,
that at that age,

985
01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:30.590
you know what I mean?
Do you just picture your 72 you know,

986
01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.410
you just fucking hobbling around.

987
01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:38.210
I'll tell you that paper boy,

988
01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:42.560
he played playing with a paper too far away from the door.
That's what,

989
01:00:42.561 --> 01:00:46.670
that's what I pictured 72 as you know,
you all excited.
You got that.

990
01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:48.440
You can't go up the stairs anymore.

991
01:00:48.441 --> 01:00:51.260
You've got to sit in that electronic fucking thing that brings you all the way

992
01:00:51.261 --> 01:00:54.440
up the stairs.
You know?

993
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:58.790
Remember that Shit I was talking about a long time ago where you have that you

994
01:00:58.791 --> 01:01:03.500
have the elevated toilet seat because anybody can use gravity and get their

995
01:01:03.501 --> 01:01:05.570
fucking old ass down on a toilet seat.

996
01:01:05.571 --> 01:01:09.020
But it still takes the quad strength to get the fuck back up off of it.

997
01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:12.200
But you can't afford somebody to help you up off the toilet seat.

998
01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.390
So you have to have an elevated toilet seat.

999
01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:20.150
So you basically for the rest of your fucking life,
you take a fucking shit

1000
01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:26.120
standing there like a third basement,
you know at the ready position.

1001
01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.780
That's how you take a shit,
you know,

1002
01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.540
hands on your knees standing there like fucking Brooks Robinson waiting to

1003
01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:41.270
squeeze one out.
Little metamucil wouldn't hurt either.

1004
01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:44.180
And then you got David Carradine.

1005
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:49.850
See I'm telling you guys that that's why each stretching is so fucking

1006
01:01:49.851 --> 01:01:51.530
unbelievable if you want it.

1007
01:01:51.531 --> 01:01:54.740
That's the biggest thing you can do other than eating well I think to try and

1008
01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:59.520
still feel young because if you don't stretch your hamstrings and everything
off,

1009
01:01:59.521 --> 01:02:01.820
if you don't stretch it out,
I guess atrophied.

1010
01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.210
I don't even know what the fuck that means.
All I know is I noticed,
you know,

1011
01:02:05.211 --> 01:02:09.980
I haven't been that good about it and I've been running with my dog and I was

1012
01:02:09.981 --> 01:02:13.670
like,
Holy Shit.
I am rapidly approaching the age where I can't run anymore.

1013
01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:15.830
You know?
I mean that happens anyways.

1014
01:02:15.831 --> 01:02:17.300
At some point you're not going to be able to run,

1015
01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:20.190
but if you stop stretching that is the quickest.

1016
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.470
I think that is the quickest way.

1017
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:26.370
And I'm saying that having absolutely no degree in nutrition,

1018
01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.130
physical therapy or anything whatsoever,

1019
01:02:29.131 --> 01:02:32.970
so you can take that to the fucking bank.
All right,

1020
01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.590
let's get into the podcast stuff here that you guys send it.
Um,

1021
01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:42.510
here's one for you.
Last week I was talking about grenades.
I don't know why,

1022
01:02:42.511 --> 01:02:47.310
I can't remember why,
but I had somehow as I presented the question,

1023
01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:52.050
uh,
what would happen if I,
you know,
oh,

1024
01:02:52.051 --> 01:02:53.780
I remember because we were talking about that,

1025
01:02:53.781 --> 01:02:57.210
that guy sent in that email about that psycho who lived across the street,

1026
01:02:57.211 --> 01:03:01.170
who was in the army and he used to sneak shit home and try and sell it.

1027
01:03:01.171 --> 01:03:05.730
And the guy was in a bar trying to sell a fucking grenade.
And uh,

1028
01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:10.680
be honest.
You'd buy it.
Wouldn't you give three Budweisers in?

1029
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:16.510
You're going through a breakup or maybe you just young and you have hope and he

1030
01:03:16.761 --> 01:03:18.130
just got that one fucking,
that,

1031
01:03:18.131 --> 01:03:22.440
that industrial area that they're just developing in your town and you're like,

1032
01:03:22.441 --> 01:03:26.610
all right,
this is the deal.
We'll pull the pin,
we'll throw it,

1033
01:03:26.611 --> 01:03:30.480
and then we'll fucking rob you.
Of course you're going to do that.
So anyway,

1034
01:03:30.481 --> 01:03:34.350
so I presented like,
I was wondering like what,
what the level of explosion,

1035
01:03:34.351 --> 01:03:38.380
the concussive force,
whatever the fuck it is of a grenade.
Like could,
if I,

1036
01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.150
if I had threw a grenade on the other side of my bed and I dove on the other

1037
01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:46.620
side of my bed,
blocked up my ears and it exploded.
Okay.

1038
01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.870
And I'm talking about one of those beds,
those beds where you know,

1039
01:03:48.871 --> 01:03:50.940
you can't steal it because they got like the fucking,

1040
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:55.380
the wood frame underneath it.
Um,
would I be able to survive?

1041
01:03:55.830 --> 01:04:00.060
So from somebody from,
uh,
the,
uh,
the Marines told me,
he said,
Bill,

1042
01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:05.820
a hand grenade in your hotel room would definitely fuck your day up with a 15

1043
01:04:05.821 --> 01:04:06.360
mil,

1044
01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:11.360
15 meter kill radius inside of an enclosed space.

1045
01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:14.970
Your head and asshole would be indistinguishable,

1046
01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:19.830
indistinguishable from one another.
I hope that answers your question.
Yeah,

1047
01:04:19.831 --> 01:04:24.330
I would say you were pretty specific there.
So anyways,
for you who suck at math,

1048
01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:27.090
uh,
a meter is a little more than a yard.

1049
01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:30.870
And I only remember that from that commercial back in the 70s when they were

1050
01:04:30.871 --> 01:04:33.840
trying to teach us the metric system,
which bombed miserably.

1051
01:04:33.841 --> 01:04:38.841
So 15 times three would be 45 feet and that is a radius of 45 feet.

1052
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:41.500
Jesus Christ.
So then I,

1053
01:04:41.501 --> 01:04:46.260
I wrote the guy back cause I really found that interesting.

1054
01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:51.270
And I guess because it's enclosed that the ceiling kind of keeps the blast in

1055
01:04:51.271 --> 01:04:55.200
and the walls and all that.
I guess if you're outside you have a better chance.

1056
01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:58.320
I don't know,
I'd have to talk more about this,

1057
01:04:58.321 --> 01:05:03.030
but this immediately has opened up a new podcast thing for anyone who's in the

1058
01:05:03.031 --> 01:05:03.864
military.

1059
01:05:04.110 --> 01:05:08.130
I want to learn about these fucking weapons and a what they can do to you.

1060
01:05:08.131 --> 01:05:10.920
And I'm going to tell you right now,
anybody with a fucking gun,

1061
01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:15.300
there's nothing they like better than telling you what the fucking gun would do

1062
01:05:15.301 --> 01:05:16.830
to you.
Have you ever noticed that

1063
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:20.890
<v 2>anytime somebody gets a gun,
what do they say?
I,
I,
you know,</v>

1064
01:05:20.891 --> 01:05:25.590
I just got it to go hunting.
Right?
And then you'd be like,
well what's,
you know,

1065
01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:28.540
what,
what's,
what's that gun like in the guys do from here?

1066
01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.580
If I shot you right from here and I shot you,

1067
01:05:30.581 --> 01:05:34.310
a whole fucking shoulder would come off,
you spinal cord would be dangling.

1068
01:05:34.311 --> 01:05:36.820
They always do that shit.
So,
you know,

1069
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:40.330
what's the point I have in a weapon if you don't know what it would do to a

1070
01:05:40.331 --> 01:05:44.850
human being.
That's what I say.
Huh.
Anybody else?
And to be held.

1071
01:05:44.851 --> 01:05:49.280
So Braveheart fan.
Um,
all right.
You know,
I actually sat down,
you know,

1072
01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:53.050
the day watching the whole history of the machine gun.
It was really fascinating.

1073
01:05:53.051 --> 01:05:55.870
Like this guy actually developed a machine gun cause he thought it was going to

1074
01:05:55.871 --> 01:05:59.320
save lives when he was in the civil war.
He was a,

1075
01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:01.630
Gatlin was a guy like the Gatlin gun.

1076
01:06:01.631 --> 01:06:05.290
He was sitting there talking about how he just saw the unbelievable level of

1077
01:06:05.291 --> 01:06:07.720
carnage in the civil war.

1078
01:06:07.721 --> 01:06:09.820
And you've gotta remember that's Americans shooting Americans.

1079
01:06:09.821 --> 01:06:13.030
So even if you're winning,
you know,
it's,
it's just a brutal thing.

1080
01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:16.240
And he was saying that if you've got a machine gun,

1081
01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:20.440
if he could do the work of 15 fucking people or 20 people,

1082
01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:26.260
um,
then that would be 19 less people who'd be out in the battlefield,

1083
01:06:26.261 --> 01:06:30.910
who could possibly lose their lives.
Of course he didn't do the math of,
well,

1084
01:06:30.911 --> 01:06:32.320
if they get one too,

1085
01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:35.440
then you need to have another guy with a machine gun and then it just keeps

1086
01:06:35.441 --> 01:06:37.750
fucking escalating.
But I did find it interesting,

1087
01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:42.160
or maybe that was just the bullshit that he said because he felt bad that he was

1088
01:06:42.161 --> 01:06:45.880
making money off of creating a weapon that could just literally mow down people.

1089
01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:51.220
Um,
anyways,
so here's the second part of the,
uh,
the grenade thing.
Um,

1090
01:06:51.221 --> 01:06:55.870
I think I,
what I,
what did I ask him?
Oh,
I remember that.

1091
01:06:55.871 --> 01:06:59.830
And so I emailed that guy back and I said,
okay,
so what if I had a suite,

1092
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:03.880
a hotel suite,
and I throw it out into the living room area.

1093
01:07:03.881 --> 01:07:06.940
I closed the door in the bedroom and I dove behind the bed.

1094
01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:11.080
So then he proceeded to take a lot of time out of his day,

1095
01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:14.050
which I appreciate.
Here.
Wrote me a nice long email.

1096
01:07:14.051 --> 01:07:19.051
So this ladies and gentlemen is the answer to what if you had the suite and you

1097
01:07:19.181 --> 01:07:21.400
lit up,
you fucking pulled the pin on a grenade,

1098
01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:24.430
closed your bedroom door and dove behind the bed.
See,

1099
01:07:24.431 --> 01:07:28.270
I asked the questions that America wants to know.
All right,
here we go.

1100
01:07:28.271 --> 01:07:31.630
This guy said,
I did five years in the marines.
Uh,
he said,

1101
01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:35.030
I got on the Post Nine 11 redneck bandwagon.
Uh,

1102
01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:40.090
but by the time I got to Iraq in 2006,
we stopped using hand grenades indoors.

1103
01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:41.200
Normally,

1104
01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.800
normally we would just lob a few of those fuckers in a room and not have to

1105
01:07:44.801 --> 01:07:48.160
worry about the assholes on the other side.
Uh,
he goes,

1106
01:07:48.161 --> 01:07:49.870
I know that's cold blooded,
but hey,

1107
01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:53.950
he can have his 73 versions of an unspecified gender.

1108
01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.490
You know what?
That's a funny ass fucking loophole.

1109
01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:04.720
They really just say he gets 73 versions.
They don't say that they are women.

1110
01:08:04.721 --> 01:08:09.370
Do the that's fuck,
that's a great analogy.
Anyways.
Um,

1111
01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:14.370
he said,
and we replaced them with a flash grenades.
Uh,

1112
01:08:14.410 --> 01:08:17.900
basically we didn't want to kill innocent people in wind up on the cover of Time

1113
01:08:17.901 --> 01:08:21.830
magazine as the winner of Asshole of the year.
Um,
then we,

1114
01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:26.780
after we throw in the flash flash,
I just literally lost my place there,

1115
01:08:26.781 --> 01:08:30.260
the flash grenades.
Then we would charge into the room shooting.

1116
01:08:30.261 --> 01:08:34.430
Like I was a in the Goddamn Matrix.
Um,
but anyways,

1117
01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:37.280
I have seen hand grenades go off and there were two wait,

1118
01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:42.590
there were two ways of standard fragmentation.
Grenade can kill you.
One,

1119
01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.270
the blast itself,

1120
01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:48.110
which generally projects in a 15 foot radius.

1121
01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:53.170
Is anybody out there?
Can anybody explain to me the,

1122
01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:54.830
the blast itself,

1123
01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:59.540
how that kills you if you're not getting hit by shrapnel?

1124
01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:00.560
Just the blast.

1125
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:05.590
Is that basically like the most psychotic invisible front kick?

1126
01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:09.830
Is that what an explosion is in,
in that,
that the air,

1127
01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:13.250
the force of the blast just hit you so hard.

1128
01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:17.990
It's like getting hit by like an invisible truck.
Is that what it is?
Um,

1129
01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:21.770
to be honest with you,
I've always kind of thought about that,

1130
01:09:21.771 --> 01:09:24.410
but I never really sat down and tried to figure it out.

1131
01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:25.850
And that's basically what I was able to,

1132
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:30.450
to come up with having not researched anyways.
But anyways,
the guy says,
ah,

1133
01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:35.150
the concussion from the blast turns your insides into Jello if you're within a

1134
01:09:35.151 --> 01:09:39.200
five meter bubble.
So is that what happens?

1135
01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:40.970
You know what I mean?

1136
01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:45.970
So literally it's like getting hit by this invisible fucking,

1137
01:09:46.161 --> 01:09:49.190
uh,
what,
what did Bruce Lee have?
The one inch punch?

1138
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:54.560
It's like getting hit by a few times.
Fucking 200.
I don't know.

1139
01:09:54.561 --> 01:09:56.760
Why don't I read the rest of us and maybe we'll find out.
Ah,

1140
01:09:56.761 --> 01:10:00.340
the second way you can die a horrific deaths is,
uh,

1141
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:05.410
from a frag grenade is the fragmentation from the shell of the grenade and the

1142
01:10:05.751 --> 01:10:10.751
fragmentation of all the other shit like wood and pieces of other people that

1143
01:10:11.091 --> 01:10:15.440
the blast turns into shrapnel.
Wow.

1144
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:18.920
Jesus Christ.
You know what I mean?

1145
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:21.500
As much as you watch the beginning of saving private Ryan,

1146
01:10:21.501 --> 01:10:26.090
like he's still really can't ever capture how fucking horrific that must be.

1147
01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:30.860
Um,
the amount of damage of frag will do to you in the next room,

1148
01:10:30.861 --> 01:10:34.280
depends on the wall in your suite,
what it's made out of.

1149
01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:38.090
If the walls are made out of concrete with rebar and shit inside,

1150
01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:42.140
you'll more than likely just shit your pants.
That's amazing.

1151
01:10:42.141 --> 01:10:43.580
So if there isn't like rebar in there,

1152
01:10:43.581 --> 01:10:45.860
which I'm imagining is those little steal things,

1153
01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:48.450
it could still fucking kill you.
Um,

1154
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:53.000
if the wall is thin and some of the fragmentation may or may go through the wall

1155
01:10:53.001 --> 01:10:56.030
and hit you,
but you'll be safe from the blast itself.

1156
01:10:56.031 --> 01:11:00.740
And probably we'll probably live all just be screaming on the floor like that

1157
01:11:00.741 --> 01:11:04.340
guy and platoon is Barnes crawls over in,
digs the shit out with a knife.

1158
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:09.440
Good Lord.
God bless you guys man.
I really do not have a difficult life here.

1159
01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:12.620
All right,
more.
Most doors on hotel rooms are pretty solid,

1160
01:11:12.621 --> 01:11:15.880
so I think could take a direct hit and not damage anything on the other side.

1161
01:11:16.090 --> 01:11:17.920
Also,
it depends on the type of grenade.

1162
01:11:18.130 --> 01:11:23.130
American hand grenades are the largest and the deadliest USA USA.

1163
01:11:23.621 --> 01:11:28.000
That's right.
Fucking America baby.
Um,

1164
01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:31.990
the Russian grenades are a little bit smaller.
I liked this.
I liked the whole,
uh,

1165
01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:34.930
the whole Phallic thing going on here with less fragmentation,

1166
01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:38.920
but I still wouldn't want to be in the same fucking zip code when one goes off.

1167
01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:42.280
Um,
and then the second question I asked him was,
um,

1168
01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:45.190
hearing loss is a big thing for me because a,

1169
01:11:45.191 --> 01:11:49.840
I played drums without earplugs for awhile and I also went and saw ACD,

1170
01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:54.870
seen a bunch of other heavy metal bands in every other time I wear earplugs and

1171
01:11:55.721 --> 01:12:00.480
I have tinnitus in my right ear,
which is a,
you know,

1172
01:12:00.490 --> 01:12:05.170
sometimes it can be a buzzing sound or it can be just a ringing sound and it

1173
01:12:05.171 --> 01:12:09.820
never goes away and it's driven people to suicide.
If it's loud enough.

1174
01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:13.390
Mine fortunately isn't.
It's just like,

1175
01:12:14.590 --> 01:12:17.740
like right now I can barely hear it.
Like if I actually just stopped talking,

1176
01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:21.760
if I stopped like late at night,
I can hear it when there's nothing going on.

1177
01:12:21.761 --> 01:12:25.660
If there's no background noise,
I just saw to here like this really low,
just soda

1178
01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:28.150
<v 3>D</v>

1179
01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:31.380
<v 2>in my ear.
And I know a lot of you just was like,
Holy Shit,
that must be crazy.</v>

1180
01:12:31.381 --> 01:12:33.390
But you actually,
that's my phone by the way.

1181
01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:36.150
If you're wondering what the other sound is,
that's not the sound in my ear.

1182
01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:40.800
That's letting me know that I have some fucking new Texas.
Um,

1183
01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:42.201
but anyways,
yeah,

1184
01:12:42.201 --> 01:12:44.850
it was always wondering like how these guys are in war and the shooting these

1185
01:12:44.851 --> 01:12:46.890
fucking machine guns and all this type of stuff.

1186
01:12:46.891 --> 01:12:50.100
Like how do you not lose your hearing?
And he said to,

1187
01:12:50.190 --> 01:12:54.490
to answer your second question,
he said,
I have a condition called Tinnitus,
uh,

1188
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:57.120
which I basically explained,
but I'll have them explain it to,
he said,

1189
01:12:57.121 --> 01:12:59.970
which is a permanent permanent ringing in my ears.

1190
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.310
And my left ear is pretty fucked up as well.

1191
01:13:02.490 --> 01:13:05.820
Some dude opened up with a machine gun right next to my head and I didn't have

1192
01:13:05.821 --> 01:13:09.660
an ear plug in my left ear.
So I guess you guys wear earplugs over there.

1193
01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:12.630
But I would think sometimes if you get ambushed,

1194
01:13:12.631 --> 01:13:16.680
you don't have a minute and then he just got to fucking open up anyways.

1195
01:13:16.681 --> 01:13:20.610
I don't really notice the ringing unless it's really fucking quiet and since I

1196
01:13:20.611 --> 01:13:24.690
live in the middle of a dense urban area,
it's never really fucking quiet.

1197
01:13:24.691 --> 01:13:28.710
So it's not an issue.
In combat we wear earplugs that work pretty well.

1198
01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:31.950
Shooting aside small rooms is still pretty fucking loud though.

1199
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:36.030
The loudest thing over there are aircraft and anything that explodes.

1200
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:39.390
I'm talking about the loudest fucking thing you would ever hear in your life.

1201
01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:40.111
Also,

1202
01:13:40.111 --> 01:13:44.280
we normally communicate non verbally through hand signals and just knowing where

1203
01:13:44.281 --> 01:13:46.680
you should be in a certain situation.
Oh,

1204
01:13:46.681 --> 01:13:49.440
he's addressing the fact that you know you always watched those cop movies and

1205
01:13:49.441 --> 01:13:53.250
the and the sort of whisper after they shot a couple of rounds,

1206
01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:56.010
you know and I've shot a gun without fucking earplugs.

1207
01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:58.920
That's another dumb thing I did when my hearing and I couldn't hear anything.

1208
01:13:58.921 --> 01:14:02.340
So there's no fucking way I could then whisper to somebody next to me going,

1209
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.510
you go around back and I'll try to keep him busy here cause they got to be going

1210
01:14:06.511 --> 01:14:10.950
like,
hey,
I can't fucking hear you.
Um,
so anyways,
he said they use hand.

1211
01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:13.820
Um,
anyways,

1212
01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:17.510
besides shouting within earshot of the enemy is retarded since they counter

1213
01:14:17.511 --> 01:14:20.600
attack and the element of surprise is lost.
Uh,

1214
01:14:20.601 --> 01:14:25.070
this email was probably longer than that ladies.

1215
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:28.220
Oh,
that ladies who've made fun of your suit on Kona.
Not Dude,

1216
01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:31.220
I totally appreciate that man.
If there's anybody else out there that like,

1217
01:14:31.221 --> 01:14:32.240
really,
uh,

1218
01:14:33.650 --> 01:14:37.370
that's like some time life books kind of stopped,
you know,

1219
01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.710
when they talk about what it's really like.
So if anybody else,

1220
01:14:39.711 --> 01:14:43.100
if I have anybody who's a overseas,
God knows you get the Internet over there,

1221
01:14:43.101 --> 01:14:47.900
if you're over there in Iraq or if you're over there in Afghanistan and I'm

1222
01:14:47.901 --> 01:14:49.700
trying to think of a question or for any of the listeners,

1223
01:14:49.701 --> 01:14:54.350
have any questions of stuff over there.
Um,
I got one for you.
You know,

1224
01:14:54.351 --> 01:14:58.580
you sit there and you train and you go through bootcamp and you do all that

1225
01:14:58.581 --> 01:15:00.850
stuff,
you know,
and uh,

1226
01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:05.240
you get yourself ready for battle and then you go on over there.
You know,

1227
01:15:05.241 --> 01:15:08.510
I know my biggest fear would have been like,
what am I going to be?

1228
01:15:08.511 --> 01:15:13.511
That guy who freezes up and is crying in the fetal position spooning his weapon

1229
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:19.340
in a foxhole is someone's screaming at me private bar for Christ's sake,

1230
01:15:19.341 --> 01:15:23.930
get your shit together.
You best on fuck yourself pile.

1231
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:29.270
I mean what happens is it does it just naturally clicking.

1232
01:15:29.330 --> 01:15:34.130
Cause I would think even in my first battle,
even if I didn't pussy out,

1233
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:36.650
I would still be a spazz

1234
01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:43.380
fucking empty and entire clip.
I remember talking to cops about this shit shit.

1235
01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:46.740
<v 6>We had this cop on my radio show,
uninformed and by the way,</v>

1236
01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:48.540
I have a new episode coming out.

1237
01:15:49.050 --> 01:15:53.790
We taped one a yesterday that will be out on July 3rd you can listen to that on

1238
01:15:53.791 --> 01:15:57.180
a XM two o two and a.
Anyways,

1239
01:15:57.181 --> 01:15:58.810
this comp was saying how a lot here,

1240
01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:02.400
he worked with guys the first time they pulled their weapons.
This is,

1241
01:16:02.401 --> 01:16:03.420
this is an old school guy,

1242
01:16:03.421 --> 01:16:08.160
so they still had like the six shooter and was saying they pulled a gun out of

1243
01:16:08.161 --> 01:16:12.270
the holster and by the time they brought it up level with the suspect,

1244
01:16:12.271 --> 01:16:17.100
they were literally out of bullets because they would be pulling it out and Bam,

1245
01:16:17.101 --> 01:16:19.440
like shooting literally into the ground in front of them.

1246
01:16:19.650 --> 01:16:23.190
They've had guys shoot themselves in the foot.
I'm just,

1247
01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:28.380
I just can't imagine the fucking adrenaline that is going through your,
your,

1248
01:16:28.381 --> 01:16:31.260
your body when something like that is happening.
So you know,

1249
01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:32.790
if it's not too painful,

1250
01:16:32.791 --> 01:16:35.430
obviously I'm not trying to have a big therapy session here.

1251
01:16:35.670 --> 01:16:37.400
This is supposed to be a comedy fuckers.

1252
01:16:37.401 --> 01:16:41.610
So if he got some funny stories or anything like that,
uh,
listen to me.

1253
01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:45.660
If you got any funny stories about war and engaging the enemy,
I dunno.

1254
01:16:45.690 --> 01:16:48.790
Anything that you would think would be fucking interesting.
Uh,

1255
01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:51.630
because I don't think I can,
I can answer any more questions about comedy.

1256
01:16:51.631 --> 01:16:55.560
I've pretty much answered them all.
But,
um,
I don't know,

1257
01:16:55.561 --> 01:16:56.820
I'm kind of speaking for the group here,

1258
01:16:56.821 --> 01:17:00.900
but I find that stuff really interesting because my only frame of restaurant

1259
01:17:00.901 --> 01:17:05.550
references when I watch movies and you see these guys,
you know,
they throw,

1260
01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:09.150
you never see that in a movie.
Like there's a grenade lands near the guys,

1261
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:13.080
then somebody dives on top of it to save his buddies life.
Now from,

1262
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:16.650
I always thought that you could do that,
but having just read that last one,

1263
01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:20.520
evidently if I did that,
then just,
you know,
all the 200,

1264
01:17:20.521 --> 01:17:24.930
whatever bones in my body would just turn into shrapnel.
And you know,

1265
01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:27.240
I don't know if people would die around me,

1266
01:17:27.241 --> 01:17:30.900
but they would definitely rolling around the ground trying to get my femur out

1267
01:17:30.901 --> 01:17:32.310
of the side of their fucking neck.

1268
01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:36.650
So we all learned something all right

1269
01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:41.180
<v 2>on with the,
uh,
the podcast questions and you know,
it's just not,</v>

1270
01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:45.110
the question is obviously posed to all veterans,
cops,
anybody rednecks.

1271
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:46.630
If you got,

1272
01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:50.150
knows you probably threw a grenade at a duck and it's bill came back and hit you

1273
01:17:50.151 --> 01:17:54.260
in your foot.
Now you got to limp any,
any of those fucking stories.
I would,

1274
01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:58.250
I would love to hear all right.
Podcast questions of the week.
Uh,

1275
01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:02.450
this was a really interesting one.
Um,
this guy says,
Bill,

1276
01:18:02.451 --> 01:18:06.740
I come from a family where more than half of the women have gotten pregnant in

1277
01:18:06.741 --> 01:18:10.020
their teens and almost all of the men have ended up in jail,

1278
01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:14.180
in jail at various points in their lives.
Um,

1279
01:18:14.181 --> 01:18:17.420
so I've seen firsthand how having a kid when you're not ready and going to

1280
01:18:17.421 --> 01:18:19.850
prison at an early age can really fuck up your life.

1281
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:21.860
And because I'm trying not to,

1282
01:18:22.190 --> 01:18:25.970
because I'm trying to end the tradition of poverty and dysfunction in my family,

1283
01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:30.350
I am very hesitant towards trying to hook up with random women and can be

1284
01:18:30.351 --> 01:18:35.230
considered a bit of a nerd also.
Um,

1285
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:39.890
due to the fact that I don't have like two or three baby mothers and I'm never

1286
01:18:39.891 --> 01:18:42.830
bringing girls around the family,
you guessed it.

1287
01:18:42.831 --> 01:18:46.580
I've now been accused of being gay.
I guess by his,
his,
uh,

1288
01:18:46.581 --> 01:18:50.090
his family members.
Wow.
Okay.

1289
01:18:50.170 --> 01:18:54.710
I thought I came from a dysfunctional family.
Um,
all right.

1290
01:18:54.711 --> 01:18:58.430
I hope you see my dilemma here.
Uh,
if I go out of my way to prove I'm not gay,

1291
01:18:58.431 --> 01:19:02.150
that I'm acting,
acting like the classic Homophobe,
I'm not cool with that.

1292
01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:07.130
I'm also giving them power by trying to conform to their perception of what a

1293
01:19:07.131 --> 01:19:11.570
quote unquote real man is.
But if I ignore it,
they continued to talk shit.

1294
01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:16.160
It would be different if,
uh,
if,
if it were a collection of Douchebag,

1295
01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:19.850
jock saying things like this,
but it's not,
this is my fucking family.

1296
01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:23.120
The people who were supposed to love me unconditionally.
And yes,

1297
01:19:23.121 --> 01:19:28.090
as sad as it may seem,
my family members are that stupid and ignorant.
Uh,

1298
01:19:28.290 --> 01:19:31.640
they think being gay is something that warrants being made fun of.

1299
01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:34.850
Although I can,
uh,
I can really see the humor in this.

1300
01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.710
It really does hurt a little,

1301
01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:40.280
doing the right thing by staying in school and trying to make something out of

1302
01:19:40.281 --> 01:19:44.810
my life while staying out of trouble has gotten me where I'm accused of being

1303
01:19:44.811 --> 01:19:49.550
gay.
I'm so disgusted with my family that I'm seriously considering cutting each

1304
01:19:49.551 --> 01:19:54.380
member out of my family life.
Even my own mother,
parentheses,

1305
01:19:54.381 --> 01:19:58.100
my,
my father's dead.
Your thoughts.
Uh,

1306
01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:03.110
I think you're doing an amazing thing to be honest with you.

1307
01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:07.740
I think one of the hardest things to do is to grow up in a fucked up environment

1308
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:13.430
and to be in the environment and be surrounded by totally immersed in it.

1309
01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:19.530
Yet still have the ability to pull yourself out of it and analyze it and look at

1310
01:20:19.531 --> 01:20:24.531
how other people are living and if they're living in a smarter way or a way that

1311
01:20:25.981 --> 01:20:26.910
appeals to you more,

1312
01:20:26.911 --> 01:20:31.320
to actually try to go and try to go in that direction without doing what most

1313
01:20:31.321 --> 01:20:31.971
normal people.

1314
01:20:31.971 --> 01:20:35.280
What most people do in that situation is they just look at other people.

1315
01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:39.960
If they're living a smarter life,
they just dismiss them as facts.
You know,

1316
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:44.940
well,
I want to go to college.
Like these a bunch of things,
you know?

1317
01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:48.870
Um,
yeah,
that's a,

1318
01:20:48.871 --> 01:20:51.810
that's a lesson I learned late in life that you really have to watch out who

1319
01:20:51.811 --> 01:20:56.280
your,
uh,
who you surround yourself with because a,

1320
01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:59.100
you basically end up,
for the most part,

1321
01:20:59.101 --> 01:21:04.080
you end up doing what they do.
You just get sucked into that vortex.

1322
01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.570
So I don't know if that's the right word.
Whatever the fuck it is,

1323
01:21:06.571 --> 01:21:09.840
you get sucked into that their little,
uh,
their world.

1324
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:14.490
And so if you're hanging out with people who are doing dumb shit fucking up

1325
01:21:14.491 --> 01:21:17.760
their lives,
the chances of you fucking up your life is going to be huge.

1326
01:21:17.761 --> 01:21:21.480
And Dude,
you don't want two or three babies with,

1327
01:21:21.481 --> 01:21:25.230
with two or three different women,
you know that everybody knows that.

1328
01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:28.440
And even those fucking retards who were doing it,
they know that.

1329
01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.520
And yet what it really is,

1330
01:21:29.521 --> 01:21:34.110
I really think this is a classic example of misery loves company.
And they,

1331
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:38.730
when they're laying in bed at night,
they know that they fucked their lives up.

1332
01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:41.880
And you know what?
When people fuck their lives up.
You know what you do,

1333
01:21:42.090 --> 01:21:44.880
you lay in bed and you think about the first day,

1334
01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:48.150
that day when you fucked your life up and you wish you could just go back to it

1335
01:21:48.630 --> 01:21:52.020
and make a left instead of making a right.
That's what the fuck they're doing.

1336
01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:57.380
And the harsh reality is you can't go back in time and which leaves you with one

1337
01:21:58.441 --> 01:21:59.071
of two things.

1338
01:21:59.071 --> 01:22:04.071
You can even either man up and admit that you're the reason and you're

1339
01:22:04.381 --> 01:22:05.880
responsible for,
you know,

1340
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:10.200
for the fact that your life is fucked up and you try to make the best of it and

1341
01:22:10.201 --> 01:22:15.201
try to actually help other people not make the same mistakes you have.

1342
01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.250
That's the most noble thing that you can do.

1343
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:23.030
Or you can take the easy way out like most people and has tried to fucking do

1344
01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:26.130
that.
Misery loves company and drag everybody down with you.

1345
01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.600
That's all they're trying to do.

1346
01:22:27.601 --> 01:22:30.060
They're trying to drag you down to the bottom of the swimming pool so you can

1347
01:22:30.061 --> 01:22:33.750
drown in their fucking misery too.
So you're doing the right thing.

1348
01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:36.210
And if you have to a,

1349
01:22:36.211 --> 01:22:39.510
I don't know if you've got to like totally cut him out because it is your family

1350
01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:43.890
that is your mom and at some point,
you know,
you know,

1351
01:22:43.891 --> 01:22:45.150
they're not going to be around forever.

1352
01:22:45.150 --> 01:22:49.860
So it's never good to not go for long periods without communicating with your

1353
01:22:49.861 --> 01:22:50.251
family.

1354
01:22:50.251 --> 01:22:55.200
But you just kinda got to give yourself a halftime speech or a pregame speech

1355
01:22:55.201 --> 01:22:59.520
before you talked to him to make sure that,
uh,
you know,

1356
01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:05.070
you basically stay on point and uh,
yeah,

1357
01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:08.650
that,
those are my thoughts.
You're totally doing the right thing.
And I think,
uh,

1358
01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:11.410
I think he had a really strong person that you were able to see how fucked up

1359
01:23:11.411 --> 01:23:16.210
your family was.
That's a hard thing to do,
you know?
Um,

1360
01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:20.260
and try and correct it,
you know,
so it'll be great.
So then you'll,

1361
01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:23.050
you'll end up with the right woman,
you end up having great kids,
and then you'll,

1362
01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:25.840
you'll break the,
uh,

1363
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:28.690
you'll break that circle.

1364
01:23:28.691 --> 01:23:32.720
But the problem that's dead you'll then run into is then when you have kids is

1365
01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:37.640
then they're going to want their fucked up kids to hang out with your,

1366
01:23:37.641 --> 01:23:39.340
uh,
enlightened kids.

1367
01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:44.680
And that'll be the hard thing because they are your cousins in and,
and whatever.

1368
01:23:44.681 --> 01:23:47.740
I Dunno,
it's a fucking mess.
But Dude,
you're on the right track.

1369
01:23:47.741 --> 01:23:51.730
So what do I think you should keep doing what you're doing and try to find some

1370
01:23:51.731 --> 01:23:53.980
middle ground where you keep them at an arm's length,

1371
01:23:53.981 --> 01:23:57.220
but you don't totally sever ties.
And when they,

1372
01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:01.180
and when they give you shit,
you know about being gay,

1373
01:24:01.181 --> 01:24:04.570
just give him shit right back.
Oh really?

1374
01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:08.020
Really?
Really?
I'm,
I'm,
I'm gay.
What?

1375
01:24:08.021 --> 01:24:12.250
Because I don't have some fucking psycho coming in here trying to burn down my

1376
01:24:12.251 --> 01:24:16.120
fucking clothes cause I knocked up another fucking broad.
Not,
don't do that.

1377
01:24:16.121 --> 01:24:18.460
Don't go for it.
That's what I would do.
I'd go for the Juggler.
Like,
dude,

1378
01:24:18.461 --> 01:24:20.380
your life sucks.
Okay.

1379
01:24:20.770 --> 01:24:23.770
What's it like earning $400 a week and giving it in,

1380
01:24:24.010 --> 01:24:29.010
dividing up 380 of it and fucking given it to three different women and then

1381
01:24:29.581 --> 01:24:32.440
he'd go down to the fucking hot dog truck and buying you dinner.

1382
01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:37.150
You had dumped fuck,
you know,
put a shirt on and get your shit together.

1383
01:24:37.210 --> 01:24:40.810
I don't know.
I would just say mean shit.
Don't listen to me.

1384
01:24:40.811 --> 01:24:44.470
That for the first part of my advice was good.
But uh,
yeah.
Try to find a,

1385
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.600
I dunno,
you know what,
talk to somebody else for the second half.
All right.

1386
01:24:49.601 --> 01:24:51.730
I'm not Deepak Chopra,
but I,
I got,

1387
01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:55.420
I think the first half of the advice I gave you was good.
All right.
So that's it.

1388
01:24:55.421 --> 01:24:58.240
You're doing the right thing.
There you go.
Something positive.
All right,

1389
01:24:58.330 --> 01:25:02.290
next question.
Hey Bill.
Um,
since you're pretty big sports fan,

1390
01:25:02.291 --> 01:25:06.160
I was wondering what we are opinion.
What was your opinion of soccer?

1391
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.360
Um,
I'm not much of a fan.
I basically only watched some of the World Cup,

1392
01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.800
but today at the restaurant I was watching Brazil versus USA game.

1393
01:25:15.070 --> 01:25:19.210
And a few of my Brazilian coworkers,
um,
we're watching the game.

1394
01:25:19.210 --> 01:25:21.190
And for the first task,
for the first half,

1395
01:25:21.191 --> 01:25:23.980
I had a blast watching the game because basically it got to play out the

1396
01:25:23.981 --> 01:25:26.440
stereotypical over the top clueless American.

1397
01:25:26.770 --> 01:25:31.510
They would just dying inside when the u s scored a the first two goals and I got

1398
01:25:31.511 --> 01:25:36.010
to fuck with them.
I was yelling shit like a throw the flag.
Uh,

1399
01:25:36.011 --> 01:25:40.420
I'll tell you what Brazil needs to do.
They should call a timeout and regroup.

1400
01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:43.600
And then my coworkers were taking me serious,

1401
01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:47.410
furiously telling me that there are no timeouts and soccer.
Oh,

1402
01:25:47.411 --> 01:25:51.460
that's great dude.
They should call a fucking timeout.

1403
01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:56.620
I'll tell you,
there's nothing more fun than playing up the ignorant America.

1404
01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:57.640
You know,

1405
01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:01.300
that's the greatest thing you can do when you go to Europe and they start giving

1406
01:26:01.301 --> 01:26:04.440
you shit that you don't know anything about their and brace it.

1407
01:26:05.190 --> 01:26:05.440
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1408
01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:08.470
<v 2>And just be like,
yeah,
dude,
I gotta be honest.</v>

1409
01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:12.140
Nobody talks about your country and my country,
we have,

1410
01:26:12.141 --> 01:26:15.120
we know who the fuck you guys are.
What do,

1411
01:26:15.130 --> 01:26:17.830
I can't believe you're not all walking around a wooden shoes over here.

1412
01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:22.570
You guys have cars,
you know,
just fucking play it up.
All right.
Anyways,

1413
01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:25.540
he said in my coworkers were taking me seriously.

1414
01:26:25.541 --> 01:26:28.360
If you're a c telling me they don't want a time out.
And he said,

1415
01:26:28.361 --> 01:26:32.200
once the US scored the second goal,
I yelled,
what are the odds?

1416
01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:35.170
I'd say about a Brazilian to one

1417
01:26:37.930 --> 01:26:41.290
dude.
I actually wish I was there to see that you really sign up noxious.

1418
01:26:41.291 --> 01:26:44.530
That must've been great is then he goes,
he goes,
but then in the long run,
uh,

1419
01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:49.000
they ended up giving me shit because a,
as I was watching the game,
um,

1420
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:54.260
I was thinking,
why,
why not have Brazil take a,
Oh,
this is,

1421
01:26:54.261 --> 01:26:56.930
this is a big conspiracy theory.
He goes,
but as I was watching the game,

1422
01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:01.700
I thought it was something that,
uh,
I'm amazed that the F F I f a

1423
01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:06.650
didn't arrange us to make it happen.
I was thinking,

1424
01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:11.600
why not have Brazil take a dive against the u s but you know,
make it look good.

1425
01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:13.910
And then the next year when the World Cup came around,

1426
01:27:13.911 --> 01:27:16.970
the interest in the US would be through the roof,
you know,

1427
01:27:16.971 --> 01:27:21.620
let the u s beat Brazil and then you,
uh,
you spit out a bunch of t shirts,

1428
01:27:21.621 --> 01:27:24.740
you split them 50,
50,
with the Brazilian,
you know,
the whole,

1429
01:27:24.741 --> 01:27:27.440
we kick Brazilians ass,
uh,

1430
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:31.160
Brazil's acid in 15 years when everyone has forgot about the game.

1431
01:27:31.161 --> 01:27:32.420
That's when you make the movie.

1432
01:27:33.370 --> 01:27:33.660
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1433
01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:35.550
<v 2>What do you think about the idea of bill?
Well,</v>

1434
01:27:35.551 --> 01:27:38.490
I think if I read it a little bit better when it made more sense,

1435
01:27:38.970 --> 01:27:41.640
you think it would have worked?
Um,
yeah,

1436
01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:45.830
I think we beat Brazil and the u s team started,
uh,
building up,

1437
01:27:48.210 --> 01:27:49.350
you know,
something.
Actually,

1438
01:27:49.351 --> 01:27:52.020
I don't think it would have worked because those people down there takes soccer

1439
01:27:52.021 --> 01:27:56.340
way too seriously.
Brazil takes it really seriously,
but they're not like,

1440
01:27:56.610 --> 01:28:00.900
like Columbia or was it Columbia?
Like,
uh,
was it the Venezuelan team?

1441
01:28:00.901 --> 01:28:04.440
Somebody accidentally put the ball in their own net and the guy went home and he

1442
01:28:04.441 --> 01:28:09.180
got fucking machine guns,
like the fucking Saint Valentine's Day massacre,

1443
01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:10.973
you know?

1444
01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:12.160
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1445
01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:13.880
<v 2>Um,
so no,
I don't think it would work.</v>

1446
01:28:13.881 --> 01:28:17.600
I think would work in America because we don't give a fuck about soccer.

1447
01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.910
Um,
all right.
I think that's the end of the questions.

1448
01:28:20.911 --> 01:28:24.770
Did I have anything else here?
I'm a little disorganized.
Uh,

1449
01:28:25.970 --> 01:28:26.800
<v 3>yeah.</v>

1450
01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:27.610
<v 2>All right.
How about this?</v>

1451
01:28:27.610 --> 01:28:31.390
I bought a movie review and then I'm going to end this podcast because,
oh man,

1452
01:28:31.391 --> 01:28:35.920
I have to end it now.
This is too fucking lock.
I'll read one really quickly.
Uh,

1453
01:28:35.921 --> 01:28:39.910
the punisher movie review based on the marvel comic character Thomas Jane who

1454
01:28:39.911 --> 01:28:40.571
was in the midst,

1455
01:28:40.571 --> 01:28:44.320
the dream catcher and the thin red line stars is Frank Castle who was a former

1456
01:28:44.321 --> 01:28:46.240
green baret that becomes an FBI agent.

1457
01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:50.470
Castle has one last bus to make that vol stolen weapons.
And during the bus,

1458
01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:52.660
the son of a mob boss,
Howard St,

1459
01:28:52.661 --> 01:28:57.190
played by John Travolta is killed st wants vengeance son who got his son killed

1460
01:28:57.191 --> 01:29:00.250
and finds out the castle is one the one who caused saints son's death.

1461
01:29:00.490 --> 01:29:02.310
Not to spoil,
but shit happens.

1462
01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:07.580
And castle gets in his Camaro to fuck shit some shit up.

1463
01:29:08.370 --> 01:29:12.360
I give it two out of four stars.
It's a movie that tries to be a re realistic,

1464
01:29:12.361 --> 01:29:16.770
which is great compared to the over the top cliche acro action sequences and the

1465
01:29:16.771 --> 01:29:17.460
sequel.

1466
01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:22.460
It's definitely worth the rent or a purchasing as how it was $5 on DVD and $10

1467
01:29:22.801 --> 01:29:25.020
on Blu Ray at best buy or Walmart.

1468
01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:29.370
And there are two versions to three theatrical and the extended edition.

1469
01:29:29.371 --> 01:29:33.390
So this guy gives it two out of four stars basically saying the punisher is a

1470
01:29:33.391 --> 01:29:36.210
good rental.
All right.
And that's the podcast for this week.

1471
01:29:36.211 --> 01:29:39.540
I hope you guys enjoyed it.
Uh,
