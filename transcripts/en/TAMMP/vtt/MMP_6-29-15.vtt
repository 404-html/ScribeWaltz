00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.520
Hey,

It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.160
June 28th,
uh,
2015.
How you doing?
How,

3
00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:15.840

How are you?

4
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.770
How are fucking you?
Um,
I am completely burnt out.

5
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:22.380
I'm at the end of my tour right now and a,

6
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:25.680
I have to leave for my show in Tucson and exactly one hour.

7
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:29.760
So I'm going to do a half hour of this podcast and then do my show and then I'm

8
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.470
going to finish it up after the show.

9
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.440
So what you're basically going to have his stone sober.

10
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:39.441
Me Doing the first 30 minutes and then a slightly more slightly older,

11
00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:43.050
slightly wide.
They're slightly more buzzed.

12
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.933
Um,

13
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.500
Billy red face during the second half of the podcast because that's how this is

14
00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:52.350
going down and I have to be somewhere immediately.

15
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.370
Of course the second I fucking land cause that's how it works.

16
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.970
I'm in this business.
It's how it works out.
Why they owe.

17
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.670
You going to have a little breather there.
You're going to have a Brita.

18
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.480
Was this fucking Yank that right off the table?
But it could always be worse.

19
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:10.590
I could have absolutely nothing to do staring at a phone like that crazy bitch

20
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:11.970
in that movie.
The audition.

21
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.560
You guys ever see that bear with that and she was sticking the needles in that

22
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:17.394
fucker.

23
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.870
That's what you get for trying to bank some crazy actress,

24
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.520
you know,
if they're not sticking needles into your literally,
right.

25
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.380
Listen to me having the nerve to act like I'm on TV.
I'm even remotely sane.

26
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.270
Um,
so anyways,
uh,
this is the last night of the tour.

27
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:41.010
I want to thank everybody that has come out on this one and I want to thank Joe

28
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.010
Barton Nick for absolutely crushing it right up until a Wednesday.

29
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.940
Baker's field,
the last one and then fucking,
uh,

30
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.840
j law had came in after fucking Barton.
It gave me a strong seven innings.

31
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.490
I went to the bullpen,
you know,
he gave me six and two thirds.

32
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:02.580
Then he walked up the next pattern.
Then I brought in fucking brought in law,

33
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.920
had lie,
had crushed it and um,

34
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.440
it was a crazy week of shows them we did,
uh,
did someplace in the inland empire.

35
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.260
And a 98% of the people were cool there.

36
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:18.170
And then there was just some of the drunkest fucking animals I've ever been a

37
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.070
that I've been in front of in a while.

38
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.240
I'm talking like literally screaming and whistling during setups.

39
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.070
Like I wasn't even saying anything and I just be like,

40
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:28.530
well you know I've been doing standup for a while and something in the back of

41
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:33.090
his neck,
this fucking whistle and about what,
I don't know.

42
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.460
I felt like I was doing like a rock concert.

43
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.750
You know like when you listen to a live album and they'll end the song and one

44
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:43.290
of those mumble and jackass singer songwriters and be like,
you know,

45
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.760
we've been coming out here for a while and he'll,
he'll,
yeah.
It's like,
dude,

46
00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:48.600
he hasn't said anything.

47
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.200
He's on his way to the point and people are already screaming cause they're

48
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:53.040
fucking wasted.

49
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:57.990
So my apologies to the sober people who are at that show.

50
00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.130
That show was fucking,

51
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.220
<v 1>I'll be honest with you man.</v>

52
00:03:01.221 --> 00:03:05.140
That one was a lot of work with all those screaming and he was like 20 people

53
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.380
and they were in all different parts of the,
uh,

54
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:11.710
the venue and they were screaming and yelling and I finally snapped in the end.

55
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.140
And uh,
I dunno,
and I said a word I shouldn't have said,

56
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.890
you know what I mean?
And it's something the crowd like related to it.

57
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:23.680
And then it came up to me and they fucking gave me the tickets back and like,

58
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:25.250
who are you spending all this money?
You only would just,

59
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.650
and then through through the whole fucking tragedy of their life,
put it on me.

60
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:33.070
I didn't know what the fuck they were talking about,
you know?

61
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:35.200
And it's just one of those fucking things.
Once again,
it's like,
dude,

62
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:38.290
I talked about plane crashes,
I talked about sinking cruise ships.

63
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.250
I made fun of Bruce Gender,
so gender Bruce Jenner.

64
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.740
So I mean,
they just laughed at me.

65
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.150
So I mean technically it wasn't all of that offensive now was just the fucking

66
00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:53.350
thing that,
that,
that was,
that was about your fucking life.
And not only that,

67
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.360
I just said a word.
I didn't even do a bit on it.

68
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.190
I basically said to the guy in the crowd,
I said,
Dick,

69
00:03:58.191 --> 00:04:01.300
that guy was such a fucking moron.
I have 90 minutes to this guy.
If I snap.

70
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:04.510
I was like,
dude,
are you fucking retarded?
I never say that word.

71
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.260
And that night I happened to say in a moment of fucking ain't now obviously I'm

72
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:13.000
not making fun of fucking uh,
um,
whatever the fuck you supposed to say.

73
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:14.950
Mentally challenged people.
Why would ever do that?

74
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:17.110
And I've said in the past I didn't see these fucking people come up to me.

75
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.780
He showed the pervs you don't do the fucking,

76
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.410
show me a picture of their kid and just put the whole fucking thing on me.

77
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.000
And I wanna apologize to the next 40 people in line because I was processing

78
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.650
what the fuck just happened.
And then I got livid

79
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.360
the way they fucking handed me the tickets back.

80
00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:37.060
And I took them because I didn't know what they are saying.
Like,
Hey,

81
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.220
throw these things out.
You're a piece of shit.
And you know,
it's like,

82
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.120
it's like who,

83
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.120
if they're listening 100% I apologize and 100% go fuck yourself.

84
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.800
Let me guess.
Let me guess.
You never said anything fucked up,
right.

85
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.660
You never laughed at something you shouldn't have said.

86
00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:55.580
You never lost your temper and fucking said something.

87
00:04:55.581 --> 00:04:57.860
If you don't dump your whole fucking life on me like that,

88
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.610
like I'm the worst fucking person ever.
You know you are out of line.

89
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.390
And not only that,
once I realized what the fuck you were talking about,
I said,

90
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.050
oh my God,
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry that guy was yelling,
I shouldn't said it,

91
00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:12.630
blah blah.
And you just wouldn't accept it.
You wouldn't fucking accept it.
Yeah.

92
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.120
Had to have your moment so you know my apologies and fuck you.

93
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.400
So that was that night
anyways.
You know what I mean?

94
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.001
Let me do it.

95
00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:25.970
Some fucked up shit happen to me when I was a kid that I will not get into,

96
00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:28.310
but I've seen comic's joke about it.
I don't give a fuck.

97
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.910
I know they're not attacking me.
I know they don't.

98
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.570
They don't wish that misery on me.
Jesus fly.
I'm going to comedy show,

99
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.870
right?
It's Christ.
Every fucking week.
You guys call me a ginger?

100
00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:41.030
12 ways to Sunday.
I don't give a fuck.

101
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.090
Do I think you'll really hate me if you hated me?
You wouldn't be writing in.

102
00:05:44.091 --> 00:05:48.700
I get it.
You fucking around.
Yeah.
Sorry.

103
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.860
I had to get that out.
I was something I wasn't going to talk about,

104
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:51.820
but if they didn't talk about it,

105
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.730
be fucking flicking me in the back of my year for the rest of this podcast.

106
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:57.740
So anyways,
oh my God.

107
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.020
<v 0>I was only going like,
you know what?</v>

108
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:04.760
I'm never going out after a fucking show again.
That's how fucking awful.

109
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.740
That whole goddamn moment was.
All right.
I probably,

110
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.200
this is why I probably should've talked about that.
Cause now I'm fucking,

111
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.600
I dunno,
I wish I didn't say it.
Why the fuck did they have to come that night?

112
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:21.290
You know,
what are the fucking odds?
Why did that drunk have to be there?
You know,

113
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.080
if I just ended the show five minutes before,

114
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.240
I wouldn't have said he's just fucking kills you.
You know,
people,
just,
Abby,

115
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.960
everybody's got a fucking moment now.
You know what I mean?
It's like,
dude,

116
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:34.700
I'm fucking driving through this country.
Right,

117
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:36.680
and you just seen all the water out in California.

118
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:41.681
It is that it brutally low levels and you know,

119
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.110
old Tony Monsanto there,
I'll be the fuck you say Tony's fucking with the food.

120
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.770
None of these cunts running for president are going to talk about any of that.

121
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.820
It's all going to be like the level with which people are freaking out that gay

122
00:06:55.821 --> 00:06:59.240
people can now get get married.
Who gives a fuck,

123
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.920
who aren't like,
I don't understand people trying to protect,

124
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.280
you know,
what do they call it,

125
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:10.850
the sanctity of marriage or whatever these fucking morons that talking about.

126
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.571
It's like,
dude,

127
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:14.960
I don't know if you've noticed like 60% of them go down the shitter anyways.

128
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.333
You know what I mean?

129
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.190
Maybe these gay people be better at it than straight people in there.
They'll,

130
00:07:20.191 --> 00:07:24.180
they'll up the numbers,
right?
Oh,
those poor bastards.

131
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.090
Gay People.
God bless you.

132
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.510
But I don't think that you realize what you fucking walked into.

133
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.840
We want to do it to Jesus Christ.

134
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.110
You know what,
being married is like.

135
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.200
Being married is like going on a ride at six flags.
You know what I mean?

136
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.620
It's fun,
it's fucking exciting.

137
00:07:45.621 --> 00:07:50.060
But there's like a thesis fucking chance that one of the bolts is going to come

138
00:07:50.061 --> 00:07:52.190
off and you're going to go flying into the woods.

139
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.030
If I ever told you guys about that,
I don't go to,
I don't go to amusement parks.

140
00:07:56.031 --> 00:07:58.370
I absolutely refuse.
You know,

141
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.020
maybe you know Disney land I would go to,

142
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.660
I've gone to that.
But even then you go on space mountain,
you're like,

143
00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:09.260
how fucking old is this ride?
You know what I mean?

144
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.240
Just there's always something going on.
But you know,

145
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.690
I feel like the stationary ones are safer because you know where they're at.

146
00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:21.200
Those ones where they pick it up and put it down and then leave town,
you know,

147
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.040
you're still flow.

148
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.330
You flew into the bushes and the guy let's wrap it up and they get the fuck out

149
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:27.770
of there.
Um,

150
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.210
plus the wear and tear of putting them together and taking them down and

151
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:35.060
everything.
Ah Man,
why the fuck did that happen and show that fucking just,

152
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.560
it was a,
well,

153
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.390
that's the worst moment I've had as a comedian a long fucking time.
Cause I,

154
00:08:39.391 --> 00:08:42.200
I felt I really hurt those people and I didn't want to do that.

155
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:46.860
But then to the way they fucking,
you know,
ah,

156
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.870
just writing my dis the whole fucking thing.

157
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.320
And then it wasn't until I just wished in the moment it could have said that.

158
00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:57.600
So like plane or,
okay,
you're all right with that cruise ships.
You're okay.

159
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.690
Cruise ships sinking,
that's fine.
You know what I mean?

160
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.840
May tease and fucking Caitlyn Jenner.
That's fine.

161
00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:07.050
That's not that all of that's funny.
Right?
Oh,
I wish I had it.
I was,

162
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:10.590
you had a fucking video tape of them sitting in the crowd laughing at all of

163
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:15.180
that shit and that fucking moron.
That's what I should've called them.

164
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.710
That was the thing.
I wasn't even thinking about,
like,
you know,

165
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.290
mentally challenged kids when I said that,
I was basically just saying,
hey,

166
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.500
why are you being such a fucking cunt?
Right.

167
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.110
And then some feminists will come up to me.
Um,

168
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.890
I have one of those and it's called a vagina and fucking sticks to catch him

169
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:33.840
tickets back in my face.
Sorry.
Enlightened the fuck up.

170
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:36.450
How about that?
How about that?
If you're going to go to a comedy show,
if not,

171
00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:40.950
you know,
stay the fuck home.
Go Watch lifetime.
Um,
anyways,

172
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:41.970
I'm going to keep going back to that.

173
00:09:41.971 --> 00:09:45.060
I don't give a shit until I get it out of my fucking system.
So,
oh,

174
00:09:45.061 --> 00:09:49.650
Billy cardio went off the rails the last two days.
I stayed out late.

175
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:54.360
Um,
you know,
so people that I work with,
uh,
showed up when I was in Vegas.

176
00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:56.700
Surprise me.
They're like,
oh,
let's go out and get a cigar.
So I was like,

177
00:09:56.701 --> 00:10:00.480
all right.
So we went out and,
uh,
stayed out till like five in the morning.

178
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.750
And in the meantime,
my,
uh,
my,

179
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.370
my iPhone four s finally shit the bed,

180
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.220
you know,
Barnack was,
he had the forest and he finally switched to the sixth.

181
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.260
He was saying,
he goes,
dude,
once that battery starts cutting out,
you know,

182
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.290
it's going to get worse and worse and worse and finally fucking cut out.

183
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:24.090
And I plugged it in and I was getting nothing.
So,
you know,

184
00:10:24.091 --> 00:10:28.950
the lovely knee is like,
well,
we gotta get you a new phone.
So,
uh,

185
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.710
I went into Caesars,

186
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.660
Caesars palace next door where a,

187
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.050
they'd have all these beautiful shops and everything and all these fucking

188
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:42.150
animals walking in and out of them,
like make,
you know,

189
00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:44.970
shuffling around a fucking sweatpants.
So some guy,

190
00:10:44.971 --> 00:10:47.520
and there was like true religion pants and a tee shirt,

191
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.640
did not see any ed hardy shirts.
Ed Hardy shirts are gone.

192
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.150
I dunno what ocean they're floating in right now.

193
00:10:57.151 --> 00:10:59.820
I'm guessing the Indian Ocean for some fucking reason,

194
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.100
we can't dump it all in the Pacific.
Right.

195
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.910
I don't know where those fucking things are.
Um,

196
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.620
but I guarantee you when they do the,
uh,

197
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.540
the fast times at Ridgemont high or some shit or the dazed and confused of this

198
00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:15.240
error,
they're going to have people wearing those true religion jeans,

199
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:20.170
or maybe last decade,
I should say,
in the Ed hardy shirts telling you,
dude,

200
00:11:20.171 --> 00:11:25.110
that's why George Carlin,
another reason why George Carlin was a genius,
you know,

201
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:29.490
is if you notice most of his specials,
he wore just all black.
I mean,

202
00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:32.670
that's never going out of fucking style.
You know,

203
00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:35.640
he probably figured that out after he had his hippy dippy shit that he wore in

204
00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:38.370
the 70s.
You know what I mean?
Some of that stuff.

205
00:11:38.371 --> 00:11:41.070
And he started looking at it like,
oh my God,
do I get flowers at my jeans?

206
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.330
Why did I think that was cool?
Because everybody else did.

207
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.450
But they got rid of theirs and there's theirs videotape of you with yours on.

208
00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.920
So you look like the only asshole at warm,
you know?
So

209
00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:58.710
anyways,
uh,
I'm all over the fucking map here.
So,
uh,
dude,

210
00:11:58.711 --> 00:12:01.830
Bakersfield was tremendous.
Um,

211
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.700
trying to work my way back to think where the hell we were.
Oh,

212
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.350
I already talked about,
I keep forgetting that I do the Thursday podcast.

213
00:12:07.351 --> 00:12:11.160
So you already heard about that.
Uh,
playing the Fox theater and all of that.

214
00:12:11.161 --> 00:12:15.150
And obviously if Britain,
no Britain will grill forward.
We're fucking wrong.

215
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.860
You can open your [inaudible] will know bootcamp bureau.
Um,

216
00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.600
did that one.
And uh,

217
00:12:21.601 --> 00:12:25.710
then we did two nights at the Mirage and uh,

218
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.730
just had a fucking amazing time and um,

219
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.580
tremendous crowds and a,

220
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.880
so tonight's the last one down here in Tucson,
Arizona,

221
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.670
and it was like a seven hour drive down here.

222
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.120
We've got up at like 9:00 AM or something like that.

223
00:12:42.121 --> 00:12:45.670
Drove all the way down here and I gotta get you gotta drive out to a venue or at

224
00:12:45.671 --> 00:12:49.920
like six 45.
So I'm gonna try and get to as much.
Maybe I'll do 45 minutes.

225
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.740
Who knows?
Last 15,
you guys were all like,
Bill,
cut it off now.

226
00:12:52.741 --> 00:12:56.580
Get Shit faced and then do the rest of the podcast.
Um,

227
00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:57.700
<v 3>okay.</v>

228
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.880
<v 0>So anyways,
uh,
oh,
here's something,
you know,</v>

229
00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:05.440
it's a fucking pet peeve of mine and fucking,
uh,
I don't know if this is just

230
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:06.980
<v 3>okay</v>

231
00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.890
<v 0>about women or if it's casino women.
I have no idea.</v>

232
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:11.460
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

233
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.660
<v 0>But women who,
uh,</v>

234
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:17.580
at the end of the night take off the high heels because their feet hurt and they

235
00:13:17.581 --> 00:13:22.020
just start walking down the street and their bare feet or walking across the

236
00:13:22.021 --> 00:13:25.230
casino rug and their bare feet,
you know,

237
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:29.640
bottom of their feet all fucking dirty.
I was joking about that at the Mirage.

238
00:13:29.641 --> 00:13:31.800
I was like,
you know what?
You can't,
you can't marry that.

239
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.470
You can't marry that dude.
That's a quitter.
You know,
you,

240
00:13:35.471 --> 00:13:39.210
you couldn't make it till the last fucking 1500 yards up to your room.

241
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:44.130
You couldn't throw a pair of little flippy flops into your clutch or something

242
00:13:44.131 --> 00:13:46.710
like that.
What kind of a fucking animal?

243
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:48.290
<v 3>Okay.</v>

244
00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.930
<v 0>You know,
I could only imagine.
I know what women think.
Well,</v>

245
00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:54.620
if you had to walk around and those,
yeah.
You know,
I'd have some flip flops.

246
00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:58.940
I would,
there's no fucking way I would ever walk barefoot across the rough.

247
00:13:58.941 --> 00:14:03.830
People walk in and out of the fucking men's and ladies' room with God knows,

248
00:14:03.831 --> 00:14:05.540
you know what the fuck goes on in there?

249
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.920
Literally I shit shell a shit and piss show goes on in there.

250
00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.090
All kinds of bacteria and you're just walking barefoot through it like you're

251
00:14:14.091 --> 00:14:14.924
Christ.

252
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:16.900
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

253
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.470
<v 0>Jesus Christ.
You fucking girlfriends got to wash your feet when you come in.</v>

254
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:22.990
It just,
it just,
it's that to me,

255
00:14:22.991 --> 00:14:27.880
that takes a fucking 10 all the way down to about it.
Well,

256
00:14:27.881 --> 00:14:30.220
if we're just talking sex,
who's kidding who?
A nine and a half.

257
00:14:30.221 --> 00:14:33.040
But if we're talking about the mother of your children,
it's just,
it's done.

258
00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:35.410
It's a done fucking deal.
If she is an adult,

259
00:14:35.411 --> 00:14:36.760
if her feet are going to be that dirty,

260
00:14:36.761 --> 00:14:40.940
how filter your fucking kids fee's going to be?
Yeah.

261
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:45.160
You want to jump in on it?
Grab a microphone.
Um,

262
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.470
no,
like late at night that night we stayed out a Friday night and we ended up at

263
00:14:50.471 --> 00:14:53.640
the,
uh,
the Deli there trying to grab me a microphone here.

264
00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.260
Would that be in my bag?
Uh,
Christ,
I don't know where it is.

265
00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:03.210
My backpack.
Yes.
My pack that I put on my back.
Yeah.

266
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.820
Aka My backpack.
Um,
yeah,
me and Jay ended up in this,

267
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.820
they got like this Carnegie Deli or Carnegie,

268
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.850
depending if you're from the east coast or the Midwest.

269
00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:19.830
I've noticed that in Pittsburgh.
It's always Carnegie East Coast.

270
00:15:19.831 --> 00:15:23.390
It's Carnegie.
Oh,
traveling.
Um,

271
00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.020
so we were there and these two girls got into this who didn't have shoes on,

272
00:15:28.021 --> 00:15:31.800
kind of gotten to this drunk and like sort of have a little fucking play fight.

273
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.280
So one of them kind of falls down and her legs go up in the air,

274
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.050
like right up over the booth.

275
00:15:37.051 --> 00:15:39.200
And I was standing there waiting to order and I just saw her,

276
00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:44.540
the filthy soles of her feet.
And uh,
it just,

277
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.320
I,
I can't say it made me lose my appetite at all.
I'm just,

278
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.060
I'm just babbling here cause you know what I'm doing.

279
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.160
I'm trying to find the other fucking microphone.

280
00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.730
I know Brian and you know we brought it,

281
00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:01.020
cause you brought it in for you.
There it is.

282
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.560
Nope.
All right,
so it's down here.
Here it is.
Ah,
there it is.

283
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.360
[inaudible] is this an entertaining podcast?

284
00:16:06.361 --> 00:16:10.650
This podcast is now been renamed to people looking for a microphone.
Yeah.

285
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.210
So Ne when we finally get this hooked up ever Deli,

286
00:16:14.211 --> 00:16:18.080
you're going to weigh in on this.
I want to wait.
Yeah,
you want to weigh in on it?

287
00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.700
Do you want to have your 2 cents?
Yes,
please.
Hey,

288
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.380
it's Donald Trump and knocked out of the ratio.

289
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.700
I'm really rooting that he stays in the longest,
so,

290
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.660
so he can just be continued to be the most entertaining person on it cause

291
00:16:30.661 --> 00:16:31.930
everybody else is going to go out.

292
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.570
<v 1>Sure.
Ha ha ha ha.
Oh Andrew.</v>

293
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:39.140
<v 0>Okay,
Sean,
we got,
uh,
we got to do things.
Oh yeah.
Hang on one second.</v>

294
00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:41.870
Let's see what we got here.
All right.
Check,
check,
check,
check.

295
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:46.850
<v 1>Two,
two,
two,
check.
All right,
so what,
what are your feelings?
No,
I want it.
Yeah.</v>

296
00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:51.690
Talking about the,
uh,
dirty,
dirty feet bitches.
Yeah.
Here's the thing.
I,

297
00:16:51.691 --> 00:16:55.740
I agree with you.
DB BS.
If you can feel your heels,

298
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:57.740
you don't need to be wearing them.

299
00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.590
That's really the bottom line and I know you want to look cute.

300
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.850
I want to look you.
I want to wear hi sexy,
gorgeous heels.

301
00:17:04.851 --> 00:17:08.210
They make my legs and ask amazing.
Want to be looking cute,

302
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.030
but if you can't handle it,
you need to not wear them.

303
00:17:14.031 --> 00:17:16.390
You need to save your highest sexiest,

304
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.840
but most like God damn looking shoes that shows off your pedicure when you have

305
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:25.130
a date or whatever,
when you're getting picked up and you go in the car,

306
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.040
in the restaurant,
back in the car,
back to the crib,

307
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.040
otherwise you don't need to be wearing.
If you're going out dancing,

308
00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:34.670
you need to find some cute shoes that are a lower heel that you can dance in and

309
00:17:34.671 --> 00:17:38.690
you can walk in.
We don't look crazy because I can't stand that either.

310
00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:41.420
Whenever I see a woman walking around with their bare feet,

311
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.700
I want to scream at them like,
don't just don't do anything.
You know what?

312
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:52.020
Don't do it.
And also save your feet.
Be Smart.
It's not worth it.

313
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.120
It's really not worth it.
Looking like,

314
00:17:55.770 --> 00:18:00.770
what's the word I wanna use a trashy mess tracing through the casino with no

315
00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:04.180
shoes on.
You know what else is great?
And that was one.

316
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.310
They take the shoes off and that just now they look like this little stumpy

317
00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:12.900
person in the short dress and the illusion of all the other women.
You're like,

318
00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:16.230
oh my God,
look how along those legs are you really start doing the math.

319
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.120
You start knocking off a few inches.

320
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:22.050
I have shoes that I wear if I'm going to a con.

321
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.720
Well see the thing is I feel like if I go to a concert,

322
00:18:24.721 --> 00:18:27.780
I'm not doing that standing room shit cause I'm too old for it anyway.

323
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.041
But I have,
shoot,

324
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:31.410
if I'm going out and I'm going to get a copy and I say that I'm not,

325
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:34.730
I wouldn't marry someone that takes their shoes off.
That's a lock.
The door test.

326
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.090
That's
the lock the door.

327
00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.420
You are you talking about the car door thing from a Bronx tale.

328
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.570
One of your girlfriends are,
they take the shoes off.
People know dirt.

329
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:48.270
You don't do it.
Do you have any old dirty finger in your crew now?

330
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:52.200
I don't have any dirty feet bitches in my career.
I keep them on.

331
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.770
Or you don't wear them seriously though.
Oh,
there you go.

332
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.910
So why the hell would you fucking marry that and have a kid?
Well,
I don't know.

333
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.950
I don't know.
He needs to make the leap from you.

334
00:19:03.951 --> 00:19:07.930
Take off your shoes to equals.
I'm not going to marry you.
That's,

335
00:19:07.931 --> 00:19:11.880
that's a bit of a,
that's a bit of a stretch on breathable.
Unbreakable.

336
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.920
Yeah,
you're done.
I'm not,
I might,
I might have to add that into the fucking act.

337
00:19:16.921 --> 00:19:18.480
As far as like the people that,
you know,
when I,

338
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.540
when I'm doing my cleanse of the population,

339
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.110
so the water supply stays where it needs to be.
Oh,

340
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.040
that would be another person I would get rid of women who take their shoes off

341
00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.070
when the final 10% of the night or content to walk down a public fucking street.

342
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.070
Also when their bare feet,
why don't you put in inserts,

343
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.460
installs into your shoes?
I have insoles and all of my heels,

344
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.080
they get the clear ones.

345
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.220
The doctor Scholl's I know you feel like an old lady going into that section,

346
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:50.640
but I have them in every single pair of heels because,
and even still,

347
00:19:50.641 --> 00:19:53.060
they hurt my fucking feet.
Tom.
Neil,

348
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.370
why would they go out and something you're asking them,

349
00:19:56.371 --> 00:19:59.100
why don't they do something smart?
Yeah.

350
00:19:59.101 --> 00:20:02.070
Well maybe Tom who kind of fucking proud.
I don't give a shit.

351
00:20:02.071 --> 00:20:05.400
If I was wearing snow shoes when we went to no fucking way,
I wouldn't,
I would,

352
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:09.180
I would take those off and walked barefoot across the casino once the Michael

353
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.180
Jackson.
So those shoes that I was weighing,
gorgeous,
amazing,

354
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.340
hurt my seem like a bit expensive.

355
00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:19.320
I put the insulin OIM unnecessary will hurt and I stuck it out.

356
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.770
I stuck at fucking now cause I had committed myself to wearing them and I wasn't

357
00:20:22.771 --> 00:20:25.410
going to quit and I wasn't going to look like one of those girls because that's

358
00:20:25.411 --> 00:20:30.250
messy.
Sloppy.
You don't want to look like that pop up,
up,
up,
up,
up,
up,
up,
up.

359
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:35.160
Yeah.
I rocky that shit.
Boom.
Nini,

360
00:20:35.161 --> 00:20:39.600
boom.
Yeah.
Let's take it,
deal with it.
And if you can't hang then down.
By the way,

361
00:20:39.601 --> 00:20:44.040
Michael Jackson show was amazing.
Amazing.

362
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:48.050
Even with the school we do kids.
That was weird.
I it was for the kids,

363
00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.150
but I don't want to ruin the show.

364
00:20:50.151 --> 00:20:53.750
But at one point I challenge any person to go to that show.

365
00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.140
And at some point you're not.
They could just put on the fucking hat.

366
00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:02.960
Just put on the fucking hat.
I that musical theater low eve.

367
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:08.180
I get it.
That hat has power.
Put it on.
And who your fucking dance already?

368
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.810
Jesus Christ.
It's a Cirque du Soleil show.
It's called one.

369
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.500
It's tremendous.
Please go see this show and I challenge you not to.

370
00:21:15.501 --> 00:21:20.150
Time magazine says,
all right,
I'm going to talk about lacking that.
Cried.

371
00:21:20.151 --> 00:21:22.820
I want to talk about hockey.
Oh,
so this is the part where I dip out,
right?

372
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.660
And this is part where I,
so thank you for not being a dirty feet,
bitch.

373
00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:28.753
I love you too.

374
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:35.580
<v 0>Fucking animals.
Um,
so anyways,</v>

375
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:40.020
uh,
oh,
let's Talk Nhl hockey here.
Jesus Christ,

376
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:45.000
the Bruins are,
are,
are going through a whole fucking rebuild here.

377
00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:47.141
I,
you know,

378
00:21:47.141 --> 00:21:50.700
what are the only reason why Douggie Hamilton getting traded did not shock me

379
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.930
was because the first half of this tour I,
I was,

380
00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.530
I was working with Joe Barton.
Nick,
who knows as much about hockey,

381
00:21:58.531 --> 00:22:03.420
is anybody on the NHL Channel and he was saying like,
uh,

382
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:04.470
<v 3>okay.</v>

383
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.000
<v 1>He was just doing his bart nick thing,</v>

384
00:22:06.001 --> 00:22:08.280
just saying like they should get rid of Doug Hamilton.

385
00:22:08.281 --> 00:22:11.160
He's too much of a hit on the cap.
You want to keep McQuaid.

386
00:22:11.161 --> 00:22:14.330
He's a stay at home guy on defense.
He sticks up for his teammate.

387
00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.940
Every team in the NHL is looking for a guy like Adam McQuaid.

388
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.850
That's the guy you keep,
Doug,
he's too soft,
blah,
blah,
blah.

389
00:22:20.851 --> 00:22:22.740
And I was just sitting the guy,
I like him,
he's kind of offensive,

390
00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:25.520
but everything that he fucking said and the guy gets shipped off to

391
00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.740
<v 0>Calgary,
I still loved them,</v>

392
00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.720
but I never saw them trading Luci.

393
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.980
<v 1>I mean I,
that guy,
he,
he's the fucking locomotive.</v>

394
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:40.100
He's the toughest guy in our fucking team,
and now he's gone.

395
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:42.260
<v 3>Okay.</v>

396
00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.000
<v 0>Like,
come on</v>

397
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.890
<v 1>Cheech going down,
crashing the fucking net.
Who's going to do that now?</v>

398
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:52.680
<v 0>You know,
putting Ryan Miller and his place.
Who's going to do that now?
Sorry.</v>

399
00:22:52.681 --> 00:22:54.000
Buffalo fans.
I'm fucking with you.

400
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:57.390
I know he got frustrated because he thought he had a breakaway and it bounced

401
00:22:57.391 --> 00:22:59.400
over his stick.
So he acted a little child.
Is there,

402
00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:04.050
who's going to stab someone in the balls when we need them to?
Sorry,

403
00:23:04.051 --> 00:23:05.940
I'm actually bringing up his worst thing.
Other than that.
Yeah,

404
00:23:05.941 --> 00:23:06.840
he's a fucking force.

405
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:12.240
So now he goes to the kinks and to me,
once again,

406
00:23:12.241 --> 00:23:14.790
the West is way more fucking interesting than the east.

407
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.180
How will Chicago respond?

408
00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:19.570
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

409
00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.380
<v 0>to that force of nature.
That is Milan Lucita cheats.
That's now at the kings.</v>

410
00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:26.170
The only thing I liked about the trade is I live in La.

411
00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.230
So it's yet another reason to go see that great team,

412
00:23:29.231 --> 00:23:32.350
even though they didn't make the playoffs last year.
So,
um,

413
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.970
all I will say about this is I hope the Bruins,
no,
it that doing,

414
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.450
it's the exact same thing I said about the patriots a couple of years ago when

415
00:23:40.451 --> 00:23:41.560
they stayed,
they did it know,

416
00:23:41.561 --> 00:23:43.750
I can't remember who the fuck they traded and I was just like,

417
00:23:43.751 --> 00:23:47.390
I hope they know what they're doing.
And uh,

418
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:52.220
evidently they did because we just won a Superbowl.
So,
um,

419
00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.100
you know,
at the end of the day when I'm a fucking comedian,

420
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.490
what do I know about building a Goddamn team?
I'll tell you right now,

421
00:23:58.491 --> 00:24:00.290
I didn't like us getting rid of our GM.

422
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:03.470
The guy obviously did a great fucking job.
We won a Stanley Cup.

423
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:07.940
He makes one stupid comment and everybody listens to Dan Shaughnessy who doesn't

424
00:24:07.941 --> 00:24:11.990
watch hockey on any level.
I don't give a shit.
They need to make a move.

425
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.590
Does Dan Shaughnessy even write articles anymore to see?

426
00:24:15.591 --> 00:24:18.870
Just take like fucking old articles he's already written a thousand times and

427
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:23.620
just pull fucking words out and put new new players names in there.

428
00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.530
I riff on that guy too much.
You know what I mean?
I rip on it too much,

429
00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:30.510
but the only time it really bugs me is when he fucking

430
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.790
is,
when he,
when he trashes the Bruins,
it's like,
dude,

431
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:36.090
you don't even know what the fuck you talking.
I mean,

432
00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:40.850
he want you to God damn splinter ring.
So just shut up.
Anyways.
Um,

433
00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:46.310
oh dude.
So we pull in here to a Tucson,
Tucson,

434
00:24:46.311 --> 00:24:50.480
Arizona,
and uh,
we're driving down the street.

435
00:24:50.481 --> 00:24:55.250
We're a little bit lost and we get into this shit part of fucking town,

436
00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:56.893
you know?

437
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.330
And we're driving down the street and this fucking white trash looking dude

438
00:25:02.331 --> 00:25:05.990
walking up the street just gives the finger to the buses.
We drive by

439
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:13.940
low.
Let's go and you see that guy?
He's given us the finger.

440
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.090
What's it giving us the finger for?
It's like Jesus,
Jay,
do the math.

441
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:21.380
Look at the neighborhood.
What do you think?
Fuck you.
Fix it up and,

442
00:25:21.381 --> 00:25:24.410
and he's blaming his whole fucking life on us rather than whatever.

443
00:25:24.411 --> 00:25:29.270
Guide them into that situation.
Be it racism or whatever.
Why Not Racism?

444
00:25:29.271 --> 00:25:34.010
He's white.
I don't know what the fuck it was,
but it wasn't a bus fucking bus.

445
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:37.100
Um,
I'm not going to lie to you.
Made me really uncomfortable.
I was like,
oh,

446
00:25:37.101 --> 00:25:38.930
should we be driving through here in this thing?

447
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:42.480
Maybe we should take I fucking taxi.
Um,

448
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.450
anyway,
so,
uh,
so here we are.
We've got one,
like,

449
00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:50.270
I read some of this fucking advertising.
Was it six 15?

450
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.460
It's one of the great things about being a guy.

451
00:25:52.461 --> 00:25:56.720
He take a shower and like fucking three minutes shake off like a Goddamn Hound,

452
00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:01.370
right?
Poor women got to go in there,
you know,
putting on all like clown makeup,

453
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.730
put on their shoes.
I'm going to make it a feet fucking cart.
You know,

454
00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:09.890
it's a lot of advantages.
All right,
here we go.
Hey,

You can watch all nine seasons of Seinfeld with your Hulu subscription.

463
00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:45.690
Um,
speaking
of that,
I was actually watching some,
uh,

464
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:50.390
comedians in cars getting coffee and watched,
uh,

465
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:51.360
the Jay Leno one,

466
00:26:51.361 --> 00:26:55.010
which you knew it was going to be great because he knows all about cars and heat

467
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.010
and then what was called tool.

468
00:26:56.011 --> 00:26:59.580
It was also like stand up history when you know that guy came up like when there

469
00:26:59.581 --> 00:27:02.340
weren't comedy clubs.
So he,

470
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.250
you're not going to beat that guy when it comes to like hell gigs.

471
00:27:05.251 --> 00:27:06.990
Like I went on after like strippers and shit.

472
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:10.620
So he was talking about working the playboy club and how this guy would sit

473
00:27:10.621 --> 00:27:15.030
there and watch you and grade your act and then send the report card to Hugh

474
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:18.360
Hefner.
I mean,
who knows if he actually did it,
but he put the fear of God in you.

475
00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.900
And then he had a story about doing a private Gig,

476
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.150
some Sinatra Gig,

477
00:27:24.151 --> 00:27:29.100
and there was a real life famous gangster in the crowd and uh,

478
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.930
it was just like,
Jesus,
this guy caught the tail end of the Goodfella years.

479
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.590
So it's a real,
I highly recommend that one.
Um,

480
00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:42.550
I know I watched like three of them to Jason Alexander.
One was cool and uh,

481
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:47.430
all the Howard stern one was great.
The Howard Stern one was great.

482
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:53.070
Um,
so anyways,
so that's his other show.

483
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.100
So you gotta watch this and Seinfeld was also nice enough to have me on the
show,

484
00:27:56.101 --> 00:27:57.210
which was an unbelievable honor.

485
00:27:57.211 --> 00:28:02.190
So he wanted to do the podcast to solid a checkout the Seinfeld series on Hulu.

486
00:28:02.191 --> 00:28:04.590
Okay.
Dollar Shave Club.
Everybody,

487
00:28:04.591 --> 00:28:07.530
some of you out there who still haven't joined dollar shave club,

488
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.820
what's the issue?
People once the deal,
these guys are awesome.
Seriously.

489
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.160
And you've heard me talking about them for years now.

490
00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:15.930
Their razors really are amazing.

491
00:28:15.931 --> 00:28:18.990
It's more convenient and cost a fraction of the price if you still not getting

it.
Here's how the club works.

495
00:28:31.531 --> 00:28:33.480
human being.
You've got to shave your back.

496
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:38.510
Get the God damn six blade executive and get a close friend that can deal with

497
00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:42.930
driving that thing.

Um,

498
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.920

499
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.350
Um,
you get your first box in about a week.

500
00:28:52.351 --> 00:28:55.050
It includes a free handle and a sleeve of blade cartridges.

501
00:28:55.051 --> 00:28:57.960
It's high quality stuff.
Got that weight to it.
Everybody,

502
00:28:57.961 --> 00:29:00.480
like the expensive ones you've used before.

503
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:05.490
The humble twin has to stainless steel blades and an aloe strip.
It's all unique.

504
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.550
You've never gotten a shave like this.
After that first box.

505
00:29:08.551 --> 00:29:12.000

506
00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:15.390
however you want to do it.

I get credit for it.
Doesn't cost you any money whatsoever.

535
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:06.110
And they kicked me a little bit of cash for fucking driving traffic there.

536
00:31:06.111 --> 00:31:10.130
And then I give it,
give some of it,
I should say a portion of the proceeds.

537
00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:15.890
You know,
I try to give to a fucking charity and then I say what the charity is.

538
00:31:15.891 --> 00:31:18.530
And I do that for six months and everybody tells me it's a scam.

539
00:31:18.531 --> 00:31:19.790
And then I try to find another one.

540
00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:25.610
So right now I do it for St Jude as far as I can tell,
they're on the up and up.

541
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:30.260
All right,
so there you go.
Ah,
that's 31 minutes.

542
00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:35.430
31 minutes in.
All right,
so right now I'm going to hit pause and I'm going to go,

543
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.410
fuck that.
I can keep going here,
right?
Can I keep going?
No,
I should get off.

544
00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:44.030
Ah,
she's saying to get off the horn.
Wait a minute.
Oh my God.

545
00:31:44.031 --> 00:31:48.000
This is fucking maniac.
Jesus Christ.
You know,

546
00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.170
do people know how to be in a fucking show?

547
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:54.830
Certain people you hook up the fucking cool other people you'll hook up and then

548
00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:59.630
I'm here.
Now I'm here.
Oh No,
I'm calling your phone.
Is Everything gonna be okay?

549
00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:04.580
Relax.
Okay.
Tickets going to be there.
You're going to sit there,

550
00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.700
right?
Your wife's going to take off your shoes.
Get a feed all dirty.

551
00:32:07.701 --> 00:32:11.060
You're gonna slam a couple of fucking scotches and I'm going to get up there and

552
00:32:11.061 --> 00:32:13.850
do a little fucking clown dance for you.
All right.

553
00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:18.270
It's fucking an hour and 40 minutes before the show.
I still,

554
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.310
I haven't even put my red nose on yet.

555
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:26.910
Oh,
I was all Billy sport coats Saturday night in Vegas.

556
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:31.680
Came out there with a pocket square and everything and I actually stuck it out

557
00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:37.440
and I wore that jacket for the whole show.
Oh my God.
This motherfucker.
Um,

558
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.860
and I wore the jacket for whole show even though it was starting to get hot.

559
00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:41.551
The only,
actually,

560
00:32:41.551 --> 00:32:44.880
the only real reason why I didn't take it off was because I had a white shirt

561
00:32:44.881 --> 00:32:49.650
underneath it and I'm pasty as fuck.
And uh,
you know,

562
00:32:49.651 --> 00:32:50.640
I didn't want to,
you know,

563
00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:54.570
I want to be up there looking like a head on top of a fucking candle stick.

564
00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.040
Um,
so anyways,
oh by the way,

565
00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:04.590
if you just end to working out,

566
00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:09.570
you know that Michael Jackson show those Cirque du Solei people are fucking

567
00:33:09.571 --> 00:33:13.800
unbelievable.
This one guy,
he does a routine on this rope,

568
00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.290
climbing this rope up and down the fucking thing,

569
00:33:16.291 --> 00:33:19.590
80 80 fucking different ways for a whole song.

570
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.850
If you can go up a climb rope,
climbing rock,

571
00:33:23.851 --> 00:33:28.440
climbing up a climbing rope and come back down using your feet,
you know,

572
00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:32.160
that's impressive.
If you could do it without using your feet,

573
00:33:32.161 --> 00:33:33.240
that's even more impressive.

574
00:33:33.241 --> 00:33:35.580
But what this guy was doing was just on a whole other level.

575
00:33:35.581 --> 00:33:40.530
And then the biggest beast of the show was this one woman who came out and was

576
00:33:40.531 --> 00:33:41.970
basically,
uh,

577
00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.960
one of the strongest human beings I've ever seen in my life.

578
00:33:45.961 --> 00:33:48.450
She was doing stuff that just defied

579
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.970
even some of the stuff,
like I've seen that,
um,

580
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.690
like you ever see those guys like,
dude,
like the human flag,

581
00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:02.000
and then they'll do like this.
This woman did all of that and she would do it.

582
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.940
So for like five minute chunks,
she did,
she didn't do it.

583
00:34:04.941 --> 00:34:07.280
And that's how you do the human flag.
And then that's it.

584
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:11.300
She'd be in that position for like 20 seconds and then go into something even

585
00:34:11.301 --> 00:34:15.410
harder.
I remember her for finishing fucking move.

586
00:34:15.411 --> 00:34:20.060
She's upside down on,
on,
you know,
I guess it's called a Stripper Pole,

587
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.100
you know?
But what she did was so artistic.

588
00:34:22.101 --> 00:34:25.610
We'll just say it was like a street sign,
Paul,
just to give her some class there.

589
00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:29.360
Um,
Paul Dancing.
All right.
There you go.
Whatever.

590
00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:35.020
So she fucking was upside down in a full split with no hands.

591
00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:42.680
Does that thing with you just sort of let yourself slide down the pole and then

592
00:34:42.681 --> 00:34:47.180
you stop yourself when people do that with their hands.
That's amazing.

593
00:34:47.181 --> 00:34:52.181
She did it upside down in a split and she did it with their legs and a smile on

594
00:34:52.401 --> 00:34:55.130
her face that never betrayed any sort of pain.

595
00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:59.870
It was the greatest display of a,
I dunno,

596
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:05.030
she was unbelievable.
She was unfucking believable pick.
Oh,

597
00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.410
I can't say what I was just going to say.

598
00:35:06.411 --> 00:35:09.930
I would say pictures so and so in a bikini,
but now that would've been bad.
Um,

599
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.820
anyways.
All right.
That's it for silver bill.

600
00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:17.320
Hang in there and through the magic of editing,

601
00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:20.470
I will be back in about two seconds and I'll be a little bit happier.

602
00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:25.060
Maybe a little more horse than the voice and definitely a lot more.
Uh,

603
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:27.370
well I'm not buzzed at all right now.
I'll have a couple of fucking,

604
00:35:27.371 --> 00:35:31.420
I'll throw down a couple of whatever.
Alright.
Go Fuck Yourself.

605
00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:32.283
I've talked to in a minute.

606
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:40.620
Ah,
right.
Bagged a magical mystery tour.

607
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.840
His cubby to take you a wedding one.

608
00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:47.670
It's in my fucking head and now I'm not drunk.
I've had two bud lights,
you know,

609
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:52.350
I might as well had some reason Brent.
It's such a weak fucking beer.
Um,

610
00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:53.011
all right.

611
00:35:53.011 --> 00:35:57.880
So I did the last show and a great crowd and all that type of shit.

612
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:02.850
They had a wonderful time in this conference room and a thank you to everybody

613
00:36:02.851 --> 00:36:06.840
who came out to the shows and everybody came out to the tour.
Um,

614
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:11.920
and uh,
you know,
and I would leave it at that cause a,
yeah.
Yeah.

615
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:16.890
How do I not say it?
I can't,
he was there,
you know,
they were having a,
yeah,

616
00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:20.470
they were having one of those days down there.
I can't say it.

617
00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:26.610
Yeah,
I a wait,
what are you going to fucking do?
I don't,
you know,

618
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:30.510
that's not the way you go about it.

619
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:35.370
I sit there and I act like everything was fine.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

620
00:36:35.371 --> 00:36:38.450
You're not jumping on this talking that shit.
I'm not going to talk shit.
Yeah,

621
00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:41.800
you are.
No,
no,
I'm not.
I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it.
Shush.

622
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:46.740
The man has spoken and he said,
woman,
Shush.
Oh,
Geez.
All right,

623
00:36:46.741 --> 00:36:50.100
let's get into the fucking questions here.
All right.
Oh,
class ain't,
yeah.
Yeah.

624
00:36:50.101 --> 00:36:51.750
You know what?
I'm going to send one of those days.
You know,

625
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:55.830
it's still one of those things.
That's why everything's all fucked up.
All right.

626
00:36:55.831 --> 00:37:00.090
Jack Williams.
Jack Williams,
Billy Lansdowne street.

627
00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:04.320
Not sure if you heard this.
Yeah,
right down near family.

628
00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:07.830
Back in the day.
You wouldn't go down there at night.

629
00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:12.090
Now you can skip down the street.
You can law.

630
00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:16.890
I love Lansdowne Street.
It's a hang out there during college.
Alright.

631
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.740
Wbz for Boston news anchor.

632
00:37:19.741 --> 00:37:24.600
Jack Williams retired this week.
Wow.
I,
you know,

633
00:37:24.601 --> 00:37:26.280
I'm afraid to see how old he is.

634
00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.860
That's going to make me feel even fucking older than okay.

635
00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:33.540
Can you please give a short speech about him as though you were at his

636
00:37:33.541 --> 00:37:37.980
retirement party
that is retire parties.

637
00:37:37.981 --> 00:37:42.570
I'd be half in the bag.
Yeah.
Why?
Say something can wake up people.

638
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.040
Jack Williams fucking Jack.

639
00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:49.320
I love you man.

640
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:54.480
We'll bold red heads in this business.

641
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.690
I used to watch you when I was a kid and you were 40 itself.
You will his walker.

642
00:37:58.691 --> 00:37:59.910
I had a great rapport.

643
00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:04.020
You always had a great sense of humor and that stuff you did for the kids.

644
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:08.400
Wednesday's child,
the gaze.
Just,
I love that guy.
I can't believe he's retired.

645
00:38:08.401 --> 00:38:10.350
That guy.
I mean,
I'm not an athlete.
Comes to retirement party.

646
00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:14.130
That guy was the best,
is the best total professional.

647
00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:19.540
And he was funny as hell.
He had a great sense of humor.
Um,
then the bed,

648
00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:23.070
I used to watch some way back in the day,
it was Jack Williams,

649
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:27.300
Liz Walker and Bob Lubell did the sports and that was it.

650
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:31.830
And then they throw it to Bob knew I knew me.
They throw it to him.

651
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:34.950
And that poor bastard.
I remember when we used to go to Patriots Games,

652
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.760
he did this thing when here,

653
00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:41.980
for some stupid reason they thought this would be a good idea and this is back.

654
00:38:41.981 --> 00:38:44.290
They've sent him to,
to Sullivan Stadium.

655
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:48.040
It might even have been Shaefer stadium back then.

656
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:51.310
They wanted to do this thing whenever the Patriots were right down on the goal

657
00:38:51.311 --> 00:38:54.940
line,
they would record him,
you know,

658
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:58.810
for the segments later on in the news for him to be like,
you know,
and you know,

659
00:38:59.230 --> 00:38:59.561
whatever,

660
00:38:59.561 --> 00:39:03.520
three 28 in the third quarter the Patriots were down on the one yard line and

661
00:39:03.521 --> 00:39:08.050
then they would just,
he would turn around and,
and then if they scored he'd say,

662
00:39:08.051 --> 00:39:10.660
and Tony Collins ran the ball in blah blah,
blah,
blah blah.

663
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:15.100
So he fucking would go down there and we're all hammered and he'd be taken a

664
00:39:15.101 --> 00:39:19.330
knee and we just wait for his lips to start moving and we'd all just start

665
00:39:19.331 --> 00:39:21.970
screaming,
fucking no may,
no,

666
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:24.400
he'd beat down on one knee.

667
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.970
I remember at one point he was looking like it was get upset and then he just

668
00:39:27.971 --> 00:39:30.610
saw,
just put the mic down like you had it in his hand.

669
00:39:30.611 --> 00:39:32.000
But he just let it go down like that.

670
00:39:32.001 --> 00:39:34.870
And he just shook his head and started laughing.
It's just like,

671
00:39:34.871 --> 00:39:39.370
why would you do that to the guy?
So anyways,
um,
all three of them,

672
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.500
they were funny as hell.
Bob Knew Myra was great too.

673
00:39:41.501 --> 00:39:42.940
It now does all the horse race and everything.

674
00:39:42.941 --> 00:39:47.170
So I now that Boston legend retires,

675
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:50.080
Jack Williams,
thank you for all your great news class and uh,

676
00:39:50.081 --> 00:39:53.650
the Wednesday's child and all of that stuff.
You awesome.
So there you go.

677
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:56.650
I hope other people gave a fuck about that.
Who weren't from Boston.
All right.

678
00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:58.750
Advice for my daughter,

679
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:04.150
uh,
top of the morning to you.

680
00:40:04.151 --> 00:40:07.540
Standard redhead joke that everybody's done and I'm zillion time.
All right,

681
00:40:07.541 --> 00:40:11.500
I want to thank you in advance for any advice you have for me or my daughter.

682
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:13.660
My daughter is third.

683
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:17.950
I'm gonna say it the whole way through is 13 and doesn't have many interests.

684
00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:22.600
At least none that she is willing to stick with.
Well she's only 13 to the fuck.

685
00:40:22.601 --> 00:40:26.230
She's got to pick a career.
You screaming at her every night.

686
00:40:26.231 --> 00:40:28.270
Is it going to be finance?
You're going to be a nurse.

687
00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:38.360
However,
there seems to be one subject that keeps cup coming up,
uh,
that she asks,

688
00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.840
uh,
my help with.
And that's comedy.

689
00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:45.400
She's a funny and incredibly sarcastic kid.
My favorite type of humor,

690
00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.640
which she probably got it from you then.
I was about to say,
yeah.

691
00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:53.700
Oh cause she's daddy's little sarcastic girl and she wants,

692
00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.640
it's her learn how to write jokes.
I have searched for classes,

693
00:40:57.641 --> 00:41:01.630
but they appear to be given at a comedy club and I don't think they would want a

694
00:41:01.631 --> 00:41:03.000
13 year old girl around.

695
00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:05.680
You wouldn't want to bring a 13 year old girl now a comedy club.

696
00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:10.270
They've got half a person,
like a sale.
They've got to have some kids programs,

697
00:41:10.271 --> 00:41:13.990
don't they do that?
Let me finish.
Before you come in here with your wisdom,

698
00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:18.640
can you recommend any kind of book or video class that she could study?

699
00:41:18.641 --> 00:41:22.060
I've seen a lot of material,
but I'm not sure what will help her get started.

700
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:25.390
Big Fan and appreciate any suggestions that you may have.

701
00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:30.190
And if you read this on the advice show,
please give me a heads up.

702
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:33.100
I will have her.
How the fuck would I give you?
I don't know who you are.

703
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:37.850
<v 1>What is the advice show?
Oh,</v>

704
00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:42.740
let her hear it directly from you and not shittily passed along from her.

705
00:41:42.741 --> 00:41:43.610
More on father.

706
00:41:43.611 --> 00:41:48.170
And I would like to count how many mistakes you made reading this letter.

707
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.510
I kept,
well you want to talk about mistakes too.

708
00:41:50.511 --> 00:41:54.730
When you said at least none that she's willing,
you spelt none non.
All right,

709
00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:55.573
fuck.
Oh,

710
00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:01.190
I kept the word small for your illiterate ginger ass.
It's such arrogant.
Cons.

711
00:42:01.191 --> 00:42:04.220
Maybe this is why your daughter doesn't mind to share interest because you're

712
00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:06.620
kind of a prey.
Oh He's,
you know what it is.

713
00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:09.530
He's worried that I'm going to shit on him so he's going to shit on me first.

714
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:14.330
So anyways,
uh,
first of all,
Emerson College,

715
00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:18.210
all of a sudden now you can major in comedy.
I heard that tonight.
Yeah.

716
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:22.550
Which kind of makes sense and soldering,
uh,
the tickets,
the comedic,

717
00:42:22.551 --> 00:42:26.630
the legends that have graduated from the school.
Oh,
just such as bill burr.

718
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:29.120
Just the tickets that comics are selling.

719
00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:34.180
When I started out there was a handful of people playing theaters and that would

720
00:42:35.241 --> 00:42:39.140
be like George Carlin,
Bill Cosby.

721
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.353
<v 0>Uh,</v>

722
00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:44.580
<v 1>see I'm already forgetting.
I mean maybe those guys that had their teeth,</v>

723
00:42:44.581 --> 00:42:48.310
TV shows am I started,
Seinfeld still hadn't become a hit yet,

724
00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.560
so he was probably just selling out clubs.

725
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:54.070
Maybe Roseanne Barr if she gave a fuck enough at that point.

726
00:42:54.071 --> 00:42:57.850
Cause Roseanne was still going.
But there was a,
I mean it was a short,
short,

727
00:42:57.851 --> 00:43:01.240
short list.
And now there's like a zillion people out there,

728
00:43:01.241 --> 00:43:03.280
it seems they're all playing in theaters.
They're all right.

729
00:43:03.281 --> 00:43:06.430
New Hours and everything.
Like I,
there's never been a more prolific time.

730
00:43:06.431 --> 00:43:10.660
So I think they're finally seeing it when like how many fucking comics have sold

731
00:43:10.661 --> 00:43:14.830
out Madison Square Garden.
Like that was like,
it was like Eddie Murphy did it,

732
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:20.110
dice clay did it,
and then Dane Cook did it.
So there was like a fucking,

733
00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:23.590
it was two guys in the 80s.
Nobody in the 90s that I knew of,

734
00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:26.020
no comic in the 90s that I know of,

735
00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:31.620
that that wasn't what Eddie had already stopped dice maybe did it in 1990 but

736
00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:37.660
uh,
yeah,
he was doing the show.

737
00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:39.333
<v 0>MMM.</v>

738
00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:45.470
<v 1>That was when a lot of Yak comments were out doing their own TV shows.
Tim Allen.</v>

739
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:48.740
Yeah.
I don't know how it happened.
And all of a sudden now,
you know,
there's like,

740
00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:53.010
like I think I know like five people that sold the fucking thing out.

741
00:43:53.011 --> 00:43:57.570
So in mine it's now a,
it's full.
It's finally,
I think just comedy.

742
00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:00.150
Well maybe that they're having as like comedy writing in that,

743
00:44:00.151 --> 00:44:03.360
but I always look at it as like being a comedian.
It's actually a a,

744
00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.080
it's a career now where people used to kind of look at it even though I'd always

745
00:44:07.081 --> 00:44:07.914
was a career,

746
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:11.310
but it was always kind of viewed as like it was this stepping stone to get a

747
00:44:11.311 --> 00:44:15.330
Sitcom I find is Shane's that major in comedy.

748
00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:20.220
It's cool but it's like it's such a weird thing.
So there probably is weird.

749
00:44:20.221 --> 00:44:22.440
Do you have to be funny and like your application and shit?

750
00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:27.450
Like they probably do like the acting program where you have to do some material

751
00:44:27.781 --> 00:44:31.950
there.
Probably study all like the history of comedy from the very beginning,

752
00:44:31.951 --> 00:44:35.820
like Vaudeville.
Up until now they watch a ton of specials.

753
00:44:35.821 --> 00:44:36.710
They probably have to write it.

754
00:44:36.711 --> 00:44:40.140
So I got kinda like when I did Emerson and I graduated with a media arts degree.

755
00:44:40.141 --> 00:44:43.680
Right.
We watched a shitload of movies.
We wrote a lot of papers about it.

756
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.060
That's probably what they're going to do.

757
00:44:45.061 --> 00:44:46.530
They have to do some sort of performance.
Right.

758
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.930
Well right now his question was what can you do now?
I would just want,

759
00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.870
so what city are they?
Did they say what city they're in?
I don't know.

760
00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:58.890
I would just say just watch as many comedians is as you can or watch as many

761
00:44:58.891 --> 00:45:00.660
comedies as you can.
Uh,

762
00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:03.330
it depends if you want to be a writer or something like that.
I mean,
these,

763
00:45:03.331 --> 00:45:06.670
these are the fun years.
Like there's no,
like you're 13.
I mean,
it sounds like,

764
00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:10.100
exactly.
It'll probably change.
It should be in Jordan.
No,

765
00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:13.110
but it should be enjoyable.
It should be enjoyable.
Yeah.

766
00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:16.500
Why are you trying to make it a career for her already knows he loves her?
No,

767
00:45:16.501 --> 00:45:19.930
I know.
I know.
I'm just joking.
But also,
um,
they,
uh,

768
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:24.300
do improv classes for people that age.
That's a good fun thing to do.
Don't do,

769
00:45:24.301 --> 00:45:25.890
don't take an Improv class at 13.

770
00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:28.780
That's like teaching a kid how to throw a fucking curve ball.

771
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:32.250
We've been too young while if you try to teach a kid when he's too young to

772
00:45:32.251 --> 00:45:35.940
throw a curve ball,
he neat.
Let me finish.
You get fucking interrupted me here.

773
00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.050
They've fucking,
uh,
they,

774
00:45:38.051 --> 00:45:42.360
they get the Tommy John Surgery now what?
Now you're going to pile it on me.

775
00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:47.250
I'm not pouting.
There you are.
That's your pouch face.
Is this my pal?
Yeah.

776
00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.040
I was trying to,

777
00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.670
I had a nice fucking reference there about throwing the curve ball.

778
00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:53.430
It was going well and you,
you would it in on me,

779
00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:56.070
so I decided to defend myself and now you know what's going to happen.

780
00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:57.173
You're going to fucking,

781
00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:01.680
you're within three more dumb things and me saying of doing that thing where you

782
00:46:01.681 --> 00:46:04.080
cross your arms and you fucking look in the other direction.

783
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:07.620
My was already half Christ.
I know and then I say what's wrong?
And you go,

784
00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:11.430
nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
Something's wrong.
You got your fucking arms crossed.

785
00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:16.020
I don't understand what her go into an Improv class is is why is that a bad

786
00:46:16.021 --> 00:46:19.320
idea?
Because a lot of those improv theaters,

787
00:46:19.321 --> 00:46:22.200
they also do comedy writing workshops and all that kind of stuff.

788
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.831
I'll tell you why,

789
00:46:22.831 --> 00:46:27.831
because anybody in comedy and their job is to teach 13 year olds how to do

790
00:46:28.381 --> 00:46:30.210
Improv.
He stinks.

791
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:35.480
He married a rich guy and they're fucking bored and now they,
oh,

792
00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:39.570
maybe this is my talent and they're going to teach him more shit.
I had this is,

793
00:46:39.571 --> 00:46:44.040
this is what you do.
Not when I was 13 when you were 13 that this is what you do.

794
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.760
Hang out with your friends and joke around and be funny and,

795
00:46:47.761 --> 00:46:51.900
and find out the movies that,
you know,
make your generation left.

796
00:46:51.901 --> 00:46:55.920
Just do that and just this,
this is the,
it should be fun.
Should be fun.
Yeah.

797
00:46:55.921 --> 00:46:59.970
That's a good point.
And Be,
you know,
turn this into like the sports dad's worms,

798
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:02.730
which was the reference where they teach them how to throw a fucking curve ball

799
00:47:02.731 --> 00:47:05.640
at 13 and the movement that you do when you throw it,

800
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:07.170
you're snapping your wrist like that.

801
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:09.360
The tendons and their arms are still growing or whatever.

802
00:47:09.361 --> 00:47:10.800
I don't know what it is medically,
but they,

803
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:15.060
their arm is not strong enough to do it.
And these kids need Tommy John Surgery,

804
00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:20.310
which is basically you take a ligament outta your fucking leg and replace it in

805
00:47:20.311 --> 00:47:24.600
the elbow from,
they should be skipping rocks across the a fucking lake.
You know,

806
00:47:24.601 --> 00:47:27.630
the advice that I gave?
No,
you're absolutely right.
The advice I gave,

807
00:47:27.631 --> 00:47:32.400
Holy Shit can say that again.
What I have a recording.
Go ahead.

808
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:35.590
Oh,
when I heard that you're writing,
you said absolutely right.

809
00:47:35.591 --> 00:47:36.810
I don't think I've ever heard the,
uh,

810
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:38.950
the advice I just gave is the kind of advise my,

811
00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:40.900
my dad would give where he'd be like,
well,

812
00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:44.050
get into a class and take this and do this writing thing.
And other than that,

813
00:47:44.051 --> 00:47:47.520
he would make it this whole big sage payments.
Well,

814
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:51.170
there's a time and place for that and it's not when you're 13,
13.
Yeah.

815
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:54.490
He should be walking off from school if they didn't have your fucking believe in

816
00:47:54.491 --> 00:47:55.211
as a pedophile.

817
00:47:55.211 --> 00:47:59.980
Behind every fucking tree should be goofing off with your friends and,
and just,

818
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:02.410
you should know how to make people laugh.

819
00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.270
He should just be fucking making people laugh.

820
00:48:04.271 --> 00:48:05.860
You don't want to break it down and be like,
oh,

821
00:48:05.861 --> 00:48:08.710
I just made my 13 year old friend left.
Well,
let's see.

822
00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.130
Let's look at the setup and what was the punchline?

823
00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:14.620
You're going to start doing it.
Oh,
here comes my,
you normally do today at school.

824
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:18.010
You know,
they do day in 13.
Oh,
we work am my miss directions.

825
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:23.050
Did you wouldn't believe it.
And I tagged this whole thing about the lunch lady.

826
00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:26.860
You don't want to do that.
Just fucking have like all the fun out of it.
Exactly.

827
00:48:26.861 --> 00:48:31.540
Just,
I would say,
watch the legends of today.
Like Melissa McCarthy,

828
00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:36.070
Kristen Wiig,
whatever the fuck you're into.
And uh,

829
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:39.850
you know,
I dunno.
I Dunno what to tell you that,
that's what I would do.

830
00:48:39.851 --> 00:48:44.290
I wouldn't mind.
Yeah,
I'm sticker in a fucking comedy class.
Whoa.
Jesus.

831
00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:48.910
File that under old
comedy.
What is it?

832
00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:53.380
Webster's Dick Syron shock as,

833
00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:58.930
what is this thing that we call comedy?
All right.
Vetch.

834
00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:03.730
Vegetarian Barbecue.
Okay.
Oh,
Billy boy.

835
00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:08.770
The pipes,
the pipes are calling.
They go to something new.
Oh,
Billy boy.

836
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.540
I'll do justice to our pipes.
The pipes are quarreling.

837
00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:16.690
Who's a song I was singing that you should keep watching the fucking repeats of

838
00:49:16.691 --> 00:49:18.950
true detective Bra.

839
00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.013
That

840
00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:30.030
birds or the nose were

841
00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:35.370
fucking phenomenal show.
I can't wait to see,
uh,

842
00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.430
Vince and that go from the phone booth movies.
Oh my God.

843
00:49:39.431 --> 00:49:43.240
You said the phone booth.
Wow.
You're this or the Sushi restaurant.

844
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:47.800
You're really reaching back into Colin ferals,
a imdv page with foam booth.

845
00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:51.340
I don't see movies.
That's the last one I saw it and I just saw that to be like,

846
00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:53.020
how did these cheap fox,

847
00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.970
because they didn't want to hang with the guys standing in a phone booth is

848
00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:01.390
times square or something like that.
So it wasn't cheap to shoot that.
I know.

849
00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:04.860
And it was a phone booth and it was like 2003 and they didn't exist anymore.

850
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:09.640
Um,
I like your impression of that song,

851
00:50:09.641 --> 00:50:13.780
the theme song from true detective to do it again,
cause I love it.

852
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:18.430
No,
I love the song too.
Until you watched every episode 500 times.

853
00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:23.260
I'd be just walking around my house choir dusty.

854
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:27.830
Oh God.
She's watching another one that is the handsome family,

855
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:31.250
a husband and wife band who do that and music.

856
00:50:31.251 --> 00:50:34.850
And they also do the theme to the new season and they're amazing.

857
00:50:34.851 --> 00:50:39.620
And I loved their music now.
I love that Gothic.
He kind of comes a collectic.
Oh,

858
00:50:39.621 --> 00:50:44.210
I am.
Oh,
I'm so KCRW with it right now.
Sorry.

859
00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:45.710
You sound like you're high right now.

860
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:50.600
I wish vegetarian barbecue or Billy boy the pipes,

861
00:50:50.601 --> 00:50:55.130
the pipes are calling a last Sunday my girlfriend dragged me to a vegetarian

862
00:50:55.131 --> 00:50:59.930
barbecue.
Full disclosure,
I was told that there would be grilled chicken skewers,

863
00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:04.430
uh,
there,
but I didn't see a single one.
Sounds like something in silver lake.

864
00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:09.770
And we got there on time.
Maybe that's how they learn or people over.
Exactly.

865
00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:14.030
It's a vegetarian barbecue.
Terrible.
That's like,
hey,

866
00:51:14.031 --> 00:51:15.980
let's go to this gay sex orgy.

867
00:51:15.981 --> 00:51:19.460
I swear to God there's going to be some hetro action going on over there

868
00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:23.750
and everybody's banging me in the ass.
And I was just like,

869
00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:29.820
have I been duped here?
I really want a long way to make that point.
Sorry.
Um,

870
00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:34.520
you have to bring your own food to shit like this.
Yeah.
All right.
Instead,

871
00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:38.660
she should have brought the biggest fucking red is stake.
He could find

872
00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:43.310
mix their dumb portobello mushrooms.

873
00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:47.090
What's up pussies manage.

874
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.370
I know I'm going to die before you,
but I can look myself in the eye when I dope,

875
00:51:52.371 --> 00:51:56.670
whatever dumb things.
Mediators,
not like I don't eat meat.
And not only that,

876
00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:59.090
I'm not dumb,
but I like vegetables.

877
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.620
I didn't see a single one and the time,
blah,
blah blah.
Instead,

878
00:52:03.621 --> 00:52:08.180
I only saw vegetables skewers,
grilled corn and a bowl of Orzo.

879
00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:11.420
I don't even want to know what that is.
It's a grain.
It's like,

880
00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:14.030
it's like Rice Pilaf.
That's what it tastes like.
Oh,

881
00:52:14.031 --> 00:52:15.140
is that gonna be the new craze?

882
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:20.170
Orzo the new craze something JP side and wheat pita bread.

883
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:25.280
Not even regular Peter.
They couldn't even give me that.

884
00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:30.920
I felt bad for the best.
There's nothing worse than somebody fucks with the food.

885
00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:35.300
The only saving grace.
We're a key lime pie.
Okay.

886
00:52:35.301 --> 00:52:39.500
And chips and dip and some decent beer.
That's pretty good.
That's pretty strong.

887
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:40.710
Uh,

888
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:44.120
I could maybe forgive the Veggie barbecue if the people holding it weren't the

889
00:52:44.121 --> 00:52:47.660
most obnoxious hipsters as well.
They were both artists.

890
00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:52.700
Shocker and painful to listen to as they clatter on about,

891
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:57.390
about their vinyl collection and knowledge of obscure Scifi shows.

892
00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:02.150
Did this take place in silver lake or Brooklyn or Williamsburg?
Yeah,

893
00:53:02.151 --> 00:53:04.380
but those aren't the only two hipster places.
That's true.

894
00:53:04.850 --> 00:53:09.850
The guy even has this weird nub of a pony tail coming out of the bottom of his

895
00:53:10.641 --> 00:53:15.170
head.
He's so cool.
He can't even have a normal pony tail.
Uh,

896
00:53:15.171 --> 00:53:16.004
anyways.

897
00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:20.270
Is it against the laws of men to have a barbecue without grilling any meat,

898
00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:25.160
be at Burgers,
dogs,
broths,
et Cetera?
Nothing.
Anything,
nothing.

899
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:26.130
Anything against

900
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:28.980
<v 0>vegetarian.
See,
after time,
not half the time,
but a third of the time,</v>

901
00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.380
that's the way they write it.
Not My dumb fucking brain.

902
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:34.350
Nothing to anything against.

903
00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:38.220
What is he trying to say that now that I have anything against vegetarians or

904
00:53:38.221 --> 00:53:39.330
their closet diets,

905
00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:44.220
but I feel like something has to die for a barbecue to go on wondering what your

906
00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:48.420
thoughts are on this subject.
Thanks.
And Go frog yourself.

907
00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:51.000
Um,
yeah,

908
00:53:51.001 --> 00:53:54.180
you basically went to a barbecue where all they had was decides,

909
00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.380
you know what I mean?
They had the zoo Katie and they had all that type of shit.

910
00:53:58.410 --> 00:53:59.280
Um,
I the,

911
00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:04.281
I think a mistake that vegetarians make is they try to replace classic meat

912
00:54:06.481 --> 00:54:09.450
dishes.
Yeah.
That's like,
if you went on stage,

913
00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:14.280
was it Tofurky two foci?
Like it's like the fake Turkey.

914
00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:19.090
Yeah.
Don't try to be Turkey and unless your Turkey,
right,
right,
right.
Sorry.

915
00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:23.860
Yeah,
like a steak doesn't try to be Zucchini.
Exactly.
Cause it could now.

916
00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:28.110
It could never be so keen ever visa Keenan Zucchini needs to follow its voice.

917
00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:33.060
<v 1>No.
If they had an,
I mean if they had any kind of common decency,</v>

918
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.360
they would have a separate little Hibachi for the the meat eaters.

919
00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:38.920
I don't have sympathy for this guy.
He knew what it was.
They said it wasn't,

920
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:40.260
they did lie to him about the chicken.

921
00:54:40.261 --> 00:54:42.030
We have a little bit of chicken or something like that,

922
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:45.030
but you have to bring your own food to these types of things.

923
00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:47.070
You can't rely on on them.

924
00:54:47.071 --> 00:54:50.700
You got to bring your own shit and just bring a cooked because yeah,

925
00:54:50.701 --> 00:54:53.040
I was just saying yet though,
the steak on next to their dump,

926
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:55.410
pouring all the money,
but there'll be like,
no,
no,
no.

927
00:54:55.411 --> 00:54:57.300
I don't want it on the same thing man.

928
00:54:57.301 --> 00:55:00.300
And in the mail like did you just got to bring your own shit?
You know when this,

929
00:55:00.301 --> 00:55:03.480
when this idea was presented to him,
his inner voice said,

930
00:55:03.481 --> 00:55:05.910
I don't want to find out where that out of that fucking shit.

931
00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.350
You gotta listen to that,
sir,

932
00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:09.060
and then you won't have to hang out with these people.

933
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:14.220
If I was ever invited to a Vegan or vegetarian barbecue,
I would say no.

934
00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:16.710
Do you remember that time we had the vegetarian thanksgiving?

935
00:55:16.711 --> 00:55:18.900
We tried to do that.
Oh God.

936
00:55:18.901 --> 00:55:23.580
My family revolted against me and that's how I learned my lesson.

937
00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:26.940
Yeah.
I was like,
I want to do a Vegan thing.
It'll be just as delicious.

938
00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:29.030
It wasn't just as delicious as awful,

939
00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:34.350
but we did not do it.
Yeah.
And we were trying to be really healthy.

940
00:55:34.351 --> 00:55:39.090
We had just moved to La,
blah,
blah,
blah.
It's an word Douche bags,
couplet Douche.

941
00:55:39.091 --> 00:55:43.650
But had we had a douchebag thanksgiving that when I spilled half of the stuffing

942
00:55:43.651 --> 00:55:47.100
behind the stove and started crying.
It was that that year?

943
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:52.950
I think so.
Oh,
no,
no,
no,
no.
We made a vegetarian Lasagna one thanksgiving.

944
00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:57.190
Oh God.
It was a terrible idea.
It's awful.
Those fucking carrots in there.
Yeah.

945
00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:02.370
Carrots and Lasagna.
Terrible.
Awful.
So then I,
then,
you know what,
uh,

946
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:04.530
Jamie Masada down the laugh factory,

947
00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:08.730
he has this thing where he feeds the homeless people down there and he asked me

948
00:56:08.731 --> 00:56:12.630
if I wanted to do it and I was like,
no man,
it's my thanksgiving.
I don't want to,

949
00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.240
I don't,
you know why?
I did it a couple of times and it's just like,

950
00:56:15.241 --> 00:56:17.610
I don't want to fucking go down there and then you have to go on stage.

951
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.780
He always talks you to going on stage and you sit in there and it's a bunch of

952
00:56:21.781 --> 00:56:24.920
homeless people eating and they don't give a fuck.
And you go up when your bomb.

953
00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:29.280
Last time I was there I remember me and Ian Edwards just fucking eight.

954
00:56:29.281 --> 00:56:33.100
It's funny to eat it on Thanksgiving,
you know,
it's a nice idea.

955
00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:37.080
It's a great on paper,
on paper.
It's a great fun American comedy shows.

956
00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:41.560
Well they die.
He,
they're fine.
They're fine with just the food.
Yeah,

957
00:56:41.561 --> 00:56:44.800
they don't need,
they don't need to be like,
hey,

958
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:48.340
how are you guys doing?
Not Good.
We're homeless

959
00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:55.660
isn't at least open bars.
And they get a,
hey,
thanks Adam.
Where are you guys from?

960
00:56:56.330 --> 00:57:00.120
Fucking rail yard.
Um,
what bus station do you with at?

961
00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:03.070
That's how you do yoga.
Switch up all your references.

962
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:06.550
This guy must sleep in the bus station out there in Burbank and all the other

963
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:09.700
homeless people looking down on it cause they sick fucking Hollywood.

964
00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:14.620
So I ended up telling you because the vegetarian dinner was so bad.
I said,
hey,

965
00:57:14.621 --> 00:57:18.670
I'm going to go down and go feed the homeless cause right cause right next door

966
00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:21.940
Nikki's son of a bitch and then the next to green bland,

967
00:57:21.941 --> 00:57:24.790
blessed and you ate it cold Turkey dinner.

968
00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:28.470
But I walked it down and I felt so fucking guilty.
Nah,

969
00:57:28.471 --> 00:57:32.890
that I ran over to the laugh factory completely full and a big smile on my face

970
00:57:32.891 --> 00:57:36.130
and I fed some homeless people and Jamie's like,
you want to go and say,

971
00:57:36.131 --> 00:57:38.410
it was like,
oh no.
He's like,
come on buddy.
You know it's going to be fun.

972
00:57:38.411 --> 00:57:38.861
It's like Jamie,

973
00:57:38.861 --> 00:57:41.490
I'm not going up and eat my balls in front of these fucking people.
They,

974
00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:45.160
they're good.
They're good with the food.
I'll come up,
man,
come on now.

975
00:57:45.161 --> 00:57:48.410
You did the right thing by if I having a fault,
uh,

976
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:53.380
thanksgiving by me helping the homeless was,
was horseshit that year.

977
00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:58.390
I did not do it.
I went,
I didn't go down there cause I had to help the homeless.

978
00:57:58.391 --> 00:58:02.110
I went down there cause I wanted to fucking Turkey dinner.
Um,
all right,

979
00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:07.000
what are we up to here as far as time?
22 minutes.
We did 35,
so I'm up to 57.

980
00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:12.400
All right.
Dilemma.
Uh,
another redhead joke.
Hey,
who would know,

981
00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.660
who would thought,

982
00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:19.110
would you let P diddy or anyone else that matter hit you in the head with the

983
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.460
kettle bell for $50 million?

984
00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:26.850
Now I don't understand the point of these like random scenario questions that

985
00:58:27.911 --> 00:58:28.211
people,

986
00:58:28.211 --> 00:58:33.211
I suppose like would you rather get fucked in the ass bias or no?

987
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:38.230
No,
but if,
if it's,
if it's a fabric garlic oil,

988
00:58:38.231 --> 00:58:42.550
like give you an if Hansel funny though.
Some of it's funny though.

989
00:58:43.450 --> 00:58:48.130
If it's,
if they're funny scenarios you give,
you give somebody too awful choices.

990
00:58:48.131 --> 00:58:52.390
He just said that was one said it wasn't a dilemma.
Would you do that?

991
00:58:52.450 --> 00:58:56.260
Would you let P diddy and why?
Uh,
why,
why is p diddy in it?

992
00:58:57.310 --> 00:58:59.890
Why is that?
What does that have to do with it?
This is the thing,

993
00:58:59.891 --> 00:59:03.040
when people pull things out of their ass and I have a problem with,
it's lazy.

994
00:59:03.041 --> 00:59:05.650
It's like,
see what you would do,
let Pete duty,

995
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:08.590
he would nearly go from 50 million blood.

996
00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:13.480
Like what are you 13 yeah,
but I said,
no,
I'm on.
A lot of people would say yes.

997
00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:18.100
Oh,
just because it for the money.
No.

998
00:59:18.101 --> 00:59:22.270
If I wasn't doing what I was doing for a living and if I wasn't,
then yeah,

999
00:59:22.271 --> 00:59:23.950
I'd let I let them drop it on my toe.

1000
00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:30.490
Yeah.
But I'm,
I'm doing all right.
So,
uh,
no,

1001
00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:34.780
I don't have 50 million.
I don't have anyone near that.
But I mean,

1002
00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.480
I'm not doing that.
And then somebody videotapes it.
Oh,

1003
00:59:37.481 --> 00:59:41.980
that big fucking kettle bell fail for the rest of my fucking life.

1004
00:59:41.981 --> 00:59:44.920
That was the entire,
that was the entire question.
I gotta be honest with you.

1005
00:59:44.921 --> 00:59:48.910
I wouldn't want to make it that way.
Make what?
Well,
why are you holding the mic?

1006
00:59:48.911 --> 00:59:53.400
Like you're not supposed to?
You have it.
Like you're going to sing into it.

1007
00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:58.750
Um,
no,
I wouldn't want to make it that way.
We'll be talking about make what,

1008
00:59:58.751 --> 01:00:02.240
what way?
Like all of a sudden you had 50 million bucks.
Oh,

1009
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:05.260
now he's now you get yourself a little bit with a Kettlebell and he got a little

1010
01:00:05.261 --> 01:00:08.590
tweed coat on is some shit and then you're going to some party wherever else has

1011
01:00:08.591 --> 01:00:12.280
50 million bucks and they're like,
oh,
you know what?
I'm a fucking,
uh,

1012
01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:17.560
I dunno what,
what are they fucking my banker?
Oh,
I ran a Ponzi scheme.
You know,

1013
01:00:17.561 --> 01:00:22.520
something that took a little bit of effort.
American greed,
American greed.
Um,

1014
01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:25.780
I just find when people ask dumb questions like that,

1015
01:00:25.781 --> 01:00:29.880
that are meant to be some sort of probe in to usually fighting audit work,

1016
01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:33.030
it didn't work the way your going to give you a dilemma we give.

1017
01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:37.480
It's like you're not deep.
Yeah.
You're being really harsh.

1018
01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:42.700
Am I on the dilemma guy?
All right.
He took it.
Took it,
took a swing.

1019
01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:46.600
Well,
I wouldn't want people to come with a little bit more effort.
That's all.

1020
01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.480
Is it?
Is it so wrong?
But I demand excellence.
Gas.

1021
01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.820
I'm full of Shit right now.
What's the dilemma you want to pose to me then?

1022
01:00:55.090 --> 01:01:00.020
All right,
let me give you good.
What would you rather,
uh,

1023
01:01:00.021 --> 01:01:02.060
I don't know any famous people's fucking names,

1024
01:01:02.061 --> 01:01:05.000
so I'm going to have to describe him to you.
Oh God.
That should be good.

1025
01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:09.350
I'm trying to think.
I love when you,
would you identify actors?

1026
01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:15.500
All right.
Would you rather have sex with,
uh,

1027
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:22.350
uh,
I can't even think of anybody
who's just a fucking,

1028
01:01:22.351 --> 01:01:24.090
just somebody.
You wouldn't want to have sex with

1029
01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:28.910
an actor or like,
no one astronaut

1030
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:34.880
who's going to relate to them other than this shit.
Ah,
okay.

1031
01:01:34.881 --> 01:01:39.881
The guy in seven who got forced fed the fucking spaghettios died.

1032
01:01:40.791 --> 01:01:45.530
You want to talk cam?
And he's in that makeup and when he fucks,
he goes,

1033
01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:49.860
uh,
or,
or,

1034
01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:52.310
or,
uh,

1035
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:59.230
put some jam on your Hoo Ha and let some sort of animal lick it off.

1036
01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:00.613
<v 2>Okay?</v>

1037
01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:03.590
<v 1>You have to bang the fucking spaghetti.
Okay.</v>

1038
01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:08.450
Until completion and uh,
and then he spends the night.

1039
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:14.930
I want more.
No,
you can put some jam.
No,

1040
01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:18.290
I'm going to go on,
on you.
Who are needing,
I'm going to go and that,

1041
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:21.980
that'll be good.
That'll be,
that'll be over it.
And it'll be over

1042
01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.760
37 seconds.
CanNot be involved in a sexual situation with an animal on any level.

1043
01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:33.380
28 seconds.
It's over.
I will go with the VAT guy spending the night.

1044
01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:37.880
I'm not going to get into anytime.
BC Audi.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1045
01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:39.500
You let it do it.
Yeah.

1046
01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:44.270
<v 0>To you for 10 seconds.
The animal.</v>

1047
01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.553
Okay.

1048
01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:52.680
<v 1>No,
nothing with an animal.
No.
Absolutely not.
No nothing</v>

1049
01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:58.240
<v 0>ever.
Wasn't that funny?
That was funny.
That wasn't funny.
Well,</v>

1050
01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:01.110
fuck.
He's not a fucking comedian.
Well,
yeah.

1051
01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.660
What you're going to do is you're gonna make everybody gun shy to fucking take a

1052
01:03:03.661 --> 01:03:07.110
big swinging them.
Everybody has a swing and a miss.
Oh No,
no,
no,
no.

1053
01:03:07.111 --> 01:03:11.130
They're going to like tweet and send in all kinds of crazy dilemmas now,

1054
01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.860
which actually should be kind of fun.

1055
01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:16.170
I just don't like it when they just don't make any sense.

1056
01:03:16.171 --> 01:03:21.060
And then she just gave you a hacky one because they're always sexual.
So like,

1057
01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:25.140
cause when we were doing the dilemmas,
what happens is just became,
it just,

1058
01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:29.370
it just kept going sex,
would you rather fuck your mom,
dad?

1059
01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:32.810
It's just like Jesus Christ.

1060
01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.690
It's like watch one of those comedy central roasts were like,

1061
01:03:36.691 --> 01:03:39.340
by the time you get up if feel like ninth I'm one of the thing,

1062
01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:44.510
the level of mean you have to be.
Especially because all of those fucking roasts,

1063
01:03:44.511 --> 01:03:47.910
so many of them were just like the,
the comics roasting.

1064
01:03:47.911 --> 01:03:50.850
The person didn't know him so they didn't have any personal stories.

1065
01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.840
So it was just,
you know,
what one of those dilemmas,

1066
01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:55.970
<v 1>but one of these dilemmas or the,</v>

1067
01:03:55.971 --> 01:03:59.330
would you rather scenarios like what are these things attempting to prove?

1068
01:03:59.331 --> 01:04:03.950
Like yeah,
if someone's like,
would you rather have sex with your mom to be funny?

1069
01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:06.920
I was just supposed to be like a,
I'm,
I'm looking too much into it.

1070
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:10.040
<v 0>All right.
Yeah,
fair enough.
Oh jet.</v>

1071
01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:14.980
Which would you rather wash dishes at Denny's or a wipe the syrup off the table

1072
01:04:14.981 --> 01:04:18.710
that I hop
Sarah off the tables.

1073
01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:23.250
Third Shift for a year.
Wait,
you can't shift.

1074
01:04:23.251 --> 01:04:26.980
You can't add things on.
After I answered the question,
you asked me the question.

1075
01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:30.450
All right.
No,
no,
no.

1076
01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:35.430
What you got to wipe the syrup up the fucking tables.
I'd rather dirt shift.

1077
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.350
Third Shift when all of drunks coming into this,

1078
01:04:37.351 --> 01:04:40.470
a fight to when the youtube videos get made or Denny's,

1079
01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:44.580
you got the afternoon shift from two to five or you just got to wash all these

1080
01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:46.560
fucking plates,
but they're leftover.

1081
01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:51.300
They'll leftover from the or the morning and the lunch rush wipe off the tables,

1082
01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.920
but you'd done two to five,

1083
01:04:52.921 --> 01:04:55.200
two to five or you got to work a full fucking eight hours.

1084
01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:58.530
You come in at 10 o'clock at night and you'd done it six in the morning.

1085
01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.550
If at all I have to do is wipe down tables.
Yeah,

1086
01:05:02.551 --> 01:05:07.490
wipe down tables and then the other option is fucking hours or you just washed

1087
01:05:07.491 --> 01:05:11.520
dishes for three hours and then you have your whole fucking morning to yourself

1088
01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:16.020
and the whole night I might have to,
all right.
I might have to change that then.

1089
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:17.980
I don't know.
It was a lot of

1090
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.240
<v 1>fucking dishes at,
I</v>

1091
01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:25.830
know a dentist at Danny's,
a lot of dried syrup,
you know what I mean?

1092
01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:30.730
People you have to like scrape off the plates first too and all that shit.

1093
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.150
You know like the busboys,
they just put down the,
Oh you wait,

1094
01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:36.810
you wait three months.
Anyone you got to clean up the fucking grease trap.
Yeah.

1095
01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:38.310
Something you'll never forget.
No,

1096
01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:41.470
I'm sticking with the wiping down the tables because then kind of have fun.

1097
01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:42.640
I can like chat with people.

1098
01:05:42.641 --> 01:05:45.430
I don't want to stand back there for three hours away and people like,

1099
01:05:45.431 --> 01:05:49.360
I've seen people blow their nose and like put the Napkin like on the plate and

1100
01:05:49.361 --> 01:05:51.760
all kinds of disgusting shit.
Like I'm not touching that.

1101
01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.730
I'll why put on a pair of gloves and I'll wipe down the table.

1102
01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:59.250
Spray some fucking antiseptic or whatever.
You get home with six,

1103
01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:01.930
you leave at six,
you get home at seven in the fucking morning.

1104
01:06:01.931 --> 01:06:03.100
You're so fucking wired.

1105
01:06:03.101 --> 01:06:08.050
You can't go to bed until 10 and eight and then you fucking sleep until what,

1106
01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:11.890
three,
four o'clock in the afternoon.
Then he got to go back in at 10.

1107
01:06:11.891 --> 01:06:14.860
It's just you have no fucking life.
Feel like one of those,
like that guy who's,

1108
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:18.010
who's in the Paparazzi movie.
Hey,

1109
01:06:18.011 --> 01:06:19.960
I'm going to take your picture and then kill my friend.

1110
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:26.800
What you talking about?
Movies?

1111
01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:30.250
I would say keep fixer and

1112
01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:37.620
I love that movie too.
Well,
it's like all Paparazzi nocturnal nightmares.
Um,

1113
01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:42.130
Ooh.
Did have coal houser in it?
No,
that was,
it was,

1114
01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:46.720
it was,
it was the one,
it was the,
um,

1115
01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.320
he was the one with Gordon East.
East,
east.
And if it's

1116
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:56.410
not one of those crazy Jake Gyllenhaal.

1117
01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:00.010
Oh,
Jake Gyllenhaal.
Yeah.

1118
01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:04.180
Night Night Stalker night crawler crawler.
You weren't,

1119
01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.960
you were describing nightcrawler this whole time and we take your picture and

1120
01:07:07.961 --> 01:07:12.310
I'm going to kill my friend.
What did you think I was talking about?

1121
01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.310
You did this single wire,
single white female.

1122
01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:18.070
I thought there was a movie called Papa Razzi.

1123
01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:22.750
Like a real movie called Paparazzi.
Oh yeah.
It wasn't this Cole.
How's the call?

1124
01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:27.300
How's there?
Okay.
Okay.

1125
01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:29.230
All right.
Is a deal.

1126
01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:32.800
Would you rather get slapped in the face by coal houser

1127
01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:38.260
or have the spaghetti o's guy give you a hug naked?

1128
01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:41.123
A lot in the face.

1129
01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:47.080
I love coal house there.
Yeah,

1130
01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:48.760
I was enough to let him slap you in the,

1131
01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:52.720
it's going to end up on youtube cause I feel like it might lead to something

1132
01:07:52.721 --> 01:07:56.080
else on one of those.
You know what?
I'm so tired.

1133
01:07:56.081 --> 01:07:57.950
Let me give a shit that you said.
Fuck

1134
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:04.810
she's all yours,
Cole.
I'm want to deal with this fucking thing.

1135
01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:07.720
Or have the Nicky gaffers that men giving me.

1136
01:08:10.450 --> 01:08:14.800
These are good now because if you actually chose the hug then I was going to add

1137
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:17.870
while he's softly wept into the nape of your neck.

1138
01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:26.450
All right.
I have to ask you one now.
Oh Jesus.
Okay.
Would you rather,

1139
01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:28.083
uh,

1140
01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:34.010
take an etiquette glass with Martha Stewart,
Martha Stewart?

1141
01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:39.520
It was trying to think of they I hang with her in a second or uh,

1142
01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:43.010
would you rather a Mazda?
What was it like when you went to jail

1143
01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:50.490
or would you rather do a dance recital with Ellen degenerate?

1144
01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:56.240
Oh my God.
No,
no fucking there's no,

1145
01:08:56.241 --> 01:08:59.630
there's not even a,
you wouldn't want to do a dance recital with Allen.

1146
01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:03.260
You'd rather sit through an etiquette class.
Martha Stewart.
No,

1147
01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:07.300
I can't go with my list.
I can't watch la character crowd.

1148
01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:08.620
You what you do with it.

1149
01:09:09.010 --> 01:09:13.140
Cause cause I know she's a fucking standup comic and maybe she did it a couple

1150
01:09:13.141 --> 01:09:16.640
of times cause she thought it was fun and now they expect him to do it right.

1151
01:09:16.641 --> 01:09:19.490
So she has to do it and not just get people coming up to her and restaurants.

1152
01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:23.600
Like I love to dance.
Oh yeah,
she probably hates it.

1153
01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:27.440
He probably thinks about murder suicides every fucking time it happens.

1154
01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:31.160
I see it in the rice I own.
I watched that a part of me dies.

1155
01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:35.780
Part of my soul fucking dies when I,
every time I watch her fucking do that.

1156
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:39.350
It's just like,
it's your show.
You don't have to do that.

1157
01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:45.790
Would you rather be grilled about your comedy by Oprah Winfrey or the or,

1158
01:09:49.190 --> 01:09:50.023
or,

1159
01:09:51.290 --> 01:09:54.410
or just as guest host on the view.

1160
01:09:55.450 --> 01:09:59.110
What's the other view is the,
Oh,

1161
01:09:59.230 --> 01:10:03.340
I could have for the whoopie and I think as Rosie Perez on there now,

1162
01:10:03.341 --> 01:10:07.310
we have so much fun in the view.
I would just keep bringing up feminist things.

1163
01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.001
Just say,

1164
01:10:08.001 --> 01:10:11.840
I don't understand what the problem is just to see how mad I could make joy.

1165
01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:16.460
[inaudible] she's not on there anymore or is she?
I don't know.
I don't know.

1166
01:10:16.461 --> 01:10:20.000
I don't,
I would just,
I would just act like a fucking idiot and be like,
no,

1167
01:10:20.001 --> 01:10:20.834
I'm just asking.

1168
01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:25.490
Would you rather go on the road with Guy Fieri,

1169
01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.240
eating all the food and just doing all that with him?

1170
01:10:29.241 --> 01:10:33.980
Get a sunburn and that word or,
uh,
would you,

1171
01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:36.350
I'm already out

1172
01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:41.630
cause I wouldn't want to get in the car with him afterwards and hear what he

1173
01:10:41.631 --> 01:10:44.470
says about all this week.
Jesus Christ.
It fucking sucked man.

1174
01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:47.680
It be careful what you wish for our daughters is going to be fucking fun.
I mean,

1175
01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:49.820
I know make them money and everything,
but I,

1176
01:10:49.821 --> 01:10:53.130
if I hear one more fucking sloppy Joe,
I swear to God.
Oh,

1177
01:10:53.131 --> 01:10:57.530
would you rather dress up like Mario Batali and like,
you know,

1178
01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:02.840
go to book signings with him as like a little comedic relief.
Hey,

1179
01:11:02.841 --> 01:11:05.540
is my a mini me?
Yeah,

1180
01:11:05.541 --> 01:11:09.290
you're the [inaudible] mini me because that's tied into me as a comedian.

1181
01:11:09.291 --> 01:11:11.450
I have to get sunburned with Guy Fieri.

1182
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:16.800
<v 0>I just fuck with him the whole time.
Just suddenly</v>

1183
01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:21.450
guy wanting to talk about hair or anything,
but you know,

1184
01:11:24.230 --> 01:11:27.560
it's a very loose,
can you stop wearing your sunglasses on the back of your head?

1185
01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:32.420
I know that was quite as he do that because he's part of that generation that

1186
01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:34.550
got the Barb wire tattoo on your arm.

1187
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:38.420
<v 1>Doesn't he look like he was in that band?
It was that one.
I'm,
Hey,</v>

1188
01:11:38.421 --> 01:11:42.710
now you're a rock star.
Get your game on.
Go play or whatever.

1189
01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:48.050
What is the name of that group?
Smash Mile Smash mouth,
Wayne.

1190
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:51.830
He looks like he should be in smash mouth or are they the same ones that sang

1191
01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:55.910
mad is where I'll be.
Well,
I can't not wham.
Yeah.

1192
01:11:56.090 --> 01:11:59.900
Or like who was dank or something like that.
No listing.
Who was saying is not

1193
01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:04.940
<v 0>Sam.
Why does this,
that's amazing.
The reason I think I liked that song.</v>

1194
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:06.920
I don't know Neil.
I have no idea.

1195
01:12:06.921 --> 01:12:10.910
I don't know anything about that whole time during music I was doing stand up so

1196
01:12:10.911 --> 01:12:12.830
much.
I have no idea who,
who was staying?

1197
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Three Mary for vague link one 82 I know where they are.

1198
01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:20.300
I liked him.

1199
01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:23.510
I don't know why everybody shits on Travis Barker is a fucking drummer.

1200
01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:27.660
He's an incredible drummer.
He's a fucking great drama and never just leave.

1201
01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:29.810
I don't know.
I don't know what it was.

1202
01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:33.440
What it was was there was a lot of young kids that thought he was the greatest

1203
01:12:33.441 --> 01:12:36.260
fucking drummer because he was playing you in a pop band.

1204
01:12:36.261 --> 01:12:38.260
So they just knew who he was.
Right.

1205
01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:41.300
So then all of a sudden because they thought he was the greatest,

1206
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:44.780
it's all of a sudden Travis Barker said he was better than John Bonam,

1207
01:12:44.781 --> 01:12:48.410
which he never did.
So we got the drummer from nine inch nails.

1208
01:12:48.411 --> 01:12:50.630
Sorry to interrupt.
Oh yes.

1209
01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:54.230
<v 1>How about we met the drummer from nine inch nails and his lovely girlfriend</v>

1210
01:12:54.231 --> 01:12:57.670
karody English.
Who I got to you.

1211
01:12:57.671 --> 01:13:00.790
You name dropping all over the phone too.
If you watch the cycles.

1212
01:13:00.791 --> 01:13:03.910
Seven of America's next top model.
She won.
I'm sorry,
I'm,

1213
01:13:03.911 --> 01:13:06.200
I'm girling nerding out right now,

1214
01:13:06.201 --> 01:13:10.580
but all the way over and we got an early fall.
I know.
All right.

1215
01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:15.680
<v 0>All right,
Nia,
would you rather
all right,</v>

1216
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:20.740
I got to come up with a good one here.
Would you rather not a good one.
Uh,

1217
01:13:21.850 --> 01:13:24.010
flying a plane around the world.

1218
01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:28.750
It's a fucking one of those old propeller ones where you sit in the back with

1219
01:13:28.751 --> 01:13:32.950
the single seat right next to the bathroom and it already smells before it takes

1220
01:13:32.951 --> 01:13:33.784
off.

1221
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:38.120
How you rather do that or uh,

1222
01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:43.390
oh Jesus.
How do I top that one?
Would you rather do that or,

1223
01:13:44.610 --> 01:13:47.620
oh,
I get nothing.
It's too fucking late.
God,

1224
01:13:47.621 --> 01:13:49.510
Jesus built off fucking clothes like this.

1225
01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:55.300
Now I'm just taking it to,
and someone a train fly around.

1226
01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:58.640
So fly around the world and like the worst seat on the airplane.
Yeah.

1227
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.940
It's going to take it like fucking four days to do it.
Okay.
You need to do that.

1228
01:14:03.970 --> 01:14:08.970
Or a lane lane in a nice comfy bed and watch American greed

1229
01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:13.700
laying as comfy bed and watch American greed.
Let's fucking do that.
Alright,

1230
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:15.790
go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.

1231
01:14:15.791 --> 01:14:18.460
Thank you for listening and thank you to everybody who came out on this tour.

1232
01:14:18.461 --> 01:14:23.050
Man,
I had a great time and uh,
I will see you next time.
And uh,

1233
01:14:23.051 --> 01:14:23.980
that's it.
All right.
See Ya.
