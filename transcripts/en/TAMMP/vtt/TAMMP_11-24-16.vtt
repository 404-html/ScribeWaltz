1
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:01.870
Okay.

2
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.500
<v 1>Okay.
What's going on is bill burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon,</v>

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.720
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

4
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.970
just checking in on you.
Oh,
I've just chow.

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.010
Happy Turkey day to you.
Oh,
you know,

6
00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:25.090
stuffing and potatoes and pie and beer.

7
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.880
Cranberries and gravy.

8
00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:32.740
And your cousin who's gay?
Um,
hey,

9
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.910
what's going on?
How are you?
Happy thanksgiving.

10
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.720
Happy not having to fucking go to work today.
Huh?

11
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.770
You around the table and just sitting down yet?
Well,

12
00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:47.350
if you haven't gone downstairs yet,
I got,
I got some advice for you.

13
00:00:47.351 --> 00:00:48.610
Today is going to be a day.

14
00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:51.400
I think that's going to be a lot of fucking arguments.

15
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.960
A lot of fucking arguments at the table,
right?
The big fucking election.

16
00:00:55.961 --> 00:01:00.670
Some people wanted the guy with the eyebrows.
Some people wanted the fucking

17
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.180
with the pants suit,
right?
Um,

18
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.150
this is what you got to to see you.
You're already going to have a fight,
right?

19
00:01:10.151 --> 00:01:11.830
There's already going to be your older brother.

20
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.310
Then it's going to be this person.
Then it's going to be another per,

21
00:01:15.311 --> 00:01:17.740
somebody's going to say something,
right?
And you're going to be,

22
00:01:17.741 --> 00:01:19.690
you're going to have a couple of wild fucking turkeys.

23
00:01:19.691 --> 00:01:21.190
He's just standing over there,
you know,

24
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.210
eating a fucking appetizer or two and somebody is going to be getting on your

25
00:01:25.211 --> 00:01:29.770
nerves.
Maybe somebody fucking wife who won't shut the fuck up,

26
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.450
right?
Why the fuck did he marry?
Or maybe maybe it's the husband,

27
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.910
Jesus Christ.
What is she doing with this guy?

28
00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:38.800
All he does is fucking talk about himself.

29
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.520
Something's going to drive you up the fucking wall.
If it's not this,

30
00:01:42.521 --> 00:01:44.950
it's going to be that this is,
this is the phrase,

31
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.130
this is the phrase that's going to save your day.
Okay?

32
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.380
Saved the whole fucking day.
Cause you're not can change anybody's opinion.
Oh,

33
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:55.120
these fucking jerk off.
Still yelling.
He Hug.
Well,
could you vote for Trump?
Well,

34
00:01:55.121 --> 00:01:57.070
what the Fuck About Hillary?
You're not changing.

35
00:01:57.071 --> 00:01:58.570
You're just gonna fucking yell at each other.

36
00:01:58.571 --> 00:02:02.500
So here's the phrase she got to use to get through this fucking day.
All right.

37
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.320
Along with the alcohol or whatever drug you fucking want to use.

38
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.640
Just fair enough.

39
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.720
<v 0>No.
Hey,
fair enough.</v>

40
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.590
<v 1>That's all I,
that's all you gotta do.
What'd you say?</v>

41
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.720
<v 0>Hey,
hey guys,
guys,
guys,
fair enough.
Fair enough.
Whatever.</v>

42
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.320
<v 1>You don't need to see them anymore right now.</v>

43
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:25.890
If you're younger and you still live there,
that's kind of fucking tough.
Uh,

44
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:27.960
I don't know what to tell you,
but if you've already moved out of the house,

45
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:29.850
why are you still arguing with these people?

46
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.000
Why are you still trying to change their fucking minds?

47
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.510
You're not going to change their minds.
All right?
I don't give a fuck.

48
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:41.010
If you majored in debating it,
just stupid fucking skull in the woods,

49
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.350
whatever the fuck it is.
You did that.

50
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:47.310
Now you're coming back and now you think you know something and you think that

51
00:02:47.311 --> 00:02:51.240
you fucking siblings want to hear it.
You know what?
They don't the same way.

52
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.760
You don't want to hear the way they fucking eat.
When they had,

53
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.160
they've had a couple,
two,
three,
right?
And all of a sudden the man,

54
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.010
everything just sounds like they're eating fucking mashed potatoes.
You

55
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.770
<v 3>know,
you started having these murderers fucking thoughts,
you know,</v>

56
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.720
just fair enough.
Hey,
fair enough.
Whenever it,

57
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.690
whenever it was that what you think is that?
Is that how you look at the world?

58
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:14.530
Hey God bless Ya.
Pass the fucking peas and carrots.

59
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.680
Fair enough.
Fair enough.
You know,

60
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.870
and that's all you got to do that eventually the meal's going to be over.

61
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.980
All right,

62
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.530
and you're going to get in your fucking car and you're going to drive away

63
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.340
unless you stay in there for the weekend.
Then you got to go out to the,

64
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.190
I don't know what you got to.
Oh,
but you gotta write,

65
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.270
you gotta get the fuck out of there.
Yeah.
Thanksgiving is a took.

66
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.061
It's such a great day.

67
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:44.080
There's no pressure to get any gifts eaten a bunch of great food.

68
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.620
All of that is tremendous.
Okay.
Unless,

69
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.670
unless you go into her fucking family's house or his family's house,

70
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.080
that's a weird one because you know you're used to all your family's food and

71
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:56.770
thanksgiving.

72
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.200
You know how it's supposed to taste that you're going to go somewhere else.

73
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:01.930
It's going to taste a little bit different.
You know,

74
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.280
this is like a classic standup bit,
like here's how it usually is,

75
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:10.240
but when you fucking blah,
blah,
blah,
it's a whole different story,

76
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.280
right?
Then you just got to suck it up and just be like,
you know,

77
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.770
worst case scenario,
this absolutely fucking sucks,
you know,

78
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.280
in which case,
fair enough.
You know,
you don't know how to cook.
Okay,

79
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:27.100
you're supposed to cook today.
You know,
it's,

80
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:32.080
it's like when it's somebody's birthday,
most people can't sing,
but God damn it,

81
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:36.940
you got to sing the songs.
So they do the best they can.
Happy Birthday,

82
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.780
right?
They do what the fuck they can.
Well,

83
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:42.270
sometimes she got to take the,
the,

84
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.280
the same fucking theory of a tone deaf person singing happy birthday to you

85
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:52.300
because they love you.
Right?
You get,
you got to apply that to food,

86
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.670
which is a motherfucker,

87
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.780
which brings it to how do I make it look like I ate the shit when I really

88
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:03.040
didn't?
Well,
oh Jesus,

89
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:06.780
I don't know how to do this one.
What you gotta do is you've got to fucking,
uh,

90
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.140
you got to engage in a lot of conversation as you just sort of fucking hitting

91
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:15.010
the plate with your fork a little bit as if you almost like,

92
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.860
you know that noise people make when they want someone to make a speech.

93
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:21.700
That annoying fucking thing,
you know?
Oh my God,

94
00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:24.190
nothing fucking makes my damn blood boil.

95
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.000
Like when I'm in the middle of a fucking conversation at some cut starts hitting

96
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:31.810
the glass with the fork and then for whatever social fucking reason I have to

97
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:36.490
now shut up,
you know?
Oh my God,
that gets me God.

98
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.780
But not today.
Not Today.
Everybody.
Hey,
fair enough.
Hey,
somebody sounds,

99
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.730
something's down the fucking street over there with a little,

100
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:47.680
a little fucking spoon knocking against some glass.
You know,

101
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.510
I guess we all have to start as adults.
We have to shut the fuck up,
right?

102
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.890
Like we're working for this asshole bay.
You know what?
Hey,
fair enough.

103
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.330
Fair enough.
You know,
he just fucking sit there.
Oh,

104
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:06.530
here we go.
Oh good.
Oh,
here's a cliched what?
I'm thankful for speech.
Oh,

105
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:09.230
is that what you're thankful for?
I'm thankful for lady.

106
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.160
Every fucking word that comes out of your mouth is one less worry.

107
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.650
It was one word closer to the end of whatever the fuck it is you're saying.

108
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.383
<v 0>You know,</v>

109
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.210
<v 3>that's when you know you're the passive aggressive move is when someone's in the</v>

110
00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:25.330
middle of that is you.
You're fucking as some,
it is just kind of pointed.

111
00:06:25.331 --> 00:06:29.290
Somebody pointed some a plate,
you know,
little fucking,

112
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.770
give me that button right there.
They're still Yammer and on,
you know,

113
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.330
you know back in 1983 when we first saw this house,
right?

114
00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:39.280
And you just sit in their butter and your fucking roll.

115
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.510
Oh is this why the fuck are going to go every God damn year from 1983 hey,

116
00:06:46.511 --> 00:06:51.430
you know what?
Fair enough.
Fair enough.
Yeah.
I didn't want to wear this sweater.

117
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:52.383
Right?

118
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.170
He's fucking have these potatoes instant these fucking potatoes it.
Hey,

119
00:06:58.171 --> 00:07:02.250
fair enough.
Hey,
you didn't,
you didn't have time to fucking cook rail once.

120
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.420
Maybe they ran out of him down the clothes the last fucking time they ever ran

121
00:07:06.421 --> 00:07:10.200
out of potatoes.
They never run out of potatoes and this country,

122
00:07:10.201 --> 00:07:14.580
it's why so many fucking Irish people over here,
right?
Fucking Irish man,

123
00:07:14.581 --> 00:07:18.030
they tapped out on their own country one fucking time and their whole history,

124
00:07:18.031 --> 00:07:21.600
they run out of potatoes and everybody fucking jump ship.
Right?

125
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.140
But not the real Irishman.
The Real Irishmen and real ladies,

126
00:07:26.141 --> 00:07:27.660
they fucking stuck around.

127
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.030
<v 0>Okay.</v>

128
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.560
<v 3>I like these cowards that I'll move to fucking New Jersey.</v>

129
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.700
But you know what a fair enough,
you know,
they wanted some potatoes.

130
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.180
This is one of these days people,

131
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.630

132
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.470
it doesn't get better then,
you know,
cause you don't know any better.

133
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.400
So the food tastes the way the fucking food is supposed to taste in your world.

134
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.520
Right?
Everyone who's supposed to be there is there,

135
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.693
<v 0>you know?</v>

136
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.480
<v 3>So when you get older and you start expanding your fucking world and all of a</v>

137
00:08:06.481 --> 00:08:10.200
sudden you know Jesus Christ,
I mean you're sitting there with somebody,

138
00:08:10.201 --> 00:08:12.600

139
00:08:12.601 --> 00:08:17.130
I don't even know if I'm with the right person right now.
What the fuck am I day?

140
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.410
You know what?
Hey,

Be Fair enough.

141
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.690
I'm with somebody that I probably was never really in love with but didn't

142
00:08:25.691 --> 00:08:29.710
realize what love was.
You know,
and now here I am,

143
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:31.230
<v 0>okay.</v>

144
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:36.230
<v 3>And all I gotta do is not get in an argument for one fucking day.</v>

145
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.510
I can do this right by Saturday.

146
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.440
I want to be out of this fucking relationship and you know what all I'm going to

147
00:08:43.441 --> 00:08:47.910
be thankful then
you bet your sweet fun.

148
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:50.743
<v 0>MMM.</v>

149
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.630
<v 3>Oh my God.
If it starts going into politics,
if it starts going into politics,</v>

150
00:08:57.631 --> 00:09:01.770
you almost need like a referee during this period of us history to just

151
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:04.460
literally step in with one of those footlocker,

152
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:08.040
fucking athlete's foot ref shirts,
blower fucking whistle,

153
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.000
and just send the two people to opposite fucking Lazy Boys.

154
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.670
Let it go.
Let it Aa.
It's all she went home.
She went out saw.

155
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:22.940
Okay.
She's not coming back.
I don't think she's got a third runner.

156
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.260
All right.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Sit Down Buddy.

157
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.290
Nobody's building a wall today.
Okay.
Just fucking relax.

158
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.480
Maybe it could be the peacemaker.

159
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.970
Who knows who the fuck knows.
Um,
I'm actually very excited.

160
00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:42.300
You wouldn't know it this year for Thanksgiving because I'm back in my house.

161
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.460
The kitchen is done.
Oh my God.
The fucking kitchen is unbelievable.

162
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.640
My lovely wife fucking freaked when she saw she wasn't looking at it.

163
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.280
You know,
she says like,
I just want to say it when it's done.

164
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.140
I want to see it when it's done.
I didn't,

165
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.530
I was peeking at the presence the whole time.
Ruin in my Christmas,

166
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.880
but I will send it makes somebody had to make sure that shit was looking.

167
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.480
All right.
All right.
So,
uh,

168
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.760
she got to see it from basically a gutted kitchen to just Bam right there,

169
00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:15.480
Fred or fucking brand new kitchen and uh,
it's absolutely gorgeous.

170
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:18.480
The people who built it.
You know what?
That's what I'm thankful for.

171
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.330
The people who fucking built it,
man.
It's like a,

172
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.040
I can't believe that that thing is in my house and I get to go in there and make

173
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:30.660
myself a little Lego [inaudible] this morning with some bacon and all that.

174
00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:32.850
By the way,
I bought that fucking grill top.

175
00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:38.610
I bought that lid fucking griddle thing last night and a knee has pissed at me.

176
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.340
Sort of.
You wait,
I'm going to make our one grand slam breakfast right?

177
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.500
And watch a,
shut the fuck up.

178
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.400
A little bit of fucking Hash Brown some fucking Bacon,
right?

179
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.580
Slight the Bacon over and you cook the fucking eggs and the crease of the Bacon.

180
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.970
Nick.
Nobody can handle it.
I don't know why the fuck we have gone down.

181
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.610
Him Obey all those fucking people down there.
If you want him to talk,

182
00:10:56.611 --> 00:11:00.060
he just make them a grand slam breakfast with the eggs cooked in the grease from

183
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:03.420
the bacon and just be like,
hey buddy,
not for nothing.

184
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:07.200
I don't know what people told you,
but this right here,
this is America.

185
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.850
Okay,
well she's got to answer a couple of questions here.

186
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.960
I Dunno what the fuck I'm talking about.
It's early out here.

187
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.990
Give me a fucking break.
All right.
What do you want from me?
Okay,

188
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:25.080
you don't like the park can say,
guess what?
Fair enough.
Fair enough.
I get it.

189
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.340
It's plenty of the podcast and you,
you enjoy good God.
All things.
Comedy,

190
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.130
wonderful podcast network.

191
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:38.730
Go check our Irish affair skeptic tank.
You know the per Chrysler podcast.

192
00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:42.240
I don't know what the fucking names of Omar.
What am I?
What am I being for?

193
00:11:42.241 --> 00:11:46.970
Fucking encyclopedia podcasting over here.
Um,

194
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.920
yeah,
there's going to be a lot of arguments today and it'll be a victory if I'm,

195
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.260
you know,
if you don't get in,

196
00:11:56.261 --> 00:12:00.490
what maybe it could be that person that keeps everybody out of it is everybody

197
00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:02.740
starts screaming and yelling,
you know,
you know,
he's

198
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.850
<v 4>fucking checks offended,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Well,
she's a fucking day,</v>

199
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.040
all that type of shit.
And you can be in the back.
I like

200
00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.850
<v 3>just walk right in the middle of it.
Oh Man.</v>

201
00:12:16.851 --> 00:12:21.380
I want to see a compilation of youtube videos of the political fucking,

202
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.910
I almost said discourse.
That's probably the wrong fucking word.

203
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.260
Do you realize how many fucking words I know that I don't even know what the

204
00:12:30.261 --> 00:12:34.300
fuck they mean.
I just know what words they go with.
You know,

205
00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.150
discourse goes with political,
political discourse.

206
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.180
You know,
you used the word or Nate when you were in a theater.

207
00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:50.450
I don't know what it means.
I remember,
you know,

208
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.120
I got a computer I can look at,
Hey,
fair enough.
I can look it up.
Why am I,

209
00:12:54.121 --> 00:12:56.510
I'm going to bore you guys with a shit.
Um,
so when he was,

210
00:12:56.511 --> 00:12:59.180
I'm back in my house and,
uh,

211
00:12:59.181 --> 00:13:01.640
one of the great things about being back in my house is when I get back to my

212
00:13:01.641 --> 00:13:06.200
house.
Okay.
I get back to all my sports packages.

213
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:10.940
Okay.
I got to fucking Santa Rice package.
Not Bragging.
I'm thankful for it.

214
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:15.410
You know,
I have it.
You don't hate.
Fair enough.
Come on over.
All right.

215
00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.110
I got the fucking NBA one.
I don't even know what it's called.

216
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.990
I just watched the Celtics.
To me it's a Celtics network.

217
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:22.760
I'll watch the first half yesterday.

218
00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:26.750
We'd do it all right against the fucking Brooklyn Nets.
You know,

219
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.060
I think it's cool they moved to Brooklyn,

220
00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.700
that place when they were in New Jersey.
I was just sad.

221
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.600
It was just a sad fucking place,
you know,
maybe not for the devils,

222
00:13:35.601 --> 00:13:38.210
but for the nets.
It was fucking sad,
you know,

223
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:42.890
admitted New Jersey people you never had love for him.
You know,

224
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.640
then that's where like that foreign exchange student who never fucking went
home,

225
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.420
you know,
or whatever.
You adopted a kid cause you thought it was a good idea.

226
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.320
You know,
you saw one of these fucking stylists out here doing it.

227
00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:58.040
You're like all,
I will do it.
Fuck it.
We'll take them on.

228
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:02.390
What did they have a duty?
You had some good years of Jason Kidd.

229
00:14:02.391 --> 00:14:05.360
I'm sorry if I'm fucking knocking this halls around my mouth.

230
00:14:05.361 --> 00:14:09.680
I've had this fucking cough for God damn.
I don't know,
like two fucking weeks,

231
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.400
you know,
cause my,
my,
my wife with the condition she's in,

232
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:18.680
she's fucking always hot so she's got the Goddamn ac going and it just dries out

233
00:14:18.681 --> 00:14:19.161
my throat.

234
00:14:19.161 --> 00:14:23.570
I've never been someone I fucking hate air conditioning unless it's like 9,000

235
00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:27.020
fucking degrees out then I like it.
Other than that,
I don't like sleeping,

236
00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:32.810
you know,
feeling like I'm camping in my goddamn house.

237
00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.630
You know?
I like it.
Like,
you know,
nice fucking,
you know,

238
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:41.390
70 71 degrees.
I need a seven.
That first number's got to be a seven.

239
00:14:41.391 --> 00:14:45.980
Like the price is right.
You know,
let's see that seven,
right?

240
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.180
You start getting into this sixes.
I'll wake up the next day.
I'm stuffy.

241
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:54.070
I got a fucking my,
my throat's killing me.
I Dunno.

242
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.190
And I'll tell you,
people speaking at killing me,
I've been a,

243
00:14:58.191 --> 00:15:01.070
I'm starting to begin,
uh,

244
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:06.100
the building of my new hour and obviously having a kid is going to be a whole

245
00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:10.370
new angle for me,
but the kid's not here yet,
so,
uh,

246
00:15:10.371 --> 00:15:13.970
I've just been up on stage just fucking throwing shit against the wall.

247
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:16.820
And last night I went up,
did like 12 minutes,

248
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:22.280
nothing from my other act and I just,
Jesus Christ,

249
00:15:22.281 --> 00:15:25.640
you want to talk about just feeling like you have nothing just being punched out

250
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:31.280
and uh,
I actually have some leftover shit I could have probably done,

251
00:15:31.281 --> 00:15:33.160
but whatever I did all right.
I did it right.

252
00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:37.730
Went down there with a friend of mine just fucking knocking out new shit.

253
00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.540
We'll see.
We'll see my specialist coming out in January,

254
00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:44.510
so I'm hoping I have a very inspirational December.

255
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.960
Actually that's not true because I don't really,

256
00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:52.940
I don't have any road gigs until February and uh,
all do.

257
00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:57.470
I have some fucking road gigs were putting together one in fucking Charlotte.

258
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.810
And I know what you'd thinking like,
dude,
you were just fucking there.

259
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.330
I'm going to be doing the club there because,
uh,

260
00:16:02.331 --> 00:16:05.990
the following day I'm going to Duke Carolina.
Oh yeah,

261
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.640
go fuck yourselves.

262
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.860
I'm going to go see coach k at Duke.
Can't fucking wait.

263
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.370
It's going to be fucking crazy.
Absolute legendary,

264
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.700
legendary bucket list.
You know,

265
00:16:19.701 --> 00:16:23.600
I gotta get my college who fucking games going here.
Yeah,

266
00:16:23.601 --> 00:16:27.980
I saw Indiana University,
Indiana Hoosiers,
who by the way,

267
00:16:27.981 --> 00:16:29.720
would they fucking lose to the other day

268
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.710
like Indiana regional technical something or other?

269
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.970
It's their first fucking win of any goddamn ranked team ever.

270
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.790
I really should know the name.
I apologize that I don't,

271
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.980
I saw my adopted college team,
Kansas.
Um,

272
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.550
I don't know if they won their tournament.

273
00:16:46.551 --> 00:16:49.280
I was watching a little bit of that Wisconsin when I watched the,
uh,

274
00:16:49.281 --> 00:16:54.281
the semifinals when Wisconsin beat a Georgetown and I missed the final,

275
00:16:55.851 --> 00:16:57.120
which was Wisconsin versa,

276
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.040
UNC because I went out and I was doing my homework last night and uh,

277
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.270
but I'm a Jay Hawks Fan.

278
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:06.590
I don't even know why I always wanted to go to their fucking,
the field house,

279
00:17:06.591 --> 00:17:09.260
whatever the fuck they call it.
I,
that's a bucket list thing for me.

280
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:12.800
I went to an Indiana Hoosier game way back in the day when Bobby Knight was

281
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:16.640
still there.
The year Michigan State won the,
uh,
one,

282
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:18.440
the title early two thousands.

283
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:23.180
I went there and I scalped a student ticket and I was so fucking excited.

284
00:17:23.181 --> 00:17:26.060
Then when I got to the gate,
the guy's looking at me.
I make that point.

285
00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:27.980
I was like fucking in my thirties and shit,
right?

286
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.880
So the guy's looking at me like,
dude,
you're not a student.
And I was,

287
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.150
I had nothing.
I just went,
come on
Nigga.
Sorry.
Kidding.

288
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.340
I remember when that came out of my mouth.
I was like going,
Oh fuck.

289
00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:43.120
I'm not getting in.
Come on.
That's all you had.
You didn't go with,

290
00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:47.870
I'm a graduate student or I got that Brad Pitt disease from that fucking movie

291
00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:52.230
he did with Taraji p Henson.
Remember when he came out as an old baby?

292
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.830
I would tell you this story.
When I watched that movie,

293
00:17:55.831 --> 00:17:57.390
how much I annoyed the woman in front of me.

294
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.460
There's a scene in there when this dude is trying to fuck this chick and the

295
00:18:02.461 --> 00:18:06.330
fucking old baby won't shut the fuck up.
And I forget what he said,

296
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.840
but the look on his face was basically like,
lady,

297
00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:13.290
if you don't get that 80 year old baby,
the fuck out of here.
I swear to,

298
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:18.240
I can't remember.
I was fucking crying,
laughing,
you know,

299
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.200
typical comedian.

300
00:18:19.201 --> 00:18:22.440
It was supposed to be this really heavy emotional moment that's supposed to

301
00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:27.360
bring tears and instead,
I don't know if you're a comedian,
it just,

302
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.050
it just makes you laugh your ass off.
Cause when I'm,
what am I going to them?

303
00:18:30.051 --> 00:18:34.290
It's fucking sitting there crime and it God damn mall.
I'll cry about that.

304
00:18:34.291 --> 00:18:35.400
I'll cry that I'm in a mall.

305
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:39.900
I'm not going to fucking cry while in a mall watching a movie right

306
00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:44.700
now.
Maybe I should have.
Maybe that's what the fuck's wrong with me.
But anyways,

307
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.090
um,
so I'll be watching.
I'll be talking about the brewing.
I watched,

308
00:18:48.091 --> 00:18:51.990
I did watch the Bruins versa.
The fuck were we playing?

309
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:56.910
I know we got Ottawa.
How do you watch a Goddamn game?

310
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.330
He can't remember who the fuck they played.

311
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:03.000
All I know is Ciara went down in the second period.

312
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:05.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

313
00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:07.570
<v 3>Well it was one to nothing.
There was one.
Oh,
we played the blues,</v>

314
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.660
my adopted West Western Conference fucking team.
That's right.

315
00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.530
It was one of the one then it was to one us than to to them.

316
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.770
Right with Ciara went out.
That's when it started fucking going downhill.

317
00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.040
Ended up being four to a nice fucking home loss.
You know,
it was great.

318
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.630
I fucking put it on the center ice package.

319
00:19:22.631 --> 00:19:25.810
They were like a Barilla is at a nice fucking winning streak.
Yeah.

320
00:19:25.811 --> 00:19:30.520
Cause all freckles.
Fucking put it on
and it was,

321
00:19:30.521 --> 00:19:32.800
what the fuck am I talking about here?
I got to,
I got to read a little bit.

322
00:19:32.801 --> 00:19:35.680

327
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:54.620

Legacy box off the most legendary piece of fucking ass out there.

361
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:08.200
Legacy box.
Uh,
when was the last time you watched your home movies?

362
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.860
If you're like most Americans,
there's a box in your closet of videotapes,

363
00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.330
film reels and photos that don't get watched or taken out.
Worst.

364
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.930
They're actually deteriorating.
Well,
that's scary.
That's good.

365
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:21.550
Now they got me scared.

Introducing legacy bucks as simple and affordable way to get your recorded

367
00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:29.440
moments digitally preserved on a DVD or a thumb drive.

368
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.850
Can I do a little aside here?
I think I speak for everyone.

369
00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.810
When you have that porno you made with your girl that you don't know where it
is,

370
00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:41.470
just make sure you look at this shit before you send it to these fucking people

371
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.400
are legacy box is going to take a whole nother meaning there.

372
00:22:45.401 --> 00:22:47.920
here's how it works.

This is so perfect.

378
00:23:06.671 --> 00:23:08.080
If nobody knows who the fuck you are,

379
00:23:08.081 --> 00:23:10.840
I can't do this because I'd love to do this with all my old standup tapes,

380
00:23:10.841 --> 00:23:14.830
but I know that they would end up on fucking youtube and I cannot have that.

381
00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:15.341
All right.

382
00:23:15.341 --> 00:23:19.510
Legacy box takes care of everything and provides updates at every step of the

383
00:23:19.511 --> 00:23:20.344

That's because they're getting paid to.

Even Disney has trusted legacy box to digitize their media.

This is amazing place.

416
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:31.370

420
00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:48.620
Probably what he did the first two times.
That's why you keep rehiring him.

421
00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.330
Raw hiring,
rehiring.
All right.
The entire Monte Python catalog,

422
00:25:53.331 --> 00:25:57.020
the it crowd and Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge.

423
00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:58.520
Discover the next big,

424
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:03.580
big names in comedy and watched the icons before they make it big like Louis Ck,

425
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:08.150

Chelsea Peretti,
Amy fucking shit.

426
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:13.850
Bo Burnham and so many more.
That's fucking hilarious.

427
00:26:13.851 --> 00:26:17.360
Those last three started like fucking 10 years after me and the talking to them

428
00:26:17.361 --> 00:26:19.910
like they're these old,
grizzled vets.
How fucking old am I?

429
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:25.450
Critically acclaimed originals and exclusive content like Harmon quests created

430
00:26:26.271 --> 00:26:30.860
by comedian Dan Harmon.
Well,
that's very modest of [inaudible] and funny as hell.

431
00:26:30.861 --> 00:26:35.330
A variety show featuring comedians such as Jim Jefferies and Hannibal Burress.

432
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:40.520
If you're serious about comedy,
you gotta try CSO stream at any time.

436
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:53.520
When you use the Promo Code [inaudible] at checkout,

437
00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:56.250
I want to see every fucking episode of SNL,

[inaudible] all right,</v>

442
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.900
I'll give you a break here for my fucking reading out loud.
Um,

443
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.820
so anyways,
I've been playing drums like a fucking lunatic.

444
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:19.970
Been playing two hours a day for almost every day.

445
00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:23.840
I missed yesterday because it was the day before fucking thanksgiving.

446
00:27:23.841 --> 00:27:26.040
We had a run around or go get some shit.
Oh,
I didn't mention.
Yeah.

447
00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:27.860
So this year I'm not,
I'm not having,

448
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:30.920
we're not having Thanksgiving here despite the fact,
you know,

449
00:27:30.921 --> 00:27:34.970
we have a brand new kitchen.
We were planning to fucking have people over.

450
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:38.060
And then what happened?
Every,
all of a sudden a couple of people dropped out,

451
00:27:38.061 --> 00:27:40.550
everything went out the window,
and then we had to scramble.

452
00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:45.490
Now we've got all this fucking food,
but whatever.
I get the grill top coming.

453
00:27:45.491 --> 00:27:47.150
Oh,
fucking cook it later.
Uh,

454
00:27:47.151 --> 00:27:50.330
we're actually calling an audible and we're going over to some friend's house,

455
00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.350
which is perfect,
you know,
because we're traveling the day of.

456
00:27:54.351 --> 00:27:56.870
So most people aren't going to be on the fucking road.
They're already there,

457
00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:58.303
you know?

458
00:27:58.550 --> 00:27:59.150
<v 0>Okay.</v>

459
00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:01.790
<v 3>Already get into an argument because they didn't listen to this podcast and they</v>

460
00:28:01.791 --> 00:28:05.350
didn't know enough to be like,
hey man,
fair enough.
Fair enough.
Hey,

461
00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:09.730
is that what you think?
God bless you for thinking that you think that,

462
00:28:09.731 --> 00:28:11.770
and I'm not going to change you from thinking that,

463
00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:13.780
but I don't need to think what you think.

464
00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:17.950
And you know what all I have to do is eat with you today.
That's it.

465
00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.860
Then I'm going to walk into the fucking living room,
you know?

466
00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

467
00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.730
<v 3>Well,
I go in there to watch the football game.
Oh fuck.</v>

468
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.120
Are you watching the Westminster dog show instead of the football?
Hey,
hey,

469
00:28:28.121 --> 00:28:29.680
fair enough.
Fair enough.

470
00:28:29.681 --> 00:28:32.860
You'd like to watch a bunch of clean poodles prints and around,
you know,

471
00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:37.660
I don't get it,
but you get it.
You got here first,
whenever,

472
00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.830
whenever you got a vagina,
you run things.
Even though you always say you don't.

473
00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:47.170
Okay,
go ahead.
Do it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
Look at that giant float.

474
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.580
Oh my God.
Remember?
Bullwinkle of course.
Of course I do.

475
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:54.900
Um,
anyways,

476
00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.470
we're going to a friend's house and all I have to do is just bring the fucking

477
00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.450
liquor and I'm,

478
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:04.870
and I'm good to go near is bringing over a tray of fucking Mac and cheese and

479
00:29:04.871 --> 00:29:06.390
that's it.
And then we're going to go over there.

480
00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:08.140
We're going to eat and have a good fucking time.

481
00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:10.360
I'll fair enough my way through the whole fucking party.

482
00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:15.580
I'll get my God damn car.
I drive home.
No leftovers,
no fucking munch in a way.

483
00:29:15.581 --> 00:29:20.440
Putting out a ton of God damn way,
you know.
Perfect fucking perfect.

484
00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:23.890
Um,
so anyways,
so I've been,
I've been,
uh,

485
00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:27.880
playing drums,
like a fucking loony text,
but yesterday,
you know,

486
00:29:27.881 --> 00:29:29.560
I got all these nieces and nephews and shit.

487
00:29:29.561 --> 00:29:33.850
I got to buy him some fucking toys and uh,
you know,
so I was out there buying,

488
00:29:33.851 --> 00:29:38.380
you know,
just,
I don't know a bunch of God Damn Shit and uh,

489
00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:40.350
<v 0>okay.</v>

490
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:44.140
<v 3>I Dunno God,
the fucking people that go in Friday,
you know,</v>

491
00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.480
it's too late to tell you guys this,
but you know,
you know,

492
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.650
if you don't have money,
you got to go out on Friday,
right?

493
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.350
You got to get that 40% off that fucking thing.

494
00:29:53.351 --> 00:29:54.330
That's not even going to be there.

495
00:29:54.331 --> 00:29:56.680
And then you get in the store and everything else is regular price,
right?

496
00:29:56.681 --> 00:29:57.520
You got to get out there.

497
00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:02.390
You literally have to risk getting fucking trampled to go get the next Goddamn

498
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:06.430
game boy,
a flip phone,
whatever the fuck it is your kid wants,
you know,
next year.

499
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:12.880
Why don't you like,
you know,
there's two ways you can,

500
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:16.680
there's three ways you can deal black Friday.
Okay?
One,
all right.

501
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:22.120
Save up some fucking money,
you know,
by some less expensive gifts.

502
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:27.970
Shoplift,
you know,
shoplift on a day that is in black Friday.

503
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.960
Or maybe you want to do it on black Friday because then he can fuck you got the

504
00:30:31.961 --> 00:30:34.690
cover of everybody getting stampeded.
They're not going to realize,
you know,

505
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:40.330
you got to Hibachi underneath your fucking,
there you go ladies.

506
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.870
This is what you do.
You buy some fucking maternity wear.
Okay.

507
00:30:43.871 --> 00:30:46.750
And then you put a fucking a bace underneath the,
Oh my God.
You know,

508
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.480
how many months are you?
Holy Shit.
Is that an Audi right with,
that's the handle.

509
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:56.770
I'm sorry.
Anyways,
okay.
So that's one way of doing it.

510
00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:00.610
The second way is if you know you're going to go down there.
All right?

511
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.910
What you gotta do?
You gotta do a lot of squats.
Okay.

512
00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.130
And I take a little bit of Jujitsu cause you know,

513
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.950
you know the fights going to the floor.
Okay.

514
00:31:08.951 --> 00:31:12.890
And don't practice on those fucking rubber mats that they have in the dose.

515
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:17.770
All right?
You want to get on a nice fucking Lindell linoleum floor.
Okay?

516
00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.710
So when you skip the hip and you try to fucking turn them over,

517
00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.600
like it's going to be a different surface.
Now,

518
00:31:22.601 --> 00:31:26.530
if you've been practicing on a on one,
those AMF mats,

519
00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.170
like all of a sudden you're on the floor,
you know it's going to,
you could,

520
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.440
you might,
you know,
you might throw out your hip trying to slide on that thing.

521
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:36.480
All right?
I would definitely add some weights.
A lot of big girls,

522
00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:41.290
not a big girls show up.
Big Girls show up on fucking black Friday.
All right?

523
00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:44.540
There's a lot of weight there.
So maybe I'd take a little a kito.

524
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:48.160
I'd learn how to use their fucking,
you know,
all that,

525
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:52.420
all that physics coming at you,
is that right word?
Whatever the fuck it is.

526
00:31:52.421 --> 00:31:56.230
All that way.
You've just got to have it pass right through.
You like water.

527
00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:00.220
That's what they always say.
Write an Asian culture.
You gotta be like water,

528
00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:03.250
you know?
Oh,
is that what I got to do?
I don't.
They do it.

529
00:32:03.251 --> 00:32:05.590
I can never touch my fucking toes the way you're doing it right now.

530
00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.620
I'm not like water.
Okay.
I'm like the cup that holds the fucking water.

531
00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.690
So how about that?
Right?

532
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.050
I know water can drown you and I know that water can fucking,
you know,

533
00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:18.490
you know,
it takes the form of whatever shape it's poured into,

534
00:32:18.491 --> 00:32:21.340
but would you like to meet a smash this fucking cup over you had?
Yeah,

535
00:32:21.341 --> 00:32:26.260
I didn't think so.
So being a cup.
Okay.
Or a fucking Sausa also.

536
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:31.840
Okay,
I interrupted.
You know what?
Hey.
Hey.
Kung Fu master Jetta guy.
Hey,

537
00:32:31.841 --> 00:32:36.220
fair enough.
Fair enough.
I'll become a water.
No,
the fuck I gotta do it.

538
00:32:36.221 --> 00:32:39.080
Are you gonna do?
Huh?
What am I going do called?

539
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.380
Couple of fucking orders of food here.
Say Bend over at the waist.

540
00:32:42.381 --> 00:32:45.440
Gradually stretching my ham.
He says that,
what the fuck I'm supposed to do?
Dude,

541
00:32:45.441 --> 00:32:49.670
it's your fucking world.
Whatever you want me to do here.
Okay.

542
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.610
There's then option and um,
I guess I said there's three options.

543
00:32:52.611 --> 00:32:54.920
You know what the third options could be.
You could just say,

544
00:32:54.921 --> 00:32:58.760
I don't observe the fucking holidays.
You know,
by the way,

545
00:32:58.761 --> 00:33:00.560
shout out to all the Jewish people today.
You know,

546
00:33:00.561 --> 00:33:03.380
they always get left out on Thanksgiving because of their religion.

547
00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.340
They don't celebrate it.
You know what I mean?
They just,
they know.

548
00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:12.890
I was trying to say that,
you know,
I said that to me yesterday.
Right.
And uh,

549
00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.620
I kind of mind fucked her cause they said it really quick.

550
00:33:15.621 --> 00:33:18.170
St Jewish people did not celebrate thanksgiving.
You know,

551
00:33:18.171 --> 00:33:21.500
obviously it's Christmas,
but you,
you know,
it's the holidays,
you know,

552
00:33:21.501 --> 00:33:22.390
if you're not Jewish,
she's like,

553
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.880
you have a vague understanding of everybody else's fucking religion.
Right.

554
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.600
You know,
there's a day,
you know,
you know,

555
00:33:29.601 --> 00:33:31.370
there's a couple of Harlem with Jewish people,
you know,

556
00:33:31.371 --> 00:33:36.350
there's a couple of day offs we get because of their religion in September.

557
00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.410
All right?
Or at least days we don't have to try as hard.

558
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.730
And then there's a day they eat Chinese food,

559
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:47.240
which is I believe Christmas or is it,
I think it's Christmas,
right?

560
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:51.740
I don't know what the fuck they do on new years.
Nobody fucking knows.

561
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:54.200
So if you're not Jewish,
you can throw shit out like that.

562
00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:59.090
So I just throw out to near and like,
uh,
we're in the grocery store and I said,

563
00:33:59.091 --> 00:34:02.480
you know what?
Let's take time to give thanks.
You know,

564
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:05.600
and pray for all those Jewish people that don't celebrate thanksgiving.

565
00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.190
And then she just goes,

566
00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:13.100
that isn't remotely true or something like he was trying to do with math in her

567
00:34:13.101 --> 00:34:15.710
head.
I forget what the fuck she said and I died laughing.
I was like,

568
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:19.160
you had zero confidence in that right now.
And then she thought about,
she goes,

569
00:34:19.161 --> 00:34:23.270
no,
they'd sense some fights about fucking given thanks.
Everybody celebrates it

570
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.800
except for Isis.
Any terrorist.

571
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:33.110
Listen,
listening.
Do you guys have a thanksgiving?

572
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:35.970
What do you guys give?
Thanks for her.

573
00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:40.910
I can't go down that fucking road.

574
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:43.580
And it's going to be to God damn politically incorrect.

575
00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.730
That's something late night at a comedy club you can do,

576
00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:50.210
but not this day and age or all of a sudden.

577
00:34:50.211 --> 00:34:54.560
Then somebody takes this clip and uploads it to fucking drunk soccer

578
00:34:54.561 --> 00:34:59.561
mom@fourintheafternoon.org and all of a sudden fucking shut up.

579
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:06.680
There's drink your way to menopause lady.
All right.
A and o a Aka ladies,
ladies,

580
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.470
you know,
fair enough,
fair a fuck enough.

581
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:14.840
All you know,
Dasher and dancer and plants are in fixed and you know,

582
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:19.700
the capital records building already had their fucking Christmas tree up before

583
00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:23.810
thanksgiving.
I don't know what the fuck they're doing over there.
There's just,

584
00:35:23.811 --> 00:35:25.220
there's something wrong about that.

585
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.330
You know what about Tommy fucking Turkey?

586
00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.660
It was weird this year where I was in the grocery store and we were getting our

587
00:35:32.661 --> 00:35:37.220
fucking all this food for this party.
Evidently we're not having no,
um,

588
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:39.750
for the first time ever,

589
00:35:39.751 --> 00:35:43.380
I actually looked at a package of Turkey necks and I was like,
I'd eat that shit.

590
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:48.960
You know what I mean?
Decent me.
What do you,
how do you guys study?

591
00:35:48.961 --> 00:35:52.680
You guys prepare your,
your,
your,
uh,
Turkey necks.
Use it for a stew.

592
00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:56.760
Fuck.
All right,
here we go.

593
00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.170
Let's read a couple more of these that I'm going to get on the fucking
treadmill.

594
00:36:01.171 --> 00:36:03.600
Fuck today.
You know,
that's another good thing you can do in the morning time,

595
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:06.990
right?
Get on a fucking treadmill,
knock out a good half hour or whatever,

596
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.680
you know,
just kill the apps that you're going to eat today.
Um,
all right,

597
00:36:10.681 --> 00:36:14.250

Uh,
it was very nice to you.
Uh,

600
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:27.360
people said a lot of Nice Shit and now that doesn't happen a lot on social
media,

601
00:36:27.361 --> 00:36:28.950
so thank you very much.
All right.

631
00:38:29.791 --> 00:38:32.940
Just like that poor bastard that went to the cubs game a long time ago with his

632
00:38:32.941 --> 00:38:36.220
little fucking cassette tape Walkman,
you know,

633
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.130
and he stood up with another fucking for others,
cubs fans.

634
00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:43.210
But that Goddamn ball had to hit him and then that fucking left fielder had to

635
00:38:43.211 --> 00:38:44.890
fucking pointed back dude.

guy is,

638
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:54.730
that guy was actually the grizzly man then he got mauled to death in Alaska.

639
00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.780
Thanks to you cub fans.

669

670
00:40:36.581 --> 00:40:39.340
younger and they just go,
okay,
go into your settings.
It's like,

671
00:40:39.341 --> 00:40:44.341
Oh fuck you go into the bowels of this device and just start scrolling and then

672
00:40:45.191 --> 00:40:48.940
click on this and then another window opens up and then scroll down to this and

673
00:40:48.941 --> 00:40:49.900
then do this and then

674
00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:54.060
<v 1>do that.
And then in the end they're like,
okay,
did that change anything?</v>

675
00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:59.670
Uh,
now,
now at 10.
Oh,
that's odd.
Okay,
let's try this.

676
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.070
Oh,
I'm sorry.
Are we troubleshooting right now?

677
00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:08.100
Am I talking to somebody in the Malaysian islands trying to troubleshoot my

678
00:41:08.101 --> 00:41:09.000
fucking phone?

679
00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.820
<v 3>I swear to God,
half of this shit.
I just want to fucking mail it back.</v>

680
00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.550
I'm telling you,
man,
we should've just quit.

681
00:41:17.551 --> 00:41:22.160
And like 1995 1995 we had all the technology we need.
All right.

682
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:26.700
Cars had reared spoilers.
You know,
you had a VCR.

683
00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:28.650
VCR was great.

684
00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:34.430
BCI was great when you didn't know what DVD was when there was no youtube,
right.

685
00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:41.720
People paid for port.
It was a different time.
It really was.

686
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.340
You know,
that's what these fucking millennials are going to be nostalgic about.

687
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:50.120
Like lesser technology.
I have no idea.
I should talk,

688
00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.720
you know,
I don't fucking know.
You know,

689
00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:56.390
you know what I've been looking at lately is because they've got the little one

690
00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.120
coming and I want to fucking keep playing drums in the house.

691
00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:02.630
So I was thinking about getting electronic drum kit,
you know,

692
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.220
boil boy would share.
Great.

693
00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:07.490
If somebody hooked me up with electronic drum kit that I could promote for free

694
00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:12.030
on my podcast,
look at me working it.
Yeah.
Fuck that.
I'm going to buy it.

695
00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:15.270
I'm gonna buy it because if it sucks,
I'm going to tell you if it's sucks and on.

696
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:17.850
So I was looking at all these fucking,
um,

697
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:22.230
electronic drum kits and for my money,
Roland makes the best ones.

698
00:42:22.231 --> 00:42:24.140
They've always been ahead of everybody else.
So they got it.

699
00:42:24.141 --> 00:42:28.080
This fucking new one that actually comes with a 22 inch bass drum that looks

700
00:42:28.081 --> 00:42:30.660
like a real acoustic drum.
I don't know what the fuck's going on with it.

701
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:35.760
And I'm like,
holy fucking shit.
Look at that thing.
That's the one right there.

702
00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.590
Put your headphones on.

703
00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:40.800
All the wife hears is the sound of the sticks hitting the pads in on that.

704
00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:44.370
That's fucking it right there.
They want fucking 12 grand for this thing.

705
00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:50.390
Okay.
12 fucking grant.
Fuck that.

706
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:54.920
I'm going to wait like five years by that thing on Ebay for like 600 bucks.

707
00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.430
MMM.
But anyways,

708
00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:01.630
the thing I don't like about those electronic kits though is you sound way

709
00:43:01.631 --> 00:43:02.800
better than you really are.

710
00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.350
And then your ego starts going through the roof and you're just like,

711
00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.950
how am I not in a band that already fucking made it?

712
00:43:08.951 --> 00:43:13.240
And we all have Grammy's and gold records on the fucking wall.
And then one day,

713
00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:14.620
much to his Chagrin,

714
00:43:14.621 --> 00:43:17.950
you then go and you sit behind a real kid and you actually have to produce the

715
00:43:17.951 --> 00:43:21.950
fucking sound
and you're like,
oh yeah,
that's right.

716
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:23.480
I'm going to stand up.
Comedian.

717
00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:27.920
I almost forgot because I've been playing electronic kit for so fucking long.
Um,

718
00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.960
however though I did see a demonstration of the one,
it's the TD cake.
Td.

719
00:43:32.961 --> 00:43:36.290
Something rather 50,
and then the,

720
00:43:36.291 --> 00:43:41.291
with the 22 inch kick and this is how crazy technology is as I just bitched

721
00:43:42.441 --> 00:43:43.640
about it.
They said it was,
you know,

722
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:48.530
it was good enough in 1995 when they didn't even have the mesh heads on the

723
00:43:48.531 --> 00:43:52.880
fucking kits,
it was like hitting a God damn fucking brick.
Um,

724
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:57.290
and you took all the fucking,
the whole rebounded,
the fucking stick,
not rebound,

725
00:43:57.291 --> 00:44:00.020
the whole fucking shock of the stick hit and then you took a right and your

726
00:44:00.021 --> 00:44:01.700
forum.
Um,

727
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.530
anyways this guy hits the fucking ride symbol.

728
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.350
This is how incredible the technology is.

729
00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:13.730
And he just takes the tip of his finger like you would on a real symbol and he

730
00:44:13.731 --> 00:44:14.870
just touched it and it's,

731
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:18.290
the vibration gradually went away just like it would on a real one.

732
00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:21.290
I don't know how the fuck they did that.
He did it all over this symbol too.

733
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.670
Cause it used to be like certain areas you had to hit the symbol and that would

734
00:44:25.671 --> 00:44:29.480
give you the bell sound or a cow bell sound or you could choke it.

735
00:44:29.481 --> 00:44:31.980
But only if you had it there.
Now you can just it all over the symbol.

736
00:44:31.981 --> 00:44:36.000
It's fucking amazing.
But 12 grand.
What the fuck?
Who is that for?

737
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:38.640
I'll tell you is going to buy one of those fucking things.

738
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:43.020
One of those Saudi Arabian fucking uh,
oil kids that,

739
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:48.170
that fucking load up that be 52 bomber and fly all their fucking supercars to

740
00:44:48.331 --> 00:44:52.200
Britain for two months.
That's what you gotta do it fences.

741
00:44:52.201 --> 00:44:56.910
Any oil kids listen to me right now.
You got to buy that $12,000 Roland Kit,

742
00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:57.570
right?

743
00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:01.380
And you've got to have the same fucked up mirrored finish that you got on your

744
00:45:01.381 --> 00:45:06.180
12 Lamborghinis,
you know,
had gold fucking finish.

745
00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.100
That's,
that's so fucking fascinating to me.
You know what I mean?

746
00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:16.780
That level of godliness,
like,
you know,
you want like an egg,
you,

747
00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:20.820
it runs the whole gamut when you go around the fucking world is some people like

748
00:45:20.821 --> 00:45:24.540
when you go to Paris,
it's everything's fucking muted and then Bam,

749
00:45:24.541 --> 00:45:26.970
the scar for the fucking hat,
the bag or the shoes,

750
00:45:26.971 --> 00:45:29.670
but everything else is the background singer,
right?

751
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:33.120
And whatever that big fucking thing is.
That's the fucking diva,

752
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:37.050
the Diana Ross of your fucking outfit,
right?

753
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:41.850
And then you go to other areas,
you go to fucking Italy,

754
00:45:41.851 --> 00:45:44.670
some places in the Middle East,
uh,

755
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.290
Armenians,
right?
They're like,
fuck that.

756
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:53.220
What if we put a group together and everybody,
he got Diana Ross,

757
00:45:53.221 --> 00:45:56.520
you got to rethink all Davis.
They go all fucking diva.

758
00:45:56.580 --> 00:46:00.750
It's a whole other fucking style and the level of confidence.

759
00:46:00.751 --> 00:46:03.690
You have to have to pull that off.
I'll tell you right now,
you know,

760
00:46:03.691 --> 00:46:04.800
can't pull that off.

761
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.760
You have to have a certain level of pigment in your skin to really pull off

762
00:46:08.761 --> 00:46:11.850
flashy shit.
If you notice that shit,
the paste year,

763
00:46:11.851 --> 00:46:16.130
you get to get up to my fucking ancestors.
You know what I mean?
The,
the,

764
00:46:16.131 --> 00:46:18.450
the colors,
it gets real fucking limited.

765
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:22.500
Forget about when you were a fucking ginger.
I mean the amount that,

766
00:46:22.501 --> 00:46:26.460
the fact that I actually have a red wind screen on my fucking,

767
00:46:26.461 --> 00:46:30.330
like if there was a picture of me right now in my pajamas,
what's,

768
00:46:30.331 --> 00:46:31.830
what's left of my red hair?

769
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:35.720
You guys watching me talking into a mic with a red fucking windscreen.

770
00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:39.630
Most of you would never listen to this podcast again.
You know what I mean?

771
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.520
But if I actually had some pigment,

772
00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:47.060
you know I can be sitting here with gold frame glasses with a gold tooth and a

773
00:46:47.311 --> 00:46:50.100
gold microphone and you'd be like,
that guy is the shit.

774
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:58.650
So there you can.
You know what?
Hey,
fair enough.
Fair enough.
You can pull it off.

775
00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.430
I can't.
Alright,
that's the podcast for this week.
Hey,

776
00:47:02.431 --> 00:47:04.020
happy Thanksgiving everybody.

777
00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:08.280
And I'm thankful the each in every one of you that you listen to my dumb ass

778
00:47:08.281 --> 00:47:10.830
every fucking Monday and Thursday.
All right?

779
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:15.360
Now don't get any to into any arguments.
All right?

780
00:47:15.361 --> 00:47:18.060
You don't want to be that fucking person.
All right?

781
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:23.010
Just sit back and enjoy everybody else yelling over politics,
you know,

782
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:26.000
and then you can just be the cut in the background.
What about Joe by

783
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:29.520
Michael Dukakis,

784
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:35.290
<v 1>Grover Cleveland,
whatever the fuck you want to yell at them.
All right,
that's it.</v>

785
00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:37.390
Go fuck yourselves.
Have a nice weekend.

786
00:47:37.391 --> 00:47:40.480
You can't enjoy your God damn Turkey and egg fair enough.

787
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.600
Don't get near the arguments.
All right.
Oh,
maybe a dope and uh,

788
00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:46.360
let me know how fair enough worked out.
How long were you able,

789
00:47:46.361 --> 00:47:47.350
how many drinks in,

790
00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:50.820
we were able to stick with it before you finally lost your Shin.

791
00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:55.660
I want to hear about the arguments.
All right.
Send them in.
Okay.

792
00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:56.530
Fuck you.
I'll see you.

793
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:19.550
<v 5>I hope our</v>

794
00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:27.420
paths cross this time

795
00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:35.283
on

796
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:43.583
thousand

797
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:52.900
the,

798
00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:01.050
you can see what I can,
when I

799
00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:07.240
throw my phase two,
the phase.

800
00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.080
So the next minute ago,
the county

801
00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:18.790
<v 1>Thanksgiving Day special Billy Kraka,
there's a new one,
Betty Crocker.</v>

802
00:49:18.791 --> 00:49:23.230
Betty Crocker.
I liked it and I like to cook.
That's a good one.

803
00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:28.270
Love your intensity when it comes to bringing something to the table on

804
00:49:28.271 --> 00:49:31.900
Thanksgiving.
Absolutely.
No Pun intended.
It's,

805
00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:33.730
it's really a no brainer.

806
00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:38.260
Get good at making something and get to a point where your automatic,
oh,

807
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:41.170
he's talking about,
yeah,
like I was talking about a few weeks ago.

808
00:49:41.171 --> 00:49:42.490
When thanksgiving comes around,

809
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:47.020
you got to have that dish that you just fucking can make and you throw down and

810
00:49:47.021 --> 00:49:49.510
you take it to another level.
All right?

811
00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:51.970
Everybody else should be doing the same thing.
And then the end,

812
00:49:51.971 --> 00:49:55.900
that's the Thanksgiving meal.
Um,
so this guy goes,
yeah,

813
00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:59.080
you should get a dish downs where your automatic,
how hard can it be?

814
00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:03.550
A you'll,
you'll never been x.
You'll never been.

815
00:50:03.551 --> 00:50:07.480
You've never been expected to step out of your skillset.
If you're baking breads,

816
00:50:07.481 --> 00:50:11.800
no one will ever expect you to bring the cranberry sauce.
Uh,

817
00:50:11.801 --> 00:50:14.860
what should go to this year?
What's Nias specialty?

818
00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:21.160
What's my Goto this year?
How about the whole fucking meal?
Dude,

819
00:50:21.161 --> 00:50:24.520
I'll tell you right now.
You guys stick.
I'm a fuck at one trick pony.

820
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:28.160
I can make you a Turkey dinner.
Was stuffing

821
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:31.220
<v 3>mashed potatoes.
My gravy game is getting better.</v>

822
00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:34.970
I've got to work on my gravy game and I know that's crucial.
All right?

823
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:39.470
But my fucking ah,
my mashed potatoes,

824
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:44.680
not a fucking lumping them all right enough body to make you slide off the

825
00:50:45.021 --> 00:50:49.060
chair.
Um,
as they say in New Orleans,
that's Ben woolens accent.

826
00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:53.960
I admitted my stuffing.
Go Fuck Yourself.
All right,
dude,

827
00:50:53.961 --> 00:50:58.040
you don't understand the recipes that I have access to all of my recipes start

828
00:50:58.041 --> 00:51:02.270
with melt a stick of butter and a third,
a cup of Crisco in a pan.

829
00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:11.090
Okay.
So you know it's delicious.
Um,
yeah,

830
00:51:11.091 --> 00:51:11.924
my stuffing.

831
00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:14.653
<v 6>MMM.</v>

832
00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:19.120
<v 3>I don't my mashed potatoes or the shit,
but knee is African American,</v>

833
00:51:19.121 --> 00:51:22.150
so she likes more sweet potato.
So I don't,
I don't think they,
uh,

834
00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:26.800
that side respects mashed potatoes the way they should.
Okay.

835
00:51:26.801 --> 00:51:31.180
I feel like my potato,
my,
my,
my United colors of Benetton,

836
00:51:31.181 --> 00:51:35.290
whatever the fuck it is.
Respect for,
for sweet potatoes and mashed potatoes.

837
00:51:35.291 --> 00:51:38.080
I think I'm a little more mature

838
00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:43.350
than the lovely Nia.
Um,
what's Nia specialty?
Uh,

839
00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:47.560
Nias she's just great at everything.
She's one of those people that I,

840
00:51:47.590 --> 00:51:50.550
I'll be out in the kitchen like what the fuck

841
00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.090
she be like,
what is nothing to eat?

842
00:51:54.091 --> 00:51:56.020
And she comes out there and next thing he knows he's got a couple of things on

843
00:51:56.021 --> 00:52:00.250
her arms and I dunno,
I'm eating spaghetti or I don't know what the fuck.

844
00:52:00.251 --> 00:52:05.020
I mean she somehow just throws it all together or make some ridiculous omelet.

845
00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.313
<v 6>MMM.</v>

846
00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.470
<v 3>She's actually a true cook.
I'm a little more robotic.</v>

847
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:11.563
<v 6>MMM.</v>

848
00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.240
<v 3>I think I'm going to become a,</v>

849
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:17.770
a great cook or a better cook the way I became a better comedian where at first

850
00:52:17.771 --> 00:52:21.010
I was a joke writer and I was trapped in my act and then I learned how to Improv

851
00:52:21.011 --> 00:52:24.220
and she's Kinda just watching her.
She kind of,
as she cooks,

852
00:52:24.221 --> 00:52:26.920
she's tasting it and doing all that type of stuff where I just,

853
00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:32.140
they said to leave it in 15 minutes,
it's been 15 minutes and I take it out.
Um,

854
00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.160
<v 6>yeah.</v>

855

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:38.610
<v 3>I kind of got the whole thing do from start to finish.
My,
uh,</v>

858
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:42.560
my appetizer game is terrible.
In fact,

859
00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:47.120
I don't even know if I know how to make one.
I have no idea.
But dude,

860
00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.880
I can make a pie from fucking scratch.
Okay.

861
00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:54.280
I can look at you and tell you what all your fucking problems are as I'm making

862
00:52:54.281 --> 00:52:58.120
the pie crust and not even look down once I can just feel the texture.

863
00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.760
You know what I'm saying?
That's how many fucking Pi's I've made.

864
00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:02.933
<v 6>All right.</v>

865
00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:06.330
<v 3>And I'll take debt pie someday and I'll bring it to your fucking house.</v>

866
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:10.320
All right.
And I'll take a whole hunk of it just in,
I'll just shove it,

867
00:53:10.321 --> 00:53:12.990
write down your throat and these nothing that you're going to be able to say

868
00:53:12.991 --> 00:53:15.930
other than thank you for that experience.
All right.

869
00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:18.990
As of shaking up the can of whipped cream to give you a facial

870
00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:24.550
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

871
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:29.463
oh,

872
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:43.070
<v 7>this is the Monday morning.</v>

873
00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:48.070
My voice when I said that

874
00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.690
right by voice went up.
If you have to say I am excited.

875
00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:59.270
Why am I excited?
Um,
I don't know.
I don't know why.

876
00:53:59.271 --> 00:54:03.450
Maybe because it's Thanksgiving week and it's a week.
Could give back,

877
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:05.210
you know,

878
00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:10.540
once a year everybody has to sit down and just really think about why they're so

879
00:54:12.111 --> 00:54:17.030
lucky.
I just shut the fuck up and give me some God damn Turkey.
Okay.

880
00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:19.210
Dead part of the fucking Thanksgiving world.
Since then,

881
00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:22.850
we've got to give me a speech like I like,
I don't appreciate what I got,

882
00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:28.300
you know,
just shut up.
Um,
yeah.
So it's thanksgiving,

883
00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:32.690
it's Thanksgiving Week and day to day,
week to give thanks.
I am thankful.

884
00:54:32.691 --> 00:54:34.480
I'm just fucking around and um,

885
00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:40.180
I'm making a Turkey and a with some stuffing and I had the most insane recipe

886
00:54:40.911 --> 00:54:44.150
for stuffing that none of you will be getting during this podcast because it's a

887
00:54:44.151 --> 00:54:46.790
secret family recipe.
Okay.

888
00:54:46.791 --> 00:54:51.791
So you have to be part of my family or be banging me and catch me at a moment of

889
00:54:53.931 --> 00:54:54.764
weakness.

890
00:54:56.830 --> 00:54:59.330
We have to be a great thing of a girl did that you just lay on your back.

891
00:54:59.331 --> 00:55:03.080
She's riding you and then somehow she,
she's so,
she's so good in bed.

892
00:55:03.081 --> 00:55:06.580
She gets you to give away a secret family recipe.
You're like

893
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:16.370
27 pieces of white bread.
What holds it together?

894
00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:19.280
It's the egg.
Um,
all right.

895
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:23.620
I'm literally sitting in my fucking car and my,

896
00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:27.320
my Toyota Prius and a in a parking lot outside.
Um,
my,

897
00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:29.010
my little offices that I have out here,

898
00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:33.530
my little production offices is like inch my way along in my little unerring

899
00:55:33.531 --> 00:55:37.330
pilot I'm getting ready to shoot a non [inaudible] pilot,

900
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:41.510
which basically means you shoot it and then they look at it and they go either

901
00:55:41.511 --> 00:55:46.070
we like it and then we want to reshoot it or they go,
yeah,

902
00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:49.070
that's why a wasn't area cause that's sucks.

903
00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:54.170
So um,
yeah that's what I got going on in my fucking life.

904
00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:57.380
This creepy guy,
this guy,

905
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.230
this guy just pulled up next to me and I'm really worried that he's going to

906
00:56:00.231 --> 00:56:01.064
fucking,

907
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:05.240
I put up my windows that he's going to fucking bump his door and then my car,

908
00:56:05.241 --> 00:56:07.730
which he didn't and he's kind of,
Oh I wouldn't say he's really fat.

909
00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:11.930
Definitely has a foreman grill.
Yeah.
That's my fucking love handle.

910
00:56:11.931 --> 00:56:16.550
Just hit my side view mirror.
All right.

911
00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.680
Oh you know a lot of people last week broke my balls

912
00:56:20.590 --> 00:56:22.850
and an email kind of way going in like,
you know,

913
00:56:22.851 --> 00:56:26.380
cause thought that guy rear ended me and then go,
what did you get out?
Check.

914
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:30.610
You know,
what are you the most trusting guy in la?
You don't fuck,

915
00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:35.110
I got a bunch of shit like that and it's,
and it's basically,

916
00:56:35.111 --> 00:56:39.670
cause I figured out what it was told you.
My fucking car happened today.

917
00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:43.980
It was all on electric and then the car kicks over and for some reason it,

918
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.050
it gives you a little push.
It,
it makes the car lurched forward.

919
00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:50.510
I really not selling hybrids on these please fucking podcast because I'm making

920
00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:54.040
him sound like they suck.
They're actually there raw the damn book cars.

921
00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:56.170
But anyways,
um,

922
00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:59.960
it has tweak affects given I like the fuck I'm talking about it.

923
00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:03.340
My fingers smell like an orange because I just ate one.
Um,

924
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:06.190
yes,
it's the Monday morning podcast.

925
00:57:06.191 --> 00:57:10.000
I do one of these once a week every Monday to give people something to laugh

926
00:57:10.001 --> 00:57:14.440
about as they sit in their cubicles as a drive or fucking run on a treadmill.

927
00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.620

Do you have any questions?
I don't care how ridiculous it is.

930
00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:29.770
I will answer the question like this.
Here's a,
here's a,
here's a,

931
00:57:29.771 --> 00:57:34.510
here's a nice question.
A question number one.
Um,
hey bill,

932
00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:37.030
I've been a huge fan of yours since you barely,

933
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:40.810
since you were barely beaten by Ruben,
started on American idol.

934
00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:46.720
Have you ever thought about giving it another shot?
Um,
you know what?

935
00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:51.190
My time on American idol,
I don't regret any of it.
I had,
I had,

936
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:53.650
I had a great time.
You know,

937
00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:58.680
some of the numbers that they had is perform like Muskrat love and tie a yellow

938
00:57:59.051 --> 00:58:03.430
ribbon that I,
you know,
I wouldn't trade that for the world,
but you know,

939
00:58:03.431 --> 00:58:06.760
I've moved on and I feel so much,
you know,

940
00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:11.190
I got my sexuality is out there.
If it did I dream that is,

941
00:58:11.191 --> 00:58:13.230
it wasn't on the cover of people magazine fucker standing.

942
00:58:13.231 --> 00:58:16.300
It looked like clay Aiken is what he's basically saying.

943
00:58:16.301 --> 00:58:19.750
And the sad thing is that's not the first time I've heard it.
Okay.

944
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:23.640
Um,
you know what you did,
you just expose yourself.

945
00:58:23.641 --> 00:58:26.050
We're actually watching that fucking show.
What do you think about that?
Huh?

946
00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:29.980
I don't need this shit.
You know,
people supposed to ask me questions.

947
00:58:29.981 --> 00:58:32.290
He not supposed to make me feel bad about myself.
Like,
Hey,

948
00:58:32.291 --> 00:58:34.840
you look like the gay guy who lost.
We said,

949
00:58:34.841 --> 00:58:38.470
could have been it looked like a gay guy.
One,
you know,

950
00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:42.890
<v 8>oh,
we see something wrong with me and Jay,
you're sucking Dick.</v>

951
00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:46.670
<v 7>No,
I'm kidding.
Um,
but they do that.
They definitely do that.</v>

952
00:58:46.850 --> 00:58:50.300
You know what I learned from some of my gay friends that a lot of them actually

953
00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:54.320
don't engage in anal.
They just like,
now it hurts.
I'm like,

954
00:58:54.321 --> 00:58:57.080
so what do you do when evidently they just sort of sit around blowing each
other?

955
00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:04.280
Yeah.
So
let's get to question number two.
Let me see.

956
00:59:04.281 --> 00:59:07.550
Maybe this one will be a little nicer bill,
in my opinion,

957
00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:11.960
all negative bitter people all,
wait a minute,
I'm such a moron.

958
00:59:11.961 --> 00:59:13.760
I came to read here.
Fill in my opinion,

959
00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:16.550
all negative bitter people think everybody,

960
00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:20.120
everybody are always out to fuck them.

961
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:24.590
Maybe why you have such a handle on conspiracy theory.
Am I wrong?

962
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:28.790
It's another guy kind of shitting on me.
You know,
for Thanksgiving week,
you know,

963
00:59:28.791 --> 00:59:31.460
you'd think there'd be some more thankful fucking questions.

964
00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:37.670
How do you ask a thankful question?
I just can't ha,

965
00:59:37.671 --> 00:59:42.200
how did you become such a great person is got a thankful question.
First of all,

966
00:59:42.201 --> 00:59:43.250
if you're going to trash me,

967
00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:46.460
can you try to actually work out the grammar so you don't look like a moron?

968
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:47.751
In my opinion?

969
00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:52.070
All negative bitter people think everybody are always out to get to fuck them.

970
00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:54.170
All right.
In my opinion,

971
00:59:54.171 --> 00:59:58.740
people who don't use capitals or punctuation or fucking morons.
Um,

972
00:59:58.950 --> 01:00:01.580
all right,
let me reread this so it actually makes sense.
Okay.

973
01:00:01.581 --> 01:00:03.740
And this guy's opinion,
of course you have to let me know.

974
01:00:03.741 --> 01:00:07.040
This is opinion in case I thought he had a staff of writers who write his

975
01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:11.780
fucking emails.
Okay?
All negative bitter people think about,

976
01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:16.220
think everybody is what does this all negative,
bitter people think.

977
01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:21.470
Everybody
know he gives you,

978
01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:25.760
you got this thing so fucked up.
I can't even read it right here.
Oh,
negative,

979
01:00:25.761 --> 01:00:28.010
bitter people think everybody.

980
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:33.620
Everybody's out to get them out to fuck them.
How about that?

981
01:00:33.621 --> 01:00:34.454
Does that make sense?

982
01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:39.350
Maybe that's why you have such a handle on conspiracy theory.
Am I wrong?
Ah,
yes.

983
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:43.090
Yes you are wrong.
Um,
I'm not a bitter person.
I'm definitely a,

984
01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:47.750
I definitely negative,
but I don't think people are up to fuck me.

985
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:52.580
Like I don't walk into a bakery and go,
can I get a cupcake?

986
01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:56.060
And when they forget to give me a Napkin,
I don't go.
You see,

987
01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.660
I knew it man.
Um,

988
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:02.990
and I think conspiracy theory gets a bad rep.

989
01:01:02.991 --> 01:01:07.991
Conspiracy theory gets trashed constantly by people who never look into

990
01:01:08.691 --> 01:01:11.450
conspiracy theory.
You know what I mean?

991
01:01:11.451 --> 01:01:14.230
All they do is they see one guy on the news who goes,

992
01:01:14.231 --> 01:01:17.560
is a guy living in the moon and they're like,
that's right there.

993
01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:21.680
That's conspiracy theory.
That's what they,
that's what they all say.

994
01:01:21.681 --> 01:01:26.210
Cause they're,
they all have conspiracy theories like that.
You know,

995
01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:31.720
I don't,
I mean,
I guess,
I dunno.
I Dunno what to do for you.

996
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:35.240
You'd have to look at some of the conspiracies that I'm into and then make your

997
01:01:35.241 --> 01:01:39.680
judgment from there if you think,
I don't know,
I can't judge myself.
But I mean,

998
01:01:39.681 --> 01:01:41.360
if you read about the Federal Reserve,

999
01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:45.620
if you have a sit down and do the math on your mortgage and realize that the

1000
01:01:45.621 --> 01:01:49.160
bank turns you into an indentured servant for fucking 30 years,

1001
01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:54.080
you know,
do you ever think about that shit?
Do the math on your mortgage?

1002
01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:59.120
I have a $350,000 fucking loan.
If I take 30 years to pay it back,
I paid,

1003
01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:04.270
I give them $766,000 plus the 80 grand I put down on it.

1004
01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:07.310
So now what are we up to?

1005
01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:11.580
$840,000 so at the end of my mortgage,

1006
01:02:11.581 --> 01:02:13.790
I'm going to be one of those morons go,
yeah,
no,

1007
01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:15.650
they fucking place doubled in value.

1008
01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:18.860
I paid three 50 now you didn't stupid.

1009
01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:24.120
You paid eight 50 you basically made about 800 bucks in 30 years and now you're

1010
01:02:24.121 --> 01:02:27.570
68 what are you going to do?
Take up water skiing?
It's over.

1011
01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:30.360
It's fucking over.
You know?

1012
01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:33.300
And at that point they've devalued the dollar because they keep printing it with

1013
01:02:33.301 --> 01:02:37.650
no gold behind it,
which causes inflation.
Now you can't afford the property tax,

1014
01:02:37.651 --> 01:02:41.280
so you have to sell it and you move out and they get another 35 year old to move

1015
01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:44.370
in.
Ben Dover,
drop his pants and it gets fucked in the ass.

1016
01:02:44.371 --> 01:02:48.390
But 30 years and uh,
yes,
I think that that is a,

1017
01:02:48.391 --> 01:02:51.990
I think that that's bullshit,
you know?

1018
01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:55.120
Does that mean I'm fucking nuts?
I probably coming off is nuts.
I Dunno.

1019
01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:56.291
I'm just saying,

1020
01:02:56.291 --> 01:03:01.291
I think my by conspiracy theories are thought out like I feel whatever they're

1021
01:03:01.541 --> 01:03:05.170
doing to dogs,
they're going to be doing to us in 10 years.
All right.

1022
01:03:05.171 --> 01:03:06.310
And I don't know if you've looked around,

1023
01:03:06.311 --> 01:03:10.630
but dogs are basically neutered with microchips in shelters waiting to be

1024
01:03:10.631 --> 01:03:13.890
rescued.
That's what a fucking dog is.
Now,
when you were kids,

1025
01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:18.010
remember the freedom dogs used to have,
I mean,

1026
01:03:18.011 --> 01:03:23.011
seeing two dogs fucking in public was a part of people's childhood and now you

1027
01:03:23.261 --> 01:03:27.970
know,
they can't,
they can't even fuck anymore because they've been neutered.

1028
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:31.970
And that's what I think they got to do with us.
Michael chips,

1029
01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.240
you're gonna deal with the population they're going to get.

1030
01:03:34.241 --> 01:03:38.970
They're going to start fixing people
I was on right wing radio.

1031
01:03:38.971 --> 01:03:42.440
I'd be like,
I'm,
that's exactly what they need.
Um,

1032
01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:45.690
that made no sense and I apologize.
All right.
Question number two,
Bill.
Uh,

1033
01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:49.860
are you worried about becoming too famous?
Well,
if 40 years of age,

1034
01:03:49.861 --> 01:03:53.970
I'm worried about not becoming famous because I've invested a lot of time into

1035
01:03:53.971 --> 01:03:58.740
this.
I actually have a cool level of notoriety.
Um,
I know what you mean.

1036
01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:03.600
I think those people who are two famous,
I think they seek it out.

1037
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:08.190
I really don't think the Paparazzi is like the CIA and they have the ability to

1038
01:04:08.191 --> 01:04:11.160
figure out when you're going to go to Starbucks without your panties on.

1039
01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:15.360
I think there's,
there's a little fucking surf and turf action going on there.

1040
01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:19.670
You know,
there's a little bit of the artists playing up,
you know,

1041
01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:24.230
don't they call their publicist?
You know what I mean?
I mean,
I,

1042
01:04:24.231 --> 01:04:29.100
I couldn't fucking,
I mean,
I don't know.
It's just,

1043
01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:31.020
there's just too many famous fucking people.

1044
01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:34.260
There's too many places where you can go.
Like,

1045
01:04:34.261 --> 01:04:37.350
how do they know you're coming from getting off the airplane?
At the airport.

1046
01:04:37.351 --> 01:04:39.990
You've ever seen that?
What happens?
This,

1047
01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:44.880
the guy at the sky cap just happened to know somebody in the Paparazzi.

1048
01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:48.150
There's somebody nodding right now as if they know and as if they've done it.

1049
01:04:48.151 --> 01:04:51.030
Maybe.
Maybe that happens.
Maybe that happens a little bit,

1050
01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.253
but you know what I mean?

1051
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:57.540
All I know is I look at a guy like Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez and five years

1052
01:04:57.541 --> 01:05:02.010
ago when they were dating each other,
j Lo,
what do they call it?
Ben Flow.

1053
01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.790
Uh,
j lack,
what the fuck did they cut?
Benefit.
Benefit,
right?

1054
01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:12.410
Remember that you could not get away from it.
And they were everywhere.

1055
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:13.490
And I was like,

1056
01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:18.490
either they have to kill themselves or I do because this can't continue to

1057
01:05:18.491 --> 01:05:19.324
happen.
Right?

1058
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:24.010
And then they broke up with each other and then all of a sudden nobody gives a

1059
01:05:24.011 --> 01:05:26.620
shit about them anymore.
It's like,

1060
01:05:26.621 --> 01:05:30.970
I get when to famous people date that Paparazzi swarm all over you.

1061
01:05:30.971 --> 01:05:34.450
But both of them broke up and then married other famous people.

1062
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:40.710
He married a Jennifer Garner and she married a that,

1063
01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:46.160
that creepy looking guy.
Who's it?
Julio Iglesias,

1064
01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:50.840
she married.
It's like he looks like the Lion Tamer.

1065
01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:55.170
It's not the blonde haired one.
The uh,
who's,
oh,
the lion tamer.

1066
01:05:55.171 --> 01:05:59.590
Siskel and Ebert.
Who else?
Guys?

1067
01:05:59.591 --> 01:06:03.860
He looks like they want to get grabbed by the throat.
Yeah,

1068
01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:07.150
Chris Catan looking one.
Chris Catan,
you know,

1069
01:06:07.151 --> 01:06:11.080
if they ever do the fucking,
uh,
Siegfried and Roy story,

1070
01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:14.850
Chris Catana has to play Roy and that's also,
that's a media partner.

1071
01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:19.750
Maybe the blond guy is the media part because he gets to cry at his hospital
bed.

1072
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:24.100
Like Fonz are rally when Richie Cunningham wiped out on his motorcycle.

1073
01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:26.450
Remember that?
Cause if you,

1074
01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:31.370
I do these fucking leather jacket was going in and out because Henry Micro who's

1075
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:35.650
crying.
Um,
okay.
Let me get back to the question.

1076
01:06:35.651 --> 01:06:37.870
Are you worried about becoming too famous?
Yeah,
I,
yeah,

1077
01:06:37.871 --> 01:06:40.420
there's a certain level you don't want to go beyond,
you know what I mean?

1078
01:06:41.010 --> 01:06:43.840
Like those guys,
like whenever I see like celebrity houses,
they're like,

1079
01:06:43.841 --> 01:06:48.700
and he has his own tennis culottes his own fucking movie theater.

1080
01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:51.310
And people were like,
oh my God,
that's awesome.

1081
01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:55.150
And it's like they never really think that he has his own tennis court and his

1082
01:06:55.151 --> 01:06:59.410
own movie theater because he kind of has to because he can't go.
He can't,

1083
01:06:59.411 --> 01:07:02.680
he can't go anywhere.
So yeah,
I wouldn't want to get to that level of fan.

1084
01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:08.140
I would like Steve Buscemi fame time you saw him and ogs magazine,

1085
01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:12.550
US magazine.
I was just thinking,

1086
01:07:12.551 --> 01:07:14.080
I all those horrors always wear uggs.

1087
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:19.470
US magazine was the last time you saw him in US magazine is going to get some

1088
01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:23.590
coffee.
No one gives a shit what he's doing.
I think you're really control it.

1089
01:07:23.591 --> 01:07:24.970
I think your publicist,
you know,

1090
01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:30.360
I think as long as you're not brought up on a murder charge or ah,
you know,

1091
01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:33.490
you're not drinking and drugging and just making a spectacle of yourself.

1092
01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:36.091
Yeah.
I don't,

1093
01:07:36.091 --> 01:07:41.010
they think of all the famous fucking people out there who just kind of just live

1094
01:07:41.011 --> 01:07:46.010
their life.
You know what I mean?
I never seen,
you know,

1095
01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:50.470
Anthony Hopkins nuts sack as he stepped out of Alexis.
You know what I mean?

1096
01:07:50.471 --> 01:07:53.640
You just,
the guy wears underwear and he's not doing drugs.

1097
01:07:53.641 --> 01:07:57.300
I mean that's basically it.
That's how you stay out of the papers.
Just don't do.

1098
01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:02.120
Interesting.
Thanks.
Well,
I guess that would suck up,

1099
01:08:02.121 --> 01:08:06.040
but you're famous so you get an a level pussy.
That's all a trade off.
All right.

1100
01:08:06.090 --> 01:08:08.870
Um,
let's get over to overrated,
underrated.

1101
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:11.720
And for those of you who are new to my podcast,

1102
01:08:11.721 --> 01:08:15.020
because I just keep getting new listeners every week we do this one part of

1103
01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:18.920
where people send me in their list of shit that they think is overhead,
overhead,

1104
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:22.880
overrated and shit that is underrated and their reasons why.

1105
01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:23.960
And I actually,

1106
01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:28.310
I'm contributing this week rather than letting my listeners do all the work.

1107
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:32.570
Um,
I would say,
uh,
overrated,

1108
01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.070
the l shaped couch.

1109
01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:39.050
I'm actually right now trying to buy some furniture and uh,

1110
01:08:39.051 --> 01:08:42.260
I've had an l shaped couch before and I didn't realize they suck.

1111
01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:47.270
Basically they suck because there's no place to put the TV.

1112
01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:51.740
When you have people on an l shaped couch because you got people,

1113
01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.140
they're like,
eh,
they're not perpendicular,

1114
01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.180
perpendicular to the sight lines are perpendicular.

1115
01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:57.290
So why the fuck do you put it?

1116
01:08:57.430 --> 01:09:00.560
Somebody has got to turn their neck and the next going to end up hurting.

1117
01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:05.230
And not to mention it's a very,
you know,
as people start drinking,
you know,

1118
01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:08.420
people sightlines start crossing and that's why that's how guys get in a fight.

1119
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:12.040
You know,
you stare in another guy too long,
you think somebody is looking at you,

1120
01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:15.330
at least that's what the fuck and Jack Daniels is telling you,
you know.

1121
01:09:15.331 --> 01:09:19.020
And next thing you know,
you fucking crash land on the,

1122
01:09:19.021 --> 01:09:22.100
on your Ikea coffee table.
It's,
you know where it is.

1123
01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:23.800
The guy you end up getting to a fight with.

1124
01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:26.350
It's the guy that your friend brings that you don't even fucking know one.

1125
01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:28.640
And he and he could sense,
cause he doesn't know anybody,

1126
01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:33.520
he sits as far away from everybody as possible and thinking that that's the uh,

1127
01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:35.030
the submissive thing to do.

1128
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:38.750
But it's actually an Alpha male move because now he's looking across everybody's

1129
01:09:38.751 --> 01:09:42.260
lines sightlines who have faced forward.
So discovery channel thing.

1130
01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:47.450
So fuck l shaped couches,
what you want as a couch and then you want,

1131
01:09:47.451 --> 01:09:51.740
you want another one of those other couches,
the king with the uh,

1132
01:09:51.741 --> 01:09:54.170
with the thing that you put your big square thing that you put your feet on.

1133
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:57.460
That's what the fuck you want.
You don't want it.
You don't want a lazy boy.

1134
01:09:57.461 --> 01:10:01.940
You the lazy boys are also overrated.
They're not comfortable.
They're not,

1135
01:10:01.941 --> 01:10:02.774
they suck.

1136
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:06.950
And all those airplanes now that have lazy boy FirstClass each and like,
Oh wow,

1137
01:10:06.951 --> 01:10:10.100
yeah,
that would be great.
He could sleep the whole flight just,
you know,

1138
01:10:10.101 --> 01:10:13.730
one night go downstairs to your recliner and spend fucking eight hours in that

1139
01:10:13.731 --> 01:10:18.050
thing and let me know how comfortable then it's
alright.
Underrated,

1140
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:21.260
underrated.
You know what,
I actually,

1141
01:10:21.261 --> 01:10:24.500
when I've got some fast food for a bunch of people the other night and somebody

1142
01:10:24.501 --> 01:10:28.260
actually took the time,
you know,
on the fast flu foods,
so to live,

1143
01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:32.930
they actually push down the tab to let me know which one was cola,

1144
01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.200
which one was diet and who,
you know,
who had other,

1145
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:41.630
and for some reason it's such a nice thing for someone to do and nobody does it.

1146
01:10:41.631 --> 01:10:43.010
So fast.

1147
01:10:43.011 --> 01:10:48.011
Food technicians who actually take the time to push that fucking thing down is,

1148
01:10:48.291 --> 01:10:52.610
uh,
is really underrated and I think they deserve a race.
Um,
all right,

1149
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:55.040
those are mine for fuck for the weaker.
Right.

1150
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:59.690
And here's some more peoples overrated friends.
The TV show

1151
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:05.740
is that overrated?
I've never really,
okay.

1152
01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:07.790
A friends is overrated,
right?

1153
01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:11.300
I hated this show when it was on and I can't believe that it's considered good

1154
01:11:11.301 --> 01:11:14.610
enough to be syndicated nationally and aired every day.

1155
01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:18.480
I think this show mostly appeal to women as,
I don't know,

1156
01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:23.190
a single guy that was waiting on the edge of their couches for the new episode.

1157
01:11:23.191 --> 01:11:28.050
Yeah.
That's one of those chicks shows.
There's no reason.
And um,

1158
01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:33.000
I'm sure David Schwimmer isn't really like that in real life,
but,
uh,

1159
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:38.220
I just knew every time they would do a montage of,
uh,

1160
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:41.760
of the friends,
you know,
live their little episodes.

1161
01:11:41.761 --> 01:11:45.300
He always had to be getting really excited and jumping up and down like a chick

1162
01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:47.850
doing like a false settle,
you know,

1163
01:11:47.851 --> 01:11:51.330
lean on when chicks like something's going to be exciting and they jump up and

1164
01:11:51.331 --> 01:11:54.150
down and clap their hands.
I'm,
or maybe at least TV chicks,

1165
01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:55.200
he would always be doing that.

1166
01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:56.323
<v 9>Ooh.</v>

1167
01:11:57.830 --> 01:12:01.220
<v 7>And it just get,
just made as a guy if you just wanted to fucking,</v>

1168
01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:05.180
he just want to,
you know,
you just want something bad to happen to them.

1169
01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.220
That's what I was always waiting for.

1170
01:12:07.221 --> 01:12:09.740
I just want to see the episode where Ross got the shit kicked out of him.

1171
01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:11.733
You know,

1172
01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:16.610
I remember a long time go on and watch the Brady Bunch and uh,
you know,

1173
01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.730
what's his face?
Bobby did something to,

1174
01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:24.850
to Greg and somehow Greg had orange hair and he actually looked like he was mad

1175
01:12:24.891 --> 01:12:27.650
enough that he was going to beat the shit out of Bobby.

1176
01:12:27.651 --> 01:12:32.630
And Bobby was hiding behind Florence Henderson and uh,
you know,

1177
01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:37.190
I remember being a little kid really wanting to see Bobby get the shit kicked

1178
01:12:37.191 --> 01:12:38.390
out of him.
Like I wanted it.

1179
01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.200
I really wanted to see it happen and it's probably why,
you know,

1180
01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:47.490
30 years later I'm watching the UFC.
I mean that's the storyline that I want.

1181
01:12:47.491 --> 01:12:47.770
You don't have to,

1182
01:12:47.770 --> 01:12:50.990
I just thought about that was Greg was actually sort of bang in Florence

1183
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:55.340
Henderson right down.
I wonder if Bobby knew Mike Lucan land.

1184
01:12:56.180 --> 01:13:00.180
I guess.
Evidently he lives in Utah.
I don't even know why.
I fucking know that.
Um,

1185
01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:05.240
alright.
Underrated.
Somebody said Radiohead attends.
Some of you guys,

1186
01:13:05.241 --> 01:13:07.880
I don't know about these suggests.
Is Radiohead really underrated?

1187
01:13:07.881 --> 01:13:10.850
Critically acclaimed.
Everybody like talking about awesome.
There are,

1188
01:13:10.851 --> 01:13:12.650
this band has been around for a very long time.

1189
01:13:12.651 --> 01:13:17.270
Is yet to put out an album that would be below three stars on your four star

1190
01:13:17.271 --> 01:13:18.170
scale system.

1191
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:21.950
Whenever I try to talk to people about them or even to get a group of people to

1192
01:13:21.951 --> 01:13:25.160
go see them play live.
Nobody is interested at all.

1193
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:29.090
And No,
I don't talk about Radiohead all the time.

1194
01:13:29.091 --> 01:13:32.120
The media barely ever talks about the band and when they do,

1195
01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:35.150
they only talk about OK computer,
the band's third album.

1196
01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:39.230
This band deserves a lot more attention and praise from people as they are one

1197
01:13:39.231 --> 01:13:44.030
of the best bands ever form.
Um,
I got it.
Okay.

1198
01:13:44.031 --> 01:13:47.780
And I know what you saying.
Well this is what you got to look at.

1199
01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:51.260
You know,
no matter how good have band is,

1200
01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:56.290
it's never going to get the attention of some girl with no panties on or with

1201
01:13:56.721 --> 01:14:01.040
their titties hanging out.
I mean,
I dunno,

1202
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:04.280
I'm probably speaking out of turn here because I don't have a vagina,

1203
01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:09.850
but it really just seems like women realize this and they just showing their

1204
01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:17.050
fucking ass and things
like,

1205
01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:20.290
even like girls who will like respectable.
It's like,
no,
I'm not doing this.

1206
01:14:20.291 --> 01:14:22.180
I'm not doing booty videos and blah blah blah blah.

1207
01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.950
And then they finally get on like a sitcom or something and the first Red Day
do,

1208
01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:30.190
do you know what I'm saying?
They got the little coochie cutters,

1209
01:14:30.191 --> 01:14:34.780
the fucking who has hanging out,
you know,
they got two fingers,

1210
01:14:34.781 --> 01:14:38.590
the index and middle finger over both nipples with their mouth half open.
Like,

1211
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:42.640
oh there's somebody want their cock sock.
They always do like that,

1212
01:14:42.641 --> 01:14:45.130
that photo shoot,
you know,

1213
01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.970
laying down completely naked and everything.

1214
01:14:48.971 --> 01:14:51.670
Somehow you don't quite see their ass crack and there's no nipple,

1215
01:14:51.671 --> 01:14:52.391
but you basically,

1216
01:14:52.391 --> 01:14:57.391
you basically see their entire body except for the ass crack and some nipples.

1217
01:14:57.970 --> 01:15:02.560
Other than that,
you've seen every piece of flesh that's on them.
And uh,

1218
01:15:02.730 --> 01:15:06.310
you know,
they always do that.
I Dunno.

1219
01:15:07.150 --> 01:15:09.940
That's what I don't understand.
Women always bitching about that type of shit.

1220
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:14.240
Talking about,
Oh,
you're treating this like sex objects.
It's like fuck you every,

1221
01:15:14.290 --> 01:15:15.580
every time your career is in trouble.

1222
01:15:15.581 --> 01:15:20.290
You put on a pair of fuck me pumps and you bend over a couch and then they go

1223
01:15:20.291 --> 01:15:22.720
the new sizzling pictures of fucking

1224
01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.520
who's one of these girls I saw do well,
get back to friends,
Jennifer Aniston and,

1225
01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:30.670
but she did that.
And unrolling stone,
you know,

1226
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:33.280
one of the highest selling things ever.

1227
01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:37.270
I think women should embrace being treated as sex objects.

1228
01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:41.580
You know what,
what do,
what do you want to be?
We're not,

1229
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:44.260
what are you want to be known for being like a meteorologist.

1230
01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:49.690
I know sometimes I should just stop talking cause that just keep going and then

1231
01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:54.270
just get dumber and dumber.
I think that even answer that question.
All right.
Uh,

1232
01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:59.140
we got,
we got a couple of other here,
couple others here.

1233
01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:03.100
This guy said last week you mentioned voting for Ron Paul because of the Federal

1234
01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:07.540
Reserve.
Um,
John,
it's the wrong one.

1235
01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:10.510
Okay.
Okay.
Bill,
here's a question.

1236
01:16:10.511 --> 01:16:13.960
Do you have a sketch comedy show in the works also,

1237
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:18.430
now that Randy coture is out and then went on to say his name.

1238
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:23.830
What are your thoughts on Brock Lesnar versus Fidor door and Mac?

1239
01:16:23.831 --> 01:16:28.210
I like I Linko.
Who Do you think will win?
Uh,
I have no fucking idea.

1240
01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:31.690
I gotta be honest with you.
I have no idea.

1241
01:16:31.691 --> 01:16:34.960
I just know Brock Lesnar was one of the biggest human beings I've ever seen.

1242
01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:39.130
His one of his pecs,
you know,
it's,
it's

1243
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:41.060
like this,

1244
01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:45.700
the Pec muscle is the thickness of my entire torso and the size,

1245
01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:49.840
like from my neck down to my waist.
So I don't know.

1246
01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:54.790
Doesn't he have like a fucking tattoo right between his pecs?

1247
01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:00.190
It's like a dagger.
It's either a dagger.
I,
one of those Ben Franklin quill pens.

1248
01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:02.590
I don't know where this,
I have no idea.

1249
01:17:02.591 --> 01:17:04.390
I don't know who the fuck is going to win it,
to be honest with you.

1250
01:17:04.391 --> 01:17:07.570
I've been doing a lot of standup and those fights always come on Saturday
nights.

1251
01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:10.010
I ordered the package,

1252
01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:15.430
so now my cable bills like fucking 200 bucks a month.
And,
uh,

1253
01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:18.650
you know what I hate?
I hate whenever you're the guy hosting the fight,
right?

1254
01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:21.770
And you're like,
again,
I know I won't invite six other guys to come over.

1255
01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:25.550
Everybody tosses me fucking whatever,
10,
15 bucks.

1256
01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:30.740
And then,
you know,
the fight costs me,
you know,
10,
15,
and whatever.
What happens?

1257
01:17:30.741 --> 01:17:33.590
Everybody throws,
you crumpled up twenties the end of the night,

1258
01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:37.130
you stuff it in your pocket and you go out and you spend it on gumballs and

1259
01:17:37.131 --> 01:17:38.790
fucking raisins and you know,

1260
01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:42.080
toilet paper and then the bill comes along and it's like,

1261
01:17:42.081 --> 01:17:44.960
you never had that money.
I don't know why.

1262
01:17:44.961 --> 01:17:48.320
Why can't you just be thankful during the week of Thanksgiving that you got some

1263
01:17:48.321 --> 01:17:50.960
fleet toilets,
April,
blah.
That is the worst fucking shirt I've ever seen.

1264
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:56.600
Picture a lime Green Charlie Brown shirt except this and did the zig zag line is

1265
01:17:56.601 --> 01:18:00.690
just straight.
And for some weird reason,
you're wearing it with intelligence,

1266
01:18:00.730 --> 01:18:04.400
Colo style.
And for some reason you're wearing black slacks with it.

1267
01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:10.120
And then you ran across the parking lot and sort of a run walk on the balls of

1268
01:18:10.731 --> 01:18:12.870
your feet.
Like how Walter Payton use the F,

1269
01:18:13.670 --> 01:18:17.780
maybe he's trying to avoid major injury just like him.
Anyways,
let me wrap it up.

1270
01:18:17.781 --> 01:18:21.890
This fucking podcast cause I got some Chia tell you have to go do when I go back

1271
01:18:21.891 --> 01:18:26.840
into the building and old man.
Um,
all right.
Oh,

1272
01:18:26.841 --> 01:18:29.510
what are we gonna do?
Oh,
let's hype.
But type what I got coming.
Oh,
first of all,

1273
01:18:29.511 --> 01:18:31.010
you know what I forgot to do with fucking thing.

1274
01:18:31.011 --> 01:18:32.510
I've got to do at the top of this podcast.

1275
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:37.580
I wanted to thank Joe Perry from Aerosmith for calling in,
uh,
uninformed.

1276
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.310
There's the radio show I do with Joe to Rosa.

1277
01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.480
We had a great time interviewing him and he was obviously our biggest and

1278
01:18:44.481 --> 01:18:49.460
coolest guests we've ever had.
Totally down to earth.
And uh,

1279
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:50.850
you know,
I dunno,

1280
01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.290
it's pretty fucking awesome to get to interview somebody who you've been

1281
01:18:54.291 --> 01:18:56.210
listening to for the last 30 years,
you know?

1282
01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:00.530
So that's what I'm thankful for this week at Thanksgiving and a,

1283
01:19:00.531 --> 01:19:02.780
I would also be thankful if people come up to my show.

1284
01:19:02.781 --> 01:19:06.530
Caroline's the first weekend in December.

1285
01:19:07.390 --> 01:19:11.510
Let's see,
seventh,
sixth,
fifth,
fourth,
December 4th through the seventh.

1286
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:13.810
I'll be a Caroline's comedy club on Broadway.

1287
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:18.790
The last stop on the uninformed tour with me and Joe to Rosa with special
guests,

1288
01:19:18.791 --> 01:19:23.600
Harris Stanton who will be hosting.
And uh,
and that's it.

1289
01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:28.010
Happy Thanksgiving to everybody.
Thank you for sending in the questions.
Oh,

1290
01:19:28.011 --> 01:19:30.260
and if you guys could do me a favor,
if you can go to my website,

1291
01:19:30.261 --> 01:19:31.190
if you're not on it right now,

1292
01:19:31.191 --> 01:19:34.340
just go to [inaudible] dot com if you scroll down on the right hand side,

1293
01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:38.960
you can actually see where you can sign up for my email list just because a lot

1294
01:19:38.961 --> 01:19:42.800
of times they send out bulletins about being in Seattle on my space and they

1295
01:19:42.801 --> 01:19:47.270
ended up going to people who live in Albuquerque.
If you,
if you're on my website,

1296
01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:52.250
you literally just sign up on the,
uh,
the city that's nearest you.

1297
01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:56.060
So that way you don't have to get a fucking email from me every two weeks.

1298
01:19:56.061 --> 01:19:58.370
I just don't want to be spamming people or any of that shit.

1299
01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.230
So if you sign up on my website,

1300
01:20:00.231 --> 01:20:04.220
you'll only get bulletins from me when I'm playing in your area or if I'm going

1301
01:20:04.221 --> 01:20:08.730
to be on TV.
Basically if it's something that you can either watch here or go to,

1302
01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:12.540
it's the only time you'll get emails.
All right.
So that is it.

1303
01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:14.190
Thank you for listening to the podcast.

1304
01:20:14.191 --> 01:20:16.950
I apologize the last couple of weeks of feeling like he thinks it's been a

1305
01:20:16.951 --> 01:20:21.600
little bit lame because I've been,
uh,
I've been really busy trying to do,

1306
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:25.560
do some shit out here and um,
and that's it.

1307
01:20:25.561 --> 01:20:27.480
So what have I got next weekend?

1308
01:20:27.481 --> 01:20:29.130
Next week is going to be allowed to do a Sunday night.

1309
01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:33.750
Next week there will be a Sunday night podcast and I'll,

1310
01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:35.670
I'll be better rested for it.
All right.

1311
01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:40.700
But I appreciate you guys sending them the questions and I'll just keep saying

1312
01:20:40.711 --> 01:20:43.560
the same thing over and over again for another 18 minutes if I don't hang up.

1313
01:20:43.561 --> 01:20:47.950
All right,
so you guys all have a good Thanksgiving and uh,
you know,

1314
01:20:47.951 --> 01:20:51.440
and just try to remember what you have to be thankful for.
All right.
I'll try it

1315
01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.353
<v 5>the next week.</v>

1316
01:21:18.190 --> 01:21:19.950
You can't see what care

1317
01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:26.580
to the patients.

1318
01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:36.873
Sarah?

1319
01:21:57.870 --> 01:21:58.703
Uh,

1320
01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:08.320
uh,

1321
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:17.880
uh,

1322
01:22:35.690 --> 01:22:36.740
uh,

1323
01:22:45.290 --> 01:22:48.400
uh.
Oh Wow.
