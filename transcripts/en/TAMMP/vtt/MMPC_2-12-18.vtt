1
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.670
All right.
Hey,
what's going on?
Is Bill Burn?

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.000
It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday,
September.

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:10.950
Now February 12th.
There's a fucking comedian.

4
00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:12.720
I don't even know whether I didn't know where the fuck I am.

5
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:16.730
February 12 2018 what's going on?
How are you?

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.690
Um,
usually,
usually I do these by myself.

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.590
Usually I'm just sitting alone by,
it's like,
you know what?
Fuck this.

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.910
My buddy called me up.

9
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:31.911
He's got a podcast he wants to promote and he's a fucking eagles fan.

10
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:33.420
So I figured why not?

11
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:36.390
I got to go on because for some reason people think I actually fucking hate

12
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:39.120
Philly just cause I got booed there because of that video.
Yeah.

13
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:42.990
And it's just like,
no,
I got booed in Philly if I,
if he got booed in Texas.

14
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:44.850
What do you do?
You make fun of fucking pickup trucks,

15
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:49.560
chicks with too much makeup?
All of it.
I just make fun of Texas in general.

16
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:53.970
I think everyone just goes to Texas.
My Goal Goto Stays Kentucky.
I like tech.

17
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.380
Well,
it's Kevin Shay,
everybody from the,
uh,

18
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.100
the Kevin Shea podcasts to all I'm saying podcasts,
all I'm saying,

19
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.670
let me ask it.
That's easy.
Right?
So I remember,

20
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.380
do you know every host in it also kind of gets you off the hook or whatever you

21
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:11.040
just said.
Exactly.

22
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:14.850
I all I'm saying it says too many people.

23
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.600
I didn't mean to specifically pick out that group like they needed to go.

24
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:23.450
But this too.
Any fucking people.
I,
I mean host fucks it up though.
It's,

25
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.900
it's of funny cause they go,
they go with you in trouble.

26
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.350
All of them same podcasts.
I'm saying all I'm saying,

27
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:32.840
I said you can read it so easy they ass two more times before they go onstage.

28
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.440
And they'd go,
Oh,
I'm talking about what you doing,
how's it going?

29
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.520
And so we know you didn't,
they're getting all Sassy.
Yes.

30
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:45.780
And we always bet the other,
and all I'm saying isn't really a that's,
that's,

31
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:49.530
that's pretty mainstream vernacular.
I,
you know,
I didn't,
I thought it was

32
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.000
fucking,
getting a title is hard.
Like you have the best title ever.

33
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.020
It's just the way.
Yeah.
It's simple.
It's so simple.
That's why I did it.

34
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.490
Is that why you remember when it would come out funny and then people go,

35
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.240
we should do one every day of the week.
It's like,

36
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:05.910
well then it's not the money you got the Thursday.

37
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:10.690
I do the third Thursday just before Friday and Monday morning podcast.
Um,

38
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.680
I love when people just,
they go fucking all out.
Yeah.

39
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:16.890
Like you show up some of these comics studios,

40
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:19.980
you feel like you're doing Howard Stern.
I,
you don't want to be like,
dude,

41
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:22.620
you can really keep you overhead way.
I look,

42
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:26.400
I'm not talking about guys like Rogan,
like Rogan in,
we'll have like,
you know,

43
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.610
fucking super,
super famous people.
I'm just talking just like,

44
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.170
oh just emits a jerk off like me and I'm having you over there.

45
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.270
A reason why you're not in my house right now is because my daughter,

46
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.370
I figured that I figured,
cause your daughter's sleeping and then I didn't,

47
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.530
I didn't know you moved.
Like when you texted me the judge in the studio.
I know,

48
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:47.160
but when you text me me or you mean this,
this still you.
Yeah,
you,

49
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:51.360
when you texted me,
I was like,
why would he move to Burbank as like,

50
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.270
that was my,
I was like pill.
I was like,
you're doing well.

51
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.510
You got more bang for getting more bang for my buck out saying why would you

52
00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:00.070
move to where I liked the,
I

53
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.730
<v 1>like the valley.
You know you're getting better,
better conversations out here.</v>

54
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.540
You know what I mean?

55
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.570
You meet some guy who did something on mash way back in the day,

56
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.340
a bunch of Trump supporters.

57
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.740
<v 0>You know that all that set,
the Hillary stuff gets old man in Hollywood.</v>

58
00:03:13.741 --> 00:03:16.080
It's like,
I get it.
I get it.
You know what I mean?
I want to hear it.

59
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.480
I want to hear somebody actually thinks something good's going on.

60
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.460
I love it and he's making it better every day.
My burrito takes better.

61
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.930
That's Taco tastes better.
I don't,
I don't really talk to a lot of people.

62
00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:31.070
You know that about me.
Well then why did you come down here?
Oh,
but you,

63
00:03:31.071 --> 00:03:33.740
it's just cause your team just won the Superbowl.

64
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.520
That e a g l e s by the way,
I am con evil.

65
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.680
I'm a fucking huge eagles fan,
but I hate that fucking song.
The fight song fly.

66
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.530
How does it go?
I don't know.
Fly.
It has to be old,
right?
It's not,

67
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.630
it's fucking not,
I did a whole research,

68
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.340
I thought it was from like 1920 or 18 cause it's not fly.
Eagles fly on.
I see.

69
00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:57.900
That sounds like it was written the same week of for,
he's a jolly good fellow

70
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.350
back when that wasn't corny to say.
It's,
it's weird cause it's supposed to sound,

71
00:04:04.351 --> 00:04:05.880
oh it's got the boom boom boom.

72
00:04:05.881 --> 00:04:09.090
Like the jobs up front and it goes get into my head.
I'm low.

73
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.330
So I looked it up [inaudible] 19

74
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.750
<v 1>five or something like that is like 30 years ago,
32 years ago.
Fuck.</v>

75
00:04:17.751 --> 00:04:18.760
I guess you'd put it this way.

76
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.360
If you were in 1985 right now and that song was 32 years old,

77
00:04:23.361 --> 00:04:25.130
they would have been written in 1953

78
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.390
<v 0>yeah.
Oh Shit.
But I gotta be honest.
You hit him high,
hit him low is is very like,</v>

79
00:04:30.391 --> 00:04:33.720
still like that sounds like it's written in the forties.
It sounds very college.

80
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.940
No,
no,
no.
I mean college like high school.
I would say college.
Don't be too,

81
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.270
too hard.
Oh No.
I love the song.
I love,
here's the thing.

82
00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:46.230
It's one of those songs where I love that,
but I acknowledge,
acknowledges corny.

83
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.530
Okay.
Do you mean it's cheesy,
but I love,
is it flat?

84
00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:52.860
You go fly up up to this gap.

85
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.770
Is it like a disco remake and like getting uncomfortable?
You seek it.

86
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.260
I'll fucking do you know,
uh,
the Po boy,

87
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.670
he's a jolly good fellow.
The goes one.

88
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.470
The fucking Superbowl number one.
Uh,

89
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.870
<v 1>we were going to Breyer.</v>

90
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.820
It is like years ago I happened to walk all of those gigs out does drives,

91
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.500
we hate those fucking jobs.
No,
I swear to God,
Dude.

92
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:22.120
I almost like was ready to fucking just leave la yesterday.
No Way.
I did.

93
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.290
I did that.
It was like fucking Saturday.
It was a Saturday afternoon and I was,

94
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:30.490
I can rush hour traffic and you want to get mad but you're going to be like,

95
00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:34.000
well I'm also out here and they're all just fucking,

96
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.060
nobody is fucking talking about doing something about this population problem.

97
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.760
And a,

98
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.520
I'll tell you one thing we have to get a problem of is touching the desk and

99
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.740
hitting this.
This is going to be annoying in this.

100
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:49.090
We have a new podcast studio here.
Oh Shit.
Are we doing that?
No,
I,
I just,

101
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:52.120
I've been hearing it so we're going to have to put some sort of padding here.

102
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.780
I don't know why,
but anyways,
I like nature,
right?

103
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.100
I enjoyed like watching animals in that

104
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.740
<v 0>type of shit.
But I always have my,
my,</v>

105
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.500
I never take the remote out of my hand when I watch a nature show cause right

106
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:06.830
when they start talking about what's going on with them and how they're all

107
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:09.530
going to die off because of us,
I shut it off.

108
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.610
Well my daughter always takes the remote and it's amazing.

109
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.300
My fucking remote sucks.
I can literally be pointing at the TV,
like change,

110
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:19.580
change,
change,
what the fuck won't do anything.

111
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.790
My daughter picks it up and he's like walking away with it and we'll both

112
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:26.660
somehow turn on the fucking DVD player.
I still have one of those.
Um,

113
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.980
is it digital?
Is the remodel all digital?
We're like,
no,

114
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.640
I have direct TV and I love direct TV,

115
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.810
but they're remote sucks.
You look at it,
you have to fucking reboot the thing.

116
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.010
It's like,
it's like a,

117
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:43.400
it's like it was in a an abusive relationship and it's over sensitive.

118
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.280
I feel like it was recycled.
I'm like some racist had it before me.

119
00:06:47.281 --> 00:06:51.020
It was constantly throwing it at the TVS funny.
And then they just like,
you know,

120
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.070
like all our old phones that you watched a bunch of porn on an aisle over there

121
00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:57.780
and like Thailand and the Philippines.
Do you know how he did you?

122
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.980
Did you have a I have a laptop that I use.
Just report.

123
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.160
Yeah,
I,
I'm very specific.

124
00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:08.970
Just proof or something.
It's just,

125
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.830
it's just the hard job of silt may on a latex.

126
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.450
It's just so old and shot and I don't give a fuck if it gets diseases early.

127
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:21.890
May suddenly,
yeah,
fuck yeah.
It stays,
it separate.
But it's old.
It's big,
isn't it?

128
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.940
You know what that reminds me?

129
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:26.240
Have you ever see these people that get like foster kids and they feed their,

130
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:29.000
they're real kids and they just take the checks for the foster kids.

131
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.920
Maybe the kid will look like he's fucking eight years old when really boning

132
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.100
you'll be like,
how old are you?
And he's like 26.
I didn't know that was a thing.

133
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:39.890
That is a thing.
Ah,
feed him like fucking paste and shit.

134
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.960
Here's what was confusing when I was younger.
I'm like,
I'm adopted.
I never,

135
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.000
it doesn't surprise me.
The irritating,

136
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.220
I don't know the difference.

137
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.470
I didn't know the difference between foster and adopted.
Okay.

138
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.420
So you thought there was like foster and kid means,
uh,

139
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.480
you just take them for a little while,
right?
Yeah,

140
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.550
but they were always like abused and I was never abused and I couldn't wrap my

141
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:10.970
brain as a kid.
I called my parents,
mom and dad,

142
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.260
but then my friends down the street who were a family,

143
00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:18.530
but they were divorced with kids,
call them by their fucking names.

144
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.780
While it's great to hear,
that's why they got a divorce.

145
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.910
They were never committed.
They weren't committed to each other.

146
00:08:22.911 --> 00:08:24.080
They weren't committed to having the kids.

147
00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.580
It gets weird like when they would call their mom by their first name.
Well My,

148
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.670
well,
my daughter learns how to speak.
I'm going to be like,
this is mister shame.

149
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.610
She's not going to call you Kevin and I don't like that.
I'm like,

150
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.450
I fucking can't stand when people do like my buddies,
we'll talk to you.

151
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.650
Are there other parents and they say,
Hey John Paul,
it's weird.

152
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:47.660
It would help if we kind of dressed like adults though.
I mean,

153
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:51.170
you gotta call my hair.
You got to have you go.
You're an adult.

154
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.440
It's not,
you don't have a,
you know what it was.
No,
but back in the day,

155
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:56.220
like you know,

156
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.700
<v 1>people just to fucking like if you want,
I was,
I tape recorded all,</v>

157
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:01.530
like they had all the NFL films,

158
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:07.220
Superbowls in a row on NFL films and I taped all 51 of them and I'm just working

159
00:09:08.491 --> 00:09:12.240
my way through him.
I love him.
I can't get into the awesome,
they're awesome.

160
00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:15.810
So I was watching him and uh,
first of all,
like the first,

161
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.650
like 11 super bowls were played in like the afternoon.

162
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.600
I know they played like rice stadium at two lane,
you know what I mean?

163
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:28.120
And there was just like the fucking college band,
like what have,

164
00:09:28.121 --> 00:09:32.850
I'm like the Michigan marching band went out there and play.
Did it?
Uh,

165
00:09:32.851 --> 00:09:35.950
the night I thought you was scatting Horn paid,

166
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.010
I think it would start doing a band or something.
Now you're in my fucking head.

167
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:46.590
Didn't fit
the niners.

168
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.960
Yup.
They played in Golden Gate Park.

169
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.310
I remember for one of the navy ships and probably an NFL championship,

170
00:09:53.311 --> 00:09:54.870
but you guys sucked back then.
So I don't know.

171
00:09:54.871 --> 00:09:58.170
I think you had like one good year in the forties and 50s.
It was one,

172
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.010
it was one in the fifties.
In the 1960 was the last one.
And we used to,

173
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.920
we always get into this discussion about,
uh,

174
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:09.540
like you think it matters what the NFL championship,
Nfl titles should count.

175
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.890
They do count,
but they're not super bowls.
And you know,
I don't get that.

176
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.060
You know,
there was no other league.
I get it.
I get it.

177
00:10:18.061 --> 00:10:20.880
But now there is another league.
There's two.
No,
there's still,
there was,

178
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.550
there was,
there was still a fucking no,
you don't understand.

179
00:10:23.551 --> 00:10:28.250
The AFL started in 1960.
Before then there was,
there was only the,
no,

180
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.590
there was the NFL and then the AFL came in.

181
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.010
I'll give you a little history lesson.
One,
the first year of the AFL,
okay.

182
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:36.570
All the NFL owners laughed.

183
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.740
Bahahahaha look at these fucking morons wasted their money.

184
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.380
But while they laughed at him,
they didn't,

185
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.850
they made two moves to fuck over the AFL.
The first thing they did was,

186
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.540
uh,
I think the team with the most amount of money was,

187
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:55.870
was that was the Dallas Texans.
They will read and white,
right?
They let him,

188
00:10:55.871 --> 00:11:00.240
he became the Kansas City chiefs.
So what the NFL did was immediately or,
uh,

189
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:04.380
gave Dallas and NFL franchise.
That's how the cowboy started.

190
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:09.150
That started so that there would be a team in the same city as the wealthiest

191
00:11:09.151 --> 00:11:11.880
AFL team.
They're trying to cut the head off the snake here.

192
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.710
So then basically the figuring both,
they are going to be low quality of,

193
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.510
of players because they're both brand new.
However,

194
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.620
you could see Jim Brown or whoever,
like the superstar that day was,

195
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.160
would come in and play the cowboys.

196
00:11:24.161 --> 00:11:26.250
So you're going to go to that game rather than the Dallas Texans.

197
00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:30.600
And it kind of worked because the Texans ended up moving to Kansas City and

198
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:31.680
became the chiefs.
All right.

199
00:11:31.681 --> 00:11:34.950
And then the other move they made was one of their franchises in the Minnesota

200
00:11:34.951 --> 00:11:39.120
Vikings were initially going to be an AFL team.
And they came in and they said,

201
00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:43.680
hey,
uh,
you want to join the NFL?
And then they said,
hey,
fuck the AFL,

202
00:11:43.681 --> 00:11:45.120
let's go with this team.
So that's what they did.

203
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.050
They tried to fuck over to teams.
That's what they did.
Now the NFL continues.

204
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.420
There's all these fucking championships being one.

205
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.760
The Green Bay packers won like 13 of them and they're the New York Yankees.

206
00:11:55.761 --> 00:11:57.310
They're the fucking Celtics there though.

207
00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.230
They're the Montreal Canadiens I'll football,

208
00:12:00.231 --> 00:12:03.500
but they just don't recognize their first 12.
So they say the Steelers,

209
00:12:03.501 --> 00:12:07.010
I was six Superbowls.
So in ninth,

210
00:12:07.011 --> 00:12:11.210
after 1969 when the jets beat the fucking,

211
00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:16.130
uh,
no colts was it called?
They beat the colts.
And,

212
00:12:16.131 --> 00:12:16.964
um,

213
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:21.470
there was a merger talk was already there and the AFL was actually doing so well

214
00:12:21.471 --> 00:12:25.070
and was such an exciting product that it was kind of looking like they might

215
00:12:25.071 --> 00:12:27.440
actually might take over the NFL.
All right.

216
00:12:27.441 --> 00:12:32.330
And the only guy who had the balls to say,
fuck the new NFL merger deal was,
uh,

217
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:37.040
was,
was what's his face there?
Jesus Christ.
It just based on his name?
Uh,
uh,

218
00:12:37.041 --> 00:12:40.760
with the Raiders.
Oh,
Al Davis.
Al Davis.
Al Davis was fuck that.

219
00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:42.620
He just didn't want to beat him.
He wanted to bury him.

220
00:12:42.621 --> 00:12:45.320
He wanted to put them out of business and everybody else was like,
no,
fuck that.

221
00:12:45.321 --> 00:12:49.970
Let's join.
So they joined.
Okay.
Now that has happened in other leagues.

222
00:12:49.971 --> 00:12:54.080
The Nhl with like the Ihl with Wayne Gretzky's where the fuck he played with

223
00:12:54.081 --> 00:12:57.740
India?
Uh,
Indianapolis like um,
I guess that was his first team.

224
00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.720
I used to know all of this shit but they,

225
00:12:59.721 --> 00:13:01.670
they've absorbed teams from other leagues.

226
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.900
The NBA took in Aba team?

227
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:06.330
<v 0>Yeah.
But they,
they bought,</v>

228
00:13:06.331 --> 00:13:10.050
they still count the Celtics championships but they didn't change the name of

229
00:13:10.051 --> 00:13:12.180
the title.
I think it's cause of the event.

230
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.410
You are changing the name of the title.
I will also say that it is,

231
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.590
maybe that's what it is because you're changing the name of the title.

232
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.420
The basketball never changed the name of the time.

233
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:27.020
The first two green bay one out where the NFL AFL championship game as was the

234
00:13:27.031 --> 00:13:31.680
third one,
which which jets?
The jets was an NFL NFL title game,
which is Great.

235
00:13:31.681 --> 00:13:35.940
But you know what's funny about,
uh,
the whole story,
you just,
you told me,

236
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.280
I would just say God,
I'm like God,
the Vikings still suck.
But yeah.

237
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.310
Do you know the Patriots now?
You have tied,

238
00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.560
they've lost the most super bowls but they also,

239
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.360
oh they don't have these also we bought,

240
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.690
the thing is we've also been to the most,
you've been fucking 10.

241
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.970
We're five and five.
Your tea,
you've been a tech.

242
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.390
Here's the thing I saw is not an NFL fan out there that wouldn't take that

243
00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:02.310
except for the Steelers.
The Steelers or the 49 is in the uh,
the 49.

244
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.201
And the cowboys,

245
00:14:03.201 --> 00:14:05.310
cause they already have five and they've been at like eight or something.

246
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:09.240
It has been five.
Denver's been to fall river last five.
There's one three.

247
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.350
So they've been to a

248
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:15.990
<v 1>cowboys have one five and they'd see they lost to the colts.</v>

249
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.330
They lost to the Steelers twice.
I think that's it.
I think they'd been to eight.

250
00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:21.580
Do

251
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:26.080
<v 0>you?
I saw you in clip on
and you go,
Oh,</v>

252
00:14:26.081 --> 00:14:29.080
I've been through five that these losses.
I'm like,
how old are you?

253
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.950
Because the first patriots Superbowl was 86.
Okay.
That makes sense.
Cause I was,

254
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.410
I am old.
I'm turning 50 in June.
Well congratulations.
Yeah,
I turned,

255
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.340
I turned 42 on Friday in America.
Yeah,

256
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:45.850
you look great.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Considering how much both of us drink,
I mean,

257
00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:50.800
I,
I we're both in good shape too.
I know,
I know.
This is the suck our dicks.

258
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:58.160
<v 1>So anyways,
um,
before we get into your big win,
cause I'm really,</v>

259
00:14:58.161 --> 00:15:01.620
cause I gotta be honest with you.
I actually as a spouse,

260
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.760
I'm old enough to remember when all the Boston team's sucked except for the

261
00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:07.880
Celtics eighties,
but then Len bias died and Reggie Lewis,

262
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.760
Diana was just fucking over.
Um,
I,

263
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:15.620
I remember what it felt like the first time.
So I was actually,

264
00:15:15.621 --> 00:15:19.730
when the Patriots were not looking good to me.
Okay.
You know,

265
00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:24.080
when we played the Steelers and we had the game won and we let up that 90 we let

266
00:15:24.081 --> 00:15:28.640
up 90 yards on a screen pass and then the first year they won.
No,

267
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.880
this year,
this year,
this year in December we did that.
Oh,

268
00:15:31.881 --> 00:15:35.120
against the playoff team.
And then they threw a touchdown to win the game.

269
00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:39.260
But the NFL now is like,
oh what did he had the ball?
Did he really have the ball?

270
00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:40.340
So it's not a catch.
But that was,

271
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.910
that game was a fucking loss and that gave us home field advantage and that

272
00:15:43.911 --> 00:15:47.300
helped us fucking go to the Superbowl.
The Superbowl.
Yeah.
So here was the thing,

273
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.530
my,
I was kind of watching you guys cause I was just going,

274
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:51.650
well who am I gonna root for?
I was like,

275
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:53.630
oh la rams would be cool if they got something,

276
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.080
the fucking eagles would be cool cause they never won out.
So here's the thing,

277
00:15:57.081 --> 00:16:01.460
if my team is in fucking in it,
I'm going to root for the team.
That is all,

278
00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:04.090
there you go.
I'm going to do it.
I'm not a dick.
I mean,
I didn't do,
Oh,

279
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.260
I'm not a dick.
All right.
So,
but you know,

280
00:16:06.261 --> 00:16:08.560
if it's the Yankees fuck the Yankees and if it's the cadence,

281
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.060
fuck the Canadians and if it's the Lakers fuck the Lakers.

282
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:14.180
But other than that I got to ask you why,
why the Canadians?
Oh,

283
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:15.390
Bruins Canadians is okay.

284
00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:20.391
A huge used to be a huge rivalry and what happens is is one team never wins it

285
00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:24.680
and then the other team always wins it and then then what happens is then you

286
00:16:24.681 --> 00:16:26.660
win it and that's the end of the movie.

287
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.380
Then the credits are rolling like they tried to make like the red sox Yankees

288
00:16:30.381 --> 00:16:33.320
thing.
It's not the same.
No,
it's over.
And it's kind of like,

289
00:16:33.321 --> 00:16:36.410
you know when they make the sequel but the star in the movie doesn't sign on to

290
00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:40.700
do it again or like back in the day when like a movie like major league too

291
00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:45.200
without Wesley Snipes.
They took Omar Epps,
slashed all.
He was out.
Okay.

292
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:46.630
There you go.
There you go.
There you go.

293
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.590
Well I would say at Major League without Charlie Sheen.
Yeah.
Okay.

294
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.570
This third one then.
Okay.
The third load one or jaws three d,

295
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.140
jaws three just to the second Spielberg goes,
Nah,
I'm not doing it.

296
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.950
It just became a,
became the shoes look good.
You didn't like it.

297
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.540
Was that the one?
What was the one with the sharks started roaring?

298
00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:10.310
That was the third one,
right?
It was going like,
ah,
hours on hours.
The one,

299
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:15.020
the fourth one.
That's bad.
Okay,
that's bad.
Aaron,
you knew that.
That's hilarious.

300
00:17:15.021 --> 00:17:17.270
He just,
he was still immediate with the four.
I was like,

301
00:17:17.271 --> 00:17:19.880
that's why that's so fucking funny.
Everybody looks at shark,
NATO,

302
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.750
like it's this worst thing ever.
It's like,
no.
Do the groundwork had been laid,

303
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:28.670
but I like that movies.
But let's get back to this real quick.
So I,

304
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.010
so I was going to sit there and you know,
you know,

305
00:17:31.011 --> 00:17:32.510
I got a lot of friends yourself.

306
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.980
Like I have a good half dozen people that I know that are from Philly.
You know,

307
00:17:36.981 --> 00:17:39.690
I,
there's a lot of cool chicks from Philly to that shake.

308
00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.690
The women will fill your cool.
Yeah.
So I wasn't going to be that fucking,

309
00:17:44.691 --> 00:17:46.760
you know,
asshole.
So anyways,

310
00:17:46.761 --> 00:17:51.290
so you guys beat us and now you know the deal,
you lose a big game like that.

311
00:17:51.291 --> 00:17:54.620
You go on radio silence.
I'm not going on fucking the Internet.

312
00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.110
I mean I kind of still have to because of the podcast,
but I,

313
00:17:57.111 --> 00:17:59.540
I'm not going to watch ESPN so I didn't get to see you guys.

314
00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.430
My favorite thing ever is,

315
00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.840
is fucking grown men crying over sports is the funniest.

316
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.690
Like that Eagle's fan who called him with Carson Wentz went down.

317
00:18:08.691 --> 00:18:09.524
Did you hear that?

318
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:10.603
<v 0>I didn't see that one.</v>

319
00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.470
<v 1>I thought you was the funniest thing is this sportscast it gets like freaked
out.</v>

320
00:18:15.471 --> 00:18:17.480
He's like,
Hey,
he's like buddy,
you crying?
He's like,

321
00:18:17.481 --> 00:18:21.400
oh well we'll win it next year,
man.
Relaxed.
So fight.
Did you see the guy,
um,

322
00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:22.720
<v 0>uh,</v>

323
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.080
who's waiting at the fence when they won the Superbowl and when they're landing

324
00:18:26.081 --> 00:18:30.730
just to watch,
he was crying.
He was like a 54 year old black dude,

325
00:18:30.731 --> 00:18:33.160
just sobbing black guy.
Yeah.

326
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:39.120
He's just like my whole fucking life,
my whole fucking life.
And the way,

327
00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.950
and here's the eight that Patriot hurts way less now.

328
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.070
They kinda got me.

329
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.660
<v 1>That hurts way less now knowing that somebody's eagles fan ended up being,</v>

330
00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:51.990
that fucking happened.
Oh,
come on man.
We fucking,
we're drowning.

331
00:18:51.991 --> 00:18:54.900
We're drowning in rings over here,
Kevin.
But here,
here's the thing.

332
00:18:54.901 --> 00:18:58.730
Your first one,
you know,
you know that the game,
I shut the fuck up.
Yeah.

333
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.960
People were losing it.
I was up again when I,

334
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.440
everybody like we were in the exact opposite end zone and he like kicked a field

335
00:19:07.321 --> 00:19:07.951
goal and I'm all right.

336
00:19:07.951 --> 00:19:11.540
I put my hands out like I was holding back the crowd on Beatlemania and my row

337
00:19:11.541 --> 00:19:14.070
because my brother and dad when they was like,
oh fuck,
oh fuck.

338
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.330
And it went through and it just,
I,
I was,

339
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:18.690
I couldn't believe it when it went through.

340
00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:21.150
Then I saw the confetti and do all of a sudden,

341
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.490
next thing I knew I was on the ground.
What?

342
00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:27.720
I just a whole section just tackled each other.
Oh,
that's fucking insane.

343
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:28.320
That's fun.

344
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.930
And then I was worried about my dad because I was doing my dad and he was like

345
00:19:30.931 --> 00:19:33.210
in his sixties at the time.
And he got up and he just,

346
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.920
he couldn't fucking believe it.
Right.

347
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.850
And I looked over and there was one guy still standing up.
Yeah.

348
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.920
And he was just standing there and I looked over and he was for some reasons

349
00:19:41.921 --> 00:19:43.520
staring at me and he just had it

350
00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:47.900
<v 0>tears in his eye and eye eyes kind of locked.
I had to like,
I had</v>

351
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.620
<v 1>to like look away like,
dude,
what the fuck?</v>

352
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:54.090
And I remember walking out of the stadium like,
just cause I,

353
00:19:54.091 --> 00:19:56.340
I went to the one we were when we lost to the packers,

354
00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.240
so I know what that feeling feels like.
Yeah.
And then when that wasn't it,

355
00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:04.920
but that wasn't close though,
that one.
It was until the opening of the half,

356
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.060
so to have two.

357
00:20:06.061 --> 00:20:11.040
So I basically had faith through fucking 18 and a half games.
So yeah,

358
00:20:11.041 --> 00:20:15.660
it was close.
And then they kick the fucking ball off.
And Tyrone Wheatley.
Oh No,

359
00:20:15.661 --> 00:20:18.000
no,
that was his name.
Desmond Howard.
I know,
I know.

360
00:20:18.001 --> 00:20:22.900
It was a kicker to win a fucking MVP and super kick returner.
Kick returner.
Yeah.

361
00:20:22.901 --> 00:20:26.850
Yeah.
So he ran the fucking thing back right at us.
That's fine.

362
00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.460
I might've been in the same end zone.
I don't know.

363
00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:32.930
I both times I had upper deck end zone seats.
So then when we want it,
yeah,

364
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.520
I was thinking like every time the Patriots go,

365
00:20:35.521 --> 00:20:38.550
I'm going at such a great experience.
So the next time we played,

366
00:20:38.551 --> 00:20:41.730
I believe you were playing the panthers and I was going to go,

367
00:20:41.731 --> 00:20:43.440
but it was on Sunday obviously.

368
00:20:43.441 --> 00:20:48.180
And then that Monday we were shooting the world series of dice sketch in the

369
00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:48.240
morning

370
00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.250
<v 0>for a Chappelle show.
Okay.</v>

371
00:20:50.251 --> 00:20:53.820
So I couldn't go and I went there and that's the first time I met Chelsie Murphy

372
00:20:53.821 --> 00:20:55.620
rest his soul.
And A,

373
00:20:55.621 --> 00:20:58.650
I remember being pissed that I could cite to had the act and work.

374
00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.840
Obviously it's like to be on the Chappelle show.
But I was like,
fuck man,

375
00:21:00.841 --> 00:21:01.830
I really wanted to go to that game.

376
00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:06.690
But I remember when the game was over and I was in my apartment,
we won.

377
00:21:06.691 --> 00:21:11.160
I was psyched that I still had two grand in my pocket.
I was like,

378
00:21:11.161 --> 00:21:16.080
wait a minute,
this is kind of fucking cool.
So then I was just like,
yeah,

379
00:21:16.081 --> 00:21:19.910
I don't need to go.
I saw the first one ever.
Yeah,

380
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.920
why am I going to go there and use up a ticket somebody else could have and like

381
00:21:22.921 --> 00:21:26.670
someday,
you know,
if I have a kid now I have a kid.
If she ever wants to go,

382
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.730
I'll take her and I'll do that.
But other than that,

383
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.900
you know I'm on the road all the time.
Did you?

384
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.880
You obviously got to feeling I don't,

385
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.080
I don't know if I'd be like if I was at the Superbowl,
my buddies went,
uh Huh.

386
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.120
They lost it.
They lost their minds.

387
00:21:42.121 --> 00:21:45.900
But they actually came back immediately and watched the game cause they said

388
00:21:45.901 --> 00:21:49.680
they couldn't really believe it.
Yeah.
They call it one or two.

389
00:21:49.681 --> 00:21:51.570
They didn't really see what was going on.

390
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.780
Well you don't get the analysis and the breakdown and all of that.

391
00:21:54.781 --> 00:21:59.310
Let me ask you this.
When,
when Brady fumbles the ball and you guys recover,
man,

392
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:03.540
dude,
what'd you do dude,
but by the way,
are you thinking like,
fuck,

393
00:22:03.541 --> 00:22:07.020
he's going to drive down the field.
We're going to lose?
No,
no,
no,
no.
I never,

394
00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:11.010
this is just crazy.
Normally with all the eagles teams,
I'm like,
ah,

395
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:15.600
they don't got it right that we're stomach feeling,
but this team,

396
00:22:15.601 --> 00:22:18.210
it was just this this year and I saw destiny.

397
00:22:18.211 --> 00:22:21.180
They lost their fucking quarterback.
I'm getting misty eyed thinking about it,

398
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:24.900
but then I was like,
ah,
it's not about Tom,
it's about the eagles.

399
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.210
That's how it felt this year about this team.

400
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.120
So when they didn't like how you guys all ran out as a team and it was a Hulu

401
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:35.570
show
we've been doing that stole I fucking by.

402
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:36.900
That was our thing,
by the way.

403
00:22:36.901 --> 00:22:41.901
I think it's stupid what the year you guys did it to now I think it's stupid.

404
00:22:42.511 --> 00:22:47.460
I love the intros.
I kind of miss high low.
It was like if I got to tell you,

405
00:22:47.461 --> 00:22:51.600
dude,
we went,
we've gone,
we've gone five and three.
Doing it that way.

406
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.730
We've been to eight of them,
so you might want to keep doing that.

407
00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.450
No one else was driving me nuts.

408
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.020
Was Chris Collins with flick up flipping out about that trick book.

409
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.790
<v 2>I love you the most top level talking to.
He's like,</v>

410
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:04.720
don't we just ran that fucking play.

411
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.740
<v 0>But here's the thing,
I saw it.
I saw that clip when you were calling.
You said,</v>

412
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:10.210
oh I wish Tom Woulda laid out.

413
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.630
I wish he caught it and the only reason cause I wanted to get him,

414
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.830
I want him to get hit.
Oh you did Josh.
Just like,
can I be honest with you?
Yeah.

415
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:22.180
That guy.
Every fucking Superbowl has driven us down for the win.
Everyone,

416
00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:22.470
you know,

417
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:27.370
and I actually looked at all the super bowls and I would say that we very easily

418
00:23:27.371 --> 00:23:31.180
could have been seven and one and the one game we should've lost was the Seattle

419
00:23:31.181 --> 00:23:35.890
guest.
Yeah.
It to Marshawn lynch,
both giants games.
We had Brady,

420
00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:40.900
the Welker boom first down over a satay Samuels intercepts the fucking ball to

421
00:23:40.901 --> 00:23:44.290
hit submit both hands.
Yeah,
we got that one.
But that Assad say Samuel,

422
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:45.380
but this equals one

423
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.530
<v 1>minded.
I was pretty fucking John by the end of it,</v>

424
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:51.380
by the end of the game and I just,
I'll tell you,
I'll tell you,

425
00:23:51.381 --> 00:23:54.860
I never felt good about this.
I never felt good about the team or the game going.

426
00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:56.960
And I said I believe I sent him my podcast.

427
00:23:56.961 --> 00:24:00.320
Take the eagles in the points on the points.
Yes,
yes.
Yeah.

428
00:24:00.321 --> 00:24:04.580
And I thought you guys had an unbelievable defense.
I'm like these guys,

429
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.790
this is looking like the fucking giant do.
Where was the defects and that game?

430
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:09.850
It was like a fucking pro bowl by the way.

431
00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.280
I've watched the game four times afterwards just to watch it.

432
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.910
Only Tom could have done that.
I guess that defense.

433
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.670
You know what's funny only Tom was is I was watching some of those fucking

434
00:24:19.671 --> 00:24:24.590
passes and how how he got out of the pocket.
Only Tom could have done that.

435
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:28.610
Well against that defense cause most,
most lie,
most of the wine.

436
00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:31.250
I'll have to watch it again because I didn't think you guys do.

437
00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.140
I thought both quarterbacks had like all day.

438
00:24:33.141 --> 00:24:36.530
I don't think he really kept to Brady fucking Nick foals had all day.

439
00:24:36.531 --> 00:24:41.060
Tom got hit like 12 times,
but your line was better than most.

440
00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.370
We just didn't have a decent,
I,
I,

441
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:50.240
I would never question our coaching staff of the Malfoy.
Anytime we do that,

442
00:24:50.241 --> 00:24:53.600
I'm a bad time.
Wes Welker like made all the new when,
when,
uh,
uh,

443
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:57.940
what's his face to find out?
He had the foot fetish.
Rex Ryan,
welcome.

444
00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:01.550
Does this whole interview like sort of giving him shit gone,
you know,
hey,

445
00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:03.770
we're just a,
you know,
you're playing the jets where he says,
yeah,

446
00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:08.240
we're going to put our best foot forward.
That,
you know,
yeah,

447
00:25:08.241 --> 00:25:12.740
it was funny.
And then they kept him out for the first court.
Anytime we do that,

448
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.970
I don't know if we've,
we've probably done that other time,

449
00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.720
but they just reminded me of that game.
Be Like,
oh,

450
00:25:16.721 --> 00:25:20.390
we're fucking with the chemistry here,
but,
but I'm a stand up comedian Kevin.

451
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:23.840
I'm not a fucking offensive coordinator.
So what our defensive coordinator,

452
00:25:23.841 --> 00:25:28.340
what do I know?
But I,
I watched that game four more times.
Like I said,
oh,

453
00:25:28.341 --> 00:25:31.780
it's that I still have the fucking Seattle and the Atlantic.
You still,

454
00:25:31.781 --> 00:25:36.050
you still on my fuck.
I still have it.
I bought,
I got the thing,
never raised him.

455
00:25:36.051 --> 00:25:38.840
My wife's like,
you never going to watch.
He's like,
yeah,
yeah,
you are.

456
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:42.620
You will when you're bored or you want to get your fuck his spirits up.

457
00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.190
She goes to bed early.
Dude,
I never going to watch this.

458
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:50.780
I just take the highlights of all 51 foot.
There's like this five losses in that.

459
00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:54.440
Well for losses.
Now we've got a fifth one and I'm still going to watch those.
No,

460
00:25:54.441 --> 00:25:58.700
it's,
it's the best buy.
I'm trying to have a Superbowl 20 we were up three,

461
00:25:58.701 --> 00:26:02.600
nothing against the 46 defense.
Tony Franklin,
speaking of feet,

462
00:26:02.601 --> 00:26:06.020
his bare feet came out and kicked one and I'm like,
yeah,
you know,

463
00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.350
I don't embarrass the talking.
All this shit all through that.

464
00:26:09.351 --> 00:26:12.710
That was the most dominant defense that I ever saw.
Here's a good one.

465
00:26:12.711 --> 00:26:17.711
Superbowl six Superbowls six is the Dallas cowboys in the Miami Dolphins.

466
00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:24.311
What's interesting is Tom Landry in Don Shula to legendary coaches.

467
00:26:24.321 --> 00:26:25.700
But when that game went down,

468
00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:29.990
they were both considered losers and like one of them is finally going to get

469
00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:33.110
the monkey off the back.
Dallas had the thing,
they could never win the big one.

470
00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:38.360
And they only been around since 1960 but they lost the ice bowl up in green bay.

471
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:42.860
I know,
dude,
I'm a fucking nurse.
And then the year before they played the colts,

472
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.680
they got there again and they fucking lawsuit colts in a really messy game.

473
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.790
And then Don Shula,
his big thing was,
uh,
he was with,

474
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.730
he was coaching the 69 colts that lost to the jets.

475
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:58.790
The first NFL team to lose to an AFL team was a major embarrassment and a,

476
00:26:59.311 --> 00:27:02.310
that ended his career there.
And then he went over to the dolphins.

477
00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:05.220
Wasn't that the undefeated season?
No,
no.
They went,

478
00:27:05.221 --> 00:27:08.460
they went three years in a row,
one of a,

479
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:10.330
I think two teams to ever go through years in a row.

480
00:27:10.331 --> 00:27:14.120
And only one has ever gone four years in a row.
And that's the,
the bills,
uh,

481
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.900
they lost to the cowboys and then the next year they beat the,

482
00:27:18.901 --> 00:27:21.710
uh,
that they beat the red.
Yeah,
they beat the Redskins.

483
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:22.680
That was the undefeated year.

484
00:27:22.681 --> 00:27:26.160
That was the year that they hadn't before there was 14 to nothing and they would

485
00:27:26.161 --> 00:27:28.560
line it up to kick a field.
Well this is how much of the NFL has changed.

486
00:27:28.561 --> 00:27:31.830
It's like there's like two minutes left in the third quarter and if,

487
00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:34.200
if this thing goes through there,
like the gut notches are going,

488
00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:35.043
this game's over.

489
00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:38.070
It's in the third quarter yet because no one's going to score that.

490
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:41.550
Mckinsey what all they did was fucking run cause they were like greasy was four,

491
00:27:41.551 --> 00:27:45.000
four,
four and the first quarter.
That's funny.
Do you know what I love?

492
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:50.060
I love the fact that back then how much cocaine those guys did DOJ ever see that

493
00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.660
cocaine cowboys and uh,
the one,
isn't that a movie?

494
00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:58.290
It was a documentary and it was about,
you know,
the cocaine Chaz.

495
00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:01.290
But what the cocaine in the Superbowl,
it wasn't above cocaine trafficking,

496
00:28:01.291 --> 00:28:02.124
cocaine trafficking.

497
00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.670
They tell this story about the Steelers and the dolphins and the AFC

498
00:28:05.671 --> 00:28:08.760
championship game or sealers in the Superbowl in Miami.

499
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:14.180
That entire old line went out the night before and the guy gave them all the

500
00:28:14.791 --> 00:28:17.130
coke.
They wanted to like four in the morning.

501
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.940
That's also a jail bird trying to get into a fucking documentary,
right?
No,
no,

502
00:28:20.941 --> 00:28:25.030
he was,
he was the main guy.
Well,
here's the thing though.
They also,
uh,

503
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:29.010
like the medical industry,
whatever they call him,

504
00:28:29.011 --> 00:28:33.840
said cocaine is no more addicting than coffee or caffeine.
Yeah.

505
00:28:33.841 --> 00:28:36.910
So that's what they initially said.
If you ever want to read,
uh,

506
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:39.600
an unbelievable book,
read the Hollywood Henderson,

507
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.800
he was basically the Lawrence Taylor before Lawrence Taylor and he got crazy on

508
00:28:43.801 --> 00:28:45.100
drugs.
And the reason why Lawrence Taylor,

509
00:28:45.101 --> 00:28:48.000
it looks like he just fell out of the sky and no one ever played the game like

510
00:28:48.001 --> 00:28:51.000
that is because Hollywood Henderson messed up his career so bad.

511
00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:54.270
But this highlights of that guy,
that guy was unbelievable.
In fact,

512
00:28:54.271 --> 00:28:58.720
I believe Superbowl 10,
1976,
when he played,

513
00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.850
when the cowboys played the Steelers,
they kicked the ball off.

514
00:29:02.851 --> 00:29:07.440
He's a linebacker.
They had him return it and he ran it like 55 fucking yards.

515
00:29:07.441 --> 00:29:11.670
The only person who stopped and was Roy Jarell dove to knock them out of bounds

516
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.600
and had his ribs exposed and Henderson's knees hit him in the ribs in and fucked

517
00:29:15.601 --> 00:29:17.400
him up.
And it caused darella.

518
00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:21.060
This really interesting caused them to fuck up a couple of kicks.

519
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.000
And so that was a big thing for the cowboys.
But they fucked up.
Cause when,

520
00:29:26.001 --> 00:29:27.900
when the second miss or something or the first,

521
00:29:27.901 --> 00:29:32.901
the second Miss Cliff Harris from the cowboys gets in Grl Roger Ellis face going

522
00:29:33.751 --> 00:29:36.480
like,
hey,
you fucked up buddy.
And uh,

523
00:29:36.481 --> 00:29:40.410
Jack Lambert was on the field and just picked fucking cliff Harris up like a

524
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.800
ragdoll and throw him under the ground.
Like basically it's amazing.
Yeah.

525
00:29:44.801 --> 00:29:45.820
And didn't get a penalty.

526
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.850
There's another thing when you watch those old highlight back to,
hey,

527
00:29:48.851 --> 00:29:53.170
knock it off fellas.
Yeah.
They don't give a fuck.
Telmate's they bought at Sears.

528
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:57.460
Brian Dawkins is videos of him.
Suplex and guys,
well,
here's the thing.

529
00:29:57.461 --> 00:30:01.600
The cowboys had that fucking game one in the first half.

530
00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:04.180
They called all these trick plays.
They were loose,
they were throwing the ball,

531
00:30:04.181 --> 00:30:07.720
doing all that they got in the second half.
They played fucking Marty Ball.

532
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.040
And I'm telling you man,

533
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:13.570
no fucking sport fucks you more when you play.

534
00:30:13.571 --> 00:30:14.800
Not to lose then football.

535
00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:19.510
I don't know what it is that says the falcons are doing.
Granted,

536
00:30:19.511 --> 00:30:23.740
Tom Played fucking lights out,
but you know that's a,
that's a colossal,

537
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.790
it's a clock.
It's a collapse.
I mean,
you know more about football history.

538
00:30:27.791 --> 00:30:30.910
I'm more recent,
but uh,
I don't know shit about football.

539
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:32.260
I've just watched a lot of video on it.

540
00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:35.100
It's like I watch Superbowl highlights the way Tom Brady,

541
00:30:35.101 --> 00:30:39.370
he actually watched game,
by the way.
I'm not film.
I don't want it.
Here's the,

542
00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:42.160
I like Carson Wentz and you must love Tom Brady.

543
00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.820
I don't want to see their personal life.
I don't,
I could give us,
no,

544
00:30:45.821 --> 00:30:49.060
I'm not built that way.
I don't like pre or post game analysis.
Yeah.

545
00:30:49.061 --> 00:30:52.750
I don't like any of that shit.
I don't want,
I don't want to say no,

546
00:30:52.751 --> 00:30:55.860
but I don't want to human moments.
I don't.
This is how fucking,

547
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:59.410
I don't want to see him as human.
I just want to see them as athletes is,
or the,

548
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.180
I think they're entitled to their privacy.

549
00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:06.370
I get that you should be able to go out as an NFL quarterback and if you want to

550
00:31:06.371 --> 00:31:10.750
go out and do some blow in a,
in a,
in a titty bar.
Yeah.

551
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.020
Here's this what I can't stand about fucking people today with their phones.

552
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:18.940
If they saw the local quarterback doing blow in a titty bar,

553
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:22.570
he's fucked.
Rather than thinking,
well,
shit,
I'm here to,

554
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:27.850
you know what I mean?
No.
I guess they will literally film The fucking guys.

555
00:31:27.851 --> 00:31:31.510
You Go,
Oh God,
I can't believe there's a story quarterback.
They'd say,

556
00:31:31.511 --> 00:31:34.930
what do you do?
You work with heavy machinery.
Yeah.

557
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.420
What the fuck do you do your fucking year in the titty bar to them?

558
00:31:37.421 --> 00:31:42.250
And that's like the whole like,
just let somebody go out,

559
00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:47.320
have a good bucket to,
to shut the fuck [inaudible] telling on everybody.
Just,

560
00:31:47.321 --> 00:31:50.440
they're just so fucking mad being Jimmy John's managers and shit.

561
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.700
It's just like the guy.

562
00:31:51.701 --> 00:31:54.500
If you can be a Jimmy John's manager and you can have a hell of a fuck,

563
00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.320
you could tell a week,

564
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:59.350
you could have a fucking weekend that would make Tom Brady be like,

565
00:31:59.351 --> 00:32:03.210
get the fuck Outta here.
Well Tom doesn't do that.
Tom's that doing that to me.

566
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:05.410
He's not going out and getting fucking nuts.
No,

567
00:32:05.411 --> 00:32:08.680
I'm not saying he is saying he should be able to.
Oh I have a second.

568
00:32:08.681 --> 00:32:11.850
You said that.
All I thought about was Ken Stabler.
I heard this great story.

569
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:14.680
He used to play for the Oakland Raiders,
uh,

570
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:17.680
before that horrific trade where they got Dan pastor reading and they switched

571
00:32:17.681 --> 00:32:21.820
in both then he became an oiler and finished up at the saints I believe.
And uh,

572
00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:24.910
he first fullest that today.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
I,

573
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:28.390
that's all I did was looking football course back then.
So it's,

574
00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.330
coach was giving him shit one time cause he went up booze in the night before.

575
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.260
He's just like,
he went to fuck you going out partying the night before him game.

576
00:32:35.261 --> 00:32:38.260
He just goes coach,
he goes,
how many hours sleep?

577
00:32:38.261 --> 00:32:40.130
And you need to go play a couple of hours of football.

578
00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:46.930
<v 0>That's awesome.
And there's nothing to say.
You're right.
You're right on.</v>

579
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.360
Those guys used to go out there and they would just fucking slinging it like,

580
00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.420
I don't know.
So anyways,
um,
real quick,

581
00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:57.020
how far into the salary?
Half Hour.
Fuck.

582
00:32:57.021 --> 00:32:58.460
At some point I got to read some advertising.

583
00:32:58.461 --> 00:33:00.440
So when they finally fucking winning,

584
00:33:00.441 --> 00:33:02.660
are you with the other Eagle Fans and you crying?

585
00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.450
He attack you in stunned silence by yourself.

586
00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:07.140
Where did you watch the game out of it?

587
00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:11.510
Do you remember that casino we played in San Diego.
We flew in a helicopter.

588
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:16.040
It's north.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Oh,
you were there.
So we were there.
The girl,

589
00:33:16.041 --> 00:33:19.310
I'm dating the girl,
I'm seeing the lady friend,
she's like,

590
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:23.180
I know you're not going to want to be around anyone,
so I'll get your old tail.

591
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.410
So she got us a hotel and then she's like,
I want to sit by the pool.

592
00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:30.050
So I'll rent wellness.
The cause a cabana with the TV.

593
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:34.040
It was fucking awesome.
We had a whole entire Gravana just to herself.

594
00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.500
I don't want to put any pressure on the relationship or you've got to marry that

595
00:33:36.501 --> 00:33:41.090
girl.
I couldn't believe it.
She goes,
she's a Steelers fan.

596
00:33:41.091 --> 00:33:43.640
She loves softball too.
But she goes,
I get it.
She goes,

597
00:33:43.641 --> 00:33:47.300
this is your fucking day dude.
She's an understand.
I know I could.

598
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:48.800
How many times have you said to a woman,

599
00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:53.080
I get it and you were right and you made their day.
No,
I'm telling you what she,

600
00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:56.780
I said to assign a woman that gets it and I totally said to her,
I go,

601
00:33:56.781 --> 00:34:01.690
you can totally buy my love.
I'm all,
I'm all for it.
So I never daydream.

602
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.540
Classic Guy.
She does something great to say with something sweet.
Yeah.

603
00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:08.630
And you made it seem so hook a rich maybe.
Yeah.
Little bit.
Little bit.
So I,

604
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:09.980
I don't ever day drink.

605
00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:13.310
That's one of the reasons why the Rosebowl thing is out the window.
Cause I,

606
00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:16.940
I'll give you see me when I'm drunk.
Do you think that's why you've never been?

607
00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.240
What do you mean?
Because the reason why they're actually,

608
00:34:20.241 --> 00:34:24.020
I'm going to come clean.
Okay.
We've never had you there.
Well,

609
00:34:24.021 --> 00:34:27.470
the first couple of years,
no,
you've never been there?
No,
no.

610
00:34:27.471 --> 00:34:29.960
I'm saying the first couple of years you said,
hey come.
I said,

611
00:34:29.961 --> 00:34:34.100
I don't think I got to know you better.
I told you.
And then we had a talk.

612
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.700
We embarked on it.
We're like,
no,
listen,
we love Shea.

613
00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:40.360
But that year we bring Shay is the year we get kicked out.
Yeah.

614
00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.590
And the first quarter,
and I emit,

615
00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:46.850
I told you guys that I even told far lane I go bar in it.
And if you,

616
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.320
if I come and I'm surgery in at 10,
oh it's done 10.

617
00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:56.240
So we say we get on,
it starts,
how the fuck do you even go to the game?

618
00:34:56.241 --> 00:35:00.080
I'm always blown away.
I literally drink,
pass out,

619
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:03.920
wake up with a hangover and recover before the game even starts.

620
00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.590
I still can't believe its Sunday.
That's amazing.

621
00:35:06.591 --> 00:35:11.360
I always fall asleep on when lie had light.
Always make some fucking insane.
Uh,

622
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:15.080
like for the,
for the main course,
I never make it to the main course.

623
00:35:15.081 --> 00:35:17.600
I always wake up,
I always wake up.
It's already over.
I mean,

624
00:35:17.601 --> 00:35:18.780
one year I was so shit face.

625
00:35:18.781 --> 00:35:21.890
I actually had the afternoon a cigar first and then all of a sudden he brought

626
00:35:21.891 --> 00:35:24.920
over like a pork shoulder and I was smoking a cigar shifts.

627
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:30.200
I'd eat pork shoulder with my hands and occasionally I would look up and see

628
00:35:30.201 --> 00:35:33.920
families walking by with children.
Oh my gosh.
It's just like,
wow man.

629
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:37.780
I remember going to Sullivan Stadium back in the day and seeing like me.

630
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:42.060
That's amazing.
Oh real quick.
So I got wasted and define yourself by,

631
00:35:42.061 --> 00:35:45.820
what are you drinking?
Jameson soda all the time.
James and soda.

632
00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:49.640
And she's in the room.
The bed still made,
right?
Oh No,
no.

633
00:35:49.641 --> 00:35:54.010
I'll come back and seeing the Cabana Cabana.
That's like a man with no shirt,

634
00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:58.420
just shorts,
no shoes,
a hat and just a drink of my left hand.

635
00:35:58.421 --> 00:36:02.320
And then there's other command and next to us was all patriots fans.

636
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:07.120
They were all like big white dude.
Oh God.
But they were great.

637
00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:11.920
They were like,
nice guys.
Cause I,
I became the loud one.
Obviously I became nuts.

638
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:15.040
So there's one guy who was like this big fat white dude,
the beer.

639
00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:18.340
Every time you walk by the table go pass.
I go,
Eh,

640
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:23.620
I couldn't even speak.
I was just so like angry.
I'm like,
Eh.

641
00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.340
So at the end of it,
well he's bringing a coat.
Yeah,
I know he's been a cop,

642
00:36:27.341 --> 00:36:30.250
but he actually came up with fat white country.
Yes,
exactly.

643
00:36:30.251 --> 00:36:33.340
But he came over and he was really cool.

644
00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:37.570
He shook my hand and congratulated me.
But by the end of the game,
dude,

645
00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:42.100
I lost it.
I sort of thought the flip it over the lounge chairs.
Oh God.
Yeah.

646
00:36:42.101 --> 00:36:46.150
You know why?
Cause I was just fucking excited.
That's,
that's how I get.

647
00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.520
So I just started flipping over.

648
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.870
<v 1>Do you think that that eagles fans are really that bad or the rep was there,</v>

649
00:36:51.871 --> 00:36:54.480
so now they just try to find the guy eating horse shit.

650
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:57.480
You gotta Admit Horse Shit's pretty big.
Oh fuck.

651
00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:00.350
<v 0>Wars fans are bad.
The whole life.</v>

652
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:05.310
<v 1>Eagles fans are pedestrian compared to out here.
Fucking,</v>

653
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:10.280
you can get killed out here.
A guy got killed at a Dodgers game,
dude.
He goes by,

654
00:37:10.281 --> 00:37:12.430
they'll throw full beers at year,
they've dump went over your head.

655
00:37:12.431 --> 00:37:16.060
You want to get to a fist fight.
They'll do that.
They'll eat to farm animals.

656
00:37:16.061 --> 00:37:20.590
Shit evidently stab at a Raiders preseason game like Raiders 40.

657
00:37:20.591 --> 00:37:21.490
Niners fuck cares.

658
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:25.000
<v 0>I'm so sick of the fucking snow balls Santa,</v>

659
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:25.860
<v 1>you know,</v>

660
00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.700
when it was making fun of who gives up anytime you guys are in a big game,

661
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.840
like the,
the big cheesy thing.
Whenever Boston is in a big game,
uh,

662
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:36.170
what they talk about is they'll talk about,
um,
you know,

663
00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.590
they'll show like fucking the Paul revere statue or something in the north end.

664
00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:43.130
All this shit that nobody from Boston ever went to unless you went on some field

665
00:37:43.131 --> 00:37:43.680
trip that you've,

666
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.770
that would probably psyched as a kid because you didn't have to go to school.

667
00:37:45.771 --> 00:37:50.771
The freedom trail and the foliage and fucking some lobster fishermen tightness,

668
00:37:51.141 --> 00:37:54.620
sailors not,
I don't even know why.
I didn't even know what they do.
You guys,

669
00:37:54.621 --> 00:37:57.600
it's always God.
You know what it is?
What is it?

670
00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:02.720
Rocky Statue Philly.
She's dating.
Yes.
I'm like,

671
00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:06.790
did you just say [inaudible] is a fucking Tyler,
go to Philly.

672
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.300
Next time I go to Philly,

673
00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:12.650
I'm going going on one of those fucking cheese steak places.
I want to say this.

674
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:15.520
Hello.
I would like a Philadelphia cream,
uh,

675
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:20.060
Phyllis Philadelphia cheese steak sandwich with peppers and onions and provolone

676
00:38:20.061 --> 00:38:21.080
cheese.
Please.

677
00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.420
I'm so sick of them telling me how to ideally a Wiz with,

678
00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:29.390
I'm not saying that his so soup.
I have legal tender.

679
00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.380
Make me a fucking set a trap.

680
00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:35.020
It's the only city that's like the Hoe and Boston.

681
00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:38.860
You want some clam chowder and you got to go so stupid.
I'm like,
I don't care.

682
00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.750
I love Philly cheese steaks.
I'm from Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania.
I love,

683
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.970
but I don't love him enough to say this is what I'm about.

684
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:49.390
I'm not a fucking Hoagie.
Can I tell you something to do?
Oh God,

685
00:38:49.391 --> 00:38:52.110
I hate clam chowder.
Clam chowder tastes like it was in,

686
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:55.690
you know what it tastes like.
Fixtures.
Nobody's,
you know what I just said?
Shit.

687
00:38:55.691 --> 00:38:56.471
That cow's chew.

688
00:38:56.471 --> 00:38:59.830
When are they in between their three stomachs and they just a yak and a bolt.

689
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:03.480
That's what the fuck it tastes like.
You took it to another level.
Uh,

690
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.590
I liked clam chowder.
Fish just fishes to me.

691
00:39:05.591 --> 00:39:10.390
It still seems like it'd be clear or else across every part of the ocean would

692
00:39:10.391 --> 00:39:14.890
be foggy
there.
Exit clear.

693
00:39:14.891 --> 00:39:19.360
They got clear.
I like,
I like clam chowder and I don't even like Milky Shit.

694
00:39:19.361 --> 00:39:23.800
I'm like lactose intolerant.
I liked clam chowder,
but it's not a big deal.

695
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:27.010
Like Philly cheese steaks out.
It's just so fucking nuts.

696
00:39:27.011 --> 00:39:31.830
And they show it cooking like then cooking it or cut of meat.
I actually been,

697
00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:35.080
I liked,
I really liked cheese steaks,
but uh,

698
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:40.300
I just hate that whole fucking thing.
You got to say it this way now.
I don't,
I,

699
00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:43.400
I haven't played Philly's so fucking long.
I don't,
I don't,

700
00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:47.250
I never eaten at any of those places.
All right.
Yeah,
I stay away from it.

701
00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.010
I gotta I tell you something.
I had a fucking,
you know,

702
00:39:49.011 --> 00:39:52.270
when I look at this old truck,
so I listen to fucking am radio.

703
00:39:52.271 --> 00:39:54.490
So it's just either sports talk,
uh,

704
00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:59.590
somebody's speaking some sort of Korean or like political shit,
right wing stuff.

705
00:39:59.591 --> 00:40:03.040
So I'm listening to sports talk and they were talking about that,

706
00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:06.250
whatever that fucking,
whatever our coordinator's name is Josh or some shit.

707
00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:10.300
He interviewed annuals.
Yeah,
I interviewed for the colts job.
Oh,
all of that.

708
00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.570
All of that shit.
And then he walks away the last second and then,

709
00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:16.680
then they're talking about it and this one guy's going like it,
you know,

710
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.860
there's not nothing illegal bar.
Oh,
I don't like the way it went down,
but blah,

711
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:24.170
blah.
And this other guy on the show,
he goes,
this is just indicative of a,

712
00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:28.180
the Patriots,
once again,
bending the rules.
It's like,

713
00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:30.050
you've gotta be shitting me.
It's like they'll,

714
00:40:30.051 --> 00:40:33.430
the level that people didn't pay attention to deflate gate.

715
00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:37.330
It's like what that guy did to us,
if that's all we do.
Back to,

716
00:40:37.331 --> 00:40:39.970
let's just say that was a conspiracy.
Okay,
Josh,

717
00:40:39.971 --> 00:40:43.030
you're going to go in there and even though we're preparing for the Superbowl,

718
00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:44.320
fuck all of that,

719
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:46.990
we're going to have this big conspiracy and we're going to just waste it.

720
00:40:46.991 --> 00:40:49.870
Fuck a time if that's all we did to them,

721
00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:54.640
he got off easy because this a million dollars and to draft picks over some

722
00:40:54.641 --> 00:40:59.590
bullshit.
Ah,
you guys deserve that.
Why I'm fucking with you.
Yeah.
All right.

723
00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:02.200
But here's the thing,
uh,
with the hope and you had a point,

724
00:41:02.201 --> 00:41:05.920
I could actually become the piece I my favorite thing,
but cherry on top,

725
00:41:05.921 --> 00:41:06.491
that story,

726
00:41:06.491 --> 00:41:10.390
the Cherry on top of that story is not that the fucking idiot found deflated

727
00:41:10.391 --> 00:41:11.770
balls on the cold side too.

728
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:15.100
It's that the fucking guy in the colts that caught the ball,

729
00:41:15.101 --> 00:41:19.570
the initial one that started all that bullshit.
Electric plus this.
Yeah.
That guy.

730
00:41:19.571 --> 00:41:20.540
You know what he did in the next year,

731
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:25.240
the two years within that he tested positive for steroids where it was ESPN.

732
00:41:25.241 --> 00:41:28.240
There you,
you still are mad.

733
00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:33.070
You won the Superbowl that year like that.
No,
he didn't.
He did.
He days.

734
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:36.670
Remember we did it for four years,

735
00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:40.830
was talking about the suspension or placate happened and then that.

736
00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:44.570
Then the next year,
like he got his fucking suspended.
Then they went to court,

737
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.790
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
and then it got up there and then he got fucking suspect.

738
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:51.080
He got laughed out of court.
The judge was mad.
You're wasting a fucking time.

739
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.800
Then the NFL was butthurt that we beat them and then they fucking come back and

740
00:41:54.801 --> 00:41:56.840
they guard is the NFL Corporation?
Yes.

741
00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:00.230
Is Tom Brady employee does a corporational right to suspend an employee.

742
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:03.590
That's how they spend and they find a loophole.
Thani got suspended.

743
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.200
It was like three years of shit.
Fair enough.

744
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:10.160
But we wasted fucking a week of that guy's life and fucked him over with season.

745
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:14.240
Fuck that guy.
All right.
Fair enough.
I don't like to cook.
I don't like to colts.

746
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:19.220
I agree with you,
but you got to soup.
I don't mind.
Cold fans will fans.

747
00:42:19.221 --> 00:42:20.470
I don't really,
do we want to work?

748
00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:25.090
Can we would've got the fucking Superbowl anyways.
Yeah,
we know.

749
00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:25.953
We did do

750
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:30.710
and then the 49 is when it had to spend all that money on.

751
00:42:30.711 --> 00:42:34.580
A guy was played five games.
Oh,
Groppe.

752
00:42:34.581 --> 00:42:39.320
Hello Jesus Christ.
That,
what are they doing?
What's going to be good?
You know,

753
00:42:39.321 --> 00:42:42.970
he's going to be good.
Grew up alone to okay.
He,
he's,
he,

754
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:45.850
he looks like he's going to be God dude,
this Benz,

755
00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.380
I'm not saying he's not going to be good,
but dude,

756
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.800
that guy's making more money than like Aaron Rodgers.

757
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.870
I,
I,
you know what,
I do disagree with you.

758
00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:00.950
Tom Brady would not have played as well if he does get suspended those first

759
00:43:00.951 --> 00:43:05.120
four games two years ago.
I listen,
I will say this,

760
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:10.180
I liked,
uh,
39,
four year old guy getting four games off.
He,
I like,

761
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:13.010
that's great,
but I don't think it added any more.
He,
he,
it,

762
00:43:13.011 --> 00:43:15.230
he's like psycho driven.
Anyways.

763
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:18.380
My only thing about him is I don't want him to go out like Brett Farve.

764
00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:23.120
I don't cause this whole fucking thing,
Tom versus time.
If he plays these 45,

765
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:25.160
you know,
as long as he's still competitive,

766
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:28.340
I just don't want to see him like on the rams,

767
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:32.430
like Joe Nemeth fucking Johnny Unitas wearing a fucking charges uniform.

768
00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.970
He's too proud.
He won't,
I hope he doesn't do that.

769
00:43:34.971 --> 00:43:38.900
Why the fuck is he doing this weird reality show?
I don't get it.
What is,

770
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:41.420
what is it?
I'm not going to pay attention to it,

771
00:43:41.421 --> 00:43:45.550
but that makes me fucking nervous because he never did shit man.

772
00:43:45.551 --> 00:43:49.400
He did like 400 commercials a year.
I thought that helped us.
Yeah,

773
00:43:49.401 --> 00:43:51.620
because painting is kind of like to every guy,

774
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:53.960
like he comes off like a dumb farmer.

775
00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:57.950
I mean people like that and the fucking Midwest.
I fucking hate can't,

776
00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:02.990
I don't like to cults in general.
I don't have to beat the chargers.

777
00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.410
That's what I would have sunk.
Somebody has speak today like,
hey,
you know,

778
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:10.670
where does,
uh,
where does it,
this is just going to be all football talk.

779
00:44:10.671 --> 00:44:13.910
Where does,
where does,
uh,
you know,

780
00:44:13.911 --> 00:44:16.150
Tom Brady having the greatest coach of all time in the,

781
00:44:16.151 --> 00:44:21.070
in the brief versus Peyton manning argument.
And that's a fair point.
But,
um,

782
00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:24.350
I be honest with you.
I actually liked Eli.

783
00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:29.390
I would rather have had eli in January.
Yeah.
Eli's a better,

784
00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:32.090
uh,
play off quarterback Eli.

785
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:37.380
His breath stink in September,
October.
But then when,
you know,

786
00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:41.910
I need him to turn it off.
Turns it on.
Dan Marino.
Wouldn't you say paid man?

787
00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:45.840
He's the greatest regular season quarterback of all time.
Uh,
first of all,

788
00:44:45.841 --> 00:44:49.620
Dan Marino gets an unbelievable bad rap.
Okay.

789
00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.260
Peyton manning was part of a three headed fucking monster.

790
00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:56.270
All one that said will no just by Edgerrin James and,
and,
and,

791
00:44:56.271 --> 00:44:59.790
and what's his face there?
Wide Receiver.
Just forgot his fucking name.
Marvin.

792
00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:02.680
Marvin Harrison.
Well,
I never had his football card,
so I'll never remember.

793
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:07.740
All right.
Shot two people.
No,
he didn't.
He,
he allegedly,
allegedly,

794
00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:09.830
allegedly let you think.
Well,
maybe the,

795
00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:14.460
maybe the eight is horseshit and he was upset.
Um,
they fucking,

796
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:19.860
Dan Marino had no running game and no defense.
Yes.
Great.
His entire career.

797
00:45:19.861 --> 00:45:22.050
What was he supposed to do?
I'll tell you about Tom.

798
00:45:22.051 --> 00:45:27.051
Brady would not have won a fucking super bowl with with fucking and Don Shula.

799
00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:29.960
Everybody stole all his tricks.
By the time the two devil,

800
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:34.170
Rita would've thrown easily per 6,000 yards in today's NFL.
Well,

801
00:45:34.171 --> 00:45:38.730
today's NFL.
Do you like it now?
No,
I don't like it.

802
00:45:38.731 --> 00:45:43.731
They went too far and when I'm liking about watching these first Superbowls is I

803
00:45:45.031 --> 00:45:49.290
like more the running.
I liked the diff defenses,
had nicknames and stuff.
It was,

804
00:45:49.291 --> 00:45:53.790
it was a meaner game and it was a more strategic game.

805
00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:55.130
And to Paul verse,

806
00:45:55.131 --> 00:45:59.430
he said the funniest fucking shit about that Eagle's patriots super Superbowl.

807
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.350
He's like,
dude,
he goes,
that's the kind.

808
00:46:01.351 --> 00:46:04.410
That's the kind of game you're girlfriend likes that.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

809
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:07.200
Like if soccer had that much storing,
I'd be like,
dude,

810
00:46:07.201 --> 00:46:10.200
that was a great fucking gay.
All those English guys who'd be like,
well,

811
00:46:10.201 --> 00:46:11.330
I made it fucking by the day,

812
00:46:11.331 --> 00:46:13.890
but they would be able to break down the game as to why suck.

813
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.710
Everyone keeps telling me what a great game.
Congratulations.

814
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:20.390
I'm happy because the Eagles won.
I'm happy.
But it wasn't.

815
00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:22.470
It was a shit show was a great game though.

816
00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:26.010
Fucking defects that I said it was viewer friendly.
Yeah,

817
00:46:26.011 --> 00:46:30.690
it went and I have to be honest with you,
that is all those rule changes.

818
00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:34.110
I always blame to Marissa cause I'm a con,
but it's all of them.

819
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.140
It's because they're trying to expand the game and you know that they've done

820
00:46:37.141 --> 00:46:40.230
studies and you know that offense sells the game.

821
00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:44.070
That's why I think MLB looked the other way when everyone was all roided up and

822
00:46:44.071 --> 00:46:47.940
they actually asked surprise.
All the owners get to act surprised.
Like,

823
00:46:47.941 --> 00:46:52.440
oh we had no fucking idea.
I really like,
we don't know the comic set up partying.

824
00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:56.010
The MLP doesn't pay.
The guy had zillion dollars a fucking year.

825
00:46:56.011 --> 00:47:00.120
You don't know what he's doing.
Um,
but the NBA,
but that game was fucked.

826
00:47:00.121 --> 00:47:02.800
That that when they had the strike and they didn't have the world series and all

827
00:47:02.801 --> 00:47:05.850
of that shit,
they needed something to come back.
By the way,

828
00:47:05.851 --> 00:47:09.180
that was a fucking awesome year though.
It was like,
it was fucking,
it was,

829
00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.720
it was fucking amazing.
I remember Washington College,
every lunch,

830
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:13.800
every year in the cafeteria,

831
00:47:13.801 --> 00:47:17.880
we'd watch the fucking highlights like who I went to.
Like I never,

832
00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:22.940
I went to the same one when Mark Mcgwire hit his 27th or 28th home run.

833
00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:28.340
It was down in San Diego and they're still playing at Qualcomm stadium as a
chef.

834
00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:31.800
I went there with this comic Dan Smith that we sat in the upper deck and when

835
00:47:31.801 --> 00:47:36.070
fucking Maguire do,
but the place was packed for his,
uh,
for his,

836
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.620
when he would take batting practice and the whole place,

837
00:47:38.621 --> 00:47:41.590
he came up to the plate for batting practice,
standing ovation.

838
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.470
It was like three quarters for batting practice.

839
00:47:44.471 --> 00:47:47.320
Everybody's going nuts and it's the funniest shit ever.
The first pitch in,

840
00:47:47.321 --> 00:47:52.321
he laid down a bunt and everybody booed and then he laughed and everybody

841
00:47:52.481 --> 00:47:55.330
laughed because it was kind of a cool way to get rid of the stress.
It let me,

842
00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:56.890
I got to read a couple of,
uh,

843
00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:01.570
advertisements here and then I want to talk about what's going on with
mailboxes.

844
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.620
I'm going to talk to you about it.
All right.
The Black Tux.
Everybody.
Kevin.

845
00:48:05.621 --> 00:48:10.120
This is the black Tux.
The like the Ohio state.
You heard Greg Wilson,

846
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:14.440
the Greg Wilson.
I love the Greg Wilson.
He's a nut bag.
Yeah,
he's the best.

847
00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:15.580
Uh,

848
00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:20.260
everyone wants to look as great as their date at a wedding or special event.

849
00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.290
Now they're talking about wearing a dress.
Trouble is,

850
00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:25.960
there's no way you want to spend the amount of time or money.
She's,

851
00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:29.200
she did shopping for outfit.
I can't read out loud.

873
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:52.330
You Iceberg.
Here's another one.
Here's a note.

874
00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:57.190
Simply safe.
I know this,
I've got some exciting news.

875
00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:02.240
Simply safe home security company I've worked with since there we,

876
00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:07.430
they were a startup.
Who the fuck was this for?
Um,

877
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:11.410
I've watched them transform into that.
Why do they do this?
Okay,
look,

878
00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:15.670
they've transformed into the fastest growing home security company in the nation

879
00:50:15.671 --> 00:50:19.930
protecting over 2 million people while they just released their brand new home

880
00:50:19.931 --> 00:50:23.970
security system.
The all new,
simply safe.
Now this is the shit I'm into.

881
00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:26.140
You got to have a home security system at this point,
right?

882
00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:29.870
I don't understand what they do.
You don't understand what they do.
Well,

883
00:50:29.871 --> 00:50:33.170
I'm glad you asked.
You'd be great on an infomercial.

884
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:39.470
Wait a minute,
but does the AEC stick to the pan?
Of course not.
Just watch,
Kevin.

885
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:42.680
This system has been completely,
completely rebuilt and redesign.

886
00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:47.630
They've added new safeguards to protect against power outages,
down Wifi,

887
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:50.510
cut land lines,
bats,
hammers,
and everything in between.

888
00:50:50.511 --> 00:50:53.010
You remember the end of Scarface?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You know,

889
00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:54.470
he wasn't doing all that blow.

890
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:58.480
That was a simply safe system and they saw all those fucking people come on over

891
00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:03.020
the wall.
But Tony was too busy partying all night.
What do you want the fuck me,

892
00:51:03.021 --> 00:51:04.490
Tony.
The all new,

893
00:51:04.491 --> 00:51:08.600
simply safe was redesigned to be practically invisible with the powerful sensors

894
00:51:08.601 --> 00:51:12.350
so small.
You'll hardly notice them.
You know who will intruders.

895
00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:15.080
This is what truly remarkable to me.

896
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:18.440
Evidently simply safe spent years building the system.

897
00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:20.330
They added so much more.

898
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:23.960
How weird was that fucking scene that that poor actress had to play?

899
00:51:23.961 --> 00:51:26.000
You want to fuck me,
Tony?
That was hot.

900
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:29.500
Now I know why you have a private computer from the porn,

901
00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:32.810
but you will still get the same fair,
honest price.

902
00:51:32.811 --> 00:51:37.340
24 seven protection for only 15 bucks a month and there's no contract.

903
00:51:37.341 --> 00:51:40.220
It's smaller,
faster and stronger than anything they've built before,

904
00:51:40.221 --> 00:51:42.170
but it's the supply is very limited.

And do you use like your banking online?
Yeah.
Do you not do that?
No.
Do you?

944
00:53:56.421 --> 00:54:01.320
You do not fucking mail checks all the time.

945
00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:05.010
No.
Do you know,
do so you need so that way we're holding.

946
00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:08.480
I'm one of the last ones because one's going to say is no fucking this starting

947
00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:11.910
to get rid of mailboxes.
They're starting to weld them shut.
You go up to one,

948
00:54:11.911 --> 00:54:16.480
you're like,
oh good and then you can't get it in there.
What?
Yeah,

949
00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:19.620
they're going away like remember those,
those,
those phone boosts,

950
00:54:19.621 --> 00:54:21.810
the big red phone booths that they had an England.
Yes.

951
00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:25.140
And now for some reason they sold all of them over here because we're weird and

952
00:54:25.141 --> 00:54:27.870
we want to so they turn those in a new mailboxes I think.

953
00:54:27.871 --> 00:54:30.540
I think a bunch of people in England are going to buy an old post office boxes

954
00:54:30.541 --> 00:54:33.720
and so much as they come in their man caves so and just bought the La Times.

955
00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:38.280
So how the fuck are we going to get the La Times if there's mailboxes don't
work.

956
00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:45.120
Don't you have a paper boy?
One of his no paperwork was there.
I do see,

957
00:54:45.121 --> 00:54:49.290
I see a Mexican moms driving their kids around in the mornings when I wake up in

958
00:54:49.291 --> 00:54:51.900
the mornings and they fill their fucking paper.
God bless him.

959
00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:55.920
And my dad used to do this with us.
That's why I have the work at [inaudible].

960
00:54:55.940 --> 00:55:00.380
I had,
I had a paper from third grade until the point it got weird.
Yeah,

961
00:55:00.381 --> 00:55:02.910
you got my voice was starting to change.
I couldn't walk away from the money.

962
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:05.450
All my friends were always broke.
I do.

963
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:10.440
They had no overhead football cards and candy where my biggest fucking
expensive.

964
00:55:10.441 --> 00:55:13.490
So that was it.
I wouldn't life be great if we could just go.

965
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:16.080
You still ride my bike up to the bowling alley.
Go Bowling.

966
00:55:16.081 --> 00:55:19.730
I paid for the whole fucking thing.
No.
Yeah.

967
00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:23.220
Never had to go to my parent Haney and any key me couple of bucks,
man.

968
00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:26.630
Never had to do that.
I was fucking independent.
You go and bill,

969
00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:29.040
I got on a bike ride.
All right.
Get the fuck Outta here.

970
00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:31.320
They didn't give a shit and we were,
we were born and you were,

971
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:34.830
but you were exhausted at score guarantee.
I wasn't,
ah,

972
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.020
you were up at like four in the morning.
I rode a bike.

973
00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:40.920
I didn't go boozing as I was a kid.
My,
but my body was brand new.

974
00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:45.140
All right.
Premiere League football.
People write in,

975
00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:47.190
they ask questions and all this shit.
All right.
Oh Nice.

976
00:55:47.191 --> 00:55:51.870
I like this premier league football.
Um,
the premier league,

977
00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:55.080
if I swear to God,
a level of excitement.
Like whenever I put these games on,

978
00:55:55.081 --> 00:55:57.060
every time when I watch him,
like,
you know,
they love it.

979
00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:00.060
I can get into it and it's always that.
It's always like nighttime and shit.

980
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:01.920
Now it makes you want to Bose.
You wish it was cold.

981
00:56:01.921 --> 00:56:03.480
I you stuck on half and hang up.
I kinda,

982
00:56:03.481 --> 00:56:08.010
my scarf is as I started singing some songs.
I hate to be the coach,
say American,

983
00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:11.880
but I don't want to get soccer.
Um,
sir,

984
00:56:11.881 --> 00:56:13.710
William of Albino.
Phil,

985
00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:19.760
that was actually for you.
It's a great one.
They usually just go,
hey Billy,

986
00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:23.030
read Ted.
Say You freckled con.
You know,
it's the usual.
I'd like that sir.
What?

987
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:28.060
My Bell Vinyl Ville.
Um,
that's almost begging for a picture.

988
00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:29.830
I think I got to dress up in a regal way.

989
00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:35.190
I got to make sure we wrap this up because I'm going to go see a Todd rhexis.

990
00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:38.410
He wrecks and he sold out both of his shows over,
sold them.

991
00:56:38.411 --> 00:56:41.080
So thank you to everybody.
Listened to Todd on this show and bought a ticket.

992
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.681
All right.

993
00:56:41.681 --> 00:56:45.730
There is only one team you can support in the English premier league and that is

994
00:56:45.731 --> 00:56:49.360
Liverpool.
It.
And I'm just going to pause and wait for everybody in England list.

995
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:52.270
Oh fuck.
Fucking kinds.
Beatle mania.

996
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:57.130
It is deeply working class with a long Irish history.
All right.
I'm in.

997
00:56:57.550 --> 00:56:59.920
The city itself doesn't consider itself English,

998
00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:03.970
but a separate entity from the rest of the country.
I'll grow the fuck up.

999
00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:06.670
What are you,
the south,
you're going to secede from the union.

1000
00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:11.500
Liverpool football club is currently owned by Fenway sports group,
La.

1001
00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:13.420
That's the red sox.
That's it.
Yeah.

1002
00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:17.770
Up until recently we were the most successful team in England,

1003
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:18.821
but a barren,

1004
00:57:18.821 --> 00:57:23.200
spelled due to tragedy and mismanagement finally seems to be coming to an end,

1005
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:27.540
much like the red sox during they're winless run.
Um,

1006
00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:31.450
so why the fuck do I want to jump on the bandwagon now we have the most exciting

1007
00:57:31.451 --> 00:57:35.440
attacking line in the league,
possibly Europe.
Our manager is an utter lunatic,

1008
00:57:35.441 --> 00:57:40.060
a very rich history.
Okay.
I'm kind of in right now.
Not all of it is good.
Uh,

1009
00:57:40.061 --> 00:57:43.300
including 18 league titles and five European cups.

1010
00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:45.850
The best team in the whole of Europe is European Cup.

1011
00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:49.840
We've been targeted by the press,
the media,
and even the government.
Oh,

1012
00:57:49.841 --> 00:57:53.440
this is like the Patriots.
Let us see.
I'm a fucking Liverpool Fan.

1013
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:58.210
This isn't a franchise bill.
Once you pick your team or once your team picks you,

1014
00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:00.340
that's it for life.
No changing,

1015
00:58:00.341 --> 00:58:04.750
no moving cities through good and bad up the reds,
Billy boy.

1016
00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:08.710
Hey,
I don't switch.
Teams don't even fucking suggests that I do that.

1017
00:58:08.711 --> 00:58:10.360
You fucking cunt.
Quite a,
yeah.

1018
00:58:10.530 --> 00:58:13.000
I was going to pick Liverpool just cause I liked the Beatles.

1019
00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:15.550
He was just trying to get you to switch to Liverpool,

1020
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:20.710
my favorite Beatle song of all time.
Uh,
we,
we uh,

1021
00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:25.350
isn't that them?
Uh,
we,
we uh,
the beet hoes.

1022
00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:29.890
All right views.
Do you get into soccer at all?
A little bit.
Well,
a little bit.

1023
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.880
World Cup,
World Cup,
World Cups,
kind of fun.
Except that one year,

1024
00:58:33.881 --> 00:58:37.340
that one year in Africa when they had us fucking horns.

1025
00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.870
What were those things?
Ah,
I don't know.

1026
00:58:40.871 --> 00:58:44.500
I didn't watch much of that instrument if like a Kazoo fucked a bagpipe

1027
00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:52.600
and Yoko ono played it right.
Uh,
views on public speaking fees.

1028
00:58:52.601 --> 00:58:53.350
Hey Bill,

1029
00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:57.720
longtime fan and listener and I always enjoy your point of view on things that

1030
00:58:57.730 --> 00:58:59.770
he just went straight ahead.
Yeah,
there you go.
Anyways,

1031
00:58:59.771 --> 00:59:01.540
was listening to the most recent,
uh,

1032
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:04.600
Monday morning podcast and I was surprised to hear your point of view on

1033
00:59:04.601 --> 00:59:09.601
speaking fees considering that you are in essence a public speaker.

1034
00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:15.240
I guess that you have some understanding how much more money this is relative to

1035
00:59:15.821 --> 00:59:17.230
other named acts.

1036
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:21.860
I would be curious to see how much money other famous people get to talk if you

1037
00:59:21.861 --> 00:59:26.060
knew those without naming names.
Apparently Obama gets 400 grand per speech.

1038
00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:31.760
Uh,
no,
I'm not a public speaker.
I'm a con.
I'm a comedian.
Yeah.
Uh,
you know,
I mean,

1039
00:59:31.761 --> 00:59:35.270
at that point,
like somebody going like,
Eh,
you know,
extracts.
Damn.

1040
00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:39.200
You know about it.
I don't like the ones who like,
like motivational speakers.

1041
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:44.150
Yeah.
There's a reason that someone's called a public speaker.
What do you mean?

1042
00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.910
Well,
because they're boring and they're not funny.
You're called the community.

1043
00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:51.920
We're actually entertaining.
It's like Ted talk.
Yeah,
no,

1044
00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:54.350
my problem that I had with these guys,
say like Obama,

1045
00:59:54.351 --> 00:59:58.130
where everybody's looking at this guy like he's a fucking saint is he's doing

1046
00:59:58.131 --> 01:00:01.100
what all of these guys do.
They all go into public office.

1047
01:00:01.101 --> 01:00:02.900
They say they're there for the people.
And by the,

1048
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:04.430
by the end of his administration,

1049
01:00:04.431 --> 01:00:08.420
he was already worth $80 million when he was making like four,
500 grand a year.

1050
01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:13.220
But she can make some,
everyone wants to make money.
No.
Oh yeah.
But I mean,

1051
01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:16.900
they,
they,
they should give the president fuck you money.
I'm not obsessed.

1052
01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:21.620
It's the fact that I don't have the money to be like,
Hey Obama,

1053
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:24.140
when you know a Trump,
when you get novelists,
uh,

1054
01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.890
make sure that comedy club always has fresh Calamari,

1055
01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.500
his fucking 10 million bucks.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Like they do,

1056
01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.200
except they do it or not fucking global level.

1057
01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:36.790
Is he asking how much performers get paid?
I don't know what he's,

1058
01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:38.960
I don't know what the fuck is asking.
On the flip side,

1059
01:00:38.961 --> 01:00:43.430
should we even care how much money they get after they're out of office,
sir?

1060
01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:47.600
Yes.
Oh,
you have to do,
how does the president get into office?

1061
01:00:47.601 --> 01:00:49.310
How does he afford to get into office?

1062
01:00:49.311 --> 01:00:52.520
He needs people to make campaign donations.
All right.

1063
01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:56.430
And when these fucking rich people make the donations and then after we're,

1064
01:00:56.431 --> 01:00:58.970
after they're done and he does everything that they want to,

1065
01:00:58.971 --> 01:01:02.930
then they go on the tour.
That's them washing their bribe money.
Hey,

1066
01:01:02.931 --> 01:01:06.370
I'm going to give you a 400 grand to give an hour long speech there.

1067
01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:11.360
The whole spill.
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
it's so fucking out.
That's what it is.
I'm not,

1068
01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:15.860
I'm not upset that this guy,
I'm not upset that anyone can go out and make money.

1069
01:01:15.861 --> 01:01:18.650
It's just the fact that you've got these guys,

1070
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:23.240
they need $100 million to get a job that pays for 500 grand a year.

1071
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.690
And before the g they're making 500 grand a year.
And by the end of it,
they are,

1072
01:01:26.691 --> 01:01:29.570
they're already worth like 80 million bucks.
Like,
how the fuck did that happen?

1073
01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.340
Does that happen?
How does that happen?

1074
01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:35.330
The someone should get to the bottom of how the fuck does that happen because

1075
01:01:35.331 --> 01:01:38.750
it's all fucking corrupt.
Um,
that's my problem sir.

1076
01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:42.050
And I think they'd be the only true,
like really decent,

1077
01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.650
like truly public servant that I've seen as a,

1078
01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.290
as a president in my lifetime was Jimmy Carter.

1079
01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:51.470
I'm not saying he didn't go out and do public speeches.

1080
01:01:51.471 --> 01:01:54.500
I didn't even look up to that.
But the guy has spent his fucking,

1081
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:59.270
his golden years where he could just be sitting there painting like fucking,
uh,

1082
01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:03.650
George Bush.
You know,
he can be out there tagging broads like Clinton,

1083
01:02:03.651 --> 01:02:06.430
he's he phase fucking building and he's for the home.

1084
01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:11.390
The shaking hands on an airplane too.
He's a fucking great dude.
Is that the guy?

1085
01:02:11.391 --> 01:02:14.730
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know what's funny?
You know it's funny.
He was the most human,

1086
01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:17.300
you most humane guy I've seen and,
and,

1087
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:20.340
and he was considered to an absolute pussy,

1088
01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:24.570
but we know that's the truth.
That's how it works.

1089
01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:28.260
You can't be nice and not be considered a positive.
You can be,
you could be that.

1090
01:02:28.261 --> 01:02:30.570
You can be a decent can be.
Decent thing about it is,

1091
01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:34.890
is he was nice enough when that whole fucking around shit what your hostage is

1092
01:02:34.891 --> 01:02:38.160
went down.
He settled that without getting dragged into a war.

1093
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:41.790
So it was considered a pussy because big business could have gone in there and

1094
01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:44.100
made that money,
you know?
Yeah.

1095
01:02:44.101 --> 01:02:47.550
That's kind of not have to wait for another event to go in there and try to get

1096
01:02:47.551 --> 01:02:52.260
a bunch of fucking oil.
Alright.
Cheating with a boyfriend.
Yeah.
He's,

1097
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:56.280
here we go.
Uh,

1098

It's cold so we fuck no,

1099
01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:02.780
That's making fun of my last name.
Oh,

1100
01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:06.540
That takes me back to like grade school.
All right.

1107
01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:33.990
Oh Shit.
Um,

but that's a,

1108
01:03:33.991 --> 01:03:38.250

1111
01:03:46.021 --> 01:03:50.800

1112
01:03:50.810 --> 01:03:54.650
Dot.
TVS and go down.
Check him out.
He's fucking hilarious.
All Right,

1113
01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.950
Bill,
I'm a female.
The story isn't about me.
It's about my friend.
Uh,

1114
01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.210
that's a lie.

1115
01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:07.500
I know my friend wants to fuck around on her husband were in our early twenties

1116
01:04:07.501 --> 01:04:09.030
and have been friends since high school.

1117
01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:12.090
We've always been there for each other and even though our friendship has been

1118
01:04:12.091 --> 01:04:16.230
long,
it has been long distance since then.
However,
now we have a slight problem.

1119
01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:20.790
Uh,
she's been dating a guy for a year and they've been butting heads lately.

1120
01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:24.150
One night she got high with her roommate who's a guy and they started to kiss

1121
01:04:24.151 --> 01:04:26.010
and then of course one thing led to another.

1122
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:30.180
Apparently her roommate has been having feelings for her for a long time and

1123
01:04:30.181 --> 01:04:34.860
wants to be in a relationship with her instead of just banging her.
Uh,

1124
01:04:34.861 --> 01:04:38.760
she broke up with her boyfriend using their conflicts is the reason is set of

1125
01:04:38.761 --> 01:04:42.220
saying she cheated and we've all done that.
Every lie.
Um,

1126
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:46.140
all three of them have been,
have a bunch of mutual friends,

1127
01:04:46.141 --> 01:04:48.780
so she wants to lay low.
And the fact that she cheated,

1128
01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:53.960
she also wants to give her now ex boyfriend time to heal before he finds out she

1129
01:04:54.971 --> 01:04:59.070
staying in a roommate.
This is called being a class act.
Why bring extra hurt,

1130
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:03.840
right?
Yeah.
But why not?
I mean,
at this point she's feeling guilty.

1131
01:05:03.841 --> 01:05:08.550
Just fucking say it.
That's easy to say at our age.
But when you're young,

1132
01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:11.730
when you're young.
Yeah.
Okay.
When you're younger,
you don't know how to do it.

1133
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:16.380
But she doesn't even have,
she doesn't even know that it's obviously her shoes.

1134
01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.550
Right.
Well,
let's going here.

1135
01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:20.970
I keep trying to tell her that it'd be better to come clean about what she's

1136
01:05:20.971 --> 01:05:24.540
done now than to wait it out.
I know whatever their,

1137
01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.100
whatever their gender,

1138
01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:29.250
I know people in whatever their gender have the ability to cheat.
Growing up,

1139
01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:33.240
I've seen how being cheated on has affected people around me,
including myself.

1140
01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:38.100
I never thought that she would be the person to cheat.
So my question is,

1141
01:05:39.830 --> 01:05:43.280
I had people cheat,
whatever.
And then like now she's judging her.
Uh,

1142
01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:47.400
so my question is how can I get it through her head and she needs to handle this

1143
01:05:47.401 --> 01:05:51.860
situation better,
but also be a good friend to her at the same time.
Uh,

1144
01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:54.970
if need is there and has any vice,
who would be great,
thanks.
And Go fuck off.

1145
01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:59.550
Fuck yourself a second date problem.
Oh,
this is a different one.
Um,

1146
01:05:59.970 --> 01:06:04.170
you know what?
I think you need to butt out.
Yeah.
Okay.
If we,

1147
01:06:04.171 --> 01:06:08.610
if we actually think this isn't about her,
which I don't,

1148
01:06:08.611 --> 01:06:13.560
I think it's about her and someone saying that to her.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
uh,
if it's,

1149
01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:15.000
if it's you,
if is this is actually,

1150
01:06:15.001 --> 01:06:17.160
I don't think she would've worded it that way.
I believe it.
Okay.

1151
01:06:17.161 --> 01:06:20.760
If we believe it,
it's a none of your fucking business.
You know,

1152
01:06:20.761 --> 01:06:24.690
people make mistakes.
We're all human.
You know what I mean?
So if you,

1153
01:06:24.691 --> 01:06:27.840
if you're a good,
this is the actual job.
If you're a real fucking friend,

1154
01:06:27.841 --> 01:06:31.950
you wouldn't judge her.
Can I tell you something?
Yeah.
Once you get past the pain,

1155
01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:37.260
she did you a favor.
Yeah.
Cause you know,
you weren't married,

1156
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:41.040
didn't have any fucking kids.
You didn't have a house together and all that.

1157
01:06:41.041 --> 01:06:43.890
So who gives a fuck?
And then she,
you know,
do I already butting heads?

1158
01:06:43.891 --> 01:06:44.611
They weren't getting along.

1159
01:06:44.611 --> 01:06:48.930
It was the end and there were 22 that it's already over relationship.

1160
01:06:48.931 --> 01:06:51.600
And you'd go,
fuck somebody.
I mean,
it's still like girls.

1161
01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:53.670
Do you know what that's like?
It's like an empty net goal,
you know what I mean?

1162
01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:57.380
<v 0>I mean a lot it,
but I mean,
you know,
you didn't fake out a goal.
If</v>

1163
01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:02.930
it's garbage time,
we've got all the is on the bench.
It's garbage.

1164
01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:07.780
It's garbage time.
Fucking,
you know what?
You have you ever,
that's it.

1165
01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:12.380
I've done it all.
Got found out later that I got mad.
I was just like,

1166
01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:14.210
Eh,
he's a fucking was over.

1167
01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.740
<v 1>Is it one more than that?</v>

1168
01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:20.520
Whatever time you were in a relationship as it was over a half.

1169
01:07:20.521 --> 01:07:24.060
Like if you're in four years,
it's been done for two years.
Does that make sense?

1170
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:27.540
I would say a year and a half year and a half break ups just don't happen

1171
01:07:27.541 --> 01:07:29.940
overnight.
You don't wake up like,
you know what?
I'm fucking Outta here.

1172
01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:32.610
You draw it out,
you start to get distance.

1173
01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:37.880
You start fucking Shit fucking course on how to break up in high school in high

1174
01:07:39.781 --> 01:07:43.470
school should they should teach young people that are doing it would be so much

1175
01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:45.053
better.

1176
01:07:45.090 --> 01:07:49.350
I think just so you don't fucking drag someone along or you don't get dragged

1177
01:07:49.351 --> 01:07:53.220
along.
Well,
all you had to do is you just got to sit down.

1178
01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:56.950
I've been one time I had to get out of relationship and I remember,
uh,

1179
01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:00.750
Steve Byrne had just got out of one.
This is like fucking,
you know,
years ago,

1180
01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:04.920
2025 years ago.
Right.
And,
uh,
not 25,
like 20 years ago.

1181
01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:09.090
And I literally asked him,
I was like,
what did you say?
He goes,
I just sat down.

1182
01:08:09.091 --> 01:08:12.360
It's said,
I just said I'm not happy.
That's what he started with.

1183
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:14.820
And I've given that advice on here,
cause I used that.

1184
01:08:14.821 --> 01:08:18.830
I don't think I ever told him that.
I just fucking used it.
I don't,
I,
we need to,

1185
01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:23.720
I'm just not like,
yeah,
I just,
you know,
it's,
it's just not working.

1186
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:26.990
It just doesn't feel right.
I'm not happy.
This is the thing,

1187
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:29.710
but this is the thing,
you have to get it all out.
Yep.

1188
01:08:29.810 --> 01:08:33.550
And I think we should break up and you got to like,
I think you'd just go bump,

1189
01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:35.540
bump.
It's like monkey bars,
boom,
boom,
boom.

1190
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:38.750
Get across it and then you say,

1191
01:08:38.751 --> 01:08:42.710
we got to break up and she's going to drag you through it like 50 fucking times.

1192
01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:47.060
It's like lying to the cops.
You just stick to your fucking story.
Yeah,
it's,

1193
01:08:47.130 --> 01:08:48.890
but that whole,
I'm not happy.

1194
01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:53.600
I've heard it and I've said it usually drags out for seven more months.

1195
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:57.740
No,
no,
but that's,
you know,
we're not happy.

1196
01:08:57.741 --> 01:09:02.180
It's not working out.
We need to break up.
You know?
I want to break up.

1197
01:09:02.181 --> 01:09:06.980
What the fuck it's done.
Yeah,
no,
I get it.
I get it.
But it never works that way.

1198
01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:10.190
Usually the other person is like,
no,
we can work this out.

1199
01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:12.110
Then that's when you have to go al Madrigal.

1200
01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:17.230
Well listen while you're living together.
Yeah.
If you're living together,

1201
01:09:17.231 --> 01:09:19.880
it's hard.
Then it's hard.
You're not living together.

1202
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:23.620
You have to go Al Madrigal what?
What now and now I don't have a told you that.

1203
01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.300
No,
I want to know to Alan had a breakup on time.

1204
01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:27.980
The Schick had some shit at his house.

1205
01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:31.250
He knew he was going to break up with her before we broke up.
He said,

1206
01:09:31.290 --> 01:09:32.720
he told her,
hey,
I'm going to come over tonight.

1207
01:09:32.721 --> 01:09:34.970
I think we need to talk about some things.
So she's like,
oh,
okay.

1208
01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:36.950
He fucking got a box,

1209
01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:41.960
packed all our shit up that was at his apartment,
walked over,

1210
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:45.460
set the box down and said,
we've got to break up.
It's not working,
dude.

1211
01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:49.550
It was fucking clean.
Yeah,

1212
01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:54.470
that's,
that's easy for als.
Cause als a fucking maniac.
Like he does.
He,

1213
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:58.520
when he has learned from maniacs,
no,
I love maniacs.
I've been kind of a maniac.

1214
01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:02.090
I are.
I am kind of a maintenance cycle because this cycle,

1215
01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:06.620
when it comes to breaking up,
uh,
they've never been good.
No,
it's good.

1216
01:10:06.621 --> 01:10:09.440
That's why you got to get through it.
If you live with them as harder,

1217
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:10.910
if you don't live with them,
it's easy.

1218
01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:14.900
And that's why people fucking hang in and then they start cheating and they're

1219
01:10:14.901 --> 01:10:18.560
doing all of this fucking shit because they're basically mentally broken up.

1220
01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:23.510
So that could woman there essentially didn't even like as far as like an on an

1221
01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:28.170
emotional level.
Yeah.
Didn't fucking on a physical level she cheated,

1222
01:10:28.171 --> 01:10:29.001
but on an emotional level,

1223
01:10:29.001 --> 01:10:31.970
she didn't cause she already fucking broke up with guy.
She was done.

1224
01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.660
I find that Doug,
here's one,
here's one.

1225
01:10:35.661 --> 01:10:39.470
When you know the other person was already fucking other people.
Okay.

1226
01:10:39.471 --> 01:10:43.820
When someone breaks up with you and they're not even crying like that means I

1227
01:10:43.821 --> 01:10:45.800
already cried it out with their fucking friends.

1228
01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:48.350
They got no tears left and it's just like,
wow man,

1229
01:10:48.351 --> 01:10:51.710
this is how long has this shit?
Yeah.
You know,
I've never cried at a breakup.

1230
01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:55.400
I can't.
And they get guys don't crow all,
all the Google,

1231
01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:59.510
all my ex girlfriend,
all my ex girlfriend,
his ex boyfriend,
they're like,

1232
01:10:59.511 --> 01:11:03.120
they cry,
they cry.
I was like,
cause they were fucking pussies.

1233
01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:06.340
Plus I was going to say the other words,
so I'm glad I did it,
but uh,

1234
01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.380
I would have known where,
this is how I know,

1235
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:12.260
this is how I know this is how I know when it's done,

1236
01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:14.080
when they don't kiss you goodbye.

1237
01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:18.820
<v 0>In the morning like,
cause I don't get off of work.
This is how I know it's done.</v>

1238
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.430
When when they're mad at you and you don't give a fuck.
Yeah,

1239
01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:23.353
<v 3>yeah.</v>

1240
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:25.720
<v 0>Hi.
Yeah.
You're like,
ah.</v>

1241
01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:28.500
And then they come in and they start doing the cold shoulder like,

1242
01:11:28.730 --> 01:11:31.680
and they're not fucking you.
It's just like any like good,
good,
good,

1243
01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:33.490
<v 3>Huh?</v>

1244
01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:35.020
<v 0>No,
you're right.
You're right.</v>

1245
01:11:35.021 --> 01:11:39.310
Because then you start getting more productive because you got so much mental

1246
01:11:39.311 --> 01:11:43.000
time.
Oh,
this.
There's nothing worse than getting dumped,
but there's,

1247
01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:45.090
if you're the one breaking up with some,
I've,
dude,

1248
01:11:45.091 --> 01:11:49.180
I've been on both sides have broken hearts.
I've had my heart broken.
It's brutal.

1249
01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:53.620
It's brutal.
I think that's why I'm so numb to it all now.
Yeah,
just fucking numb.

1250
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:56.290
But I know,
I already know if,
if my,
if my marriage is,
I've worked out,

1251
01:11:56.291 --> 01:11:59.440
I would never get married again and I would just give my wife fucking everything

1252
01:11:59.441 --> 01:12:03.360
and then I'll let you go.
I'll go live in a fucking trailer.
My Buddy,

1253
01:12:03.850 --> 01:12:07.330
I'm not doing it again.
I'm not,
I'm not getting on the fucking ride again.
Yeah,

1254
01:12:07.450 --> 01:12:09.340
that's it.
Now just fucking wherever she lives.

1255
01:12:09.341 --> 01:12:11.890
I'll just drive the trailer down the street so I can still see my kids.

1256
01:12:14.110 --> 01:12:16.720
You can send them one of those air pods.
Do you ever see those things?

1257
01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:22.240
I don't know.
I would.
I would get a fucking,
I buy one of those VW buses.

1258
01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:28.120
No,
I get a studio.
Yeah,
get all the sports packages.
That'd be it.

1259
01:12:28.450 --> 01:12:31.870
I just,
I don't like tronic drum kit.
I just go back to what the fuck I had.

1260
01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:35.560
I'm actually shocked that you got married to be Ozzy.
You best thing I ever did.

1261
01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:40.120
One is great,
but it's weird.
I Dunno.

1262
01:12:40.121 --> 01:12:41.860
I Dunno if I'm ever getting married to be honest.

1263
01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:45.970
It's like I want to get married,
but I don't have to do it.
When you're ready.

1264
01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:47.800
Yeah.
I'm 42 I wasn't married.

1265
01:12:47.801 --> 01:12:52.210
I got married at 45 I got three more years I'm going to is great.

1266
01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:53.600
And then all of a sudden I'm like five years in,

1267
01:12:53.601 --> 01:12:57.340
I'm already going to turn 50 what the fuck am I going?
Where am I going?

1268
01:12:57.370 --> 01:13:01.000
What am I gonna go back to fucking club?
This Kay ladies,

1269
01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:04.300
you're looking for a bald red head.
God,
this is so sad.
I saw,

1270
01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:08.400
I see comics like that.
I don't want to mention any names,
but when you see,
oh,

1271
01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:11.440
believe me dude,
that was a motivation.
I'm not going to be the cliche.

1272
01:13:11.441 --> 01:13:15.670
It's so fucking sad.
I was like,
Oh God,
I don't,
uh,

1273
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:17.950
so sounded like dating.
I don't,
I don't,

1274
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:21.520
I can't tell you I haven't dated since I just started doing stand up.
Really?

1275
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:23.230
Does that makes any sense?

1276
01:13:23.231 --> 01:13:27.170
Like I'd meet girls and then we just started hanging out and then I sent an uh,

1277
01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.080
picking men.
That sounds weird.
You start wide.

1278
01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:32.590
We started hanging out and then I just picked them.
I was like,
oh,

1279
01:13:32.591 --> 01:13:34.410
this is the one I'm when I met with this one for a while.

1280
01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:37.690
Do they know that's what you're doing?
I don't know if they do.
Yeah.

1281
01:13:37.691 --> 01:13:40.840
You need to just listen to the best thing I have fucking Lauren is you just got

1282
01:13:40.841 --> 01:13:45.250
to fucking say what you're thinking.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh,
you know,

1283
01:13:45.251 --> 01:13:47.860
that's one of the reasons most of the women that I date like me,

1284
01:13:47.861 --> 01:13:50.010
cause I pretty much say what I'm thinking.
That's all.

1285
01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:53.560
How happy would you be if a woman did that?
That'd be fucking amazing.

1286
01:13:53.770 --> 01:13:56.830
I'm not saying like,
Hey,
you look ugly today.
I'm not saying that,
but I mean like,

1287
01:13:56.831 --> 01:14:01.150
you know,
I don't,
don't be mean,
but like just say,
dude,
I'm on what time?

1288
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:04.880
I don't want to shed moment.
My relationship was me.

1289
01:14:04.890 --> 01:14:07.750
I had one of her friends was having a fucking birthday party.
Yeah.
Right.

1290
01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:12.250
The same night the Celtics and Lakers were playing like game of the NBA finals.

1291
01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:16.180
<v 1>Okay.
She's like,
why are you doing Tuesday?
Right.
She doesn't talk like that.</v>

1292
01:14:16.181 --> 01:14:17.320
That's just how it sounds in my head.

1293
01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.353
<v 3>So she's,</v>

1294
01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:27.260
<v 1>what are you trying to say?
So I'm like,
I'm watching the game.
She's like,</v>

1295
01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:30.310
does the pouty face,
you know,
manipulations and starts.

1296
01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.520
I hate the sexy voice and then the pout.
Right?

1297
01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:36.980
So if she's already tried to fucking tactics and not only is it a friend having

1298
01:14:36.981 --> 01:14:41.060
a birthday party,
it's like some fucking 1920s themed birthday party.

1299
01:14:41.061 --> 01:14:44.720
So I have to buy a fucking costuming.
A flapper.
Yeah.

1300
01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:47.790
I get addressed like I'm in the purple gang assumptions.
Right.
Okay.

1301
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:52.700
So she goes,
do you want to go?
And I just,
I said,
no.

1302
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:56.160
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1303
01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:01.110
<v 1>I liked that.
I liked that.
Yeah,
just what do you mean no?
And she goes,</v>

1304
01:15:01.111 --> 01:15:05.970
why not?
I go,
it sounds horrific.
Yeah.
She goes,
and she laughed.
She goes,

1305
01:15:05.971 --> 01:15:09.240
what do you mean?
She goes,
she's a friend to you as I go,
no,
she isn't.
I go,

1306
01:15:09.241 --> 01:15:13.890
she's your friend.
I've become friendly with her because you know her,

1307
01:15:14.190 --> 01:15:17.880
but she's not my friend.
I was sick this week.
She didn't know.
She didn't call.

1308
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:22.830
She's not my friend,
and I just kept,
I just kept saying no,

1309
01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:27.720
and the more I said no,
the more she thought it was funny who?
She got frustrated.

1310
01:15:27.721 --> 01:15:29.490
Then she just started laughing.
I go,

1311
01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:31.980
I'm not going fucking down that dress like Charlie Chaplin.

1312
01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:37.850
I want to watch this game.
I don't want to fuck a dues.
So then she was,
she goes,

1313
01:15:37.851 --> 01:15:40.550
she can't,
she just,
she goes,
well,
what time does the game start?
I go,

1314
01:15:40.551 --> 01:15:43.050
you're such an asshole.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1315
01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.020
So now I got to go to this fucking party and then race back.

1316
01:15:45.021 --> 01:15:47.990
So then I just made a compromise.
I said,
all right,
the game fucking starts.

1317
01:15:48.090 --> 01:15:52.490
Are you wet?
And whatever.
I said,
here's the deal.
I go,
I will drive you there.

1318
01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:53.810
I will make an appearance.

1319
01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:58.400
I'm not dressing up and I'm leaving with plenty of fucking time to get back.

1320
01:15:59.150 --> 01:16:02.930
Yeah.
So the before the game starts.
Yeah.
All right.
And I don't want to eat

1321
01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:04.660
<v 0>really.</v>

1322
01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:07.150
<v 1>I don't want to hear that.
Once again,
that's not how she sounds.</v>

1323
01:16:07.210 --> 01:16:10.630
That's how she sounds when she says shit like that.
So she said,
fine.

1324
01:16:10.631 --> 01:16:12.820
So I fucking show up.
I drop this thing off and I show up.

1325
01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:17.350
There's all these fucking guys that dress like fucking Charlie Chaplin and Al

1326
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.711
Capone and Shit.

1327
01:16:17.711 --> 01:16:20.920
And I come walking in with like a fucking Celtic shirt on dress style regular.

1328
01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.950
There's like,
hey,
you didn't dress up.
I said,
no,

1329
01:16:23.951 --> 01:16:27.710
no mom getting out of here in like 10 minutes.
And they go,
where are you going?

1330
01:16:27.711 --> 01:16:31.410
I go,
I'm going to watch the Celtics game.
And it's the finals,
this fucking hole.

1331
01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:35.140
And I remember the look on their faces and I this thick.
Yeah.
I felt awesome.

1332
01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:37.600
I bet they were so jealous,
dude.
You know what I do?

1333
01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:40.510
I've you how many times I've been the guy in the fucking check Chaplin outfit

1334
01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:46.630
<v 0>then pretty hard about saying no.
Well,
I'll just say no.
You know what I mean?</v>

1335
01:16:46.730 --> 01:16:49.640
But then I,
I'm pretty good about compromise though,

1336
01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:52.670
if they want to do something important to them.

1337
01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:56.720
So as long as I get to do what I want and then if they have something,
yeah,

1338
01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.660
<v 1>I know.
I have a bunch of compromises.
I have the,
okay,</v>

1339
01:16:59.661 --> 01:17:01.070
but you're driving and I'm drinking.

1340
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:05.100
<v 3>Oh,
okay.</v>

1341
01:17:06.170 --> 01:17:09.980
<v 1>Go to Brunch if you drive and I can drink,
that's thing I would,
you</v>

1342
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.350
<v 0>know,
that is the,
I still don't,
I still don't,
I don't do brunch.
Yeah.</v>

1343
01:17:12.351 --> 01:17:15.380
That's the one thing I fucking,
every time they walk,

1344
01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.300
there's a line and then they walk in,
they come on and go,

1345
01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:21.620
it's going to be 40 minutes is all right.
No,
it's not.
All right.

1346
01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:25.520
This is my fucking day too.
And it's a Sunday.
Fuck,
it's a sandwich.

1347
01:17:25.521 --> 01:17:26.600
You're going to get pissed,
dude.

1348
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:30.650
What the fuck do we take them to on a weekend where we walk out and be like,

1349
01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:34.140
if they said it's going to be 40 minutes,
they would lose their shit.
Oh,

1350
01:17:34.141 --> 01:17:37.780
they would.
They would.
They would lose their fucking house.
Shit.
They would pop.

1351
01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:42.350
They would pop.
All right.
Do I have time to read?
How,
how far into this are we?

1352
01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:47.110
Fuck.
Alright.
Hour and 20.
We got to wrap this up.
Um,

1353
01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:50.990
I'll read the rest of these some of the time.
Kevin,
this was effortless.
Oh,

1354
01:17:50.991 --> 01:17:52.950
thank you.
You fucking hilarious.

1355
01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:57.050
Obviously funny and everybody should go out to the Improv and West Palm,

1356
01:17:57.051 --> 01:17:58.580
West Palm Beach.
More importantly,

1357
01:17:58.581 --> 01:18:02.480
listen to the podcasts and listen to the podcasts.
All I'm saying,

1358
01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:04.820
I'm saying podcasts.
We,
Kevin Shea,

1359
01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:07.670
one of the funniest dudes from the longest fucking time.
All right,

1360
01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:10.370
everybody go fuck yourselves.

1361
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:13.190
And I'll check in on Thursday.
