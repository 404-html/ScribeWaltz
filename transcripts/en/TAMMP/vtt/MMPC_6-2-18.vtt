00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.900
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:08.790
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,
July 2nd,

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.410
2018 what's going on?
How
a,
as you can tell,
oh,

4
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:18.380
freckle cyst under the word.
Yeah.

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.340
I tried to do too much when I was on the road.
Uh,
uh,

6
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.030
I'm just an old guy enough and ended up catching a cold that goes to the middle

7
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:31.110
of fucking winter that's flew into Minneapolis the day of the show.
I usually,

8
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:34.160
I used to fly in the night before when I got the Kiddo and I don't know,

9
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.170
you know,
misses a little bit of,
you know,

10
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.420
her whatever day is possible.
So I flew out the day of,

11
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.810
then I landed and I've learned this lesson 50 fucking times and every time I've

12
00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:51.200
got sick I landed.
I was a little tired,
you know,

13
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.210
cause I had to get up early to get there on time and I went right to the gym.

14
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.280
Stupid fucking move.

15
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.620
Then I had to do two shows and then I hung out with Verdesian fucking Barnick

16
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.420
but I slept in the next day and next day I woke up.
I kind of felt runned out,

17
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.070
but I was like,
no ma'am.
And hit the gym again.
I hit the gym again,
fucking moron.

18
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.250
Then I take a steam,
then I go on fucking stage,

19
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.020
have one show CN in the night.
I absolutely love Barnet conversion and hey,

20
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.460
let's go out again.
So we go out again.
And this time we were,

21
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.000
we were at an outside bar up on this rooftop and it's really cool,
you know,

22
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.890
placing,
you know,
downtown Minneapolis and a,

23
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.700
I had a hat on,
but it wasn't enough.
And I could tell when I was,
you know,

24
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:38.910
when a cold just get ya and I'm feeling a little bit and then it's just getting,

25
00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:42.330
you're like,
ah,
fuck.
Here we go.
And I didn't have any vitamins.

26
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:46.560
That's another thing.
I forgot my vitamins,
all of that dumb shit.
So,
um,

27
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.190
I dunno.
So I apologize for being so frigging late here,

28
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:52.170
but however I want to thank everybody.

29
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.970
It's one of the most fun weekends I've had as far as crowds and just what I got

30
00:01:56.971 --> 00:02:00.680
to see in Minneapolis and Detroit.
Um,
Minneapolis,
first of all,

31
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.370
did a theater there on,
on the,
the campus of,
uh,

32
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.210
the big 10 university of Minnesota.
Now,

33
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.650
I was joking with the people there whenever I go,
you know,

34
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.060
to a great campus like that.
My first thought,

35
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.910
this is for all you young kids out there.
I always think to myself,
man,

36
00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:24.540
I wish I studied in high school.
I wish I tried.

37
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.630
This is fucking amazing.
That we drove by,

38
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:32.100
there was like a frat house and there was like 10 frat guys sitting in a circle

39
00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:36.060
playing some drinking games outside this amazing fraternity,
you know,

40
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.170
and I know everybody makes fun of them saying they're a bunch of date rapists

41
00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:42.990
and then this and then that and all this shit.
But at the end of the day,

42
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:47.070
who's making the robots that are going to kill all of us?
It's the nurse.

43
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.750
So he's up on the Frat boys.
Um,
they're not all rapists,
you know,

44
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.760
some of them just lear.

45
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.490
So anyways,
and I couldn't believe how fucking beautiful,

46
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.260
beautiful,
the University of Minnesota's campuses,

47
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.660
and I would say it on stage.
This is what you're a fucking moron.
I am.
I,
you know,

48
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:12.220
without ever seeing a campus,

49
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.240
I judge what it looks like by how your sports teams are doing.

50
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.620
If you haven't won a big 10 championship or an SCC championship in a long time,

51
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:24.270
I just figured that your school's a dump and it doesn't look good.
I'm,

52
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.730
I learned that with Vanderbilt.
Vanderbilt's never like,
you know,

53
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:29.050
I think maybe in baseball they're good,

54
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:32.400
but they never do anything in football and never do anything at hoops on this.

55
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.330
Like,
oh,
that's like almost a community college.

56
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.170
Then Nate board Gutsy told me it was a big fan of theirs.
It was like,
no,
dude,

57
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:41.500
that's like,
it's one of the best schools in the country.

58
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:45.460
Some of the smartest things.
It's engineering fucking eggheads school.
Right.

59
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.530
Um,
but I went off to University of Minnesota.
It's like all fucking brick.
I mean,

60
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.980
what I saw of it was a,
it was incredible.
Now I always have that thought,
like,

61
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:58.900
why didn't I study?
It wasn't that hard.
I was such a fucking pussy.

62
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.240
I was such a baby.
A couple of [inaudible] to subject and just,
yeah.

63
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.190
Did you get through it?
You know what I mean?

64
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.500
I didn't like doing hell runs either,

65
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:12.040
but I had to do them to get to do a fucking Gig at University of Minnesota.

66
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.140
I stuck with that.
Right.
Hang on.
Sorry.
I forget me.

67
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.303
<v 1>Sorry.</v>

68
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.940
<v 0>It's going to be a lot of that.
I'll hit pause next time.
Um,</v>

69
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.500
yeah,
look,
some of the math I get,
you know,
cause I gotta be honest with you.

70
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.410
Like I was cool right up until Algebra.

71
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.470
If I wasn't such a fucking class clown in a jerk off,

72
00:04:36.471 --> 00:04:39.200
I wouldn't have had to go to summer school after Algebra cause it wasn't that

73
00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:43.430
bad.
If I applied myself geometry,
I don't even know what,

74
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.820
I don't even know what the fuck was going on.

75
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.900
It was like these conspiracy theories about shapes,
not good spirit.

76
00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:54.540
They were proven,
um,

77
00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.620
like the NBA is fix was proven when they had that mobbed up ref.

78
00:05:00.621 --> 00:05:04.130
And of course they blame it on one guy.
They always blame it on one guy.

79
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.620
I don't know how long people would sit there and watch the NBA.

80
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.310
I'm not saying all the Games of fixed,

81
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.350
I'm just saying no other sport is it finessed the way that sport is finesse to

82
00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:18.860
make sure they had these match ups that are going to get ratings and it all goes

83
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:20.870
back to fucking Larry Bird and magic Johnson.

84
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.470
I'm convinced of it and it's still fucking terrified because they almost went

85
00:05:24.471 --> 00:05:28.430
out of business in the late seventies.
Um,
or ratings were way down,

86
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.790
you know,
but they all do it like during the steroid era.

87
00:05:31.791 --> 00:05:33.650
Do you think the fucking owners and baseball,

88
00:05:33.651 --> 00:05:36.980
like they didn't know what the players were doing.
Baseball was in a bad way.

89
00:05:36.981 --> 00:05:38.330
They canceled the world series.

90
00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:41.480
Cal Ripkin breaking a Lou Gehrig's record was all the fucking head.

91
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.870
They choose up the ball,
they make the ballparks smaller.

92
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.110
These fucking guys are going up.
They looking like the dad and the Incredibles,

93
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.471
you know,

94
00:05:48.471 --> 00:05:52.240
fucking skinny legs and giant upper bodies just drive and shit over the,

95
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.070
out of the frigging Ballpark,
say anti what was going on.

96
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.840
And then all of a sudden the shit hits the fan and not one owner got asked a

97
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:02.810
question.
They,
oh,
I had no idea.
We had no idea.

98
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.700
You're in the business.
Right.

99
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.890
I do stand up comedy.
I know who some of the up and coming funny people are.

100
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.890
I hear who's stealing jokes.

101
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.060
I hear who's going to be the next fucking whatever I hear who is maybe a fucking

102
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:24.140
party and too much.
She a year,
you're in it,
you know,

103
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.570
it's what you do.
Fucking lumber jacks.

104
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:29.060
They know who's a jerking off behind a redwood.
I mean,

105
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:33.650
they're in the fucking business.
So baseball was finessed that way,

106
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.290
I believe.
Right?
Football.

107
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.080
What they did was they just,
you know,

108
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.050
they weren't satisfied with their fan base and they just kept,

109
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.190
every fucking rule ended up being for the offense to the point.

110
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:50.630
It was borderline illegal to,
uh,
you know,

111
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.720
to fucking cover a receiver.

112
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.490
Now everybody's out there putting up Dan Marino numbers,

113
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:59.150
which is fucking ridiculous.
Dan Marino,
Dan Fouts,

114
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:03.530
those guys played back when you could borderline murder somebody stick them and

115
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:08.120
all of that shit.
I remember one year that year drew Brees,
I keep,

116
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:10.040
forget what he threw four,
but it was just like,

117
00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:13.250
there was like seven people on pace to break down Marino's record,

118
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:17.990
maybe not seven.
It's probably four
in a in one season.

119
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:20.270
So it's finesse that fucking way.
Right?

120
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.690
Hockey I eat,
I don't know what they're doing.
They just,
they,

121
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.080
they finally got it right.

122
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.270
They finally got it right with Nashville and Vegas and now they're going to

123
00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:34.430
Seattle.
I think they're finally going to take a turn.

124
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:39.440
And my only concern is that it's going to become immensely popular,

125
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.370
which is really a pipe dream.
But if it becomes immensely that,

126
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.270
the reason why hockey's still fucking great is because it is sort of the Jan

127
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.030
Brady,
the Middle Kit,
like nobody's fucking paying attention to it.

128
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:53.660
So you meet the players,
they're all cool.
They're fucking down to earth.

129
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:59.000
You know what I mean?
I Dunno.
Sorry.
I've even taken any cold medication.

130
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:03.050
This is just literally my intellect,
so I can't blame anything here.
Um,

131
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.980
but basketball,
I swear to God,

132
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.970
like the Celtics are common on right,

133
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:16.100
and the Lakers suck.
And I remember thinking as a fan,
this sucks.

134
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.170
We're going to be good and they suck.

135
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.710
It's like if the red sox good and the Yankees suck or vice versa,
it's not fun.

136
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.550
Right.
And all of a sudden Lebron is going to move.

137
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:28.040
And where does he go to the fucking Lakers?

138
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.830
And next year that's going to be a bunch of free agents

139
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:36.140
and the Lakers we'll stock up and again,
we're going to go into the finals.

140
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.750
It's going to be fucking Lakers,
Celtics.
You know,

141
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:43.220
if anybody can get past that juggernaut of,
of,
um,
of,
uh,

142
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:48.260
golden state.
But like,
I dunno,
I think it's all,
uh,

143
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.060
it's definitely finessed like a,

144
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.920
like a boxing promoter putting together,

145
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.820
like the fact that they let Kevin Duran go to the golden state warriors and the

146
00:08:58.821 --> 00:09:02.980
last two seasons have been an absolute fucking snooze fest.
It's like they,

147
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.390
you knew they were going to win it the second he went there and they did,

148
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.310
you knew they were going to go back to back and they did.

149
00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:10.410
<v 2>Okay.</v>

150
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.160
<v 0>What date do it and golden state is,
is like what the fuck and Yankees did.</v>

151
00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:15.600
<v 2>Okay.</v>

152
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.890
<v 0>In the early two thousands and the height of them buying championships was when</v>

153
00:09:19.891 --> 00:09:24.030
they got fucking a rod.
Anything Post 1998 cause I love that Yankee team.

154
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:28.050
I don't want the Yankees,
but I love that team.
[inaudible] 99 2000,
the Clemens,

155
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.440
all of that bullshit,
um,

156
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.880
was all those pile on fucking championships.
And then the red sox were like,

157
00:09:35.881 --> 00:09:39.810
well what the fuck?
You know,
we're in the middle of a 90 year drought,

158
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:44.220
86 year drought here.
This is,
this is,
this is the game.
We got to play this game.

159
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:48.420
And this is the thing,
we haven't stopped playing that fucking game.
I mean,

160
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.840
nobody could be as bad as the fucking Yankees.
I mean,

161
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.220
remember they had fucking geometry and a rod in Jeter and they're fucking

162
00:09:56.221 --> 00:10:00.420
infield.
It was ridiculous.
They had to have the best shortstop in the league,

163
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.950
in their infield.
One agreeing to play third base was fucking nuts.
Um,

164
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:10.530
yeah,
I mean,
whatever.
So anyways,
so the Braun is a Laker and uh,

165
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.200
I guess I'm going to get my wish that they're going to be in the finals,

166
00:10:13.201 --> 00:10:17.790
hopefully against us.
I mean,
that's who I want to play and beat.
Um,

167
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.040
<v 2>okay.</v>

168
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.780
<v 0>And I like our coach better and you know,</v>

169
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.590
I know that they're going to go out and get a zillion guys because everybody in

170
00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:27.920
the NBA wants to play in La.
Not Cause,
you know,

171
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:29.720
partially because they love the Lakers,

172
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:34.280
but who doesn't want to fuck a famous broad,
right?
Who Does it want?
Fucking 75,

173
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.340
80 degree weather year round.
I've said this forever.
What do you want to,

174
00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:42.341
do you want to go to Boston Racist Boston and deal with the winter and fucking

175
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:48.010
sixes and sevens or do you want to come to racist La Bang supermodels and uh,

176
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.870
go to the beach whenever the fuck you want?
12 months of the year.
I mean,

177
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.580
we can't compete with it.
I mean that uniform literally looks like sunshine.
Hey,

178
00:10:55.581 --> 00:10:59.110
speaking of that go now is in the middle of Minneapolis.

179
00:10:59.111 --> 00:11:02.920
I went by that fucking robbery.
I looked like an old fucking

180
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.253
<v 2>like</v>

181
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.130
<v 0>hockey stadium and I would've thought it was the north star old place had I not</v>

182
00:11:10.131 --> 00:11:14.390
known that it used to.
It's where the mall of America is now.
Um,

183
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:15.970
<v 2>yeah,</v>

184
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.440
<v 0>that wasn't a fucking red flag.
Yeah.</v>

185
00:11:17.441 --> 00:11:20.050
We're getting rid of the hockey team and we're putting the biggest fucking mall

186
00:11:20.051 --> 00:11:20.884
ever.

187
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.100
<v 2>Okay.</v>

188
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.340
<v 0>Um,
I,
I still don't understand how that fucking thing stays open.</v>

189
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.380
You know,
how do you fucking,

190
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:29.720
<v 2>okay.</v>

191
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.200
<v 0>Yeah.
You know what the mall of America is like.</v>

192
00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:34.020
It's like having a TV show now and it's just so many of them.

193
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.780
I would tell you the time I was talking to a comedian and I told her how much I

194
00:11:39.781 --> 00:11:43.440
liked her show and she was saying thanks and we were talking for five minutes

195
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:46.950
before she realized I was talking about another show that she had that just got

196
00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:51.240
canceled and she was talking about a different TV show that I didn't even know.

197
00:11:51.241 --> 00:11:55.190
She had two television shows.
And had no fucking idea.
Uh,

198
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:56.933
anyways,

199
00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.900
so I went by the armory thing there and I saw Jennifer Lopez blade there during

200
00:12:00.901 --> 00:12:02.070
the Superbowl.
I guess they redid it,

201
00:12:02.071 --> 00:12:07.071
but the coolest fucking thing ever about that venue is that's where the

202
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.760
Minneapolis Lakers with George Mike and when their first four NBA championships

203
00:12:11.761 --> 00:12:15.930
and that,
uh,
that Ba championship that the Lakers still calling NBA championship,

204
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:17.670
which is fucking hilarious.

205
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:22.350
They somehow one one all right before the NBA existed.

206
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:28.380
But anyways,
I really wanted to go in there and take a fucking tour of it.
So,
uh,

207
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.240
so there we go.

208
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.240
I know a lot of you guys are expecting me to flip out that fucking Lebron went

209
00:12:33.241 --> 00:12:38.040
to.
I don't give a shit.
I like who a,
I'll.
Thank you.
How are you?
Lovely.

210
00:12:38.041 --> 00:12:40.770
Near thumbs up.
Oh Yeah,
nothing

211
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.170
you feel rundown.
I didn't give it to you today.
That didn't get to get you sick,

212
00:12:46.171 --> 00:12:50.840
did I?
No,
I don't think so.
As full rundown.
All right,

213
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.790
cool.
Okay.
Thanks for taking notes.
Okay,

214
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.710
bye.
Uh,
yeah,
my wife was sick too.
You know,

215
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.880
I was also sick,
but you know,
my wife was also kind of sick,

216
00:13:04.881 --> 00:13:08.300
but I was really sick.
So you know what was going to happen,
right?

217
00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.280
She's going to sleep in and I'm going to handle the kid.

218
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:15.110
That's just how it works.
How,
what,
where you want to keep peace in the house.

219
00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:19.400
That's how it works.
He just fucking get baby the shit out of them,
you know?

220
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.140
And I would love to say that.

221
00:13:21.141 --> 00:13:24.100
I'll be able to remember that for the next argument so I can be like,
Whoa,

222
00:13:24.101 --> 00:13:27.150
what about to fucking time?
I was sick of the new I to flow to what?

223
00:13:27.151 --> 00:13:30.470
Your door for the homework.
I will remember it.
I don't have that ability.

224
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.970
You know,
you fucking with a woman,

225
00:13:34.971 --> 00:13:37.640
they're like fucking Matlock.
You know,
I can fucking start pulling.

226
00:13:37.641 --> 00:13:40.430
I never even watched that show,
you know,

227
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.580
but I imagine he was pulling up fucking cases from the past.

228
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.760
I have no idea.
You know what he did last night?

229
00:13:46.761 --> 00:13:50.360
I was on and I couldn't get the fucking sleep.
I was on the Internet there and,

230
00:13:50.361 --> 00:13:51.194
um,

231
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:57.200
I was seeing watching all this shit on a Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis,

232
00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:02.300
just how big and how famous they got everything.
And after they broke up,

233
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:03.650
uh,

234
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:08.650
Dean Martin in about 1958 got in the restaurant business and he opened up Dino's

235
00:14:10.071 --> 00:14:10.904
lodge,

236
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.830
which was basically just west of La Cienega and sunset just south.
Now,

237
00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.190
this giant fucking complex there,
but it's a long gone.

238
00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:22.610
I mean they knocked it down to the 80s,
but he got involved in there.

239
00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:24.770
They put his big head there,

240
00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.860
Dino's lounge and he went down there and um,

241
00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.430
it was a really hip place to go to at first,
late fifties.
I mean,

242
00:14:32.431 --> 00:14:34.610
Dean's Dean and he would actually go down there,
you know,

243
00:14:34.611 --> 00:14:37.250
get the restaurant going,
star struck patrons.

244
00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:41.990
He signed in our graphs and all that shit.
And uh,
do you know,
like fucking two,

245
00:14:41.991 --> 00:14:46.040
three laters Jerry Lewis opened a competing restaurant down the street.

246
00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.960
This is how bad it got.

247
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.260
He opened a competing one and then stole Dean Martin's business partner,

248
00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.020
um,
to open that one.

249
00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.650
And then he had an even bigger picture of himself on the restaurant and it was

250
00:14:59.651 --> 00:15:03.250
on a pole,
like a hundred feet in the air and it wasn't stationary,

251
00:15:03.251 --> 00:15:04.210
it was revolving.

252
00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.660
So I guess dean ended up saying,
Hi man,
fuck this shit.

253
00:15:10.661 --> 00:15:12.310
And he got it Coz he's cool.
He said,
fuck this.

254
00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:16.060
He got out of the restaurant business and then he had to sue them to get his

255
00:15:16.061 --> 00:15:19.090
name taken off in the image and he couldn't get it taken off.
And they,

256
00:15:19.091 --> 00:15:22.750
his face state on that restaurant until like the fucking 80 is like I said,

257
00:15:22.751 --> 00:15:25.780
when they finally fucking took it out.
But um,

258
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.320
<v 2>okay.</v>

259
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.680
<v 0>Anyways,
I just can't imagine that it got that bad,</v>

260
00:15:30.681 --> 00:15:34.700
which of course led me to the 1976 reunion that they had on the Jerry Lewis

261
00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:39.430
Telethon with Jerry had no idea dean was coming out.
Frank brought him out.
Uh,

262
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.020
that was cool watching them.
I'll get all of that shit.
You know what I mean?

263
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.090
It's just stupid fucking falling out stuff.
Um,

264
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:48.620
but I just thought it was funny at the height,

265
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.350
at the fucking height of them hating each other.

266
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:54.680
They had competing fucking restaurants.
How nuts to comedians.

267
00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:57.170
You know,

268
00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.800
I just picture matching like De Niro in casino count in the fucking blueberries

269
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.353
in the muffin.

270
00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:04.080
<v 2>Okay.</v>

271
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.650
<v 0>Freaking out doing that crazy Jerry Lewis voice saying how Ddo has more</v>

272
00:16:07.651 --> 00:16:12.270
blueberries and his muffin and this is fucking unacceptable.
Um,
anyways,

273
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:16.870
plowing ahead here.
Um,
oh,
Billy is a

274
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.000
fucking gonna hang around in the house here and get over this shit actually feel

275
00:16:22.001 --> 00:16:25.420
a thousand times better than I felt yesterday.
Um,
I just need to walk around.

276
00:16:25.421 --> 00:16:26.231
They sent weird thing,
you know,

277
00:16:26.231 --> 00:16:30.730
when he gets sick where you supposed to lay around and relax and you know each,

278
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.750
you know,
is it,
why is it each soup?
You know what I mean?
You slurp it,
right?

279
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.610
This one is hybrid things.
It's almost a gas and a liquid.
It's not a solid,

280
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:42.880
you know,
it is a liquid and it's a solid,
that's what it is.

281
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:45.610
It's like a super group of food.
Um,

282
00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:47.180
<v 2>okay.</v>

283
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.700
<v 0>No,
it isn't bill.
It's like cereal.
If you heated it up.</v>

284
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:51.760
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

285
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.510
<v 0>What do you put that,
you know,
do you know?
I saw when I was on the road,</v>

286
00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:58.740
I actually saw a Pringles potato chips and they had deal flavor and I love

287
00:16:58.741 --> 00:17:01.320
fucking dill pickles and I love Pringles potato chips.

288
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.670
And those two came together and I couldn't get myself to do it because it just,

289
00:17:05.671 --> 00:17:09.270
it was coming across like it was going to be like a super group,
you know?

290
00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:15.050
Like what if we took fucking Robert Plant and fucking stuck them with Keith

291
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.010
Moon?
Remember they would do shit like that and then he's just,

292
00:17:17.011 --> 00:17:19.530
and then it just never sounded good cause the vibe wasn't there.

293
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:23.190
I'm just so worried that that's what it's going to be.
And on some level like,
um,

294
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:23.730
you know,

295
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:28.730
it's going to ruin my enjoyment of original Pringles and,

296
00:17:29.851 --> 00:17:33.920
uh,
and dill pickles.
You want to level of Pringles,
they taste delicious.

297
00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:35.460
And I'm an,
I'm a bit of a neat freak,

298
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.660
although my office is a fucking mess right now.
You know,

299
00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.900
I hate fucking dishes in the sink the next morning.
It like depresses me.

300
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.260
I fucking knock 'em out.
You,
uh,

301
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:51.930
basically an incredible father and husband is what I'm telling you.

302
00:17:51.931 --> 00:17:55.020
That's my version of it.
My,
it's my version of the story.

303
00:17:55.021 --> 00:17:58.200
Eventually we'll have neon here when she's feeling better and then she'll

304
00:17:58.201 --> 00:18:01.620
probably tell you the truth that I'm a fucking asshole over there.

305
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:07.070
Did Anybody Watch the fucking Austrian a Formula One race?

306
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.800
That is my favorite fucking Formula One race that I've been,

307
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.940
that I've ever watched and I've only watched since Monaco 2016 and I've missed a

308
00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:16.950
few here or there.
Um,

309
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:22.600
absolutely loved that fucking race.
Um,

310
00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:27.240
I'm a huge fan of Max for staff and I feel like he's the next guy came and

311
00:18:27.241 --> 00:18:32.070
Daniel Ricardo,
right in Daniel.
Ricardo's gonna fucking leave red bull.

312
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.350
I don't know where he's going to go.
Ferrari.

313
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.220
I don't know if there's room in the Mercedes seem,
I have no fucking idea,

314
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:42.890
but it was just like the top two guys.
Uh,

315
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.440
what's his face?
Uh,

316
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.870
Max Verstappen and Kimmy raking and they're fucking hilarious.

317
00:18:47.871 --> 00:18:50.630
Their press conferences are hilarious thereafter.
They just,

318
00:18:50.631 --> 00:18:53.390
they don't give a shit.
Um,

319
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:54.790
<v 1>yeah.</v>

320
00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:57.910
<v 0>You know,
they just,
they have like that comic's comic vibe about them.</v>

321
00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.840
Like I know when,
um,
I was talking about the last time,
uh,

322
00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.070
Sebastian Vettel had bagged into a couple people in Max for staff and during
the,

323
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.160
um,
after the press conference,
he goes,

324
00:19:09.161 --> 00:19:12.370
you guys should tell him he should change his style of driving.
You know,

325
00:19:12.371 --> 00:19:15.900
cause they had said that to him and that Tim,
uh,
Max early in the season,

326
00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:19.510
then he goes and then fucking Sebastian should continue to drive exactly the way

327
00:19:19.511 --> 00:19:21.550
he's driving cars.
That I haven't changed anything.

328
00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.880
And now you guys aren't shitting on him because of winning by the way.

329
00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:28.390
And then the United States,
the hosteen came in fifth and sixth.

330
00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:32.890
That's like our highest place ever was at fourth and fifth or fifth and sixth.

331
00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:36.670
It might've been fourth to fifth.
I got to look it up here.
I can't remember.

332
00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.610
But a Mercedes though.
Oh my God,

333
00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:45.000
they had a fucking brutal day.
Brule date.
It's sucks cause I wanted,
um,

334
00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:50.350
he always want to see like a close race at the end.
Um,
but I got to be,

335
00:19:50.351 --> 00:19:52.450
I'm a little jaded with this sport where I was just,
you know,

336
00:19:52.451 --> 00:19:53.650
after the first term,
which was,

337
00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:56.740
and it was a fucking incredible start to the race.

338
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:58.723
<v 1>MMM.</v>

339
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.020
<v 0>And I remember when,
when Lewis Hamilton,
uh,</v>

340
00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.520
got into first place after the first year and I got so over,
he's gonna win.

341
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:11.590
He's going to win it.
Put the track was so fucking hot.
That tire started,

342
00:20:11.591 --> 00:20:15.750
the blister.
Some bullshit happened.
I don't know what and what's his face.

343
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:19.940
Uh,
no.
We came in fourth and fifth,

344
00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:26.410
Grogan and magnificent fourth and fifth.
Um,
the hospital,
um,

345
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:28.451
I don't know what happened.

346
00:20:28.451 --> 00:20:31.510
Somebody was going to fucking slow or something that caused Lewis Hamilton.

347
00:20:31.511 --> 00:20:35.230
They have to slow down.
And then he got passed and then he had to go into the,

348
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:38.980
the fucking pits.
Wish that you had to do one extra pit stop is what happened.

349
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:42.490
And that fucked him.
But that guy is such a good driver.
Even in the end,

350
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.880
the other guy's tires were starting to blister up and he was,

351
00:20:45.881 --> 00:20:49.320
she was just right fucking and then all the drama went out when he fucking his

352
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.970
car,
shit,
the bed.
And I believe,
uh,

353
00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.990
Valtteri Botox adds some sort of gearbox failure.
But um,

354
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.640
and also what's his face?
Uh,
um,

355
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.700
Daniel Ricardo is his fucking car shit.
The bed too.

356
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:07.210
He's been having a rough go of it.
But uh,
I just liked it cause it,

357
00:21:07.211 --> 00:21:10.690
it just put different people in the lead that I haven't seen.

358
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:14.260
I know Max Verstappen has done well over the last few.
Um,

359
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.340
but it was,
it was just fun to watch all of that shit.
Um,

360
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.520
and then watch Louis Hamilton having like the,

361
00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:26.080
the fastest lap of the race trying to catch up like Bill Elliot back in the day

362
00:21:26.081 --> 00:21:30.490
and the stock car races and a then unfortunately his car,
shit the bed.

363
00:21:30.491 --> 00:21:34.840
But is the big thing was he was up 14 points.

364
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:40.800
Lewis Hamilton over Sebastian Vettel Vettel came in third and I believe you get

365
00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:44.740
15 points and Lewis Hamilton got no points.

366
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.820
So now Vettel is leapfrog to pass him and he's up one point,

367
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.433
um,

368
00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.880
because I was hoping he wasn't going to slowly fucking pull away.

369
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:58.450
I think they race again next week in Great Britain and then they might be on

370
00:21:58.451 --> 00:21:58.990
their break.

371
00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:02.050
There's summer break and then there'll be neck and neck for the rest of the
year.

372
00:22:02.051 --> 00:22:06.250
So far Ferrari can fucking hang in there.
It should be exciting,

373
00:22:06.251 --> 00:22:08.950
right through a Brazil and on into November where they,

374
00:22:08.951 --> 00:22:13.420
what do they always end up?
He said Dubai,
I can't fucking remember.
Um,

375
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:19.600
so anyways,
very fucking excited about that race.
Uh,
I mean it sucked.
You know,

376
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:23.710
the Mercedes get knocked out.
This is also Daniel Ricardo,

377
00:22:23.711 --> 00:22:27.190
but it was just fun to see some new blood up there and then,
you know,

378
00:22:27.191 --> 00:22:29.830
watching Louis Hamilton putting on a fucking show as he was dealing with,

379
00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:34.780
with his tires literally falling apart.
Um,
anyways,

380
00:22:34.781 --> 00:22:35.650
when I was,
uh,

381
00:22:35.651 --> 00:22:39.040
when I was in also when I was in Minneapolis and forgot to tell you I was going

382
00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:41.620
to try a different place to get a juicy Lucy.

383
00:22:41.621 --> 00:22:46.480
Last time I went to maths bar and I got this fucking Uber driver.
It's hilarious.

384
00:22:46.481 --> 00:22:47.410
This Indian guy,

385
00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:52.390
and there's a lot of construction going on downtown in Minneapolis and it said

386
00:22:52.391 --> 00:22:54.250
he was five minutes away for 15 minutes.

387
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:59.140
He finally pulls up and this dude was like the fucking old Indian version of me.

388
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:03.310
Like he was like snapping on me cause he was mad about construction.

389
00:23:03.311 --> 00:23:06.070
But I understood it because like it took me a minute to figure out like,

390
00:23:06.071 --> 00:23:10.450
why is this guy yelling at me?
I go,
I want to go to a whatever the fuck it was.

391
00:23:10.451 --> 00:23:14.290
The five [inaudible] club was going to try that one next,
right?
And he goes,

392
00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:18.100
I need an address medially yelling at me.
I go,
all right dude,
relax.
No,

393
00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:19.990
you can't just say that.
Never in a place I need an address.

394
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.140
I was like to stop yelling at me.
He goes,
I'm not yelling at you,
aren't you?
Yes.

395
00:23:23.141 --> 00:23:26.950
You argue,
yell at.
And then verse,
he gets to the car,
he's looking at me.
I'm like,

396
00:23:26.951 --> 00:23:30.910
dude,
this guy's fucking not,
you know,
this guy's yelling at me and he goes,

397
00:23:30.911 --> 00:23:35.130
I need an address.
And I'm like,
well,
the name of the place is,
is,

398
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:38.380
is the five eight club putting your phone,
your fucking cunt.
Right.

399
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.450
So now I went to his energy,

400
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:44.080
but fortunately I've been really working on it and I brought it back down again

401
00:23:44.081 --> 00:23:45.800
and I was just like,
hey,
all right.
You know,

402
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.700
like I just stand this traffic here,
right?
Let's,

403
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.740
and then he was trying to smile his way to realize that he went to fucking nuts.

404
00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:57.780
So I think I gave the wrong address.
He'd have taken us to mad,
sparse.

405
00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.180
So now it's like really tense Barb.

406
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:01.100
Nick's riding in the front seat and this fucking guys,

407
00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.620
it looks like we're with our fucking angry grandfather.

408
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:07.490
We were all trying to be on our best behavior.
So Barton is,

409
00:24:07.491 --> 00:24:10.400
tries to lighten the mood.
We see this fat chick on a bicycle,
you know,

410
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.550
she was at a dead stop and that she's trying to get it going.
So it's just like,

411
00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.950
you know,
it's precarious when you start off a bike.

412
00:24:15.951 --> 00:24:17.300
If you're not pedaling fast enough,

413
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:18.740
especially when you're carrying that kind of weight.

414
00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.400
And Bar Party was a Jesus Christ looking around.
He goes,

415
00:24:22.401 --> 00:24:25.910
they don't have assets like that.
Nydia dude,
he's like maybe on an elephant.

416
00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:27.920
Right.
And the guy started laughing.
I was,
it's like,
yeah,

417
00:24:27.921 --> 00:24:30.800
there'll be a fucking sacred cow over there.
And we just fucking broke the ice.

418
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:36.050
We broke the ice by making fun of a fat chick and bringing up stereotypical shit

419
00:24:36.051 --> 00:24:39.620
from that guy's culture.
That's how we did it.
And then he pulled up,

420
00:24:39.621 --> 00:24:42.740
he ended up pulling up to maths bar instead of the five,
eight club.

421
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.120
And I was like,
oh,
this isn't where I wanted to go.
And he kind of looked at me.

422
00:24:47.121 --> 00:24:49.520
I was just like to forget it.
It's all right.
It's fine.
I,

423
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.660
I don't wanna get yelled at again.

424
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:55.190
I was living like a battered wife at that point.
Like,
okay,
Bye Dad.

425
00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:00.170
I love you.
Just fucking drove off.
Um,

426
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:04.520
all right,
let me read,
let me read a little bit of a,
by the way,
it was delicious.

427
00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:08.450
And they,
they have,
uh,
they get middle,
a hot Miller high life in a bottle there.

428
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.310
You know what the dangerous thing about a Miller high life is?

429
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:17.750
There's just something about the bottle.
It feels like it's eight ounces.

430
00:25:17.751 --> 00:25:20.300
It just doesn't feel like it's 12 ounces of beer and they just,

431
00:25:20.301 --> 00:25:24.710
they just go down so easy,
you know?
And I had a show that night,
so,
uh,

432
00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:30.800
you know,
ended up having a,
I think we had like two and the waitress was cool,

433
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:34.310
you know,
she was asking us about the show.

434
00:25:34.311 --> 00:25:37.250
We ended up hooking her up and then she gave us some fucking hats and shit,
man,

435
00:25:37.251 --> 00:25:40.700
it was really just,
it was fucking Minneapolis is fucking awesome.

436
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.610
The people up there are fucking awesome.
And then I go to Detroit,

437
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.710
you know,
the fucking great.
And I asked,
it was actually like,

438
00:25:47.711 --> 00:25:52.280
as I just literally landed,
went to the hotel and then went out and did the show.

439
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:55.370
So I was doing my typical Detroit material,
but how white people,
you know,

440
00:25:55.371 --> 00:25:59.660
drive a hundred miles an hour into,
uh,
the tiger's game and after the,
you know,

441
00:25:59.661 --> 00:26:02.270
and then drive back out cause it's so fucked up in the downtown area.

442
00:26:02.271 --> 00:26:03.590
And I knew it was making a comeback.

443
00:26:03.591 --> 00:26:05.950
Every time I go there it's a little bit nicer.
But two,

444
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:07.580
it's like those jokes are over now.

445
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:13.690
I walked out after my show at about 10 30 at night and I saw a white guy,

446
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:18.740
a white kid on a bicycle with a backpack riding down the street,

447
00:26:18.741 --> 00:26:22.130
not even nervous.
And I was just like,
like,
it's,

448
00:26:22.131 --> 00:26:25.610
it's in a real estate sense,
it's too late to buy there.

449
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:31.090
You're already going to be paying like fucking top shelf prices if the

450
00:26:31.101 --> 00:26:35.000
neighborhood got to the point where a white guy will ride down the street late

451
00:26:35.001 --> 00:26:39.590
at night,
you know,
with a backpack on,
you know,
he wasn't like a fucking,

452
00:26:39.591 --> 00:26:44.370
you know,
he wasn't like eight mile m and m white guy.
He was a white guy like me,

453
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.080
you know,
a suburban,
a suburban night,

454
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:54.580
a non dancing suburban white kid.
Um,
so anyways,
uh,

455
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.630
they had like a John Varvatos downtown.
It was fucking ridiculous.

456
00:26:57.631 --> 00:27:00.090
I remember years ago,
I was telling Versie going through it,

457
00:27:00.091 --> 00:27:01.200
I'm going to buy some property here.

458
00:27:01.201 --> 00:27:03.390
This place is gonna fucking blow up because you're out of your mind.

459
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:08.130
I was just like,
dude,
it's a no,
but
it's here.

460
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.490
It's just what I saw this happen in Pittsburgh.
I saw this happen in Cleveland.

461
00:27:11.491 --> 00:27:14.760
I just didn't have fucking money at the time was I was fucking putting in in

462
00:27:14.761 --> 00:27:17.400
this God damn,
you know,

463
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:20.760
fucking money pit of a house that I bought a nice house.

464
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.540
Now it's a nice house now,
but I,
this is literally body off restoration.

465
00:27:24.541 --> 00:27:29.520
I had to do this fucking house,
sorry.
Anyways,
uh,

466
00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.880
and I remember seeing on the Anthony Bourdain show,
uh,
parts unknown,

467
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:36.870
rest his soul.
I saw a guy,

468
00:27:36.871 --> 00:27:41.480
he bought a skyscraper there for 5 million bucks and I was thinking through
this,

469
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:44.700
any way you could scrape together 5 million bucks and then renovate it,

470
00:27:44.701 --> 00:27:48.510
which I don't know what that would cost another 50,
45.

471
00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:51.870
And if you could just sit on that,
I mean,

472
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.220
there's still a way that it's a skyscraper.
Well that city makes a comeback,

473
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:57.420
that thing,
you know,
say his 60 billion it,

474
00:27:57.421 --> 00:27:59.910
it's going to be worth a quarter of $1 billion.
And you know,

475
00:27:59.911 --> 00:28:03.840
fucking did all that shit.
The uh,
the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers,

476
00:28:03.841 --> 00:28:06.330
he went down there,
he bought a bunch of fucking buildings,
redid them,

477
00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:10.950
had made the office a space cheap and he filled them up with these internet

478
00:28:10.951 --> 00:28:15.330
companies and um,
made me feel good.

479
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.420
Then I was going to make the same moves at a billionaire fucking owner of a

480
00:28:18.421 --> 00:28:22.420
basketball team was going to make,
I just sit down the fucking money.
Um,

481
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.680
anyways,
but I'm very,

482
00:28:25.681 --> 00:28:30.681
very happy for that city as I was for Cleveland as I am for Pittsburgh and all

483
00:28:30.811 --> 00:28:34.350
that shit.
Cause has such great cities,
Buffalo,
Baltimore,

484
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.550
all of those cities going right through the Dayton.

485
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.400
I love all of those fucking cities and they,

486
00:28:41.401 --> 00:28:44.730
and all they need is just people to fucking invest in them.

487
00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:49.050
You know what I mean?
I'll tell you when we're done free in the Iraqis.

488
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:52.200
We shot to come back here and try to help out some of these fucking cities.

489
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:57.660
Get them going again.
Start Building Shit.
You know,
if I was running shit,

490
00:28:57.661 --> 00:29:00.540
I'd have these fucking hipsters,
right?
I would just have them like,

491
00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:01.830
what are you into right now?

492
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.820
What are you going to bring back from the past and do it in some artisan fucking

493
00:29:05.821 --> 00:29:09.720
way and you know,
just,
you know,
give him a break on factories and shit.

494
00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.330
You just start making stuff here again.
You know,

495
00:29:12.331 --> 00:29:14.520
say what you want about hipsters.
They like a lot of cool stuff.

496
00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:19.440
They just insufferable to talk to.
Um,
all right,
the black box.
Oh,
sorry.

497
00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:20.640
The Black Tux.

498
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:25.140
I don't know if that was from watching too much porn or it having a pilot's

499
00:29:25.141 --> 00:29:28.740
license.
The Black Tux,

500
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.950
a wedding season is upon us.
Uh,

501
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:35.670
you're going to be doing it big and going out to all your buddies weddings.

502
00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:39.450
When you bringing a date,
you want to look fresh.
Yeah.
You want to hook up.

503
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.580
You don't to bring a,
you want to go there like fucking Jim Carrey,

504
00:29:43.581 --> 00:29:47.150
dumb and dumber,
but have a cool Tuxedo.
But it has to be convenient.

505
00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.490
That's where the black,
the black Tux comes in.

506
00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.110
The black tops has awesome suits and Tuxedos and all kinds of styles.

507
00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:58.370
And your rent them online.
All right.

508
00:29:58.371 --> 00:30:01.550
I just hit pause and I blew my nose while it wasn't recording.
See,

509
00:30:01.551 --> 00:30:02.840
I learned from my mistakes.

510
00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.340
The black Tux offers the kind of suits and Tuxedos styles that would normally be

511
00:30:07.341 --> 00:30:10.310
wildly expensive to buy and you might only wear it.

512
00:30:10.311 --> 00:30:14.780
What's like the Emerald Shawl?
Tuxedo?
It's funky.
It's cool.

513
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:19.250
But how many times you get aware an Emerald Green Tuxedo with the Black Tux?

514
00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.113
You can.

515
00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:21.250
<v 1>Okay.</v>

516
00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:26.170
<v 0>You can do you and blow it out for your big event.
One.
One time event.</v>

517
00:30:26.171 --> 00:30:28.720
Yeah.
You gotta you gotta go with something a little bit flashy.

518
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:30.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

519
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.400
<v 0>It don't bring a fucking date automatically before you an open your mouth,</v>

520
00:30:33.401 --> 00:30:36.130
you're going to seem interesting.
Forget about when the ladies start drinking.

521
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.720
Next thing you know,
you're out there doing the mock arena,
right?
And you're like,

522
00:30:40.721 --> 00:30:44.740
why would you ever get married?
And that's called beating your 20s alright,

523
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.380
so try out a new look.
Do something different.

524
00:30:47.381 --> 00:30:51.550
It takes your style to the next level.
With the Black Tux,
free home,

525

you can see the fit and feel the quality of your suits month,

526
00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:58.740
months before the event.
It's a hard word to say,
plural months.

527
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:03.860
Let me do that for fucking months,
I think I say months.

528
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.870
M U s once.

Both ways.

537

The black Tux premium rental suits and Tuxedos though.

538
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:44.840
All right,
here we go.
Lastly,
but certainly not leastly simply safe.

539
00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:50.450
Here's what I love about simply save these guys.
Obsess over details.

540
00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.900
It's why the alarm system is so good.
Here's an example.

541
00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:57.050
A typical glass break sensors sometimes gets fooled.

542
00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.910
A false positive sounds like dropping plates,
a baby crying.

543
00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:06.530
Oh,
then it freaks out.
It says the British are coming or the sky's falling.

544
00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.230
Simply safe,
didn't want it settled for a typical,

545
00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.080
didn't want to set up for typical because really good home security should be

546
00:32:13.081 --> 00:32:14.100
really accurate.

547
00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:19.350
So they actually considered a glass break.
Test Facility.

548
00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.340
<v 1>Okay,</v>

549
00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.260
<v 0>well they have a bunch of toddlers in there throwing glasses.</v>

550
00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.370
They ran over 10,000 live glass break simulations,

551
00:32:27.371 --> 00:32:31.930
refining their technology.
The detection technology,
until it was so accurate,

552
00:32:31.931 --> 00:32:36.250
it continues to,
can distinguish a broken plate from a broken window.

553
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:37.660
<v 1>Okay,</v>

554
00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.321
<v 0>Jesus Christ.</v>

555
00:32:38.321 --> 00:32:43.170
Can you believe somebody knows to like make up fucking a little piece of

556
00:32:43.171 --> 00:32:47.650
electronics?
Understand that
everything,

557
00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:51.150
how not relevant you're going to be in 10 years.
This is the level of detail.

558
00:32:51.151 --> 00:32:53.090
Simply safe puts into everything they do.

559
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.280
It's sets them apart from other security companies.

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:25.820
you ever think why the people at the top are not concerned about the environment

568
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:30.260
generally speaking and how they're content to just fucking use up all the oil.

569
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:35.180
Kill as many people as they need to kill to get the fucking oil,
you know,

570
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:37.970
pollute the air as much as they can.
Throw the fucking rivers.

571
00:33:37.971 --> 00:33:41.660
Why they don't give a shit?
You know,
how was just sticking?

572
00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:44.270
I think it's because we're all good.
You know,

573
00:33:44.271 --> 00:33:48.080
all US regular people are going to get replaced by robots.
You know what I mean?

574
00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:53.150
The love robot Comedians,
you know,
robot fucking whores,

575
00:33:53.151 --> 00:33:54.500
whatever the hell you want it,
you know,
I don't know.

576
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:57.050
Kind of ran out of jobs there,
but you know what I mean.

577
00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.220
And then there's still going to,

578
00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:01.100
they're still going to live and they're going to be that upper 1% and they're

579
00:34:01.101 --> 00:34:05.030
going to have like,
just like essentially,
uh,

580
00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:10.050
an entire population that never complains is totally into what the fuck they're

581
00:34:10.551 --> 00:34:14.810
doing.
I think they'll keep,
uh,
a group of people.

582
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:19.840
She would beings as slaves and there's job will be to fuck and make more people

583
00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:25.680
so that these older fucking rich one percenters can harvest their organs and

584
00:34:25.681 --> 00:34:27.300
live forever.
That's what I think.

585
00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:30.490
Those are the kinds of things that I think when I'm alone,

586
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:36.090
um,
have you got to figure the first time you kill somebody for the,
your organs,

587
00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.920
you could just going to do that forever.
Cause it's like,

588
00:34:37.921 --> 00:34:39.450
well I don't if there's a higher power,

589
00:34:39.451 --> 00:34:43.330
I don't think I want to meet him or her with,
with that on the resume,

590
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.950
you know,
God just sit across to you.
Well you were busy

591
00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:52.030
sitting there,
shifted in that fucking chair.

592
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.220
You just fucking know exactly what the fuck he's do you know exactly what he's

593
00:34:57.221 --> 00:34:57.791
talking about.

594
00:34:57.791 --> 00:35:00.730
Like that one's going to pop out and get you got everybody's got probably that

595
00:35:00.731 --> 00:35:04.870
one thing except for truly good people,
which I'm not,
you know,

596
00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:10.950
that can fire,
you know,
when I die,
if there was an afterlife,

597
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.850
I feel like God's to f like fucks with you.

598
00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:18.690
Like you sit across the room and he just looks down at your,
your resume,
right.

599
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:21.940
Probably has like the half glasses,
you know,

600
00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:27.290
sitting on the end of his fucking all mighty knows eyebrows up and shit and they

601
00:35:28.231 --> 00:35:32.900
just kind of looks across the ace.
Probably like a,
you want me to,

602
00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.610
you want,
you want to tell me about this,
you know?

603
00:35:35.611 --> 00:35:38.110
And then you're sitting there going,
fuck,
what's he talking about?

604
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:44.140
Is this a trick?
Uh,
Oh shit.

605
00:35:44.141 --> 00:35:48.320
He can hear what I'm thinking.
Don't think about all the shit you did,
Bill.

606
00:35:48.321 --> 00:35:53.290
He's got to know.
It's gonna be such a mind.
Fuck.
Um,

607
00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.473
anyways,

608
00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:01.300
that's a weird fucking topic of dying,

609
00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:05.870
uh,
with a fuck around my,

610
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:12.540
what the Hell is all my shit?
Oh,
there it is.

611
00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:15.980
It's trying to find them like my fucking shit.
I wanted to talk about,

612
00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:18.693
<v 2>okay.</v>

613
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:23.670
<v 0>Detroit's fucking gorgeous white dude on a bicycle.
Too late to invest.</v>

614
00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.070
She,
that's what I do.
I just wanted a couple of words.
Oh yeah.

615
00:36:26.071 --> 00:36:30.240
That's what I wanted to talk about.
Um,
anyways,

616
00:36:30.241 --> 00:36:34.070
so I'm so psyched to be back out here in Los Angeles.
You know,

617
00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:38.910
when I was in Detroit,
um,
it's weird when I was in Minneapolis,

618
00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.670
I already what they were known for,
which is the juicy Lucy,

619
00:36:41.671 --> 00:36:43.860
which is a fucking incredible,
like the one it Matt's bar.

620
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.600
They got this nice char on it.

621
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.480
Then they got the cheese of course in the middle and it's molten hot,

622
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:52.300
so you gotta be careful,
nibble,
nibble around the outside.
And um,

623
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:57.940
so it was,
it was delicious.
And,
um,

624
00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:00.790
there was ice cold.
It was fucking great.

625
00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.790
It made me wish I didn't have a show that night.
I was like,

626
00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:07.390
I think I want another one of these and I want to sit here and just fucking

627
00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:11.460
watch a game,
you know?
And,
um,

628
00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:15.750
but then I went to Detroit
and,
um,

629
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:22.260
you know,
I ordered Tacos,
stupid fucking roof.

630
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.240
I mean they were good but they weren't,
but you know,

631
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:26.730
they're not la to la knows is known for Tacos.

632
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:29.430
San Francisco is known for Burritos

633
00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:35.330
and I'm known for being pasty.
Oh,
let's talk World Cup.
Shall We?

634
00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:40.790
Let's see what's going on in the FIFA World Cup.
I watched a couple of games.

635
00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:46.490
Um,
I can't even tell you who the fuck I saw.
I did see the highlights.

636
00:37:46.491 --> 00:37:50.630
So when I wanted to watch was Brazil in Mexico,
you know what I mean?

637
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:55.690
I mean that was just a fucking soccer supernova as far as I was concerned about

638
00:37:55.851 --> 00:37:57.470
Russia beaten spade.

639
00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.983
<v 2>Okay.</v>

640
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:03.570
<v 0>That,
that,
that was like the fucking lake placid moment,
you know.</v>

641
00:38:03.571 --> 00:38:05.760
And I was sitting immediately go like,
oh this is going to be weird.

642
00:38:05.761 --> 00:38:09.030
It's Russia keeps moving along,
you know,

643
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:12.540
you watch America's going to be a bunch of babies about it,
you know,

644
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.970
cause everybody's already saying that they kind of fucked with our election or

645
00:38:15.971 --> 00:38:20.010
whatever.
And,
uh,
you know,

646
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:24.540
of course he let you now the World Cup.
They don't like we give a shit,

647
00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:28.710
uh,
book game that I watch.

648
00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:34.600
I watched the Dutch people play.

649
00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.560
Uh,

650
00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:38.470
<v 1>uh,
fuck,
I can't remember.</v>

651
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:44.040
But the other people want some of the best goaltending I've seen in soccer ever.

652
00:38:45.131 --> 00:38:50.110
The fucking game starts,
first of all,
uh,
the Dutch guys,
right?

653
00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:54.160
I was at Denmark,
Denmark,
right?
They fucking a Denmark Dutch people.

654
00:38:54.161 --> 00:38:56.350
Is that the Netherlands?
I Dunno,
I'm an American.

655
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.590
They don't talk about the rest of the world.
Okay.

656
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:03.490
They talk about the fucking white people that started this country.

657
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:07.560
That's what gets driven into your fucking skull.
MMM.

658
00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.680
<v 0>So the uh,</v>

659
00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:16.420
Denmark scores a goal like 40 seconds in or a minute in or something like that.

660
00:39:17.391 --> 00:39:21.590
And then like 45 seconds later,
the other guys score,
the guys who won,

661
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.450
<v 1>okay.</v>

662
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:27.760
<v 0>Can't fucking remember Croatia,
Slovakia,
Slovenia,</v>

663
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:32.230
Romania.
Um,

664
00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.170
I don't know who the fuck it was.
They fucking score.
I'm like,
Oh my God,

665
00:39:35.171 --> 00:39:37.170
this is finally my dream game.
Minute and a half.

666
00:39:37.171 --> 00:39:40.660
And there's already been two goals.
This is some shit American can appreciate.

667
00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:45.100
And then there wasn't another goal for like another fucking hour and a half.

668
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:50.320
But,
uh,
I do have to say the goaltending was fucking incredible.
All right.

669
00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.410
And that guy with his fucking golden fucking

670
00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:57.500
locks there go come head for fucking

671
00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.330
Denmark was incredible.

672
00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:06.050
And then the other guy was just a fucking lunatic.
One of those guys,

673
00:40:06.051 --> 00:40:09.590
you could tell he can't shut it off after the game and they would just guessing,

674
00:40:09.591 --> 00:40:12.370
right?
Uh,
they dive and then the guy would shoot to the Middle East,

675
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.680
fucking get his foot out while he was dive in the other way.

676
00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:20.690
And whenever you miss a penalty fucking kick,
like is,
is the shooter,

677
00:40:20.691 --> 00:40:24.740
whatever the fuck you call them,
right?
They,
you know that they're fucking,

678
00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:28.280
they're just thinking like,
Oh God,
I'm going to get fucking,

679
00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.770
I'm never going to hear the end of this when I go back to my country,

680
00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.810
I'm never going to hear the fucking end of this,
you know,

681
00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:37.820
unless somebody steps up and saves my fucking ass.
So I did see that game.

682
00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:41.630
I did see the Brazil game where that Rinaldo Guy,
oh my God.

683
00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:45.800
I thought for half a second he was literally on fire,
you know,

684
00:40:45.801 --> 00:40:49.160
like when will Ferrell was running around and Ricky Bobby with the invisible

685
00:40:49.161 --> 00:40:51.680
flames,
he was tearing off all his clothes.

686
00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:56.080
I thought that that's what was what was happening.
Um,

687
00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:00.740
I mean,
I know the guys,
it definitely should have been a penalty.

688
00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:03.230
It was a piece of shit move.
The guy stepped on him.

689
00:41:03.231 --> 00:41:07.400
He raped his fucking cleat right across his ankle.
I imagine it's smarted,

690
00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:12.140
but she's as Christ that was like silent film acting.

691
00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:14.293
<v 1>MMM.</v>

692
00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:19.500
<v 0>Penny wins against Brazil.
One,
two to nothing.
And uh,
we're getting down to it.</v>

693
00:41:19.501 --> 00:41:21.960
So I imagine France or England was playing today,

694
00:41:21.961 --> 00:41:26.690
right now Francis going to play,
they were already in like a,
they're already,

695
00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:31.220
what do I look it up?
FIFA World Cup standings.

696
00:41:31.221 --> 00:41:35.700
And then you've got to fight through all these CBS sports cons that don't

697
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:40.550
fucking have it.
I want the grid and what the bracket,
give me the bracket.

698
00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:45.200
World Cup bracket,
CBS sports.
You get to fuck me against CBS sports.

699
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:47.323
<v 1>Come on</v>

700
00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.700
<v 0>slowly opening</v>

701
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:56.700
this fucking website sucks.
It keeps saying brackets.
It doesn't have the bracket.

702
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:58.200
Whereas eyebrow kit,

703
00:41:59.120 --> 00:41:59.590
<v 2>yeah,</v>

704
00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:03.660
<v 0>there's nothing I can,
I can click on schedule.
The standards are,</v>

705
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:08.120
and who the fuck's playing today?
World Cup schedule.

706
00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.530
I'm clicking.

707
00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:12.413
<v 2>Okay.</v>

708
00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:15.580
<v 0>Ah,
you fucking ass.
Or Russia?
2018 schedule.</v>

709
00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.353
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

710
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.580
<v 0>Oh my God.
I found the bracket.
All right.
Oh,
I watched the Arra.</v>

711
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.860
Gwaii always sells Uruguay.
Earl grey beat Portugal.
I watched that game.
Shut up.

712
00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:32.360
I watched uh,
Croatia be dead.
My,

713
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.610
<v 2>okay.</v>

714
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:35.600
<v 1>MMM.</v>

715
00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:38.600
<v 0>I guess Sweden beat Switzerland.
The lovable,</v>

716
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:41.850
I don't know why they breed VH one for their countries.
Sui.

717
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:46.160
There's no you in Switzerland.
Why would it be WWE?
Is that too close to Sweden?

718
00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.000
Yes.

719
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:47.833
<v 1>MMM.</v>

720
00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:54.870
<v 0>Brazil is clean.
Belgium.
All right.
So the last person who has to get in is,</v>

721
00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:56.970
is England,
is playing Columbia.

722
00:42:58.210 --> 00:42:58.880
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

723
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:02.300
<v 0>When the fuck is that game,
I got to take that one.</v>

724
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.820
Then they get into the quarter finals,
then there's the semis,

725
00:43:04.821 --> 00:43:08.450
and then there's a final game.
Fucking goes by so fast.

726
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:12.170
So there's one,
two,
there's three,
basically three more rounds.

727
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:14.103
<v 1>MMM.</v>

728
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:16.360
<v 0>And I'm going to watch it for once.</v>

729
00:43:16.361 --> 00:43:19.240
I don't think I've watched the final since that guy from Italy missed that

730
00:43:19.241 --> 00:43:20.074
penalty shot.

731
00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:21.650
<v 2>Okay.</v>

732
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:25.980
<v 0>You know,
but I,
I remember when I was a kid,
way back in the 80s,
Diego Maradona,</v>

733
00:43:25.981 --> 00:43:30.000
they hand to God and all of that Shit.
But uh,
other than that,

734
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:32.010
I remember also it was in the,

735
00:43:32.011 --> 00:43:36.660
it wasn't it in the u s I'm like 94 and like 30 Americans showed up,

736
00:43:36.661 --> 00:43:39.900
but it's still sold out because everybody around the world was like so excited.

737
00:43:39.901 --> 00:43:42.540
Like,
oh my God,
it's going to be so easy to get tickets.
Let's go.

738
00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:44.613
<v 1>MMM.</v>

739
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:48.760
<v 0>All right,
let's read some,
uh,
some of the fucking questions here for the week.</v>

740
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:53.530
Was it really,
really neat to swear right there?
All right.
Um,

741
00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:57.110
where are we?
Sweden.
Oh,
speaking of that,
please come to sweet.

742
00:43:57.111 --> 00:44:00.130
And last time you were here,
I was a little kid and it didn't know about you,

743
00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.310
but I really liked your podcasts and your standup is amazing,
isn't it?

744
00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:08.110
Like how young that person is.
I haven't been there in about five years,

745
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.080
you know?
So what do you mean,

746
00:44:11.081 --> 00:44:14.800
like 15 you'd probably still already like five,
11,

747
00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:16.230
all super tall kids of uh,

748
00:44:16.231 --> 00:44:19.780
I'm putting together an eastern European tour by the way.

749
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:24.940
Um,
hopefully for the beginning part of next year.
I'm teasing that,

750
00:44:24.941 --> 00:44:26.120
that that's what's going to be happening.

751
00:44:26.121 --> 00:44:30.520
And if we go into a bunch of countries that I've never been to before and uh,

752
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:32.040
but I know I to get back to Sweden.

753
00:44:32.041 --> 00:44:33.990
I haven't been there and way too way too long.

754
00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.580
So I will definitely get back there.
All right.
Uh,

755
00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:39.170
thank you for the compliments of my podcasts and my stand up.
A,

756
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:43.710
can a comic cover a comedic bit like a musician?

757
00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:49.380
Uh,
no they can't.
They can't.
Let's he tells everybody,

758
00:44:49.381 --> 00:44:51.900
remember that Cosby bid?
You remember that prior bit?

759
00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:56.660
Dear bill one rant away from an aneurysm birth.
I hit how true that is.
Ken.

760
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:59.310
I want to be Standup Co.
Oh,
want to be staying?

761
00:44:59.311 --> 00:45:01.140
You're not an actual standup comedian.

762
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:04.890
Cover a comedic bit like a wannabe musician would cover his son.

763
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:10.490
I'm not talking about a paid gig.
Just an open mic.
Nah,
don't do that.

764
00:45:10.491 --> 00:45:12.450
Cause you're already,
you're,
even though you're not a pro,

765
00:45:12.451 --> 00:45:16.470
cause you're not getting paid.
You are,
yeah,
you don't do that.
This is,

766
00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:21.390
there's no coffee house of standup comedy sets your professional like yourself

767
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:26.330
and are putting on a special,
it should be total original content.
Uh,

768
00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:28.860
the thing is not all of us are as funny as you,

769
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:32.940
but we still want to make the world laugh and get a taste of the spotlight and

770
00:45:32.941 --> 00:45:34.620
maybe some groupie pussy to,

771
00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.930
and if you think you're going to go up on an open mic,

772
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.320
I don't give a fuck if you kill with original material.
When you get off stage,

773
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:41.820
you still have to have game.

774
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:44.940
That's the thing about being a comedian as a fucking musician.

775
00:45:44.941 --> 00:45:49.070
You go up there and you start singing a song,
it's fucking over.
I mean you,
you,

776
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:49.321
you,

777
00:45:49.321 --> 00:45:53.220
you can do that at a fucking coffee house singing other people's fucking songs

778
00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:57.240
and it's just going to be rain in fucking vagina.
Uh,
comedians,

779
00:45:57.241 --> 00:45:59.310
we can go up there for an hour,

780
00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:03.600
hour and a half with our own material and you still have to work for it.

781
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:07.230
You know,
they want you to still be funny when you get off stage.

782
00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:09.840
Keep being funny keeping.
They know what the other guy to fucking sing.

783
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:14.460
He can sit there brooding,
you know,
smoking a cigarette.
Um,
anyways.

784
00:46:14.461 --> 00:46:17.460
Now your initial response will probably be something along the lines.
No,

785
00:46:17.461 --> 00:46:21.610
go write your own material.
You lazy piece of Shit.
Uh,

786
00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:24.390
you call me illiterate.
At least I can write my own jokes.
Oh,

787
00:46:24.391 --> 00:46:25.650
you trying out material right now?

788
00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:30.410
I did my time in the nightclubs bombing on stage and as a young,
skinny redhead.

789
00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.420
And you don't think I just wanted to go out there,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

790
00:46:33.421 --> 00:46:36.500
blah.
Go Fuck Yourself.
You leave these Lazy Co.
Uh,

791
00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:39.310
the thing is I don't strive to be a professional comedian as,

792
00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.340
as engineering pays a lot better.

793
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:44.040
And writing my own jokes seems like too much work too.

794
00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:48.120
I really don't give a shit about you right now.
You know what I mean?

795
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:53.730
Hey Man,
like I,
you know,
I mean,
I just want to go fucking uh,

796
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:59.020
play once one down of professional football without getting hit.
Yeah,

797
00:46:59.021 --> 00:47:00.570
go fuck yourself.
Uh,

798
00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:02.880
I just want to go on stage and give the illusion that I'm funny.

799
00:47:02.881 --> 00:47:07.140
So maybe a girl will think I actually have a personality.
You want to fuck me?
Oh,

800
00:47:07.141 --> 00:47:10.860
now we're getting to it.
Now we're getting to it.

801
00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:15.360
All right.
So you're an engineer.

802
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.390
You probably introverted,
you're super smart,

803
00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.280
but you don't have anything going on with the ladies.

804
00:47:21.281 --> 00:47:24.600
So right now you think in leg,
so you'll,
oh,
that's funny.

805
00:47:24.601 --> 00:47:29.190
And then you think that funny guys,
comedians get a ton of ass.

806
00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:34.150
Uh,
I'm not saying there are guys out there that do,
but they work.
It's fucking,

807
00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:36.580
or unless you know,
you fucking ridiculously good looking,

808
00:47:36.581 --> 00:47:40.420
but like it's fucking work.

809
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:44.050
Um,
if it is,
if you're extending a comedian,

810
00:47:44.051 --> 00:47:47.650
you kind of have like that slumber vibe,
slumber party,
vibe,
energy,

811
00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:54.250
like all my God,
you guys,
it's weird.
It's like a feminine,

812
00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.900
you know,
fuel must,
it's a weird thing about women.

813
00:47:58.901 --> 00:48:01.030
If you give off an a feminine energy,

814
00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:04.760
you're actually going to get more fucking ass than a fucking,
uh,

815
00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.910
a guy
or I guess a guy vibe.

816
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:13.660
You know what I mean?
I mean,
look at David Bowie,

817
00:48:13.661 --> 00:48:17.710
the guy was walking around wearing dresses that was just women with prince was

818
00:48:17.711 --> 00:48:19.960
wearing high heel shoes,
his whole fucking they eat,
they,

819
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.770
it was like a a lick the locust,

820
00:48:23.771 --> 00:48:26.260
except it was all vaginas flying at those guys.

821
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:30.730
So maybe that's what you need to do rather than,
uh,

822
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:33.580
rather than steel from comedians.

823
00:48:33.581 --> 00:48:38.440
I would steal from Prince and David Bowie and I would think that you guys are

824
00:48:38.441 --> 00:48:41.920
all down there.
Everybody's wearing like the fucking white lab coat.

825
00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:47.580
If you added a little bit of Flair of feminine flare to your scientific is

826
00:48:47.791 --> 00:48:52.630
scientist coat,
who knows,
go to work,

827
00:48:52.631 --> 00:48:57.340
design a bridge while wearing some fucking prince high yields,
fucking boots,

828
00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.790
uh,
telling you you're,
you're automatically,

829
00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:06.730
you're going to be fucking interesting.
All right,
let me keep reading here.

830
00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:09.250
Uh,
I just want to go save blah,
blah,
blah.
He goes,

831
00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.520
I look at it like it's a scientific report.

832
00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:16.630
It's not plagiarism as long as you cite where you got the information from.

833
00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:20.170
So if at the beginning of the set I said something like most essays I wrote in

834
00:49:20.171 --> 00:49:24.100
college,
this set is completely plagiarized.
That's a funny joke,
sir.

835
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.250
Consisting of ideas from people much smarter than me.

836
00:49:27.251 --> 00:49:32.100
And the only original thing I have to say is this opening line in some asshole

837
00:49:32.101 --> 00:49:34.300
somewhere else has probably already said this too.

838
00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:37.990
Or at the end of the set I say,
thanks for listening.

839
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:39.400
If you want to see those jokes,

840
00:49:39.401 --> 00:49:43.300
they're actually supposed to be performed.

841
00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:46.470
How those shows are actually supposed to be foam.
Go check up Pilbara dude.

842
00:49:46.471 --> 00:49:49.120
You're,
you're,
you're cutting yourself short.
You're actually a funny guy.

843
00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.540
You're just lazy.
Um,

844
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.560
you could actually use that opener and then go into one of the oldest jokes of

845
00:49:59.561 --> 00:50:01.270
all time,
you know,
one of those fucking Warren,

846
00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:04.570
a fireman's where red suspenders and be like,
I'm just fucking with you.

847
00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:08.620
And then to just talk about being a fucking engineer and I got no game with

848
00:50:08.621 --> 00:50:11.050
women.
You only have to be up there for five minutes.

849
00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:14.230
All right to that,

850
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.780
I actually think you want to fucking do this.

851
00:50:16.781 --> 00:50:20.950
And I also think you funny from that first line,
all right?
So there's,

852
00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:25.030
there's a year two options.
All right?

853
00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:30.110
If,
if you sincerely from an unoriginal fan from the great white north,

854
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:34.120
you're funny,
you're self deprecating,
you got enough here that it,

855
00:50:34.121 --> 00:50:38.320
it's not crazy to me that,
that you would go up and do an open mic.
But uh,

856
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:39.223
you know,

857
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:43.460
it's the laziness factor that you just want to go up there and do other people's

858
00:50:43.461 --> 00:50:47.360
shit.
But I understand.
I remember the first time I sat down to write like,
okay,

859
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:50.720
I'm going to write jokes.
It's the weirdest feeling ever.
It's like,

860
00:50:50.721 --> 00:50:55.340
how do you do this?
Like what do I even fucking,
what am I going to talk about?

861
00:50:55.341 --> 00:50:58.190
How do I connect one idea to another?
You're not supposed to know.
All right?

862
00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:01.700
So just open with that line.
Talk about your life.
You know,

863
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:04.370
who gives a fuck if you bail after three minutes?
That's what I did.

864
00:51:04.371 --> 00:51:06.740
I even get through the five minutes and look at me.

865
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:11.510
Tell a Dick Jokes all across the lead.
All right?
But,
um,

866
00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:16.850
you're not going to get respect from other comics.
Other open Miker is going up.

867
00:51:16.851 --> 00:51:18.560
They're doing other people's fucking material,

868
00:51:18.561 --> 00:51:22.590
and you will immediately be branded a thief.
Watch out for this guy,

869
00:51:22.591 --> 00:51:25.580
and it'll be a bunch of open makers who are severely insecure and they're going

870
00:51:25.581 --> 00:51:30.030
to need a target to fucking focus.
They're awful childhoods on,

871
00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:32.480
and that's going to be you.
So I would open with that joke.

872
00:51:32.481 --> 00:51:35.990
I would close with what the fuck he said.
I wouldn't do other people's material.

873
00:51:35.991 --> 00:51:38.870
I talk about my life and when you're at work,
you know,
whatever,

874
00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:43.250
put a bow on Asub shit.
Trying to be interesting and a bag.

875
00:51:43.251 --> 00:51:46.520
One of the egg chick she fucking work with.
You know,

876
00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:49.240
you guys can't go see star wars or something.
I Dunno.
Good luck to you.

877
00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:52.860
All right everybody,
I'll check in on you on our Thursday.
I'll check it out.

878
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:57.500
Uh,
I have a great couple of days.
You fucking suck.
Let's go.
Fuck yourself.
