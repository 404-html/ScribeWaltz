00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.160
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:06.161 --> 00:00:08.410
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.880
<v 2>Ah,</v>

4
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.200
<v 1>just checking in on.
Yeah,
just checking in to see how your week's going.</v>

5
00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:18.970
This isn't enough.
This never is.

6
00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:23.380
Nor is it ever meant to be an official podcast.
All right.

7
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm just fucking,
just,
just popping in real quick.
Little fucking half hour,

8
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.540
you know.
See now your workouts.
Go and seeing how you drive home still.

9
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:38.200
When are you listening to at work?
Oh,
you son of a bitch.
God bless you.

10
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.400
God bless you.
If he can get away with it.
I woke up today.

11
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.420
Butoh Lou Dude,
and I've,
I've had this fucking song in my head and I,

12
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.810
you might want to fast forward,
I forget how the lyrics go.

13
00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:52.210
Was something like,
so,
uh,

14
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.250
give you a kiss after the loving Bada Doo Doo bop bop,

15
00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:04.390
bop Bam.
Who Sang that song data?

16
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.870
Jude.
That's one of those fucking guys
who's probably,

17
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.780
you know when he recorded it is younger than I am,
but when I look him up,

18
00:01:11.781 --> 00:01:13.490
he's going to look like he's 106.

19
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.480
Let's see after the love and lyrics.

20
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.710
You guys remember that one?
Oh,
oh.
Engelbert Humperdinck

21
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.180
<v 0>yeah.</v>

22
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.180
<v 1>Engelbert Humperdinck where the fuck is the Millennium Collection?</v>

23
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.640
The millennial collection.

24
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.500
Can we have a theories of songs that are safe for everybody?

25
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.290
Could that be okay?
Sorry.
Get my shitty recorded them on the road here.

26
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.810
Um,
just for the millennials.
Oh,

27
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:53.811
it's so as sing you to sleep after the Loven with this song I just wrote yes.

28
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.410
The day.

29
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.330
And I hope you can hear what the worlds and the Busey I again.

30
00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:04.920
Well,
I don't know the rest of the fucking song goes.
That's one of those songs.

31
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:08.910
All you know is after the loving and you just sit there mumbling along

32
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.070
after 11,
right?
Oh fuck.

33
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.850
Oh my God.
That just reminded me of a fucking joke.
I want to do
a,

34
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:28.300
wait a second.
I gotta write this down.

35
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.690
Sweet Caroline.
Fuck you.
Cunt.

36
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.240
Uh,
red socks.
I got s one of the most stressful gigs.

37
00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:43.560
This is the last stressful Gig I have all year.
I got past all the fucking press,

38
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.670
you know what I mean?
So all the press I had to do for that fucking thing.

39
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:49.690
You sit down,
you like,
how's this gonna go?

40
00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:54.000
I was this one guy was that one going to go and you get all through it,
right?

41
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.830
I had a bunch of fucking,
you know,
I did that Gig for the cops.

42
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.650
The motorcycle cops in California got somehow got through that one.

43
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.470
I wasn't sure how that was going to go.
That one ended up going great.

44
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.860
I got one last fucking thing.
And once I get past this Gig,

45
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.600
I have nothing but comfort zone gigs for the rest of my year.

46
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.380
Today I'm on a roast,
they're retiring.

47
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:20.510
David Ortiz is number and uh,

48
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.570
he wanted to have a roast for his,
um,
for his charity.

49
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.660
And what's hilarious is I don't think he's going to understand most of the shit.

50
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.320
Like he,
one of the comedians he was talking to said,
you know,
I went out,

51
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:34.930
I laughed.
One of the people laughing,
but you talk real fast.

52
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:38.730
I don't understand what a lot of it is.
It's fucking,
which I understand.

53
00:03:38.731 --> 00:03:41.110
Cause if I went to the Dominican Republic and they started roasting me,

54
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:45.700
I'd be like,
Eh,
I just keep waiting for him.
A roll hall.

55
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.620
That's the word I'd be waiting for.
Are they talking about

56
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.840
Cabeza?
Roho whatever the fuck they gonna say.

57
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.920
Oh [inaudible] how the fuck you saying I don't know.
So,
um,

58
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.890
I got some good ones.
I got some good ones.
Uh,
how do you roast David Ortiz?

59
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.030
You know,
fucking grumps there.
Uh,

60
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.230
Petrolia is going to be there and you know,

61
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:14.950
these are all athletes that play for Boston teams.

62
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:19.900
So all of them have won championships.
That's just how it is around here.
People,

63
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:25.050
this isn't like your towns were roasting one or your local athletes three out of

64
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:29.230
the four sports.
You know,
maybe you won one championship.

65
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.330
It'd be a fucking joke.
See what other city would be hard?

66
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:38.590
New York,
you could fucking destroy people.
Fucking destroy people.

67
00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:40.510
Cause I don't think there's anybody left on the Yankees

68
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.670
and that God knows football team's turnover.
You couldn't really fun.
I mean,
Ely,

69
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.970
they'd always just make fun of how he looks at me to get trashed.
And next trash,

70
00:04:50.971 --> 00:04:52.860
the mets trashed and Rangers

71
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.130
those Brooklyn fucking teams

72
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.920
that had to be like a two part fucking roast Pittsburgh be a hard place.

73
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.190
You know,
that'd be a hard place by,
maybe you can trash the pirates,

74
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.850
but I mean fucking penguins back to back.
And they've won.

75
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.490
They've won three with Crosby

76
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.220
big bands one too.
And you know,

77
00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:21.470
a bunch of his shit would be taken off to test how it works.

78
00:05:21.471 --> 00:05:24.150
They take it off the table.
I don't know that I'm talking about that.
Hey.
Yeah.

79
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.940
Hey,
could you not?
Um,
so anyways,

80
00:05:28.941 --> 00:05:30.200
I just have to get through this,

81
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.040
so I figure I'm going to sit there and get called a cancer patient for fucking

82
00:05:34.041 --> 00:05:37.490
an hour.
Uh,
they'll make fun of my black wife and then I just,

83
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.380
all I gotta do is just go up there for 10 minutes.

84
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.150
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

85
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.150
<v 1>Trash David Ortiz.
I mean,
it's going to be fun.</v>

86
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.050
I still want to tell you some of the jokes,

87
00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:53.860
but I know [inaudible] got a tweet them and then people will read them before I

88
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:55.750
get there.
And I need every laugh I can get.
I'm,

89
00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:58.400
I literally was fucking writing the shit.

90
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.930
Like I can't sit down and write.
I can't do it,
you know,

91
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.120
let's think of how I read out loud.
Okay.

92
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:10.100
Now imagine me trying to put those words down onto a piece of paper.
Okay.

93
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:11.743
Um,

94
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.360
how I do it is I put my daughter in the stroller and I walk around the block,

95
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.340
a big huge walk around the block and I'm just talking to myself and everybody

96
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:23.450
thinks,
oh,
look at that.

97
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:27.740
Daddy's so engaged with this child and I'm really coming up with roast jokes.

98
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.460
And then I sat down and I smoked a cigar by myself on my back porch and I just

99
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:38.780
video myself and I just say shit into my fucking,

100
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.850
then I'll have like 40 videos all like nine,
10 seconds long.

101
00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:47.390
And then I just transcribed them on the plane.
Uh,

102
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.600
most of them now I'm trying to put them into an order where they flow and I'm

103
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:54.250
actually writing them down,
but I'm too late for the Tele prompter,

104
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.910
so I'm going to have to go up their old school with a fucking pieces of paper up

105
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:01.100
there.
I know people can be like,

106
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.790
<v 5>you feel good beach,
look over your shoulder dose.</v>

107
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.550
<v 1>There it is.
The teleprompter.
See that?
The rabbits already in the hat.
Um,</v>

108
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.250
I never do these roads things either.
I never do them.

109
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.890
I thought a lot of those comedy central wants after awhile they just went off

110
00:07:17.891 --> 00:07:22.180
the rails.
You know what I mean?
It just,
everything was like the fucking,

111
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:27.670
I dunno,
everything was so god damn.
Same,
same fucking stupid joke.
You know.
Hey,

112
00:07:27.671 --> 00:07:27.980
I'm not

113
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.220
<v 5>Shane,
this guy beat but doable.
But when he walked the walk because he woke up,</v>

114
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:32.090
woke up a

115
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.650
<v 1>nine 11,
you know,
whatever the fuck he could say that would</v>

116
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.790
be the most,
you know,
air quote,
Edgy fucking thing,

117
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:44.510
even though it was totally fucking predictable.
Um,

118
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.310
so,
uh,
yeah,
I never got into those things,

119
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.670
<v 5>you know.
Hey,
when you fuck your mother,</v>

120
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:56.720
we did dogs get it at herpes when your fucking scurvy.

121
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.070
<v 1>Um,
plus I don't get roasted.</v>

122
00:08:02.071 --> 00:08:03.150
Somebody you don't know,

123
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.680
like the most jokes I have for the people on this is for Lenny Clarke.

124
00:08:07.681 --> 00:08:11.790
Cause I know Lenny and I love Lenny.
So I've got stories.

125
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.150
I know what he's done.
I got all this stuff I could shit on a,

126
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.720
I have more shit about Lenny Clarke than I do.

127
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.320
You know Greg Koski is a tough one too because everyone's going to Gog.

128
00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:29.320
He's fucking stupid.
So I'm trying to think of another angle.
Um,

129
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.680
so really isn't one something about spike in a baby.
I have no idea.

130
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.690
Um,
so

131
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.190
<v 0>okay,</v>

132
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.740
<v 1>I'm a,
I'm a little amped up for this thing.
A little nervous.
The laptop.</v>

133
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:41.501
I can't fucking wait.

134
00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:43.840
All I know is this is one of these deals where it's just like,

135
00:08:43.841 --> 00:08:45.490
just fucking bring me up,

136
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.840
bring me up so I can do this thing and then I can relax.

137
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:54.990
Then I can relax.
It's all I need to do.
I just got to get through.

138
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.090
Just get through tonight,
tonight,
tonight.

139
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.530
Whoa.
Then it's easy.
Then there,
it's fucking easy.

140
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:09.030
I go back to my regularly scheduled standup dates,
you know,
God willing,

141
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:11.370
we'll get a third season of f is for family.

142
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:15.330
I've already been through that shit twice.
I'm right back into my comfort zone,

143
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.390
you know?
So I got here last night and um,

144
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.720
you know,
I it over to the fucking um,

145
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.350
laugh Boston cause everybody was going over to their,

146
00:09:27.351 --> 00:09:30.110
run their row shit and I didn't want to do that.
I uh,

147
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:35.900
I just wanted to do stand up,
just go up there and be funny,
you know,
warm up,

148
00:09:35.901 --> 00:09:38.780
loosen up a little bit.
And then tonight I'll just fucking do the jokes.

149
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.780
That is the game plan.

150
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:46.730
I'm going gonna have it printed out nice and fucking big.

151
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.110
The font is going to be nice and big,

152
00:09:48.111 --> 00:09:49.970
so there's no way for me to fuck these things up.

153
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.900
And I'm just going to go right down the Deus.
I figure a,
there's like fucking,

154
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:59.600
we going to get,
we got Adam Ray,
we had,
we had fucking uh,
Susie soliloquy.

155
00:09:59.601 --> 00:10:04.190
We got a Mikey monologue,
the story about,
uh,

156
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.010
like eight or nine fucking bad.
Do a minute on everybody.
I'm done.

157
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.060
But I got to do David the fucking longest.
So I got,
I got,
you know,

158
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.610
he's actually surprisingly not that hard to row and all the shit that he did.

159
00:10:16.611 --> 00:10:18.410
You know you can,
you can get that guy pretty good.

160
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.920
Dry is difficult once you just get past,
you know,
he's just a little fella,

161
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.610
you know?
Then it's like,
well now what do I do now for Christ's sake?

162
00:10:25.611 --> 00:10:27.050
Who's texting me now?
Huh.

163
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.163
<v 0>Okay.</v>

164
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.530
<v 1>Anyways,
um,
yes.
And then once I get through that,</v>

165
00:10:33.531 --> 00:10:38.390
the rest of the year is downhill,
you know,
down fucking hill,

166
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.730
you know,
and I've already worked at,
I'm thinking if I get,

167
00:10:40.731 --> 00:10:44.660
if we get a third season,
all right,
I'll get up early in the morning.

168
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:45.540
<v 0>Okay.</v>

169
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.800
<v 1>Right.
Spent some time with my daughter and then uh,</v>

170
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.320
I'll go over to the little fucking rehearsal place,
you know,

171
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:54.690
I'll do my little drum drum drum in there,
and then I go over,

172
00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:59.300
I fucking write the shit,
then I'm home.
That's the game plan.
Then I get home,

173
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:03.420
take the daughter of walk around the block some point me and my wife pass each

174
00:11:03.421 --> 00:11:05.910
other in the halls with like,
who are you again?
Oh,
that's right.

175
00:11:05.911 --> 00:11:08.640
We're married and then that'll be my year.

176
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:15.440
So why give you a kiss after the loving

177
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.730
Inglebert?
Humperdink who fucking,
no.

178
00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:30.200
Oh No.
Um,
who knew that that was going to be in my fucking head today?

179
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.240
I had no idea.
So anyways,

180
00:11:32.241 --> 00:11:35.840
one of my new hobbies when I'm on the road is,
uh,

181
00:11:35.841 --> 00:11:40.841
I watch Fox News and I watch CNN and I just flipped back and forth between them.

182
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.150
It is fucking fascinating.
Like,

183
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.540
I don't even know what those channels have become.

184
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.510
I don't know what they ever were,
but it is not news.

185
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.520
They're basically yelling at each other now

186
00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.730
that's so fucking,
it's like,
it's like you're watching a sitcom,

187
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.470
you know?
All right,
here's,
here's the idea.
Here's the pitch for the show.

188
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.100
This does two news channels once conservative,

189
00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:10.810
and this one's liberal.

190
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:17.550
I was watching that a Sean Hannity Guy and one of his stories was a story about

191
00:12:18.641 --> 00:12:22.870
somebody on CNN.
You know,
though,
check what the,
uh,

192
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:26.530
the Mary Lou Retton haircut whenever her fucking name is the one who cried when

193
00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:30.640
Trump got fucking elected,
which really was a low point in journalism.

194
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.210
Hilary lost,
she didn't get assassinated.

195
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.300
Jesus Christ even fucking what's his face held it together when he said,

196
00:12:37.301 --> 00:12:42.160
JFK got killed.
It's a fucking,
Donald Trump gets elected.

197
00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:46.120
You fucking sitting there blubbering for God's sakes,
woman,

198
00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:50.080
get a hold of yourself.
So anyways,
uh,

199
00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:52.340
<v 6>okay.</v>

200
00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:52.850
<v 1>Um,</v>

201
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:57.850
he fucking was saying he's cast her picture up there and it says conspiracy

202
00:12:57.941 --> 00:12:58.774
theory.

203
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:00.723
<v 6>MMM.</v>

204
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.960
<v 1>Cause of whatever the fuck she said.
I don't,
I don't even know.</v>

205
00:13:03.961 --> 00:13:05.070
I'm just sitting there going like,

206
00:13:05.071 --> 00:13:09.450
this fucking guy is doing a new story about a news person on another channel.

207
00:13:09.451 --> 00:13:10.500
This is news.

208
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.110
When I was growing up,
like,
you know,
I,

209
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.160
Tom Brokaw was not doing stories about Sam Donaldson.

210
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:22.170
<v 6>Okay.</v>

211
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.140
<v 1>You know when only white men gave the noobs no,
I'm kidding.</v>

212
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.060
Um,
I have no idea.
I don't know you,

213
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.490
I just don't know what the fuck it is anymore,
but I got to tell you,

214
00:13:35.491 --> 00:13:37.950
it's really entertaining.
You've got to do it.
People,

215
00:13:37.951 --> 00:13:40.500
you got to step out of this fucking liberal conservative thing.

216
00:13:40.501 --> 00:13:44.710
You've got to just step back and just enjoy it for what it is.
Um,

217
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.030
it is just a bunch of people who have just disappeared.

218
00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.560
I don't there.
They all need like a fuck.
They all,

219
00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:57.670
every one of them needs to take like two years off,
you know what I mean?

220
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.440
And I think they should send them all at first to separate places and then you

221
00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:07.210
gradually get 'em reacclimated as human beings.
Right.

222
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:09.520
And he just kind of take,
sent them to like a camp.

223
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.200
Maybe they start playing a softball game,
but you know,
it's not Fox News for CNN.

224
00:14:14.201 --> 00:14:15.700
You've got to mix up the players,

225
00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.253
<v 6>you know?</v>

226
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.300
<v 1>I mean,
it'll ruin the rivalry.
Like,
you know,</v>

227
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:22.740
<v 6>yeah.</v>

228
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.430
<v 1>When the NHL went to Russia to play the Russians and all those fucking,
you know,</v>

229
00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:29.100
the ranges were hanging out with the Bruins and the flyers were hanging,

230
00:14:29.101 --> 00:14:32.580
you know,
it just,
people started getting drunk together.
Eh,
you know,

231
00:14:32.581 --> 00:14:34.860
you're all right.
You know,
it kind of ruins it.

232
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:36.483
<v 6>But,
um,</v>

233
00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.600
<v 1>Fox News was going off,
you know,
that auto warm beer story,</v>

234
00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:42.310
that fucking horrific fucking story.

235
00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.023
<v 6>MMM.</v>

236
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:50.050
<v 1>You know,
everybody like judging the guy going,
boy,
Yo,</v>

237
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:52.270
what the fuck he take fucking poster for?

238
00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.173
<v 6>Uh,</v>

239
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.640
<v 1>it's like anytime there's posters at my shows,
people always take him.</v>

240
00:14:57.641 --> 00:15:00.520
It's the end of the show.
It gives a fuck something you do,

241
00:15:00.521 --> 00:15:04.240
you grab a little souvenir,
whatever.
I mean,
technically it's stealing,

242
00:15:04.241 --> 00:15:05.620
but who gives a fuck?
I mean,
does that,

243
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.190
is that enough warranted to give guy 15 years hard labor.

244
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:13.810
He was there because of our foreign policy,
you know?

245
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:15.950
That's why they don't like that,

246
00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.620
that we're this and they're that and we're fucking economic sanctions and all

247
00:15:20.621 --> 00:15:21.910
that shit.
They don't like it.

248
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.153
<v 6>MMM.</v>

249
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.660
<v 1>Like how I just said that to you guys.
Like that's actual news.</v>

250
00:15:27.661 --> 00:15:30.930
So Fox News was doing this thing where they were like,

251
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.250
they were going back and looking at shit that,

252
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:40.340
like some chick said on Huffington post and this Guy Larry Wilmore,

253
00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.620
what the fuck he said,
but he first did,
he did a bit about like a,
you know,

254
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.240
you know,
call him the frat boy and like,

255
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.490
basically they didn't have any sympathy for the guy,
you know?

256
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:55.520
But now it plays out way weirder because the fucking Dick kid got killed over

257
00:15:57.421 --> 00:15:59.190
there,
so they're sitting there,
you know,

258
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.600
the whole fucking thing was just fascinating to watch and like Fox News and she

259
00:16:02.601 --> 00:16:05.960
was like,
these people are terrible bla bla bla that Dah Dah Dah.
You know,
and,

260
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.430
and just taking it kind of like at face value,

261
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.540
not taking into how was written,
why it was written.

262
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.270
I think everybody's fucked up in it to be honest with you.

263
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.790
I think it's fucked up to do that white privilege thing.
I understand it,

264
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:26.170
but the uh,
yeah,

265
00:16:26.171 --> 00:16:28.000
I get that whole thing.
Well look what he deals with,

266
00:16:28.001 --> 00:16:30.820
we deal with in this country.
It's something you can understand.

267
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.930
I am that which I get that point.
But uh,

268
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:41.210
I dunno when you take it to the point of having a little bit of joy about it,

269
00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:45.740
which I probably would if I was on the other side because I am not a,
a,

270
00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:50.390
a mature human being and I have anger issues.

271
00:16:50.391 --> 00:16:53.340
I know that I would probably be coming at it like that too.
But it's,

272
00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.440
it takes a lot to have empathy.
That's what I've learned.
You know what I mean?

273
00:16:57.441 --> 00:17:00.800
Because as much as that chick on the Huffington post was making some good
points,

274
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.860
it's like,
well,
I don't see empathy on your side though,

275
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:08.480
and I'm not talking about towards white people.
It's like,

276
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:12.540
look at your fucking clothes.
As you're saying,

277
00:17:12.541 --> 00:17:14.280
I'm complicit in your suffering.

278
00:17:14.281 --> 00:17:16.560
What about the people that make you fucking clothes?
Yeah.

279
00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:17.820
<v 0>Okay,</v>

280
00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.500
<v 1>I'll let sweatshop fucking labor.</v>

281
00:17:19.501 --> 00:17:22.470
Do you think about the five year old that sewed your fucking skirt together?

282
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:27.360
You don't give a fuck to you too busy focused on,
that's what human beings do.

283
00:17:27.361 --> 00:17:29.490
We focus on our shit.

284
00:17:29.491 --> 00:17:32.460
That's what I learned watching CNN all when I watched all these fucking white

285
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:36.630
guys.
I
say this about this other white guy.

286
00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.510
They're all up in fucking arms,
the same fucking people,

287
00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.800
the same kind of white people that when somebody black gets shot,

288
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.600
oh well I'll just see.
I'll just do what the police say.
You'll be fine.
Duh.

289
00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:48.960
You know,
stop wearing hoodies.
You know,
they just,

290
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.670
then they just fucking get on with their lives.

291
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.010
Now all of a sudden they're fucking up in arms.

292
00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.520
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

293
00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.750
<v 1>About this fucking dude.</v>

294
00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.243
<v 6>You know?</v>

295
00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.650
<v 1>But that's what people do though.
So I just kinda saw it.
Second,
you don't,</v>

296
00:18:01.651 --> 00:18:04.570
what you do is you insert yourself into the situation.

297
00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.320
And if you see a white person and you're white,
you go,
oh my God,
that's terrible.

298
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:13.300
That could have been me.
I think,
you know,
maybe white people,

299
00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:16.210
black people also need to be sent away.
You don't separate it at first,

300
00:18:16.211 --> 00:18:20.290
then we all just,
you know,
kind of mix up and play softball to go.
Right.

301
00:18:20.291 --> 00:18:22.090
But that doesn't work because look at that guy and the eagles.

302
00:18:22.091 --> 00:18:26.040
He went to that country fucking concert and he starts dropping the n word.

303
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.153
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

304
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.090
<v 1>You know,
I don't think these robots come and it's gonna be a bad thing.</v>

305
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:33.540
<v 6>Okay.</v>

306
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.070
<v 1>You know,
it'd be weird if good,
good.</v>

307
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.210
Maybe there'll be like improved human beings.

308
00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:38.590
<v 6>Okay.</v>

309
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.720
<v 1>You know,
it'd be fucking weird is if they actually,</v>

310
00:18:40.721 --> 00:18:45.100
they made them so fucking life like that.

311
00:18:45.101 --> 00:18:49.150
That'd be like fucking racist robot.
You know,
just walking him back.

312
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.770
Use paypal dot walk to work.

313
00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:56.653
<v 6>MMM.</v>

314
00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:02.290
<v 1>A jury of your peers has fucking convicted,</v>

315
00:19:02.291 --> 00:19:04.480
you know,
actually if you just kind of,
I mean,

316
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:09.220
because the story's kind of like losing momentum,
but if you just watch it,

317
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.233
<v 6>mmm.</v>

318
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.500
<v 1>And you just listened to people too.</v>

319
00:19:14.501 --> 00:19:18.310
They just see the world out there own fucking head and they just talk.

320
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:20.503
<v 6>Uh,</v>

321
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.620
<v 1>I don't think they talk and you just fucking sit there and,
and join it.</v>

322
00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:24.963
<v 6>Like</v>

323
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:30.020
<v 1>the people that fucking white dudes on Fox News are the widest.</v>

324
00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:32.680
They look like,
you know,

325
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.110
when they make those coming of age movies in the 80s and there'd be those

326
00:19:36.111 --> 00:19:38.630
fucking a preppy frat boy guys.

327
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:40.890
<v 6>Okay.</v>

328
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.690
<v 1>Like you looking at him going like,
dude,
I,
I,</v>

329
00:19:42.691 --> 00:19:46.340
you do you seriously dress like that man?

330
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:51.430
I guess this is sort of fucking
judging them too,
but like,

331
00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.950
there's one guy on there,
it's just like,
dude,

332
00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:59.010
you look like the date rape is slash your girlfriend died during air quote rough

333
00:20:00.761 --> 00:20:01.594
sex.

334
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:06.550
She was into it and it got carried away that this is what that guy looks like.

335
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:11.650
Um,
I dunno,

336
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.320
the whole fucking thing is just,
it's a weird thing,
but,
uh,

337
00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.210
what I have learned is people,
uh,

338
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.830
the suffering they see is their own suffering and it's very hard to look at

339
00:20:20.831 --> 00:20:24.640
other people's suffering and to try to,
you know,

340
00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:27.940
take time out of your day to understand that regardless of what color you are.

341
00:20:27.941 --> 00:20:30.380
I was kind of what I learned from that.
And,

342
00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.710
and people who actually do are way beyond me.

343
00:20:34.711 --> 00:20:35.970
And then beyond that,

344
00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:39.990
people who then fucking try to do something about it,

345
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.833
<v 6>you know,</v>

346
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.220
<v 1>like someone who would actually try to do something about sweatshop labor going</v>

347
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.990
like,
all right,
well,
I'm only going to buy clothes that are in this country.

348
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.340
I tried to do that for a second.

349
00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:55.840
And I did that like fucking 15 years ago when the options were ridiculous.

350
00:20:55.841 --> 00:20:58.540
I was like,
I'm not wearing that out to a comedy club.
I'm going to get destroyed.

351
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.410
So I said to hell with these fucking kids who sewed together my shirts.

352
00:21:02.411 --> 00:21:06.130
I was protecting myself when I was going down to the cellar because I didn't

353
00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:07.000
want to get trashed.

354
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.360
<v 6>Okay.</v>

355
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:13.410
<v 1>So I guess I'm saying I'm a selfish piece of shit.
I think that's what I learned.</v>

356
00:21:13.411 --> 00:21:14.910
Watch enough.
Fox and CNN.

357
00:21:14.911 --> 00:21:19.290
I think I saw a lot of myself like these guys that just fucking into their own

358
00:21:19.291 --> 00:21:23.100
dealer chicken,
the Huffington Post,
completely 100% into her own fucking deal.

359
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:24.873
<v 6>You know</v>

360
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:27.740
<v 1>the whole fucking world.</v>

361
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:28.610
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

362
00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:32.860
<v 1>The same way with those Fox News guys.
The entire world is the way she sees it.</v>

363
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.640
<v 6>Okay.</v>

364
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.451
<v 1>And those guys,</v>

365
00:21:34.451 --> 00:21:39.310
the entire world is the way that they see it and they just cannot fucking on any

366
00:21:39.311 --> 00:21:42.700
other level fathom.
Any others,
any other reality

367
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.110
<v 6>out there?
You know,</v>

368
00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.800
<v 1>I think a lot of times I listened to feminist,</v>

369
00:21:49.801 --> 00:21:53.010
I just listened to what they say and I just switch around a couple pronouns

370
00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.410
<v 6>from,
from</v>

371
00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.570
<v 1>men,
you know,
he to her.</v>

372
00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.230
<v 6>Okay.</v>

373
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.880
<v 1>And it's just like you literally,</v>

374
00:22:00.881 --> 00:22:05.500
if I fucking took what you just said and I took out all the men,

375
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.610
I just replaced it with women in her and I swear to God you would sound like a

376
00:22:09.611 --> 00:22:14.460
Trump supporter.
All right.
I'm off my fucking soapbox.
All right.

377
00:22:14.461 --> 00:22:16.500
I was up there for a minute.
Now I'm off it.

378
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.770
What I'm really trying to say is you got to fucking watch Fox and CNN and pull

379
00:22:19.771 --> 00:22:21.180
yourself out of it.
You know what I mean?

380
00:22:21.181 --> 00:22:24.150
It's like your team got knocked out of the playoffs and you just sit there and

381
00:22:24.151 --> 00:22:24.984
you just watch it.

382
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.410
<v 6>Okay.</v>

383
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:30.280
<v 1>And just watching these fucking people like it's not,
none of it is news anymore.</v>

384
00:22:30.281 --> 00:22:31.900
It's just like a,

385
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:34.620
<v 6>yeah,</v>

386
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.740
<v 1>I don't,
I don't know what it is.
It's,
it's their fucking opinions.</v>

387
00:22:37.741 --> 00:22:42.450
It's like two op ed channels.
It's like everybody's Andy Rooney,

388
00:22:42.451 --> 00:22:44.970
except there's no humor in it anymore and they're just fucking,

389
00:22:44.971 --> 00:22:48.810
I guess I'm doing that now.
My podcast,
like it's affected make built.
Where's,

390
00:22:48.811 --> 00:22:52.530
where's,
where's the silly jokes?
You know what?

391
00:22:52.531 --> 00:22:56.730
Maybe I'm out of jokes.
I don't have any fucking jokes left.

392
00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:00.000
I so want to read you guys some of these fucking jokes.

393
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.240
I'm going to blame David Ortiz for childhood obesity.

394
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:14.640
There's one for you.
Oh,

395
00:23:14.641 --> 00:23:19.020
the red sox.
Oh yeah.
I got some good shit for them.
Just to general.

396
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:20.260
<v 6>Okay.</v>

397
00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:23.250
<v 1>I don't have a lot of [inaudible] stuff.
Gronk House.
He's hard to cause.</v>

398
00:23:23.251 --> 00:23:26.160
I am going on last and I know everybody's going to be,
eh,

399
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.380
not saying this guy's dumb,
buttery pecan.

400
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:33.340
We'll go and any a walker and then I'd be like,
God,
fuck,
I can't do that joke.

401
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:34.263
Now what do I do?

402
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:35.963
<v 6>MMM.</v>

403
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:41.160
<v 1>I Dunno.
I'll figure it out.
And worst case scenario,</v>

404
00:23:41.161 --> 00:23:43.200
I bomb and it's over in 10 minutes.
And then what do we do?

405
00:23:43.201 --> 00:23:46.270
I just slowly walk out of the fucking room,
you know?

406
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.240
But I can't drink myself into a stupor,
you know?
Why?
Cause all Billie,
no fun

407
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.610
Billy.
No Fun.
That's right on and off.
Billy is what I really am.

408
00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:01.420
Since I decided to be billing.
No Fun.
I've drank Saturday and Sunday,

409
00:24:01.421 --> 00:24:05.890
both weekends and I have not drank Monday through Friday.
So,
um,

410
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.200
I'm not drinking tonight.
That'll be four days in a row.
I won't drink tomorrow.

411
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.610
And uh,
then I'll fly back Saturday.
I'm not going to drink that day.

412
00:24:16.611 --> 00:24:19.520
I think I'll be good.
I've got to put a good two week fucking run together.

413
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:24.230
Maybe not quite as the following weekend.
I'm working with version.

414
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:29.940
Um,
who knows.
I don't know,

415
00:24:29.941 --> 00:24:33.540
but I got it.
I got it dialed down though.
I got it back under control.

416
00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:38.510
I like to think,
you know,
cause I said,
so I'm going to Billy.
Yay.

417
00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.890
All right.
We're,
I'm going to give myself a chip.

418
00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:46.170
Every five days I get a chip and then I get a drink.
That's how my Aa works,

419
00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.453
you know?

420
00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:50.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

421
00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.590
<v 1>That's the problem with addicts.
It's just so all or nothing.</v>

422
00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.710
It's why they fucking miserable.
So,
so I need,
you just have like a glass of wine.

423
00:24:58.711 --> 00:25:02.880
It just fucking relax.
All right.
You're gluttonous.
Psychopath.

424
00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:07.350
I'm not a fan of addicts.
I'm really not.
Most,
some of them are cool,

425
00:25:07.351 --> 00:25:08.184
but in general,

426
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:11.600
there's some of the most selfish fucking people you ever going to meet on,
on,

427
00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.500
on the face of the fucking earth.

428
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:18.210
And they got that built in fucking excuse.
Uh,
it's not me.

429
00:25:18.211 --> 00:25:23.100
It's the addiction.
So I love South Park.
They're like,
no,

430
00:25:23.101 --> 00:25:26.910
no,
no,
no.
But,
but you did that.
You,
it's not me.
It's the disease,

431
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:31.650
the fuck out of here.
Every time it's disease.

432
00:25:31.651 --> 00:25:36.520
It's never you just never you.
Um,

433
00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:36.901
all right.

434
00:25:36.901 --> 00:25:39.660
I think I've said enough stuff to offend people here that I get some fucking

435
00:25:39.661 --> 00:25:43.850
emails.
All right,
let's uh,
let's read a little bit of advertising here.
Um,
yeah,

436
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:47.660
five,
four club,
uh,
looking good.

437
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.100
Doesn't need to cost a fortune because five,

438
00:25:50.101 --> 00:25:55.101
four club is revolutionizing the way men shop at five folk club.

439
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:59.170
They found a way to make great looking clothes affordable for everyone.

440
00:25:59.171 --> 00:26:02.170
Can I say the name of their fucking entity?
One more time.

441
00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:05.380
Why wasted at the mall or wandering around in the stores?

442
00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:08.890
Each month they send you a curated box.

443
00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.760
It's one of the most overused fucking words ever.
Curated box.
You know,

444
00:26:12.761 --> 00:26:16.530
like they seize fucking geniuses staring at sure.
Yeah.
Shirts,

445
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.040
Eh,
give him a couple of stripes in a fucking Polka dot.

446
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.140
You guys want to get some lunch?

449
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:32.880

450
00:26:32.881 --> 00:26:34.350
quality as top designers.

They've been helping men with fashion for over 15 years.

452
00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.670
15 years.
I never fucking heard of these guys.
Where the hell you been doing it?

453
00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:46.260
It's been a covert and to ship to over 100,000 men every month.

454
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:51.290

455
00:26:52.171 --> 00:26:56.100
vice and instyle among other publications.
They know what they're doing.

456
00:26:56.101 --> 00:26:59.070
So if you don't,
that's so okay.

478
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:14.300
Lift everybody lift this CNN of ride shares.

479
00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.890
Um,
that's why I look at it.
The other one that rhymes with mover,

480
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.600
they like the Fox News.
You know,
they don't give a fuck,
right?
If you're white,

481
00:28:22.601 --> 00:28:25.690
get in the fucking car.
We don't give a shit what your priors are.
Lift.

482
00:28:25.691 --> 00:28:29.560
It's like wait a minute,
have you done anything bad?

483
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.540
Cause if you did something bad,
that would really be be at,

484
00:28:33.541 --> 00:28:38.430
if you were driving people around,
you know,
move her,
doesn't give a shit.

485
00:28:38.431 --> 00:28:39.720
Right?
They don't give a fuck.

486
00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:41.770
<v 0>Okay.</v>

487
00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:44.710
<v 1>All they need is white skin and a little bit of freckles and your fucking hard.</v>

488
00:28:44.711 --> 00:28:48.910
And that's a guy.
That's the truth.
I think they were actually Nazi hunters.

489
00:28:48.911 --> 00:28:53.020
So looking into see who runs that fucking company.
I'm just saying all right,

490
00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:57.700
but lift,
lift.
These are the nice people.
Live knows that their drivers,

491
00:28:57.701 --> 00:28:59.170
your what keeps them moving.

492
00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:03.790
So they do everything they can to make sure their drivers are happy on every

493
00:29:03.791 --> 00:29:08.020
trip.
Lyft is to ride sharing company that believes in cheating.

494
00:29:08.021 --> 00:29:09.070
Peep it's people.

495
00:29:09.071 --> 00:29:14.071
Better lift believes that being a ride sharing drivers should be fun if you're

496
00:29:15.251 --> 00:29:20.150
having a good time.
So the tasks and juries should I be,

497
00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.200
I should be wearing sandals.

498
00:29:21.201 --> 00:29:24.920
When I read this sitting fucking in the Lotus position,
lift was,
uh,

499
00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:29.840
was the first to offer in APP tipping.
When you drive for Lyft,
Lyft,

500
00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:31.730
you keep 100% of the tips.

501
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.620
Drivers have been paid over 200 million and tips since the feature was

502
00:29:36.621 --> 00:29:41.240
introduced and a 170 million of that was spent on yoga classes.

503
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:46.480
The restaurant Tofu express pay lets drivers get paid almost instantly instead

504
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:49.900
of waiting weeks.
Live has even taking the guesswork out of pickups.

505
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.910
The new amp device uses color coded coding to help passengers find their

506
00:29:54.911 --> 00:29:58.540
drivers.
Uh,
you can earn hundreds of dollars a week plus tips,

507
00:29:58.541 --> 00:30:00.400
want to earn more money,
drive more.

508
00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:04.720
It's never been easier to give yourself a race.
It's a simple formula.

509
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:07.300
Happy drivers means happy passengers.

510
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:12.340
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 Lyft rides get a perfect five star rating.

511
00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:16.720
Go to lift.com/bird today and gear.
Yay.
Yay.

512
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:21.580
And you get up $500 dot.

Brds Biondi.
Oh,

517
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:44.170
I can't do that.
I was,
uh,
why was going to say that?
Oh,
I can't do that one.

518
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.300
I thought about that kid and fucking Korea.
I can't do that one.
See,

519
00:30:48.301 --> 00:30:51.310
this is the dangers of this.
You got to have that worked out.
All right,

520
00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.800
let's start over again.
What's something a lot more safer?

521
00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:59.560
Mandy's me undies laying here and dirty socks.
Doo,
Doo,
Doo doot me undies.

522
00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.750
Mandy's velvet up against my cook.

523
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.350
I love where to put those two fucking drawers on.

524
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.060
My name is bill.
It isn't one.
I don't know.
All right.

525
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:14.680
Elevate your underwear game to the next time,
to the next level with me undies.

526
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.350
You've perfected your wardrobe.
But what about this stuff?

527
00:31:17.351 --> 00:31:18.850
Not everybody gets to see.

528
00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:23.770
We're talking about your balls here and your Dick or you clamp,

529
00:31:23.771 --> 00:31:26.470
whatever he got down there.
Maybe a hermaphrodite.
Maybe you have all three.

530
00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:31.180
You know when it be nice if there was something nice and soft up against it of

531
00:31:31.181 --> 00:31:34.840
your choosing.
I'm not talking about taking the subway during rush hour either.

532
00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:38.620
All right.
If you've been settling for store bought underwear,
five packs,

533
00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.660
I have something that will change your life for the better me undies.

534
00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.110
I don't understand why you're settling for store bought underwear.

535
00:31:44.111 --> 00:31:48.660
Like that's a difficult thing to fucking do.
I guess going to the mall can suck,

536
00:31:48.661 --> 00:31:50.400
right?
Especially on black Friday.

537
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.010
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

538

<v 1>What's the first thing you put on the last thing you take off?</v>

539
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:55.490

modal,

544
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:15.410
a fabric three times softer than cotton.
Cotton coffin,

545
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:19.780

Luxury underwear.

547
00:32:23.031 --> 00:32:28.010
bold shades and adventurous patterns.
What do you get a tiger on your dick?

548
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:32.630
So you can trade,
tailor your undies to your own personal style.
And guess what?

549
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:36.380
You can save time and money each month with a monthly subscription.

550
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:41.240

This fucking Jimmy Dore,

557
00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:06.980
Jimmy Dore unlike me,
is actually informed.
And um,

558
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:12.590
he was calling somebody out on just fucking doing all these Trump jokes and was

559
00:33:12.591 --> 00:33:14.390
just calling him like a corporate liberal.

560
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.900
Just acting as though all of this shit didn't exist during the Obama presidency.

561
00:33:21.711 --> 00:33:25.430
All of these,
you know,
people upside down in houses,

562
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.400
these never ending fucking wars.
All of this shit.

563

Everybody gets all amped up about ties.

566
00:33:37.951 --> 00:33:41.850
but I'm considering moving my operation over there because youtube is a fucking

567
00:33:41.851 --> 00:33:42.684
rip off.

568
00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:43.760
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

569
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.420
<v 1>there are a bunch of goddamn thieves.</v>

570
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:47.323
<v 6>MMM.</v>

571
00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.790
<v 1>I told you the deal over there.
If,
if your video gets flagged,</v>

572
00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:55.230
then you don't get the advertising money yet.
They still play the ads.

573
00:33:55.231 --> 00:33:58.170
So it's like,
well,
who gets the money then?
They try.
Oh no,
nobody gets it.

574
00:33:58.171 --> 00:33:59.730
Really see it.
They get free ads.

575
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.970
So what's stopping the advertisers from flagging every video?

576
00:34:02.971 --> 00:34:05.190
They bought time on that full of Shit.

577
00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.233
<v 6>MMM.</v>

578
00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.060
<v 1>So I'm thinking of pulling my channel and putting it somewhere else.</v>

579
00:34:11.061 --> 00:34:13.580
I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck to do.
Who knows?
All right.

580
00:34:13.581 --> 00:34:14.840
Simply safe everybody.

581
00:34:14.841 --> 00:34:19.841
You can rest easy when you protect your home and family with simply safe.

582
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:23.450
When you install your simply safe home security system,

583
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:25.530
you're arming your home with a powerful,

584
00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:29.450
powerful sensors that tell you if a door opens or a window breaks.

585
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:34.690
It's a burglar's worst nightmare
is it?

586
00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:38.590
I mean,
I think having like,
you know,
I was always thinking,

587
00:34:38.591 --> 00:34:43.330
what if you had like one of the most poisonous snakes in the world,
right?

588
00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:47.230
In the world world world,
right.
And then when you leave at night,

589
00:34:47.231 --> 00:34:50.800
right before you leave,
you fucking,
you let the thing loose in your house.

590
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:54.790
I'm of course not really thinking this through of like eventually I have to come

591
00:34:54.791 --> 00:34:59.080
home,
but because I never fantasize pass the person coming in,
you know,

592
00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.620
and the guys like trying to Jimmy the lock in is,
is doing it.

593
00:35:02.621 --> 00:35:07.000
That fucking Cobra comes up,
you know,
doing this little fucking,
you know,

594
00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:11.350
dance right.
The snake,
you know,
just wait for that guy and the guy comes in,

595
00:35:11.351 --> 00:35:14.940
he sneaks in and think it is just fucking bite some,

596
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:18.670
I have a black Mamba in there or some shit.

597
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.920
<v 6>Okay.</v>

598
00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.690
<v 1>Then you come home with like your fucking beekeeper suit on going here.
Sneaky.</v>

599
00:35:25.691 --> 00:35:27.940
Sneaky.
Sneaky.
Sneaky,
sneaky.
Or you know what?
You can do it.

600
00:35:27.941 --> 00:35:29.140
You just get simply safe.

601
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:30.750
<v 6>Okay?</v>

602
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:31.890
<v 1>That would be the worst nightmare.</v>

603
00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.630
You know what about a Komodo dragon and it just bite your leg and then just

604
00:35:36.631 --> 00:35:41.300
follows around the house to you.
Fucking start.
Collapse starts eating your guts.

605
00:35:41.301 --> 00:35:43.230
I mean that w I think that would be a worst nightmare,

606
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:48.910
but evidently simply safe is right up there with Comodo drift.

607
00:35:48.911 --> 00:35:52.330
You can't afford a Komodo dragon or don't have a black Mamba guy.

608
00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.280
Simply safe is what you want.

609
00:35:54.281 --> 00:35:58.870
There's 105 decibel siren that alerts you at the first sign of trouble.

610
00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:03.820
You'll have a dedicated team of security professionals watching over you.

611
00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:08.770
You 24 seven ready to send the police.
What do you got,

612
00:36:08.771 --> 00:36:09.604
Kevin Costner?

613
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.110
Is he going to carry me out as I nuzzle into the side of his neck was simply

614
00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:18.850
there is no longterm contracts or hidden fees.

615
00:36:18.851 --> 00:36:23.020
And around the clock monitoring is only 1,499 a month.

616
00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.900
Call to action.
Set on.
Spend another night.

617
00:36:25.901 --> 00:36:29.740
Second guessing your home safety gets simply safe and get some rest.

618
00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:34.540
Go to simply say [inaudible] dot com I'm just picturing with 105 decibel alarm

619
00:36:34.541 --> 00:36:38.500
goes up and you fucking shoot up in bed with an absolute panic going,

620
00:36:38.501 --> 00:36:42.880
please let that be a squirreled.
It just bounced off my fucking window.
Um,

621
00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:48.240
you don't want to eat.
And why doesn't everybody have a panic room?

622
00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.040
Just sleep and that.
Fuck.
Then I'd be,

623
00:36:52.041 --> 00:36:55.730
if my panic would be that the fucking door wouldn't open up and I'd be in there

624
00:36:55.731 --> 00:36:59.570
in this fucking airtight,
well not air tight,

625
00:36:59.571 --> 00:37:01.160
but soundproof fucking room.

626
00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:07.810
Then he had some cheesy headline after I fucking died.
Right.

627
00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.500
Panic room turns into actual panic room.

628
00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:18.440
I'm sorry.
That's simply safe.
[inaudible] dot com for 10% off your order.

629
00:37:18.441 --> 00:37:22.370
It's simply safe.com.
It's s,
I,
m p l,
I,

630
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:27.800
safe.com.
Is there a reason why they always misspell the words of their company?

631
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:30.350
Is that because every website's taken at this point?

632
00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:31.950
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

633
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:32.430
<v 1>You know,</v>

634
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:37.430
go to [inaudible] dot com B I.

635
00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:44.100
L l E.
Bill Lee burb.
Um,
all right.
How much time have I done?

636
00:37:44.101 --> 00:37:47.700
Yeah.
Oh,
37 minutes.
Well,
you know what?
Usually,

637
00:37:47.701 --> 00:37:49.650
I'd give you a little more fucking freebies here,

638
00:37:49.651 --> 00:37:52.050
but I've got to go back to writing,
which I really don't want to do.

639
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:54.300
<v 6>Uh</v>

640
00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:01.640
<v 1>Oh Jesus.
Well,
you know what,
I guess,
I guess that's what I gotta do here.
Uh,
I,</v>

641
00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:04.010
yeah,
I got to sit down and get through this fucking rough sting.

642
00:38:04.011 --> 00:38:07.550
I need more shit on Podria.
I need more shit on Gronk.

643
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:12.050
I mean,
where do you go?
Where do you go with either one of them?
I get it.

644
00:38:12.051 --> 00:38:15.050
He's little and he's dumb.
What else is there?

645
00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:20.910
What the fuck else is there?
Um,
all right.
That's the podcast for,

646
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.180
I was just checking it.
I'm just,
you know,
trying to get you home.
Okay.

647
00:38:23.181 --> 00:38:28.100
Now you can listen to some music and uh,
then we'll have,
uh,

648
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:32.300
some greatest hits from a podcast gone by from,
to Thursday,
from years ago.

649
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:35.000
I have no idea what Andrew Sam was,
who's gonna fucking pull,

650
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.550
but he always pulls up some good shit.

651
00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:40.300
I want to thank everybody who said that they had enjoyed listening to mute math.

652
00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:44.080
M.
U.
T e math,
mute math,
all one word.
They have a new album,

653
00:38:44.081 --> 00:38:45.970
you gotta check 'em out.
You got to see him live.

654
00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:47.990
You got to tell your friends are bottom.

655
00:38:47.991 --> 00:38:50.650
So you can be the cool person that told them that there's a band called mute

656
00:38:50.651 --> 00:38:53.590
math that that exists,
right?

657
00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.910
I'm telling you as great as your album,
Zahra,
never even fucking better live.

658
00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:00.670
Go check them out if you get a chance.
All right,
that's the Thursday afternoon,

659
00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:02.360
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

660
00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:06.120
<v 0>Have a great weekend.
You can't sell it.
You know how the race goes on Monday.</v>

661
00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.013
All right.
See you.

662
00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.330
I'm hoping not to see.

663
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:05.240
<v 8>Hold on.
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

664
00:40:05.241 --> 00:40:09.490
June 22nd,
2009.
And uh,

665
00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:13.530
I'm going to start this podcast by apologizing for not doing a pod,

666
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:15.800
not only not doing a podcast last week,

667
00:40:15.801 --> 00:40:20.801
but not even giving you guys the decency of sending out a bulletin with some

668
00:40:21.381 --> 00:40:25.070
sort of an explanation.
Um,
I dunno,

669
00:40:25.071 --> 00:40:27.160
I'm in New York right now and uh,

670
00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:32.160
I'm working on this movie thing and it's been raining and it's been a really,

671
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:34.460
it's rained like every fucking day.

672
00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:37.610
And it's really been affecting the way the whole shoot things going.

673
00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:43.010
So uh,
you know I had a lot of nights where I was walking in at about six in the

674
00:40:43.011 --> 00:40:47.150
morning and uh,
yeah it was that.

675
00:40:47.151 --> 00:40:50.180
And then also not to mention my flight didn't have batteries for my fucking

676
00:40:50.181 --> 00:40:53.570
recorder.
You know what other excuse do I have?

677
00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:57.980
Oh I also did a podcast for 25 minutes last Monday and realized that I didn't

678
00:40:57.981 --> 00:41:01.910
even have the fucking recorder on the dumb fuck that I am.

679
00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:05.330
Yes son fuck head daddy is.

680
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:09.110
Um Yeah so I didn't even have the goddamn thing on and I was meaning to buy

681
00:41:09.111 --> 00:41:13.370
batteries and I never did.
And basically I am Douche bag of the week.

682
00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.233
How do you like dad?

683
00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:18.470
I'm Douche bag of the week for not cause I didn't do a podcast.

684
00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:20.450
You know we all miss days at work.

685
00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:24.140
Hell a rod miss two days in a row because he was a little fatigued.

686
00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:28.430
Hey Jay was a little fatigued.
You know you make 200 fucking million dollars.

687
00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:32.120
You missed the first two months of the season cause you hips fucked up.
Cause,

688
00:41:32.121 --> 00:41:36.710
I dunno what,
you fucking stuck the needle in too far,
you know.

689
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:40.130
Oh Jesus.
That was a cheap shot.
I'll tell you guys right now.
Um,

690
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:44.450
as far as baseball goes,
um,
I'm already getting,

691
00:41:44.451 --> 00:41:48.650
I'm getting into golf and uh,
I'm preparing myself.

692
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:54.310
If one more fucking guy that I loved test positive for steroids,

693
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:59.570
there's one dude in particular.
If,
if he,
if they ever named his name,

694
00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.680
I am done with fucking baseball.
I'm not gonna say who it is that a respect.

695
00:42:03.681 --> 00:42:07.880
Most of you can probably guess who,
but uh,
I'm going to be done with the sport,

696
00:42:07.881 --> 00:42:12.590
so this is what I figure.
I figure basketball and hockey go,

697
00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.560
you know,
they go all the way into like the second week of June.

698
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:21.160
So then all I got to do is I just got to kill the last two weeks of June and the

699
00:42:22.071 --> 00:42:26.240
fucking in the four weeks of July,
that's all I have to kill.

700
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.460
And then,
then it's going to be pre season.

701
00:42:28.461 --> 00:42:32.480
Even then they got the hall of fame game,
right?
They got the hall of fame game.

702
00:42:32.481 --> 00:42:34.250
I think that's one is in July.

703
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.240
And then I'm good and I don't have to deal with baseball anymore because I
can't,

704
00:42:38.241 --> 00:42:41.570
I can't fucking take it anymore,
you know?
And believe me,

705
00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:45.050
I don't believe in Santa Clause.
I'm not like a fucking idiot.
But you know,

706
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:51.320
Sammy Sosa test positive.
What do you think about Sammy Sosa?
I mean,
I mean,

707
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:56.390
I think Barry bonds belongs in the hall of fame because of what the fuck he did

708
00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.930
before he became this roided out monster.
I mean,
the guy was,

709
00:42:59.931 --> 00:43:04.190
he was always a beast.
Then he turned into the hulk.
You know what I mean?

710
00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.710
So I mean,

711
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:11.000
whatever tea you say,
he's better than Babe Ruth.

712
00:43:11.001 --> 00:43:14.450
I wouldn't say that because Babe Ruth,
you know,
wasn't on juice.

713
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:17.090
But why wasn't Babe Ruth on juice?
You know why?

714
00:43:17.091 --> 00:43:18.800
Because they didn't have any juice back then.

715
00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.970
That guy was on the fucking sauce and he was eating fried chicken and he was

716
00:43:22.971 --> 00:43:25.970
date rape and checks on a fucking train on the way down to Baltimore.

717
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:28.970
That's what I read.
You know,
he's in the hall of fame.

718
00:43:28.971 --> 00:43:33.560
So why not Barry bonds and his huge fucking HGH head?

719
00:43:33.561 --> 00:43:35.390
Why can't he get in?
But Sammy Sosa,

720
00:43:35.391 --> 00:43:40.030
this is why I say no to that guy because that mother fucker was he,

721
00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:41.330
he wasn't anybody.

722
00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.360
And then all of a sudden he was somebody and then he was gone again.

723
00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:49.370
And not only did he do roids,
he got caught with a fucking corked bat.
Okay,

724
00:43:49.371 --> 00:43:51.980
what the fuck else do you need?
You know,

725
00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.300
what else do you fucking need at that point?

726
00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:00.810
Have your best friend fucking get on the mountain under hand the ball to you.

727
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:05.000
And that guy hit,
he had like,
what?
606 home runs?

728
00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:09.350
I think he hit like fucking 560 of them in a year and a half.

729
00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:13.850
Baseball's been Betty,
Betty Good to me.
Ah,
shut up.
Stupid.

730
00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:17.690
You're going to needle sticking out of your shirt pocket.
Um,
yeah.

731
00:44:17.691 --> 00:44:19.670
So I think I'm going to be,
I'm going to be done.

732
00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:24.800
I'm going to be done with baseball and be fucking,
I mean he'd done with it.

733
00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:28.190
One More fucking guy that I love.
Test positive,
you know,

734
00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:29.870
cause you know what you do.
I don't know about you guys,

735
00:44:29.871 --> 00:44:34.871
but I go back to to when I was chairing the player on and getting all excited

736
00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:38.280
and you just feel fucking stupid.
You know,

737
00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:43.380
I remember in 1998 who the fuck was watching baseball.

738
00:44:43.381 --> 00:44:47.220
Baseball was finished.
They still hadn't recovered from the strike.

739
00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.980
The only thing that was good that was going on was cal Ripken broke Lou Gehrig

740
00:44:50.981 --> 00:44:55.920
streak and then all of a sudden McGuire and Sosa having this home run fucking

741
00:44:55.921 --> 00:45:00.510
contest.
And I sat there like some depression.
Eric fucking kid,

742
00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:06.270
boy,
oh boy,
garlic GED.
Just see that one go over the fence.

743
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:13.380
I fucking scalped a ticket to go watch Mark McGuire hit his 28th home run

744
00:45:13.381 --> 00:45:17.280
against the San Diego Padres as they say up in Boston.

745
00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.930
I'm
fucking,
I I,
you know,

746
00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.000
sat in the upper deck and left field.

747
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:28.140
I watched him take batting practice was actually pretty funny cause at that

748
00:45:28.141 --> 00:45:31.440
point he was such a fucking rock star cause he had already come close to you

749
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:35.490
before.
This dude was such a fucking rockstar that half the stadium was full.

750
00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:36.660
Just to watch him.

751
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:41.220
We was was just to watch this guy take batting practice and he came up to the

752
00:45:41.221 --> 00:45:44.940
plate and he got a standing ovation like an hour before the game.

753
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:48.210
So everybody's waiting for him to fucking crush,
went over the wall.

754
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:49.350
And I'll never forget this.

755
00:45:49.351 --> 00:45:53.400
They pitched the first practice pitch in and he laid down a bunt and everybody

756
00:45:53.401 --> 00:45:57.840
laughed and some idiots booed because,
uh,
cause they're morons.

757
00:45:58.770 --> 00:45:59.220
You know,

758
00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:02.100
those are the same people who would just standing back then they were just

759
00:46:02.101 --> 00:46:05.520
standing around cause there was no youtube that they could sit there and fucking

760
00:46:05.521 --> 00:46:09.930
write their dumb ass comments on.
So anyways,
Jesus Christ,
you know what,

761
00:46:09.931 --> 00:46:12.870
if you're not into sport,
should definitely not listen to this fucking podcast.

762
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:16.170
Uh,
I got to have a couple of congratulations out there.

763
00:46:16.171 --> 00:46:20.460
I gotta congratulate the fucking Los Angeles Lakers.
Jesus Christ.

764
00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:25.260
I've got to admit,
I did not watch one second of the celebration,

765
00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:27.600
I a or the last game.

766
00:46:27.601 --> 00:46:30.670
I just was sort of flipping him once I saw they were like up by 15.
I was like,

767
00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:34.020
God,
those motherfuckers.
And then,
uh,
you know,

768
00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:38.310
and then ESPN comes on and says that they have 15 championships and only two

769
00:46:38.311 --> 00:46:42.960
behind the Celtics and a,
which is true.
But I also know every moron,

770
00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:47.880
La Laker fan thinks that the Los Angeles Lakers have 15 titles when they don't,

771
00:46:47.881 --> 00:46:49.920
they have fucking tent.
Okay.

772
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:54.000
And I believe that the fucking titles belonged to the fans.
Okay.

773
00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:58.380
What the fuck did the people in Minnesota celebrate?
Nothing.
Those aren't,

774
00:46:58.381 --> 00:47:02.850
there's,
Oh God,
I'm in such a country fucking mood.

775
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:03.391
I just got,

776
00:47:03.391 --> 00:47:06.690
I got to do this podcast though because I know I'm going to sleep till fucking

777
00:47:06.691 --> 00:47:11.610
one tomorrow.
My,
my whole fucking sleep pattern is just out of whack.
Um,

778
00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:13.410
so anyways,
if you knew what of my podcast,

779
00:47:13.411 --> 00:47:16.110
I do one of these mother fuckers every week unless,
uh,

780
00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:20.910
unless some fucking staying out until six in the morning and it's raining every

781
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:25.830
night.
So,
um,
let's get on with the questions here.
The question for the week.

782
00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.870
All right,
this person says,
Bill,

783
00:47:27.871 --> 00:47:32.871
I recently read something online about Michael Vick negotiating a spokesman deal

784
00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:37.670
for Peter.
Since you now have your dog,

785
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.720
how fucking stupid is that?
You know,

786
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:44.050
like anybody's going to believe that Michael Vick gives a shit about dogs.

787
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.400
That's like when,
when like,

788
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:50.430
like Vince Neil fucking gets busted for drinking and driving and somebody dies

789
00:47:51.071 --> 00:47:54.730
in the car and then like three weeks later he's like,
hey,
this is Vince Neil.

790
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:57.610
You know,
when you're out partying it up,

791
00:47:57.611 --> 00:48:01.330
just make sure you got a designated driver.
You know,

792
00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:04.240
I never understood that.
It's like,
dude,

793
00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:09.360
where the fuck do you get off telling me what the fuck I should do before I get

794
00:48:09.701 --> 00:48:12.010
behind the fucking wheel?
Huh?

795
00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:16.690
You fucking cunt.
Um,

796
00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:21.460
you know what I mean?
So Michael Vick is going to be a spokesman.

797
00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.760
I don't understand people at Peta.

798
00:48:24.761 --> 00:48:29.440
What are they trying to just embarrass the guy?
Is that what they're doing?
Like,

799
00:48:29.441 --> 00:48:31.330
yeah,
listen,
we got so much power.

800
00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:35.440
We're going to make this guy come on TV and act like he gives a shit about dogs

801
00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:36.850
when he clearly doesn't.

802
00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:41.710
That doesn't make any fucking sense when you really think about it.
Right.

803
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:43.120
That's like a,

804
00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:48.190
that'd be like as some woman's group having a convicted rapist go on and be
like,

805
00:48:48.191 --> 00:48:52.330
you know,
you re you really got to respect these broads.
They uh,
you know,

806
00:48:52.331 --> 00:48:57.160
they work hard.
They,
uh,
they'll,
they'll make you a sandwich and a,
sorry,

807
00:48:57.161 --> 00:48:57.994
I'm riffing.

808
00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:05.830
Um,
that was supposed to be the rapist saying to the ladies going,
sorry,

809
00:49:05.831 --> 00:49:08.200
I'm riffing.
And the ladies were supposed to be yelling.

810
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:11.680
There's nothing about making a sandwich in that statement,
you know,

811
00:49:11.681 --> 00:49:15.460
if you didn't get it,
I'm really not good at that type of shit.
All right,
let's,

812
00:49:15.461 --> 00:49:19.800
let's plow to this question.
Um,
all right,

813
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:24.220
so we're going to have terrorist fucking give a 4th of July tips in the next

814
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.670
couple of weeks.
Oh my God.
I was really,

815
00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:31.700
I was literally ready to go into some hacky fucking Middle Eastern accent,

816
00:49:32.201 --> 00:49:36.040
which is really some,
just me imitating somebody else doing an Indian accent,

817
00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:40.620
somebody from India,
you know,
make sure your daughter put far Craig.

818
00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:45.580
I was literally going to do that and I stopped myself because just out of

819
00:49:45.581 --> 00:49:49.690
fucking respect for myself and you guys as the listeners.
Okay.

820
00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:53.650
I swear to God,
if I actually did that,
like,

821
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:58.060
and you guys actually came back next week and listen to the podcast,
you know,

822
00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:01.840
I would lose all respect for you.
All right,
let's finish this question.
All right.

823
00:50:01.841 --> 00:50:04.840
I recently read something about a online,
about Michael Vick,

824
00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:08.260
a negotiating a spokesman deal for Peter.
Uh,

825
00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:12.580
since you now have your dog,
uh,
what do you think about this?

826
00:50:12.581 --> 00:50:13.690
I think I just answered that.

827
00:50:13.691 --> 00:50:18.100
I personally hate the fucker since it's people like him that would leave a dog

828
00:50:18.101 --> 00:50:21.940
by,
by the bridge or worse after they'd done fighting them.

829
00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:26.970
Not to mention this is just a ploy to get back on the public's good side so he

830
00:50:27.201 --> 00:50:30.650
can work his way into playing football again.
Also,

831
00:50:30.651 --> 00:50:35.650
since you're now doing the podcast,
uh,
wait,
let me just address that point.

832
00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:38.120
You know,
so he can,
uh,

833
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:42.080
it's just a ploy so he can get back in pub on the public's good side so he can

834
00:50:42.081 --> 00:50:45.500
play football again.
Let me ask all you animal lovers out there.

835
00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:50.480
Don't you think Michael has paid his debt to society?
I mean,

836
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:54.110
what the fuck else does this guy have to do?

837
00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:58.670
His dream was to play professional football.
It got taken away.

838
00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:03.380
He had millions of dollars.
He's fucking,
he has nothing left.
They took his house,

839
00:51:03.381 --> 00:51:04.700
they took his mom's house.

840
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.980
The guy did time for fucking with dogs.
He went to Leavenworth,

841
00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:15.710
Leavenworth,
Sammy the bull didn't go to fucking Leavenworth.
He went right.

842
00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:18.260
I'm just,
I just literally just said that.
I have no idea if he went there,

843
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:21.190
and that's one of those bar room fucking things you,

844
00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:25.010
that's something you say in a bar where no one can fucking do the research.

845
00:51:25.011 --> 00:51:26.870
I guess they can now in their blackberries,
you know?

846
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.340
But you guys are all at your computers.

847
00:51:28.341 --> 00:51:31.760
I'm sure everybody's clicking and you're fucking keyboards.

848
00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:34.760
But you know what I mean?
The guy went to fucking Leavenworth.

849
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:38.210
He was the quarterback of the Atlanta Falcons.
He was one of the,

850
00:51:38.211 --> 00:51:39.410
he was on his way.

851
00:51:39.411 --> 00:51:42.230
They were talking like acting like he was the Michael Next Michael Jordan.

852
00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:46.970
But he's playing fucking football.
Right.
And what does he do?

853
00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:51.500
He has some dog fights.
People flip the fuck out.
Right.

854
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:55.670
I'm not saying what he did,
what he did wasn't fucking,
it was bizarre.

855
00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:59.050
What he did was fucking bizarre.
Cause I,
I,
I,

856
00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:01.100
I don't know that I had heard a dog fights,

857
00:52:01.101 --> 00:52:04.310
but I just thought that was so like some,
uh,
gangs in New York.
Shit,

858
00:52:04.311 --> 00:52:07.520
I didn't know people still did that stuff.
But anyways,

859
00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:10.880
I mean he lost everything.
The guy lost everything.

860
00:52:10.881 --> 00:52:14.530
He lost two fucking years of playing.
He,

861
00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:17.990
the guy lost everything and he went to fucking Leavenworth.

862
00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:21.410
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

863
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:24.670
<v 8>Jesus fucking Christ it,</v>

864
00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:28.940
you know,
fuck you peed off.
Go Fuck Yourself.

865
00:52:28.941 --> 00:52:32.000
I'm not doing your Goddamn fucking announcement.
All right.

866
00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:35.720
I spent the last two years try not to get raped.
I lost all my fucking money.

867
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:39.620
I lost my fucking career and I'm probably gonna sign with the fucking Detroit

868
00:52:39.621 --> 00:52:42.980
lions.
Isn't that enough for you cunt?
You fucking Weirdos.

869
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:45.890
Why don't you go yell at Obama for fucking slap in a house?

870
00:52:45.891 --> 00:52:47.660
Fly like you've never done that.

871
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:54.970
Can you fucking believe Obama got shit for it's a fucking house with lands on

872
00:52:55.851 --> 00:52:59.240
Shit.
Get it off me.
You know.

873
00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:03.110
How about a mosquito where the would people at Peta flip out about a fucking

874
00:53:03.111 --> 00:53:07.190
mosquito,
you know,
don't those things carry diseases?

875
00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:12.950
You dumb fuck off.
Speaking of that swine Flus back,
Huh?
Good ole swine flu.

876
00:53:12.951 --> 00:53:15.710
You've got to love swine flu as long as you don't get it and nobody loves gets

877
00:53:15.711 --> 00:53:18.950
it.
I'm telling you this,
you know there's good things,
you know,

878
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:23.320
thin out the traffic,
you know,
let's get some,

879
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:24.710
how the fuck did swap,

880
00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:29.190
I was doing a bit about that and maybe I can bring that back about how anytime a

881
00:53:29.191 --> 00:53:31.980
new disease comes out,
like it can't just be like,

882
00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:33.360
<v 9>okay,</v>

883
00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:36.360
<v 8>you know,
someone was in the forest and they got bit by something.</v>

884
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:41.220
It always has to be somebody fucked an animal,
you know,

885
00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:45.510
aids.
Some dude,
somebody fucked a monkey,
you know,

886
00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:49.560
they fucked her monkey and then they got on the Concorde and they blew a

887
00:53:49.561 --> 00:53:54.561
stewardess and a or a male stewardess and then there was aids.

888
00:53:57.090 --> 00:54:00.900
Oh yeah,
yeah.
I'm telling you yellow fever,
dude,

889
00:54:00.901 --> 00:54:05.280
somebody fucked the fucking cow,
dude.
Really,

890
00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:11.700
really swine flu.
I'm telling you,
dude,
down in Mexico,
they fucking,

891
00:54:11.701 --> 00:54:13.590
if they fuck pigs down there,
you know,

892
00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:17.520
don't see anybody fucking picks up here to you.
Shut up.

893
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:21.090
Everybody comes a goddamn doctor.
Um,

894
00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:26.530
I don't know.
Where do diseases come from?
I think they actually,
uh,

895
00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.790
I dunno,
I was actually gonna say it.
He'd done,

896
00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:33.350
do you think that there would be fucking,
I think they would be,

897
00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:36.950
but would you think this,
would you think that they would be evil enough?

898
00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:39.781
Sorry,

899
00:54:39.781 --> 00:54:42.390
I was just making sure there's fucking thanks recording because this happened to

900
00:54:42.391 --> 00:54:44.790
me last week and I talked for 25 minutes and it didn't,

901
00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:48.900
do you think that they would actually be fucking evil enough to actually just

902
00:54:48.901 --> 00:54:52.280
create a disease?
You know,
I do.

903
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:58.680
And then actually think that they could somehow control it and um,

904
00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:03.220
I dunno man.
Do you got something has to be done.

905
00:55:03.221 --> 00:55:04.990
There's just too many fucking people.

906
00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:06.700
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

907
00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:10.000
<v 8>I've said this before.
I swear to God,
I'm 41 I don't have any kids.</v>

908
00:55:10.001 --> 00:55:13.960
I really think I should be getting a tax break for not adding to the traffic.

909
00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:15.603
You know,

910
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:20.050
I think everybody should be required to wait until their forties to have kids.

911
00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:24.520
Let some old people die.
Let some accidents happen,
you know,

912
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:30.030
let some fucking people die so we don't have to fucking have 19 lane highways.

913
00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:31.983
You know,

914
00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:38.810
maybe it's good that people are fucking pigs.
I don't know if in the end of it,

915
00:55:38.811 --> 00:55:42.500
some people fucking die and then they don't have eight kids and ma'am,
you know,

916
00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:47.900
does anything I say makes sense.
It's just so fucking stupid sometimes.

917
00:55:47.901 --> 00:55:50.840
So anyways,
let me finish with this question here.
Um,

918
00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:55.760
also since you're now doing the podcast and your new microphone system,
well,

919
00:55:55.761 --> 00:56:00.080
we get a chance to hear any more of you on the road or in an airport.

920
00:56:00.081 --> 00:56:02.990
I found those to be hilarious and like the sound better.

921
00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:07.970
Don't know why the new ones are too quiet.
Uh,

922
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.640
but still free.
So I probably shouldn't be complaining.

923
00:56:10.641 --> 00:56:14.540
Hope to see you on stage soon dude.
I Dunno.
I Dunno what the deal is with that.

924
00:56:14.541 --> 00:56:18.170
Maybe I,
I think,
uh,
last weeks was too quiet because I had a problem.

925
00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:20.870
I didn't adjust the device correctly.
I'm on the road,

926
00:56:20.871 --> 00:56:25.570
I don't have the microphone and uh,
you know,
I'm on the talent end here.

927
00:56:25.571 --> 00:56:30.370
I'm not on the fucking,
I'm not the guy in the studio.
I'm not Bob Rock here.
Okay.

928
00:56:30.371 --> 00:56:34.780
So sometimes there might be a little fucked up,
but um,
yeah,

929
00:56:34.781 --> 00:56:37.810
I know a lot of people like those old podcasts where I used to just go off on

930
00:56:37.811 --> 00:56:42.310
people in airports.
Um,
I dunno.

931
00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:43.300
I guess I could do it,

932
00:56:43.301 --> 00:56:45.640
but it was always easier to do it on my phone cause people,

933
00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:47.260
they had no idea I was talking to them.

934
00:56:47.261 --> 00:56:50.470
But if I sit here with this fucking device,
you know,

935
00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:54.850
God knows somebody who will take some nine 11 statute and I'll be in some

936
00:56:54.851 --> 00:56:59.530
goddamn back room.
Um,
all right,
let's get to overrated.
Underrated.
Okay.

937
00:56:59.531 --> 00:57:04.070
Overrated.
Underrated for this week.
All right.
Overrated people who make those,
uh,

938
00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:08.230
that moves me.
Emotional grunts during public performances.

939
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:11.920
Uh,
Jesus isn't that yet.
Then that the fucking truth,

940
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:16.950
if you're listening to a firsthand story about saving a person's life perhaps,

941
00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:20.890
but making a noise across between almond lighting.

942
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:25.840
I'm enlightened and I have a stomach pain in response to a trivial fact gets old

943
00:57:25.841 --> 00:57:30.580
quick.
Yeah,
I absolutely have to fucking agree with that one.

944
00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:32.230
Another one,
overrated.

945
00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:36.710
This is one that's going to fucking definitely get some feedback.

946
00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:39.700
Somebody says public school teachers are overrated.

947
00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:41.770
They only work nine months a year.

948
00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:46.480
Get paid living wages with full Ben benefits and pensions and they have a

949
00:57:46.481 --> 00:57:51.280
ridiculously easy job.
I'm going to pause.
There was all the,
any,

950
00:57:51.281 --> 00:57:52.810
if I have any teachers who are listening,

951
00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:57.370
they're just teaching the same shit over and over again every year and they for

952
00:57:57.371 --> 00:58:01.930
the most part suck at it.
Wow.
Calculus aside,

953
00:58:01.931 --> 00:58:03.910
most of the shit is really simple.

954
00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:08.920
Like how hard is it to teach kids how to spell the word tree every year.

955
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:13.540
It's not like the Boston tea party gains a new level of nuance every year.

956
00:58:13.541 --> 00:58:18.040
You teach it yet they complain,
we're underpaid,
we're underappreciated.

957
00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:19.083
But Shit,

958
00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:23.590
you're overpaid for working a semi part time job that you mostly suck at.

959
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:28.510
You're given a free pass to the middle of class and somehow the bonus of a

960
00:58:28.511 --> 00:58:33.430
social martyrdom.
I know,
I didn't say that right.
People are always bitching.
Oh,

961
00:58:33.431 --> 00:58:37.090
we need more teachers,
Dude,
our school teachers middleclass what do you,

962
00:58:37.091 --> 00:58:41.080
what do you consider middleclass 25 grand a year.
Whatever the fuck they pay.

963
00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:43.990
Um,
those poor things.

964
00:58:43.991 --> 00:58:47.470
Living off of government money and having to explain really simple shit to

965
00:58:47.471 --> 00:58:51.700
children.
Not An easy job like working with minimum wage,
hauling debris,

966
00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:56.410
working the fields are cleaning bathrooms in convalescent homes.

967
00:58:56.620 --> 00:59:01.480
Stupid fucking lazy coal miners.
They don't contribute to society like we do.

968
00:59:01.481 --> 00:59:05.830
I guess this is the teacher's talking.
We hope we help mold young minds.

969
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:10.330
Great job.
That's why most people are fucking morons.
All right.

970
00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:14.680
All right dude.
You know I'm,
I'm,
I'm going to fucking way on in this one.

971
00:59:14.681 --> 00:59:18.070
I think what you're doing is you're blaming the ass of the problem.

972
00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:23.060
All right.
Do it.
Would you want to stand there in front of 30 snot nose kids,

973
00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:26.540
18 of which probably have to dump fuck,

974
00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:31.010
who didn't wear a fucking condom for parents,
you know,

975
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:35.750
and you got to get there with their fucking Brat kid and all these fucking

976
00:59:35.751 --> 00:59:40.520
parents,
no parent today can admit that their kid is a Douche bag,

977
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:43.880
you know,
not overall.
No parent would admit that.
But you know what I mean?

978
00:59:43.881 --> 00:59:48.230
Like in a certain situation,
they always got a fucking excuse.
They got add.

979
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:52.940
The teachers,
uh,
was doing this so they were doing that,
you know,

980
00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:57.230
I do.
Do you want to be a fucking thing?
It's such a fucking great job,
dude.

981
00:59:57.231 --> 00:59:59.870
You go be a God damn teacher.
I know what you mean,
dude.

982
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:01.930
Nine months a year is the shit and you get the whole,

983
01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:06.410
like their vacation days are ridiculous.
That is a great point.
Think about that.

984
01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:10.040
They get all those Jewish holidays off.
They get the PTA thing off,

985
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:12.770
they get the fucking Thanksgiving week off.

986
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:17.360
They get like a 10 day vacation,
14 days vacation over Christmas,

987
01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:22.340
February vacation,
April vacation and summer vacation.
You know,

988
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.640
and you do come in from nine to three.
And I got to admit,

989
01:00:25.641 --> 01:00:29.300
even if you are teaching calculus,
once you do it for a number of years,

990
01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:34.100
you got it down.
But you know what,
you can say that about everybody.
You know

991
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:38.410
the fuck.
Let me tell you know,

992
01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:42.410
how many basements do you have to refinish before you got it down?
Well,

993
01:00:42.411 --> 01:00:46.640
you know what you gotta do,
you know,
I dunno.

994
01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:50.810
And I,
I think,
uh,
and,
and anytime we get into shit,

995
01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:53.720
the first thing they cut is they always cut education.

996
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:58.070
They always kind of education and can people have old fucking books.
I Dunno,

997
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.761
you know,
something,

998
01:00:58.761 --> 01:01:02.660
I talked to some of the people here in New York and some of the shit that they

999
01:01:02.661 --> 01:01:05.780
got to deal with and some of the public schools,
you know,

1000
01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:08.780
and no matter what they do,
the kids never fucking wrong,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

1001
01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:12.590
blah,
blah.
Um,
I will,
I'll tell you this,

1002
01:01:12.591 --> 01:01:17.591
I do totally agree with their hours are ridiculous and the amount of vacation

1003
01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:21.650
time that they get is ridiculous.
But I gotta be honest with you,
dude,

1004
01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:26.210
think about flying,
getting on an airplane and there's a fucking screaming kid.

1005
01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:31.190
All right,
now multiply that times 30 and you've got to spend six fucking hours.

1006
01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:34.640
At least when you're on the God damn plane,
you can ignore the kid,

1007
01:01:34.641 --> 01:01:37.040
you can put on a Walkman.
You can't do that as a teacher.

1008
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:40.840
You got to actually somehow get these kids to shut the fuck up and then teach

1009
01:01:40.841 --> 01:01:45.740
them how to spell the word tree,
you know?
Fuck that.

1010
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:49.520
You can have that job.
Um,
all right.

1011
01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:53.360
I actually thought about being a teacher for a while before I did stand up.

1012
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.960
You know,

1013
01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:58.220
I just wanted to somehow being in front of a group of people and be funny and I

1014
01:01:58.221 --> 01:02:01.370
remember every job I thought about Ibi be funny,
I'll be a cop,

1015
01:02:01.371 --> 01:02:04.820
but I'll be a funny cup.
I'll pull people over and I'll let him go.
You know?

1016
01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:06.170
That's what I used to think.
You know,

1017
01:02:06.171 --> 01:02:09.500
I'd be one of those guys who gets shocked during the second fucking week cause

1018
01:02:09.501 --> 01:02:13.940
I'm trying to make friends,
you know,
with my authentic need to be liked.

1019
01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:19.080
All right,
let's get into the bad press thing.
A few weeks ago I mentioned how,
um,

1020
01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:23.130
you know,
there's certain groups of people that just always get good press.

1021
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:26.710
You know,
firemen always get good press.
The uh,

1022
01:02:26.711 --> 01:02:30.190
the men and women in the armed services always get good press and blob.

1023
01:02:30.191 --> 01:02:34.500
And for the most part,
99% of it is right.
All right.

1024
01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:39.501
But if you saw Jurassic Park and you listen to Jeff Goldbloom explained chaos

1025
01:02:39.601 --> 01:02:43.110
theory,
there's exceptions,
you know,

1026
01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:48.150
there's no way,
there's not one douche bag in the navy.
There's no way.

1027
01:02:48.151 --> 01:02:51.630
There's not one asshole at the fire department.
You know,
there are.

1028
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:54.270
So I wanted to hear the stories and here's one.

1029
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:57.390
Bill is about an army guy.
Bill,

1030
01:02:57.391 --> 01:03:00.120
I have a story about an old neighbor of mine who was in the army.

1031
01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:04.260
Most people in the army never seem to have anything negative said about them.

1032
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:06.000
But that's not the case with me.

1033
01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:10.560
I used to live next to a family in which there were six sons and each of them

1034
01:03:10.561 --> 01:03:12.000
were real pieces of shit.

1035
01:03:15.450 --> 01:03:18.900
That's hilarious.
Isn't there always just that fucking piece of shit?

1036
01:03:18.901 --> 01:03:23.760
Scumbag family,
you know,
every fucking one of them is a Pete.

1037
01:03:23.761 --> 01:03:28.530
The Dad's a piece of shit.
The mother's a piece of shit.
All the sons,

1038
01:03:28.531 --> 01:03:33.531
all the daughters that dog their car that it's just a from head from top to

1039
01:03:33.871 --> 01:03:37.130
bottom.
It's just a piece of Shit fucking family.
Right.

1040
01:03:37.690 --> 01:03:42.210
And they all sit there breathing through their mouth.
All right.
Anyways,
um,

1041
01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:44.550
so he goes,
yeah,
they're all pieces of shit.
He goes,

1042
01:03:44.551 --> 01:03:48.750
I'm talking about the types of assholes who would drop a hit of acid in

1043
01:03:48.751 --> 01:03:52.500
someone's beer and get a kick out of watching the person trip his ass off.

1044
01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.410
Every one of them was arrested at least once.

1045
01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.950
The oldest was the biggest piece of shit out of the bunch.

1046
01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:03.030
He shot a liquor store clerk and I think he paralyzed the guy from the waist

1047
01:04:03.031 --> 01:04:04.710
down.
But out of all of them,

1048
01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:08.910
there was one who considered himself to be the price.
Why you ask?

1049
01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:13.350
Because he was the one who was in the army and whenever this guy would come back

1050
01:04:13.351 --> 01:04:17.790
home to visit,
he would bring in quotes,
army toys with him.

1051
01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:21.990
<v 4>Ah,
this</v>

1052
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:26.610
<v 8>is a great fucking story.
Um,
there are a few stories that I remember.</v>

1053
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:31.410
One time he had a smokescreen and set it off in a neighbor's yard.

1054
01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:33.540
Uh,
there were,

1055
01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:37.560
there were these blue flames shooting out the back and just burning up the
grass.

1056
01:04:37.561 --> 01:04:42.030
And in a matter of five seconds you couldn't see any of the houses on the
street.

1057
01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:45.420
Another time he set off a flare in the middle of the night,

1058
01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.760
I can still see him setting the thing off.

1059
01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.100
He just smacked the end of it on the pavement.

1060
01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:54.030
Out came this little ball of light that shot up in the sky and then poof,

1061
01:04:54.210 --> 01:04:59.010
it was daylight out.
He woke up half the neighborhood.
Uh,

1062
01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.950
but the worst ever was when he was home for Thanksgiving.

1063
01:05:01.951 --> 01:05:03.540
And I saw him out at a bar.

1064
01:05:03.541 --> 01:05:07.650
He had brought home a fucking hand grenade and was trying to sell the fucking

1065
01:05:07.651 --> 01:05:10.800
thing.
One last thing about this family.

1066
01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.790
They had a retarded brother who was a fucking monster,

1067
01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:16.650
like 250 pounds.

1068
01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:20.860
All I did with this brother was basically keep them locked up in a room and let

1069
01:05:20.861 --> 01:05:25.270
them watch pro wrestling one year at the 4th of July block party.

1070
01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:28.750
They thought it would be funny to get them drunk and let them loose at the
party.

1071
01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:33.610
That was easily in the top three scariest moments of my life.
No bullshit.

1072
01:05:33.611 --> 01:05:37.300
People are hopping fences and fair.
This guy,
he didn't hurt anyone,

1073
01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:39.610
but he dent the shit out of the tool shit.

1074
01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:44.590
See what I'm saying?

1075
01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:46.520
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1076
01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:49.010
<v 8>That's where there's always one asshole.
I don't give a shit.</v>

1077
01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:51.980
I don't give a shit is always going to be the,

1078
01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:55.850
he's trying to sell a fucking hand grenade.
I got a question for you guys.

1079
01:05:55.851 --> 01:06:00.340
Would you buy it?
I wouldn't.
I'd be so afraid.

1080
01:06:00.341 --> 01:06:04.180
I blow my fucking hand off.
But if someone bought it,
I would.

1081
01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:05.650
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1082
01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:09.340
<v 8>I want to be in the vicinity and in the opposite direction of where they threw</v>

1083
01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:11.140
it.
I just want to be,
are there any,
uh,

1084
01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:15.480
any military people listen to this podcast?
Is there anything that you can,
uh,

1085
01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:18.730
how big is that?
It's like a hand grenade.

1086
01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:20.100
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1087
01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:23.670
<v 8>You know what I mean?
Like if someone,
like I'm,
I'm in a hotel room,
right?</v>

1088
01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:27.210
If somebody threw a hand grenade in this fucking room,
right?

1089
01:06:27.211 --> 01:06:30.600
And it was on the other side of my bed and I jumped on this side of the bed,

1090
01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:34.320
like fucking Tom Cruise and one of those mission impossible fucking movies,

1091
01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:38.130
you know,
in the movie I live,
what happens to me in real life?

1092
01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:44.510
You know,
what happens?
Do I what?
I immediately lose my hearing,

1093
01:06:45.110 --> 01:06:47.930
which shrapnel go through the bed with me in the bed.

1094
01:06:47.931 --> 01:06:51.580
Just go flying out the fucking window.
What I be all right,

1095
01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:57.170
will I stop asking questions?
All right,
let's move on.
Here's another one,
a bill.

1096
01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:00.800
Uh,
congrats on the tonight show and the movie.
Thank you.

1097
01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:04.940
And even more so on the dog.
I got a pair of,
let me read this.

1098
01:07:04.941 --> 01:07:08.790
This is one I should have enlarged.
I got a pair of pound Mutts,
uh,

1099
01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:11.840
mutts two years ago and it changed my fucking life.

1100
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:16.370
The whole thing you said about not even knowing them a month ago and now already

1101
01:07:16.371 --> 01:07:19.610
dreading the day they're going to die.
Fuck,
I'm right there with you.

1102
01:07:19.611 --> 01:07:23.840
Dogs are kids who never disappoint.
Even when my girl ate my cell phone,

1103
01:07:24.110 --> 01:07:26.450
I loved her.
You mean like your girl dog?

1104
01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:31.370
I actually thought you meant your daughter.
That's fucking some idiot.
All right.

1105
01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:36.530
Um,
anyways,
he said I still loved her.
I never knew I had it in me.
Um,

1106
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:41.250
yeah,
man,
I gotta I gotta fucking agree with you dude.

1107
01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:47.560
Fucking dogs are the greatest goddamn things ever and I respect cat people,

1108
01:07:47.561 --> 01:07:51.100
but I,
I just,
I don't get it.
I don't get it.

1109
01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:55.360
Cats are like the hot chick at a bar,
man.
They just fucking,

1110
01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:00.190
they come to you when they need you and then they just,
I,
I respect cats.

1111
01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:05.110
I totally respect cats because,
uh,
they're like loaners,
you know,

1112
01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:09.580
every once in a while they pop in,
hey,
what's going on?
You know,
how you been?

1113
01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:13.780
All right,
take it easy.
Then they leave.
I totally get that shit.
But like,
um,

1114
01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:18.710
I don't know,
just the way they kind of come and go and they don't pay rent.

1115
01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:23.030
This is an arrogance to that,
you know,
I think dogs are a lot more appreciative,

1116
01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.130
you know?
I think they sense,

1117
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:30.000
I think dogs have a bigger sense of the monetary system than cats too.

1118
01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:35.030
And plus cats practice killing you.
I don't like that fucking girlfriend.

1119
01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:39.680
I had years back,
I,
you know,
I just,
I would just send something watching me.

1120
01:08:39.681 --> 01:08:44.000
I turned around and I catch the cat,
like stalking me.
It was annoying.

1121
01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:47.480
It was annoying that the thing little thing thought it was going to fucking do.

1122
01:08:47.481 --> 01:08:49.940
So,
I mean,
it could do something to me.
All right,

1123
01:08:49.941 --> 01:08:52.670
so I don't need all you cat people to be like,
dude,
let me tell you something.

1124
01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:56.750
Dead Dick wanted to,
you know,
if I want it to,

1125
01:08:57.260 --> 01:08:57.951
if I wanted to,

1126
01:08:57.951 --> 01:09:02.690
I could take out one of the many weapons that human beings have invented where I

1127
01:09:02.691 --> 01:09:05.690
could fucking kill a cat from across the room.
I got to tell you right now,

1128
01:09:05.691 --> 01:09:10.130
if Michael Vick was fighting cats,
he,
he,
he would have got community service.

1129
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:13.850
People just don't give a shit about cats,
you know?

1130
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:19.210
But people love,
they love dogs.
You can trash Katz.
I am telling you,

1131
01:09:19.211 --> 01:09:24.211
you can be in a comedy doing standup comedy and you can fucking trash cats and

1132
01:09:24.561 --> 01:09:29.030
people just don't give a shit.
But you start trashing dogs and people really,

1133
01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:33.860
they really have a problem with it.
You know,
cats,
the gross,

1134
01:09:33.861 --> 01:09:38.750
they shit in the house.
It's why,
why can't you just go outside and do that?

1135
01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:41.690
You know?
Ugh.

1136
01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:47.510
Is it ever is the litter box everclean is there any guy out there you dating the

1137
01:09:47.511 --> 01:09:51.530
girl with the fucking cat and the stupid fucking things.

1138
01:09:51.531 --> 01:09:54.950
They have no boundaries.
They jump up on tables there on the bed.

1139
01:09:54.951 --> 01:09:58.550
They were on your chest.
There are fucking on the couch.
You're an animal.

1140
01:09:58.551 --> 01:10:02.340
Get on the God damn floor.
If I had a cat,

1141
01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:06.470
I can't even begin to tell you how much I would fucking torture it.
You know?

1142
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:09.290
I would get one of those little spray bottles with the water.

1143
01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.600
I guess that's what you're supposed to use to keep them off the couch.

1144
01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:16.400
I would just do that all the time.
Just in general.

1145
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:21.200
Shoot him right in the fucking face.
That's what I would do.
You know.

1146
01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.410
Fuck a fucking civil rights rally.

1147
01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:28.490
God Damn firehose right to the face.
I'm all right.

1148
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:33.110
You don't know how to bring that up.
All right.
Um,
cash registered.
Hey Bill,

1149
01:10:33.111 --> 01:10:37.790
did you see the Lakers?
Uh,
take the championship 99,
86.
It was awesome.

1150
01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:41.150
Yes,
I did a,
Phil Jackson now has his record,

1151
01:10:41.151 --> 01:10:46.151
10th championship ring on his finger and you really look like a Leprechaun next

1152
01:10:46.281 --> 01:10:46.880
to Conan.

1153
01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.210
Every time I do Kona somebody tells me that you look like as gay little brother,

1154
01:10:50.211 --> 01:10:54.140
but Baba Baba Ba uh,
he's pretty tall.
He's six,
four,

1155
01:10:54.141 --> 01:10:58.550
I think he's actually like six foot six.
Um,
anyways,

1156
01:10:58.551 --> 01:11:01.940
also I was thinking about your position against self checkout lines.

1157
01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:03.651
Um,

1158
01:11:03.651 --> 01:11:07.190
I was at the store the other day and saw there were only two people working at

1159
01:11:07.191 --> 01:11:11.510
registers and the other eight were self checkout lines.
It was appalling.

1160
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:14.220
And half the time a person,
the self checkout,

1161
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:17.520
something malfunctions and someone has to come over to help.

1162
01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.860
So why the fuck don't they just put a competent,

1163
01:11:19.861 --> 01:11:21.810
efficient individual at the register?

1164
01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.170
That's just another example of our increasing unemployment rate.

1165
01:11:25.171 --> 01:11:28.290
I totally agree with you.
People are fucking morons.

1166
01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.900
You want to see classic example of fucking morons.

1167
01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:34.230
We're all those idiot standing in line to buy the new iPhone.

1168
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:38.250
People have like the memory of like two minutes now.

1169
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:41.030
<v 1>And when the first iPhone came out,
what happened?</v>

1170
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:43.790
Everybody ran out and they bought the fucking thing.

1171
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.840
They stood in line like they were going to go see Bruce Springsteen backstage or

1172
01:11:47.841 --> 01:11:52.250
some shit.
They get the phone,
the phone sucked,
the service sucked,

1173
01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:54.590
everything sucked.
It was overpriced.

1174
01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:59.330
They recalled something and then two months later they fixed it,
right?

1175
01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:04.070
And then the second wave,
we're better phones for like $200 cheaper.

1176
01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:06.920
So why the fuck when the next phone comes out?

1177
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:10.940
Would you run in line to buy the first one again?
You know why?

1178
01:12:10.941 --> 01:12:12.890
Cause you're a dumb fuck.
That's why.

1179
01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:17.270
And you had the same dumb fuck who goes into a supermarket and uses one of those

1180
01:12:17.271 --> 01:12:19.910
automated cashier lines.
Cause you think it's easier.

1181
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:23.150
You think it's quicker and you think it's better.
You're a moron.

1182
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:26.660
You're working for free for the supermarkets and you help them put people out of

1183
01:12:26.661 --> 01:12:29.600
jobs.
You big fucking,
a month ago,

1184
01:12:29.690 --> 01:12:31.850
two people did the job for you for free.

1185
01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:34.130
He just stood there with your hands in your pockets.
It's

1186
01:12:36.170 --> 01:12:38.960
<v 8>whatever,
dude.
You know what?
Uh,
you're,
you're fighting a losing battle.</v>

1187
01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:43.430
People are morons.
And if he come out with some shiny new shit,

1188
01:12:43.431 --> 01:12:46.940
the lineup to go do it.
I don't give a fuck what it is.
All right,

1189
01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:49.850
there's my little fucking editorial for the week.
All right?
Uh,

1190
01:12:49.851 --> 01:12:54.270
sports knowing things in sports,
Pau Gasol,

1191
01:12:54.271 --> 01:12:59.250
his fucking face.
Come on Laker Fan.
Gee,

1192
01:12:59.251 --> 01:13:01.940
you got to admit it,
right?
You won the championship.
You're in a good mood.

1193
01:13:01.941 --> 01:13:06.440
You got to admit,
come on.
If that guy wasn't fucking playing for you,

1194
01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:12.200
that vice head,
oh,
that itchy beard.
Gee,
it's like,

1195
01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:16.610
is he doing like,
what was that show?
He had the queer eye for the straight guy.

1196
01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:20.350
That's what he needs.
He needs like a makeover,
you know,

1197
01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:23.810
I think he just realizes that he's weird looking and he's trying to cover it up

1198
01:13:23.811 --> 01:13:27.290
with hair.
Um,
all right.
You know,

1199
01:13:27.291 --> 01:13:30.350
one of these days I'm going to run into that guy and he's going to take his size

1200
01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:35.440
fucking 19 sneaker and he's going to stop me right in the face anyways,

1201
01:13:36.230 --> 01:13:39.950
over,
uh,
over time this guy gets filed or commits a foul.

1202
01:13:39.951 --> 01:13:41.660
Every time he gets a follow commits,
a foul,

1203
01:13:41.661 --> 01:13:43.670
he acts like somebody committed a crime.

1204
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:48.980
I know I've been doing an impression of him on stage and a any podcast

1205
01:13:48.981 --> 01:13:51.900
listeners,
if you come out to one of my shows,
uh,

1206
01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:55.850
if anytime you want to yell that out,
please do it in between jokes.

1207
01:13:55.880 --> 01:14:00.080
I would really appreciate that.
Don't do that during a joke.
Um,

1208
01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:03.770
that moment during my set when I look lost and I act like I'm thirsty,

1209
01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:05.150
taking a sip of water,

1210
01:14:05.151 --> 01:14:07.580
but I'm really trying to think about what the fuck I'm going to talk next.

1211
01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:12.550
Yell it out then.
And as an added bonus,
I'll do Derick cheater impression.

1212
01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:18.010
My Derek Jeter impression is,
uh,
the impression of Derek.

1213
01:14:18.730 --> 01:14:23.410
A impression of Derek Jeter taking a fast ball right down the middle of the

1214
01:14:23.411 --> 01:14:27.970
plate.
Uh,
for strike one.
I do what I do.
You know,

1215
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:33.490
I do a fantastic impression of what he does anyways.
Uh,
ps,

1216
01:14:33.491 --> 01:14:36.010
what do you think of the Stanley Cup game seven.

1217
01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:37.750
I thought it was an amazing game.

1218
01:14:37.751 --> 01:14:41.830
Grateful hockey and surprising the wings choked.
Thanks again for the podcast.

1219
01:14:41.831 --> 01:14:44.710
Do the wings didn't choke.
You know,

1220
01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:48.070
that's the new age of sports.
If somebody wins,

1221
01:14:48.071 --> 01:14:50.590
that means the other person choked.
They didn't choke.
They just weren't,

1222
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:55.240
the penguins were a better fucking team,
you know.
Um,

1223
01:14:56.050 --> 01:14:59.600
I dunno,
that was a,
that was a great,
that was a great series.
Um,

1224
01:14:59.710 --> 01:15:02.440
I liked it and I was psyched.
I had mixed emotions.

1225
01:15:02.441 --> 01:15:06.370
I didn't want to see Detroit when,
again,
just out of jealousy.
But,

1226
01:15:06.371 --> 01:15:10.720
um,
I'm still bummed the Steelers won the Superbowl,

1227
01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:13.510
you know,
fucking patriots caught right up to them.

1228
01:15:13.511 --> 01:15:18.160
We were one behind them and now somehow were three behind them again.
But,

1229
01:15:18.161 --> 01:15:21.790
uh,
you know,
I don't know,
but I respect the Steelers.
I mean,

1230
01:15:21.791 --> 01:15:23.980
they're always beating powerhouses for their titles now,

1231
01:15:23.981 --> 01:15:28.900
like the Seattle Seahawks and the Arizona cardinals.
And uh,

1232
01:15:28.901 --> 01:15:29.651
you know,
who knows,

1233
01:15:29.651 --> 01:15:34.651
maybe next year they'll play the saints for the biggest trophy in pro football.

1234
01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:39.490
Oh,
I have no right to be bitter.

1235
01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.890
I just want to see the Bruins win a Stanley Cup and then I'm done.

1236
01:15:41.891 --> 01:15:44.090
And then obviously,
you know,
hey,
is another,
this,

1237
01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:46.210
another way I'm going to get out of fucking a,

1238
01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:50.800
I'm going to get out of watching baseball when the rest of my heroes fucking

1239
01:15:50.801 --> 01:15:55.540
test positive is a Wimbleton.
Wimbleton tennis starts,

1240
01:15:55.541 --> 01:15:59.100
uh,
starts this week,
that'll kill another weeks.

1241
01:15:59.101 --> 01:16:01.210
And then all I gotta do is just worry about July.

1242
01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:04.930
And at that point there's gotta be some arena football.

1243
01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.760
What do you football fans who just refuse to watch baseball.

1244
01:16:09.761 --> 01:16:10.870
What do you do during July?

1245
01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:14.170
Maybe I could get out of the house and actually work out,
you know,

1246
01:16:15.190 --> 01:16:19.240
take up sailing.
All right.
This is the end of the podcast.
This one is a,

1247
01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:22.990
this one's kind of short this week,
but it's late at night.
And,
um,

1248
01:16:24.010 --> 01:16:27.180
I dunno if it rains tomorrow.
I'm going to ended up shooting,
I believe,

1249
01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:32.350
have no idea.
It's very up in the air,
so I probably should get some sleep.
Um,

1250
01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:35.320
even though they really don't call us until five.
What can else,
can I talk,

1251
01:16:35.321 --> 01:16:37.510
I don't know what else to fucking talk about.
Oh,

1252
01:16:37.511 --> 01:16:41.340
I added a date that I do not have up on my website yet.
Uh,

1253
01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:45.130
hopefully I'll have it up by the time I post this.
Um,

1254
01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:48.340
I am doing another Monday,

1255
01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:52.600
only show at the punchline in a San Francisco.

1256
01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:56.290
Um,
I did one back in March.

1257
01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.100
I did two shows and I just went up and I just sorta told stories while I kind of

1258
01:17:00.101 --> 01:17:03.010
did my act.
And,
um,

1259
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:06.280
I had probably two of the best sets I can ever remember having.

1260
01:17:06.850 --> 01:17:10.700
So I'm sure this time,
uh,
I don't know.

1261
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:13.040
I know I'm going to have a good time again.

1262
01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:16.400
I just always have a good time when I'm up there and,
uh,

1263
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:21.710
I dunno.
That's it.
That's the end of the fucking podcast.
I'm getting loopy here.

1264
01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:24.050
I actually,
you know what I've been doing during the day,
they got to,

1265
01:17:24.051 --> 01:17:27.200
I found another studio here in New York work and go play fucking drums.

1266
01:17:27.201 --> 01:17:32.201
And I'm telling you I'm inching closer and closer to being able to play that

1267
01:17:33.441 --> 01:17:36.170
good times,
bad times.
If I just fucking play drums,

1268
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:39.530
I swear to God I would've had it down by now.

1269
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:43.790
But I always go like all these days in between fucking drumming and shit.

1270
01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:48.170
But I'm telling you and when I get that thing down without a doubt,

1271
01:17:48.171 --> 01:17:51.740
I'm going to fucking make a video of it and you guys can all trash me about what

1272
01:17:51.741 --> 01:17:55.910
a Douche bag I looked like,
but I'm still going to be able to play it.
And uh,

1273
01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.930
my foot is that,
you know what I'm talking about this shit right now.

1274
01:17:59.931 --> 01:18:03.560
Cause I know most people don't give a fuck.
It's my foot is actually is,
is,

1275
01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:07.220
is aching right now for the amount I played for like two fucking hours

1276
01:18:08.970 --> 01:18:13.130
and I was just working on this,
uh,
that Joe,
Joe Mayor,

1277
01:18:13.131 --> 01:18:16.100
that fucking heel toe thing.
I'm going to get that thing down.

1278
01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:20.990
I'm getting that down and I'm getting down those fast doubles and when I do,

1279
01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:25.610
oh boy.
Oh boy.
I still won't have a Gig.
All right.
All right.

1280
01:18:25.611 --> 01:18:28.640
That fucking ending sucked.
God,
goddammit.
All right.

1281
01:18:28.641 --> 01:18:32.060
That's the end of the Monday morning podcast.
Somebody send me an MP.
Three.

1282
01:18:32.061 --> 01:18:35.330
I said I was gonna put it up this week.
I just don't have the,
uh,

1283
01:18:35.690 --> 01:18:38.270
I don't have the fucking time right now.
Um,

1284
01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:40.910
when I get back to La in a couple of weeks,
I'm going to do it.

1285
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:44.720
Somebody made me a new intro and if you guys want to try to come up with an

1286
01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:47.630
Intro,
I know I've got some musicians out there who listen to this.

1287
01:18:47.631 --> 01:18:50.600
If you want to write an intro song,
somebody,
a long time ago,

1288
01:18:50.601 --> 01:18:55.310
some band offered to do that.
And uh,
I never really got back to him.

1289
01:18:55.311 --> 01:18:59.330
I think they were from Michigan.
I can't remember.
But,
uh,
if you want to do that,

1290
01:18:59.331 --> 01:19:02.750
go ahead now because actually kind of know how to use garageband and I could

1291
01:19:02.751 --> 01:19:07.580
kind of splice it together.
Um,
yeah,
and that's it.

1292
01:19:07.581 --> 01:19:11.780
So that's it.
People.
Um,
I will be doing standup in New York City.

1293
01:19:11.781 --> 01:19:16.781
I actually worked the comedy cellar last a weekend and I might be at comics this

1294
01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:21.500
Wednesday,
um,

1295
01:19:21.501 --> 01:19:25.100
which that would be June 24th.

1296
01:19:25.730 --> 01:19:26.750
I might be doing it,

1297
01:19:26.751 --> 01:19:30.500
but there's also a chance that I might be shooting and I might not be there.
So,

1298
01:19:30.501 --> 01:19:32.600
uh,
it's day to day,

1299
01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:36.830
just like a rough day to day and a Iran,
if you're listening,

1300
01:19:36.831 --> 01:19:40.610
I hope you get over your fatigue and I hope he took a nap.

1301
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:46.810
