00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:02.640
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.050
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05.051 --> 00:00:09.980
May 22nd,
2016 what's going on out?

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.780
Yeah.
Um,
once again,
I got to come

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.500
<v 2>pewter issues here that I got to get fixed when I get back to Los hang delays.</v>

6
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.240
I am in,
um,
I'm in Seattle,
Seattle,

7
00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:24.640
Washington right now,
which I gotta tell you man,

8
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.290
if you come to Seattle and in May or June when the sun is out,

9
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.620
it's like you'll want to live here.

10
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.630
It really is one of the most beautiful cities in the United States.

11
00:00:37.631 --> 00:00:42.631
If you could just deal with overcast skies from like October through April and

12
00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:45.730
um,
these people pay the price,

13
00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:47.920
but when the sun comes out it's fucking unbelievable.

14
00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:51.850
So I'm here with Nick Craig,
who's been crushing it this whole fucking tour.

15
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.110
And um,
we just went out to get some eats,
like a couple of tourists.

16
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.921
We go,

17
00:00:56.921 --> 00:00:59.470
you want to go down to the fishermen place where they're throwing the fish and

18
00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:00.640
everything.
So we're like,
yeah.

19
00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:05.080
So we started walking down there and of course it's mobbed and I say to them,

20
00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:09.280
I go,
you realize that nobody from Seattle fucking goes down here,
you know,

21
00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:12.160
unless they're on like a first date or you know,

22
00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:14.800
your dad and mom had taken you down there to go see it.

23
00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:16.270
But I would think that you would avoid it.

24
00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:20.110
So we didn't go all the way down and we just kind of kept walking.

25
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.960
We got a little bit,
you know,

26
00:01:22.961 --> 00:01:25.570
we walked along that main drag and we just got a little bit away from it.

27
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.160
<v 0>Okay.</v>

28
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.690
<v 2>After waiting into that sea of fucking humanity,
I was literally like,
dude,</v>

29
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.780
I will eat mediocre food if I don't have to stand in a line.

30
00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:37.720
I can actually sit down like a human being.

31
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.413
<v 0>MMM.</v>

32
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.420
<v 1>I know the food is good,
but I don't,
I just don't understand.</v>

33
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:45.150
You're standing there like a fucking bread breadline like it's the middle of a

34
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:48.810
war or some shit.
All right.
You live in the United States of America.

35
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:51.720
We don't stand in fucking line for food.

36
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.540
We want to our fat asses up.

37
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.270
<v 2>Okay.</v>

38
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.910
<v 1>You just hand it to me so I'm not going to name the place,</v>

39
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:02.680
but I went to this place.
It was,
it was halfway the bread fucking

40
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.120
<v 2>dunk.
You know what I mean?</v>

41
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.040
How do you make fucking king crab only taste.
Okay.

42
00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:13.280
You know how you get shitty bread.
Other than that,
it was a,

43
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.190
it was definitely a good time.
And um,

44
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.190
<v 0>okay,</v>

45
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.250
<v 1>such a beautiful city,
despite all the dirty white people up here,</v>

46
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.410
there's a major fucking,
you know.

47
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.750
<v 0>Okay.</v>

48
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.270
<v 1>I want to avoid using the word grunge.
I think that was just a nice way.
It just,</v>

49
00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:32.630
Dick fucking,
there was some dirty fucking white people up there.
I don't,

50
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:36.950
I don't understand it.
Just there in Denver.
Those are the two,

51
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.410
the two filthiest white people that actually have money.

52
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.740
Like you have too much money to be that filthy.

53
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:50.741
Like when you go to Denver and those fucking dread locked like man Sandal

54
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:55.820
wearing like always looking like you just got off a fucking one of those blow up

55
00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:59.830
tubes,
you know,
smoking,
you fucking whatever the,

56
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.310
whatever they're doing out there,
you know,
hairy arm print type of shit.
Uh,

57
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.840
worse than San Francisco.
I don't mind any of those styles.
If he,

58
00:03:08.841 --> 00:03:09.674
if he obeyed,

59
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.750
<v 2>it's 2016 Jesus Christ,
um,
up here.
And it's not like they're like a,</v>

60
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.220
is it probably just

61
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.070
<v 1>me being an old man,
I can't honestly say none of them smelled,
but they just,</v>

62
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:22.350
they look like,
you know,

63
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.810
<v 2>you wouldn't want to borrow anything that they used.</v>

64
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.920
<v 1>Why am I starting off this?
Me,
I started off so nice.</v>

65
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.460
<v 2>I was saying how beautiful it is.
It's such a,</v>

66
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.190
the layout of the city is fucking perfect.
And um,

67
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.940
they,
even within new stadiums that they made,

68
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.230
like I actually am old school as far as I loved it back when they just had the

69
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:49.660
kingdom,
you know,
and they had that great,

70
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:53.740
like when this Seattle Supersonics had like,
you know,
that the skyline,

71
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.190
I know that they had the space needle and I believe they had the kingdom there

72
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.810
unless was supposed to be key arena.
I have no idea.
But those two arenas,

73
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.760
um,
were and are two of the coolest places ever.

74
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.670
I saw Seattle Supersonics game there,
uh,

75
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.190
the last year they were there.

76
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:16.330
And it was Kevin Durant's first year somewhere.
I Dunno,

77
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.290
I have a picture of him in the Seattle Seahawks,
a CLC oak,
Seattle soup,

78
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.830
Seattle Sonics,
I should say.
Um,
uniform.

79
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.460
And then back in the day when I was just doing college gigs,

80
00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:32.410
traveling the road by myself,
I'm driving a Chrysler,

81
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.050
Chrysler k cod.
If,
um,
I went to a game,
uh,

82
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.110
Seattle Mariners game at the Kingdom and Ken Griffey Jr was still on the team.

83
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:45.580
It's how long ago was this?
Was like the late nineties,

84
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.320
possibly early two thousands,
I forget when he went to the reds,
but um,

85
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.251
I deliberately,

86
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:56.251
I bought us one single center field seat and I got almost like the front row.

87
00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:59.080
I think I was the second row.

88
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.650
And this is some sports fan geek shit.

89
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.950
I sat there because not only do I want to watch Griffey play,

90
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.400
but I also wanted to like every night on sports center,

91
00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:13.240
whenever they showed a game at the kingdom and somebody hit a home run,

92
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.360
there was like this weird little runway like I'll way,

93
00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:20.140
and you'd see people chasing after the ball.
And I wanted the opportunity to,
uh,

94
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.880
to do that,
which I did all by myself.
I didn't get the fucking ball.
And,

95
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:27.040
um,
so whatever.
Um,

96
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.250
<v 1>but having said all that,</v>

97
00:05:29.251 --> 00:05:33.760
if you ever visit Seattle in May or June and it's all sunny and you're like,

98
00:05:33.761 --> 00:05:35.350
oh my God,
I could live here,

99
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.210
make sure you come back in like January or December of some one of those

100
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:43.900
fucking,
you know,
I understand Kurt Cobain now

101
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.270
<v 2>one of those months.
But anyways,
we're uh,
we're performing that tonight.
Uh,</v>

102
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:53.920
I'm recording this podcast Sunday afternoon cause uh,
I got to get back,

103
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.883
um,

104
00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.790
and go back to the writer's working on episode five of you buddy five out of

105
00:06:00.791 --> 00:06:04.640
number 10.
And uh,
once we get this one done,
it's all downhill from there.

106
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.320
Uh,
really excited about this episode

107
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.290
<v 4>and I don't know,
I'm hoping you guys are gonna like it.
But anyways,</v>

108
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.973
um,

109
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.030
so big thank you to everybody who came out to Edmonton last night and went out

110
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:20.654
to Calgary.

111
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.920
Calgary might've been the best sound I've,

112
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.950
I've ever heard at a show.

113
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.990
I was standing backstage and Nate Kraig was onstage.

114
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.570
I mean the backstage area,

115
00:06:33.571 --> 00:06:38.390
and usually in most venues when you're standing to the side of the stage,

116
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:41.990
you can barely understand the person.
Just the way the sound is bouncing around.

117
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.250
I'm sure it's fine in the house,
but like,
um,
you know,

118
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.710
so many times I'll be with Bart,

119
00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:50.190
nick a VRC is something that literally just be like,
dude,
yeah,

120
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.360
that new bit bit I did about blah,
blah,
blah.
And I was like,
you know,

121
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:57.310
I was trying to,
but I couldn't quite hear it because of the sound.
MMM.

122
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:03.310
I was standing almost like directly behind where and behind a curtain when Nate

123
00:07:03.831 --> 00:07:07.160
was on stage and I could hear the guy absolutely perfectly.
And

124
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.990
it was just fucking,
I was fucking awesome.
It was just a great Gig,

125
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:12.920
both of the gigs.

126
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.353
<v 0>MMM.</v>

127
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.020
<v 4>And then the next day,
you know,
we got up,
we drove up to Edmonton,
which,</v>

128
00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:19.741
believe it or not,

129
00:07:19.741 --> 00:07:24.060
I've done that drive like three times and I'm just beautiful,

130
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.600
beautiful fucking country up in Canada.
Absolutely gorgeous.

131
00:07:27.601 --> 00:07:31.980
I would go out of my fucking mind.
I think if I did the road enough though,

132
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.340
if I just flew to other places and then I could come back,

133
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.320
that's how I really view all these places,

134
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.960
<v 2>you know,
that are considered the middle of nowhere.</v>

135
00:07:39.961 --> 00:07:44.961
They're like these paradises but I think I would lose my mind if all I did was

136
00:07:45.211 --> 00:07:47.540
live out there.
Like I understand the people when they come up to you,

137
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.790
they're like,
oh my God,
I want to get outta here.
You know,

138
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.610
this is the middle of fucking nowhere.
And I'm always,
you know,

139
00:07:53.611 --> 00:07:57.030
coming from la where everybody's living on top of each other and we have no

140
00:07:57.031 --> 00:08:00.660
water and shit.
I'm like,
dude,
you are living in the garden of Eden.
Okay.

141
00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:05.661
This is as good as it gets is far as natural resources,

142
00:08:06.121 --> 00:08:07.800
four seasons and that type of shit.

143
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.670
Although it was cold as fuck when we were up there as poor may anyways,

144
00:08:11.671 --> 00:08:14.100
I mean the last night in Edmonton it was actually sleeping

145
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.740
<v 4>fucking crazy.
But,
um,</v>

146
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.450
we ended up driving obviously up to a Edmonton and that night at the Gig,

147
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.330
<v 2>this might have been the weirdest fucking venue I've played in a long time.</v>

148
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:29.330
It was essentially I took a picture of it.

149
00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:34.331
It was essentially a giant tent that had a little bit of an upper deck

150
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.640
<v 4>in the back.
And um,
there was no carpeting.</v>

151
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:40.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

152
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:42.640
<v 2>Like behind me,
they didn't,</v>

153
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.120
you had all this fucking equipment for the lights and everything and they

154
00:08:46.121 --> 00:08:47.770
usually,
they,
they dress it up,

155
00:08:47.771 --> 00:08:50.880
they put a curtain there so people don't have to look at it.
But they did.

156
00:08:50.881 --> 00:08:53.290
And it was like this giant eyesore behind me.

157
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:58.080
And I was standing on this concrete slab that had no,

158
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:03.060
no carpeting,
no nothing.
The floor was all concrete.
They just had chairs,

159
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.520
the sides of the walls.
I didn't know what they were made of.

160
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:07.560
All I know was I was on stage.

161
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.940
I felt like I was like screaming and a giant garage.

162
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:16.350
Like I,
it seemed loud to me,
but I couldn't tell if it was loud.

163
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.820
I didn't see anybody complaining.

164
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:20.700
But like my ears are kind of ringing today and I've got a couple of tweets.

165
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.310
<v 4>People were saying like,
like,
dude,</v>

166
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:26.670
you sounded like you were yelling into a megaphone into a microphone.

167
00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:30.870
So my apologies.
I wish somebody had mentioned something on one of the shows.

168
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:31.681
I would have toned it down.

169
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:34.940
But sometimes when you have that you can't hear yourself.
But I ended up,
uh,

170
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:41.200
I sent a picture to Nia and I could've,
should've had the tweet of the,
uh,

171
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.310
the message she sent me,
the text

172
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.170
<v 2>that she sent me,
she said that looks like a venue where one of those,</v>

173
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.590
those fake televangelist,

174
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.533
<v 4>you know,</v>

175
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.800
<v 2>you have plants in the crowd and they go to like cure him and shit.
And um,</v>

176
00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.860
I'll post a picture of it and it always,
I always say,
I'll fucking do it then.

177
00:09:59.861 --> 00:10:03.730
I never do,
but I'll,
I'll try to do it this time.
You know what,
whatever,

178
00:10:03.731 --> 00:10:07.840
if you follow the MMP on,
on fucking a,
on Twitter,
maybe it'll be up there.

179
00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:11.590
I have no idea.
But I'm,
before I go any further,
uh,

180
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.650
I forgot to mention the all things comedy network is really doing well.
I,

181
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.330
because I'm a terrible businessman,
I never bring it up,

182
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.620
<v 4>but um,
we got some people to invest in it.</v>

183
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.950
We're going to start creating some more content,
uh,

184
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:29.580
content and that type of stuff and um,
you know,
really tried to,

185
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.400
<v 2>and I'll join forces with other comics and hopefully make some comics some money</v>

186
00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:37.580
off of that thing and get you guys some good comedy.
Everybody works.

187
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.810
We keep the big Fuckos out of the week,
you know,
or at very least,
you know,

188
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.770
keep them from taking the rights of everybody's fucking shows.
You know,

189
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:50.300
that always seems to be like the,
the business plan.
Like,
okay,
yeah,
we'll invest.

190
00:10:50.301 --> 00:10:53.540
All right,
we own everything.
You work for us.
You go fuck yourself.

191
00:10:53.541 --> 00:10:57.020
We'll sleep in bed and make mailbox money and you'll be on the road when you're

192
00:10:57.021 --> 00:11:01.100
90.
Sound good.
No,
it doesn't.
Well,
it's going to be good exposure.

193
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.000
So what they always say,
find a young comics out there.

194
00:11:05.001 --> 00:11:07.130
Anytime anybody tries to pay you an exposure.

195
00:11:07.131 --> 00:11:10.010
Anytime they say it's good exposure,
that means you're getting fucked.

196
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:12.763
<v 4>MMM.</v>

197
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:17.220
<v 2>All right.
Also,
this Thursday I'm doing a charity show.</v>

198
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.050
<v 4>MMM.</v>

199
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.790
<v 2>This Thursday,
8:00 PM at the comedy store,</v>

200
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:26.440
100% of the money goes towards helping children who are fighting cancer,

201
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:31.550
<v 4>um,
to have as normal of childhood as possible while they're going through the</v>

202
00:11:31.551 --> 00:11:35.120
treatment and all that.
Uh,
the tickets are available at the comedy store.

203
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.800
After the show,
we'll,
uh,

204
00:11:36.801 --> 00:11:40.700
we'll put up a link for anyone who can't make it if they want to donate.
Um,

205
00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:43.790
Steve Simone puts the thing together and um,
he's been doing great things.

206
00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:45.830
He's been having comics go to hospitals and stuff like that,

207
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.390
<v 2>that this,
this is a charity that I can get behind,</v>

208
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.950
which brings me back to the mysterious red nose campaign.
Yeah.

209
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.350
So I'm a bunch of people were looking into that,

210
00:11:57.351 --> 00:12:01.550
founded very vague and now I guess it helps out poor children.

211
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.530
That's why you have the clown noses,

212
00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.400
which is hilarious to me because I think it's pretty much mainstream knowledge

213
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.930
that clowns kind of scare the shit out of most children and,
and a lot of adults.

214
00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.160
I just don't understand why you got to have the stupid clown nose.

215
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.360
What are you going to do with that fucking thing other than just throw it out

216
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:22.650
and it is going to be,
you know,

217
00:12:22.651 --> 00:12:25.830
it's going to end up in the fucking ocean and then back in the fish that you
eat.

218
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.870
It's so fucking dumb.

219
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:29.070
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

220
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.730
<v 2>Like it's not enough to just say,
listen,
we're helping out poor children.</v>

221
00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:37.620
Do people still say,
Nah,
I didn't want to do that.
And you've got to be like,

222
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.520
well what if we give you a little red nose?
He knows.
You're like,
okay,

223
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.320
it sounds like a good idea.

224
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.170
<v 5>Okay.</v>

225
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.890
<v 2>That's such like a fucking,
I don't know.
I think it's like a hacky charity thing.</v>

226
00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:53.840
It all started with the,
uh,
I think it was the aids ribbon was the first thing.

227
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:55.251
What was it?

228
00:12:55.251 --> 00:13:00.170
The quilt and then came the Lance Armstrong live strong things.

229
00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.850
Right.
And I dunno,
somewhere in there was the super finger.

230
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.060
I have no fucking,
I,
I don't,
I don't pretend to know these things

231
00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.540
anyways.
What am I,
what the hell am I on my own?

232
00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.510
It's this fucking new thing is driving me nuts.

233
00:13:15.511 --> 00:13:17.520
I'm so used to not having to look at these fucking,

234
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:23.430
this garage band shit.
Um,
oh is a nice creepy thing.

235
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.060
It's really not a nice creepy thing.
It's just sort of a fucking creepy thing.

236
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.470
So we rented this car when we drove up from Calgary to drove up to Edmonton from

237
00:13:31.471 --> 00:13:36.450
Calgary and we had the thing actually picked it up at the airport.

238
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.650
And um,
yeah,

239
00:13:40.651 --> 00:13:43.830
we were driving over to the casino.
That's what it was driving over it casino.

240
00:13:43.831 --> 00:13:46.620
And I find,
I just look on the dashboard.
I'm like,
what the fuck is that?

241
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.740
What does that on the day?
I'm like,
is that a camera?

242
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:55.200
I think it was a camera and I think it was pointed at us cause there was nothing

243
00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:58.990
in the front.
I don't know if it was the gps antenna.

244
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.990
I don't know what the fuck it was,
but it was really creepy.

245
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.950
So they of course through a fucking newspaper over the goddamn thing.

246
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.670
And um,
when I got back to the hotel,

247
00:14:10.671 --> 00:14:14.840
I looked up about cars and cameras and they found this article here,
it says,

248
00:14:14.841 --> 00:14:18.410
is your rental car companies spying on you and you're driving?

249
00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.890
Here's how they do it.
All right.

250
00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.030
Rental card giant Hertz has admitted it is,

251
00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:31.120
it has cameras installed in about one in eight of its cars in the United States.

252
00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.820
But those cameras built into Hertz is never lost.

253
00:14:34.821 --> 00:14:39.821
Dashboard assistant that offers routing help and local city guides have never

254
00:14:40.161 --> 00:14:42.350
been turned on.
Gimme a fucking really,

255
00:14:42.351 --> 00:14:44.090
you spent all that money and he never turned them on.

256
00:14:44.091 --> 00:14:48.470
Your Lion Hertz is said loudly and repeatedly.
They've never turned them on.

257
00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.550
Understand that never lost six was launched by in early 2014.

258
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.480
The product has been out there for over a year and only now is it causing flat.

259
00:14:56.481 --> 00:15:00.110
Probably because most wrenches began noticing a creepy camera pointed at them.

260
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:01.820
Understand too.

261
00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:05.860
There were excellent reasons to worry about car rental companies spike a company

262
00:15:05.861 --> 00:15:10.550
spying on drivers.
Um,
but very probably never lost.

263
00:15:10.551 --> 00:15:14.090
Six is not one of them.
Hurts said his last.
It has,

264
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:17.840
it lacked the bandwidth to use the cameras anyway,

265
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.640
but it has been so scorched,

266
00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.140
scorched so severely in the media flap of the past week said industry experts

267
00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:28.430
indicate that hurts now would be just about the last company to spy on its

268
00:15:28.431 --> 00:15:29.180
customers.

269
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.170
Does any of that make any sense that you'd put a camera in there and then you

270
00:15:33.171 --> 00:15:35.660
wouldn't use it?
You would install a camera and all?

271
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:37.460
We're just a little mom and pop place.

272
00:15:37.461 --> 00:15:41.720
We don't have the fucking bandwidth for some of this.
Shit's funny.

273
00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.810
They actually find some people like hundreds,

274
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:47.900
sometimes thousands of dollars using this shit and basically,

275
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:50.300
you know when you rent a car and they go,
okay,

276
00:15:50.301 --> 00:15:54.740
you got to stay in the tristate area or not leaving California.
Right.

277
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.340
Some fucking guy.
He ended up,
he left California,

278
00:15:58.341 --> 00:16:01.340
went to Nevada and then Arizona and then they gave him a,

279
00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.840
<v 1>I dunno where the fuck it was.</v>

280
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:10.540
<v 2>He was slapped with a bill of $3,405 and 5 cents by adding $1 per mile to each</v>

281
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:13.880
of the 28 74 miles.

282
00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:17.900
He had driven because he had cracked cross the California state line into
Nevada.

283
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.720
To me.
That's funny.
Okay.
Cause that guy's a piece of shit.

284
00:16:22.721 --> 00:16:25.210
He lied to the car company.
All right.

285
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:27.970
I'm not just saying hertz is a piece of shit.

286
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.720
People who buy rental cars and they treat them like shit are also pieces of shit

287
00:16:31.721 --> 00:16:32.290
but I don't,
I don't,

288
00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.710
but to sit there and film people and then you know they're going to start

289
00:16:35.711 --> 00:16:38.860
recording conversations.
Do you want to stand like in the future?

290
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.810
Okay.
You go to run for president.
Like what could like

291
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.930
bring you down is some fucked up thing.

292
00:16:47.931 --> 00:16:51.290
You said some argument you had in the car with some girlfriend you're not even

293
00:16:51.291 --> 00:16:55.670
with 20 years earlier and they just bring that up in the middle of the debate.

294
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.220
Like I think in the future,
like they're lit up.

295
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:02.420
Like once you become a public figure,
they will just have on a disk,
you know?

296
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.280
And it's all going to be logged.

297
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:05.600
<v 5>Okay.</v>

298
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.320
<v 1>Anything you ever fucking did like questionable shit.</v>

299
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.650
Good Shit that you did all the balance.
You know,

300
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:17.570
they'll probably just have like a pie chart.
Okay.
His,
his life disk,
you know,

301
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:21.680
and the good stuff is in whatever green or yellow man.
Right.

302
00:17:21.681 --> 00:17:25.430
All a nice friendly fucking covers and then the bad shit,

303
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.140
we'll be all in like red.

304
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:29.363
<v 5>MMM.</v>

305
00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.350
<v 1>I don't know.
If you're prone to depression,</v>

306
00:17:31.351 --> 00:17:35.280
there'll be like some blue in there and they'll just look at the big pie chart

307
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.460
and try to judge it.
Then overall,
what kind of a fucking person you are?

308
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.740
It's just,
it's,
I don't know.
It's really creepy.

309
00:17:40.741 --> 00:17:45.030
This is another one that was funny to me.
It says in,
in Florida,

310
00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:50.400
rental car companies are notorious for literally shutting engines of cars

311
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.680
<v 2>that cross straight state lines.</v>

312
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.300
The cars may be restart started upon agreement to pay the new fees.

313
00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.420
That's fucking hilarious.
He is my question.

314
00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.260
How do you know they're not in the left lane doing 90 miles an hour with

315
00:18:06.261 --> 00:18:10.040
somebody on that bumper and you're just going to shut off the car that you have

316
00:18:10.041 --> 00:18:12.080
to wait until the car stops.
I would like to

317
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.180
<v 0>think that,
but,
um,</v>

318
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.590
<v 2>I dunno.
Pardon me.</v>

319
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.400
I don't mind if they track you with the gps as far as that.

320
00:18:23.401 --> 00:18:25.890
And if you leave the state lines,
I mean that's only fair.

321
00:18:25.891 --> 00:18:28.410
You fucking lying to them and the technology exists.

322
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.790
But that shit to start recording conversations and uh,

323
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.540
videotaping you is like,
I dunno man,

324
00:18:36.541 --> 00:18:38.190
that really crosses a line.

325
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:40.183
<v 0>MMM.</v>

326
00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.630
<v 2>I Dunno.
Some people say,
well,
what about all these assholes texting,
driving,</v>

327
00:18:43.631 --> 00:18:47.680
they're there.
You know,
they killing people and that type of shit.

328
00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:49.570
There has to be a better way.
What do you guys think?

329
00:18:49.571 --> 00:18:50.920
There's gotta be a better way to keep,

330
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.980
<v 5>okay.</v>

331
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.260
<v 2>I mean,
I didn't know how safe you have to make the world.
I mean,</v>

332
00:18:55.261 --> 00:18:57.900
there's too many fucking people.
Can you let some people die?
I mean,

333
00:18:57.901 --> 00:19:01.980
I know that's really morbid to say that shit,
but,
um,
I dunno.

334
00:19:01.981 --> 00:19:04.680
I'm kind of a fucked up person.
So why,
why,
why would you listen to me?

335
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.690
Why would you listen to this podcast?
Oh,
I know why you're on your way to work.

336
00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:13.680
You're at the gym,
you let him have the fuck you're doing.
So let's,
uh,

337
00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.980
should we do,
oh man,
I had a really bad,

338
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.890
a bad little social full power.
I have after the Calgary thing,

339
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.940
I was walking over to the hotel and,
um,

340
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.590
I was trying to get into the elevator because the ones in the lobby,

341
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.600
sometimes you go through the lobby,
you know,

342
00:19:30.601 --> 00:19:34.530
people want pictures and shit like that,
which is cool,
but daddy wants to drink.

343
00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.440
So I was trying to get through there as fast as I could.
And one of the guys,

344
00:19:41.441 --> 00:19:46.090
you know,
was that the,
you know,
one of the,
um,
the guys who worked at Sorta,

345
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.790
you know,
this elevator door opened and I fucking,

346
00:19:48.791 --> 00:19:51.610
he just sorta told me to come in and I just stepped in forming these people and

347
00:19:51.611 --> 00:19:54.940
walked on me and Nate and the,
and the promoter and the door's closed.

348
00:19:54.941 --> 00:19:57.660
And as we were going up,
Nate goes,
um,

349
00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.570
did we just step in front of a woman in a wheelchair waiting for an elevator?

350
00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.090
And then it dawned on me,
cause I did see her,

351
00:20:04.091 --> 00:20:07.600
but I was in such a selfish moment of I don't want to take any pictures or

352
00:20:07.601 --> 00:20:10.510
anything.
I just want to get back down.
It's because the bar was closing.

353
00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.220
That's right.
And you know,

354
00:20:12.221 --> 00:20:14.620
we had a great night and it's not the better after a show,

355
00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:18.190
you're all fucking amped up from the excitement of doing it.

356
00:20:18.191 --> 00:20:21.220
And it went well that you can't just go back to your hotel room,
go to sleep.

357
00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:24.570
Do you want to sit down and shoot the shit or whatever?
So we will.
That's right.

358
00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:28.150
We will make it a mad dash to get down to the bar before the foreclose.

359
00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.190
Now that's a lie.
They were actually keeping an open for us.

360
00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.890
There was really no reason for me to do it other than my own selfish things.

361
00:20:32.891 --> 00:20:36.380
I didn't feel like taking a picture.
So I ran in there and um,

362
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.333
<v 0>yeah,</v>

363
00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.600
<v 2>that has been bugging me for the last 48 fucking hours.</v>

364
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:44.860
Nate heard her say something sad of like said something.
Well,

365
00:20:44.861 --> 00:20:48.040
I guess we're not getting on this one,
you know,
classic,

366
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.920
<v 1>polite Canadian.
So I dunno if whatever fucking reason,</v>

367
00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:55.360
if you're the person pushing the person that wheelchair,
my apologies.
Oh,

368
00:20:55.361 --> 00:20:57.100
freckles was a selfish cunt there.

369
00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.470
I'm literally getting embarrassed telling the story right now,
but that,

370
00:21:01.471 --> 00:21:04.090
that legitimately happened and it was me.

371
00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.740
I Dunno if my rental car company has video or audio of it,
you know,

372
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.830
I'm getting out in front of the stories what I'm doing.
All right,

373
00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:13.330
enough of that big brother Shit.

but it's now,
it's not easy anymore,

402
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.750
but it was always Dr Carver's.
I just,
you know I have some sort of

403
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:50.703
<v 0>mmm,</v>

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.060
<v 1>oh I was kid.
I'm stupid.</v>

405
00:22:52.061 --> 00:22:54.850
You know I was going to say some sort of reading disability.
That's a copout.

406
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:58.150

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:34.960
<v 1>okay.</v>

450
00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:35.191
<v 4>All right.</v>

451
00:25:35.191 --> 00:25:39.240
Let me get rid of all of this fucking copy here so I can get onto the questions

452
00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.950
and all of that shit.
By the way,

453
00:25:40.951 --> 00:25:45.951
did anybody watch game four of the Saint Louie?

454
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.250
<v 1>Louie me yet the fair they gave the fucking shacks.</v>

455
00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.510
You'll right there Fred.

456
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.460
I'm not going to lie to you as a complete bandwagon fan.

457
00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:01.190
This is one of the biggest examples of bandwagon fan shit you'll ever see is me

458
00:26:01.191 --> 00:26:06.160
becoming a blues fan.
You know,
just picking a team,
right?
And uh,
I,

459
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:07.320
after they

460
00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.730
<v 4>lost game two and game three and how great the sharps loved,
I was just like,</v>

461
00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.590
I was talking to my buddy going like,
and these guys look like they're dialed in.

462
00:26:16.591 --> 00:26:18.780
I think the shops are going to win the whole fucking thing.

463
00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.900
And this is just been such a weird series.

464
00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.120
<v 1>Okay.
Like game two,
three and four,
you know,</v>

465
00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:30.650
it's like sharks dominated two and three and then it's like they didn't even

466
00:26:30.651 --> 00:26:31.520
fucking shut and don't,

467
00:26:31.521 --> 00:26:34.640
it's like the blues didn't even show up games two and three and I'm thinking

468
00:26:34.641 --> 00:26:36.710
like,
God,
the sharks got him figured out.

469
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:41.720
They're going to make quick work of them.
And then the blue show up last night,

470
00:26:41.721 --> 00:26:44.130
it was like fucking game two or three never happened.

471
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.900
<v 2>So I can't figure it out.</v>

472
00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:49.500
Something on Twitter send me something saying these games of suck because

473
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:53.730
they've been so one sided.
Um,
and I wouldn't argue,

474
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.060
I wouldn't argue that they haven't been actually the most compelling games.

475
00:26:57.061 --> 00:26:59.850
They just been like three out of four games.

476
00:26:59.851 --> 00:27:04.680
It's just been a real fucking kick to the balls there.
So,
so we'll see.

477
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.200
We'll see.
Um,

478
00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:07.570
<v 5>okay.</v>

479
00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:11.710
<v 2>Isa,
I have no fucking clue anymore.
I thought after two and three,
I was like,</v>

480
00:27:11.711 --> 00:27:13.750
not only of the shark's going to beat the blues,

481
00:27:13.751 --> 00:27:17.890
they're gonna win the whole fucking thing because I'm not impressed with,
uh,

482
00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:18.940
I mean,
I liked the lightening,

483
00:27:18.941 --> 00:27:21.670
but they lost their fucking goaltender and I thought that they were done.

484
00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:24.800
I thought they were fucking done.
And now all of a sudden,
you know,

485
00:27:24.801 --> 00:27:28.480
the fucking penguins won two in a row and then fucking Tampa cans,
but oh Jesus,

486
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.040
<v 1>about two to two.
I swear to God,
if I didn't know better,</v>

487
00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:35.640
that fucking piece of shit.
David Stern is one of the Goddamn Nhl right now.

488
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.640
It seems like he wants both of the series to go seven games.

489
00:27:38.641 --> 00:27:40.710
Everybody makes their fucking money,
right?

490
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.110
They would never do something like that.

491
00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:44.350
<v 5>Okay.</v>

492
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:48.490
<v 1>What are they,
the NFL,
um,
oh Jesus,
help me.
I can't be in such a,</v>

493
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:53.440
such a Goddamn con.
Um,
and I'm sort of paying attention to the basketball.

494
00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:56.020
I just don't have time.
And I was really hoping

495
00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:02.580
that the Cleveland Cavaliers were going to go 16 and old and win a title on two

496
00:28:02.741 --> 00:28:03.940
different levels.
One,

497
00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:09.190
Cleveland would win a title and all those sad sack Cleveland fans could quit

498
00:28:09.191 --> 00:28:12.880
with this stupid basset hound faces.
You know what I mean?

499
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:18.130
Cleveland fans are so fucking sad and so many people just don't even give a
shit.

500
00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.830
I mean,
they just have the loneliest look on their face.

501
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:25.540
At least when Boston quote and win a world series New York had the decency to

502
00:28:25.541 --> 00:28:27.250
give a fuck enough to trash us,

503
00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:30.100
which was always funny to me when you really thought about it.
It's like,

504
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:31.720
why are you wasting your time?

505
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:35.800
They were like Walmart getting mad at the one mom and pop store up the fucking

506
00:28:35.801 --> 00:28:38.500
street because we were also trying to sell rakes.
Right?

507
00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:44.000
Like why do you give a shit?
Um,
but no one cares about,

508
00:28:44.001 --> 00:28:47.850
I don't know,
Ohio.
It's amazing the amount of,

509
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.360
of musicians,
fighters,
football coaches,

510
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.070
entertainers,

511
00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:58.430
the list of famous people from Ohio might be the most impressive of out of all

512
00:28:58.431 --> 00:29:01.430
the 50 states.
And uh,

513
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:06.080
they don't get any respect and,
but she'd go out there.
It's just,
yeah,
I know.

514
00:29:06.081 --> 00:29:10.940
It's just kind of boring.
It's a boring ass state to fucking drive through.

515
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:12.980
<v 5>Okay.</v>

516
00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.110
<v 1>I Dunno,
but they're nice people,
but I don't really,</v>

517
00:29:15.111 --> 00:29:18.570
I don't know if I have sympathy for Cleveland fans as much as they love

518
00:29:18.571 --> 00:29:22.670
Cleveland.
It's like,
yeah,
well why don't you live there?
Nobody lives there.

519
00:29:22.671 --> 00:29:26.740
It's like a fucking ghost town,
I guess.
Gradually it's coming back.
You know,

520
00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.120
who gives a fuck?
I just like shitting on people anyway,

521
00:29:29.121 --> 00:29:32.830
so I wanted to see them go 16 and all because it would be great to see Lebron

522
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.050
come back.
You know,
after all the Cleveland fans who are burning,

523
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.950
burning his jersey when he left,
you know,
I always,

524
00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:44.970
that is the fucking thing ever just to go out and burn somebody's Jersey is the

525
00:29:45.191 --> 00:29:49.090
news.
Cameras are filming you.
It's like,
how fucking old are you?

526
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.720
Are you really this emotionally invested in your fucking team?
I mean,

527
00:29:52.721 --> 00:29:56.590
I love sports as much as anybody.
I remember when,

528
00:29:56.591 --> 00:29:57.730
what's his face left?

529
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.630
Ray Allen went to the heat and all these Celtics fans were mad.
It's like,
dude,

530
00:30:01.631 --> 00:30:02.620
that's how we got them.

531
00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:06.840
<v 4>You know,
he started with the bucks and then he'd fall.</v>

532
00:30:06.841 --> 00:30:09.390
He once there's somebody a as a free agent,

533
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.760
don't ever give you a heart to the person.
I'm telling you,

534
00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:16.200
you can't go 100% in because they,
you know,
they got that fucking,

535
00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:20.100
they got that wonder and I sometimes they stay like big poppy,

536
00:30:20.101 --> 00:30:22.380
but most of the times,
you know,
they come,
they come through town,

537
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.710
they pile on a team,
they win a championship,

538
00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:29.910
they start acting like they're fucking magic Johnson and the Lakers or some
shit.

539
00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.970
Larry Bird,
you know,
when they're really just,
you know,

540
00:30:32.971 --> 00:30:36.480
they're window shopping throughout the fucking leak.
Um,

541
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:40.270
but anyways,
one of the cool things,
if they actually went 16 and old,

542
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.760
it would be so fucked up

543
00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.273
<v 3>that</v>

544
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:45.220
<v 4>the Golden State Warriors,
right.</v>

545
00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:50.330
I'm assuming they make it to the finals would go 73 and nine beating the 96

546
00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:55.381
bowls and having the greatest regular season of all time and then losing the

547
00:30:55.991 --> 00:30:59.230
championship game to me would have been like,
you know,

548
00:30:59.231 --> 00:31:01.360
it's like the fucking 2008 patriots.

549
00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.830
It's like they went 16 and oh and like I don't,
nobody gives a fuck.

550
00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.450
<v 1>Nobody's ever going to give a fuck about that.
Cause all 16 and oh does as well.</v>

551
00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.100
They would say the one.
That's the next thing is did they go,

552
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:18.250
did they run the table now and then they lost the last one.

553
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.600
You know,
something actually having lived through that,

554
00:31:22.601 --> 00:31:24.670
why would I wrote that for that?
For Golden State.

555
00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:25.863
<v 4>I Dunno.</v>

556
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:29.200
You notice there's something about Lebron that I actually feel bad about the
guy.

557
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.740
I felt bad for the guy.
I don't know what it is.
You know,

558
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.410
he never seems to be on strong footing with the crowd.

559
00:31:35.411 --> 00:31:40.411
They always seem to somehow not like the guy and he's out there like superman

560
00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:44.210
every night.
Um,
who's getting her?
We brought her on him.

561
00:31:44.211 --> 00:31:47.440
His agent brought it on him,
but that stupid fucking press conference,

562
00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.073
<v 3>you know,</v>

563
00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.760
<v 4>doing his whole fucking life story.</v>

564
00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:56.060
And then he just decided to take my talents to south

565
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.840
<v 1>beach.
He didn't even say,
he didn't say Miami.</v>

566
00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:02.320
It was one of the worst worded fucking statements ever.

567
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.020
I've decided to take my talents to south beach.

568
00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.310
It's like you're going to leave these pound puppy looking sad sacks and

569
00:32:09.311 --> 00:32:11.950
Cleveland freezing their fucking balls off.

570
00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.980
You're going to talk about your talent and then you tell them them that you're

571
00:32:14.981 --> 00:32:18.710
going to the beach.
You know what?
I don't feel bad for him.

572
00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:22.660
I don't know.
I really like Lebron,

573
00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:27.390
so I would like to see Lebron when one in,

574
00:32:27.391 --> 00:32:32.130
in Cleveland.
It's great.
He gets it for the city.
But uh,
when he does,
when it,

575
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:33.960
if he does,
I will.

576
00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.770
I will really miss seeing those sad sack Cleveland fence that just funny to me.

577
00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:42.170
I don't know.
It is about him.
I don't feel bad from,
and when they complain,

578
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:43.100
I just laugh.

579
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:48.720
<v 4>I usually have empathy.
It's just something about him.
I don't,</v>

580
00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.720
<v 1>it's like cubs cubs fans.
Some of them aren't.</v>

581
00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:55.510
They're still mad at me for that time when I said White,

582
00:32:55.511 --> 00:32:59.590
the white sox fans were real fans and I was just taking a stab in the dark.

583
00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:04.180
I was just fucking around because this guy was talking about when the bears beat

584
00:33:04.181 --> 00:33:06.610
the fuck out of the Patriots in the Superbowl.

585
00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:11.230
So I just did the oldest trick in the book.
I just went divide and conquer,

586
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:15.700
and I just said that white sox sands were better than cubs fans and it worked.

587
00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:17.900
You know what I mean?
Years later some,

588
00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:21.420
<v 4>you know,
they're,
they're in first please.
We'll do the fucking,</v>

589
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:23.500
one of the worst attendance tendencies in the league.

590
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:24.770
<v 1>It's like,
oh,</v>

591
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:28.600
ever just go to your stupid game and take your fucking shirt off and act like

592
00:33:28.601 --> 00:33:29.650
you're in the big chill.

593
00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:38.120
<v 4>Um,
anyways.
Okay.</v>

594
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:42.950
<v 1>The cubs actually won it.
That's,
that's,
that's the Theo Epstein fucking saga.</v>

595
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:44.143
You know what I mean?

596
00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:49.070
Like what happened to the red sox after 2004 it was then all of a sudden it was

597
00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:52.130
like,
you know,
when your favorite band is just,
you know,

598
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.400
moving up the ladder right there.

599
00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:55.790
<v 5>Okay.</v>

600
00:33:55.790 --> 00:34:00.280
<v 4>I feel like gradually,
you know,
you know,
they're playing clubs,
local areas,</v>

601
00:34:00.281 --> 00:34:02.890
and they start going a little national and then they play big and then they get

602
00:34:02.891 --> 00:34:06.520
all the way up to their best sell selling album ever.

603
00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:10.960
And what always happens when a band that's been together for fucking 10 years,

604
00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:14.950
they make it to the mountain top.
What happens?
The whole thing implodes.

605
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.920
Everybody goes their separate ways.
Next thing you know,

606
00:34:17.921 --> 00:34:22.420
fucking David Lee Roth is singing just a Gigolo,
right?

607
00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:28.120
And Van Halen is singing about dreams with the fucking blue angels.

608
00:34:28.121 --> 00:34:31.750
Whatever happened,
I don't remember.
I tried to block it out.
I was,

609
00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:35.770
that fucking crushed me when they,
when they broke up,
um,

610
00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:38.620
he was the perfect front man for that fucking Ben.

611
00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:43.570
I love Sammy Hagar and everything would come up.
Um,
anyways.

612
00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:44.493
Uh,

613
00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:49.170
<v 1>you guys are gonna kill me,
but I completely forget what I was fucking telling.</v>

614
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:50.250
What the fuck was my point?

615
00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.720
<v 4>I literally have to sway me.
Scroll back up.</v>

616
00:34:53.721 --> 00:34:58.520
What the fuck was I just talking about?
Oh,
Theo Epstein.
Jesus Christ.
Um,

617
00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:03.360
Theo Epstein active like 2004.
I think everybody wanted the credit.

618
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:05.220
I think the fucking ownership was like,
no,

619
00:35:05.221 --> 00:35:09.810
we're the reason the 86 years curse ended at deals like,
well,
what about me?

620
00:35:09.811 --> 00:35:11.850
And then there was that weird thing where he kind of went,

621
00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:16.900
he like left for like a week.
And I remember thinking like,
fuck

622
00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:18.010
<v 5>okay,</v>

623
00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:20.590
<v 4>why couldn't they just get along?
He had a free,
we go again.</v>

624
00:35:20.591 --> 00:35:24.160
And then he came back and then,
I dunno when everything imploded.

625
00:35:24.161 --> 00:35:26.740
Whenever the fuck it did,
he ends up leaving.
He goes to the [inaudible],
the cubs.

626
00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.490
I thought he left them,
decided to stay for a couple of years.
I might be wrong,

627
00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:34.450
but he went with the cubs.
And I think that that was his ego thing.

628
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:39.060
And then the red sox won at no seven and 2013 I believe.

629
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.660
And that was our fuck youth.
You,
oh,
we can do it without you.

630
00:35:42.661 --> 00:35:44.880
So now I think for his ego,

631
00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:50.460
he's trying to become the guy who ended the curse of the baby and the curse of

632
00:35:50.461 --> 00:35:52.170
the goat.
And if he does that,
I mean,

633
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:56.130
you'd have to say he's one of the greatest whatever the fuck his position and

634
00:35:56.131 --> 00:36:01.110
see that a GM,
I don't know what he is.
Um,
curse of the goat is so fucking stupid,

635
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.960
you know what I mean?
Get your livestock off of the fucking field.

636
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:06.063
<v 0>You know,</v>

637
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:11.780
<v 4>Chris is the babe was dumb enough.
It's just like,
no,
we made a bad fucking move.</v>

638
00:36:11.781 --> 00:36:14.360
We're not a good franchise and we weren't a good franchise.

639
00:36:14.361 --> 00:36:17.860
We did make good decisions with the Yankees.
God bless him,

640
00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:19.940
did not make good decisions.

641
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:24.950
That guy was a major fucking racist and just refused until the last I,

642
00:36:24.951 --> 00:36:29.240
than we though we were the last team to,
to finally admit,

643
00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:30.380
you know,

644
00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:34.810
I guess people from other races are worthy of looking at and by then what we,

645
00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:36.570
<v 0>okay.</v>

646
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:39.510
<v 4>Even then,
I mean,
we suck when it was just all white people.
I mean,
I don't know.</v>

647
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:44.310
What are you going to do?
Um,
so anyways,
uh,
let,
let's read some of the,

648
00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:46.680
the questions here.
I know I'm babbling this week.
This is a,

649
00:36:46.681 --> 00:36:49.290
I'm a little outside of my comfort zone without the microphone in the fucking

650
00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:53.790
headset.
So,
uh,
the show will all be fixed by a Thursday.

651
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.370
Okay.
Vinyl.
Hey Billy.

652
00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:00.480
I was at Uw Madison Square Garden show and I seem to remember you mentioning

653
00:37:00.481 --> 00:37:04.950
releasing it,
releasing it on vinyl.
Is that still happening?
Um,
interesting.

654
00:37:04.951 --> 00:37:09.270
You should say that.
I have the audio and I'm going through pictures right now.

655
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.660
And um,
I am telling you right now,

656
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:15.420
I am going for big air on this one.

657
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:20.280
I am releasing the entire fucking show.
I'm not editing anything out.

658
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.610
I was happy from the second I got onto the second I left.

659
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.400
It was one of the greatest nights of my standup life.

660
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.310
I'm so happy that I have an audio recording of it.

661
00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:30.853
<v 0>MMM.</v>

662
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.730
<v 4>Cory Angelo,
one of the greatest photographers I've met in this business,</v>

663
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.810
the greatest I should say,
he took all the pictures and

664
00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:40.773
<v 0>mmm.</v>

665
00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.540
<v 4>I,
if I,
if I do this right,</v>

666
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:49.800
it's going to be a sick ass fucking record.
And uh,
I'm very,
uh,

667
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:54.720
very excited to do it.
I just have to do it the right way.
Um,

668
00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:58.650
what happens is if you want to get into the bullshit of the business is,

669
00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:03.300
and this happened with the one that I did at Carnegie Hall.
What happens is,

670
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:08.370
is when you put out a standup special you get in business with somebody like

671
00:38:08.371 --> 00:38:11.940
comedy central and Netflix or Hbo or whatever,
you know,

672
00:38:11.941 --> 00:38:16.941
usually built into the contract is that you won't release any similar material.

673
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.790
Um,
that's on the special for a specific period of time.

674
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:25.990
And um,
you know,
I'm probably going to do another special in November,

675
00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:31.060
which,
you know,
I did Madison Square Garden November of last year.

676
00:38:31.061 --> 00:38:33.920
So there's going to be enough overlap where I'm going to have to wait.

677
00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:37.430
I believe we'll have wait a little bit.
MMM.

678
00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.600
<v 1>I'll try to get around that because I haven't negotiated yet.</v>

679
00:38:40.601 --> 00:38:42.910
It would be nice if I could get around.
It'd be like,
look,
it's vinyl.

680
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:47.830
It's for fucking total comedy nerds.
This isn't going to really,
um,

681
00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:51.700
but then of course you can send up uploading it everywhere because everything

682
00:38:51.701 --> 00:38:54.070
has to be fucking uploaded and then be free.

683
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.810
I'm going to lose my fucking shirt on this,

684
00:38:55.811 --> 00:39:00.190
but I don't give a shit because I know there's people out there that appreciate

685
00:39:00.191 --> 00:39:01.860
the vinyl and that type of stuff and it's a really good,

686
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:06.490
<v 4>cool fucking thing to have.
And,
um,
Oh man,</v>

687
00:39:06.491 --> 00:39:07.870
I'm going to spend some money on this.

688
00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.970
I'm really going to spend some money on this.

689
00:39:09.971 --> 00:39:14.650
I really want to do this as first fucking class as I can.

690
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:17.830
And I was actually talking to somebody about it the other night.

691
00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:22.330
I'm somebody who makes records and he was showing me some of the shit that he's

692
00:39:22.331 --> 00:39:25.600
done and I was really impressed.
So,
um,

693
00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:29.390
<v 1>I'm literally getting excited talking about it.
So,
uh,</v>

694
00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:33.830
that's definitely happening when I can actually release the fucking thing is a

695
00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:38.810
completely different story.
So,
all right.
Basic training.

696
00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.170
Uh,
Billy bloom,
uh,

697
00:39:42.171 --> 00:39:46.760
you mentioned in a throwback clip that you would only perform for the troops in

698
00:39:46.761 --> 00:39:50.690
the Middle East if you went through basic training and was taught how to kill a

699
00:39:50.691 --> 00:39:52.880
man.
Well,
at least how to shoot a fucking gun.

700
00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:55.700
That's like my fear.

701
00:39:55.701 --> 00:40:00.701
I'm going into a fucking war zone and God forbid that gets overrun by a bunch of

702
00:40:01.941 --> 00:40:06.941
lunatics and my body guard takes one for me and he's laying on the ground and

703
00:40:08.061 --> 00:40:11.600
there's his weapon.
And I'm like,
I don't know how to work this

704
00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:18.590
standing there like Bob hope with a fucking putter.
You know,
I just,
you know,

705
00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:22.010
I know.
And they always say this shit too.
We've never lost anyone.

706
00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.730
And all the wars that we fought,
we've never lost anyone.
It,
it's just like,
dude,

707
00:40:25.731 --> 00:40:29.120
that's just like saying like,
you know what?
My car is running great.

708
00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:34.010
You don't say shit like that.
Anyways,
he said,
was wondering if,

709
00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.120
if that's as true as it was when you set it in 2008,

710
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:42.650
I believe you're in better shape these days and perhaps so is the Middle East.

711
00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:48.020
Uh,
love you love Nia.
Um,
no,
I,
yeah,
I think at this point,
you know,

712
00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.090
look through when I saw over there,

713
00:40:50.091 --> 00:40:53.450
like when I was first thinking that that was back,
you know,

714
00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:57.410
when shit was really bad and like contractors,
you know,

715
00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:01.160
which had a rock in their shoe and they would stop for half a second to get it

716
00:41:01.161 --> 00:41:03.770
out and then they just disappeared.
And then the next thing you know,

717
00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:08.140
they're getting their heads sought off.
You know?
I mean,

718
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:11.270
what a fucking way to go.
I mean,
Jesus Christ,

719
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:15.140
you know what I mean?
And I both,
so once,
one of the thing I have,

720
00:41:15.141 --> 00:41:20.141
one of the reasons why I've been any success that I've had in life is I always

721
00:41:20.331 --> 00:41:25.130
understood what I suck at.
Okay.
And I know I am not a marine.

722
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:27.230
You can give me the camouflage shit.

723
00:41:27.231 --> 00:41:30.770
You know that dumb shit when people go out and go fucking,
uh,

724
00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:35.840
do shows for the troops and they take of you sitting in a jet or like in a

725
00:41:35.841 --> 00:41:37.790
fucking tank and you're wearing a helmet,
you know,

726
00:41:37.791 --> 00:41:41.320
and for half a second you egos,
I could do this.
No,
you can't do that.

727
00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:45.440
Takes a special person to be able to do that.
And I know that's not me.

728
00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.333
<v 0>MMM.</v>

729
00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:49.190
<v 1>There were actually,
to really be honest with you,</v>

730
00:41:49.191 --> 00:41:52.520
I wouldn't want to go through basic training because I am a fucking lunatic to

731
00:41:52.521 --> 00:41:53.061
begin with.

732
00:41:53.061 --> 00:41:57.410
And the last thing I need to do is de-humanize any more people in my fucked up,

733
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:58.343
right?

734
00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:01.803
<v 0>MMM.</v>

735
00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:07.130
<v 1>Yes.
I am afraid of,
of,
you know,
to,</v>

736
00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:11.040
to go down that rabbit hole of how fucking,
how nuts am I.
Okay.

737
00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:15.240
I like to feel that I'm a mainstream psycho,
you know,

738
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:18.030
it's Kinda like my drinking.
Like I know I drink way too much,

739
00:42:18.031 --> 00:42:22.950
but I have it under control,
but I know a couple of circumstance.

740
00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:24.990
Well,
I'm too,
I'm too vain to drink myself,

741
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:29.310
<v 4>but I could,
I could definitely,
uh,
you know,</v>

742
00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:33.450
I know enough not,
I knew enough not to fuck with hard drugs,

743
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:39.180
um,
because,
uh,
I saw what they did to,
you know,

744
00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:41.350
<v 1>like everybody,
I think everybody,</v>

745
00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:42.680
<v 0>okay.</v>

746
00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:47.570
<v 4>In my country at this point for,
I hate to say it at this point,
you've,</v>

747
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:51.050
you've lost somebody to that.
And I've lost a two people,

748
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.600
two friends of mine outside of comedy,
and then,
uh,

749
00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:59.060
obviously a number of Comedians to that type of shit.
And,
um,

750
00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.980
both friends of mine and then comics that I was fans of in that type of shit.

751
00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:05.660
So I always knew not to fuck with that stuff.
Yeah.

752
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.690
<v 1>But as far as going over there,
yeah,
I would definitely do that.</v>

753
00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:12.770
I would definitely,
um,
do something like that,
but you know,

754
00:43:12.771 --> 00:43:15.260
when it was really fucking crazy over there and they,
your comments,

755
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:18.830
so telling me the way that they did do those military landings where you like it

756
00:43:18.831 --> 00:43:23.620
38,000 feet and a minute later you're on the ground.
You know,
I mean,
it's,

757
00:43:23.621 --> 00:43:25.940
it's scary enough landing in San Diego.

758
00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:29.770
I don't need somebody possibly shooting at me.

759
00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.473
<v 0>MMM.</v>

760
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:35.030
<v 1>Yeah.
And I'm just being fucking honest.
Do you know what I mean?
So,
uh,</v>

761
00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:38.820
but at this point,
yeah,
no,
I,
I wouldn't have a problem.
You know,
Jesus,

762
00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:42.030
I ever fucking go over there and something happens to me and they play this

763
00:43:42.031 --> 00:43:46.260
fucking audio,
you know,
they're going to do it in all those fucking things.
Um,

764
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:50.760
yeah.
You know,
going to war is,
is,
it's not,
that's the real deal.

765
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:53.250
And I know I don't have that in me.

766
00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:58.530
Fucking go over there with a Hawaiian shirt and that sun going over there with

767
00:43:58.531 --> 00:44:02.800
whoever the Marilyn Monroe is.
Yeah.
Day and she's got this thing and you know,

768
00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:07.780
happy birthday Mr General or whatever the fuck goes.

769
00:44:07.781 --> 00:44:10.840
I have no idea what happens on those shows.
But um,

770
00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:12.330
<v 0>okay.</v>

771
00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:17.100
<v 1>I know likes like fucking Artie Lange went to like already language into this</v>

772
00:44:17.101 --> 00:44:20.890
shit and like Afghanistan,
like fucking like crazy.

773
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:25.500
You would never catch me doing it.
Then that guy's got more balls than,

774
00:44:25.501 --> 00:44:28.420
than I would ever have.
No.
Um,
but yeah,

775
00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.920
I'll go to the big base that already has a best buy on.
I'll go to that one.

776
00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.880
Whatever military base over there that already has a monorail,
I'll,

777
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:40.300
I'll go to that one.
Maybe like an Orange Julius.
I'll check that one out.
But I,

778
00:44:40.301 --> 00:44:44.430
I would definitely do it without a doubt.
All right.
A name dropping.
Hey Bill.

779
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:46.013
<v 4>MMM.</v>

780
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:50.110
<v 1>I listened to the podcast every week,
which means my wife does as well.</v>

781
00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:54.440
<v 4>Oh Jeez.
Not another one of these.
I know women hate me.
Okay.</v>

782
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:57.470
I walked in the hotel today and this guy goes,
oh,
I didn't know you were in town.

783
00:44:57.471 --> 00:45:00.300
I said,
yeah,
you know,
playing,
play the theater down the street.
And he goes,
uh,

784
00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.650
he goes,
ah.
He goes,
you know,
I'm definitely going to go.
He goes,
you know,

785
00:45:03.651 --> 00:45:06.170
I'm going to go against my girlfriend hates you,
but I'm going to go.

786
00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:09.680
It's just like,
I get it.
I get it.
I get it.

787
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:13.130
I'm not going to change what the fuck I do though.
But I,
I understand it.

788
00:45:13.131 --> 00:45:17.970
Here we go.
All right,
so,
okay,
here.
Here it comes.
How long before I get how?
Yeah,

789
00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:21.190
<v 1>how much do I have to read before I find out that she hates me?
All right,</v>

790
00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:23.640
last week you said you didn't want to write,

791
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:28.560
you didn't want to name drop your friends name in a band.
Um,

792
00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:31.320
it started my wife down a path of questioning.

793
00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:32.130
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

794
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:35.880
<v 1>And thought I'll quote her.
Who is bill scared of?</v>

795
00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.540
You would think he's still on a playground and waiting to get beat up.

796
00:45:39.541 --> 00:45:44.340
If he acts out of order,
he's bill burr.
Who's going to give him shit?

797
00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:49.030
Um,
she has a good point.
I totally understand why you do that,

798
00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:52.750
but you'd have to drop a dozen big names that didn't even matter,

799
00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:55.260
<v 4>but what,
but you have to drop.
It</v>

800
00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:58.310
<v 1>doesn't big names that didn't even matter into a story every week for a year.</v>

801
00:45:58.311 --> 00:45:59.690
For anyone to think of you

802
00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:01.570
<v 4>as a name dropper.</v>

803
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:06.560
<v 1>Uh,
you're the best.
Come back to Rhode Island.
Um,
you know why I don't do it?</v>

804
00:46:06.561 --> 00:46:07.394
Because

805
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:12.650
<v 4>people who are in the public eye,
there's like this sort of like,
there's a,</v>

806
00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:17.140
there's an unwritten fucking rule that when you're hanging out with them,

807
00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:20.500
you're hanging out with them and then it doesn't become a fucking podcast story.

808
00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.870
You don't fucking tweet about it.
You know,
you know,

809
00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:28.690
and you don't ask for a picture.
Um,
because that's what their life is.

810
00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:34.240
And I know people that have fucked that up.
I got a buddy of mine,

811
00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:36.013
all right.

812
00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:40.380
He was golfing and uh,

813
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:44.340
he got put in this foursome with one of his favorite actors and it turned out

814
00:46:44.341 --> 00:46:49.320
the actor was a fan of his and they were having a great fucking time.
All right.

815
00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:54.130
Just shooting the shit being normal.
And in the end the guy goes,
yeah,
it's very,

816
00:46:54.131 --> 00:46:58.230
man,
I'd love to come out to a show.
And instead of saying,
all right,

817
00:46:58.231 --> 00:47:02.970
give me a number,
I'll text you next time I'm in town.
He goes,
great.

818
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:06.690
It goes,
is it hey,
is it a,
is it cool if I get a photo?
And he said,

819
00:47:06.691 --> 00:47:11.410
the guy's face just fucking dropped.
And was just like,
yeah,

820
00:47:11.411 --> 00:47:15.850
man.
Yeah,
okay,
yeah,
let's do it.
I don't want to do that book.

821
00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:22.160
<v 1>Like I don't mind,
you know,
unless I'm trying to get to a bar before it closes.</v>

822
00:47:22.161 --> 00:47:23.870
Those are only the Times that I bugged him,

823
00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:28.240
<v 4>you know,
bothers me that somebody wants picture.
It's,
it's way better.</v>

824
00:47:28.241 --> 00:47:30.340
If somebody wants a,
then nobody gives a fuck.

825
00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:34.000
But I'm also at a cool level of just being known.

826
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.430
I'm known enough that I could sell tickets on the road,

827
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:39.310
but like I can walk down the street,
nobody fucks with me.
Right.

828
00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.940
But those people that are at that other level,
you know what I mean,

829
00:47:43.941 --> 00:47:47.990
where they can't leave the fucking house,
you know,
if you hang out with them,

830
00:47:47.991 --> 00:47:50.960
you don't go blabbing about it on a podcast.
It's a,

831
00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:53.950
it's to put it bluntly,

832
00:47:53.951 --> 00:47:56.500
it's really fucking tacky and it's not professional.

833
00:47:56.770 --> 00:48:01.420
And not to mention you come off like a name drop and Cunt,
you know,

834
00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:03.670
I actually had somebody to do that to me one time.

835
00:48:03.671 --> 00:48:07.660
I fucking annoyed the shit on me.
You know,
somebody,
uh,

836
00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:10.840
I was having this debate with somebody and then he ended up fucking writing

837
00:48:10.841 --> 00:48:12.820
something about it afterwards.
It was just like,
oh you know,

838
00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:16.690
I thought we were just a couple of comics hanging out.
You know,
I was just like,

839
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:19.790
just,
I dunno,

840
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000
I just gross is all I thought like that was fucking gross.

841
00:48:25.361 --> 00:48:26.420
Cause now I thought that,
you know,

842
00:48:26.421 --> 00:48:29.360
we actually would talk at human being to human being and now you're trying to

843
00:48:29.361 --> 00:48:33.620
get,
turn it into something,
you know,
I dunno.

844
00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:38.540
It's gross.
That's why I don't do it.
Alright.
Um,
alright.

845
00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:42.440
Wedding song.
Dear Billy Cock ring bearer.

846
00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:47.670
<v 1>Oh Jesus.
He's a,</v>

847
00:48:47.671 --> 00:48:52.671
I'm getting married this summer and my fiance and I are trying to figure out

848
00:48:53.361 --> 00:48:56.630
songs for the wedding.
You did music,

849
00:48:56.990 --> 00:49:01.910

Mia.
It's Neil with an n like Nancy,

850
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:05.720
the lovely Nia suggest for our entrance and first dance.

851
00:49:05.721 --> 00:49:07.280
We appreciate your insight.

852
00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:08.720
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

853
00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:09.560
<v 4>Oh my God.</v>

854
00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:14.830
I can't write at the person just wrote Jesus Christ easy with the homophobia.

855
00:49:15.051 --> 00:49:17.440
There said go fuck yourself.
Um,

856
00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:20.500
<v 5>okay.</v>

857
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:24.400
<v 4>I I don't fuck dude,
I listened to hair metal man.
You don't have to listen to me.</v>

858
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:28.750
I don't know.
Something from great white.
I'm a white lion.

859
00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.830
Um,
one of those white bands.
It was,

860
00:49:32.831 --> 00:49:36.160
it was Whitesnake white lion and great white.

861
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:41.410
Uh,
that's like when they had all the number of bands right.
Mary,

862
00:49:41.411 --> 00:49:44.950
three and four,
three 11,
sum 41.

863
00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:50.920
Um,
I don't know what the fuck they all right.
What song should you come up?

864
00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:55.270
I would think the song that both of you guys like,
I have no idea.

865
00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.770
Uh,
your wedding starts.

866
00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:00.070
<v 5>Okay.</v>

867
00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:03.820
<v 4>All right.
You coming in?
I Dunno.</v>

868
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:07.000
I'd say some from Lou Rawls,
lady love,

869
00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:11.680
although he's kind of suggesting an open relationship a little bit if you really

870
00:50:11.681 --> 00:50:12.514
listen to it.

871
00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:13.730
<v 5>Okay.</v>

872
00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:17.240
<v 4>Um,
anyways,
I don't fucking know.
That's a weird one.
I have no idea.</v>

873
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:22.610
I don't know what kind of music you're into.
How about something from Cinderella?

874
00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:28.050
Speaking of which,
um,
from my generation,
um,
I just found out

875
00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:32.330
<v 3>the drummer from mega death died last night.
Um,</v>

876
00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:38.830
was it Nick Menza
that his name?
Yeah,

877
00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:40.310
<v 4>x Megadeath drummer.</v>

878
00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:45.330
Nick Menza collapses and dies on stage 50 fucking years old.

879
00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:46.533
That's it.

880
00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.273
<v 3>MMM.</v>

881
00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:52.400
<v 4>Was like three songs and he was at that place,
the big potato,</v>

882
00:50:52.401 --> 00:50:56.330
which I have never been to.
Um,
it's a legendary music venue.
Like,

883
00:50:56.331 --> 00:51:00.020
if you ever come out to La and you want to go to a cool music venue and possibly

884
00:51:00.021 --> 00:51:01.970
see some huge fucking musician,

885
00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:06.560
just basically Jammin with a bunch of people from other bands or studio

886
00:51:06.561 --> 00:51:09.620
musicians,
that's the place to go to.
I've never been,

887
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:14.540
I don't know why I just always end up being busy having to do a standup show.

888
00:51:14.541 --> 00:51:18.770
But um,
fortunately he uh,
he died,
uh,
51,

889
00:51:18.771 --> 00:51:20.900
you're going to be 52 years old,
which is a

890
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:22.190
<v 3>okay</v>

891
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:25.350
<v 4>is way too young and general.
But when you're going to be 48,</v>

892
00:51:25.351 --> 00:51:27.090
next month is pretty fucking scary.

893
00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:30.390
Lay off the fucking chicken case of ds.

894
00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:31.443
<v 3>MMM.</v>

895
00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:36.920
<v 4>All right.
Here we got French music recommendation.
Hey,
Guiana,
label rouge.</v>

896
00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:37.430
Uh,

897
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:41.270
I know you're working on your French skills and you're always looking for music.

898
00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:45.770
So I thought I'd give you a to a twofer.
Checkout an artist's name.

899
00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:50.630
Strong mayor.
That's how you say it.
Strong mayor.

900
00:51:52.410 --> 00:51:57.330
<v 1>No,
God,
I'm an idiot.
Oh my God.</v>

901
00:51:57.331 --> 00:52:00.990
I'm a fucking idiot.
It's Straw may and then it was dash.

902
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:01.940
<v 4>You're welcome.</v>

903
00:52:01.941 --> 00:52:06.110
I thought the your was part of it and there was strong mayor,

904
00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:10.790
but it still may.
You're welcome.
Oh my God,
what a fucking dope.

905
00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:15.960
<v 1>Uh,
every time I think I find the bottom of my stupidity,</v>

906
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.570
there's a whole nother floor.
Anyways,

907
00:52:18.571 --> 00:52:22.530
he's from Belgium and his stuff has a really diverse set of influence,

908
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.530
influences.
But besides that,
the music is amazing.

909
00:52:25.531 --> 00:52:27.870
Even if you have no idea what the fuck he saying.

910
00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:32.370
I'm not a native French speaker.
Wait,
he's from Belgium,
but he sings in French.

911
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:35.770
Anyways,
he goes,
well,
my family spent some time in Belgium.
What does,

912
00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:36.640
when I was a kid,

913
00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.910
I forgotten a lot of my French over the years and listening to this as bringing

914
00:52:39.911 --> 00:52:40.780
it all back to me.

915
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.983
<v 3>Uh,</v>

916
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:49.400
<v 4>it says boom,
bone chance canard.
It's double.</v>

917
00:52:49.401 --> 00:52:53.240
And I know Cannard is duck.
So C,
O,
n,
n.
A.
R.
D.
I don't know what that is.

918
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:55.100
<v 3>Is it?</v>

919
00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:59.190
<v 1>Probably,
it says good luck.
Fuck face.
I have no dick or something.
I Dunno.</v>

920
00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:02.690
Come back to New York City.
So that makes no sense to me.

921
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.480
<v 4>We're in Belgium and you learned how to speak.
Speak French.</v>

922
00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:10.550
I thought you'd be able to talk to John Claude van down the muscles from

923
00:53:10.551 --> 00:53:14.940
Brussels.
Right.
All right girl.
Wow.
This guy tried to write,

924
00:53:14.941 --> 00:53:17.940
girl is fucking with my head and she's so fucking with his head.

925
00:53:18.210 --> 00:53:23.210
He wrote girl girls if fucking with my head dear Billy batts.

926
00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:26.680
Um,
a few months ago

927
00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:28.990
<v 1>my waitress at a Mexican restaurant</v>

928
00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:33.500
caught my eye with her cute smile and warm personality.

929
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:36.860
I asked her out and things are going great.
After two dates,

930
00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:40.580
we were having sex and I love spending time with her and making her laugh.

931
00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:45.170
She's also joined the air force and she used to ask me advice because I'm in the

932
00:53:45.171 --> 00:53:46.130
marine reserves.

933
00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:50.570
I didn't see her during her final week and late on Saturday during my drill

934
00:53:50.571 --> 00:53:51.051
weekend.

935
00:53:51.051 --> 00:53:55.670
She was texting that she was a terrible person and she was never going to amount

936
00:53:55.671 --> 00:53:59.990
to anything.
It sounds like she fucked around with it on you.
I'm sorry.

937
00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:01.610
That's just my paranoia.

938
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:06.170
I consoled her and she sent a two page text while I was asleep.

939
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:07.490
<v 5>Okay.</v>

940
00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:12.020
<v 1>At 6:00 AM the next morning I woke up to the text that read this has been eating</v>

941
00:54:12.021 --> 00:54:16.400
away at me and I had a few glasses of wine and can't hold it in.
Uh,

942
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:17.660
Eric comes on Wednesday.

943
00:54:17.661 --> 00:54:22.661
I had lunch with my old friend with benefits and I ended up blowing him.

944
00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:28.280
I'm so sorry.
I like you so much and I feel horrible the next day.

945
00:54:28.281 --> 00:54:31.580
I asked a few details about the incidents.

946
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:33.893
<v 3>Well,</v>

947
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:38.860
<v 1>we are using your hand to crank and the chef.
Um,</v>

948
00:54:38.861 --> 00:54:42.070
I asked a few questions about the incident and

949
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:46.750
said she had a strange way of showing affection towards me.

950
00:54:46.751 --> 00:54:51.400
I told her I didn't want to see her anymore and deleted all of her contact into

951
00:54:51.401 --> 00:54:54.730
my info from my phone and blocked her number.
Perfect.

952
00:54:55.810 --> 00:55:00.420
Am I being too hard?
Is it really so hard to not suck a dick?

953
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:01.750
I've never had the urge.

954
00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:06.790
She even told me not to cheat on her and then does this.

955
00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:10.150
I probably should've seen it coming because apparently she'd also had a

956
00:55:10.151 --> 00:55:13.510
threesome with two guys.
She seems so nice though.

957
00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:17.560
This is the first time I've been cheated on in his fucking with my head.
I'm 23.

958
00:55:17.561 --> 00:55:21.730
They shouldn't be that big of a deal,
but my confidence took a serious blow here.

959
00:55:21.731 --> 00:55:23.200
No Pun intended.
Uh,

960
00:55:24.310 --> 00:55:24.990
<v 5>okay.</v>

961
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:25.823
<v 4>Hey Dude.
You know.</v>

962
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:27.400
<v 5>Okay.</v>

963
00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:31.950
<v 1>That,
that happened to me at least three times in my life that I'm aware of women</v>

964
00:55:31.951 --> 00:55:36.450
fucking sheet too.
All right.
I mean everybody knows that guys are dogs.

965
00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:37.200
Okay.

966
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:41.370
<v 4>But women do it.
Fuck it too.
All right.
And um,
how many fucking,</v>

967
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:42.780
I didn't want to get it.
It's just

968
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:44.503
<v 3>nope.</v>

969
00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:47.930
<v 4>The only reason right now where you're questioning,
am I being so hard on it?</v>

970
00:55:47.931 --> 00:55:50.540
That's just your feelings talking because you miss her.
But Dude,

971
00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:53.440
you did the right thing.
You deleted or shit,
you're told to fuck off.

972
00:55:53.441 --> 00:55:58.430
It's a big time,
self esteem move and uh,
you're only 23 years old.

973
00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:02.030
You got a bunch of great women in your future.
Um,

974
00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:05.720
I'm not saying fuck her as far as her as a person,

975
00:56:05.721 --> 00:56:09.290
but just forget her as far as like someone that you can have a relationship
with,

976
00:56:09.291 --> 00:56:11.690
but you know,
she's obviously working out some stuff

977
00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:17.320
<v 1>and uh,
you know,
she,
you know,</v>

978
00:56:17.890 --> 00:56:22.870
she's on her path are on your path and a,
you're not looking for that.
Sounds like

979
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:24.703
<v 5>okay.</v>

980
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:28.680
<v 1>Yeah.
He just just move on.
You did the right fucking thing.
You know,</v>

981
00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:33.800
allow yourself to be sad and go through the shit and all that,
you know,

982
00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.900
don't do the dumb guy thing where you just try to shut off your feelings,

983
00:56:36.901 --> 00:56:40.560
go through the failings,
fucking cry it out of you when no one's around.

984
00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:44.250
Don't make it awkward for other fucking people.
And then,
uh,

985
00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:49.260
you know,
just don't fuck with anybody for awhile,
you know,

986
00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:53.550
figuring out what the fuck you want to do next,
but don't go back to her.

987
00:56:53.551 --> 00:56:58.420
You can't go back to her.
Um,
yeah,
I wouldn't do that.

988
00:56:58.421 --> 00:57:00.070
Plus,
you know,
she's joining the fucking air force.

989
00:57:00.071 --> 00:57:02.710
You're going to marines anyways.
You know,

990
00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:06.390
you can't tell me that as you go,

991
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.960
you're going to probably go around the fucking world.

992
00:57:07.961 --> 00:57:09.370
You're going to meet all kinds of beautiful women.

993
00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:11.470
She actually made it a long way.
She probably did you a favor.

994
00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:15.130
And I'll tell you right now that is as positive as I can spin that,

995
00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:20.080
cause I know that it sucks.
It sucks.
You know,
what are you going to do?

996
00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:24.460
All right.
Um,
something I wanted,

997
00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:28.150
where the hell was it as before I wrap this up here?
Uh,

998
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:31.930
people keep asking me about the,
uh,
the European tour.
And here's the thing.

999
00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:37.090
I am not allowed to say what the dates are.
It's definitely happening,

1000
00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:40.090
but I can be vague about it at this point.

1001
00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:41.410
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1002
00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:43.600
<v 1>I heard a rumor that it might start</v>

1003
00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:49.000
the end of July,
like the very end of July,

1004
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:51.280
like maybe the last day of July.

1005
00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:56.930
And I heard that it might go through,
I dunno,

1006
00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:01.360
mid August,
like mo actually,

1007
00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:05.710
August 8th,
maybe to the 10th.
It all fucking depends.

1008
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:07.223
All right.

1009
00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:13.310
And the rumor is that it might start in a city that in country that rhymes with

1010
00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:16.250
mumbling Firelands.

1011
00:58:18.070 --> 00:58:18.780
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1012
00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:23.150
<v 1>And then it might go to city
that rhymes with</v>

1013
00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:29.590
hell cast.
Oh.
And then there's another one,

1014
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:34.000
a hallway Meyerland.

1015
00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:35.320
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1016
00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:40.120
<v 1>I'm not allowed to release any of this information.
Then I might go to pistol.</v>

1017
00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:46.140
Uh,
England
can fester.

1018
00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:47.423
England,

1019
00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:52.670
Munden England Hamster Hamster Cam.

1020
00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:54.030
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1021
00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:58.290
<v 1>Federal offense.
It,
uh,
uh,</v>

1022
00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:02.470
what the fuck kind of routing is that?
Then I go up to Edinburgh.

1023
00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:07.100
Uh,
Hartland
possibly

1024
00:59:08.850 --> 00:59:13.590
that might,
that might be it.
I'm not allowed to say,
but,
uh,

1025
00:59:13.830 --> 00:59:15.300
I don't know when we're going to do this thing,

1026
00:59:15.330 --> 00:59:19.080
but I will tell you that I thought I was going to Belgium and as of right now,

1027
00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:22.040
if that's not on the list,
which is really bugging because

1028
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:25.790
<v 4>I really wanted to go there.
So I'm hoping that maybe I can,
uh,</v>

1029
00:59:26.550 --> 00:59:26.880
<v 0>okay.</v>

1030
00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:30.510
<v 4>We'll see.
I mean,
the amount of cities that we got offers from,</v>

1031
00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:32.010
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1032
00:59:32.010 --> 00:59:36.690
<v 4>If I'm still going to remain married,
uh,
I have to break it up into three.</v>

1033
00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:38.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1034
00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:40.440
<v 4>Three tours.
So I think I'm going to do</v>

1035
00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:46.460
this one and then maybe I'll do the Scandinavian one with Belgium on that one

1036
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:47.960
and then an eastern European one.

1037
00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:50.150
I don't know how long it's going to take me to do all of those,

1038
00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:55.450
but I definitely plan on doing them and I'm extremely excited about getting over

1039
00:59:55.611 --> 01:00:00.080
there.
There's a lot of cities there that I've never played too.
And um,

1040
01:00:01.410 --> 01:00:04.230
I dunno.
I,
I can't wait to get over that.
Plus,
you know,

1041
01:00:04.231 --> 01:00:05.430
it's going to be great for me.

1042
01:00:05.431 --> 01:00:08.640
It's going to feel like a summer vacation because we'll be done writing all 10

1043
01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:12.780
episodes ofF is for family.
So anyways,
that's um,

1044
01:00:13.050 --> 01:00:16.020
that is the podcast for this week.
Uh,
once again,

1045
01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:18.930
thank you to everybody came out in Calgary,
Edmonton and Seattle tonight.

1046
01:00:18.931 --> 01:00:23.070
This has been a great three day run,
and I'm arguing,

1047
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:26.880
I've got to tell you,
Seattle,
in all these areas up here,

1048
01:00:26.881 --> 01:00:28.950
once you live out a fucking desert,
man,
it's just,

1049
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.590
I always looked down as the planes landing going,

1050
01:00:31.591 --> 01:00:33.900
what if I lived in that house right fucking there?

1051
01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:35.133
<v 0>You know,</v>

1052
01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:40.130
<v 4>somehow I was able to fucking exist in show business and not live out in la,</v>

1053
01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.920
which I eventually,
maybe we'll be able to do,
but then what am I gonna do?

1054
01:00:42.921 --> 01:00:43.850
I gotta be in the writer's room.

1055
01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:45.923
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1056
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:48.520
<v 4>Eventually I'll be that guy.
I'm going to be that guy.
Eventually.</v>

1057
01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:51.430
I'm going to be living next to a fucking lake in the middle of nowhere.

1058
01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:53.163
<v 0>And,
uh,</v>

1059
01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:57.090
<v 4>staring at a wall,
drinking myself to death.
All right.
That's it everybody.</v>

1060
01:00:57.450 --> 01:01:01.140
That's the podcasts.
I'm going to watch the,
uh,
the blues game.
Um,

1061
01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:06.600
we'll see what happens here and,
uh,
go fuck yourself.
And I will check in on,

1062
01:01:06.601 --> 01:01:09.430
yeah,
on a Thursday.
All right.
See you.
