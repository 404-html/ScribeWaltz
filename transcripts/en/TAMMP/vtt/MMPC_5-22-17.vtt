1
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.070
Okay.

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.390
<v 1>What's going on?
It's bill burn.</v>

3
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.150
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday.
Fucking,
uh,

4
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.630
May 22nd.
Is that a record for how quickly I said the f word?
Uh,

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.440
I'm actually doing the podcast right now,
riding in a car.

6
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.370
I'm not driving.
I'm on my way to New York City,

7
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:24.850
cause I have to do some emotional stuff here for a second.

8
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.790
If it's for family that's coming out I this week,
right?
Or next week,
May 30th,

9
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:33.450
I don't know what,
so this begins,
oh,
Billy red face,
uh,

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.200
shown his freckled puts on anything I can get myself on.

11
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.930
Um,
you know,
so whatever.
I'm driving to New York and you know something,

12
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:47.550
there's all this fucking traffic and I got to take an early flight tomorrow back

13
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:48.840
to La.
I don't have time.

14
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:52.730
And my wife just sent me this whole thing on what successful people do and they,

15
00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:57.420
they,
they fucking,
you know,
they,
uh,
I don't know what they do.
They,

16
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.760
they,
they know how many minutes are in a day.

17
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.560
Evidently there's 1,440 minutes in a day and they use this wisely and they

18
00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:08.610
delegate,
right?
They delegate shit.
Like,
I don't want to do that.

19
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.170
You know how to do that.
Right.
All right,
I'll pay you to do that.
You know,

20
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.650
a small portion of what the fuck I'm making.
I got to get better at that.

21
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.620
In order to delegate though what you have to be,
she have to be social and uh,

22
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.800
you know,
that's not my thing.
And I said I had a couple of drinks.

23
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.450
Other than that,
I'm kind of a curmudgeon.
I don't know if you've noticed.

24
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.890
I'm a little bit grumpy,

25
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.580
but a fucking cruise it now with all the traffic of now watching,

26
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.360
this will be like a Thursday when I was going to get to do the whole hour.
Um,

27
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.070
so anyways,
I just got back from
my tour up there in Canada,

28
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.670
work with Nate Kraig who murdered it.
If you don't believe me,

29
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.500
ask anybody who was in Winnipeg,

30
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.450
Saskatoon and uh,
Regina.

31
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.760
And,
uh,
first of all,

32
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:03.761
I'm very proud that Nate and I did a show two shows in Regina and neither one of

33
00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:08.390
us went with the easy joke.
No,
we did the stupid,
it rhymes with fun.

34
00:02:08.391 --> 00:02:10.970
Nobody's like vagina,
Vagina.
What's up with that?

35
00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:15.330
I thought there was going to be a giant Twat here.
Sinkhole flash thing.
We uh,

36
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.100
kind of left it alone and um,
I don't know.
We had a great time for it.

37
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.710
Let's,
let's just back it up here.
Okay.

38
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.770
We start off in Winnipeg and I told the people that Winnipeg,

39
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.040
that I wasn't going to tell people this,

40
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:31.340
but I just think they're so off the beaten path.
It's fine.

41
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.020
The cuisine in Winnipeg,
it's fucking insane.

42
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.430
All right.
Jesus.
What's the,
what's the name of that place?
We actually,

43
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:43.090
I didn't have time to go this time.
I,
uh,

44
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.130
ordered from this place.

45
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:51.131
The peasants something or other was my little list of places to go scrolling

46
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:53.000
down.
So when a peg,

47
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.330
<v 0>yeah,</v>

48
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.710
<v 1>but those can be a bunch of traffic.</v>

49
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.100
<v 0>He's just blocking</v>

50
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.840
<v 2>me up.
The driver.
Yeah.
Alright.
Peasant Kitchen.
Get to torchy air,
if you've ever,</v>

51
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:09.730
they had t,
O,
r,
t,
I e r e gets French,
pork pie.
And uh,

52
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:14.050
then we went to the tallest poppy for breakfast the next day.
And um,

53
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.360
I wouldn't have known about either one of those.

54
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.100
Shout out to a Canadian by the name of Ed Robertson.

55
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:23.890
You might've heard of him plays in a band.

56
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.260
I think he's in a garage band or something like that.
You might've heard of him.

57
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:30.820
I don't know.
I'm just fucking with you.
Um,
so anyways,
uh,
the food,

58
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.390
<v 3>it was unbelievable up there.
And uh,</v>

59
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.240
the shows were awesome.

60
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.940
Played in this old theater and I forget the name of,
I don't remember.

61
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.670
It's been around since like 1900 and up top.

62
00:03:44.671 --> 00:03:49.200
They have like the same old shitty seats they used to have back when everything

63
00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:50.310
was segregated,
you know,

64
00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:53.370
and all the white people were downstairs in anybody else had to walk all the

65
00:03:53.371 --> 00:03:56.520
flights of stairs to go upstairs,
you know?
And what's the result?

66
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.250
What's the result have 50 years later,

67
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.830
why people are getting their asses kicked in sports.

68
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.650
You know why we got no quads,
we don't have any glutes.

69
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.960
It's why our acids is so flat.

70
00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:09.720
We just used to walk into the theater where you're on the ground level and

71
00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:12.000
everybody else had to walk up.
Right.

72
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.930
It's why we get our asses kicked from the grid iron to the Dojo stroke.

73
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.500
It all comes back to going to see Harry Houdini and not having to work for it.

74
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.053
Um,

75
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.860
so we were actually there and it wasn't cold as shit like last time.

76
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.480
And uh,
you know,
try out some new stuff.
Everything was going great.

77
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.950
Um,
went to bed the first night,
didn't have a drop of booze.

78
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.940
How about that?
Huh?
Didn't smoke a cigar even though there was Cuban cigars,

79
00:04:38.941 --> 00:04:43.230
but you know,
it's Canada,
so they got Cuban cigars,
but there's no place to smoke.

80
00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:44.640
Uh,
they're very,
uh,

81
00:04:44.641 --> 00:04:49.500
they're very hostile against smokers or they just maybe like over the
protective,

82
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.240
they sorta helicopter parent with smokers up there in the,
you're sort of,

83
00:04:54.241 --> 00:04:56.500
I guess,
allowed to do it outside.
Although I did not,

84
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.370
I didn't think I really saw anybody smoking anywhere.
Uh,

85
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.060
so anyways,
we did that Gig and um,

86
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.630
the next one on the docket was we drove up to SAS Saskatoon.
Oh,

87
00:05:10.631 --> 00:05:13.740
speaking of which,
there was these two or three concept,
the Winnipeg show.

88
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.030
I thought they were booing me,
but they were just going to,

89
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.830
I don't know why we were in Winnipeg.

90
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.330
I guess that's short for Saskatoon for like Cleveland,

91
00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:27.810
the land up there,
I guess they call it the tune or they just yell out tune.

92
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.530
I have no fucking idea.
But we,
uh,
I thought they were boring me.

93
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.130
So you know,
I got off stage and I was just like,
Jesus Christ,
man.

94
00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:40.110
I thought that was a good show,
you know?
Uh,
but I,
he's like,
no,
no,

95
00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:42.600
no.
They were yelling tune and like,
what's too,

96
00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:46.740
and they was four for Saskatoon as like,
all right,
we're in Winnipeg.

97
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.860
They're like,
Oh yes,
sorry,
sorry.
It's a big thing in Canada.
Everybody,
sorry,

98
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.470
I'm so sorry.
Like this waitress was clear in our table then,
you know,

99
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.040
plate is empty.
And when she goes to clear what she goes,
oh,
sorry,
sorry.

100
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.120
It's like you're apologizing for,
do you brought food domain?

101
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.940
Now you're taking it away and you're apologizing all the time.
Sorry.

102
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.730
I'm sorry.
Get the puck out.
Sorry.
Um,
so anyways,

103
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:18.470
we did the drive up from,
uh,

104
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.480
from wedding peg to Saskatoon,
the one that everybody was saying,
hey,

105
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:27.540
getting ready at the hills and stuff.
Jesus,
that's not pleasant is it?

106
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.250
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
I picked it up.

107
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.470
I'm going to be ridiculously pleasant on this,
you know,
fuck those cons.

108
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.690
Who yelled at tune in?
Winnepeg sorry.

109
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.513
<v 4>MMM.</v>

110
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.940
<v 3>So it was,
everyone was saying I was going to be dreading that drive,
you know,</v>

111
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:46.520
like an eight hour drive.
And uh,
so we start,

112
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.940
me and Nate started driving up and we're just hitting all these bugs and shit.

113
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:53.750
But I gotta tell you,
man,
it was beautiful and,
uh,

114
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.510
both love the drive,
you know,

115
00:06:56.511 --> 00:07:00.470
we live in La were just smashed in with a zillion other people.

116
00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:05.060
It's nice to get out there.
What a beautiful country.
Canada is.
Good Lord.

117
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.420
Um,
all these,
these farmhouses,

118
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.620
all of this land.
It was beautiful.
No,
I just kept thinking it was,

119
00:07:14.621 --> 00:07:18.710
I would love to fly a helicopter out here cause if he had a problem he could

120
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:21.890
land it anywhere as opposed to when I'm in la I'm looking for fucking soccer

121
00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:23.990
fields and playgrounds and opened his not kids there.

122
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.610
If I ever had a problem and I'm just stuck,

123
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:33.611
there was just like just wide open spaces and I wasn't that bad a drive.

124
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:34.880
We didn't like seven hours.

125
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.090
We took the one lane highway instead of the two lane highway.

126
00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:42.200
So we had a lot of fun like peeking around trucks and shit trying to pass them a

127
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.800
lot of farmers like driving these giant tractors down the fucking street,

128
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.880
<v 4>you know.
Um,</v>

129
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.050
<v 3>I dunno,
I,
I got a bunch of pictures of shit that I saw every,</v>

130
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:56.310
like every mile there were though,

131
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.910
there was a barn that looked like it was going to fall down and there'd be some

132
00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:01.190
guy who just had like a zillion fucking cars

133
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.280
or tires or something all piled up in his yard.
It was really a,

134
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.250
it was pretty interesting.
And I was just thinking those guys from gas monkey,

135
00:08:10.251 --> 00:08:14.780
you know,
if they ever pull all the fucking cars out of barns down in the states,

136
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:18.950
they could just go up to Manitoba and Saskatchewan.
They'd find,
I saw a number,

137
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:23.130
I saw a 65,
uh,
I'm driving like 70 miles an hour or two and I still saw it.

138
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.710
So 65 Ford Galaxy,
I don't know if it was the 500 might,
might've been,

139
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.920
I think it was a 64,
actually,
64.
I know.

140
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.970
I sound like the fucking rain man and I didn't right now.
So anyways,

141
00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:39.470
and then we get up to fucking Saskatchewan,
Saskatoon.
And uh,

142
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:40.790
we only had one show that night.

143
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:44.330
So of course I went out and got absolutely fucking hammered,

144
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.970
hammered at this bar,
a lot of tattoos by tattoos up in Saskatoon.

145
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:51.790
Lot of tattoos,
sorry.

146
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.083
<v 4>MMM.</v>

147
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:58.230
<v 3>But it was a town and had this amazing park and um,</v>

148
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.760
which I forget the fucking name of,
and I got up the next day cause I,

149
00:09:01.761 --> 00:09:04.950
and I show him all those years of have a paper route.
Like,

150
00:09:04.951 --> 00:09:07.740
I can only sleep for so fucking long.
I just sort of naturally wake up.

151
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:09.630
So you know,
I didn't get to bed till like two in the morning.

152
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:12.840
I still woke up at like eight 30 and I was staying at that.

153
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.630
They're fucking a red rum hotel there.

154
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.590
It's this beautiful old hotel that looks like you could have shot the shining in

155
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:24.480
there and uh,
it's right next to this long park and it just was watching.

156
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:30.330
It gets a little mini waterfall.
They watch these pelicans trying to fish.

157
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.770
I saw some geese for some baby geese walking around was crazy.

158
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.740
Through all these years of living in New York and La,

159
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:40.290
I was just sitting there geeking out and there was some old lady standing there

160
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:43.380
looking at the goose,
that goose,
it's like putting his fucking head down,

161
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.440
looking at her and I'm thinking that's like an aggressive posture.

162
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.240
So I s I walked away,
but I was also looking sort of laughing,

163
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.790
like thinking that goose was going to fuck the old lady up and then thinking

164
00:09:53.791 --> 00:09:56.700
like,
what would I do?
Because that would be bad.
I mean,

165
00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:58.020
I can't walk away from the Old Lady,

166
00:09:58.021 --> 00:10:00.660
but I also don't want to slap the shit out of this goose in front of all of its

167
00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:05.150
children.
So,
uh,
sort of a tense little moment there out in nature.
And now,

168
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:09.570
fortunately,
cooler heads prevailed and everybody went their separate ways.

169
00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:13.560
But the,
I don't think old lady knew how close she came.
You know,

170
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.800
she had a big grin on her face as the thing was like ducking down low.

171
00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:21.450
So she's kind of ducking down,
like imitating it.
Um,
you know,

172
00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:23.850
like she's looking at a gorilla and she's pounding a chest and I thought for

173
00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:25.950
half a second that guy was going to see some like,
you know,

174
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.260
some fucking old lady bird MMA action,
you know?

175
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.270
Um,
but you know what?
She's so fucking older,
but she knows how to kill a goose.

176
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.060
It's probably went out in the backyard and I can do that shit.

177
00:10:39.061 --> 00:10:42.960
They just walk up and they grab it by the neck and then they do the spin move

178
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:47.100
and then they just hold on to the next of the body spins and it just breaks the

179
00:10:47.101 --> 00:10:49.110
fucking things and neck.
Um,

180
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.920
she looked like she was old enough that she actually lived during those times,

181
00:10:52.921 --> 00:10:55.950
you know,
back when you earned your meal,
you know,

182
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.230
like you knew the name of the thing that you killed.
It was like a pet,
right?

183
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.330
And weird dreams and probably slipped into you'd fucking sexuality somehow.

184
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:13.380
You like dressing up like a bird when you fuck or something like that is some

185
00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:17.970
weird thing with anytime you get abused,
you know,
filing sexy,

186
00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:22.340
I don't know what it is,
it ends up making you some Weirdo in the wreck.
Um,

187
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:27.110
so anyways,
I ended up doing,
so I walked up,
I went over that hump,

188
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.800
that river there,
whatever the fuck it is,

189
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.450
like walking along these train tracks and I gotta be honest with you,

190
00:11:33.451 --> 00:11:36.390
I was a little nervous about that because it was this old kind of wooden bridge.

191
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:41.690
And I was just thinking,
uh,
every time someone would walk by me,
you know,

192
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.540
I always kind of made eye contact and like brace myself because I just was

193
00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:48.150
nervous that someone's just going to grab my legs and throw me over.

194
00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.810
Never seen a movie a long time ago with this guy did that.

195
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.910
He was a psycho and he went with these people.

196
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.300
They didn't realize he was a psycho.

197
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.120
I think he already killed people and then he went up there and uh,

198
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:01.660
he went to like take a picture of this woman,

199
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:05.860
this couple have somebody push both of them off the fucking cliff.
Um,

200
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:11.150
and it was so eerily done that I'm like,
this has to be based on a,

201
00:12:11.151 --> 00:12:14.330
on a true story.
Cause usually that's not good enough for Hollywood,

202
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:18.040
has to be some dramatic way.
They kill you rather than just some creepy real way.

203
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:23.230
Um,
so I was walking across that and that beautiful nature and everything.

204
00:12:23.231 --> 00:12:27.310
Then I was just,
you know,
worried someone's gonna just,

205
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.530
I dunno,

206
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.690
just grabbed me by my ankles and tossed me right over before I realized what it

207
00:12:31.691 --> 00:12:32.524
was going on.
You know,

208
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.430
typical shit had to be so busy trying to save my cell phone.

209
00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:38.160
I would even think about myself before I went over.

210
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.230
I think I could have landed in dog,
you know,
I don't think I was that high up.

211
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.840
<v 4>MMM.</v>

212
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:45.981
<v 3>What does that say about me then?</v>

213
00:12:45.981 --> 00:12:47.400
I'm going through nature and I'm thinking birds.

214
00:12:47.401 --> 00:12:49.460
They're going to tack old ladies or somebody's gonna throw me off a bit.

215
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:51.703
<v 4>Uh,</v>

216
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.230
<v 3>maybe we just don't fully conscious cause I know the fucking driver's listened</v>

217
00:12:56.231 --> 00:13:00.310
to here.
Um,
anyways,
plowing ahead here.
Uh,

218
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.540
and we did the drive down to Regina and I don't know,
I don't really have any,

219
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:07.130
we went to some fucking bar.
Well,

220
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.160
I don't even know where the hell I was drinking.

221
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.670
That's the same place I had lunch and I fucking went into when I was in

222
00:13:12.671 --> 00:13:16.960
Saskatoon,
it's right,
right out front from the,
uh,

223
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.350
from the red rum in that I was staying at.
And Oh my God,

224
00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:25.080
that place was a shit show.
And this is fucking hilarious.

225
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.510
We walked into the bar and the guy goes,
can I see your driver's license?
I go,

226
00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:32.350
yeah.
And then he goes to scan the thing and I like blocked it with my hand.
I go,

227
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.850
do,
don't scan my id,
we're going to go on.
You know,
it's just for us but me.

228
00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.890
What the fuck you mean?
Fuck Outta here.

229
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.110
He was scanned Nate stuff.
It's just like,

230
00:13:44.111 --> 00:13:47.680
I like just the liberties that people take with your Id.

231
00:13:47.681 --> 00:13:50.650
I don't let go of my id anymore.
Let me see your id and I just show,

232
00:13:50.651 --> 00:13:53.140
I hold onto when they go to take it as this,
should I go?
Just read it.

233
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:56.420
I don't give people my id.
You can look at it,
you can read it.

234
00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.110
<v 4>MMM.</v>

235
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.290
<v 3>You know,
I check into hotels.</v>

236
00:14:00.291 --> 00:14:05.000
They always go to grab it from me and I hold onto it
the whole,
sorry,

237
00:14:05.001 --> 00:14:09.950
sorry.
Can I say it?
I go,
I don't want you to type any information
into your,
uh,

238
00:14:09.951 --> 00:14:13.910
you know,
oh,
we just do that.
So the next time you stay and now you don't,

239
00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.150
you take it and then you sell it and then someone else gets it.

240
00:14:17.151 --> 00:14:20.870
And then all my fucking shit's out there.
And next thing you know,
you know,

241
00:14:20.871 --> 00:14:25.610
I don't know what somebody defaults on a house and fucking Regina and the banks

242
00:14:25.611 --> 00:14:29.630
are coming after me.
I don't know why.
I just know it's not a good thing.
So,
um,

243
00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:34.280
we went in there,
oh my God,
those people were fucking party.
It was a,

244
00:14:34.281 --> 00:14:36.830
it was some sort of holiday weekend up there.
I don't know what it was for,

245
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.990
but a lot of tattoos,
lots of tattoos,

246
00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.520
a lot of sleeves,
Lotta fucking tattoos.
And uh,

247
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.560
I just kept drinking and drinking and drinking and I vaguely remember bringing a

248
00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:52.610
hockey stick over.

249
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:56.120
It was a Sherwood that blew my mind because I had not seen one of those since I

250
00:14:56.121 --> 00:15:00.890
was a kid,
you know,
and they did shots out of it.
And,
uh,

251
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.490
I don't really remember much after that.
I just spent it.

252
00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:11.990
I walked out by myself.
I do remember that,
I think.
Yes.

253
00:15:11.991 --> 00:15:14.480
And then the next day I woke up and I did the whole stupid watch.

254
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.220
And when I was done with the walk,
there was this little double decker bus

255
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.860
and I was starving.
I didn't know whether it was a good breakfast place.

256
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.860
I just said fuck it.

257
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.190
And I walked up to the double decker bus that they turn into this fucking little

258
00:15:28.191 --> 00:15:33.191
restaurant thing and I had a hot dog for breakfast at followed it up with a a

259
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.580
mint chocolate chip ice cream counter.

260
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.520
And I sat alone on a fucking park bench eating an ice cream cone at Saskatoon.

261
00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:50.360
Saskatchewan
hung over as shit.

262
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:55.130
It just laughing at myself,
like what kind of a fucking life on my living.

263
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.580
So as I'm sitting there,
this nice Canadian,
a

264
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.540
<v 1>couple pulls up,
right?
They bolt on bicycles,</v>

265
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.890
one of them is towing a kid and I just see the one guy,
you know,

266
00:16:05.891 --> 00:16:09.310
they're all like Flanders.
That's how nice they are up to.
And he just goes,

267
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:14.230
he pulls up and he's like,
oh no.
Oh No.
And I'm like,

268
00:16:14.231 --> 00:16:16.630
what's he looking at?
And I turned around and I looked back the,
you know,

269
00:16:16.631 --> 00:16:21.370
the little bus thing that they had the hot dogs in the ice cream and like 40

270
00:16:21.371 --> 00:16:24.910
children's jet just showed up,
brought up by like the teachers or something.

271
00:16:24.911 --> 00:16:27.160
It's like they were going to be out of ice cream and hot dogs by the time these

272
00:16:27.161 --> 00:16:29.320
people loader.
It was fucking hilarious.

273
00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:34.190
I beat the rush just by like 30 seconds,
but like they were just all know.

274
00:16:34.191 --> 00:16:38.890
Oh Geez.
Well I guess we got here at the wrong time.
No,
no,
no.
Sorry.
Sorry.

275
00:16:38.891 --> 00:16:42.220
It's okay.
It's all going to keep you eat everything.
I don't need nourishment.

276
00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.010
They were like even apologetic like dead.
It was so

277
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:51.660
I always forget how loud and obnoxious I am and my fellow Americans are until I

278
00:16:52.031 --> 00:16:55.750
go to like other countries,
like I don't want to be the guys shit,
not Americans,

279
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.620
because I was up there and they just kept talking about how nice the people are

280
00:16:59.621 --> 00:17:02.500
up there and I was like,
dude,
fuck these people.
They,
they've riot when they,

281
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:07.030
when they lose,
you know,
a playoff series.

282
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.810
Okay.
They just as racist.
It just as fucked up,
blah,
blah.

283
00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.460
By the time we got to Regina,
I was like,
all right.
You know what?

284
00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:17.620
These are really nice people.
I'll give it to you.
I'll give it to you.
All right.

285
00:17:17.621 --> 00:17:18.340
I'm stubborn.

286
00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.700
I don't want to be yet another person that travels to another country and then

287
00:17:21.701 --> 00:17:24.700
it comes back here to tell everybody how everything in this country is wrong.

288
00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.570
You should see how they make a grilled cheese sandwich up there.
I mean,

289
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.250
it's just so good.
Like everything's like fucking better.
It's like really?

290
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.040
Is that why everybody's always paying attention to us?
You know,

291
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.460
if we stink so bad,

292
00:17:39.461 --> 00:17:43.630
how come you know the name of our president and we don't know the name of your

293
00:17:43.631 --> 00:17:47.350
president.
I want you to think about that one for a second.
G I don't know bill,

294
00:17:47.351 --> 00:17:49.650
cause you guys dropped bombs on us.
All right,
fair enough.

295
00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:01.300
All right,
17 minutes.
This is like the fucking old days
right now.

296
00:18:01.301 --> 00:18:03.760
If you'd like to know I'm going over the Manhattan bridge.

297
00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.950
<v 0>MMM.</v>

298
00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.720
<v 1>Looking at my old digs way back in the day up to street.</v>

299
00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.220
I used to live in Yorkville.

300
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.910
I think that's what it was called and it was rows of the depressing fucking

301
00:18:16.911 --> 00:18:19.640
Roosevelt Island Queensboro bridge.

302
00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:22.280
I walked across that they one time I was so sick of going to the gym.

303
00:18:22.281 --> 00:18:24.460
I was just like,
you know,
I ran down,
I didn't run from the,

304
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.990
and I fucking walked down,
walked over the bridge.

305
00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.140
And there's no way to walk on a bridge and not think about that Saturday night

306
00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.890
<v 3>fever,
the fucking idiot.
You know?</v>

307
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.990
<v 1>I love how he was too cowardly to get into that fight.</v>

308
00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:41.400
And then he's going to do a headstand on the Verrazano Bridge.
That's still,

309
00:18:41.401 --> 00:18:42.430
by the way,
that's the one in,

310
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.333
<v 3>Nah,</v>

311
00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.540
that goes from Brooklyn to a stat now and see if I still remember this.

312
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.020
It Goes Brooklyn Bridge,
Manhattan,
Williamsburg,
then Manhattan.

313
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.880
<v 1>Hey Sir.
Is this the,
uh,
Brooklyn,
I mean system Manhattan Know Williamsburg,</v>

314
00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:00.830
Williamsburg now,
sorry.
William Spark my fault.
So it goes Brooklyn,
Manhattan,

315
00:19:00.831 --> 00:19:03.990
Williamsburg Borough,

316
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.270
<v 3>and then I don't know what the fuck else is up there.</v>

317
00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:10.890
There's some sort of foot bridge
Triborough bridge or some shit.

318
00:19:10.891 --> 00:19:13.710
They probably renamed it,
you know,
at this point,

319
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:18.600
it's not the Jackie Robinson fucking bridge.
It's probably be named after some,

320
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.030
some lady,
you know,

321
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.890
I dunno what some lady you fucking showed a claim on a show and she was

322
00:19:28.141 --> 00:19:31.440
considered brave.
You know the Harry Twat,
every bridge snug they get.

323
00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:34.720
I don't do what?
Fucking vagina.
Joker,
Vagina.
Now I'm going to do it.
Had on a,

324
00:19:34.721 --> 00:19:39.540
on a bridge.
What's wrong with me?
Um,
so anyways,
oh my God.

325
00:19:39.541 --> 00:19:41.010
Alphabet city.
Yay.

326
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:46.200
Now it's like all Nice Tompkins Square Park.

327
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.360
All the memories are coming back.
You know,

328
00:19:48.361 --> 00:19:51.270
I've been gone from this city for so long that there's a lot of it that I don't

329
00:19:51.271 --> 00:19:52.350
even recognize it.
Like,

330
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.910
I mean obviously the empire state building and that type of Shit Times Square

331
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.751
and that type of thing,

332
00:19:57.751 --> 00:20:01.830
but it's like just a completely different from the city that I moved to.

333
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:07.050
Like Times Square was fucking scary when I moved here.

334
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.720
So we just drove by,

335
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.280
just drove by as it was driving like 30 miles an hour with the sunroof open with

336
00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.320
their cell phone out the top video tape.

337
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:27.910
<v 1>I guess I'm podcasting,
but I'm not driving right?
Or do you want to film it all?</v>

338
00:20:27.911 --> 00:20:31.850
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Sorry.
Um,
I'll edit it for you.

339
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.320
I won't charge you anything.
I'm Canadian.

340
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:35.343
<v 3>Um,</v>

341
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.560
how funny is it that they're that nice and then you get them out on the ice.

342
00:20:39.561 --> 00:20:43.790
That's when it all comes out.
Right.
Fucking crosschecking to the neck.

343
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.100
I was at Flanders,
gets his glasses off,

344
00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.210
puts on a kind of sweater and you better keep your fucking head up.

345
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.770
That's Canada,
right?

346
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.890
You please do a drawing of fucking Flanders as fuck

347
00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:58.383
<v 0>the fucking,</v>

348
00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.170
<v 3>I don't know,
the Thunderbay Lamas,
whatever,</v>

349
00:21:01.171 --> 00:21:06.110
whatever the name of your teams are up down the fucking
lower levels,

350
00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:10.920
the minor leagues,
whatever you call every fucking Canadians as say,
oh,

351
00:21:10.921 --> 00:21:14.840
I made it the thunder bay and the,
I didn't,
I wasn't good enough to get the NHL.

352
00:21:14.841 --> 00:21:16.550
So I tried to fight my way into the lake.

353
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:22.190
I know I'm doing a bad Canadian accent.
I apologize.
But uh,

354
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:23.223
<v 0>yeah.</v>

355
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.040
<v 3>Anyways,
what,
whatever.
To what I remember long time ago,</v>

356
00:21:26.041 --> 00:21:30.900
Jeff Ross hosted a comedy show live from Tompkins Square Park.

357
00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.700
And I remember thinking that was so fucking bad ass.

358
00:21:35.701 --> 00:21:38.880
Anybody that was performing there cause alphabet.

359
00:21:38.881 --> 00:21:40.680
See like before you even came here,

360
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.820
people were saying how scary that was in like Thompson Square was just like the

361
00:21:44.821 --> 00:21:46.500
city had just given into like,

362
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:53.170
I mean it was like as a subway going by fee or something.
Um,

363
00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.810
it was just like a tent city.
Like I walked by at one time and it was just like,

364
00:21:57.811 --> 00:22:01.380
uh,
just trying to mask the fear on my face plus,
you know,

365
00:22:01.381 --> 00:22:05.160
rubber neck and just wanted to see what it looked like.
And uh,

366
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:10.350
it was like junkies,
homeless people just fucking mentally ill people.

367
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:15.360
It was like,
it was like the beginning of a bad like hair metal video,

368
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.580
you know,
when they used to try to do those apocalypse once,

369
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:21.060
they were all basically loosely based on the escape from New York.

370
00:22:21.061 --> 00:22:24.090
People coming up on a man holes even what's his face did that Michael Jackson

371
00:22:24.091 --> 00:22:27.870
did.
It will look like it was like the thrill of video except uh,
you know,

372
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:30.503
it was real

373
00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.320
get away.
Um,
anyways,

374
00:22:37.321 --> 00:22:39.660
I'm going to read some advertising here at the risk of getting car sick.

375
00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:41.643
<v 0>MMM.</v>

376
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.980
<v 3>It was funny about having a kid.
Is your screen savers all become your kid.</v>

377
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.260
And every time you pick up your phone,
you just,
you know,

378
00:22:47.261 --> 00:22:49.840
you were around other adults and they have no idea.

379
00:22:49.841 --> 00:22:51.550
You're looking at your kid and you just go ball.

380
00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:58.210
Then you try to turn it into a cough.
Excuse me.
Cause he's a man.

381
00:22:58.211 --> 00:23:02.140
You're not allowed to show love.
Um,
all right,

382
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.950
content live reads.
Okay,
here we go.
Ah,

Look at this.

383
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:10.270
Live from the fucking Williamsburg Bridge.

384
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:15.820
It's old zip
recruiter.
It was driver's gonna.

385
00:23:15.821 --> 00:23:18.670
Think I'm nuts.
Uh,
are you hiring well,
are you,

386
00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:22.600
do you know where to post your job to find the best candidates?

387
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:25.300
Talk about the challenge of finding great talent and,

388
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:27.520
or the approach importance of finding great talent

389
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.040
to a successful business.
But I think people know that.
Yeah,
yeah,
you can't,

390
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.850
you guys didn't know.
You know,
when you're hiring people,

391
00:23:33.851 --> 00:23:36.190
you don't want to fucking moron that come in,

392
00:23:36.191 --> 00:23:39.820
especially if they're running the register,
you know,
or your new CEO,

393
00:23:39.821 --> 00:23:43.600
you don't want to dope.
You want the best person possible.
So be nice.

394

If you could,
you could pick from,

395
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.610
<v 2>you know,</v>

396
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.120
hundreds of thousands of people rather than whatever mouth breather answers your

397
00:23:50.121 --> 00:23:54.470

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.900
Is this a bra for the front of your car so you don't get rocks up on it?
Uh,

419
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:25.270
sooner or later your car will break down.
It's a fact.
Every car,

420
00:25:25.271 --> 00:25:27.850
truck and SUV owner knows if you're lucky.

421
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.070
It happens while still under the manufacturer.

422
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.710
Manufacturers warranty and the repairs are covered.

423
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:34.930
If it happens after the warranty expires,

424
00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.070
you could be out of pocket thousands to get it fixed.

425
00:25:39.071 --> 00:25:41.740
That's why getting extended coverage from car,

426
00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:44.350
she'll dot com is a good idea.

427
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:49.090
A new engine or new transmission could cost over $5,000.

428
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:53.530
Transmission doesn't cost $5,000.
All right?

429
00:25:53.531 --> 00:25:56.590
You can go on youtube to figure it out.
A fucking pull an engine.
You could do it.

430
00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.610
Uh,
even as simple repair to have sensor Cenk cost.

431
00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:03.310
Over a thousand dollars skip that hassle man.

432
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.770
Car Shield makes the whole process like dead Canadian hope cross processes.

433
00:26:07.771 --> 00:26:08.770
Sorry,
easy.

434
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:12.640
You select your favorite mechanic or you can even go to the dealership to do the

435
00:26:12.641 --> 00:26:13.474
work.
That's cool.

436
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:17.570
And there's no checks in the mail stuff or waiting for reimbursement car.

437
00:26:17.571 --> 00:26:19.240
She'll gets the mechanic paid directly.

438
00:26:19.241 --> 00:26:24.220
Car Shields administrators even give you VIP treatment providing 24 seven

439
00:26:24.221 --> 00:26:28.900
roadside assistance and a rental car while your yours is in the shop so you're

440
00:26:28.901 --> 00:26:33.100
not left stranded out in the cold or you guys could maintain the fucking
engines.

441
00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.980
It's fun.
The engine blocks made out of fucking steal salsa transmission.

442
00:26:38.981 --> 00:26:43.440
If you just keep it looped up.
I mean theoretically it gets last forever,

443
00:26:43.441 --> 00:26:46.500
but who knows?
Who's kidding,
who.
You're not going to fucking do that.
Are you?

444
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:50.130
So get cars,
shield.
If your car is three to 12 years old,

445
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:52.540
it doesn't mean you have to pay high repair bill.

446
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:57.510
Bill's car shield administrators have paid out close to 2 billion in claims and

447
00:26:57.511 --> 00:27:01.260
they're ready to help you.
Save yourself thousands and potential car repairs.

448
00:27:01.261 --> 00:27:05.580
Get covered by the ultimate and extended vehicle service protection before it's

man.
There's always some fucking thing there.

452
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.330
Extended warranties,
maybe they're the good guys.
All right.
Upside.

453
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.800
How many more of these goddamn things are there?
Two more.

454
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.680
Two more than I can start people watching like I used to do back in the Danes

455
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:34.350
shitting all over,
buddy.
All right.

456
00:27:34.351 --> 00:27:36.240
There's a better way for you to buy business travel.

457

It's called upside.com every time you buy a trip it upside.

458
00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:40.900
I'm just reading as fast so I get through it.

459
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:44.940
You'll save your company a ton of money and they give you Amazon,

468
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.950

you'd be crazy not to check out upside.com crazy.

470

498

gun and this is like the Old New York.

512
00:30:52.681 --> 00:30:57.681
Back in the day I used to do this fucking room called surf reality and uh,

513
00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:03.150
it was the beginning of the AllSeen and the level of talent.

514
00:31:03.151 --> 00:31:05.130
This was before you could start your career,

515
00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.750
start a privileged career in the fucking old rooms where there was like no

516
00:31:09.751 --> 00:31:10.440
heckling,

517
00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:14.400
let's just support and give somebody at least 20 minutes to get to a fucking

518
00:31:14.401 --> 00:31:14.940
punchline.

519
00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:19.110
This was like club comics going down there and then just some Weirdo people
that,

520
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.350
you know,
just what,
just totally different.
But all the comics loved them.

521
00:31:22.351 --> 00:31:24.350
And I used to do a place down here called surf reality.

522
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.780
I remember every time I got off the train and I walked over here,
I used to fuck,

523
00:31:27.781 --> 00:31:31.650
I was convinced I was going to get mugged and uh,

524
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:36.150
I bought this jacket from the army navy store and a black fucking hat trying to

525
00:31:36.151 --> 00:31:40.080
look like I was in nom or some shit.
And uh,
you know,
keeping my head down.

526
00:31:40.081 --> 00:31:44.820
So they didn't see the fucking Ron Howard look on my God damn face,

527
00:31:44.821 --> 00:31:45.654
you know?

528
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:47.263
<v 4>MMM.</v>

529
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:51.170
<v 3>You know what's great about this is as I look out this,</v>

530
00:31:51.171 --> 00:31:54.980
I might be able to do a whole podcast and not bring up what is happening to my

531
00:31:54.981 --> 00:31:59.780
Boston Celtics,
Jesus Christ.
Everything that I feared finally happened.

532
00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.450
I told you guys when we first started watching him,
I'm like,

533
00:32:02.451 --> 00:32:07.451
how could a team that doesn't really have a center that doesn't rebound is not

534
00:32:07.671 --> 00:32:11.690
good playing d and the paint and lives and dies by the three?

535
00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:16.520
How can you win in the NBA?
But they did and I bought into it.

536
00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.450
And you know what a big bucket of reality hit us in the,

537
00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:22.940
gave us the old right there,
Fred.
I don't know if game three is tonight,

538
00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:27.260
but after watching game to Jesus Christ,
I was,

539
00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:29.240
I was so excited.
I forgot the number one pick.

540
00:32:29.241 --> 00:32:32.540
Next year I'm going to go out on a limb and say,
maybe we should get a center.

541
00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.830
Where are you guys second man,
you still believe Kelly Olynyk.

542
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.600
<v 1>If the rest of the team can somehow get us to game seven,</v>

543
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:46.730
I'm warning you people in Cleveland Right now,

544
00:32:46.731 --> 00:32:48.470
you better watch out for Kelly Olynyk.

545
00:32:48.471 --> 00:32:52.550
That is a bad man and games seven games one through six,

546
00:32:52.551 --> 00:32:56.510
he's fucking horrific.
But you get that man to game seven,
lucky seven.

547
00:32:56.511 --> 00:32:56.970
That's how I,

548
00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:01.970
that's what I call lucky seven with this Colby 11th brings to Celtics to have

549
00:33:03.141 --> 00:33:06.340
and some shit.
I don't know if it rhymes.
It's true.
Um,

550
00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:08.540
I don't know after game too,

551
00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:13.490
I'm wondering if we're even going to make it to game four.
I mean,

552
00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:16.070
we lost by 54 fucking points.

553
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.700
That's like some shit that happens when you're like in middle school.

554
00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:21.713
<v 4>MMM.</v>

555
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:25.880
<v 3>But his,
there's a part of me that actually enjoys this because,</v>

556
00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:27.960
<v 4>mmm.</v>

557
00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:32.890
<v 3>I'm rooting against the warriors and I think it bugs Lebron and the Cavaliers</v>

558
00:33:32.891 --> 00:33:34.390
that we were the number one seed,

559
00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.140
I think it bugs him that they acted like we even remotely had a shot against

560
00:33:38.141 --> 00:33:41.910
them.
And I know Isaiah is hard.
We just found that out.
But come on,
he's hurt.

561
00:33:41.911 --> 00:33:45.010
So what we only lose by 34 points.
Um,

562
00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.860
I think they just got a chip on his shoulder,

563
00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:51.880
did the defending champs and nobody is talking about them like they are and

564
00:33:51.881 --> 00:33:55.490
everybody's up the fucking ass.
You know the old,

565
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.600
the Boston Celtics who they are number one seat just trying to,

566
00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:02.500
<v 1>well the series,
right.
And everybody's out there talking about the fucking,</v>

567
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:07.690
the filthy golden state warriors kicking people in the balls and blowing out

568
00:34:07.691 --> 00:34:09.860
fucking ankles and shit.
Um,

569
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:10.733
<v 4>okay.</v>

570
00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:16.130
<v 3>I mean has there been a more boring western conference or Eastern conference?</v>

571
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:18.770
Matchups I mean these things have just been absolute blowouts.

572
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.940
I bet they call an upstart again and he's going to get those mobbed up reps in

573
00:34:23.941 --> 00:34:26.890
that it fucking start fixing some games again just so they don't lose out on all

574
00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:29.030
this ad money cause these things are just going to go,

575
00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:34.490
they're going to go for games rather than having 14 games possibly of ad money.

576
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.840
They're going to have the bare minimal eight,
you know,
and these owners,
man,

577
00:34:38.841 --> 00:34:41.930
they got a lot of money they have to pay out to these players.
You know,

578
00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.440
they spend a lot of money with their hookers and all that type of shit,
you know,

579
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:51.640
<v 1>near fucking tummies tucked lap band surgery and all the ship getting their</v>

580
00:34:51.641 --> 00:34:55.060
faces yanked back so they can keep banging the underpaid cheerleaders or

581
00:34:55.061 --> 00:34:56.440
whatever it is that they do.

582
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:02.340
<v 3>So everybody,
I've,
everybody's just basically waiting for the finals and um,</v>

583
00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.670
I don't know,
man.
I don't want to jinx it.

584
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:10.200
I'm going to shut up cause I already jinxed the fucking city of Washington

585
00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.800
by just saying I don't want to jinx it.
But,
uh,
I think,
uh,

586
00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.340
I'm not gonna say what's going to happen.

587
00:35:17.341 --> 00:35:19.950
I'm just saying what I would love to see.
I want to see the Cavaliers win.

588
00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:23.280
I want to see them go fucking back to back.

589
00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:29.360
And I want to see that fucking Dream Team of a,

590
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.190
I dunno,
I can't say a bunch of free agents.
Just,
I don't know.

591
00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.230
I've just all country because I wanted to see the fucking,

592
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:39.570
I wanted to see the thunder,
see if they could get by him.

593
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:42.660
I didn't want to see the fucking one of their best guys just join them.

594
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:46.980
God Damn team.
Um,
can you imagine it like back in the day,

595
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.001
you know,

596
00:35:48.001 --> 00:35:52.380
like when Larry Bird steals the ball from Isaiah can imagines the next year,

597
00:35:52.381 --> 00:35:56.820
like Isaiah Thomas was a Celtic then we just kicked the shit is a fucking guy

598
00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:59.160
staring at me.
Like why I'm doing this recording right now.

599
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:06.260
I just waved down and he continued to stare at me and now I'm feeling like now

600
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:12.120
I'm feeling weird.
Oh,
I guess he was looking at the car.

601
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:17.880
It's sunglasses on Jesus Christ.
It's this guy.

602
00:36:17.881 --> 00:36:19.950
A fucking robot.
And why is he looking at me?

603
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.920
He's got a minivan and he just stay.
I'm in a SUV,

604
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:28.560
I guess if you have a minivan,
you fucking,

605
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.730
you take your sunglasses off to look at an SUV.
Right?

606
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.900
The minivan is sort of the ball,
his SUV

607
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:43.320
and the SUV sorta the one ball like a,
I don't know,
full size truck.

608
00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:48.460
I don't know how it works.
I'm not a redneck.
I'll fuck day.

609
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:52.590
The Handmaid's tale on Hulu.
So anybody watching that.

610
00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.430
I came home the other day and my mother in law,
she always,

611
00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.620
she watches all these shows that I would never see.

612
00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.330
She started to watch one about,

613
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:04.500
it was about this girl who committed suicide and left like a tape and she was

614
00:37:04.501 --> 00:37:08.640
watching that one.
Now it's like it's like little house in the prairie meats,

615
00:37:08.641 --> 00:37:12.750
like an s and m video.
It was really weird.
I don't know what was going on.

616
00:37:12.751 --> 00:37:13.140
Like they would,

617
00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.840
they would make these nuns and they were trying to escape this thing and one of

618
00:37:15.841 --> 00:37:19.140
them makes it on the subway and the other one doesn't and then next thing you

619
00:37:19.141 --> 00:37:21.300
know they've got her tied down and they're beaten her feet.

620
00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:28.230
How do you get that job?

621
00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:34.710
You official like feet beat her.
I could see like back in the day,

622
00:37:34.711 --> 00:37:37.230
you know what I mean?
Back in the,
well maybe this was not this.

623
00:37:37.231 --> 00:37:38.520
What seems to be like in the future,

624
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:43.380
do you realize that there's people out there that they're born in at some point

625
00:37:43.381 --> 00:37:45.330
when they try to figure out like what am I good at?

626
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.190
Like the answer to that ends up being torturing other human beings have fucked

627
00:37:50.191 --> 00:37:53.590
up,
isn't it?
You know what I mean?
Just like,

628
00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.860
it's kind of like being like a comedian either funny or you're not.

629
00:37:57.861 --> 00:37:59.270
You can't teach somebody to be funny.

630
00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.570
And then there's like the like torture and stuff.

631
00:38:02.571 --> 00:38:07.520
You just can't teach somebody to be able to do that and just like block it out

632
00:38:07.521 --> 00:38:09.260
as somebody fucking screaming this site.

633
00:38:09.261 --> 00:38:12.350
He was sitting there screaming and crying.
The guys just,

634
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.420
just whacking the shit out of her feet.

635
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.880
I always come always as my alarm.
Like Jesus is kind of what the fuck,

636
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:21.920
what the hell are you watch?
And she always laughs,
he's like,
I don't know,

637
00:38:21.921 --> 00:38:23.270
I just put this on.

638
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:30.020
All right,
so here we are.
Jesus Christ.
You know,

639
00:38:30.021 --> 00:38:31.670
I got to give it up to the graffiti artists.

640
00:38:31.671 --> 00:38:35.360
Like they've really taken it to another level
know

641
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:39.850
and certain tattoos I've noticed,
you know,

642
00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:42.810
there's like that the high level tattoo artists are amazing.

643
00:38:42.811 --> 00:38:46.960
But the problem is is most people that get tattoos,
uh,

644
00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:48.780
don't have a lot of money.
So like,

645
00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:53.100
you know what's the worst is when you see somebody going to a tattoo parlor and

646
00:38:53.101 --> 00:38:55.470
they're looking at shit on the wall and it's just like,
dude,

647
00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.330
that's going to be in your body for life.
You don't even have like a,

648
00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:03.360
you don't have an idea,
you don't have a theme
and see a,

649
00:39:03.361 --> 00:39:04.194
I don't know,

650
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:10.500
kind of like a butterfly with like a B.
And that's what's gonna end up happening.

651
00:39:10.501 --> 00:39:13.020
If you look on a wall,
it's either going to be a skull.

652
00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:17.550
What sets star Tattoo that everybody has that red and fucking black one.

653
00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.320
I know like three comedians that have them and a couple of boyband guys have

654
00:39:23.541 --> 00:39:26.850
him.
I don't know what it is.
Maybe it's an anime thing.
I have no idea.

655
00:39:26.851 --> 00:39:31.050
That's my new word enemy.
Cause I'm watching that fucking one punch man.
Uh,

656
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:34.320
anyways,
let's get back to the Celtics.
Holy fucking shit.

657
00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:35.610
You realize we have lost,

658
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:38.143
<v 0>I think</v>

659
00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.240
<v 3>we've lost by like a total of like,</v>

660
00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:45.560
like north of 80 points and the first two games definitely north of 70.

661
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.710
Like,
if you took all the,

662
00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:54.150
if you just had the Cavaliers win by one end game one and then one in game two

663
00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.600
and you just gave him all those other points,
like they would not,

664
00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:00.660
they could have me in there.
But whose kid know me?

665
00:40:00.661 --> 00:40:02.280
You got me in there for about a quarter and a half.

666
00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:07.000
It's all tired up 78 78.
Uh,

667
00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:10.490
Jesus Christ.
I mean this is like one,

668
00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:14.670
this is the worst beating a Celtic team has ever taken in my life in the

669
00:40:14.671 --> 00:40:17.760
playoffs.
Uh,
the other,
the other closest,

670
00:40:17.761 --> 00:40:19.980
most humiliating one to this was,

671
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.400
I don't know if a lot of people don't remember this during the Larry Bird era,

672
00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:26.400
and it was the last year of Bill Fitch.
She'd kind of lost the team.

673
00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.590
I guess they blame the coach.
I don't know how,

674
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:33.920
but we got swept by the Milwaukee Bucks and I remember we lost game one and we

675
00:40:34.561 --> 00:40:37.140
lost game two and then we lost game three and I just kept thinking like,

676
00:40:37.141 --> 00:40:38.670
they're going to turn it on,
they're going to turn it on.

677
00:40:38.671 --> 00:40:43.260
And then they lost game four.
And that team had Larry Byrd,
Robert Parish,

678
00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:48.060
Kevin Mchale.
Uh,
I don't think we had Dennis Johnson at that point.

679
00:40:48.061 --> 00:40:51.000
And I'm trying to remember who was on the box.
It was Sidney Moncrief.

680
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:54.150
<v 0>I Dunno who else.
Um,</v>

681
00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:56.101
<v 3>dude,</v>

682
00:40:56.101 --> 00:40:58.950
I'm so psyched that I already got 40 minutes of this fucking podcast done cause

683
00:40:58.951 --> 00:41:02.860
I have no god damn time.
Like I was supposed to beat this thing that I'm doing.

684
00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:07.750
I was supposed to be there 25 minutes ago.
It's five 55.

685
00:41:07.751 --> 00:41:09.250
It's supposed to start at six 30.

686
00:41:09.251 --> 00:41:13.720
So there's some pa right now freaking the fuck out.

687
00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:15.920
<v 0>And um,</v>

688
00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.520
<v 3>there's nothing I can do about it.
I'll go there.
Someone House the street,</v>

689
00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:22.910
the fire engine.

690
00:41:22.911 --> 00:41:25.400
And this is just like the fire chief has got like a pickup truck.

691
00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:28.770
<v 0>MMM.</v>

692
00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:33.620
<v 3>Oh,
they've got a fire engineer,
by the way,
dude.
You see that fucking lunatic,</v>

693
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:39.200
which is plowed into the,
uh,
all those people in Times Square.

694
00:41:39.201 --> 00:41:43.670
What the fuck is wrong with people,
Jason?

695
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:45.990
I didn't want to like talk about it to give anybody fucking ideas.

696
00:41:45.991 --> 00:41:49.680
Let's get off that subject.
Oh,
the Adidas store.
I love Adidas.

697
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:54.810
I've always been an Adidas guy.
I don't mind Nike,
you know,
I like it.

698
00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:59.580
I was like the Adidas better.
You know why?
Because no one knew.

699
00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.820
Like everyone knew Adidas before Nike came along.
If it's Nike,
Nike,

700
00:42:02.821 --> 00:42:06.720
I don't know what it is.
Oh Wow.
Look at this.
This is down near the old fucking

701
00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.660
I.
Oh,
subway stop.

702
00:42:09.661 --> 00:42:12.270
When I used to live on the upper east side and I used to come down and go to the

703
00:42:12.271 --> 00:42:14.220
comedy cellar and the Boston Comedy Club,

704
00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.130
Astor place,
that's what I used to get off.

705
00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:22.460
And that's when he started looking up all the names of these people.

706
00:42:22.461 --> 00:42:24.770
Like who is it?
What is Astor place?

707
00:42:24.771 --> 00:42:28.310
And I found out about the aster family and you get,
they just all,

708
00:42:28.311 --> 00:42:31.820
just a bunch of fucking slum lords,
all the statues.

709
00:42:31.821 --> 00:42:35.000
I just started looking them up,
learned about the triangle shirtwaist fire

710
00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:41.240
people jump into their fucking deaths because somebody's locked the door to the,

711
00:42:41.241 --> 00:42:43.550
uh,
look that one up the triangle.

712
00:42:43.551 --> 00:42:47.210
Shirtwaist fire actually read a book on it.

713
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:51.260
And uh,
it was just,
I don't know why.
I did.
It was,

714
00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:54.830
it was the most uncomfortable book since I read,
I read the book,

715
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.500
the perfect storm.
And um,

716
00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.910
if you don't want to buy the book,
just fucking open it up and just,

717
00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:04.200
there's a chapter,

718
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:08.700
maybe like a three page thing maybe where the guy describes what happens when

719
00:43:08.701 --> 00:43:13.320
you drown and it's just like,
I don't know how you fucking blood goes cold man.

720
00:43:13.321 --> 00:43:14.760
It's fucking freaky.
So

721
00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:18.800
do you know ever they find those guys in the caves,

722
00:43:18.801 --> 00:43:20.480
they always had this goofy smile on their face.

723
00:43:20.481 --> 00:43:25.190
Like those divers decided to fucking swim into a damn cave.

724
00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:31.790
Then what I love,
they're dumb enough to do that.

725
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.070
And then some poor bastard has to go in there.

726
00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:39.570
It has to go in there and try to fucking
find.

727
00:43:39.571 --> 00:43:40.760
And why don't you just leave him?
Why did they,

728
00:43:40.761 --> 00:43:45.720
why don't they just leave them down there?
What the fuck?

729
00:43:45.721 --> 00:43:48.420
I don't understand.
You know what I mean?
Just fucking leave him down there.

730
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:54.610
Why do you get to spend all that money to go get a swim into a cave?

731
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:59.410
He went into a cave underwater.
Like,
what the fuck are we supposed to do?

732
00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:02.950
And that's somebody,
God damn job,
they've got to go down and fish.

733
00:44:02.951 --> 00:44:06.070
You going down there,
no one,
you're going to see a dead body when they find them.

734
00:44:06.071 --> 00:44:08.830
I guess they always have this goofy smile on their face because the last thing

735
00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:13.750
is your body releases.
I don't all this dopamine or some shit.

736
00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:16.390
I've sound like Joe Rogan right now except I don't know what I'm talking about.

737
00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:21.460
A dope mean and you know one of those drugs that those fucking ravers take

738
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:27.070
releases that shit.
Right.
And they feel this,
this level of euphoria,

739
00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.100
like the nd your life level of euphoria.

740
00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:34.060
And then the next day that just eating like a bowl of apple jacks and they did

741
00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:37.440
like just burst out in tears because it's so fucking depressing cause they

742
00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:39.450
fucked up.
They already know what it feels like,
the dive,

743
00:44:39.451 --> 00:44:43.620
whichever Delhi after you go through the horror or blah blah blah blah under the

744
00:44:43.621 --> 00:44:47.430
walker,
I guess it's a nice experience and be like,
hey man,

745
00:44:47.431 --> 00:44:49.740
that was just that bad.
Um,

746
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:55.920
strive with x amount of my fucking mind.
I know what,
uh,
where we get 44 minutes,

747
00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:59.040
44 fucking minutes.
Oh,
Jesus.

748
00:44:59.041 --> 00:45:01.980
I used to go down here and I used to do hot 97,

749
00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.540
you know,
back in the day when everything was fucking crazy,

750
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.520
like three times a year,

751
00:45:08.521 --> 00:45:11.550
rappers would see they have like a gun battle and the fucking lobby.

752
00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:14.690
And I would go down there whenever I was doing,
uh,

753
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.900
whenever I was doing Caroline's,
you know,

754
00:45:18.901 --> 00:45:23.670
and I used to headline Carolines on like a Tuesday night and they would,
uh,

755
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:27.720
Louis Faranda used to have to pull the fucking curtain,
you know,

756
00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:33.480
so wouldn't look bad.
And,
uh,
I was doing talents,

757
00:45:33.481 --> 00:45:36.720
rums and a,
so let's do the white and the black room.

758
00:45:36.721 --> 00:45:39.080
So I used to come down here and they used to try to get some people that maybe

759
00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:43.800
saw me open,
fair,
a
talent or drew Frasier,

760
00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:47.310
a fucking Gerald Kelly,
the New York kings.

761
00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:50.640
<v 4>MMM.</v>

762
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:54.050
<v 3>Rob Stapleton.
All of them ice do that rooms.
Uh,</v>

763
00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:00.310
one of the most fun times in my career that I had was,

764
00:46:00.311 --> 00:46:04.690
was doing that stuff.
Uh,
nobody knew who the fuck I was.
I had to go on stage,

765
00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:07.900
you know,
we expect now people come out,
they know who I am.

766
00:46:07.901 --> 00:46:10.780
So then it's like I have to work to lose them.

767
00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:15.280
Went back then I actually had to fucking earn it.
And uh,
you know,

768
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:19.210
believe me,
I,
I look back on those days fondly,
but I don't,

769
00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:20.620
I don't miss nuts selling tickets.

770
00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:27.250
So whenever I come back here,
I always think about all of those gigs.

771
00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:28.443
Um,

772
00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:33.720
Capone used to have this room Nell's on 14th street and it was the greatest

773
00:46:34.181 --> 00:46:34.901
fucking bar,

774
00:46:34.901 --> 00:46:39.901
but it was such a hard room for me that one in Labar bet talent had that one and

775
00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:45.040
that one,
that fucking room,
every time I went there,
it was like I bombed.

776
00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.370
Next time I killed,
I bombed,
I killed.
And I,

777
00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:51.970
I could never figure that roadmap was like an after work party.

778
00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:57.840
And I used to go up there white as hell.
And it just,
either they,
you know,

779
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:59.800
you had basically in the black rooms you have,

780
00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:03.880
you have your opening joke and then that's it.
They black people had,

781
00:47:03.881 --> 00:47:07.600
they're very much like Sicilian.
Swear it,
it's like you're dead to them.

782
00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:11.650
You fuck up once that's it.
You dead to me over there's,

783
00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:15.590
there's this relationship is done and there's no,
there's no,
uh,

784
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:17.880
there's no repairing it.
Um,

785
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.640
which is why it's amazing what's her face.

786
00:47:21.641 --> 00:47:25.300
The Fuji Chick there started to get booed on the Apollo and then fucking turned

787
00:47:25.301 --> 00:47:29.260
it around.
The hell's her God damn name.
You know,

788
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.750
<v 1>amazing voice.
Cute.
Is Health four hours late to her shows.</v>

789
00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:39.250
Lauren Hill.
Lauren Hill.
Um,

790
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:42.730
whenever I hear the Fuji Music,
that reminds me when I first moved down here,

791
00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:46.270
that uh,
Ooh,
tank claim 36 chambers.

792
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.800
And what else?
What else was I listening to back then?

793
00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:55.570
I don't know.
Okay.
Now if this kind of driving like a fucking maniac,

794
00:47:55.571 --> 00:47:59.480
I think he's sick of my podcast here.
Um,
how far away are we?

795
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:03.730
Another five minutes.
Another five minutes.
You know,
they're freaking out,
man.

796
00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:07.870
What the fuck is he going to a hotel?
Phone?
Yeah,
I got to,

797
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:12.580
I look like I look like I just came from Saskatchewan and they're going to take

798
00:48:12.581 --> 00:48:15.210
pictures so I can't be looking like that.
I got to look like a,

799
00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:21.220
at least bathe today.
Um,
ah dude,

800
00:48:21.221 --> 00:48:25.480
I had fucking 6:30 AM flight today.
Uh,
not that puts me in a goddamn mood.

801
00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:27.430
My show didn't get done until 12,

802
00:48:27.431 --> 00:48:30.340
and of course I had to go out and have a couple of pops to celebrate the end of

803
00:48:30.341 --> 00:48:32.950
the tour.
Um,
I want to thank everybody who would seriously,

804
00:48:32.951 --> 00:48:36.730
who came out in Winnipeg.
Everybody that came out and uh,

805
00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:42.040
tube saskatoons sorry about the pop it on the piece here and uh,

806
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:45.310

Regina,
I had a great time.
I'm definitely,

807
00:48:45.311 --> 00:48:48.400
those three cities are now part of my tours.

808
00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:53.770
Um,
now I,
I feel I can go right across the whole southern part.

809
00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.790
So I was telling people the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to do to

810
00:48:57.791 --> 00:49:02.020
Alaska over the yellow knife and some other ones.
Jesus Christ,

811
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.500
fucking nine foot lady with no clothes on.
And you see that

812
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:09.910
she had her ass hanging out of the bottom of her fucking dress

813
00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:16.930
like a sand trap.
Somebody fucking divots in it.
Sorry,

814
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:21.190
I'm sorry.
I'm not that,

815
00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:24.970
And we stopped to get gas.

Oh,

816
00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.480

It makes me feel more normal cause that's all I do.

832
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:16.200
Don't you think part of it is because we feel like,
you know,

833
00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:17.510
they don't know what we're doing.

834
00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:20.780
We're too wrapped up in ourselves or do you think they're morons

835
00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:24.480
<v 5>when you arrived and,
and none of the 99 people is wrong.
That makes you weird.</v>

<v 1>There you go.
Yeah,

Bill's Barn Burger.

845
00:50:51.511 --> 00:50:55.280
Do you have to circle?
I think you've got my phone number.

No,

Somebody saying hello.

855
00:51:24.721 --> 00:51:26.940
Unless we're in that fucking movie with the guy from Beretta.

856
00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:28.710
You ever see that movie?

857
00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:32.580
The guy who killed somebody or maybe killed somebody got out of jail.

858
00:51:32.581 --> 00:51:34.430
He played Beretta remembered the,

859
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:38.400
they call them the guy who did like twin peaks or something.

860
00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:43.240
Come on.
You know that not Mulholland drive.
What's the,

861
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:47.250

862
00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:51.750
No,
I'm gonna call you.
Don't do it.
All right.

863
00:51:51.751 --> 00:51:53.040
Why don't you just give me your phone and I'll do it.

864
00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:57.130
I don't say my number here now.
It's not three one.
Oh,

865
00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:01.470
Just give me the Goddamn.
Why do you have one glove on?

866
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:05.250
Unless you drive and glove and I,

867
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:07.640
Michael Jackson that I knew when I use the left hand moves

868
00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:13.440
right with Michael Jackson.
I love it.
You Beg,

869
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:17.870
You got Frank.
You know something.
I actually think he did too.
You know what?
Yeah.

870
00:52:17.871 --> 00:52:22.370
You can't fucking molest a bunch of white kids even if you became white.
Yeah,

871
00:52:22.371 --> 00:52:26.270
and get off on it twice.
But California couldn't,

872
00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:27.710
they couldn't nail down Oj.
Right.

873
00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:32.400
They just want to do a one is the reputation that they just want you to.

874
00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:36.260
All right.
Having said that,
would you leave,
would you,
would you if you had a kid,

875
00:52:36.261 --> 00:52:38.180
I don't know.
If you have kids you wouldn't leave and with Michael though,
right?

876
00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:42.380
Okay.
Now they're all day cause they could fight them off.

877
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:48.170
I'm going to park on that side so you can feel free to take all your time.

878
00:52:48.171 --> 00:52:52.450
I'll be right here.

Stomping his foot.

879
00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:55.580
Then your fucking kids got to go up.
All right.
I got to hit pause on this.

880
00:52:55.581 --> 00:52:58.970

All right.
Backs.

881
00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:03.760
Pack your bag.
Oh yeah.

883
00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:07.100
there's like regular clothes and then this headlining clothes.

884
00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:11.250
I've got to get on my head.
Planning.
Okay.
All right.

885
00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:13.820
Okay.
I'll talk to you.
It's in a minute.

886
00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:20.840
All right.

I'm back.
Oh,

887
00:53:20.841 --> 00:53:22.940
for freckled Foucault is back here.

888
00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:25.980
I did all my breasts that I had to

889
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.330
<v 6>do.
I want to thank everybody over at vulture fest.
Everybody treated me great.</v>

890
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:32.280
I had a fun time going back and forth.

891
00:53:32.281 --> 00:53:36.330
One of the women over there was giving me shit about how bad the Celtics were

892
00:53:36.331 --> 00:53:39.000
playing and uh,
you know,

893
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:43.170
and I was just agreeing with her and then she just kept trying to do a dig on

894
00:53:43.171 --> 00:53:45.560
the Celtics and I go,
you know,
I really don't appreciate you.

895
00:53:45.561 --> 00:53:47.790
A little passive aggressive comments on the Celtics.

896
00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:51.680
I'm admitting that you're kicking our ass.
And then she laughed,
gone,
ah,

897
00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:56.430
you caught the,
so I go,
you know what part of Ohio you're from?
I mean,

898
00:53:56.431 --> 00:54:00.720
she goes,
oh,
I'm not from Ohio.
I go,
wait a minute,
you know,
from Ohio,

899
00:54:00.721 --> 00:54:05.240
how are you a Cavaliers fan?
She goes,
I'm a Lebron Fan,
and like,

900
00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:07.380
get the fuck out.
And she goes,
yeah,
no,

901
00:54:07.381 --> 00:54:10.920
I was a fan of his when he went down to Miami.

902
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:14.430
And I'm a fan now that he's gone back to Cleveland.
He's just like,

903
00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:16.443
<v 7>you know,</v>

904
00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:20.560
<v 6>find out she's from Washington DC.
I'm like,
you're a fucking wizards fan.</v>

905
00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:23.290
She goes,
Ooh,
I don't want to do that.
It's just,
you know what,

906
00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:28.100
I actually respect it on some level.
I think that she's a,
uh,

907
00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.550
<v 7>you know,
if,</v>

908
00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:35.460
<v 6>I guess if they're all going to be free agents and piling on with each other,</v>

909
00:54:35.461 --> 00:54:37.530
then you might as well be like a free agent fence,

910
00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:42.830
then it doesn't fucking matter.
Right.
I Dunno.
I Dunno what was pulled out.

911
00:54:42.831 --> 00:54:43.551
I'm just joking around.

912
00:54:43.551 --> 00:54:47.690
We had a great time giving each other shit and then I got to sit down.
They,
um,

913
00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:48.981
it was pretty cool.

914
00:54:48.981 --> 00:54:51.950
They actually showed the first episode of season two and from what I heard,

915
00:54:51.951 --> 00:54:54.590
people really liked it.
I,
of course was not in the room.

916
00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:55.940
I didn't want to deal with that.

917
00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:58.030
<v 7>And,
um,</v>

918
00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:03.900
<v 6>and then we went and we did a,
uh,
I went in,</v>

919
00:55:03.901 --> 00:55:06.960
I did it the interview in front of the crowd that just saw it and a handed out

920
00:55:06.961 --> 00:55:08.490
some free tee shirts.
We had these,

921
00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:12.270
these condoms made up is for family condoms and stuff.
Handed them out.

922
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:16.860
People like those took some pictures afterwards is great interview,
you know,

923
00:55:16.861 --> 00:55:19.770
just great questions.
And that type of thing was a lot of fun.
And uh,

924
00:55:19.771 --> 00:55:24.480
knocked it out.
So,
oh Billy boy is going to be hitting the fucking hotel,

925
00:55:24.481 --> 00:55:29.010
blah.
He assumed how much him I got left here.
I got a knock out.

926
00:55:29.011 --> 00:55:33.270
Another fucking five minutes.
I might do it tomorrow morning.

927
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:37.440
Maybe I'll do that.
You know,
cause it doesn't make a difference because you guys,

928
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:41.130
I got to watch the Celtics man.

00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:58.560
Setting the world on fire.

933
00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:02.850
How much are we down by Kelly Olynyk for the love of God.

934
00:56:02.851 --> 00:56:05.100
Pretend it's fourth quarter game seven.

935
00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:08.130

938
00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:18.340
You don't really hear this shit.

939
00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:23.320
I'm going to watch the God damn game and I know dude live commentate 11 not

940
00:56:23.321 --> 00:56:26.590
doing that.
So I'm gonna just sit here watching these people get in.

941
00:56:26.591 --> 00:56:27.940
The fucking shit kicked out of them.

942
00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:29.260
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

943
00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:32.060
<v 6>Isaiah is out.
I mean we could potentially</v>

944
00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:35.210
that we could lose by 40.

945
00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:36.173
<v 8>Okay.</v>

946
00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:40.840
<v 6>Oh my God.
All of a sudden just having the number one draft pick just seems a lot</v>

947
00:56:40.841 --> 00:56:43.600
different.
I knew all these fucking people going,
like,
I'll tell you right now,

948
00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:45.280
the Celtics Arolio player way,

949
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:48.380
I was at least smart enough to say we're more like a player and a half away half

950
00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:53.170
though it meaning we needed to players remember a few months ago where they were

951
00:56:53.171 --> 00:56:58.171
trying to suggest if we got Carmelo Anthony like we'd have a legitimate shot to

952
00:57:00.431 --> 00:57:04.960
take out.
Fucking,
I almost said the Lebron James,
the Cavaliers.

953
00:57:04.961 --> 00:57:06.910
But that's really what it is.
Um,

954
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:09.940
I don't think we do this and I'm going to watch this game.

955
00:57:09.941 --> 00:57:12.700
This podcast is going to be like,
I owe you three minutes.
