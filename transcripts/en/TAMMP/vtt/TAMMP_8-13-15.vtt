00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.030
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill bar and it's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:08.340
Monday morning podcast.
Just before Friday.

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.850
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.850
<v 0>I'm just checking in on you,
man.
How's your week going?
Is it flying by?</v>

5
00:00:19.851 --> 00:00:24.851
Hopefully we've got to make something that summer's almost going away.

6
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.400
Um,
I absolutely butchered.

7
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.210
So fucking chicken on the big green egg.
How the fuck do you do that?

8
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.780
I'll tell you how you do that.
You'll walk away from it,
right?

9
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.540
And you'll run into you a little later.

10
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.340
You know when she's going through some emotional shit and you gotta be there
for,

11
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.750
are you blaming your wife built?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

12
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.330
I was already going to fuck it up because I didn't,
you know,

13
00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:54.950
I never cooked chicken on that thing and they will like really thin too.
And uh,

14
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.690
I,
I dunno,
I don't know what the fuck I did,

15
00:00:56.691 --> 00:01:00.890
but it tastes like fucking shoe leather.
Tough like fucking shoe leather.

16
00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:04.580
That forking chicken was terrible,
but I ate it anyways.

17
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.940
German Irish plowed,
right fucking throw it.

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.650
You would've thought I was eating a fucking lamb shank.
Is the lamb shank good?

19
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.620
The fuck is going on with my ac.
We go

20
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.770
at the fucking thing closed there.
Um,
anyways,
by the way,

21
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:25.490
I got a lot of,
a lot of letters,
a lot of tweaks,

22
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.540
a lot of twitters all wrapped up in the court here.
Um,
about last week's podcast,

23
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.840
Monday mornings pot,
uh,
Monday morning podcast.

24
00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:37.580
It got cut off in the end for whatever reason.
Um,
I still have the audio.

25
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.520
So in classic radio,
old school radio,
I'm going to give you a teaser.
Hey,

26
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.530
off the top,
he ended the podcast.

27
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.560
Who going to have the lost footage from our fucking apple slaw for while Mama,

28
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.160
I'm going to play it at the end.
All right,
that's my little teaser.

29
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.990
Like you can't just fast forward to the fucking end and listen to my answer.
Um,

30
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.720
you know,
stay k folks,
stick around.

31
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.260
Don't forget to stick around to the end of the podcast.

32
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.500
Don't forget to not hit the fast forward button and stick around.

33
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.440
Stick around coming up with a top of the hour.

34
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.120
We've got that red headed Khan to ask him that question that got cut off from

35
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:21.680
four days ago.
Um,
anyway,
so it's Thursday,
Huh?

36
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.100
It's today payday for you.
The fuck did they take from you?

37
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:26.600
Now you have to think about that.

38
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:29.870
How much money they take out of taxes and the amount that actually goes towards

39
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:34.730
this shit that they need to fix.
What do you think it is?
You know what I mean?

40
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:39.530
They take a nice fucking sweet fucking 30,
35% of all your,
God.
Damn.

41
00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:42.410
I was probably more than that.
I'm just talking about idea.
Check with,

42
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.450
forget about that.
The hidden gas tax,
right?
Every time you go out to get a a,

43
00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:50.690
one of them little medicine things for the fucking corn on your foot,
you know,

44
00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:52.940
there's tax on that.
This fucking tax on everything.

45
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.460
It was pissing me off the other day.

46
00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:57.680
I was thinking about how when cars first came out,

47
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.660
you just had a fucking car and you drove around.
It was all good.

48
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.200
Then they had to regulate them and you to get a license plates they knew who

49
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.050
have fuck everybody was and next thing you need to pay taxes on it.

50
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.140
The fuck am I giving you money for?

51
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.213
<v 2>You know,</v>

52
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.740
<v 0>oh,
for the roads,
man,
for the fucking roads.
Fuck you.</v>

53
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.670
You can build a road for like fucking 700 bucks.
I swear to God with you,

54
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:24.910
if you really cut through all the bullshit,
you know,

55
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.050
like right now I'm having this,

56
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:28.480
this little closet thing made on the outside of my house.

57
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:31.450
I already had this little closet thing,
but it was,
you know,

58
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:33.530
it was a dirt floor and that type of shit.

59
00:03:33.531 --> 00:03:36.160
So I'm having put a little concrete on the floor,
give me a little door,

60
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.120
put some shelves in there and I can get some of the shit out of my garage.
Right.

61
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.080
So the guy goes out.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Absolutely.
My friend,

62
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.250
anytime anybody says my friend,
then they can teach.

63
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.120
They're not going to treat you like a friend and a guy came back with this

64
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:53.830
astronomical fucking thing and I was just like,
really?
Come on buddy.
No,
no,

65
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.740
no.
The fucking concrete that's going to cost like 10 grand and a,

66
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.190
the screwdrivers are like 500 bucks a piece plus Labor.
It's just like,

67
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:07.470
how do you do that all day?
How do you do?
How do you just fucking walk around?

68
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.010
They just look at you and they guy,
right?

69
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.780
What can I take this dope for?
Let's check 'em out.
Lack of pigment.

70
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.760
Couple of freckles.
Ah,
man.
He had fucking orange hair when he was a kid.
Oh,

71
00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:24.420
this guy's got no self esteem.
I'm going high on this one.
You know what I mean?

72
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.480
Bye.
Came out,
came out looking like,
what's his face if fucking dude in archer,

73
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.930
right.
Jet Black hair with the fucking steel blue eyes.

74
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.620
I probably got the whole thing done for 300 bucks.
Um,

75
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.280
you know what's funny?
I'm at the age,
I don't even give a fuck.

76
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.700
Is that what it is?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That makes you feel good.

77
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.100
That's going to fill up the fucking back of your jeans so I don't have to look

78
00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:48.930
at your ass crack.
Go ahead.
Go ahead and do it.

79
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.140
Go ahead and knock it out there buddy.
And uh,

80
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.020
I'll get all the shit out of my garage and I'll just go jump on a stage and

81
00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:57.540
dance like a fucking monkey and that'll pay for the closet.
How about that?

82
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.740
How about that,
sir?
How about that?
Alright.

83
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.300
You could sit there with your little Igloo.
Fucking hey.

84
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.620
You know my wife gave me shit because I called alligator shirts,
Lacoste shirts.

85
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:10.830
I call them izods went,
they called izods back in the day.

86
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.573
<v 2>You know,</v>

87
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.050
<v 0>this is one of the things as you,
as you fucking get older as is,</v>

88
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.560
the names of shit changes.
And if you,
if you're not real careful,

89
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:25.270
it'll make you feel like you're going senile.
KFC,
it's Kentucky Fried Chicken.

90
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.350
Look cost.
It's an alligator shirt and izod don't get a fucking guy dude.

91
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.840
I fucking,
I had a scratch cat do it.

92
00:05:33.841 --> 00:05:37.840
I got to fucking like 10 izods going to show up to score.

93
00:05:37.841 --> 00:05:42.550
You'll see me two weeks straight.
Never see the same shirt twice.
Um,

94
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.340
so anyway,
so that things get done and all of that shit.
Um,
AH,
Christ,

95
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:51.950
I got nothing to talk about.
My life's been just going fucking great.
It might,

96
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.250
let's go on.
So great.
I'm not even,
I'm not even afraid to say that.

97
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.890
You don't really think it is.
Instead of,
I've just been in that goddamn editing,

98
00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.470
editing this cartoon,

99
00:05:59.471 --> 00:06:01.810
and it keeps getting funnier and I can't wait for it to come up.

100
00:06:01.811 --> 00:06:03.790
So let's talk about the,
the,
the,
the,

101
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.180
the little amount of shit that I've paid attention to,

102
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.730
sort of paying attention to the election this year,

103
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.600
simply because there's a bush in a Clinton and it again and I,

104
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.900
and I liking that Jeb Bush doesn't seem like he's getting anywhere.

105
00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.490
I can't believe Hillary Clinton.

106
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.080
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

107
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.830
<v 0>People.
How many fucking times do you got to get fucked over by that last name,</v>

108
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.850
Bush or Clinton before you just want somebody new fucking you over.

109
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.760
Is it the familiarity?
Is that what it is?

110
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.650
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

111
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.620
<v 0>it did.
And they are pushing her so fucking hard on CNN.</v>

112
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.270
Just completely ignoring that.

113
00:06:37.271 --> 00:06:39.940
She had a bunch of top secret documents on our laptop.

114
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.990
She's a complete piece of shit.
Just like a debt,
not a dad.
Sorry.

115
00:06:43.991 --> 00:06:46.660
You're fucking sugar daddy.
What did we call him?

116
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.730
I her fucking living arrangement.
Her husband.
Right.

117
00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.810
<v 3>Okay.</v>

118
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.820
<v 0>She goes to those fucking Bilderberg meetings.</v>

119
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.830
She's in the Goddamn Illuminati.
What the fuck are you?

120
00:06:58.831 --> 00:07:00.180
Why would you want her in there?

121
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.300
I've always been a Yankee fan.

122
00:07:04.301 --> 00:07:07.480
You remember that when she lied about that with a brand new Yankee hat,

123
00:07:07.481 --> 00:07:10.390
they want four fucking championships while her husband was in office.

124
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.170
She never said boo about it and all of a sudden she wants to run for fucking

125
00:07:14.171 --> 00:07:18.040
office in New York Gang.
[inaudible] oh my God.

126
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.670
And all the fucking women's groups,
they don't give a fuck.

127
00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:25.960
As long as it's got a clam,
they don't give a shit.
If it's the spawn of Satan,

128
00:07:25.961 --> 00:07:28.390
they're gonna fucking vote for it.
And you know what?
Go ahead and do it.

129
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.190
You're going to get what you deserve.

130
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:32.663
<v 3>Okay,</v>

131
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.050
<v 0>so fucking done.
The dumbest thing guys ever did was shut women out of stuff.</v>

132
00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:38.990
So now they just fucking vote for shit.
Just cause it's a woman.
It's stupid.

133
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.850
We'll get and what the fuck we deserve?

134
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.020
Why do they got to be a part of everything that we created?

135
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:46.550
We created the government,
you know?

136
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.870
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

137
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.830
<v 0>It's a boys only ladies,
I'm fucking with you.</v>

138
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.810
I don't feel that way about the government.

139
00:07:54.811 --> 00:07:58.080
I think it should have a nice balance to,
or do you think about that?
However,

140
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:02.820
the NFL is a men's football league.
All right,
men only.

141
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.740
I'm give,
I'm fucking with you.
I don't give a shit if they have female coaches,

142
00:08:07.741 --> 00:08:12.120
but I don't believe in the NFL getting female coaches because they give a shit

143
00:08:12.121 --> 00:08:12.954
about women.

144
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:18.470
The NFL basically hit maximum density with male fans and they have just been

145
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.150
bending over and grabbing their fucking ankles,

146
00:08:21.151 --> 00:08:26.151
trying to get as many women to enjoy the fucking game so they can make even more

147
00:08:26.671 --> 00:08:28.320
fucking money selling Pink Jersey.

148
00:08:28.321 --> 00:08:31.470
So then they got in business with the pink lady,
right.

149
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:32.810
<v 3>Okay.</v>

150
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:34.910
<v 0>They fucking,
now they've got a coach.</v>

151
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.880
But when it really comes down to what they showed their true colors,

152
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:41.180
when ray rice knocked out that lady in the fucking elevator and dragged her out

153
00:08:41.181 --> 00:08:44.780
like a caveman,
you know,
they don't give a fuck.

154
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:50.290
They gave him four games over that
they don't get,
they don't even pay attention.

155
00:08:50.291 --> 00:08:54.230
I don't think they even fucking pay attention.
Um,
so anyway,

156
00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:57.050
so there's going to be a dot.
Got How a woman fucking coach,

157
00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.160
just the amount of disruption that that's going to cause,
you know,

158
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.230
used to be back in the day,
back in the day,

159
00:09:03.231 --> 00:09:06.240
the fucking coach just ran right in the locker room screaming at everybody.

160
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:10.190
Say that Dick's hanging out now.
Now you know,
and he was in the moment.

161
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:14.160
He just saw that now we're gonna have to,
to wait of everybody towels.

162
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.960
Lorraine's coming in

163
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.830
straight to watch your language.
Everybody.
Uh,

164
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.760
Gee,
I'll tell you,
that was a heck of a thumping.

165
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.920
We took there in the first half and I got to tell you,
I'm,
Oh,

166
00:09:30.921 --> 00:09:34.400
I'm really disappointed.
Um,

167
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:40.640
I dunno.
I give up.
Is,

168
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.230
is there any place we can go?

169
00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.720
I don't understand why they think was so fucking stupid yet.

170
00:09:46.721 --> 00:09:51.040
They want to be involved in everything we're doing.
You know,
with dumb,
you know,

171
00:09:51.041 --> 00:09:55.360
we're going to say a bunch of dumb shit.
Why would you want to be around us?

172
00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.130
Jesus.
I need to take breaks from hanging out with my friends.

173
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:01.270
We're fucking idiots.

174
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.870
I literally have to take breaks from hanging out with my friends because if I

175
00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:08.970
don't,
I'm going to die a much earlier death,
you know,

176
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.480
then he'd come home and you get nagged.

177
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.400
I really didn't think I was going to be this negative this week.
I don't know.

178
00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:17.440
I don't know what to fucking tell you.
Um,
speaking of ladies,

179
00:10:17.441 --> 00:10:19.870
I had a really weird,
uh,
experienced the other day.

180
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.740
I was walking around the block Bato but elbow with my dog,
right?

181
00:10:23.741 --> 00:10:24.940
And I'm walking around the block

182
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.880
and a Nice Neighborhood Street and I'm coming down the street and his,

183
00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:34.890
this lay coming the other way and she's dressed in workout clothes,

184
00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.650
face a little shiny,
like she's got some sweat on her face.

185
00:10:38.651 --> 00:10:42.490
Like she's been out there trying to burn some calories and I was walking and

186
00:10:42.491 --> 00:10:44.740
there was a tree branch that was in my way.

187
00:10:44.741 --> 00:10:48.150
So I kind of had to like kind of put my head in her lane a little bit and goal

188
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:51.310
around it.
And as I did that,
she leaned in,

189
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.460
<v 3>okay.</v>

190
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.210
<v 0>In,
reached down towards my balls and said,</v>

191
00:10:56.211 --> 00:10:59.120
you left nut is hanging a little lower than your right.
And I swear,

192
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.330
I swear to God,
and if my left,
my arms weren't swinging,

193
00:11:02.331 --> 00:11:06.620
like my left arm hit her left arm reaching down,
like she was pointing.

194
00:11:06.621 --> 00:11:10.360
I don't know what she was doing.
I turned around,
I looked,

195
00:11:10.361 --> 00:11:14.370
at first I thought I was wearing shorts and one of my balls was one of my
shorts.

196
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:18.040
I was like,
how fucking old am I?
I looked down,

197
00:11:18.041 --> 00:11:21.580
I had on sweatpants and I look back at it like,
what the fuck?

198
00:11:21.581 --> 00:11:26.450
And She just kept walking.
She didn't seem crazy.

199
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:27.870
<v 3>Okay.</v>

200
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.450
<v 0>I Dunno if she was just out there fucking with white people.</v>

201
00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:33.750
I have no idea what was going on with her.
But,
uh,

202
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.450
it was bizarre.
It kind of made me laugh,

203
00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:41.330
but I didn't like how she tried to touch me,
that fucking really annoyed me.

204
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.240
She fucking leaned in to her head,

205
00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:47.150
was like right next to my head and then I just realized how easily somebody

206
00:11:47.151 --> 00:11:51.260
could just fucking come,
could just stab me while I was walking down the street.

207
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.460
Um,
that not prepared.

208
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.990
She totally got in within the fucking the Bruce Lee perimeter.
Right?

209
00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.810
Dude,
that was Bruce Lee.
Like his reaction.

210
00:12:00.811 --> 00:12:03.330
I mean she would have been across the fucking street,
one inch punch.

211
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.230
She would've been like three quarters of an inch into a fucking tree.

212
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.770
I just stood right there all,
whoa,
what are we,
what are you trying to say to me?

213
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.093
<v 3>I don't know.</v>

214
00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.850
<v 0>The fact that nothing happened,
I think it's Kinda hilarious.</v>

215
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.360
Slash slash like a little unsettling.

216
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:27.480
And then like two days later I'm walking the same fucking root cause you know,

217
00:12:27.481 --> 00:12:31.350
God knows I don't learn a lesson and this other lady's coming

218
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:36.380
and she just starts talking.
I know what the fuck she's saying.
I,
yeah,
dog.

219
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.980
I've had it.
It's walking by like nod.

220
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:40.560
<v 3>Okay.</v>

221
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.100
<v 0>Feel like I was like in a time machine</v>

222
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.860
and I just gone into the future and it was like right before everybody realized

223
00:12:46.861 --> 00:12:48.030
that I wasn't from that time,

224
00:12:48.031 --> 00:12:51.330
which would scare everybody and then of course they'd have to kill me,
you know,

225
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.230
after they examined my brain while I was still alive.
I don't know.

226
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.390
What I've been trying to tell you guys is I've been having a rough time here on

227
00:12:57.391 --> 00:13:01.470
my walks lately.
Um,
speaking of which,

228
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.400
who fuck tries to grab somebody balls when they're walking by it.

229
00:13:05.401 --> 00:13:10.250
You realize how fucking hilarious setters,
hey,

230
00:13:10.251 --> 00:13:14.360
you left nuts hang lower than your writing,
which is like,
what the fuck?

231
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:20.370
I actually watched another 10 feet and then immediately slammed my hand down in

232
00:13:20.371 --> 00:13:22.290
my pocket to be like,
did she just take my wallet?

233
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.110
Because that would have been brilliant because she had me,

234
00:13:25.111 --> 00:13:29.430
but mentally between my fucking ears and not even paying attention to anything

235
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.070
on my body,
she could have fucking taken it out,
shown it to me,

236
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.620
put it back in there and taking everything I had.

237
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.800
Try that this week,
ladies.

238
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:40.993
<v 3>You know,</v>

239
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.100
<v 0>I guarantee you 99% of guys I'm not going to,</v>

240
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.950
they're going to have a same stupid store and at 99%,

241
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.770
a lot of people doing that UFC shit.
You know what,
ladies?
Don't do it.

242
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:54.500
Don't do it.
Um,
so anyways,
uh,

243
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.950
I been going really hard as far as the working out and all that shit.
And uh,

244
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:04.010
all of a sudden my left knee was a little fucking tech and I was like,

245
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.240
oh no,
I fucked up my knee for life.

246
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.440
It was just feeling like that bone on bone shit like a fuck.
Here we go.

247
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.760
Am I going to be that guy who can't walk hobbles out to his car?

248
00:14:14.761 --> 00:14:19.270
Like a fucking former NFL running back and then I get fat.
What do I do then?

249
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.230
I just eat one piece of lettuce every day so I don't become a complete tub of

250
00:14:22.231 --> 00:14:24.100
shit.
And um,

251
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.540
it just so happens I was walking down the same street,

252
00:14:27.541 --> 00:14:29.490
almost the exact same place with that lady,

253
00:14:29.491 --> 00:14:32.340
said my one of my balls was hanging it down a little lower than the other one.

254
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.270
Um,
I swear to God,
I would say she was crazy,

255
00:14:36.271 --> 00:14:40.830
but she was dressed in workout clothes,
color coordinated workout gloves.
Um,

256
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:45.310
but it's not crazy,
right?
I Dunno.

257
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.370
So anyways,
right there,
this guy goes,
hey bill,
Bill my bank.

258
00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:52.100
So I met this guy at this party and um,

259
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.100
he used to be fat and he lost all this weight,
you know,

260
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:58.310
he's in the process of it.
So,
you know,
I fucking love meeting people like that.

261
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.400
I'm asking him what he's doing.
I'm amping them up,
keep after it,
man.

262
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:04.650
You know what I'm saying?
All that shit.
And I just so happened to run into them.

263
00:15:04.651 --> 00:15:06.650
You say,
I say,
how are you doing with the workouts?
He goes,
good,

264
00:15:06.651 --> 00:15:08.090
he's asked me how you don't want to do.
I was and I was like,

265
00:15:08.091 --> 00:15:09.430
I fucked up my name and I don't know,

266
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:14.150
I think I was skipping rope and I on concrete,
I think I fucked it up.

267
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.130
And he goes,
that happened to me,
man.
He goes,

268
00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:19.470
it might just be the muscles in your leg or a little tightness,
sorta like,
uh,

269
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.400
putting pressure on it.
So I was like,
really?

270
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:27.260
So I went home and for like three days in a row,
uh,

271
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:32.030
I did this yoga thing that I got this audio clip does,
Bryan Kest.

272
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.860
B.
R.
Y.
A.
N.
K.
E.
S.
T.
Um,
he might be on iTunes.
It's a great,

273
00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:41.780
it's like a 90 minute one of his class a classes and uh,

274
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.790
<v 3>okay.</v>

275
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:46.140
<v 0>I did it for like half hour,
40 minutes every day.
My knee feels good as no,</v>

276
00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:51.000
so wow,
that's four.
That's for you all guys out there just in case,
uh,

277
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.100
you feel like you've just tweaked it a little bit.
Sometimes.

278
00:15:54.101 --> 00:15:55.690
I just learned that if you stretch a little bit,

279
00:15:55.691 --> 00:15:57.760
sometimes it's actually something else pulling on it,

280
00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:01.540
putting your knee out of whack.
Um,
so having said that,

281
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.860
all freckles
who could not be beat,

282
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.370
it's just been crushing it.
Dude.
I've been eating so well now.

283
00:16:10.371 --> 00:16:14.210
Like I don't even fucking think about chips,
cookies,
any salt,
sugar shit.

284
00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.830
I was like,
I do not want to eat that stuff.
It's going to make me feel gross.

285
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:24.040
That's not much of a fucking twinkle toes I've been eating like,
and um,

286
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.930
I weighed myself this morning after I walk the dog around the block and went on

287
00:16:29.931 --> 00:16:34.550
my hike.
One 71.8.
All right.
Now I know a lot of that.

288
00:16:34.551 --> 00:16:38.650
The second I had a glass of water,
I probably went back up to one 73 but,
uh,

289
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:41.900
I got to get down to one 71 on Sunday and I'm right on fucking schedule

290
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.760
right on schedule.
So,
uh,
I'm psyched man.

291
00:16:46.761 --> 00:16:49.760
I've never stuck with it for this fucking long.
Actually.
No,

292
00:16:49.761 --> 00:16:53.030
I've stuck with it to like a buck 68 and then I just go like,
you know what,

293
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:57.410
I'm getting a Burger and if 12 back,
you know why?
Cause I fucking earned it,

294
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:57.831
right.

295
00:16:57.831 --> 00:17:02.360
And I go out there and that's literally like you stopped smoking crack and then

296
00:17:02.361 --> 00:17:03.770
you just like,
well I've been good.

297
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:07.340
I can go hit the crack pipe and then I'm going to be fine.
And then what I do,

298
00:17:07.341 --> 00:17:09.440
I get that grease,
I get that salt,

299
00:17:09.441 --> 00:17:13.190
I get that sugar back in me and then I start craving that shit and then I start

300
00:17:13.191 --> 00:17:17.570
going up again.
I feel myself getting bigger.
I don't want to step on the scale.

301
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.190
I go into fucking denial.

302
00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:23.930
And then one day somebody fucking calls me a fat fuck on Twitter and I step on

303
00:17:23.931 --> 00:17:25.880
the scale and I'm like a buck 90.
Yeah.

304
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:32.460
In the words of Mr. White in reservoir dogs asphalt.

305
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:37.210
Right.
Y'all my shot made asshole.

306
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:42.460
Um,
so anyways,
I'm,
I'm hanging in there.
I'm hanging in there.

307
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.510
Um,
do you know what actually fucking did I actually looked up,

308
00:17:46.511 --> 00:17:48.340
cause this is the time of year I start getting into baseball.

309
00:17:48.341 --> 00:17:52.650
When it started to a Amanda,
you know,
um,

310
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.700
and I actually looked up the American league east and I knew the red sox weren't

311
00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:58.830
doing well.
I thought we were in second to last place.

312
00:17:58.831 --> 00:18:01.020
Do we are in dead last place

313
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.340
and we are seven games behind Baltimore.

314
00:18:05.341 --> 00:18:10.341
Who's fucking in second to last place where 12 and a half back from the Toronto

315
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.380
Blue Jays who shouldn't even be in the fucking league

316
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.340
baseball is United States of America's game.

317
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.670
All right,
Tara,
I fucking Canada.

318
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:28.710
You have no business being in the league.
You know what I mean?

319
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.860
What do you got?
You got to fucking teams and you lost one of them.

320
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.710
What are you adding to the sport?

321
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.860
Look at,
look at the United States of America.
Look how,

322
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:44.720
look how we had the decency to flesh out your little game.
A hockey,
Huh?

323
00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:49.350
It wasn't for us.
How many teams would you have?
Montreal,

324
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:53.490
Ottawa,
Toronto,
Winnipeg,
Calgary,
Edmonton,
and Vancouver.

325
00:18:53.491 --> 00:18:57.570
You'd have seventeenths.
That's it.
And you know what?

326
00:18:57.571 --> 00:19:00.710
You probably be happy as hell,
right?
How fucking psych would you guys be?
Ft?

327
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.450
Nho was just so 17th when that'd be fun.

328
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.340
Just like you CFL have all these fucking guys who couldn't make it in the

329
00:19:08.341 --> 00:19:12.300
fucking NFL playing up there.
Well,
I guess the NHL would,
would be the NHL.
Oh,

330
00:19:12.301 --> 00:19:14.880
fuck you saying.
Just kicked me off the Internet.

331
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.860
My Internet is the shit in one room.
In the house,
actually.
The living room,

332
00:19:19.861 --> 00:19:22.860
dining room,
kitchen.
It's fucking great.
But the second I go into my office,

333
00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:26.820
which is where my computer lives,
shits the bed.

334
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:31.920
God dammit.
How about the Yankees though,
man?
Huh?
The Yankees are in second place.

335
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:36.450
Good for them.
They didn't go out and try and buy the league like we did.

336
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.080
You know,
the Yankees are like,
uh,

337
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.600
they're like the fuck an older brother that now cleaned up and shit.
We're like,

338
00:19:42.601 --> 00:19:46.230
the younger brother is still fucking party and you know,
y'all abroad,

339
00:19:46.231 --> 00:19:49.110
I don't do that shit anymore.
You know,
I go to bed at 10 o'clock,

340
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.220
get up early in the morning,
drink of water with some lemon in it.

341
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.420
I got to respect the Yankees,
man.
They're not trying to fucking buy it.

342
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.650
Well God knows they still have a bunch of big contracts,

343
00:19:58.651 --> 00:20:02.670
but they didn't go out and buy a bunch of expensive panda bears or whatever the

344
00:20:02.671 --> 00:20:05.190
fuck we did.
What the hell was that third baseman thinking?

345
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:07.500
Why would you leave San Francisco?

346
00:20:07.501 --> 00:20:11.280
Like how much money can they give you to walk away from winning a world series

347
00:20:11.281 --> 00:20:13.830
every other fucking year?
You know,

348
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:18.780
he was already making zillions of dollars.
I want to make a zillion one.

349
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.170
And then he goes over to the red sox and now look at you.
I mean,

350
00:20:22.171 --> 00:20:23.850
I always do and I know he's having a rough start,

351
00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:28.380
but now lucky if fucking 12 and a half games out of first and isn't fun

352
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.620
whenever fucking money you're making more in Boston when you made even more.

353
00:20:34.621 --> 00:20:38.580
If you want another fucking world series just doing commercials.
Hey,

354
00:20:38.581 --> 00:20:42.720
this is the panda fucking talking about us.
San Francisco,

355
00:20:42.721 --> 00:20:47.310
dry cleaning.
Come on down to Alcatraz and just do a bunch of shit.
You know,

356
00:20:47.311 --> 00:20:48.870
come on down to the fucking wharf.

357
00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.030
A best gay club in the China fucking district.
The Presidio.

358
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.890
You could do all those.
All the fucking

359
00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.300
San Francisco Zone aftershave lotion.
You could just do that.

360
00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:04.440
The whole fucking winner and whatever extra money the red sox were going to give

361
00:21:04.441 --> 00:21:09.330
you.
Right?
You can make it up locally.
Then head north,
you know,

362
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:14.310
go up to the wine country,
get shit faced with a couple of third base groupies.

363
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.090
I don't know what it is.
I just always liked that petition.
Right.

364
00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.850
Did you go out to Boston with all the humidity?

365
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.450
I will say at least they have water out there.
They have lakes and shit.

366
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:26.670
<v 3>Okay.</v>

367
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.120
<v 0>Lush land.
Maybe you made a good move.
So as the apocalypse go,
I agree with it,</v>

368
00:21:30.121 --> 00:21:33.840
but as far as a baseball movie,
I think it was really stupid.
I'll do your bill.

369
00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:38.070
Do you?
They're never played in a fucking pro league in your life.
All right,

370
00:21:38.071 --> 00:21:40.440
here we go.
Uh,
do a little advertising.
Once again,

371
00:21:40.441 --> 00:21:45.330
people come on up over the top of the hour,
another Thursday afternoon.

372
00:21:45.331 --> 00:21:46.440
Fucking Tesa.

373
00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.700
If you're just walking by your husband's computer and he's listening,

374
00:21:50.701 --> 00:21:53.250
I'm going to add,
I'm going to have the audio from the,
the last phone thing.

375
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.750
It's completely ridiculous.
Steven fucking try to teach something on a podcast.

376
00:21:57.751 --> 00:21:59.700
People listened to it from beginning to end,
don't they?

377
00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.730
Or they just fast forward to the part that they want.
All right.

378
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.340
Zip recruiter business owners.

379
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.540
Did you know that summer is a great time to hire the best people?

380
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.090
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

381
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:14.630
<v 0>Why is that?
With your competitors on vacation,</v>

382
00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.420
there's less competition for quality candidates.

383
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:22.140
Does that make any sense?
What?
Who's on vacation?
What?

384
00:22:22.141 --> 00:22:23.700
Dunkin donuts just shuts down.

385
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.980
But posting your job in one place isn't enough to find them.

386
00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:30.540
And when you're short staffed,

387
00:22:30.541 --> 00:22:33.990
there's no time to deal with dozens of different jobs sites until now.

388
00:22:33.991 --> 00:22:36.390
Here we go.
Now we're getting into the meats and potato radio,

401
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:26.500
Um,
lastly,
but certainly not least,
Lee,
if you would like to,
uh,

402
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.220
contribute to the,
uh,

403
00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.640
to the Monday morning podcasters,
the afternoon podcasts,
uh,

404
00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.370
but you don't want to give me any fucking money.

405
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.370
Next time you go on Amazon to buy something,

406
00:23:38.371 --> 00:23:42.270
maybe getting yourself a fucking Paris slippers.

407
00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.070
Do I got some slip

408
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.540
<v 3>as,
oh my God,
I'm just swing by a billboard.com.</v>

409
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:53.360
Click on the podcast page,
then click on the Amazon link.

410
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.970
It'll just take you there.
It doesn't cost you any extra money.

411
00:23:55.971 --> 00:23:58.370
They give me credit for fucking drive and traffic there.

412
00:23:58.371 --> 00:24:02.450
They break me off a little bit.
I take 10% of that and send it to Saint Jude's.

413
00:24:02.451 --> 00:24:05.900
Speaking of which I owe those fuckers some money.
Um,

414
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:09.790
so anyways,
what was I going to talk?
What the fuck is he going to talk?
Oh,

415
00:24:09.791 --> 00:24:12.320
I know what I'm going to talk about.
You know,

416
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.960
every once in a while I always make fun of the yet that album,

417
00:24:14.961 --> 00:24:17.090
never mind from Nirvana.

418
00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:21.090
<v 0>I don't even make fun of the album cause it's a fucking killer album.</v>

419
00:24:21.091 --> 00:24:24.120
But I just make fun of how everybody pretends like they knew.

420
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.680
You know what I mean?
I knew the second I heard that album,

421
00:24:28.681 --> 00:24:30.900
I realize that rock music,

422
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:35.500
as we knew it had now changed forever and that,

423
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.150
that fucking uh,
Kurt Cobain documentary,

424
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.920
his mother,
his mother was going,
oh,
I was just like,

425
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.790
you better get ready because this album is going to change your life.

426
00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:52.820
Everybody fucking set gave fuck everybody know this is what kills me as much as

427
00:24:54.751 --> 00:24:58.680
they rubbed the balls of that album a year earlier.

428
00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:03.480
Jane's addiction put out that ritual,
ritual de la habitual,

429
00:25:03.481 --> 00:25:04.560
however the fuck you say it.

430
00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:06.100
<v 3>Okay,</v>

431
00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:11.050
<v 0>call me crazy.
But that album absolutely fucking smokes.</v>

432
00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:16.630
Nevermind.
Am I out of my mind and I'm not trying to cause a war.
He ever,

433
00:25:16.631 --> 00:25:20.950
teen Nevada had fucking Jane's addiction fans.

434
00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.660
All you 40 something year olds like me with your fucking worn out affliction tee

435
00:25:25.661 --> 00:25:29.320
shirts.
I'm not trying to cause a war here,
but am I outta my fucking mind?

436
00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.010
The fact that they put that album out when,
when the shit that was was,

437
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:40.000
I mean that was,
that was really the height,
the height of like somewhere,

438
00:25:40.001 --> 00:25:40.361
once,

439
00:25:40.361 --> 00:25:45.361
once when kip wingers band came out and she's only 17 was a hit and he was

440
00:25:47.801 --> 00:25:52.510
wearing like that Pastel fucking a tank top.

441
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.190
Maybe it wasn't pastel.
I don't know what,

442
00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.300
I know he had a beard like me and he had much better hair.

443
00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.180
So why am I shitting on him?
I'm just saying the shit that was out,

444
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:06.010
the fact that they put that thing out.
And then Perry Farrell,
his lyrics,

445
00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:08.770
his phrasing,
this shit didn't even rhyme.

446
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.140
One of my brothers absolutely loved that song.
Uh,
of course,

447
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.130
which I hated at first thought it sounded like a bunch of Gypsy horseshit and

448
00:26:20.131 --> 00:26:23.280
then it really listened to the lyrics and I really just got into it and it was

449
00:26:23.281 --> 00:26:27.540
bought your big brother holding your hands and making you slap your own face.

450
00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:31.150
And he equated it to how,
uh,
nature,

451
00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:35.790
how one animal's got to eat the other animal while it's admiring the beauty of

452
00:26:35.791 --> 00:26:39.510
the way it runs away.
All this deep fucking,
is there anything on fucking

453
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.860
a mosquito?
My luck paid.
Oh,

454
00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.970
oh,
well.
Whatever.
Nevermind.
I Dunno.

455
00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.440
It's like he took some seventh grade girl's diary.
Any fucking wrote it up.
Oh,

456
00:26:56.441 --> 00:27:00.640
I'm going to get shit for this one.
Um,
I just think that al I and also,
um,

457
00:27:00.641 --> 00:27:05.350
obviously I'm a huge fucking nirvana fan.
All right.
Um,
I'm just,
I'm just saying,

458
00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:10.000
let's give credit where credit is due and the drumming,
Stephen Perkins,

459
00:27:10.001 --> 00:27:12.520
drumming on that fucking album.

460
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:18.690
I don't even know where to begin
with the drum parts that,

461
00:27:18.691 --> 00:27:19.740
that guy came up with.

462
00:27:19.741 --> 00:27:24.741
They just did diff to fucking work of art from the beginning to the end.

463
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.160
My two favorite drum albums,
um,

464
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.420
of that period from about 87 to 1990,

465
00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.200
I love Stephen Adler's playing on appetite for destruction.

466
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.040
Just how you could pull out all the guitar,
all the base,

467
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:44.270
all the vocals and all that.
And even like,
uh,
uh,

468
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:49.300
basically somebody with very little musical background could listen to just the

469
00:27:49.651 --> 00:27:54.500
drum tracks and know what song he was playing too.
And that,

470
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.970
to me,
that's always such a killer.
Um,
that to me,

471
00:27:58.971 --> 00:28:02.150
that's always such a killer sign of an unbelievable drummer because you can

472
00:28:02.151 --> 00:28:04.580
basically play like the same little rock music.
I mean,

473
00:28:04.581 --> 00:28:07.430
you can play like four fucking pizza and get through a whole goddamn album.

474
00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.800
You know what I mean?
Which is also another art.
But like the guitar player,

475
00:28:12.801 --> 00:28:17.720
I can't play the same fucking chords and play the same chords,

476
00:28:17.721 --> 00:28:19.360
but he's got to switch it up,
is basically what I'm saying.

477
00:28:19.361 --> 00:28:22.280
He's got to write a new song,
you know what I mean?

478
00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:26.310
So this guys like John Bonham,
Steven Adler,
these guys,

479
00:28:26.311 --> 00:28:29.100
they come up with specific drum parts to fit the songs.

480
00:28:29.101 --> 00:28:32.460
I just think that it's on a whole other level.
And if you listen to the drumming,

481
00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:37.200
um,
like then she did that stuff on the ride cymbal.

482
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:40.930
And then how about any gets his high hat coming in and,
uh,

483
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.270
like he comes off the ride,

484
00:28:42.271 --> 00:28:45.700
I think with his right hand hits the snare while he opens the high hat,

485
00:28:45.701 --> 00:28:47.640
hitting it with his left hand.
That shit,

486
00:28:47.641 --> 00:28:51.840
I think he does that as he gets into like the,
the verse.
It's fucking incredible.

487
00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:53.623
Um,

488
00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:58.790
and I think even his drum and right through porno for Pyros when he got rid of

489
00:28:58.791 --> 00:28:59.440
all his toms,

490
00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:03.590
he and he had like those bongos and shit though that band fucking blew me away.

491
00:29:03.591 --> 00:29:05.810
Nobody thought they were weird and shit.
I fucking love them.

492
00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.460
Do you mind when they did that?
Uh,

493
00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:12.900
first time I saw them cause I was so fucking like they made that album and then

494
00:29:12.901 --> 00:29:17.430
they immediately broke up and I was fucking devastated because I was just like,

495
00:29:17.431 --> 00:29:21.300
these guys are the guys,
this is it.
What are they going to do next?

496
00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:24.660
And then they fucking break up and I'm,

497
00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:30.040
then Paris started that porno for Pyros,
if I remember correctly,

498
00:29:30.041 --> 00:29:34.720
he got that name watching the La Riots on TV,
everything burn out,
burn it down.

499
00:29:34.721 --> 00:29:37.840
He was like,
this is porno for Pyros,
this is like porno for pyros wherever.

500
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:38.860
And then that was the name of the band.

501
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:43.430
And the first time I saw them was on the Larry Sanders show where that was like

502
00:29:43.431 --> 00:29:47.870
a show within a show and they were the actual musical guests.
And um,

503
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:52.720
they came out and sang that song.
They had that killer fucking baseline.

504
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.680
Perry was on the fucking harmonica.
And then,
uh,
you know,

505
00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.470
Steven Parkwoods is playing this drum kit like I'd never seen before.
Uh,

506
00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.310
all I'm saying like book,
they look,
they're both fucking great albums,

507
00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:07.540
but I would,
uh,
I dunno,
I'd have to give the,

508
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:11.890
I guess Nirvana's because it was more popular I guess,
and sold more,

509
00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:15.790
did have more of a cultural effect bought.
Um,

510
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.550
I dunno do it that,
that fucking,
that ritual album is a,

511
00:30:21.551 --> 00:30:25.060
is a fucking monster.
I actually [inaudible] I was sick.
That album is,

512
00:30:25.061 --> 00:30:28.490
I actually learned how to meditate on the second half,

513
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:33.690
the second side of that album when I was still living at home with my parents 25

514
00:30:33.701 --> 00:30:36.880
fucking years ago.
I used to put on the second side of that album,

515
00:30:36.881 --> 00:30:40.960
which started off with three days and then it went into a,

516
00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.620
then she did,
I think it was the name of it.
And then of course,

517
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:48.190
and then classic girl.
And,
uh,

518
00:30:48.191 --> 00:30:51.630
I would just start meditating and,
um,

519
00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:55.360
I used to be so good at it to get that feeling where you feel like you leave in

520
00:30:55.361 --> 00:30:56.194
your body and like,

521
00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:02.790
like I would shut down everything and just concentrate on just paying attention

522
00:31:02.791 --> 00:31:04.860
to them.
When I was,
I was breathing my,
my diet,

523
00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:09.130
my stomach basically going up and down and you'd focus totally on that and I

524
00:31:09.131 --> 00:31:11.580
would be almost like looking down at it with my eyes shut.

525
00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.770
And then once I got to one point,

526
00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:17.670
then I would just sort of look up with my eyes closed or straight ahead and then

527
00:31:17.671 --> 00:31:21.210
I would just feel like I was floating and um,

528
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:22.710
<v 3>okay.</v>

529
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:26.370
<v 0>And it would always happen like right around this particular part in that song,</v>

530
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:32.000
right where he says true hunting's over.
I would start floating

531
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:34.670
and uh,

532
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.760
it was fucking amazing.

533
00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:43.020
I would just feel like I was floating as an asset that the apex of that song was

534
00:31:43.021 --> 00:31:47.330
building,
building was just whatever that Jesus,

535
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.820
Dannon and uh,
all the way to the end.
And then,

536
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.250
then she did came and really mellow.

537
00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.080
And then I'm just going to be,
I'd go all the way through classic girl.

538
00:31:59.081 --> 00:32:00.910
And then in the end you think it's the end of the album.

539
00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:05.280
And then there's like this little pause and then you hear Perry Farrell standing

540
00:32:05.281 --> 00:32:08.200
and of course is weird phrasing.
He just goes like,
good night,

541
00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:13.660
good night.
This is really weird fucking way.
And that would be it.

542
00:32:13.661 --> 00:32:18.220
I would just fucking pass out.
I did it every fucking night.
And um,

543
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:23.400
and then I lost the ability to do it because as I was starting to float,

544
00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.880
rather than just experiencing it,
I would start,
I was like,
oh good,
oh good.

545
00:32:27.881 --> 00:32:29.050
It's happening.
It's happening.

546
00:32:29.051 --> 00:32:32.320
And then I would get in my head and then I couldn't do it and then I'd get

547
00:32:32.321 --> 00:32:35.980
frustrated and uh,
I just fucking gave up on it.

548
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:42.020
But,
so if anybody has any suggestions on how to fucking get back into it,

549
00:32:42.021 --> 00:32:46.590
because I tried it again.
I bought some Jane's Addiction,
um,
albums,

550
00:32:46.591 --> 00:32:50.810
some bootleg live album,
not bootleg.
I mean I bought them at Amoeba,
but,
um,

551
00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:55.240
I don't know.
There's just something about that second side,
like the,
the,

552
00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:59.790
the guitar effects that Dave Navarro used and everything was just an amazing

553
00:32:59.791 --> 00:33:02.310
fucking album.
And,
uh,
you know,

554
00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:06.180
I don't think I could do that with a nirvana album and to have an album that you

555
00:33:06.181 --> 00:33:10.380
could actually fucking meditate too,
and it also fucking,
you know,

556
00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.860
it's still rocks to,
you know,
I don't know at this.
I think it's fucking killer.

557
00:33:14.861 --> 00:33:16.270
I'm just going on and on forever here.

558
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.740
So when you're talking about an album for 25 fucking years ago,
so anyways,

559
00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.200
um,
it's 33 minutes past the hour,
uh,
the phone store,

560
00:33:26.201 --> 00:33:28.870
Girl's story,
I left Yang and

561
00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:33.820
um,
I got,
uh,

562
00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.270
I got all the audio and I'm going to play it here and then we're going to do

563
00:33:37.271 --> 00:33:39.730
some classic Monday morning podcast stuff.

564
00:33:39.731 --> 00:33:42.400
I hope you guys have a great rest of the week.
If you try and lose weight,

565
00:33:42.401 --> 00:33:46.630
stick with it.
You know,
if you fuck up,
just get after it the next day.

566
00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:50.170
You know that you're in control.
And,
uh,
you know,

567
00:33:50.171 --> 00:33:55.030
if you've never listened to that ritual album,
I'm telling you,
just,
just fucking,

568
00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:58.930
just put it on this block out a nice fucking hour,
your life and just,
you know,

569
00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:01.210
at night when you got nobody calling,

570
00:34:01.211 --> 00:34:04.270
you shut off your phone and just pull it out.
Turn off the fucking lights.

571
00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:08.980
Light a candle,
you know,
have a drink,
smoked some weed or something.

572
00:34:08.981 --> 00:34:13.700
Put that fucking album on dude.
I'm telling you.
Telling you.
Um,

573
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:15.620
all right,
well maybe I'll do it if you want to.
I don't,

574
00:34:15.621 --> 00:34:19.100
I don't fucking tell you what you want it wouldn't,
you know who am I right?

575
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.730
You know Josh just got doing a podcast.
All right,
here we go.
Here's the phone,

576
00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:26.540
phone store.
A girl.
I can't even read.

577
00:34:26.541 --> 00:34:30.200
Phone store girl story that got cut off on the Monday morning podcast.

578
00:34:30.201 --> 00:34:34.910
You guys have a great weekend.
You can't.
Um,
all right.

579
00:34:34.911 --> 00:34:38.500
Phone store girl.
All right,

580
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:42.280
Billy boy.
Last week my girlfriend lent her cell phone.

581
00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:49.480
Oh,
what to you
last week my girl lent her cell phone because mine,
Shit,

582
00:34:49.481 --> 00:34:53.800
the bed.
You,
you missed a word there.
Lent me her cell phone.
Okay.

583
00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:57.700
I borrowed a phone on the way to get,
oh,
Jesus.
Oh God.
Here we go.

584
00:34:57.701 --> 00:35:01.340
I borrowed her phone and the way to get my new phone because I had some work

585
00:35:01.341 --> 00:35:03.310
calls to make as they left the house.

586
00:35:03.311 --> 00:35:07.360
I thought it was strange because it felt like,
because I,

587
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:09.560
it felt like we would be breaking up soon.

588
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:13.190
I get to the place and a young cute chick is working there.

589
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:18.490
I ended up getting paired with her over the other miserable looking losers

590
00:35:18.561 --> 00:35:20.960
working there.
Why?
I thought this has got to go another direction.

591
00:35:20.961 --> 00:35:23.570
I thought I'm going to say you went there and then she got some fucked up text.

592
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.070
All right.
Here we go.

593
00:35:25.071 --> 00:35:28.940
At one point I had to hand her my girlfriend's phone because I had taken a

594
00:35:28.941 --> 00:35:32.270
picture of a number.
I needed to activate my new phone.

595
00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:36.680
When the girl slid the pics slid the picture over by accident.
Yup.

596
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:39.960
You it a picture of my girlfriend topless.

597
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:43.560
The girls swipe back immediately and I just stood there.

598
00:35:43.561 --> 00:35:48.420
I actually didn't even really react much,
just kind of took it all in.

599
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.150
She looked at me and goes,
good for you.

600
00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:57.890
Oh Jesus.
This girl's a Gamer that broke the ice.
This girl was very cool.
Yeah.

601
00:35:57.891 --> 00:36:01.940
You think we joked around before and after the end,
after this incident.

602
00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:06.530
All right,
this is what you need to do.
Break up with this other girl immediately.

603
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:09.830
Cause you already said you feel like you're going to break up and you don't seem

604
00:36:09.831 --> 00:36:14.510
upset by which means you don't like this girl,
you know,
lover I should say.

605
00:36:14.511 --> 00:36:19.090
Or maybe you love her,
but not that way.
Dumper and get with this girl.
All right,

606
00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:24.350
let's see where this fucking goes.
And Paul back your heart though for a minute.

607
00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:27.990
This girl might be a fucking killer toe.
She might be a,
uh,

608
00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.160
a stud on the other side of the fence and she's going to fucking break your

609
00:36:31.161 --> 00:36:32.210
heart.
So just a,

610
00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:33.670
<v 3>okay,</v>

611
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:36.490
<v 0>see where it goes.
I'm already saying that before I get to the end of this.</v>

612
00:36:36.491 --> 00:36:37.480
Anyways,
he goes,

613
00:36:37.481 --> 00:36:40.510
I get in the car and I realized I haven't seen the picture of my girlfriend.

614
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:43.490
She never sent it to me pre.

615
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:46.490
Perhaps she didn't like it or perhaps it was for someone else.

616
00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:47.500
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

617
00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.030
<v 0>What the fuck just happened?</v>

618
00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:57.190
Wait a minute.
You guessed it.
A picture of my girlfriend topless.

619
00:36:57.191 --> 00:37:00.850
The girls swiped back immediately and I just stood there and took it all in.

620
00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:02.440
She said good for you.
That broke the ice.

621
00:37:02.441 --> 00:37:05.020
We kind of joked around before and after the citizens.

622
00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:07.930
I get in the car and I realized I haven't seen the picture of my girlfriend.

623
00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:11.260
She never sent it to me.
Oh cause it was on her phone.

624
00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:16.170
Oh wait.
She sent it to somebody else?

625
00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:16.930
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

626
00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:19.360
<v 0>Dude,
this is like a great movie for half.</v>

627
00:37:19.361 --> 00:37:22.600
She didn't like it or perhaps it was for someone else.
I think it was the latter.

628
00:37:22.601 --> 00:37:26.890
Of course it was because it was a good picture.
If that is in question,

629
00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:29.530
we can always refer to the phone store girls' reaction,

630
00:37:29.531 --> 00:37:31.240
which was pretty positive also.

631
00:37:31.241 --> 00:37:34.420
I sense this was happening anyways with this dude.
She knows,

632
00:37:34.421 --> 00:37:35.920
but that's a whole other story,
Dude.

633
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:38.980
Get the fuck out of that relationship and get with the phone girl.

634
00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:41.090
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

635
00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:45.070
<v 0>She seems like a happy,
open,
free spirit.
Uh,
as it would happen.</v>

636
00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:48.560
I have to go back to the store because the girl gave me the wrong charger at

637
00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:52.460
this didn't seem odd at first until I thought about how the iPhone section in

638
00:37:52.461 --> 00:37:54.800
the Samsung section on different sides of the store.

639
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:56.990
She walked over to the wrong side and grabbed it.

640
00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.080
I'm going back in a couple of days.
Mig,

641
00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.220
I may just tell the phone girl the whole story.

642
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:05.030
I realized that this was how my girlfriend was cheating on me or at least

643
00:38:05.031 --> 00:38:09.410
sending photos.
Thank you for the contribution to helping me know the truth.

644
00:38:09.411 --> 00:38:11.870
Thoughts.
Should I tell the story in a very casual way?

645
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.980
I'm pretty sure I can pull it off.
Why would you fucking bring up that shit?

646
00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:17.810
You should break up with the other girl.

647
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.750
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

648
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:22.360
<v 0>and just fucking ask the phone girl out.</v>

649
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:27.580
Save yourself all of that bullshit and just cut to this chase.
That woman at the,

650
00:38:27.581 --> 00:38:32.290
at the phone store
was looking at it like,
good for you man.

651
00:38:32.291 --> 00:38:35.260
Like you getting some ass.
That's how she said it.
She doesn't like it.

652
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:39.470
That's your girlfriend or whatever,
you know,

653
00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:44.210
break up with your girlfriend and get with this girl.
The other one,
uh,
you know,

654
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:49.240
she's fucking cheating on you,
dude.
If I had to guess,
would you say,
oh yeah,

655
00:38:49.241 --> 00:38:53.140
that's right.
I took a topless photo and I forgot to send it to you and deleted.

656
00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:58.230
Oh,
Jesus.
Yeah.
That's what I would do.
I mean,
look,

657
00:38:59.010 --> 00:38:59.520
<v 3>okay.</v>

658
00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.850
<v 0>I don't know,
like what the vibe was when you talked to him.</v>

659
00:39:01.851 --> 00:39:04.740
Maybe you feel you have to tell the story,
but my gut says don't do that.

660
00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:09.000
Break up with her and don't tell the fucking story to the phone chick and have

661
00:39:09.001 --> 00:39:13.590
yourself a wonderful rest of the summer because that sounds like something what

662
00:39:13.591 --> 00:39:14.840
fucking guy wouldn't want to pull.

663
00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:18.180
Who wouldn't want to be with a woman like that?
Good for you,

664
00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:24.000
Jesus Christ.
What a fucking chip.
Um,
anyways,

665
00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.690
that's the podcast for this week.
Um,

666
00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:31.260
please get the word out about my MSG show.
If you could.

667
00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.200
Madison Square Garden for those of you who,
uh,

668
00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:39.090
I dunno who walked into the room later.
Um,
sometimes I feel like this is radio.

669
00:39:39.091 --> 00:39:41.690
Then I'm like,
no,
he isn't radio.
They listen to the whole fucking thing bill.
Um,

670
00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.600
yeah.
Cause obviously I've got to sell a ton of tickets and um,

671
00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.670
yeah,
I don't want to be standing on stage alone that night.
But uh,
once again,

672
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.950
seriously guys,
thank you for everybody.
All the years

673
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:56.420
<v 4>you guys have been coming out to my shows and uh,
you know,</v>

674
00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.780
and the repeat customers,
which always makes me,
you know,

675
00:39:59.781 --> 00:40:04.410
write new jokes on a regular basis,
which is fucking awesome.
So,
uh,

676
00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.920
which gets me more fans and it all feeds at the ones on TV to the others.

677
00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:13.010
I don't say that.
Alright,
that's a podcast for this week.
Go fuck yourselves up.

678
00:40:13.011 --> 00:40:16.190
Check in on you on Thursday.
All right.
See,

679
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.890
<v 0>I was one of those times was just like,
you know what,</v>

680
00:40:52.891 --> 00:40:54.600
there's not enough light thing in the world.

681
00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:59.060
<v 4>No.
Just as far as the odds of being struck by lightning.</v>

682
00:40:59.061 --> 00:41:03.320
We need to bring that average up because the amount of fucking morons out there

683
00:41:03.321 --> 00:41:06.950
versus actually intelligent people,
you got to hit a fucking moron,

684
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:11.830
you know basically going to hit a moron or are you going to hit the ocean?
Does,

685
00:41:11.831 --> 00:41:14.090
is it going to be the top two in that order?

686
00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:15.410
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

687
00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:18.170
<v 4>Even all the fucking world is three quarters fucking water.</v>

688
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:23.240
You still got a higher chance as lightning to fucking hit a moron.
That's that.

689
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:24.110
That's,
I'm telling you.

690
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:27.140
That's my goddamn theory and that's what I want the new staff to be.

691
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:28.530
<v 3>Okay.</v>

692
00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:30.030
<v 4>Rather than being like,
you know,</v>

693
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:33.780
the odds of getting hit by lightning or higher of blah,
blah,
blah.

694
00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:37.110
I want it to turn into,
I want so much lightening that,
that,

695
00:41:37.111 --> 00:41:41.790
that the new stat is the odds of an intelligent person actually being hit by

696
00:41:41.791 --> 00:41:43.110
lightening are x,
y,
and Z.

697
00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:47.550
Do you like how in my own little style and that squirrels that I'm actually

698
00:41:47.551 --> 00:41:50.990
intelligent and everybody else is just a sea of morons?
Huh?

699
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:54.360
You don't have thoughts like that.
Murderous thoughts.

700
00:41:56.070 --> 00:42:01.070
I was actually talking to this broad up in San Francisco and um,

701
00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.433
<v 2>yeah,</v>

702
00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:10.000
<v 4>I got this whole chunk about hitting women that I've been doing on stage and uh,</v>

703
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:14.000
it's actually something embarrassing I have to admit about myself as much as I

704
00:42:14.001 --> 00:42:15.950
do the,
the comedy thing for a living.

705
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:20.000
I'm really bad at picking up on sarcasm.

706
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:26.180
I don't know why I use sarcasm.
I'm sarcastic,
right?

707
00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:32.420
But for some reason when someone uses it against me,
I,

708
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:35.090
I've just like that old guy downstairs.

709
00:42:35.091 --> 00:42:38.870
But if I told you that shit last year when I was dragging my Christmas tree down

710
00:42:38.871 --> 00:42:41.930
the stairs and he stuck his head out the window and he just goes,

711
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.180
beautiful morning,
isn't it?

712
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.770
And he had this fucked up look on his face,
but he said,
beautiful morning,

713
00:42:48.771 --> 00:42:53.630
isn't it?
So I was confused and I just went,
yeah,
yeah,
it is a beautiful morning.

714
00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:56.600
And I'm thinking,
why is he yelling with that,
twist it up,
look in his face.

715
00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:00.260
And then I walked around the corner.
It's like,
oh,
he didn't mean it.

716
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:05.110
What he really meant was she making a lot of fucking noise ruining this

717
00:43:05.111 --> 00:43:09.370
beautiful morning.
So he got me.
Then I always end up feeling stupid,
so you know,

718
00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:13.840
I'm doing this whole chunk on hitting the broads over there and I'm standing

719
00:43:13.841 --> 00:43:18.040
afterwards whoring myself out,
right.
Sell on my DVD,

720
00:43:18.041 --> 00:43:20.200
showed a little bit of leg doing what I gotta do.

721
00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:24.010
This fucking woman is walking out in,

722
00:43:24.011 --> 00:43:28.690
her husband has sort of shuffling her out and she starts going,

723
00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:33.490
uh
oh she has,
she,
she has is once again the twist it up,

724
00:43:33.491 --> 00:43:36.940
look on her face.
She goes,
thanks for the domestic violence jokes.

725
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:40.780
I really appreciated it.
I really appreciated the domestic violence.

726
00:43:40.781 --> 00:43:44.380
Jux thanks a lot for the domestic violence jokes.
That's what she was doing.

727
00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:49.750
And because she was saying thanks,
it just,
it went totally past my head.

728
00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:53.530
I was more just confused by her facial expression.
So she said,
yeah,

729
00:43:53.531 --> 00:43:57.830
I really appreciate it.
Thanks a lot.
I'm literally just waving gone.
Alright,

730
00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:59.350
glad you enjoyed the show.

731
00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.030
Which is funny because it probably pissed her off more,

732
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:08.740
but I was sincerely thanking her completely missing her sarcasm.

733
00:44:08.741 --> 00:44:12.370
What she was really saying was ivy that dealt with that personally or that's

734
00:44:12.371 --> 00:44:16.630
happening to somebody right now or has happened to someone or it grew up with it

735
00:44:16.631 --> 00:44:20.260
or whatever,
and you brought up bad memories and you ruined my fucking evening.

736
00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:23.680
That's what she was really sorry.
But of course I took it at face value,

737
00:44:23.681 --> 00:44:25.000
which actually when I look back on it,

738
00:44:25.001 --> 00:44:29.530
I think makes it even funnier because who's Kevin who she already thinks I'm a

739
00:44:29.531 --> 00:44:32.070
fucking moron at that point,
you know?

740
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:38.270
So it would actually would have made her a little bit happier if I tried to

741
00:44:38.911 --> 00:44:39.990
appear intelligent.

742
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:43.180
<v 5>It's like actually a,
you missed the point of the geocode.</v>

743
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:47.180
It was really trying to do is expose the hypocrisy of us,

744
00:44:47.181 --> 00:44:50.010
some of the relationships between the male and female sex.

745
00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:53.070
<v 4>If I went that route,
you know,</v>

746
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.440
then she could have gotten this hot.

747
00:44:55.441 --> 00:44:59.850
But the fact that I literally was the moron that she thought I was,

748
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:02.430
<v 1>and then yeah,
there was this whole line of people,</v>

749
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:06.090
you don't want to just realize I should be struck by lightening.

750
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:09.330
What the fuck is wrong with me?
I'm one of those fucking morons.

751
00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:16.953
So

752
00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.870
conversation

753
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:49.503
basis.

754
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:56.970
<v 4>All right,
question bill.
Being a frequent flyer.</v>

755
00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:02.780
Don't you think this controversy over the new body scanners is fucking bullshit?

756
00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:07.410
A guy hit a bomb in his fucking underwear.

757
00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:12.560
What exactly do these complaining bastards expect us to scale back on security?

758
00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:18.620
We have become so pampered and use to the utmost comfort that we are doing the

759
00:46:19.261 --> 00:46:20.880
terrorist's job for them.

760
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:24.720
Who gives a fuck if someone is seeing your cock or your tits?

761
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.190
He or she is seeing hundreds a day.
Uh,
you sir,

762
00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:33.900
are a fucking moron.
All right?
If you go through airport security,

763
00:46:33.901 --> 00:46:35.160
I don't know if you've noticed.

764
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:39.510
They're not exactly the fucking navy seals,

765
00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.480
although they have gotten better in the last couple of years,
but they don't,

766
00:46:42.481 --> 00:46:45.930
you know,
they're always shooting the shit.
They're always fucking around.

767
00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:48.720
They're not really paying attention.

768
00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:52.230
It doesn't really look like it's a high paying fucking job.
All right,

769
00:46:52.231 --> 00:46:56.670
let's go with that.
All right,
let's go with secondly,
uh,
a body scanner,

770
00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:57.840
entire body scale.

771
00:46:57.841 --> 00:47:01.260
Let's get over the fact that you don't want a naked picture of yourself,

772
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:06.090
which is,
you're fucking right to not want that,
by the way.
All right?

773
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.280
Secondly,
I don't know about you,

774
00:47:08.281 --> 00:47:12.060
but I fly every other weekend and when I go on benders like this at the end of

775
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.280
the year,
cause I owe the bank,
are concerned,
the fucking government,

776
00:47:14.281 --> 00:47:18.540
a bunch of money.
I go on like,
you know,
four or five weeks in a row,
I fly.

777
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:23.160
All right?
So I got to get up full bond,
body scan,

778
00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:26.790
uh,
on the way out and the way back.

779
00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:30.381
You know,

780
00:47:30.381 --> 00:47:33.440
I really have to start checking to see that I'm not going to be completely

781
00:47:33.441 --> 00:47:37.430
filled up with memory on this fucking Olympus ls 10.

782
00:47:37.431 --> 00:47:39.710
They have the God damn time right there.
I apologize.

783
00:47:39.711 --> 00:47:43.100
Let me get back to what the fuck I was talking about.
Um,

784
00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:45.520
yeah,
so,

785
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:49.060
so you're basically saying that I shouldn't complain that like six weeks in a

786
00:47:49.061 --> 00:47:54.061
fucking row and a total of 12 times I'm going to take radiation from head to

787
00:47:55.391 --> 00:47:59.140
fucking toe.
All right?
And don't even tell me,
oh,

788
00:47:59.141 --> 00:48:03.550
it's only for fucking second to when you go to get your fucking,
you know,

789
00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:08.440
teeth x-rayed.
They put that leather fucking,

790
00:48:08.441 --> 00:48:12.400
that led vest leather,
that led vest over all your fucking Oregon's.

791
00:48:12.401 --> 00:48:16.540
And then they go lay leave the fucking room.
And I'm supposed to stand there.

792
00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:21.340
Like I met a Jay z concert and I'm getting frisk at the same time with my

793
00:48:21.341 --> 00:48:25.090
fucking legs spread and doing that Jay z thing over my head.

794
00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:29.410
And they're going to know,
fuck that this cancer in my family.
I'm not doing it.

795
00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:33.280
I'm not doing it.
Pat me down.
So that's why I did the one on the,
on the way out.

796
00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:37.450
I was like,
yeah,
I'm not doing that thing.
And I said to pat me down.

797
00:48:37.451 --> 00:48:41.770
So then you know,
they did it and they said they came up to me and this guy said,

798
00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:46.360
I have to pat you down.
Uh,
are there any parts of your body that are,
that are,

799
00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:50.170
that are sensitive?
And I wanted to be like,
well,

800
00:48:50.171 --> 00:48:53.050
I'm think all of us have areas of our bodies that are sensitive

801
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:59.170
just to creep them out.
That was basically like,
no,
God grabbed my balls.

802
00:48:59.171 --> 00:49:02.320
I don't give a fuck.
Right.
I didn't know what he was going to do.
Right.

803
00:49:02.321 --> 00:49:06.460
So he's puts on his dishwashing gloves and starts patting me down and they don't

804
00:49:06.461 --> 00:49:07.211
grab your balls.

805
00:49:07.211 --> 00:49:12.130
What they do is they go way up your inner thigh and he gives you your ball bag.

806
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:16.420
A little bit of a backhand on each side of the ball bag,
you know?
So,

807
00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:21.700
and I got to admit,
it made me laugh a little bit.
Yeah.

808
00:49:21.701 --> 00:49:24.250
I don't give a fuck.
Yeah,
go fuck yourself.
Yeah.

809
00:49:24.251 --> 00:49:27.910
You're not taking a fucking head to toe naked fucking picture of me as you,

810
00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:32.230
you know you're not,
you're not fucking radiate in my entire body,

811
00:49:32.231 --> 00:49:35.560
so I can get on a fucking puddle jumper to go to Hartford.
I'm not doing that.

812
00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:39.340
Go Fuck Yourself.
Jesus Christ,

813
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:44.610
lazy motherfuckers.
You know

814
00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.990
what,
what people forget.
I just don't,
I don't get it.
You know what I mean?

815
00:49:48.991 --> 00:49:50.880
This is this,
I understand that they're,
you know,

816
00:49:50.881 --> 00:49:53.430
quote unquote trying to keep me safe.

817
00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:56.430
But what I don't understand is that people don't understand that during those

818
00:49:56.431 --> 00:49:59.700
times of fear,
and let's try to keep you safe.

819
00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:04.910
The amount of fucking like privileged that you lose and you never fucking get it

820
00:50:05.791 --> 00:50:09.510
back.
And they always take a little more than they should.

821
00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.690
That's why it's great that people bitch.

822
00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:16.350
And it's great that you can bitch because if you bitched like this in China,

823
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:19.770
they'd probably put you to death and then harvest.
You're fucking Oregon's.

824
00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:22.380
All right.
So yeah,

825
00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:26.310
I think it's fine with the amount of fucking cancer that's out there and that

826
00:50:26.311 --> 00:50:29.150
people fucking talk on their cell phones all the God damn time.

827
00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:30.980
You don't want to end it.
You know,

828
00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:35.780
you don't want to add to it with a head to toe fucking Zappa,
fucking radiation.

829
00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.410
You know,
I'm standing there,
I don't have my fucking shoes on.

830
00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:45.180
I'm stripped down to a fucking tee shirt.
I got jeans on and Shit.

831
00:50:45.181 --> 00:50:46.410
I don't have anything on me,

832
00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:48.713
<v 2>you know?</v>

833
00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.290
<v 4>And there's all this fucking flipping out about the fucking airplanes.</v>

834
00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:53.790
What about trains?

835
00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:58.500
You could literally have a box that said,

836
00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:00.540
I have dynamite on the side of it.

837
00:51:00.541 --> 00:51:03.390
And you could see the fucking conductor would help you carry it on.

838
00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:06.060
There's no metal detectors.
There's no nothing.

839
00:51:06.061 --> 00:51:08.130
Despite the fact that 15 years ago,

840
00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:11.790
that guy got on the long island railroad railroad and shut the shut the whole

841
00:51:11.791 --> 00:51:15.210
fucking thing up.
So I don't like that.

842
00:51:15.211 --> 00:51:19.860
I don't like that whole fucking ice skate scan my retina shit.
No,

843
00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:24.300
go fuck yourself.
I'm not doing that.
And um,
it's,
you're right dude,

844
00:51:24.301 --> 00:51:26.100
if you have no problem with it,
you know,

845
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000
good luck with your testicular slash brain slash tongue slash throat slash big

846
00:51:33.421 --> 00:51:37.170
toe cancer if you fly all the fucking time.
Like a lot of people,

847
00:51:37.171 --> 00:51:40.710
I'm not doing that shit.
I'm not fucking doing that.
That's a,

848
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:45.510
they have fucked dead,
you know,

849
00:51:45.511 --> 00:51:48.280
and you're acting like before this shit went down,

850
00:51:48.281 --> 00:51:49.900
they haven't been keeping us safe.

851
00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:52.173
<v 2>You know,</v>

852
00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.790
<v 4>they have been says nine 11.
Knock on wood,</v>

853
00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.430
nothing has fucking happened before.

854
00:51:59.431 --> 00:52:04.380
Those stupid body scan is nothing has fucking happened.
All right,
we're fine.

855
00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:08.100
Everything is fucking fine.
You don't need those goddamn things.

856
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:12.960
You know what's funny is if next week somebody actually does something that

857
00:52:12.961 --> 00:52:17.310
conspiracy theorists are going to say that the government did it because people

858
00:52:17.311 --> 00:52:22.170
were refusing those body scanners.
All right?
That's just my opinion,

859
00:52:22.171 --> 00:52:26.550
man.
I seriously,
you know,
I'm not trying to get head to toe radiation.

860
00:52:26.551 --> 00:52:30.750
I get that they're trying to fucking keep me safe,
but you know,

861
00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:33.300
if they truly wanted to keep me fucking safe,

862
00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:36.930
they wouldn't be shooting the shit and joking the amount of fucking times that

863
00:52:36.931 --> 00:52:41.400
they are when I'm going through.
All right,
and that happens a lot.

864
00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:42.390
Specifically,

865
00:52:42.391 --> 00:52:46.860
it's the person who's looking at the TV screen is talking about whatever and his

866
00:52:46.861 --> 00:52:47.940
joking and laughing,

867
00:52:47.941 --> 00:52:52.470
which you're going to do because they have an unbelievably boring fucking job.

868
00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:56.250
I would be doing the same goddamn thing,
but if they truly gave a fuck,

869
00:52:58.090 --> 00:53:02.350
they would spend a lot more money on the people that they get to do the security

870
00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:06.950
rather than these new fangled fucking
God damn machines.

871
00:53:06.951 --> 00:53:11.600
I'm not going through those.
Pat me Down,
give,
give my fucking my ball bag.

872
00:53:11.601 --> 00:53:15.290
A couple of backhands with the dishwashing gloves.
I don't give a fuck,

873
00:53:15.291 --> 00:53:16.490
but I'm not going to stand there.

874
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:19.670
Spread Eagle and end up with cancer or the taint.

875
00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:25.040
All right.
But you know,
you guys want to do it.
Go ahead and do,

876
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:25.963
I don't give a fuck,

877
00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.770
but I hope enough of you say no so it doesn't become mandatory.

878
00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:32.133
<v 6>All right.</v>

879
00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:07.523
Hey Bill,

880
00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:10.120
<v 4>I just finished watching last night,</v>

881
00:54:10.121 --> 00:54:14.860
Saturday night live with Paul Mccartney and I think it's time for Paul to hang

882
00:54:14.861 --> 00:54:15.880
it up for good.

883
00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:21.220
I feel like a bit of an asshole for thinking it because we're all supposed to be

884
00:54:21.221 --> 00:54:23.710
in awe of him because he's a Beta.
Uh,

885
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:28.510
they let them do four songs last night because everyone is in awe of him and

886
00:54:28.511 --> 00:54:29.380
that's the problem.

887
00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:34.830
No one wants to tell the 68 year old man with the dyed brown hair and saggy man

888
00:54:35.051 --> 00:54:38.740
boobs that he doesn't have the voice for a live performance anymore.

889
00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:43.060
I fear getting old and being irrelevant too.

890
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:45.970
But I hope that when it's my time to retire,

891
00:54:45.971 --> 00:54:50.971
I can accept that I'm not what I once was and move on to something else that

892
00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:55.720
better suits that stage of my life.
Paul should look to someone like Bano.

893
00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:57.610
Not that I'm a big Bono Fan,

894
00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:02.740
but I think he's done it right by imitating Bob Geldof's example of rock and

895
00:55:02.741 --> 00:55:04.030
roll for philanthropy.

896
00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:07.810
How about a pat on the back for getting through that sentence without fucking it

897
00:55:07.811 --> 00:55:12.730
up.
Uh,
you two won't dress stadium sized crowds forever.
So Bonno set,

898
00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.720
set himself up as a jet setting friend of the world's poor.

899
00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:21.070
Even if he never gave another concert of sung another note,

900
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:25.060
he'd still have a meaningful,
he'll still have meaningful work beyond his music.

901
00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:28.730
Uh,
it's like you were saying in previous podcasts,

902
00:55:28.731 --> 00:55:32.200
it's good to have a side business in case show business doesn't work out best

903
00:55:32.201 --> 00:55:35.990
regards.
Um,
yeah.
Um,

904
00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:39.310
I kind of see what you say and a little bit,
but,
uh,

905
00:55:39.311 --> 00:55:42.400
I know a lot of people saw Paul Mccartney last year on tour and said he was

906
00:55:42.401 --> 00:55:43.420
fucking unbelievable.

907
00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:48.810
And then I also think that the Beatles right now are a victim of a backlash

908
00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:53.950
because of something that they didn't create.
I think apple,

909
00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:58.630
not apple,
is that,
uh,
whatever iTunes.
That's right.
Itunes.

910
00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:03.160
I got real confused there because they had apple records and then Macintosh has

911
00:56:03.161 --> 00:56:06.970
a fucking apple and that's all it takes to really just send me flying down the

912
00:56:06.971 --> 00:56:11.710
fucking sidelines.
Like that.
Dreadlocked son of a bitch.
You got tripped anyways.

913
00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:12.713
Um,

914
00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:17.140
I think iTunes has been trying to get the Beatles catalog.

915
00:56:17.170 --> 00:56:20.980
Obviously it's probably the first band you would want to start with as far as if

916
00:56:20.981 --> 00:56:23.140
you wanted to make money.
They finally got,

917
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:26.380
and they are from the baby boom generation,

918
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:31.450
Steve jobs and all those guys.
So this is,
you know,
this is there Jesus.

919
00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:37.080
So they present the band as their Jesus and just eventually it's just inevitable

920
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:39.380
that it's going to,
uh,

921
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:44.860
annoy the generations after.
And not to mention,

922
00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:48.700
because we weren't born when they were putting out albums,

923
00:56:48.701 --> 00:56:53.200
it's impossible for us to see how far ahead of their fucking time they were,

924
00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:54.670
you know?

925
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:57.700
And that's something I also see in comedy where I've actually gotten emails from

926
00:56:57.701 --> 00:57:01.510
people going,
what's the big deal with Richard Pryor?
You know,

927
00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:05.620
35 years of people ripping off his shit.

928
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:10.720
They've actually made
some of his stuff,

929
00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:15.400
you know,
like after 35 years,
people finally caught up with them,

930
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:18.510
you know,
so it was,

931
00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:22.390
the Beatles was so fucking far ahead of everybody,

932
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:27.130
but now it's,
it's 40,
almost 50 fucking years later.
Yeah.

933
00:57:27.131 --> 00:57:29.500
Now you're going to look back on it and have to,
everybody's ripped him off.

934
00:57:29.501 --> 00:57:34.210
It can be like,
dude,
what the fuck was the big deal?
All right,
so there's that.

935
00:57:34.211 --> 00:57:38.950
And then the last thing is I'm sick of people throwing old people out in the

936
00:57:38.951 --> 00:57:43.810
fucking yard.
You know,
like they're your old iPod speakers.
Eh,

937
00:57:43.811 --> 00:57:48.640
there's a loose wire.
Fuck him.
He's out the God damn door.
I think it's bullshit.

938
00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:54.520
All right.
I like old people.
Even that fucking asshole downstairs.

939
00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:58.570
I like them.
I respect them.
And,
uh,
you,
you,
what it is,

940
00:57:58.571 --> 00:58:02.890
is you look at them and you see that died here and you see their saggy man boobs

941
00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:06.520
right here,
wrinkled up tushies.
Right?

942
00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:11.550
So you equate that with their level of intelligence rather than this fucking guy

943
00:58:13.391 --> 00:58:18.370
has walked this planet for 65,
75,
85 fucking years.

944
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:23.590
And uh,
you know,
what's that expression?
Bunch of things change.

945
00:58:23.591 --> 00:58:26.630
They stay the same stitch in time,
saves nine,
whatever the fucking hammer,

946
00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:29.680
remember expressions,
whatever.
You know,

947
00:58:30.130 --> 00:58:32.740
this guy has seen everything that you're about ready to see.

948
00:58:32.741 --> 00:58:36.460
He's already seen it,
okay?
He didn't have a fucking iPod.
Who gives a fuck?

949
00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:39.870
All right?
A cunt is still a cunt.
All right?

950
00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:42.790
Some things don't fucking change.

951
00:58:42.791 --> 00:58:45.700
And this guy has this whole wealth of knowledge that here's a guy who's been

952
00:58:45.701 --> 00:58:49.810
playing live gigs for 50 something fucking years,
all right?

953
00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:52.840
He can still physically play.
Why wouldn't you want to go see him?

954
00:58:54.370 --> 00:58:59.170
You know,
with all his fucking experience,
you know?
Yeah.
I mean,

955
00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:01.330
I could see if he was jumping off the piano,

956
00:59:01.331 --> 00:59:03.700
trying to do splits and touch his fucking toes.

957
00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:07.360
And then he came down and blew out his knee and they had to give him fucking a

958
00:59:07.361 --> 00:59:11.770
Geritol rub right on is blown out neat then.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

959
00:59:12.310 --> 00:59:16.390
But like I don't like that whole fucking,
it's like a corporate mentality.

960
00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:20.980
I your skin's wrinkled up.
We have no,
you,
we don't like looking at you beat.

961
00:59:23.350 --> 00:59:28.330
<v 0>I Dunno,
I'd still go pay to see the rolling stones.
I would.</v>

962
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:31.210
Why wouldn't you?
Why the fuck would those guys,

963
00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:35.740
those guys give me hope that I could sit there and drag my ass out on a fucking

964
00:59:35.741 --> 00:59:37.270
stage.
80 years old.

965
00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:40.550
<v 4>What's up with Medicaid,
you know,</v>

966
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:44.240
out on a cruise ship.

967
00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:47.510
But I do understand what you're saying because I definitely want to,
uh,

968
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:52.670
<v 0>if I'm on stage
in my sixties,</v>

969
00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:53.873
<v 4>in 70s,</v>

970
00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:58.200
sixties is fine cause I'm still going to be fucking annoyed and want to be out

971
00:59:58.201 --> 01:00:01.200
there.
But in my seventies,
if I'm still on fucking stage,

972
01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:05.120
I want it to be because uh,

973
01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:08.370
because I'm not because I need the money because I want to be out there.

974
01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:12.210
All right.
I remember Keith Richard's saying like,
someone was like,

975
01:00:12.211 --> 01:00:14.430
when are you guys gonna hang it up?
He's like,
never.

976
01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:15.570
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

977
01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:17.280
<v 4>I'm a musician.
This is what I do.</v>

978
01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:21.930
I will do this in front of two people or 200,000.
It's what the fuck I do.

979
01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.490
You want me to put down my guitar?

980
01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:24.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

981
01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:25.270
<v 4>You know,</v>

982
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:28.630
he has a great line in his book where he talks about how much he loves guitar.

983
01:00:28.631 --> 01:00:31.510
I don't know if I said this last week at Keith just has this book called life.

984
01:00:31.511 --> 01:00:34.260
It's the fucking shit.
And um,

985
01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:39.430
he talks about how he loves guitar.
So much debt to this day.

986
01:00:39.431 --> 01:00:43.030
Like he opens a guitar case and just the smell of a guitar,

987
01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:46.840
he wants to crawl in there and close the lid.
All right?

988
01:00:46.841 --> 01:00:50.260
So if you ask this guy to stop going up playing live,

989
01:00:50.261 --> 01:00:52.780
you might as well put a bullet in his brain.
You're killing them in.

990
01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:57.890
<v 0>Okay.
So having said that,
let Paul Mccartney do is fucking thing.</v>

991
01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:00.540
Has any been through enough?
I mean,

992
01:01:00.541 --> 01:01:04.250
that guy truly found the love of his life.
All right,

993
01:01:04.251 --> 01:01:07.850
you fucking dies then.
He,
he's in a bad place,

994
01:01:07.851 --> 01:01:11.690
like the fucking jets strength coach.
He goes out,

995
01:01:11.691 --> 01:01:14.870
he married some gold digging whore with one leg,
you know,

996
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:18.260
which was the classic fucking Miss Direction.

997
01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:21.120
Cause I bet in the back of his head he kept going,
you know,

998
01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:25.030
I think she's a fucking gold digger.
And then that other place,
it's like,
dude,

999
01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.800
she only has one leg man stuff,
so me.
Right.
And then he just

1000
01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:30.430
<v 6>gave into that.</v>
