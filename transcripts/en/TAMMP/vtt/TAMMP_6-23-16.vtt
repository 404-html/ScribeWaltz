00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.900
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.901 --> 00:00:08.890
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and Ah,

3
00:00:08.891 --> 00:00:13.390
I'm just checking in on you and your cubicle.

4
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.920
Do you like that?
It's in the corner and you get some sun.

5
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.600
I like it.
It makes me feel like I'm outside.
Do you know what I mean?

6
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.050
Do you remember when you had [inaudible] and he just ran and he just had the

7
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.270
wind was in your hair.

8
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:33.271
That's what it feels like except them inside in my dream thief died.

9
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.280
What's going on guys?
My voice is fucked up.
And uh,
it's Wednesday night.

10
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.000
I just got out of the writer's room,
episode eight motherfuckers doing the table.

11
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.910
Read fucking Mazda with it.
Fuck to these fucking things.

12
00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:49.460
Come from Jesus fucking Christ.

13
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.220
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

14
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.450
<v 1>it's fucking Moss.
It's fucking house.</v>

15
00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:57.310
Do you know the fuck another day?
My God.
Damn.

16
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.840
I get a fucking decent gate for the driveway for once.
You know,

17
00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:03.280
you got to get the electrical one.

18
00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:06.340
You know what's great about the electrical one is eventually it fucking breaks

19
00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:08.860
and you can't get your car out of there and you got to call a taxi.

20
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.640
When you're paying insurance on two fucking cars,
all,
oh,
they're right there.

21
00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:16.480
You just can't get to them.
Isn't technology wonderful?

22
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.440
It makes your life so much more simple.
Um,
you know,

23
00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:22.540
you don't have to get out of a car anymore to open a gate.

24
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.830
You don't burn those calories.

25
00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:26.740
And then those calories just sit right on your fucking heart,
right?

26
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.940
And then one day,

27
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.920
one day the gate doesn't open and you have a fucking aneurysm because you so

28
00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:35.080
upset because it was supposed to make your life easier.

29
00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:38.650
And it doesn't actually have a fucking theory.
Uh,
I don't have a theory.

30
00:01:38.651 --> 00:01:40.690
I have a fucking idea that just popped into my head.

31
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.310
We should all die at like 30 of natural fucking causes.
You know,

32
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.150
we should just go back to living off the fucking land once,

33
00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:52.150
just the whole plague just hits everybody.
We should just,
you know,

34
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.780
go back to being fucking cave people and live in like,
you know,

35
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.380
it's live in like 30 fucking Ya.

36
00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:02.070
You can't go that far back would be a good place to go back to.

37
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.780
You know what I mean?
Well,

38
00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:07.720
anybody in this era would suck because then there'd be a bunch of shit and be

39
00:02:07.721 --> 00:02:12.490
like,
what does no iPads or polio vaccines,
man,
what the fuck?
This sucks.
Right?

40
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.780
You know?
I don't know.
It's not a theory.
It was just a fucking idea.
I mean,

41
00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:20.800
and this is how Trump gives a speech,
isn't it?
Is he going down?

42
00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:22.420
Is that what's happening in this fucking guy?

43
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.890
Just took everybody until this fucking moment.
Now I,
for the life of me,

44
00:02:26.891 --> 00:02:30.040
I do not understand how this,
this is my fucking republican choice.

45
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.010
I got this fucking dope or this,

46
00:02:33.011 --> 00:02:36.640
this fucking square headed God damn criminal.

47
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.930
What does Hillary Clinton have?
Like what?
52 felonies pending?

48
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.360
I think I saw her on the first 48 the other night

49
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.280
and how they're just going to just blow past all of this.

50
00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:54.280
And then you got to listen to all this fucking horse shit about,
you know,

51
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.350
how great it is for fucking women.

52
00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.610
Well it's only fair after all the guys that have got an office,

53
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:03.970
why don't we get the most crooked,
fucking broad we can find,
you know,

54
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:08.830
don't pick the honest one.
Um,
oh Jesus.

55
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.980
I'm going to grumpy fucking mood.
Um,

56
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.950
there's so much shit that I want to say,
but I can't say it.

57
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.390
I just can't fucking say it.
Uh,
cause it would be a waste to say it right here,

58
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:23.860
but I am buying my time biting you.
Or is it buying is a Joe Biden.

59
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.220
How to fuck these.
I know the,
how they explain this one of those expressions.

60
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:30.370
I've a,
every time I hear somebody say it in a bar,
it's like,

61
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:34.830
did they say buying or I'm biding my time
or is it just you?

62
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.710
Another thing that one of my relatives mispronounced and then I just started

63
00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:41.220
saying it that way.
Like my fucking,
what am I?

64
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:44.010
Relatives could not say orange used to say orange.

65
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.420
You want an orange so you know he fucking go to school.
What color is that?

66
00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:52.530
I'm like orange.
And people would look at me like,
what did you say?
Orange.

67
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.060
And they're going,
it's orange.
Say all right.
You know,
I didn't know.

68
00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.780
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.210
<v 1>People around where I live say orange.
Um,</v>

70
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.420
the fuck was I talking about biting

71
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.010
my time is,
is that a word?

72
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.190
Is that something biding my time.
Well that's a pink Floyd song biding time.

73
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.170
Uh,
biding my time.
Can you believe there's something on Wikipedia about that?

74
00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:21.240
Well,
there's people like you in the world,
Bill.
So there needs to be

75
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.810
biding my time was an unreleased.
Recording isn't an excuse,
isn't an expression.

76
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.560
The sea,
once you guys are hearing right now is how I use the fucking camera.

77
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.130
The computer.
I'd just ask it.

78
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.330
I talked to it like you can hear him well it can't hear me cause he fucking,

79
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:41.780
I'll say shit to my wife and all of a sudden,
you know,
I'll be like,

80
00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:45.380
you know the fuck is your problem.
Well,
you know,

81
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.140
you treat me like a Douchebag,
right?

82
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.220
Then all of a sudden I go to my computer and on the side there's all these

83
00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:54.221
advertising for Douche bags and I never looked it up binding my time instead of

84
00:04:54.891 --> 00:04:55.940
biding my time.

85
00:04:55.941 --> 00:05:00.941
The side in the binding one's time is a verb that according to the American

86
00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:06.011
heritage dictionary means to a wait or wait for oh God.

87
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.210
People who are into language to that level going into the American heritage

88
00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:14.000
dictionary.
Somebody fucking sat down and look that up.

89
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.050
It's Wikipedia.
Why wouldn't you just make it up?
This podcast,
by the way,

90
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.070
is brought to you by cores light.
It's cold lagers,

91
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.020
cold filtered,
and cold packaged.
And you know what?

92
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.800
When I'm pitching shit jokes all day long and a fucking writer's room,

93
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.270
I like to come home,

94
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.400
do a podcast and drink one can of fucking cores light.
You know why?

95
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.600
Cause it's fucking delicious.
It's perfect.
I don't want to get hammered.

96
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.300
It's sort of tastes like water,
but I have a nice happy feeling afterwards.
Um,

97
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.040
this is me not drinking is every two days.
I have one beer,
one,
you know,

98
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.990
nobody in the England,
whatever,

99
00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:58.760
or the Europe in general would consider a fucking beer.
By the way.

100
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:03.140
Belgium is back on the fucking map.
That back on the map,

101
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.940
we were trying to go to Germany and Austria,
but they offered me like $30 and 50,

102
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:09.890
or maybe it was your rose.
I can't remember what.

103
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:13.240
So I dunno what the fuck I got going on over there.
Um,

104
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.730
I got to start trashing their sports teams so they know who the fuck I am.

105
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:18.810
And maybe they'll watch a few videos and I could maybe,
I don't know,

106
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.760
play whatever their version of what's funny.
Bone Yard.
Go to see funny bone.

107
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.700
All right,
let's get back to the fucking podcast.
Uh,

108
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.520
what happened today in the world?
I have no fucking idea.

109
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:35.930
I S I sat in a fucking writer's room all God Damn Day.

110
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.010
Um,
let's see.
Google news,

111
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.320
Google News.
All right.

112
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:47.321
In the U s a comprehensive up to date coverage aggregated.

113
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.330
All right.
Sit and spin.
Sit in spurs late night clash.

114
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:57.530
All this is about the gun shit.
Uh,
daily trail.

115
00:06:57.531 --> 00:07:01.460
Asian stocks wobble ahead of somebody cares about that.

116
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.300
Somebody has so much fucking money that that's going to gives a fuck what's

117
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:08.390
going on with their stocks.
You know,

118
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.320
once we became this giant financial fucking gang bang,

119
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.070
it's just over alligator that snatched two year old boy at Disney world has been

120
00:07:16.071 --> 00:07:18.800
killed.
How the fuck did they find it?
It didn't eat them.

121
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.320
There was no evidence of the kid and him.
Right.
Somebody rat them out.

122
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.440
Some other fucking allegate iron man.
It wasn't me.
I,
I,
you know,

123
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.210
somebody was talking the an alligator probably snatched the kid was like,

124
00:07:34.211 --> 00:07:37.840
Jesus Christ.
It's a fucking kid.
Thought it was a turtle.
I don't,

125
00:07:37.841 --> 00:07:40.090
I don't want to get fucking suit and I'm either going to kill me.

126
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.600
All the animals,
they got to know her at this point that if you fucking,

127
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.290
if you even fuck with the human being,
we come down and we track it down.

128
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.980
You know,
we'd done it to alligators.
We've done it to sharks.

129
00:07:50.981 --> 00:07:53.890
Who'd done it to gorillas that fucking alligator with the second he fucking saw

130
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:56.410
a shirt was just like,
that's not a turtle right?

131
00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.340
Spit the kid out and then fuck it took off and it still wasn't enough.

132
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.200
We come back around like bedbug Eddie and fucking a fucking popup.

133
00:08:08.101 --> 00:08:11.870
Greenwich village.
Two alligators,

134
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.710
not three
Bonnie,

135
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.030
some Irish fucking alligator.
I don't know.
I'm shitting

136
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:26.450
coast guard,
cruise.
Find Body and search for missing father,

137
00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:30.440
three teens.
Oh my God.
People are out of their fucking minds.

138
00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:33.500
People go out on boats.
You know what I mean?
Stay in a lake.
A lake is,

139
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:37.310
is his brutal enough?
Just cause the creepy thing.

140
00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:40.130
A lake is usually so fucking cold.
It never gives up your body.

141
00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:41.930
You just stay down there.
You know,

142
00:08:41.931 --> 00:08:45.740
it doesn't get warm enough for the gases in your gut to fucking make you be a

143
00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:48.770
fucking flow.
Duh.
You know what?

144
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.380
I learned that reading that book,

145
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:55.560
the Westies that when they used to make people do the Houdini is they say,

146
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.600
you know,
they'd kill people then they would chop them up.

147
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.380
They're big fucking thing was he had the yad to Yad to gut them.

148
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.580
You know?
Cause if you didn't,
you know,
whatever happens,

149
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.470
whatever happens when you die,

150
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.430
you know there's probiotics for the good bacteria in your gut than there's a bad

151
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:11.971
bacteria,

152
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:15.300
that bad bacteria that exists in your gut your whole fucking life sits there

153
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:18.150
waiting for you to die.
And when you die it activates.

154
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.290
And that's what fucking makes you decompose according to the person.

155
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:25.440
Two stools down for me at a diner one time.
All right?

156
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.490
Maybe I saw it on the fucking Internet.
I have no fucking idea.

157
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.090
I'm on my way to a slap fight or some shit.

158
00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:35.400
Whatever the fuck I was going to watch,
by the way on Twitter.

159
00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:39.330
I've got another good one.
Okay.
Worldstar hip hop.
You got to follow those guys.

160
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:42.600
And then there's 32nd fights.
Fucking unbelievable.

161
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:47.040
Watch the guy back a car over a woman today.
She was fucking up his car,
right?

162
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.920
You know,
you know a women when women fleeing,
you know,

163
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
flip out whatever the fuck you did cheated on them or whatever,

164
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.490
they fuck up your property because they're not going to get arrested for it

165
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.300
cause they have a fucking clamp.
Right?
So this fucking,

166
00:10:00.301 --> 00:10:03.480
she's throwing shit at the guy and the guy's trying to drive away and she throws

167
00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:05.820
like three or four fucking things at him.
I don't know what it was.

168
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.620
And finally she throws his last fucking thing at the guy and the guy just stops

169
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.830
and starts backing up towards her.
And I'm thinking he's,

170
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.680
he's just going to scare,
he's going to bumper,
you know what I mean?

171
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:21.450
Give it the old fucking,
you know,
a little,
you know,
you know those bumpers,

172
00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:21.631
you know,

173
00:10:21.631 --> 00:10:26.631
most of them made out of fucking flexible plastic figure.

174
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.210
Worst case scenario,
she's going to get a Joe Theismann.

175
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:34.240
This fucking guy bumped her and then just stomped on the gas and fucking backed

176
00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:38.750
all the way over and continue to go and then fucking,

177
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.220
and that's what kills me.
I was just,
I was like,
oh my God,
I thought she was dead.

178
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.550
Don't she got up?
It was like a cartoon.

179
00:10:48.551 --> 00:10:50.530
Like I thought that Shit only happened in a cartoon.

180
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.850
I would think once you go underneath a fucking car that was going as fast as

181
00:10:54.851 --> 00:10:58.510
this fucking guy.
I mean you just gotta think bent the rear axle.

182
00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.780
You got the differential right there.
She's getting the right,
they have Fred,

183
00:11:01.781 --> 00:11:06.010
but the fucking differential,
forget about the tires,
how the car is hot,

184
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:10.420
all of that shit.
How it didn't drag her down the fucking street.

185
00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.630
It's one of the most brutal things I've ever seen.
Having said that,

186
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.140
they're not all like that.
There's a lot of good flights on there.

187
00:11:17.141 --> 00:11:20.680
I feel like watching fights like I do,
I enjoy watching.
You know,

188
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:23.920
I liked violence.
I like watching it.
I don't know why.

189
00:11:23.921 --> 00:11:28.590
I like watching animals attack each other.
I like people fighting each other.
Uh,

190
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.560
it's enjoyable to me,
but I also like,
you know,
I like playing horseshoes.

191
00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.880
I like that.
Uh,
what do we call,
do you call it?
Shit.
I made a reference to it.

192
00:11:36.881 --> 00:11:40.930
My Life's special for these slide on the ice with that giant like obese hockey

193
00:11:40.931 --> 00:11:43.540
puck or that has a handle on it.
Curling.
I liked that too.

194
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.850
I can watch that white dude with the Afro do the paintings on Netflix,
you know,

195
00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:53.040
going to put a happy tree right over there.
Is that what you're gonna do it?
Yeah,

196
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.140
go ahead and do that shit.
I can watch the 700 club.
I can do a lot of shit,

197
00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:59.950
but I get the end of the day.
I still enjoy the violence.
Um,
all right.

198
00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:02.590
Las Vegas awarded an NHL Franchise.

199
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.070
Oh Fuck Jesus Christ.
What are they thinking?

200
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.520
What are they trying to become?
The NBA that you know,
I'll tell you right now,

201
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.510
if you think the fucking NBA is fixed now wait to the v Vegas gets a fucking

202
00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:14.344
teeth.

203
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.670
Kevin Durant's signing with Golden State Warriors.

204
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:23.730
Warriors would be mutually beneficial to Ho Warrior fans.

205
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:31.020
Steven Tyler says the Aerosmith train won't keep a rolling after next tour is

206
00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:35.140
the end near Jesus Christ.

207
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.170
That'd be one his was more intense.

208
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:43.570
Mocks calls Tesla's solar city deal.
No brainer.

209
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:48.620
Investors disagree.
Two,
how has this,
this Tesla Guy,

210
00:12:48.621 --> 00:12:52.130
man,
this guy is just,
he's fucking with,
he's fucking with some old money.

211
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:56.390
So the guy who makes the Tesla car,
by the way,
you guys like Jag was,

212
00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.810
I liked their entry level one.
The fucking,

213
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.210
you get to top of the line sports model one,

214
00:13:02.211 --> 00:13:05.360
you get it in that fucking British racing green.

215
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.020
I just wish you could get it in a stick.
Every cunt out has got a fucking,

216
00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:14.330
it's basically there are three series,
you know,
which is really,
you know,

217
00:13:14.331 --> 00:13:17.610
if you give a fuck,
should be the highest series that you buy because some do.

218
00:13:17.611 --> 00:13:20.780
She's going to come in and side swipe you if you're lucky.

219
00:13:20.781 --> 00:13:23.240
Maybe they leave a note in there and let's see what this guy's doing.

220
00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:28.160
Elon Musk inhabits a world of declarative super loud at ups.
Well,

221
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.380
whatever world that is,
I don't know what any of those words mean.

222
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:35.590
The claritive super low additives,
he lives in that world.
Well,

223
00:13:35.591 --> 00:13:37.990
no one or you figured out to make an electric cargo that fucking fast.

224
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.120
He lives in a world of declarative super lattice.

225
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.720
Jesus Christ as a whole and the fucking group of people I've never met.

226
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.511
How many are in?

227
00:13:47.511 --> 00:13:51.700
They're shitting all over the place and fucking walking into guerrilla and

228
00:13:51.701 --> 00:13:52.534
closures

229
00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:00.730
on a conference call with investors early Wednesday.
Tesla CEO

230
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:06.310
call this company is two point $8 billion offer for a solar city.

231
00:14:06.311 --> 00:14:10.840
A No brainer,
uh,
that it's legally and morally correct.

232
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.800
A zero doubt move that we should have done sooner.
I agree with all of this.

233
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.420
I don't know how much it should cost.

234
00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:21.040
So what's more must trumpet trumpeted that the deal could help propel Tessa

235
00:14:21.041 --> 00:14:25.120
toward the world's first trillion dollar company as the solution to the earth's

236
00:14:25.121 --> 00:14:28.750
climate change problem,
Jason,
to Trump,
right?

237
00:14:28.751 --> 00:14:32.200
This analysis aren't so sure.
Well,

238
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:36.130
who were the fucking analysis getting paid by the big oil companies at a steep

239
00:14:36.131 --> 00:14:41.131
drop and Tesla's stock down 10% in Wednesday's trading whacking 3 billion off

240
00:14:41.651 --> 00:14:46.030
its lofty $32 billion market Cap Confirms Investors Skepticism.

241
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.100
Fuck you.
You just don't want to see him do it.

242
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.070
Why can't the government gives some money the way they did the banks

243
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:59.070
fucking solar city,
man,
you make weed legal,
Bri,

244
00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.880
you grow it under solar panels every morning.
Everybody,

245
00:15:02.881 --> 00:15:05.490
you know there's like a continental breakfast,
right?

246
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.340
You get eggs from chickens,

247
00:15:08.341 --> 00:15:12.660
sits still have their beaks and they're not on roids like Mark McGuire,

248
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:16.230
right?
They got that little fucking waffle flippy thing.

249
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:20.190
You pour it in and then you turn it over.
You know,

250
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.350
somebody sent me something today,
we're actually some scientist,

251
00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.240
which I'm sure he's underground,
right?
He has no corporate money behind them.

252
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:32.550
Described humanity the way every great comic I've ever seen as starting with

253
00:15:32.551 --> 00:15:36.600
fucking Bill Hicks that basically said that human beings are a plague.

254
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.310
I remember one time reading a Joe Rogan blog and he was fucking said he was

255
00:15:42.311 --> 00:15:47.311
flying over the u s and he was looking down and just seeing how beautiful the

256
00:15:48.011 --> 00:15:50.300
country was.
And he was just looking at all the city.

257
00:15:50.301 --> 00:15:54.400
So she went through and how dirty and filthy where he said,
we're like a fungus.

258
00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:02.220
You know what I mean?
And I,
if you could interview fungus or whatever,
uh,

259
00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.130
virus out there that could kill us.
If you could talk to them,
you know,

260
00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:09.640
they don't think they're bad people.
You know,

261
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.570
they don't have that perspective because it just hanging around with other

262
00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:16.140
viruses where people have the same virus.
You know what I mean?
Like,

263
00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:19.350
if you could interview a chicken and ask him what a thanks to human beings.

264
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:20.970
I mean,
you wouldn't want to see,

265
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.200
remember the last episode of Seinfeld when everybody came back and talked about

266
00:16:25.201 --> 00:16:28.290
what selfish pieces of shit.
Elaine,
Jerry,

267
00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.450
a fucking Diane.
Whenever the fuck then a Kramer.

268
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.380
Oh,
what's the other guy's name?
Eddie.
Um,

269
00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:39.230
<v 0>okay.</v>

270
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.440
<v 1>Anyways,
they were talking about pieces of shit.
They were,
you have chickens,</v>

271
00:16:42.441 --> 00:16:46.930
dolphins,
anybody,
poisonous snakes,
tigers,
all of them.

272
00:16:46.931 --> 00:16:49.640
If they could just sit down and talk about it,
say yeah,
they wouldn't like us.

273
00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.620
You know what I mean?
And they keep,
then you know what?

274
00:16:51.621 --> 00:16:56.030
They'd go back to all the Qur'an.
They'd go out to the fucking Bible,
the Torah,

275
00:16:56.031 --> 00:16:58.280
all our religious books and just be like,
yeah,

276
00:16:58.281 --> 00:17:02.540
they read this thing and then they think it's okay to fucking do a bunch of shit

277
00:17:02.541 --> 00:17:06.770
to us.
Cause some fat guy named Buddha said it was okay.
You know,

278
00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.760
what do you guys think?
Like the right population numbers should be,
you know,

279
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.220
and how would you get the number down?

280
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.330
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

281
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.660
<v 1>At this point,
I mean drastic fucking magic.</v>

282
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.480
Do you know they got to put something in the fucking water to just sterilize

283
00:17:20.481 --> 00:17:21.314
people.

284
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.000
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

285
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.780
<v 1>And just act like it was a mistake.
Just having Sonta do it.</v>

286
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.490
You can't fucking sue them.
It's illegal.
Right.

287
00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:28.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

288
00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:29.880
<v 1>Well,
whatever the fuck it is,</v>

289
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:34.950
whatever Obama signed the great liberal fucking president that he was signed

290
00:17:34.951 --> 00:17:36.480
that fucking thing that said,
uh,
you know,

291
00:17:36.481 --> 00:17:39.630
they didn't have to say that their food was genetically altered.
Yeah.

292
00:17:39.631 --> 00:17:44.130
What a patriot.
Huh?
I'll at least fucking Consta or all the same.
Go,
go,
go,

293
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.580
go do your fucking speeches for 500 grand a whack.
Go do that.

294
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.800
Go give your kid a fucking zillion weddings.
You don't give a shit.
Right.
Um,

295
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:58.210
so it was city,
yea or nay.
What do you say,
yea or Nay?
What do you say?
I say,

296
00:17:58.211 --> 00:18:02.120
go ahead and fucking do it.
He said,
that's what you should do.
You know,

297
00:18:02.121 --> 00:18:05.190
it'd be great about a solar city then we don't need the people's fucking oil in

298
00:18:05.191 --> 00:18:08.850
the Middle East.
And then they gradually just go bankrupt.

299
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.020
You know,
there's no money flying around there.

300
00:18:13.021 --> 00:18:15.090
Then they don't have any money for a fucking nuclear warhead.

301
00:18:15.091 --> 00:18:18.360
And then everybody just relax.
They go back to doing their shit.

302
00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:22.080
We go back to doing our shit.
The reality is,

303
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.700
is in both parts of the world,

304
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.400
most people are just minding their own fucking business.

305
00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:31.490
It's the counts up at the top that hang out with Hillary at the Bilderberg

306
00:18:31.531 --> 00:18:31.950
meetings,

307
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:35.100
that they're the ones that just can't stand the fact that this fucking people

308
00:18:35.101 --> 00:18:39.510
live in somewhere and they're not making any money off of him.
Oh,

309
00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:43.500
Jesus.
Who had to wait over a third of a chorus,

310
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.740
lightened his fucking say and things.

311
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:50.760
He's not reading things.
People he spa,
but he's saying,
thanks.

312
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.620
Let's go over to sports.
Oh,

313
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.670
this is a typical fucking sports story now.

314
00:18:56.671 --> 00:19:01.410
Rape survivor finally faces Nebraska's Riley.
Dude,
what the,

315
00:19:01.411 --> 00:19:03.570
I'm trying to,
I'm trying to get away from this shit.

316
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.000
This belongs on the fucking sports page.

317
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.420
It's like they have a rape section.
Do they?
Is that right up to the,
uh,

318
00:19:11.421 --> 00:19:14.310
the Metro region.
All right.

319
00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:19.660
[inaudible] where is the sports?
John Jones says,
hatred for Daniel.

320
00:19:19.661 --> 00:19:24.130
Cormier is fading.
No date is set.
Photogra woods return.

321
00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:29.590
He's got to win another one.
He's got to win one more.
Uh,

322
00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:34.090
after four decade.
Weight manager,
great for grateful for a job.

323
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.850
This is what it's like.
This ranking Mbas.

324
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:42.000
Worst number one draft picks since 1989.
Of course,

325
00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:46.510
they got Greg Oden there
though.
What they should just show is everybody,

326
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.970
the Portland Trailblazers drafted over the last 30 fucking years.

327
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:52.723
Oh Shit.

328
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:59.390
But dig in.
Oh Man,
I think I'll stay on this website.

329
00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:03.700
I wasn't gonna stay up all of [inaudible] bone bone chicken coupon per tank
toto,

330
00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.840
but they pop up dead to Bottega.
But Denton Denton.

331
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:09.620
Then skip.

332
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.930
Skip Bayless gives emotional good bite of first taken Steven A.
Smith.
Oh,

333
00:20:14.931 --> 00:20:17.900
thank God he's leaving.
What's he going to get into?

334
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.230
He should go work with Joel Olsteen.
He should open for him

335
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.010
the two headed monster.

336
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:27.800
<v 0>Okay,</v>

337
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:32.360
<v 1>well,
everything that both of them say is,
is equally not believable.
All right.</v>

338
00:20:32.361 --> 00:20:34.130
The Philadelphia 70 sixers,

339
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:40.240
they drafted a Guy Andrea barn game,

340
00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:44.360
while he's name,
he's got a fucking woman's name.
This is men's basketball

341
00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.100
purpose.
Alison Sacramento

342
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:53.090
<v 0>Kings Ford lasted one season in Sacramento before he's dealt to Washington when</v>

343
00:20:53.091 --> 00:20:56.170
they was still called the bullets where we logged two great years.

344
00:20:56.171 --> 00:21:00.050
That was about it.
Oh,
I,
you know,
if injuries,
injuries,
Dad,

345
00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:01.420
I don't give a fuck about injuries.

346
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.360
It's when you're healthy and you're still suck.
Joe Smith,

347
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:06.670
is that a fucking alias?

348
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.540
The funny thing about Smith's is his career lasted a long time.

349
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.610
All right.
I don't know any of these people.
Are Michael all a wall?
Wonka donkey.

350
00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:22.320
<v 1>Kwame Brown.
Greg Oden.
I like Greg.</v>

351
00:21:22.321 --> 00:21:25.080
His how he know he was an old soul.

352
00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.810
He looked like Bill Russell does now,

353
00:21:27.811 --> 00:21:30.810
except he's Grecian formula and he came into the league.
He didn't,

354
00:21:30.811 --> 00:21:35.420
we wanted to earn his fucking money.
Anthony Bennett,
number one,

355
00:21:35.421 --> 00:21:37.610
the Cleveland Cavaliers and this is what to be something.

356
00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:41.330
You know what's Great Keith Cavalier fans is now you can fucking laugh about it.

357
00:21:41.331 --> 00:21:44.630
Right?
Did I talk about you guys yet?
No,

358
00:21:44.631 --> 00:21:48.140
cause I talked to before the fucking game.
Congratulations.

359
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.640
I cannot fucking believe how happy I was when the Cavaliers won.

360
00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.800
We were working in,
in uh,
Baltimore,
Baltimore,
and I watched,

361
00:21:57.801 --> 00:22:00.980
watched like the first quarter.
Then I went on stage when I got off.

362
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:04.490
Thank God it was the NBA,
there was still like fucking three quarters left.
No,

363
00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.130
there was like five minutes left,
10 minutes left.

364
00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.580
I can't fucking remember.
I watched most of the fourth quarter.
Right.

365
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.570
Which would be like 10 minutes and I can't remember what the fuck happened.

366
00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:20.160
That guy hit the three.
Joe Barry Carroll hit that fucking three.

367
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.590
And I live,
he was watching,
watching,
watching and thinking,
you know,

368
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.460
I knew I want to Cleveland,
but when he fucking hit that thing,
dude,

369
00:22:29.461 --> 00:22:33.390
I just stood up.
Just so I remember it was almost like when I'm a Bruins,

370
00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:37.140
won the Stanley Cup and all of a sudden there was just like five minutes left

371
00:22:37.141 --> 00:22:39.600
and they were controlling the play and you just could feel it.

372
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.270
I just stood up and I yelled at gonna do it.
They're gonna do it.
And four,

373
00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:45.890
she's going,
don't chicks him.
I'm like,
I am.

374
00:22:45.891 --> 00:22:49.340
I own fucking avenue control over this shit.
And,
uh,

375
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:55.260
then when the guy who punches everybody in the balls who you can't stand,

376
00:22:55.261 --> 00:22:57.000
but you would love if he was on your team.

377
00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:58.243
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

378
00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:02.750
<v 1>Uh,
he fought when he filed Lebron,
I thought the Brian landed on his wrist.</v>

379
00:23:02.751 --> 00:23:04.340
I thought he broke his shooting hand.
I was like,

380
00:23:04.341 --> 00:23:08.300
oh my God did down by there up by three.
He's going to miss them both.

381
00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.240
He's going to be out of the fucking game and then the honor,

382
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.600
honor roll students going to come down and hit a fucking three do one is little

383
00:23:14.601 --> 00:23:18.740
skippy fucking dances,
you know?
Um,
that makes you want to give them a leg sweep,

384
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.870
right?
They're going to tie it up,

385
00:23:20.871 --> 00:23:25.200
going to the overtime and they're going to fucking,
and they're going to lose it.

386
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.710
He misses the first one and I knew he was going to hit the next one.

387
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.980
He seemed all right.
Now go,
he's going to fucking hit it.
Bam.
He hits it.

388
00:23:31.981 --> 00:23:35.310
That was great.
I got to tell you a little bit too much crying for me though.

389
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.260
I didn't mind Lebron crying,

390
00:23:37.261 --> 00:23:41.730
but I don't know what the fuck is that guy in that suit on your bench?

391
00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:44.880
I didn't see much of a,
you know,
cause you know Lebron coaches the fucking,

392
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.310
what's his name?
Lou.
I mean that guy,
that guy was like balling.

393
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:53.300
I can understand the Bronx.
It was just a lot of crying.

394
00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:55.850
I was trying to picture pat.
We're like the Lakers winning it.

395
00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:00.980
Magic Johnson crying like that and then fucking Lebron now mean that Lebron

396
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.770
fucking pat,
Pat Riley also crying like that,

397
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.830
bent over and like his hair comes down.
You know,

398
00:24:06.831 --> 00:24:10.700
cause the Mousse isn't holding it anymore.
You know,

399
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:11.870
it's a different time.

400
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.430
This is what happens when you put Doctor Phil on for fucking 20 years.

401
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.793
<v 0>You know,</v>

402
00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.150
<v 1>he just keep back in guys into the can open up,

403
00:24:24.151 --> 00:24:26.730
open up while lady say goes,
is that what you wanted to see?

404
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.120
Bunch of people falling to their knees and you know,
started it.

405
00:24:30.121 --> 00:24:34.680
Chris Bosh started it.
I actually respected the fact that he did it.
You know,

406
00:24:34.681 --> 00:24:38.610
he just got it.
I lost the fucking championship.
He was sad.
He just fucking cried.

407
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:44.070
Um,
let me read a little bit of advertising here just a little bit.
Oh,
club,

408
00:24:44.071 --> 00:24:47.130
Debbie going to be happy.
I bet on the warriors,

409
00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.340
a club w delivers wind straight to your door.

410
00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:53.310
We send you wine that is personalized to your palate.
By the way,

411
00:24:53.311 --> 00:24:56.430
I had a fucking bet with Rappaport.
I still haven't heard from the man.

412
00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:00.500
Still haven't heard from him.
It's still not as still.

413
00:25:00.501 --> 00:25:03.950
I fucking called the final game.
That warriors game,

414
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.450
you know the spread was seven.

415
00:25:05.451 --> 00:25:09.140
I said give me eight and that was the exact fucking number.
Now what do we do?

416
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:09.891
Double and nothing.

417
00:25:09.891 --> 00:25:12.890
I said the Cavaliers and seven and you know I have not heard from that man.

418
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:17.240
So all you fucking Michael Rappaport's,
the real Rappaport,

419
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:22.070
whatever he's calling himself right now.
Then the Taurus Michael Rappaport,

420
00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.540
you let that man know that there's another man on another fucking podcast who

421
00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:30.470
also doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about and he's looking for.
Okay,

422

521
00:31:53.301 --> 00:31:56.300
You know what I mean?
When you're not reading about a rape case,

522
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:58.340
you know when you want to watch a game,

523
00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.900
you know when you're not reminded that people are dying of cancer or you know,

524
00:32:02.901 --> 00:32:05.900
whatever fucking other,
all other miserable motherfucking thing.

525
00:32:05.901 --> 00:32:08.450
They just got to bring up with sports all the God damn time.

526
00:32:08.451 --> 00:32:10.610
Now you know what it is?

527
00:32:10.611 --> 00:32:14.900
Is everybody's watching sports now.
Nobody's watching the news.

528
00:32:14.901 --> 00:32:17.030
So now they got to try to jam all the news.

529
00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:21.980
They got to jam the news of fucking telethon.
You know,

530
00:32:21.981 --> 00:32:24.640
just any fucking goddamn thing going on.
You know,

531
00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:27.830
there's an outbreak of the mumps and next thing you know they're going to parade

532
00:32:27.831 --> 00:32:32.690
a bunch of kids out with swollen faces.
How about a moment of silence?
You know,

533
00:32:32.691 --> 00:32:34.910
everybody puff out their cheeks in silence.

534
00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:40.580
I watch sports to get away from that shit.
Okay?
I fucking hate people.

535
00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:43.340
There are a bunch of,
yeah,
I know I can.
I hate groups.
I don't,

536
00:32:43.341 --> 00:32:47.210
I don't mind individuals.
Okay?
With an individual.
I can see the fucking light,

537
00:32:47.211 --> 00:32:48.920
but I don't need to be reminded.
Okay?

538
00:32:48.921 --> 00:32:52.700
I'm trying to get away from that fucking shit and uh,
I,
I don't know where to go.

539
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:55.190
If you're going to take sports from me,
I don't know what to tell you,

540
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:59.090
but you know what?
That's a topic for another fucking podcast.
All right?

545
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.210
<v 2>from another time.
Simpler.</v>

546
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:29.550
The body likes soft down in the sun.
I tried to sue the thought,

547
00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:35.760
nothing to do with straps,
words in the dirt and watch the water rolls down.

548
00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:46.390
Phantom just wasn't like Dan sex sled jump and down on the red.

549
00:33:46.391 --> 00:33:46.840
Zack,

550
00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:51.640
my candy land out the down to syrup while I watched a lot of rolled down.

551
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.040
But sit down and map.

552
00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.180
So see my mouth was,

553
00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.880
<v 1>hey,
what's going on far
the</v>

554
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:24.290
<v 3>Monday morning podcast.
Before I get started with the podcast,</v>

555
00:34:24.291 --> 00:34:29.291
I want to thank all of you who watched me last night on the bow.

556
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:34.070
Was it the guys' choice awards on Spike?
Um,
I dunno what happened.

557
00:34:34.071 --> 00:34:38.840
I did six minutes to stand up.
Evidently they cut it down to two minutes.

558
00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.900
Maybe it's because I'm dangerous.
I don't know what,

559
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:46.550
I probably should have told people to Tivo it.
I Dunno.

560
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:51.120
I guess some people might've been,
I dunno,

561
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.900
I didn't say I was hosting it.
You know what I mean?

562
00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:58.670
Some people were upset by how,
you know,
like dude,
what the fuck?
You know,

563
00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.840
she had to fucking and hour and a half and you all you on for fucking two

564
00:35:02.841 --> 00:35:07.460
minutes.
Well,
guess what?
I didn't direct it.
All right.

565
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:12.390
I don't edit it.
If I did,
it would have been two hours of me would,

566
00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.240
it would have been the,
uh,

567
00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:19.700
Bill Burr Tyler Perry presents,
Bill Burrs,

568
00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:24.530
fucking guys choice awards.
And it would have been two hours of me.
Uh,

569
00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.850
you know,
actually,
you know what,
I do a little bit of stand up.

570
00:35:27.851 --> 00:35:31.070
This is how I do it.
A little bit of standout,
um,

571
00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:36.120
get a standing ovation and then Oprah would suddenly appear on like this

572
00:35:36.471 --> 00:35:39.030
motorized couch,
like a sofa,

573
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.910
and she just sort of be brought to the front of the stage.

574
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:45.390
And as I was putting the mic and the mic stand,
so just be seamless.

575
00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.670
Like we wouldn't even have commercials.
And,
uh,

576
00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:52.140
then I would sit down and she would just start interviewing me with like some

577
00:35:52.141 --> 00:35:56.880
sort of,
uh,
you know,
turtleneck sweater on,
you know,

578
00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.270
and,
uh,
you know,
just ask me how I,
how,

579
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:03.630
how is it that I became so amazing,
you know?

580
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:06.060
So picture that now,

581
00:36:06.061 --> 00:36:08.820
what do you think would be worth what the fuck you saw last night or that

582
00:36:08.821 --> 00:36:12.570
horrific image I just brought up?
Um,

583
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.470
anyways,
uh,
this is the Monday morning podcasts.

584
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.170
I do one of these every week and that's a truck driving by.

585
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:23.920
If he can hear that Jesus Christ,
um,
I do one of these every week,
uh,

586
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:26.160
Ya Bullshit.
The 25 minutes or so,

587
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:31.820
and I answer questions that people might have and La Times I ask questions and

588
00:36:31.861 --> 00:36:33.330
then people give me answers.

589
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.830
Like last week I didn't know the difference between effect and effect.

590
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.930
And,
uh,
somebody 70 fucking two paragraphs,

591
00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:48.780
which was annoying.
You know,
I want a definition.
Okay.
My world,

592
00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:53.310
a definition is one sentence to number,
you know,

593
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:55.920
and then they write the fucking definition.

594
00:36:55.921 --> 00:36:57.990
And then maybe there's a number two and number three,

595
00:36:57.991 --> 00:37:02.160
but I never fucking read those.
So,
uh,
I'll try to abbreviate these.
Uh,

596
00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.070
the word app fact within a,

597
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:09.330
as an asshole is primarily used as a verb in English.

598
00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.311
Oh,
okay,
good.

599
00:37:11.311 --> 00:37:14.550
Because I want to make sure I don't fuck it up when I'm speaking Latin later on

600
00:37:14.551 --> 00:37:17.220
today.
Anyways,
it has two main meanings,

601
00:37:17.221 --> 00:37:22.110
which are quotes he related effect may mean to alter the feelings of or to

602
00:37:22.111 --> 00:37:27.111
change the mental state of someone or something may also mean in a percent to

603
00:37:28.321 --> 00:37:33.090
change or affect someone or something in any way.
See,

604
00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:34.440
I still don't know what that means.

605
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.740
This is why I'm a comedian because I,
you know,
I sucked in school.

606
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:45.770
It may also mean in a broader sense to change or fix someone or something in any

607
00:37:46.621 --> 00:37:51.600
way.
That doesn't even mean anything.
The word eat,
fuck it.

608
00:37:51.601 --> 00:37:54.300
Let's move on to effect.
Maybe if I know what effect is,

609
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.340
if I know the definition of that thing,

610
00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.280
that when the word doesn't fit into the definition of that,

611
00:37:59.281 --> 00:38:02.730
I'll know what's fucking effect,
effect and contrast.

612
00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:07.970
When contrast is used primarily as a noun in English as a number of related

613
00:38:09.271 --> 00:38:11.970
meetings.
And you know what,
I just realized I don't give a shit.

614
00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:17.330
And right there people you'll realize why I got an eight 10 combined on my sats.

615
00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.510
I don't know what part of the country you're from,
but in my neck of the woods,

616
00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:26.810
a 1600 was a perfect score and I believe you got a good 300 points just for

617
00:38:29.341 --> 00:38:30.570
signing your fucking name.

618
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:35.530
And I got an eight 10 combined and I'd love to sit there and tell you that I

619
00:38:35.531 --> 00:38:39.700
didn't try.
And then I was like,
man,
it's all bullshit.

620
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:44.170
Fucking government with these tests,
man.
I wasn't like that.

621
00:38:44.171 --> 00:38:48.820
I tried with all my might and all my concentration.

622
00:38:48.821 --> 00:38:49.940
I actually was doing what he might,

623
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:54.400
even ones that I did know the answer to which ever dealt with was more than 70%

624
00:38:54.401 --> 00:38:55.330
of the fucking test.

625
00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.670
I would try to do the process of elimination and uh,

626
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:05.670
you know,
you think Jesus Christ,
I could guess it's it.
It was,

627
00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:07.960
it was definitely,
it wasn't even devastating.

628
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:13.540
None of it was devastating because of my great mindset that I had in high
school,

629
00:39:13.541 --> 00:39:17.980
which was basically,
I don't give a fuck.
That was a,

630
00:39:17.981 --> 00:39:22.330
that's been my mindset for a long time and I'm 40 years old and I'm paying the

631
00:39:22.331 --> 00:39:26.690
price for it.
All right.
Anyways,
um,

632
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:31.670
this is what's going on in my life.
This,
uh,
this week.
All right?

633
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.240
This is really becoming a code,
codependent thing here.

634
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.680
I keep asking you guys to help.

635
00:39:35.681 --> 00:39:38.620
Remember the back in the day when you guys ask me questions and I answered them

636
00:39:38.621 --> 00:39:42.160
down fucking asking you questions and I have actually have an answer.

637
00:39:42.161 --> 00:39:45.040
Then he got them questions in a couple of weeks.
So why don't I go to that?

638
00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:49.750
That's what I'm going to do then to go to the questions.
Okay,

639
00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:53.740
let's read a couple of here and then I'll get to my fucking questions for you

640
00:39:53.741 --> 00:39:56.710
guys.
And this is going to be a blue collar question.
All right?

641
00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:59.680
So if you're clicking away on a spreadsheet,

642
00:39:59.681 --> 00:40:02.650
you can just tune out and about 10 minutes.
But anyways,
here are the questions.

643
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.350
Hey bill law,
when you go to a baseball game,

644
00:40:05.351 --> 00:40:10.250
do you prefer a night game or a day game?
Well,
considering,
um,

645
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:13.570
uh,
fucking pasty,

646
00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:19.300
I definitely prefer the,
uh,
I definitely prefer the night games.

647
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.030
Um,
yeah.
Yeah.
Cause I don't want to get a sunburn.

648
00:40:25.031 --> 00:40:30.031
And then also getting shit faced during the day is really a depressing thing.

649
00:40:30.251 --> 00:40:35.110
Past a certain age,
you know,
you do it at night,
it's no big deal.

650
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.030
You know,
you get shit faced at night,

651
00:40:37.031 --> 00:40:42.031
you come home and you pass out and you wake up and there's about 10 seconds of

652
00:40:42.041 --> 00:40:43.510
what the fuck did I do that for?

653
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:47.440
Before the phone rings and your day starts and you don't really have time to

654
00:40:47.441 --> 00:40:49.360
contemplate what a fucking loser you are.

655
00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:54.310
But when you get shit faced during the day at a fucking baseball game,

656
00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.850
aside from the fact that,
uh,
you know,

657
00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:02.770
the odds of you scaring children are increased by 80%.

658
00:41:02.771 --> 00:41:06.130
When you go to a day game and get hammered.
Um,

659
00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:12.130
yeah.
Then you fucking go home and it's like,
uh,
I dunno,

660
00:41:12.131 --> 00:41:16.660
you get home at like six and you're just drunk.
You know,

661
00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:21.130
maybe a pass out for like till like eight and then you wake up and fucking the

662
00:41:21.131 --> 00:41:22.570
TV's on way too loud.

663
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.830
Somebody screaming about dancing with the stars,
you know,

664
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.280
and then you can't fall asleep again to one in the mornings and then you order a

665
00:41:30.281 --> 00:41:33.980
fucking pizza and it's just a,
it's just vicious circle.

666
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:39.020
Start thinking things like,
man,
what if I just ran head first into that bookcase?

667
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:44.240
Maybe I could just knock myself out and I wouldn't have to sit here smelling

668
00:41:44.241 --> 00:41:49.040
like draft beer
with a third degree burns on my forehead.

669
00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.200
Yeah.
So they go,
I uh,

670
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:57.110
I prefer to go to the night games.
Lots of day games.

671
00:41:57.111 --> 00:42:01.040
They always have those fucking stupid giveaways.
First 200 people,

672
00:42:01.041 --> 00:42:05.900
it's backpack day,
you know,
or bad day.

673
00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:06.840
You know,
it's great.

674
00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:11.210
They even got rid of that day because they thought it was two filing and what's

675
00:42:11.211 --> 00:42:12.120
so fucking,
but you know,

676
00:42:12.121 --> 00:42:15.860
if this is what kills me was back in the day when they had a bad day,

677
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:20.630
you went down there and you've got a full slot,
full size,
full size,

678
00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:24.830
full size baseball bat.
A Goddamn Louisville slugger.

679
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:30.200
You've got a full size fucking batch.
It was ridiculous.
You know,

680
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:35.120
and all this talk about fucking global warming and uh,
you know,

681
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:38.600
oil and all that crap.
People trying to come up with solutions,

682
00:42:38.601 --> 00:42:43.280
it always blows my mind that they never talk about that day.

683
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:47.960
How the amount of fucking trees that they had to chop down to give away like

684
00:42:47.961 --> 00:42:52.910
5,000 bats at every game around,
around the God Damn God damn league.

685
00:42:52.911 --> 00:42:55.610
How many fucking teams when the leave,
when I was a kid,
like 26,

686
00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:58.880
26 times 5,000 let's see,

687
00:42:58.881 --> 00:43:03.460
2,410 it's fucking hundred 25,000 plus I don't another 30.
Oh,

688
00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:07.760
it's like 150,000 fucking bets.
You know,
but don't listen to me.
I got an eight,

689
00:43:07.761 --> 00:43:11.720
10 combined.
I'm like fucking sats.
And I tried to,

690
00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:16.970
Jesus Christ,
I tried.
I was devil,
you know,
and they usually say,
you know,

691
00:43:16.971 --> 00:43:18.940
when you give 100%,
you know,

692
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:21.950
it's one of the great things about giving 100% is that you can't,

693
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:27.290
you can't feel bad.
Who's bringing me?
Jesus Christ.

694
00:43:27.291 --> 00:43:29.360
This is my home phone.
I'm going to have to blow this off.

695
00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:32.660
Do you know what you know?

696
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.480
You know who's calling me right now and I'm going to blow it off.
I bought a,

697
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:43.580
I bought a set of,
uh,
you know,
those gymnastic rings.
Do you guys watch,

698
00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:47.270
do you watch the gymnasium?
You ever watched that shit?

699
00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:50.600
How many fucking times is my phone and before it goes to the gut in the shame,

700
00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:56.420
evidently 26.
Um,
you guys ever watch,
uh,
this is my deal,
man.

701
00:43:56.421 --> 00:43:59.960
I'm trying to,
uh,
you know,
turn 40 fucking trying to compensate.

702
00:43:59.961 --> 00:44:04.670
So I'm trying to find new ways to get in shape.
You know,
I mean,

703
00:44:04.671 --> 00:44:07.810
how many times can you go down to the gym and start throwing the weights around

704
00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:12.020
like your Lou Ferrigno,
you know,
plus when you lift weights,

705
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:15.020
you don't necessarily get in.

706
00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.920
You get in like 80 shape in the 80s.

707
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.140
The girls will like,
you know,
trying to dress like Olivia Newton,

708
00:44:24.141 --> 00:44:28.520
John doing aerobics,
you know,
I don't know.
Dress,

709
00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:31.890
I'm like strippers and then all the guys,
everybody,
everybody.

710
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:33.120
Basically in the 80s,

711
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:38.150
everybody had a huge upper body and then they had pretzel rod legs cause nobody

712
00:44:38.791 --> 00:44:42.330
did.
Nobody did like snow.
We did squats,
you know,

713
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:47.090
everybody's Oh fucking chest and back.
Well in and Fi's.

714
00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:51.610
Oh,
so you know,
I dunno,

715
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:54.330
you lift weights,
you just get off fucking,
you get all puffy.

716
00:44:56.610 --> 00:45:00.930
So I was just sitting there,
uh,
I don't know,
I was flipping through the channels,

717
00:45:00.931 --> 00:45:01.920
right.
I'm not going to lie to you.

718
00:45:01.921 --> 00:45:05.240
Gymnastics came on and it always kind of blows my mind the level of strengths

719
00:45:05.241 --> 00:45:07.590
that those guys have.
And uh,

720
00:45:07.591 --> 00:45:11.130
I was sitting on the floor and I was watching somebody,
they went into a,

721
00:45:11.131 --> 00:45:13.980
I think it's called the pike position.
So I was like,
Shit,
you know,

722
00:45:13.981 --> 00:45:15.930
and I do sit ups.
I bet I could try and do that.

723
00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:20.820
And I can't even explain to you like,
do you ever tried to do something?

724
00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:23.190
And it's like,
not only can you not,
I mean physically,

725
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:25.530
not only can you not do it that your brain,

726
00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:30.210
it's like you don't even have those muscles.
So when you go to do it,

727
00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:34.620
you actually feel like you're paralyzed because you're sending this message to

728
00:45:34.621 --> 00:45:37.290
you muscle going,
okay,
do this.

729
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:41.100
And it's not even like your muscles going like,
you know,

730
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:45.810
I tried but we can't.
There's like no response.

731
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:51.500
It's like yelling down a hole cause some fucking five year old who fell down in

732
00:45:52.021 --> 00:45:55.470
the middle of a white trash town in Arkansas.
I Dunno,
let's get,

733
00:45:55.471 --> 00:45:57.780
let's get that contract.
So I bought these,
uh,

734
00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:01.350
they're called the lead rings and uh,

735
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:06.890
you fucking your time to a chin up bar and uh,
you know,

736
00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:08.190
basically your work your way up.

737
00:46:08.191 --> 00:46:10.860
One day you're doing an iron cross right in the middle of your living room as

738
00:46:10.861 --> 00:46:13.560
you're watching the fucking evening news.
So that's what I'm working towards.

739
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:17.730
Okay.
So I get these goddamn rings.
I'm all excited,
right?

740
00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.410
You think I had a kid or something like this is how fucking excited and self

741
00:46:22.411 --> 00:46:23.131
centered I am,

742
00:46:23.131 --> 00:46:26.460
that I get that excited about something material that I bought for myself.

743
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:30.330
Rather than bringing a new life into the world that I can,
uh,
you know,

744
00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:34.170
try to nurture or whatever it is you do as a parent.

745
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:37.560
And anyways,
I got these things that for the life of me,

746
00:46:37.561 --> 00:46:42.480
I can't figure out how to fucking,
how to set them up.

747
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:44.080
They gave you,

748
00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:49.050
they gave me this really bad videotape with these Russian guys on it.
Dcs,

749
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:52.200
dcs,
that EMEA.
So,
and saw the 19,

750
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:54.900
the 2005 rings champion he had,

751
00:46:54.901 --> 00:46:58.710
he is doing an inverted fucking whatever,
you know,

752
00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:01.570
but they never showed you how to put the goddamn rope through the fucking ring.

753
00:47:01.571 --> 00:47:05.220
So that's what that phone calls evidently going to be.

754
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:09.600
Cause I called him up early this morning,
the one 800 number,
and I was like,
yes,

755
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:12.330
I got the rings.
Oh yes,
they're fantastic.

756
00:47:12.331 --> 00:47:17.160
But your shitty little DVD slash snuff film doesn't explain how to put the

757
00:47:17.161 --> 00:47:22.050
fucking rope to the ring.
You know?
And the guy's like,
go,
okay,

758
00:47:22.051 --> 00:47:23.350
well,
you know,

759
00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:29.540
I don't really have the rings in front of me so I can't really tell you how to

760
00:47:29.951 --> 00:47:32.410
do it.
Uh,
I just like,
yeah,

761
00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:35.980
it's sad on the fucking invoice that if I had a problem I could call this
number.

762
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.160
All right?
They didn't say I'd be talking to you.
You fucking moron.

763
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.970
So basically the guy doesn't even know how to the fucking guy in the one 800,

764
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:48.070
you know,
what else would I be calling him about?

765
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:54.670
You know,
Jesus Christ,
but that the invoice that needs,

766
00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:57.160
I got the ranks now,
what else would I be calling him for?

767
00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:01.510
Would I be calling him up to see if he could come over and spot me as I do an

768
00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:06.160
inverted headstands.
So anyways,

769
00:48:06.161 --> 00:48:09.030
he's got to have the head of the company call me or some shit.
I Dunno.

770
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.200
So I blew that off.
I blew it off.
And you guys,

771
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:14.680
you liked that giving you a little bit of guilt.
All right?

772
00:48:14.681 --> 00:48:19.330
So if anybody knows how to string up fucking gymnastic links for the love of
God,

773
00:48:19.331 --> 00:48:20.770
if you want the cup scouts or something,

774
00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:23.260
if he can somehow tell me how to do that.

775
00:48:23.261 --> 00:48:26.020
So I actually don't fucking break my neck while doing this shit.

776
00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:32.380
It would be greatly appreciated.
All right,
let's move on to the next question.
Um,

777
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:36.070
oh,
here's one.
Here's one night.
Anyway,
Bill,
I was wondering,

778
00:48:36.071 --> 00:48:39.550
does your grandmother is still drive?
Yes,
she does.
Mike,
you fucking content.

779
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.060
That's an inside joke for people listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.

780
00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:45.810
Next podcast question.
Um,

781
00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:50.850
what will be the moment that makes you decide to stop doing these podcasts?

782
00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:56.290
I am one of the loyal 14 listeners,
as you always say.
I love hearing them,

783
00:48:56.410 --> 00:49:01.100
blah,
blah blah.
So if he keeps them coming every week,
B,
do,

784
00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:06.640
um,
what will be the moment that that makes me stop doing them?
Um,

785
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:10.780
I dunno.
I'm rubbing my forehead right now with my eyes closed.

786
00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:14.290
Trying to think of an answer.
I don't know

787
00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:18.280
if I actually was,
I probably would've stopped doing them awhile ago,

788
00:49:18.281 --> 00:49:21.070
but I have a need to be liked.
And if I stopped doing them,

789
00:49:21.071 --> 00:49:24.400
it would only take one email from just one person going like,

790
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:28.610
I can't believe you said stop touring them.
I know.
I really,

791
00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:31.510
I really enjoyed them.
You know,

792
00:49:31.511 --> 00:49:34.420
I've been going through some difficult times lately.

793
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:40.410
Last summer I was trying to make some lemonade and when I went to put it into

794
00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:42.490
the pitcher,

795
00:49:42.491 --> 00:49:47.491
it's shattered and the glass came up and it hit me in my eye and I haven't been

796
00:49:48.431 --> 00:49:49.264
able to work.

797
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:53.280
And I then home and every week they look forward to the Monday morning podcast

798
00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:58.240
and as ridiculous as that bucket south,
I actually get stories like that.
So,
uh,

799
00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:03.490
actually I don't get stories like that.
I get more serious ones and uh,

800
00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:04.383
but they're not funny.

801
00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:07.480
So I decided to make up that one about the fucking picture eliminate,

802
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:11.320
which really wasn't that funny.
Um,
but you know,

803
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:16.120
you try it,
throw it out there.
Um,
what else do we got here?

804
00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:17.950
I thought I had more fucking questions and that

805
00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:24.850
you own is I fucking take these questions and I copy and paste them and they

806
00:50:24.851 --> 00:50:29.270
just,
somehow they never end up
at three in a row.

807
00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:36.730
Baseball game.
Your grandmother.
Oh,
there's one.
Okay.
So what is your take on this,

808
00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:39.600
this next election?
Uh,

809
00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:44.390
who do you think has a shot at the throne and are you test how much hype it's

810
00:50:44.391 --> 00:50:48.590
getting?
I don't know.
That's how he ends it.
Id K uh,

811
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:52.220
yeah.
I can't believe how much heights the,
uh,

812
00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:55.310
who's going to be the next president of the United States is getting,

813
00:50:55.311 --> 00:50:58.670
what the fuck was that?
Um,
yeah,

814
00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:01.180
it's always annoying when things that don't deserve to be heights,

815
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:06.140
like landing on the moon and a,
the next presidential election or getting,

816
00:51:06.141 --> 00:51:06.321
you know,

817
00:51:06.321 --> 00:51:10.400
I wish they would continue focusing on other things that are more important,

818
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:13.250
like a,
the next American idol.
Um,

819
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:17.320
who's left in the Big Brother House and,
uh,

820
00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:22.810
I don't know when the next episode of fucking mind [inaudible] I don't know.

821
00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:26.540
No,
I'm not pissed it,
uh,
I gotta be honest with you.

822
00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:29.810
I haven't even been watching it because I get so God damned depressed that they

823
00:51:29.811 --> 00:51:31.160
never really talk about anything.

824
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:35.960
And no matter what you ask them to be like a,
you know,
hey,

825
00:51:35.961 --> 00:51:39.440
what are you gonna do about the troops in Iraq?
And then we'll just be like,

826
00:51:39.441 --> 00:51:42.410
you know,
the troops in Iraq,
uh,

827
00:51:42.411 --> 00:51:47.120
is an issue that everybody is very concerned about and it's something that

828
00:51:47.121 --> 00:51:51.540
definitely needs to be addressed.
And,
uh,
when the time is right,
uh,

829
00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:56.750
we are going to sit down with some people who are very not knowledgeable in that

830
00:51:56.751 --> 00:52:00.870
field and we are going to have an assessment.
Um,

831
00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:05.510
and after doing some sort of research,
we will arrive at a,
uh,

832
00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:08.810
a conclusion that we will be presenting our next question.

833
00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:13.140
And that it just becomes that,
um,
we're,

834
00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:15.200
I think as a shot at the throne.
Well,
I mean,

835
00:52:15.201 --> 00:52:16.970
I spent a lot of time in New York and La,

836
00:52:16.971 --> 00:52:20.720
so obviously I would think that Barack is going to win by a landslide.

837
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:25.130
But when I go on the road and I get to some of these other states,

838
00:52:25.131 --> 00:52:28.490
like North Carolina and Georgia,
you know,

839
00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:33.230
and you walk down the street and for some reason the music in your head switches

840
00:52:33.231 --> 00:52:36.070
from Jack Johnson suggested good ole boy.

841
00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:39.170
They ever made in the hall.

842
00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:43.970
We told you it was the whole moon and trouble with the lols and the baby was

843
00:52:43.971 --> 00:52:48.350
born.
You think John Mccain's going to win?
Personally,

844
00:52:48.351 --> 00:52:51.680
I don't want a president who can't do the wave.
Okay.
That's

845
00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:57.830
all right.
That's one of the most evil fucking things I have said for those of,

846
00:52:57.831 --> 00:53:02.030
you don't realize John Mccain can't lift his arms past his shoulders because he

847
00:53:02.031 --> 00:53:04.370
was tortured in captivity,
uh,

848
00:53:04.371 --> 00:53:09.230
while fighting for a freedom for myself to do this podcast,

849
00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:13.430
at least that they would,
that's the way they,
they would frame it on Fox News,

850
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:16.430
you know,
rather than,
uh,
he was pissed at his dad.

851
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:19.140
He was trying to outdo him and,
uh,

852
00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:24.200
he got a jet and he could have bailed out or flew away,
but he didn't.

853
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.390
And uh,
you know what I'm saying?
I mean,
what the fuck?

854
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.720
I wouldn't have a guilt people about my podcast.
I'm not doing this podcast,

855
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:35.760
the freedom.
Um,
anyway,
so what do I think's going to win?

856
00:53:35.761 --> 00:53:40.080
I have no fucking idea.
Uh,
I do like John Mccain.
I like John Mccain because,

857
00:53:40.081 --> 00:53:44.450
uh,
the fucking right wing psychos don't like him.
And A,

858
00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:47.790
I don't consider Bush and Dick Cheney to be Republicans.

859
00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:52.110
I consider them to be psychos who call themselves Republicans.

860
00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:56.670
I don't think Republicans are as bad as Bush and Cheney.
I really don't.

861
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.810
I think they were an oil guy.
And,
uh,

862
00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:03.030
a guy who worked at General Electric,
a Halliburton,

863
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:08.460
we let the nuts run the fucking asylum and that will pay for it.
So either way,

864
00:54:08.461 --> 00:54:13.320
I don't think he,
the guy's going to be a,
I don't know.
I think we,

865
00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:16.740
I don't know Obama,
I don't even fucking know.
I like Ron Paul.

866
00:54:16.741 --> 00:54:17.820
But I've done this before.

867
00:54:17.821 --> 00:54:22.140
I always vote for that fucking guy and he and nobody else does.
You know,

868
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:27.060
you should see my voting record.
Let's see.
You want to have my voting record.

869
00:54:27.070 --> 00:54:28.410
Lot of people keep this shit private,

870
00:54:28.411 --> 00:54:30.120
but I don't because I don't give a fuck or right.

871
00:54:30.121 --> 00:54:34.440
In 1988 was the first time I voted for president and I voted for George Bush,

872
00:54:34.441 --> 00:54:36.690
Sr over Michael Dukakis.

873
00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:40.440
And it had nothing to do with him sticking his head out of that tank,

874
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:44.910
squinting looking like some sort of a market.
Um,

875
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.590
I just voted that way because that's the way everyone else around me was voting.

876
00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:52.970
And I was fucking 20 years old now,
right?

877
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:56.610
1992 I voted for Ross Perot

878
00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:02.400
because,
uh,
I dunno,
he actually seemed to be fucking answering questions,

879
00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:07.930
you know,
and the other two weren't,
you know,

880
00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:12.150
Bill Clinton just kept smiling.
Oh,
playing a saxophone,

881
00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:16.430
you know,
trying to be the cool guy.
His campaign,

882
00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:21.360
it fucking posters could just send him leaning against the wall with his thumbs

883
00:55:21.361 --> 00:55:22.050
in his pocket,

884
00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:25.890
looking down the hall with one foot on the floor and the other foot up against

885
00:55:25.891 --> 00:55:30.740
the wall.
You know,
that that bug and that was his fucking pot,
you know,
you know,

886
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:35.390
a puts on weight like a bitch too.
I never liked his mother.
And hips.
Um,

887
00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:40.500
and then in 1996,
a Ross Perot came back.

888
00:55:40.501 --> 00:55:45.090
I wasn't feeling him.
And,
um,
Bob Dole seem like that grumpy guy next door,

889
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.460
who calls the cops when you had a keg party?

890
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:52.260
So I went with Bill Clinton and a in 2000,

891
00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:55.680
uh,
I didn't like Bush and I didn't like Al Gore.

892
00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:01.500
I didn't like either one of them.
So I went with fucking Ralph Nader
and,

893
00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:03.570
uh,
what the fuck does that lead us?

894
00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:10.290
Please let us to the last one.
I remember who I voted the last time.

895
00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:14.730
I didn't vote for fucking John Kerry and I didn't vote for John Kerry.

896
00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:19.290
You know what killed his campaign for me was when he passed that he was

897
00:56:19.291 --> 00:56:23.860
questioning George Bush for,
uh,
you know,
during Vietnam War,

898
00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:29.550
spending the war in the stock room at a cvs before going home later on that

899
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:34.150
afternoon.
So he was trying to,
you know,
hype up his military career.

900
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:39.420
He got behind the podium and he went Saturday carry boarding for duty.

901
00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:44.320
And it was one of the coneys things I've ever seen.

902
00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:49.180
And he delivered the line just,
Oh,
just in a horrible way,

903
00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.270
you know,
worse than Mark Wall Walberg in the happening.

904
00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:57.910
I don't know if anybody says anybody seen that fucking movie.
It's so bad.

905
00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:01.690
It's,
it almost comes back around to being good again.

906
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:06.340
If movies weren't fucking $12 or whatever the fuck they are now,
you know,

907
00:57:06.341 --> 00:57:08.020
I dunno,
just dope.

908
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:12.460
The moral of the movie that I got is a,
you know,

909
00:57:12.461 --> 00:57:16.780
and this is a spoiler alert.
Spoiler alert.
Can't even say it.

910
00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:19.870
Just fucking plug up.
You've got damn years here.
All right.

911
00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:24.820
I'm going to talk about it for 15 seconds and then you can turn the sound back

912
00:57:24.821 --> 00:57:28.270
up.
All right.
The moral of the happening was basically,

913
00:57:28.271 --> 00:57:33.271
it doesn't make a difference if you're a scientist or if you're some dumb jock.

914
00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:39.850
Nobody knows what the fuck is going on,
but we better love each one,
each other,

915
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:44.430
better love each other or else the tree.
Cause if we don't the,
uh,

916
00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:49.300
the fucking trees will kill us.
You know what?

917
00:57:49.301 --> 00:57:52.870
I realized my fucking stutterer and through all of that was worse than the

918
00:57:52.871 --> 00:57:57.490
goddamn movie.
All right.
I hope you brought the sound back up.
Okay,
here we go.

919
00:57:57.550 --> 00:58:01.960
We're going to end this podcast with uh,
um,
oh,

920
00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:05.800
bad car stories.
Okay.
And I,
before I go,

921
00:58:05.801 --> 00:58:08.890
I want to thank everybody for coming out to the punchline in Atlanta last week.

922
00:58:08.891 --> 00:58:12.400
I had a great time.
Um,
and uh,

923
00:58:12.401 --> 00:58:16.960
I want to thank that woman who when I was ranting about adopting a dog,

924
00:58:16.961 --> 00:58:21.850
decided to stand up like she was in a coal miner's daughter and a read me the

925
00:58:21.851 --> 00:58:26.320
riot act about fucking great Danes or whatever the hell she was talking about.

926
00:58:26.321 --> 00:58:26.771
But anyways,

927
00:58:26.771 --> 00:58:31.180
thanks for everybody came out there and I'm going to be at the Improv in

928
00:58:31.181 --> 00:58:35.500
Pittsburgh,
uh,
July 10th through the,
uh,
through the 13th.

929
00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:40.090
And I will be going to the pirates game and I will be going to a day game

930
00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:43.790
possibly,
which means they'll probably be given away a,

931
00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:45.170
it's fanny pack day.

932
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:49.690
It's fucking three rivers stadium or whatever you call that new one that shows

933
00:58:49.691 --> 00:58:51.550
that piss yellow bridge in the background.

934
00:58:51.551 --> 00:58:54.820
Every time the other team hits a home run.
Okay,

935
00:58:55.540 --> 00:59:00.130
let's get to a lift.
Get the fucked up car stories here.
Uh,
I,

936
00:59:00.131 --> 00:59:02.470
when I'm serious about those rings,
by the way,
I wasn't kidding.

937
00:59:02.471 --> 00:59:05.560
If anybody knows how to string those things up,
please for the love of God,

938
00:59:05.561 --> 00:59:09.380
let me know.
Um,
okay.
Uh,

939
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:11.830
just to get people a backstory,
if you knew that my podcast,

940
00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:16.120
I had a dent in my car for three months,
I finally got the fucking thing fixed.

941
00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:18.440
Five days later I took it to a,

942
00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:22.670
I had it valid and I came downstairs and fucking things dented and the exact

943
00:59:22.671 --> 00:59:25.310
same God damn spot.
And uh,

944
00:59:25.311 --> 00:59:29.960
I learned about the expression to be beside oneself.
Alright?

945
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:33.410
So anyways,
people wanted to tell me that fucking awful car stories,

946
00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:38.120
a lot of anger in these.
So if you're not into a dirty words,
uh,

947
00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:42.650
you might want to block here a block your ears.
Um,
okay.
Uh,

948
00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:46.850
car stories.
Bill,
I liked your podcast and I can relate to the dense story.

949
00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:49.080
Some very old cunt.

950
00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:56.540
I'm very old con as opposed to a,
a,
you know,

951
00:59:56.541 --> 01:00:00.320
middle aged conch or just an old con,
some very old con.

952
01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.480
What constitutes a very old con.
I'm going to say,
uh,

953
01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:10.090
older than 78 and has been smoking camel and filters since the 30s.

954
01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:14.720
Um,
some very old content and my car after I had just fixed,

955
01:00:14.721 --> 01:00:16.820
it was running like gold.

956
01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:20.690
It happened a week before Christmas and the old blind bitch,

957
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:25.610
her name was Emma cunty thing.
Ha Conti.
Things happen.

958
01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:30.770
I never heard that word.
Cunty until I listened to you.
Okay,

959
01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.530
well maybe someday I'll teach you how to finish a fucking story.

960
01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:36.680
I guess you just hit it.
It was running like gold.

961
01:00:36.681 --> 01:00:41.270
Can you just abbreviating heaven week for Christmas,
the old blind bitch,

962
01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:45.980
her name was Emma Irma.
All right.
You know,

963
01:00:45.981 --> 01:00:49.970
I'm always fascinated with old people's names like Irma.
You know what I mean?

964
01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:54.440
You hear the name Irma,
you just know it's somebody fucking old,
you know,

965
01:00:54.490 --> 01:00:57.590
or Gladys.
And the weird thing is,

966
01:00:57.591 --> 01:01:02.180
is you know that when they were being born,
like those weren't the new hip names.

967
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:07.340
Like,
you know,
people name their kids like Dakota,
you know,
Someday Dakota,

968
01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:12.290
like later on at the end of this century,
Dakota,
there's an old guy named Dakota.

969
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:17.810
Um,
oh look,
there's a baby and is his old lady named fucking apple.

970
01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:22.460
Like that name is going to,
that's going to be like a Ebenezer.

971
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:27.380
That's what happens.
That's what happens,
man.
You can look it up.
All right,

972
01:01:27.381 --> 01:01:30.500
let's get on with these fucking things.
All right.
A yellow bill.
What's going on?

973
01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:35.300
What's going on,
dude?
I have a lancer evolution.
I don't know what that is.

974
01:01:35.370 --> 01:01:39.680
I had a dent in it from getting groceries at Super Walmart.

975
01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:43.640
As much as I hate that fucking evil company,
they had the cheapest.

976
01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:46.460
Well do,
that's yeah,
that's how it works.

977
01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.030
If it fucking huge and they've dropped the prices and they put the mom and pops

978
01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.860
out of business because idiots like you go to them rather than sticking it out

979
01:01:54.861 --> 01:01:58.770
with the mom and pop and letting the billionaire with his 9 million square feet

980
01:01:58.771 --> 01:02:02.820
go out of fucking business.
So as much as you hate,
Yay.
Yeah,

981
01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.390
helping them fucking continue that their domination.

982
01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:08.390
And then he writes whatever.

983
01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:12.080
Almost like he knew I was going to rant about that anyways,
uh,

984
01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:13.310
while I was in there,

985
01:02:13.311 --> 01:02:17.180
I got hit in the front of my car and it dented the shit out of the front bumper

986
01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.380
and busted a headlight.
Of course,

987
01:02:19.381 --> 01:02:23.760
I snapped and I went back into the store screaming about this and demanded to

988
01:02:23.761 --> 01:02:27.180
see the parking lot cameras.
I like that.
That's a strong move.

989
01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.000
Of course,
that week,

990
01:02:30.001 --> 01:02:33.780
the two far side cameras were not working and I never found out who did it.

991
01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:37.110
Three months later,
after driving around,

992
01:02:37.111 --> 01:02:41.370
constantly looking like a total fucked up loser,
I got it fixed.

993
01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:42.871
Okay.

994
01:02:42.871 --> 01:02:46.290
Three months later you get your car fixed and what happened that night I was

995
01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:50.340
driving and Cleveland,
Ohio.
I live in Medina parentheses,

996
01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:55.380
shit hole and I come out and I hit a massive pothole and blew out my tire,

997
01:02:56.290 --> 01:03:00.360
crack my bumper and wheel well.
I called the city and they just,

998
01:03:00.361 --> 01:03:03.210
and they said that they just passed the bill saying that they were no longer

999
01:03:03.211 --> 01:03:06.720
responsible for damage caused by potholes.

1000
01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:10.710
Oh my God.
He writes the rage I had at that point,

1001
01:03:10.711 --> 01:03:15.540
I just wanted to kill as many innocent people as possible
after having,

1002
01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:19.770
getting my car fixed twice.
You know what,
how does that work within government?

1003
01:03:19.771 --> 01:03:22.740
Does anybody notice know how that works?
How do they,

1004
01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:26.970
how do they pass a bill that they're not responsible?
You know what I mean?

1005
01:03:26.971 --> 01:03:31.930
Like if they ever put that on a bill,
no one,
no regular person,
whatever,

1006
01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.560
whatever,
both to have that past.

1007
01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:38.570
I wish I could fucking do no longer responsible for getting drunk and putting my

1008
01:03:39.781 --> 01:03:43.680
hands on your person.
All right,
here's the last one.

1009
01:03:43.681 --> 01:03:45.030
I'm going to wrap up this podcast.

1010
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:50.270
I like this one because all the other ones people have been telling me have been

1011
01:03:50.281 --> 01:03:53.670
like a,
you know,
they didn't do anything and uh,

1012
01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:58.260
they weren't at fault.
Like,
uh,
like this guy,
uh,

1013
01:03:59.070 --> 01:04:01.140
I've been without my car for over two weeks now.

1014
01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.930
First I had to take it to the shop because they had an intake problem.
Uh,

1015
01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.100
I always think they make that shit up cause I know you don't,

1016
01:04:08.101 --> 01:04:10.630
you don't have no idea what it is.
What's like wasn't,
you know,

1017
01:04:10.631 --> 01:04:14.580
it was probably my car.
Oh,
you got an intake problem.
Uh,

1018
01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:18.300
you've got to post it aspirator too.
They just pick that obscure Shit,
you know?

1019
01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:19.501
But anyways,
I was,

1020
01:04:19.501 --> 01:04:23.040
it was in the shop like five days and then those five days it felt like I was 16

1021
01:04:23.041 --> 01:04:25.740
again.
You know,
before you get your license and you bumming rides off,

1022
01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:28.470
everybody just kept thinking,
man,
I gotta get my fucking car.

1023
01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:31.260
He's failing all pathetic and shit.
Well,

1024
01:04:31.261 --> 01:04:34.620
I got it out and I drove it home with a big stupid grin on my face.

1025
01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:40.830
I might have ran an errand or two,
I don't know.
All I know is I took it home,

1026
01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:45.670
sat down at a bear,
and I put on the Astros game.
I was in a freaking great move.

1027
01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.990
It sounds like it got them beer commercial.
This is great,
right?

1028
01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:51.890
This guy's life's going awesome.
And what?
Then what happens?

1029
01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:55.770
All of a sudden his girlfriend said,
I need to go to the store.

1030
01:04:56.490 --> 01:05:00.150
And that annoying tone of hers.
So like a dumb ass.
I let her go.

1031
01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:04.470
I get a call from her 15 minutes later and she's calling me from the side of the

1032
01:05:04.471 --> 01:05:07.950
road by an ambulance.
She had gotten a wreck.

1033
01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:12.330
I love southern people.
She got no wreck,
not just direct.

1034
01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:15.180
She fucking totaled the front passenger side of the car.

1035
01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:20.050
What makes it worse is that it was her fucking fault.
God Damn it.

1036
01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:24.370
I was pissed.
I was honestly going to ask her if the car was okay first,

1037
01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:29.500
but I knew that would cause a huge,
huge argument when she got home.
Yeah.
My God,

1038
01:05:29.501 --> 01:05:33.160
isn't that the worst?
And you know,
she was just crying her fucking eyes out.

1039
01:05:33.161 --> 01:05:37.330
Wasn't she just them just to make you feel like a bully.
If you actually went,

1040
01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.710
you stupid bitch.
I just got that fucking thing fixed.

1041
01:05:40.711 --> 01:05:42.070
I helped you went through the windshield.

1042
01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:47.290
You know he did it actually justified in saying that,
but you can't.
So anyways,

1043
01:05:47.291 --> 01:05:51.850
those are three,
three great stories with a person with the car was the victim.

1044
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:57.190
And then you get to this last one.
I liked this last one.
Um,

1045
01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:02.470
I've had my 99 BMW three 25 I just got some work done on the engine and it runs

1046
01:06:02.471 --> 01:06:05.980
like new last month on a Thursday,
a little tipsy,

1047
01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.130
which means he was shit faced.
I got into my car,

1048
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:12.940
angry at this girl I had been talking to.
Okay.

1049
01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:16.210
Did she have bruises on her wrist?
Um,

1050
01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:19.140
who's angry?
This girly,

1051
01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:23.650
but talking to he backs up furiously in this parking garage,

1052
01:06:24.010 --> 01:06:26.260
smack the larger than life pickup truck,

1053
01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:29.710
which crushes his entire passenger's side tail light.

1054
01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:34.210
It puts a large dent right underneath it.
No one's around.

1055
01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:37.170
I leave a note on the car to give me a call if they're pissed.

1056
01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:40.380
Not much damage to the huge dodge ram,
which seems to,

1057
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:44.290
we've been parked in the middle of the aisle.
Um,

1058
01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:50.290
I don't want to be a Dick,
but,
uh,
that truck wasn't moving.

1059
01:06:50.650 --> 01:06:52.300
And you said it was larger than life.

1060
01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:56.290
And you also mentioned that you were a little tipsy and you are angry at this

1061
01:06:56.291 --> 01:06:56.710
girl.

1062
01:06:56.710 --> 01:07:00.070
This is a horrible way to tell this story if you wanted some sort of empathy,

1063
01:07:00.071 --> 01:07:03.820
but you know what?
The fact that you brought the broad into the story.

1064
01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:08.170
I actually actually feel bad for you.
Why are we a little tipsy?
Huh?

1065
01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:11.140
Were you buying her drinks all night?
You know,

1066
01:07:11.141 --> 01:07:12.640
I want to hear the rest of this story.
You got to,

1067
01:07:12.641 --> 01:07:15.580
you got to email me as to why you were mad at this girl from,

1068
01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:19.600
cause I have to know the backstory to me to actually feel bad that you slammed

1069
01:07:19.601 --> 01:07:24.400
your BMW into a Goddamn Dodge Ram Jag.
You know what?
It sucks.
I've been there.

1070
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.860
I've been there.
I can put my truck into a god damn ditch one time drunk,

1071
01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:35.200
pissed off at somebody.
But anyways,
um,
thanks for all the questions.
Thanks for,

1072
01:07:35.201 --> 01:07:39.130
uh,
all the,
uh,
all the stories about your cars.
Uh,

1073
01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:44.160
please come and see me at the Improv in Pittsburgh on next month and uh,

1074
01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:49.770
July 10th through the 13th and go to [inaudible] dot com for all the dates and a

1075
01:07:50.381 --> 01:07:51.730
one special side note.

1076
01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:56.140
I'm actually just found out right before I did this podcast that,
uh,

1077
01:07:56.170 --> 01:08:00.970
George Carlin had passed away last night,
ran out here in Santa Monica.

1078
01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:06.790
Um,
and I didn't really feel like talking about it to be honest with you,

1079
01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:11.050
cause there's two,
uh,
two fucking depressing.
Um,

1080
01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:16.400
all I can say about the guys,
he's just,
you know,
he's unbelievable.

1081
01:08:16.401 --> 01:08:20.660
And,
uh,
uh,
I don't,

1082
01:08:20.661 --> 01:08:22.460
I don't really want to talk,
just,
just,
you know,
the guy,

1083
01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:25.670
the guy got fired in 2001.

1084
01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:28.250
I was always like a big thing for me.

1085
01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:32.940
The fact that the guy was in his sixties and he could still say shit that

1086
01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:36.710
actually got him fired in Las Vegas.
And,
uh,
you know what I mean?

1087
01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:40.130
Most people run out of steam by the time they fucking my age.
And that guy,

1088
01:08:40.131 --> 01:08:44.090
you know,
25 years later,
it's still,
we're still freaking people out.
But,
uh,

1089
01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:49.370
I mean,
I don't need to tell you guys this,
but just without a doubt,

1090
01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:54.560
without a doubt,
easily top three of all time,

1091
01:08:54.561 --> 01:08:58.220
I put them right there,
prowler,
prior Carlin and uh,

1092
01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:03.950
and Lenny Bruce.
And,
uh,
it's fucking brutal.

1093
01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:06.860
Fucking brutal.
What an awful way I see these by didn't bring it up.

1094
01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:09.860
I just want to bring out and try to give you guys laughs on the shift rather

1095
01:09:09.861 --> 01:09:11.900
than talk about,
but he was one of the,

1096
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:16.430
one of the two reasons I got into this shit where him and Richard Pryor and I

1097
01:09:16.431 --> 01:09:21.410
used to do my paper route
doing his bits,
delivering papers,

1098
01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:26.740
pretending I was him onstage in front of my kids.

1099
01:09:26.811 --> 01:09:31.250
I went to school with,
um,
that's how much I love to stuff.

1100
01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:35.570
That's how much the guy meant to me.
And uh,
you know,
uh,

1101
01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:40.370
rest in peace and a,
I know he didn't believe in an afterlife.
So,
uh,

1102
01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:45.270
I dunno.
Enjoy your time in the ground George and thanks for all the laughs.

1103
01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.470
Alright everybody,

1104
01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:49.770
thanks for listening to the podcasts and not please keep the questions coming

1105
01:09:49.771 --> 01:09:53.750
and if anybody knows how the fuck I'm supposed to hang up these Goddamn rinks,

1106
