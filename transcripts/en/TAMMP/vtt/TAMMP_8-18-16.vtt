I got in to,

24
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:29.250

It was a c.
This is the difference.

28
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:47.370
There's no stairs.
Whatever song that is,

52
00:03:28.611 --> 00:03:31.870
So I look like I'm going to go fucking compete against,

53
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.040
the dude with the Bong and the 400 meters.

54
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.340
I have not watched one second of the Olympics and I gotta tell Ya,

55
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.180
I don't feel like I'm missing anything.
You know,
I love about the Olympics.

56
00:03:42.181 --> 00:03:45.120
They get all this sports.
No one gives a fuck about out of the way.

57
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.800
Once every four years I already have.

the,
the board that that was,

64
00:04:12.111 --> 00:04:15.620
that was the first epic fail before Youtube even existed.

65
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.430
<v 2>Okay.</v>

66
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.160
<v 0>There was some gay guy diver who she had a problem with.</v>

67
00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:23.870
This junk would come flying out,
you know,
cause he had it so extras.

68
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.360
Fucking small evidently.
Or He's got a huge Dick.

69
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.100
Why are you talking about this fucking guy?
He said he's his manhood.

70
00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:34.710
Would we be doing that?
A little fucking Twizzlers.
They're in the air,

71
00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:37.910
whatever they call them.
He was gay.
He was gay man.

72
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.410
They said,
he said,
oh,

73
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.530
what is he gonna blow a guy in the platform as gay people?
They dive sometimes.

74
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.660
Some of them are architects.

75
00:04:48.661 --> 00:04:52.140
When are you gonna open your mind up to the fact that gay people could do all

76
00:04:52.141 --> 00:04:55.230
sorts of things?
She says,

77
00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.420
what's it like to be married to a fascist?
Hey,
um,

78
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.810
oh,
speaking of fascist,
you know what's fucking hilarious?

79
00:05:03.811 --> 00:05:05.100
I noticed over in Europe,

80
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.880
you get into a fascist come country and the elevators,

81
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.390
they don't play that game where it's starting to close and you stick your arm in

82
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:16.890
it.
They're just like on see what?
Too late.
And then he just like,
oh shit,

83
00:05:16.891 --> 00:05:21.450
this isn't chop my fucking arm off.
You're in the allied countries,
right?

84
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.620
The elevator starts to close.
You can kind of do the all Aa easy.
They're easy.

85
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.150
I decide not you dude.
Fucking Germany and Italy.

86
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.110
I made the mistake two times.
I tried to do the,
Oh yeah,

87
00:05:34.111 --> 00:05:37.860
let me stick my fucking arm in there.
And it quickly became like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

88
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.850
I was barely able to get an a.
Actually,
it started to open again.

89
00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:46.350
It does open back up,
but it's really aggressive,
really aggressive.

90
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.300
So anyways,
so went down there.

91
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.640
<v 2>Okay,</v>

92
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.410
<v 0>Trey,
tell him about your girlfriend there did,</v>

93
00:05:51.411 --> 00:05:56.120
you couldn't stop fucking staring at
Jesus Christ.

94
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.700
So it was definitely a,
it was definitely,

95
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:05.300
what would you say near European cut fucking swimsuits.

96
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.480
Tribute to fucking Brazil.

97
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.800
Straight up g string at that beach.

98
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.820
Sun's out.
I know.

99
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:20.330
I like how you kept trying to suddenly catcher and your fucking videos.

100
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:23.630
Now I this,
yes you did.
You're a fucking Harvard,

101
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.670
but because you're a woman,
you won't get called on.

102
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.350
You are a creep and I kill you.
Go to sleep.
Yes you are.

103
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.660
She was just married and looking
and I appreciate it.

104
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.310
Anyway,
so I go to,
I got to go swim in.

105
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.730
I go to go swim in the fucking Mediterranean.
I go in there,

106
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:51.320
first of all the waters,
you know,

107
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:53.810
it's a little more choppy and I'm more of a pool guy.
Okay.

108
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:57.830
There's no current in a pool.
And um,

109
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.060
I went in there and Jesus Christ,
my fucking,

110
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.610
the second I put those fucking goggles on,
I looked down,

111
00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:08.540
I saw these little fish swimming.
My brain leads,
it goes,
what's he,
what,

112
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.580
what he little fish.
Bigger fish,
right?
Like what's his face?

113
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.460
Uh,
Danny Devito in a one flew over the cuckoo's nest.

114
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.300
What do we do with these little fish?
And he smells,
he goes catch the big fish,

115
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:22.530
right?
And I just kept thinking bigger and bigger,

116
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.230
bigger fucking fish till I got the sharks.
And there was this little dad,

117
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.530
this little roped off area.

118
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.220
They had a little tarp there just in case one of these fucking monsters decided

119
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:32.054
to swim in.

120
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.440
But there was an open area because it was also bringing in these boats and I

121
00:07:36.441 --> 00:07:41.120
just pictured one of them like looking over
because where I was,

122
00:07:41.121 --> 00:07:42.080
you could see the bottom,

123
00:07:42.081 --> 00:07:46.970
but if you looked the creepiest looked ever when you're in the ocean or a c is

124
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.050
like out to sea or out to the ocean where,

125
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:53.511
you know,

126
00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:56.870
I'm glad you asked that in the end because that completely derails what the fuck

127
00:07:56.871 --> 00:08:01.250
I'm talking about.
I don't know what they are.
They're both gigantic.
So anyways,

128
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:02.803
um,

129
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.520
when you look out and it gets into deeper water and just becomes a darker blue

130
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:08.354
and disappears,

131
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.680
I just kept picturing one of those sharks just coming into view doing that

132
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:16.940
little fucking,
you know,
you know,
sharks swim with their fucking asses moving.

133
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.910
It's like the old rollerblade impression.
I do.

134
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:23.150
Neo and the people would set up the cones and they'd turn around backwards and

135
00:08:23.151 --> 00:08:28.070
the Ras would go was they went through the cones,
right?
That's how sharks swim.

136
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:31.370
Except they go frontwards.
I'm just picturing one of them fucking come in and

137
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.910
my heart was fucking racing.
Although you took video of me,

138
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.950
Neil was very impressed.
How I look when I swim.
I'm a good swimmer.

139
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.630
All freckles.
Two or 3 million people told you there's no sharks.

140
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:49.490
Okay,
well,
one time Carson told me and another person.
Okay,

141
00:08:49.491 --> 00:08:52.850
now let's look this up.
Okay,
let's look this up right now.

142
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:58.240
Sharks in the Mediterranean Sea in the where we are.

143
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.820
Oh yeah,
no,
I looked it up.
Like not only,

144
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.780
not only are they in the Mediterranean sees,

145
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.290
see the most attacks are off the coast of Italy.

146
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.340
So why are they all saying that there's no sharks?

147
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.690
Because this is a tourist trap near

148
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.950
where we're at is a fucking tourist trap.
Okay?

149
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:24.750
So they're just like that fucking guy.
He wants the beach is open and jaws.
Okay,

150
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:27.390
everybody's got to come down.
They've got to buy their magnets.

151
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:31.800
They gotta buy their fucking plates with lemons on it because this region is

152
00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:36.690
known for lemon,
so everything has to have lemons on it.
But I,

153
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.790
I'm telling you that every five minutes.
Like I say,
the food,
the food is bad.

154
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:46.791
Outstanding when they'll lemme Naddis I've been crazy little slushies.

155
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.720
Right.
Or I need this.
Oh my God.
I'm going a good time.

156
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:55.350
What about that fucking dessert we had the other night that looked like a

157
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:58.350
fucking titty.
It was like,

158
00:09:58.351 --> 00:10:00.960
it was like trace late Jake Cape,
but it was,

159
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:04.170
it was lemony and then on top of he had this cream and then for whatever reason,

160
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.000
yeah,
they put like this red look and something or other that look like a nipple.

161
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.660
Yeah.
It was a little milder.
It was delicious.

162
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.550
Who's the her now?

163
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.120
The second I said it look like a 10 year died.

164
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:22.380
Laughing is exactly what it looked like.
Not a real titty like a mannequin titty.

165
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.593
All right.

166
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:28.820
The 47 s the 47 shark species that lurk in the Mediterranean.

167
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.890
Okay.
And one of them.
Guess what?
It's the great white shark.
All right.

168
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.120
Shark attacks around the world map.
Let's look at this,

169
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.360
and when we all know in Australia,
someone gets taken as they say,

170
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:48.090
why we should worry,
why should we be worried about the rise in shark attacks?

171
00:10:48.091 --> 00:10:49.830
I love how they're going to blame the sharks.

172
00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:53.370
It's like maybe if we didn't fish out the ocean,
they'd have more food options.

173
00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:54.360
You stupid cons.

174
00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:00.290
A spike in shark attacks north and South Carolina's see one or two shark attacks

175
00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:03.750
per year.
On average in the last month,
there have been eight.

176
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.760
No one has been killed,
but there is no such thing as a casual shoe.

177
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:13.230
I don't know what this is.
2015
wait,
let me get to,

178
00:11:13.231 --> 00:11:15.180
let me get back to the Mediterranean Sea.

179
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.353
<v 3>MMM.</v>

180
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.330
<v 0>47 different types of species.</v>

181
00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.030
<v 3>Where the fuck are they?</v>

182
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:31.200
<v 0>How to survive a shark attack?
Stay on the land.
All right.
European countries,</v>

183
00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:35.730
number of shark attacks since 1900 number of fatal attacks,
number one,

184
00:11:35.731 --> 00:11:37.110
Nia,
Italy,

185
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:39.423
<v 3>50</v>

186
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:45.140
<v 0>11 have been fatal.
So basically every year and a half or so,</v>

187
00:11:45.141 --> 00:11:48.140
probably a little bit less,
somebody gets bit by a shark.

188
00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:52.400
Do you want to be that person?
I don't.
The UK had 38.
Nobody died.

189
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:57.340
Those tough pasty bastards spayed.
33,
seven people died.

190
00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:59.020
You knew people would die.
This so dramatic there,

191
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:00.670
especially when they play soccer.

192
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:06.030
Croatia 25 and then 12 people died on half the people bit off probation.

193
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.120
Almost half of them die.
That's because it's so fucking much.

194
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:16.090
Or they probably tried to fight the thick set of getting out of there.

195
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.630
I must break you.
I have no idea what people in Croatia like,

196
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:23.830
just anybody in eastern Europe to me is,
uh,
is Dolph Lundgren.

197
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.380
Alright.
Grease.
24 attacks.
13 people died.
France,

198
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:33.160
ten three people died.
Portugal a one died.

199
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.450
Multa five,
three.
Jesus Christ.
Russia,

200
00:12:37.451 --> 00:12:39.970
four zero.
Yeah.
You can't kill us best.

201
00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:43.150
It's a Montenegro.

202
00:12:43.151 --> 00:12:47.410
Three and two sharks found in the Mediterranean.
Angel Shark,

203
00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:52.060
angular rough shark and cat Sherrod basking sharks.
Big eyed six sixgills shark.

204
00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.510
Is that a nickname?
Big Guy Threat.

205
00:12:55.511 --> 00:13:00.220
Let's just get to the ones that everybody knows.
Blue Sharks.

206
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:05.850
A dusky shark hammerhead.
Yeah,
there's a nice one.
Yeah,
they're real friendly.

207
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.390
Greg.
White sharks.

208
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.390
<v 2>Okay.</v>

209
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.470
<v 0>Uh,
Maaco milk.
Sharp Notch Nurse Hound.</v>

210
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.350
<v 2>Okay.</v>

211
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.410
<v 0>Portuguese,
dogfish,
Sandbar Shark.
All right.</v>

212
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.200
A lot of these I guess are not that intimidating or at least they haven't gotten

213
00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:23.034
a shot.

214
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.170
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

215
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:28.340
<v 0>I mean what if like the great white shark media is just like white people where</v>

216
00:13:28.341 --> 00:13:30.950
they get all the good roles in shark movies.

217
00:13:30.951 --> 00:13:32.390
So that's why they made one about them.

218
00:13:32.391 --> 00:13:34.240
And then all these other ones are like the minorities.

219
00:13:34.241 --> 00:13:37.130
So no one ever hears about the sharp nose.
Seven Gill Shark.

220
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.000
What does that sound like to you as far as a person said Dominican rather,

221
00:13:41.001 --> 00:13:45.910
listen to me.
Zip Up my luggage.
Then here you read off a list of sharks,
you know,

222
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.340
that's really me.
It's not supportive.
Huh?

223
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:51.921
Were you talking about,

224
00:13:51.921 --> 00:13:55.900
he fucking said there's no sharps or shark attacks and there is any like,
boom,

225
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.530
the people here go so sure could tech.

226
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.740
What do you think they're going to say near you?

227
00:14:00.741 --> 00:14:03.380
Think they're going to stand down.
They go on,
get out of the water.

228
00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.980
Freaking everybody out.
I'm standing there and the Little Speedo,

229
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:09.980
oh Jesus Christ.

230
00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.600
We saw some fucking people that needed to be in a bathing suit and we saw some

231
00:14:14.601 --> 00:14:17.600
people that did not need,
did not need,

232
00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.670
and I'd forgotten about that one guy.

233
00:14:19.671 --> 00:14:23.270
And you fucking brought him up again at dinner.
Hairy ass.

234
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.480
Oh my good God.
All fucking mighty.

235
00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.500
It's one of the most horrific fucking things I've ever seen.
A lot of hair.

236
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:32.440
<v 2>A lot of hair.</v>

237
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:33.401
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

238
00:14:33.401 --> 00:14:38.230
He had like a taint afro coming out of the bottom of his fucking stupid ass

239
00:14:38.231 --> 00:14:42.760
shorts just standing right in front of us.
It's like when you get,

240
00:14:42.761 --> 00:14:43.790
did you say Taf?
Tafforeau

241
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.290
Ah,
God.
So anyways,
I've been out of the,
uh,

242
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.180
I've been out of the country for awhile and I found out from another American

243
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:58.420
here,
this guy from Chicago,
they're Milan.

244
00:14:58.421 --> 00:15:01.160
Lou Cheech got traded to the Edmonton Oilers.

245
00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:03.993
Fuck you.

246
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.070
I didn't know that you got a seven year contract,
you know,

247
00:15:09.071 --> 00:15:12.280
they get some young talent over there.
So then I'm like,
well,

248
00:15:12.281 --> 00:15:15.550
who did the brewing side like a fucking dope.

249
00:15:15.551 --> 00:15:19.420
Like how many times do I have to get excited about who the Boston Bruins are

250
00:15:19.421 --> 00:15:21.580
going to say?
I know who they're going to sign.

251
00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:27.040
They're going to sign a bunch of fucking nobodies like they always do because

252
00:15:27.041 --> 00:15:30.160
the ghosts to Harry sending still in there and they don't want to spend any

253
00:15:30.161 --> 00:15:34.600
fucking money ever.
Can we ever go out and pick up a superstar?

254
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.553
We never do.

255
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:40.560
We always go out and get six really good people and then a couple of people like

256
00:15:41.171 --> 00:15:45.540
who the fuck are they?
So we signed some fucking,
I dunno,

257
00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:47.640
we signed some goaltender.

258
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.040
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

259
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.940
<v 0>we signed this kid from St Louis.
He seem decent.</v>

260
00:15:51.941 --> 00:15:55.850
He scored 20 [inaudible] goals.
30 something goals at one point.

261
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.680
Well we ever signed a 50 goals score.
Nia.
Huh?
I hope so.

262
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.460
No,
never do that.
Pk Sue band comes along.

263
00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:06.640
We ever going to fucking sign a guy like no.

264
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.950
The only time we get a guy like that is if we get lucky.
You know,

265
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:14.070
nobody knew fucking CIARA was.
No one knew who the fuck he was.

266
00:16:14.071 --> 00:16:14.791
And when we sign him,

267
00:16:14.791 --> 00:16:19.791
he was just this big six foot seven fucking goof tripping over himself in the,

268
00:16:19.861 --> 00:16:23.250
in the,
in the,
in the capital of Canada up there in Ottawa.
Right.

269
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.700
And everybody up there and autumn weather is so God damn quiet and forgiving.

270
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.870
It's,
it's,
it's a transient fucking state.
Nobody's from Ottawa.

271
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:35.580
You go there and you try to push your legislation through to for the fucking

272
00:16:35.581 --> 00:16:38.730
syrup bill,
whatever the fuck it is that people go do up there.

273
00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:41.400
And they had no idea what this guy was.
And we got him and he was a steel,

274
00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.690
I can't remember the last fucking time.

275
00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.140
The Boston Bruins went out and signed a fucking sniper.

276
00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:50.780
<v 2>Okay.</v>

277
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.280
<v 0>I can tell you this.
So we,</v>

278
00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:55.460
we've given away more of those fucking guys in my life.

279
00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.340
Joe Thornton.
Yeah.

280
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:01.370
Get the fuck out here at Tyler's Sag and get the fuck outta here.

281
00:17:01.371 --> 00:17:02.840
Get the fuck Outta here.

282
00:17:02.841 --> 00:17:06.440
That's what constantly sending 40 goal scorers.

283
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:11.030
Tell him to pack their bags.
And we always questioned that toughness.
Oh,

284
00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:14.480
there's some rumor about their partying and it's fucking bullshit.

285
00:17:14.481 --> 00:17:17.600
At the end of the fucking day,
you know what it is.
We don't want to pay him.

286
00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:20.400
We don't want to pay him there.

287
00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:23.640
I swear to God the Bruins ever went on fucking vacation.

288
00:17:23.641 --> 00:17:27.090
If the franchise went on vacation,
they,
they'd rent a fucking trailer.

289
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.600
That's what they would do.
Wow.
Of all,
why should we pay for a fucking hotel room?

290
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.980
You know,
this is,
this keeps us driving,
but one more fucking

291
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:36.910
when brains out in has a roof.

292
00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.730
I can't remember last time I was excited about anybody they fucking sign,
but,

293
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:46.110
but every fucking summer I'm like,
we got rid of that guy.

294
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.170
How under the fucking are we?
I don't have any of these fucking numbers,

295
00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:55.760
by the way.

The sabers site and see Kyle a poser.

299
00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.540
I don't know the Pozo or no idea this guy is,

300
00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:10.090
I have no idea where any of these fucking people are.
Maybe that's what it is.

301
00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.700
Maybe I should shut the fuck up is I don't know who anybody is anymore.

302
00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.240
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

303
00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.930
<v 0>Let's see.
Calgary flames signed a bunch of nobodies.</v>

304
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.780
Ah,

306
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:30.740
Transylvanian names.
Even if they're good.

307
00:18:30.741 --> 00:18:33.920
I mean they have to score like 900 goals before you finally know how to say

308
00:18:33.921 --> 00:18:37.490
their name.
At least me anyways.
Oh good.

309
00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:40.040
Did you sign Jordan to too?
That's a name.

312
00:18:46.641 --> 00:18:51.380
too much for the fucking who gives a shit last night.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.460
What was that story?

Carl weathers.
He ate the Schnitzel,

329

337
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:23.070
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

338
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.690
<v 0>Case you don't have to spell four hour.
Um,</v>

339
00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:28.900
so I guess he interviews a bunch of successful people and then uh,

340
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.300
they give you their secrets and then you apply them to your life.

341
00:20:31.301 --> 00:20:35.140
And next thing you know whose,
whose face is on the cover of the cereal box.
Oh,

342
00:20:35.141 --> 00:20:40.110
I think that show.
Alright.
Helix.
Everybody Helux you're,

343
00:20:40.111 --> 00:20:41.110
you're unique.

344
00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.760
You don't walk like everyone else talk like everyone else.

345
00:20:45.761 --> 00:20:47.050
So sleep like everyone,

346
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.340
you don't go to a baseball game and sit in the bleachers and no one has any

347
00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:55.210
fucking idea whether you're there or not.
You're special.
So,

348
00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:00.630
so why is your mattress one size fits all you stand out in the crowd is you sit

349
00:21:00.851 --> 00:21:04.720
there and your sweat pants eating a slice of pizza in Manhattan.

350
00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.190
They made that city for you.

351
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:12.060
So why are you sleeping on a mattress that is made for your average run of the

352
00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:16.180
mill fucking animal?
I know why.
I don't know why,

353
00:21:16.181 --> 00:21:17.920
but this next line explains why.

354
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:23.070
Because a truly customized mattress will cost you five to 10,000 bucks until

355
00:21:23.291 --> 00:21:25.900
now.
Is that how much they cost?
Well,

356
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.910
I guess that's why I sleep on a regular mattress.

357
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.590
Why would you spend five to 10 grand on something?
You just gonna.

358
00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:33.310
You know you're not even gonna remember being on it.

359
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:36.223
<v 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

360
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:41.690
<v 0>Five [inaudible].
What would you do with five to $10,000?
Oh,</v>

361
00:21:41.691 --> 00:21:45.860
she has her headphones on.
She can't hear me.
Nia,
I'm way smarter than you.

362
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:50.390
You're a dumb person.
And you lucked out when you met me.
Hey Sweetie,

363
00:21:50.391 --> 00:21:54.320
how you doing?
You're so gorgeous.
And everyone in the podcast message.
No,

364
00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:58.100
you didn't go to go to helix.
Sleep dot.
Tom.

365
00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:02.840
Answer a few simple questions.
And the helots smart guy,
Alex,

366
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:07.980
and they'll run it.
Is it?
Yes.

367
00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.780
Oh my God.
How do you know?
Because that's how the word is.
Now,

368
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:16.700
how do I know there was a fucking band?
There was a ban in the 80s called Helix.

369
00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:18.930
I guarantee you bill,

370
00:22:18.931 --> 00:22:22.380
it's not the pronunciation of the abandoned the eighties and no one's fucking

371
00:22:22.381 --> 00:22:23.214
heard of.

372
00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.080
<v 2>Well,
you're in a mode,
Huh?</v>

373
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.790
<v 0>Dota Helix,</v>

374
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:34.820
sleep.com answer a few simple questions and they'll run a three d biomechanical

375
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:35.810
model of your yeah.

376
00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:40.370
Body through the proprietary algorithms they developed with the help of the

377
00:22:40.371 --> 00:22:43.370
world's leading irrigant nomics and biomechanics experts.

378
00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.370
All I knew no is they just need a,
you know,
at this,

379
00:22:46.371 --> 00:22:48.080
this is what this side businesses,

380
00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.830
they take this computer mold to your body,
right?

381
00:22:51.831 --> 00:22:55.550
So they figured out what kind of mattress should do and then they sell the mold

382
00:22:55.551 --> 00:22:58.460
to Asia and they make those fucking sex suits.

383
00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.300
And then there's somebody over there fucking the,

384
00:23:00.301 --> 00:23:04.820
the the mattress version of you.
That's what they,

385
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.450
that's what they're doing over there and it's an issue of national security.

386
00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.660
That's why we need to elect Trump.

387
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:15.330
Do you know over in Asia

388
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:23.450
are fucking a cadaver version of yourself right now they're laughing at us and

389
00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:25.380
they're charging us to do it.

390
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.050
<v 2>Okay.</v>

391
00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:27.550
<v 0>If I became president,</v>

392
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:31.680
there would be no more Asians fucking mattress versions of Americans,

393
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.840
but I try and make it great again.

394
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:38.410
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

395
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:42.290
<v 0>well,
track or dozer work,
I could grow it again.
The result,</v>

396
00:23:42.291 --> 00:23:44.690
the most comfortable mattress you've ever slept on.

397
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:49.460
Helix customers report a 30% improvement in overall sleep quality.

398
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:54.080
How do you even realize that you're asleep and for couples they customize each

399
00:23:54.081 --> 00:23:56.570
side of the mattress.
What do you have better dreams.

400
00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.920
Your mattress arrives at your door in about a week and shipping is 100% free

401
00:24:00.921 --> 00:24:04.160
with them.
If they take a fucking moldy a body and they crank it out that fast.

402
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:09.590
That's why everyone from Gq magazine to Forbes are all talking about helix
sleep.

403
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.060
You have a hundred nights to try it out roast,

All right.

Originally founded by two broke college kids.

447
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.980
Not to be confused by two broke girls,

448
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:07.700
which I started watching with Nia and I can't even begin to tell you how

449
00:27:07.701 --> 00:27:09.410
soothing both of their voices are.

450
00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:17.030
I swear to God,
if you head on a movement watch while watching two broke girls,

451
00:27:17.031 --> 00:27:17.360
I would,

452
00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:21.830
I would not be surprised if it during the punchlines and they'd started to come

453
00:27:21.831 --> 00:27:24.410
apart.
Um,
all right.

454
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.800
Originally founded by two broke college kid movement watches cut out the

458
00:27:41.091 --> 00:27:44.240
minimalistic and modern twist on a classic style.

Hey,
what are you doing on the Internet?</v>

467
00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:18.070
Oh,
I follow this watch company that just can't get enough of it.

468
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:22.420
My favorite days is when they have a new watch that comes out and I get to see

469
00:28:22.421 --> 00:28:27.280
how they attach the strap to the face.
Oh,
really?
That's,

470
00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:31.630
that makes me never want to talk to you again.
Well,
that's,
maybe that's the deal.

471
00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:32.860
Maybe that's the brilliance of it.

472
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.020
That's a good thing to say on a first date and then you don't want to be the

473
00:28:37.021 --> 00:28:39.540
Dick to say you don't want to have a second date.

474
00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.000
Maybe you invite her up for a second day going,
hey,

475
00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:46.900
you want to fucking come over to my apartment in,
watch the goings on.

Oh,
Bill,
that's disgusting.
Oh,
is it?</v>

483
00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.350
Well,
I'm sorry you're not an adult.
Well,

484
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.710
here's something I came across on the Internet,
so you know,
it's gotta be true.

485
00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.370
I'm just going through all these countries and shit.

486
00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:14.230
I don't even know how I got there.
Like each night I come home,
I'm totally like,

487
00:29:14.231 --> 00:29:15.130
you know,
I'm asleep.

488
00:29:15.131 --> 00:29:18.880
I've had a couple glasses of wine and the next morning I wake up when I see the

489
00:29:18.881 --> 00:29:22.960
windows that I'm open to going.
When the fuck was I looking at that?
Like,

490
00:29:22.961 --> 00:29:26.710
for some reason I went,
I started reading up on Leon Spinks.

491
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:28.913
<v 3>MMM.</v>

492
00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.440
<v 0>Oh,
you know why?
I know why?
Cause I fucking,
the other night I was watching,</v>

493
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.390
<v 3>uh,
when,
uh,</v>

494
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:40.970
<v 0>George Foreman fought Ron Lyle and I got to tell you what's his,</v>

495
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.220
it's like a rocky fight,
right?
Howard Cosell,

496
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:50.890
Howard Cosell is in rare form.
He just shits on everybody.

497
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.810
The fight starts and he goes,
ah,
lunging almost amateur wrist,

498
00:29:55.811 --> 00:30:00.310
right hand from the challenger for Ron Lyle and whoever the fuck he's doing the

499
00:30:00.311 --> 00:30:02.410
fight with,
he can't think it's Ken Norton.

500
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:06.520
He reminds him like seven times during that fight that George Foreman knocked

501
00:30:06.521 --> 00:30:10.510
him out.
I thought at one point that what's his face was going to punch out.

502
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.630
He just never gave into it.
But he just goes,

503
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:18.250
I would not describe this as an artistic endeavor or something,

504
00:30:18.251 --> 00:30:22.090
a boxing exit exposition.
This is not,
you've got to watch it.

505
00:30:22.091 --> 00:30:24.970
It's an incredible fight.
But anyway,
so,
um,

506
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:30.630
last night I started,
uh,
I dunno,

507
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:35.410
maybe I was reading about Quentin Tarantino and I got into fucking,
uh,

508
00:30:35.411 --> 00:30:39.970
inglorious bastards.
And I don't know if this is true or not,

509
00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:43.120
but evidently after the fucking war,
right,

510
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:47.360
and the world saw what the fucking Nazis did.
They were like,
well,

511
00:30:47.361 --> 00:30:48.580
someone's got to pay for this.

512
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:53.260
They had the Nuremberg trials and all they did was they basically,

513
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:58.800
I dunno,
it's an amount of,
do about 24 individuals,
God punished,

514
00:30:58.801 --> 00:31:01.690
some got life imprisonment,
some got put to death,
the whatever.

515
00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:05.920
And they say it takes more than 24 people to kill 6 million,
obviously.
Right.

516
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:11.190
So basically the amount of the fucking headache it was to bring these guys to

517
00:31:12.881 --> 00:31:15.730
trial and go through all the bullshit and put together the cases.

518
00:31:15.731 --> 00:31:19.630
They just said that that's it.
That's too fucking big.
There's too many God damn.

519
00:31:19.631 --> 00:31:24.340
People were also carving up the con country and we need these cuts to work for

520
00:31:24.341 --> 00:31:29.200
us.
So the allies kind of washed their hands of it.
At which point?
Um,

521
00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.710
some hardcore fucking Jewish people.

522
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:37.630
The uh,
w what's,
what's that Matt Damon character near,

523
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:41.320
he comes out with it every once in a while he had the gun in the fucking lady

524
00:31:41.321 --> 00:31:41.681
was like,

525
00:31:41.681 --> 00:31:45.100
get the gun out of the poster because that's what makes people use guns.

526
00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:50.170
Jason Bourne.
That was one of the dumbest things I've ever seen in my life.

527
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:54.790
Get that gun off of that movie poster.
Yeah,
that'll solve the problem.

528
00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:56.650
That's what it was.

529
00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.180
I remember when Star Wars came out and all these little kids went out and got

530
00:32:02.181 --> 00:32:05.530
the fucking light sabers and all that shit.
I mean,
good for that person,

531
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:10.600
fairly taking the time to really address the issue and not make it about

532
00:32:10.601 --> 00:32:14.320
themselves.
Um,
alright,
plowing ahead here.

533
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:19.030
So this group of a Jason Bourne,

534
00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:21.340
Jewish people got together and they're like,
you know what?

535
00:32:21.341 --> 00:32:25.300
I don't think I'm satisfied with 24 of these nuts.
He counts going down.

536
00:32:25.301 --> 00:32:27.730
And then allegedly they were like,

537
00:32:27.731 --> 00:32:31.600
this fucking hit squad going around the fucking world.

538
00:32:31.601 --> 00:32:34.750
Just fuck tracking these fucking people down.
And uh,

539
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:39.040
haven't kangaroo court trials in fucking executing them.

540
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.920
Um,
I don't know if the shit is true.

541
00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.340
It was such an amazing fucking story that I can't believe that if it was

542
00:32:46.341 --> 00:32:48.830
actually true,
why this wouldn't have seen the light of day.

543
00:32:48.831 --> 00:32:51.590
These guys actually went to the point,
one person,

544
00:32:51.591 --> 00:32:53.330
they said they showed up to eat,

545
00:32:53.331 --> 00:32:57.500
killed over 100,000 fucking people and they gave him a,
a rope.

546
00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:02.170
All right.
And they let him,
do they say that and let him do the dcis?

547
00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:04.080
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

548
00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.720
<v 0>Was it Elkins describes how,

549
00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:11.250
I'm going to fuck all these words up.

550
00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:12.290

552
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.720
One Alexander lack responsible for the deaths of 100,000 Jews at the Estonian

553
00:33:20.991 --> 00:33:22.310
concentration camp.

554
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:26.300
They waited for lax wife to leave on a cinema trip.

555
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:28.130
You mean go to the movies,

556
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:33.290
then confronted him with the crimes and their intended punishment and let him do

557
00:33:33.291 --> 00:33:35.750
the decent thing and take his own life with the rope.

558
00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:39.500
What deaf and what do they stage it like?
He was jerking off.

559
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:41.300
I gotta look this guy up.

560
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.540
They were one point we're going to try to poison the fucking water and just

561
00:33:44.541 --> 00:33:48.470
indiscriminately kill a bunch of fucking German people that the same way that

562
00:33:48.471 --> 00:33:51.360
they had killed a bunch of Jewish people.
Um,

563
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.250
<v 2>okay.</v>

564
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:55.100
<v 0>I want to know why.
Why?</v>

565
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:58.760
There hasn't been a bunch of shit talking about this.
If this actually happened.

566
00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:03.930
Me Look,
this guy,

567
00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:05.910

<v 0>Alexander lack what's,

569
00:34:08.041 --> 00:34:13.041
Let's see if his wife went to go visit the cinema and he took his own life with

570
00:34:13.291 --> 00:34:14.124

<v 0>No,</v>

573
00:34:15.391 --> 00:34:18.090
but then they said that they all did it and they kept their mouth shut about it.

574
00:34:18.091 --> 00:34:21.030
So then how the fuck would I know about it?
But then again,

575
00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:24.180
somebody took the time to type it,
so like,

576
00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.100
doesn't that mean it happened?

577
00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:27.550
<v 2>Okay.</v>

578
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:28.740
<v 0>All right.
Here we go.</v>

579
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:31.580
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

580
00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.530
<v 0>All right.
Jesus.
Doesn't these guys all look fucking evil?
Yeah.</v>

581
00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:39.720
A concentration camp commander,
he's got a Wikipedia page,

582
00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:44.520
was the lieutenant and the commander,
the German occupation of Astonia,

583
00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:49.560
the estimates for number of Jews killed is widely varied.
Uh,

584
00:34:49.561 --> 00:34:53.160
the Soviet investigators reached the conclusion that two to 3000 were killed,

585
00:34:53.161 --> 00:34:54.540
but God knows they didn't like juice.

586
00:34:54.541 --> 00:34:58.260
So that's probably add a zero to all of that at least.
Uh,

587
00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:02.240
but the number 5,000 as determined by extraordinary state commission,

588
00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:06.630
1944 was written into verdict in modern sources.
The number is 10,000.

589
00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:10.530
Some commentators have also given figures ranging from a hundred thousand to

590
00:35:10.531 --> 00:35:13.830
125,000 to 300,000.
However,

591
00:35:13.831 --> 00:35:16.550
such figures contradict the findings in the stonier.

592
00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:21.840
Blahblahblahblahblah Alexander lack was also known to have a range drunken

593
00:35:21.841 --> 00:35:24.630
orgies with inmates.
Ah,
Jesus.

594
00:35:24.631 --> 00:35:29.631
He emigrated to Canada after World War II in 1948 and 1960 was implicated in the

595
00:35:31.381 --> 00:35:36.381
holocaust trials in Soviet dystonia and exposed as living in a naturalized

596
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:42.210
citizen under the name Alex lack in Winnipeg,
Canada.
Okay.

597
00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:44.560
Thereafter,

598
00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:50.230
after reading of arrests of young Vic Ralph Perez from mass killing him,

599
00:35:50.231 --> 00:35:54.430
mostly jurors dream sage while under Nazi ossification and being himself

600
00:35:54.431 --> 00:35:56.050
identified as a mass murder.

601
00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:00.580
He apparently committed suicide by hanging himself in the garage of his home at

602
00:36:00.581 --> 00:36:03.590
53 Ah,

603
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:08.890
Israeli journalist claimed at LACC was in fact confronted one day after his wife

604
00:36:08.891 --> 00:36:12.010
had left their house to go to the movies.
All right,

605
00:36:12.011 --> 00:36:16.450
so this indiscriminate website that I have no idea if it's true or not lines up

606
00:36:16.451 --> 00:36:21.220
with his Wikipedia page.
So I'm going to say,
I want to say this is true

607
00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.960
and I want to,
is there a book I can read on this?

608
00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.090
Who doesn't like a good vengeance story?

609
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:29.750
<v 2>Okay,</v>

610
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:30.650
<v 0>that's amazing.</v>

611
00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:34.250
And just coming up on these fucking creeps they had to have known when you do

612
00:36:34.251 --> 00:36:35.150
some shit like that,

613
00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:37.790
you got every night when you got to be looking at down the driveway,

614
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.130
even if you were in the middle of fucking Winnipeg,

615
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:44.490
but if ever you would ever feel safe,
you'd think Winnipeg.
I gotta go fucking,

616
00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.780
what the fuck's going to go to Winnipeg?
You know,

617
00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.410
Thunder Bay yellow knife.

618
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:53.290
<v 2>Okay.</v>

619
00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:57.460
<v 0>Jesus fucking Christ.
Man,
that's gotta be a rough one.
I said,
say he did that.</v>

620
00:36:57.461 --> 00:37:00.970
Let's just say he killed two to 3000 people and forced them half orgies.

621
00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:04.300
When you're taking your own life,
you've gotta be thinking like,
please God,

622
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:08.320
don't let the be evil.
If you said God,
you believe in it,
I'd be like,

623
00:37:08.321 --> 00:37:12.850
please don't let there be an afterlife cause I am going,

624
00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:16.480
I'm going to the basement there.
Alright,
that's the podcast.

625
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:21.340
Just checking in on you guys.
Um,
don't get everybody that's listening.
By the way,

626
00:37:21.341 --> 00:37:24.970
I took over near snapchat yesterday.
Um,

627
00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:27.640
I don't know if it's going to disappear by then.
Uh,

628
00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:29.830
I had sort of a good time doing it.

629
00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.070
I hated the whole fucking thing I hit on yet 10 seconds to say what the fuck he

630
00:37:33.071 --> 00:37:37.750
had to say that that was annoying.
What'd you say?
Yeah.

631
00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:40.530
Why should I do it again?
People love it.

632
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:47.260
Once you get into the feel of it will be really great at.
Um,
yeah,
but I mean,

633
00:37:47.261 --> 00:37:49.600
I could probably say the same thing about changing a tire,

634
00:37:49.601 --> 00:37:54.250
but I don't want to be a fucking AAA guy.
Right.
That made no sense.

635
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:57.820
Okay.
That's it for the checking in on you.
A joy.

636
00:37:57.821 --> 00:37:59.800
This little music here and uh,

637
00:37:59.801 --> 00:38:04.120
then we'll give you some greatest hits from Monday morning.
Pause.
Cat's gone by.

638
00:38:04.121 --> 00:38:06.760
As always,

If you ever go to Amazon going,
hey,

640
00:38:10.391 --> 00:38:13.180
I think I'm going to buy myself a craftmatic adjustable bed.

641
00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.510
Just go by the bill burr website first bill bird.com.

642
00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:21.490
Click on the podcast page is an Amazon link.
Okay.
It'll take you right to Amazon.

643

It doesn't cost you any extra money.
I just get credit for driving traffic there.

644
00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:29.260
Okay.
If you'd like to do what?
I appreciate it.
If you don't,

645
00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:33.400
Have a great weekend and I'll talk to you on Monday then.
All right.

646
00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:11.123
<v 4>Gil Dead.</v>

647
00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:26.123
Okay.

648
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:41.083
Oh,

649
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.140
hey,
what's up?
It's still bar.

650
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:11.390
<v 5>Uh,
this is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

651
00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:17.150
August the 18th.
And uh,
this is my second,

652
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:20.030
my second time recording this podcast.

653
00:40:20.031 --> 00:40:25.031
I did one this morning from Miami International Airport and uh,

654
00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:28.610
there was some sort of tropical storms,
so I dunno what the fuck happened.

655
00:40:28.611 --> 00:40:32.510
I babbled for a half an hour.
I said fuck a lot.

656
00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:36.830
It was a woman looked like she was a mother.

657
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:39.680
She was two seats away from me.
I felt bad,

658
00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:45.010
but I continued to plow through it because it was a good podcast and then I went

659
00:40:45.231 --> 00:40:48.140
to save it in the fucking thing.
Didn't save.
I don't know what happened.

660
00:40:48.141 --> 00:40:52.700
I think that everybody was trying to dial out because it was a tropical storm,

661
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.750
which basically means,
oh my God,
it's,
it's raining.

662
00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:00.650
No,
it's,
it's like really rain.

663
00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:06.300
If it's like seriously raining to fucking tropical storm,

664
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.120
I don't know.
You know what I mean?

665
00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:11.960
I got off the plane and I saw some news clips of it,
you know,

666
00:41:11.961 --> 00:41:14.420
they always show the deepest puddle,
you know what I mean?

667
00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.980
Then they try and act like a,
the whole place is like that.
So anyways,

668
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.730
I'm sitting in my Prius,
uh,

669
00:41:22.731 --> 00:41:26.270
down the street from my apartment right now because,
uh,

670
00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:30.500
I was going to go out and get tasks and then I realized they have a new law,

671
00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:30.681
you know,

672
00:41:30.681 --> 00:41:35.120
that you can't drive around with your fucking cell phone up to your ear or you

673
00:41:35.121 --> 00:41:39.740
get a ticket,
you know.
So,
uh,
you know what,

674
00:41:39.741 --> 00:41:43.970
I really had an urge to get rims on my car.
You know,

675
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:48.230
these,
uh,
I dunno if you guys are all familiar with the Prius.

676
00:41:48.231 --> 00:41:51.530
Looks like it's basically,
it's the fucking greatest car in the world.

677
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:56.030
I totally recommend it.
If you want to point a to point B,

678
00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:01.030
you know,
you don't want any whores hanging on.
Yeah,
this is the car.

679
00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:02.810
No,
I'm serious,
man.
It's a fucking great car.

680
00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:08.170
The only thing that sucks about it is it has these little breath saver fucking

681
00:42:09.291 --> 00:42:13.880
tires and rims and it's,
it's starting to affect my manhood.

682
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:17.630
You know what I mean?
It's just,
you know,

683
00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.220
and this isn't even like,
you know,
who's got the biggest dick kind of thing.

684
00:42:22.221 --> 00:42:23.840
It's just more of a,
you know,

685
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:28.850
you don't want to have training wheels on your car,
you know,

686
00:42:28.851 --> 00:42:30.140
for fucking training wheels.

687
00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:35.180
So I think I can get eighteens on these.
Fuck you.

688
00:42:35.181 --> 00:42:36.950
It's respectable.
The hybrid or right.

689
00:42:36.951 --> 00:42:39.500
That's equal to whatever you got on your fucking SUV.

690
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:43.160
We didn't have makes you more of a man.
Ooh,
I got a big fucking truck.

691
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:47.780
Like I couldn't afford that least that given those things away,

692
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:49.770
I could,

693
00:42:49.771 --> 00:42:53.210
I could drive one and a half without a fucking suburban right now if I want it

694
00:42:53.211 --> 00:42:57.140
to.
I just choose not to.
This is a choice.
All right.

695
00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:01.730
Do you know what I'm saying?
It's really affecting,
it's affecting myself esteem.

696
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.000
Anyways.
If you new to my page,

697
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.100
if you're still on my space and you haven't defected to fucking Facebook,

698
00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:14.890
which by the way,
I guess when you fill out the information thing over there,

699
00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.980
the list,
the reason why I'm not on it,
if you decide to be like,
hey,

700
00:43:18.981 --> 00:43:23.720
fuck Facebook in the future,
um,
they'll like,
well,
hey,
fuck you.

701
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.480
You can't delete your page.

702
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:29.720
We'll take the page off and we'll keep all the personal information about you.

703
00:43:29.721 --> 00:43:30.980
And I don't know what they're gonna do with it.

704
00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:35.410
And that gets my conspiracy fucking head going.
And the funny thing is,

705
00:43:35.411 --> 00:43:37.640
is I've never looked at the small print,
but my space,

706
00:43:37.641 --> 00:43:42.590
whether they do the shit too,
but,
uh,
I don't know what's going on here.

707
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:45.770
It's all leading towards the microchip in the back of your fucking head,

708
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:49.220
I'm telling you.
But,
uh,
anyways,
if you do it on my page,

709
00:43:49.221 --> 00:43:52.730
I do one of these every fucking week,
sometimes twice a week.

710
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:57.110
If there's a tropical storm,
I'm in the airport that I'm in.

711
00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:01.850
Um,
basically last week I worked the Improv in Miami,

712
00:44:01.851 --> 00:44:06.200
Florida.
I had a great time and I gotta tell you,
man,

713
00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:11.900
Miami is,
that's just the town that you're supposed to fucking,

714
00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.660
I can't even,
I can't even explain it.

715
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:19.400
It's just the hottest fucking women I've ever seen in my life.
It's,

716
00:44:19.401 --> 00:44:20.234
you know what it is?
It's,

717
00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.750
it's like a city that's moving forward so it has that energy,

718
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:29.080
but then it also has that laid back Caribbean vibe and all these fucking hot ass

719
00:44:31.501 --> 00:44:34.170
Cuban women walking around,
whatever the fuck you want.

720
00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:35.850
It's walking around down there

721
00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:41.760
with a fat ass and thick size and that God damn half a dress on.

722
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:42.601
It's ridiculous.

723
00:44:42.601 --> 00:44:46.830
You literally have to rub one out before you leave your fucking apartment for

724
00:44:46.831 --> 00:44:48.860
the comedy Condo,
whatever the Hell I was staying,

725
00:44:48.861 --> 00:44:52.770
just so you can get to the damn comedy club.
So,
uh,

726
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:58.740
I had a good time down there.
I definitely had a good fucking time.
And,
uh,

727
00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:02.100
I dunno,
you know what,

728
00:45:02.101 --> 00:45:05.400
I actually quit drinking when I was down there cause I went out Thursday night

729
00:45:05.401 --> 00:45:06.560
and it's just,
uh,

730
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:11.210
I met up with this couple who I partied with before and they didn't know that

731
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:14.940
wasn't drinking whiskey anymore because as I've said,
another podcast,

732
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:18.350
it's the fucking devil juice.
So after the show they had,

733
00:45:18.351 --> 00:45:21.810
they had a Jamison set up for me and I didn't want to be rude.

734
00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:26.060
Cause when you don't accept the drink from people,
sometimes they,
you know,

735
00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.590
they get a little psycho like that dude and Columbus.

736
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:30.900
You know what I'm talking about guys,

737
00:45:30.901 --> 00:45:34.790
the funny bone and fucking freaked out when I wouldn't drink the drink.
Um,
yeah,

738
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.190
they get all like,
oh well what do you,
what are you too big?
You're too big now.

739
00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:42.420
Oh you,
you can't,
you can't drink the fucking,
I'm not drinking asshole.

740
00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:46.260
We Times I've got to say,
I appreciate you coming out to my show.

741
00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:48.750
It took a picture with you.
I signed the fucking CD.

742
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:52.260
I listen to you tell me some stories.
Well,
what else do I gotta do?

743
00:45:52.261 --> 00:45:55.560
I gotta get a NIB related with you.
So anyways,

744
00:45:55.830 --> 00:46:00.090
that was the dude in Columbus and to do with a couple of Miami,
so whatever.

745
00:46:00.091 --> 00:46:01.920
So they gave me a Jamison.
I drank that Jamieson,

746
00:46:01.921 --> 00:46:03.780
of course you've got to wash it down with a Budweiser.

747
00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:07.590
And then I find out the dude manages a bar and you can get free drinks and then

748
00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:10.800
it's fucking on.
Okay.

749
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:12.960
And I remember going into the bar,

750
00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:19.080
but I don't remember leaving and I had to do radio the next day,
so

751
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:24.360
I'm just too fucking old to be doing it.
So I,
I,
I'm on the wagon.

752
00:46:24.361 --> 00:46:28.830
I'm not like fucking going to meetings or anything.
Like I'm taking a break.

753
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:29.993
You know what I mean?

754
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:33.330
You don't want to get to that point your life where you're just like,
wow,

755
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:36.840
am I in this room again?
Am I really,

756
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:40.500
really the fucking chick with the red wine breadth is now breathing.
Really.

757
00:46:40.501 --> 00:46:44.400
This is happening again.
Again.
Oh,
the guy on coke,
this room.

758
00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:47.940
I've been in this room.
I hate this room.

759
00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:52.860
How many fucking times am I going to walk in here before I realized I,

760
00:46:52.861 --> 00:46:55.440
you know,
stupid.

761
00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:01.780
[inaudible]
all right.
Anyways,
so anyways,
this is the Monday morning podcast.
Ah,

762
00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.030
I answered questions.

763
00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:07.410
I got a new segment on here called underrated overrated that people are really

764
00:47:07.411 --> 00:47:09.590
responding to.
Um,

765
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:14.630
and it's basically you just send me your list of stuff that you see in life or

766
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:18.030
on television and pop culture and your own personal life.

767
00:47:18.031 --> 00:47:22.260
Can you send me your list of Shit that you think is underrated or overrated?

768
00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:25.740
I even know how this fucking segment started.
It was really organic,

769
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:30.190
which is why I like it and people are actually very rarely even sending me

770
00:47:30.191 --> 00:47:31.210
questions anymore.

771
00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:37.540
They're just more kind of sending these lists of shit here.

772
00:47:37.541 --> 00:47:38.710
But before I get into that,

773
00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:42.730
now that I've already babbled for fucking eight minutes,
eight seconds,

774
00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:46.740
uh,
let me just,
let me just whore myself out really quickly.
Um,

775
00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:50.530
if you look at the top of my page,
I have a new special coming out called,

776
00:47:50.531 --> 00:47:55.480
why do I do this?
It's going to be on comedy central August 31st at 11:00 PM.

777
00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.310
I got to put that in the graphic.

778
00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:01.150
I also filmed the youtube video hyping the special.

779
00:48:01.151 --> 00:48:05.410
That should be up on the page later on this week and up on Youtube.

780
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.320
Um,
I don't want to,

781
00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:10.900
don't want to tell you what it's called because I don't want to give away the

782
00:48:10.901 --> 00:48:13.750
joke or whatever the whole fucking thing is.
But,
uh,

783
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:19.080
I got that going on and I'll be at the stress factory in New Jersey on September

784
00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:24.400
29th,
30th and 31st.
So I'll be back in the New York area,

785
00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:28.900
which means I will be doing the opening and Anthony Show radio program,

786
00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:32.710
the best fucking show out there that I really missed doing.

787
00:48:32.711 --> 00:48:36.880
The only fucking thing that I miss about a needle work is doing that show and

788
00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:38.830
hanging out with those guys.
So I'm really psyched that we,

789
00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:42.250
I think I'll be on there Thursday of that week,
if not Thursday and Friday.

790
00:48:42.251 --> 00:48:45.080
I have no idea.
Um,
and that's all.

791
00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:49.870
Next m two o two bro.
You punks in the middle of nowhere.
All right,
so that's it.

792
00:48:49.871 --> 00:48:53.320
So with that,
let's get to the,
uh,
let's get to the podcast questions.

793
00:48:53.321 --> 00:48:57.520
We'll do those first because the underrated overrated is really fucking long.

794
00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:02.840
Uh,
let's see.
Question,
uh,
a bill.
Uh,

795
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:05.590
Damn.
That dude's got that fucking,
can you hear that?

796
00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:10.600
It's one of those guys who listens to hip hop and you can't figure out why they

797
00:49:10.601 --> 00:49:13.770
listen to it.
Add the fuck.
I guess I listened to it,
but I have the thesis.

798
00:49:13.771 --> 00:49:16.090
He to put the windows up.
You know what I mean?

799
00:49:16.091 --> 00:49:18.700
If you're nerdy looking white dude like me and you listen to hip hop,

800
00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:20.350
put the fucking windows up.
Okay.

801
00:49:20.351 --> 00:49:23.950
Cause I just looked over and I thought it was going to see 50 cent and I didn't,

802
00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:28.750
I saw
his name was probably Chris.
Actually,

803
00:49:28.751 --> 00:49:30.400
wait a minute.
Isn't that fucking 50 cents?

804
00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:35.350
Really know what the fuck is his real name?
Curtis Curtis Jackson.

805
00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:37.240
Christopher Wallace is biggie smalls.

806
00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.640
That should be a trivia question on like jeopardy.

807
00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:44.320
I'll take rappers real names for a 200.

808
00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:50.880
You know what?
I really wished I had a fucking rappers real name.
Uh,

809
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:56.000
I answered to the name Shawn Carter in the fucking early nineties.
I believe.

810
00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:00.820
Jay Z.
Uh,
go fuck yourself for 100.
All right.

811
00:50:00.821 --> 00:50:04.420
Here we go.
The podcast questions for uh,

812
00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.800
for the week of August 18th with NF.
All right,
Bill.

813
00:50:08.801 --> 00:50:13.210
I recently discovered the entertainment value of going on to youtube and doing a

814
00:50:13.211 --> 00:50:15.970
search for awful comedian or comedian bombing.

815
00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.770
They're basically videos were comics and doing eight to 10 minutes sets.

816
00:50:20.771 --> 00:50:23.440
They're not getting a single laugh,
not even a pity laugh.

817
00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.290
And my favorite part is seeing how they deal with it.

818
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.380
If I were ever to do an open mic and bomb like I know I would,

819
00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:35.920
is it better to just ignore what you and everyone in the room knows namely how

820
00:50:35.931 --> 00:50:40.160
Shitty I am or just play it off.
It's no,
it's you,

821
00:50:40.161 --> 00:50:43.130
you have to address it.
You have to address it.

822
00:50:43.131 --> 00:50:46.550
That is page one of doing standup comedy.

823
00:50:46.551 --> 00:50:48.260
Whatever's happening in the room,

824
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:51.620
you have to address it unless it's really small,
you know what I mean?

825
00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:55.940
If somebody says something or drops a glass of does some bullshit and only like

826
00:50:55.941 --> 00:51:00.800
that section here is it,
and you're on a roll,
don't address it because then you,

827
00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:04.580
then you start talking to somebody and the people in the back didn't hear it and

828
00:51:04.581 --> 00:51:08.930
then it just,
it becomes a cluster fuck.
So yeah,
if you start bombing,
yeah,

829
00:51:08.931 --> 00:51:13.000
just to dress it,
just say anything,
you know,

830
00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:18.350
I suck.
I knew this was going to suck.
I'll never do that joke again.

831
00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:22.990
Wow.
That hurt.
Uh,

832
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:27.560
I can't feel my pancreas.
Whatever you can,
you know,
just really,
you know what?

833
00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:32.030
Go with honesty.
Don't do those,
those fucking,
those,

834
00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.810
uh,
those memorize lines.
Like,
hey buddy,

835
00:51:35.811 --> 00:51:38.920
do I go down to the bus station on Ls heckle?

836
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:43.340
Did I answer that last week?
This,
these fucking things are starting to overlap.

837
00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.100
All right.
Yeah.
So if you go up on stage and you start bombing,

838
00:51:46.101 --> 00:51:49.000
definitely address it.
Okay.
If you address it,
it,

839
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:51.500
it gives people hope that you're,

840
00:51:51.501 --> 00:51:53.870
that you're somehow a human being and you're aware,

841
00:51:53.871 --> 00:51:57.650
but when you just fucking plow through it,
you really can get in trouble.

842
00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.080
A white crowd,
suburban white crowd,

843
00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:02.840
they're actually going to feel worse than you and they're going to start staring

844
00:52:02.841 --> 00:52:05.630
at the fucking floor.
They can't even look at other people at that table.

845
00:52:05.631 --> 00:52:08.600
They're so uncomfortable with that type of shit.
You know what I mean?

846
00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:12.470
Because they're in that world of fucking smiling there in the Truman show,

847
00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:17.660
you know,
the empty pursuit of knickknacks and always acting like,
hi,

848
00:52:17.661 --> 00:52:19.070
how are you?
Everything's great.

849
00:52:19.071 --> 00:52:23.900
So when they actually see a fucking painful moment that they can not smooth over

850
00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:28.580
with an awkward laugh,
then they fucking,

851
00:52:28.581 --> 00:52:29.750
they just stare at the floor.

852
00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:32.750
If you're in front of more of a white trash redneck crowd,

853
00:52:32.751 --> 00:52:36.170
you're going to get heckled.
Fuck's wrong with you buddy.

854
00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.430
Why don't you bring on the next mother fucker?

855
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:45.650
And then you go to def con five,
which is a black crowd.

856
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:50.510
And what I've learned,
uh,
which I might've mentioned in past podcasts,

857
00:52:50.511 --> 00:52:51.650
they're all starting to overlap.

858
00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:55.220
I've learned what the black crowd they're going to have fun with or without you.

859
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.863
That's what I learned.

860
00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:00.110
So either you bring it and they laugh with you or you don't.

861
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:02.090
And then when your joke bombs,

862
00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:07.120
there's a 1.5 second pause of silence and then everybody laughs because nobody

863
00:53:09.471 --> 00:53:13.550
laughed.
And then
then whatever,

864
00:53:13.551 --> 00:53:15.470
I dunno how many minutes you got left and you set,

865
00:53:15.471 --> 00:53:18.740
but it's going to seem like the rest of your life.
And

866
00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:23.450
you know,
I think I just broke up in cold sweats thinking about that.

867
00:53:23.451 --> 00:53:28.080
I really had some fucking rough ones.
Um,
okay.
Next question.
Uh,

868
00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:32.340
Bill,
uh,
here's one for you.
When was the last time bill burr had to,

869
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:38.030
had to thrown the fisticuffs had to thrown fisticuffs when's the last time you

870
00:53:39.031 --> 00:53:43.710
fucking learn how to write a sentence?
I think he was trying to say,
don't.

871
00:53:43.711 --> 00:53:47.880
When's the last time you had to throw fists?
Uh,
when was the last time you,

872
00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:53.370
what is the proper way to use fisticuffs?
We're involved in some fisticuffs,

873
00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:58.680
a little Donny brook sky guy.
Sounds like a drunk 60 year old.

874
00:53:58.681 --> 00:54:02.780
He's using fucking phrases from the 1920.
Alrighty.

875
00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:05.530
I was the last time I had to,
I don't know,

876
00:54:05.531 --> 00:54:08.260
like fucking fought my brother and a red roof fan above.

877
00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:12.450
I was like 35 so it's five years ago.
I didn't fight him.

878
00:54:12.451 --> 00:54:16.800
I just tied him up cause I'm older and more mature and I didn't want to do that.

879
00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:19.800
You know what I mean?
And before that,

880
00:54:19.801 --> 00:54:24.360
I think the last fight I had was with my same brother probably during the grunge

881
00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:27.480
era.
It was a

882
00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:33.330
right as the smashing pumpkins were,
had their big breakthrough album.

883
00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:37.620
And just right after that and just before Kurt Cobain killed himself.

884
00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:45.390
All right.
Underrated.
Overrated.

885
00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:50.310
Um,
let's see,
what do we got here for this week?
All right.

886
00:54:50.311 --> 00:54:54.960
Here's this one guy's list.
This is his list for underrated.
He said the Camaro.

887
00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:56.340
It's one bad ass car.

888
00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:00.240
I don't know how the fuck you think a legendary American muscle car,

889
00:55:00.241 --> 00:55:03.930
like the Camaro is underrated.
I mean,

890
00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:05.970
they're fucking bringing it back.

891
00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:11.570
That car was the shift from the late six sixties right through to like 87 88 and

892
00:55:13.621 --> 00:55:16.650
then it kind of became a joke.
You know the f body,

893
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:18.860
the only one that I think is underrated is,

894
00:55:18.861 --> 00:55:23.520
is the one from like the late seventies you know the smoking,
abandoned design,

895
00:55:23.521 --> 00:55:27.300
but the Camaro version,
not the trans-am member and there was three of them.

896
00:55:27.301 --> 00:55:28.470
They had the sport troop,

897
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:33.730
the Berlinetta and the fucking z 28 and the Berlinetta was the middle one.

898
00:55:33.961 --> 00:55:35.220
I think he got a decent engine.

899
00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:40.200
But you had these grand granny fucking wire rims on it.
I Dunno.

900
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.880
All right.
More underrated shit.

901
00:55:41.881 --> 00:55:45.480
This guy thinks doing an iron cross in gymnastics is underrated.

902
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:49.590
I can't tell you how many times they did an iron cross and people are like,
ah,

903
00:55:49.591 --> 00:55:54.030
whatever.
I could fucking do that guys list starting off week.

904
00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:56.910
But I like this one.
He says,
you who is underrated,

905
00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:00.690
you know that chocolate he'd drink?
He's like,
look at the nutritional facts.

906
00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:04.470
It's not bad for you.
Who fucking knew the iron,

907
00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:07.080
the umbrella doc Martins,

908
00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:09.900
a good promotional pen.

909
00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:14.670
Ever had a pen from someplace called Gust is bathroom fixtures that lasted you

910
00:56:14.671 --> 00:56:18.720
for three years.
Three years.
The fucker was in the fucker was free.

911
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:21.090
You know what?
Uh,
yeah.

912
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:25.750
I got one from a fucking dental office that I've been using for the last six

913
00:56:25.751 --> 00:56:28.660
years,
but it's on my desk and I type a lot,
so I dunno.

914
00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:34.090
Email Corey Feldman guy.
Thanks.
Corey Feldman is underrated.

915
00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:40.060
Any claims,
the fucker never made a bad movie and to defend that argument,

916
00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:44.350
these are the movies he lifts.
Gremlin's Goonies.

917
00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:47.560
Stand by me.
I'll give you that.
That's a good one.

918
00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:53.020
Lost Boys lost.
First of all,
lost boys suck.

919
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:54.191
Okay.

920
00:56:54.191 --> 00:56:59.191
Lost Boyz was good when it came out and I was fucking 1819 years old,

921
00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:03.790
but it did not hold up over time.
You know what I mean?

922
00:57:03.791 --> 00:57:07.360
With those feathered fucking mullets that everybody had,

923
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:10.270
those things suck gremlins and Goonies.

924
00:57:10.271 --> 00:57:15.070
I never even saw those a kitty movies.
I guess.
If you're a kid,

925
00:57:15.071 --> 00:57:17.530
okay,
I'll give you,
they didn't stock book.
Come on man.

926
00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:21.580
You know what you did in port about the one that he and he ended with that
dream,

927
00:57:21.581 --> 00:57:24.770
a little dream of me,
and he did his Michael Jackson soft.

928
00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:26.440
You tap dance at the end of the movie.

929
00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:30.100
That movie sucked and you conveniently conveniently did not bring that up,

930
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:35.500
but you know what is overrated?
His drug use.
I saw a thing about him.

931
00:57:35.501 --> 00:57:37.360
He only was fucked up for about two years,

932
00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:42.430
but it followed them forever and that's the reason why young guns too.

933
00:57:42.431 --> 00:57:46.510
He says,
oh,
really?

934
00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:48.940
Have you ever watched a Clint Eastwood,
John Wayne,

935
00:57:48.941 --> 00:57:53.320
if you know the magnificent seven?
Have you ever watched a real cowboy movie?

936
00:57:53.321 --> 00:57:56.140
Why don't you watch one of those fucking movies and input on young guns too?

937
00:57:57.430 --> 00:58:01.570
All right,
with fucking Lou Diamond Phillips and Emilio Estefan,
Jesus Christ,

938
00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:05.920
all right.
More underrated stuff from other people eating at home instead of out,

939
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:11.680
even if you're eating shit,
feel more satisfying and the cheaper 90% of the time.

940
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:15.580
I says Psi Phi horror movies from the seventies and eighties

941
00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:19.030
okay,
what did he say?
Oh yeah,

942
00:58:19.031 --> 00:58:22.180
Robo cop in the fly before they had all these psycho fucking,

943
00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:27.640
all these psycho.
Speaking of psycho,
I'm literally sitting here in the car,
right?

944
00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:32.110
And I'm staring at my laptop in two people just walk by looking at me like,

945
00:58:32.111 --> 00:58:34.450
what the fuck is this guy's problem?
Is he homeless?

946
00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:38.500
Is he another struggling actor around here?
You know,
I didn't do this guy's,

947
00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:40.960
this guy's underrated thing.
Justice here,

948
00:58:40.961 --> 00:58:44.920
he said Sci fi horror movies of the 70s and eighties most of the more recent

949
00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:48.940
computer affect affect heavy films of this.

950
00:58:48.941 --> 00:58:53.941
John Rhe Pale in comparison to intelligently made movies with Realistic Gore and

951
00:58:54.221 --> 00:58:57.970
affects like robocop on the fly Robo Cup on the fly with the shit.

952
00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:02.030
And I know what you say it.
You know what a great example.
This isn't Scifi,

953
00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:05.920
but that movie a perfect storm.
That movie,
the book is unbelievable.

954
00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.540
The movie sucks.
The whole movie,

955
00:59:07.541 --> 00:59:11.110
you're just waiting for the fucking wave and that's it.
Other than that,

956
00:59:11.111 --> 00:59:13.930
they didn't develop the characters and I didn't give a fuck about anybody in it.

957
00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:18.190
And I liked George Clooney and Mark Walberg and the guy who played the creepy

958
00:59:18.191 --> 00:59:21.500
fishermen.
I liked him too.
It was John C and neck.

959
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.640
I can't remember this guy says hand jobs are overrated.

960
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.880
There were a lot of factors with sex.
He can,

961
00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:31.280
it can often not live up to expectations.

962
00:59:31.281 --> 00:59:35.930
I find myself concentrating too hard on enjoying myself during blowjobs.
Oh,

963
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.190
okay.
All right.
This isn't not doctor drew,

964
00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:43.550
I've just breaking your balls.
But that was,
yeah,

965
00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:46.350
I don't know how to make that funny on it.

966
00:59:47.310 --> 00:59:51.560
Concentrating too hard to enjoy myself.
You start making those noises.

967
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:57.200
She just want the hand job.
You know something.
A lot of women,
you know something,

968
00:59:57.201 --> 00:59:59.720
there's a lot of women out there don't do not know how to give a fucking hand

969
00:59:59.721 --> 01:00:02.840
job and it's not their fault.
The same way.

970
01:00:02.841 --> 01:00:05.480
There's a lot of women out there sitting there like I am a guy really doesn't

971
01:00:05.481 --> 01:00:09.530
know how to go down on him.
That's not his fault.
You got to communicate.

972
01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:12.110
So you know,
teach a girl how to rub one out.

973
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.830
Oh God,
what am I talking about?
You know what?

974
01:00:15.831 --> 01:00:18.770
As I get the windows up cause I'm cursing and it started to get fucking hot in

975
01:00:18.771 --> 01:00:21.980
here.
Maybe it was that less suggestion.

976
01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.140
A Seltzer water

977
01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:29.900
is a beverage of gods.
Think about it is water,

978
01:00:29.901 --> 01:00:32.960
but it's kind of like soda.
You know what?
I'm not going to think about it.

979
01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:34.301
Oh that's right.

980
01:00:34.301 --> 01:00:36.700
You get to see you get someone you closed and it takes the stain out.

981
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:40.370
I don't fucking know.
Popeye's is overrated.

982
01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:44.540
Underrated Upright Citizens Brigade.
I never watched that show.

983
01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:47.420
It would just see a show and you just don't want to watch it.

984
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:50.420
You can't even figure out why.
It was one of those shows.

985
01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:55.930
It's kind of like Tim Allen tool time.
The second I saw the set second,

986
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.790
I saw the couch on that show.
I was just like,
I don't want to watch this.

987
01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:03.050
I have no idea whether that's a good show or a bad show.
I have no fucking clue.

988
01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:05.390
Um,
all right,

989
01:01:05.391 --> 01:01:08.210
let's get into overrated because he thinks are really getting long and I feel

990
01:01:08.211 --> 01:01:11.750
like I'm just reading down when this isn't even funny.
Alright.
Overrated.

991
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:15.800
Broadway musicals,
techno music,

992
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:20.180
Japanese baseball players.
Do.
That's fucking great.
Whoever wrote that.

993
01:01:20.181 --> 01:01:24.410
That's great.
That's great.
They are overrated.
The decky met sue.

994
01:01:24.411 --> 01:01:27.800
We remember when he first came over here,
what would they say?
Godzilla.

995
01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.920
Like he was going to hit 800 fucking home runs.

996
01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:34.010
He is definitely a fundamentally sound player,
but you know,

997
01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:38.630
I mean he's,
he's good,
but he was the,

998
01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.900
he was supposed to be the best Japanese player available at the time.

999
01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.790
He's definitely the best Udekki whoever played in the league because you

1000
01:01:46.791 --> 01:01:49.070
remember the other one,
the Yankees had member that had decky.

1001
01:01:49.071 --> 01:01:51.710
You'll Rabo came over.

1002
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:58.640
He came over here.
Who's the fat one?
Laurel Hardy.

1003
01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:03.230
He looks like the Japanese version of the fat one.
He just,

1004
01:02:03.231 --> 01:02:06.230
he and the magnets on his wrist,
he fucking stunk.

1005
01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:11.860
All those fucking Yankee fans had the rising sun fucking bed and is on their

1006
01:02:12.141 --> 01:02:13.910
heads like he was going to keep the,
uh,

1007
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:16.940
well I guess they kept the dynasty going anyways,

1008
01:02:16.941 --> 01:02:19.260
but he sure as heck did he get a ring.
Does anybody know?

1009
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:21.420
Could somebody else answer that?
Whether he got a ring or not,

1010
01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:25.290
who else is in each hero?
But there wasn't a lot of hype with each hero,

1011
01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:29.370
but he has a Japanese baseball player.
He's the shit.
But that other guy,

1012
01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:33.090
cosmetic Zooey.
I mean,
you know,

1013
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:37.530
he bleach blonde is Harry end up looking like that guy always wins that Nathan's

1014
01:02:37.531 --> 01:02:42.180
hot dog eating contest.
All right.
All right.
All right.
I'm being a dick now.

1015
01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:46.560
All right.
Blackberry phones.
Modern Art,
someone said is overrated.
Yeah,

1016
01:02:46.561 --> 01:02:49.060
I'd have to say it's over ready to,
I don't like looking at something.

1017
01:02:49.090 --> 01:02:51.870
I got to figure out what the fuck it is.
You know what I mean?

1018
01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:56.100
I get it on a certain level,
but it's a lot of times it's like,
dude,

1019
01:02:56.101 --> 01:03:00.600
you just sort of threw a bunch of paint on there.
Um,
on demand.

1020
01:03:00.601 --> 01:03:04.500
Television is overrated cause the shit hardly ever works.

1021
01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.700
Jesus Christ.
It's one of the truest things I ever heard.

1022
01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:13.620
I got to agree with that one.
I have really bad cable,
uh,
Mexican restaurants.

1023
01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:18.930
It's eating fast food with silverware.
You know what?

1024
01:03:18.931 --> 01:03:21.420
That's fucked up.
I gotta say that's fucked up.
You know why?

1025
01:03:21.421 --> 01:03:24.690
Because there's too many Mexican restaurants out there owned by white people,

1026
01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.870
and there's something about Mexican food that you just gotta.

1027
01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:32.700
You just throw a bunch of cheese on it and you use those fucking,
uh,
those,
uh,

1028
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:36.560
whatever they,
uh,
the fuck in the round things and you'll get it.

1029
01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:38.960
You know how to roll it up.
People can just say it's Mexican food.

1030
01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:41.340
Taco bell ruined Mexican food.

1031
01:03:41.341 --> 01:03:43.470
That has to be some good Mexican restaurants out there.

1032
01:03:43.471 --> 01:03:47.610
He can't fucking shit on an entire country's food.

1033
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:52.970
Like nobody in Mexico knows how to cook,
um,

1034
01:03:53.090 --> 01:03:55.470
all to speak to that.
On the flight back from Miami,

1035
01:03:55.471 --> 01:04:00.471
there was two Italian guys literally from Italy who was such so fucking loud.

1036
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:05.580
It made me never want to go to Italy and I've always wanted to be there.

1037
01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:09.300
I've always wanted to go there.
They would like characters from a movie.

1038
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:12.260
They were speaking Italian as loud as you play.

1039
01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:13.873
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1040
01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:16.210
<v 5>Well,</v>

1041
01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:20.650
the whole fucking flight and one of these fat fucking bastards.

1042
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:23.830
The other guy was skinny.
Other guy was fat.
Right.
Speaking of Laurel and hardy,

1043
01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:26.080
he kept hitting the woman's chair next to me.

1044
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:31.810
He had his foot up in between the window in her seat at one point.

1045
01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:36.130
And I,
you know,
you have a,
just want to be like a invade someone's body,

1046
01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:39.130
so they'll,
they'll do what you want them to do.

1047
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:42.400
Kind of like Whoopi Goldberg and ghosts.
That's what I wanted to do.

1048
01:04:42.401 --> 01:04:47.150
Somehow morphed into her body and then take a pen and just stab that guy right

1049
01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.920
<v 6>the bottom of his bucket.
You fucking</v>

1050
01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:53.370
<v 5>Dick.
I just kept fucking walking around.</v>

1051
01:04:53.371 --> 01:04:57.750
He just looked like a big spoiled brat and I seen all 10 attains.
I like to,
okay,

1052
01:04:57.751 --> 01:05:00.930
but this guy,
you know,
he's like a fucking Mama's boy.

1053
01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:04.560
You just tell he just got everything you wanted in life.
You know,

1054
01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:08.370
he wanted another meatball and they fucking gave it to him.

1055
01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:11.640
And that's why he's a sad bastard and that's why he has to stand up during the

1056
01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:16.320
flight and fucking lean,
lean on the chair.
At one point,
he literally,

1057
01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:21.760
he was on diagonally behind me and he's fucking lean and over our fucking row.

1058
01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:22.810
Like,

1059
01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:27.010
he just ran a marathon or he's fucking ran suicides trying to make a hoop team.

1060
01:05:27.011 --> 01:05:27.790
Right.

1061
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:32.470
So it was fucking hand is in my sight and I literally fucking fucking elbow his

1062
01:05:32.471 --> 01:05:35.710
hand.
I just,
you know,

1063
01:05:35.711 --> 01:05:39.490
I don't know if that broke some sort of nine 11 are you a terrorist fucking
code?

1064
01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:44.140
But it's just,
Ooh,
I always wanted to go to Italy.

1065
01:05:44.170 --> 01:05:47.170
I know I still do,
but right now I don't.
I really don't.

1066
01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:53.320
Speaking of great food,
Italian food could never,
ever,
ever,

1067
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:57.440
ever be overrated.
Best fucking food out there.
And then wines and say,

1068
01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.700
do you have any that Barolo,
is that what it's called?

1069
01:06:00.701 --> 01:06:04.330
That red wine is fucking insane.
70 75 bucks,
you know,

1070
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:09.580
go out and get a bottle,
you know,
and just have a glass.
Don't be a Douche.

1071
01:06:09.581 --> 01:06:12.640
Don't fucking start swinging it like a pirate.
Okay.
It's a fucking great one.

1072
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:18.010
All right,
moving on here.
Uh
Oh.
Here's a white wine.

1073
01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:23.230
White wine is overrated and this is his.
This is reason.
White wine.

1074
01:06:23.231 --> 01:06:27.190
And then in parentheses it just says,
shit sucks.
I like to,

1075
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:31.000
if that's not alliteration,
is it?
It's just,
I dunno.
White wine,

1076
01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:34.750
white wine shit sucks.
Two syllables,
two syllables.

1077
01:06:34.751 --> 01:06:39.730
That's like a full house of fucking grammar or two pair.
Anyways.
All right.

1078
01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:41.740
Cats.
Cats are overrated.

1079
01:06:41.741 --> 01:06:46.330
They have no right to be classed anywhere near a dog home theater surround

1080
01:06:46.331 --> 01:06:50.140
sound.
It's cool for about two months and then it's a pain in the ass.

1081
01:06:50.530 --> 01:06:53.260
I tell you something,
I don't,
I forget who wrote this shit,
but you know what?

1082
01:06:53.261 --> 01:06:56.890
This person is onto some stuff.
Surround sound does suck.

1083
01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:58.630
Thank you.

1084
01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:01.630
Remember when you got it right and you had to fucking figure out how to run the

1085
01:07:01.631 --> 01:07:06.631
wires down along the wall and then behind your couch without any company seeing

1086
01:07:06.641 --> 01:07:10.240
it.
Then you had that.
Then a year later they came up with the wireless shit.

1087
01:07:10.241 --> 01:07:14.050
Then you got to somehow drill a hole in your fucking wall and then,

1088
01:07:14.051 --> 01:07:16.450
you know what I mean?
Then it's like just,
it's just too fucking loud.

1089
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.370
You got literally imax sound in a fucking 30 square foot room.

1090
01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:25.450
At least I did one bedroom apartment.
Oh,
hey,
here's one.

1091
01:07:25.451 --> 01:07:27.580
This one might set off some people he had.
Somebody said,

1092
01:07:27.581 --> 01:07:31.870
Oliver Stone is overrated guy makes horrible movies,

1093
01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:35.710
natural born killers,
Scarface.
Any given Sunday,

1094
01:07:36.070 --> 01:07:39.970
only good one he ever made was people versus Larry Flint.
All right.

1095
01:07:39.971 --> 01:07:44.830
You might get some,
uh,
some people arguing on that one did,
did he,

1096
01:07:44.831 --> 01:07:49.180
I thought Brian de Palma did Scarface.
That Oliver stone right in or something.

1097
01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:51.910
I wasn't a fan of natural born killers.

1098
01:07:51.911 --> 01:07:56.650
I didn't like how it reminded me of Madonna.
Like you're like,
oh my God,

1099
01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:59.740
Madonna's so fucking cheesy.
She's thinks,
and then she's,

1100
01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:04.960
then she has the out of like,
no,
it's supposed to be cheesy.
A mocking pop music,

1101
01:08:04.961 --> 01:08:08.100
you know,
that type of shit.
I thought natural born killers was like the,

1102
01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:11.890
it's like,
I got it.
I got it.
Within the first five minutes I got it,

1103
01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.760
I was over it.
And then the whole defense of the movie,
it's like,

1104
01:08:14.770 --> 01:08:19.370
that's the point,
man.
The violence,
you don't even have a reaction to it.

1105
01:08:19.371 --> 01:08:21.920
It's like you're immune to it.
No,
dude,
that movie sucked.

1106
01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:25.820
There was some great performances,
but all those fucking edits,

1107
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:28.850
it was fucking ridiculous.
It was like,

1108
01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.670
it's like one of those SNL movies where they just,

1109
01:08:31.671 --> 01:08:33.890
it's a sketch and I stretch it out into a movie.

1110
01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.060
That's what I felt natural born killers with.
Like,
you know,
it was like,
I got it,

1111
01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:41.360
I got it,
I got it.
And you're still doing it.
It was one note.

1112
01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:46.550
All right,
last couple and then we're going to wrap this up.
Kanye west,

1113
01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:49.130
he said I like two songs,

1114
01:08:49.131 --> 01:08:53.720
but he seems way too cocky and over played on the radio and TV kind of seems

1115
01:08:53.721 --> 01:08:57.010
like you just don't like Kanye.
Tupac.

1116
01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:00.350
Just because he's dead doesn't mean that he was great.

1117
01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:05.570
He had about five good songs out of 10 million.
You know what?

1118
01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:09.770
I'm going to have to agree with the,
I never,
I never,
you know,

1119
01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:11.840
worries about Tupac.
He fucking,

1120
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:16.190
he never switched up the way he phrased his shit or his flow or whatever the

1121
01:09:16.191 --> 01:09:17.270
fuck you supposed to say.

1122
01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:22.480
Every song was the same cadence that nobody did and I think I'm going to die

1123
01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.360
everything.
Well,
rose is the concrete.
We'll just single model

1124
01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:35.210
and I think I'm going to,
it's fucking terrible.

1125
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:38.450
You know what it was about that guy,
he had like those fucking,

1126
01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:45.200
he had those uh,
adopted dog,
big Brown fucking eyeballs,
you know,

1127
01:09:45.201 --> 01:09:48.300
and Sarah mcglothlin sings that song.
[inaudible] oh

1128
01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:51.830
yeah,
he had that fucking face.

1129
01:09:51.831 --> 01:09:55.730
So everybody liked him and then he wrote a bunch of shit on his stomach and then

1130
01:09:55.731 --> 01:10:00.020
he had his,
he had his cadence and he fucking,
he was,
he was more of a hypnotist.

1131
01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:05.750
I like biggie way better.
There we go.
That artist start a fucking debate.

1132
01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:09.170
Who Do you like better?
Huh?
You know what?

1133
01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:10.920
Why don't you guys send me something and what,

1134
01:10:11.230 --> 01:10:14.330
you know the band that's getting all the attention and the person you think

1135
01:10:14.331 --> 01:10:16.160
should be,
you know what I mean?

1136
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:19.740
And don't say Nickelback is everybody picks on them.
We all know they're a,

1137
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:23.630
I don't know if they suck.
They're just annoying.
Um,
all right,

1138
01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:28.700
the last few here,
a overrated I iPhones,
organic produce,

1139
01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:34.550
blondes,
breasts and religion.
Organic produce.

1140
01:10:34.551 --> 01:10:39.110
I like that one cause I buy that shit and it's fucking expensive and I don't

1141
01:10:39.111 --> 01:10:43.850
feel a whole lot better.
Um,
I think that might be it.
Oh,

1142
01:10:43.851 --> 01:10:44.850
one guy had a heat.

1143
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:49.310
One guy had was fucking annoyed about the tattoo comment that I made last week

1144
01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:53.210
about those,
you know,
those sleeves people get,
you know,

1145
01:10:53.211 --> 01:10:58.211
I like seeing like one cool tattoo surrounded by a bunch of skin so I can see

1146
01:10:58.851 --> 01:11:03.500
what the fuck it is.
You know what I mean?
As opposed to,

1147
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:04.490
uh,
you know,

1148
01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:08.270
it just looks like somebody scribbled all over somebody fucking arm and then

1149
01:11:08.271 --> 01:11:11.030
what happens is you fucking looking at the guys aren't trying to figure out what

1150
01:11:11.031 --> 01:11:12.440
it is.
Then he starts thinking,

1151
01:11:12.441 --> 01:11:15.750
you're looking at him and then you were in a fucking situation.
You know,

1152
01:11:15.751 --> 01:11:15.961
it's like,

1153
01:11:15.961 --> 01:11:18.950
do well maybe if you didn't have fucking rhyme of the ancient mariner on you got

1154
01:11:18.951 --> 01:11:22.560
damn elbow.
I wouldn't have to look at you so fucking long.
But anyways,

1155
01:11:22.561 --> 01:11:24.330
this is what this guy says.
He says,
okay,

1156
01:11:24.331 --> 01:11:27.870
I have to chime in about the tattoo sleeve topics on this week's podcast.

1157
01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:31.080
I agree that there are a lot of paper gangsters.

1158
01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:35.610
I guess phony people are out there getting ink done lately,

1159
01:11:35.611 --> 01:11:40.611
but usually it's something queer like a Barb wire armband or some tribal ass

1160
01:11:41.881 --> 01:11:46.410
shit or some gay ass cartoon.
It's fucking dumb.
All right.

1161
01:11:46.411 --> 01:11:50.490
Just to stop this paragraph for a second and do a little history of tattoos that

1162
01:11:50.491 --> 01:11:54.420
I've noticed.
The hacky tattoo to get in the 90s was the,

1163
01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:56.970
the barbed wire arm band.

1164
01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:02.780
Even Pamela Anderson has it or the fucking date rape is frat boy tribal fucking

1165
01:12:03.511 --> 01:12:07.390
one.
But the gay ass cartoon one,
that was more of a late seven.

1166
01:12:07.391 --> 01:12:11.460
That was like a seventies.
Uh,
what was that pot thing?

1167
01:12:11.461 --> 01:12:15.450
Everybody was into the seventies zippy or some shit.

1168
01:12:15.451 --> 01:12:19.160
What the fuck was that guy?
Somebody was here or is that World War Two?

1169
01:12:19.161 --> 01:12:20.280
I don't know.
But back then,
yeah,

1170
01:12:20.281 --> 01:12:25.080
like I worked in a warehouse with this guy in the fucking eighties and he had,

1171
01:12:25.081 --> 01:12:29.430
you sent me,
you sent to me,
Sam.
Yo sent to me.
I can't say that word.

1172
01:12:29.431 --> 01:12:32.940
How you say that?
Why did you send me,
I just want to say a fast,
you have a word,

1173
01:12:32.941 --> 01:12:35.680
you can't say it.
So you just started to say it fast.
That's what I do with it.

1174
01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:38.470
Your Saturday Sam.
Um,

1175
01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:41.610
on his fucking,

1176
01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:46.080
he hasn't basically on his leg just to the right of his ball bag.

1177
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:49.860
And I know what you think it bill like what were your blowing the guy?

1178
01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:54.540
How the fuck did you see that?
Well,
here's my defense.
It was the eighties.
Okay.

1179
01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:59.460
And he was wearing Larry Bird level shorts,

1180
01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:04.080
fucking grape smugglers and someone was thinking about getting a tattoo when he

1181
01:13:04.081 --> 01:13:06.850
was at where he goes,
I got a tattoo and he fucking lifts as fuck him.

1182
01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:12.300
And he went back.
Then we're looking at it.
Okay,
what do you got?

1183
01:13:12.301 --> 01:13:16.110
Daffy duck on your ass cheek.
You fucking idiot.
All right,

1184
01:13:16.111 --> 01:13:18.570
let me finish reading this guy's complaint.
Okay.
That being said,

1185
01:13:18.571 --> 01:13:22.650
there was a lot of hardcore tat people out there with Nice looking sleeves and

1186
01:13:22.651 --> 01:13:25.670
not some shit just thrown together.
Okay.
Well,
you know what,

1187
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:30.650
that's a decent point because there's a ton of people doing standup,
uh,

1188
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:35.460
who just have jokes thrown together I guess.
Okay.
I get it.
All right.
But he said,

1189
01:13:35.461 --> 01:13:39.390
I was trying to get picks up my sleeve and my leg and but my space wouldn't let

1190
01:13:39.391 --> 01:13:42.990
me upload it.
But anyways,
I ain't,
oh,
everyone's getting tattooed.

1191
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:46.410
But if you're someone who keeps count of your tests,

1192
01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:52.260
you're a fucking fag and should stick with a Henna attempt tattoo.

1193
01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:57.000
Hey Man,
I got four tattoos the size of a fucking quarter.

1194
01:13:57.210 --> 01:14:00.420
Fucking pussies is getting angry towards the end of this.

1195
01:14:00.421 --> 01:14:01.440
I think I've got to finish this.

1196
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.340
The best is when they try to act tough and outs of pop.

1197
01:14:05.730 --> 01:14:10.200
Oh and show off the pint size tat and your face like they're all tough now

1198
01:14:10.201 --> 01:14:12.490
because they cried five minutes while

1199
01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:18.400
the guy did the work is one of the reasons why I don't read all these fucking

1200
01:14:18.401 --> 01:14:21.160
things is cause I'm not good at reading out loud and people aren't good at

1201
01:14:21.161 --> 01:14:25.810
putting together sentences.
Anyways,
that being said,

1202
01:14:25.811 --> 01:14:28.120
not all ink is overrated.
Just the facts.

1203
01:14:28.121 --> 01:14:32.950
Who get the my little pony on their ass.
Cheeks.
Dot,
dot,
dot,
dot.

1204
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:38.140
Fuck.
Okay.
Little wordy,
but I get your point.
All right,

1205
01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:42.670
well there you go.
That's this week's podcast.
But the second fucking time,

1213
01:15:05.981 --> 01:15:09.190
I kind of went out and just did some random shit to try and hype it and I put it

1214
01:15:09.191 --> 01:15:09.821
up on youtube,

1215
01:15:09.821 --> 01:15:13.210
but it's going to be up on my page and I'm going to have to do shit a couple of

1216
01:15:13.211 --> 01:15:17.020
those other videos just because it's taking too long to load my page.

1217
01:15:17.021 --> 01:15:20.270
Some people are telling me,
so I think I'm going to have to get rid of,
uh,

1218
01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:22.780
some of the old and bringing the new.

1219
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:27.880
And with that I just hit power on my fucking Prius here.

1220
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:32.680
You hear that?
He required that is,
I'm in drive right now.
I just turned on.

1221
01:15:32.681 --> 01:15:35.980
The light is at this exciting.
