00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.670
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.671 --> 00:00:05.520
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:10.020
July 14th,
2014.
Oh my God.
You guys.

4
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:13.320
Where is this summer going,
going?

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.230
Um,
I can't wait for the winter.
I like the winter.

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.590
I enjoy it.
Okay.
I'm a pasty fucked.

7
00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:25.260
There's nothing the summer offers nothing for me.
Okay.

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.260
Either I'm outside with that.
Look on my face.

9
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:31.440
You know that little [inaudible] joy,
whatever the fuck you call it,

10
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:35.940
when it's got that look on his face,
like it's gone.
Ooh.
You know that,
that face,

11
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.710
what is it called?
The emoji where it's like,

12
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.370
that's the look I have on my fucking face when I walk around between May and

13
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.490
August.
And uh,
you know,
I'm telling you right now,

14
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:53.360
all those theories about what's going to kill off redheads,

15
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.950
recessive genes and it's going to be global warming.

16
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.330
That's what it's going to be.

17
00:00:57.331 --> 00:01:01.560
Cause I got to tell you if these summers get any hotter,
right?

18
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.190
I've been in new,
I'm in New York City right now.
Uh,

19
00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:07.680
I got a benefit tonight and tomorrow out in Brooklyn.

20
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.930
And,
um,
you know,
it's a benefit,
that type of shit.

21
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.250
Couldn't be doing that out there.
I don't know what it is.
All right.

22
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.700
I fucking just woke up and I got to knock this thing out because I got shit to

23
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:23.400
do today.
And uh,
I got to tell you,

24
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:26.760
I haven't been here in New York in a while and it's been,
uh,

25
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.850
it's definitely been cool to be back here,
but I gotta tell you,

26
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:32.010
this city just beats the shit out of you.

27
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.030
I was returning this rental car this morning,
you know,

28
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.750
literally it was like fucking nine streets up in two blocks over.

29
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:44.220
That took me a good 40 minutes.
I was trying to find a gas station,
right?

30
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.700
I said to the lady in my phone,
you know,
where's the gas station?
She's like,

31
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:50.820
there's the gas station right down the street.
Right?

32
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.680
So I follow her,
I go all the way down there and there's a fucking,
you know,

33
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.340
I dunno.
I Dunno what they're doing.
This scrubbing out the gas tanks,

34
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.160
so that thing's screwed.
So then I asked the lady again,
she's like,
dad,

35
00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:07.470
it's over 15.
Right near you.
So I click on the closest dot.

36
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.160
I drive to that one.
That one,
it takes me like another 15 minutes to get to.

37
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:14.440
I get to that one.
It's got a fence around it and oh,

38
00:02:14.441 --> 00:02:17.700
it was red faced going through the roof of his rental care.

39
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.580
I did not handle it like an adult whatsoever.

40
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.640
I just kept acting like a big baby.
Big Stupid.

41
00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:27.930
Like if they had like adult size pacifiers,

42
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.390
somebody should have just shoved one right in my mouth.

43
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.340
Slapped me on my fucking hand and said,
hey,
you know,

44
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.220
like my dad used to write no pacifier.

45
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.020
He always said cool it or he snapped really loud just like that.

46
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.650
We all just stopped worrying that he's going to kick the shit out of us.

47
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:48.900
And he never did.
Never laid a hand on us.

48
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.740
But how loud is snap was you could only imagine his fucking fist.

49
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.210
So you shut up,

50
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.040
you shut the fuck up because back in the day when you could discipline kids,

51
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.390
right?
You could beat the shit out of him,

52
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:04.900
right in public and people would walk by.
That would be it.

53
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.630
So your father's threats were actually something serious.

54
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.570
I'll tell you this whole generation of kids,

55
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:13.300
they're wide open for a fucking ass kick and the way they walked down the street

56
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:14.470
with their faces in the phone,

57
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.310
you could upper cut them right through their phone,
right into their face,

58
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.520
be lovely.
And I think it would do this generation,

59
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.650
they could do them a bit of good cause I'm a crabby old guy and I liked the way

60
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:30.790
things yo still big.
Um,
anyways,

61
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.850
so I'm walking down the streets out here in New York and the amount of people of

62
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:41.620
all ages just muttering to themselves and how they can make my rent and I

63
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:43.990
fucking roommate moved out.
I don't know what the fuck they're talking about.

64
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.430
You know,
do I got HPV right.
I don't know what they're pitching about.

65
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:52.480
And I don't know if they're more crazier than other cities because I think what

66
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:57.340
it is in this city,
you can't hide in your fucking car.
You know,
out in La,

67
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:58.920
I can fucking be talking to my hour.

68
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.820
I run in my God Damn Yap and somebody pulls up next to me and looks over at me

69
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:08.230
and I can seamlessly go from my own psycho shadow with myself to pretending I'm

70
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:11.000
singing with the radio.
And I did and when I do,

71
00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:15.940
they know and the lights go down the thing.

72
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.300
Hi,
how are you?
Just singing to the radio that isn't on,

73
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.980
that's fucking stupid journey song has been in my head for three days and I hope

74
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:28.981
it's now in yours because I'm taking all you fuckers down with me and this goes

75
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:34.670
somewhere with the band.

76
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.650
I've heard this song like a thousand times,

77
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:43.651
but I don't know the lyrics because it fucking sucks.

78
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.220
Um,
how many of those bands are there out there where you're like a radio fan?

79
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.310
Like you know all the lyrics like say Billy Joel,

80
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.170
I don't own one album.
That,
that bug eyed psycho.

81
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.460
Yeah,
you're giving me lots of laughs today.
Cracking up.
Yeah.

82
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.210
Do you know I used to,
I couldn't stand him back in the day.

83
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:11.890
Nia when he did that stupid,

84
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:16.840
the uptown girl song making it seem like he was this bad ass when the wrong side

85
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:21.100
of the tracks.
I remember that like,
what is she doing with me?
Oh,

86
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:24.550
I'm a bad ass little bug eyed Jewish kid playing a piano.

87
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.040
Keep him away from my children.

88
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.850
And I was like,
why is he acting like he's this maniac?

89
00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:36.250
And then 40 years later he's getting hammered,

90
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:38.980
driving his car through the front of people's houses.
And I was like,

91
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:43.720
you know what I,
Oh,
Billy Joel and apology apology.

92
00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:47.170
Not only was I 100% wrong,
I want to drink with that maniac.

93
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.450
How much fun would he be to drink with?

94
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.170
He could talk about what it was like to bang a supermodel and then just sit down

95
00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:57.460
and start playing some tunes and he's got all those songs in three four which

96
00:05:57.461 --> 00:06:02.390
are your greatest thing when you're drunk,
right?

97
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.640
Except for piano man,
that song,
I never liked that song.

98
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.430
The way people sway back and forth,

99
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.730
Yadda da Da da,
do BD Ibew.

100
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.960
And I said,
man,
what are you doing here?

101
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.980
Oh,
shut up.
It's like if Anthony Bordain played the piano,

102
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.580
you know,
he's always trying to make his fucking going out to get a hotdog.

103
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.450
So fucking artsy and what's going on?
What's going on with society.

104
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.090
It's like just shove whatever you're talking about in your face and let me know

105
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:45.500
if it's good.
All righty.
And what are you doing?

106
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:48.950
And um,
so anyways,
yeah.

107
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:51.230
So I'm here in New York are chomping at the bit.

108
00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:54.770
I've wanted to do stand up the last couple of nights,
but my wife won't let me.

109
00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.160
She says,
Hey,
you're going to go out and you're going to buy me some shoes,
buddy.

110
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.080
We haven't been into one single store,
so fuck you.
What are you talking about?
No,

111
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.950
I've just been a little bit lazy.
I've been waking up every morning,
boop,
boop,

112
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.610
boop,
boop.
And I were walking down the street.
I've been,
uh,

113
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.990
I've be going over the Brooklyn Bridge every single day.
That's been my workout.

114
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.520
And then I find some scaffolding and I got wet and I conk out at four,

115
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.730
and then I fucking dropped to the fucking ground and I turn around this some cab

116
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:26.720
driver laughing at me,

117
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.530
right with his yellow stained white button down shirt that he's probably been

118
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:35.150
wearing for the last 15 hours of his shift looking at me like,

119
00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:38.660
Oh gee,
I would love to do some pull ups on scaffolding other than than climb.

120
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:40.730
Instead of climbing up there and actually working on it,

121
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.500
we're talking about white privilege here today on the podcast.
Everybody,

122
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.090
um,
where one part where one person sees slave labor.

123
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.780
I see a gym.
I see a free gym.
Isn't that terrible?

124
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.320
And he was just shaking her head,
I thought you were getting out of here.

125
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.930
I don't like your stylist running shoes.
When did you buy him?

126
00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:10.100
Because of the orange shoelaces.
I'm like,
what that says about me?

127
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:16.190
Yeah,
you are.
You look cute today.
Yeah.
Yeah.

128
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.540
See I did that and insulted the shit out of everybody and you end with something

129
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:25.310
nice and then there you go.
Please try not to drop things.
Um,
all right.

130
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:29.530
What are we going to talk about this whole week,
this week?
Um,

131
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:34.220
all right,
let's,
let's get it over with.
Shut up.

132
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.140
Um,
let's get this over with Lebron James went back to Cleveland.

133
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:40.670
I'll tell you right now.

134
00:08:40.671 --> 00:08:45.320
I don't think I've ever been so fucking disappointed in a city.
You know,

135
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.520
like,
you remember when Lebron left you the first time?

136
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Do you remember how devastated you were or how you cried and threw all his

137
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:57.510
Lebron shit out in your front lawn?

138
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:01.620
You lit it on fire like some checks had been cheated on.
You.
Remember that shit?

139
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.440
Of course you'd do was only four years ago and I didn't,
I didn't judge you.

140
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.330
There's no way that you knew what he was,
but now you know,

141
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.540
and what did you do?
You let them back in.

142
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:19.740
You got back into this relationship with them like Pamela Anderson back in the

143
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.680
day,
getting back with Tommy Lee,
right?
Like he wasn't going to have batted that.

144
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.510
Being a demand at the dome like that wasn't going to fucking happen again.

145
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.340
And Jesus Christ,
fucking Cleveland.

146
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.190
Do you really think that this guy's going to stick around?

147
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.330
How long do you think he's going to be there before he realizes he's in

148
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:42.600
Cleveland again and he's going to start checking out some of the other hot

149
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:47.490
chicks around the leak?
Maybe Chicago.
What about La?

150
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:53.330
They'd done if they hoard them out themselves out enough that their franchise

151
00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:57.710
Twat is just hanging down to their ankles that nobody loved.
Jesus built.

152
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:02.700
Nobody wants to go out there anymore.
I don't know.
Hey Bill,

153
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.530
what are you coming down and Cleveland floor?

154
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.420
We haven't won a championship forever.

155
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.780
Fuck you Cleveland.

156
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.420
You bunch of fucking babies.

157
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.430
Jesus fucking Christ.
Who's been giving you shit?
Nobody.

158
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.740
Nobody chance the fucking year,
1948 nobody does.

159
00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:26.250
You don't have any curse.
You don't have anything.
All right.

160
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.050
All you had to do was build art of fucking stadium,

161
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.100
but you wouldn't do it.
You wouldn't build a football stadium,

162
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:39.000
but you've built a fucking rock and roll hall of fame so they could hang

163
00:10:39.001 --> 00:10:43.980
Brittany Spears jumpsuit next to Mick Jagger's.
These are your priorities.

164
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.360
And as a sports fan,
I'm supposed to feel bad for you.

165
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.520
My heart's supposed to warm.

166
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:55.320
When this guy who cheated on you with the Miami Heat went down there and he got

167
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.810
the fucking professional herps right now.

168
00:10:57.811 --> 00:11:01.050
He's coming back to give it to you when you drop into your fucking knees,

169
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.220
taking your fucking burned up.
But I,
Lebron Jersey,
audio,

170
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.630
little wastepaper basket,
whatever the fuck you have next to your desk.

171
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:11.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

172
00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:15.940
<v 0>Um,
I'm fucking with you guys.
Hey,
I'm happy for you.</v>

173
00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:18.580
He came back.
I hope you guys want to champion chip.

174
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.890
As long as the Lakers don't win,
I'm happy.
I'm excited.
Does I don't like how,

175
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.780
you know I've talked about it before while they claim won more championships

176
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:31.090
than they should.
Who's getting,
no,
I know the pass and the Celtics.

177
00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:35.020
Nobody wants to come play for the Celtics.
It's fucking,
it kills me.

178
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.810
You know,
part of it isn't our problem.
It's the weather.
All right,

179
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.060
this is the op Kate,
look,
you look at the NBA,

180
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:48.430
what is it like 91% African American.
Okay.

181
00:11:48.431 --> 00:11:50.470
So it usually comes down to where do you want to play.

182
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:55.600
So let's say the Celtics are bidding on the same free agent as the Lakers,
right?

183
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.750
So these are the options.
I think I've said this before,
there are options.

184
00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:03.751
You want to come to Boston where it's cold and the racism is off the chats?

185
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.980
Or would you like to play in la where it's warm?

186
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:10.710
There's,
there's,

187
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:15.560
there's celebrity as to bang and the racism is off the chat.

188
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.440
Either way,
you're not going to like the police force.

189
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.310
You know what?
The weather's nice.
I mean,
we can't,

190
00:12:26.311 --> 00:12:30.820
we can't compete with that fucking over.
Um,

191
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.790
I'm just fucking with you.
Cleveland guys ain't,
by the way,

192
00:12:32.791 --> 00:12:35.520
I'm sick of every fucking thing being described as a rant.

193
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.860
Do you know last week I was,

194
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.490
I was just talking about the Dj scene in Vegas,

195
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.080
just talking about,
but the thing now is you've,
you,
if you talk about something

196
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.890
for like more than like two minutes,
all of a sudden it's,
it's called a rant.

197
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.180
Like to me,
isn't rant like short for ranting and raving.

198
00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.130
So I should have been lazy.
Fucking Tara tables.
I mean that,
that is ranting,

199
00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.840
right?
We just fucking talking about something.
I don't know.

200
00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:07.740
I've never looked the word up,
but ranting and also heckling.

201
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.610
Those are the two things that drive me nuts when they say the comedian heckled

202
00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:15.220
the crowd,
the comedian cannot heckle the crowd.

203
00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:18.760
The crowd is not giving a performance that can be interrupted.

204
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:23.570
Do you understand that
Jesus?

205
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.890
Um,
anyways,
so what else?
What else happened in,

206
00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:30.210
so anyways,
he's back.

207
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:31.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

208
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.240
<v 0>Lebron James is back in Cleveland.
You know it's funny,</v>

209
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.120
I thought was hilarious.
Was An uh,
Miami.

210
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.320
They had a picture of the big three in somebody like spray painted over Lebron's

211
00:13:43.321 --> 00:13:47.100
face.
It's like go fuck yourself.
You know what I mean?

212
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:52.530
He was never yours.
How did you get the Guy?
I hate when fans do that.

213
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.570
That was like when Celtics fans were mad.

214
00:13:54.571 --> 00:13:58.380
When Ray Allen went down to the fucking heat.
It's like he wasn't ours.

215
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.940
He wasn't ours.
All right.
He came in,

216
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.570
he came,
we got him off the meat market.

217
00:14:06.571 --> 00:14:11.150
You can't expect the guy not to do that again.
The guy is just super sonic.

218
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:12.241
Okay.

219
00:14:12.241 --> 00:14:15.540
Who's closing out his career with the Celtics and the heat if he hasn't already

220
00:14:15.541 --> 00:14:20.100
retired,
you can't get mad about that.
Alright.
What the fuck?
Kind of heat fan.

221
00:14:20.101 --> 00:14:21.930
Fucking pates over Lebron's face.

222
00:14:21.931 --> 00:14:26.490
The guy brought you to the finals four years in a row and you won two

223
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:30.930
championships.
What's the problem?
I could see if Dwayne Wade left.

224
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.940
Um,
why am I talking about this sport?
I know nothing about.

225
00:14:34.941 --> 00:14:39.230
This is the fucking annoy you guys.
How about that?
Um,

226
00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:44.610
all right.
The war I United States rejoices as the World Cup ends.

227
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.910
Jesus Christ.
But I got to say somebody finally got a real injury.

228
00:14:50.911 --> 00:14:55.580
That guy on Brazil actually broke a vertebrae.
It's always terrifying.

229
00:14:55.581 --> 00:14:59.810
Thank God he's all right.
You know,
as far as broken vertebraes go,

230
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:03.020
at least there was no nerve damage as far as I know.
So that's a good thing.

231
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.070
And uh,
how about the crowds,
man?
How about the Germans?

232
00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:11.930
Not fucking around what they did to Brazil?
That was unbelievable.

233
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.880
That was a football game.
That would have been like,

234
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:18.620
I don't know how many times is seven going to 91 I have no fucking idea what a

235
00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.300
[inaudible] 70,

236
00:15:20.301 --> 00:15:25.301
77 84 13 that'd be like scoring 13 fucking touch stouts.

237
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.180
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

238
00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.330
<v 0>that was the game.
You know what kills me is I missed that game.
I actually,</v>

239
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.730
I take that,
I'm on the road right now.
As I mentioned,

240
00:15:33.731 --> 00:15:36.880
I'm going to watch it when I get back because that is the soccer game.

241
00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:42.210
Every person in the United States has wanted to see forever to have one team

242
00:15:42.881 --> 00:15:47.620
score seven goals or both of them score seven combined for a four to three games

243
00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:52.360
for the love of fucking Christ.
You know,
I'm fucking with you guys.

244
00:15:52.361 --> 00:15:56.680
I actually,
uh,
I watched the final,
I watched it,
uh,
at Paul versus house man.

245
00:15:56.681 --> 00:15:58.710
We had a great time and uh,

246
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.090
<v 1>yeah,</v>

247
00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:01.950
<v 0>and he was laughing.
He was into it.
He's going down,</v>

248
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:05.550
he's going to soccer is the shit.
And we were talking about this stuff.

249
00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:09.150
I swear to God,
we fucked up so bad.

250
00:16:09.151 --> 00:16:13.680
What we should've done was we should have recorded our audio watching that game.

251
00:16:13.681 --> 00:16:18.630
So people in Europe and all around the world could enjoy how fucking ignorant we

252
00:16:18.631 --> 00:16:19.980
are of the Goddamn sport.

253
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.880
Just classic lines like,
Dude,

254
00:16:23.881 --> 00:16:27.930
do you want to stand like how much the world cares about this?

255
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.740
We,
we even recognize how fucking stupid we sounded,

256
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.980
but I got to get this clip.
If anybody can find it

257
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.170
<v 1>at the end of the game</v>

258
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:46.120
<v 0>when Germany one,
and unfortunately Argentine,
a loss,</v>

259
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.540
my condolences out to them.
I actually like both countries.
You know what I mean?

260
00:16:49.541 --> 00:16:53.380
And I think they kind of like each other,
you know,
if you know what I mean.

261
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:58.300
For those of you who read about the fallout after World War II,
um,

262
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.420
the,
uh,
at the end of the game,

263
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:05.340
when they would go in through the crowd and they were showing the German fans,

264
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:07.450
you know,
freaking out,

265
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.910
is there anything scarier than a fucking angry German family?

266
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.533
<v 1>MMM.</v>

267
00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.610
<v 0>When they showed the Argentinian,
whatever the fuck you call them,
uh,</v>

268
00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:19.570
<v 1>okay.</v>

269
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:22.030
<v 0>They cut to this guy and I swear to God,</v>

270
00:17:22.031 --> 00:17:25.270
remember that joke that mean Versie we're doing where we pretended like we were

271
00:17:25.271 --> 00:17:27.340
crying.
Like,
you know,

272
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.340
I'm gonna have such a good time in New York like that.

273
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:34.000
There was a guy in the crowd,
he literally looked like that's how he was crying.

274
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:39.010
The Guy,
he was in his fifties he had one of those hats on,
you know,

275
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:44.160
from back in the fifties and sixties when married guys would join a men's club.

276
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.350
They had to get away from their wives that was getting who they want him to get

277
00:17:47.351 --> 00:17:48.450
blown on,

278
00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:53.360
all weather carpet and some sort of one floor ranch building down the street.

279
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.600
And they'd put that little hat on with the Tassel on the side.

280
00:17:56.601 --> 00:17:59.000
He was wearing one of those and they cut to him and he was,

281
00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:02.480
he was fucking blubbering.
I've never seen it.

282
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:04.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

283
00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.260
<v 0>He was just sitting there.
They cut to it.
He's just like,</v>

284
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.320
and I'm not even joking like what I just did.

285
00:18:11.321 --> 00:18:14.920
You could sync that audio right up to what the fuck he's doing.

286
00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.370
Literally like that.

287
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.510
I don't,
I don't,
I gotta get into this fucking sport.
I don't understand.

288
00:18:25.511 --> 00:18:30.040
Like I have,
I,
I lived through the 78 red sox.

289
00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:31.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

290
00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:35.050
<v 0>I lived through the fucking 85 bears,
crushing my patriots,</v>

291
00:18:35.051 --> 00:18:37.150
the 86 red sox.
Mets.

292
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.140
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

293
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:39.831
<v 0>Jesus Christ.</v>

294
00:18:39.831 --> 00:18:43.130
I don't even fuck all Canadians when we can never beat the fucking Canadians.

295
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:48.590
All of those heartbreaking games,
uh,
the air and boom game,

296
00:18:48.591 --> 00:18:52.150
all of that.
I never at the end of any of those losses when,

297
00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.110
I mean,
what the Fuck Jesus Christ,
what point are you like,

298
00:19:00.111 --> 00:19:04.940
I'm taking this too seriously.
He had just,
he was hopeless.
This fucking guy,

299
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:06.260
it was like,

300
00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:08.840
<v 1>okay.</v>

301
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:13.040
<v 0>It was like he just built his own house by hand.
He had,</v>

302
00:19:13.041 --> 00:19:17.990
he had this some country and he built a house by hand and he had to go back and

303
00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:20.090
get his family and he finally got him and he goes,

304
00:19:20.091 --> 00:19:22.160
this is the house that I built for you.

305
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.740
And then the whole fucking thing just collapsed.

306
00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.710
Then I can understand standing there being like,

307
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.830
I can understand that you just watched the fucking sport where you can't even

308
00:19:33.831 --> 00:19:37.530
use your hands.
And he was sitting there hands down by his side.

309
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:40.490
Oh,
that poor bastard.

310
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.970
That would have been the most uncomfortable feeling ever to give him,

311
00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:47.120
to give him another man a hug like that when they're crying like that,

312
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.460
to just feel them collapse into you

313
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:55.540
first over a soccer game.
Oh,
I know.

314
00:19:55.541 --> 00:19:57.910
It was the championship of the world.

315
00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

316
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.910
<v 0>I get it.
All right.
I understand.
So,
uh,
anyways,</v>

317
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:06.150
congratulations to the Germans.
I mean,

318
00:20:06.151 --> 00:20:11.000
they clearly were the best team and I could say that with confidence because I

319
00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:14.900
watched about,
you know,
collectively maybe about three hours of the World Cup.

320
00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.740
<v 1>Um,
I dunno.</v>

321
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:24.580
<v 0>I Dunno.
It seemed like it seemed like a good fucking game.
All right,</v>

322
00:20:24.581 --> 00:20:28.420
there you go.
That's the end of my riveting World Cup.
Oh,
by the way,

323
00:20:28.421 --> 00:20:32.950
my apologies to Algeria for call new Albania all last week.

324
00:20:32.951 --> 00:20:35.470
I hope I didn't fuck it up again.
Um,

325
00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:37.440
<v 1>okay.</v>

326
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:42.230
<v 0>Whatever.
Just know that I'd bet on you.
Okay.
Does that count as an apology?</v>

327
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.690
Wow.
It gives a shit.
All right,

[inaudible] dot Com Promo Code Bill.
All right,

365
00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:18.580
back to the podcast here.
So [inaudible] uh,

366
00:23:18.581 --> 00:23:21.430
what's going on with me?
Oh you know what's funny,

367
00:23:21.431 --> 00:23:24.580
I have been talking to you guys for the last year and a half about the water

368
00:23:24.581 --> 00:23:29.050
damage on my house.
So to get you updated,
okay.
She give a fuck.

369
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:34.210
My house is a 91 years old and what I quickly learned,

370
00:23:34.211 --> 00:23:38.230
cause we were just going to fix the a the three little shit shack rooms do it

371
00:23:38.231 --> 00:23:42.040
yourself.
A hunk of crap that was underneath my wife's office.

372
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:47.120
Um,
you know,
that's all we were going to fix.

373
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:48.510
But what happens is,

374
00:23:48.511 --> 00:23:52.910
is when you have a house as old as mine and everybody who lived in it before,

375
00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:57.380
you didn't do a fucking thing to it other than just maintain it.

376
00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.110
Um,
when you go into the walls it's,
it's,
it's a shit show.

377
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:09.080
All right.
And what started off as just what I was going to do.

378
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:14.770
Basically my house was initially just a ranch was just a one floor thing and

379
00:24:15.141 --> 00:24:18.200
then downstairs there was like a porch.
And throughout the years they added,

380
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.420
they dug into the hill I guess,

381
00:24:20.421 --> 00:24:24.410
and they added this ground floor and it never really made sense.
Like he,

382
00:24:24.411 --> 00:24:27.290
it seemed like an apartment downstairs in the house.
Upstairs,

383
00:24:27.291 --> 00:24:32.030
there wasn't any flow.
So anyway,

384
00:24:32.031 --> 00:24:36.120
so downstairs and there was like this going into the hill off of the,

385
00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.600
the main room downstairs you'd walk up to stairs,

386
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.710
you'll open the door and then you are at this walk in closet to the left.

387
00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.150
If you kept going straight,

388
00:24:44.151 --> 00:24:47.240
there was another stair and then there was another little room at somebody at

389
00:24:47.241 --> 00:24:52.241
some point was developing pictures back when people use film and Shit is really

390
00:24:52.701 --> 00:24:53.480
creepy looking,

391
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:58.380
you know that that big tub where you fucking would throw the uh,

392
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.270
undeveloped pictures and look like you know,

393
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:06.020
something out of that serial killer show on showtime,
Dexter,
you know,

394
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:10.210
and then you went up one more step and then it was an unfinished area where you

395
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.100
could use for storage.
So all of that got all wet or whatever.

396
00:25:13.101 --> 00:25:18.101
So they took all of that shit out and then dug out all the dirt and made it

397
00:25:18.561 --> 00:25:19.790
level with the floor.

398
00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:24.260
And I'm adding a real fucking bathroom down there and then a nice walk in
closet.

399
00:25:24.261 --> 00:25:27.890
That's all I wanted to do.
Everybody,
that's it.
I got my hands up.
You know,

400
00:25:27.891 --> 00:25:30.170
like when they call a file and you act like you didn't do it.

401
00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.780
And I didn't touch him,
I didn't touch him.
All right,

402
00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:38.020
so they go onto the walls and it is such an absolute shit show down there.

403
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:40.423
You know,

404
00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:46.420
it's turned into an entire remodel of the downstairs and all the way through.

405
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:53.500
I have to get all the plumbing and all the electrical fixed on my house because

406
00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:58.130
the walls and ceilings are open down there.
You might as well get it done.

407
00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.630
I have all fucking galvanized pipe.
Okay.

408
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:07.280
And unknown Buster Keaton probably hauled the shit in while he was struggling in

409
00:26:07.281 --> 00:26:07.910
Hollywood.

410
00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:12.910
You know when this house was initially built and uh oh yeah,

411
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.450
the fucking electrical.
Jesus Christ.
I already had a guy one time

412
00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:23.980
downstairs working on some electrical shit and I was upstairs watching TV or

413
00:26:24.171 --> 00:26:25.490
something and I had the TV off.

414
00:26:25.491 --> 00:26:29.780
I think I was in the TV room and I heard this guy downstairs and like three

415
00:26:29.781 --> 00:26:34.780
times when he was down there trying to figure out why this switch,
these two,
the,

416
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:38.150
the why,
the outlet and the light.
We're on the same switch or something.

417
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.620
Like three times.

418
00:26:39.621 --> 00:26:42.770
I heard him downstairs in the crawl space underneath where I was at.

419
00:26:42.771 --> 00:26:45.720
I would hear what the fuck.

420
00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:52.220
So what is a mess everybody.
And,
uh,

421
00:26:52.221 --> 00:26:57.221
what was going to be this simple little project is now turned into an entire

422
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:03.600
just fucking remodel.
But I'm actually,

423
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:08.250
I've accepted it,
you know,
it's basically going to be like,

424
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.970
say you bought an old car and you just did a body off restoration.

425
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.480
So on top of you have the old carbon underneath,
you got to,

426
00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:17.310
and not even a restoration at this point,
this going to be brand new shit.

427
00:27:17.311 --> 00:27:21.420
So it's like you just went out and you bought state of the art chassis

428
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:25.680
suspension and all of that shit.
So,
uh,
I dunno,

429
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:26.970
I got to do it.

430
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.570
I got to Redo all the pipes and electric coke and then I eliminate the two major

431
00:27:30.571 --> 00:27:31.860
things you don't want.
Okay.

432
00:27:31.861 --> 00:27:36.861
Water flooding and a fire so I can leave town and not worry about that shit.

433
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:43.680
And,
um,
then all I got to worry about is the,
uh,
earthquakes,

434
00:27:43.681 --> 00:27:44.850
mudslides and

435
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.903
<v 1>yeah.</v>

436
00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:51.470
<v 0>Fires and general out there.
Right.
Other than that,
I think I'm all set.
Oh,
Geez.</v>

437
00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:55.510
So I'm hoping the whole fucking thing's going to be done by the end of this.

438
00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:03.530
Um,
so what I'm really trying to say is Billy boys got a lot of road dates coming

439
00:28:03.531 --> 00:28:07.560
up.
Motherfucker.
You know,

440
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:10.680
it's always something I paid off the fucking thing,
right?
That's what I did.

441
00:28:10.681 --> 00:28:12.060
That's what I did with everything that I've made.

442
00:28:12.061 --> 00:28:15.540
I just throw it at my fucking house cause I know how this business ends.

443
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:20.290
The entertainment business does not end nicely.
Okay?

444
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.050
It ends with you sitting there with your hat and your hand goes,
oh,

445
00:28:24.051 --> 00:28:28.140
what do you mean
for me?
You know,
I'm not going to be,

446
00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:32.010
if I'm going to be there guy,
everybody's that guy.
But at the very least,

447
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:34.380
wherever I live is going to be fucking paid for.

448
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.810
So I paid the fucking thing off thinking I'm sitting pretty at throwing a

449
00:28:39.811 --> 00:28:42.870
bathroom and boop a dude who gives a fuck.
And now it's just become,

450
00:28:42.871 --> 00:28:46.900
I feel like I'm going to buy the whole house all over again.
You know,

451
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:50.140
it's an investment.
Buy a house.
It's a fucking investment.

452
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:52.010
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

453
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:55.270
<v 0>Hold on,
I'm letting it go.
Letting it go,
letting it go.</v>

454
00:28:55.271 --> 00:28:58.180
It's going to be beautiful when it's done.
You know,
he's gonna make out in this,

455
00:28:58.181 --> 00:29:02.050
whoever I fucking sell it to cause that that doesn't add value to your house.

456
00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.940
Nobody gives a shit.
Oh,

457
00:29:03.941 --> 00:29:07.330
should you see these copper pipes that are inside the walls?

458
00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.850
No one gives a fight.
Gives a fuck about that.
You know,

459
00:29:09.851 --> 00:29:14.080
buys the house the fucking way.
That's what it really comes down to.

460
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:18.500
Unless you're a single guy or a gay dude with your,
with your gay buddy.
Right.

461
00:29:18.501 --> 00:29:19.510
And he'd come walking in,

462
00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.020
you know when you look out the back yard and you try to see like,

463
00:29:23.021 --> 00:29:25.870
you know what kind of pool party you can have or whatever the fuck it is they

464
00:29:25.871 --> 00:29:29.900
look for.
You know,
I don't pretend to understand.

465
00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:32.390
I don't pretend to speak for other groups,
although I do it all the time.

466
00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:37.270
I guess women like a,
you know,
they come in,
Oh my God,
look at this kitchen.

467
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.650
I love her.
They love kitchens.
But then if he asks him to make a fucking for you,

468
00:29:41.651 --> 00:29:45.460
they flip out.
It's like,
I thought you liked the kitchen.
Well,

469
00:29:45.461 --> 00:29:47.350
I liked it to look at it,
bitch,

470
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.800
get out there and fucking puts on between two slices of bread now.

471
00:29:50.801 --> 00:29:55.360
Or I swear to God,
I'm the lucky out on the porch.
You wouldn't dare.
I would.

472
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.980
I would.
And you don't know any UFC shit.

473
00:29:57.981 --> 00:30:00.760
So I could pick you up right now and put you out there and there's nothing you

474
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:05.560
could do.
Yes.
Is You could scream rape,
you know,

475
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.590
on that ends all the fun,
doesn't it?
Don't you hate when that happens?

476
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:14.320
So anyways,
that's what's going on in my fucking world.
Uh,

477
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.600
oh.
By the way,
I've been getting a ton of shit on Twitter because of,
uh,

478
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.100
me talking about eating right and exercising.

479
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:26.310
I love how people call salads like rabbit food or they do that dumb shit.

480
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.470
We'll joke the cheese to and salad dressing.

481
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:32.530
You might as well have a burger at that point.

482
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.960
You know,
it's like,
first of all,
who doesn't know that?
And then secondly,

483
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.160
it's still not as bad as eating a fucking burger.
You asshole.

484
00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.390
Okay,
I'll give a shit.
How much salad dressing you put on lettuce.

485
00:30:46.391 --> 00:30:49.540
It's not going to lead the fucking heart disease.
All right?

486
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:54.040
Like a delicious juicy Goddamn Burger will.
All right.
You know,

487
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.430
you can't fucking help people.
I'm an old fuck people.

488
00:30:57.431 --> 00:31:00.280
I'm 46 years old and I am.
I'm in the best shape.

489
00:31:00.281 --> 00:31:03.640
I've been in a long time eating that way.
I just go with the balsamic.

490
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:09.250
You fucking negative con.
Some are yours.
Some he enjoyed the keen.
Why?

491
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:15.100
Salad recipes.
They're great.
Shovel it down your pie hole.

492
00:31:15.101 --> 00:31:20.070
It will fill you up.
Stay away from the clown food and the fucking,
uh,

493
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:26.170
in the meats for a couple of days.
You do that twice a week,
twice a fucking week,

494
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:29.890
and just try the other five days.
You'd be amazed what happens.

495
00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:33.160
Be Amazed what fucking happens.
Clown food,
by the way.

496
00:31:33.161 --> 00:31:37.330
His desserts and I call it cloud food because when I'm,

497
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:41.580
when I'm using,
you know,
when I'm eating cookies and shit,

498
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:44.770
desserts look good to me.
But when I got that sugar craving anatomy,

499
00:31:44.771 --> 00:31:49.030
and I'm not even looking at desserts,
when I glance over at the dessert tray,

500
00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.680
that's literally what it looks like.
It looks,

501
00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:54.130
it looks like that's what clowns would eat and that's why their face looks like

502
00:31:54.131 --> 00:31:58.840
that,
you know,
whatever.
It makes sense to me,
you know.

503
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:03.160
All right here near I am bitch moaning and complaining about all this fucking

504
00:32:03.161 --> 00:32:04.210
Shit and uh,

505
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.110
<v 1>okay.</v>

506
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.671
<v 0>I'm going to ask you,</v>

507
00:32:06.671 --> 00:32:10.700
is there anybody who listened to this podcast that lives in Israel or lives in

508
00:32:10.701 --> 00:32:11.534
Palestine?

509
00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:12.580
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

510
00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.880
<v 0>I gotta ask you like how do you,
how do you fucking deal with,</v>

511
00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:17.820
<v 1>yeah,</v>

512
00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:21.270
<v 0>this Hatfield and McCoys shit that's going on over there.
I just look at it.</v>

513
00:32:21.271 --> 00:32:25.570
It's just at some point,
you know,

514
00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:28.720
if you have the money,
why wouldn't you just fucking leave?

515
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.790
I swear to God,
I would just be all right.
You want it here,
take it.

516
00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:37.990
Fuck it to yours.
Here it is.

517
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:44.320
This is the where the guy went with the sandals that everybody gives a shit

518
00:32:45.081 --> 00:32:48.450
about.
You know,

519
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.740
doesn't got an op on all religions.
Doesn't God love everybody?

520
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.990
So why would he give a fuck where you lived if he made all of it?

521
00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.540
But she made all of it or it made all of it.

522
00:33:01.541 --> 00:33:05.890
If we crawled out of the fucking mud,
it's some point,
man.

523
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:08.890
Jesus Christ.
These fucking stories are heartbreaking.

524
00:33:08.891 --> 00:33:12.180
They just shooting missiles at each other's towns.

525
00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:14.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

526
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.210
<v 0>I don't have,
you know,
I don't know.
I get,</v>

527
00:33:16.211 --> 00:33:20.240
I'm trying to think if somebody was just shooting it at la.
What?
I leave you.
Yes.

528
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.110
Yeah,
go to Minnesota.

529
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

530
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.660
<v 0>It's fucking freezing.
Yeah.
Well there's nobody shooting a missile at me.</v>

531
00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.740
I don't,
I don't,
you know,

532
00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.040
obviously if you could tell by the way I'm speaking about it,

533
00:33:35.041 --> 00:33:37.890
I'm ignorant as hell.
Like Israel,

534
00:33:37.891 --> 00:33:40.050
they shot at this fucking police guys house.

535
00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:42.480
They killed like 10 members of his family.

536
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:45.403
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

537
00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:50.790
<v 0>Now what is that going to do?
Is that going to make people on that other side,</v>

538
00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.960
you know,
hate less like,
oh,
now we get it.
Thank you.

539
00:33:56.130 --> 00:34:00.270
Carry on.
You know,
I don't know.

540
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.170
What am I saying here?
Like look at,
look at World War Two.
What was,

541
00:34:04.171 --> 00:34:06.270
was everybody in England supposed to just walk away?

542
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.550
But that Sarah entire country

543
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.270
at Jesus,
what am I suggestion here?
Suggesting?

544
00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.220
Yeah.
I gotta be honest.
I,
I would fucking leave.

545
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:26.150
I just picture and that guy at the end of the Algeria game,
I would just,

546
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:30.230
that would have,
I would,
I just fight would have enough fucking you.

547
00:34:30.231 --> 00:34:34.850
When you want it air,
it is fucking take it.
I'm out.

548
00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:39.770
I'm out.
That's easy to say.
And then what?
You don't know the language.

549
00:34:39.771 --> 00:34:43.380
You got to go somewhere else.
That's what I would do.

550
00:34:43.381 --> 00:34:48.381
I would fucking build a concrete bunker and I would buy like as many Rosetta

551
00:34:50.731 --> 00:34:55.731
stones as as I could afford and I would just try to learn other languages.

552
00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:00.870
I just pick a fucking country and I would,
I would go there

553
00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:03.443
and then what do you do?

554
00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.720
I'm trying to think where I could live other than the United States

555
00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:09.780
as a bunch of places.
I could look Canada,

556
00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.590
I think I could live in England.
What else?

557
00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.510
Definitely live in France.

558
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:26.300
Do you have a job is just take a while,
take a while to get used to it.

559
00:35:26.301 --> 00:35:28.010
All those skinny jeans over there,
you know,

560
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:31.743
<v 1>I dunno.</v>

561
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.800
<v 0>I think I just answered my question.
It's like where you're from,</v>

562
00:35:34.801 --> 00:35:39.400
where the fuck are you going to go?
You just accept it after awhile.
Jesus,

563
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:43.590
this is depressing.
Um,
all right,
let's get to,
uh,
how far into this podcast,

564
00:35:43.591 --> 00:35:47.310
Darwin.
Oh,
foreign to this fucking book.
It's 35 minutes.
Okay.

565
00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:51.480
I think it's time to read a couple of,
uh,
couple of,
uh,

566
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.930
letters for the week here.
Oh,
by the way,
uh,

567
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:59.340
I want to thank everybody who made all those Dj remixes of my,
uh,
my,

568
00:35:59.341 --> 00:36:02.550
my attempt at imitating that music and that's all I was doing.

569
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:05.370
I wasn't saying it wasn't viable or anything like that.

570
00:36:05.371 --> 00:36:06.990
If you really go back and listen to what I was saying,

571
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.150
I was just saying I'm glad to make it a bunch of money.

572
00:36:09.151 --> 00:36:13.770
I hope they save it because I saw this same sort of bubble,
you know,

573
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:18.270
hair metal,
grunge,
boy bands,
standup comedy.
I've seen,

574
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.760
I've seen it over and over and over again.
So I hope they saved them money.

575
00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:24.420
That's what I really was saying.
Really.
It wasn't a rant.
Um,
all right.

576
00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.470
Although maybe it was,
I didn't really go back and listen to it.
All right.
Dj's.

577
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:32.710
Oh.
And if you want to listen to all of the,
uh,
all the Dj remixes from last week,

578
00:36:32.711 --> 00:36:36.110
you can go on to Twitter.
We're going to have them all up there.
Um,

579
00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.510
at the m m podcast is the Twitter handle.

580
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.950
I believe you say at the m M podcast.
Uh,

581
00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:44.820
please follow this podcast there.

582
00:36:44.821 --> 00:36:48.390
We'll have the links to all whatever the fuck I talk about the videos and

583
00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:53.190
whatnot.
All right,
DJ's.
Hey Billy Bass,

584
00:36:53.191 --> 00:36:54.840
drum greetings from Finland.

585
00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.520
I'm a 20 year old musician and for the past few years I've been getting into

586
00:36:59.521 --> 00:37:02.130
electronic music.
Before you call me a mouse head,

587
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:03.930
I don't give a fuck if you like that guy.

588
00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:08.250
I don't hate that guy or one of his Dick Sucking groupies hear me out.

589
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:11.910
I wouldn't know the difference between his,

590
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:17.220
the mouse head looking guy or the other guy who looks like a one of the two

591
00:37:17.221 --> 00:37:20.790
Coreys um,
about that ear rape.

592
00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:22.800
You hear in mainstream clubs,

593
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:26.280
there are a number of Djs or whatever you want to call them,

594
00:37:26.281 --> 00:37:30.600
who actually can play some real instruments.
I play guitar,
drums,
Bass,

595
00:37:30.601 --> 00:37:31.530
and some piano.

596
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.610
It is true that a big part of making music on a computer is editing,

597
00:37:35.611 --> 00:37:38.880
but when you record your own samples and start fucking around with them,

598
00:37:38.881 --> 00:37:42.570
it is as time consuming and tedious as any form of music.

599
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:44.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

600
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.700
<v 0>You know,
you had me right up until then.
Well,
so is painting a house,</v>

601
00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.220
does that mean the guy painting the houses?
Hendrix.

602
00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:51.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

603
00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.930
<v 0>That doesn't make any sense to me,
sir.</v>

604
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:55.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

605
00:37:55.700 --> 00:38:00.290
<v 0>Listen,
I know that that what you're doing is an arc.
Okay?
I'm not,
you know,</v>

606
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:03.260
I'm just,
I'm just making,
I just make fun of Shit.
Okay?
Don't,

607
00:38:03.261 --> 00:38:07.670
don't get all fucking,
don't get any sadder than you are.
All right?

608
00:38:07.671 --> 00:38:11.410
Don't add any more black clothing or eye liner to your fucking wardrobe,
Steve,

609
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:15.440
that's one of the stereotypes.
We don't do that anyways.
He says overrated.

610
00:38:15.441 --> 00:38:19.700
Too much deodorant.
No sane person wants you to smell like nuclear waste.

611
00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.660
Underrated.
I'm using the stairs.

612
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:27.100
I see way too many lazy fucks taking.

613
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:28.500
<v 1>Okay?</v>

614
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.860
<v 0>Always taking the most convenient way.
If you've got a pair of functioning legs,</v>

615
00:38:31.861 --> 00:38:34.770
fucking use them.
You'll thank yourself later.
Anyways,

616
00:38:34.771 --> 00:38:37.960
thanks for reading and I'm looking forward to seeing you in Helsinki again.

617
00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.690
Hold on.
I'm looking forward to coming over there.

618
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.470
That's actually going to become a dangerous part of the world for me.

619
00:38:44.471 --> 00:38:47.710
And people keep saying that I'm trashing djs.
I'm not.

620
00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.153
<v 1>Anyways.</v>

621
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:55.420
<v 0>You know what's funny?
Nobody ever thinks that they're part of the problem.</v>

622
00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.060
You know,
your music is ear rape.

623
00:38:58.061 --> 00:39:02.950
What I make is this tedious is learning the oboe.
Beep,
boop,
boop,

624
00:39:02.951 --> 00:39:05.500
boop,
boop.
Uh,
all right.

625
00:39:05.501 --> 00:39:08.830
Thoughts from Atlanta a they ability,
red face.

626
00:39:08.831 --> 00:39:12.910
Hope this message finds you reading the Monday morning podcasts,
uh,

627
00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:17.710
reading it on time.
Ha Ha.
Realtime media.
It can be challenging.

628
00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:22.510
This message is from the ATL slash hot Hotlanta.
I hated that.

629
00:39:22.511 --> 00:39:25.510
I missed your show at the Tabernacle.
Love the venue.

630
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:29.530
Have never seen a comedy show there.
I have those seen the dead weather,

631
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:35.080
the ray contours,
the white stripes,
widespread panic,
the black keys and many,

632
00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:38.290
many other great performing artists.
I'm glad you have turned.

633
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:44.200
You've been turned on to Alison Mosshart.
Oh yes.
She's the lead singer of uh,

634
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:47.470
uh,
the dead weatherman.

635
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:51.380
I was saying last week that she's a rockstar and this guy's a green saying yeah,

636
00:39:51.381 --> 00:39:53.920
she is a true fucking rockstar.
Amazing.

637
00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:57.520
Great back story on how she started working directly with Jack White after a

638
00:39:57.521 --> 00:40:02.521
show at the Tabernacle while the rec rank contours over the fuck you say we're

639
00:40:03.071 --> 00:40:07.810
playing with the kills Jack White saw her,
uh,

640
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:11.410
thought she was the shit.
Everyone knows it.

641
00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:13.840
What Jack White though was the shit.

642
00:40:13.841 --> 00:40:17.770
Everyone knows that if you don't then you need to crawl out of your cave and

643
00:40:17.771 --> 00:40:18.790
rejoin society.

644
00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:20.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

645
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:21.440
<v 0>Did I read that right?</v>

646
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:23.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

647
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:27.110
<v 0>I guess she was playing with the kills and was opening for Jack Whites band and</v>

648
00:40:27.111 --> 00:40:29.510
he saw her thought she was the shit and that's how they uh,

649
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:30.980
<v 1>okay.</v>

650
00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.200
<v 0>They got together.
I think that that's what the point was.</v>

651
00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:37.450
I apologize for my reading.
Um,
anyways,
she said I want to take a minute,

652
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:38.540
share a few thoughts with you.

653
00:40:38.541 --> 00:40:40.970
I've been listening to your podcast for a little over a year now.

654
00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:45.200
A few items I feel compelled to comment on.
Fat Shaming.
Thank you.

655
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:48.800
I've been very focused on my health over the last year and dropping off the

656
00:40:48.801 --> 00:40:53.030
wagon for about two years.
It feels great.
Getting back in shape.

657
00:40:53.031 --> 00:40:57.260
Your podcast is motivating and I'm typically listening to it while I'm working

658
00:40:57.261 --> 00:41:00.440
out or while traveling on a plane or in a car being

659
00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.550
stationary and reminding myself I need to work out.
Uh,

660
00:41:05.551 --> 00:41:08.970
if you don't like the fat shaming,
then don't listen to the fucking program.

661
00:41:08.971 --> 00:41:12.780
It's not like there's not a million other things to listen to.
Um,
yeah,

662
00:41:12.781 --> 00:41:15.750
I think I do fat shaving with a twinkle in my eye,
right.

663
00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:21.300
Anyways,
vegetarian food at Chinese and Thai restaurants.
So yeah,

664
00:41:21.301 --> 00:41:24.090
I keep bringing that up.
Like if I Google Vegetarian restaurant there,

665
00:41:24.091 --> 00:41:25.920
we show these Chinese and Thai restaurants.

666
00:41:25.921 --> 00:41:30.510
He says the reason this shows up is these cuisines are great for vegetarians.

667
00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:35.630
Uh,
if you go to a real Chinese restaurant,
not some American Chinese crap,

668
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.890
the food is way more focused on the vegetables and is actually quite healthy.

669
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:41.990
Ties a little harder to find healthy.

670
00:41:41.991 --> 00:41:46.070
But there are generally are a few great options at Authentic Thai Restaurants,

671
00:41:46.071 --> 00:41:50.090
Aka not mouth breathing mall food.
If you don't believe me,

672
00:41:50.091 --> 00:41:54.040
next time you're in Atlanta or I'm in La,
I'll prove it to you.
Um,

673
00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:58.700
um,
dude,
I believe you if we don't have to have a lunch date here.

674
00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:03.020
Um,
anyways,
yeah,
I just,
yeah,
you know,

675
00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:04.850
one of my version of Chinese food is that,

676
00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:08.120
you know that fucking food you eat and 10 minutes later you're hungry again.

677
00:42:08.121 --> 00:42:10.910
That really unhealthy shit.
So I,
uh,

678
00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:16.490
I really ought to look into that a little bit more I guess.
But,
um,

679
00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:17.780
<v 1>okay.</v>

680
00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:19.400
<v 0>Anyways.
Oh,
I,
you know what I am,
I forgot to do,</v>

681
00:42:19.401 --> 00:42:22.040
I wanted to apologize to saw the World Cup fans cause some people get annoyed

682
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:26.180
with me trashing,
you know,
I just like fucking irritating you guys.
You know,

683
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:29.030
it's fun.
And I think in your heart of hearts,

684
00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.000
it really bugs you that the United States doesn't give a fuck.

685
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:33.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

686
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.680
<v 0>About the World Cup.
And I know right now you're like,
oh,
fuck off.
But you know,</v>

687
00:42:37.681 --> 00:42:38.514
it's true.

688
00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:39.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

689
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:42.540
<v 0>And I think in your heart of hearts you actually want to be an American,</v>

690
00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:43.733
don't you?

691
00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:44.810
<v 1>Okay,</v>

692
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:49.730
<v 0>come on.
You can have a standard sized about that.
Just being some fat.</v>

693
00:42:49.731 --> 00:42:51.980
Fuck on your way to a more like a Walmart.

694
00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:53.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

695
00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:57.960
<v 0>Listen to some country music with your fucking jaw hanging open.
Alright.</v>

696
00:42:58.660 --> 00:42:59.890
Some ill fitting hat

697
00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.480
listening to some country guy rubbing your balls.

698
00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:07.360
View no lack the south.

699
00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:13.140
You can get the fuck out cause this is America and we ain't changing for nobody.

700
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:18.981
Right?

701
00:43:18.981 --> 00:43:22.700
And then they start playing a violin and it makes you want to leap out of the

702
00:43:22.701 --> 00:43:25.310
truck.
Come on.
You know we wouldn't want to do that for like a couple of weeks.

703
00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:27.760
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

704
00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.190
<v 0>European stock.
Australia's stop coming.</v>

705
00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:32.370
Visiting here and visiting the coastal city.

706
00:43:32.371 --> 00:43:36.220
See the real America getting the middle of it.
Get the fuck in hot land.

707
00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:41.410
Go to some of our d e and F fuckin cities.
All right,

708
00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.500
why don't you get it?
Why don't you go out there and do some of that shit?

709
00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:47.590
Just fucking drive around.
Okay.

710
00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:51.910
And I challenge you to walk into my maybe four Walmarts in the middle of nowhere

711
00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:55.570
and not break down like that Argentinian guy.
Ooh.
All right.

712
00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:57.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

713
00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:02.080
<v 0>Was there any point to be made there?
I don't think there was.
Um,
all right.</v>

714
00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:06.010
Other instrument?
Uh,
dear Billy Coltrane,

715
00:44:06.011 --> 00:44:07.810
you played drums and that's awesome.

716
00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:12.660
You're a bonafide cool kid because I suck at drums.
All right,

717
00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:13.391
I'll take daddy said,

718
00:44:13.391 --> 00:44:17.560
but if you could play a second instrument and be a master of it,
uh,

719
00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:21.190
what would you play?
Sorry,
guitar is not an option.
Why?

720
00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:26.230
Why isn't it a fucking option?
Because you say so.
All right.
I'll roll with it.

721
00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:30.130
You got to choose between his saxophone,
trombone,
flute,
a violin,

722
00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.870
what should and what genre music would,
uh,

723
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:39.290
would you want to be the master of?
Thanks.
And go flute yourself.
Oh,
Jesus.

724
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:45.330
Jesus with the ponds over there.
Um,

725
00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.990
if I a saxophone,
trombone,
trombone darted out,
trombones,

726
00:44:48.991 --> 00:44:53.910
a Badass fucking and Smith.
When you're muted with the plunger and like trumpet.

727
00:44:53.911 --> 00:44:54.744
Trombone.

728
00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.050
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

729
00:44:56.050 --> 00:45:00.010
<v 0>What would I play?
I don't know either that New Orleans shit or like,</v>

730
00:45:00.011 --> 00:45:04.930
I like the trombone player in uh,
in James Brown's band.

731
00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:08.080
Fred.
Fred who?

732
00:45:08.081 --> 00:45:11.980
Bomp bomp bomp put the Burger de de de de de Right.

733
00:45:11.981 --> 00:45:14.050
Whatever the fucking song doing it to death.

734
00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:17.650
I can't remember the name of the song or did I tell you guys I found a fucking

735
00:45:17.651 --> 00:45:19.150
killer.
James Brown.

736
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:21.030
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

737
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:22.190
<v 0>A killer.
James Brown.</v>

738
00:45:22.191 --> 00:45:26.890
Like an a new version or a different take of a

739
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:28.250
<v 1>okay.</v>

740
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:32.240
<v 0>Of I feel good.
You got to hear this shit.
Hang on a second.
Let me see if I can,</v>

741
00:45:32.241 --> 00:45:37.130
uh,
bring this up real quick.
James Brown right there.
Click on that.

742
00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:38.950
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

743
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:42.850
<v 0>This is how much of a fucking genius this guy is.
Where the hell is it?
Hot Pants.</v>

744
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.480
Here it is.
Listen to this shit.

745
00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:11.160
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Tell me you can listen to that fucking 9,000 times in a row.

746
00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:11.801
You've got to listen to that.

747
00:46:11.801 --> 00:46:14.700
A whole song other than the bridge is the only thing that's sort of sounds like

748
00:46:14.701 --> 00:46:19.320
the original version that just sounds like him fucking around trying to figure

749
00:46:19.321 --> 00:46:23.790
out how he's going to do it.
Yeah,
it did get Gail.
Um,

750
00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.850
yeah,
I would play trombone.
I also really liked the trumpet.

751
00:46:26.851 --> 00:46:30.240
I feel like that's an unbelievably powerful instrument.

752
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:35.160
And my dad had a record when I was a kid,
Ted Heath and his orchestra,

753
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.593
<v 1>uh,</v>

754
00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.360
<v 0>swing as king.</v>

755
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:39.530
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

756
00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:44.530
<v 0>And they had a couple of sections with where it was just a trumpet Solo or just</v>

757
00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:48.740
the horn section would kick in and the,
and it was,
you know,
fucking blue,

758
00:46:48.741 --> 00:46:50.900
Yada Yada.
You share when you were listening to it,

759
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:55.610
if he had a nice high fi system back in the day there and a,

760
00:46:55.611 --> 00:46:58.580
I remember the first time I went and I saw a big band alive.

761
00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:03.590
I went to Berkeley and I think I told this story before I went to Berkeley and

762
00:47:03.591 --> 00:47:04.010
it was

763
00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:05.090
<v 1>the,
uh,</v>

764
00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:10.860
<v 0>the buddy rich band and buddy was,
uh,
he was gone by then.</v>

765
00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:12.990
Even gone probably like five,
six years.

766
00:47:12.991 --> 00:47:15.290
So they just would have these all star drummers come in.

767
00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:16.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

768
00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:20.280
<v 0>And play with the band and I could not fucking believe.</v>

769
00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:21.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

770
00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:25.550
<v 0>Like a big band was basically it was four trombones,
four saxophones,</v>

771
00:47:25.551 --> 00:47:26.540
four trumpets.

772
00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:28.730
<v 1>And uh,</v>

773
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:33.530
<v 0>I mean these guys when they would just,</v>

774
00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:38.480
just fucking all of them but play 16 fucking people blowing on horns,

775
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:42.500
you fucking it blow your goddamn wood back man was unbelievable.

776
00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:46.670
So I've always loved that kind of music.
Um,

777
00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:48.670
<v 1>yeah,</v>

778
00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:51.310
<v 0>I dunno the shift that I'm listening to now,</v>

779
00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:55.240
like I got an a rental car a couple of weeks ago and I just decided I was going

780
00:47:55.241 --> 00:47:59.140
to listen to the pop station so I could kind of know what was going on just

781
00:47:59.141 --> 00:48:01.150
because as a comedian you got it.

782
00:48:01.151 --> 00:48:05.280
Somehow it's your job to kind of know what's going on out there.

783
00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:07.780
I'll show you act,
we'll really start feeling dated.

784
00:48:07.781 --> 00:48:11.410
Like I mentioned a couple months ago when I use Brittany Spears is a reference

785
00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:13.840
as like when I was talking about,
you know,

786
00:48:13.841 --> 00:48:17.320
some young floozy and it bombed.

787
00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:20.620
Like it got nothing in front of this younger crowd.
And then I had to be like,

788
00:48:20.621 --> 00:48:22.060
wait a minute.
She's like a 32,

789
00:48:22.061 --> 00:48:25.090
33 divorced mother of two or three kids at this point.

790
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:28.480
She's not 19 anymore.
Bill,
you know,

791
00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:32.530
fucking 14 years has gone by since.
Oops.

792
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:40.230
Um,
AH,
put on some clothes.
You fucking whore.
But God bless you.

793
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:43.360
You made your money,
you made your money.

794
00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.250
<v 2>Fuck it.</v>

795
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:51.460
<v 0>Um,
what am I saying?
So yeah.</v>

796
00:48:51.461 --> 00:48:55.600
So that actually has led me into listening to all kinds of other fucking shit.

797
00:48:55.601 --> 00:49:00.370
Plus I played drums,
you know,
as the hobby.
And uh,
so I've always liked,

798
00:49:00.371 --> 00:49:04.360
uh,
I guess rap music.
I refuse to call it hip hop.

799
00:49:04.361 --> 00:49:05.710
I'm too white to call it hip hop.

800
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:09.160
It just doesn't sound right coming up that rap music.

801
00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.410
That sounds right coming out of my mouth,
but like a,

802
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:14.040
<v 1>yeah,</v>

803
00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:18.510
<v 0>I like,
uh,
what was the guy I've been listening to?
Little Wayne's new one,</v>

804
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.620
rich as fuck.
I just really liked the drums in that.

805
00:49:22.621 --> 00:49:27.130
And I also think he's fucking hilarious.
Well behind your back,

806
00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:28.490
like nunchucks and that's fun.

807
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:29.463
<v 2>Nope,</v>

808
00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:35.460
<v 0>I find myself laughing when I'm listening to his shit.
He's also amazing,</v>

809
00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:41.160
you know,
fuck Dalkin let's do it all right enough with that shit.

810
00:49:41.161 --> 00:49:44.350
So that's what I'm meant to.
And if I could,
yeah,
trombone.
I would love that.

811
00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:49.140
If I had,
if I could be like Bill Murray in groundhog day,
I would master drums,

812
00:49:49.141 --> 00:49:53.610
Guitar,
trumpet,
Trombone,
piano.
That would probably be it.

813
00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:58.470
And uh,
maybe base,

814
00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:02.860
I dunno,
you know what I,
there's a guy I actually follow on Youtube.

815
00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:05.140
If you're a bass player,
this fucking guy's the shit.

816
00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:09.910
Like he plays all the great fucking,
uh,

817
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000
songs that have just unbelievable baselines from funk all the way to like,

818
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.240
you know,
cover shit that you should know if you play in a band like that song,

819
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:22.990
uh,
that eight,
six,
seven,
five,
three Oh nine,

820
00:50:22.991 --> 00:50:26.800
he plays that shit and he's just a really,
he's a pro.
I'll,
I'll actually,

821
00:50:26.801 --> 00:50:29.270
I'll that link up.
Uh,
we'll have it up on the Twitter,

822
00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:33.170
the at the m m a podcast,
Twitter handle.

823
00:50:33.171 --> 00:50:36.890
We'll have all of that shit up there for you.
Um,
so yeah,

824
00:50:36.891 --> 00:50:40.700
that's basically what I would dip,
shut this fucking thing off.

825
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:43.850
Jesus Christ.
What did I do?

826
00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.010
Please tell me I didn't fuck this whole podcast up.
Is that better?

827
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:53.210
Was I leaning on this thing forever?
Well I don't have time to fix it.

828
00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:58.300
God dammit.
Some point I'm gonna make,

829
00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:00.860
I'm gonna make this a professional operation.
All right,

830
00:51:00.861 --> 00:51:05.810
let's get to the next little,
I guess the final one here.
Um,
tennis.

831
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.040
Oh by the way,
the flute,

832
00:51:07.041 --> 00:51:12.041
the flute is the one fucking instrument that this just know there was,

833
00:51:12.141 --> 00:51:16.560
there's no cool way to play that instrument.
You know,

834
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:22.060
they just isn't and I don't want to hear about Jethro Tull bid.
It is dope.

835
00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:26.880
I know.
Want to hear it.
Um,
yeah,
the flute,

836
00:51:26.881 --> 00:51:28.890
the Piccolo,
like those are,

837
00:51:28.891 --> 00:51:32.010
those are great little add ons when you have an entire symphony.

838
00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:37.380
Like that's like the curb finders for the,
uh,
you know,

839
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:40.830
I remember back in the day when you're like,
all right,
I've tinted the windows,

840
00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:45.480
I have my vanity plate.
You know,

841
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:51.270
I got a,
yeah,
got fuzzy dice hanging from the fucking rear view mirror.

842
00:51:51.271 --> 00:51:53.940
What,
what's the last thing you put curb finders on?

843
00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.640
Cause she didn't want to damage your rims.

844
00:51:57.210 --> 00:52:01.790
That's what a flu to like a Piccolo is.
I mean,
who would even risk,

845
00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:06.110
there's no way somebody just plays the Piccolo like you.

846
00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:11.420
You're definitely playing multiple fucking instruments and you like the utility

847
00:52:11.421 --> 00:52:14.930
guy on the team like,
Hey,
we need you to play right field.
All right,

848
00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:18.500
I'll play the fucking Piccolo.
Right?
Um,
all right.
Tennis.

849
00:52:18.501 --> 00:52:22.700
Anyone dear Billy Agassi.
Ah,
this person says,

850
00:52:22.701 --> 00:52:24.200
I've heard you mention anything.

851
00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:26.780
I have never heard you mention anything about playing tennis.

852
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:29.060
It sounds to me like a sport.

853
00:52:29.061 --> 00:52:33.800
You and the lovely Nia would enjoy your in your Jack Lalaine stage and health

854
00:52:33.801 --> 00:52:35.240
seems to be important to you.

855
00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:39.290
Tennis is a great workout and after playing a handful of times,

856
00:52:39.291 --> 00:52:42.500
you can actually see yourself getting better.
In your case,

857
00:52:42.501 --> 00:52:46.550
we wouldn't call them tennis whites.
We called them tennis,
pasty whites.

858
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:49.100
Hey,
every body,

859
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:56.390
that guy,
um,
what's your history with the sport ever?

860
00:52:56.391 --> 00:52:57.630
Give it a go.
Yeah.

861
00:52:57.631 --> 00:53:01.940
I grew up in the 80s the big tennis boom was in the 70s so you know,

862
00:53:01.941 --> 00:53:03.680
the fallout of it was still there.

863
00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:08.980
I still have an oversized fucking racket probably with cat guts strengths.

864
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:15.170
Um,
no offense Peta,
but that's the way they made them back then.

865
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:19.010
And maybe the nylon.
I have no fucking idea.
Um,

866
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:23.000
I like,
I love tennis.
I love watching it and that type of shit.

867
00:53:23.001 --> 00:53:27.120
As far as running around I,
my back and Shin splints,
I'm not fucking doing that.

868
00:53:27.121 --> 00:53:30.900
I,
I see,
you know those people who play those running around sports,

869
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.270
basketball and all of them.
You have,

870
00:53:33.271 --> 00:53:36.360
you ever see those guys when they get to their thirties and into their forties,

871
00:53:36.361 --> 00:53:41.040
and they're still fucking coming out there tape from the ankle all the way up to

872
00:53:41.041 --> 00:53:45.180
their hip.
Your body was not designed to fucking do that.
Running around.

873
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:47.670
I play on a grass surface.

874
00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:54.750
If they got a local,
a Wimbledon replica,
I'd fucking play on that shit.

875
00:53:55.330 --> 00:53:58.650
Um,
you know,
it's funny.
So I got a tennis racket.
Like everybody,

876
00:53:58.651 --> 00:54:03.300
I played a little bit,
um,
in the 80s with my buddies,
you know,

877
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:06.630
and we would talk all kinds of shit.
We go out there and we'd get drunk,

878
00:54:06.631 --> 00:54:07.860
go down with the public court.
You know,

879
00:54:07.861 --> 00:54:11.760
the one that had the cracks in it with the grass coming up and like no net,
see,

880
00:54:11.761 --> 00:54:14.310
just tie a string across it and he'd be playing at night.

881
00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:16.830
You'd be arguing if it went over under,
remember that Shit.

882
00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:20.680
That's the way we'd play.
We had to great time.
And um,

883
00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:23.950
so when I moved out and went to New York City,
you know,

884
00:54:23.951 --> 00:54:27.310
when I was packing the vitals,
obviously the tennis racket didn't make it.

885
00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:31.630
And I remember,
uh,
when one time I met this really,

886
00:54:31.631 --> 00:54:35.200
really nice woman,
I wanted to go on a date and she was like,

887
00:54:35.201 --> 00:54:39.460
she suggested blank tennis because she was nice,

888
00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:42.370
you know,
rather than going and getting boobs.
And I was like,
yeah,

889
00:54:42.371 --> 00:54:44.650
I've got a tennis racket.
And I liked her so much.

890
00:54:44.651 --> 00:54:49.651
Actually had my parents mail me my tennis racket down through me and I went out

891
00:54:51.521 --> 00:54:53.050
to Brooklyn and we played tennis

892
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:58.960
and she won.

893
00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:03.340
And that was the end of that were low at them saying,
no,

894
00:55:03.341 --> 00:55:07.890
the relationship lasts a little bit longer than that.
But yeah,
that's probably I,

895
00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:12.210
I don't,
I'm not into that shit.
Yeah,
I'm not into a,

896
00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:16.000
although I got to tell you one of the Brooklyn Bridge and I jogged across that

897
00:55:16.001 --> 00:55:20.440
all the way back to my hotel and I was surprised that I had that kind of wind.

898
00:55:20.441 --> 00:55:23.710
But I got back into skipping rope again,
David tell you guys,

899
00:55:23.711 --> 00:55:27.890
this is the workout that I used to do back in the day.
I would,
uh,

900
00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:32.920
I put on classic sports network before they got bought up by fucking ESPN and

901
00:55:35.061 --> 00:55:39.860
um,
I would tape old fights or you know,
of de la Jolla.

902
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:44.570
He was the big guy back then.
Um,
you know,
if he had a nice 12 round fight,

903
00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:49.370
I would,
I would record it and hopefully it went like nine,
10,
11,
12 rounds.

904
00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:54.260
And then what I would do was when I would watch it during my workout and what I

905
00:55:54.261 --> 00:55:57.770
would do is I,
when the boxes were fighting,
I would be skipping rope.

906
00:55:58.130 --> 00:56:01.490
I would skip rope and I would be watching the fight.
And when they rested,

907
00:56:01.491 --> 00:56:04.970
I would stop skipping rope.
And then,
uh,

908
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:08.810
when they started fighting again,
I was back on the,
on the,
on the rope.

909
00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:12.860
And I would just try to just build myself up to see how many fucking rounds I

910
00:56:12.861 --> 00:56:15.260
could get to and uh,

911
00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:21.150
we really gained an appreciation for the kind of fucking shape that those guys

912
00:56:21.151 --> 00:56:24.940
are in.
Cause you just sit in there jumping up and down.
We,
we,
we,
we,

913
00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:29.260
they're actually trying to prevent somebody from beating the shit out of them

914
00:56:29.261 --> 00:56:30.820
while they try and beat the shit out of them.

915
00:56:30.821 --> 00:56:34.240
You know that if you have had a fight in your fucking life,
you know,

916
00:56:34.241 --> 00:56:38.080
if nobody trains to have a bar fight,
it just fucking happens.

917
00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:41.450
Do you remember that shit?
How,
when did you were after like the,

918
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:44.860
I mean how long has a bar fight last?
It's like under,
under,

919
00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:46.840
usually under 30 seconds.

920
00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.500
You hear the glass break and hear all the fucking shit.

921
00:56:50.501 --> 00:56:54.840
If you actually cut out all the shit talk and,
and sue,
oh fuck,

922
00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:57.000
you fuck her with the [inaudible].

923
00:56:57.310 --> 00:57:00.790
If you want to cut out all of that shit and just get down to the fighting aspect

924
00:57:00.791 --> 00:57:03.070
of it,
it's usually under 30 seconds.

925
00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:08.320
And I swear to God like how hard you're breathing.
It is ridiculous.

926
00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:13.240
And these guys are just 12 rounds of that shit.
It's just,
it's unbelievable.

927
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:18.280
Um,
so that's the kind of thing,
because I hate going to the fucking gym.

928
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:22.610
I hate to end cardio and all that type of stuff.
So,
um,

929
00:57:24.130 --> 00:57:29.130
I always try to have something going on that I can do that just doesn't have me

930
00:57:29.621 --> 00:57:33.010
staring at the clock and I feel like I'm in science class back in the day,

931
00:57:33.011 --> 00:57:37.690
you know?
So,
uh,
so there you go.
That's one to grow on everybody.

932
00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:42.220
Um,
I think I hit everything.
I might have to pull up a little bit short here.
Oh,

933
00:57:42.221 --> 00:57:46.960
you know what?
I forgot the last advertising for this week is uh,

934
00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:51.640
oh,
the wonderful,
the lovely,
the always lovely dollar shave club.
Everyone,

935
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:54.760
the big razor companies think we're stupid.
Everybody.

936
00:57:54.970 --> 00:57:59.770
Every year they roll out some ridiculous shaving technology gimmick and expect

937
00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:01.840
us to shell out the big bucks for it.

938
00:58:02.050 --> 00:58:04.720
Do you really need a razor with a vibrating handle?

939
00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:09.790
A roller pivot ball back scratcher,
egg timer,
laser point.

940
00:58:09.791 --> 00:58:14.200
A corkscrew?
I know I don't.
All right,
and you don't.

941
00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:15.521
Uh,

942
00:58:15.521 --> 00:58:19.630
we were shaving just fine before any of that junk and I definitely don't need to

943
00:58:19.631 --> 00:58:24.490
spend my hard earned cash on it.
If you are sick of being treated like a fool,

bucks a month,
month.

948
00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:39.520
Their blades are better than the big shave companies for a fraction of the
price.

949
00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:43.630

It's the purpose.

954
00:59:00.101 --> 00:59:04.540
Perfect way to make peace with your face after the disruptive act of shaving.

955
00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:09.430
By the way,
underrated,
underrated aftershave lotion.

956

You actually need a nice pre shave lotion and an aftershave lotion.
Trust me,

957
00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.590
your face.
We'll love you forth.
Look at me.

958
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:20.590
I feel like I'm doing an old aqua velvet commercial.
Um,

959
00:59:20.591 --> 00:59:24.650
so I would recommend that a stop getting ripped off by the big shave companies.

960
00:59:24.651 --> 00:59:29.651
Join Dollar Shave club.com/bur bur r that's dollar shave club.com/bur bur are

Alright.
Never have to buy razors again.
Well,
he got to buy him,

962
00:59:34.761 --> 00:59:36.110
but then you don't have to go out to go buy.

963
00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:39.200
You don't have to pay too much for him.
That's all I'm trying to say.

964
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:42.920
All right everybody.
I believe that that's the podcast for this week.

965
00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:47.930
I had a wonderful time shooting a cheat with you.
Um,

966
00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:51.020
what do I got coming up?
I got the,
uh,
the benefits.

967
00:59:51.021 --> 00:59:54.350
All the information's up on bill bird.com.
I got it tonight.
Tomorrow.

968
00:59:54.351 --> 00:59:57.950
It's a benefit to,
uh,
to help out starving children.

969
00:59:57.951 --> 01:00:02.810
I will be a manning the lines spooning out food during the afternoon and I'll be

970
01:00:02.811 --> 01:00:07.580
doing the show late at night.
I was going to be doing it with James Smith.
Uh,

971
01:00:07.581 --> 01:00:09.410
unfortunately he's a little bit under the weather.

972
01:00:09.411 --> 01:00:13.580
I hope he's feeling better soon.
So,
uh,
we got Paul,

973
01:00:13.581 --> 01:00:18.380
don't say I'm from Jersey.
Versie is going to be opening and,
um,

974
01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.830
it's going to be a great time.
It's for a great cause.

975
01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:26.740
And later on this month I will be up doing the Montreal comedy festival,

976
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:31.160
going to be hosting one of the gala's,
bringing it on all the,
you know,

977
01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:36.700
the new talent that's going to come along and will the industry forced me out of

978
01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:41.660
the business.
Um,
anyways,
I'm very looking forward to that.

979
01:00:41.661 --> 01:00:42.261
And other than that,

980
01:00:42.261 --> 01:00:46.190
I'm not doing shit other than spending all my money on the ground floor of my

981
01:00:46.191 --> 01:00:49.460
fucking house.
All right,
everybody,
that's it.
Go fuck yourselves.

982
01:00:49.461 --> 01:00:52.280
Have a great week.
I'll talk to you next time.
All right.
Bye.
