00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:10.011
We got one advertisement here and of course I'm reading this advertisement.

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.950
Well after I did the whole fucking interview with the wonderful Adler family,

<v 1>Gudo Poo pooed me undies.
Me undies.</v>

8
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.660
You won't get a hernia because those things will hold your balls nice and tight

9
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.400
against your tank to put them on.
It'll feel like velvet.

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You won't need to get a hand job because your underwear is like a fuck and hot

11
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:50.540
chicks hand.
That's fucking gross.
Sorry.
Whatever.
Me undies,

If you want to elevate your underwear,

13
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.660

Didn't stop.
Now I got a pump type in my fucking password.

18
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.030
This is just not the way to do this.
Uh,
you've perfected your wardrobe,

19
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.650
but what about the stuff?
Not everybody gets to see.

Sorry,
I didn't get him interrupted.
All right,

57
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.850
Let's hear his brother.
Jamie's here.
Dan is here.

58
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.760
I feel like it went over that house for Thanksgiving.
They've come over here.

59
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.410
Then it's just going to be,
it's going to be a fun shelf.

60
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.730
This is going to remind me going home for the holidays,
so I'm sorry.

61
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.840
The enhancers.
Snoop books,
sweet child of mine,

62
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.740
which is basically her story of having,

63
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.020
it's a story of unconditional love between a mother and a son and not only that,

64
00:04:09.471 --> 00:04:10.480
it's a story about it,

65
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:14.330
how many mistakes and mother can make in her relationship with his son.

66
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.960
And so I made a lot of mistakes.

67
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.800
I got him off.
Where would be like,
why?

68
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.390
This is the first time I've ever heard of myth.
It's true.
Oh God.

69
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.630
This is becoming like doctor Phil here.
You guys.
Yeah,

70
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:32.660
it was bring some tissues over here in a minute.
He did.
Um,
Branton dead.

71
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.500
I actually,
I uh,
you know,
I got,
believe it or not in my podcast,

72
00:04:36.501 --> 00:04:39.030
listeners know I'm a terrible reader.
I can't read out loud.

73
00:04:39.031 --> 00:04:43.040
I'm really bad and I just got the book yesterday.
I count sing so it's okay.

74
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.903
There you go.

75
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.450
So I got all the way up to like I got up to about page 75 of the book and it's

76
00:04:47.451 --> 00:04:49.640
incredible.
Just what I mean I keep,
you know,

77
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.550
I can't wait until for the next hundred months stand.
I'm stopping.

78
00:04:52.551 --> 00:04:56.570
That's just as far as I got.
Cause I read slow but good to things like your,

79
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.160
your day at go the first mom.
His Steven.
All right.
Do you slapped?

80
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.740
But it was in the arm though.
That's a misdemeanor.

81
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.340
It goes through the hand,
the arm,
the shoulder to phase the head where you weigh.

82
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.410
Uh,
we,
cause my mother hit us when we were kids.
I mean it was just,

83
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.330
you spanked and then you moved up to the paddle wooden spoon to you.

84
00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:18.980
One of those wouldn't spine all of the wooden spoon.
All right.

85
00:05:18.981 --> 00:05:21.800
Let me ask you this Steven,
your,
your preference as a child,

86
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.440
was that the wooden spoon be random blunt object.
Yeah,

87
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.390
we get the hairbrush.
I got that.
I was a hairbrush a couple of times,

88
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.000
of course to random object thrown through the air.

89
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.550
They had definitely say see you,

90
00:05:34.551 --> 00:05:37.640
your vault and you got to have beautiful healthy.
You look really good.

91
00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:42.260
You're very answered that me,
my head is lumpy and you did the Bosley.

92
00:05:42.261 --> 00:05:45.320
I don't have a good ball head.
So that's the thing is you're going fall,

93
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.650
you're praying,
you're like,
oh you went to Fox with that.

94
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.240
I'm going to Bosley do a lot of rock rockstar.
They've got it.

95
00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:54.490
Cause the only movie stars Rock Stars,

96
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.550
it's a 21st no,
it just kill me if can do it.
Do it.

97
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:01.280
The amount of bands where there'll be five people in the band and I'll be

98
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:04.430
watching it at home as a ball gag and there's no fucking way one of these guys

99
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:09.040
didn't go.
There's no way
less of all miles.

100
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.860
I have that disease.
You know.
It's where I'm losing my hair.

101
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:17.480
It's called middle aged and it's going to happen to everybody out there.

102
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.640
I just came into it

103
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.910
and I still look good for an old bag.
You know it's about your book.

104
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:27.220
Not only do you get dealt,

105
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.250
the unbelievable unconditional love that you have for your whole family is,

106
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:34.850
it really made me want to go get some Italian food cause it was so much of it

107
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:36.860
talking about it.
I'm actually going to make meatballs tonight.

108
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.920
When you were talking about when early on for people who haven't read the book

109
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:43.010
yet.
Um,
Steven spawn,
Deanna used to come by there,

110
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:45.740
their apartment used to bring them food and everything when they were struggling

111
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.170
and they have more buyers studios.
He was on brace for cause he's a great cook.

112
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.620
My mom's a fabulous cause you know,

113
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.780
makes up putting it in Tupperware and bring it down.
Grab our laundry,

114
00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.720
go just watching the table.
Cause that's kind of like a lot of noise.

115
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.730
I'm just letting you know all cause after everything just all hitting the table,

116
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.150
God can kick.
Not trying to put some restrictions on you.

117
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:10.850
I just want people to hear what he is a drummer bill.
He is a drummer.

118
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:15.080
I got ready to go with the arms of the chair are here.
What is your,
uh,

119
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.020
what's your go to dish?
Uh,

120
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.890
you want to impress people that come and buy eggplant permission and make a very

121
00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:24.500
good eggplant Parmigiana and make a very good lesson.
Yeah,

122
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.060
I make it very good sauce.
I'm a good cook.

123
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:33.060
I'm not bragging.
Right.
But when you're good,
you're good.
I,

124
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.170
it's a big part of the book though.
So that must've been,

125
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.510
so when you went over there,
you got early on,

126
00:07:38.511 --> 00:07:42.650
you got a sense that the band was going to,
was going to take off.
Oh No.

127
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:47.090
Nothing like that.
Or our studio,
our bathroom,
Damon work.
And it was,

128
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.910
she just didn't even go in CSI,
I don't know,

129
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.850
10 minutes talking about the studio,

130
00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:56.810
the studio behind Guitar Center that we are used to live at.
Well,

131
00:07:56.811 --> 00:07:59.550
we lived at girls' houses,
but that was her like a rehearsal.

132
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.130
And we always hang that and she,
you know,
would come buy from it as food.

133
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.800
I never understood how they did that.
Try and make it as a comedian,

134
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.500
you're just by yourself and as bad as it is,

135
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.500
you're sorta this little dictator and you can decide when you're going to eat

136
00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:14.330
and blah blah blah blah blah.
But if you're in a band,

137
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.210
you know there's always going to be the late guy,
the other guy doing this,

138
00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:21.920
like I don't know how you going.
I said I always love being part of a team.

139
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.140
Like when I was younger I played football.

140
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.130
I loved the way to when you get together and everybody creates something

141
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:31.370
together,
right.
Let me just see.
My Dad had the time.

142
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.730
We created such great magic and it just happened.

143
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.430
Have you read your mom's book?
No.
I'm afraid to read it cause I already know.

144
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.170
I already can imagine what the pain I put her through.
If I read it.

145
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.500
That's what you get in this book because I Read Your Book and you know I'm

146
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:51.110
rooting for you the whole way through.
Obviously a huge fan of everything.

147
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:55.170
But now to get the other side of a lot of those stories,
you know the worry that,

148
00:08:55.171 --> 00:08:57.750
uh,
I got to tell you,
dude,
I'm not gonna lie.
You put it through hell man,

149
00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.880
only really put it through health.
I mean,

150
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.860
I didn't wake up every morning real hell and don't forget that h e double hockey

151
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:08.730
staves,
l l I s denied.
You know,

152
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.590
I didn't wake up in the morning and go,
hey,
how can I,
you know,

153
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.800
my mother and her and my family and my friends.
No,
I had to,
it was,
I was,

154
00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:17.161
you know,

155
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:22.161
I'm an addict so I did what I did and think about it,

156
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:27.950
the constant,
I just became a dead two months ago.
So now I'm reading this from a,

157
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.610
from an extra couple of months.
Yeah.

158
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.240
So I'm reading it from a new perspective and I call,

159
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.070
I can be on both sides rather than being the messed up kid,

160
00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:39.610
which I already did that.
Now seeing.
So,
um,
if you want to tell people like,

161
00:09:39.611 --> 00:09:42.390
cause you touched on part of the book,
like those,
those feelings when you were,

162
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.201
you're sitting at home.

163
00:09:43.201 --> 00:09:45.660
I mean you're always going to remember him as a little baby and you know,

164
00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:48.640
he's out on the street and everything.
That must've,
you know,

165
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.370
ditching school.
Let me just,
let me get real quick.
Wow.

166
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.560
I track going,
hi.

167
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.110
I'm really starting to see this dynamic.

168
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.470
Yeah.
When he was growing up,
I didn't worry about it because I knew where he was.

169
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:12.120
He was back grandma's house.
But then I,
okay,
there's a mistake right there.

170
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.860
I knew he was at grandma's house,

171
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.310
but I didn't know what was going on when he was living at Grandma's house.

172
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.460
They wouldn't be going out on night and going to these clubs and uh,

173
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.620
but I didn't worry about it cause I thought,
okay,
he's safe.

174
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:28.080
He's at Grandma's house.
And what happened when you found out that,

175
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.550
that he wasn't there?
Well,

176
00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:34.460
I didn't find out until years later how old I was.

177
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.090
I did school everyday.
You know,
they never did the school never even called her.

178
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:39.991
Yeah.

179
00:10:39.991 --> 00:10:44.991
This was like the 70 [inaudible] going to a liquor store at 15 and you're kind

180
00:10:45.531 --> 00:10:49.950
of a pack of cigarettes and I'm buying a six pack of beer and drink old enough.

181
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.970
Yeah.
Drinking Age was 18 right?
It was 21.
Oh,
what's 21?

182
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.900
I mean Sasha will just walk in somewhere and just give me some cigarettes were

183
00:10:57.901 --> 00:11:02.460
taking his beer and it was not a seventies were gray man.

184
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.650
Ray Lewis,
Allen,

185
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.800
I'm telling you I want to tell a story.
Okay.
Okay,
I got you.

186
00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:15.030
You're still going to keep the tension down guys.
Um,
so what um,

187
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.340
do you have any like uh,
do you have any like,

188
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.420
cause I haven't got that far into the book.
Do you,

189
00:11:19.421 --> 00:11:22.830
do you end up giving advice because I think this will be an incredible book for

190
00:11:22.831 --> 00:11:25.470
parents that there were dealing with the situation that you were dealing with.

191
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:29.040
I could never give advice to anyone.
I'm not a doctor.

192
00:11:29.041 --> 00:11:31.950
I'm not a professional person and not a psychiatrist or anything like that.

193
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.780
I'm just even apolis mother and I told about what it,
how it affected me,

194
00:11:36.781 --> 00:11:41.610
the things that he did.
But if I wanted to tell people what to do,

195
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.890
if I want to do that,

196
00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:48.210
I would say if you have a son or daughter that's an alcoholic or drug addict,

197
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:54.240
take care of yourself.
And that took me a long to learn.
I mean,

198
00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:59.310
<v 2>years to learn this was stop worrying about him.
That's his life.</v>

199
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.810
You didn't teach him to drink or take drugs,
you didn't do that to him,
right?

200
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:10.320
Oh No,
I didn't do that to him.
Was around their kids.
I don't,

201
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.530
I don't know anything about that.
You know about drugs or alcohol.
I didn't,

202
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.200
I didn't know what was going on and um,

203
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.980
but I would tell people to go to Al Anon meetings,

204
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.000
go to Aa meetings to take care of yourself.

205
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:25.363
<v 1>Don't worry.</v>

206
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.190
Try to understand what you're dealing with and exactly right.

207
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.970
So you know what your friend or your,
you know,

208
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:37.990
your associated or whoever your son or daughter is going through what they're

209
00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:42.610
thinking and you go to the Allen on me,
then you realize you're not the only one.

210
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.810
And he just feels so much better in our meetings.
Was that,

211
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.350
that was your experience?
Well,
what happened?

212
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:52.660
<v 2>But it was my daughter in law,
Carolina,
Steven's wife,
she would tell me,</v>

213
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.410
go to an Al Anon meeting,
go to an Al Anon meeting.
And I say,
no,

214
00:12:56.411 --> 00:12:59.680
I don't want to go there because I don't want to hear anybody else's problems.

215
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.480
Okay.
But finally I went to my first Al Anon meeting,

216
00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:08.830
which was a few years ago.
And I walked in there and I w I thought to myself,

217
00:13:08.831 --> 00:13:11.350
do they know who I am?
I'm so ashamed.
You know,

218
00:13:11.351 --> 00:13:15.940
my son's a drug addict as an alcoholic.
Do they know who I am?
Well,
you know,

219
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:18.520
when you go to these meetings,
when you introduce yourself,

220
00:13:18.521 --> 00:13:23.410
you only say the first name so they don't really know who you are.
And,
um,

221
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.610
and I listened to what everybody is saying and you want to know,
say,

222
00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:32.110
I walked out of there and I said to myself,
oh my God,
I don't have it so bad.

223
00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.080
There was such stories to be told.

224
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.740
People have it so much worse than me.
I couldn't believe it.

225
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:44.020
And I felt good about myself.
Did that make you go two more or three more?

226
00:13:44.021 --> 00:13:45.670
Yes,
yes.
I go to more.
Yes.

227
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:50.910
I've gone to Aa meetings to listen to what these drug addicts have gone through

228
00:13:51.161 --> 00:13:54.460
their stories.
It doesn't hurt me to do this.

229
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.510
<v 1>And then when I go to the knowledge is important.
I uh,</v>

230
00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.510
I got arrested for drinking and driving and like the uh,
the late eighties,

231
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.480
and one of the things that you had to go to like a couple of AA meetings and I

232
00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:06.910
was concerned like,
Oh God,
what is this going to be like?

233
00:14:06.911 --> 00:14:09.820
And I went there and that actually did make me feel better.
I was like,
all right,

234
00:14:09.821 --> 00:14:12.940
I drank.
I don't not do want these people that do.
Yeah.

235
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.410
I always feel better going there.

236
00:14:14.411 --> 00:14:17.770
I was forced to go when I got arrested and I celebrity rehab.

237
00:14:17.771 --> 00:14:22.570
So I love that I got arrested on a show about doing drugs because I had drugs on

238
00:14:22.571 --> 00:14:27.040
me.
I hours my highlight of my blog,
I was a highlight.
Okay.

239
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.520
But so I was Kinda,
I was,

240
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:33.540
I had to go for three months every day I had to get this paper signed and I'm so

241
00:14:34.871 --> 00:14:35.704
glad I did.

242
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:40.480
I had to go and then like after the first couple of days I enjoyed it.
I go,

243
00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:43.930
it was one hour a day.
Did you look great?
And thank you.
You look great.

244
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.720
I got to over three years.
Yeah,

oh you look,

245
00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.690

246
00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.300
He'll be going to the gym every morning.
We have now we have a life.

247
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.830
This is a weird day.
Know that,
I mean me,

248
00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.590
comedians have joked about this something,

249
00:14:57.591 --> 00:15:00.950
if you do hard drugs in your 20s you have like abs for life.

250
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.640
You guys are all in like crazy shape.
Nobody else.
Every,
I gained

251
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.530
40 pounds when I was drinking as the last three years before I got sober three

252
00:15:12.531 --> 00:15:17.510
years ago,
uh,
I was drinking egg or my sir.
And you want to know something,

253
00:15:17.511 --> 00:15:21.100
you could drink it.
What age did it,
I said,
well,
I wasn't drinking.
You know,

254
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:24.440
when I was younger I had a few beers.
You go to the rainbow and you know,

255
00:15:24.441 --> 00:15:28.580
get the long island ice teas that go in and use the buyers.
And,

256
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.890
but it wasn't like I went to the liquor store every day,

257
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.380
but before I got sober three years ago,

258
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:38.030
every morning I've drank from six o'clock when the liquor store open,

259
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:43.040
I would be there sometimes before the owner got dare open up.
Oh Hey.

260
00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:45.760
It seem it.
How's it going?
How do you think it's going?

261
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.880
I'm at the liquor store fucking before you.
I listen.
Goshawks going,

262
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:54.100
wait a minute.
I want to say something
nice on tries.

263
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:58.610
He was so skinny.
Like,
oh,
like a weed.
So turning to heroin and crack.

264
00:15:58.611 --> 00:16:00.240
We'll do that too.
Oh yeah.

265
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:05.270
So live on God Taco bar or a Jack in the box tacos and Ding dongs and Hagar my

266
00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:12.130
sir.
That's,
that's the life of a,
of a store guy to me.
You know,

267
00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.680
I've listened to you and this new 52 years,

268
00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.890
I'm so tired of this.
They'll list the silence.
Okay.

269
00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:23.910
Silence is golden liquid
queen.

270
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:28.710
Why let the Queen Speech?
I hear the love.
I still hear the,

271
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.310
I just want to finish this out.
Okay.
Okay.
When he,
when he was drinking alcohol,

272
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:39.050
he was heavy and I would tell everybody,
oh,
Steven never looked so good.

273
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:44.240
He's got some fat on him now.
He's not so skinny.
He's shit to look at them.

274
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.580
I didn't know that.
That's what alcohol does.

275
00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:51.200
An alcoholic because of all the sugar.
It's an alcohol and it was a sweetheart.

276
00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.390
You're making meals for people.
You're encouraging and all that.
I get the,

277
00:16:54.391 --> 00:16:58.760
you know,
so you're not looking for unusual and wonderful by that.
I just,

278
00:16:58.761 --> 00:17:01.640
you know,
made you food kitchen with the brush.

279
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.880
Sorry.
Get it straight and woods.
My grandmother probably wouldn't spoon over.

280
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:10.390
She tried to hit me in the head with it and they got the arm up the block and

281
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.220
you've been,
he broke,
he broke it on your grant and then she immediately,

282
00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:14.980
she snapped out.
She had this crazy liquid.

283
00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.510
She went to hit me in the second it's snapped.
She just went,

284
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.740
she just went back to normal calls.

285
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.610
He had to do was just get a solid hit anywhere on you.
She felt better.

286
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:24.870
I really tell them Max,

287
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:29.870
my kid story about Jamie,
I used to,
I used to,

288
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.080
I used to hit him with the winds,
but just on the thigh,
nothing terrible.

289
00:17:33.081 --> 00:17:35.810
Nothing terrible.
Acceptable.

290
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.420
So one night he talked back to me.
So either I,

291
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:46.240
I used to wash out their mouth,
but so now we teach you really do it,

292
00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:50.440
make them stick the bar in there to wash face time.

293
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:53.930
I couldn't,
you know,
I was too little to do anything about it.

294
00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.540
She's got to take a water break here.
Hang on a second.
Little soda pop

295
00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.560
with Jamie,
my youngest son,
he sassed me back.
So I,

296
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:07.520
I didn't have the cell bike,
I didn't get the soap,
so I had the wooden spoon.

297
00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:11.810
So I started chasing him around the dining room table.
I said,

298
00:18:11.811 --> 00:18:14.650
I'm going to get you,
you're not going to talk like that to me.
I won't have it.

299
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.140
10 years old at the time.
Yeah.
So you're agile,
you're low to the ground,

300
00:18:18.141 --> 00:18:21.290
you've got a low center of gravity.
So I got so mad at him.

301
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:26.000
I threw the wooden spoon at Jamie.
He grabbed the wooden spoon and start chasing

302
00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.900
is never going to happen again.
When we

303
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.950
have now,
wait a minute,

304
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:40.090
he can't have that running after me with the wooden spoon and we've started to

305
00:18:40.341 --> 00:18:43.800
laugh and laugh and that was the end of the window was it?
I took them,

306
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:47.800
put under my bed and it was done.
When I did my,

307
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.640
my dad was in a fraternity and he kept a paddle as a souvenir.

308
00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:54.050
My mother used to hit us with it,
so I took it and I hit it.

309
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:58.550
I hit it in between their mattress because I figured they would never look
there.

310
00:18:58.551 --> 00:19:03.190
They would rip it apart out rooms.
Trying to find a hat writes,
you know,
Jesus.

311
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.410
Even as a kid,
I was out of necessity.
Those was,

312
00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:10.070
my mother didn't have the greatest aim.
We're streetwise.
No,

313
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:11.590
I was Culdesac wise.

314
00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:16.900
I wouldn't hit him on the thigh or the tuition.
That's all.
Nothing.

315
00:19:16.901 --> 00:19:20.350
My Mother didn't have good hand eye coordination or she gets so mad she'd miss

316
00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:25.270
and she'd hit your lower back or the bottom
by accident.
I'm not trying to indict.

317
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.490
I think the statute of limitations ran out at this point.
Yeah,
he's worn out,

318
00:19:28.491 --> 00:19:31.780
but at times is so different.
You know?
Tell me here,
parent gives,

319
00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.940
their kid is back on her toes or something and it was like,
oh,

320
00:19:34.941 --> 00:19:39.941
you're going to jail and volunteer because this kid for 24 hours a day like I

321
00:19:41.151 --> 00:19:44.150
do,
you would smack him.
It's what it is.
But there wasn't,

322
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.110
there wasn't all these video cameras.
You know,
I just realized,

323
00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:47.560
I didn't even say where you can get your book yet.

324
00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.320
Your book is available@amazon.com once a time.
Once upon it.

325
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.230
Once again,
I can't thank

326
00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:03.450
fileable not book smart.
Hey,

327
00:20:03.451 --> 00:20:04.110
can I out?

328
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:09.110
I'm all mixed up and amazon.com it's a noble Adler's book,

329
00:20:10.561 --> 00:20:15.210
sweet child of mine.
It's available@amazon.com there we go.
I mean,

330
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.510
go ahead.
Oh,
you're talking about

331
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:22.780
you're inviting bill book signing March 29th at Barnes and noble.

332
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.470
I'll be over in the grove.
I think

333
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:32.070
I'll definitely swing by.
Jamie will be there.
My brother,

334
00:20:32.071 --> 00:20:36.280
I'll do a lot of celebrities.
My brothers having all his friends come out.

335
00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:40.420
I had three friends in my life.
I have three.
Broke it down to three.

336
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:44.410
That's all you need.
It's all is.
Yeah.
I got two pairs of Pants,
seven shirts,

337
00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.810
12 pairs of socks at 12 years old.
I knew.
Or did you get the,
uh,
the world travel,

338
00:20:48.811 --> 00:20:52.490
like luggage packing thing down?
We're like,
oh yeah,
this is Barry.

339
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.660
It you just made like the size of a breadbox.
What would you,
when you're,

340
00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.320
you're going to do a world tour.
You were leaving your apartment for a year.

341
00:20:58.321 --> 00:21:01.680
What are you bringing two pairs of pants by?
Pj's a pair of sweats,

342
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:07.600
a tee shirts.
I knew her sobs,
I let me tell him know.
Sure.
So what I said,

343
00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.980
<v 2>I want to tell you a story about him going on tour.</v>

344
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:14.120
Come up closer to the mic a little bit.
One day he calls me up and he's deaf.

345
00:21:14.121 --> 00:21:18.800
This,
uh,
um,
Kotel and he said,
Ma,
you come on by here.

346
00:21:18.801 --> 00:21:21.770
I got some clothes.
I've got some things I want you to take home with you.

347
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:26.930
We're going to play down in 10 in England.
And I said,

348
00:21:26.931 --> 00:21:28.760
okay.
So,
um,

349
00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:34.030
I go to the hotel and he comes out of the hotel and he's wearing pants that are

350
00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:40.640
slipped.
You know how that in the 80s,
they had the holey jeans they were feeling.

351
00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:45.860
And also not only that,
there were splits by his Tush.
Okay.
By the tuition.

352
00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:50.560
<v 1>He's a rock star.
We didn't worry.
I knew her back then.
Any right
now,</v>

353
00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.980
no idea.
Wait a minute.
I say to them,
this,

354
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:57.420
<v 2>stop,
tell this story.
No.</v>

355
00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:02.580
And so now he's coming on and I see he's wearing these torn pants.
I said,

356
00:22:02.581 --> 00:22:06.690
Steven,
I says,
you can't go on the Concorde like that.

357
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.400
I says,
you have to dress properly.
He says,
don't worry my,
it's okay.

358
00:22:11.401 --> 00:22:15.060
It's all right.
So a few minutes later,
we're talking in a few minutes later,

359
00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:16.590
a great,
I'll never forget it.

360
00:22:16.591 --> 00:22:21.591
A great big gray stretch limousine pulls up to the front of the hotel and he

361
00:22:22.411 --> 00:22:25.140
says,
oh,
that's my ride.
I says,
okay.

362
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:30.470
So he walks down to the car and the guy opens the door for him to get into

363
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:36.870
limousine and he turns around and looks at me,
says,
see my,

364
00:22:36.871 --> 00:22:38.310
it's okay.
What I'm wearing,

365
00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:44.050
<v 1>what I wearing know what does that like as a mother to have</v>

366
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.890
<v 2>achieve like that I very proud of Steven.</v>

367
00:22:47.891 --> 00:22:52.891
He's accomplished so much in his life and I'm sure we've gone through a lot of

368
00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:56.740
bad times,
but that's over with now and I'm very happy,

369
00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:01.260
<v 1>you know,
we're,
we're waiting.
We walk out his studio.
You're so done.
Wait,</v>

370
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.900
I'm going to age you.
10 years went to walk out of here.

371
00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.950
If I wanted to hear any of your shit.
I squeeze your head thing.
Oh,
here we go.

372
00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.520
Here we go.
Well during that time,
what was,
what's your,
uh,

373
00:23:12.521 --> 00:23:17.260
what's your favorite city to play?
The Amsterdam.
Amsterdam for the obvious

374
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.390
shit.
Damn.
That's what I'm looking for.
A new house,

375
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:28.870
you know,
everywhere.
But I had to say Argentina.

376
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:31.180
South America is the greatest place.
You know what's amazing?

377
00:23:31.181 --> 00:23:33.960
ACDC is best live video I think is,

378
00:23:33.961 --> 00:23:37.840
it's from somewhere in South America and the level crazy that the fans are gun

379
00:23:37.841 --> 00:23:41.110
was embarrassing to me as a concert goer and like as a go concert go.

380
00:23:41.111 --> 00:23:43.180
I thought like I thought I was bringing it for the band.

381
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:46.360
Like the whole place was going nuts place.

382
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.790
Even if people in the stands there are so passionate,

383
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:53.990
ever seen iron main concert when they went down there.
Oh Shit.

384
00:23:53.991 --> 00:23:58.390
Watching iron man calms it down there and it's insanity.
It's just a whole,

385
00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:02.390
you know,
River Plate stadium as a giant mosh pit.

386
00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.210
What was that feeling the first time you played and you're sitting back there?

387
00:24:05.211 --> 00:24:07.760
Cause that's the drummer,
you know,
you get to kind of sit down and take it in.

388
00:24:07.761 --> 00:24:12.230
So you've got all you see is the greatest thing in my life is everything I ever

389
00:24:12.231 --> 00:24:14.660
dreamed of and more.
How did you play that night?

390
00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:19.460
Our grain just took it to the next level.
I salt.
Oh yeah,
no it's,
you know,

391
00:24:19.461 --> 00:24:22.820
he started small and then work your way up because that's the dream is not as a

392
00:24:22.821 --> 00:24:26.090
play for five or 10 people.
Oh,
if the plate for you know,

393
00:24:26.091 --> 00:24:30.470
five or 1,000 thousand people,
what blew me away about your plane was,
you know,

394
00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:34.550
I was a frustrated drummer before I became a comedian.
And back in the 80s,

395
00:24:34.551 --> 00:24:37.340
I'm sure you remembered,
like everybody had these giant kits.

396
00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.280
Even if they were just playing like a two four thing and then you came out,

397
00:24:40.281 --> 00:24:43.790
you would just had a little four piece kit three.
It was actually pretty.
Anyway,

398
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.400
when we started,

399
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.340
it was just a base there and floor Tom ride crash and the Hyatt and the
Colville.

400
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.090
How did you like the look was even if you didn't play double bass,

401
00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:55.460
a lot of people have that.
The second kick set up without even a pedal.

402
00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.080
I had that look.
I had that look.
And then um,

403
00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:03.020
I was playing with this other band and during the afternoon and I got a call

404
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:06.830
from slash saying that,
um,
we're going to do a doll.

405
00:25:06.831 --> 00:25:10.040
Fucked up his show at the troubadour on Thursday.

406
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:14.660
And then he hooked up with a show I'll show in Seattle and in Oregon.

407
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.980
So I've said,
he said,
you want to go?
And I said,
well,

408
00:25:16.981 --> 00:25:21.890
of course I want to go my bags packed my whole life,
which is approximately 2018,

409
00:25:21.891 --> 00:25:26.110
19 years.
Okay.
Okay.
So,
um,
I think we got to get back to your mind.

410
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:30.580
When I brought,
I was playing with his other band and I,

411
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.830
if was my mom's house Donthe analysis,
say,
Oh

412
00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:41.330
hell.
But anyway,
I broke my bass storm has,
so when I went to Paris and I said,

413
00:25:41.331 --> 00:25:45.230
I'm not going to set the whole thing up.
I'm just going to use the three pieces.

414
00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.800
And it just worked out well,
I'll tell you,
you got,
you got more out of that.
Yeah,

415
00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:52.350
guys got out of a tent down.
It's all I need.
That's the front of the Trump part.

416
00:25:52.351 --> 00:25:57.320
Sorry mom.
Sorry.
Tell him about the first time I saw you play.

417
00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:00.230
I'd love to hear that.
The first time that sounds playing,

418
00:26:00.231 --> 00:26:03.860
I think it was at the Troubadour,
wasn't the trooper that had the troubadour.

419
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:06.760
The other ones,
it doesn't matter why.
I can't even

420
00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:13.590
let me
talk for two minutes.

421
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:18.560
So sorry.
Out of his mind,
I'm getting the wooden spoon.

422
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:22.140
This is making me feel homesick.
This is exactly like calm.

423
00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.360
They get back into the kitchen where you belonged with nice guys.
Jesus.

424
00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:31.220
Jesus.
Anyway,
it's the first time I saw him play.

425
00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:36.500
You were in that you are in the expressway to heaven,
one of the express lane.

426
00:26:36.501 --> 00:26:38.150
They have been watching you dealing with this shit.

427
00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:42.500
You still have an older one that ever even seen yet.
Sorry,
I interrupted.

428
00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.163
Go ahead.

429
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:47.590
<v 2>I'll let me,
sorry.
Anyways,
I saw,</v>

430
00:26:47.591 --> 00:26:50.950
I went to see him play and Jamie was with us and Jamie was I think about nine

431
00:26:50.951 --> 00:26:55.690
years old and we got a call from Steven and Steven says,
coming to watch us play,

432
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:58.360
I since it's a school night,
we can't come.
He says,

433
00:26:58.361 --> 00:27:01.870
come after dinner just for a little while.
So I said,
okay.

434
00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:06.150
So we drove one to how we were living in the valley at the time and uh,

435
00:27:06.151 --> 00:27:11.050
we drove into Hollywood and we parked the car down the street.

436
00:27:11.051 --> 00:27:15.220
I remember this.
And all these boys and girls,

437
00:27:15.221 --> 00:27:16.840
young young adults,

438
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:21.800
they had on black leather pants and the sheer blouses and,

439
00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:24.960
and their hair was up to the ceiling and,

440
00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:29.620
and makeup like you wouldn't believe.
And those were the guys

441
00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:33.600
or the horn

442
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:37.600
worms.

443
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:42.040
So we went up to the front of the venue in and there was a security guy there

444
00:27:42.041 --> 00:27:46.330
and he said,
I said to him,
my system,
can you please tell Steven Adler,

445
00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.360
his mom and dad are here,
brother.
He says,
of course.

446
00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.580
So Steven tells us to come into the,

447
00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:54.610
Steven comes out and he tells us to come into the venue and he said,
no,

448
00:27:54.611 --> 00:27:59.410
I want you to stay on the side of the,
on the side of the venue.
I said,
he said,

449
00:27:59.411 --> 00:28:03.730
don't go in the middle.
It says,
go to the site where you're safe.

450
00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:07.660
And I think to myself,
what?
He's to be safe,
what's going to go on here?

451
00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.480
So a few minutes later the lights go out,

452
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:15.630
it's pitch black in the venue and all of us sudden Steven starts to play and

453
00:28:18.611 --> 00:28:21.970
it's like a seven 47 landing on my head.

454
00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:26.140
That's how loud it was.
That's how loud it was.
Crazy.

455
00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.820
So right away of course I got death,
you know,
I didn't hear nothing anymore.

456
00:28:30.821 --> 00:28:33.610
That was the end of me.
I was deaf for about three or four hours.

457
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:39.700
You're deaf.
I said,
did I say deaf?
I said deaf.
And

458
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:44.200
about three or four hours I was deaf on the way home.

459
00:28:44.201 --> 00:28:48.310
I couldn't hear anybody talk and it,
I said to myself,
oh my God,

460
00:28:48.311 --> 00:28:51.040
I can't do this again.
It was too much for me.

461
00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:55.810
So right away the next time I bought earplugs,
putting in my ears,

462
00:28:55.811 --> 00:28:57.580
I didn't realize what was going to happen.

463
00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:01.090
I didn't understand it because I had never done anything like this before.

464
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:05.350
Anyways,
we were very proud of him.
And um,

465
00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:08.230
so the second time you've probably got to boys playing a little more cause you

466
00:29:08.231 --> 00:29:11.770
weren't dealing with FAU for sonic.
Oh yeah,
it was.
She,
it was very,

467
00:29:11.771 --> 00:29:13.300
very loud when they start to play.

468
00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.510
<v 1>My favorite,
sorry,
when they came to the shows,
they brought my grandmother.</v>

469
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.870
Oh yeah,
35 year old grandma that wow.

470
00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:26.020
I got to add a little Jewish leave about four three and then I said at the bar

471
00:29:29.011 --> 00:29:32.510
here at the Troubadour,
I mean,
I was more safe though and you know,

472
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:36.840
and my mom and my grandmother standing there and actually no,

473
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:41.830
she looks down at my grandma's gone.
I'm playing.
I said,
and I'm looking around.

474
00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:44.990
I looked down in the front row,
there is my grandmother,

475
00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:49.910
she's standing right in front of his day.
That's my CV.

476
00:29:49.911 --> 00:29:54.530
I love you.
Stevie and action was wearing a pair of chaps,
you know the d string,

477
00:29:55.810 --> 00:30:00.050
red or gray hair,
the last grade that and my grandmother's right there.

478
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:03.300
Two feet away.
I'm going to get,
I live there,
get out,

479
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.370
I'm playing or go over there.
But my mother never saw,

480
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:11.870
looked at athletes.
She was just,
of course,
I'm the only one in that.

481
00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:16.820
She had how many?
How many kids and grandkids?
30.
No,
she had 14 grandchildren.

482
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:20.970
Yeah.
But cares about
any of them.

483
00:30:20.971 --> 00:30:25.730
But me has this,
uh,
last,
is this your longest stretch being sober?
Three years.

484
00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:28.210
That's a month before I was 11.
Yeah.

485
00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:31.610
First 11 years of your life you killed are killed it man.

486
00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:35.240
Don't you wish those years counted?
Yeah.
You know what,
you don't go like,

487
00:30:35.241 --> 00:30:36.930
what's the longest you've been sober?
Like I,

488
00:30:36.931 --> 00:30:39.710
for me it was probably the first 15 years.
I just 15 years.

489
00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:45.790
I had a good 11 years.
That's amazing.
This must be,
is this an easier time then?

490
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.340
Uh Oh Deanna for you now that now that he's,
you know,
look at them.

491
00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.840
I can finally Christmases.
Look at him.

492
00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.950
<v 2>I could finally sleep at night because for 30 years,</v>

493
00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.700
every night when I went to sleep it was,
oh my God,

494
00:30:58.701 --> 00:31:00.650
is this a corner going to call?

495
00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:05.270
Is the hospital going to call the police?
I mean,

496
00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.830
one mother could sleep when there's,
when the sun is out.
Right.

497
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:09.560
<v 1>It was funny.
That's why I didn't do any of those chair.</v>

498
00:31:09.561 --> 00:31:13.540
I didn't do any Charlie sheen jokes because I just kept thinking when Charlie

499
00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.970
Sheen was going off the rails and everyone's like laughing about the tiger blood

500
00:31:15.971 --> 00:31:18.180
and all that stuff I just kept thinking about is,
you know,

501
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:22.650
cause you Emilio Estevez I grew up watching his movies and I love this almost

502
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.730
his dad.
So I was just thinking like this,

503
00:31:24.731 --> 00:31:27.070
sitting by a phone waiting to get that phone call that he's dead.

504
00:31:27.071 --> 00:31:30.670
So everybody's just sitting there watching that train wreck of a,
you know,

505
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.440
tore that.
He did.
I never saw the humor in it.
Well,
you know,
I also know,

506
00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.820
I ain't said that didn't make it either.
So,

507
00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:38.001
<v 2>and the,
you know what,</v>

508
00:31:38.001 --> 00:31:42.470
there's a lot of parents out there who have lost their sons and daughters to

509
00:31:42.471 --> 00:31:46.670
drugs and uh,
and they're just regular people,

510
00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.460
but their hearts are broken now.
Yeah.
I,

511
00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:55.690
I remember one story and I think I told this story before about this real estate

512
00:31:56.211 --> 00:31:56.600
lady.

513
00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:01.600
I was selling my condo in Las Vegas and a real estate lady came to my house and

514
00:32:03.171 --> 00:32:03.890
uh,

515
00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:07.340
she looks at and she comes in the house and she sees all these gold and platinum

516
00:32:07.341 --> 00:32:12.110
records on the wall.
And then she says,
whose records are these?

517
00:32:12.111 --> 00:32:15.260
Who's awards are these?
I said,
well,
they belonged to my son,
Steven Adler.

518
00:32:15.261 --> 00:32:19.340
He's the original drummer from guns and roses.
And she said,
Oh my God,

519
00:32:19.341 --> 00:32:23.120
your misses Adler.
And I says,
yes.
And she says,

520
00:32:23.121 --> 00:32:26.480
can I come after I finished my client,
can I come back and talk with you?

521
00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:27.800
I suppose,
of course.

522
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.940
So she comes back a little while later and we sit down in the living room and

523
00:32:31.941 --> 00:32:36.110
she says,
I'm going to say something I haven't said in five years.
I says,
well,

524
00:32:36.111 --> 00:32:37.580
what is it?
She says,

525
00:32:37.581 --> 00:32:41.580
my daughter died of a drug overdose.

526
00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:43.950
And I've never said that before.

527
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.880
I tell everyone that my daughter died in a car accident because she couldn't

528
00:32:52.021 --> 00:32:53.070
bring herself

529
00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:58.780
to say it because they plant themselves as like a shame.
Right,
right.

530
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:03.760
It's a shame and there's no need to be ashamed.
But it was a shame.
So I says,

531
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.650
she says,
I've never told anyone this until you,

532
00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:12.240
she never said for five years or to,
she didn't tell her family or friends.

533
00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:16.320
She just tells me,
Oh my daughter died in a car accident,
but it wasn't true.

534
00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:21.150
So she was able to tell me because she knew that I would understand what she's

535
00:33:21.151 --> 00:33:21.990
talking about

536
00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:27.330
<v 1>on porn to be able to tell somebody these things that you're holding inside.</v>

537
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:32.600
Cause resentment is one on main worst things for an addict,

538
00:33:33.751 --> 00:33:37.450
especially his wisdom and but refer anybody.
You have resentment.

539
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:41.520
You can't move forward with your life when it was it being able to talk about it

540
00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.060
and get it out of your system.
That's the first thing that it's like,

541
00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:48.180
I mean this is happening to many people.

542
00:33:48.181 --> 00:33:51.750
I talked about in my book about when I was,
I was living at my grandma's house.

543
00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:52.180
You know,

544
00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:56.910
I was 12 1314 years old and I used to hang out at the Starwood.

545
00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:01.350
Yup.
You know,
I lived up relived off here of facts in Santa Monica.
You know,

546
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.290
Hayworth in Santa Monica,
so you know,
it's west Hollywood.
So you know,
I,

547
00:34:05.291 --> 00:34:07.590
there's always guys trying to pick you rob.

548
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:12.470
It was the 70s and I used to hang out at the rainbow and that,
and uh,

549
00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:17.470
it's uh,
the star wood and stuff like that and one,
I get this,

550
00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:18.840
all their teenager,

551
00:34:18.841 --> 00:34:23.841
I was saying with drug me and I ended up getting a sexually abused by these,

552
00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:31.610
by these two guys and I was like 13 years old and I couldn't talk about that for

553
00:34:32.401 --> 00:34:33.000
each forever.

554
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.630
But if something that was deep insights Berkeley that wasn't accepted for

555
00:34:36.631 --> 00:34:40.260
anybody for the longest time,
forget about it.
As a guy.
Yeah.
Some of the,

556
00:34:40.261 --> 00:34:43.430
they almost like I was 13 I don't think you can.
Yeah.

557
00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:47.080
Keeping any shifts with that,
but you know,
the dad dies.
But I,
I,

558
00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:52.160
once I talked about that in my book and I mentioned you doing when you wouldn't

559
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:57.560
believe how many people have come up to me and says you talking about that made

560
00:34:58.681 --> 00:35:02.370
me be able to talk about it.
I'm not telling them,
one,
two,
three,

561
00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:04.650
I traveled around the world.
Okay.
You guys,

562
00:35:04.651 --> 00:35:07.590
you guys are pulled looking at both to them.
Great.
Do you guys have to hit,

563
00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.350
we're survivors.
Do you guys think you're going to have a,
you know,

564
00:35:10.351 --> 00:35:11.850
now that you're sober and everything you could,

565
00:35:11.851 --> 00:35:14.040
maybe you guys will have a third book and you,
you know,

566
00:35:14.041 --> 00:35:15.570
well you don't have to hit him with the spoon.

567
00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:19.160
He still going to be hitting me with the stones in a bed.

568
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.430
I'm going to be hitting her and with US foreign,
it's not heard.
Me and Meagan,

569
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:24.780
I don't have anything left in me after this

570
00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.130
reads that way though.
I mean you're really put it out there.
So I got it.

571
00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.010
<v 2>I told the truth about everything.
See,</v>

572
00:35:33.011 --> 00:35:38.011
I've been writing this book says since 1984 every time I was see him perform or

573
00:35:39.641 --> 00:35:41.920
we went through this,
literally writing it,
yes,

574
00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.470
I would write down notes on a piece of papers saying,

575
00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.260
well this is what happened today.
And,
and um,

576
00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:48.480
<v 1>she's good though.</v>

577
00:35:48.481 --> 00:35:52.630
She's just one of those people who've rights has very nice handwriting and

578
00:35:52.631 --> 00:35:53.900
enjoys writing.
I'm like,

579
00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:59.350
I can't even read my signature is like,
what does it say?
Suit.

580
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.770
And I was in the game

581
00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.610
<v 2>so I never thought about writing a book.
But then a few years ago,</v>

582
00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:13.040
um,
Jamie said to me,
Ma,
you have all these pieces of paper,

583
00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:17.270
all these stories,
why don't you put it together for a book?
And I said,

584
00:36:17.271 --> 00:36:22.160
I never thought about that.
And so he got Larry Spagnola who is my co writer,

585
00:36:22.161 --> 00:36:27.070
he put it all together for me.
It helps Steven.
He was helping Stephen,

586
00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:31.520
he's,
he helps even with his book.
And so we call Larry and Larry says,

587
00:36:31.521 --> 00:36:35.540
of course I'll help you.
You know.
So he helped me a lot and

588
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:39.860
<v 1>I can't say enough.
My fans,
they know I don't read.</v>

589
00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.740
And if I get up my hands on a book and I can't put it down,

590
00:36:42.741 --> 00:36:46.280
that's basically the way it is.
Um,
with this one.
So,
uh,
Jamie,

591
00:36:46.281 --> 00:36:47.240
when are you going to write a book?
Man?

592
00:36:47.241 --> 00:36:48.740
You're like the only guy left in the family,
right?

593
00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:52.330
I'm working on my own book right now.
Don't peak at 25.
Okay,

594
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.800
Bill.
It's crazy.

595
00:36:57.801 --> 00:37:01.040
Cause I've had at least like four or five phone calls from people calling me up

596
00:37:01.041 --> 00:37:01.311
saying,

597
00:37:01.311 --> 00:37:05.570
I had no idea your family was fucked up and mine is even worse than yours.

598
00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:09.320
And he got sick.
It's unreal.
Like people are really calling me up saying,

599
00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.090
I have a secret to tell you.

600
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:15.050
And like people are like really starting to divulge your secrets and every

601
00:37:15.051 --> 00:37:17.750
family has one.
And my mom's book,

602
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:22.160
I really want this book to be a big success,
not because of,

603
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:23.960
well yeah sure I want to make some money,

604
00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:26.720
but I want to be able to help the rest of the world.

605
00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.110
I want the rest of the world to not have to hold on these secrets anymore

606
00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.230
because like my brother just shared a crazy secret,
oh yeah,

607
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:38.840
eight years.
But he wrote his book in his book.

608
00:37:38.841 --> 00:37:42.440
The guy admitted that he was such a blind read his book.
I remember that.

609
00:37:42.441 --> 00:37:46.160
I was like,
so as soon as he said that it's within the next couple of years,

610
00:37:46.161 --> 00:37:47.960
he kind of stopped doing heroin and crack.

611
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:52.130
Well because that secret that he was holding inside,
he was able to have that go.

612
00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.530
And that's what they talked about.
When you carry mud,

613
00:37:54.531 --> 00:37:57.170
you carry dirt like you're carrying a big load.

614
00:37:57.171 --> 00:38:01.010
So all of a sudden my mom puts out this book that I've been getting some phone

615
00:38:01.011 --> 00:38:04.520
calls from,
some pretty prestigious people that I looked up to,
and they're,

616
00:38:04.521 --> 00:38:08.020
they're admitting that they have drug addicts and disease and their pride and

617
00:38:08.021 --> 00:38:09.710
their family as well.
Now,

618
00:38:09.711 --> 00:38:12.590
you know what I found with my comedy that there's a lot of angry people out

619
00:38:12.591 --> 00:38:15.440
there.
However that is,
I've been working through my anger.

620
00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:18.440
I have a portion of my fans going like,
dude,
you're not as angry.

621
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:21.680
Like they're getting mad at me cause I'm along.
You ain't a little happier.

622
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:25.110
We want you angry,
man.
I still love you.
Ain't stay angry,
dude.

623
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:32.120
What was it worth it not,
uh,
misery loves company x.

624
00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.990
They want you angry.
Great disguise.
It is don't your edge.

625
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.570
It's like,
no.
What is my edge yelling at other people's mothers at a red light.

626
00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.600
You know what I mean?
That's somebody's grandmother.
What am I doing?
I,

627
00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:46.080
there's some point speaking for millions of people,

628
00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:49.100
I have to bring it down a little bit,
you know what I mean?
So whatever,

629
00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:53.470
there's always a couple people going to give you a rough time.
So,
um,
all right,

630
00:38:53.471 --> 00:38:57.820
so we,
we got a little more time left.
Is there anything else?
Uh,
you know,
I mean,

631
00:38:57.821 --> 00:38:59.950
what was it,
I'm sure it's in the book,

632
00:38:59.951 --> 00:39:03.520
but what was the watershed moment where you finally saw your son have like this

633
00:39:03.521 --> 00:39:05.020
breakthrough where you felt like,
okay,

634
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:09.250
like he'll actually like this time it might take like the,
he's gone on to three.

635
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:13.810
I run.
That's incredible.
Yes.
I,
I really never had that,
like you say,

636
00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:18.400
watershed moment.
I just,
I've always always said to myself,
okay,

637
00:39:18.401 --> 00:39:22.180
everything's gonna be all right.
The best is yet to come.
He's going to be fine,

638
00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:27.330
you know?
But no,
it's been like a 30 year battle up and down roller coaster.

639
00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:30.060
And it's just like,
we always have hope.
I mean,

640
00:39:30.061 --> 00:39:32.820
we're the only two people that have never left Steven's life.

641
00:39:32.821 --> 00:39:37.120
We've always been by his side.
All.
My wife's been with me 16 years,

642
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.250
well his wife and she never did a drug,
but we've been,

643
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.800
we've been together as a family this whole time.
The other,

644
00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:46.440
there might be times we don't talk for like a year or whatever,

645
00:39:46.441 --> 00:39:48.500
but we're always there for each other.

646
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:51.990
The craziest thing you guys ever tried to get him so because I would literally

647
00:39:51.991 --> 00:39:54.210
at some point the love for my brother would be like,

648
00:39:54.211 --> 00:39:57.360
I'm just going to chain this guy to a trait.
That's what I did.
I did that.

649
00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.440
I did like go,
can't you see the tags?

650
00:39:59.441 --> 00:40:02.770
The thing is you can't do that and then it doesn't work.

651
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:07.860
My friend Mark Cantor and forecast the La,
he wanted to chain me up.

652
00:40:07.861 --> 00:40:10.320
There's radiator downstairs in his basement.
I said,

653
00:40:10.321 --> 00:40:12.910
it's not going to work because as soon as I get out,

654
00:40:12.911 --> 00:40:15.690
I don't want to have more reach that man and I don't want to go over the deep

655
00:40:15.691 --> 00:40:19.290
end either.
He sat down and had a logical conversation like,
Steve,
listen,

656
00:40:19.291 --> 00:40:22.230
I'm going to change at this rate.
Oh yeah,
mark,
can you hear me?

657
00:40:22.231 --> 00:40:25.770
I'm going to change it to this rating.
Oh yeah,

658
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:29.670
it is book two with all the pictures that he took you guys down,
Margaret,

659
00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.630
every Goddamn damn thing you guys have ever done.
Well,
family is wonderful.

660
00:40:33.631 --> 00:40:38.250
I love long.
Yeah,
great.
I used to do so many crazy things.
I would nag him,

661
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:42.370
go to her.
We had do this,
do that.
It didn't do any,

662
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:45.480
I wouldn't go in,
but he had just the right keys down.

663
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.550
This is shut him up and I go and I ended up leaving the next morning and there's

664
00:40:50.551 --> 00:40:55.551
35 $40,000 in the toilet because once you give them the money and you could

665
00:40:55.651 --> 00:41:00.040
leave 10 you don't get that money back.
Rehabbed our biggest rip off.

666
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:06.480
Exactly.
Unless you're the owner,
it's the biggest rip off.

667
00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.970
But if you're the owner,
you're,
you're,
you're making it back.

668
00:41:08.971 --> 00:41:13.020
I call him revolving doors cause you're going to keep going in and out and in

669
00:41:13.021 --> 00:41:15.270
and out.
And I planned on fastest recap.

670
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.440
You had like you went in the second,
the car drives away.
Do you walk right.

671
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.950
I didn't even get to it face my friend Bob Forest,
you know,

672
00:41:22.951 --> 00:41:24.870
he works at Dr drew on,

673
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:29.910
he put me on a plane to go to I think Michigan or something like that and I got

674
00:41:31.771 --> 00:41:35.540
on another plane and went to New York and his family too much.

675
00:41:35.541 --> 00:41:38.940
So I went to some nightclubs and people recognize me and that's,
you know,

676
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.760
two to three weeks later I was on,
I'm going to,

677
00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:45.020
I'm going to go back home and it's like I'm saying went back home,

678
00:41:45.021 --> 00:41:47.690
never checked in to see if you win.
I'll call close it here,

679
00:41:47.691 --> 00:41:51.680
but I didn't check in with them.
I just ever showed up.
Bill,
when your,

680
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:56.210
when your brother is your hero and you look up to him and he's this big rock

681
00:41:56.211 --> 00:42:00.620
star in the guy's killing himself and you watch them die and kill himself for 30

682
00:42:00.621 --> 00:42:05.170
years,
your last hope as he got to kidnap the guy,
the Los Angeles.
Right.

683
00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.520
And that's what we ended up doing and it just made it worse.

684
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:12.770
It just made a completely worse and fast forward.

685
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:15.200
Fast forward years later,

686
00:42:15.201 --> 00:42:18.290
the guy's alive and that's all that matters is words he at today.
Right.

687
00:42:18.291 --> 00:42:20.840
Today he's alive and he's healthy and you know what,

688
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:24.290
he might have been dead or he might've still,
he's still alive.
Who knows?

689
00:42:24.291 --> 00:42:29.291
But that's all that matters is the day you guys have any resentment for the shit

690
00:42:29.481 --> 00:42:33.030
you went through with your brother?
No.
No I don't.

691
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:37.500
I don't have any resentment towards my room.
I'm sure he was a drug addict too.

692
00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:40.940
I used to do drugs.
Of course.
I went to Rehab one time.

693
00:42:40.941 --> 00:42:42.320
I've had my own share of experiences,

694
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:46.850
but the one that got me high the very first time when I was 12 years old was my

695
00:42:46.851 --> 00:42:50.060
brother.
I wasn't day game,

696
00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:56.030
but I was not driving.
But you know,
every everything had happened in life.

697
00:42:56.031 --> 00:42:58.940
Happens for a reason.
It got me to where I'm at today.

698
00:42:58.941 --> 00:43:02.030
And if my brother wasn't as big rocks or I wouldn't be the agent,

699
00:43:02.031 --> 00:43:05.720
the manager that I am,
I wouldn't have this amazing lifestyle that I have.

700
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.240
But so resentments.
No,

701
00:43:08.241 --> 00:43:12.740
of course I would have loved my brother not to been a Junky for 25 30 years,

702
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:14.360
but if I wanted to rock,

703
00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:19.370
so John [inaudible] has to be a rockstar and movies though I be everyday

704
00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:25.690
ordinary average guy.
Sure.
I pick up the dog do when it's your,

705
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.520
when it's your flesh and blood,
it's a little different.

706
00:43:28.521 --> 00:43:30.830
Like you never give up on your flesh and blood and it's tall.

707
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:33.230
It's all talked about in that book and my brother's book too.

708
00:43:33.231 --> 00:43:37.190
He has a chapter in there called thug love and I mean we could make a whole

709
00:43:37.191 --> 00:43:38.480
movie on that one chapter,

710
00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:42.770
giving them a milkshake and Las Vegas and he woke up in Los Angeles and then he

711
00:43:42.771 --> 00:43:45.440
was held hostage for like three months.
I could have been going,

712
00:43:45.441 --> 00:43:46.520
I could not go to prison.

713
00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:49.250
I could've gone to prison for the rest of my life and they all,

714
00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:53.240
I committed so many felonies across the state lines,

715
00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:57.290
kid happy,
overseeing all this crazy stuff.
But you know what?

716
00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:59.510
I had no other choice.
I didn't know what else to do.

717
00:43:59.511 --> 00:44:03.860
That's my last resort is to try to help my brother.
No.
And then you know it,

718
00:44:03.861 --> 00:44:06.470
the best celebrity have after that.
Yeah.
But see,

719
00:44:06.471 --> 00:44:10.730
I would've done so every we had anyways,
you know,
it happened.
If they didn't,

720
00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.470
they didn't kidnap me.

721
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:17.300
I wouldn't have the resentment that I did have towards them towards it.

722
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:21.470
That made everything worse because they kidnap me.
I mean,
he wasn't there,

723
00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:26.740
but the people that were holding me hostage here giving me better and more drugs

724
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:30.140
then I was doing on my own.
Okay.

725
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.230
If this doesn't make you want to read all of these damn books,
I,
yeah.

726
00:44:34.231 --> 00:44:36.710
You have to have the word I want to say won't load

727
00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:40.600
<v 2>story here.
Okay.
Jamie calls me up.</v>

728
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:42.600
He's in Los Angeles and Steven and I,

729
00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:47.740
Las Vegas and Steven and Jamie calls me up and says,
Ring Steven to Los Angeles,

730
00:44:47.741 --> 00:44:51.130
drive him to Los Angeles,
Isis for what?
And he says,

731
00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:56.020
we're going to put them in a rehab.
I said,
okay.
So Steven and I get in the car,

732
00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:56.990
I,

733
00:44:56.990 --> 00:45:01.990
we're driving and we're driving to Los Angeles and he's every two minutes.

734
00:45:03.641 --> 00:45:08.350
He's poking his head in the back seat.
And I,
I know he's smoking.

735
00:45:08.351 --> 00:45:11.470
I think he spoke in weed,
but he's not,
he's smoking crack.

736
00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:15.580
So every few minutes he would go and put his hand in the back of the seat,

737
00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:16.443
you know?

738
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:22.220
<v 1>No,
you're good man.
You're good.
And so,</v>

739
00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.050
and you're not aware that you see right now

740
00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:29.250
<v 2>smoking weed.
So I could say,
I say to him,
stop smoking the weed.
Stop it.</v>

741
00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:32.520
I'm driving the car.
I don't want you to smoke in the car.

742
00:45:32.521 --> 00:45:36.180
I told you not to smoke.
And Lo and behold,

743
00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:40.020
he of course,
he's not going to stop.
He's not going to listen to anything I say.

744
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.140
And we're about an hour out of Los Angeles.

745
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:48.980
And all of a sudden I didn't know where I was and I've driven this route a

746
00:45:51.391 --> 00:45:54.990
hundred times or more.
And all of a sudden I says to Steve and I said,

747
00:45:54.991 --> 00:45:59.130
I don't understand where are we?
Why are we here?
Don't get it.

748
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.890
I stopped the car and he and he's,
and he says,

749
00:46:04.891 --> 00:46:08.730
don't worry isis.
I don't know how to get to Los Angeles.
I said,
what should I do?

750
00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:12.480
He says,
ah,
don't worry my,
I'll guide you.

751
00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:16.860
<v 1>I said,
[inaudible] okay,</v>

752
00:46:16.861 --> 00:46:19.500
go straight ahead and we go on a freeway.

753
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:26.220
I was contacted.
I never sat next to somebody doing crack.

754
00:46:26.221 --> 00:46:29.370
I had people doing it on my stoop when I lived in New York and I'd walk around

755
00:46:29.371 --> 00:46:32.510
it,
but I wasn't in and a couple different high on crack,
Steve,

756
00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:39.590
Hey,
I'm an ad or done.
I didn't want to do anything.
Oh No,
I didn't know

757
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:43.510
<v 2>what,
uh,
what happened to me.
I couldn't understand it because I never,</v>

758
00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:48.530
I never got like that.
But all of a sudden my brain went dead.
I couldn't

759
00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:54.900
<v 1>literally,
literally,
and he's,
and believe me when I tell Ya,</v>

760
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:57.920
he guided me to exactly where I wanted to go.

761
00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:01.880
Even if he's on crack or cocaine or whatever the hell he wants you to get on the

762
00:47:01.881 --> 00:47:04.470
10 you're all set.
You're going to want Florida to stay on this,

763
00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:09.440
take it wherever you're going.
You know her everywhere you're going.

764
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:13.010
If I wasn't,
didn't have that,
the drug that would have been lost to like,
Oh,

765
00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:17.060
let me give you a big head.
Okay,
now I know where to go.
Go.
Let's keep going.

766
00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:22.340
We're Jewish family.
How many Jewish families could say a story like that?

767
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:26.120
There's actually a lot.
Okay.
We'll probably is,
there was a lot more,

768
00:47:26.121 --> 00:47:27.970
but we don't know about that.
Don't know about,
I don't know.

769
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:31.120
Hopefully all the stuff that you guys are putting out there in your books,

770
00:47:31.121 --> 00:47:31.810
we'll uh,

771
00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:33.910
we'll have the same effect that you have when you talked about how you were

772
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:36.900
sexually abused and you were talking about how you dealing with the son.
That's,

773
00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:40.270
that's battling addiction.
