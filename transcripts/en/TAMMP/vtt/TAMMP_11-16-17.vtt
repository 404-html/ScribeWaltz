00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.880
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:08.700
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.720
just checking in on you.
I'm just checking in on you.
How's it going?

4
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:19.770
How's your Thursday?
How's your week?
You having a good time out there?

5
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:23.220
You're getting ready to eat your fucking face off.
Hey,
well,

6
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:24.210
here's a good one for you.

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.530
You know you're going to eat like an absolute pig on thanksgiving.

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.110
You know you're going to eat all the leftovers and all that crap.

9
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:34.050
You know you're going to drink your face off the wind the Wednesday before

10
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:36.000
Thanksgiving going out there,
right?

11
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.520
Trying to meet some ladies,
right?
Going back to your hometown.

12
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.110
You know you're going to do all of that crap as ain't just the wind screen here

13
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.510
on the microphone.
Um,
you know,
you can do all that shit.

14
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:56.310
So why not?
Why not before?
Why not now?
Just you.

15
00:00:56.311 --> 00:01:00.240
You do cardio every fucking day.
Giant Salad,

16
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.770
right?
You got a giant salad,
but the protein somewhere in your fucking day,

17
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:09.480
lunch and dinner.
Why don't you do that right up until thanksgiving,
you know,

18
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.900
and right through the Thanksgiving weekend.
Why don't you just do that every day?

19
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:17.340
So I'm gonna get on that fucking motherfucking elliptical and knock out a half

20
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.173
hour.
Why don't you do that?

21
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.680
Instead of eating yourself into a food coma and then you're going to have all

22
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:26.610
that sugar is sugar and salt in you and you know what you're going to be

23
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:27.001
thinking,

24
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.630
I should work out and all that fucking stuff is going to be sitting on your

25
00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:34.360
brain goes,
no,
ain't no working out.

26
00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:38.340
He's Ho shit near become enough fat.
Fuck is easy.

27
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.810
Yes it is easy.

28
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.170
Anything worth anything where something in life,
it's difficult.

29
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.380
Um,
come on guys.
What are we doing here?
Huh?

30
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.990
Aren't we fat enough?
How much longer,
uh,
America,

31
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.350
are we going to sit here and gloat?
How much poison is food?

32
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.610
We have more poisonous food than any other nation on the planet.
You know,

33
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.170
how much longer?
It's not even really point.

34
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.210
I think most of it now that I'm starting to watch these things on nutrition is

35
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:12.570
how they just had the whole thing upside down in the whole food pyramid was

36
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:14.940
created by a guy who didn't know shit about food,

37
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.060
who went to fucking Italy post World War Two where they lost through a bunch of

38
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:25.710
God damn nerds.
Italy lost that.
They lined up with fucking a star over there,

39
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:28.200
right?
Adolf Hitler.
Right.

40
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.870
They lined up with him and they lost.

41
00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:35.670
So he went over to a fucking war torn country,
postwar,
right?

42
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.230
Everybody was fucking broke.

43
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:41.400
So everyone was skinny and he equated it to their fucking diet and started

44
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:43.860
talking about how you wanted to do a bunch of carbohydrates.

45
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.170
Like these fucking guys who lost a Goddamn war.
Not Tell you something like that.

46
00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:52.200
I Dunno,
I'll post a video.
Um,

47
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.860
but all I know is like,
y'all know that stuff is like the devil.

48
00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.890
I still cannot get my head around the fact that I can eat this much meat into,

49
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.710
I still don't.
I think,
you know,

50
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.450
I guess it's my mother always said everything in moderation is she would yell

51
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:13.830
across the room.
Right.
Um,

52
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.620
so I guess that's what you want to do.
So I'm,
I'm just going to,

53
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.970
I'm going to do what the fuck I always do.

54
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:22.030
I do a ton of God damn cardio and I stopped beating around five o'clock,

55
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:23.920
six o'clock and then I just crushed the waters.

56
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.030
One of the meals is a fucking salad.
That's what I do.
All right.

57
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.260
That's how I lose weight.

58
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.610
I don't sit around blaming society or the fucking industry I'm in,

59
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.550
right is I'm eating a fucking candy Dapple,

60
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.650
like a lot of these fucking people out there

61
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.870
that it just give it in to their sugar,

62
00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:49.871
salt coma and then want you to sit there and accept their defeat rather than

63
00:03:50.781 --> 00:03:55.130
standing up and giving them a halftime fucking speech,
you know,

64
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.670
grabbing him by the back of their hair and pulling it out of that bowl of

65
00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:03.200
fucking painted and fucking chocolate m and m's and get right in that grill.

66
00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:07.430
Like Bobby Knight used to poking him in the chest,
you know,

67
00:04:07.431 --> 00:04:11.560
talking to them about their transition game between one meal to another.

68
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.350
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

69
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.360
<v 0>That's what's happening out there,
right?
This Co,
this fucking countries getting,</v>

70
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.440
it's getting soft.
It's getting soft.

71
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:24.730
Everybody's a Goddamn fucking victim.
Everybody has a fucking excuse,
right?

72
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:29.140
And everybody's letting them get away with it going like now.
Now,
now,
now.

73
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.290
All right.
It's not the potato chips fault.
Your fault.
All right?

74
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:38.800
You control your hands.
Stop telling your hands to go into the bag.

75
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.520
All right?
If you wait a head of lettuce to what you eat,

76
00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:46.680
those fucking chips,
like I'm telling you right now,

77
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.650
you'd be a goddamn drink boat.
You know what you got to do?

78
00:04:49.651 --> 00:04:51.360
Quit your fucking crying.
All right,
I'm done.

79
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.140
You know what song is in my head when I want to?
I was just talking to,

80
00:04:55.141 --> 00:04:58.730
I'm in the middle of a radio tour right now promoting my dates in,
uh,

81
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.410
Albuquerque and an Arizona.

82
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.830
I didn't know where the hell I'm going to be in Arizona.
Tucson or some shit.

83
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.810
And then I got a Hollywood,
Florida and I have Orlando,

84
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.650
Florida.
Well,
I will be going to the Orlando Magic game.

85
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.750
The last team I need to see protein that I need to see in the state of Florida.

86
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.350
Plus I've seen the Miami hurricanes and the Florida gators.
What's left?

87
00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:25.050
You ask the Florida State Seminoles.

88
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.650
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.560
<v 0>You know,
and his central Florida keeps making noise.
I got,</v>

90
00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:31.180
I got to go down there eventually.
Right?

91
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.403
<v 1>Uh,</v>

92
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.500
<v 0>I dunno.
I guess what's left is to fucking tried to Swim Lake Okeechobee,</v>

93
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.620
whatever the hell it is and try not to get eaten by an alligator and maybe the

94
00:05:42.621 --> 00:05:44.630
python that ate the fucking alligator.
I don't,

95
00:05:44.631 --> 00:05:47.240
I don't pretend to understand these things.
I don't,

96
00:05:47.241 --> 00:05:49.450
I don't try to pretend to understand what Florida is.

97
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:51.743
<v 1>MMM.</v>

98
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.461
<v 0>Well,
whatever.</v>

99
00:05:53.461 --> 00:05:57.500
I was just in the middle of this radio tour and I was joking around with fucking

100
00:05:57.501 --> 00:06:00.590
guy that was interviewing me and somehow we started singing that song.
Brandy,

101
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.210
remember that sound brandy was a fucking bitch.

102
00:06:04.211 --> 00:06:07.490
He ain't dead two and hippos see it.

103
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.740
But he said they're hidden,

104
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:13.430
non up pirate and he never would commit to her.

105
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.760
It's such a sad song when you really listen to the fucking lyrics.

106
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:19.040
It's like she sounds like such a nice woman.

107
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:21.950
Why doesn't she get out of that fucking bar and stopped talking to those,

108
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.770
those,
those whalers,
whatever the hell she's talking to,

109
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.440
their job takes him out to sea.
I did one cruise ship and my entire career,

110
00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:36.640
I have never been further away from anything that I knew or loved in my life.

111
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.900
You know,
people go on cruises to get rid of their spouse,

112
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.800
you know when they went through with the marriage that they didn't want to be
in.

113
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.470
And rather than just looking at everybody just saying,

114
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.530
I don't want to do this and just let everybody pelt you with the wedding cake.

115
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.780
Next thing you know your lane and your little fucking cabin on a cruise ship

116
00:06:58.781 --> 00:07:00.130
going like,
all right,
so

117
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.670
I'll tell it.
I'm going to take a picture of our mouth.
Oh my God.
I just,

118
00:07:06.671 --> 00:07:08.890
the shit that people do,
it happens to guys too.

119
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.910
People fall overboard in those things.
Why am I talking about cruise ships?

120
00:07:12.911 --> 00:07:13.780
I don't even know why.
Oh yeah.

121
00:07:13.781 --> 00:07:15.820
So why would this woman commit to these fucking people?

122
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:17.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

123
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.030
<v 0>You know,
they always make it out like she's the victim.</v>

124
00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:24.860
I think what really happened was I think brandy didn't want a relationship.

125
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.130
You know,
maybe that's what it was.

126
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.530
I just feel like for me,
all right,

127
00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:38.000
so I'm 91 days into not drinking.
I'm in overtime right now.
The movie is wrapped,

128
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.560
a basically done with my gigs for the sheer,
I'm chilling out.

129
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.050
I'm getting into the holiday spirit or Billy,

130
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:46.760
the baker's going to rear its ugly head.

131
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.560
I think I'm gonna make a blueberry pie this year.

132
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.650
You know I'm going to deep fry a fucking Turkey,

133
00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:55.760
but my wife won't let me buy the apparatus.
Why can't we just order one?

134
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.103
I Dunno,

135
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
cause it's not as fun is not that sense of satisfaction knowing that somebody

136
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:05.870
else made the fucking Turkey.
What kind of man of mine?

137
00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:07.700
I'm going to have somebody else cooked my fucking Turkey.

138
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.810
I mean it doesn't that sound borderline filthy.
That's like something.

139
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.980
If you whispered it in a woman's here at work,

140
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:18.600
I mean you'd have a fucking problem.
Harry.

141
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.940
Deep Fry my Turkey for me.
The fuck did you just say to me?
All right.

142
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:28.160
Um,
I dunno,
but you know,

143
00:08:28.161 --> 00:08:31.220
I'm getting to this point that I'm starting to understand

144
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.040
like there's this weird balance you have to have when you're married.

145
00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:38.260
You have to say exactly what the fuck you thinking.

146
00:08:38.261 --> 00:08:42.670
You have to be honest with your partner while totally agreeing with everything

147
00:08:42.671 --> 00:08:45.520
that they say.
I haven't figured it out yet.

148
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.733
<v 1>You know?</v>

149
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.980
<v 0>Hey,

Do you want to go?
No.
No,
I don't.</v>

150
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:59.130
Why?
Because it's always crowded.
It's always crowded.

151
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.460
You go down there,
you got to stand there.

152
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.190
Then you're standing outside waiting for them to fucking call your name and then

153
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:06.510
when they finally call your name,

154
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.320
he's sitting there eating has all these other people are eyeballing your plate,

155
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.050
breathing down your fucking neck from across the room.

156
00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:14.820
<v 1>Okay.</v>

157
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.220
<v 0>It's like the food version of playing golf.</v>

158
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.970
Is there anything worse than playing golf and you've got that fucking do you got

159
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:23.310
those?
Goddamn borderline pros.

160
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:28.311
A plane right behind Ya and you just see them just fucking like 80 yards away.

161
00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:30.300
Like throwing their hands up like Jesus Christ.

162
00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:34.560
How many fucking attempts do you need?
It's that same kind of pressure.

163
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.860
It's just like fucking play through.
Eat through buddy.

164
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.620
You want to sit down and order?
I'll fucking pick my plate up.

165
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.980
I don't know.
Somewhere in now.
I being honest with my wife

166
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.933
<v 2>Roger.</v>

167
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:49.350
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

168
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.230
<v 0>Don't you like me anymore?
It's like lady,
I married you.</v>

169
00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:53.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

170
00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:57.070
<v 0>I'm paying all the bills.
Okay.
What more?</v>

171
00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.460
This whole thing crumbles over some fucking eggs and I don't want to go down and

172
00:10:00.461 --> 00:10:02.080
get,
we got eggs in the fridge sweetheart.

173
00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.570
Why don't you bring your friends over here?

174
00:10:04.571 --> 00:10:09.571
They'll sit out on the back porch cause you want to get dressed up.

175
00:10:09.791 --> 00:10:14.710
We want to go out and look cute and have other women resent us for how cute we

176
00:10:14.711 --> 00:10:19.711
are talking about his pitches off of there being cute and so fucking mad at

177
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.593
them.

178
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:22.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

179
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.030
<v 0>All right,
so now that I'm back,</v>

180
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.230
I ordered the NHL and the NBA package as of yesterday,

181
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.340
I watched my first NHL game.
Why it a why yesterday,

182
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:37.200
Bruins verse the Anaheim ducks in a few was rooting for the Bruins.

183
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:38.760
What are fucking sticker?

184
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.850
I know we're really bagged up in that type of thing,
but Jesus Christ,

185
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:50.690
the one problem the Boston Bruins have had ever since they decided to blow up

186
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:56.541
the team is we lack that fucking power forward.

187
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.220
That person that is on the ice that everybody else has to be like,
Oh fuck,

188
00:11:02.221 --> 00:11:06.300
keep your head on a Goddamn swivels.
So and so's out there.
Every team,

189
00:11:06.301 --> 00:11:09.750
if you want to compete in the NHL,
you gotta have that.

190
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.500
It's like a fucking great white shark just swimming around.

191
00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:16.280
Everybody's just hoping that thing just got done eating.
You know what I mean?

192
00:11:16.281 --> 00:11:20.000
And you always keeping an eye out.
Where the fuck is that thing?
You know?

193
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.550
It was great white sharks.
They just,
they just swim.
So God damn slowly until pow,

194
00:11:23.551 --> 00:11:25.500
they fucking turn it on.
Next thing you know,

195
00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:28.590
you got to fucking 90 rows of teeth coming at you,
right?

196
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

197
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.670
<v 0>You're all drunk swimming naked out to a boy or whatever the fuck it is you're</v>

198
00:11:33.671 --> 00:11:35.050
doing at the beginning of jaws.

199
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:39.340
We don't have that ever since we got rid of Lou Cheech and uh,

200
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.340
I don't think that those people come and go out on a limb and say those guys are

201
00:11:42.341 --> 00:11:45.010
very few and far between.
We got to have our guy,

202
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.620
um,
who's our enforcer,
I don't even know.

203
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.830
And I looked at the Celtics roster as I mentioned.
It's like I knew every,

204
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.050
everybody on the Celtics and now I know like three of them,

205
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:56.950
they got rid of everybody,

206
00:11:56.951 --> 00:11:59.980
but I heard they're playing great and I believe they have a game tonight.

207
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:01.030
So I'm going to watch that.

208
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.640
And I also want to say the Bruins and playing back to back down here.

209
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.800
I think they're playing the kings.

210
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.500
These are always brutal games.
Bruins always come out here and fucking loose.

211
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.180
I can't believe the kinks it took him so God damn long to win this many games

212
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.251
all these years.

213
00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:21.940
Everybody comes down here and wants to just party in Hollywood and try to fuck a

214
00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:24.340
movie star.
That's what everybody's doing,
right?

215
00:12:24.341 --> 00:12:27.640
So then they come to the game all hung over,
right.

216
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.300
Smelling like the flavor of the month,
whoever the fuck they just bagged.

217
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:33.610
And then they go in there and they just walked through the game and they get

218
00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:36.490
their fucking asses kicked it.
This is what happens every God damn time.

219
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.940
But at least you can go down to Anaheim and beat the ducks.
Right?

220
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:46.060
The,
the,
the,
the,
the,
these equally injured ducks.
But we couldn't get it done.

221
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.470
We couldn't get fact that ducks have won the last eight regular season games

222
00:12:50.471 --> 00:12:54.610
against the Bruins.
They fucking owners,
uh,

223
00:12:54.611 --> 00:12:59.320
t were an original six team getting owned by a team that's made after a Disney

224
00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:04.300
kid movie.
How fucking sad as a,
I have no idea.

225
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.300
So anyways,
uh,

226
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:06.993
<v 3>okay.</v>

227
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.490
<v 0>I am just going to keep going with the streak.
I'm not,
I'm,</v>

228
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.640
I'm going to get to at least a hundred days and then see how I feel.

229
00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:14.440
But if I go through the end of the year,

230
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.500
I'll have four solid months that I didn't drink.

231
00:13:17.501 --> 00:13:21.700
So that's like a third of the year,
which for most people would be good.

232
00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:26.260
But if you saw the level with which I abused alcohol,

233
00:13:26.261 --> 00:13:30.320
just slapping it all over,
all over the room,
uh,

234
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.090
I would feel better if that number was up around six.
But,
uh,

235
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:39.460
as I've mentioned,
I'm turning 50 next year and I'm going to be fucking,

236
00:13:39.461 --> 00:13:43.810
I'm going staying in my fifties.
I'm going to try to,
anyways,

237
00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:46.390
I might regret telling you guys that I'm doing that,
but I'm telling you if I,

238
00:13:46.391 --> 00:13:50.710
if I can ever get fucking healthy,
I got another injury.

239
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:55.240
All right?
Listen to this.
I did inside the NFL,

240
00:13:55.241 --> 00:13:59.500
which you could watch this week on showtime,
right?
And,
um,

241
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:00.970
<v 3>okay,</v>

242
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.290
<v 0>I'm doing the show.
I'm having a great time.
Oh,
you know,
it was fucking hilarious.</v>

243
00:14:05.291 --> 00:14:07.890
I was in the green room and I walk in and,
uh,

244
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.960
Ray Lewis is there and I start telling them how I scalped a ticket to go to a

245
00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:14.050
ravens game.

246
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:15.110
<v 3>Okay.</v>

247
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:18.110
<v 0>I've told this story before.
I scalped a ticket and I go in and I sit down,</v>

248
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.250
I'm like,
Holy Shit,
this is,

249
00:14:19.251 --> 00:14:22.610
I could like announce the game from where I'm sitting.
And I'm like,

250
00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:25.640
this is the one of the best scalped tickets.
I have a gun for a great price.

251
00:14:25.641 --> 00:14:29.000
And all of a sudden the security guy just goes,
excuse me sir.
Uh,

252
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.240
I've been sad for about half hour.
Uh,
is that your seat?

253
00:14:32.241 --> 00:14:35.340
Do you have to take for the Eggo a yeah,
yeah,
it is.
And he goes,
oh great.
Could,

254
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.600
could you come out to the Ao for a second?
So I came,
I looked at my ticket.

255
00:14:38.601 --> 00:14:41.150
He goes,
yeah,
that is,
you're a,
that is your seat.
Um,

256
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.420
where did you get this ticket?
And I was like,
hey,
scalped it outside.
He goes,

257
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.150
okay,
I understand.
I understand.
Oh,

258
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:47.630
can you just come down the stairs for a second?

259
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.790
So I come down the stairs now there's another security personnel.

260
00:14:49.791 --> 00:14:51.260
There's two security people are,

261
00:14:51.261 --> 00:14:56.150
can you describe the person that you bought this ticket off of?
I'm like,

262
00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:00.030
I don't know.
He had a shirt.
I know it's going to go.
Ah,
no,
it's just,

263
00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.660
we just have some questions.
Can you walk down this aisle?

264
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.710
Peanut come like underneath.

265
00:15:03.711 --> 00:15:05.900
So now we're underneath the thing and I find just say to the guy,
go look,

266
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.290
can you quit kicking me out of this stadium 10 feet at a time?

267
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:13.070
What's going on here?
And then the guy goes,
well these were stolen.

268
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:18.350
Um,
these are season tickets and they were stolen out of one of our season ticket

269
00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:22.070
holders,
mailboxes.
So,
um,

270
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.480
this is his stolen ticket.
I go,
oh,
so what's some schooling and go,
no,
no,
no.

271
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:30.530
Well we're going to try to see if,
uh,
you know,
we can get you another ticket,

272
00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:32.510
blah,
blah,
blah,
and they will get me all the way downstairs.

273
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.330
Now I'm right next to the,
to like the side door.
And I go,

274
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.940
can you give me another ticket?
They're like,
yeah,
unfortunately not.

275
00:15:37.941 --> 00:15:38.840
And then they just kicked me out.

276
00:15:38.841 --> 00:15:41.030
The whole thing was they didn't want me to flip out and scream and yell.

277
00:15:41.031 --> 00:15:44.200
And for everybody,
the fucking NFL,
it's just,
there's such [inaudible],

278
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.630
God forbid there's an issue,
right?

279
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:52.790
So I'm telling the guys there the story,

280
00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:54.540
they're all laughing.
So I went out and I scalped.

281
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.560
I actually was so mad that I was getting kicked out that I said the fucking

282
00:15:57.561 --> 00:16:00.950
scalper was a tall,
skinny white dude who was actually a short black guy.

283
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.430
And I don't even know why I did that.
I was just so fucking mad.

284
00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:08.270
I didn't want to help anybody out.
So I went back outside scalped another ticket.

285
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.200
I paid even more money.
Now I'm sitting in the lower deck and I said,
yeah,

286
00:16:12.201 --> 00:16:15.500
and I go that.
And they're all laughing,
listen to the story and go,
yeah,

287
00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:17.450
that's the game that it was against Cleveland.

288
00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:20.690
That was the game with that dude on the browns ran for like 300 yards and set

289
00:16:20.691 --> 00:16:23.230
the rushing record and all of a sudden ray Lewis just,

290
00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:27.620
he dropped his head a little bit and he just starts staring at me and I'm

291
00:16:27.621 --> 00:16:28.790
laughing.
I'm going.
So man,

292
00:16:28.791 --> 00:16:32.330
that go put up like 295 yards because what are you talking about?

293
00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.670
I got Denny Denny run and then he goes,
then he goes,
no,

294
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.020
he goes,
that was our guy.
I forget.
He said the guy's name.
He goes,

295
00:16:42.021 --> 00:16:46.580
he ran for like two 95.
And I said,
Oh,
I'm sorry,
my bad that I laugh.
I go,

296
00:16:46.581 --> 00:16:49.970
Jesus Christ,
dude,
you are fucking looking at me.
You went all full metal jacket.

297
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.190
And everyone just started laughing.

298
00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.570
Do Ray Lewis is like the fucking coolest guy ever.
And he's still like,

299
00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:01.640
if you saw how like hurt he was,

300
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:06.670
that I would ever suggest that anyone put up close to 295 yards on a Raven's

301
00:17:09.231 --> 00:17:12.560
defense that he was a part of.
Um,

302
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:17.060
I got to ask all those guys so many cool questions.
I actually,
uh,

303
00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.070
I asked Ray Lewis if he had a,
you know,

304
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:24.830
what's it like being one of the great linebackers of all time watching how these

305
00:17:24.831 --> 00:17:27.220
linebackers,
you know,
get to just sort of,
I mean,

306
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.980
it's the wide receivers just to kind of get to skip down the damn field now.

307
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:34.160
And he goes,
oh,
he goes,
I can't,
I can't,
I have a hard time watching.
And he goes,

308
00:17:34.161 --> 00:17:35.690
I got to take like blood pressure medicine.

309
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:40.610
I'm like walking around watching the game.
So anyways,

310
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.100
we're uh,

311
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.520
we're in between segments and they actually did this segment on like how the

312
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.050
guys on defense don't know what they can and can't get away with.

313
00:17:52.051 --> 00:17:57.051
So they're playing timid and these wide receivers and quarterbacks and running

314
00:17:57.061 --> 00:17:58.440
back.
So having a field day out there.

315
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:04.310
So of course boomer Esiason is siding with the offense and um,

316
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.850
everyone on the show was signed with dietetic overpoliced a blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

317
00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:12.960
blah.
So anyway,
so the segment ends and boomers continue with the conversation.

318
00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:16.240
He goes,
did you see what happened to Aaron Rodgers?
And he goes to,

319
00:18:16.241 --> 00:18:19.560
the guy came over and he pay him.
Boomer walks over and he goes to pick me up.

320
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:22.900
And I don't know why I should've said boomer,
I saw the play.

321
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.670
So he goes to pick me up.
You know,
when you go to pick somebody up,

322
00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:29.940
what you do is you pull them in towards you and you put the pressure of you

323
00:18:29.941 --> 00:18:32.580
lifting them up across their back.
He didn't,

324
00:18:32.581 --> 00:18:36.840
he tried to pick me up from my sides and like crushed my rib cage and you just

325
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:41.460
hear it.
I just heard you just heard something pop on my right side.
And he goes,

326
00:18:41.461 --> 00:18:45.390
Oh shit.
They put me down and he and I got,
I dunno why just go.

327
00:18:45.391 --> 00:18:49.140
I think that was my back and he goes,
really?
It sounded like your ribs.

328
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.650
And I knew instantly that he fucked me up.
He,

329
00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:54.540
I don't know what the fuck he did to my obliques.

330
00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:59.040
It's not like some lifelong shit,
you know what I mean?
I'm not a millennial.

331
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.880
I'm not going to sue anybody.
This is just like four days.
Epson salt bath.

332
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:08.750
But like I knew immediately fucked me up and if somehow somebody sends this to

333
00:19:09.091 --> 00:19:12.180
him,
I want him to know that when I sit here it doesn't hurt.

334
00:19:12.181 --> 00:19:14.900
But I drove my car down at,
uh,

335
00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.920
in alley yesterday trying to like beat this traffic and it had all these

336
00:19:19.921 --> 00:19:22.710
potholes select.
The suspension was rocking back and forth.

337
00:19:22.711 --> 00:19:25.260
So I was going side to side and I had to use my old bleaks.

338
00:19:25.261 --> 00:19:26.290
I was just going down the alley.

339
00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.040
<v 4>Ah,
ah,</v>

340
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.800
<v 0>but I'm good cause I can laugh right now.
It still feels fine.
But uh,
yeah,</v>

341
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.320
you know,
it would have been such a cooler story if it was Ray Lee,

342
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.100
Ray Lewis who did it to me as opposed to a quarterback.
But here's the deal.

343
00:19:44.101 --> 00:19:45.120
He's still like six,

344
00:19:45.121 --> 00:19:49.290
four and all of those guys have like fucking gorilla strength and I'm just a

345
00:19:49.291 --> 00:19:52.630
comedian and my baby blue sweater.
Um,

346
00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.260
anyway,
so how funny is that?

347
00:19:55.290 --> 00:20:00.290
I actually went on a fucking football program with ex NFL players and came out

348
00:20:00.361 --> 00:20:02.700
of there with an injury.
I'm like day to day right now.

349
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.670
I would still start on Sunday if we were playing football,

350
00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:08.910
they'd spray it with something.
Um,
but anyways,

351
00:20:08.911 --> 00:20:13.680
I had such a great time with all of those guys and uh,

352
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.440
Ray Lewis,
Nate and a boomer,
I had such a great time on that whole thing.

353
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.710
And of course J B,
we were all teasing him about his haircut.

354
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:23.491
I don't know if it made it,

355
00:20:23.491 --> 00:20:27.300
but I said he looked like count Basie and they were trashing me for being bald.

356
00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:29.910
And all of that.
It was just a,
I wish I lived in New York.

357
00:20:29.911 --> 00:20:32.890
That's how much fun I had on that show.
Um,

358
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.630
but also I also realize like how little football I watched when I was on there,

359
00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:39.690
like when I had to pick the teams,
like I had no idea what anybody's doing.

360
00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.700
You know,
my daughter's crawling,
she starting to stand up at this point.

361
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.570
I mean that alone,

362
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.700
I can barely pay attention and was in the writer's room and then immediately

363
00:20:48.701 --> 00:20:52.960
went down to the acting gig.
So,
uh,
my apology,
I mean,

364
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.840
of all the fucking years for me to get back on that show,
the one year,

365
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.870
I think next year I'm going to get to watch a lot more.
But,
uh,

366
00:20:58.871 --> 00:21:03.130
I was sitting there like the Foi and went on the show,
like trying to study up,

367
00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:07.090
like,
you know,
the day before you finally,
and you know,
you're not going to pass,

368
00:21:07.091 --> 00:21:11.500
but you just try to get a respectable flunking grade.
And,
uh,

369
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.410
you know,
even after all that studying,

370
00:21:14.411 --> 00:21:15.880
I have no idea who the fuck is gonna win it.

371
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:21.430
I know the eagles and the rams are doing well.
It has other Vikings and,

372
00:21:21.431 --> 00:21:25.600
uh,
and even though the Patriots is seven and two,
I never believe in our defense.

373
00:21:25.601 --> 00:21:29.830
I just don't think we get enough pressure on the fucking quarterback.
And A,

374
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:33.490
they seem to be able to do pretty well against our secondary this year.

375
00:21:33.491 --> 00:21:35.440
So we'll see.
I don't know.
But anyways,

376
00:21:35.441 --> 00:21:40.150
thank you to everybody over there for having me on inside the NFL.
Please,
uh,

377
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:44.470
watch it.
This week,
uh,
Nate gave me shit about deflate gate and I of course,

378
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:49.060
took the bait once again.
I always take the bait.
I should've just been like,

379
00:21:49.061 --> 00:21:50.530
hey man,
you know,
fucking,

380
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:55.450
I got five reasons to not get upset holding up all five fingers for the five

381
00:21:55.451 --> 00:21:57.460
rings we got.
And I never thought to do that.
I immediately,

382
00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:01.070
um,
so anyway,

383
00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:05.650
so I did the fucking show and then immediately I went down to a,

384
00:22:05.651 --> 00:22:10.090
I went right to the airport because I wanted to see,
uh,
get onto my fam,

385
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.360
my family over and my family bank west out west.

386
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.480
You go back east and you go out west and uh,

387
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.960
I get to Newark Airport and I'm hungry and I quickly realized there's no way to

388
00:22:22.301 --> 00:22:26.230
get food in the air.
I flew United in the entire fucking terminal.

389
00:22:26.231 --> 00:22:29.140
When you showed up,
wherever you went to sit down to eat,

390
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.320
if there's any sort of sit down and eating,
you had to be your own waiter.

391
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:36.430
You had to interact with this fucking iPad.
And the second I sit down,

392
00:22:36.431 --> 00:22:40.180
I'm looking at my face on the screen.
I'm like,
what the fuck is this?

393
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:45.390
So I cover the camera with my wallet and the lady comes over,
I do Nada you.

394
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.610
Then I'm like,
I'm not a waiter sweetheart.
I don't work at this restaurant.

395
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:53.150
Why am I being,
why don't I,
you know,
I was being a dick to her and everything.
Um,

396
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:57.940
in the end I tipped her in cash.
So I did.
I said,
listen,
I'm not upset with you.

397
00:22:57.941 --> 00:23:02.050
I'm just upset with his fucking apparatus here.
I like human beings.
Okay.

398
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.240
And I don't like this thing,
you know,
filming me here,

399
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.970
cause that's not filming you.
It's just going to take a picture.
You get ticket.

400
00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:10.810
It's like,
what the fuck does Wendy's give a fuck about what airline?

401
00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:14.650
I'm flying on you gathering information and had to sit there and act like this

402
00:23:14.651 --> 00:23:15.820
thing isn't filming me.

403
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.890
They're going to be like white male looks to be about this old ordered the fried

404
00:23:20.891 --> 00:23:23.530
chicken sandwich and they're gonna use,
just take it.

405
00:23:23.531 --> 00:23:26.830
They're just constantly sucking this fucking information out about you.

406
00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.610
So I'm just sit down,

407
00:23:30.611 --> 00:23:34.980
don't scan your fucking ticket.
Um,

408
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.020
they're going to use all that information like,
oh no,
we're just trying to,

409
00:23:38.021 --> 00:23:42.190
you know,
if it's getting too close in your,
your,
your plane is boarding and blah,

410
00:23:42.191 --> 00:23:44.560
blah,
blah.
They're not,
that's what they're doing on one side.

411
00:23:44.561 --> 00:23:48.230
But on the other side that figuring out what race,
what sex,
what you ordered,

412
00:23:48.231 --> 00:23:50.330
where you live,
how you dressed,

413
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:55.160
all of this fucking information so you can get bombarded with even more fucking,

414
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.900
uh,
you know,
I dunno,
even more advertising.
However,

415
00:23:59.901 --> 00:24:03.350
if you just committed a murder and you think that you know by them filming you

416
00:24:03.351 --> 00:24:06.710
there and that's a good alibi,
then bought by all means don't cover it.
But,
um,

417
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:09.530
I don't know if the whole thing is fucking annoying to me.

418
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:11.120
And next time I go to Newark Airport,

419
00:24:11.121 --> 00:24:14.570
I'm just going to make sure I eat before I get there because this guy,
oh frack,

420
00:24:14.571 --> 00:24:17.780
this freckled con,
he ain't playing ball.
All right.
And with that,

421
00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:21.960

00:28:08.741 --> 00:28:12.370
I'm going to go to my little studio space and play my drums today for the first

482
00:28:12.371 --> 00:28:16.150
time.
And like,
I think like three weeks can to see if I remember how to do it,

483
00:28:16.151 --> 00:28:19.270
but I've been hitting the practice pad pretty hard.
Um,

484
00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.330
get back to taking some lessons.
Um,

485

All right?
If I hear it,

487
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.020
I want to be able to play it.
And then my technique,

488
00:28:29.021 --> 00:28:31.780
I want to not even have to think about it and have my forearms.

489

Everything's Nice and relaxed.
Relax,

Just one of those fucking guys.
And then I can actually see,
you know,

491
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.040
if I actually have any sort of talent for the goddamn instrument,

492
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:47.810
that is my goal in 2018.

I've been going to sleep like a little old lady this week.
You know,

541
00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.570
you have it just to get in one of those weird sleep patterns where raw right

542
00:32:00.571 --> 00:32:05.190
after the evening news,
you know,
you watch a little bit of jeopardy,

543
00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:07.770
you slip off your loafers.

544
00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:14.160
So you sit there on the Davenport trying to think of some fucking old people

545
00:32:14.161 --> 00:32:16.920
terms here.
I Dunno.
And I've been going to bed like at nine 30,

547
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:22.830

what exactly goes on to the food before the food gets to my table.

561
00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.550
And A,
which is why this morning I want,

562
00:33:15.551 --> 00:33:17.780
I got up so early to go to a farmer's market.

563
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:23.000
I wanted to go where the a with the local guys make it,
you know,

564
00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:26.030
where they let the chickens run free before they murdered them.

565
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.900
This is a free range chicken.

566
00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:37.940
It had up fucking wonderful seven weeks on this planet before we stuck it in a

567
00:33:38.151 --> 00:33:42.470
funnel and sliced it.
Throat actually had video of how they kill the chickens.

568
00:33:42.471 --> 00:33:45.080
That's what they stick them in.
These little,
uh,
the,
the,
the,

569
00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:49.820
the down home farmers.
The regular old farmer wasn't given into the man dude.

570
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:51.950
Um,
they got like a,

571
00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:57.790
you ever see like those fancy Baker's right as opposed to the blue collar bakers

572
00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:00.980
who got those fat little thumbs.
Um,

573
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:03.950
the fancy Baker's when they go to make one of those,
those uh,

574
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:08.150
cakes for some fancy fucking douche bag who's probably a slum Lord,
right?

575
00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:10.220
You know,
when they go to put the frosting on,
you know,

576
00:34:10.221 --> 00:34:13.790
that little fucking reverse trumpet thing that they use.

577
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.820
Why am I going so far?
Look at,

578
00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:18.800
do you remember if you have a seat back in the day,

579
00:34:18.801 --> 00:34:21.860
the original football games when they're like,
Rah Rah sis,

580
00:34:21.861 --> 00:34:25.460
boom bye bye man.
They were yelling through that little fucking,

581
00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:30.140
that little fucking funnel thing.
It had a handle on it.

582
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:31.761
I know.

583
00:34:31.761 --> 00:34:35.390
You guys know what I'm talking about where they have those and they have like

584
00:34:35.391 --> 00:34:36.170
the part,

585
00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:40.560
you know the part where you're yelling too that's on that would be like,
ah,

586
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:44.840
Jesus.
How can I explain this picture?
If you had one of those Rah Rah sis,

587
00:34:44.841 --> 00:34:45.890
boom Bah things,
right,

588
00:34:45.891 --> 00:34:50.891
and you wanted to yell up to the heavens and you fucking cocky and neck back and

589
00:34:51.231 --> 00:34:54.560
the thing was going straight up.
That's the way they have these things.

590
00:34:54.561 --> 00:34:58.400
And they have them in a circle,
like,
like 10 silver ones,

591
00:34:58.401 --> 00:35:03.290
and they take these chickens and they'll low ball and they fucking stick them in

592
00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:04.124
head first.

593
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.870
So they go right down the fucking funnel and then a little chicken heads

594
00:35:07.871 --> 00:35:10.670
sticking out the bottom and they're like all,

595
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:13.070
and then they fucking sliced her throat and they bleed them out.

596
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:18.320
That's how they do it on the regular old farms.
That's how they do it.
And uh,

597
00:35:18.321 --> 00:35:22.040
the other ones more industrial once,
they don't quite do it that way.

598
00:35:22.041 --> 00:35:24.830
So Watch how food INC check it out.
Um,
you know,

599
00:35:24.831 --> 00:35:29.570
at the end it's a bunch of fucking dead animals.
But,
uh,
I dunno,

600
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:34.550
I like clean food.
Call me crazy.
But I liked clean food so many ways.

601
00:35:34.551 --> 00:35:36.470
I was supposed to get up,
you know,
early this morning,

602
00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.300
I've been all excited all this week cause you know me,

603
00:35:39.301 --> 00:35:42.450
I see one little thing that says a corporation is fucking me over.

604
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.420
And then that becomes my quest for that week.
You know,

605
00:35:45.421 --> 00:35:49.050
it's why I don't talk on my cell phone anymore.
It's why I don't trust banks.

606
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:51.330
It's why I'm not a Democrat or Republican.

607
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:55.800
It all comes down to some fucking video that some fat fuck living in his

608
00:35:55.801 --> 00:36:00.030
mother's basement has made.
And I just take it as law.
That's how I do it.
Okay.

609
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:01.920
And um,

610
00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:03.370
<v 3>okay.</v>

611
00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:06.070
<v 5>So the whole week I've been obsessed with going to the fucking farmer's market</v>

612
00:36:06.071 --> 00:36:07.740
and every day I'm going to go and we're going,
right,
we're going.

613
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:10.990
And finally yesterday my girl couldn't take anymore and she's just like,
yes,

614
00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:14.330
we're going,
you know when they get that,
okay,

615
00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:18.430
they get like that fucking uh,
tone in their voice.

616
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:22.330
And I was just like,
what a Douche was.
My immediate thought,

617
00:36:22.331 --> 00:36:24.420
I just turned around and walked out because uh,

618
00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:27.670
you can't slap them even though they deserve it sometimes.

619
00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.710
At least he could throw something at us,
you know,

620
00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:34.780
something that's in between nerf in a blunt object.
What would that be?

621
00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:38.830
You know,
beyond a pillow but not quite the refrigerator door.

622
00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:42.970
How about a soft covered book isn't that,

623
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:50.590
and you know,
Frisbee it Adam,
cause that might catch the corner and their eye.

624
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:54.220
What you do is you sort of lob it at him,
you know,

625
00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:58.370
like a Robert Parish foul shot half that,
not the rain ball.

626
00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.450
Sort of like a half rainbow,
you know,
and it just lands on them.

627
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:06.970
The fucking meaty part of their thigh makes that nice slap sound.
Um,

628
00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:11.920
anyways.
Yeah.
So she annoys the shit out of me.
Right?
Well again at got,
okay.

629
00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:15.670
Typical broad acting like I'm being a fucking Douche bag.
Right.

630
00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:17.080
And what happens this morning?

631
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:18.480
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

632
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.440
<v 5>she's fucking sleep and like boxcar Willie until like 11 in the morning.</v>

633
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.400
And she clearly told me like fucking months ago that you have to get over there

634
00:37:26.401 --> 00:37:28.710
early because if you don't get over there early enough,

635
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.150
there's just gonna be a bunch of strawberries laying on the sidewalk,
you know?

636
00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.780
So she finally gets up,
right?
She finally gets up around,
she's in the other room,

637
00:37:36.781 --> 00:37:39.270
so you have to whisper here.
She finally gets up around fucking 11

638
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:44.320
and I'm all sleepy eye and she's like,
ah.
And she knows she fucked up.

639
00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:45.640
<v 3>Okay.</v>

640
00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.910
<v 5>She knows it.
I know it.
The downstairs neighbor knows it.</v>

641
00:37:48.911 --> 00:37:52.570
Everybody knows she's fucked up.
Why did she fuck up?
Because she overslept now.

642
00:37:52.571 --> 00:37:56.410
She fucked up cause she was a Douche the day before acting like I was

643
00:37:56.411 --> 00:38:00.130
overreacting like that worry,
we're going to fucking go.
And what does she do?

644
00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:01.413
She goes out,

645
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:06.240
she has a couple of pops and next thing you know she sleeps till fucking 11 all

646
00:38:06.241 --> 00:38:09.760
right.
And you're probably like,
well bill,
why didn't you go in their wake?

647
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:11.290
Wake her up.
Oh,
I'll tell you why.

648
00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:15.580
Because she's been breaking my balls about how I keep going to bed at nine 30

649
00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.660
and then I start puttering around like some war veteran at five in the morning,

650
00:38:19.661 --> 00:38:20.710
this whole fucking week.

651
00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:25.240
So I let her sleep thinking maybe she get up at night and maybe she get up at

652
00:38:25.241 --> 00:38:28.690
nine 30 maybe 10 at 10 I just said,
you know what?
Who gives a fuck?

653
00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:33.490
I've been eaten corn fed beef for the law my whole fucking life.
You know,

654
00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.400
I'm still walking around.
I'll do it for week.
Who gives a shit?
Right.

655
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.050
Since she wakes up 11 she's a haystack.
Okay.
God,
he fell.

656
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:45.130
Getting out of the fire is bad again.
I was like,
no,
no we're not.

657
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:50.230
She's like,
well I know I go cause you told me all this shit was uh,

658
00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:54.100
is gone if you don't get there early,
so why do I want to go over there now?

659
00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.030
I also like going over there earlier because I'm a red head and we live in a

660
00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:02.230
desert and I don't feel like standing out in the middle of the fucking street at

661
00:39:02.231 --> 00:39:04.960
11 o'clock in the morning.
Plus the football games are already on.

662
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.030
So then what does she do?
You know,
the typical codependence shit.

663
00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.830
She keeps trying to get me to go with her.

664
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.940
Well there's still gonna be some stuff left.
They'll have Kale.

665
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:18.640
They'll health from Broccoli.
Yeah.
I don't give a shit.

666
00:39:18.641 --> 00:39:21.640
I was going over there for the meat.
That's what,
that's what I was doing.

667
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.160
So you can't come with me.
No,

668
00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.160
I still like her come with me.

669
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:31.690
That fucking nightmare and I just refuse to fucking go.

670
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:35.350
I'd gotten on with my day.
I started paying my bills for Monday.

671
00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:38.740
I was going to do the podcast,
I'm going to go fucking work out.

672
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:43.090
And of course the second I started this podcast,
who comes walking in the door,

673
00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:48.310
my girl comes walking in and informed me that there was still plenty of shit

674
00:39:48.311 --> 00:39:50.440
left,
which is still not my fault.

675
00:39:50.441 --> 00:39:54.130
I went by her information that nothing would be left and for all I know she's

676
00:39:54.131 --> 00:39:58.810
fucking lion.
You know,
there was plenty of stuff left.
He could have come with me,

677
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:04.120
Athol.
Um,
so that's been my fucking morning.
Um,

678
00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:09.310
and I also realized that my fucking patriots don't play until eight o'clock at

679
00:40:09.311 --> 00:40:11.720
night,
which is five o'clock out here at five 30.
So,

680
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.140
so I had nothing better to do.

681
00:40:14.141 --> 00:40:17.560
I decided I'd do a fucking podcast rather than sitting here doing nothing when

682
00:40:17.561 --> 00:40:19.480
she came home because then she could have been like,
well,

683
00:40:19.481 --> 00:40:24.130
why didn't she come with me?
Um,
anyways,
uh,
let's,

684
00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:28.640
this is the Monday morning podcast.
Does any of that make any fucking sense?

685
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:32.720
What does that just a classic boring fucking relationship story?

686
00:40:32.721 --> 00:40:36.410
Did I just bore you for fucking nine minutes and 33 seconds?
Well,
I hope you,

687
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:39.770
I hope I did because I've been getting too many complaints about the fucking

688
00:40:39.771 --> 00:40:43.910
podcast lately.
I liked it back in the day you were more angrier,
Bill,

689
00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.740
do it on your cell phone again.

690
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.980
You know whoever's wrote me that,
you know,
what did you use to do?

691
00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:52.060
Why don't you go do that?

692
00:40:52.061 --> 00:40:55.840
Why don't you stop evolving as a fucking human being and just do it the way you

693
00:40:55.841 --> 00:40:59.950
did it two years ago where the same fucking shirt.
You know what I mean?

694
00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:02.200
You want it the exact same way.

695
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:07.620
Every fucking a fucking idiots.
Dude.

696
00:41:07.621 --> 00:41:11.140
I like their new stuff.
I liked their first two albums.
I don't like the,

697
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:14.550
I don't like when they changed and I should like people were into bands like

698
00:41:14.551 --> 00:41:17.040
that,
like people who were into like fucking youtube,
you know,

699
00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:21.810
people just can't fucking respect for the fact that they've continued to fucking

700
00:41:21.811 --> 00:41:26.490
evolve and put out killer songs,
changed their sound,
come back to their sound,

701
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:30.960
divert from it.
Become huge.
Rock stars mock being huge.

702
00:41:30.961 --> 00:41:35.120
Rock stars always coming up with new way to make it a little bit different.

703
00:41:35.121 --> 00:41:39.800
There always has to be that fucking douchebag going.
I liked it back.

704
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:40.820
I only liked him.

705
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:46.010
I liked him up until war or boy or whatever the name of their fucking albums
are.

706
00:41:46.011 --> 00:41:46.860
I don't even remember.

707
00:41:46.861 --> 00:41:50.990
I remember that one that had that fucking creepy looking kid,
you know,

708
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:55.280
looks like the poster for the grudge like 20 years before it fucking came out.

709
00:41:55.281 --> 00:41:56.660
Like there's always people like that.

710
00:41:58.050 --> 00:41:58.430
<v 3>Okay.</v>

711
00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:03.430
<v 5>Granted there are bands that evolved and then they suck like Jefferson airplane</v>

712
00:42:03.861 --> 00:42:06.620
when they became Jefferson Star ship.
But I,

713
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:11.630
I challenge you to find anything in the youtube catalog that comes anywhere near

714
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:16.310
sucking to the level of,
we built this city on rock and roll.

715
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:17.700
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

716
00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.990
<v 7>That is one of the worst.</v>

717
00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:21.260
<v 3>Okay.</v>

718
00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:22.093
<v 5>Everything,</v>

719
00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:26.030
you know that they like when they show some of the worst dictators and I'm

720
00:42:26.031 --> 00:42:28.520
really trying to avoid to say Adolph Hitler because he becomes,

721
00:42:28.521 --> 00:42:32.660
he's become like the hacky reference when you talk about evil,
you know,

722
00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:35.280
and I really think that that guy is a,

723
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:39.440
and a lot of ways overrated when you look at is number of kills verse Stalin's.

724
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:44.780
Okay.
I've talked about this before.
Stalin has 20 million confirmed kills.

725
00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:48.320
Okay.
That's fucking like what?

726
00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.200
14 million more.

727
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:57.490
14 million more than Hitler and about fucking 19 million.

728
00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:04.000
900,000
more than fucking ramble.

729
00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:08.720
Okay.
Um,
I'm,
you know what,
I'm [inaudible] that's my,
that's my thing.

730
00:43:08.721 --> 00:43:13.721
That's what that's going to be my contribution to conversation in fucking dinner

731
00:43:13.761 --> 00:43:17.270
parties.
You know,
I'm going to start going to those,
by the way,

732
00:43:17.271 --> 00:43:19.670
I'm going to get a smoking jacket and all that.
And when people go like,

733
00:43:19.671 --> 00:43:23.930
oh my God,
he's like the next Hitler and I mean,
now he's the next styling.

734
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:28.610
<v 7>Who is that?
I don't know who the fuck that.
Of course you don't get dumped.
Fuck.</v>

735
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.240
You probably know that.
You know what Hitler did do ya?

736
00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:34.100
Or You just and fucking spout in the shit out the way.

737
00:43:34.101 --> 00:43:38.930
I do every week on the podcast.
You dumb fuck I'm speaking of which this is,

738
00:43:38.931 --> 00:43:43.370
this is a new part of the podcast.
It's,
it's this,
the bills,
dumb bells,

739
00:43:43.371 --> 00:43:47.470
dumb quote of the week.
Um,
I had a bunch of people,
um,

740
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.490
correct me on something that I've been saying for years.
I use the expression,

741
00:43:52.491 --> 00:43:57.491
I said for all extensive purposes and somebody wrote for all extensive purposes.

742
00:43:58.341 --> 00:43:59.360
It's not,
um,

743
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:04.220
you don't say it that way and you don't say it the way most other people say all

744
00:44:04.221 --> 00:44:05.720
intensive purposes.

745
00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.590
It's actually for all intense and purposes

746
00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:14.750
you like that.
Most people say for all intensive purposes,
right?

747
00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:15.700
<v 5>When they fuck it up,</v>

748
00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:21.330
Bill Burr took it to a whole new level of stupid and said for all extensive

749
00:44:21.611 --> 00:44:22.444
purposes.

750
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:24.040
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

751
00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:28.870
<v 5>I do that all the time.
I say there's something else I say it has to do with a,</v>

752
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:35.310
what the fuck is it?
The beginning of your college year when you're a freshman?

753
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:39.520
Ah,
Jeez.
And my memory is just fucking shot.

754
00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.700
I used to always work those things as a standup comic.
You'd come in,

755
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:46.990
it'd be like the first,
uh,
why don't I keep thinking salutation?

756
00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.120
That's not what it is.
I know it begins with an s though.

757
00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:51.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

758
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:55.290
<v 5>Oh,
this happens to me like 20 times a day.</v>

759
00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:58.470
Is it some sort of fish that I can be eating to help me with this?

760
00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:01.470
I used to do the gigs every year.
The beginning of the year,

761
00:45:01.471 --> 00:45:03.410
incoming freshmen gigs should come in and they,

762
00:45:03.411 --> 00:45:07.650
we sit in there with their parents and my college age will be like,
uh,
uh,

763
00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:12.760
<v 7>Billy.
Ah,
we got a,
we got,
I got a Gig for,
yeah,
the parents are going to be there.</v>

764
00:45:12.761 --> 00:45:14.530
So it makes it,
you don't say Fuck

765
00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:18.850
<v 5>God damn.
And I forget,
but whatever I used,</v>

766
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:23.350
I used to fuck that word up all the time.
Um,
so whatever.

767
00:45:23.351 --> 00:45:26.260
So I learned something.
It's for all intents and purposes,

768
00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.410
I used to say Pelo instead of pillow,

769
00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:33.400
<v 7>p l l,
O,
I'm a fucking moron.
And I don't know why you guys,
you know what?</v>

770
00:45:33.401 --> 00:45:35.050
You assholes.
I know why you listen to me.

771
00:45:35.051 --> 00:45:38.530
You listen to me because my level of stupidity makes you feel better about

772
00:45:38.531 --> 00:45:41.560
yourself,
doesn't it?
Huh?
What does that say about you?

773
00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:47.470
You fucking horse.
See how I got out of that by trying to blame you.
That's,

774
00:45:47.471 --> 00:45:51.400
that's it.
That's a technique I use.
Am I arguing?
Um,
but it hasn't,
wasn't all bad.

775
00:45:51.401 --> 00:45:54.400
I actually got,
I got some thanks last week from a,

776
00:45:54.401 --> 00:45:59.290
from a hormone it said Bill.
Um,
you were wondering if there are any,

777
00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:02.260
oh,
Jesus Christ.
I fucking,

778
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:08.470
I copied and pasted the wrong one here.
This isn't from a woman.
Listen,
this bill.

779
00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.390
Yah.
You were wondering if there were,

780
00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.620
there are any Jews that listen to your podcasts.

781
00:46:12.621 --> 00:46:16.390
There are Jews who listened to your podcast.
I am one of them.
And in fact,

782
00:46:16.391 --> 00:46:20.140
an Orthodox Jew.
I'm not Hasidic,
I'm not his Siddiq Jew,

783
00:46:20.141 --> 00:46:23.620
but it's the same thing without the curls.
Dude.
That's bullshit.

784
00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.510
There's got to be something more than that.

785
00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:27.760
<v 5>I know you just made a joke though.</v>

786
00:46:27.761 --> 00:46:31.300
What is the difference between an Orthodox Jew and a Hasidic Jew?
I know.

787
00:46:31.301 --> 00:46:35.090
I could fucking Google that right now and get some other morons.
Fucking not,

788
00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:36.550
I'm not saying you're a moron,
you know what I mean?

789
00:46:36.551 --> 00:46:40.450
Just get some morons version of what that is.
Um,

790
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:42.461
I wasn't even that place.

791
00:46:42.461 --> 00:46:47.380
I used to go to down on ninth avenue and it was a best electronic store,

792
00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:50.830
uh,
and fucking New York Jr's,

793
00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:52.571
something like that.

794
00:46:52.571 --> 00:46:56.560
It was like a block over from Madison Square Garden at where they are now.

795
00:46:56.561 --> 00:46:59.620
Those guys or those guys,
Orthodox Jews are they Hasidic Jews?

796
00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:01.750
I don't know what they were,
but they were the shit.

797
00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.660
They knew about everything and uh,

798
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:07.390
they had great prices and they weren't open on Sundays and I respected that.

799
00:47:07.391 --> 00:47:08.830
You know,
somebody is still doing it.

800
00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:13.120
The little house in the prairie way observing the sabbath.

801
00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:14.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

802
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:18.110
<v 7>That's one of the worst things that we've done as a culture as far as getting</v>

803
00:47:18.111 --> 00:47:21.950
away from religion is we got,
we got away from a fucking day off.

804
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:26.840
<v 5>You know,
this is how old I am.
I remember when fucking malls and all that shit,</v>

805
00:47:26.841 --> 00:47:31.510
we're closed on Sundays.
You buy liquor.
Is that still true?

806
00:47:31.511 --> 00:47:34.540
Can you still not by luck,
he couldn't buy bear.
You couldn't fucking do anything.

807
00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:38.860
He just had to sit there and think about why God was going to send you to hell,

808
00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:42.370
you know?
But at least you weren't working.

809
00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:46.900
You guys remember that little house in the prairie episode where fucking,
uh,
uh,

810
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:50.380
Michael Landon was busting his ass all week and then they had to go to church on

811
00:47:50.381 --> 00:47:54.460
Sunday and he was so fucking tired.
He fell asleep in his church clothes.

812
00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:58.000
And the mother looked at him and he's like,
should I wake them up?
And she's like,

813
00:47:58.001 --> 00:48:01.990
God,
no,
he's sleeping like an angel.
God wouldn't want me to bring him to church.

814
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:04.540
He,
he,
he should.
This is a day of rest.

815
00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:08.620
He's resting like the Lord after six days of creating an universe.

816
00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:10.390
So the bitch goes to church,

817
00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.550
she goes to church,
and when she comes back,

818
00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:20.700
this asshole woke up from his little slumber and he was outside with an ox and

819
00:48:20.771 --> 00:48:23.470
he was plowing the fields again and all did she get mad at him?

820
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.580
She really got mad at him.
And,
uh,
then the,

821
00:48:27.581 --> 00:48:31.240
that little girl's skipped down the hill and she fell into some shrubs and that

822
00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:33.970
was the end of it.
And that was another episode of Little House on the prairie.

823
00:48:33.971 --> 00:48:37.510
Let's continue on with the a orthodox Jewish person's email.

824
00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:40.360
Cause last week I was talking about a beanie.
Is that,

825
00:48:40.361 --> 00:48:41.860
is that offensive or whatever he said,

826
00:48:41.861 --> 00:48:46.861
I wanted to let you know that there is essentially the Yamaka and yes,

827
00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:50.320
there is an r in there.
Um,

828
00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:54.400
but it's sort of silent is a skull cap as opposed to a beanie,

829
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:58.600
which you were sort of confused about.
Sort of confused.
You'd be a nice,

830
00:48:58.601 --> 00:49:03.130
here I'm calling it a beanie.
Uh,
should not insult anyone.

831
00:49:03.131 --> 00:49:07.720
It's almost the same thing.
What is the pope were technically,
it's called a,

832
00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:13.030
I can't even read what the is a Catto.
Z.
U.
C.
C.
H.
E.
T.
T.

833
00:49:13.031 --> 00:49:17.650
O m also means skullcap.
Um,

834
00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:22.680
the real meaning of the Yamaka is Yar fear of Mecca.

835
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:27.900
The king and [inaudible] signifies that there is someone up above and that we

836
00:49:28.601 --> 00:49:30.610
are limited moral beings.

837
00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:32.510
<v 3>Okay.</v>

838
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:34.190
<v 5>Well what do you mean it's saying,
okay,</v>

839
00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:35.850
<v 3>okay.</v>

840
00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:40.200
<v 5>Doesn't it really signify that there's someone above that you should be scared?</v>

841
00:49:40.201 --> 00:49:42.540
Shit of and that we're limited debts.
Easy.

842
00:49:42.541 --> 00:49:46.950
That's the thing that I never liked about organized religion is the bully
factor.

843
00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:51.390
I couldn't have,
it's just like,
why is this?
How has God already mad at me?

844
00:49:51.391 --> 00:49:53.850
I'm six years old.
You know what I mean?

845
00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:58.360
It just created like if you believe in this higher power,

846
00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:03.250
it's just fucking angry.
Douchebag always looking down at you.
Pissed off at you.

847
00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:07.420
You know what I mean?
Why are you fucking mad at me?
You made me,

848
00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:11.500
you know what I mean?
If I fucking built a car from ground up and it didn't run,

849
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:15.070
didn't run correctly,
who the fuck am I going to blame the car?

850
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:20.060
That doesn't make any sense.
Did what I just say make any sense?

851
00:50:20.061 --> 00:50:22.280
I don't fucking know.
I like to just finish this.
Um,

852
00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:27.590
also you mentioned how the guy on the plane was wearing a Yamaka big,

853
00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:31.460
you weren't sure if it was a hat or some sort of giant Yamaka.

854
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:32.720
I totally agree with you.

855
00:50:32.721 --> 00:50:37.400
I wear a normal size Yamaka and am a little annoyed even when someone wears one

856
00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:42.290
so big that it covers their whole head,
almost like a hat,
but to each his own,

857
00:50:42.291 --> 00:50:46.920
I guess.
Um,
anyways,
a big fan of your comedy and your podcasts.

858
00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:50.750
Uh,
well,
thank you for listening.
I appreciate that.
You don't want to,

859
00:50:50.751 --> 00:50:55.200
I actually have a theory on those big time.
Yamakas I think that that is the,
uh,

860
00:50:55.500 --> 00:51:00.420
that's the poor man's toupee after a while because if you go on bald in the
back,

861
00:51:00.421 --> 00:51:02.220
you start to lose it in the back like I am.

862
00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:07.830
I'm a Yamaka is great because it buys you another three years of people not

863
00:51:09.511 --> 00:51:13.730
knowing that you're losing your hair.
See,

864
00:51:13.731 --> 00:51:16.850
a lot of people don't realize that Sammy Davis Jr was actually losing a little

865
00:51:16.851 --> 00:51:19.880
bit of his Afro and that's why he converted to Judaism.

866
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:23.360
A lot of people thought it was a,
it was a show business move,
but it wasn't,

867
00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:27.980
he was going bald.
Your hair to,
you heard it here first.
So now I'm fascinated.

868
00:51:27.981 --> 00:51:31.850
What is the difference between an Orthodox Jewish person in his Siddiq shoe?

869
00:51:31.851 --> 00:51:36.080
What is the difference?
And also,
do you believe in an afterlife?

870
00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:37.070
<v 3>Okay.</v>

871
00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:39.170
<v 5>Do you believe that God is mad at you?</v>

872
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:43.850
What are the Catholic Shit that I learned?
Um,

873
00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:45.550
<v 3>okay.</v>

874
00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:47.410
<v 5>Can you eat a cheeseburger on Friday?</v>

875
00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:56.050
And I know like all religions,
you consider yourselves 100% right?

876
00:51:56.051 --> 00:52:00.250
And the chosen ones,
you guys have the Notre Dame.
God loves us best.

877
00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:05.050
You know,
do you have that to that disease that is in every fucking religion.

878
00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:07.000
You shouldn't kill anyone,

879
00:52:07.001 --> 00:52:10.450
but God loves us the best said anyone who doesn't believe what we believe,

880
00:52:10.451 --> 00:52:13.150
it's going to hell.
How a great week everybody.

881
00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:16.120
Be sure to pass that on to people who don't believe in.

882
00:52:16.121 --> 00:52:19.330
That's why does every character my fucking act talk like that?

883
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:21.490
<v 3>Okay.</v>

884
00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:23.830
<v 5>What are the priests used to sound like at my church?</v>

885
00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:25.320
<v 3>Okay.</v>

886
00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:28.420
<v 5>Hey,
how you doing?
Look,
I'm pretty good in that old boy outfit.</v>

887
00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.080
Go ahead and lift it up a little bit.
Um,
thank you.

888
00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:35.370
That was my impression of a Catholic priest.
All right.

889
00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:39.550
I've been doing a lot of ranting and raving on this podcast.
People,
um,

890
00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:42.950
talking about those little save,
you know,

891
00:52:42.951 --> 00:52:47.420
those little scan cards at the grocery store and somebody told me that what

892
00:52:47.421 --> 00:52:50.960
you're actually doing is taking a survey and a,
you know,

893
00:52:50.961 --> 00:52:52.990
to help them figure out what products you can't live without.

894
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.780
So they can jack the price up and I've actually taken that as law.

895
00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.480
So this is somebody and I have had a bunch of different theories.

896
00:52:59.481 --> 00:53:01.260
There's another theory.
Um,

897
00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:04.520
a couple of weeks ago you brought up the saber cards at the store.

898
00:53:04.521 --> 00:53:05.810
I was wondering what the purpose of,

899
00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:08.540
and you are wondering what the purpose of them was.
Um,

900
00:53:08.541 --> 00:53:11.870
you speculated that it was so they knew what you were buying to jack up the

901
00:53:11.871 --> 00:53:15.320
prices.
But with the bar codes,
bar code scanning,

902
00:53:15.321 --> 00:53:18.890
they already know how much inventory they move and what sells better than other

903
00:53:18.891 --> 00:53:19.190
things.

904
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:23.630
The purpose of the car is to gather your information to sell it to mailing
lists.

905
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:24.770
<v 3>Okay.</v>

906
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:29.770
<v 7>Who send you junk mail or spam since they always ask for an email address,</v>

907
00:53:29.791 --> 00:53:33.870
they also can be used as an incentive to keep you going to the store instead of

908
00:53:33.871 --> 00:53:37.890
a competitor.
I,
he going to Macy's instead of JC penny's.
Uh,

909
00:53:37.891 --> 00:53:40.410
they give you the discount without the card occasionally.

910
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:44.040
So you can be lured into saving 10% or so every time you go there.

911
00:53:44.041 --> 00:53:45.750
So they can eventually get your information.

912
00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:49.480
<v 5>Um,
eh,
your guess is as good as mine.
I don't know what they're up to,</v>

913
00:53:49.481 --> 00:53:53.830
but I also noticed that most of the shit that's on sale is there bootleg version

914
00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:57.940
of the real shit.
You know what I mean?
Like Ralph's olive oil,

915
00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:02.410
you know,
I've noticed that,
uh,
that's another great way.
Like they could be like,

916
00:54:02.411 --> 00:54:06.400
okay,
we're selling the food.
What if we made it also,
you know,

917
00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:09.010
and had our own fucking farms.
I Dunno.
I just don't like,

918
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:12.370
I don't trust people who are going out of their way to give me a fucking break.

919
00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.200
I don't,
you know what I mean?

920
00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.470
That's like Dev to fucking Andrew Carnegie kind of like,

921
00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:19.940
<v 1>yeah,</v>

922
00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:21.080
<v 5>way of doing shit.
You know,</v>

923
00:54:21.081 --> 00:54:23.570
you fuck people over your whole life and then the Andia life,

924
00:54:23.571 --> 00:54:26.510
you're worried that maybe really there is a god and then you become a

925
00:54:26.511 --> 00:54:29.630
philanthropist and you start giving me your shit away.
Fuck you.

926
00:54:29.631 --> 00:54:32.210
You sit there with your guilt.
I'll pay full price for the peanut butter.

927
00:54:32.211 --> 00:54:35.300
Thank you very much.
All right,
another theory.
Um,

928
00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:36.490
<v 1>yeah.</v>

929
00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:38.830
<v 7>Uh,
what the fuck is this one?
This guy says,</v>

930
00:54:38.831 --> 00:54:42.760
I'm a software engineer who finished working for a company that stores and

931
00:54:42.761 --> 00:54:47.590
reports on all sorts of insane sales data.
Some examples of that type of data.

932
00:54:47.591 --> 00:54:52.150
They can gather a sales of products based on ethnicity.
Yeah.

933
00:54:52.151 --> 00:54:54.940
See this is why I think they also want the card because it's not enough to know

934
00:54:54.941 --> 00:54:59.560
all we sold 20 boxes of fruit loops.
They want to know was it a guy,

935
00:54:59.561 --> 00:55:04.510
was it a fucking girl?
How old were they?
What color?

936
00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:05.500
Um,

937
00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:10.390
the main data I saw in this kind was defined as Hispanic or non Hispanic.

938
00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:13.800
I guess that's sales based on ethnicity.
Um,

939
00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:16.180
this is a guy who gathers this data.

940
00:55:16.181 --> 00:55:19.210
I guess he says if there was a floor display in some store,

941
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:23.590
what is the effect on the sales of the item while it,
the display

942
00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:26.143
<v 1>what</v>

943
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:29.630
<v 7>not worst?
If there was a floor display in the store,</v>

944
00:55:29.631 --> 00:55:33.950
what is the effect on sales of that item while the display is present?

945
00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:38.630
Let's say for example,
there was a NASCAR event spa sponsored by Coca Cola.

946
00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:43.820
They keep track of coke sales in that region.
Around the time of that event.

947
00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:47.810
Furthermore,
they analyze if the cost of sponsoring this event made it,

948
00:55:47.811 --> 00:55:50.840
that made them enough money to profit to make it worthwhile.

949
00:55:50.841 --> 00:55:54.770
Sponsoring similar events.
This is just a small portion of wacky shit.

950
00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:58.130
They update weekly.
That was written in capital letters weekly,

951
00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.560
I guess that's important.
Weekly.
Um,

952
00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:04.340
they know every single damn item that was moved out of each and every store

953
00:56:04.341 --> 00:56:07.040
every single week.
So basically the stores with the savvy,

954
00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:10.550
the savvy saved cards get two huge benefits.

955
00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:15.230
They sell this data to my old company to make money and they let the consumer

956
00:56:15.231 --> 00:56:16.041
feel as they got,

957
00:56:16.041 --> 00:56:20.720
they have some kind of superhuman power to save 40 cents when they buy three

958
00:56:20.721 --> 00:56:24.040
gallons of milk in one visit.
So there you

959
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.140
<v 5>go.
I don't know you're helping them gather information.</v>

960
00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:28.480
I don't like the fucking pricks so I'm not using one.

961
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:34.510
Um,
all right.
Now let's get to the meat of the podcast here.
People,

962
00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:35.410
shall we,

963
00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:39.250
I'm doing this on a football fucking Sunday right now cause I could give a shit

964
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:42.130
about other teams in a league right now.

965
00:56:42.131 --> 00:56:44.800
All I give a fuck about right now is my patriots.

966
00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:47.590
And it's basically because I've watched so much fucking hockey this week that

967
00:56:47.591 --> 00:56:51.690
I'm kind of all,
I'm done with sports.
I watched,

968
00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:56.220
I was flipping back and forth between the Ohio state,

969
00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:59.460
Iowa Hawkeyes game this week,

970
00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:04.550
and I was also flipping back between that and the USC Stanford Game and Jesus

971
00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:06.930
Christ.

972
00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:11.930
How about a moment of silence for the fucking fans of the USC Trojans who went

973
00:57:13.711 --> 00:57:18.480
out to sea?
I mean that was a fucking ass rape and you guys took,
you know,

974
00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.760
and I'll tell you right now,
Trojan fans,

975
00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:25.970
you have no fucking right getting mad at Jim Harbaugh for going for two point,

976
00:57:26.251 --> 00:57:27.840
let me,
let me,
let me,
let me set this up.

977
00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:32.640
Basically Stanford was up 48 to 21

978
00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:37.150
for those of you overseas,
usually it just kick an extra point,

979
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:41.790
right to make it 49 or you can go for a two point conversion.

980
00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:45.940
There's no reason to go for a two point conversion when there's six minutes left

981
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:50.500
and you're up by four or five scores and they went forward and the crowd started

982
00:57:50.501 --> 00:57:55.360
booing.
And um,
you know,
you got to understand you guys,

983
00:57:55.361 --> 00:57:58.840
USC for the last five years,
you have been raping everyone in the pack.

984
00:57:58.841 --> 00:58:02.830
10 get bent him over.
I mean,
how many times did you guys score a 50,

985
00:58:02.831 --> 00:58:07.360
60 points?
Sent the other team crying on their little team bus,

986
00:58:07.361 --> 00:58:10.960
send them home crying,
right?
Well,
what goes around comes around,

987
00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:12.820
add a,

988
00:58:12.821 --> 00:58:16.690
I became a huge Stanford and Jim Harbaugh fan with the fact that he went for two

989
00:58:16.691 --> 00:58:18.670
points and then he also,
in the end,

990
00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:21.130
they got the ball back again and he went for the end zone.

991
00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:23.590
The end up winning 55 to 21.

992
00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:29.050
Jim Harbaugh was trying to literally end the football program at USC.

993
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:31.830
It was one of the most venerable act,

994
00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:34.640
the biggest acts of vengeance I've seen in sports in awhile.

995
00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.720
I fucking loved every second of it.
Um,

996
00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:41.740
and I was also watching the,
uh,
the Osu,
uh,

997
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:45.370
Iowa Hawkeyes game and those youth fans of the podcast know that my new

998
00:58:45.371 --> 00:58:48.970
tradition is I go to the rose bowl every year.
So both of those games were huge.

999
00:58:48.971 --> 00:58:53.380
I was,
I ain't know,
I really didn't want to see USC again.
Mainly because,

1000
00:58:53.381 --> 00:58:57.760
you know,
I like variety.
And that fat cunt from last year's game was a USC fan.

1001
00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:02.620
So I'm happy that she had a miserable day and now she probably didn't 100%.

1002
00:59:02.621 --> 00:59:05.830
She probably,
you know,
I had a dozen donuts in front of her,

1003
00:59:05.831 --> 00:59:09.790
so it wasn't a total loss.
Really.
Bill,
11 months later,

1004
00:59:09.791 --> 00:59:13.840
you're still giving a shit about our weight.
Yeah,
I am.
Um,

1005
00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:15.760
<v 1>okay.</v>

1006
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.790
<v 5>And then Iowa,
you know that fucking quarterback for Iowa,</v>

1007
00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:21.830
that kid's 19 years old.
I'll tell you all,

1008
00:59:21.831 --> 00:59:25.010
you longhorn fans sitting there talking about that Colt Mccoy,

1009
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:28.640
that kid at Ios was,
those are the fucking place.

1010
00:59:28.641 --> 00:59:31.780
Those are the passes you have to make to make it onto the fucking pros.

1011
00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:32.960
All right?

1012
00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:37.040
You have to throw the same kind of throws that they throw at the NFL level.

1013
00:59:37.041 --> 00:59:40.940
You can't be running the fucking option and gained in like 150 yards a game.

1014
00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:45.590
And then also throwing for 200.
No one gives a fuck the second you start running,

1015
00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:48.980
watch Tim Tebow.
Watch that guy.
When he goes into the draft,

1016
00:59:48.981 --> 00:59:53.870
that guy's going to be like,
I swear if he goes in the second round,

1017
00:59:53.871 --> 00:59:57.880
it's not going to surprise me.
He's a tight end playing fucking you.

1018
00:59:57.881 --> 01:00:00.230
You're not in that Jesus Freak.

1019
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:04.070
I don't give a fuck how many psalms he writes underneath his fucking eyes is

1020
01:00:04.071 --> 01:00:08.600
going to get laid out and the pro level,
he's going to get fucking laid out.

1021
01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.030
I guarantee that's my prediction.
All right.

1022
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:13.040
And they're going to make them a flanker.

1023
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:16.760
They're going to bring back that position.
Um,
so anyway,
so I did that.

1024
01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.630
I watched the,
uh,
and then I watched stuff,

1025
01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:24.640
the flyers and the sabers and I watched the Bruins and the penguins game.

1026
01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:27.850
Um,
actually watch the penguins game this morning.

1027
01:00:27.851 --> 01:00:32.560
I want you to fucking recording of it.
So I'm all,
I got nothing left.

1028
01:00:32.561 --> 01:00:35.680
I can't watch any more fucking sports,
but I have to watch the patriots tonight,

1029
01:00:35.681 --> 01:00:39.460
play a cunt face Magoo and the Indianapolis Colts.

1030
01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:45.790
And I really hope to patriots win because I really want to hear how Peyton

1031
01:00:45.791 --> 01:00:49.270
manning is going to figure out how to complain about Bill Belichick and the

1032
01:00:49.271 --> 01:00:50.230
Patriots this year.

1033
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:55.360
That guy's one of the biggest fucking babies in the history of the NFL.

1034
01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:59.530
One of the biggest crybabies in the history of the fucking NFL.

1035
01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:02.990
<v 2>They were holding onto our receivers at night.</v>

1036
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.280
I couldn't get to Paul to them.

1037
01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:09.780
<v 5>I remember that year he cried about it after the game,</v>

1038
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:14.720
he made a tape.
Okay?
Three weeks later at the pro bowl,
he cried about it.

1039
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:17.630
He quiet about it all the way to the draft.
Now,

1040
01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:21.980
if you're ever watching the NFL and you're wondering why is it illegal to cover

1041
01:01:21.981 --> 01:01:26.050
receivers now it's because of Peyton manning whining.

1042
01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:31.790
He wore a diaper from fucking January until may crying about this fucking game

1043
01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:38.890
<v 2>and then they could run.
I feel like a jerk.</v>

1044
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:43.930
<v 5>And then what happens?</v>

1045
01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.430
They make this rule where basically you can't cover receiver and the very next

1046
01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:52.180
year he goes out,
not only does he break Dan Marino's touchdown record,

1047
01:01:52.181 --> 01:01:55.300
he shatters it.
A record that had been around for 20 years,

1048
01:01:55.301 --> 01:01:57.010
you know I had been around for 20 years.

1049
01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:01.690
I'll tell you why because you could cover receivers and Dan Marino was the shit.

1050
01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:06.850
That's why Dan Marino owns every fucking passing record out there except Brett

1051
01:02:06.850 --> 01:02:11.320
Farve decided to play till he was 50 you know Jesus Christ.

1052
01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:14.790
If Dan Marino play til he was 50 you never,
you never would occur.

1053
01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:18.760
And you couldn't cover receivers that gay.
What a fucking throw 90 touchdowns.

1054
01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:21.510
<v 7>And I hated the Guy Patriots Fan.</v>

1055
01:02:21.511 --> 01:02:24.810
He used to kill us all the time and people still give the gun shit cause he

1056
01:02:24.811 --> 01:02:26.400
never won a super bowl.
What was he supposed to do?

1057
01:02:26.401 --> 01:02:30.540
Tackle people to you fucking morons.
That guy never had a running back.

1058
01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:34.260
Dan Marino is the greatest quarterback that ever fucking played.

1059
01:02:34.261 --> 01:02:35.940
The game guy was a beast.

1060
01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:40.260
Second year in the league he throws for like 5,000 yards.
Who does that?
Nobody.

1061
01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.480
Nobody does that.
Okay.

1062
01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:47.220
So this half retarded Frankenstein is coming in as big Frankenstein fucking
head.

1063
01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:49.380
He's coming in there to play the Patriots today.

1064
01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.450
And I don't know what's going to happen.

1065
01:02:51.451 --> 01:02:55.210
You know what's great is I'm recording this before the game happened.
So I gotta,

1066
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:57.270
I gotta talk some Shit here.
What I think's going to happen,

1067
01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:59.010
I actually think the cults are going to win.

1068
01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:03.480
I think the Patriots' defense is still,
it's too new.
It's too young.

1069
01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:06.870
And even though bill Bellacheck is a defense of genius,

1070
01:03:06.871 --> 01:03:09.960
and he slowly molding them into that suffocating,

1071
01:03:09.961 --> 01:03:13.440
quote unquote boring defense that we had,

1072
01:03:13.441 --> 01:03:16.080
remember that the beginning of the two thousands when everybody said the

1073
01:03:16.081 --> 01:03:20.460
Patriots were a boring team with no stars on it.
And I take Peyton manning over,

1074
01:03:20.461 --> 01:03:25.461
fucking Tom Brady wants to score three super bowls to one.

1075
01:03:25.531 --> 01:03:28.950
Rarely you'd rather have fucking one title rather than three.
Well,

1076
01:03:28.951 --> 01:03:32.970
good luck to Ya.
So,
um,
I dunno,

1077
01:03:32.971 --> 01:03:35.430
I dunno what's gonna happen today,
but,
uh,
I have faith,

1078
01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:38.360
I have faith in my boys and I think we're gonna fucking,
uh,

1079
01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:39.660
we're going to eke out a victory.

1080
01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:43.620
And I think fucking Peyton manning is going to cry about it and he's gonna throw

1081
01:03:43.621 --> 01:03:46.680
his team under the bus.
We Hash,
we had from protection issues,

1082
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:51.120
we had protection shoe.
Fucking what a Douche bag.

1083
01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:52.800
You know what I mean?

1084
01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.340
He should go have a sword fight with that fucking idiot kicker.
His all right,

1085
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.540
there you go.
That's my prediction.

1086
01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:05.640
Um,
anyways,
was there a prediction in there?
Yeah,
I'm,
I'm my heart's saying,

1087
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:08.340
my heart is saying that the Patriots are going to win by three.

1088
01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:12.720
My brain is telling me that we might lose by seven just because,
um,

1089
01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:15.000
I just,
I,
like I said,

1090
01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:18.480
we have a brand new fucking defense and it's going to take them,

1091
01:04:18.481 --> 01:04:19.111
believe it or not,

1092
01:04:19.111 --> 01:04:23.730
it does take a good year or two for guys to get used to each other to know where

1093
01:04:23.731 --> 01:04:25.890
they're going to be at,
you know,

1094
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:29.190
to know where you got help and all that type of shit.
So anyways,

1095
01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:33.090
let's continue on with the podcast.
Oh,
let's get into this shit storm.

1096
01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:37.050
Last week I did a,
uh,

1097
01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:41.790
somebody asked me a question about why when a guy does something,

1098
01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:46.470
um,
for his girlfriend,
why is it never enough?
And one of the,

1099
01:04:46.471 --> 01:04:50.640
one of the problems that I've had and that this guy had last week as you,

1100
01:04:50.641 --> 01:04:55.641
you try to plan something that both you and your girlfriend can enjoy as your

1101
01:04:57.451 --> 01:04:58.081
night out.

1102
01:04:58.081 --> 01:05:03.081
And evidently women have a problem when you pick something for the both of you

1103
01:05:03.571 --> 01:05:08.571
to do that you as a guy will also enjoy evidently from what I'm reading from

1104
01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:12.690
these fucking psycho emails that I got this week,

1105
01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.980
is that if it's not 100% about them,
if you

1106
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.160
don't literally make a rose bowl fucking float,

1107
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:27.110
set them on it and then drag it down street with your fucking teeth.

1108
01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:31.100
They feel that you got too much and enjoyment out of the evening.

1109
01:05:31.101 --> 01:05:35.540
So basically the evening was,
it was really your evening.
It was real.
Look,

1110
01:05:35.570 --> 01:05:37.010
look at the fucking wedding day.

1111
01:05:38.330 --> 01:05:41.690
You standing up like an idiot and she makes this grand entrance.

1112
01:05:41.691 --> 01:05:43.990
She gets some one of a kind dress and you,

1113
01:05:43.991 --> 01:05:48.350
you get a Tuxedo that some fucking drunks going to wear at a 15 year anniversary

1114
01:05:48.351 --> 01:05:51.980
for a bowling alley the next fucking week.
You know what I mean?
All right,

1115
01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:57.060
let's listen to what the twats had to say to this week.
Um,
all right,
hit this,

1116
01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.550
this,
this,
this wonderful girl.

1117
01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:01.730
And I said she's wonderful because she actually admitted that she was a psycho

1118
01:06:01.731 --> 01:06:05.150
because I actually emailed her and asked her,
why do you only respond to male,

1119
01:06:05.151 --> 01:06:08.000
female shit?
And she sort of in her own little cute way,

1120
01:06:08.001 --> 01:06:10.460
admitted that she was a psycho,
so I can't hate her.
But anyways,

1121
01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:12.500
this is her email.
Hey Bill,

1122
01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:16.160
I love the clueless email questions from your male listeners.

1123
01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:17.900
That's always a great way,
by the way,

1124
01:06:17.901 --> 01:06:21.530
to get the other people to listen to what you have to say right out of the gate.

1125
01:06:21.531 --> 01:06:25.780
Just start insulting them and talking down to them.
Um,
he said,
uh,

1126
01:06:25.790 --> 01:06:30.650
the guy was asking why is it never enough to please a woman since he admit he,

1127
01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:33.410
um,
and then she's referring to his email.
He,
she says,

1128
01:06:33.411 --> 01:06:35.810
since he admits he isn't home a lot,

1129
01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:40.490
I'm guessing his wife slash girlfriend is doing all the dirty work for him,

1130
01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:45.620
his laundry,
cleaning,
cooking,
picking up after him,
et Cetera.
All right,

1131
01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:47.330
let's stop right there.

1132
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:51.860
She's doing all the dirty work.
Let me ask you guys a question.

1133
01:06:51.861 --> 01:06:55.070
Would you rather sit home doing laundry?
First of all,

1134
01:06:55.071 --> 01:06:58.100
laundry is the most overrated fucking chore ever.

1135
01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.890
If you have laundry in your fucking apartment,

1136
01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:04.190
w that takes all of a minute to load the fucking thing in,

1137
01:07:04.191 --> 01:07:05.420
and if you're not colorblind,

1138
01:07:05.450 --> 01:07:09.410
it probably takes 45 seconds to load it in and then you go back to watching the

1139
01:07:09.411 --> 01:07:13.940
prices,
right?
Cleaning,
cooking,
picking up after him.

1140
01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.670
I would rather do that than do what this other guy's doing.

1141
01:07:16.671 --> 01:07:21.590
This other guy is working like 60 hours a fucking week.
Okay,

1142
01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:24.650
well let's,
let's move it.
She's already made this assumption.
Okay?
Then she,

1143
01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:29.690
then she wants him to spend some time with him and he comes up with something

1144
01:07:29.691 --> 01:07:34.310
that he wanted to do.
Just like when you took your girl girlfriend on that drive.

1145
01:07:34.311 --> 01:07:37.970
All we heard about was the love story between you and the car.

1146
01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.460
You were more excited about the car than anything.

1147
01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:44.480
It was like you were on a date with the car and your girlfriend just came along

1148
01:07:44.481 --> 01:07:45.314
for the ride.

1149
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:49.220
Listen back to even the tone in your voice when you were talking about it.

1150
01:07:49.221 --> 01:07:54.040
It's like you were talking about another woman.
All right.
You know something.

1151
01:07:54.041 --> 01:07:58.750
I could sit around for 20 years trying to come up with the perfect paragraph to

1152
01:07:58.751 --> 01:08:03.290
talk how insanely jealous and psychotic women are.
Can you be,

1153
01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:08.200
they did jealous about an inanimate object.
She's talking about a car.

1154
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:12.130
It's almost like you were talking about another woman lady.

1155
01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.230
You are out of your fucking mind.

1156
01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:19.850
You're out of your fucking mind and you're totally ignoring the fact that I took

1157
01:08:19.851 --> 01:08:22.250
her out to dinner.
I took her out to lunch.

1158
01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:25.640
I took her up for a ride up to Pacific coast highway.

1159
01:08:25.641 --> 01:08:30.290
People fly out here as a vacation to do that.
A lot of couples do that.

1160
01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:32.990
And I'll tell you right now,
they don't do it in a corvette convertible.

1161
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:38.030
They do it in like a fucking whatever,
a Buick century.

1162
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:43.190
Really?
I mean,
it literally is never enough.

1163
01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:46.220
You're actually proving this guy point,
this guy's points that she says,

1164
01:08:46.221 --> 01:08:48.380
my husband does the same damn thing.
I'm like,

1165
01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:51.470
what can we do for fun today slash tonight?
And He,

1166
01:08:51.471 --> 01:08:56.010
the only thing he can come up with are things that interest him.
Well,

1167
01:08:56.011 --> 01:08:57.090
what can you come up with?

1168
01:08:57.091 --> 01:08:59.250
Can you come up with anything that doesn't interest yourself?

1169
01:08:59.251 --> 01:09:02.340
You're selfish cunt.
You're doing the exact same fucking thing.

1170
01:09:02.490 --> 01:09:07.260
And it's unbelievably selfish for you to sit here and,
and,
and have like a,

1171
01:09:07.261 --> 01:09:12.180
a day that's for both of you and it has to be 100% about you because what you

1172
01:09:12.181 --> 01:09:15.900
did,
some laundry,
you lazy.
Fuck your base.
You know what women are,

1173
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:19.260
they're basically,
they're like adult children.
That's what they are.

1174
01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:23.810
They never get beyond their,
like juveniles.
They're adults,

1175
01:09:23.811 --> 01:09:27.370
but they still want to be treated like they're not of age.
It's,

1176
01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:31.300
it's just fucking boggles my God damn mind.
Um,

1177
01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:34.300
she goes,
I'd rather not do anything at all.

1178
01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:39.360
I think it's Selfoss and Eggnog and obnoxious that everything we do has to have

1179
01:09:39.551 --> 01:09:41.380
his interests before mine.

1180
01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:46.540
So everything that they do should have your interests before his,

1181
01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:51.630
yeah,
he's fucking broad.
Sarah didn't see this is this is my thing.

1182
01:09:51.631 --> 01:09:54.930
This is why you should,
you should never get married.

1183
01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:56.940
You should never be in a fucking relationship.

1184
01:09:56.941 --> 01:10:01.941
You shouldn't because they just constantly fucking hack away,

1185
01:10:02.461 --> 01:10:03.930
itch a goddamn knees.

1186
01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:09.090
And their idea of a relationship is that you do everything that they want to do.

1187
01:10:09.690 --> 01:10:12.960
And right now they're sitting there shaking their heads.
They're going now.

1188
01:10:12.961 --> 01:10:15.000
Now even the girl wrote,
that's probably saying no.

1189
01:10:15.150 --> 01:10:18.210
And there's a bunch of other women going like,
I'm not like that.

1190
01:10:18.450 --> 01:10:20.730
I'm not like that.
I went to a ping pong convention.

1191
01:10:20.731 --> 01:10:23.070
They always come up with some stupid ass fucking example.

1192
01:10:23.250 --> 01:10:26.760
And at the end of the fucking day,
you have to do everything that they do.

1193
01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:30.840
The you have to do what the fuck they want to do or else they get mad.
Okay.

1194
01:10:30.841 --> 01:10:35.841
And that my friend is when jerking off comes into play because when you really

1195
01:10:36.631 --> 01:10:38.670
break it down,
what's the worst thing that they're going to do to you?

1196
01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:41.550
They're not going to fuck you for a few days.
Okay.

1197
01:10:41.551 --> 01:10:45.990
And I gotta be honest with you,
once you rub one out,
who gives a fuck?

1198
01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.400
And you have to have that clarity when you're nuts.
A full,

1199
01:10:51.450 --> 01:10:54.210
do you know what I mean?
Am I sounding like a fucking maniac here?
I know I am.

1200
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:58.920
I know I am.
But
you got,
you got to hear what the,
with this,
with this other,

1201
01:10:58.921 --> 01:10:59.940
this other woman wrote.

1202
01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:04.560
And of course I don't have it in front of me because I'm an idiot with a fuck.

1203
01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:07.070
It is.
All right.
Um,

1204
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:10.530
I am writing to comment on the wide is never enough discussion on your last

1205
01:11:10.531 --> 01:11:12.930
episode episode.
I'll start by saying that the,

1206
01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.530
that wrote in and to a slightly lesser extent,

1207
01:11:16.531 --> 01:11:18.960
you come off as total Douche is,

1208
01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:22.140
let me explain my view of the writers.

1209
01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:23.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1210
01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:27.550
<v 7>The writer's situation.
Oh,
I guess the guy who sent the email.
Uh,
and yes,</v>

1211
01:11:27.551 --> 01:11:32.320
I am one of those manipulatives,
selfish creatures known as women.
Um,

1212
01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:34.920
yeah,
you are what you call yourself out on it.

1213
01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:37.780
Now Suppose Oran was I supposed to like read that and be like,
wow,

1214
01:11:37.810 --> 01:11:39.550
I really am too harsh on women.

1215
01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:44.230
Say you're like trying to manipulate me with your fucking bullshit already.
Okay,

1216
01:11:44.231 --> 01:11:46.130
here we go.
Um,
I don't remember the names,

1217
01:11:46.131 --> 01:11:50.080
so I'll call him Bob and his wife Sally.
Bob Neglect.
Sally.

1218
01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:54.820
A huge fuck up on Bob's part.
Now let's,
let's get back to the,

1219
01:11:54.821 --> 01:11:58.420
to the detail here.
He's neglecting her.
What does he,

1220
01:11:58.421 --> 01:12:00.370
is he out at the bar chasing other women?

1221
01:12:00.371 --> 01:12:04.390
This guy is out working his fucking ass off.

1222
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:09.280
This is the thing that women don't understand.
What they don't understand is I,

1223
01:12:09.290 --> 01:12:12.350
this is maybe I'm being a moron again or a Douche as this lady says.

1224
01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:15.260
I think a lot of women don't understand what it takes to be successful.

1225
01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.600
What it takes is sacrifice.
And in your 20s,

1226
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:21.770
you have to work your fucking ass off.
That's what I did for five years.

1227
01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:25.730
If my first five years in this fucking business,
I had no girlfriend.

1228
01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:27.980
I had no social life,
a had nothing,

1229
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:31.580
all I was doing shows and and fucking rubbing one out.

1230
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:34.310
That's what the fuck I did.
Every God damn day I went to work,

1231
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:39.020
I was writing jokes at work and at night I got an a piece of shit car and I

1232
01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:41.780
would sometimes drive to another fucking state.

1233
01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:46.250
And you know why I had no girlfriend during that time because none of them could

1234
01:12:46.251 --> 01:12:49.880
understand what I had to do to get where I am today.

1235
01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:54.110
All of them were giving me shit.
You're doing standup again tonight.

1236
01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:59.900
Do you realize how many Richard Pryor's are fucking working at a home depot or

1237
01:12:59.901 --> 01:13:00.800
Jimi Hendrix?

1238
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:05.060
Because they hooked up with the wrong fucking Twat who talked him out of their

1239
01:13:05.061 --> 01:13:08.630
goddamn dream because they didn't want it.
They didn't want to hear it

1240
01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:12.500
because they said you needed some sort of responsibility.

1241
01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:16.400
This fucking guy is doing the right thing and she's calling him selfish.

1242
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:19.820
He's at work busting his ass trying to get ahead.

1243
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:22.520
So when he's 40 he's not a fucking loser.

1244
01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:25.040
And he has and they all want the fucking house.

1245
01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:26.660
They all wanted fucking yesterday,

1246
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:28.520
but they don't want to get through the bullshit of it.

1247
01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:31.760
They don't want to go through the bullshit of it where you actually have to uh,

1248
01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:36.260
not see him for a little while because he's out working.
So anyways,

1249
01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.400
huge fuck up on his fart part to be a busting his goddamn ass.

1250
01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:44.450
So he says Bob Decides to make it up to her by taking her to see your live show,

1251
01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:49.130
she says,
which is awesome.
And a dinner,
which is pretty standard.

1252
01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:55.360
This is how out of control women are.
She's getting a free fucking meal

1253
01:13:56.810 --> 01:14:01.810
and they're so spoiled as a sex that she's describes a free fucking meal as

1254
01:14:02.541 --> 01:14:03.560
standard.

1255
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:08.360
Do you know what I have to do as a man to get a free meal?

1256
01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:12.910
I have to like when like a fucking,
like a radio contest,

1257
01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:13.691
you know,

1258
01:14:13.691 --> 01:14:17.800
I got to call up this radio station and imitate the local sports guy and I have

1259
01:14:17.801 --> 01:14:20.020
to beat out all these other fucking guys who are,

1260
01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:24.550
I haven't had a free meal since I was like eight years old.

1261
01:14:24.551 --> 01:14:28.330
My parents took me to Mcdonald's or whatever,
like maybe 13,

1262
01:14:28.331 --> 01:14:33.331
14 women are so fucking spoiled that this guy is busting his ass at work that's

1263
01:14:35.441 --> 01:14:36.820
viewed as selfish.

1264
01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:41.020
He's buying this girl a free dinner and it's viewed as standard.

1265
01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:43.390
They're out of their fucking minds.
So anyway,
she goes,

1266
01:14:43.391 --> 01:14:48.391
Sally basically tells her friends who may or may not know that Bob has been

1267
01:14:48.461 --> 01:14:52.330
fucking up.
Once again,
Bob is fucking up because he's busting his acid work.

1268
01:14:52.450 --> 01:14:56.110
So when they're 40,
they're going to be uneasy street.
He's fucking up right now.

1269
01:14:56.490 --> 01:14:59.920
Um,
the same bitches who make your fucking,
you know,
not chase your dream,

1270
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:04.060
leave you when you're 38 because you're a fucking loser.
Right.
All right.

1271
01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:09.170
I love generalizing.
It really gets these twats cunt hairs in a fucking to,

1272
01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:11.230
I can't even finish that sentence.
That was so evil.
All right,

1273
01:15:11.231 --> 01:15:13.720
let's plan it's flower head.
Um,

1274
01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:19.780
who may or may not know that Bob has been fucking up that this night out is not

1275
01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:21.070
what she had in mind,

1276
01:15:21.490 --> 01:15:26.050
but she is taking what she can get playing the victim are the poor baby.

1277
01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.120
She's taking what?
She got a free meal.

1278
01:15:28.210 --> 01:15:32.080
She's just taken what she can get and she's getting a show to come out to my

1279
01:15:32.081 --> 01:15:36.370
show when of the best fucking comedians in the country.
You like Dad,

1280
01:15:36.371 --> 01:15:40.390
I'm talking shit.
It's football Sunday and I'm a plus.
I'm reading the ric Flair,

1281
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:44.170
the best comic on the biggest hill.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

1282
01:15:44.171 --> 01:15:48.820
Bob gets upset and determines that no one has ever or will ever be able to

1283
01:15:48.821 --> 01:15:53.350
please any female code for why should he even make an effort to make his wife

1284
01:15:53.351 --> 01:15:57.190
happy in their marriage?
That's not code for that.
That's how you read into it.

1285
01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:02.080
You've never met Bob.
You've made all kinds of assumptions here.
Poor,
poor Bob.

1286
01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:06.780
Bob's do.
Sherry becomes a crystal,
becomes crystal clear when he is,

1287
01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:10.930
when he says something to the effect of this whole night outs was supposed to be

1288
01:16:10.931 --> 01:16:12.610
about her.
This is a,

1289
01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:17.820
this is classic male privilege wankery but I realize this is hard for you and

1290
01:16:19.091 --> 01:16:23.860
Bob to see.
So I'm here to help.
Um,
I'll try to make it simple.

1291
01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:28.360
When you piss off your wife bringing her along to a show you already wanted to

1292
01:16:28.361 --> 01:16:31.900
go to and that she is only mildly interested in.

1293
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:37.110
Then being a little scroll them about it when she's is underwhelmed by the fact

1294
01:16:37.570 --> 01:16:40.390
that you are actually making an effort to go out with her,

1295
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:45.490
which is what you should have been doing as a matter of course is not the way to

1296
01:16:45.491 --> 01:16:48.340
go.
Oh my God.
I mean the arrogance in this,

1297
01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:51.790
I love people who are arrogant and the calling you out for being arrogant,

1298
01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:55.180
bringing to her to a show.
Do you understand like,

1299
01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:57.670
I'm going to stop being a jerk here because maybe I can actually convince a

1300
01:16:57.671 --> 01:17:00.790
couple of women,
do you understand what it takes?
This is what actually,
you know,

1301
01:17:00.791 --> 01:17:01.570
I've been generalizing,

1302
01:17:01.570 --> 01:17:06.570
there are women out there who understand what it takes to become successful and

1303
01:17:06.671 --> 01:17:10.310
I guarantee you most of them are not in relationships and they have a difficult

1304
01:17:10.311 --> 01:17:13.190
time being in relationships.
You know,

1305
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:17.180
because the guy that with wants to go home and play fucking footsie or once her

1306
01:17:17.181 --> 01:17:22.100
around and doesn't understand that these are the years where she has to bust her

1307
01:17:22.101 --> 01:17:25.100
ass to get where the fuck she's going to be.
You know?

1308
01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:30.500
So Lady,
both of you guys are a hundred percent wrong.

1309
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:33.350
I could see if this guy was out drinking with his buddies,

1310
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:37.850
if this guy was out fucking around on her or if he was just sitting there

1311
01:17:37.851 --> 01:17:41.300
staring at the TV watching football and not paying attention to her when he

1312
01:17:41.301 --> 01:17:42.440
brings her out.
Yeah.

1313
01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:46.790
Then I could see that he should have some sort of mini all about your wedding

1314
01:17:46.791 --> 01:17:49.340
day for her.
Okay.

1315
01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:52.910
But if this guy is busting his ass at fucking work,
okay,

1316
01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:54.950
he's not going out having a good time either.

1317
01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:58.250
So he should be allowed to have some sort of enjoyment.

1318
01:17:59.810 --> 01:18:02.270
You don't understand.
He should be able to enjoy some of the day,

1319
01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:05.720
some of the night also,
and this is nothing that you haven't even brought up.

1320
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:07.790
How much of the rent do you think he's fucking pain?

1321
01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:12.070
I'd be willing to bet that he's paying more than she is.

1322
01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:15.460
A lot of guys are in that situation too.
When you get this,

1323
01:18:15.670 --> 01:18:19.930
the adult child version of a fucking woman,
I'm telling you,

1324
01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:24.190
you women,
I'm telling you the two who wrote in your way out of line on this one.

1325
01:18:24.191 --> 01:18:27.820
I'm not even trying to be funny right now.
You're 100% in the fucking wrong here.

1326
01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:32.740
You're being selfish beyond fucking selfish.
This guy is at work.

1327
01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:34.720
He's busting his ass trying to get ahead.

1328
01:18:34.721 --> 01:18:38.230
Do you think this guy wants to fucking work 60 hours a week?

1329
01:18:38.770 --> 01:18:41.380
Nobody dreams about doing that.
Why do you think he's doing that?

1330
01:18:41.381 --> 01:18:44.940
He's trying to become successful,
you know,

1331
01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:48.630
so the next time you're gay,
you know,
I like I said,

1332
01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:52.110
if this guy had been fucking around or if this guy had been sitting there

1333
01:18:52.111 --> 01:18:52.890
watching you know,

1334
01:18:52.890 --> 01:18:56.790
sports and not paying attention to you and hadn't given you a compliment since

1335
01:18:56.791 --> 01:19:00.330
you could fucking remember.
Yeah,
then I could understand,
you know what I mean?

1336
01:19:00.331 --> 01:19:02.850
Taking you to the whatever the fuck you want it to go to,

1337
01:19:03.090 --> 01:19:07.320
but for you to sit there and this guy spends is harder and fucking money takes

1338
01:19:07.321 --> 01:19:09.540
you out to dinner.
Okay.

1339
01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:14.550
Which you got to understand is not standard.
Okay.

1340
01:19:14.551 --> 01:19:15.150
In your home.

1341
01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:18.720
How fucking spoiled to you that you think that that is stick is standard.

1342
01:19:18.721 --> 01:19:22.710
I got the fucking hiccups here.
I'm so God damn upset.
Um,
you guys are,

1343
01:19:22.711 --> 01:19:23.820
you guys are 100% wrong.

1344
01:19:23.821 --> 01:19:26.640
And if any you broads out there one on one to try to come out and support these

1345
01:19:26.641 --> 01:19:30.630
two girls.
I mean go for it because I don't see how they're wrong.

1346
01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:35.500
This guy did nothing wrong.
He took her out to go see a show.
It's just,
you know,

1347
01:19:35.501 --> 01:19:37.620
what is stand up.
Comedy is not respected.

1348
01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:43.040
It isn't if he took you out to see a Broadway show or a fucking musical or are,

1349
01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.480
I guess that's the same thing.
I Dunno what,

1350
01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:48.630
I guess if he took you out for dinner and a movie.
I love [inaudible] like,

1351
01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:53.580
like guys always have to show some sort of imagination.
It's standard.

1352
01:19:53.581 --> 01:19:56.700
It was just imagination.
We like the prizes and it's like,

1353
01:19:56.820 --> 01:20:00.570
when was the last time your girl actually showed any fucking imagination when

1354
01:20:00.571 --> 01:20:03.630
they got you a shirt,
you know,

1355
01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:08.130
or some sports DVD you did they

1356
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:11.010
<v 5>ever really show any sort of fucking imagination?</v>

1357
01:20:11.011 --> 01:20:12.090
I'll tell you what does my girl,

1358
01:20:12.091 --> 01:20:17.091
she actually showed some imagination one year when I first met her,

1359
01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:21.090
I uh,
I was playing drums,
you know,

1360
01:20:22.170 --> 01:20:23.160
she knew I was in a drum.

1361
01:20:23.161 --> 01:20:26.000
She knew I loved them and she actually got me this pair of drum.

1362
01:20:26.001 --> 01:20:28.590
So you gave me a pair of drum sticks and we don't even go on off for like a

1363
01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:30.930
month.
So there was like that thing,
you can't get a really huge gift,

1364
01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:34.860
but you got to get him some.
She got me a pair of drum sticks and she had my,

1365
01:20:34.890 --> 01:20:39.300
my initials engraved in them.
I never even used them.
I thought it was really,

1366
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:41.670
it was unique.
It was loving it.

1367
01:20:41.671 --> 01:20:44.310
We didn't know and it didn't cost that much money and it was totally fucking

1368
01:20:44.311 --> 01:20:48.510
cool.
I wouldn't be like,
well,
you know,
that's,
you got to do that every birthday.

1369
01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:52.800
You know,
surprise me like you did with the drum sticks at sects.

1370
01:20:52.801 --> 01:20:57.600
Spend a ton of fucking money to,
you know,
I didn't know if that even fucking,

1371
01:20:57.601 --> 01:20:59.940
I think I started to make one point and then I made another one in that one.

1372
01:20:59.941 --> 01:21:02.570
I'm so fucking annoyed by these.
These women did,
and they're there.

1373
01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:06.060
They're out of their fucking minds.
You're out of your fucking minds.

1374
01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:07.973
Okay?

1375
01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:11.220
If the guy who wrote that email last week don't listen to these fucking twats,

1376
01:21:11.221 --> 01:21:14.310
all right,
you bought,
you're out there,
you're busting your goddamn ass.

1377
01:21:14.311 --> 01:21:18.870
You have to sit down and you have to explain to your wife or your girlfriend or

1378
01:21:18.871 --> 01:21:20.100
whatever the fuck she is,

1379
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:22.920
what it takes to become successful because I'm telling you,

1380
01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.290
you understand what it is you're doing,

1381
01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:30.240
what everybody else did in their 20s all those people out there,

1382
01:21:30.241 --> 01:21:33.660
you know the broads with the tramp stamps and the guys with the tribal band

1383
01:21:33.661 --> 01:21:37.740
tattoo who are out there doing keg stands and fucking everything that moves,

1384
01:21:37.741 --> 01:21:40.950
doing their best to catch herpes every fucking weekend.
Those people,

1385
01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:44.850
they wonder what happens when they're getting their thirties and forties they

1386
01:21:44.851 --> 01:21:47.610
wonder what the fuck happened.
You know?

1387
01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:51.190
And they're looking at you like you're a shithead.
You know?
Now the payoff is,

1388
01:21:51.191 --> 01:21:54.780
is usually when you become successful,
you end up running a corvette at 41

1389
01:21:58.970 --> 01:22:03.480
having sort of a mini midlife crisis.
But I'm telling you,

1390
01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:07.680
I'd rather be me than those other fucking dudes.
I really would.

1391
01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:12.920
So you really need to explain to this woman who looks at you busting your ass as

1392
01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:17.220
neglect,
as,
as being selfish.

1393
01:22:17.970 --> 01:22:20.390
It's just beyond me.
It's fucking beyond.

1394
01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:25.290
You're doing what you're supposed to be doing as a man is a man is supposed to

1395
01:22:25.291 --> 01:22:27.930
work and he's supposed to provide for his family.

1396
01:22:28.050 --> 01:22:33.050
And what you are doing is you are laying the groundwork for you to do that as

1397
01:22:33.601 --> 01:22:37.050
best as you possibly can.
And for someone to say that that is selfish,

1398
01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:41.130
it's just fucking beyond me.
Okay.
Let me ask you this.

1399
01:22:41.131 --> 01:22:43.200
When you went out that night,
how fucking tired were you?

1400
01:22:43.201 --> 01:22:47.580
How many times did you yawn from working all fucking week?
You know what I mean?

1401
01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:53.500
You know,
aren't you allowed to go out and have a good time with your girlfriend,

1402
01:22:53.710 --> 01:22:56.700
with a little bit of Shit that she enjoys?
A little bit of stuff that,

1403
01:22:56.701 --> 01:22:59.890
that you enjoy?
Isn't that like a fucking relationship?
I mean,

1404
01:22:59.891 --> 01:23:03.900
am I out of my fucking mind here
anyways?

1405
01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:07.930
Um,
this is really just to become a,
uh,
a woman bashing thing.

1406
01:23:07.931 --> 01:23:11.140
This is really just fucking tapped into.
This is another email I got bill.
This,

1407
01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:15.700
this got me so pissed off and I swear the first thing that came to my mind was

1408
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:20.020
wait till bill,
here's this shit.
Um,
I guess I listened to your show too much.

1409
01:23:20.021 --> 01:23:21.040
So here's the story.
He goes,

1410
01:23:21.041 --> 01:23:23.590
I went on my lunch break with the female coworker today,

1411
01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:28.690
and the true mind of a female really shined.
I'm telling you a women,

1412
01:23:28.691 --> 01:23:29.880
you really got to chime in here and,

1413
01:23:29.881 --> 01:23:33.040
and trash guys because this is really becoming,
this is like,

1414
01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:37.260
like the guys this week or Stanford and women are fucking USC.
But uh,

1415
01:23:38.230 --> 01:23:41.680
whatever,
watch Oprah.
You always went on that show.
Here we go.
Uh,
first off,

1416
01:23:41.681 --> 01:23:45.130
I'm not interested in this female.
Uh,
we are just friends.
We have,

1417
01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:49.600
we've even talked about this and I've explained to her and we agree.

1418
01:23:49.601 --> 01:23:52.480
Nothing is happening there.
No problem.
Uh,

1419
01:23:52.481 --> 01:23:56.890
so we go out to get a sandwich and her ATM account is frozen.

1420
01:23:57.850 --> 01:24:01.330
She calls the bank and they think something's wrong and won't give her the money

1421
01:24:01.630 --> 01:24:06.460
to they talk tomorrow.
Right there.
Fuck the banks.
Right,
exactly.

1422
01:24:06.461 --> 01:24:10.540
You can't even get your own fucking money.
Um,
provided she's not overdrawn.

1423
01:24:10.690 --> 01:24:13.750
So here we go.
So he goes,
I would have lent her the cash,
but I was broke.

1424
01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:17.140
I offered to give her all the money,
all the money in my pocket,

1425
01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:22.150
about $2 and 50 cents in pocket change that would at least bought her a coffee.

1426
01:24:23.230 --> 01:24:26.920
I already paid for my sandwich,
uh,
when we found out about the ATM.

1427
01:24:26.921 --> 01:24:28.270
So she turns down that,

1428
01:24:28.450 --> 01:24:32.980
but asked me to drive her a few blocks to go to the bank and I happily do,
um,

1429
01:24:32.981 --> 01:24:35.800
that doesn't work and we have to go back to work.

1430
01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:38.140
This is all during your lunch hour.
Um,

1431
01:24:38.141 --> 01:24:42.940
she asked me to borrow a credit card,
is something to get food.
I don't have any.

1432
01:24:42.941 --> 01:24:47.590
So she can't.
So she calls back the job in the ass.
Another guy for five bucks.

1433
01:24:47.770 --> 01:24:51.640
He says,
yes.
Uh,
she then asked me for the two 50.

1434
01:24:51.641 --> 01:24:53.770
She turned down before.
I said,
sure,

1435
01:24:54.250 --> 01:24:58.540
now here is the fucking kicker.
So now this girl has seven 50.

1436
01:24:58.690 --> 01:25:02.740
She then tells me word for word.
Well,
since I got five bucks,

1437
01:25:02.741 --> 01:25:04.540
now let me tell you something.

1438
01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:08.830
And with this fake grin on her face trying to soften the blow,

1439
01:25:08.831 --> 01:25:13.180
actually she wasn't.
She's going into cut mode here.
She goes,
uh,

1440
01:25:13.210 --> 01:25:16.840
if you were in this jam,
I would have offered you half of my sandwich.

1441
01:25:16.841 --> 01:25:21.400
But that's okay.
I'm just saying.
And the guy said,
I was floored.

1442
01:25:21.401 --> 01:25:23.350
I was like,
Yo,
first off,

1443
01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:27.820
you only said this after you got the money because you knew how it might make me

1444
01:25:27.821 --> 01:25:31.810
feel and now you have my money and don't need my sandwich.

1445
01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:35.410
So basically you just wanted to make me feel shitty for not living up to your

1446
01:25:35.411 --> 01:25:39.160
standard of friendship.
She laughed it off and said,
uh,

1447
01:25:39.161 --> 01:25:42.970
she was trying to offend me.
She wasn't trying to friend me and let it go.

1448
01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:45.100
Bullshit.
You called her out on her shit.

1449
01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:48.100
Notice how she waited till she got your two 50,

1450
01:25:48.490 --> 01:25:51.220
and then did the little s fucking two point reversal on you.

1451
01:25:51.670 --> 01:25:55.570
Then she brings it up again and now I realize she was really bothered by the

1452
01:25:55.571 --> 01:25:59.530
fact I didn't offer the sandwich I bought with my last five bucks to my name.

1453
01:25:59.830 --> 01:26:03.930
Meanwhile,
she,
uh,
she has 400 bucks in the,
uh,

1454
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:06.920
they just won't give it to her tomorrow.
She will be fine.

1455
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:10.750
I will still be broke yet she still thinks I should have given her half of the

1456
01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:14.150
last sandwich I can for a week till I get paid.

1457
01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:19.280
And the thing that gets me the most is we work a labor job.

1458
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:23.330
I'm always helping her lift and move things because she herself brings up the

1459
01:26:23.331 --> 01:26:28.240
point.
She is a girl,
yet she talks all the time about how men and women are,
um,

1460
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:31.250
are equal in the workplace and she should be treated the same.

1461
01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:35.390
And this isn't some dumb cunt.
She went to school for four years,
got a degree,

1462
01:26:35.391 --> 01:26:38.270
changed your mind and now she's going back to get another degree.

1463
01:26:38.271 --> 01:26:42.170
They will take her six more year years.
She reads and studies all day.

1464
01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:46.070
And I enjoy your conversations because she's smart.
But at the end of the day,

1465
01:26:46.071 --> 01:26:50.510
I have learned she's still a woman and she still feels she should somehow be

1466
01:26:50.511 --> 01:26:54.830
baby by other men simply because she is a woman.
I'm not sleeping with her.

1467
01:26:54.831 --> 01:26:57.980
We had just friends.
Why do you feel entitled to half of my last,

1468
01:26:58.430 --> 01:27:01.820
even if after I go out of my way,
um,

1469
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:03.470
oh half of my sandwich.

1470
01:27:03.710 --> 01:27:07.910
Even if after I go out of my way every way I can to help you.
Exactly.

1471
01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:11.810
You went,
you gave her every last cent in your fucking pants.

1472
01:27:11.811 --> 01:27:14.120
You drove her down to the bank,
you drove her back to work.

1473
01:27:14.121 --> 01:27:16.010
This was all during your fucking lunch hour.

1474
01:27:16.011 --> 01:27:20.690
You're lifting her boxes and all that type of shit.
I mean,
I dunno.

1475
01:27:22.130 --> 01:27:22.821
I Dunno what to tell you.

1476
01:27:22.821 --> 01:27:25.240
I mean maybe you could have given her half your fucking sandwich.
I haven't,

1477
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:28.580
I don't know what your relationship is with her,
but that's the classic,

1478
01:27:29.690 --> 01:27:34.160
you know,
I could see if she got the $5 out of the other guy,

1479
01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:39.560
you know and didn't take your two 50 but she gets to five and then takes you to

1480
01:27:39.561 --> 01:27:43.430
50 and then brings it up.
You know what I mean?

1481
01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:47.510
I'm telling you dude.
Right.
Then like I like if someone did that to me,

1482
01:27:47.511 --> 01:27:49.820
I would be done with them.
I will be done with them.

1483
01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:52.610
I wouldn't tell him that it would be done with them.
What I would do,

1484
01:27:52.730 --> 01:27:56.490
it was I would wait for the next time she needed me to lift something.
Um,

1485
01:27:56.540 --> 01:28:01.070
I would do a country smile back to her and be like,
you know,
if I was asking you,

1486
01:28:01.071 --> 01:28:04.250
I would make sure that I would live half the box with me,
you know,

1487
01:28:04.251 --> 01:28:09.110
or whatever the fuck you want to say.
Um,
anyways.
And he said,

1488
01:28:09.111 --> 01:28:13.970
thanks for letting me vent.
Signed the Jewish dude.

1489
01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:21.680
Um,
all right,
let's see here.
I think that might be it.
That's it,
right?

1490
01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:25.850
I think that is it.
That is it for the podcast.
All right,
well let me say it.

1491
01:28:25.851 --> 01:28:30.120
Let me state for the record here.
Um,
I dunno,

1492
01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:33.350
after the second time reading that maybe you could have given her half you San

1493
01:28:33.351 --> 01:28:37.490
or party his sandwich offered her a bite,
but uh,
you know,

1494
01:28:37.491 --> 01:28:40.580
you spent all your fucking money,
then she finds out she's fucking broke.

1495
01:28:40.670 --> 01:28:44.390
But that is the typical female fucking thing.
Okay.
Where are equal Rico?

1496
01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:48.470
Rescue me,
rescue me.
We're equal.
We're equal.
Rescue me.
They basically,

1497
01:28:48.650 --> 01:28:51.560
they ride that fence.
Okay.

1498
01:28:51.650 --> 01:28:56.650
And what most of them do is when it's a good thing to be equal,

1499
01:28:56.781 --> 01:29:00.890
then your equal.
And when it's a bad thing to be equal,
like you know,

1500
01:29:00.891 --> 01:29:02.010
I to pick up something

1501
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:05.850
<v 7>heavy then,
then it's like,
oh,
I'm just a girl,
you know,</v>

1502
01:29:05.851 --> 01:29:09.720
or dinner comes along and the check comes along.
Then I'm a female.

1503
01:29:09.721 --> 01:29:14.400
He should be a gentleman.
I did a bit about this a long fucking time ago.
Um,

1504
01:29:14.401 --> 01:29:17.450
so basically they can't hit,
I mean,
what are they doing that's wrong there?

1505
01:29:17.451 --> 01:29:21.000
They're just trying to manipulate the situation to their advantage.

1506
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:22.380
All you have to do as a guy,

1507
01:29:22.381 --> 01:29:25.740
just be conscious of it and call them out on this shit.

1508
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:30.980
Um,
you should have asked for you to 50 back when she said no.

1509
01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:33.170
He should have demonstrated your strength as a man.

1510
01:29:33.171 --> 01:29:37.460
Tipped her upside down and shook it out of her.
Um,

1511
01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:41.390
that's it.
That's it for the Monday morning podcast.
That was kind of dark.

1512
01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:45.620
That was kind of evil is kind of ugly and I anticipate a lot of emails,
but,
uh,

1513
01:29:45.621 --> 01:29:50.150
that's how the podcast goes sometimes.
And,
uh,
I know it wasn't on a cell phone,

1514
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:53.210
but a go fuck yourself.
That's how I'm doing them.

1515
01:29:53.211 --> 01:29:55.400
That's how I'm going to continue doing them.
If you don't like it,

1516
01:29:55.401 --> 01:30:00.050
fucking go listen to the old ones.
Go listen to the old bunch of pricks.
Um,

1517
01:30:00.051 --> 01:30:03.710
this week I'm going to be at the Improv in Tempe,
Arizona.
All right.

1518
01:30:03.711 --> 01:30:08.090
I'm going to be there on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday.
And uh,

1519
01:30:08.091 --> 01:30:10.190
there's been a little switcheroo on my schedule.

1520
01:30:10.191 --> 01:30:12.140
I was supposed to be going to Seattle.

1521
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:17.200
I was supposed to be going to Seattle to play giggles comedy club,

1522
01:30:17.201 --> 01:30:20.860
but I'm unfortunately that comedy club does not advertise.

1523
01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:26.380
So the only way I sell tickets is to go on this one particular radio show and

1524
01:30:26.381 --> 01:30:29.350
they changed the format and got rid of my hookup up there.

1525
01:30:29.351 --> 01:30:33.280
So there's no way for me to go into town to lend anybody know that I'm going to

1526
01:30:33.281 --> 01:30:37.060
be there.
So the club owner would just lose a ton of fucking money.

1527
01:30:37.061 --> 01:30:41.140
So like a class guy,
I switched out the date.
Okay.

1528
01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:44.920
So basically I think I'm going to be maybe doing Seattle in January.

1529
01:30:45.310 --> 01:30:48.220
So instead of going to a giggles in Seattle,

1530
01:30:48.221 --> 01:30:52.910
I will be at the punchline in Sacramento,
California,
uh,

1531
01:30:52.930 --> 01:30:57.070
punchlines Sacramento,
