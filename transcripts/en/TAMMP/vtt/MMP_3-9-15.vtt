1
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:01.900
Okay.

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.890
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on is bill bird,
it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.040
March 9th,
2015 how's it going?

4
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.200
How I,
yeah.
Um,
oh,

5
00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:17.740
Billy bloodbath was fucking sick as a god damn dog.

6
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.600
I think all of the world travel caught up to me.
I had a sore throat.

7
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.270
I think I got a bad case of fucking,

8
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.110
you know,
I was over there in Southeast Asia.
You know what I mean?

9
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.380
You got to love the Asians.
The second they start getting sick,
what do they do?

10
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.460
They walk around coughing all over everybody like they do here in America.

11
00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:42.820
Fuck No.
They go on and they get themselves a surgical mask.

12
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.470
God knows they're so goddamn smart.
Half of them are probably in medical school,

13
00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:52.090
so they probably get them free of charge.
But still it's still consider it.

14
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.240
Right.
I Dunno.

15
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.370
Maybe I fucking walked by somebody over there that wasn't wearing one.

16
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.120
Who should've been with like the one inconsiderate person in Hong Kong or

17
00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:03.250
Singapore or something.
All like there.

18
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
You know what the reality was as I went through all

19
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.530
Jesus.
And this is like the best I've felt in three days.

20
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.280
And I know what you guys are gonna say.
Oh,
you know what it is,
Bill,

21
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.020
it's just cigars.
Well fuck.
Yo.

22
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.730
<v 1>I don't need to hear from you.</v>

24
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.430
Leonard Nimoy sent a tweet on his fucking death bed that changed my world.

25
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.510
Alright.
Um,
I'm done.
What the fuck?
I'm not done with them,
but I'm done with them.

26
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.490
All right.
I haven't smoked in
two weeks.

27
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.410
Oh yeah.
Why are you being so cunty?
All right,
it's good.
That's good for me.

28
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.110
It's good for me.
You know,

29
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.680
two weeks without a stove.
16 days I've gone and uh,

30
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.900
I'm good man.
I'm not going to smoke one until I do that.
The bus tour,

31
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:59.330
when I go down south,
man,
go down there fucking swamp.

32
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.130
Playful,
right down there.
Where do they do?
Well?
They're down there.

33
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.000
Wrassling and owl.
Gay.
Your
boy,
what you doing?

34
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.510
I see what you're doing.
And it was rhetorical question,

35
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:15.780
why don't you go wait out into the swamp and see what you can catch with your

36
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:16.614
foot?

37
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.940
Drag it back on the beach and I'll shoot it with shotgun mom over there throwing

38
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:24.180
a pot.
What do you think?
Huh?
What do you think?

39
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.813
<v 0>Thank you.</v>

40
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.710
<v 1>That little skit was called the other white people.
You know what I mean?</v>

41
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.210
When they're always trying to act like white people,
all evil running banks,

42
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.103
you know,

43
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.110
just remember some of them are in swamps shooting varmints so they can eat that

44
00:02:43.241 --> 00:02:47.770
night.
That's what I learned this week when I just sat,
I sat in bed,

45
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.800
I laid in bed for fucking Thursday right through to yesterday.

46
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.420
Sunday I just stayed in bed.
I fucking canceled everything.

47
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.160
I was just,

48
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.720
<v 2>you know,
cancelled shows,
you know,
I was supposed to go on a picnic.</v>

49
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.970
I said,
I can't do that.
You know,

50
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.450
which really upset things because not only was I bringing the basket,

51
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:14.140
I was also bringing a tablecloth.
So my apologies.

52
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.980
I'm kidding.
Come in and have a picnic.
You know what,

53
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:20.290
I'm thinking of a picnic because I,
I,
I,
uh,

54
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.900
<v 3>okay.</v>

55
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.230
<v 2>I saw this thing with Louis Vuitton makes they actually make this fucking little</v>

56
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.790
bar.
There's portable bar.
This when you know,
you're opposed.

57
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.240
How'd you know your wife's looking at some fucking,

58
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.200
you know,
whatever the fuck they look at in those stores and you're like,

59
00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:40.680
just thumbing through the catalog.
Go and look at this overpriced bullshit.
Right?

60
00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:41.940
Then all of a sudden you go,
oh wait a minute,

61
00:03:41.941 --> 00:03:44.580
they get a bar and you can bring it with you.

62
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.650
Like that's like some old school shit before mothers against drinking and

63
00:03:49.651 --> 00:03:52.620
driving before drinking a driver was even a problem.
First of all,

64
00:03:52.621 --> 00:03:57.480
back in the day,
it's like how many people live in add cars?
Right.
You know,

65
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.370
it's barely any fucking roads and they were all pretty much straight.

66
00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:06.030
Went right from the farmhouse,
right to downtown.
Right.
There wasn't a problem.

67
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.970
You made your booze at home anyways,

68
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:12.920
right in your bathtub there where it wasn't a problem.
So that was the thing.

69
00:04:12.921 --> 00:04:16.260
He had to bring your boots from home over to somebody else's that I had just,

70
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.890
I dunno,
I ain't what the fuck I'm talking about.

71
00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:21.470
But I laid in bed for a,

72
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.330
um,
I dunno if Thursday,
Friday,

73
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.330
Saturday and writing to Sunday and I watched a bunch of sports and I watched a

74
00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:33.560
bunch of fucking movies

75
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.030
all from like the middle of the movie.

76
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.140
Like I saw the middle of this Seth Rogen neighbors movie.

77
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.450
I saw that just about right after they had moved the kids and moved in until the

78
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:57.160
end of the movie.
Then I flipped over.
I kept missing like the first 20 minutes,

79
00:04:57.161 --> 00:05:00.790
every movie I saw the Vince Vaughn all in Wilson.

80
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.840
I don't know what happened.
Somehow they ended up at this computer company.

81
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.370
<v 3>Okay.</v>

82
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.790
<v 2>I saw that one.
Uh,
oh.
And then I watched that whole fucking,</v>

83
00:05:10.791 --> 00:05:15.110
that Robert Darce jinxed.
Does anybody even watching that spot?

84
00:05:15.111 --> 00:05:17.390
This fucking rich dude,
right?

85
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.770
This rich fella who,
uh,

86
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.500
he's just jinxed like everywhere he goes,

87
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.890
like somebody dies.

88
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.480
It's like murder she wrote,
except this person's always the suspect.

89
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.330
That was like the old joke with like murder.
She wrote,

90
00:05:35.331 --> 00:05:37.910
like everywhere that woman went,
there was always a murder,

91
00:05:37.911 --> 00:05:39.920
but she was never a suspect.
Well this guy,

92
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.940
everywhere he went there was a murder and he was always the suspect.

93
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.240
I mean there's poor bastard,
you know,

94
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.040
somebody was always getting murdered in his vicinity.

95
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.480
<v 3>Okay.</v>

96
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.570
<v 2>And they kept trying to pin it on him and they couldn't do it.</v>

97
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.760
Like his first wife,
his first wife,

98
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.500
he said I took her down to the train station and that's the last time I ever
saw.

99
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.850
<v 3>Okay.</v>

100
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.750
<v 2>That was like 30 years ago.
They never were able to pin that on him.</v>

101
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.250
He had some broad out in Cali living in la.

102
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.760
Uh,
they have them in the state of California,

103
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.710
but he flew into northern California way up north,
like near Eureka.

104
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.240
And so all they can do is put them in the state,
which is like saying,
you know,

105
00:06:27.241 --> 00:06:31.290
there was a murder in South Carolina.
Uh,
yeah,
well I was in Massachusetts.

106
00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:35.160
I mean that's how long the fucking state is.
And then the last one was a,

107
00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:39.330
he had a tenant and that one he actually admitted to killing,

108
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.410
but he said it was a self defense and he chopped up the body cause he didn't

109
00:06:43.411 --> 00:06:44.860
think anybody was going to believe him.

110
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.410
You got to see this thing and just the way the guy talks.

111
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.760
<v 3>Okay.</v>

112
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.710
<v 2>He sounds like the guy who does the voiceover on the Cadbury egg egg
commercials,</v>

113
00:06:55.711 --> 00:07:00.240
you know,
cause when he's gone,

114
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.020
they're gone.
He sounded just like that.
Like he would just be going like,

115
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.880
I never knowingly lied.
I never,

116
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.730
I never purposely,

117
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.980
I never purposely lied about anything.

118
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.500
I mean telling the whole truth.
I mean,
nobody tells the whole truth,

119
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:27.180
but I never allied.
I mean sure it did.
I leave things out.

120
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.810
You know,
you asked your skin if I leave this out

121
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.080
because it won't be not the truth.

122
00:07:38.081 --> 00:07:38.914
But

123
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.110
if I'm worried of how it will be interpreted that it could actually hurt me,

124
00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:45.610
then yes,
you leave it out.

125
00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:49.840
But I never purposely knowingly lied.

126
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.520
You gotta see this guy again.
The more you watch the show,
I mean,

127
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.740
right off the bat you're like,
this fucking guy did this shit.

128
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.920
And the more you watch it,
you're just like,
you don't go in the other direction.

129
00:07:59.921 --> 00:08:04.390
You're like this guy,
this guy really did this shit.
This guy without a doubt.

130
00:08:04.391 --> 00:08:08.170
The how is this Guy Walking?
Oh,
that's right.
He sees filthy,
stinking rich.

131
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.600
I watched that and I watched fucking people down in a swamp shooting gators,

132
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.200
ms kid,
all nervous wanting to rassle is first alligator.

133
00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:18.490
And I thought it was like Jesus Christ,

134
00:08:18.491 --> 00:08:20.290
he's going to get in the water with this fucking thing.

135
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.220
And all it meant was when they got one on the line trying to pull it into the

136
00:08:24.221 --> 00:08:26.230
boat without having that thing pull you over,

137
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.310
pull yonder while your uncle sits there with the shotgun going,

138
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.280
hold him still and they fucking blow his head off.

139
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:35.450
<v 3>Okay,</v>

140
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.350
<v 2>well what do you do with it?
And I,
you just sitting there like,</v>

141
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.810
you got to shoot an alligator in the face.
I mean,

142
00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:42.360
you gotta think like his belly alone.

143
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:43.940
<v 3>Okay.</v>

144
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.360
<v 2>You get those large scales of some shoes.
I mean there's pimps out there,</v>

145
00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:50.630
they'll pay 12 grand a pair.
Right.

146
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.850
Walk it over to Tom.
Um,
[inaudible]

147
00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:02.290
I never knowingly,
I'm rolling.
I'm gonna use that with my wife one time.
Right

148
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.500
when she sits that giving me shit about something,
you know,
he's touching,

149
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.420
it'd be home at he,
it's four in the morning,
eh?
Hell,
this show,
it'd be like,
look,

150
00:09:13.421 --> 00:09:18.421
I never purposely knowingly lied about when I was going to come home to you.

151
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.940
Did I leave out some of the truths about buying the last 14 rounds?

152
00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.340
I mean,
nobody tells the whole truth.

153
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.453
<v 4>MMM.</v>

154
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:35.050
<v 2>Anyways,
so,
uh,
what else did I watch?
I watched Carolina.
Duke.</v>

155
00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:36.310
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

156
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.250
<v 2>Dave,
you,</v>

157
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:43.130
they go up or I watch that shit and just sat there enjoying that rivalry.

158
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:48.310
And whenever I watched Duke Carolina or any big like college football game,

159
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.360
does anybody else like this?
Like don't you,
did you ever just wish like,
man,

160
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.570
I wish I studied.
You know,

161
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:03.640
I wish I studied in high school and actually got into a good college so I could

162
00:10:03.641 --> 00:10:07.880
follow a fucking,
you know,
it's a college I went to.

163
00:10:07.881 --> 00:10:10.520
I had no fucking sports programs.
There was no way to follow.

164
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.450
It's no way to follow.
What do I do?
You know what I mean?

165
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:16.340
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

166
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:21.340
<v 2>You fucking go to Ohio state like any fucking mouth breathe and jerk off in,</v>

167
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.780
in,
in this state of Ohio.
It's a fucking state school.

168
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:31.670
You can get in there,
university in Michigan.
Just to be fair with that rivalry,

169
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.671
if you,

170
00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:37.671
if you could be living in a Goddamn fucking cow patch on the upper peninsula of

171
00:10:38.691 --> 00:10:43.670
Michigan,
you can go to the University of Michigan.
All you gotta do is add a,

172
00:10:43.671 --> 00:10:47.840
know what you gotta do fucking,
you know,
have like a fucking B minus average.

173
00:10:47.841 --> 00:10:52.841
Maybe they'd come stumbling on that campus campus with your fucking a blue and

174
00:10:54.891 --> 00:10:57.270
maize Poncho when you're in the game.

175
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.820
<v 4>Okay.</v>

176
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.300
<v 2>Yeah.
Little bus city.
They got there.
There's fucking campus is so big.</v>

177
00:11:02.301 --> 00:11:06.380
They got buses and shit.
They got all these fucking schools.
Well,

178
00:11:06.381 --> 00:11:10.670
you don't even have to be that smart to get into like USC.
There's another one.

179
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.880
You just show up with a tan line.

180
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:18.750
You get in at the school and then for the rest of your fucking life you get
this.

181
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.940
You get to kind of still be connected and root for the old team,
you know,

182
00:11:22.941 --> 00:11:26.810
put on your raccoons fucking floor length coat.

183
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:28.530
<v 4>Okay,</v>

184
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.530
<v 2>Rah Rah sis boom bar,
right?
23 Skidoo,</v>

185
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.350
whatever the fuck they do call a statue of Liberty play.

186
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.260
You get to fucking hang in there
fucking,

187
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.260
what the hell was I thinking?
Why didn't I stay?

188
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.930
I never purposely

189
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:50.420
didn't study or lie to my teachers.

190
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.000
I'm no fucking kills me.

191
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.380
Kills me that my adopted school is Lsu.
Right?

192
00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.000
Like that's,
that's one of those schools that like,
you know,

193
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.450
basically if you just have teeth,
they're going to let you in.

194
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.620
If you're in fucking Louisiana and you know,

195
00:12:09.621 --> 00:12:11.210
I know this is offending a lot of people,

196
00:12:11.211 --> 00:12:13.760
but the truth hurts those giant fucking schools,

197
00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:19.160
they have so many buildings,
they have so much real estate.
The fucking,

198
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.540
the overhead they have.
Just to keep that,
just to keep the grass mowed.

199
00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.620
Anything with the pulse that's from that state that's walking in,

200
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.340
they're taking your money.
They don't give a fuck.
Go ahead,
go,

201
00:12:31.341 --> 00:12:36.230
go buy a God damn fucking go tigers tee shirt,
go,

202
00:12:36.231 --> 00:12:38.130
go fucking do that.
And then,
then they,
they,

203
00:12:38.131 --> 00:12:39.710
they give it to the out of state people.

204
00:12:39.711 --> 00:12:44.450
Like I actually would had been smart as an out of state student to get into Lsu.

205
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:48.740
All right,
but if,
if I lived in Louisiana,

206
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:49.840
<v 3>okay,</v>

207
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.420
<v 2>alright.
That was down there in the swamp,
right down there in the marsh.</v>

208
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.333
You know what I mean?

209
00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.350
My fucking genes all rolled up mid calf down there trying to get some

210
00:13:01.351 --> 00:13:04.380
sidewinders and some fucking crawfish,
whatever they do down there.

211
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:09.100
You don't have time to fucking learn how to read.
You know,

212
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:12.920
fucking state like Louisiana and me,
come on,
we all,

213
00:13:12.921 --> 00:13:17.240
the Alabama University of Alabama,
I mean in Auburn,
Jesus Christ,

214
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:19.580
they just have this invisible line.

215
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:24.080
They just trying to get people to learn how to read even at eight at even at the

216
00:13:24.081 --> 00:13:28.450
college level,
if you just fucking somewhere,
you know,

217
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:31.810
they just trying to get caught up.

218
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.110
<v 3>Okay.</v>

219
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:36.650
<v 2>Just so there's still recognized as a state.
Anybody in the northern part,</v>

220
00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.200
you guys,
where you guys wear Crimson,

221
00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:45.050
which is they think is so like,
oh my God,
a fancy name for the word red.

222
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.333
Right.

223
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:52.760
They let them go to fucking Alabama and then any animals left down south.

224
00:13:52.761 --> 00:13:54.680
They send them to Auburn.
That's all it is.

225
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.440
And then what they did was went out of state.
People show up,

226
00:13:57.441 --> 00:14:01.340
everybody fucking dresses up and they put on this saddle shoes and they're

227
00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:05.930
fucking sweaters and then they jack up the prices.
You know what I mean?

228
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.430
Because someone like me,

229
00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:12.460
I came from a real state Massachusetts and you know I'm used to schools like

230
00:14:15.381 --> 00:14:17.480
fucking Harvard and Mit.

231
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:18.770
<v 3>Okay.</v>

232
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:23.770
<v 2>Like that's like,
that's the high watermark of where I'm,</v>

233
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:28.830
where my head is that obviously I'm going to think that you have to be smart to

234
00:14:29.021 --> 00:14:32.260
go to the University of Georgia.
I've never been there.

235
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:37.900
I don't realize that most of the people don't have running water in these
states.

236
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.390
So if I was to show up there,
I would just be,
you know,

237
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:46.000
I would have to pay through the nose.
So that's why I never,
uh,

238
00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:47.050
I didn't study

239
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:48.510
<v 3>okay.</v>

240
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.180
<v 2>When I was in high school,
cause I was like,
then,
well,</v>

241
00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:51.430
there's no way I'm getting into Harvard.

242
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.280
There's no way of getting into MIT and every other school,
you know,

243
00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.620
hearing fucking Massachusetts is just basically,
uh,
you know,

244
00:14:59.621 --> 00:15:02.950
let's get shit faced for four years essentially.
Right.

245
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.030
I got to pick one of these schools.
Oh.
And I went to all of them,

246
00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:10.240
went to like three different schools in Massachusetts for,
I finally finished up.

247
00:15:10.241 --> 00:15:15.010
Right.
But I never went out of state because I just assumed that,
you know,

248
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.130
you had to be smart to get into those schools had,

249
00:15:18.131 --> 00:15:22.900
I know now that I've gone around and I've done stand up at most of those schools

250
00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:27.810
and I saw the,
the,
the unbelievable,
uh,

251
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.150
the horror of what is the educational system in this country.
I mean,

252
00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:36.430
I mean,
I think I would've studied,
what do I want it gone?

253
00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:39.320
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

254
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:39.800
<v 2>What's funny,</v>

255
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.940
if somebody is going to cut that up and they're gonna put it on some fucking,
uh,

256
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:49.490
returning sophomore website or the funding of the incoming freshmen thing.

257
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:56.410
Can I get fucking sued for libel?
Maybe,
and I'll just say it's,

258
00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.520
it's a comedy podcast.
It was just jokes.

259
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.340
I wasn't knowingly lying about your school,
by the way.

260
00:16:04.341 --> 00:16:07.580
Speaking of that type of Shit,
getting in trouble for shit that you say.

261
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.800
I've got to tell you something right now.

262
00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:14.890
Watching curt Schilling going after everybody who trolled his fucking daughter

263
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:20.600
is one of the greatest things I've ever seen on the Internet.
I am,

264
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.800
I am so

265
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.700
like just loving every second of watch and curt Schilling do that shit.

266
00:16:26.701 --> 00:16:31.170
That's the funniest shit ever.
This I,
as far as I can tell,

267
00:16:31.171 --> 00:16:36.171
he's the first guy that ever flip the light switch on and sent all the roaches

268
00:16:38.851 --> 00:16:43.750
running for the corners.
Oh,
those tough talk and fucking,

269
00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:44.571
I mean,
you know,

270
00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:48.530
these people that just fucking fucking around or whatever and shellings going

271
00:16:48.531 --> 00:16:52.380
like,
you know,
I know all their names.

272
00:16:52.381 --> 00:16:53.550
I know where they live.

273
00:16:53.551 --> 00:16:57.690
I know where they work and how he's going to shut them down

274
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.600
and how these tweets are going to follow them for the rest of their lives.

275
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.390
It's like current.
You're not that important.

276
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.740
It's not going to follow you them for the rest of the life for their lives.
Okay.

277
00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.380
It's very current.
You know,

278
00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.420
and then it's going to be fucking over.
But I think it's going to be,

279
00:17:18.421 --> 00:17:22.320
but I actually think it's funny that every once in a while you need that
balance,

280
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.650
you know,
just to keep trolls on their toes.

281
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.010
I don't know.
I think it's funny.
It's fucking hill.
I mean,

282
00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.590
God knows comedians get in trouble for everything.
It'd be five seconds white.

283
00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:38.160
Why can't trolls
just fucking idiots.

284
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:43.680
A congratulations.
They weren't even good jokes either.
Congratulations,

285
00:17:43.681 --> 00:17:45.780
my daughter,
she's going to be pitching at this school.

286
00:17:45.781 --> 00:17:49.910
This is the way I'm gonna rape her tweet.

287
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.680
Then he loses his job at like fucking Papa John's.

288
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.760
He's sitting there crying and some empty pizza box.
It was just a joke,
man.

289
00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:08.050
I can't believe that guy with the fucking world series rings is taking my job,

290
00:18:08.271 --> 00:18:09.104
man.

291
00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:14.510
So I'm in the Yankees Organization lost their fucking job.

292
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:19.370
I think it's fucking,
it's hilarious.
You know,

293
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.860
cause they do it to entertainers all the fucking time.

294
00:18:21.861 --> 00:18:24.380
Anything that we tweet all of a sudden is taken seriously.

295
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.690
All of a sudden you can't go AFLAC or whatever the fuck people's jobs where

296
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:34.130
obviously you lose that million dollar job but good for you that you lose your

297
00:18:34.131 --> 00:18:38.960
fucking,
uh,
working at Starbucks job.
I don't know.

298
00:18:38.961 --> 00:18:41.330
I just think it's funny.
I think it would be great.

299
00:18:41.331 --> 00:18:45.770
I think that would great if every once in a while that happened to trolls

300
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:48.920
guys.
I Apologize Man.

301
00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.200
No,
what happened was when I was really sick,

302
00:18:57.201 --> 00:19:01.790
I was cranking the heat like an asshole and a,
now we're going to assholes.

303
00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.670
Go to the fucking sweats and chills,
sweats and chills.
When I was like,

304
00:19:04.671 --> 00:19:07.790
I was kicking heroin or something and I was cranking the heat.

305
00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:12.740
And then my throat got unbelievably dry and dry.

306
00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:17.120
I never knowingly had a dry throat.
I'm sorry,
I'm gonna Start doing that.

307
00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.460
And I never attributed to the fact that I was cause I was sick.

308
00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.350
I was actually dry it out the fucking hair.
And uh,

309
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.810
last night I finally took out the old uh,

310
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:32.690
humidifier and it changed my goddamn world.

311
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:33.981
And you know,

312
00:19:33.981 --> 00:19:37.430
something I never would've thought to do that if I didn't try to get my pilot's

313
00:19:37.431 --> 00:19:41.780
license cause I wouldn't have learned about the weather and moisture in the air.

314
00:19:41.781 --> 00:19:43.550
And if there never would have understood it,

315
00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:48.580
it still would have been magic whether always blew my mind that people couldn't

316
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.880
understand what was going on.
I'm like,
it was like air is invisible.

317
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:54.830
That's one of the most,
that's what,
to me,

318
00:19:54.831 --> 00:19:57.950
that's one of the greatest accomplishments of human beings as being able to

319
00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.810
understand weather.

320
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:06.620
Like how to fuck somebody sat there and rather just enjoying the breeze.

321
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.090
Had to figure out why there was a breeze.

322
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.950
Figure it out somehow that,

323
00:20:16.951 --> 00:20:19.920
that there was air more dense than other air

324
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.680
in that high pressure wants to go to low pressure.
And when you feel a breeze,

325
00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:31.420
that's fucking air moving from one.

326
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:32.630
<v 3>Okay.</v>

327
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.860
<v 2>System two.
And I would have fuck has time to figure that out.</v>

328
00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.370
Or maybe you're standing in a,
in a fucking,

329
00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.120
I don't know.
In an alley.

330
00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:44.670
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

331
00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:48.110
<v 2>And you get in the fucking a Venturi like in</v>

332
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:51.380
<v 1>a cabaret,
right?</v>

333
00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:56.330
Like who had the fucking to the those fucking eggheads you just got,

334
00:20:56.331 --> 00:20:57.440
you got to give it to them.

335
00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:59.180
<v 3>Okay.</v>

336
00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.980
<v 1>But I gotta tell you,
we are a,
despite our smart way,</v>

337
00:21:01.981 --> 00:21:05.300
way too smart for our own fucking good.
I am convinced to that shit.

338
00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:10.490
I gotta tell you that's why that,
that fucking fella there,
you know.
Oh,

339
00:21:10.491 --> 00:21:12.710
pretzel man there,
you know,

340
00:21:12.711 --> 00:21:16.130
with the computer voice really annoys the shit out of me because he's,

341
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:19.730
the stuffies predicting is,
it's pretty basic,
isn't it?

342
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.010
<v 3>Okay.</v>

343
00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:25.240
<v 1>He's basically predicting that we're going,
that we're going to be,
uh,</v>

344
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.160
you know,
we're going to be,
we're going to hasten our own demise.
It's just like,

345
00:21:30.161 --> 00:21:32.920
Gee,
Gee,
wow.
How'd you come up with that?

346
00:21:32.921 --> 00:21:36.640
Because of every fucking thing we've ever done.
You jerk off

347
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.590
so fucking sad.

348
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.660
Everybody's so fucking blown away is cause he's got a computer voice.

349
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.630
You know what I mean?
They didn't treat Roger Ebert that way.

350
00:21:46.631 --> 00:21:49.340
All of a sudden he didn't know every fucking thing about movies.
Daddy,

351
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.810
why are we listening to this guy?
Like he fucking knows everything.

352
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:57.330
You know what gives you feel bad for him?
You know,

353
00:21:57.331 --> 00:21:58.410
maybe it was a cunt.

354
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.050
<v 3>Okay.</v>

355
00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.660
<v 1>You just don't know it now.
Now he doesn't have the ability to do it,</v>

356
00:22:02.661 --> 00:22:07.410
but he was a pompous ass.
It's kind of like the original hater,

357
00:22:07.411 --> 00:22:08.970
isn't he?
He's just fucking,
and he's kind of,

358
00:22:08.971 --> 00:22:11.070
rather than doing an individually on Twitter,

359
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.290
he's fucking doing it to the whole world.

360
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.880
I love all those people like that.
It's just like,
you know something,

361
00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.690
why don't you fucking wheel yourself into Vegas?
Okay.

362
00:22:21.691 --> 00:22:26.691
And Go make it just fucking when every God damn game.

363
00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.710
If you're this good about the future and shit,

364
00:22:28.711 --> 00:22:31.080
why don't you go bet on some fucking football games?

365
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.980
Why don't you sit down at a blackjack table?
All right.

366
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.170
It just bust some casino out.

367
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:40.890
Stop with your fucking oh and your future title.

368
00:22:40.891 --> 00:22:42.540
Waves going to shut up.

369
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.963
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

370
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:49.060
<v 1>Guy Going around giving speeches.
Unbelievable.</v>

371
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:54.520
Um,
anyways,
uh,
Jesus,
that's a bad one.
That was the whole Jesus.

372
00:22:54.521 --> 00:22:57.820
I was a bad,
you know,
I'm blaming that last one.
A cold medicine.
Um,
all right.

373
00:22:57.821 --> 00:23:02.200
This is,
this is the,
this is the Monday morning podcast here and um,

374
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.930
I know it's a little late this morning,
but uh,
like I said,

375
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.750
I'm trying to finish up that helicopter shit.
And I had a lesson this morning,

376
00:23:07.751 --> 00:23:07.961
right?

377
00:23:07.961 --> 00:23:11.830
And had to cancel two last week because I had whooping cough that I had to go

378
00:23:11.831 --> 00:23:13.780
this morning.
I did,
I fly,
actually flew pretty good.
Yeah.

379
00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:22.080
I flew over the La River and when I looked down,
I saw this guy on a segue.

380
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.310
I swear to God,
I think he fucking juiced it up.

381
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.810
You know,
having a cough really affects your time.
All right.

382
00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.410
You know what I need?
I need a lodge.

383
00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:35.053
<v 3>Okay.</v>

384
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.660
<v 1>Touched me knocking or is that the dog?
Cleo,
what are you doing?</v>

385
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.260
<v 2>Oh my God,
I'm going to to hit fucking pause.
Oh,</v>

386
00:23:47.261 --> 00:23:49.570
and I didn't tell you guys this is sick as I am.

387
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:56.360
<v 4>Fuck Hi.
I'm,</v>

388
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.750
<v 2>you know,
one of the things when you're sick is a man,</v>

389
00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.780
by the time you come out the other side,
you have a beard,
right?

390
00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:09.060
There's somebody having a beard.
It just makes you feel like you're homeless,

391
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.500
right?
So,
hi,

392
00:24:13.501 --> 00:24:16.560
head is shaved,
the SIG off.
I'm going to try to talk through the coughs

393
00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:22.770
<v 4>and I'm
flying.</v>

394
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.270
<v 2>This is fucking unreal.
Um,</v>

395
00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:38.500
so I go to shave this fucking thing off.
I did pause.

396
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.780
All right,
I'm back.
Jesus Christ.
That got bad.

397
00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:47.620
Those are the cough up a fucking lung here.
So,

398
00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:49.180
<v 0>okay,</v>

399
00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:50.980
<v 2>go to trim this fucking beard off.</v>

400
00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.110
And I'm Trevor to the whiskers around my mouth and my nose is stuffed up cause I

401
00:24:56.111 --> 00:24:59.410
have a cold.
So without realizing it,
my mouth was a little bit open.

402
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:04.700
It was breathing through my mouth and I inhaled a fucking whisker,

403
00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:10.330
but it's still the back of my throat that's fucking driving me nuts.

404
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:15.160
I've eaten like half a loaf of fucking bread.
I can't get it out of it.

405
00:25:15.161 --> 00:25:19.690
So right now when it switches around,
I already had the sore throat.

406
00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:24.250
Then I got this fucking whisker back there.
I'm in my own living hell here.

407
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.270
Dino,
last night.
I'm laying in bed.

408
00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:36.690
Stop.
Sorry.
All right.
I'm back.

409
00:25:36.691 --> 00:25:41.130
Jesus fucking Christ.
There's something happens when I'm fucking,

410
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.370
my nose gets stuffed up.
I stopped breathing through my mouth.

411
00:25:44.371 --> 00:25:48.030
It dries up my throat and in that fucking a whisker starts wagging its tail back

412
00:25:48.031 --> 00:25:51.750
there and I'm finished.
Um,

413
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:54.960
so last night I'm laying in bed

414
00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:56.950
<v 5>and um,</v>

415
00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:01.770
<v 2>well that's fucking whiskers driving me crazy</v>

416
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.103
<v 5>and</v>

417
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:09.230
<v 2>I just,
I just opened my eyes and said,
fuck this.
Like,</v>

418
00:26:09.231 --> 00:26:13.540
you know that moment and no country for old men when,
uh,

419
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.970
what's his face decides he's going to go back and get that dude some Agua.

420
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.430
It was like that moment,
right?

421
00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:24.740
And I went upstairs and I opened up this takeout food,

422
00:26:24.741 --> 00:26:26.510
like a utensils.

423
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:29.990
And I took out the knife.

424
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:31.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

425
00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:32.243
<v 2>All right.</v>

426
00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:37.490
And then I got some invisible tape or whatever the fuck you call,

427
00:26:37.531 --> 00:26:38.460
you know,
masking tape,

428
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:41.730
you know the fucking shit you do to wrap presents with whatever the fuck it's

429
00:26:41.731 --> 00:26:44.540
called tape.
And uh,

430
00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:48.450
I fucking tape up the handle right.

431
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:54.080
And then I just take this fucking plastic knife with the tape on it and I just

432
00:26:55.821 --> 00:26:59.690
stick it down my throat because my thing is the tape is going to stick to the

433
00:26:59.691 --> 00:27:04.160
hair and it's going to pull out.
Well,

434
00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:09.730
what ended up happening was I stuck it down my throat and uh,

435
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:14.750
once the tape gets wet,
it doesn't work.
I didn't realize that.

436
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.030
So I kept putting it down my throat.

437
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:22.320
<v 1>Then as I'm putting it down my throat,
it just ignoring the gag reflex,</v>

438
00:27:22.321 --> 00:27:25.800
it's just ongoing.
You are just doing that.
Right.

439
00:27:25.801 --> 00:27:29.970
Which is also causing my tongue to become concave,
which is making it harder.

440
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.070
I needed to fucking stand strong.

441
00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:36.580
<v 2>So I was thinking that that's the reason why I couldn't get this fucking thing.</v>

442
00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.550
And,
uh,
yeah,

443
00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:44.260
<v 1>I finally just mentally it was just like I'm ignoring the gag reflex.</v>

444
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:45.580
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

445
00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:50.230
<v 1>And I was able to fucking mind.
Fuck the gag reflex for a split second.</v>

446
00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:51.450
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

447
00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.490
<v 1>And,
but what the result was,</v>

448
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.820
I made a noise that sounded like somebody else made it.

449
00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:01.160
It didn't even sound like my own voice and it actually made me laugh

450
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.150
<v 2>and then I puked
and I got to tell you so</v>

451
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.570
the fucking hair is still back there.

452
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.300
<v 1>I can't get rid of it.</v>

453
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:17.580
So I guess I just got to eat like 90,000 fucking loaves of bread if anybody.

454
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.920
<v 3>Okay.</v>

455
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.950
<v 1>Has the solution.
I looked it up on the internet.
Nobody has a solution.</v>

456
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:28.890
Nobody out there.
Nobody knows what the fuck you supposed to do.

457
00:28:28.891 --> 00:28:30.240
All right.
Um,

458
00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:31.410
<v 3>okay.</v>

459
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.620
<v 1>Hey,
by the way,
uh,
I'm going to read emails at the end of this.</v>

460
00:28:34.621 --> 00:28:36.780

<v 2>All right.
Yeah,
right.
Okay.
Here we go.
Here we go.</v>

464
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:50.330
Reactions

465
00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.040
<v 1>to last week's email about keeping the name Isis Bill.</v>

466
00:28:56.041 --> 00:29:00.190
The overwhelming majority of people said,
uh,
that,
that,

467
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:05.010
that they should keep the name isis reasons varied from don't let the terrorist

468
00:29:05.011 --> 00:29:07.710
win too.
It's a great song.

469
00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:09.010
<v 3>Okay,</v>

470
00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:13.480
<v 1>so there you go.
Follow up to the girlfriend's breath stinks.
Oh,</v>

471
00:29:13.481 --> 00:29:18.430
I remember a couple of weeks ago this guy,
I met the woman of his dreams and,
um,

472
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:20.410
<v 3>okay.</v>

473
00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:25.410
<v 1>Her breath is George Carlin would say a could knock a buzzard off a shit wagon.</v>

474
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:29.200
Um,
he had to figure out a nice way to say that.

475
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.073
<v 2>MMM.</v>

476
00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:36.210
<v 1>All right,
Bill,
here's the followup bill.
I emailed a few weeks ago,</v>

477
00:29:36.211 --> 00:29:40.340
but a few weeks back asking you what to do about my girlfriend's breath.

478
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:45.020
Your advice.
Well,
as Nias was taken to heart and put in action.
Oh,

479
00:29:45.021 --> 00:29:49.610
Jesus.
Here we go.
Yeah.
At first I thought maybe giving her my iPod saying,

480
00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.440
you have to listen to this and play,

481
00:29:52.441 --> 00:29:56.480
or the audio of you two talking about what I should do while I walked away.

482
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.540
But I thought better of it.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
Don't do that.

483
00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:01.470
<v 3>Okay.</v>

484
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:03.930
<v 1>You better hope she never fucking hears any of this.</v>

485
00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.390
I never even thought of that.
So fucking wound up in my own bullshit.
Um,

486
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:14.790
he goes anyways,
I sought it.
I sorta just sat her down,
told her I loved her.

487
00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:19.230
Very good.
Uh,
she,
she was at that point was going like,
all right,

488
00:30:19.231 --> 00:30:23.160
he's either going to break up with me or telling me that he's gay.
Um,
look,

489
00:30:23.161 --> 00:30:26.610
before we go anywhere,
I just want to,
you know that I love you.
No,
fuck.

490
00:30:26.611 --> 00:30:31.110
Here it comes.
What do you got?
A third nipple.
So anyways,

491
00:30:31.111 --> 00:30:35.190
he says that he loves her and that I wanted her to go to the dentist because

492
00:30:35.191 --> 00:30:36.180
everyone should,

493
00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:37.690
<v 3>okay.</v>

494
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:42.690
<v 1>I told her I pay for her first visit and then get her on my dental plan when I</v>

495
00:30:43.331 --> 00:30:47.890
start work.
Fortunately she asks,
why does my breath stink?

496
00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:52.920
Or something sort of with a laugh like she was except expecting me to say no,

497
00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:59.260
but I kind of raised my eyebrows and shoulders and smirked a bit.

498
00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:04.240
Oh.
Oh,
Nate's,
he goes,
wasn't this smooth,

499
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.250
smoothest way of doing it.

500
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:11.260
And she was a little taken aback,
but that was expected.

501
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:16.990
She thanked me for offering to pay and told me she'd start taking better care of

502
00:31:16.991 --> 00:31:17.824
herself.

503
00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:22.000
I don't think she can do much more though because I did see her brush and floss

504
00:31:22.001 --> 00:31:26.650
all the time.
Should have said that before.
Clara clarifying some things anyways,

505
00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.490
hopefully the dentist finds out what's wrong and everything turns out.
All right.

506
00:31:30.491 --> 00:31:35.200
Thanks a bunch and thanks.
Thank Nia for me too.
All right,
there you go.
So,

507
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:40.330
um,
what was I going to say?
That that's a good deal.
Yeah.
She,

508
00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.560
I remember hearing a story,
um,
I forget where the hell I heard it,
but

509
00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:45.850
<v 3>okay.</v>

510
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.780
<v 1>They turned out to be a sinus infection</v>

511
00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:53.650
and there's just something about like when your breaths just stinks,

512
00:31:53.651 --> 00:31:57.130
like you just can't smell it,
which makes no fucking sense.

513
00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:58.810
And every comic in the world,

514
00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.110
he has done a joke that makes no sense cause you know is right above your mouth.

515
00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:06.430
You got to be smelling it all fucking time and he can't and we'll thank God it

516
00:32:06.431 --> 00:32:10.600
worked out.
Um,
I was actually meaning to read.
Uh,
advertising came for.

517
00:32:10.601 --> 00:32:15.601
It's probably good that I read some nice emails after my previous fucking

518
00:32:15.821 --> 00:32:19.720
hacking up a lung there.
Alright?
Trunk Club.
Everybody.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:24.760
Um,

520
00:32:24.761 --> 00:32:25.840

521
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.270
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

522
00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:31.400
<v 1>Don't want to go to hell the mall,
but you are you fucking shirts to match,</v>

523
00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:35.820
right?
They always think we're so dumb.
Uh,
what did,

524
00:32:35.821 --> 00:32:39.990
you could snap your fingers and now have a trunk full of clothes.

your style and your size,

530
00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:02.370
and then they assign a real person who will help style you.
You sons of bitches.

531
00:33:02.371 --> 00:33:04.920
Do you understand how fucking easy your lives are?

532
00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.990
They never had this shit when I was a kid,

533
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:08.520
<v 3>okay?</v>

534
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:13.020
<v 1>You're getting your own personal stylist.
I'm actually jealous right now.</v>

535
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:17.550

they recommend sending you,

And at no cost to you.

They ship a trunk full of fresh clothes to your door.
Well wait a minute,

538
00:33:23.191 --> 00:33:26.780
do I get to see what this stylist looks like?
Why do I just get,

539
00:33:26.781 --> 00:33:31.050
just give a carp launch that this person knows how to fucking dress.

540
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:32.350
<v 3>Okay.</v>

541

This is like Columbia records and tapes for clothes.
That's it.

544
00:33:46.361 --> 00:33:49.480
A better wardrobe then you could ever pick out yourself.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:34:00.200

the box,
even the shipping.
I'm trying to figure it out.

547
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:03.020
They make money.
Then I guess I got to charge you for the close,

That sounds great.

554
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.900
My only question is once I get my trunk of clothes,
cause then I say,
okay,

555
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.330
don't send me any more clothes.

556
00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.580
Please don't send me that pat better to our CD.
I never ordered that or cassette.

557
00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:43.860
We are young.
Heartache to heartache we

558
00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:51.840
love is a battlefield.
No,

559
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.010
my house,
she had all that,

560
00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:57.090
that new age slash post apocalyptic videos.

561
00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:59.060
<v 3>Okay.</v>

562
00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.190
<v 1>Was she also the one that worked hard for the money?</v>

563
00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:03.423
<v 3>Okay.</v>

564
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:08.290
<v 1>I've always fat pad better.
Tara was a less fun Joan jet,
you know?</v>

565
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:10.003
Anyways,

566
00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:11.183
<v 3>okay.</v>

567
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:13.140
<v 1>Till she got with a room full of blues,
then down.</v>

568
00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:17.350
Then she finally let her hair down.
Me.
Andy's everybody.
Oh Shit.

569
00:35:17.351 --> 00:35:21.160
Do I got any fucking win this week to sing this one?
All right,

570
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.260
this is going to be the tuberculosis version.
Boto boop.

571
00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:30.160
Beyond these,
no more sweaty.
But you know what I've done.

572
00:35:30.161 --> 00:35:35.020
I've done this so many times.
I might have to pull a staying here.
You know,

573
00:35:35.021 --> 00:35:37.150
like when he just gives the people what they want.

574
00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.190
He fucking sings the police songs,

575
00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:44.210
but he does like a fucking reggae version of it.
I got it.

576
00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:45.520
Is there a different version?

577
00:35:45.521 --> 00:35:49.990
Do I even have that level of musical talent that I could do?
Um,

578
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:54.970
I want to say it.
Put a little bitty bap,

581
00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:05.410

582
00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:10.440

583
00:36:11.501 --> 00:36:15.760
to your fucking marriage.
Just because you're undercover,

584
00:36:15.761 --> 00:36:19.420
gay doesn't mean your underwear.
It's gotta make you ball sweat.
Oh yeah.

585
00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.860
You want them nice and fucking fresh at the rest area.
You're married,

586
00:36:23.861 --> 00:36:28.360
but you're really gay.
Well,
I guess you can be married in BK.

587
00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:31.870
I Dunno.

you know what that was?

588
00:36:31.871 --> 00:36:35.410

we wanted to give you the demo,
you know,
but we knew,

589

we knew what the tune was.
We knew where this song wanted to live,

590
00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:44.230
but we weren't sure about the message.
Hello again everyone.

591
00:36:44.231 --> 00:36:48.430

Hi Car.
Um,

Let's,
let's get it.

592
00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:51.950
90% people.
That's the percentage of your life,
uh,

593
00:36:51.951 --> 00:36:54.960

like a,

594
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.780
not a commune when she joined a cult,
right?

595
00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:01.030
Then you never wear underwear.

596
00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:05.170
You do for the first week until the guy who you know got you in there,

597
00:37:05.171 --> 00:37:09.670
finally says that he's actually Christ and he's going to bang your wife and then

598
00:37:09.671 --> 00:37:11.170
eventually you right.

599
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.720
And then you drink the koolaid because who gives a shit at that point?

600
00:37:13.721 --> 00:37:17.740
You both wanted die.
Right?
Um,
but you've got some high tops out of it.

Oh,

671
00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.700
I bought a DVD the other day because I'm old.

672
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:46.223
All right.

673

I'm getting soundcloud taken off my computer because I'm bold.
Oh Shit.

675
00:41:55.861 --> 00:41:59.850

676
00:41:59.851 --> 00:42:03.800
sudden it's not available anymore.
There's a little cloud next to it.
Oh,

677
00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:06.300

Oh,

Thank you for solving my fucking full phone problem without even consulting me

679
00:42:11.041 --> 00:42:15.950

680
00:42:15.951 --> 00:42:17.680
like they act like they're doing me a favor.

681
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:22.550
Then I had to download something else to be able to do it and it was actually

682
00:42:22.551 --> 00:42:25.610
going to cost me more money for this song that I already owned.

683
00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:30.060
Why don't you just say my phones,
your phone's full.

684
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:33.690
Go move some of this shit to an external hard drive and then come back.

685
00:42:33.691 --> 00:42:35.910
You can download more shit.
Why don't you just do that?

686
00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:39.210
Stop acting like you're doing me a favor by.
Oh Hey,

687
00:42:39.211 --> 00:42:43.500
I'll hold on some of your shit.
I Dunno.

688
00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:46.170
I'm sure some fucking nerd will tell me that I'm being paranoid,

689
00:42:46.171 --> 00:42:50.160
but I don't think I am.
So anyways,
I bought Joe Joe Mayor's new,
uh,

690
00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.890
what's that new came out last year.
His um,

691
00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:58.140
his followup to a secrets of the modern drummer or whatever the fuck it's
called.

692
00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:03.030
And uh,
this is the one he did one a couple of years ago.

693
00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:04.390
<v 3>Okay.</v>

694
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:05.770
<v 2>That was about all these different,
you know,</v>

695
00:43:05.771 --> 00:43:09.700
molar techniques and all that type of shit.
Um,
boulder math,

696
00:43:09.701 --> 00:43:14.110
they didn't all have different grips and all that shit cause he can play at

697
00:43:14.111 --> 00:43:17.590
blinding speeds.
And never get tired.
Right.

698
00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:18.720
<v 3>Okay.</v>

699
00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.530
<v 2>Cause he's using it all efficiently itself.
Physics of that Shit.</v>

700
00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:24.770
So this guy,
Joe,

701
00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.500
Joe Mayor has the fastest based on foot I have ever heard in my life.

702
00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.910
Good.
I know that's saying a lot for a single bass drum player,

703
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:35.730
this guy can do three,
four in a row.

704
00:43:35.731 --> 00:43:40.731
Like I never heard anything like it blew people away and

705
00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:47.940
it's basically the same kind of a like that push pull method that you do with

706
00:43:50.091 --> 00:43:52.040
you,
with,
with uh,
with your hand.

707
00:43:52.041 --> 00:43:57.041
He does it with his foot and just had the discipline to sit there and do it and

708
00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:58.290
<v 3>okay.</v>

709
00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:00.270
<v 2>I saw Steve Gadd do something like that.</v>

710
00:44:00.271 --> 00:44:05.190
First one is up close video like 30 years ago and Joe Joe has just taken it to a

711
00:44:05.191 --> 00:44:09.420
whole other level.
So now he has a DVD where he breaks it down and

712
00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:10.920
<v 3>yeah,</v>

713
00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.160
<v 2>basically now that that knowledge is out there and then he showed everybody how</v>

714
00:44:14.161 --> 00:44:15.750
to do it.
I can't imagine

715
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:21.470
what this next generation of drummers is going to be just from from day one,

716
00:44:21.471 --> 00:44:24.710
from the day one when you sit down to learn drums,

717
00:44:24.711 --> 00:44:27.410
like that information is already on video for you to watch.

718
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:32.530
Like this is why like some of these kids I see every time I think I'm getting

719
00:44:32.531 --> 00:44:34.900
better at drums or there'll be some eight year old kid,

720
00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.960
not even on youtube cause there's already like,

721
00:44:37.961 --> 00:44:39.700
you know you has always been kids like that,

722
00:44:39.701 --> 00:44:43.480
but I'll just go down a guitar center or whatever and there's always some kid in

723
00:44:43.481 --> 00:44:45.730
there after I play it.

724
00:44:45.731 --> 00:44:49.240
I think I sounded all right if any other drummer was listening to like some kid

725
00:44:49.241 --> 00:44:53.170
will just sit down.
I'm like,
ah,
you motherfucker,
there's always somebody better.

726
00:44:53.171 --> 00:44:55.900
So anyways,
that's going to be my new obsession.

727
00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:00.310
I mean if you could do half the shit that this guy did,
you know,

728
00:45:00.311 --> 00:45:02.620
just being able to play along to so many of those

729
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:04.310
<v 3>okay.</v>

730
00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:07.670
<v 2>Songs just growing up.
Then it was like,
oh my God,
how's that guy's foot so fast?</v>

731
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:11.720
It will be a joke.
Like do like the fact that this guy,

732
00:45:11.721 --> 00:45:16.400
rather than just figuring out this shit himself and just hoarding it to himself

733
00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:19.650
and not letting anybody film him,
the fact that he just shares it with everybody,

734
00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:24.590
so fucking cool.
And he's like this total,
like it's a three DVD thing.

735
00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.900
I mean,
the first one was like an hour and a half long.

736
00:45:26.901 --> 00:45:28.310
I don't even know how long the other ones are.

737
00:45:28.311 --> 00:45:32.450
One of them is just the entire history of the bass drum itself.
I mean,

738
00:45:32.451 --> 00:45:35.870
this guy is obsessed in the,
a in a great way about the whole thing.

739
00:45:35.871 --> 00:45:40.130
So I highly recommend it.
Um,
like I said,

740
00:45:40.131 --> 00:45:43.660
I was laid up for fucking three,
four days and,
um,

741
00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.660
that's all I did was just sit there and,
uh,

742
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:50.300
I watched the singer women in prison.

743
00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:52.320
<v 3>Okay.</v>

744
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.120
<v 2>And you'd think of like,
all right,
man,
this can't be worse than guys.</v>

745
00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:56.500
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

746
00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:59.130
<v 2>But you know,
oh my God,
just,
you know,</v>

747
00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:04.140
they just showed the blood after a fight that was on the floor between two and

748
00:46:04.691 --> 00:46:07.030
they didn't even have any weapons.
I mean,

749
00:46:07.031 --> 00:46:10.120
it looked like somebody fucking gut it a pig.

750
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:14.160
Fuck you.
I would never,

751
00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:22.180
the only way I could ever survive in prison was the second I got there would be

752
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:26.970
to attack a guard and then survive the beat down.

753
00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.233
<v 0>And</v>

754
00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:34.760
<v 2>every time they went to take me out of the hole,
I would just attack them again.</v>

755
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:35.370
And then,

756
00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:40.040
then they finally just decide that this person cannot be around anybody else.

757
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:42.290
<v 3>Okay.</v>

758
00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:47.030
<v 2>Yeah.
Then I would slowly go crazy.
They'd let me out once a day.</v>

759
00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:50.840
My vision would end up being fucked up.
Yo,
your eyes actually,

760
00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:54.890
if they keep you on a cell long enough that actually fucks with your vision.

761
00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:59.390
You lose your far sighted ability because you don't use it anymore.

762
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.330
Cause you're fucking looking.
You know,

763
00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:07.260
you can't see beyond eight feet.
Isn't that fucked?

764
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:10.850
I saw something about that one time.
I can't remember where or do,

765
00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:14.020
maybe somebody tells me that and they had no scientific background.

766
00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:16.660
I have no idea.
But I'm presenting it as fact.

767
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:19.073
<v 0>MMM.</v>

768
00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:22.240
<v 2>What else?
Uh Oh Jesus.
I'm tapering off here.</v>

769
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:25.990
Oh and I saw a commercial for the new fucking Cadillac

770
00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:31.690
four door fucking sedan that's going to go 200 miles an hour.

771
00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:37.720
How fucking great is that?
I swear to God,
I swear to God,

772
00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.330
I think we're handling global warming perfectly.

773
00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:46.120
Just stay the fuck course and when it all just,
you know,
whatever,

774
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:49.000
when the water rises up like it is in Miami,

775
00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:53.850
you know when that happens over the last bit of Greenland,
you know what a,

776
00:47:53.851 --> 00:47:57.160
we had a good time.
We had a good fucking time.
We had a nice run.

777
00:47:58.800 --> 00:47:59.633
<v 0>No,</v>

778
00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:04.970
<v 2>why not?
200 mile an hour sedan.
Phenomenal.
Um,
all right.</v>

779
00:48:04.971 --> 00:48:08.030
Let me read a couple more of these things.
I apologize for the weird breathing,

780
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:12.200
the sound of my fucking cough drop,
but I,
I'm a plain heart this week.
All right.

781
00:48:12.201 --> 00:48:16.880
Give me a break.
Just be lucky you can't smell the Vicks vapor rub.
All right,

782
00:48:16.881 --> 00:48:20.960
girlfriend flirting.
Girlfriend flirting.

783
00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:26.270
Hello.
Red Billy boy.
I have a question for the podcast.
Um,

784
00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:29.270
I met a great girl six month ago,
six months ago.

785
00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:34.690
She's a real lady and she prides herself on being honest and loyal.

786
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:41.210
That's a red flag.
Anybody who says,

787
00:48:41.211 --> 00:48:43.550
I pride myself on being honest and loyal.

788
00:48:43.551 --> 00:48:45.320
I just feel like they're already fucking a,

789
00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:50.120
that's like Roger Clemens when he used to always do the workout videos,
you know,

790
00:48:50.121 --> 00:48:53.450
for the local TV.
Look how hard he works out and you find out he's fucking,

791
00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:57.560
you know,
Dylan roids or whatever the fuck he get busted for.

792
00:48:58.730 --> 00:48:59.870
Here's another one I noticed.

793
00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:04.240
I watch a lot of reality TV with my wife and she watches the fucking,
uh,

794
00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:09.740
the apprentice,
Donald Trump.
This is what I learned.

795
00:49:09.741 --> 00:49:13.250
Anybody who uses that expression,
uh,
lead,

796
00:49:13.251 --> 00:49:17.310
follow or get out of the way.
All right there.

797
00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:21.620
They're always a fucking moron.
Yeah,
they're always,
it's,

798
00:49:21.621 --> 00:49:24.980
they're basically saying like,
fuck it.
I want you to do everything my way.

799
00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:30.430
That's such a moron.
Expression lead,

800
00:49:30.431 --> 00:49:34.330
follow or get out of the way.
I don't know who came up with that,

801
00:49:34.331 --> 00:49:39.331
but it was instantly on tee shirts and I never saw anybody remotely intelligent

802
00:49:39.491 --> 00:49:41.980
with the tee shirt that said,
lead,
follow or get out of the way.

803
00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:43.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

804
00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:44.920
<v 2>It's just that classically,</v>

805
00:49:44.921 --> 00:49:49.030
I don't know if I know how to do shit lead,

806
00:49:49.031 --> 00:49:53.080
follow or get out of the way.
Fucking [inaudible] was saying that,

807
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:54.900
<v 0>okay,</v>

808
00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:59.770
<v 2>this is how pathetic my life was.
I was watching iron Zeringue on,</v>

809
00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:03.120
uh,
it was my dog,
by the way.
I in Zara on fucking

810
00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:06.960
the apprentice.
And he had to cut,

811
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:11.820
his team had to come up with a jingle for some sort of new fucking Budweiser

812
00:50:11.821 --> 00:50:15.000
that they wanted to promote,
uh,

813
00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:17.460
down in the Caribbean.

814
00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:23.570
So he decides he's going to come up with a jingle that's between him and Johnny

815
00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:28.100
Damon.
So,
you know,
the song's going to be good.
Right?
And he comes up with like

816
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.410
<v 1>a,
you know,
drink fucking,</v>

817
00:50:30.411 --> 00:50:35.300
but why is it ba Ba da Ba da Ba da Ba da.
He just,

818
00:50:35.301 --> 00:50:38.300
it's luck.
Kuka cucaracha and they're looking at him and he like,
he's like,

819
00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:40.190
I gotta get away from you guys,
cause you're singing another stuff.

820
00:50:40.191 --> 00:50:45.191
I need to go over here and create any cubs back with new lyrics for La Cucaracha

821
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:47.773
right.

822
00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:53.960
The fucking he fucking vanilla iced it.
And then they're like,
dude,
that's,

823
00:50:53.961 --> 00:50:55.820
Look Kuka.
Roger,
we can't use that.

824
00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:02.420
And he got all fucking pissy so we gotta use something else or whatever.

825
00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:07.380
He just kept saying lead,
follow,
or get or get out of the way.

826
00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:13.530
So the,
the,
the,
the project manager finally looks at him,
she goes,
I am leading.

827
00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:17.550
And he goes,
well,
you got to delegate.
She goes,
I am delegating.

828
00:51:17.551 --> 00:51:21.420
I need you to shut the fuck up.
It was great.

829
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:25.530
Then he got all mad.
He got mad.

830
00:51:25.531 --> 00:51:29.780
And then what type for them to present it to Donald Trump.
He have fasted.

831
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:33.360
He didn't sing along.
He was a big fucking baby.

832
00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:35.140
<v 3>Okay.</v>

833
00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:39.550
<v 1>How can you be 50 years old to be that big of a fucking baby?
I just was unreal.</v>

834
00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:42.480
You get a pout.
Ooh,
fuck.

835
00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:45.640
Pouts at 50 I didn't get my way.

836
00:51:45.641 --> 00:51:50.110
What did they take your fucking Pale and shovel gives a fuck.

837
00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:54.100
Let somebody else write the song and if it's sucks,
they're going to get fired.

838
00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:57.640
Puts your heart and soul into it.
And he didn't,
and he acted like a cunt.

839
00:51:57.910 --> 00:52:01.750
And you know what?
He got himself fucking booted right back to Beverly hills.

840
00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:03.820
<v 3>Okay.</v>

841
00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:06.940
<v 1>Yeah.
Poor bastard.
You know what?
If he was 10 years younger,</v>

842
00:52:06.941 --> 00:52:10.680
he would've got the good hair plugs.
You know,
he would've,

843
00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:13.630
if he got those late 90 ones though,
I'll tell you,
it was a little rough one,

844
00:52:13.631 --> 00:52:17.380
you know,
um,
what am I doing here?
Uh,

845
00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:20.710
and then a girl six months ago,
right?
Here we go.
Lead,
follow,

846
00:52:20.711 --> 00:52:22.300
or get out of the way.
Right?
All right.

847
00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:23.700
<v 3>Okay.</v>

848
00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:27.910
<v 1>Yeah.
A few weeks ago
she said that she doesn't even flirt,</v>

849
00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:31.510
which seems seemed very odd.
Yeah,
yeah.

850
00:52:31.511 --> 00:52:34.120
She's already like cheese or let me just recap this.

851
00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:37.900
She's a real lady and she prides herself on being honest and loyal.

852
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:43.030
A few weeks ago she said she doesn't even flirt,
which seem very odd.

853
00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:47.290
A few days later I heard her giggling and being very flirty with this guy she

854
00:52:47.291 --> 00:52:50.980
studies with.
I confronted her about this and she said,

855
00:52:50.981 --> 00:52:55.180
this is how she always talks to him and I'm overreacting.
I let it go.

856
00:52:55.300 --> 00:53:00.010
Since I always sometimes flirt with other girls when she's not around this week,

857
00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:03.070
she's going on vacation with her colleagues.

858
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:07.960
This guy is also going all the same guy.
Oh,
Jesus,

859
00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:13.750
I brought up the vacation subject and mentioned that in trips,
uh,

860
00:53:13.751 --> 00:53:18.280
that I've been as a single guy,
there was a lot of sex and partying.

861
00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:24.970
Uh,
she says that they don't do that and tries to change the subject.

862
00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:29.410
Let me guess.
Is she going to hedonism on the island there?

863
00:53:29.411 --> 00:53:32.500
Wherever the fuck that goes down.
Uh,
she says,

864
00:53:32.501 --> 00:53:37.501
I don't think that she is cheating by feel that she is hiding something.

865
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:42.700
She also doesn't seem very attracted to me lately.
Even those she says,

866
00:53:42.701 --> 00:53:47.320
so what's your take on this one?
What do you think about flirting?
Uh,

867
00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:50.410
thanks and go fuck yourself.
Um,

868
00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:53.230
I think you're with a lying sack of shit.

869
00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:59.500
Who's a sociopath and they're saying all the right fucking things.

870
00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:02.243
<v 0>MMM.</v>

871
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:04.640
<v 1>And it's also somebody that is,</v>

872
00:54:04.641 --> 00:54:07.730
hasn't found who they want to be with and they're afraid to be alone.

873
00:54:07.731 --> 00:54:12.230
So they just get with people.
And when the initial attraction wears off,

874
00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:16.280
they rather than break up,
they just keep fucking lying.

875
00:54:16.281 --> 00:54:19.610
And I never knowingly,
intentionally lied.

876
00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.710
I think you have to listen to your gut here.
I think she's,

877
00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:25.250
I think it's is the tip of the iceberg.
This is only six months in.

878
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:29.540
She's going on a fucking vacation with other colleagues to six months in at this

879
00:54:29.541 --> 00:54:32.360
chick was in the u.
She'd want to go on vacation with you.

880
00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:35.840
She wants to go on vacation with this fucking creep.

881
00:54:35.841 --> 00:54:39.380
She caught her flirting with after she said she doesn't flirt when you didn't

882
00:54:39.381 --> 00:54:41.870
even give her shit about flirting.
She went out of her way to say,

883
00:54:41.871 --> 00:54:45.920
she doesn't flirt.
Give me a fucking break.
Hey,

884
00:54:45.921 --> 00:54:49.070
I'm a really honest and loyal person.
Oh,
by the way,
I don't do heroin.

885
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:53.040
<v 2>Why?
Why,
why did you just bring that up?
Oh,
you know,
I'm just,</v>

886
00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:57.810
<v 1>it's putting it out there.
I don't believe in it.
Casino,
all the spoons are bent.</v>

887
00:54:58.790 --> 00:55:02.160
Uh,
that's just my gut.
The way you presented it to,
by the way,

888
00:55:02.161 --> 00:55:04.950
you might have left some stuff out,
but the way you presented it,
I think she's,

889
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.900
I think she's a fucking lie.

890
00:55:08.830 --> 00:55:09.663
<v 0>Uh,</v>

891
00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:14.070
<v 2>all right.
Ps,
thank you for sharing your honest insight.
You funny bastard.</v>

892
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:17.200
I love the advice on life and women.
And they also don't trust banks settled.

893
00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:20.730
That's nice.
All right,
well I don't trust your girlfriend.
How about that?

894
00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:24.690
What did he say?
What he say there?
Huh?
What you say there?
Um,

895
00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:26.340
you know what's funny about that?

896
00:55:26.341 --> 00:55:31.341
And if she actually did cheat and you confronted her about it on one of these

897
00:55:31.681 --> 00:55:34.620
fucking TV shows that they would actually still,

898
00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.420
they would still somehow blame the guy.

899
00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:38.963
<v 0>You know what I mean?</v>

900
00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:43.980
<v 2>I love that shit.
Like,
oh,
they actually,
this,</v>

901
00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:46.680
there's an article somewhere on the Internet.
I saw it,
you know,

902
00:55:46.681 --> 00:55:50.310
those things that they try to just get you to click on it and it always works

903
00:55:50.311 --> 00:55:54.150
for me.
You know,
the top 10 bad celebrity nose jobs,

904
00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:58.770
the top 10 fucking gangster movies of all time,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

905
00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:01.500
They had the top 10 reasons women cheat.
Right.

906
00:56:01.501 --> 00:56:06.501
So I looked it up in eight of the reasons we're the guys fault.

907
00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:12.270
It's the funniest fucking shit ever.
Oh,
another movie,
I saw a little bit of,

908
00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:16.770
remember that movie monster with Charlie's Theron.

909
00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:18.773
Um,

910
00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:24.810
<v 1>that movie is one of the most sexist movies of all fucking time,</v>

911
00:56:24.811 --> 00:56:28.740
but we'll never be called on it because it's,
it's going in the other direction.

912
00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:34.470
The fact that that is a movie about a serial killer is it's like when you look

913
00:56:34.471 --> 00:56:37.320
at movies about serial killers,
like the Jeffrey Dahmer One,

914
00:56:37.321 --> 00:56:41.400
the Henry Portrait of a serial killer.
They are,
they are fucking,

915
00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:45.420
they are monsters,
right?
This fucking movie,

916
00:56:45.421 --> 00:56:47.730
despite the fact it was called monster,

917
00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:52.290
it was a Goddamn love story and they justified so much of her killing to the

918
00:56:52.291 --> 00:56:54.420
point when she finally gets busted.

919
00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:59.380
It's this big emotional moment of when her,
her lover is,

920
00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:04.260
is kind of betrayer and rat or out on the stands in his shirt.
You know,

921
00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:07.950
Charlie's,
his character is sitting there crying.

922
00:57:08.490 --> 00:57:12.060
She's saying with their eyes like,
it's okay baby.
I understand.

923
00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:17.330
Do you know how fucking infuriated I would be if I was a re a relative?

924
00:57:17.971 --> 00:57:22.971
What are the actual victims of that absolute fucking lunatic serial killer?

925
00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:26.550
They almost made her a fucking hero.

926
00:57:29.290 --> 00:57:31.640
I mean,
I was waiting for this Sally field moment was,

927
00:57:31.641 --> 00:57:35.080
she's just stands up and holds a union now is,
you know,

928
00:57:35.081 --> 00:57:39.930
for other fucking female serial killers.
It was ridiculous.
I Dunno,
I don't,

929
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:42.850
I don't have any,
uh,
I dunno.

930
00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:47.100
I'm getting very extra jaded as I get older and I,
I,

931
00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:52.260
I'm giving a fuck less about people's complaints because I'm finding they never

932
00:57:53.171 --> 00:57:58.060
complained for other people.
They're always bitch and for themselves.
Right?

933
00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:03.740
Like take the Oscars women got up there,
right?

934
00:58:03.741 --> 00:58:06.860
And they complain that they don't get paid enough and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

935
00:58:06.861 --> 00:58:09.380
blah,
blah,
blah.
Now why are they complaining?

936
00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:15.710
Are they complaining because it's unfair or are they complaining because it's

937
00:58:15.711 --> 00:58:19.520
unfair and it's happening to them?
You know what I mean?

938
00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:20.820
<v 3>Okay.</v>

939
00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:23.310
<v 1>Which is the reason why guys are complaining about it.</v>

940
00:58:23.311 --> 00:58:26.310
Cause they don't give a fuck about it because it's not happening to them.

941
00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:31.110
But that doesn't make women better people because women don't give a fuck about

942
00:58:31.111 --> 00:58:32.460
the shit that's happened in the guys.

943
00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:37.320
Have you ever seen a woman out there that gives a fuck that there's yet another

944
00:58:37.321 --> 00:58:41.460
fucking man standing in a bay window looking out,

945
00:58:41.461 --> 00:58:46.461
seeing a FedEx or a ups truck pulling up as he's just sitting there having a

946
00:58:46.801 --> 00:58:49.500
mini heart attack thinking in his head,
Jesus Christ,

947
00:58:49.501 --> 00:58:51.300
what the fuck did she buy now?

948
00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:52.500
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

949
00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:54.270
<v 1>she's spending all my fucking money.</v>

950
00:58:54.271 --> 00:58:56.760
What the fuck could she have possibly bought now?

951
00:58:57.210 --> 00:59:01.080
She's spending it faster than I can make it.
You know?

952
00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:05.070
What about that financial dynamic?
Do they ever bring that up?

953
00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:08.880
You've ever seen a woman's stickup for a guy in that fucking situation,

954
00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:12.900
why would they?
They don't have time.

955
00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:17.520
They have their own fucking problems.
So that's how I view it.
Oh,

956
00:59:17.521 --> 00:59:21.000
is that what's happening to you?
Ah,
it sucks for you.

957
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:24.160
<v 3>Okay.</v>

958
00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:29.110
<v 2>I don't really feel that,
but it's just,
it's just fun to annoy people sometimes.</v>

959
00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:31.090
Um,
all right,
let's plow ahead here.

960
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:32.590
<v 3>Okay.</v>

961
00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:36.670
<v 2>I do I and look,
obviously I feel like people should make the same amount,</v>

962
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.330
you know,
if you do the same fucking job,
all right?
But you know,

963
00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:44.290
when you're also completely fucking that same group of people over that you're

964
00:59:44.291 --> 00:59:48.220
bitching about in a hundred other fucking areas of life and you choose to

965
00:59:48.221 --> 00:59:51.130
overlook at it,
over look it.
You know what I mean?

966
00:59:51.970 --> 00:59:56.110
Maybe guys make more money so we can afford to fucking get a one bedroom

967
00:59:56.111 --> 00:59:58.990
apartment after you keep the fucking house during the divorce.

968
00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:02.150
Maybe give it think,
maybe that's why we make more from per movie.
Okay.

969
01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:04.403
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

970
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:07.130
<v 2>I dunno.
Just anyways,
in general,</v>

971
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:09.590
just watching people complaining about being in movies is,

972
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:13.790
is something fucking hilarious to me.
There's just something about,

973
01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:16.190
I've ever since I went to India,

974
01:00:16.191 --> 01:00:19.190
it's just over when I listened to myself complain,

975
01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.350
there's always in the back of my head,

976
01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:25.400
I just think of some of the shit that I saw that and it all just becomes funny

977
01:00:25.401 --> 01:00:27.590
to me.
Not in a disrespectful way to India,

978
01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:31.460
but like laughing at myself that what my complaints are.

979
01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:32.840
You know,

980
01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:37.030
<v 1>when I pretend to be a cowboy,
I don't make as much as you do.</v>

981
01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:42.920
<v 2>La,
what size is your mansion?
Um,</v>

982
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:48.200
fat shaming help.
Hey there,
Billy.
Back on the wagon.

983
01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:50.930
I am back on the wagon.
I mean,
I had a couple of,
fuck,

984
01:00:50.931 --> 01:00:55.190
I had a glass of wine last night,
but I,
I have not been Busan.
Okay.
This is,

985
01:00:55.191 --> 01:00:57.110
and what a good boy had been.
Paul Versey

986
01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:03.680
the Great Paul Versey was at my house and I watched the smoke a Cuban cigar and

987
01:01:03.871 --> 01:01:06.510
I did not smoke on with them.
And by the way,

988
01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:10.590
he saw the rebuild downstairs and he gave it rave reviews.

989
01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:15.140
Rave reviews,
rave.
I'll tell you right now,

990
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:18.470
I will fucking put my downstairs bathroom.

991
01:01:18.471 --> 01:01:23.471
I will put this bathroom up against any fucking bathroom in a five mile radius.

992
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.880
All right?
Set saying something in La.
There's a lot of fucking

993
01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:33.150
super talented people out here that they have.
They got bathroom money.
All right?

994
01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:36.540
I am a dancing monkey level.
All right?

995
01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:42.850
So I took my dancing monkey money and I put it into a fucking,

996
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:44.360
I tell you right now,
this is not a day.

997
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:45.930
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

998
01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:48.090
<v 2>it's not a fucking day.
It's the greatest fucking thing ever.</v>

999
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:49.440
<v 3>Okay?</v>

1000
01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.600
<v 2>Everybody thinks you put a bathroom in for the broad.</v>

1001
01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:56.190
They don't fucking get you put a steam shower and it's fucking over.
It's unreal.

1002
01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.890
It's unreal.
The only miss missing from it is,

1003
01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:02.940
and then in that steam is just a fucking,

1004
01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:06.510
a fucking gorgeous [inaudible] walks through it.
You know,

1005
01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:10.800
it finishes you off with a handy.
Would that be fucking phenomenal?

1006
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:12.020
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1007
01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:17.020
<v 2>Can you imagine how much more forgiving the business world would be if every</v>

1008
01:02:17.031 --> 01:02:19.580
man's day started that way?
Oh,

1009
01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:20.720
<v 0>okay.</v>

1010
01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:21.541
<v 1>Don't understand though.</v>

1011
01:02:21.541 --> 01:02:26.250
But the church churches against it can't have that happen.
Can you imagine that?

1012
01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:30.090
You know,
and then you spray a little eucalyptus in the air afterwards.

1013
01:02:30.091 --> 01:02:32.910
It's just who's fighting on the subway?

1014
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:35.203
<v 0>Nobody.</v>

1015
01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:39.990
<v 1>And if elected,</v>

1016
01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:45.080
every man gets a steam shower and they're handy to start the business day.

1017
01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:49.790
All right.
Fat Shaming a Billy back on the wagon.
Uh,

1018
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:54.360
love the podcast and also of the form with you and Joey roses.

1019
01:02:55.110 --> 01:02:57.840
That was supposed to hang out with roses the other night.
I was too sick,
man.

1020
01:02:57.841 --> 01:02:59.220
I fucking love that.
Son of a bitch.

1021
01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:00.873
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1022
01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:07.040
<v 1>I'm six one and used to weigh 370 pounds and now I'm down to 219 pounds.</v>

1023
01:03:08.311 --> 01:03:11.960
You're God damn right.
You are good for you,
dude.

1024
01:03:11.961 --> 01:03:13.530
That's fucking insane.

1025
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:14.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1026
01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:19.530
<v 1>That is a 151 pounds.
My math is correct that if my math is correct.</v>

1027
01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.633
<v 0>Wow.</v>

1028
01:03:22.450 --> 01:03:24.970
<v 1>If that,
that thing that I overheard in a bar that says,</v>

1029
01:03:24.971 --> 01:03:29.380
if you're fucking every pound of fat is five miles of capillaries,

1030
01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:35.100
that's like 605 miles you just took off of of road that you fucking hard as the

1031
01:03:36.981 --> 01:03:40.040
pump every time it goes,
whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,

1032
01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:43.990
Whoa Wolf.
That's fucking phenomenal.

1033
01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:45.131
I said,

1034
01:03:45.131 --> 01:03:49.300
took me a little more than a year to lose that much and you were a big help with

1035
01:03:49.301 --> 01:03:52.390
that.
Your podcast makes working out fun after all.

1036
01:03:52.391 --> 01:03:55.570
What could be more fun than old Billy boys screaming about nerds of the

1037
01:03:55.571 --> 01:03:57.130
government?
More than that,

1038
01:03:57.131 --> 01:04:01.390
you're fat shaming always makes me work a little bit harder and I've had never

1039
01:04:01.391 --> 01:04:06.070
noticed the way I'd get derailed by sugar and salt combo that you frequently

1040
01:04:06.071 --> 01:04:10.330
talk about.
Uh,
for a functionally illiterate,
angry headcase,

1041
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:13.920
you drop quite a bit of knowledge,
my friend,
I'm telling you.
Well,
you look,

1042
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:18.100
I do the same thing everybody else does.
I fucking Yo yo up and down.

1043
01:04:18.101 --> 01:04:23.020
But I keep it within a 20 mile,
20 mile a 20 pound thing.

1044
01:04:23.021 --> 01:04:27.630
Like I went back up to a buck 84 down to one 68.
That's my wheelhouse.

1045
01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:31.600
One 68,
one 72 and went all the way back up to like fucking a buck 84.

1046
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:37.050
And I'm disgusted with myself and uh,
back down to,

1047
01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:41.860
uh,
what is it like one a one 78 [inaudible] 79.

1048
01:04:41.861 --> 01:04:46.760
So I dropped five pounds and this is what I do.
I just,
I just immediately,

1049
01:04:46.761 --> 01:04:50.780
I,
I um,
I actually will go to the gym because there,

1050
01:04:50.781 --> 01:04:54.150
if I just get on a fucking elliptical,
all right,

1051
01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.320
for 45 minutes and then do the five minute cool down,

1052
01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:59.630
I just start doing that every fucking day.

1053
01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:04.840
And it fucking socks for the first three days,

1054
01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:07.401
the first three days.

1055
01:05:07.401 --> 01:05:11.990
And that first fucking night when you stop eating around five or six and you

1056
01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:16.370
just had a protein with a salad and then he just crushed and waters for the rest

1057
01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:19.510
of your night UK.
But you got that sugar and salt,

1058
01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:24.430
you fucking addicted to it because you've been eating it is go get some ice

1059
01:05:24.431 --> 01:05:28.540
cream,
get a burger or a pizza,
go make yourself some eggs.

1060
01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.080
You just have to fight through that.
So like I'm on it right now.

1061
01:05:32.081 --> 01:05:33.860
So what I do is I have a,

1062
01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:38.880
I have salary in Turkey slices and even then a lot of those that Turkey sliced,

1063
01:05:39.281 --> 01:05:43.690
it will have a lot of salt in it.
So I kind of limit that,
but I just,
uh,

1064
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:45.670
I'll put a little peanut butter on a fucking

1065
01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:50.920
piece of salary.
Just shut those things down.

1066
01:05:50.921 --> 01:05:55.240
You feel mean fucking eating salaries like Eaton air and uh,

1067
01:05:55.241 --> 01:05:58.000
all you gotta do is just make it through the first night and the next night is

1068
01:05:58.001 --> 01:05:59.830
way easier as far as the food thing goes.

1069
01:06:00.070 --> 01:06:03.940
But cardios sucks for three days from me.
And then after that,

1070
01:06:03.941 --> 01:06:05.230
then I'm fucking addicted to it.

1071
01:06:05.231 --> 01:06:09.370
Which is how I got sick cause I knew I was feeling run down and I still went and

1072
01:06:09.371 --> 01:06:14.080
did another fucking 50 minutes,
walked out of the gym,
the wind was blowing.

1073
01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:17.380
I don't got a lot of fucking shingles on the roof anymore.

1074
01:06:17.381 --> 01:06:20.170
And next thing you know I got a bowl.
But anyways,

1075
01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:25.750
that is a big thing is not only acknowledging your sugar,

1076
01:06:25.751 --> 01:06:30.370
salt addiction,
but understanding how it affects you.

1077
01:06:30.371 --> 01:06:33.490
Because I would think just like everybody,
it affects everybody differently.

1078
01:06:33.491 --> 01:06:37.630
But like knowing like,
like the other day I was just,
so I was,

1079
01:06:37.690 --> 01:06:41.170
I was trying to eat well as long as I could through trying to beat this cold.

1080
01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:44.170
And then finally I just had enough,
I just was like,
fuck this man,

1081
01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:47.860
I just want a pizza.
And I ordered a pizza.
And

1082
01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.720
I remember thinking,
all right,
I'm meeting this at night.

1083
01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:56.800
This is all salt is going to send my salt to the fucking roof.

1084
01:06:56.830 --> 01:07:01.720
And then tomorrow morning I'm either gonna want more salt with a big fucking

1085
01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:05.650
eggs and sausages and that shit,
or I'm going to go the other direction.

1086
01:07:05.651 --> 01:07:08.740
And for some reason like I don't know why,
I just feel like I want a waffle.

1087
01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:12.370
Yeah cause they had a whole fucking pizza the night before and it's literally,

1088
01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:16.490
it's like people who fucking drink booze cause they did too much coke and you

1089
01:07:16.491 --> 01:07:20.740
trying to even yourself off and what you really need to do is just wake up

1090
01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:25.120
knowing that you're going to be craving those things and you plow through it and

1091
01:07:25.121 --> 01:07:29.620
you just make the oatmeal instead and you shoveled that shit down and within

1092
01:07:29.621 --> 01:07:34.621
three spoonfuls your body will start to fucking level out and you'll remember

1093
01:07:36.611 --> 01:07:41.440
that,
oh food is supposed to energize me,
not dragged me down to the fucking Matt.

1094
01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:45.430
And if you can remember that for me anyways,

1095
01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:47.650
that's how I was able to keep,
I'd like,

1096
01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:53.220
I've gone down to a buck 68 like probably four times since I moved out to la.

1097
01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:59.040
And this time I'd stayed within one 68 a buck 72 for almost a year,

1098
01:07:59.981 --> 01:08:02.980
year and a half.
And I used to,
when I would get down,

1099
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:06.280
it takes me like six months to get down to that level.

1100
01:08:06.281 --> 01:08:08.260
And then the second I got down to that level,

1101
01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:12.400
I would reward myself with the fucking cheeseburger and I would like,
Hey,

1102
01:08:12.401 --> 01:08:16.860
I've been sober six months,
let me go shoot up some to fucking celebrate.
You do.

1103
01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:21.290
I'm doing the exact same thing.
And then you just fucking,
you're right back.

1104
01:08:21.291 --> 01:08:24.200
You know,
Jason The dragon man.

1105
01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:28.700
And then I would just like Jesus Christ,
you could put it back on,

1106
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:33.830
you know,
six months to take it off,
put it back on in six weeks.
And I would,
uh,

1107
01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:36.080
I would fight it,
but it would take me like,
you know,

1108
01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:39.820
two and a half months gotta be right back to a bucket,

1109
01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:42.350
like the most depressing fucking number.

1110
01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:45.680
That second number is when I see that eight,
I,
I just,

1111
01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:50.720
I just refuse to fucking be above a buck 80,
um,

1112
01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.130
with my building,
everything.

1113
01:08:52.131 --> 01:08:56.090
So I'm at least back down to one 79 [inaudible] 78 or something.

1114
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:57.980
I'm gonna start working out again tomorrow.

1115
01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:01.520
Go right back on the fucking elliptical.
And,
uh,

1116
01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:06.910
um,
I'm going to try to have the discipline this time to actually get a truly,

1117
01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:12.900
like try to get my six pack back one last fucking time before I slide into 50.

1118
01:09:13.690 --> 01:09:14.523
And

1119
01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:15.850
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1120
01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:19.570
<v 1>just the level of discipline and the understanding of nutrition that I'm going</v>

1121
01:09:19.571 --> 01:09:22.270
to have to have.
I really want to fucking do it.

1122
01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.850
And I told you I'm going to do this bit.

1123
01:09:24.851 --> 01:09:28.750
I'm so sick of fucking people who book movies and then they get upset that

1124
01:09:28.751 --> 01:09:32.410
fucking Hollywood tells him to work out.
It's,

1125
01:09:32.890 --> 01:09:34.210
it's fucking ridiculous.

1126
01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:38.070
It's like you gotta to be in a fucking movie and then the people are going to

1127
01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.570
put a mill millions of dollars into this thing.

1128
01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:45.460
They're trying to not lose money that trying to get their money back.
You know,

1129
01:09:45.461 --> 01:09:47.570
I'm not giving anybody shh.
I know it's hard to lose weight.

1130
01:09:47.571 --> 01:09:48.311
And for other people it's,

1131
01:09:48.311 --> 01:09:52.750
it's harder but futile fucking complain that somebody wants you to look good in

1132
01:09:52.751 --> 01:09:56.830
a movie or to look your best.
It once again,

1133
01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.820
it's fucking ridiculous.
So,
um,

1134
01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.160
<v 0>okay.</v>

1135
01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:05.910
<v 1>Those people that are,
you know,
fucking Brad Pitt's in his fifties.</v>

1136
01:10:05.911 --> 01:10:08.490
The guy's still has,
you know,

1137
01:10:09.090 --> 01:10:12.780
abs like the level of dedication that is in fucking,

1138
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:14.920
and he's got his own personal chef.
I don't give a fight.

1139
01:10:14.921 --> 01:10:19.290
A personal chef would be like,
man,
man,
I mean I would,

1140
01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:21.510
what's he gonna say?
No

1141
01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:26.050
telling you it's a fucking discipline and I,
and I don't have it.

1142
01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:30.580
I have the discipline to get to within about eight pounds of it.

1143
01:10:31.150 --> 01:10:35.140
And then I just,
I give into like the uh,
hey man,

1144
01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.660
I'm like,
I'm a buck 68.

1145
01:10:37.690 --> 01:10:42.690
I'm like 17 pounds away from where the fuck I just was going to have a burger.

1146
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:46.900
I'm going to have a fucking bud tall at this bar.
I,
dude,

1147
01:10:46.901 --> 01:10:51.900
I go off the rails the worst.
So this time I'm going to try and uh,

1148
01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:56.500
I'm going to try to see this one through,
which is why I'm saying this out loud.

1149
01:10:56.530 --> 01:11:00.370
So,
because I figure you guys will be checking in at a month or so to see how I'm

1150
01:11:00.371 --> 01:11:03.850
doing it.
Give me shit if I doubt or heckled me on the road.

1151
01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:07.750
And if Fatty freckles,
whatever the hell are you going to say?
So anyways,

1152
01:11:07.751 --> 01:11:11.530
this is getting back to this guy.
Uh,
anyways,

1153
01:11:11.531 --> 01:11:15.630
I still need to lose another 20 or so,
but I'm less worried about that,

1154
01:11:15.631 --> 01:11:17.400
that I am with gaining it all back.

1155
01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:21.690
This is where I need some more help from old freckles.
They're,
oh,
you know what?

1156
01:11:21.691 --> 01:11:22.740
I think I just brought it up here.

1157
01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:26.910
I was hoping you could give me some fat shaming on the podcast that I could use

1158
01:11:26.911 --> 01:11:31.440
for inspiration if I start to gain some of the weight back.
Basically,

1159
01:11:31.441 --> 01:11:35.820
if you could just give me some version of self talk in the mirror when you start

1160
01:11:35.821 --> 01:11:40.440
to gain weight,
that would be amazing.
Uh,
as always,

1161
01:11:40.441 --> 01:11:43.860
go fuck yourself.
Hey,
this is what you do.
Like,

1162
01:11:43.861 --> 01:11:48.060
you know how much work it took you.
You know what I would do?
I would write down,

1163
01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:53.610
I would write down the amount of months.
I would write the amount of days,

1164
01:11:53.611 --> 01:11:54.840
the amount of hours,

1165
01:11:56.540 --> 01:12:01.340
and right down to the minutes that you had to work to get down.

1166
01:12:01.341 --> 01:12:04.490
And then just right.
Just something to motivate yourself,

1167
01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:09.300
you know,
are you going to give it,
you're going to give it all back.

1168
01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:14.520
You stupid cunt,
you know,
don't give it back dope.

1169
01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:17.280
And you know what happens?

1170
01:12:17.281 --> 01:12:20.520
You're going to put that on your wall or on your bathroom mirror and this is

1171
01:12:20.521 --> 01:12:22.470
what's going to happen,
alright,

1172
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:25.710
that's gonna motivate you for about six days.

1173
01:12:27.230 --> 01:12:29.810
And then what's going to happen is this,
just to be,
it's going to be a party.

1174
01:12:29.811 --> 01:12:33.020
You brushing your teeth and it's not going to hold the same meeting.

1175
01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:37.640
So what you have to do is you have to constantly be updating that,

1176
01:12:38.370 --> 01:12:42.830
all right?
And you basically,
you got to get yourself into the fucking mindset.

1177
01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:47.300
Like you're not,
you're not giving it back.
All right?

1178
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:52.510
So this is what I would do.
Okay?
There's gotta be holidays,

1179
01:12:52.511 --> 01:12:57.290
it's gotta be birthdays is going to be,
you know,
the night out or whatever.
Okay?

1180
01:12:57.890 --> 01:13:02.570
But this is what you gotta do.
I if I would weigh myself every morning.

1181
01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:08.920
So you don't,
you don't fucking not weigh yourself,
you know,

1182
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:12.250
for months on end because that's all of a sudden how you get 40 pounds,

1183
01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:17.590
40 pounds behind the fucking eight ball.
Right?
You weigh yourself every day.

1184
01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:18.900
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1185
01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:21.000
<v 1>And if she went out and you know,
you ate bad or whatever,</v>

1186
01:13:21.001 --> 01:13:22.500
you decided to treat yourself,
all right,

1187
01:13:22.501 --> 01:13:25.860
you're going to be a couple of pounds over.
Okay.
Then you got to discipline.

1188
01:13:25.861 --> 01:13:29.010
Like I gotta get back down to where the fuck I was.

1189
01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:33.960
And then you have to have a number that is,
it's just unacceptable.
Like with me,

1190
01:13:33.961 --> 01:13:38.010
it's a buck 80 unacceptable.
When I see that eight,
it's fucking over.

1191
01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:41.460
I don't give a shit if it's Thanksgiving tomorrow.
Oh,
who's can't do,

1192
01:13:41.461 --> 01:13:45.360
I'm fucking eating thanksgiving,
but like,
it's,
it's done.
Um,

1193
01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.190
what did you say your weight was here?
You were three.
Seven.

1194
01:13:50.191 --> 01:13:55.040
So now you're down to two 19.
All right.
Um,

1195
01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:59.520
so I would just say when that second number is three,

1196
01:13:59.521 --> 01:14:03.840
that's it.
That's it.
Shut it down.
Shut it down.
And I'm telling you,

1197
01:14:03.841 --> 01:14:06.060
give you self that small of a fucking window,

1198
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:11.100
you got that small of a fucking journey back it.
What happens is,
as you know,

1199
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:13.700
I have friends who have weight issues.
What happens is,

1200
01:14:14.210 --> 01:14:18.260
is when they start putting it back on that self loathing,

1201
01:14:18.261 --> 01:14:21.530
I fucking hate myself.
I fucking hate myself.
And they,
you know,

1202
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:25.040
they just haven't learned that skill yet

1203
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:30.620
to just fucking grab that demon by the throat and fucking choke slam it.

1204
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:31.660
It just,

1205
01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:36.080
just turn it back around before you go a hundred miles in the wrong direction.

1206
01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:39.470
And now you've got to go a hundred back.
That's a tour to mile trip.

1207
01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:42.860
You could get 10 miles down the fucking road Turner,
right back to 20 miles.

1208
01:14:42.861 --> 01:14:44.870
No big deal.
All right,

1209
01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:48.620
so you just really have to be like,
listen,

1210
01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:52.400
like for me to sit there and act like a little bit to 19 for the rest of my

1211
01:14:52.401 --> 01:14:53.240
fucking life,

1212
01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:57.140
it never go up a little bit or maybe go down a little bit is fucking nuts.

1213
01:14:58.440 --> 01:14:59.273
Um,

1214
01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:03.620
if we act like I'm never gonna fucking have a piece of pie or you know,

1215
01:15:03.650 --> 01:15:06.350
some comfort food is ridiculous,

1216
01:15:06.351 --> 01:15:11.351
but you just have to have like those be special things that you do and you have

1217
01:15:12.261 --> 01:15:15.770
to learn how to live at that weight.
And I would actually,

1218
01:15:15.771 --> 01:15:19.070
now that you're down at two 19,
whatever you did,

1219
01:15:19.071 --> 01:15:23.690
I would also be always looking for some new way to work out,
you know,

1220
01:15:23.691 --> 01:15:27.710
a fucking boxing gym,
a hike,
bike riding,
swimming,

1221
01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:30.730
anything you'd can do because the same way that note on your,

1222
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:35.810
on your fucking bathroom mirror just becomes part of your day and you,
you,
you,

1223
01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:39.590
you,
you just get bored.
Um,

1224
01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:44.540
if you get bored with your workout,
that gets dangerous because you know,

1225
01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:49.230
you don't,
you never get bored eating.
You just,
there's always,
you know,
you know,

1226
01:15:49.231 --> 01:15:52.350
it's funny,
you always go,
oh Jesus book,
what kind of tootsie rolls at East?

1227
01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:53.850
Let me try these.
You always deal with that.

1228
01:15:53.851 --> 01:15:56.490
You've got to do the same thing with like,
you're fucking your workouts there.

1229
01:15:56.491 --> 01:15:59.760
I'm done fucking preaching.
All right.
This podcast is getting ridiculous.

1230
01:15:59.761 --> 01:16:02.690
He law dude,
that,
that actually what you just did is,

1231
01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:06.540
is inspired me to go to the fucking gym tomorrow,
man.
Good for you,
dude.
That's,

1232
01:16:07.190 --> 01:16:11.790
that's an odd,
I've never had to try to lose weight for over,
for over a year.

1233
01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:17.130
Um,
that's unbelievable.
So did you work that fucking hard man?
You can't do that.

1234
01:16:17.131 --> 01:16:20.340
You can't give that back.
You just can't.
You can't.

1235
01:16:20.341 --> 01:16:23.760
And you have to keep reminding yourself in a new way.
All right?

1236
01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:25.070
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1237
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:29.720
<v 1>Make yourself proud.
Don't fuck yourself over.
All right.
Sleazy Douche.</v>

1238
01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:34.370
I built this guy's from Scotland or he is a fucking pirate.

1239
01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:39.760
Longtime listener.
Love Your Shit.
Saw You're both times in Sydney.
Please stop.

1240
01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:42.590
All right.
Maybe he's a Scot from Sydney.
I don't know.

1241
01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:44.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1242
01:16:44.410 --> 01:16:49.320
<v 1>Maybe he's like Bond Scott.
Right?
Ah,
fuck.
Alright.</v>

1243
01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:54.100
This is fucking cunt.
He grew up with my girlfriend.

1244
01:16:55.150 --> 01:16:58.030
I love Australia.
What a way to start a fucking thing.

1245
01:16:58.750 --> 01:17:00.280
There's this fucking kid.

1246
01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:04.060
He grew up with my girlfriend as the lovable,

1247
01:17:04.061 --> 01:17:07.750
sleazy guy that everyone tolerates.
I got to hate that dude.

1248
01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:12.420
That's just,
that's just insert.
That's just so and so.

1249
01:17:12.421 --> 01:17:14.730
That's how he is.
They say.

1250
01:17:15.210 --> 01:17:20.210
So recently he commented on a photo of my girlfriend leaning forward and

1251
01:17:20.911 --> 01:17:25.500
unintentionally showing some cleavage on Facebook and I can't stop thinking

1252
01:17:25.501 --> 01:17:30.240
about wanting to slap him.
All he wrote,
uh,

1253
01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:31.650
was Jesus.

1254
01:17:32.010 --> 01:17:36.350
But what kind of his cock sucker think it's okay to comment on someone's ladies

1255
01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:40.020
at,
uh,
uh,
someone else's lady in a public forum.

1256
01:17:40.290 --> 01:17:45.290
Any idea on how I can satisfy my desire to write this situation without making

1257
01:17:45.541 --> 01:17:49.770
it too uncomfortable for my girl?
Uh,
thanks and go fuck yourself.

1258
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:52.100
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1259
01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:56.160
<v 1>All right.
Well,
first things first.
I think your assessment of this person.</v>

1260
01:17:56.161 --> 01:17:59.250
Everybody knows this person.
Uh,
secondly,
I don't know how,

1261
01:17:59.251 --> 01:18:03.270
you know how your girlfriend accidentally leans forward and unintentionally

1262
01:18:03.271 --> 01:18:05.070
shows too much cleavage.

1263
01:18:05.071 --> 01:18:09.450
This wasn't a video somebody else took that was shot live.
This is a photo.

1264
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:13.410
I'm guessing she uploaded it,
so she was all right with it.

1265
01:18:15.810 --> 01:18:19.200
How do you accidentally,
oops.
Is that my ball bag?

1266
01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:24.090
I know I have to upload it.
You know what I mean?
Um,

1267
01:18:25.570 --> 01:18:26.403
<v 3>yeah.</v>

1268
01:18:26.490 --> 01:18:30.570
<v 1>I don't understand why,
uh,
why this person is a,</v>

1269
01:18:30.810 --> 01:18:35.580
in her life or in anybody's life.
Um,

1270
01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:38.070
there's a bunch of different ways you can go with this.
She can go,

1271
01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.670
I dunno what do,
what do you do?
I mean,
I,
I,

1272
01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:44.920
<v 3>yeah,</v>

1273
01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.330
<v 1>I want you to say something to the guy,</v>

1274
01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:50.420
but I don't think it's going to work though.
That'd be,
if this is a movie,

1275
01:18:50.421 --> 01:18:54.790
you walk up and you slap him in the face,
right?
But then your,

1276
01:18:54.791 --> 01:18:58.430
your girlfriend appreciates you and then a reciprocates a physically,

1277
01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:03.170
but we know that's not how the world works,
don't we?
So,
um,

1278
01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:07.310
yeah.
We also know you can't,
you can't blame your girlfriend.

1279
01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:12.980
So,
uh,
what do you do?
Jesus Christ.
This is a fucking quagmire.

1280
01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:16.710
I thought this is going to be easy.
This is God damn quick here.

1281
01:19:16.730 --> 01:19:20.950
So recently come into the photo.
MMM.

1282
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:25.430
You know,
he's a fucking jerk off.
Why waste your fucking time?

1283
01:19:25.431 --> 01:19:28.100
This is what you do.
You know what?
This is what you do.

1284
01:19:28.101 --> 01:19:31.130
You just put that in the old memory bank,
right?

1285
01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:35.300
The next time you're out there playing Aussie rule footballs and he's on the

1286
01:19:35.301 --> 01:19:39.470
other fucking team,
right?
And I say footballs,
Ozzy roof,
Ozzy rules,
right.

1287
01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:41.870
Maybe was actually me.

1288
01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.780
That was a Freudian slip about fucking kicking the right in the balls.

1289
01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:49.730
You take them out,
that's what you do.
Oh,
you just wait.
You get pick your fucking,

1290
01:19:49.731 --> 01:19:53.450
this might be one of those ones where you laid back,
right?

1291
01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:57.380
You pick your fucking spot and uh,

1292
01:19:57.381 --> 01:20:00.560
you know when the time is fucking right,
you make your point,

1293
01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:04.130
you look them right in the eye and you,
you,
you fucking,
you make your point.

1294
01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:08.380
Who knows if he pushes you it,
you get to slap.
You don't look like an asshole.

1295
01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:12.100
Right.
Was that all right?
I Dunno.

1296
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:13.940
For some reason that gave really fucking annoys me.

1297
01:20:13.941 --> 01:20:17.480
I might've given you bad advice cause I kinda got a little bay emotions get the

1298
01:20:17.481 --> 01:20:19.270
best of me there.
All right,
let me read it,

1299
01:20:19.271 --> 01:20:23.600
another couple of fucking ads here that we can wrap this thing up.
Um,

1300
01:20:24.170 --> 01:20:25.790
yeah,
that's what I would do.
I would bank that one.

1301
01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:29.260
<v 0>I would beg that one.
Um,</v>

1302
01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:35.030
<v 1>worst case scenario I would ask your girlfriend,
like,</v>

1303
01:20:35.031 --> 01:20:38.180
why is this jerk off in your social circle?
Social Circle?

1304
01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:45.440
Just hear and be like,
all right.
Why?
Why would throwing uh,
cause I,

1305
01:20:45.441 --> 01:20:47.980
I think he's not a good person.
I think he's a dirt bag.

1306
01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:53.390
Like why do you say that?
Well cause he's commenting about your boobs.

1307
01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:58.270
Oh well that was chairs pool.
It just be like,
all right.

1308
01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:04.560
They just leave it at that.
You said you'd think to her that whatever.

1309
01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:06.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1310
01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:08.510
<v 1>Oh that sucks.
That if you fucking slap him in a bar,</v>

1311
01:21:08.511 --> 01:21:12.020
you can establish motive with her for the conversation that you know she's not

1312
01:21:12.021 --> 01:21:14.210
going to forget.
That's a tough one.

1313
01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:17.660
You might have to go fucking psycho on this one.
You might have to just,

1314
01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:21.920
it's never good when you keep it.
T's fucking keep it to yourself.

1315
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:25.370
Just don't fucking do physical arb tube.

1316
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:31.030
But today's bitch slap a nice lead timed bitch slap.

1317
01:21:32.850 --> 01:21:37.300
That could be a good thing.
Next time he says something.
Oh Dude,

1318
01:21:37.301 --> 01:21:38.290
that would be hilarious.

1319
01:21:38.650 --> 01:21:42.340
The next time he's out that everybody's sitting around all coupled up and he's

1320
01:21:42.341 --> 01:21:46.480
just the fucking jerk off.
Right.
And he makes some sort of rude covet.

1321
01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:49.900
Slap them across the face.
Not Hard.

1322
01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:53.020
Well you'd like actually do physical damage.

1323
01:21:53.230 --> 01:21:55.810
Just slap him in the face like you would a kid.

1324
01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:57.510
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1325
01:21:57.510 --> 01:22:02.220
<v 1>And then you point right in his face.
It just be like,
hey babe yourself,</v>

1326
01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:04.650
like whatever a parent would say to like an eight year old,

1327
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:07.080
it just leave it at that.

1328
01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:12.030
It even if everybody thinks you're a psycho at the end of the day,

1329
01:22:12.031 --> 01:22:13.080
you still dead it.

1330
01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:14.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1331
01:22:14.330 --> 01:22:16.310
<v 1>And you know what?
Even if he is a cut,</v>

1332
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:18.620
he's got to watch his fucking mouth around you.

1333
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:23.450
That's more fucking belittling than getting punched in the face of someone just

1334
01:22:23.451 --> 01:22:26.570
fucking just,
you know what?
If you just grabbed the,

1335
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:30.140
you know your mother used to grab you on either side of your cheeks and she

1336
01:22:30.141 --> 01:22:34.160
fucking,
you know,
she'd grow.
I can't,
I don't know how to explain it.

1337
01:22:34.161 --> 01:22:38.060
She just pitched both of your cheeks and then you fucking fish pocket up your

1338
01:22:38.061 --> 01:22:40.280
fish,
your lips,
puck it up like fish lips.

1339
01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:43.760
He fucking grabbed you that she'd wag a finger right in your face.

1340
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:45.110
Just give one of those.

1341
01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:46.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1342
01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:48.990
<v 1>So it's a real parental and humiliating.
Oh,</v>

1343
01:22:50.490 --> 01:22:54.500
get up on the bed.
What's up buddy?
Huh?

1344
01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:56.910
Fuck a dog.

1345
01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:02.040
I really hung out with you for the last four days and I realized that you sleep

1346
01:23:02.041 --> 01:23:07.041
12 hours a night and four hours during the day you get up to to go to the

1347
01:23:07.701 --> 01:23:11.480
bathroom or eat or to come up on the bed and be pet and that's it.

1348
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:17.030
You know what?
You got no goals

that was actually played by a three year old prodigy Chinese kid in a sweatshop

1361
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:07.730
in mainland China.

than recording of,

1364
01:24:12.261 --> 01:24:15.530
they found that it was cheaper that would ever somebodies phone rings,

1365
01:24:16.670 --> 01:24:19.430
they make him play it live.
They thought it would sound better,

1366

1421
01:27:58.530 --> 01:28:02.040
That's the name of the tour.
The,
uh,
the Billie Bible belt tour.

1422
01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:06.900
We had the Billy red state tour and keep staying with the Billy named Billy

1423
01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:11.610
Bible belt.
I thought about Billy Bob Bible belt summit,
some south,
no,

1424
01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:16.470
Billy Bible belts,
old freckled fury is coming through the south.

1425
01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:19.630
I thought about Berman's march,
you know,
and I'm,

1426
01:28:19.631 --> 01:28:23.280
I can't do that cause that's gonna I can't rub it into their faces that not only

1427
01:28:23.281 --> 01:28:27.720
did we win the civil war,
but we committed war crimes.
You know,

1428
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:31.500
was it a war crime?
Well,
we won,
right?
Let's it.
Um,

1429
01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:35.160
I did a night or two,
many stars.
So look for that.

1430
01:28:35.161 --> 01:28:39.780
I did a little bit of stand up on that in a Martha Stewart just stared at me the

1431
01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:43.680
entire time,
which was a,
it was unsettling.

1432
01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:47.460
You know,
when you see somebody famous to the crowd,

1433
01:28:47.461 --> 01:28:51.630
you want them to at least acknowledge that you're there and maybe laugh cause

1434
01:28:51.631 --> 01:28:54.300
you think that they know something.
Would they have a fucking empire?

1435
01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:59.280
She wasn't feeling it.
Um,
all right,
Jon Stewart hosts,

1436
01:28:59.290 --> 01:29:03.270
who's the greatest fucking guy ever in this.
So in tribute of him,

1437
01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:07.410
in all his great work that he did on the daily show,

1438
01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:11.850
this is your moment of Zen.
This is my dog getting a back rub.

1439
01:29:19.330 --> 01:29:22.930
All right,
thanks for listening to fuckers.
Go fuck yourselves.

1440
01:29:22.931 --> 01:29:23.980
I'll talk to you next week.
