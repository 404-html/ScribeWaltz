3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.590
Jackie,
just checking in on you.

4
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.810
You fucking who?
What's going on?
How are you?

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.730
Um,
oh,
this sound sound fucked up here.
You know what it is.

6
00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:26.080
You guys probably want to wipe.
Why don't you,

7
00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:29.680
when you get the fucking sound right,
why don't you just set it,

8
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.150
set it and forget it.

9
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.840
Remember that Shit you turn on and off and just forget about it.

10
00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:36.400
Just fucking walk away from it.

11
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.530
I bought one of those things.
The thing was the shit,
I don't know.

12
00:00:41.531 --> 00:00:42.970
I can't remember what ever happened to it.

13
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.110
Stick a whole fucking chicken in there,
you know?
And I would shut it,

14
00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:48.220
but I would not forget it.

15
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.600
I would always remember that I had a chicken cooking cause I was living in New

16
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.381
York and uh,
you know,

17
00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:58.080
I was paying nine grand a month for like fucking 30 square feet.
So,
you know,

18
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.420
I had my pillow propped up on the other side of it.
And you know,

19
00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:03.870
it's impossible not to hear that bell go off considering a,

20
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.410
my head was against it.
You know,

21
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.000
half of my head would be sweaty and red and I'd sit down or eat a whole chicken

22
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.010
greasy is shit.

23
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.560
I don't understand why fucking chickens is so God damn greasy.
You know,

24
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:22.190
when you look at them they don't look greasy and that greasy shit.
And then,

25
00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:22.371
you know,

26
00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:26.420
what's the worst is your fucking show up and the amount of people that don't

27
00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:30.680
know how to cook chicken and it's just fucking dry as chicken.
Do you know,

28
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:34.610
way back in the day,
back in the day when I was young and I had more hair,

29
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.983
um,

30
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.610
I used to do a what was called the uptown shows,
you know,

31
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:45.610
do the uptown shop town,
you know,
in my business is means,
uh,

32
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.150
the black shows,
the shows where the crowd is African American.

33
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.770
And uh,
every once in was like one white guy on the show,
one token white guy.

34
00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:56.690
So I used to be the token white guy on those things.

35
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.530
And I remember all the fucking time I used to do these things and I hope he

36
00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:03.170
hears just,
I used to work for a talent.

37
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.800
He used to do all those fucking rooms and they used to always give me shit,

38
00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:09.520
say white people don't know how to have a cookout or barbecue,

39
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.530
whatever the fucking thing is.
And I'll never forget he invited me.

40
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.680
I can't remember.
Was it him?
A General Kelly?
They invited me up.

41
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.620
Where the fuck up in the Bronx?
I don't know where the hell it was.

42
00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:25.621
It was just fucking like basketball slash do stand up during the day and this

43
00:02:27.461 --> 00:02:31.780
basketball park.
So I have fuck it.
I'll go up there and do it.
So I went up there,

44
00:02:31.781 --> 00:02:34.840
you know,
and they're fucking cook it up and all that shit.
And I got to tell you,

45
00:02:34.841 --> 00:02:38.440
I will never forget how fucking disappointed I was when I ate the chicken.

46
00:02:38.441 --> 00:02:40.140
It was so fucking dry.
Yeah.

47
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.293
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

48
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.940
<v 1>Tell you everybody talks shit.
Ah,

49
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.060
Go fucking do it.

50
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.351
I got it.
Oh,

51
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:54.420
I should have Nia here for this cause that's another one too.

52
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:56.070
They always telling me how good soul food is.

53
00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:57.900
I've been to one good soul food place.

54
00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.770
That's the same thing with like barbecue too.

55
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.780
Everybody Raven above fucking barbecue.

56
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:05.530
90% of those things are absolute shit holes.
You walk in there,

57
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:09.640
you see like 50 health code violations is fucking flies and stuff.

58
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.160
<v 3>Okay.</v>

59
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.670
<v 1>And then they just,</v>

60
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.880
they try to disguise all their fuck ups with like fuck it and you know,

61
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.680
10 pounds of barbecue sauce.
I mean you put barbecue sauce on a tree branch,

62
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:23.290
it's going to fucking tastes good to some level.
Right?

63
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.403
<v 3>MMM.</v>

64
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.590
<v 1>I found that all,
you know,
trying to,
you know,</v>

65
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.310
you want the reality is is I don't know shit about barbecue.
So it's just like,

66
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:34.880
you know,
if you don't know shit about standup,

67
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.450
you're going to watch a bunch of hacks before you get to a good one.

68
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:41.170
So maybe that's what it is.
I have no idea.
I have no idea.

69
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:43.090
The one place soul food place that I want that.
Actually,

70
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.610
I went to Amy Ruth's a long time ago and I liked that.

71
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:49.600
I thought that that was quality.
All right.
So I know it has to be out there.

72
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.660
I mean,
God knows if you want to get a good fucking corn beef sandwich,

73
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:55.900
I know the go down to Tom Bergen's here in fucking la.
Right?

74
00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.790
I know where to go for that shit.
So somebody helped me out.
They in La,
where's,

75
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:03.670
where's,
where's a good spot for all of that type of stuff because I've,

76
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.040
I can't say it because it would be sacrilegious,

77
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.220
but I've gotten the most famous fucking,

78
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.963
<v 3>mmm,</v>

79
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.590
<v 1>I guess soul food place out here.
There's two locations.</v>

80
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.330
And I went to both of them and the food.
Absolutely.
Without a doubt.

81
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.650
No questions.
Landslide fucking sucked.

82
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.260
And I was like,
why is there a God?

83
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.440
Why is there a fucking line around the block for this shit?

84
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.380
It's terrible to has to be,

85
00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:35.370
this has to be the spot that only guys like me know about.
Right.

86
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.350
And then everybody else is going to the real place.

87
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.973
<v 3>MMM.</v>

88
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.420
<v 1>That was a fucking left turn.
I think you only get barbecue,</v>

89
00:04:42.421 --> 00:04:45.630
I think I ever really enjoyed was when I was in Alabama and there was a place

90
00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:50.130
called a US smart ass Wilson.

91
00:04:50.131 --> 00:04:54.490
It's still stood for and that shit was fucking delicious.
You go in,

92
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.640
the place was clean,
you know?

93
00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.490
And they always have to have it be a little bit funky.
It kind of looks like,

94
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:03.060
do you guys build hot rods here or are you be you making a fucking,
you know,

95
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.700
brisket,
you know,
fucking pisses me off those.

96
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.930
Have you watched the food network and you watch those professionals doing it?

97
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.550
I'm always screaming at the TV.
Where do you,
where the fuck is your restaurant?

98
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.930
<v 3>Okay.</v>

99
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.450
<v 1>I don't want to sit here and watch you cooking all this shit that I can't</v>

100
00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:24.210
fucking eat.
I mean it's works of art.

101
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:25.783
<v 3>You know,</v>

102
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.070
<v 1>pill.
Make Barbecue of some fat motherfuckers though.
You gotta admit that,
right?</v>

103
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:32.560
Just big fuck.
They literally,
they drive trucks.

104
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.793
<v 3>MMM.</v>

105
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.300
<v 1>Anyways,
this is just making me hungry.
Speaking of which,</v>

106
00:05:39.301 --> 00:05:41.310
I've been eating like shit.
You know,

107
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.250
I know it's going to fucking tell you something.
I going,

108
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.800
what the Hell is talking about?
I start talking about fucking dry chicken.
Okay,

109
00:05:48.801 --> 00:05:51.050
so fuck right.
Does it really matter?
I'm just checking in on you.

110
00:05:51.051 --> 00:05:52.430
This is really isn't even a podcast.

111
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.000
<v 3>Um,
anyways,
what</v>

112
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.210
<v 1>did I want to talk about?
Oh yeah,
so he give you the update on my,
uh,</v>

113
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.700
now fuck that.
I'll do that later.
I,
um,

114
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:06.290
<v 4>okay.</v>

115
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.410
<v 1>I fucking drank so much the other night,
right.
I had some friends of mine,</v>

116
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.770
they were at this bar and they texted me going,
hey man,
we're out here drinking.

117
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:16.340
Right?
And I didn't want to drink.
She was really surprised.
I mean,

118
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:18.290
I always want to drink,
but I knew I shouldn't,

119
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.330
something in my head and my big stupid Charlie Brown head said,

120
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:27.290
don't go to the bar.
Right.
So I just,
you know,
they're like,
yeah,

121
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:30.710
we've been day drinking,
we're already here,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.
I'm just like,
okay,

122
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:33.020
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
whatever.
Right.
I'm not going to Wa

123
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.620
<v 4>yeah.</v>

124
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.460
<v 1>And now,
you know,
I got a set tonight.
They're like,
yeah,</v>

125
00:06:36.461 --> 00:06:40.300
we'll right up the street.
Hit us up after.
And I was just like,
okay.

126
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.180
And that was just hoping they were going to be totally hammered and forget.

127
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.580
And I went down to the comedy store.

128
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.270
I've been doing sets all week because I got those huge shows this weekend.

129
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.320
And um,
I went up,

130
00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:59.300
I had a fucking great set,
got all this new shit,
really excited about it.

131
00:06:59.301 --> 00:06:59.601
You know,

132
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:03.710
cause I did just do a Gig in downtown La and one of my gigs is out in Riverside.

133
00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:04.910
The other ones in Orange County.

134
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.640
My agent's telling me this is a completely different market,

135
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.540
completely different fireplace,
a little,

136
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.030
and I'm just worried that somebody from the show,
New Year's is going to show up.

137
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:15.740
So I gotta make sure I got a new 15,

138
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:19.970
20 so they don't be looking at those same shit.
Right.

139
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:22.670
Like I'm supposed to write a brand new ACA,
90 fucking days.

140
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.800
It's not even 90 days,
you know.
So anyways,
um,

141
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.320
<v 4>okay.</v>

142
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.770
<v 1>I'm working on that shit.
And the second I get off stage,
I have a text,
hey man,</v>

143
00:07:32.771 --> 00:07:36.190
you offs you offs offstage yet,
but right down the street.

144
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.440
So like a fucking asshole.

145
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:39.610
<v 4>Okay.</v>

146
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.410
<v 1>Don't listen to my gut.
I go down there,
right.</v>

147
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.910
And I show up and it's everybody that I like to drink with and I'm like a fuck.

148
00:07:45.911 --> 00:07:49.990
And I'm driving,
right?
So I go,
I'm going to have one whiskey,

149
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.300
I'm going to nurse it and that's going to be it.
Okay.

150
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.720
And I sipped it and it tasted fucking delicious.
And I literally looked at it,

151
00:07:56.721 --> 00:08:01.450
another comic Hosea.
I go,
why does it taste so good?
And he just laughed.

152
00:08:01.451 --> 00:08:05.890
He goes,
it tastes better every year.
And that's kind of the last coherent,

153
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.920
like part of the night that I remember I sucked at one down and then the

154
00:08:12.281 --> 00:08:16.770
waitress came by and she goes,
hey,
gay gay,
right?
How's Hey your house?

155
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.710
And I was,
she didn't say,
you know,
she was actually,
you know,
completely,
uh,

156
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.210
probably probably did better in school than I did.

157
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.110
And I'm making fun of her because I'm set with the answer that I gave her.

158
00:08:26.111 --> 00:08:30.130
I said yes,
as my brain's going,

159
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.640
don't do this bill.
Don't do this.
The second you get the second one,

160
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:38.350
now you have to fucking take a taxi home and you've got to leave your car here.

161
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.220
Don't do that.
Just fucking relax.
You know,

162
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.080
you're really just here for the social thing.

163
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:47.170
Just have a water and talk to the fellas.
Right.

164
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.540
So that's what I'm thinking.
And my brain just goes,
yes,
my mouth goes,

165
00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:55.500
I would like another job.
And then that was it.

166
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.700
And then I just looked at everybody go,
well I'm not driving now.
And they go,

167
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:03.130
yeah,
yeah,
you're not driving.
You're not driving.
And then that was it.
And um,

168
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.830
I don't know what the fuck happened.

169
00:09:06.831 --> 00:09:11.831
And somebody told the fucking story about this drink called the John Riley and I

170
00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:16.530
kept thinking it was like the actor John C.
Reilly.
So I kept picturing his,

171
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:22.370
his face as the guy was telling the story and I'm going like John see rallies

172
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:27.900
got is already has a drink named after him.
And that's,
that's like the,

173
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.680
like the bar version of winning like the Mark Twain Award.
Right.

174
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:38.160
I'm like,
good for John.
And it wasn't till he got like halfway through the story,

175
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:40.680
I realized he was just talking about a guide.
John Riley,

176
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.130
Eddie deep fucking did something.
He fought one of one of those.

177
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.330
We don't have those wars that they never make a movie about the Spanish American

178
00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:52.370
war.
They never make a fucking movie about that in the Spanish American war.

179
00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.750
Wasn't that the one we fought in the fucking Philippines?

180
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.310
I always thought that that one was like with Sam Houston and Dave Bowie.

181
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.450
David Bowie,
now Dan,
Daniel Boone,
whatever the fuck his name is,
right.

182
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.520
They surrounded the Alamo.
Let's see this here.

183
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:11.490
Spanish American war.

184
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.330
What do you put home?
Game away game.
How do I look this up?

185
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.210
Server not found the fuck are you talking about?

186
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.270
They would again.
You motherfucker.
Don't don't do this to me.

187
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.770
All right,
this is,
this is how I fixed it.
I shut it off.
Shut off Wifi.

188
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.270
Turn Wifi back on.
That's like the fibrillating.
Your fucking,

189
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.300
I say that word right.
Come on.

190
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:42.150
I feel like Pachino and and he got so bad.
All right,
here we go.

191
00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:45.090
Spanish American war.

192
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.260
I think this was in the Spanish American war.
Wikipedia.

193
00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:50.490
God knows they're always right.

194
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.630
Spanish American war was a conflict between Spain and the United States.

195
00:10:55.650 --> 00:11:00.570
The result of the US intervention in Cuba.
Uh,
we've always been doing that.
Huh?

196
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.560
We are trying to make them free also.
All right.

197
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.720
Location,
Cuba,
Puerto Rico,

198
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.880
the Philippines in Guam.

199
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:17.130
Why don't they ever make a movie about that one?
I'm sure they did,

200
00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:19.920
but why don't they make one that's fucking known enough that I've seen it?

201
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.253
Hang on a second.

202
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.750
I know I've ever even read about this was a conflict in 1898 between Spain and

203
00:11:27.751 --> 00:11:28.411
the United States.

204
00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:32.730
The results of US intervention in the Cuban war of independence.

205
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.790
In other words,
you know,
we,
we,
we always have a dog.

206
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.620
We always have a dog in the fight.
You know what I mean?

207
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.340
You ever go to the fucking casino and there's that guy just fucking bet every

208
00:11:41.341 --> 00:11:45.210
game.
That's the United States.
We always,
we always got some action going,

209
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.410
you know,

210
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:50.460
walking around with their fucking Hawaiian shirt and a big cigar flip flops.

211
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.713
We're a mess.

212
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.840
US attacks on Pacific Coast Pacific positions led to the involvement in the

213
00:11:58.081 --> 00:12:01.020
Philippine revolution and ultimately to ultimately,

214
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.640
ultimately to the Philippine American war.
All right,

215
00:12:05.641 --> 00:12:07.980
let's click on that Philippine American war.

216
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.860
It fucking lasted for almost two over two years.

217
00:12:13.861 --> 00:12:18.580
1899 three years.
One month.
Oh,
I'm sorry.
Yeah,

218
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:22.740
that's three years.
Jesus.
Bill,
lay off the fucking sauce,
Huh?

219
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:24.903
<v 0>MMM.</v>

220
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.920
<v 1>All right.
Filipino civilians dead.</v>

221
00:12:28.921 --> 00:12:33.150
200 to 250,000 dead mostly from disease.

222
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.860
We lost four to 6,000 they lost 12 to 20,000

223
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:41.550
<v 0>okay.</v>

224
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.960
<v 1>We crushed another one,
Huh?
Jesus Christ.
We were on a tear back.
That was,</v>

225
00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.960
that's when we were really on a fucking tear.

226
00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:54.080
Conflict Arose when first Philippine republic objected to the terms of the

227
00:12:54.081 --> 00:12:57.680
treaty of Paris under which the United States took possession of the Philippines

228
00:12:57.681 --> 00:13:02.480
from Spain ending the Spanish American war.
Yeah.
They like,
dude,

229
00:13:02.481 --> 00:13:04.820
we want to be around people if you don't mind.

230
00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:09.950
And then we came over their land to their home for a land of the brave free of

231
00:13:09.951 --> 00:13:13.940
the home.
Whatever the fuck are our little tagline is.

232
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:19.460
And they probably scared up some guy named fucking Ulysses,
you know,

233
00:13:19.461 --> 00:13:22.580
scare the shit out of,
they're going to come over here to going to get you.

234
00:13:22.581 --> 00:13:26.150
They're going to get you fucking four wheeler.
Um,

235
00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.440
anyways,
once again,
don't even know how the fuck I got to that God damn thing.

236
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.630
Oh yeah.
So the drink,
it's called the John Riley.
All it is,
it's,

237
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.060
it's a fucking Margarita.

238
00:13:35.061 --> 00:13:37.190
And you take a shot at Jamison and you'd dump it in there.

239
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.160
And it had something to do with the fact that there was a bunch of Irish people

240
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.920
fighting on this side and they decided,
you know what,

241
00:13:42.921 --> 00:13:44.270
you guys are fucking using us.

242
00:13:44.271 --> 00:13:46.520
We're going to go fight on the side where the Latinos are.

243
00:13:46.521 --> 00:13:50.390
So that's the Jamison going over to the other fucking side.
Right?

244
00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:52.270
So now you've got whiskey though.
The bird,

245
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.910
the real tale of the tape here is now I got,
well,
what the fuck's in a,
in a,

246
00:13:55.911 --> 00:13:59.150
in a Margarita.
Okay.
I never drink.
Is that,

247
00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.380
is that Vodka Tequila?
I think it's Tequila.
Right?

248
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.790
And,
uh,
I fucking dumped that in there.
So now,

249
00:14:06.791 --> 00:14:08.650
now I'm on my third fucking whiskey.

250
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.250
I had already ordered another Johnny Black because it was a really long fucking

251
00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:16.970
story.
And now I'm three of those in,
I had a Jamison and then I had a fucking,
uh,

252
00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:21.250
a Margarita and a,
I believe I had one more after that grant.
I did all of this.

253
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:22.870
I swear to God it felt like 90 minutes,

254
00:14:22.871 --> 00:14:26.710
but I think it was about two and a half hours.
And,
um,

255
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:32.770
then I did the Irish goodbye,
which is,
I just hit me.
He's like,

256
00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:33.880
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

257
00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:35.820
And I didn't say goodbye to anybody and I just walked

258
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:36.683
<v 0>doubt.</v>

259
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.500
<v 1>They called my old friends La taxi.
That's who I always call.
I do not Uber.</v>

260
00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.870
I don't do Uber because I just,
you know,
you do Uber.

261
00:14:50.871 --> 00:14:52.390
It's gotta to be some young kid.

262
00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.780
He's in the fucking business and he's going to hedge you a fucking script or

263
00:14:55.781 --> 00:15:00.520
some shit,
you know,
and,
and eventually just say something really creepy like,
Oh,

264
00:15:00.521 --> 00:15:05.470
you live here.
You know?
But yeah,
you get in the cab that just like,
hello.

265
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.230
Yes.
Hello my friend.
They don't give a fuck.
They don't,
they have no fucking,

266
00:15:08.231 --> 00:15:10.780
you know,
they don't give a shit.
They're not trying to fucking do anything.
Right.

267
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.390
So I call La taxi like,

268
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.740
you know how many taxi have Ababa and I'm just like,
yeah,
just like,
yeah man.

269
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.440
And then there was just dead silence.
It in my fucking head.
It made,

270
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.950
they made me see,
made me think that they knew where the fuck I was at.

271
00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:31.030
I wasn't at the Ramada,
I'm not going to say what the fuck I was at.
Right.
So,
um,

272
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.350
then I was just standing there swaying in the breeze and then one of my buddies

273
00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:39.880
came down and his Uber pulled up and he just saw me and he saw the state I was

274
00:15:39.881 --> 00:15:42.700
in any,
just let me get in it.
So I got in the fucking thing.

275
00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:47.980
And like most streets in La,
they're the longest fucking streets ever.

276
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.100
You know what I mean?
Like last thing,
and again,

277
00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.550
it starts at the Hollywood hills and we'll just go all the way down to like the

278
00:15:54.551 --> 00:15:58.450
palace Verdi's peninsula.
Maybe that one doesn't,
but some of them do.
They like,

279
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.340
they're like fucking 20 mile long streets.
So you have the north side,

280
00:16:02.341 --> 00:16:06.160
the south side.
This guy started going in the wrong fucking direction.

281
00:16:06.161 --> 00:16:10.870
And fortunately I wasn't so drunk he would have dropped me off of the opposite

282
00:16:10.871 --> 00:16:15.490
end of the fucking,
you know,
fucking city or whatever.
And um,

283
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.330
so I go to bed,
I don't even remember going to bed.

284
00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.480
And then I wake up the next day I woke up at like eight in the morning with my

285
00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:26.470
dog fucking licking my face and I swear to God,
at eight in the morning,

286
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.420
I was still legally drunk,
legally drunk.
And I was just like,
oh my God.

287
00:16:31.421 --> 00:16:33.490
So I got up,
I walked the dog around the block,

288
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.000
I sat down and I just fucking,

289
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.050
it took me till about 10 30 to get my shit together and,

290
00:16:40.051 --> 00:16:43.990
and I just walked all the way back to the bar,

291
00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.170
the hotel area to get my fucking car.

292
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.880
Just a complete waste of a fucking day.
By the time I got home,

293
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.510
it was like one in the afternoon and I'm just muttering to myself the entire

294
00:16:57.511 --> 00:16:59.310
time going,
look at this bill.
Would you look at this?

295
00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.240
Look how many fucking times you got to learn this lesson.

296
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.930
And I would love to tell you that this is the last time I'm going to do

297
00:17:06.931 --> 00:17:10.980
something like that.
It's the last time for a while I was a bad one.

298
00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:15.540
That was a bad one.
But you know what was good was a,

299
00:17:15.541 --> 00:17:19.800
I sold off some of them as the shit from my garage and I gotta tell you,

300
00:17:19.801 --> 00:17:23.460
it felt good.
It made me want to get rid of a bunch of more on my shit.

301
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.850
Um,
I just got a ton of shit.

302
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.170
I don't know what that fucking and in order to do it,

303
00:17:28.171 --> 00:17:30.600
and I'm telling you when I say shit,
it's fucking shit.

304
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:36.480
Bunch of baseball hats and fucking all these books and shit and just,

305
00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.740
just stuff.
Got All this fucking shit and I'm sick of it.

306
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:44.010
It's all over the fucking place.
I don't use most of it.

307
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.510
So I'm,
I'm,
you know what,
I'm just going to,

308
00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:49.360
I'm going to get rid of a bunch of shit.
I think good.

309
00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.350
Where I'm going to start to do is every couple of days,

310
00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.400
how many to give something away or sell something on Ebay?

311
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:59.090
I literally want to get down to basically bare bones.
What the fuck do I use?

312
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.020
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

313
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:05.610
<v 1>You know,
I was thinking about that one on my long fucking walk of shame.</v>

314
00:18:05.611 --> 00:18:08.730
Back to my fucking car.
I saw this giant,

315
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.290
we didn't always Mayflower moving trucks just as jai,

316
00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.340
the biggest one you could possibly get.

317
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.910
Or they even have like in between the front and the back wheels,

318
00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:19.110
they dropped the backend,

319
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.900
the trailer down so they can even have shit down in there.

320
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.290
And I was just thinking like,
I never want to need one of those

321
00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.360
<v 3>ever.
Okay.</v>

322
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.470
<v 1>You gotta be that guy that can fuck up the next size up from the u haul van.</v>

323
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.090
That's what the fuck you need.
Right?

324
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:39.300
I want to be laying in bed.
So,
uh,

325
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.990
<v 3>yeah.</v>

326
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.630
<v 1>Oh Geez.
I got a ton of shit to tell you guys.
So I also,
I also want,</v>

327
00:18:43.631 --> 00:18:45.640
I looked at cars before my fucking

328
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.250
<v 3>like big,
uh,</v>

329
00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.850
<v 1>fucking booze fest and uh,</v>

330
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:57.320
I thought I finally found my car and uh,
I swear to God,

331
00:18:57.321 --> 00:19:01.460
I love the picture of it.
I went and I looked at the 2016,

332
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.193
<v 3>uh,</v>

333
00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:08.000
<v 1>Cadillac CTSV oh wait,
no,</v>

334
00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.540
the top of the line one,
whatever the one that,
the one,

335
00:19:10.541 --> 00:19:12.220
it basically it goes fucking,

336
00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:18.130
it goes 200 miles an hour and it's a four door sedan.
Right.
And I'll,

337
00:19:18.131 --> 00:19:21.670
all I'm thinking is that I'm just like,
all right,

338
00:19:21.671 --> 00:19:25.660
this is the fuck and this is the one,
it's exactly what the fuck I want.

339
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.840
I can't explain it.
I love the way it looks like in the picture.

340
00:19:28.841 --> 00:19:32.020
And then I went to go see it and it just looked like something that you'd buy if

341
00:19:32.021 --> 00:19:33.790
you were in,
like if you were in your twenties,

342
00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:38.490
if you could somehow afford it just with all the fins and the tail fin.

343
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.161
Of course.
I'm just like,

344
00:19:39.161 --> 00:19:42.070
I can't get in my driveway because the front ends to fucking low.

345
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.010
There's a little hump to get in my driveway.
And then they go and like,

346
00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.000
well you could back it in and um,

347
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.310
<v 3>okay.</v>

348
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.860
<v 1>I don't know man.
I just couldn't get past.
And then they were like,
yeah,</v>

349
00:19:52.861 --> 00:19:55.410
Justin Bieber bought one of these.
And I'm like,
yeah,
exactly.

350
00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:59.190
He should buy one of these.
If you could walk around shirtless,

351
00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:02.550
putting one my brow up and doing the kissing your two fingers in the peace
thing,

352
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.110
that's the fucking car for you.

353
00:20:04.111 --> 00:20:08.220
I can as an almost 50 year old fucking man walking that thing.
I got to tell you,

354
00:20:08.221 --> 00:20:11.520
I love the inside of it and it went like nine zillion miles an hour,

355
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.310
but I got to admit,
I fucking,
uh,

356
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:15.740
<v 3>okay.</v>

357
00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.640
<v 1>I realized while I was test driving the car that I am an old man and I don't</v>

358
00:20:19.641 --> 00:20:23.120
like going fast.
I just like cruising.
So

359
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:29.650
I looked at the other Cadillacs like the $54,000 fucking old man one,

360
00:20:30.371 --> 00:20:35.371
it was 54 fucking thousand dollars and I can not stress enough what an absolute

361
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:40.070
piece of fucking shit it was.
I could have put my foot through the fucking door.

362
00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:44.660
I literally left just like depressed.
I was just like,
you know what?

363
00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:48.010
Fuck this.
Fuck all of these fucking things.

364
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.830
I'm just going to keep driving my fucking piece of Shit Prius.
Right.

365
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:54.340
And it really is a piece of shit at this point.
Now the engine is fucking great,

366
00:20:54.341 --> 00:20:57.550
but like I've had all the dense take it out and everything,

367
00:20:57.551 --> 00:21:01.150
but it sat in the sun for fucking eight years.
It's been hit too many.

368
00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:03.790
It's punchdrunk my car is fucking punched drunk.

369
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.570
So last night I'm at the comedy store.
Oh,
by the way,

370
00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:12.130
the Lincoln knew Lincoln continentals coming out in August,

371
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.910
2017 and a,
it looks pretty fucking bad ass.
And it's just like,
you know,

372
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:18.920
I was talking to a comic last night and I was joking about how old I am that I,

373
00:21:18.921 --> 00:21:22.510
I like comfort over speed at this point.
And he goes,
oh yeah.
He goes,
you know,

374
00:21:22.511 --> 00:21:24.090
you're out here in la.
He goes,
what the fuck are you going?

375
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.250
What are you going to go the fuck are you gonna go?
You can't go anywhere.

376
00:21:27.251 --> 00:21:29.800
You want comfort,
you're going to be stuck in traffic.

377
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.400
Just drive around in the living room.
And it just totally made sense.
It's like,

378
00:21:33.401 --> 00:21:35.590
yeah,
that's what the fuck I want to do.
Then of course,

379
00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:39.940
I drive down to the club that night,
right?
And all of a sudden,
I swear to God,

380
00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.460
I don't know if every,
these are a bunch of tourists and they all rent,

381
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.420
rented the cars.

382
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.550
There was a fucking guy in a white corvette like 2016 corvette,

383
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:53.490
a guy in a fucking 2016 brand new fucking Ferrari,
spider,

384
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.260
whatever the fucking thing is.
And then somebody else with this,
you know,

385
00:21:56.261 --> 00:22:00.070
one of those BMW,
the m ones,
m three m five or something,

386
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:04.210
and they're all zigzagging or not a stop and go traffic revving the engines and

387
00:22:04.211 --> 00:22:08.860
all that shit.
The exact thing that my buddy was saying and I was going,
look,

388
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.770
look how I was thinking that I'd be thinking,
look how dumb that is.

389
00:22:11.771 --> 00:22:14.380
And all I was thinking was,
look how fucking great those cars look.

390
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:20.920
But of course everybody in them was 20 something,
you know,

391
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:25.810
the Yolo guys,
you Yolo doses,
right?
I mean,
I just have to fucking old,
right?

392
00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:28.790
So,
um,
anyway,

393
00:22:28.791 --> 00:22:31.880
so I went down to the store last night comedy store and I fucking a,

394
00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:36.310
I did a set once again and I wasn't really even funny last night.
I mean,

395
00:22:36.311 --> 00:22:37.480
I did a decent enough job.

396
00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:39.880
I've been doing it long enough where I can fake my way through my job,

397
00:22:39.881 --> 00:22:43.930
but I just kept having brain farts and all that cause I was still fucking hung

398
00:22:43.931 --> 00:22:46.570
over.
Right.
So,

399
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.690
and when I'm hung over and I'm kind of in a grouchy mood,

400
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.920
my shit goes from fucking silly to like,
dude,
is this like a meeting?

401
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:57.310
This guy sounds like an insane person.
And,
um,

402
00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:02.420
I got out of the club and I was walking to my car and,
uh,
uh,

403
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.260
this guy comes up,
he goes,
excuse me,
Mister [inaudible],
Mr. Byrd,

404
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.440
another reason why I shouldn't buy a fucking cool sports car.

405
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.360
When somebody pushing 30 calls,
you,
Mr.

406
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.880
It's tied to get yourself a Buick Riviera,
right.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

407
00:23:18.881 --> 00:23:21.850
You can't fight it.
He can't fucking fight it.

408
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.380
I am in my sport coat luxury car,
you know,
fucking years.

409
00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.310
I'm going to go fucking,

410
00:23:27.311 --> 00:23:30.940
I'm going to go online and buy an olds cutlass or something like that.
Um,

411
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.550
old cutlass is actually a cool coat.

412
00:23:33.551 --> 00:23:37.890
Am I talking about whatever the fuck in a delta 88 or some shit.
Um,

413
00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:44.020
so he comes up and he's with his girlfriend and he goes,
yeah,

414
00:23:44.021 --> 00:23:46.830
I just want to say,
you know,
I really enjoyed the show.
A big fan.

415
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.600
I got thanks for whatever.
And then his girlfriend just standing there.
She goes,

416
00:23:50.601 --> 00:23:55.370
yeah.
She goes,
I'm not a big,
she goes,
yeah,
I don't like you.
Right.

417
00:23:55.371 --> 00:24:00.200
Cause I was trashing the ladies,
right?
She goes,
I don't like you.
And I go,

418
00:24:00.201 --> 00:24:04.400
yeah,
okay.
I just went,
all right.
And then she goes,
no,
I like you.

419
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:08.900
And she goes,
I like you,
but,
and I'm like,
here we go.
Here we go.

420
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:13.700
It's just like we had just get on with fucking trash in me.
You know,

421
00:24:13.701 --> 00:24:16.550
that fucking female manipulation thing.
She said,

422
00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.110
I don't like you because she was expecting that I gave a fuck.
We got to go,

423
00:24:20.111 --> 00:24:21.020
what do you like me?

424
00:24:21.021 --> 00:24:23.540
And then she could tell me what part of my act she didn't like.

425
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.680
And guess what part it was only the shit about me trash a women.

426
00:24:27.681 --> 00:24:29.810
All the other stuff was perfectly fucking fine.

427
00:24:29.811 --> 00:24:32.390
I'm talking about drunk driving and going to Mcdonald's.
Right.

428
00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:33.950
She didn't have a fucking problem with that.

429
00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:38.120
All the hypothetically like innocent people during that joke that I could have

430
00:24:38.121 --> 00:24:41.720
fucking gotten in trouble,
you know,
could have run over.
Right.

431
00:24:41.721 --> 00:24:45.020
She didn't give a fuck about that.
So she looks,
she goes,
I don't like you.

432
00:24:45.021 --> 00:24:48.410
And I said,
I'll coach.
She goes,
no,
I like you.
And then like a fucking rookie.

433
00:24:48.411 --> 00:24:52.250
I stopped.
She goes,
but you shouldn't be trashing him.
And it's just like,
ah.

434
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.590
I hate to say I don't give a shit.
I don't give a fuck either.

435
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.810
Dead after this show,
heckling is my number one pet peeve.

436
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:03.860
I stood on stage for 20 fucking minutes,
right in your crosshairs,

437
00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:09.650
you know,
yell out something.
Then you don't say shit.
You just fucking sit there.

438
00:25:09.651 --> 00:25:14.510
And then after the show you come up to me in the parking lot and you ignore the

439
00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:17.170
30 topics.
I went,
I talked about those were,

440
00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:20.210
those were all fine and he'd just talk about the one that pertains to you.

441
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.490
So I just said,
you know,
I don't give a shit,
right.

442
00:25:22.491 --> 00:25:26.750
So I get in my fucking car and she,
but this point,
she was yelling at me.

443
00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.173
<v 3>MMM.</v>

444
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.900
<v 1>And this is hilarious.
She goes,
Oh my God,
I forget.
She was like,
man,
I have that.</v>

445
00:25:33.901 --> 00:25:37.240
I wasn't listening.
And she goes,
and you drive a fucking pray

446
00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:43.770
study yelled at me about my car.
Oh,
he's fucking hilarious.

447
00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:48.150
Fucking hilarious.
She,
when she yelled fucking Prius,

448
00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.930
she had turned around and cause she realized that wasn't going to listen to her

449
00:25:51.931 --> 00:25:54.390
bitch moaning,
complaining about my jokes.

450
00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.380
She had already turned away and she goes up fucking,
she'd throw her head back.

451
00:25:58.381 --> 00:26:02.470
She goes out fucking pres.
And uh,
what she,

452
00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:03.390
what she did there,

453
00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:07.560
she made me laugh harder than I probably made the whole crowd laughed my entire

454
00:26:07.561 --> 00:26:11.310
set in that moment.
So thank you to that woman.
And uh,

455
00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.850
you know,
other than that,
you know,
I don't know what to tell you.

456
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.790
Next time heckle me on stage and I listen what you have to say.

457
00:26:17.791 --> 00:26:19.680
That was a fuck a woman heckled.
Me and the crowd.
Oh,

458
00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.230
I'll tell you how to rough one,
you know.
Um,

459
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:29.520
yeah,
I don't know what the fuck to tell you.
Um,
all right.
Before I,

460
00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:34.350
before I end voice,
Start Doing some of these reeds here.
Uh,

461
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:35.790
what the fuck is it?
Yeah.

462
00:26:35.791 --> 00:26:40.791
Phife Dawg from tribe called quest passed away.

463
00:26:40.951 --> 00:26:44.800
Man.
I was one of the,
a casual fan of that.
You know,
I'm just too fucking white.

464
00:26:44.801 --> 00:26:46.690
I missed it.
I totally missed the boat.
You know,

465
00:26:46.691 --> 00:26:51.520
I saw Michael Rappaport's documentary on him and I'll just maybe feels like,

466
00:26:51.521 --> 00:26:53.520
how the fuck did I miss this shit?
Oh,
that's right.

467
00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:56.020
Cause I was listening to warrant.
Um,

468
00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.590
I have man that fuck it,
but I,

469
00:26:59.591 --> 00:27:02.260
even though I didn't listen to the band as much as I should have,

470
00:27:02.261 --> 00:27:05.530
it really forced fucking depressing.
Um,

471
00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:09.460
just cause I obviously had friends die at that fucking age from that shit.

472
00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:14.200
Complications from diabetes and all that.
So,
uh,
I dunno,

473
00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:19.270
that's just getting old.
Sucks.
Just fucking blows.

474
00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:24.370
45 years old.
How the fuck do you come to terms with that?
You know,

475
00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:27.760
why did I bring it up?
I knew it was going to be depressing.
All right,

476
00:27:27.761 --> 00:27:31.510
let's read some advertising.
All right.
Score big.
Uh,

477
00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:35.470
you're paying too much for tickets between all the markups and last minute

478
00:27:35.471 --> 00:27:37.900
convenience charges.
Oh,
by the way,

479
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.380
you know I asked this before,
how to fuck.

480
00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.870
Is there a way that I can sell tickets to my show?

481
00:27:43.871 --> 00:27:46.660
Just off my website and only fans will get them.

482
00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:51.970
Like what stops these people who go in and somehow cause they got the money,

483
00:27:51.971 --> 00:27:56.080
we'll go out and buy like 500 fucking tickets and then jack the price up and

484
00:27:56.081 --> 00:28:00.390
then everybody gives me shit on the Internet.
Go look dude,
you phony.

485
00:28:00.391 --> 00:28:01.240
You're not this phony.

486
00:28:01.241 --> 00:28:03.880
And then they show how much the tickets are for and the amount of times they

487
00:28:03.881 --> 00:28:06.820
call my age and going through what the fuck are we doing here?
And he's like,

488
00:28:06.821 --> 00:28:07.570
that's not us.

489
00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:10.420
That's those constant by a thousand tickets and then rape everybody.

490
00:28:10.421 --> 00:28:12.940
If anybody knows away.
You know what's hilarious?

491
00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:14.530
I think this advertising might be the way.

492
00:28:14.531 --> 00:28:18.220
I have no idea between all the markups that you know what these guys are doing.

493
00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.380
These guys are going to undercut stub hub.

494
00:28:20.381 --> 00:28:22.960
This is actually probably a good thing here.
All right?

495
00:28:22.961 --> 00:28:25.530
I'm not saying these guys aren't dirt bags too,
but you know what?

496
00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:29.140
You can't just have one dirt bag.
You know if you get to dirt bags,

497
00:28:29.141 --> 00:28:32.560
they start fucking going at each other and then you slide under the radar.
Right?

498
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.160
Anyway,
she paid too much for tickets between all the markups and last minute

499
00:28:36.161 --> 00:28:40.270
convenience charges.
Even print at home fees.
Question Mark.

500
00:28:40.271 --> 00:28:45.010
Exclamation point.
You can end up paying courtside prices for nosebleed seats.

501
00:28:45.011 --> 00:28:48.820
scorebig.com is here to change that.
Well,
well,
well

502
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:51.940
let's see.
Let's see you guys.

503
00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:54.400
You guys check this thing out and let me know if this is legit.

504
00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:59.800
Did you know that 40% of all live event tickets go unsold and did you know that

505
00:28:59.801 --> 00:29:04.510
there's a place to get these seats at huge savings?
It's called score big.com.

506
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:05.910
<v 0>Okay?</v>

507
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:10.800
<v 1>In other words,
you bought up 40% of the tickets.
What do you mean they go unsold?</v>

508
00:29:10.801 --> 00:29:14.630
No,
they don't.
Well,
they don't,
this is all bullshit.

509
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:16.820
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

510
00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.040
<v 1>40% go.
One sold.
Yeah.
And then you want to do,</v>

511
00:29:19.041 --> 00:29:20.660
they probably would fucking cancel the show.

512
00:29:20.661 --> 00:29:25.380
The acts not making the venue any money.
All right.
You know what I,
I'll,
I'll,

513
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.600
I'll,
I'll suspend disbelief here.
You know,

514
00:29:27.601 --> 00:29:30.630
considering Batman versus Superman is going to be coming out this week and

515
00:29:30.631 --> 00:29:34.260
you've got to suspend all that disbelief that a guy from another fucking planet

516
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:39.380
that can fly and bullets barn off this bounce off his chest is going to have a

517
00:29:39.661 --> 00:29:44.050
fucking fight against the,
uh,
human being who has a fucking utility belt,

518
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.333
<v 0>right?</v>

519
00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.000
<v 1>Bullets bounce off his chest.</v>

520
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:53.260
What is Batman going and what does he have in his little fucking tool belt there

521
00:29:53.261 --> 00:29:54.400
that can fuck with that guy?

522
00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.410
If they really made this movie as real as possible?
Batman versus Superman,

523
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:04.000
it's going to go down like one of those old school Mike Tyson paper views.

524
00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.040
Remember that the fight would be over before the pizza showed up.

525
00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:08.500
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

526
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.750
<v 1>But you know,
somehow they'll don't fucking,
I don't know what they'll do.</v>

527
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:14.530
They'll keep it going.
I love how they're out of victims.

528
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.900
There are that like villains and now they have to fight each other.

529
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.600
You know what I mean?
Like what does that say about superheroes?

530
00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.690
You know what I mean?
I think that just they're just into fighting.

531
00:30:22.691 --> 00:30:25.780
They don't give a fuck whether somebody's good or bad.
They just,
they just need,

532
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:30.280
they need to fight somebody and then when they stop all the crime and they think

533
00:30:30.281 --> 00:30:33.790
they're going to relax and get themselves to the new 2017 Lincoln continental,

534
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.280
you know,
maybe chill on the whole flying and all that stuff.

535
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.810
Get themselves some adult clothes,
right?
What do they do?

536
00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:43.630
They start fighting each other.
Fucking animals.
All right.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:08.830
You come home after a long exhausting day at work and all you want to do is slip

559
00:32:08.831 --> 00:32:13.570
a glass slip,
slip,
slip a quarter,
my Cosby sip a glass of wine.

560
00:32:13.571 --> 00:32:18.010
Slip a fucking roofie in somebody wanting sip,
a glass of wine and relax.

561
00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.060
But unless you've planned ahead,
you probably don't have a bottle in your house.

562
00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.780
And getting up and going to the store is not happening.
Uh,

563
00:32:25.781 --> 00:32:29.710
with club Debbie happened when a Red Tab,
I'm on the red tag team.
You can,

564
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:34.900
you can finally relax because you'll never have to worry about being wined free

565
00:32:34.901 --> 00:32:37.450
again to Debbie.
Embedded in Jab Jab,

566
00:32:37.451 --> 00:32:41.790
couldn't make it through the primaries is a new wine club that sends you wine

567
00:32:41.791 --> 00:32:45.960
directly to your door,
saving you all those trips to the grocery store.

568
00:32:45.961 --> 00:32:49.500
Not only does club Debbie,
you're going to stop chair.
And one more time.

569
00:32:49.501 --> 00:32:52.650
Praise and evil doers.
Send your wine,
said you wine,

570
00:32:52.651 --> 00:32:55.470
they'll send you wine that you'll love drinking club.
Debbie,

571
00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:58.440
let me introduce you to my older brother,
older brother Jim.

572
00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:03.630
He's not as good as me.
Easy six question quiz figures out your palate.

573
00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:07.710
So every bottle you receive is perfectly tailored to your tastes club.
Debbie,

574
00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.900
you still ain't be an alcoholic.
Now I can speak Spanish.

575
00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.410
Works directly with the vineyards to cut out the middlemen,

576
00:33:13.411 --> 00:33:16.260
which saves you money.
Club.
Debbie,
I got no more George Bush.

577
00:33:16.261 --> 00:33:20.970
George even offers a no risk guarantee that you'll love what they said you call

578
00:33:20.971 --> 00:33:25.700
to action offer right now.
Club Debbie Club.
Debbie,
you knew what I was in 2000.

579
00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:28.260
He's still reelected me in 2004.
How dumb are you?

580
00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:32.190
Is offering listeners $20 off your first order when you go to club Debbie,

581
00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.020
Dick Cheney really ran the whole thing.

582
00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:37.300
Dot Com slash burn and yet it gets even bad,
Huh?

583
00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:38.820
<v 3>Okay.</v>

584
00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.470
<v 1>I know you all hate paying for shipping.</v>

585
00:33:40.471 --> 00:33:45.010
So club Debbie will actually pay for your shipping on orders of four bottles or

586
00:33:45.011 --> 00:33:48.690
more.
So take something off your to do list.
Just go to club w.

587
00:33:48.691 --> 00:33:51.720
Dot com slash bird to get $20 off your first order.

588
00:33:51.721 --> 00:33:56.550
Now it's club bibby.com/bird fool me once.

589
00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:03.090
<v 3>Shame on you.
Fool me
twice.</v>

590
00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.080
You're not going to fool me gear.
Um.

591
00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.480
<v 1>All right.
Is that the fucking podcast here for this week?
Uh,
yes.</v>

592
00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:12.910
I believe checking in on you.
The all checking in on your podcasts.

593
00:34:12.911 --> 00:34:15.910
Let me guys let me know.
Um,
I know his shit on that sponsor a lot.

594
00:34:15.911 --> 00:34:19.740
They're probably not going to advertise with me anymore,
but you know,
Yay.

595
00:34:19.741 --> 00:34:21.340
You know,
Shit happens.

596
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:26.390
<v 3>Um,
the fuck do I just have a socket here for</v>

597
00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.000
<v 1>anyways?
Yeah.</v>

598
00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:35.010
So I'm going to start selling some shit on Ebay and I was actually thinking that

599
00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:37.150
this is not much,
I want to start to sell one shit.

600
00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:41.020
I was thinking of fucking taking my truck out to my shows this weekend and just

601
00:34:41.021 --> 00:34:45.880
bringing a bunch of shit in the back.
It just,
just shit,
you know,

602
00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:48.120
Shit.
To me,
somebody else might like it,

603
00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:51.250
the end of the show just fucking given it to people,
you know,

604
00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.130
just getting it out of here and then somebody else takes it and they like it

605
00:34:54.131 --> 00:34:56.290
because if I throw it out and ends up in the fucking ocean,

606
00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.680
but if I fucking just give it to somebody,
they can keep it in,
in their,

607
00:34:59.681 --> 00:35:03.820
in their bedroom or in their fucking living room away from the poor purposes.

608
00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:05.403
<v 3>MMM.</v>

609
00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:08.420
<v 1>I know.
It's just an idea.
Just an idea.</v>

610
00:35:08.421 --> 00:35:11.780
I've decided I'm going to start with the fucking closet in my,
in my bedroom.

611
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:16.220
I'm just going to go in there.
I want to,
I'm going to tab to fucking piles.
Shit.

612
00:35:16.221 --> 00:35:21.050
I need shit I don't need and um,
I'm going to write it on a post.

613
00:35:21.051 --> 00:35:24.080
It stopped being a sentimental bitch.
Get rid of this shit.

614
00:35:24.081 --> 00:35:27.770
Whatever I need to do to just fucking plow through and get rid of all of this

615
00:35:27.771 --> 00:35:29.040
stuff because I'm

616
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.230
<v 3>okay.</v>

617
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.630
<v 1>I'm not,
I don't,
I don't,
I just don't want all this shit anymore.
All right.</v>

618
00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:34.040
That's it.
That's the podcast this week.

619
00:35:34.041 --> 00:35:37.930
You guys have a wonderful weekend and I'll uh,
talk to you on Monday.

620
00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:19.020
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

621
00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:39.800
<v 1>that is,
it built a bit of a dilemma here for you.</v>

622
00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.310
I'm an 18 year old male who's about to graduate from high school.

623
00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:45.790
Congratulations.
Um,

624
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:49.580
over the past few years I've been told I'm a really good dancer.
Uh,

625
00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:54.350
not ballet or artsy stuff,
but just good dance floor dancing.

626
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:59.960
Oh my God,
I'm going to take over the dance floor.
Hey,
Angie watched me yet.

627
00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.490
John Travolta.
This is great.

628
00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.300
Do you go out to the Staten Island Bridge and do headstands with your,

629
00:37:05.301 --> 00:37:09.860
with your buddy Bobby?
You know,
if he didn't have an Afro,

630
00:37:09.861 --> 00:37:13.220
he never would've fell off that bridge if you had it high and tight.

631
00:37:13.221 --> 00:37:17.430
Like all these Armenians out here,
all,
every Armenian looks like they know,
uh,

632
00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.120
they know,
um,
um,

633
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:24.280
MMA moose last time you saw an arm Armenian dude in his twenties or thirties,

634
00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.980
and he did not look like he could put you in an arm bar within two seconds if

635
00:37:27.981 --> 00:37:31.200
you want it to.
If I were,

636
00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:36.220
if I was a Dana white and I was running the UFC at one point,

637
00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:38.510
that this point where they're up to like what?

638
00:37:38.511 --> 00:37:42.960
Like UFC 2006 you know,

639
00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:46.490
they like running,
they've run out of adjectives this time.
It's really,

640
00:37:46.491 --> 00:37:49.580
really personal,
right?
Not Saying I'm not a fan,
I'm a huge fucking fan.

641
00:37:49.581 --> 00:37:51.680
I'm just saying,
you know,

642
00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.880
the way that they have those things like every other week and there's only so

643
00:37:55.881 --> 00:38:00.420
many like,
you know,
redemption.
I mean you've running out of words.
Um,

644
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.350
I'm such a fucking idiot.

645
00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:07.070
This is what I would do if I was dating white at some point I would have,

646
00:38:07.071 --> 00:38:09.110
you know,
you know what I would,
this is what I would branch off.

647
00:38:09.111 --> 00:38:12.500
And when they had those tough man competitions and they would have just people

648
00:38:12.501 --> 00:38:15.690
coming in,
throwing haymakers,
which is some of the best boxing Everest,

649
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.100
when you watch people who just aren't trained whatsoever and they just start

650
00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:21.590
because somebody is going to connect,
right.

651
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:25.970
I think that they should have one week they should have the Armenians verse the

652
00:38:25.971 --> 00:38:29.810
Russians tough man competition.
Because I really think that that needs,

653
00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:34.460
it needs to be decided.
Who is the tougher of the two,
uh,

654
00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:38.020
cause up one night when it comes to white people.
That's,

655
00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:41.300
that's who I got my money on.
All right.
That,
those,

656
00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:46.130
those are the crips and the bloods of white people is the army and the Russians,

657
00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:50.960
all of them.
They just have that vibe,
that something you just like.
Yeah.

658
00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:55.040
I'm not fucking with that guy.
Just really,
I'm really not doing it anyways.

659
00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.280
Uh,
not a ballet or artsy stuff.
Uh,

660
00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:02.640
but just ballroom dance in a full contagion over here.
Uh,

661
00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:07.160
I kind of think of think dancing is gay from an outside point of view.

662
00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:12.680
Um,
I,
I it isn't,
it really isn't,

663
00:39:12.681 --> 00:39:14.360
that's just how white people look at it.

664
00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:18.020
It's considered gay cause it involves like letting yourself go and actually

665
00:39:18.021 --> 00:39:22.970
admitting that you have emotions as a man,
as a white male.
Yeah.
Can,
yeah,

666
00:39:22.971 --> 00:39:26.020
it is.
It's considered gay.
Um,

667
00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.040
as his crying,

668
00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:33.370
as is showing any sort of emotion as is not dying for no good God damn reason

669
00:39:33.741 --> 00:39:37.670
before you're 56,
um,
oh,
not dying.
I should say,

670
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:41.390
if you live to be 60,
I believe amongst white men,
that's also considered gay.

671
00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:44.260
Cause that means at some point you cried something out of your chest and he

672
00:39:44.261 --> 00:39:47.720
didn't have a heart attack.
Um,
anyways,
he says,

673
00:39:47.721 --> 00:39:50.660
I think dancing is gay from an outside point of view,

674
00:39:50.661 --> 00:39:55.100
but I'll be the first one to admit that I'm actually a pretty good dancer if I

675
00:39:55.101 --> 00:39:58.160
didn't think so,
I wouldn't be out there doing it.
Yeah,
but dude,

676
00:39:58.161 --> 00:40:03.140
you gotta be getting some.
I'll,
I'll fucking women love a guy who can dance.

677
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:07.130
Dude,
if you could dance and you're wearing like a silk scarf,
it's fucking over.

678
00:40:07.131 --> 00:40:10.100
It's going to be rain in Pussy.
As far as my outside view,

679
00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:14.570
my freckled view from over in the bar trying to stand out from underneath those

680
00:40:14.571 --> 00:40:17.360
hot lights so I don't get burned.
Uh,
you know,

681
00:40:17.361 --> 00:40:21.080
red heads were the closest thing to vampires.
You know,

682
00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.300
we have,
we have none of the powers of vampires,

683
00:40:26.301 --> 00:40:28.220
but the sun affects us the same.

684
00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:31.830
<v 3>Okay.</v>

685
00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:33.930
<v 1>A friend of mine who was a female dancer,</v>

686
00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:38.880
keeps telling me I could make money doing it on commercials or music videos.

687
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:43.650
Parentheses close on.
Or You could go to fucking Broadway.

688
00:40:43.651 --> 00:40:48.600
It'd be like one of the five straight men who dances on Broadway and just tag

689
00:40:48.601 --> 00:40:52.890
every fucking lonely chick out there who's all stretched out.

690
00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:57.240
Just make sure you keep those shoes on.
Dancers' feet are always fucked up.
Uh,

691
00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:00.570
here's where it gets complicated.
I plan on becoming a policeman.

692
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:04.680
Oh Dude,
this is,
this is a no brainer.
You need to dance it.

693
00:41:04.681 --> 00:41:08.610
Bachelorette parties dressed as a cop.
All you need,
dude,

694
00:41:08.611 --> 00:41:12.240
is that a big uniform on a boombox and you're on your way to make him money?

695
00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:17.070
Dude,
you should fucking do that in a second.
And then you write a book about it.

696
00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.790
I was a GI rate and cop for Bachelorette parties.

697
00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:24.050
You write a tell all book about how many fucking broads,

698
00:41:24.051 --> 00:41:27.000
who bought ready got married,
get married,
sucked your Dick.

699
00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:29.970
You really need help on this one.
I mean,
I'm going to read the rest of it,

700
00:41:29.971 --> 00:41:32.430
but I think I've already come with the solution anyways.

701
00:41:32.431 --> 00:41:35.010
How is anyone to take me seriously on the force?

702
00:41:35.011 --> 00:41:39.270
If there's a video going with me,
pop and locking next.
A little Wayne.

703
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:42.480
At the same time,
I'll,
dude,
you should fucking pull people over.

704
00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.310
You should pull people over and fucking moonwalk up to their car and just freak

705
00:41:47.311 --> 00:41:49.770
them out.
Even if they were reaching for a gun,

706
00:41:49.771 --> 00:41:51.850
they'd be laughing too hard and they,
they,
they wouldn't shoot you.

707
00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:54.270
Then you could rest them and then you move up.
Next thing you know,

708
00:41:54.271 --> 00:41:59.160
you're a commissioner.
Alright.
Nothing anyways,
at the same time,

709
00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.410
I'm getting laid a lot because of it.
Of course you are.

710
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:06.690
I'm a seven on a scale of 10.
I like this guy.
He's honest and um,
uh,

711
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:11.130
and like having a jump shot.
It's put me up to an eight five.

712
00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.930
I'm bang and tense.
I've always wanted to be a cop at the parks here.

713
00:42:15.931 --> 00:42:19.710
Seen better if I was able to make money doing it.
Other than the dancing thing.

714
00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:25.100
I wouldn't just be getting Hummerus for letting gross moms off on speeding

715
00:42:25.171 --> 00:42:29.850
tickets.
I could be bagging J lo.
She's into dancers.
Right?

716
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:35.030
Thanks.
Yeah,
Dude.
Apps a Fuckin lutely
dude.

717
00:42:35.031 --> 00:42:38.150
You're basically saying,
what should I do here?

718
00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:44.590
Should I bang j Lo's beat down at the club and make all this fucking money or

719
00:42:45.291 --> 00:42:49.100
should I take a job where I'm going to get shot at and,
and not be appreciated?

720
00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:53.210
You know,
I'll tell you every cop out there with dance,

721
00:42:53.211 --> 00:42:54.890
if they could as opposed to be a cop,

722
00:42:54.891 --> 00:42:58.520
I don't care if they had like seven generations in.
Dude,

723
00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:03.560
this is what I think of as far as like dancing.
I think if I,
if I

724
00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.800
like compare it to being a comedian,

725
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:11.870
oh the open mics would be getting a piece of cardboard and being on a subway

726
00:43:11.871 --> 00:43:13.580
platform,
making money that way.

727
00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:19.210
And then when you move up to hosting a show that would be addressed as a cop and

728
00:43:19.401 --> 00:43:23.060
you fucking dance it.
Bachelorette parties,
that's what you do on the side.

729
00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:27.950
That's like your fucking day job.
That bullshit.
And then during the day,
I,
yeah,

730
00:43:27.951 --> 00:43:29.510
I would try out for those.
Fuck,
I don't,

731
00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:33.890
did they make music videos anymore or fucking,
uh,

732
00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:38.780
I dunno.
I believe it or not.
I don't know how to climb the ladder as a dancer.

733
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:40.970
But dude,

734
00:43:40.971 --> 00:43:44.990
apps a fucking lutely if you can make money doing that shit.

735
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:51.120
<v 5>And then what the great thing is,
is once you get to a certain level to,
to,
uh,</v>

736
00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.710
make more money,
you don't want,
you got some credibility.
You can,

737
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:59.140
you always have the,
the fall back where you can teach a class they get,

738
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.781
you can be like,

739
00:43:59.781 --> 00:44:03.800
I dance for nine years and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and fucking banged every

740
00:44:03.801 --> 00:44:06.310
fucking brought on there.
And then if you'd like to not have,

741
00:44:06.311 --> 00:44:09.020
fuck the women in your cast while still not losing your job,

742
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:12.590
come on down the Frankie's 12th in Dade Studio,
whatever.

743
00:44:12.591 --> 00:44:17.570
Just you'll figure it out as you go in there.
And um,
yeah,

744
00:44:17.571 --> 00:44:22.430
absolutely.
Absolute fucking Luli.
I would definitely do it.
You want to do what?

745
00:44:22.431 --> 00:44:23.480
He wouldn't taken the time,

746
00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.313
<v 4>mmm.</v>

747
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.320
<v 5>To write in.
So your big fears should be whatever.</v>

748
00:44:29.321 --> 00:44:30.580
But everybody's big fear is like,

749
00:44:30.581 --> 00:44:34.200
what if I fucking go after this dream and I'm 30 and I'm sleeping on a Fuckin

750
00:44:34.201 --> 00:44:36.840
futon and it hasn't happened yet.
Well,
I got to tell you something,
sir.

751
00:44:36.841 --> 00:44:39.300
I'd been there.
I was there at fucking 34.

752
00:44:39.301 --> 00:44:42.870
I was still sleeping on a Futon in a fucking studio apartment that they called

753
00:44:42.871 --> 00:44:45.240
the one bedroom,
cause they slammed a fucking wall in there

754
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.470
<v 1>and put a door on it.</v>

755
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.070
And then one day I was trying to bang the girl upstairs who had the fucking

756
00:44:50.071 --> 00:44:54.360
apartment right above me.
And it was the exact same unit.

757
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:56.340
And hers was a studio,
but she had been there longer,

758
00:44:56.341 --> 00:44:59.220
so they never slammed a wall in there.
And I realized,
Hey,
wait a minute,

759
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:01.200
I'm getting fucked.
You know,

760
00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:03.720
I should go down there and try to get some money taken off of this.

761
00:45:03.721 --> 00:45:07.350
I should go down to the,
uh,
they're fucking me over rental board.
But I didn't,

762
00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:12.540
I said,
fuck it.
Just keep writing jokes.
Right.
So whatever,

763
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.220
oh,
you gotta do,
you just got to commit to this shit.
And,
uh,

764
00:45:17.221 --> 00:45:18.330
and then realize that,
you know,

765
00:45:18.331 --> 00:45:21.870
sleep on food tone when you're 30 is not the worst thing.
It isn't.

766
00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:24.810
You don't see when,
you know,
it's worse than sleeping on futons at 30,

767
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:28.590
sleeping in a king bed next to a fucking woman you're not really love with,

768
00:45:28.591 --> 00:45:30.900
but for some reason married and,
uh,

769
00:45:30.901 --> 00:45:34.110
you got a couple of kids and you've got a job that you fucking hate.
Okay?

770
00:45:34.111 --> 00:45:38.070
You'll be laying there fantasizing about fucking sleeping on a,
on a,
on a,
uh,

771
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.050
on a futon there.

772
00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:45.720
There's no risk when you go after a dream,
it's all fucking reward.

773
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:48.000
It's all going to lead to something good.
It always does.

774
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:53.330
There's a tremendous amount of risk to playing it safe and uh,

775
00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:58.560
that leads to unbelievable levels of regret,

776
00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.440
which is something else I've also experienced cause I'm an [inaudible]

777
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.333
<v 5>motherfucker.</v>

778
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:26.040
<v 4>I be happy.</v>

779
00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:30.450
<v 5>Surprise.
We're getting a divorce.
All right,
here's a new story.
All right.</v>

780
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:34.620
Hey Bill,
I know you have,
you aren't a therapist,

781
00:46:34.621 --> 00:46:38.610
but I think I just want to talk to anyone at this point.
So here goes,

782
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:40.560
I've been married for just under four years.

783
00:46:40.561 --> 00:46:43.260
To my wife who I dated for four years prior to marriage.

784
00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:48.090
I love being married and have said that to anyone that asks.
Since day one,

785
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.930
we own a nice house together.
We have three dogs,
pit bulls,
too.
Good man,

786
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:56.550
and both make a decent living.
I share everything in my life with my wife.
Uh,

787
00:46:56.551 --> 00:46:59.580
when something makes me happy,
she knows when I'm upset about something.

788
00:46:59.581 --> 00:47:01.220
I tell her,
uh,

789
00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:04.830
throughout the course of our relationship about once a year she would suddenly

790
00:47:04.831 --> 00:47:06.180
without warning,
say she,

791
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:09.840
she was unhappy and has been for months.

792
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:12.150
<v 1>Oh God.
Here we go.</v>

793
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:13.621
<v 5>Uh,</v>

794
00:47:13.621 --> 00:47:17.250
she says she has discussions with their mom who loves me and it's the sweetest

795
00:47:17.251 --> 00:47:22.251
woman alive and close friends about the things that make her unhappy by and

796
00:47:22.411 --> 00:47:24.660
never hear a word about it until it boils over.

797
00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:28.740
And she floors me with how unhappy she is.
Well,
that's not fair.

798
00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.610
All right.
We tried to work it out though.
Make changes.

799
00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:37.720
She would act like it was okay while it bottling it up again once,

800
00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:41.200
once the lid goes on the bottle,
there's no opening.
And again,

801
00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:45.220
each and every time she calls the unhappiness state of the Union meeting into

802
00:47:45.221 --> 00:47:45.940
session.

803
00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:49.210
I've always been completely honest in saying that I'm very happy with her.

804
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:52.990
I love our jokes and honesty and honestly enjoy spending time and Papa,
Papa,

805
00:47:52.991 --> 00:47:57.010
Jesus Christ to get to the fucking point.
All right,
last Wednesday.

806
00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.790
Here we go.
We had a good night together.

807
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:04.220
We went out for dinner and ice cream and laughed at about Alibaba,
Bob boss.

808
00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:08.300
So I thought I'd come home the following night in general,
great mood.

809
00:48:08.301 --> 00:48:11.950
And she told me she had talked to her mom and a friend and that they recommend

810
00:48:11.951 --> 00:48:16.900
that she talks to me.
I was confused
and Oh shit.

811
00:48:16.901 --> 00:48:21.550
About not being unhappy.
Uh,
anyways,

812
00:48:21.551 --> 00:48:22.810
I wanted anything to make her happy,

813
00:48:22.811 --> 00:48:25.450
but she told me she didn't think there was anything.

814
00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:29.710
It was very emotional as she finally mustered up the courage to say that we

815
00:48:29.711 --> 00:48:31.420
might need to get separated.

816
00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:37.530
I was floored and not in an almond asshole husband that sits around drinks,

817
00:48:37.571 --> 00:48:41.500
beer and watches football with his buddy way.
I love my wife.
We have free.
Okay,

818
00:48:41.501 --> 00:48:44.110
dude.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Uh,

819
00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:48.550
so the following day after much reluctance I get her to agree to try marriage

820
00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:52.060
counseling so we can work out our happiness do and I'm not giving you shit that

821
00:48:52.061 --> 00:48:54.490
this is,
you're pouring your heart out cause this shit just happen.
I understand.

822
00:48:54.491 --> 00:48:58.210
But for the sake of the listeners,
I got to fly through this.
Um,

823
00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:02.440
I get to agree with her.
I get to,
I get it.
Okay.
So the following day,

824
00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:06.100
it's like Lord of the rings here,
after much reluctance,

825
00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:11.050
I get her to agree to try marriage counseling so we can work out her
unhappiness.

826
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:13.240
I was willing to do anything at this point.

827
00:49:13.241 --> 00:49:16.390
I immediately scheduled an appointment with the counselor and was looking

828
00:49:16.391 --> 00:49:18.790
forward to having someone neutral for us to talk to.

829
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:22.030
Later that night we were laying in bed and I asked her if there was someone else

830
00:49:22.031 --> 00:49:27.000
in her life.
She said,
no.
Yeah Dude.
Oh Jesus.
Oh Jesus.
Uh,

831
00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:31.920
Jesus,
here we go.
We just went over the waterfall folks or where we,

832
00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:33.220
you know what it is not all in this story.

833
00:49:33.221 --> 00:49:36.820
We were hearing the waterfall and we've just looked at the other person in the

834
00:49:36.821 --> 00:49:40.990
raft with a panicked look on her face for that split second before we tried to

835
00:49:40.991 --> 00:49:41.651
desperately.

836
00:49:41.651 --> 00:49:46.480
But she literally try and paddle the fucking thing over to the Goddamn coast.

837
00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:51.730
Okay,
here we go.
We're going over.
I got a feeling we're going over.

838
00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.660
Um,
she said no,
there's no one else in my life.

839
00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:59.410
I asked her if she's ever been unfaithful in our relationship relationship and

840
00:49:59.411 --> 00:50:01.180
she adamantly said no again.

841
00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:06.400
Then she turned out the light and laid down to sleep five minutes later and she

842
00:50:06.401 --> 00:50:09.250
sat up and turn the light on a fuck.

843
00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:15.210
She told me she just lied to me and said that she had messed around with someone

844
00:50:15.551 --> 00:50:20.320
a year into our marriage.
And he writes in capital letters,
what period?

845
00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:22.570
The period fuck period.

846
00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:28.660
I probed her to tell me what messing around was as gotta.
At least
be a blowjob.

847
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:31.170
<v 0>Okay,</v>

848
00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:35.680
<v 5>ha ha ha,
ah,
fucking whore.
Um,</v>

849
00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:40.530
and after a minute of me guessing her silence told me that she went

850
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:42.460
<v 1>down on a guy she works with.</v>

851
00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:44.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

852
00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:46.260
<v 1>Swear to God.
I hadn't read this.</v>

853
00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:48.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

854
00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:51.850
<v 1>Oh,
if I was Versie right now what I say,
you heard me.
You heard me</v>

855
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:56.960
<v 5>a fucking creep.
I was furious and hurt.</v>

856
00:50:56.961 --> 00:51:00.470
Then furious again.
She cried and cried and said she was sorry.

857
00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:03.320
We cried together.
Dude,
you're a bigger man than me.

858
00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:08.930
While I tried to wrap my head around how she could possibly have done that to
me,

859
00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.020
I've had casual flirting with people over the years,

860
00:51:12.021 --> 00:51:15.290
but to act on something physically with someone other than your spouse's,

861
00:51:15.291 --> 00:51:16.790
completely disgusting.
To me,

862
00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:20.780
the worst part is I love this woman more than anyone.
She's been my og.

863
00:51:20.781 --> 00:51:23.330
Here we go again.
She's going to be best friend for the last eight years.

864
00:51:23.331 --> 00:51:24.560
She knows everything about me.

865
00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:26.340
<v 0>Okay.</v>

866
00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:29.610
<v 5>I want to hate her and make her sleep at her parents' house until we divorced,</v>

867
00:51:29.611 --> 00:51:33.030
but all I want to do is be near her again.
Yeah,
dude,
that's because,

868
00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:34.740
<v 0>okay.</v>

869
00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:38.070
<v 5>Yeah,
dude,
she,
she was in a hurry up offense.
That's what happened here.</v>

870
00:51:38.071 --> 00:51:41.400
So now your scamper and trying to figure out what the fuck is going on.
And she,

871
00:51:41.401 --> 00:51:43.980
you know,
she has an x three plays that she just called in the huddle.

872
00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:48.660
That's why this,
this is why it sucks to be you right now.
Um,

873
00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:52.740
one of my close friends tells me what I know is the right thing.
He goes,

874
00:51:52.741 --> 00:51:54.630
let it go.
Don't bother with counseling.

875
00:51:54.631 --> 00:51:58.500
What else has she done that you don't know about how he never trust her again?

876
00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:02.640
Bill,
is it possible for me to forgive my wife?
Am I wasting my time?

877
00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.000
<v 0>Okay.</v>

878
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.020
<v 5>Um,
also I find out who this guy is and I really wish I hadn't.
Yeah,
dude,</v>

879
00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:14.600
of course.
All I wanted to do was show up at the job,
beat the shit out of him.

880
00:52:14.601 --> 00:52:18.440
Like Ed Norton,
Pete's the blonde,
pretty boy up and fight club.
He writes,

881
00:52:18.441 --> 00:52:20.120
I wanted to destroy something beautiful.

882
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:23.960
My other thought is since this guy also cheated on his girlfriend,

883
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:26.630
who we still with,
um,

884
00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:29.540
he did it with my wife.

885
00:52:29.541 --> 00:52:33.980
I threatened to tell his girlfriend what he'd done but not actually do it.
Yeah.

886
00:52:33.981 --> 00:52:35.870
You don't want to do that that way.

887
00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:40.160
He live in fear of coming home and her knowing everything because I told her or

888
00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:42.680
he would try to beat me to it,
admit to it,

889
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:47.360
hopefully ending his relationship and getting terminal cancer and aids,

890
00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:51.890
terminal cancer and aids.
And you know what?
You still being a gentlemen,

891
00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:53.330
I still think that you're,

892
00:52:53.331 --> 00:52:57.110
you're handling this with class wishing terminal cancer and AIDS on this guy.

893
00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.170
Um,
I know you don't give a shit.

894
00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.790
Of course I give a shit but not occupy.
Uh,

895
00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:08.480
but I've got to occupy my mind.
So I thought I,
I,
I do it here.
Yeah.
Do,

896
00:53:08.481 --> 00:53:11.480
why would you think I don't give a shit?
You know,
I mean,

897
00:53:11.481 --> 00:53:13.970
I'm not a friend of yours,
but you know what I mean.
Give me a fucking break.

898
00:53:13.971 --> 00:53:16.790
This is horrific.
Um,
all right,
your first question,
Bill,

899
00:53:16.791 --> 00:53:20.390
is it possible for me to forget my wife?
Uh,
eventually you're going to have to,

900
00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:25.080
uh,
and or you're going to go on a fucking tear

901
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:30.900
<v 1>and you're going to meet some really damaged fucking women and they're going to</v>

902
00:53:30.901 --> 00:53:34.620
reinforce everything that you've now found out about your wife.

903
00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:38.380
So you can't do that.
You're going to go on a fucking,
uh,

904
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:44.070
hate fuck pussy spree.
That is,
yeah.
You don't want to do that.
Um,

905
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:49.200
he said,
am I wasting my time?
Yeah,
dude,
it's over.
She's not happy.

906
00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:54.090
She's not good at communicating.
Um,
she puts a lid on it,

907
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:58.530
you know,
until it boils over.
This is the deal,
dude.
You know what I,

908
00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:02.400
this is going to kill you.
All right,
well let's go with the positive.

909
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:07.260
You don't have any kids with her.
Okay.
You can just walk away.

910
00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:13.470
Okay.
We had a prop and there was a,
there's nothing we can do,

911
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:17.580
so he didn't make it.
You just fucking walk away.

912
00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:23.400
Just walk away.
It's over.
All right.
Um,
that's a good thing.
All right.
One thing,

913
00:54:23.401 --> 00:54:27.480
you've had a bunch of kids with his fucking,
this person who for whatever reason,

914
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:29.380
couldn't say that they will.

915
00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:31.890
I don't think that she wants you to wanting to fucking marry you.

916
00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:34.560
I think she ignores her feelings.

917
00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:39.090
She's actually having a fucking breakthrough right now while stomping all over

918
00:54:39.091 --> 00:54:42.660
your fucking heart.
All right,
well,

919
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:49.080
I dunno.
I Dunno.
I don't fuck her.
Give you a break,
dude.

920
00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:53.430
You fucking,
you loved her with all your heart.
You say a mother's a sweetheart.

921
00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:56.580
You got dogs.
You liked communicating,
dude.
You know something.

922
00:54:56.610 --> 00:55:00.150
You're like the fucking guy.
You're the guy.

923
00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:04.440
My girl wants me to be.
Every fucking woman wants a guy like that.

924
00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:07.020
You know guy who actually wants to be married,

925
00:55:07.021 --> 00:55:09.020
guy who actually comes home and communicates,

926
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.540
you know a guy who gets along with the mom and all that type of shit.

927
00:55:12.541 --> 00:55:14.940
You're a family man.
All right?
Unfortunately,

928
00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:20.400
you know you met the wrong person,
so forget that dude.

929
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:25.870
All right.
Forget it.
Forget it.
Fuck that.
Fuck that.
It's over.
Walk away.

930
00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:30.990
Walk away,
Dude.
Gimme a fucking bay.
You know what you talking about there?

931
00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:35.760
You're talking about like the amount of fucking shit she has to go through

932
00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:39.990
before she even learned how to just communicate or fucking emotions and the

933
00:55:39.991 --> 00:55:43.020
frustration of that's going to meet every once in a while she's going to blow

934
00:55:43.021 --> 00:55:47.520
somebody at work.
Are you wasting your time apps?

935
00:55:47.521 --> 00:55:51.420
A fuckin lutely.
Okay.
Apps a Fuckin lutely.

936
00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:56.130
And as far as like going there and trying to fuck over that other guy,

937
00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:59.160
that other guy is,
he's already,
you don't need to fuck him over.

938
00:55:59.161 --> 00:56:02.380
He's fucking himself over.
He's living it.

939
00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.200
He's living a life of misery.

940
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:10.040
That life is miserable to fuck around with the person that you with with

941
00:56:11.011 --> 00:56:15.300
somebody else.
That is a miserable life.
You know?
I Dunno.

942
00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:17.940
I think it's something that a lot of guys do,

943
00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:21.870
myself included back in the day and my twenties going into thirties trying to

944
00:56:21.871 --> 00:56:22.920
fucking,
you know,

945
00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:28.070
<v 5>figure myself out.
I live in that life,
that whole fucking double.
It's horrible.</v>

946
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:29.150
It's a fucking horrible thing.

947
00:56:29.151 --> 00:56:33.680
Then in the end I ended up alone and I heard a lot of people and I was a

948
00:56:33.681 --> 00:56:36.950
complete piece of shit.
So,
and believe me,
dude,

949
00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:41.760
it was a miserable and ended up meet with me on a fucking futon.
So,

950
00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:46.370
um,
yeah,
dude,
you're,
you're,
you know,

951
00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:51.830
don't become a piece of shit now.
Don't judge other women like that.
Just fuck it.

952
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:55.730
You know?
Yeah.
Get out of it,

953
00:56:56.300 --> 00:57:00.890
get out of it and just know that it's going to be a fucking a,

954
00:57:00.891 --> 00:57:01.430
I dunno,

955
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:04.490
it's going to be a hundred yards of pain that you never fucking dealt with in

956
00:57:04.491 --> 00:57:08.260
your life and you just got to go through it.
And,
um,

957
00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:14.720
I,
I would say the next time you get with somebody,
uh,
make,

958
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:17.600
you know you're going to get serious with somebody who would make goddamn sure

959
00:57:17.601 --> 00:57:20.200
that they know how to fucking communicate,
because that's,

960
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.760
that's a scary thing to get with a woman who doesn't know how to communicate

961
00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:25.700
because that's something that they're supposed to teach us how to do.
You know,

962
00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:29.600
in a way they make you better because you like,
oh,
I can just say,

963
00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:33.500
uh,
no,
I don't feel like doing that without fucking punching the wall.
You know,

964
00:57:33.501 --> 00:57:35.180
they do that set of cell you down.

965
00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:38.270
If you get with some psycho and she can't settle you down.
I mean,

966
00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:40.580
she's a,

967
00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:45.580
she's damaged Christie,

968
00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:08.330
no matter

969
00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:09.163
<v 4>what,</v>

970
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:17.700
<v 5>a 27 year old Virgin Jesus Christ.
Hey Billy,</v>

971
00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:22.800
I'd love to hear your humorous take on my pathetic situation.
First of all,

972
00:58:22.801 --> 00:58:26.100
dude,
let's work on yourself estate.
All right?

973
00:58:26.101 --> 00:58:30.390
You're already shitting all over yourself.
All right.
Hey,
watch this guy.

974
00:58:30.391 --> 00:58:35.200
Watch him shit all over himself.
I'm a 27 year old virgin.
Oh Geez.
Uh,

975
00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:37.350
that's what he wrote.
Now your first question is going to be,

976
00:58:37.351 --> 00:58:40.590
how the fuck did that happen?
Well,
to protect myself,
I'd actually preserve,

977
00:58:40.591 --> 00:58:42.600
prefer to keep my background is quite as possible.
Hey,

978
00:58:42.601 --> 00:58:45.630
I'm not trying to get you to write yourself out.
Here's what I can say.

979
00:58:45.631 --> 00:58:48.620
I come from a rich town inhabited by obnoxious con.

980
00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:52.830
I was always the weird kid and very socially awkward people hated me no matter

981
00:58:52.831 --> 00:58:55.800
how nice I was,
Jesus Christ.
Dude,

982
00:58:55.801 --> 00:58:59.910
are you like a superhero that's like the exact same background of like every

983
00:58:59.911 --> 00:59:03.810
fucking superhero movie,
isn't it?
It's probably cause nerds,
right?

984
00:59:03.811 --> 00:59:07.050
Those movies because they don't have to fight.
And all of a sudden you're like,

985
00:59:07.051 --> 00:59:10.650
what am I knew how to fly?
What if I could fly?
There was a guy who could save me.

986
00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:12.040
Um,

987
00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:17.040
and then they draw it and then nerds line up around the block to go see it.

988
00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:21.850
Did you see the new Spiderman?
Yes.
It's exactly the other ones.

989
00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:23.140
Um,

990
00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:26.890
I was always the weird kid and very socially awkward people hated me no matter

991
00:59:26.891 --> 00:59:30.670
how nice I was.
And eventually I came to hate myself and still do.

992
00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:36.250
I called it dude,
I fucking called it.
Uh,
he's shitting all over himself.

993
00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:41.280
Eventually it was discovered that I most likely have a mild case of Asperger's

994
00:59:41.591 --> 00:59:46.120
syndrome,
which is a mild form of autism,
which is way out of my league.

995
00:59:46.330 --> 00:59:48.850
Are you guys trying to make me look dumb?
I thought I did that.

996
00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:51.370
I achieved that by how awful.
I read out loud.

997
00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:58.940
Here we go.
That causes social ineptitude and Quirky personality traits.
Well,

998
00:59:58.941 --> 01:00:02.030
I would go find a hawker with Asberger's.
That's the first thing I would do.

999
01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:05.180
And you get the Fucking v off my back.
Definitely wear a condom.

1000
01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.640
See that's where my advice is going to be coming from.

1001
01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:12.540
You guys got some weird conversation in some ironic vehicle.
Um,

1002
01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:17.270
at least discovering this made me more of self aware and I've been able to clean

1003
01:00:17.271 --> 01:00:21.190
up my act over the last few years,
but I still have a lot of social anxiety,

1004
01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:23.570
shyness and very few friends.
On the flip side,

1005
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:27.560
I'm actually pretty decent looking,
have a decent job in a laboratory.

1006
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:28.580
These are fucking,

1007
01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:32.630
he's got to get bit by something radioactive and he's going to become a

1008
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:34.910
superhero.
Uh,

1009
01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.560
and I'm a certified commercial pilot and do volunteer work.

1010
01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:41.560
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1011
01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:46.210
<v 5>dude,
like you know something,
if,
if I was in the FBI,</v>

1012
01:00:46.211 --> 01:00:50.080
like so many fucking red flags just went up there.
Uh,
okay.

1013
01:00:50.081 --> 01:00:53.050
That's the set up now.
Now for the question

1014
01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.340
first,
what the fuck would you do if you were in my situation?

1015
01:00:57.341 --> 01:01:01.720
I told you I'd get a hooker with Asperger's syndrome and you guys could just
bond

1016
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:06.660
over that.
Uh,
I don't know.
Let me,
let me,
let me read all your questions.

1017
01:01:06.661 --> 01:01:10.020
I'm obviously kidding about trying to find a hook with Asperger's syndrome.

1018
01:01:10.021 --> 01:01:12.570
All right.
You couldn't find one that would be like needle in the haystack,

1019
01:01:12.571 --> 01:01:16.050
which you'd have to do is go to an escort service and requests that personally.

1020
01:01:17.170 --> 01:01:18.920
<v 4>Um,
I would think</v>

1021
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:25.500
<v 5>I'm looking for 36,
24 36 with Asperger.
Yeah.</v>

1022
01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:27.760
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1023
01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:32.260
<v 5>Hair color does not matter.
Yes,
I can hold,
um,
next.
If,</v>

1024
01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:36.760
if eventually everything I ever do make it anywhere with a chick.

1025
01:01:36.761 --> 01:01:38.920
Should I tell her upfront about my status?

1026
01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:42.400
I had this conversation a few weeks ago with a friend who has a lot of romantic

1027
01:01:42.401 --> 01:01:46.720
experience and she said it would be extremely obvious that I'm new to the game

1028
01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.250
and that withholding that information could itself be detrimental.

1029
01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:55.030
But I also know that if I do tell a chicken 27 year old virgin,

1030
01:01:55.031 --> 01:01:59.320
she will demand an explanation before going any further and it will send up red

1031
01:01:59.321 --> 01:02:01.840
flags for the most.
What do you do?
Belt.

1032
01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.750
Thanks for doing your awesome podcast and go fuck yourself.
All right.

1033
01:02:04.751 --> 01:02:05.584
This is what I would do.

1034
01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:07.430
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1035
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:12.050
<v 5>I would just start hitting on every check that fucking interest me and I would</v>

1036
01:02:12.051 --> 01:02:13.430
be just totally honest.

1037
01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:14.870
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1038
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:16.910
<v 5>Tell him,
tell her what your,
your,
uh,</v>

1039
01:02:16.911 --> 01:02:20.120
your situation is and you know,

1040
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:22.460
<v 1>if she doesn't accept it,</v>

1041
01:02:22.461 --> 01:02:25.880
then fucker let her walk and then you don't have to deal with any of the

1042
01:02:25.881 --> 01:02:27.140
bullshit.
You didn't know.
You just,

1043
01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:31.430
you just fast forwarded through a three year fucking horrific relationship.
Um,

1044
01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.860
I would just be up front with people.
I wouldn't open it with Ai.

1045
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:38.690
You have beautiful eyes and I have Asperger's.
I wouldn't do that,
you know?

1046
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:43.040
Um,
I would work on my self esteem.
I wouldn't talk shit.
You just,

1047
01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:45.440
you shit on yourself right out of the gate.
I mean,

1048
01:02:45.441 --> 01:02:47.780
obviously I knew you were going to do that when you said you were 27 year old

1049
01:02:47.781 --> 01:02:52.440
virgin and,
and you probably going to go that route,
but uh,

1050
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:56.360
think good thoughts about yourself,
man.
I know that's kind of like simple,

1051
01:02:56.390 --> 01:03:01.070
but you know,
you gotta like you got to amp yourself up a little bit,

1052
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:03.840
go out there and you know,
you don't have to go find the check.

1053
01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.970
He had drains but just go out.

1054
01:03:04.971 --> 01:03:07.640
You don't get to tell some girl you got fucking Asberger's syndrome.
You don't,

1055
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:11.990
why don't you just do that with somebody that you're really interested in,

1056
01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.880
but it's just want to go out and get laid.

1057
01:03:13.881 --> 01:03:15.440
Just go out there and start hitting on checks,

1058
01:03:15.441 --> 01:03:19.160
turning into a game so you don't have to deal with the pain of the rejection.

1059
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:24.260
Just be like,
all right,
I don't have the balls to to take the next step.

1060
01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:27.980
Whatever that step is.
Peeling yourself off the fucking wall.

1061
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:32.060
Striking up a conversation,
just saying hello to a pretty girl.

1062
01:03:32.061 --> 01:03:33.140
She walks down the street.

1063
01:03:33.141 --> 01:03:37.010
Just try to get over that fucking hurdle and give you permit yourself permission

1064
01:03:37.011 --> 01:03:39.680
to suck and you just,
you gradually build it up.

1065
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:40.940
It's like learn how to play guitar.

1066
01:03:40.941 --> 01:03:43.280
You're not going to pick it up and immediately be able to play all your songs.

1067
01:03:43.281 --> 01:03:46.730
You learned a couple of fucking cords,
you know?
Then your fingers hurt,

1068
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.350
right and you get frustrated,

1069
01:03:48.351 --> 01:03:50.600
but you keep coming back and eventually you can fucking play.

1070
01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.840
Pussy is no different.

1071
01:03:56.180 --> 01:04:00.710
That's what I would do.
Put The ass burger on the back burner.
Who knows?
Do it.

1072
01:04:00.711 --> 01:04:04.760
Maybe not as fucked up as you think you are socially.
You know what I mean?

1073
01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:06.560
Maybe you've got a sense of humor under there.

1074
01:04:06.561 --> 01:04:09.020
I think you do your shit on yourself in a funny way.

1075
01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:14.650
You don't spin it around that way.
Do you have any interests?
Go,
go to,

1076
01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:17.360
oh,
go to a fucking,
I dunno.
Whatever.
You know,
you fly kites,

1077
01:04:17.361 --> 01:04:18.470
go to some flying a kite,

1078
01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:21.290
<v 5>convince you there's gotta be some woman there also likes Kate's.</v>

1079
01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:24.560
I know that was an overly simplified things,
but I,
that's what I would do.

1080
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.983
All right.

1081
01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:32.260
And then when you go to like a hookup with somebody,
uh,
they,

1082
01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:34.860
you know Ajay yet,
tell him if you don't,

1083
01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:38.480
don't know what you're doing to watch a couple of fucking pornos,
you know,

1084
01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:41.270
you'll get the idea.
Actually,
no,
don't do that.

1085
01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:44.550
Don't do that because then you'll suck and start slapping them around.
Yeah,

1086
01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:47.870
don't do that.
I know what to tell you,
dude.
I write and get,
buy some books.

1087
01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:52.730
I say go buy some,
buy some books in that,
that,
uh,
that,

1088
01:04:52.731 --> 01:04:56.190
that part of the bookstore that,
you know,
if bookstores exist anymore going,

1089
01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.250
gone line has got to be plenty of information.

1090
01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:04.370
I bet if you literally looked up finger banging technique as you looked at how

1091
01:05:04.371 --> 01:05:07.190
to kiss,
I bet this is going to be reams of fucking information.

1092
01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:14.180
I've never done that cause I never had to.
Oh,
just kidding.
Of course I had,

1093
01:05:14.181 --> 01:05:17.790
do you think that I didn't wish that fucking information was around way back in

1094
01:05:17.791 --> 01:05:18.880
the day when he had no id,

1095
01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:22.860
just practice a kissing your fucking pillow and tried to overhear conversations

1096
01:05:22.861 --> 01:05:26.100
in the fucking high school cafeteria and tried to figure out what people were

1097
01:05:26.101 --> 01:05:28.670
talking about.
That's all I had to do.
You had,

1098
01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.140
you had the whole world at your fingertips,
you know,

1099
01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:35.790
so when you'd done in the laboratory working with radioactive shit before you

1100
01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.900
get bit by something,
you know,
once you go on and get late.

1101
01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:41.160
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1102
01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.340
<v 5>Before you learn how to fly.
All right.
All right.</v>

1103
01:05:43.850 --> 01:05:48.850
<v 4>[inaudible] wow.</v>
