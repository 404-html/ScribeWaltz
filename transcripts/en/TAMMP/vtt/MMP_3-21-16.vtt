1
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.000
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn.

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.310
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:09.720
March 21st,

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.490
2016 what's going on?
How are you this wonderful gloomy Monday where I'm at.

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.370
It's gloomy out here.
Chance of fucking shower,

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.540
which should be great.
You know,

7
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:25.470
because how it works out here in Los Angeles is we basically every three years

8
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:29.940
we get all of our rain for three years.
Essentially.
That is how it works.

9
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:33.330
And I know a lot of people think like,
oh my God,
that must be so wonderful.

10
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.370
You know,
you just wake up every day knowing the sun's going to shine.

11
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.720
It fucking drives you crazy after a while.
Um,
fortunately I travel enough.

12
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.940
I get on the road again.

13
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.860
Chickaboom took upon meat and Trump fans and some bone for that old guy.

14
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:51.570
What the,
what the fuck's Bernie Sanders?

15
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.830
He wants to take all the money from the fucking enrich and give it to the board

16
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:57.930
and Donald Trump,
he doesn't like Mexicans.

17
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.350
And Hillary's going to drive right between those two fucking lunatics.

18
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.050
Ah,
good Lord.
Jesus fucking Christ.
I haven't been watching it,

19
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:11.610
but I know that that's what's going to happen.

20
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.110
It all you broads out there who are fucking excited to finally get a fucking

21
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:20.760
clam into the fucking Oval Office.
Okay,
I understand.

22
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.680
I don't understand.
I'm not a fucking woman.

23
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:26.430
I don't know what it's like to walk by a construction site and have a bunch of

24
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:31.080
people communicate that they find me sexually attractive.
You know,
you know,

25
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:32.910
there is a positive way to look at that.

26
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.200
If you take away all the sexual assault vibe from it.
It's kind of a,
you know,

27
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.850
a nice tip of the construction cat.
You know,
I don't walk by and they go,
oh,

28
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.750
you funny motherfucker.
I get nothing.
I get nothing.
I get silence.
I get snickers.

29
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.120
Hey fucking Casper.
Right.

30
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:51.570
I may make fun of my lack of melody is a Melatonin pigment.

31
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.180
Melatonin isn't that fucking,
uh,

32
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.820
I forget that's a fruit and that's not the skin cancer.
Don't you need Melatonin?

33
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.480
Oh Jesus.
Who gives a fuck?
I'm just saying,
right.

34
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.580
Just because somebody has a vagina

35
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.230
doesn't mean because you also have a vagina that they are going to do what's

36
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:19.860
right for you.
Think about all the presidents that have had dicks,

37
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.470
which is far as I know,
has been all of them,
but you never know.
You never know.

38
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.760
You never know.
Back in the day there were no cell phone pictures,
right.

39
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.810
There was no video cameras.
You had no idea.
You know,
I,

40
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:38.820
you know Andrew Jackson and he could have been like,
you know,

41
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:41.320
he looks like one of those broads on fucking,
uh,

42
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.160
the fuck's at of that showed the golden girls.

43
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.490
He looked like one of the golden girls,
sort of their hip or younger one.

44
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.500
You know,
he really had that middle of the ground,
you know,
that.

45
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.640
Is it a chick?
Is it a dude?
Roger Daltrey early eighties haircut,

46
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.810
you know,
except was a public wig over there.
Um,

47
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.110
yeah,
I mean,

48
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.970
I'm just saying just because somebody has the same fucking thing as you does not

49
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:13.330
mean that they're going to do what's good for you or that you're now going to

50
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:18.010
get more stuff like clock cheese in the White House.

51
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.780
Doesn't that mean I get a corner office?
No,
it doesn't fuck the,

52
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:23.860
you have to do with her.

53
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.110
I got to admit.
Yeah.
If I see a redhead achieves something,

54
00:03:30.111 --> 00:03:32.000
I don't feel excited like,
oh,

55
00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:35.780
it's only a matter of time before that comes around my way and I know what

56
00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:40.430
you're taking.
Oh,
what build.
It's not like red heads are a minority.
Yes,
we are.

57
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.140
And unseen minority.
I told you,
walking amongst you,

58
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.250
listening in on your conversation,
reading your emails.
We're here.
Man.

59
00:03:49.251 --> 00:03:52.190
Went from another port from fucking Mars,
the Red Planet.

60
00:03:52.191 --> 00:03:56.630
This is where we came from.
We came here,
right?
We look just like you guys,

61
00:03:56.631 --> 00:03:59.540
but then we fucked up when we ended the atmosphere.
Right?

62
00:03:59.541 --> 00:04:03.680
We got a little fucking singed up there and burned our pubes.

63
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.620
Oh my God.
It's so fucking gloomy.
Day is a good God damn gloomy day.

64
00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:15.950
I hope the fucking,
the goddamn clouds part.
Um,

65
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.470
anyways,
older,
oh,
freckles is looking for a new car.

66
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.640
I'm looking for a new car,
baby,
a new car.

67
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.230
And I got to admit,
I actually feel like I'm,
uh,
you know,

68
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:31.630
like leaving the Prius behind.
You know,
I've had the,

69
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:35.260
I had almost eight years with the thing runs like a fucking top.

70
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.570
I Dunno,
I just want to get something new.
I got a buddy who might buy it.
I Dunno.

71
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.470
I'm a frugal son of a bitch.
I'm probably just going to go look.
But you know,

72
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:49.210
it's a good,
a good time to look for a fucking car was on a rainy day,
you know,

73
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.540
all those fucking tool shed fucking salesman.
They are the worst.
The car seat,

74
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.550
car smell salesmen are the lowest of the low of fucking salespeople.

75
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.460
And you know what's funny?
They know it.
They wouldn't even lie about it.

76
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:05.010
They know what the fuck they do.
I mean,
they,

77
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:07.420
they had like one rung below a drug dealer,

78
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.120
at least with drugs.
You know,
you get some sort of a high,

79
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.930
well I guess when you buy a car you do,
you know,
I don't know.
Fuck they,

80
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.690
they are just like,
I know,
the great thing is is I really don't need a car.

81
00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:28.600
So I'm in a great negotiating a negotiable negotiator to go shore with a hollow

82
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.860
position.
I was going to let go and be like,
yeah,

83
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.140
I liked that and this is what I'm going to pay a.

84
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.160
So go discuss it with your manager and come back and come back with that number

85
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:45.330
or something less or I'm just going to get my car.
You trade that in?
Nope.

86
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.870
I could sell it to my buddy or I could just drive across the street.

87
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.010
Not Take on all this fucking debt.
Just go get myself a ham sandwich.
Huh?

88
00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.100
What do you say this stupid tie.
Go talk to your manager.

89
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.540
Um,

90
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.050
I always talk a good game and then I go in there and I get fucked because at the

91
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.080
end of the day I just,
I don't want to be there and it's just,

92
00:06:08.081 --> 00:06:11.170
I don't give a shit if it costs me a few grand more.
It's like,

93
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.380
how much more do I have to pay to get you to shut the fuck up?
And they know it.

94
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:15.510
You know what I mean?
You have a,

95
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.000
a women talk about how guys just wear them down sometimes and they just see,

96
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.790
just sort of blow him to shut him up and just get them on their way.

97
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.800
That's what car salesmen do to make.
No,
they don't blow me.
They,
uh,

98
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.840
they just fought.
They do wear me down though.

99
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.740
They fucking wear me down and I'm just like,
f you know,
I,
I don't okay.

100
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.720
I at,
when I bought my Prius,
I was just like,
I went in,
I said,
listen,

101
00:06:37.721 --> 00:06:40.540
I'm paying this and that's it.
And I go,
well,
we're not giving you it for that.

102
00:06:40.541 --> 00:06:44.200
It's a hot car.
We sell like three a day.
And I'm like,
well then I'm leaving.

103
00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:47.650
And then they go,
all right.
And then I went,
all right,

104
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.880
I'll pay what you want me to.

105
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.680
I am the fucking worst.

106
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.290
I want all you salesmen to know that a sucker just went through the doe.

107
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.540
Um,
that's going to be Megan about fucking two hours.
Um,
all right,

108
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.970
what the hell am I?
What am I talking?
Oh,
you know,
it's,

109
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:10.330
I'm actually really enjoying.
I actually had a cigar.

110
00:07:10.331 --> 00:07:14.440
I told you for the first time,
and I got to admit,
I kind of didn't.
I liked it.

111
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.970
I liked it,
did it,
but there was way more.
Um,

112
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.090
I don't like this shitty taste in my fucking mouth the next day.

113
00:07:22.091 --> 00:07:22.841
Then there was that.

114
00:07:22.841 --> 00:07:27.790
I enjoyed that and I am on the precipice of a,

115
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.830
just straight up quitting those fucking things,

116
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.400
which should make me feel really good to be honest with you.
Like I said,

117
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:36.250
if I keep smoking these things this summer,
I'm a four year smoker,

118
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.300
something I'd never thought I'd be.
Now I'm not going to start crying right now.

119
00:07:40.301 --> 00:07:43.640
Like some broad that just won an award pretending to be a nurse.
You know,

120
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.790
some fucking show you like me.
He really liked me.

121
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.990
Um,
I,
I don't,
uh,
I don't need that shit in my life,

122
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.440
although I gotta admit I've,
I,
I do enjoy,
do I enjoy them?

123
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.180
I think I remember that I enjoyed the last one I had.
I liked,
I liked it,

124
00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:03.100
but I didn't a afterwards I was like,
well,

125
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.960
Jesus Christ is fucking taste in my mouth.
So,
um,

126
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.970
<v 1>yeah,</v>

127
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:10.181
<v 0>dude,</v>

128
00:08:10.181 --> 00:08:15.100
you guys consider me a smoker if I smoked one new year's Day,

129
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.550
the Superbowl,
my birthday,

130
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:24.100
and then on one of those Jewish holidays in September,
I think I needed,

131
00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:27.550
I needed for sticking like once every three months.
What the fuck?
Hey,

132
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.910
my birthday's June,
so I come out of the gate,
right?
Boom.

133
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.220
January 1st I smoke one,

134
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:37.930
and then February 3rd is the super bowl and then it's nothing in March.

135
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.740
Nothing in April,
nothing in May.
And then in June for my birthday,
Bam,

136
00:08:41.741 --> 00:08:45.850
I smoke one.
And then,
um,
I don't know,

137
00:08:45.851 --> 00:08:47.860
maybe that big college game I go to every year,

138
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:49.823
<v 1>you know,</v>

139
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.470
<v 0>I dunno.
I have no idea.
I figured,
you know,
say,
oh,</v>

140
00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:55.140
I remember what the fuck I was going to tell you guys.

141
00:08:55.141 --> 00:08:58.620
Remember I was telling you last time there was something I wanted to tell you

142
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:01.350
but I,
I couldn't remember what it was.
Um,

143
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.520
I tried to make Gnocchi the other night.
Did I tell you that?

144
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:09.450
And you'll keep however the fuck you say,
what a God damn fucking disaster.

145
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.160
Fucking disaster.
You know what?
This is base.

146
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.740
It just tasted like,
you know,

147
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.370
just imagine what cookie dough would tastes like minus everything that makes it

148
00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:23.940
tastes good.
It was just blobs of Shit,

149
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.520
blobs of flower.
Um,
what happened was wet was,

150
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:30.930
I was a,

151
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.470
I went on the Internet and I was watching these fucking chefs make this shit.

152
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.080
And what they do is when they go to mix it,

153
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:41.400
they fast forward through it or they just jump cut because they feel that it's

154
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:44.640
boring and that no one's going to watch the rest of it.

155
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.860
And that right there,
that's the key right there.

156
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:52.440
It's like they opened the playbook and then they just go,

157
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.480
they fan through every fucking page and then they're like,

158
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.860
and that's the game plan for the,
they were going to run this season.

159
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.660
Any questions on two on two ready break.
Right.
And you're like,
what the,

160
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.170
what the fuck just happened?
So,
um,

161
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.080
I believe they got me so fucking paranoid.

162
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:15.650
I watched this Mario Batali one where,
uh,
he had his friend do it and um,

163
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.920
you know,
he's got,
he's going to show you to make Gnocchi.
You,
you just look up,

164
00:10:19.921 --> 00:10:22.260
just look at Mario Batali fucking blog blog.
You'll see the thing,

165
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:26.010
they fly through him mixing the shit.
And uh,

166
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.430
but the big thing that kept saying was,
is don't over mix it.
Don't over mix it.

167
00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:32.670
You're going to get a tough pasta,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada,

168
00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:37.230
and all that shit.
And these fucking assholes.
They just blew right through it.

169
00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:38.160
And then I under mixed it,

170
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.290
I forgot and I'm starting to feel like I already told you this one.

171
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.960
I told you this,
right?
And he said,
you should make pasta anymore,
you know?

172
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.760
There you go.
There's my supportive wife.
I swear to God.

173
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.480
Do you ever wonder why the woman that loves you is always shitting on everything

174
00:10:54.481 --> 00:10:58.470
that you do?
You know,
not everything you do,
but anything new,
you're trying.

175
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.760
They fucking shit all over you.
You know what I think that is?

176
00:11:02.761 --> 00:11:07.230
I think that there's some sort of fucking paranoia within a relationship.

177
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.490
Maybe guys do it too.
I never dated a guy,
you know?
You know what?

178
00:11:11.491 --> 00:11:14.790
I think I'm going to try this thumb.
Do

179
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.740
you guys still like me?
If I dated a guy for like three fucking months?

180
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.370
You know what?
If I dated like my doppelganger,

181
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.430
I'm trying to get the most fucked up image you could possibly see to me.

182
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.260
I'll update that guy from fucking,
uh,
uh,
we're all wacky in the house over here.

183
00:11:31.261 --> 00:11:34.260
Whatever the fuck the name of that show is,
you know?
Oh,
look at you.
You're,

184
00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:38.910
you're fucking a,
I'm from Malaysia.
Look at me.
I like show tunes.

185
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.890
Hey,
I'm the old school guy from fucking the Korean War,
right?

186
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.150
Am I describing my cartoon?
I can't remember.
Anyways.
Um,

187
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:54.130
the fuck was I just talking about.
Oh God damn it.

188
00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:56.890
My fucking brain just goes in one straight line and you just gotta keep going.

189
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.140
I gotta keep going.
If I come back around again,
it's just like,

190
00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:00.790
I don't even know where the fuck I was at.

191
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.410
Backup backup was before dating a guy for three months,
but it was after gloomy,

192
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.740
gloomy fucking weather.
Say after the car,
crooked car salesman,

193
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.490
Columbia,
he coming around the money.
You come around the mountain,

194
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.810
we going up and down.
Lou,
remember that Mary Tyler Moore won when Lou grant,

195
00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:23.500
he had a great fucking idea and he came and he just forgot about it as,
oh man,

196
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:26.770
it had the best idea and Mary Tyler Moore is trying to get him to remember.

197
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:29.500
She goes,
okay,
okay,
you're in the elevator here in the valley coming up,

198
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.810
coming up here,
and she's going,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I was in the elevator.

199
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.870
She goes,
yeah,
you know,
you,
you press the floor,
you coming up,

200
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.080
you're in the elevator and you would think any,
right as he almost gets it.

201
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.380
Ted Baxter just leans in,
he goes,
well,
you're going up or down low.

202
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.870
Oh,
speaking of that shit,
you know what I watched the other day,

203
00:12:46.871 --> 00:12:48.880
I watched an episode of Gilligan's island,

204
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.530
the ones that were in black and white instead of watching March madness,

205
00:12:53.531 --> 00:12:57.790
because I don't like the first couple of rounds.
I know there's all those upsets,

206
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.260
but I don't like watching fucking bunker hill community college playing Duke.

207
00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.830
I know every once in a while they get beat and I guess there was a bunch of

208
00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:10.240
fucking upsets,
you know?
I know that one fucking that,
that,
uh,

209
00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:14.950
that Austin Austin city limits college with that fucking,

210
00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:17.020
I couldn't tell if he was a lumberjack or a hipster,

211
00:13:17.021 --> 00:13:21.280
that fucking jacked white dude with the psycho beard man and the Hitler youth

212
00:13:21.281 --> 00:13:22.240
haircut.
I was like,

213
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:26.200
that guy needs to one more wind and they have to have the other team fucking

214
00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:29.970
tipped it in and they lost right at the fucking buzzer.
But,
um,

215
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.030
I was thinking that guy,
he needs to get to one more round and he is going to be,

216
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:38.580
he's going to be famous.
You know,
I just seem that cause I was looking like I,
uh,

217
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:43.000
I remember who he is and I assumed if I remember then everybody else is going to

218
00:13:43.001 --> 00:13:45.970
remember because you know,
why wouldn't the whole world think the way I think?

219
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.850
Well Shit,
maybe I should run for president.

220
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.370
I think when you have thoughts like that,
that means that you're,

221
00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:54.040
you're designed to be a world leader.

222
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.760
I have great ideas and I think everybody,

223
00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.630
why wouldn't everybody like my ideas and everybody should think the way I think.

224
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:05.320
And everybody will be good if I am running stuff,
you know,

225
00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:07.330
and everybody will get the same amount of stuff,

226
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.810
except I'll get a little bit more and by a little bit more,

227
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.420
I mean a bunch of hose,
a bunch of doughs.

228
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:19.930
It's something else about my toes.
Um,
well you know what,
I,

229
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.030
I can't remember what the fuck I was talking about.

230
00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.770
I did start talking about basketball,
but you know,
some,

231
00:14:25.771 --> 00:14:27.850
they actually having a little bit of match madness.

232
00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:32.851
The Madness of March is coming down to a Anaheim and I heard the,

233
00:14:34.421 --> 00:14:38.200
uh,
the Duke guys to Dubois to aim to do board.

234
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:42.310
We come right back based on their own and [inaudible],
um,

235
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.850
are coming to Anaheim at the Hondas.

236
00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:51.070
I think I'm going to go to that.
You know,
who's getting,

237
00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.820
I got to two huge fucking shows coming up this weekend.

238
00:14:56.050 --> 00:15:00.610
One in river side and the other one at the terrorists theatre in Long Beach,

239
00:15:00.611 --> 00:15:02.650
California,
which is really no big deal.

240
00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.800
It's just a beautiful theater that Richard Pryor,
uh,

241
00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.580
taped his first big special in.
That's all.

242
00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.380
I'll just be standing on the same stage.

243
00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:16.240
No reason to prepare or be nervous for that one.
I'm freaking out about that one.

244
00:15:16.241 --> 00:15:17.140
I'm not going to lie to you guys.

245
00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.290
I just feel like I'm already putting all this pressure on myself that if I don't

246
00:15:20.291 --> 00:15:22.510
have the fucking,
um,

247
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:27.520
my show of shows data,
I dunno,
the comedy gods going to be like,

248
00:15:27.521 --> 00:15:30.130
yeah,
it is.
These comedians nowadays,
you know,

249
00:15:30.131 --> 00:15:32.980
they're all still in a bunch of fucking tickets,
but then they stink.

250
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:38.050
They're not the real deal.
Um,
but anyways,

251
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:41.380
uh,
I'm thinking if I,
if I go out tonight,

252
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:46.240
tomorrow and Wednesday,
right?
To a couple,
two,
three,

253
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.810
okay.
And then Thursday,
right?

254
00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:55.170
I hit the Duke game then on fucking Friday to get my show and Saturday got my

255
00:15:56.561 --> 00:15:58.960
show and just knock those out.
I feel like I'll be all right.

256
00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.800
I feel like I could take one fucking day off.
You know,
am I nuts?

257
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:08.140
My notes,
because I didn't last night.
This is the thing,
I stopped smoking cigars.

258
00:16:08.141 --> 00:16:10.960
So you know what happens when you quit a bad habit?

259
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.710
Something else fucking goes through the God damn roof.
You know what I mean?

260
00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.310
It's like if he quit smoking,
you start eating right?

261
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.270
You start boozing,
you start shooting smack,
right?

262
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.250
You say,
I'm going to start cleaning up around the house.
Next thing you know,

263
00:16:27.251 --> 00:16:31.990
you're beating your wife and you know why?
It's because nobody is perfect.

264
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.050
You ever go to a fucking AA meeting?

265
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.120
They're all in their fucking chain smoking and fucking shove.

266
00:16:38.121 --> 00:16:41.230
And donuts down their throat.
This still killing themselves.

267
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:46.270
They just slid it over to something else.
That's basically,
um,

268
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:47.890
<v 1>okay.</v>

269
00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:49.950
<v 0>The most fascinating people I find is,</v>

270
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.960
is the people that are just 100% straight edge and they eat like a micro macro

271
00:16:55.841 --> 00:16:59.290
biotic microbio whatever the fuck it is.
Macrobiotic diet.
I'm gonna say macro.

272
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:04.680
You say macro.
I say micro beep,
a Dapa doable.
Um,

273
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.650
those fucking people,
but you know what it is and they don't do anything.

274
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:10.603
<v 1>Okay.</v>

275
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.000
<v 0>They fucking,
you know,</v>

276
00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:15.280
<v 1>okay.</v>

277
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.930
<v 0>They drink fucking,
you know,</v>

278
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:21.640
pure of the most purified fucking water out of a Unicorn Horn or some shit.

279
00:17:21.641 --> 00:17:26.440
Right.
Just the most,
the most fucking clean living ever.
But you know what?

280
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.490
They probably killed themselves with the stress of knowing there's still going

281
00:17:30.491 --> 00:17:31.324
to die.

282
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:32.503
<v 1>You know</v>

283
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.250
<v 0>how,
how,
how do you think you treat yourself when you really think about it?</v>

284
00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.360
I think I treat myself like a,

285
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.560
I wouldn't say the way I treat a rental car.
I treat around car pretty good.

286
00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:48.840
I don't beat the shit out of it.
When I was younger,
I used to,

287
00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.830
and it's just funny.
They give you a car and you just,
you know,

288
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.660
maybe neutral drops for some reason were considered fucking amazing.
You know,

289
00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.500
you just have it in park.
You would,
oh no,
you put a neutral,

290
00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.840
they go bill noodle drop and you would just floor it,

291
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.100
get the rpms up to a bought,
oh,
I don't know,
seven,
8,000.

292
00:18:07.101 --> 00:18:10.190
And then you would just slam it into fucking drive.

293
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.370
And you just heard that horrific sound
of,

294
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.570
I don't know what the fuck it is on an automatic Tricia transmission,
you know,

295
00:18:18.571 --> 00:18:23.571
with the standard would be the coolest shit in the fucking engaging in whatever

296
00:18:23.701 --> 00:18:25.440
the fuck and engages in.
I don't fucking know.

297
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.820
Basically gears and slamming into other gears.

298
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

299
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:35.180
<v 0>I can't believe the teeth just don't fly off on both sides.</v>

300
00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.470
I imagined the eventually they do,
but uh,
we used to do shit like that.
Uh,

301
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.650
you know,
you take the car off road,

302
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.030
you could do a lot of shit back in the day before everybody had a fucking
camera,

303
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:52.460
you know?
Oh.
Speaking of which,
I got to tell you what I fucking saw.
Oh my God.

304
00:18:52.461 --> 00:18:53.810
I almost forgot to tell you this fucking story.

305
00:18:53.811 --> 00:18:57.710
Let me do a little advertising here first.
Oh,
look at that little teaser.
Um,

306
00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:00.830
remind me to talk about the,
uh,

307
00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:05.160
the fucking local fucking wine thing.

308
00:19:05.161 --> 00:19:09.420
I went on with my wife,
mother in law.
My brother in law.

309
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.830
Um,
all right.
Where the fuck is he advertising here for this week?

310
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

311
00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:19.870
<v 0>If you knew Susie,
like I knew Susie.
Oh.
Oh,
what a Gal.</v>

312
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.870
She love her.
They're just kind of calling her a whore.
Oh,

313
00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:27.780
if you knew where the way I knew her,
you mean you're fucked her.
Um,
all right.

314
00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:31.390
Me undies me on d,
he's dry and out.

315
00:19:31.391 --> 00:19:35.050
Yo fucking clams me.
Andy's me undies.

316
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.900
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

317
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.240
<v 0>the butcher,
his name was fucking Sam.</v>

318
00:19:39.241 --> 00:19:43.380
He was banging Alison a clam was dry.
He thought he was doing his job.

319
00:19:43.381 --> 00:19:46.810
He didn't know why she had the first pair of fucking me undies.

320
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:50.970
That was 1968.
So they broke up.
If you asked me,

321
00:19:50.971 --> 00:19:55.770
I thought she went down a different road I made,

322
00:19:55.771 --> 00:19:57.870
she was a lesbian.
All right.
Me Undies,

323
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.710
whether you're wearing a suit or sweats,

324
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:07.070
you spend almost 24 hours a day in your underwear unless you're an animal or a

325
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.580
Matthew mcconaughey.
Right?

326
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.530
But instead of making a statement like Superman's tights under his clothes every

327
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:17.340
day,
um,
your underwear is probably boring me.

328
00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:21.990
UNDIES is here to change that.
Um,
please include the following.
I'm going to,

329
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.850
it's pronounced modal.

330
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.100
Every pair of me undies is made from society,

331
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.720
from sustainably sourced modal of fabric that's twice as soft as cotton.

332
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.720
Now,
can somebody tell me where the fuck this shit came from?

333
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:42.020
This is,
this is from a lab.
You know what I mean?
Please tell me.

334
00:20:42.021 --> 00:20:45.260
There's not a group of people that are forced to go out into the fields and pick

335
00:20:45.261 --> 00:20:46.940
model.
You know,

336
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.280
God knows it's going to be some great music that comes out of that one.
Ah,

337
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.450
nothing can describe the fit and feel of me undies me undies dry and out your

338
00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.730
ball bag.
Um,
but once you try them on,

339
00:21:00.731 --> 00:21:05.500
you'll understand why they're called the world's most comfortable underwear.

340
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:08.830
Underwear.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

341
00:21:08.831 --> 00:21:11.350
and if you don't love your first pair of me undies,
they're free.

342
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.500
No questions asked.
I don't understand that.
Why would you keep a pair?

343
00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.440
Because you can't give them back.
You know,

344
00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.760
you can't have your dried up fucking genital sweat in those,
in the,

345
00:21:21.761 --> 00:21:25.390
in the under carriage of those things.
You can't resell those.
Share your kid.

346
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.050
You put them on the Internet for those fucking people that like to sniff other

347
00:21:29.051 --> 00:21:29.884
people's underwear.

348
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.930
What is with those people where they had dog in their past life?

349
00:21:34.931 --> 00:21:37.810
What the fuck is wrong with them?
I bet they're noses are colt.

350
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:42.010
The perverts have cold noses.
Um,
anyways,

351
00:21:42.011 --> 00:21:46.630
me has dozens of styles and limited edition prints to help you make a statement

352

Uh,
whether anyone can see them or not.

353
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.290

359

360

366
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.770
smack Kaz smart phones,
smart homes.

367
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.750
Technology has made everything.
Matta,
WIC.
Oh my God,
he's wicked.

368
00:22:49.751 --> 00:22:50.710
Fucking smart.

369
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:55.000
But losing your stuff's still makes smart people feel really stupid.

370
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.400
I don't think it does.
I think it just makes him frustrated.

371
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:01.420
I think he just wrote that because it sounded good,
but the copy it built.

372
00:23:01.421 --> 00:23:02.620
Why don't you just read the rest of it?
All right.

373
00:23:02.621 --> 00:23:04.630
Track early makes losing things.

374
00:23:04.631 --> 00:23:08.470
A thing of the past tracker is a coin size device that locates,

375
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:12.130
misplace keys while it's bags,
computers,

376
00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.010
drug paraphernalia,

377
00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:18.130
whenever you're always leaving around the house but can't seem to find anything

378
00:23:18.131 --> 00:23:21.430
in seconds.
Do you beat your children with the wooden spoon?

379
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.060
Did they try and hide it?
You won't lose it anymore.

380
00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:29.470
You'll be able to beat their ass in a second because tracker will help you find

381
00:23:29.471 --> 00:23:33.760
that blunt object,
just pair of tracker to your smartphone,

382
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:37.630
attach it to anything,
fight as precise location with the tap of a button.

383
00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.820
It's that easy.
Lose your phone,

384
00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:44.800
press the button or tracker and your smart phone rings even when it's on silent.

385
00:23:44.801 --> 00:23:46.000
You know what I just realized?
Somebody

386
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.710
<v 2>is going to kill their spouse with a blunt object in the house and then they're</v>

387
00:23:49.711 --> 00:23:52.110
going to take it and they're gonna throw it in the river,

388
00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:56.160
but they're going to forget that devices on it and the cops are going to use it

389
00:23:56.161 --> 00:24:00.570
and then they're instantly going to be in the hall of fame of world's dumbest

390
00:24:00.571 --> 00:24:04.890
criminals
with over 1.5 million devices.

391
00:24:04.891 --> 00:24:08.340

What?

407
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:09.130
Mailing and shipping are a routine part of your business.

408
00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:14.260
Important Comma keeps your operation going.
Dot Dot,

409

410
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:21.070
the way the writing is important keeps your business going,

411

your business operations going.

412
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.500
But if you're making constant trips to the post office,

413
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:31.510
that's a routine you need to change.
There's a much more convenient way to do it.

414
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:36.900
You tell your wife to get off her fat fucking ass and getting up stamps.com

427
00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:21.510
Okay,
so you guys ready for this?
A little fucking safari thing.
You know,

428
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:23.140
I was doing real good with my fucking posture.

429
00:26:23.141 --> 00:26:26.590
Now I'm sitting on my lower back again.
I need to sit up,
sit up straight,
take,

430
00:26:26.591 --> 00:26:30.520
take God damn charger the fucking Goddamn game here.
Um,

431
00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.970
so anyways,
uh,
it was my mother in law's birthday and,
uh,

432
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.250
it got rained out like a month or two ago.
So we finally rescheduled this thing.

433
00:26:40.251 --> 00:26:45.000
We went on the one of these wine trips out here to Malibu.
Um,

434
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.350
and they had these giant fucking,
like 600 acre ranches out there because I will,

435
00:26:49.351 --> 00:26:50.041
I used to always,
you know,

436
00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:53.940
whenever I'm flying by and I always look over and see all that fucking,

437
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:59.040
that this basically no place to land.
You know,
I was kinda thinking like,
wow,

438
00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:01.560
that's amazing that it hasn't been developed.

439
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.990
I guess because they're all fucking ranches.
Eventually,

440
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.500
eventually they'll get rid of all the fucking grapes and we'll turn it into a

441
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.360
giant fucking,
I dunno,
I dunno what the fuck you call it,

442
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:16.500
apartment complexes or whatever.
So anyways,
so we go up there and first of all,

443
00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:17.790
it's so up in the fucking hills,

444
00:27:17.791 --> 00:27:22.530
like the gps isn't working and it actually ends up taking us to this,

445
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.640
this fucking,
um,
parole board thing.
That's in the middle there.

446
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:28.200
They got the Barb wire fence.

447
00:27:28.201 --> 00:27:30.990
It looks like minimum security thing that we went into it like,
all right,

448
00:27:30.991 --> 00:27:33.480
I don't think this is the fucking a wine place.

449
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.850
So we ended up going back and they have on the farm,
you know,

450
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.180
they have a place where you can just go get boozed,
you know,
boost up,

451
00:27:42.181 --> 00:27:45.750
listen to some bands and that type of shit.
And uh,
you know,

452
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.260
there's something about wine drinkers.
You just don't want to be around them.

453
00:27:49.261 --> 00:27:53.190
I don't know that it gives you a brutal fucking hangover.
I like a nice glass,

454
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.770
you know,
sound like fucking,

455
00:27:55.771 --> 00:27:59.300
what's his face start talking about fava beans is somebody's liver.
Um,

456
00:27:59.301 --> 00:28:03.580
I look at Nice glass with a meal,
but that's about it.
But um,
anyways,

457
00:28:03.581 --> 00:28:05.670
so they also have like a safari up there.

458
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.540
The APP like Jakks they have this fucking Giraffe,
they have camels,

459
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.390
they had these,
he moves,
they had all this crazy shit.

460
00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.370
You could go up and feed them and all that type of stuff.

461
00:28:14.371 --> 00:28:18.930
So we're up there having a great time meeting these fucking yaks and zebras and

462
00:28:18.931 --> 00:28:22.950
stuff.
And,
um,
and of course,
you know,

463
00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:27.330
they got these giant bull light things and this is fucking jerk off

464
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.750
with these one of these guys,
you know,

465
00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:35.010
that bought like the top of the line loafers,
you know,

466
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.800
but they're loafers.
They're these really,
this fucking,
you know,

467
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.280
it's the kind of Shit ric flair would buy as a joke,
right?

468
00:28:41.281 --> 00:28:44.100
Just so we could hold them in some broke guy's face and say that his shoes cost

469
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:46.580
more than a house.
But this guy was like serious and he's wearing them.

470
00:28:46.581 --> 00:28:49.770
There's like dirt on the ground.
Obviously he's walking around in them.

471
00:28:49.771 --> 00:28:50.581
So all of you know,

472
00:28:50.581 --> 00:28:53.880
I'm over feeding a fucking Yak and all of a sudden I heard the unmistakable

473
00:28:53.881 --> 00:28:58.530
sound of a bull hitting the fucking metal rail of offense.

474
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.450
I don't know why.
I know that sound.

475
00:29:00.451 --> 00:29:05.451
I think it's part of the fucking a caveman DNA that's still left in everybody

476
00:29:06.181 --> 00:29:08.760
that you,
you know,
well you just NC ever have,

477
00:29:08.761 --> 00:29:11.160
I like walk down the street and all of a sudden dogs behind a fence and it

478
00:29:11.161 --> 00:29:15.680
growls and your whole body just fucking gets that tingle.
And you come at,

479
00:29:15.681 --> 00:29:18.090
like I'm telling you,
if you don't,

480
00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:21.630
if you started running right then you probably could run as fast as Bo Jackson.

481
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.730
You know,
that's how fast boat Jackson could run just to gain four yards.

482
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.320
He ran as fast as some of would run if a saber tooth tiger was fucking about

483
00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:34.860
ready to eat them,
you know,
that first fucking step.
Um,

484
00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:40.110
anyways,
I heard that sound and immediately I just,
I was just,

485
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.130
I was already being like,
all right,
I'm going to get fucking

486
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.170
<v 0>trampled.
Or worst case scenario,</v>

487
00:29:44.171 --> 00:29:46.840
this thing's gonna Hook under my belt and my fucking pants.

488
00:29:46.841 --> 00:29:50.890
You're going to do go down to my ankles as my junk is flapping around like that

489
00:29:50.891 --> 00:29:55.030
poor bastard.
Everybody sees,
oh,
that guy's life is over.
He's fuck.

490
00:29:55.031 --> 00:29:57.040
There's no way to laugh that off.
You ever seen that one?

491
00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.840
The bull fucking gets into the guy's belt loop tips some upside down and just

492
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:06.160
thrash in them around the guy's pants.
Go all the way down to his ankles.

493
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.520
And people went from being like,
oh my God,
that's going to die to everybody.

494
00:30:09.521 --> 00:30:13.630
Just sitting there laughing.
At this guy and uh,
you know,
he's sticking like,

495
00:30:13.631 --> 00:30:18.010
oh my God,
this thing's going to Gore my fucking Dick.
Right?
And,
and you know,

496
00:30:18.011 --> 00:30:22.480
the chick that he finally got the fucking courage to trying to get the courage

497
00:30:22.481 --> 00:30:26.260
to ask up,
ask up,
ask out,
up,
out,

498
00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:29.170
over in whatever you wanted to take this bitch out,
right?

499
00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.190
So he probably was awkward.
So he's going like,
you know what,

500
00:30:33.191 --> 00:30:35.850
I'll do something amazing and then that'll give her my tea.

501
00:30:35.851 --> 00:30:38.860
I'll show you how courageous I am.
Right?

502
00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:42.430
So he runs with the fucking bulls and right as she was being like,
you know,

503
00:30:42.431 --> 00:30:44.410
you kind of navy themes,
like he's fun.

504
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.310
All of a sudden he's upside down and then there's his fucking little fucking

505
00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:53.320
little a Schmuck,
right?
It's Jewish people say fucking flopping around.

506
00:30:53.321 --> 00:30:57.970
And it was just over that guy not only had to leave his hometown,

507
00:30:58.150 --> 00:30:59.860
his providence,
he had to leave the country.

508
00:30:59.861 --> 00:31:02.680
He might've had to leave the continent.
But now with fucking youtube,
it's just,

509
00:31:02.681 --> 00:31:05.320
you know,
and here I am talking about it,
right?

510
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.950
Sex offenders have an easier time relocating.

511
00:31:08.951 --> 00:31:12.700
Then that fucking guy after that one.
So anyways,
um,

512
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.670
so I hear that sound and right as I turn around,

513
00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.720
I see the bull coming off the fence and I see this guy in loafers,

514
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:24.970
you know,
had run back away from the fence.
Right.

515
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:29.530
And well it was funny was I went over there and I fed the fucking both and

516
00:31:29.531 --> 00:31:34.450
nothing happened.
Came over there.
I had a relaxed energy.
I fucking,
you know,

517
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.750
I had my fucking weight on my back foot,
you know,

518
00:31:37.751 --> 00:31:39.670
I was standing like a fucking box or you know,

519
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.910
I wasn't standing there flat footed like loop through him and that fucking thing

520
00:31:42.911 --> 00:31:45.790
comes,
I'm going to fall on my ass.
I was already anticipate.

521
00:31:45.791 --> 00:31:48.940
It's like I am not ending up in a fucking youtube video.

522
00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.700
I'm already a white guy and we,
I already,

523
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:56.260
I am prone to walking up to animals like their dogs.

524
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:59.260
I don't know why,
why people do that,
but I do that.

525
00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:03.800
I see a line at the zoo and I want to go up and give it a belly rub.
Oh,
Julian,

526
00:32:03.801 --> 00:32:07.660
oh fuck.
A keto based.
Right.
Where other groups of people,

527
00:32:07.661 --> 00:32:09.240
for some reason they,

528
00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.160
they understand not even for some reason what they're doing is common sense.

529
00:32:12.161 --> 00:32:16.690
Whatever fucking reason.
White people,
we just want to go up,
you know,
I dunno,

530
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:20.110
it's fucking stupid.
Generally speaking,
right?
So,

531
00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.090
um,
I'm like,
what a fucking idiot.
And you see the guy,

532
00:32:25.091 --> 00:32:25.901
he's got that look on his face.

533
00:32:25.901 --> 00:32:28.570
Like I know it's got hit in the face by fucking Bull Horn,
right?

534
00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:32.200
And a surprisingly the guides didn't say Shit,
right?

535
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.790
And then we're all going to get back on the little soft open thing,

536
00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:40.010
a safari truck.
And I had boom,
I hear it again in

537
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.510
<v 2>the same fight.
Look around again,</v>

538
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.320
same fucking guy back peddle and an the stupid loafers and they don't say a

539
00:32:45.321 --> 00:32:49.490
fucking word to this guy.
So I'm just like,
this guy is a fucking moron,
right?

540
00:32:49.491 --> 00:32:53.750
So we'd get on the thing and I were driving over and now we're going to go see

541
00:32:53.751 --> 00:32:58.751
this giraffe is teenage giraffe named Stanley the coolest fucking giraffe you're

542
00:33:00.231 --> 00:33:03.740
ever gonna meet.
It just was not afraid of people whatsoever,

543
00:33:03.741 --> 00:33:05.180
which of course is dangerous.

544
00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:09.320
First thing I thought of when I fucking saw the giraffe was like,

545
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:12.530
I remember seeing a giraffe on youtube kick.

546
00:33:12.531 --> 00:33:17.531
A fucking lioness is Linus went to jump on the things back and it timed it

547
00:33:18.141 --> 00:33:20.270
perfectly.
Okay.

548
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:24.500
Like Andre Agassi's fucking dead dead fucking shot.

549
00:33:24.501 --> 00:33:25.340
He used to do right up.

550
00:33:25.341 --> 00:33:27.970
The fuck is not the baseline right up the fucking whatever.

551
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.140
He used to rip that back.
Hey,

552
00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:32.930
now push right up and you know he always talked shit about it.

553
00:33:32.931 --> 00:33:37.130
Made a lot of money with that shot,
right?
That's what the fucking giraffe did.

554
00:33:37.131 --> 00:33:39.380
But what?
That's leg kick the Linus and what are they?

555
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:43.820
How much does the line wait?
Like 600 pounds,
dude.
He sent this fucking thing.

556
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.190
It looked like it was doing,

557
00:33:46.191 --> 00:33:49.640
like it was in the middle of doing a jumping jack and it was just,

558
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:53.780
but it was just like doing this airborne cartwheel and it never came down in

559
00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:54.111
this thing.

560
00:33:54.111 --> 00:33:58.880
Fucking flipped around like three times and it hit the ground and it did not get

561
00:33:58.881 --> 00:34:01.640
up.
All right.
I know I use this reference a lot,

562
00:34:01.641 --> 00:34:03.830
but you remember the last hit Brett Farve took?

563
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.040
That's what this lioness looked like from a giraffe.

564
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:12.020
I couldn't believe it.
Like I jumped up when I saw it,
you know,

565
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.180
it was like watching the nerd beat up the bully.

566
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:18.140
All these guys were piling on and what was funny when the other lions saw that

567
00:34:18.141 --> 00:34:21.250
they were all like,
oh shit,
I didn't know.

568
00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:24.470
I didn't know the giraffe could do that.
Yeah.

569
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:28.110
Who was like the Bruce Lee fucking was at the one inch punch when he'd send

570
00:34:28.111 --> 00:34:31.070
somebody flying across the room,
we get it bill.
So that's,

571
00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:34.460
that's all I'm thinking is I am not getting anywhere near that thing's fucking

572
00:34:34.461 --> 00:34:37.820
likes of,
of course they got like a 10 foot fence and then you walk up.

573
00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:41.240
The thing was 16 feet high as a teenager.
Right.

574
00:34:41.241 --> 00:34:45.260
And you go all the way up and all right.
At that level it's just,

575
00:34:45.261 --> 00:34:47.570
it's head and you have feeding it,

576
00:34:47.571 --> 00:34:51.020
little pieces of banana and all that shit with the skin.

577
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.380
They just cut it up in sections and the way it would eat.

578
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:58.520
It looked like an old man that took its dentures out and it was adorable.

579
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.860
And you know,
deep fucking pet that thing on its head,
it was perfect.
Right?

580
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:09.020
But anyways,
as what palling up to go see this shit,
the guide goes,

581
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.270
all right,
he goes,
now look those camels over their egos.

582
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:17.300
You gotta be careful with those things.
He goes,
they're very aggressive.

583
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:23.060
Um,
you know,
all they want is food,
but if you don't have food,

584
00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:23.963
they're going to,

585
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:27.320
you got a great chance that they're going to bite you because they're going to

586
00:35:27.321 --> 00:35:28.520
get it one way or another.

587
00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:33.050
It's just how they're wired and their necks are longer than you think.

588
00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:37.950
So don't be,
you know,
turning your back on him,
trying to get a Selfie,

589
00:35:37.951 --> 00:35:41.430
cause you're gonna get bit,
and he goes in as much as I say this,

590
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:46.530
you know,
a couple,
two or three people a month get bit,
right.

591
00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:51.000
So he says this all right.
Right.

592
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:55.980
And all I was thinking was good fellas.
Right?
And after all our,
yeah,
yeah.

593
00:35:55.981 --> 00:36:00.930
Bullshit.
What does she do?
She makes a fucking phone call from the home phone,

594
00:36:00.931 --> 00:36:02.940
right?
Exact same fucking thing.

595
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.920
There was these three women in front of us and for whatever fucking reason,

596
00:36:07.921 --> 00:36:12.210
like the second he gave that speech,
I was like,
you know what?
Fuck those camels.

597
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.450
I'm not going anywhere near him.
I didn't try to feed him.
I didn't do it.

598
00:36:14.451 --> 00:36:17.280
I'm not fucking gonna feed stuff.
When the tour guy goes,

599
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.540
we're fucking three people get bit a month.
I'm just like,
you know what?

600
00:36:21.541 --> 00:36:23.040
Guess who's not going to be one of those three.

601
00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:28.120
<v 0>Oh freckles over here.
Alright,
so we go,
everybody,
pets,
the giraffes.</v>

602
00:36:28.121 --> 00:36:31.900
We look at these fucking emails,
which are the creepiest goddamn animal ever.

603
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:36.670
I Dunno,
they do.
They have a look on their fucking face.
I can't even,
I can't,

604
00:36:36.671 --> 00:36:38.500
I'm trying to describe.

605
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.210
<v 1>Okay,</v>

606
00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:41.260
<v 0>the look.
It's like,</v>

607
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:44.583
<v 1>okay,</v>

608
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.400
<v 0>just imagine if like</v>

609
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.350
you were in your backyard and you were just drinking a glass of lemonade and all

610
00:36:51.351 --> 00:36:54.890
of a sudden you saw the ground moving
in.

611
00:36:54.891 --> 00:36:57.200
A person just came up from under the ground.

612
00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:00.380
Just imagine how dirty their face would be.

613
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:04.910
And as they walked towards you to take a sip,
eliminate,
just imagine that,

614
00:37:04.911 --> 00:37:07.700
look on their face.
That's what it looked like.

615
00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:11.510
I went to feed one of those things and it fucking came walking over like a

616
00:37:11.511 --> 00:37:15.860
Zombie.
Like I don't know what it was.
And they got this thing where they don't,

617
00:37:15.861 --> 00:37:18.020
they can't like,
just gently take shit.
They go,

618
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:21.540
they do like fucking pit viper life.
Like their fucking head comes right out.
You,

619
00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:26.030
I held this shit out and I,
the second that thing locked eyes on me,

620
00:37:26.031 --> 00:37:29.540
I fucking just drop the carrot and left.
It's like dare,
it's over.

621
00:37:29.541 --> 00:37:34.310
They're still put.
And the thing was too dumb to fucking look down crazy.

622
00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.970
<v 2>It was like,
it had like,
I swear to God like that,</v>

623
00:37:38.971 --> 00:37:42.000
that description they have when people are on the front lines in a fucking war,

624
00:37:42.001 --> 00:37:45.510
like world war one,
this thing looked like he'd seen horror.

625
00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.850
It's entire fucking life.
And it's just like,
dude,
you know,

626
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.060
how about I just leave it here on the top of the fence and you figure it out.

627
00:37:51.061 --> 00:37:52.950
So anyways,
so we'll walk them back to the,
um,

628
00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.720
to the little safari truck and those three fucking lay.

629
00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:02.670
Where are they at?
Everybody.
Where do you,
where do you think that they're at?

630
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.750
You'd think that getting on the truck,
you know,

631
00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:11.370
you'd think they're getting ready to go enjoy a glass of fucking wine at the

632
00:38:11.371 --> 00:38:12.330
winery.
No,

633
00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:18.740
they're over by the fucking camels and their fucking getting really close,

634
00:38:18.811 --> 00:38:20.520
but they got carrots to,
they're okay,

635
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:25.290
but they're way in this thing's fucking wheel house.
Okay.

636
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:30.100
And I'm just sitting there going like,
and I literally moderate Tinea.

637
00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.690
I go near filmless cause one of them is going to get bit,

638
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.530
one of them is going to get bit so

639
00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.470
<v 0>the cutest one of 'em.
All right.</v>

640
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:44.120
Fucking what does she do after this guy says,

641
00:38:44.121 --> 00:38:48.170
don't turn your back and try to take a selfie.
What does this fucking woman,

642
00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.850
she turns her fucking back.
She's in this thing's fucking wheelhouse.

643
00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.080
She was so close to the thing,

644
00:38:54.081 --> 00:38:58.220
it almost had to double back with it's fucking neck,
which is what it did.

645
00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:03.440
If fucking wants it realized it didn't have any more carrots.
It.

646
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:04.303
She didn't,

647
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:09.080
it fucking doubled back and fucking basically bit this woman right on our boob,

648
00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:10.191
her left Boob,

649
00:39:10.191 --> 00:39:14.000
she had a jacket on and she doesn't want like and fucking stepped away.

650
00:39:14.001 --> 00:39:15.770
Fortunately it didn't clamp down

651
00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:20.630
and it fucking,
it had,

652
00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:23.760
she had these disgusting like just green soul,

653
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:28.830
like grass stains and saliva because the thing's fucking eat grass all day and

654
00:39:29.331 --> 00:39:34.140
she gets back to the the thing and she's doing that whole,
Oh God,

655
00:39:34.141 --> 00:39:38.000
the thing just like bit me in the boob.
Right.
And the tour guide,

656
00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:42.800
funniest thing ever.
He just looks at it.
He goes,
ah,
I fucking told you

657
00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.600
eight drop the F bomb.

658
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.840
<v 2>Yeah,
I fucking told you it was my favorite thing that I think I've seen.</v>

659
00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:55.860
I can't remember.
That reminds me of when I was a kid,

660
00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:00.360
if I was part of the last generation,
the last tail part of,

661
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:04.650
if you slipped on the ice,
it was your fucking fault.
It wasn't the guy's fault.

662
00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:06.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

663
00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:10.350
<v 2>Who had the storefront?
It's like,
yeah,
I used to slippery.
Stupid.</v>

664
00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:14.160
Yeah.
May,
maybe next time you'll fucking be a little more careful.

665
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.990
And then somehow it became,

666
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:21.350
it became the shop owner's fault that you fucking were walking to recklessly on

667
00:40:21.661 --> 00:40:25.350
ice.
Like it's his ice,
not his ice.

668
00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:30.570
It's made by the Lord.
Right.
That's like Mcdonald's having to make salads.

669
00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.860
They took fucking responsibility rather than,
it's like,
no,

670
00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:38.610
it's your fault.
You're fat.
You ordered 50 fucking big Mac.
She can't,

671
00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:43.750
you know,
we're a business.
If you order it,
we're going to give it to you.
You,

672
00:40:43.751 --> 00:40:48.070
you're fucking dope.
You know what?
What do you want to do?

673
00:40:48.071 --> 00:40:50.920
I have to go eat a whole fucking gallon ice cream to fuck is wrong with you.

674
00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:54.970
And they somehow took the responsibility and they started making fucking salads.

675
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:58.950
It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life.
So anyways,
yeah.
And that,

676
00:40:58.951 --> 00:41:01.090
that guy,
he just,
well,
you know,
I fucking told

677
00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:10.120
<v 0>Dude,
it was like needle off the record.
I couldn't fucking believe it.</v>

678
00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:14.850
And they didn't say anything.
It was like,

679
00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:18.180
it was like watching Donald Trump and that first debate when he was still funny

680
00:41:18.181 --> 00:41:20.070
before it was just like,
holy fuck this guy's,

681
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.380
this guy might run the country now who's getting no,

682
00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:26.100
he might speak for the company,
he might pretend to be running the country.

683
00:41:26.101 --> 00:41:26.940
That's the real deal.

684
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:30.000
That's why you can't be too afraid of Donald Trump because at the end of the

685
00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:33.030
dates,
you know,
come on,
come on people.
We all know.

686
00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:34.913
<v 2>You know,</v>

687
00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.490
<v 0>I'll tell you right now,
if I was fucking Isis,</v>

688
00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:42.500
those fucking dopes trying to sneak into this country and blow people up and

689
00:41:42.501 --> 00:41:43.110
shit.

690
00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:48.110
All those fucking idiots got to do is just get together their money and you just

691
00:41:48.841 --> 00:41:53.220
fucking put some money on Halo Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,
right?

692
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:54.900
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

693
00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:58.310
<v 0>That's all you gotta do.
And then you buy a little bit of advertising type</v>

694
00:41:59.290 --> 00:41:59.550
<v 1>okay</v>

695
00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:02.730
<v 0>on all the major networks and you'll never hear about them again.</v>

696
00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:07.290
That's how people,
that's how those fuckers,
you know,
genetically alter food.

697
00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:09.840
You never fucking hear about it cause they got their fucking money in

698
00:42:09.841 --> 00:42:12.180
everybody's pockets and everybody shuts the fuck up.

699
00:42:12.181 --> 00:42:13.320
So that's what Isis should do.

700
00:42:13.321 --> 00:42:17.070
They should just do that and then they could just walk into this country with

701
00:42:17.071 --> 00:42:19.580
the goddamn bazooka on their back and no one would say shit.

702
00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:22.740
<v 2>Um,
anyways.</v>

703
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.541
<v 0>So yeah,</v>

704
00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:27.000
that's what it was like the first debate with Donald Trump where he was just,

705
00:42:27.001 --> 00:42:29.610
they will decide.
He said this about women,
you said that about women.

706
00:42:29.611 --> 00:42:32.550
He said not on,
I said about,
I said that about Rosie O'donnell and they're like,

707
00:42:32.551 --> 00:42:34.740
no,
no.
You said it about other women too and he just got right day.

708
00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:38.800
<v 2>No,
you're probably right.
It probably right.
That was,
it was over.</v>

709
00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:43.530
<v 4>He's like,
oh my God.
I think that'd be pretty good.
Ah Yeah,
I fucking told you</v>

710
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:50.090
<v 2>no sympathy.
No fucking sympathy.
It was perfect.</v>

711
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:54.710
It's exactly,
it's exactly what I think most people need.

712
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:59.030
You know?
Look,
I'm not saying that you shouldn't have empathy.

713
00:42:59.031 --> 00:43:01.640
I'm not saying that you shouldn't have sympathy in that type of shit.

714
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:03.350
All I'm saying is there,

715
00:43:03.351 --> 00:43:08.000
there is a time and a place for no sympathy and that,

716
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:13.190
that was it.
That was,
it was,
it was done perfectly,
you know,

717
00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.620
and I think she's going to be a better person because of it.

718
00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.710
She couldn't even argue.
It's like,
oh,
I fucking told you.

719
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:22.610
And when you really think about it,
it's like once she cuts,

720
00:43:22.611 --> 00:43:24.560
but I think pippy in the Boob,
it's like,

721
00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:28.040
it's like I just fucking told you it was going to do that.

722
00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:33.840
<v 0>Like a what?
What do you think he's going to say?
Oh,
we did it.
Oh,
I'm sorry.</v>

723
00:43:33.841 --> 00:43:35.600
Did it do exactly what the fuck I said

724
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:37.950
<v 2>going to do.
Um,</v>

725
00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.770
<v 0>and then that was it.
And then the next thing we did was we fucking went over,</v>

726
00:43:41.771 --> 00:43:44.770
we checked over all these original like fucking airstreams and then we were

727
00:43:44.771 --> 00:43:46.960
drinking wine and like it,
that all happened,

728
00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:50.230
like we got on the train like bitter and the boob.
He said,
well,

729
00:43:50.231 --> 00:43:53.560
I fucking told you.
And then we were drinking wine outside and I was just like,

730
00:43:53.561 --> 00:43:54.910
this might,
this is fucking awesome.

731
00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.570
<v 2>That should be part of the tour.
That was,
I don't know.
Is it weird?</v>

732
00:43:59.571 --> 00:44:04.010
Am I making a bigger deal about it?
That it was so fucking refreshing.
Yeah.

733
00:44:04.011 --> 00:44:06.500
Fuck head.
You know,
that's on you.

734
00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:13.970
All right.
There we go.
Hey,
Billy Belgium at bill.
Big Fan.

735
00:44:13.971 --> 00:44:17.390
Are you planning a trip to Belgium in the fucking future?

736
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:23.360
<v 0>Um,
can't wait to see you.
Uh,
life on stage.
Ah,
you came close live.</v>

737
00:44:23.361 --> 00:44:25.630
L I.
V.
E and right now I'm still,
I'm sticking with

738
00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:29.650
<v 2>that French by the way.
I am,
uh,
on lingo.</v>

739
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:34.110
I got 23 days in a row,
Michael Jordan,

740
00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:38.130
23 fucking days in a row and uh,

741
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:42.870
I'm just gonna keep fucking doing this shit.
I tried to get a 200 points a day.

742
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.990
Um,
sometimes I don't buy it.
I get at least a hundred,

743
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:49.850
although Tuesday it looks like I want to get 10.
I did one lesson.
Oh yeah,

744
00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:52.530
here I am for the week.
I got like one 60,

745
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:57.030
then I got ten one 82,
10,

746
00:44:57.031 --> 00:45:01.440
200,
one 10 and two 30.
That ain't bad.

747
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:06.570
Um,
he built,
this isn't about you.
It's about the fucking question.
You're right,

748
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:11.430
you're right.
I get,
I get distracted.
I get distracted.
Where the fuck am I?
Ah,

749
00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:15.510
Jesus Christ.
And there's another way I'm,
I'm trying to learn French.

750
00:45:15.511 --> 00:45:20.511
I go to the Montreal Canadiens website and I go onto the French side and,

751
00:45:21.421 --> 00:45:25.470
uh,
I know sacrilegious,
but I fucking do it.
And I,
um,

752
00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:27.683
<v 1>okay.</v>

753
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:28.890
<v 2>What did I say?
Uh,</v>

754
00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.940
something learning the hard way the last time,
like the print days,

755
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:39.920
uh,
something dear as of the ire.
I can kind of read it.

756
00:45:39.921 --> 00:45:41.690
I still can't fucking speak it.
I stink at it,

757
00:45:41.691 --> 00:45:45.200
but at least I'm getting to the point where I can kind of read,
you know,

758
00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:46.700
at a decent level.

759
00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.390
I've been going on youtube and I've been watching these fucking,
you know,
they,

760
00:45:50.391 --> 00:45:53.480
they'd like kids shows.
I swear to God,
I'm going to get put on a list,

761
00:45:53.481 --> 00:45:55.550
but I'm learning.
I'm learning.

762
00:45:55.551 --> 00:45:59.730
I'm fucking read it while they're just going like the cat.
The cat says me out,

763
00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:04.670
you know,
meow cat meow.
Oh,
look at that dog.
Oh Ho,
Ho,
Ho.
They do it all in French,

764
00:46:04.671 --> 00:46:08.730
right?
Little Shit shut.
It was all.

765
00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:15.290
Um,
all right,
big fan.
Are you planning a trip to Belgium in the future?
Uh,

766
00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:20.210
can't wait to see you life alive onstage.
Great Brain Greg.
Humor.

767
00:46:20.211 --> 00:46:24.190
Love your show.
I am absolutely 100% going to get there at some point.
Um,

768
00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:29.590
this year I am planning a tour of Eastern Europe and then my usual run through,

769
00:46:30.921 --> 00:46:31.754
uh,

770
00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:36.850
the widest people of all time from Finland all the way over to Iceland and a,

771
00:46:37.011 --> 00:46:41.050
I'm planning to end in Iceland and uh,

772
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:47.300
spend an extra couple of days there at the blue lagoon spa and you got to do it

773
00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:52.820
and you should go during the winter when all the fucking tourist or not there.

774
00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.450
You want to be there when there's snow on the ground.
I mean,

775
00:46:56.451 --> 00:46:59.300
right now I don't know if the northern lights is still probably missed it by
now,

776
00:46:59.301 --> 00:47:02.480
but like that's one that's like a bucket list thing for me.
I want to go there,

777
00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:05.330
see the fucking northern lights.
When I went there,

778
00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:10.340
I felt like I was on the top of the earth and it was the bluest place I'd ever

779
00:47:10.341 --> 00:47:14.540
been to in my life.
Sky was so fucking blew.
It was crazy.

780
00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.190
And um,

781
00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:18.100
<v 1>okay,</v>

782
00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:21.870
<v 2>tell he's right to everybody.
You always flies past it,
but he goes right by it.</v>

783
00:47:21.871 --> 00:47:24.830
Just fucking,
you got to go to it.
Um,

784
00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:26.700
I gotta tell you when to take a shower there.
You got Yo,

785
00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:30.370
you are going to taste fucking Selfa.
Um,
that's a little gross,

786
00:47:30.371 --> 00:47:33.100
but other than that,
that's fantastic.
Okay.

787
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:36.070
So I will definitely be there hopefully by the end of the year.

788
00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:40.750
Our painting of Jesus laughing Dear Billy Christ,

789
00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:42.970
my inlaws have had this.

790
00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:47.590
Hank have had this hanging in their house since I've known them and I get a good

791
00:47:47.591 --> 00:47:51.670
chuckle every time I see it.
Hope you do too,
man.
At least one artist,

792
00:47:51.671 --> 00:47:54.040
his depicts the guy is a jolly man.

793
00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:58.630
Now I gotta go back because I copied and pasted,
pasted it.

794
00:47:58.631 --> 00:48:01.890
Did it copied and pasted.
Oh

795
00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:03.870
<v 1>yeah.</v>

796
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:08.550
<v 2>Yeah.
It doesn't even look like Jesus.
I got a while.
We got to,</v>

797
00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:10.980
we got a tweet that,
uh,
that photo out.

798
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:14.103
<v 1>Okay.</v>

799
00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:18.400
<v 2>What made them laugh like that?
Somebody who's probably like,
hey,
you know,
I uh,</v>

800
00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:22.880
Bang a hooker like you,
uh,
do I still have a chance to get to heaven?

801
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:26.360
You know,
he could read and laughing like that.

802
00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:32.100
I'm going to be hanging on a cross like me.
They have freckles.
Um,
all right,

803
00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:36.600
I'll definitely,
I'll have to post it.
I'm shitting on my lower back again.

804
00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:40.450
How does this happen?
I just slide down the fucking couch.
Um,

805
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:46.730
alright.
Girlfriends,
dysfunctional family.
All right,

806
00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:49.970
dear Billy boy.
A huge fan of pockets.
Thank you.
Anyways,

807
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:51.980
I am a male in his early twenties,

808
00:48:51.981 --> 00:48:54.710
living in a small one bedroom apartment with my girlfriend.

809
00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:59.240
Recently my girlfriend's mother has received a new job position that's much

810
00:48:59.241 --> 00:49:03.470
closer to us and she is currently in the process of looking for a new place in

811
00:49:03.471 --> 00:49:08.100
our area.
Oh,
Ooh.

812
00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:13.130
Gj I am all for my girlfriend being able to be closer to her family.

813
00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:16.860
Why?
Why would you be all for that?

814
00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:20.280
Be All for it if they're cool.
I'm telling you right now,

815
00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:25.260
do not marry anybody who does not have a cool fucking family.
Okay?

816
00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:28.110
Cause those motherfuckers are going to be in your house.

817
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:32.250
You think you're going to marry her and then Yay.
All right.
Take it easy.

818
00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:36.150
[inaudible] just going to fucking Welser out the door for your wedding.

819
00:49:36.151 --> 00:49:37.950
Now they're going to be calling your house.

820
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:40.110
They're going to be common over there going,

821
00:49:40.111 --> 00:49:44.010
I want to fucking play with your kids.
Okay?
Those people are,

822
00:49:44.011 --> 00:49:46.500
you are marrying into the fucking family.

823
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:50.640
So right now I think what you're doing is you're trying to be a modern man,

824
00:49:50.641 --> 00:49:53.610
so you're just automatically going lay.
I don't,
I,
I'm all for it.

825
00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.480
I'm all for you expressing your opinions and your mother.

826
00:49:57.481 --> 00:50:01.810
Be right across the fucking street.
Listen,
I'm probably projecting here.

827
00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:05.680
Um,
like I said,
thank God,
thank Christ.

828
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:11.770
Um,
the lovely Nia has a wonderful family.
Um,
thank God,

829
00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:16.780
thank Christ.
Because I know people in that situation,
in that situation,

830
00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:20.110
like fucking misery,

831
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:24.520
the misery of the family.
Like,
you know,

832
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:28.920
they retire and then they just move to where you are and then they just come

833
00:50:28.921 --> 00:50:33.690
over all the fucking time and they have no fucking clue how annoying they are.

834
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:37.180
And then if the wife doesn't fucking say anything,
you're,

835
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:41.350
you got to step up off dude.
Fucking shit show.
All right.

836
00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:44.510
Recently my girlfriends will blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah blah.
Uh,
I,

837
00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:48.930
I'm all for my girlfriend being able to be closer to her family as I enjoy their

838
00:50:48.931 --> 00:50:52.620
company as well.
Oh Shit.
You know what?
I didn't read that part.
Sorry.
Uh,

839
00:50:52.621 --> 00:50:56.920
but the whole moving situation is starting to become a bit of a headache and it

840
00:50:56.921 --> 00:51:00.030
starting to impede on our own lives.
Yeah.
See,
you're young,

841
00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:03.530
you're in your early twenties.
Okay.
Here we go.

842
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.140
My girlfriend's mother is currently in between places and might stay with us

843
00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:12.070
during the week.
However,
this is not the worst of it.

844
00:51:12.071 --> 00:51:15.820
My girlfriend has three other siblings that her mother provides care for.

845
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:17.530
Two brothers and one sister.

846
00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:21.520
Her oldest brother in particular is a bit of a black sheep.

847
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:26.530
He is easily agitated by the smallest requests like cleaning up after himself or

848
00:51:26.531 --> 00:51:28.060
remembering to lock the door.

849
00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:32.290
He is careless when it comes to using other people's belongings and does not

850
00:51:32.291 --> 00:51:35.500
clean up after himself.
Well,
you know what,

851
00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:38.980
that fuck that he can't stay there then I would,

852
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:43.060
I would be a bit more forgiving if he was younger than I am,

853
00:51:43.061 --> 00:51:44.800
but he too was in his early twenties.

854
00:51:44.801 --> 00:51:47.440
Like me now having to deal with a family member,

855
00:51:47.441 --> 00:51:51.940
like this may not sound like an issue.
No
Dude,

856
00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:55.870
this is,
this is,
this is make them,
I'm breaking out in hives reading this thing.

857
00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:58.360
This is how much of a fucking issue this is.
Uh,

858
00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:03.480
especially if your girlfriend does not address what Dosha brother is.

859
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:07.780
That's what you need.
Okay.
That's the keys to the castle.
Okay.

860
00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:13.030
If there's someone in,
you know,
whatever,
if you're a woman dating a guy,
right?

861
00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:14.480
If,
if he has some,
if,

862
00:52:14.481 --> 00:52:18.520
if his sister's a cunt and he won't address it on any level.

863
00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:23.380
I'm not saying he literally has to drop the fucking,
you know the scene up there,

864
00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:27.460
but you got,
you got,
you got to fucking are,
you got to address it.

865
00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:34.450
Okay.
You got a fucking addressing.
All right.
So anyways,

866
00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.520
now having to deal with this from up above.

867
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:41.130
Do with member.
Like this may not sound like an issue today,

868
00:52:41.131 --> 00:52:44.000
but I learned that my girlfriend's mother asked to bring,
okay.

869
00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:49.170
My girlfriend's brother with her to stay with us for a few days.
Let's face it,

870
00:52:49.171 --> 00:52:51.360
will probably be longer than that.

871
00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:55.320
After seeing firsthand how he acts with other people,
especially as family,

872
00:52:55.321 --> 00:52:57.180
I want to say no and be done with it.

873
00:52:57.450 --> 00:53:00.660
But I'm sure this will open up more issues between myself and my girlfriend,

874
00:53:00.661 --> 00:53:04.080
her mother,
and possibly her brother.
Yeah.
It'll bring up greatest shoes.

875
00:53:04.081 --> 00:53:08.060
The fact that her brother's a fucking selfish
dude.

876
00:53:08.061 --> 00:53:12.050
You are right now in the beginning of creating your adult life.

877
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:16.680
So when you feel no,
you say no.
All right.

878
00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:21.290
And if your girlfriend gets fucking pissed,
then fuck her.
Okay?

879
00:53:21.291 --> 00:53:24.620
If she wants to break up with you,
you know what you did,
dude,
you just,

880
00:53:24.621 --> 00:53:28.110
you've just away from what you know,
what you think.
You're fat,

881
00:53:28.111 --> 00:53:29.250
you're fast forward,

882
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.240
you're fast forwarding through the fucking nightmare,

883
00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:36.810
and you're getting to the inevitable end of the fucking relationship without you

884
00:53:36.811 --> 00:53:38.370
being legally bonded to them,

885
00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:42.510
without you having kids that have fucking look like her and just remind you of

886
00:53:42.511 --> 00:53:45.300
them every fucking time it mind.
You are her.
Every time you see him,

887
00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:49.110
this is what you have to do.
You have to listen to your gut and life.

888
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:52.140
You've got will tell you,
you saying,
I don't want to do this,

889
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:55.800
but then what happens is social politeness kicks in.
Ah,
you know,

890
00:53:55.801 --> 00:53:58.050
it's only for a few days,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

891
00:53:58.170 --> 00:54:02.700
I don't want to fuck all that.
Fuck all of that.

892
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:05.220
I'm not saying that you have to say it the way I'm saying it,

893
00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:07.560
but you have to have a sit down and just be like,
listen,

894
00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:10.980
I don't mind if you mother stay here,
but I'm not comfortable with your brother.

895
00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:14.730
Stay in here.
And she says,
why it's my brother and be like,

896
00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:18.720
because he's inconsiderate and he's reckless with a personal belongings.

897
00:54:18.721 --> 00:54:20.910
He forgets to lock the door and all that.
And um,

898
00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:25.650
I don't think he's a responsible person and just let it sit there and if she has

899
00:54:25.651 --> 00:54:27.710
a fucking problem with it,
who gives a fuck?

900
00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:31.170
I don't do you not to be disrespectful.
Just be like,
I don't share the,

901
00:54:31.171 --> 00:54:33.690
your viewpoint.
And I live here too when I'm saying I'm saying no,

902
00:54:33.691 --> 00:54:37.290
he can't stay here and then she'll have nothing to say other than,

903
00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:38.970
so you saying you can't stay here.

904
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.710
She'll just start repeating what you're saying.
It'd be like,

905
00:54:40.711 --> 00:54:41.610
that is what I'm saying.

906
00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:46.200
And then you let her huff and you let her puff and do all the fucking shit she's

907
00:54:46.201 --> 00:54:49.830
going to do and you don't let that fucking Douche step into the house.

908
00:54:49.831 --> 00:54:53.100
And let it,
here's the thing dude,
what are you,
what do you have to lose here?

909
00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:54.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

910
00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:58.120
<v 2>Other than your own happiness,
you got to put a value on it anyway.</v>

911
00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:01.600
So let me just continue on here.
Um,

912
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:06.280
he says after seeing firsthand how he acts with other people,

913
00:55:06.281 --> 00:55:10.370
especially as family.
I want to say no,
but I'm sure there's open up more.

914
00:55:10.371 --> 00:55:11.560
It's just between myself,
my girlfriend,

915
00:55:11.561 --> 00:55:15.790
her mother and possibly her brother as it is an issue with my girlfriend and I

916
00:55:15.791 --> 00:55:19.330
have argued about it in the past.
Oh yeah.
So you've already done it?
Yeah Dude.

917
00:55:19.331 --> 00:55:21.640
All right.
You're already knocked down the,
you already kicked in the door.

918
00:55:21.641 --> 00:55:26.390
Walk in.
What would you do in this situation?
I think I've already said it.
Uh,

919
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:29.650
and is there any sort of advice you can give me if her brother does come to stay

920
00:55:29.651 --> 00:55:30.281
for a few days,

921
00:55:30.281 --> 00:55:34.480
how should I treat him knowing he probably just get agitated with me telling him

922
00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:37.240
to clean up after himself.
Thanks and go fuck yourself dude.

923
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:40.600
This is the deal dude.
This is,
this is non negotiable.

924
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:45.340
This is non fucking negotiable.

925
00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:49.960
Okay.
This is your life.
All right?

926
00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:55.000
And he's a fucking dose.
And
listen man,

927
00:55:55.001 --> 00:55:58.750
if your girlfriend can't see what a fucking asshole this guy is due.

928
00:55:58.751 --> 00:56:03.520
Can you imagine if your brother was like this and it made your girlfriend feel

929
00:56:03.521 --> 00:56:07.120
uncomfortable?
Would your brother be each staying with you?

930
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:10.750
He makes me uncomfortable.
I don't know.
He's weird.
He doesn't pick up.

931
00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:15.460
He smells my me undies.
Whatever the fuck he's doing.
You'd be like,
that's it.

932
00:56:15.850 --> 00:56:16.870
You can't,
you can't be here.

933
00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:24.510
And when he woke up cause your red jerk off.
All right,

934
00:56:24.511 --> 00:56:28.050
this is super right down the street.
Good luck to Ya.
You know?

935
00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.313
<v 1>MMM.</v>

936
00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:34.760
<v 0>I got to tell you this.
This,
this might be,</v>

937
00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:41.310
this might be the old right there,
Fred,
for your fucking relationship.
Okay.

938
00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:44.330
You might have to throw down the gauntlet.

939
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

940
00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:49.550
<v 0>All right.
I got to tell you dude,
if this,
if this fucking asshole</v>

941
00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:53.330
is already making you this fucking miserable,

942
00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:59.970
okay?
Just the idea of him staying with you for a couple,
two,
three days.

943
00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.820
All right?
Are you really going to marry this woman?

944
00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:06.420
You get to marry into that with that fucking shit show.

945
00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:07.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

946
00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:10.500
<v 0>And they'll be there.
You hit any big name.
Very fucking see him.</v>

947
00:57:10.501 --> 00:57:14.070
Fuck that until he goes out and he fucks his whole fucking life up.
But you know,

948
00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:16.390
and what happens,
you do you,
I'm assuming you,

949
00:57:16.410 --> 00:57:18.570
you're planning on being successful in life,
right?

950
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:22.170
Which means you're going to go make a big bag of loot and get yourself a whip,

951
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:23.543
right?
Sorry.

952
00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:24.693
<v 1>MMM,</v>

953
00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:27.690
<v 0>no,
you can have a nice car.
You have a nice house,
you know,</v>

954
00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.730
beautiful wife again of all that type of shit.
And you know it,

955
00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:33.330
you know what comes to think like,
well,
how come I don't have that?
It's like,

956
00:57:33.331 --> 00:57:34.230
well,
because you didn't work for,

957
00:57:34.231 --> 00:57:36.230
it's stupid and they're not going to think that and they,

958
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:39.060
they're going to want to come around and they're gonna want fucking handouts.

959
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:43.350
And if she,
and if,
if that fucking jerk off knows that his sister is a big softy,

960
00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:47.250
she's gonna use her to get to you and all the shit that you fucking work for.

961
00:57:47.251 --> 00:57:50.300
Okay.
I'm painting a very bleak scenario here,
but,
um,

962
00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:51.710
<v 1>okay.</v>

963
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:54.260
<v 0>Dude,
you just,
you say,
no,
he can't stay here.</v>

964
00:57:55.830 --> 00:57:56.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

965
00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:58.520
<v 0>You know,
and if it really comes down to just be like,
listen,</v>

966
00:57:58.580 --> 00:57:59.413
I don't like the guy.

967
00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:01.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

968
00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:04.580
<v 2>And I don't think it's,</v>

969
00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:07.550
I just think it's how he's wired because you turned out great.

970
00:58:08.250 --> 00:58:10.190
You guys both had the same fucking parents.

971
00:58:10.191 --> 00:58:12.650
I don't know what happened to that guy,
but he's a fucking,

972
00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:16.550
I don't say fucking that guy age.
Just like,
I don't want him in my,

973
00:58:16.551 --> 00:58:17.384
I don't want him here.

974
00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:20.810
Your mother can stay a plus that it's only a one bedroom apartment,
you know?

975
00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:24.560
So we're going to be on top of each other and I can't deal with that guy when

976
00:58:24.561 --> 00:58:27.980
I'm at your mother's house.
Forget about in our one bedroom apartment.

977
00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:29.090
I don't want that guy here.

978
00:58:29.091 --> 00:58:32.690
I don't want his balls dangling in our fucking commode.

979
00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:37.010
I don't want his pubes in my shower.
I don't want his hands in my,
on the fridge.

980
00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:40.920
I just don't want him to be,
I don't want him here.
You know what's funny?

981
00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:42.780
I don't even know this guy and I fucking hate him.

982
00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:46.710
There's no fucking way,
dude,

983
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:51.360
please can you please do this for yourself.

984
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:55.440
And this is a great exercise to have,
you know,

985
00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:57.810
for both men and women.
You can flip this around,

986
00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:01.470
like learning how to stand up to the person that you're with.

987
00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:04.380
You got to learn how to do that.
And you just,
sometimes you just have to,

988
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:07.560
you've got to have a fight.
You just have to have a fight.
And um,

989
00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:12.790
and there was a freedom to not giving a fuck in a good way.

990
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.880
What people think about you.
I mean,
do you,

991
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:20.260
who gives a fuck if some piece of selfish shit doesn't like you?

992
00:59:20.261 --> 00:59:24.000
What the fuck do you,
I mean,

993
00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:28.830
I would just openly,
I don't like you.
Yes,
you,

994
00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:31.380
I don't like you.
I think you were a piece of garbage.

995
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:33.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>

996
00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:35.890
<v 2>And then we looked at his girlfriend.
Looks at your girlfriend or his sister.</v>

997
00:59:35.891 --> 00:59:37.540
He just said,
yeah,
don't worry.
I already told him,

998
00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:43.173
<v 1>ah,</v>

999
00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.930
<v 2>sir,
please don't let him stay in your place and please write right in and please</v>

1000
00:59:47.931 --> 00:59:50.060
tell me.
Please tell me what happened.

1001
00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:51.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1002
00:59:51.310 --> 00:59:56.140
<v 2>I don't know why,
but I live for moments like this in life,
you know,</v>

1003
00:59:56.890 --> 00:59:59.890
as much as I like making people laugh and that type of thing,

1004
00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:03.880
I get even more enjoyment telling pieces of shit.

1005
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:05.703
No,

1006
01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:09.700
it's one of the great things and just the look on their fucking face because the

1007
01:00:09.701 --> 01:00:14.320
reason why a lot of pieces of shit are pieces of shit because people politely

1008
01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:15.430
maneuver around them.

1009
01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:16.900
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1010
01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.690
<v 2>And when you can get that fucking Mitt right in their face,
you know,</v>

1011
01:00:19.691 --> 01:00:23.980
put your hand right in their forehead.
That's about far enough there sparky.
Ah,

1012
01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:26.350
it's just,
it's one of the great failings in life.
I think.

1013
01:00:26.351 --> 01:00:29.590
That's why God made Douche bags.
Just so you know.

1014
01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:31.360
Someone like yourself can have that feeling.

1015
01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.150
I'm really coming off arrogant here for,
you know,

1016
01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:38.900
I'm probably the Douche bag too anyways.
All right.

1017
01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:43.850
Fiance's wedding plants a day or Billy blue band blue bland.
The fuck is that?

1018
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:47.930
Um,
first let me say,
I can't see,

1019
01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.510
I can't wait to see you in Orlando on May 7th.

1020
01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:53.820
I don't know why I haven't seen you perform live yet,
but you're on my left.

1021
01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:57.620
You are the last on my top 10 comedians to see before I die.
Oh Jesus.

1022
01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:01.690
There's way more than you should see the net,
but I am,

1023
01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:05.540
I am very flattered that I am one of the 10.
Okay.
So he says,

1024
01:01:05.541 --> 01:01:08.720
I've been engaged for three years now.
All right.
Dumper.

1025
01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.470
You don't want to marry her.
Do I really need to read the rest of this?

1026
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:18.660
The fuck is engaged for three years.
He said,

1027
01:01:18.661 --> 01:01:23.240
and me and my lady are in the first steps of finally planning our wedding.
I'm,

1028
01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.670
I am simple and um,

1029
01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:29.130
and am okay with something small and would rather save money for our honeymoon

1030
01:01:29.131 --> 01:01:31.080
and down payment on the house and let me guess.

1031
01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.970
She wants to spend a ton of fucking money.

1032
01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:37.530
My fiance wants a destination theme wedding.

1033
01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:42.090
I'm not opposed to compromise and have a destination wedding,

1034
01:01:42.091 --> 01:01:45.600
but she wants to theme to be the Little Mermaid in Hawaii.

1035
01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:50.880
She's adamant about this and has these horrible outfits picked out for the whole

1036
01:01:50.881 --> 01:01:55.650
wedding party to where?
Including myself as Neptune,
I don't believe this.

1037
01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:58.870
I'm calling bullshit.

1038
01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:01.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1039
01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:05.970
<v 2>But you know what,
as always I'll read it like it's true.
Um,
I'm 37 and she is 28,</v>

1040
01:02:05.971 --> 01:02:07.980
if that matters.
I sincerely love her,

1041
01:02:07.981 --> 01:02:12.120
but she won't let this go and I absolutely refuse to go through with that.

1042
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:14.340
I don't want to lose her in my life,

1043
01:02:14.341 --> 01:02:18.630
but I've tried everything I can think of to talk her out of it and honestly,

1044
01:02:18.631 --> 01:02:22.670
it's a breaker for me.
Please tell me your thoughts and if you have any advice,

1045
01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.100
I'd be very grateful.
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
All right,

1046
01:02:25.101 --> 01:02:27.370
well if this isn't a joke question,
uh,

1047
01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.220
you've been engaged for three fucking years.
Okay,
that's weird.

1048
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:35.390
I think there's something going on there and uh,
you know,
you're,

1049
01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:38.300
you're a little bit countries is a little bit rock and roll forever that the old

1050
01:02:38.301 --> 01:02:43.250
fucking Donny and Marie show usually sometimes opposites,
you know,
you know,

1051
01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:47.630
she's that party you,
she completes you.
I don't,
I don't think she's at this.

1052
01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.280
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1053
01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.200
<v 2>This is a shit show.
If this is true,
you are,
you're,</v>

1054
01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:58.580
do you understand that when you inevitably get divorced from this fucking woman

1055
01:02:58.581 --> 01:03:03.540
that you are going to get no sympathy from anybody?
They will first be that,

1056
01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:06.340
oh my God,
a divorce.
I heard,
you know,
other than losing a loved one,

1057
01:03:06.341 --> 01:03:07.660
that's the most stressful thing ever.

1058
01:03:07.661 --> 01:03:12.130
But when you tell the story that you dressed like Neptune at your own fucking

1059
01:03:12.131 --> 01:03:15.130
wedding,
right?
Then every single,
yeah,
well,
you know,
I fucking told you.
She goes,

1060
01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:22.810
yeah dude,
you walk away from it.
You're 37,
you find you'll meet somebody else.

1061
01:03:22.811 --> 01:03:25.210
Okay?
You get on it.
You don't have a biological clock.

1062
01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:27.310
This is one of the great things about being a dude,
you know,

1063
01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:30.840
but it all balances out cause we die eight years before them,
you know,

1064
01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:32.530
so they get the little,
little bit,
you know,

1065
01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.800
live a little bit longer sitting in that coffee house,
you know,

1066
01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:39.880
eating those fucking weird chocolates.
Um,
he said,

1067
01:03:41.170 --> 01:03:45.460
oh,
this is somebody else's.
I'm sorry.
I thought that's how he signed off.
Um,
yeah,

1068
01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.260
I would walk away from this whole fucking thing.

1069
01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:51.490
How many more red flags need to be shook in your face.

1070
01:03:52.570 --> 01:03:55.990
You just walk away from the whole fucking thing.

1071
01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.920
Phi.
You see?
Oh my God dude.

1072
01:03:59.921 --> 01:04:02.980
What kind of fucking issues does she have that she wants to have a little,

1073
01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:06.880
oh my God.
She one of those women that has said Gugu Gaga,

1074
01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:10.540
creepy ass fucking voice.
She's talks,
talks like she's fucking six.

1075
01:04:12.010 --> 01:04:12.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1076
01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:17.360
<v 2>Oh God,
that gives you the fucking chills.
Can you be a fucking adult over here?</v>

1077
01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.740
What do you,
what do we do?
You mean what if you wanted a Scooby doo theme?

1078
01:04:21.741 --> 01:04:26.640
Fucking wedding,
right?
You wanted her to dress like fucking that with Dell.

1079
01:04:26.641 --> 01:04:29.210
The Janeane Garofalo redheaded one,
you know,

1080
01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:33.080
and her sister to dress like Daphne and you are going to be fucking shaggy.

1081
01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:36.950
The best man was going to dress like Fred with that scarf around his fuck it.

1082
01:04:36.951 --> 01:04:41.480
Why don't we,
why?
Why do
I don't believe that question?
I just don't.

1083
01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:45.230
Okay.
And if you fucking marry her,
you deserve it.

1084
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.440
You know?
And when you come crying up to me,

1085
01:04:48.441 --> 01:04:50.900
I'm going to steal from that fucking tour guy I fucking told you.

1086
01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:56.270
Alright squatch hey,
Billy Bird legs.

1087
01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.070
That's fucking hilarious.

1088
01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:02.780
I've been listening to you talk about the way you work out of the podcast and I

1089
01:05:02.781 --> 01:05:06.480
got to chime in.
Do some fucking squats.

1090
01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:09.500
Do squats are not a leg exercise.

1091
01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:13.370
They are a compound full body movement.
Oh,
this is already making me tired.

1092
01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.610
Uh,
put a couple of hundred pounds on your back.

1093
01:05:16.611 --> 01:05:19.870
Just push your legs and watch while you're frail.

1094
01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:24.520
Freckled spine gets twisted like a pretzel.
Well,
why would I want to do that?

1095
01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:29.020
Squats and deadlifts,
which I recommend to a

1096
01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:33.700
need you to engage damn near every muscle in your body.

1097
01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:36.580
If you want to put on some real muscle density,

1098
01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:41.200
stop being such a cowardly little kid and learn to squat and dead lift.
Dude,

1099
01:05:41.201 --> 01:05:44.980
I don't want to walk around.
All bulked up,
you know,

1100
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.780
start wearing tank tops.
I'm not trying to do that.
Jesus Christ.
He said,

1101
01:05:49.781 --> 01:05:54.781
I recommend watching Ed c o h n apostrophe s squat and dead lift videos from

1102
01:05:55.691 --> 01:06:00.090
super training on youtube to start to,
I'm not trying to get into the NFL.
Uh,

1103
01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:03.400
then watch the rest of their content and learn what the fuck you're doing.

1104
01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:08.320
I wrote some stuff about my experience with adding squats and dead lifts to my

1105
01:06:08.321 --> 01:06:11.410
routine.
You can read it or not.
Just lift some heavy shit.

1106
01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:14.350
Stop being a bitch and go fuck yourself.
All right.

1107
01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:17.880
I like the way this man speaks and gets right to it.
He's very direct.
Uh,

1108
01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:22.660
my experience when I was younger,
I used,
I used to be a mirror muscles,
guys,

1109
01:06:22.810 --> 01:06:27.610
mirror muscle guy to fuck you talking about dude,
I got a peg board.
I got those.

1110
01:06:27.611 --> 01:06:32.470
Uh,
Tomic fucking uh,
I'm doing all I'm doing.
I'm trying to do like half.

1111
01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:37.330
Um,
what are the,
uh,
American Ninja Warrior fucking thing.

1112
01:06:37.331 --> 01:06:40.440
I'm building that in my garage.
All right.

1113
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:45.510
You with your fucking Schwartzenegger workout from 1978 stop acting like you're

1114
01:06:46.571 --> 01:06:50.050
in the future.
You fucking cunt.
I was decent.
You know,
you came in,

1115
01:06:50.051 --> 01:06:51.310
you were talking a little bit fresh.

1116
01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:54.720
You need to fucking stand down a little bit here.
Um,
he said,

1117
01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:58.330
I got older and I started working in a chocolate factory.
You know,

1118
01:06:58.331 --> 01:06:59.650
everything seems like a lie this,

1119
01:06:59.651 --> 01:07:02.740
but you worked in a Cha Cha will you in a fucking tree making cookies.

1120
01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:07.960
Amazingly doing car curls and benching one 35 after spending the day sitting at

1121
01:07:07.961 --> 01:07:12.130
my desk shoveling free chocolate and my face did nothing to stop my belly from

1122
01:07:12.131 --> 01:07:16.420
growing.
Well yeah,
we'll neither were doing squats.
Okay.

1123
01:07:16.421 --> 01:07:21.010
If you don't fucking eat anything else but cookies.
Anyways,
he goes,

1124
01:07:21.011 --> 01:07:25.060
now I squat bench and deadlift like a power lifter and I am stronger and more

1125
01:07:25.061 --> 01:07:29.590
jacked than I have ever bent.
Yeah,
and you stop eating chocolate.
Um,

1126
01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:34.090
not only do I actually have legs now,
but my chest arms and back traps,

1127
01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:36.070
everything are bigger than ever.
I just,

1128
01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:38.890
I can't recommend the videos from super training enough.
All right,

1129
01:07:38.891 --> 01:07:41.750
I'll check it out.
The guys are hilarious,
strongest fuck and there,

1130
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.710
there is tons of great info on there.
Anyways,
they appreciate the podcasts.

1131
01:07:44.711 --> 01:07:47.980
Best of luck with the new home gym.
And again,
go fuck yourself.
All right,
cool.

1132
01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:51.400
I will definitely check that out.
Thank you so much for that information.

1133
01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:52.570
Once again for people at home.

1134
01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:57.600
Ed said Coa and apostrophe s for some reason I don't.

1135
01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:02.410
It looks like it's missing something.
But anyways,

1136
01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:06.370
it's called a super training.
So if you spell the name kind of like that,

1137
01:08:06.371 --> 01:08:09.130
it ought to come up in your,
uh,
your Google search.

1138
01:08:09.131 --> 01:08:14.050
They're okay about driving and diving into caves.
Uh,

1139
01:08:14.110 --> 01:08:16.930
hey bill,
you were talking divers with those caves.

1140
01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:21.190
Here's a documentary of Finnish guys who legally,
illegally,

1141
01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:25.330
who go illegally to their dead friends bodies.

1142
01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:31.700
What from their last trip?

1143
01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:36.170
I think it was made illegal to go there after they die because it was too

1144
01:08:36.171 --> 01:08:41.000
dangerous to go to those cases.
But they went anyway and made a movie about it.

1145
01:08:41.001 --> 01:08:43.970
Come to Finland soon and go fuck yourself.
Well,

1146
01:08:43.971 --> 01:08:47.690
why don't they retrieve the bodies?
Is everybody lying to me this week?

1147
01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:50.540
Why can't you be honest?
All right.
The last one here.

1148
01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:55.040
A girlfriend is good friends with dude.
She met on Tinder.

1149
01:08:57.530 --> 01:09:00.620
Uh,
hey,
Billy red Burke,
uh,

1150
01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:04.250
Bork kind of I guess is supposed to be like Ray Bork red book.
Um,

1151
01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:08.540
so recently I was talking with my girlfriend about one of her guy friends.

1152
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:12.080
The two of them seem pretty close.

1153
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:14.720
He did a photo shoot for a tee shirt company.

1154
01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:19.700
She's starting in and she even said,
we're like the same person.

1155
01:09:20.690 --> 01:09:24.800
Yeah,
dude,
it's sour.
It's over.
She hasn't blown him yet.

1156
01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:28.230
She's gonna walk away something she's has said,
uh,

1157
01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:31.580
something she has said to me as we're talking,

1158
01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:36.640
she reveals that she met this dude off of the dating and actually just about

1159
01:09:37.221 --> 01:09:39.110
fucking app Tinder before

1160
01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:43.850
you wrote this so bad before she,
we got together.

1161
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:47.270
I'm just going to read it how you wrote it.
I tried to play it.
Cool letter,

1162
01:09:47.271 --> 01:09:50.230
talk about him and just brush it off as whatever,
dude,

1163
01:09:50.231 --> 01:09:54.140
this is the brainwashing of the American male now where everything is,

1164
01:09:54.141 --> 01:09:57.440
if you even question a woman,
it's like,
wait,
was that date rape?

1165
01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:03.350
So you just ignore all your fucking instincts here.
I tried to play it.
Cool.
Yeah.

1166
01:10:03.351 --> 01:10:06.740
Her douche bag brother who does totally inconsiderate,
wants to stay here.

1167
01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:11.570
You know,
I'm all for that.
You're not all four that your soul is screaming.

1168
01:10:11.571 --> 01:10:12.404
No.

1169
01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:13.780
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1170
01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:17.140
<v 2>you're playing it cool cause you're not cool with it.
Yeah.</v>

1171
01:10:17.141 --> 01:10:18.700
Why don't you go hang out with some fuck buddy.

1172
01:10:18.701 --> 01:10:21.940
You met on Tinder and see how she fucking likes it.
Right.
Anyways,

1173
01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:25.660
well the two of them texts quite a lot and the other night she received

1174
01:10:25.661 --> 01:10:28.270
something I think from him and she laughed.

1175
01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:33.340
Now I am ordinarily not a nosy tight,
but the situation is weird.

1176
01:10:33.341 --> 01:10:36.610
So I asked what's funny,
she flipped.
She said,

1177
01:10:36.611 --> 01:10:39.850
I'm being too nosy and trying to pry into your personal life.
Oh my God.

1178
01:10:39.851 --> 01:10:42.790
And then did you give her a sidekick right out of the fucking bed?

1179
01:10:44.530 --> 01:10:47.200
He goes,
I mean she really flipped a shit about it.

1180
01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:50.050
She claims I'm being paranoid and that they are just friend.

1181
01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:55.130
I Dunno Billy.
If they've fucked,
what's to say they want it to,

1182
01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:59.600
what do you mean you don't know?
He finishes it with,
am I being paranoid?

1183
01:10:59.601 --> 01:11:04.490
Should I not give a shit or should I kick this check to the curb dude.

1184
01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:08.480
Punter to the curb.
Right in the seat of a fucking lion pants.

1185
01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.620
Yeah.
Yeah.

1186
01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:13.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1187
01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.330
<v 0>And I would just say,
why you breaking up?
I go,</v>

1188
01:11:15.331 --> 01:11:19.830
cause you cause the guy on Tinder complete.
You go get with him.

1189
01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.650
Oh my God,
you're being paranoid.
No I'm not.

1190
01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.920
You guys are fucking in my heart to hearts.
You guys are fucking,

1191
01:11:25.921 --> 01:11:30.780
and if you're not,
you're Gunna,
and to be honest with you,
you probably should be

1192
01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:35.130
your fucking laying in bed with me giggling about his God damn texts.

1193
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:39.600
Just go over there and suck his dick already.
They give me my keys.

1194
01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.790
That's it.
It's fucking over.
All right.
That's the podcast for this week.

1195
01:11:44.791 --> 01:11:46.590
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you Thursday.
