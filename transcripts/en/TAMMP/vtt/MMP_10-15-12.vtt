00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.920
Hey everyone.
It's Bill Burr,
the affable host of the Monday morning podcast.

2
00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:09.620
Before we get started with this week's wonderful episode,

3
00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:13.280
I wanted to take time out to talk about my new comedy network that I started

4
00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:17.900
with the wonderful Al Madrigal,
um,
name of the websites,

5
00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:21.710

uh,

00:00:21.711 --> 00:00:23.090
It's our own podcast page.

7
00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:26.750
We have what we like to think is the best collection of podcasts out there.

8
00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:30.740
And it's growing by the day we got my Monday morning podcast,

9
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.610
we got the a skeptic tank with Ari Shaffir Harlan highway,

10
00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:39.230
the long shot walking the room.
Jake Johansen's,
Jake this minivan,

11
00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:42.140
men with Al Madrigal,
the flop house.
Your mom's house.

12
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:47.141
Saw a deep shit with baron Vaughn and the laugh spin podcast.

13
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.140
And this week we are proud to,

14
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.070
to be adding the Tom Rhodes podcasts and Jackie Cassian's Dork forest.

15
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.220
And we got some more coming up.
Um,

16
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.700

24
00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:28.760
absolutely hilarious.
He's one of my favorite comics.
And,
uh,

25
00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:31.660
when I first moved out here to la,
he was one of the first guys I saw and I was,

26
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.490
I was like,
thank God.
Here's a guy can watch every night.

27
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:37.400
So please go and watch him.
And I'm like,
I said,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.910
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.020
<v 2>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

34
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:58.440
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

35
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:01.830
October 15th,
2012,

36
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.240
20 to 12 days.
Um,

37
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.910
this is soulful October.

38
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.920
Make sure to wear your fake pink Afros for,

39
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.110
to raise soul awareness in October.

40
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.090
I want to fucking have some sort of counter uh,

41
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.420
awareness thing to try to dip into all this pink.

42
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.710
All this pink that I'm seeing out there.
It's like I got it.

43
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.070
I was aware of it before the month.

44
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.580
<v 0>Okay.</v>

45
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.910
<v 2>Stop jamming it down my throat there.</v>

46
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

47
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.163
<v 2>You know,</v>

48
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.290
we already got a month of it in the NFL breath cancer or we're raising

49
00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:46.030
awareness.
Why don't you raise money to cure it?

50
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.770
<v 0>Okay.</v>

51
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.470
<v 2>Isn't that what you're supposed to be doing?
If you raising awareness,</v>

52
00:02:50.471 --> 00:02:54.880
what exactly does that mean?
They said that on my flight I was on a Delta flight,

53
00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.040
you know,
went to the airport and I'm once

54
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.873
<v 1>again,</v>

55
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.300
<v 2>come fly with me,</v>

56
00:03:03.301 --> 00:03:07.890
you red face fucking cons and I'm flying

57
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.490
<v 1>from New York City to Los Honga lays,
right?</v>

58
00:03:13.491 --> 00:03:17.720
And I get on the flight and I'm looking at the ladies,
right?

59
00:03:17.721 --> 00:03:21.170
The stewardesses,
and they're sitting there in jeans and a pink shirts.

60
00:03:21.171 --> 00:03:25.940
And I was like,
oh
right,
here we go again.

61
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.610
Here we go again.
All right.
So we sit down and they get on the floor.
You know,

62
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.330
they get on the fucking horn there and they go,
thank you for flying delta.

63
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.350
If you could step out of the aisle to help expedite fucking word,

64
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:42.244
I can't stand.

65
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.230
That word does not exist other than in the fucking corporate world.
All right.

66
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.140
To expedite the boarding process,

67
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.380
we'd like to have an on time departure

68
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.050
<v 2>rich.
That's not on me.
That's on you.
Okay.</v>

69
00:03:57.051 --> 00:04:00.470
You said the shit was leaving at fucking 10 past 11.
I didn't.

70
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.770
Why don't you start boarding the fucking thing earlier or at least give us a

71
00:04:03.771 --> 00:04:05.390
little one room back here.

72
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.320
<v 1>So anyways,
of course,
once we get the plane starts going,</v>

73
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.410
she goes,
I'm the captain is still has the seatbelt signs on.

74
00:04:15.411 --> 00:04:17.720
You cannot use anything electronically.

75
00:04:17.721 --> 00:04:21.540
Here's my memorized joke that I say everything flight about electronic stuff.

76
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.680
And then she goes,
so you might've noticed,
um,

77
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.510
the flight attendants are not wearing our usual uniforms.

78
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.020
Yes.
Really?

79
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.690
We're actually wearing jeans and pink shirts to raise breath cancer awareness.

80
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.630
If you'd like to buy a ham sandwich that was put together by a Filipino child

81
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.060
nine weeks ago out in the French Riviera sweatshops section of Nice,

82
00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.800
a portion of the proceeds will be going towards raising breath cancer awareness.

83
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.230
They keep saying that shit raising breast cancer awareness,

84
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.890
shouldn't they be raising money to cure it?
You know,

85
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.920
I think the awareness is out there.
So if you're just raising money,

86
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.370
if I go and buy that fucking cool Bano fucking,
you know,

87
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:17.950
ham and cheese with the pickles,
their sandwich,
right.

88
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.640
I'm buying it thinking that I'm going to help the fucking disease.

89
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.660
It might if you're just doing it to raise breast cancer awareness for that.

90
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:31.450
Am I just giving you money to buy more pink shit?
Is that what I'm doing?

91
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.540
That's what I want to know.
What a,
what am I buying this sandwich for?
You know,

92
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:39.280
it's funny,
you know God damn well this,

93
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:43.960
somebody within that fucking pink organization is pulling down high six figures

94
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.260
for raising breast cancer awareness.
You know they are.

95
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.700
There is somebody right now down at some fucking dealership going,

96
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:55.030
do I buy that overpriced shiny motherfucker or this one?

97
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.800
Alright with fucking,

98
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.680
<v 2>he's got pink fucking twenties in his pocket.</v>

99
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:05.580
Can appeal them off like Kanye West.
Right?
Um,

100
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.463
Kanye West,

101
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.490
<v 0>stop a Dee da Ba ba ba Ba ba Ba.</v>

102
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.110
<v 2>That's my impersonation of his rapping style cause he thinks his crowds are like</v>

103
00:06:16.111 --> 00:06:18.540
borderline retarded and they don't understand words.

104
00:06:18.541 --> 00:06:20.400
So he has to slow down every third one.

105
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.150
<v 0>I'm not saying no,
go no fuck a day.
But then,</v>

106
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.160
<v 2>oh they should rebreak his jar cause he's still looks like a fucking pug.</v>

107
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.230
Um,
oh,
I'm in a mood.
Why in such a country mood bill?

108
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.720
I'll tell you why.
I'll tell you why.

109
00:06:40.721 --> 00:06:44.020
Because I have a 14 hour flight today to fucking Australia and I didn't want to

110
00:06:44.021 --> 00:06:47.770
think about that.
But let's get back to the pink shit.
You know,

111
00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:51.100
one of the classic things that,
uh,
football fans will say,
there'll be like,

112
00:06:51.101 --> 00:06:52.270
well why don't they have,

113
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.510
why don't they have prostate awareness month where they were like Brown stuff?

114
00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.190
<v 0>Uh Huh.
Uh Huh.</v>

115
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.940
<v 2>You know why they don't have prostate,
um,
awareness month,</v>

116
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.580
aside from the fact that guys couldn't organize a fucking fishing trip without

117
00:07:09.581 --> 00:07:11.680
drinking a 12 pack first.
Um,

118
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.830
it's because guys are already watching NFL football.

119
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.310
That's why we're already watching.
There's no way to,
there's no reason.

120
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.190
There's no,
what's the upside
of that?

121
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.460
Reminding us that are asked might fall out someday while we're watching the

122
00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:32.350
fucking overrated Seahawks.
Oh,
I'm going to get to that,

123
00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:35.260
by the way.
I'm going to get to that.
All right.

124
00:07:35.261 --> 00:07:39.130
You've tree hugging fucking Kurt Cobain,

125
00:07:39.131 --> 00:07:43.150
candle lit vigil fucking Douche bags.
I'm going to,
you know,

126
00:07:43.151 --> 00:07:45.010
I'm going to get to you guys right fucking now.

127
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.260
I am so sick of them talking about how fucking,
well before I do that,
let's,

128
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:52.990
let's be honest here.
The Patriots did not deserve to win that game.

129
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:56.380
Tom Brady had a horrible fucking game.
Um,

130
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.430
and our defensive backs just,
I don't know what they're doing.

131
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.580
Can Somebody for the love of God explained to me what the defensive backs on the

132
00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:07.930
New England patriots are doing?

133
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.130
Are they covering the receivers or they just merely giving them an escort down

134
00:08:12.131 --> 00:08:12.964
the field.

135
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.980
We made that fucking rookie look like God Damn Joe Montana,

136
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.500
the amount of fucking jump balls that guy through just through a jump ball,

137
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.600
then the general vicinity and our guys are just running down the field.

138
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.910
Of course with these new fucking uh,
rules.
And this goes on,
on,
on both sides.
The,

139
00:08:32.911 --> 00:08:36.520
the,
the rules in the NFL are just fucking horrific at this point.

140
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.400
Do you see that jets game?
Look,

141
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.770
Andrew luck throws a pic commodities running it into the end zone.

142
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.210
Let's come on over to,
you know,
to try to cause some sort of traffic.

143
00:08:49.211 --> 00:08:52.000
So he goes out of bounds.
It doesn't score.
And guess what?

144
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:57.001
He gets blocked any falls on his ass and call a penalty roughing the

145
00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:58.704
quarterback.

146
00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:00.570
<v 3>Okay.</v>

147
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.150
<v 2>I'm adjunct.
I don't,
I don't get it.
I don't know.</v>

148
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:05.510
There's one of the worst fucking calls I've ever seen in my life other than,

149
00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:09.480
than that fucking call against the Yankees at second base.
Now that,
that,

150
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:13.950
that right there was,
um,
I would investigate that on party.

151
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:18.630
Did you have like,
did you have money on that fucking game?
Whatever,
whatever,

152
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.860
whatever.
So that's bullshit.
That whole,

153
00:09:23.861 --> 00:09:27.000
the whole protecting of the fucking quarterback is such horseshit.

154
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.840
There was one play,
the Patriots,
one of our linebackers came in,
right?

155
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.220
Seattle's quarterback is in the follow through with throwing the ball.

156
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:39.450
He goes to swat the ball.
The ball goes by,
he misses it and part of his forearm,

157
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.800
I mean hit the guy's head.
And I mean not even hard.

158
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.220
He swatting at the ball,
they call roughing the passer.

159
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.130
And that was yet another jump ball that he threw.

160
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.230
And this is the coverage the Patriot's guy has.

161
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.880
He gives him his little little touch.

162
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.750
You're allowed to touch the receiver when within the first five yards.

163
00:09:57.751 --> 00:10:01.020
But I think at this point you're allowed to do it with only two fingers.

164
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.370
You know,
one didn't index fingers or two pinkies in the thumb.

165
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.130
Okay,
you're allowed cause pinkies a shorter,

166
00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:11.880
you're allowed to touch the fucking receiver.
And then after that you just,

167
00:10:11.881 --> 00:10:14.280
all you can do is run next to them.

168
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:20.700
<v 1>This is why if I see one more mediocre fucking jackass throw for 350 fucking</v>

169
00:10:22.991 --> 00:10:26.840
yards,
it's unbelievable.

170
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.930
You,
when I was a kid,
when you played football,
you fucking ran with your guy,

171
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.050
you saw his eyes,
and then you turned around,

172
00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:38.050
you look back at the quarterback and then you hand check the receiver.

173
00:10:38.051 --> 00:10:39.310
You didn't grab his jersey,

174
00:10:39.311 --> 00:10:44.200
you just put your hand back so you knew where the fuck he was.
Okay,

175
00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.000
that's it.
You can't even do that.

176
00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:50.920
So all these fucking guys do now is they just run down the field with them and

177
00:10:50.921 --> 00:10:53.260
then when they see their eyes go up at the last second,

178
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.140
they try to turn around and by then it's,
it's,
it's fucking over.

179
00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.170
By the time they realize the balls there,

180
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.580
the receivers fucking Dick is in his face and then they just sort of grab around

181
00:11:03.581 --> 00:11:06.310
his waist and pull the guy down and they're like,
oh,
I'm not her,

182
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.940
but Dang for fucking Joe blow,

183
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.380
he has 400 yards passing in the second quarter,

184
00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.740
a new NFL record.
It's amazing.

185
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.100
He couldn't carry Dan Marino's fucking jock strap.

186
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.730
But for some reason he just broke one of his records.

187
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.360
<v 2>Ah,
ah.
I swear to God.
I am.</v>

188
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.440
I'm going to stop fucking watching NFL football.

189
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:34.780
<v 3>Okay.</v>

190
00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.980
<v 1>If he can't fucking hit the quarterback and you can't cover the receivers and I</v>

191
00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:43.981
have to watch another fucking guy go 36 for 58 I don't want to see 58 six yard

192
00:11:45.341 --> 00:11:48.040
passes in a game.
I don't want to fucking see it.

193
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:51.063
<v 3>Okay.</v>

194
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:51.840
<v 2>I Dunno.</v>

195
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.560
Maybe they'll make a helmet that will allow them to play football again and I

196
00:11:56.561 --> 00:12:00.550
want to apologize to all those rugby fucking fans.

197
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.810
I was wrong after really watching it this week and I've been on the road for six

198
00:12:04.811 --> 00:12:06.820
straight weeks up to really sitting down there.

199
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:08.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

200
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:12.520
<v 2>Watching the NFL package.
Dude,
I don't even recognize the fucking game anymore.</v>

201
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.480
Do you know somebody what?
My buddy was his back east in Boston.

202
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.620
You see fucking Wes Welker was a tough son of tough son of a bitch.

203
00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:25.621
Did you see him get fucking stock after he made that catch just a fucking great

204
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.700
old school rattle your fillings hit.

205
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.010
It was the shit one of those things where you sit at home,

206
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.170
you see the hit and you're like,
yeah,
right there.

207
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.990
Aside from obviously the speed of the game,

208
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.250
that hit right there is why I'm on the couch watching and not playing because if

209
00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:44.420
that ever happened to me,
I would have fucking,

210
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.580
if I didn't die instantly I would have been crying like a little girl and I

211
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:53.470
would have crawled off of my forearms and just laid in the fetal position for

212
00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:55.900
the rest of the fucking game as opposed to,
well,
group got up,

213
00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:00.520
was out for one play and came back and count in like another 15.
Yarder um,

214
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.870
just a great fucking hit some fucking sports guy in Boston.

215
00:13:04.871 --> 00:13:06.250
My buddy was telling me,
he said that the,

216
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:08.230
that the guys should be fine for that hit.

217
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.093
<v 0>I Dunno,</v>

218
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.300
<v 2>this is it.
You know what it is,
is the timeout generation is coming of age</v>

219
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.863
<v 0>and uh,</v>

220
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.960
<v 2>I don't recognize it,
but I got to tell you a fucking Seattle,</v>

221
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.590
their fans annoy the fuck out of me.
They really do.

222
00:13:25.591 --> 00:13:29.550
I'm so sick of them getting all this fucking credit for being this loud crowd.

223
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.180
The 12th man,
you know,
your 12th man should be,

224
00:13:33.181 --> 00:13:37.860
it's your 12th man every week should be the architect that built that stadium

225
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.700
because they knew you guys were just average fucking fans.

226
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:46.880
So they had to like design a symphony hall to enhance how loud your chairs are.

227
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.630
I went to that stadium.
You can't fucking believe how loud it is.

228
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.840
You're looking around going,
how is it this loud?

229
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.600
And I'm looking at the expressions on people's faces.

230
00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.830
They're not any more intense,
nothing.
It's that fucking overhang.

231
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:02.910
They built this symphony,

232
00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.960
the capture,
every fucking cheer that goes up there.

233
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:13.610
And now these guys are out there thinking they're like these bad ass fans with

234
00:14:13.611 --> 00:14:16.430
your ugly ass fucking uniforms.

235
00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.850
Ah,
and to make matters worse.
Yeah.

236
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.520
And every week they have some fucking B list celebrity go out there and I forget

237
00:14:26.521 --> 00:14:30.120
what he does.
He blows a trumpet or raises a flag.
It was so forgettable.

238
00:14:30.121 --> 00:14:33.720
I was actually at the ads to have have most of this is because I'm mad that my

239
00:14:33.721 --> 00:14:36.950
fucking team blue that Goddamn game.
No,
we didn't even blow.

240
00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.420
We fucking didn't even deserve it.
We didn't fucking deserve it.

241
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:44.040
It's just counting.
Am I not taken away from Seattle?
Seattle totally deserves it.

242
00:14:44.041 --> 00:14:47.430
The fucking defense is great and everything was awesome and I really liked,

243
00:14:47.431 --> 00:14:50.670
I love how fucking big and hard their uh,
their,

244
00:14:50.671 --> 00:14:52.970
their hit and everything was great.

245
00:14:52.971 --> 00:14:56.450
And then this morning I'm watching the NFL network and one of their corners is

246
00:14:56.451 --> 00:14:59.180
on there talking trash,
but he's like giddy.

247
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.620
It was like a,

248
00:15:01.621 --> 00:15:05.630
I had Douche chills going up the arm back down the arm and back up the,

249
00:15:05.631 --> 00:15:06.464
I mean it's just like

250
00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.620
<v 5>no
butch.</v>

251
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:24.490
<v 2>Ah,
it was like,
dude,
please stop talking.
You just one,</v>

252
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.520
just sit there like,
it was no big deal.

253
00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.360
Why are you trying to act like you're a Badass and you,
you sound giddy.

254
00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.800
You want a game and fucking October.
Absolutely get,

255
00:15:35.801 --> 00:15:40.030
he sounded like he shook.
Elvis has hand.
Ah,

256
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:42.290
<v 5>you can quote.
We put it on the unit</v>

257
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.080
<v 2>work.
Oh,
go wash your dreads.</v>

258
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:49.940
Nobody gives a fuck when one fee wouldn't.
One fucking game.

259
00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:56.010
You went one fucking game in October and you're fucking sitting there

260
00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.560
texting about it.

261
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:04.940
And then Tom Brady said this and then I said that Danny,

262
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.870
right some he said fucking,
she said Horse Shit.

263
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:14.840
Just be thankful that you have one more fucking victory than you really deserve

264
00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:19.250
because of those replacement refs.
Honestly,
Seattle,
honestly,

265
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.120
do you really think you're going to win the Superbowl this year?
You know,

266
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.590
even with your,
your,
your enhanced acoustics there.

267
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:33.650
You know who I'm actually,
you know,
it'd be interesting,
um,
who,
who,

268
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:38.120
who designed that stadium did Paul Simon,
did he have a word in that?

269
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.870
Did he sit there on the 50 yard line?
You know,

270
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.830
singing one of is going to San Francisco songs.

271
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:51.350
James Taylor,
maybe he said out there.
Okay.
James,

272
00:16:51.351 --> 00:16:54.320
let's just see if we've moved the roof in,
um,

273
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.200
far enough to capture every sound in this building.

274
00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.140
I've seen fire and I've seen rain.

275
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:06.100
I was saying Saturdays.
Oh my God.
Oh it,

276
00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.590
most of that.
Most of that was me.
I'm just pissed at my fucking team lost.

277
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.560
Uh,
why won't they let him play football anymore?
Everybody

278
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.260
is it because they're worried about a class action suit with all these fucking

279
00:17:21.261 --> 00:17:24.530
concussions just makes,
make them sign a waiver.

280
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:31.010
I understand that if I get my head slammed at 40 miles a fucking hour every

281
00:17:31.011 --> 00:17:32.540
three seconds playing this game,

282
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.350
that eventually there might be some sort of physical side effects.

283
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.610
I take on all these personal fucking,
uh,

284
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.560
risks myself and I agreed to go out there and play football the way it was meant

285
00:17:45.561 --> 00:17:50.310
to be played.
Oh.
Oh,
I got to tell you
right now,

286
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.640
the two biggest things ruining the game though.
I mean,

287
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:56.100
you do it to protect the players,
but the fucking Brady rule,

288
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.810
I'm actually sitting there watching Brady and he's bugging me every time he gets

289
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:04.680
somebody runs by him too fast,
he looks over at the ref.
It's just like,

290
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:11.010
you know,
I,
it's,
it's,
it's,
I'm going to stop,

291
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.830
um,
who,
I'm not going to stop watching.

292
00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.450
I'm just gonna keep bitching because I have nothing better to do on a fucking

293
00:18:15.451 --> 00:18:18.990
Sunday.
This is the truth of the matter,
but this fuck do back in the day,

294
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.710
defensive backs,
man,
they had attitude,
man.
They were up on their toes.

295
00:18:22.711 --> 00:18:24.810
He'll write up on the line that got in your face.

296
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.880
They could fucking intimidate you,
but like you can't even play defense.

297
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.660
It's like a chaperone on a fucking prom night.

298
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:38.610
I don't know.
But even if he could play defense,
I swear to God,

299
00:18:38.611 --> 00:18:42.330
I fucking corners are terrible.
Fucking terrible.

300
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.800
I know I don't get the fucking game,
but you know what?
I can't stand.

301
00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:49.750
I fucking hate zone defense.
Hey,

302
00:18:49.751 --> 00:18:53.400
when you're covering a guy and then you just let them go,
you let them go.

303
00:18:53.401 --> 00:18:54.031
And then that other guy,

304
00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:57.060
and then he has like eight yards before another guy's going to go pick them up

305
00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.460
and they lay sitting down in the zone,

306
00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:04.460
sitting down in the zone.
He's not even fucking covered.
All right,

307
00:19:04.461 --> 00:19:07.910
I got my fucking Tampon out.
Let's go.
Let's fucking plow ahead here.

308
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:10.343
<v 0>Ah,</v>

309
00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.860
<v 2>I'm going to go up there with a fucking hacksaw one day and I'm gonna cut off</v>

310
00:19:14.861 --> 00:19:18.150
the roof on both sides of those.
Oh,
that fucking stadium.
And uh,

311
00:19:18.151 --> 00:19:19.990
and you know what?
Seattle Seahawks fans,

312
00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:24.490
you're going to find in an embarrassing way how loud you truly are.
Okay?

313
00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.660
When an immediately sounds like a Peter Paul and Mary concert.
All right.

314
00:19:28.661 --> 00:19:31.930
Your granola bar or eaten Jack Ass is sitting there acting like you're tough

315
00:19:31.931 --> 00:19:33.250
guys up there.
What do you do?

316
00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.730
All your tough guys are out to sea getting the fucking crab legs.

317
00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.840
What do you guys do?
Huh?
Sit around and talk about the new world order.

318
00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:46.180
You know,
you such rabid fans,
you lost your basketball team.
Go fuck yourselves.

319
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.710
Um,
let's try neon green.

320
00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.140
Ah,
Jesus.
Hey,

321
00:19:56.141 --> 00:20:00.010
did you guys hear there's a new strand of gonorrhea out there is a nice segue.

322
00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.980
Airborne gonorrhea.

323
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:09.090
I really need an echo for that air board board board got herea Maria,
Maria,
Maria

324
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:14.950
airborne fucking gonorrhea.
Can you believe that shit?

325
00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:19.750
Just when you thought it was safe to take your dick out.

326
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:24.860
Right here comes airborne gonorrhea and we have evidently San Diego State

327
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.710
University to thank for it.
All right,

328
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.100
so there's a mysterious case of this kid,
right?

329
00:20:33.101 --> 00:20:36.250
He's never gotten laid in his life.
He's kissed a couple of girls,
but that's it.

330
00:20:36.251 --> 00:20:39.940
And somehow he ends up with fucking gonorrhea.
Um,

331
00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.490
so the doctors can't figure it out.
Let's pick it up here.

332
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:46.680
One question about any physical contact or possible mixing of fluids.

333
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.920
The dude responded,
well,
I did sort of brush up against this pretty girl's arm,

334
00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:54.130
but I don't think she noticed that this kid,
as far as they're explaining,

335
00:20:54.131 --> 00:20:59.131
is basically a virgin said after explaining his situation to the doctors at Uc

336
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.620
SDS,
student health clinic,
uh,
blah,
blah,
blah,

337
00:21:05.621 --> 00:21:07.930
research began examining the peculiar case.

338
00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:09.740
<v 3>Okay.</v>

339
00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:13.900
<v 2>Um,
this fucking egg head was the first guy to suspect the fucking thing.
Uh,</v>

340
00:21:13.901 --> 00:21:17.540
a new strand of the disease sometimes.
Well,
here's what he says.

341
00:21:17.541 --> 00:21:22.400
Sometimes when a bacterial disease is present in extremely high quantities

342
00:21:22.401 --> 00:21:24.920
within a relatively small location,

343
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.250
read San Diego State University campus,

344
00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:34.270
they can mutate and in some cases become airborne.

345
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.250
As it turns out,

346
00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:41.251
this was the case at San Diego State University and there's,

347
00:21:41.261 --> 00:21:44.350
virgin just happened to be the first victim.

348
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.190
That's how filthy these fucking kids are down there.

349
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.300
<v 3>Okay?</v>

350
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.480
<v 2>Jesus Christ.
They must be going to class barefoot.</v>

351
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:58.190
Bunch of fucking animals down there.
Um,
anyways.

352
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:00.540
<v 3>Okay.</v>

353
00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.920
<v 2>Some chick who accompanied the virgin to San Diego state said,
yeah,</v>

354
00:22:04.921 --> 00:22:09.240
it really sucks that the dude who drove us gut gonorrhea,

355
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.280
I mean he didn't even get any ass.

356
00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:18.660
This is a woman saying this and still now look at them.

357
00:22:18.661 --> 00:22:21.930
That really blows.
Wow.

358
00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:24.870
Well there you go.
So there you go.

359
00:22:24.871 --> 00:22:28.170
If anybody has a daughter and you're thinking about where not to send her,

360
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:33.840
I would not send her to San Diego State University.
Why?
Because of the,

361
00:22:33.841 --> 00:22:37.770
the curriculum is that he said the curriculum,
the,

362
00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:42.180
the safety issues on campus.
Know what?
Well,
well,

363
00:22:42.181 --> 00:22:43.290
what is the reason?

364
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:48.180
It's because of air board board board got our Maria Maria,
Maria,
Maria

365
00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.120
airborne gonorrhea.

366
00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.750
That is just fucking insane.

367
00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:02.510
San Diego state gives you wings that gives gonorrhea rings.

368
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.930
They're like the fucking red bull of STDs.

369
00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:11.720
That is fucking shame on you.
San Diego State University.

370
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.080
What are you guys doing down there?
I can tell you what you're not doing.

371
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:17.330
<v 3>Okay,</v>

372
00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:20.840
<v 2>good.
Fucking Lord.
Get it.
Do you know what?
They're going to invent a new condom.</v>

373
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.010
You know that just you,

374
00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:27.770
you're going to put it on like a fucking bathing suit and it's just going to

375
00:23:27.771 --> 00:23:32.000
cover everything.
It'll be like a,
a speedo condom,

376
00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:34.123
you know,
but it's,

377
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:37.610
but it's very flexible so you're still able to have some sort of sex.

378
00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.530
It's just always see this shit this over.
This is nature man.

379
00:23:42.531 --> 00:23:45.980
Nature knows there's just too many of us and she's

380
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.660
<v 1>just,
I don't know what she's doing.</v>

381
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.570
<v 3>Okay.</v>

382
00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.160
<v 1>She needs to step up our game though.</v>

383
00:23:51.161 --> 00:23:54.970
Cause if you think fucking airborne gonorrhea is going to stop us.

384
00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:56.680
<v 3>Okay,</v>

385
00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.970
<v 1>I got it.
I got,
I got news for you,
lady.
I don't,
I don't think it is.
You know,</v>

386
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.730
I realize I am 22 minutes in.

387
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:06.250
I always fucking do this and I forget to do the Goddamn ads.
By the way.

388
00:24:06.251 --> 00:24:10.030
Congratulations to sandy asch Seattle,
you know,
you know I'm fucking with you.

389
00:24:10.031 --> 00:24:12.070
I'm just fucking pissed that we lost.
All right.

390
00:24:12.071 --> 00:24:15.220
Before you send me all your fucking,
you know,

391
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:18.280
I did an episode of inside the NFL this week and at the end of the end of it,

392
00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.640
I'm standing there with Phil Sims and Chris Collins worth,

393
00:24:20.641 --> 00:24:25.630
who are two of the funniest dudes ever.
Such a great experience doing that show.

394
00:24:25.631 --> 00:24:29.080
So they have me picking games.
So I'm standing there with a guy,
you know,

395
00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.840
two guys who both played and super bowls.

396
00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:33.200
<v 3>Okay.</v>

397
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.000
<v 1>And I'm just some more on from the stance.</v>

398
00:24:35.001 --> 00:24:37.280
So I'm not really going to sit here and give my pics.

399
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:41.270
I'm just going to act like an idiot.
So I predicted the Patriots have win by 40.

400
00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.660
I said the Texans wouldn't win cause I didn't like their quarterback's face.

401
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.080
I was going to pick Tampa and then set out of,

402
00:24:47.081 --> 00:24:50.570
they got a pirate ship in this stadium.
You know,
they're not taking it seriously.

403
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:53.600
I just did stuff like that.
The amount of people who took it seriously,

404
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.640
like you thought they were going to win by 40 epic fail.
It's like,
do you,

405
00:24:58.641 --> 00:25:00.860
do you really think I thought they were going to win by 40.

406
00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:08.540
Unreal.
Unreal.
Um,
Jim Florentine,

407
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:10.610
my Paul Versey doing Jim Florentine.

408
00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:14.330
You got to listen to Paul versus these podcasts by the way.
Uh,
the,
uh,

409
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.880
I think it's the,
the effect.
I can't remember what the hell he calls it.

410
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:23.110
All I know is that Robinson can is o for 26 in his last 26 at bats.

411
00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:29.210
He just,
he just set a new play off record.

412
00:25:29.211 --> 00:25:31.940
Nobody in the history of the game has gone.
Oh,

413
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.640
Oh for 26.

414
00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.440
You know what his verse he save or was he just ah,
you know,

415
00:25:39.441 --> 00:25:43.040
he's just in a slump each.
I got to talk Yankee.
So here in a second.
Hold on.

416
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:47.510
Here we go.
Here we go.
Let's,
let's do some,
let's do some reads here man.

417
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:48.853
Um,

418
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:50.310
<v 3>okay.</v>

419
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:55.030
<v 1>All right.
What do I got here?
Uh,
all right.</v>

420
00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:00.040
Mortgage rates just hit an all time historic low 3.125% APR annual percentage

421
00:26:02.871 --> 00:26:05.060
rate.
For those of you at home keeping score,

422
00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:08.480
I'm sure you're looking for some extra cash for the holiday season or just want

423
00:26:08.481 --> 00:26:10.160
to take advantage of these rates.

424
00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:14.150
Lending tree can help you save hundreds a month.

425
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:17.570
Can I tell you something?
If you want to buy a house,

426
00:26:17.571 --> 00:26:21.620
3.125 is a great thing to do.
If you're so broke,

427
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.900
you need to take out a second mortgage to buy Christmas gifts.
Uh,

428
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:29.210
I don't think that's a good idea.
Extra cash for Christmas.
Why would you do that?

429
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.280
Oh,
this is probably the last week they advertise.
Um,

430
00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.920
don't do that.
Okay.

431
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.670
You're going to go buy a bunch of Christmas gifts and not have a roof over your

432
00:26:40.671 --> 00:26:44.280
head for God's sakes,
man.
Let's think this through anyways.
It's easy.

433
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.430
<v 2>It's free and you can feel confident in the lender you choose.</v>

434
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:52.230
Go to lending tree.com and complete one easy form that takes less than five

435
00:26:52.231 --> 00:26:55.770
minutes to do.
This is basically like,
you know when you're going into like,
uh,

436
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.970
maybe going to go down to San Diego and avoid San Diego State University campus

437
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:02.760
and you want to find a cheap hotel.
What does it like orbits?

438
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.240
This is like the orbits of,
of mortgages.
You just pump in,

439
00:27:06.241 --> 00:27:07.860
you know what you're looking for,

440
00:27:07.861 --> 00:27:10.950
all your information and they will scan all these different banks.

441
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.650
At your fingertips and you will get the lowest rate,

442
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.640
but please do not take out a second mortgage.
Or they're not saying that.

443
00:27:17.641 --> 00:27:22.260
They just saying,
if you just want some cash
for Christmas,

444
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:24.120
you know,

445
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.910
I think at that point you got to go chop down a tree and just make a wooden

446
00:27:26.911 --> 00:27:30.930
train for somebody and do the best you can.
That's what I would do.

447
00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:37.200
Um,
a couple of IOU slips.
All right,
plowing ahead.
Uh,
Bill,
uh,

448
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.830
anyways,
you will be able to compare offers from up to four lenders in a few.

449
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:45.270
Enter the code bur bur are,
you will receive a free mortgage guide,

450
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:51.270
um,
and then you go 3.1,
two five percentage rate.
That's,

451
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:54.960
that's unbelief.
I have a nice percentage rate in my house.
All right?

452
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.720
I thought I had a good and all of a sudden look at these guys.

453
00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.720
It's even lower and I know what you're thinking.
Well,

454
00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:04.120
why don't you refinance bill?
I'll tell you why.
Because after all the rigmarole,

455
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.830
it's gonna end up costing me more money.
So I'm locked into my rate.
All right?

456
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.070
If you want to get locked into a better rate right now,
now's the time.

457
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.080
Get Yourself,
you know what's great about a house?

458
00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.350
If you just pay that thing down,
you know when the apocalypse comes,

459
00:28:16.351 --> 00:28:17.220
you on your thing,

460
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.060
you own your little hut is everybody else is getting thrown out by the bankers

461
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.330
aren't Har Har coming down the street like the penguin and the old Batman
movies.

462
00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:27.330
Um,
he knows getting hope.

463
00:28:27.331 --> 00:28:30.570
If you're going to pay for 30 years to have the one of the low,

464
00:28:30.571 --> 00:28:33.690
the all time historic low interest rate.
There you go.
All right though.
We got it.

465
00:28:33.691 --> 00:28:37.320
We got it.
Um,
and then of course the classic stamps.com.

466
00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:41.370
Do you like going to the post office really?
Well,
what's wrong with you?

467
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.440
Wouldn't it be great if you didn't have to go to the post office?

468
00:28:43.441 --> 00:28:45.870
Because you could do everything that you could do at the post office,

Alright,
back to the podcast.

489
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:10.010
And once again,
congratulations to the Seattle Seahawks.
I really don't help,

490
00:30:10.011 --> 00:30:14.590
but you don't win a super bowl.
All right.
Before you get all fucking upset.

491
00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:19.560
<v 5>Actually,
we are that loud.
Back when we,
when we hit the,
uh,</v>

492
00:30:19.561 --> 00:30:22.860
the King Joe Webb and people pay me their heads,
man.

493
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:27.750
<v 2>Um,
we,
we're shotgunning granola bars,</v>

494
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.110
<v 5>man,
the new world on her.</v>

495
00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:34.770
<v 2>Um,
actually I love,
I love Seattle.</v>

496
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:36.830
It's a fucking beautiful city.
You know what I mean?

497
00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:42.020
And it's worth sitting there and talking to those broads with the hairy bushes.

498
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:46.490
Um,
the fucking New York Yankees.
I got to tell you,

499
00:30:46.491 --> 00:30:51.190
I was just in New York City,
New York,
New York,
and um,

500
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:57.050
I got to tell you something,
Joe Gerardi sitting a Rod,

501
00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:02.980
our pinch hitting him in the ninth inning when they're down sitting a $200

502
00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:05.800
million man.

503
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:10.800
Mike is arguably the ballsiest gutsiest move I've ever seen by not only a

504
00:31:12.141 --> 00:31:15.230
baseball manager.
I'm trying to think of a gutsy or call.

505
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:19.790
I know saints fans.
Oh,
what about when we did the onside kick?
Not even close,

506
00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:25.370
not even close.
That's just some,
uh,
razzle dazzle.

507
00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:29.030
You just yet.
That's your file.
That under that shit,
this,

508
00:31:29.031 --> 00:31:32.270
this was an unbelievable mood.
It was such an unreal move from,

509
00:31:32.271 --> 00:31:35.750
for those who didn't watch,
and we're under a rock.
The Guy,

510
00:31:35.751 --> 00:31:40.100
a rowel of Bonnie's who looks like,
I don't know what he looks like.

511
00:31:40.101 --> 00:31:44.240
He looks like
an older Freddy Krueger.

512
00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.440
He's an old guy,
but at that way,
I'm four years older than him,

513
00:31:48.441 --> 00:31:52.460
so I look even worse.
Guy Hits a home run.
It was like a movie.

514
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.960
It's like Robert Redford and the natural goes into extra innings.

515
00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:01.280
They went in on a walk off home,
run by whole.
None other than Raul Oban,
Jez.

516
00:32:01.281 --> 00:32:05.660
Again,
it was,
I just was unreal and I absolutely hate the Yankees.

517
00:32:05.661 --> 00:32:07.460
And the next day I'm reading the New York Post,

518
00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:12.670
reading about this historic move and I'm smiling reading about a Yankee when

519
00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:16.930
unbelievable.
I actually got into the baseball playoffs a little bit because,
uh,

520
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:19.750
I kept doing spots.
Um,

521
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:24.850
all that whole week I was getting ready to do night of too many stars on comedy

522
00:32:24.981 --> 00:32:25.461
central,

523
00:32:25.461 --> 00:32:30.461
which I taped a Saturday night and will air I believe within the week,

524
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.330
raises money for autism.
And uh,

525
00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.020
I kept making fun of that name night of too many stars is too many stars.

526
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.190
Then I showed up and saw

527
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:45.150
<v 1>who was there and that was pretty impressive.
I'm not going to ruin it,
but,
uh,</v>

528
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:50.090
I was definitely,
my head was on a swivel,
so half of my childhood walked by.

529
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.240
Um,
anyways,
yeah.

530
00:32:53.241 --> 00:32:57.350
So I would go out and I would run my set and um,

531
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.570
and then I would,
I would at the end of the night,
I'd go to this bar by myself.

532
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:08.390
I get a whiskey and I would just sit there and I would want what would watch the

533
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:12.110
end of the Games.
And,
uh,
what did I watch?
I watch all my God,

534
00:33:12.111 --> 00:33:16.820
I watched the fucking,
it's going to say the senators,
the fucking a nationals.

535
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:24.140
I watched it nationals.
Oh my God,
that fucking collect that debacle.

536
00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.860
That was brutal.
That was like the old school red socks.

537
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:31.310
That was the way the red sox used to loose.
That was brutal.

538
00:33:31.311 --> 00:33:33.470
So my condolences to national fans.

539
00:33:33.471 --> 00:33:36.140
I sat there watching it and not really giving a shit about the series,

540
00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:38.660
but I was like,
oh they've never want to play.
Want to play off series.

541
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:43.100
Been Baseball since the 1930s I got to watch this cause these fans are going to

542
00:33:43.101 --> 00:33:45.410
go crazy.
Go crazy folks.

543
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.300
They're going to go nuts and just watching that,
just watching it go away.

544
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:56.570
What the hell are they?
What are they down by?
Four runs now.

545
00:33:56.571 --> 00:34:00.230
What was it?
No,
they scored four runs.
It was seven to five

546
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:06.760
they one strike away and next thing you know it's nine to seven cardinals.

547
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.750
Oh,
it was brutal.
It was brutal.

548
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.820
I thought too horrific things that in watching Derek Jeter break his ankle and

549
00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:18.980
have to get carried off the field,
that was just,

550
00:34:18.981 --> 00:34:20.930
that was not something that I wanted to see.

551
00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:25.970
Had I known that that was going to happen,
I wouldn't have watched,
you know,

552
00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:29.420
you know,
I see Derek Jeter carried off the field.
It was,
it was brutal.

553
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:35.090
Fucking brutal.
So anyways,
hats off to a Joe Gerardi man,
that was an awesome,

554
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:41.120
oh,
what a gutsy call to have to walk up to him and be like,
yeah,
listen,

555
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:46.160
I'm about ready to humiliate you in front of the country for the better of this

556
00:34:46.161 --> 00:34:50.330
team.
And uh,
if this doesn't work out,

557
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:55.930
you know,
with the way the New York media is,
they might actually question,
uh,

558
00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.400
uh,
they're going to question whatever the fuck I do.

559
00:34:58.401 --> 00:35:02.420
And he still had the nerve to do it.
Unreal.
Unreal.

560
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:04.790
Um,
anyways,
here we go.
Hey Bill.

561
00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:08.990
I'm a huge fan and I just wanted to let you know that recently my mother has

562
00:35:08.991 --> 00:35:13.140
been battling cancer while she's in the hospital recovering from surgery.

563
00:35:13.141 --> 00:35:15.620
And my dad brother and I sat down and watched your special,

564
00:35:15.621 --> 00:35:17.990
even though it might have been an hour of the day,

565
00:35:17.991 --> 00:35:21.590
you made us laugh at a time when we all really needed a low.
Why are we why we,

566
00:35:21.591 --> 00:35:24.440
this is like really nice.
We don't do nice things in the podcast.

567
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:29.690
I truly believe Blah,
blah,
blah.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Okay,

568
00:35:29.691 --> 00:35:33.920
well I'm glad I was able to do that.
I'm glad my total ego trip.

569
00:35:33.921 --> 00:35:34.790
Look at me.

570
00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:39.270
Selfish thing that I do somehow added to your life and I'm sorry to hear about

571
00:35:39.271 --> 00:35:42.930
your mom.
I hope she gets better.
All right now.
Now,
now we're in this place.

572
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:47.790
Now we're in this place.
This happened to me on that night of too many stars.

573
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.170
I'm not going to say what happened,

574
00:35:49.171 --> 00:35:52.860
but I had to go on after something that really should have just ended the show

575
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:57.780
because it was unreal.
It was unreal and I was literally standing there going,

576
00:35:57.781 --> 00:36:02.040
I have to go on after this.
Why,
why?
You know,
gcs,

577
00:36:02.041 --> 00:36:05.100
but the host took me up,
host,
got him back,

578
00:36:05.101 --> 00:36:09.630
got him back to have more sillier place.
Um,
anyways,
the house,

579
00:36:09.631 --> 00:36:13.950
John Stewart,
um,
solid guy,
stand up,

580
00:36:13.951 --> 00:36:18.480
comedian saw the situation.
All right.
Took the bullet for me.

581
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:23.250
Brought me out.
Nice solid guy.
All right.
Facebook comments.
Bill,

582
00:36:23.251 --> 00:36:25.800
how does someone who can hardly read write a book?

583
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:34.590
You know how I can do that,
sir?
Um,
I didn't write a book.

584
00:36:34.591 --> 00:36:37.770
I wrote it with two of my friends.
We all held each other.
You know,

585
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.630
they brought me across the finish line,

586
00:36:39.631 --> 00:36:43.150
like Kellen Winslow in that game against the dolphins.
Um,

587
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.520
that's actually not true.

588
00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:49.860
Me and Bobby carried Joe to Rosa across the finish line.
And you know,

589
00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:53.520
not because Joe's not a piece of shit.
Joe Joe is just such a commitment.

590
00:36:53.521 --> 00:36:55.520
Phobe he's never really interrelationship,

591
00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:00.390
so he didn't have that many cheating stories.
Um,
but anyways,

592
00:37:00.391 --> 00:37:02.490
I want to thank everybody who's going out and buying the book.

593
00:37:02.491 --> 00:37:07.110
The book has been doing phenomenally phenomenon.
Pop Baba Baba on,

594
00:37:07.111 --> 00:37:10.350
um,
whatever the hell is the book charts.

595
00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:15.300
So if you haven't got your,
your copy of cheat a man's guide to infidelity,

596
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:18.090
absolutely hilarious over the top look,

597
00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:23.190
add a men's behavior in the dumb things that we do.

598
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:27.510
Um,
we got a bunch of our knucklehead friends telling stories about cheating on

599
00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:30.780
women and getting caught.
And then the three of us,
me,

600
00:37:30.781 --> 00:37:35.250
Joe and Bobby basically breakdown their cheat stories like NFL game film and try

601
00:37:35.251 --> 00:37:38.850
to say where they went wrong,
where they went right.
And in the back of the book,

602
00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.880
the true reason we wrote the book was to hype our short film that we got into

603
00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:45.960
the Tribeca film festival called cheat.
Um,

604
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:49.710
you get a link to the movie and you can check it out and it's awesome.

605
00:37:49.711 --> 00:37:54.711
So thank you for everybody and also my special you people are all the same as is

still available for download at [inaudible] dot com and if you're having

607
00:37:58.801 --> 00:38:00.270
problems downloading it,

608
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:04.980
you have totally my empathy because I would screw it up too because I am also

609
00:38:04.981 --> 00:38:07.590
not good at the computer,
the art of computers.

610
00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.610
Just make sure when you just in this,
if you have a problem,

611
00:38:11.611 --> 00:38:14.010
all you need to do is in capital letters in the subject line.

612
00:38:14.011 --> 00:38:17.820
This will help me find your email quickly and get you this special as quickly as

613
00:38:17.821 --> 00:38:22.650
possible.
Just write standup special.

614
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:27.030
just have your paypal receipt copied and we'll get it right out to you.

615
00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:31.380
Okay.
Because if you just say,
hey,
I bought it.
I couldn't download it.

616
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:34.620
I have to do the extra thing of going.
Okay,
send me the receipt,

617
00:38:34.621 --> 00:38:36.940
we'll get it to you.
It's an extra step.
All right.

618
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:41.830
We're trying to expedite the process of you getting the special.
All right.

619
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.760
Speaking of special led Zepplin special,
Mr Burb,

620
00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:50.380
tell me you're excited about the new led Zepplin film about their 2007 benefit

621
00:38:50.381 --> 00:38:52.520
concert.
Um,
Jim Florentine,

622
00:38:52.521 --> 00:38:56.160
he talked about it as most recent podcasts and mentioned how bonds those sons

623
00:38:56.161 --> 00:39:00.250
stole the show.
Yeah.
Jason,
I actually talked to Florentine,
we'll text about it.

624
00:39:00.251 --> 00:39:03.760
He said was the best concert film he's ever seen.
Um,

625
00:39:03.761 --> 00:39:06.310
and I also heard that the members of the band were,
were,

626
00:39:06.311 --> 00:39:11.050
were ridiculously excited after they saw it.
Um,
so he goes,

627
00:39:11.051 --> 00:39:14.680
so I thought that this might be the best dilemma question for you.

628
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:18.610
If you could see only one last concert,

629
00:39:18.611 --> 00:39:23.480
would you choose ACDC and Argentina or led Zeppelin with bonds?
Oh,

630
00:39:23.481 --> 00:39:28.270
son.
Ah,
Oh,
I,

631
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:29.740
uh,
that's,
that's actually an easy one.

632
00:39:29.741 --> 00:39:31.600
I would have to say lead's up on with Bonzo son,

633
00:39:31.601 --> 00:39:35.380
just for the simple fact that I've seen ACDC a bunch of times and I've never

634
00:39:35.381 --> 00:39:38.560
seen led Zeppelin and,
um,

635
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.170
as much as I would love to see ACDC and Argentina,
yeah,
I would,

636
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:48.040
I would go see separately.
You know what I mean?
Cause I,
I,
I saw some clips of it.

637
00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.550
What I liked about how Jason played was,

638
00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:57.280
you could just tell that he wasn't intimidated by the moment.
You know,

639
00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:01.480
that poor guy,
he basically,
he had to follow the greatest drummer of all time.

640
00:40:01.481 --> 00:40:04.780
His Dad,
it'd be like if you were Jordan's son and you play in Hoop,

641
00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.900
even if you dunk on somebody,
somebody to go,
yeah,
but your Dad,

642
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:12.100
your dad would've jumped higher.
He said to deal with that his entire life.

643
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.380
And I just felt the way he was playing,

644
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.620
he didn't give a shit what anybody was going to say.

645
00:40:17.621 --> 00:40:21.970
And he did this great blend of um,

646
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:27.150
stuff that his dad played on the classic recordings and stuff that I've heard on

647
00:40:28.001 --> 00:40:29.320
the Zeppelin bootlegs.

648
00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:34.650
He kind of blended those perfectly while also just being in the moment himself.

649
00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:40.580
I felt like in thrown in some shit that his interpretations and he,
it was,

650
00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:43.150
it was perfect.
He did the perfect balance of,

651
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:48.750
of staying true to the original and then adding his own flavor to it without

652
00:40:50.111 --> 00:40:54.400
getting in the way.
It was an absolute masterpiece.
So,
um,
there you go.

653
00:40:54.401 --> 00:40:55.990
Look at that.
After coming out heart,

654
00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.310
coming out hard and trash and pink shirts and everybody in Seattle,

655
00:41:00.311 --> 00:41:03.950
look at him coming around here,
given uh,

656
00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:08.770
given fucking props to the Yankees and shit.
Jesus Christ Almighty.

657
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:13.630
Anyways,
barrel bill,
La Beer,
all beer.
Um,

658
00:41:13.631 --> 00:41:18.400
fear of STDs and downgrading.
Um,
what's going on,

659
00:41:18.401 --> 00:41:22.570
Bill?
Love the podcast and all the advice you have.
Gail.
You know,
fuck this.

660
00:41:22.571 --> 00:41:23.440
I'm not going to read this right now.

661
00:41:23.441 --> 00:41:27.070
Let's talk about how the F I have to get on a fucking airplane today to fly to

662
00:41:27.071 --> 00:41:31.210
Australia.
All right?
Which is definitely exciting,

663
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.010
exciting new.

664
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:39.270
<v 2>Get on board.
What are you going,
Ooh,</v>

665
00:41:39.271 --> 00:41:44.271
your fucking trapped here for fucking 14 goddamn hours.

666
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:46.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

667
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.230
<v 2>You have two options.</v>

668
00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:53.260
Sit there and take it or do permanent damage to your liver by taking some sleep

669
00:41:53.451 --> 00:41:56.000
aids.
Yeah.
I don't know what I'm going to do.

670
00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:00.650
I'm not into those fucking ambiens and all those types of things because I do

671
00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:04.850
enough damage to my liver with fucking whiskey and all that type of shit I don't

672
00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:08.480
need,
I don't need to be adding to it.
You know what I mean?
You know,

673
00:42:08.481 --> 00:42:11.030
like when the ref gets knocked down in a wrestling match.

674
00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.910
And then in the hero guy with the blonde,

675
00:42:13.911 --> 00:42:16.040
blonde fucking mullet is over in the bad guys

676
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:16.993
<v 1>corner.</v>

677
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.970
<v 2>And the guy who's not supposed to be in has got his foot on his fucking throws.</v>

678
00:42:20.971 --> 00:42:23.370
The other guy kicks him in the head,
allegedly.
Yeah.

679
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:24.270
I don't want to be doing that.

680
00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:29.350
<v 1>I fucking liver.
So actually tweeted this out.
These are,</v>

681
00:42:29.351 --> 00:42:32.650
these are basically my options for 14 hour flight.

682
00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:37.720
14 fucking hours.
14 fucking out.
What do we,

683
00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:42.130
what are we going by ship here?
Huh?
What,
what are we doing here?
Um,

684
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:45.430
all right,
first option,

685
00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:50.490
I watch all three godfather's plus Goodfellas and then I try and sleep for six

686
00:42:50.681 --> 00:42:55.330
hours.
That'll be 14 hours or
I,

687
00:42:55.331 --> 00:43:00.280
uh,
take a fistful of Ambien and I watch raising Arizona

688
00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.180
and then I'm there.
But I,

689
00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:08.230
I've done this flight before and I did it out of New York City and I flew with

690
00:43:08.231 --> 00:43:13.231
this lady and she took some of those drugs and I kept looking over jealous is

691
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.630
she just slept hour after hour after hour.

692
00:43:16.631 --> 00:43:20.980
And I was sitting there fucking playing tetris for like fuck it,
eight hours.
Um,

693
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:26.020
um,
what,
but at the end of the flight when,

694
00:43:26.021 --> 00:43:28.140
when she went to get off,
I swear to God,

695
00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.250
she looked like she got the shit kicked out of her,

696
00:43:30.251 --> 00:43:33.850
but for some reason her face had,
didn't have the bruises,
but it was all puffy.

697
00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:37.930
She looked horrible.
And uh,
I don't want to do that shit,

698
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.040
so I think I'm going to go with the fucking,
yeah.

699
00:43:42.041 --> 00:43:46.270
But my laptop's going to run out of battery life.
Debbie,

700
00:43:46.271 --> 00:43:50.830
tell you guys how I don't like that movie casino.
It's just too fucking violent.

701
00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:55.240
It's just too fucking violent.
I love all the other stuff in it.

702
00:43:55.241 --> 00:43:58.680
But that shit with a guy's eye gets popped out or where they make,

703
00:43:58.681 --> 00:44:02.170
and Peshy watched them beat his brother to death with the bat and they're like

704
00:44:02.171 --> 00:44:06.640
burying him while he's still fucking half conscious.
It's just,
it just,

705
00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.520
it's just too much.
Just fucking rub me the wrong way.

706
00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:14.980
Those fake deaths I couldn't handle.
Um,

707
00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:20.980
fuck.
So what am I going to do?
I'm taking the lovely kneel with me.
Of course.

708
00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:23.650
Of course she wants to go.
She never goes when I need her.
Like what?

709
00:44:23.651 --> 00:44:27.930
I'm going to fucking,
you know,
some God forsaken place.
You know,

710
00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.640
if I'm going some place fun.
Oh,
she's right there on my hip.

711
00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:33.900
You not ladies do that.
Oh,
I want to go.

712
00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.770
Sounds like fun.
Oh yeah.

713
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:42.530
How come Jacksonville doesn't sound like fun.
What about Cincinnati?

714
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:44.250
Don't think you need to have some fun there.

715
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:47.490
That's the great thing about this trip is I had fun and all those places.

716
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:52.250
I had an unbelievably great time in Jacksonville.
Shoot.

717
00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:56.890
And Eaton gator going to the game and then I went up to fucking Cincinnati and I

718
00:44:56.891 --> 00:45:01.890
hate their fucking ribs.
I took a river boat over to the game.

719
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:08.250
I had a great,
I had a great time.
I really did.
Um,
oh,

720
00:45:08.251 --> 00:45:09.750
and speaking of a great time,

721
00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:13.800
and this is totally just free advertisement.

722
00:45:13.801 --> 00:45:16.500
There's a new standup comedy club in New York City.

723
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:22.070
There's a new girl in town and she's feeling good.

724
00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:27.690
Um,
Jesus Christ.
What was that?
That was,
there was Alice.

725
00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:33.750
I didn't always knew that there's a new girl in town.
And she's feeling good.

726
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:39.180
Got a divorce and a big tooth kid and we're going to Arizona

727
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:45.780
because I'm going to 10 up my mill titties.
I forget how it goes.

728
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:49.800
Anyways,
that dude was a cute kid.

729
00:45:49.801 --> 00:45:52.470
And then once he fucking,
he once he grew up,
wow.

730
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.150
He went through his fucking awkward years.

731
00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:58.380
All of a sudden he had giant fucking teeth and I didn't look so good.

732
00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:03.750
Tommy.
Tommy was his name.
Um,

733
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:07.800
the fuck am I talking about?
Why did I just start singing?
Oh,
a new standup club.

734
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.170
The guys who run the club right now,

735
00:46:10.171 --> 00:46:12.050
we're fucking sitting on the edge of their seats.
Go in,

736
00:46:12.051 --> 00:46:15.990
there's this fucking ADT add douche bag actually going to get to it.

737
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:20.640
And yes I am.
And there's a new new new comedy club.

738
00:46:20.641 --> 00:46:21.720
It's called the stand.

739
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:27.340
It's on third avenue between 19th and 20th Street and um,

740
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:31.260
has unbelievable food and there's a great comedy room downstairs.

741
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.900
And I hung out there all fucking weekend,

742
00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:38.700
all week building up for the night of too many stars and a,

743
00:46:38.701 --> 00:46:41.940
I had an awesome time and that's definitely going to be a regular stop for me

744
00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:45.650
when I come back to New York and it's fucking great.

745
00:46:45.651 --> 00:46:50.340
It's great place to take a broad,
they got good food,
great comedy downstairs.

746
00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:55.680
And um,
yeah,
it's kind of the same setup as the,

747
00:46:55.681 --> 00:47:00.360
uh,
the comedy cellar,
you know,
restaurant upstairs,

748
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:04.050
comedy room downstairs,
you know,

749
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:08.220
to like a smaller version of that.
So we either are,
there you go.

750
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:11.580
The comedy cellar,
the classic,
the film,

751
00:47:11.581 --> 00:47:15.480
more of standup comedy clubs in New York City.

752
00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.930
And now there's another new one that Stan,
you know,

753
00:47:18.931 --> 00:47:21.870
I actually went around and I did all the old ones.
Man,

754
00:47:21.871 --> 00:47:25.620
I had a great time going back there.
I did,
uh,
did a spot at danger fields,

755
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.530
did a couple of spots at the comic strip.

756
00:47:28.531 --> 00:47:33.531
I went over to a standup New York and went down to the Salah.

757
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:37.390
It was great.
It was fucking great time.

758
00:47:37.391 --> 00:47:41.920
And then I really actually missed being able to do like four spots in a night

759
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:48.580
working on stuff.
Um,
that was a great time when my life,

760
00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:52.930
way back in the day,
late nineties,
early two thousands when I was,

761
00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:57.790
when I was living with fucking Bobby Kelly and we would go out and do like eight

762
00:47:57.791 --> 00:48:00.550
shows on a Friday,
eight shows on Saturday.

763
00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:06.250
Fucking end of the night sitting there,
y'all sweaty with fucking 50 bucks,

764
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:09.610
50 bucks a spot,
whether that'd be 400 bucks.

765
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.420
I've told these stories and I always had to take cabs cause I played downtown

766
00:48:13.421 --> 00:48:17.080
and uptown and Bobby played,
he played the Boston,
the won the seller.

767
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.670
And some nights he do three of each and he'd have nine and he didn't have to

768
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:24.190
take one fucking cab and he had all his money and I'd be jealous.

769
00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:26.313
Anyways,

770
00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:31.440
fear of STDs and downgrading what's going on.
Bill.
Uh,

771
00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:34.900
I love the podcast and all the advice you've given no matter how a name.

772
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:38.620
So I thought I'd asked for some advice for myself.
Uh,

773
00:48:38.621 --> 00:48:40.600
for the last year and a half,

774
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:44.780
<v 2>I've been tormented by my ex girlfriend.
She dumped me and did the whole,</v>

775
00:48:44.781 --> 00:48:49.040
I want you back thing on and off for a year and a half.
Oh my God,
Dude.

776
00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:54.310
<v 1>Which is longer than that.
We were together in parentheses only a year.</v>

777
00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:55.860
<v 2>I don't want to be with,</v>

778
00:48:56.190 --> 00:49:00.660
I don't want to be with her because I now know how much of a cunt she is.

779
00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:04.650
But the problem is that I've been lured into this shit for that period of time.

780
00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:08.570
<v 1>You've learned to watch shit back into relationship</v>

781
00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:13.700
<v 2>is he says,
even though during that time we were not together,</v>

782
00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:18.880
I didn't sleep with or do anything with any other girl to make me look like the

783
00:49:19.341 --> 00:49:21.020
bigger person in the situation.

784
00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.410
She had a boyfriend during this time because again,
she's a [inaudible]

785
00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:28.200
<v 1>cunt.
Um,
well dude,
you're a PSAP.</v>

786
00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:30.143
All right.

787
00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:35.240
<v 2>You get it.
If you're just going to say she's a commentary like you're,
you're,</v>

788
00:49:35.241 --> 00:49:38.390
you're turning the keys over to the right of the whole fucking relationship to

789
00:49:38.391 --> 00:49:42.530
her.
That the reason why this isn't working is because she's a con.
She,

790
00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:47.120
she is a current and you're allowing her cunt and missed to fucking come into

791
00:49:47.121 --> 00:49:51.620
your atmosphere.
Sorry,
I ran out of shit there.
Um,

792
00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:55.700
yeah.
She's like airborne gonorrhea.
Get away from her.

793
00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:59.960
All right.
Get away from her.
Anyways,
he goes,

794
00:49:59.961 --> 00:50:02.540
so I haven't had sex in over a year and a half,

795
00:50:02.541 --> 00:50:06.440
which is slowly killing me on the inside.
Do what the fuck is wrong with you?

796
00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:08.030
Don't you have any friends?

797
00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:13.260
<v 1>Have you told your guy friends that
Ah,</v>

798
00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:15.140
come on man,
you're better than this.

799
00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:18.010
<v 2>He says in the prospects aren't looking too good.</v>

800
00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:22.750
Not many attractive ladies at my school and the ones who are attractive.

801
00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:25.780
I probably rather date since I'm more of a relation and

802
00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:26.633
<v 1>ship guy.</v>

803
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.150
<v 2>Um,
I've never had a one night stand before and would not know how to handle a</v>

804
00:50:32.151 --> 00:50:37.151
situation just approaching girl and getting her to have sex with me within a

805
00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:40.010
couple of hours.
It's not like I don't want to have random sex,

806
00:50:40.011 --> 00:50:43.450
but I am warry of STDs and didn't want to,

807
00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:46.940
don't want to just bang some ugly,
not too attractive.
Broad.

808
00:50:46.941 --> 00:50:51.590
Since my ex was extremely attractive,
I do not want to downgrade in any sense.

809
00:50:51.591 --> 00:50:55.970
Well,
you don't,
you don't have to bang some pig,
dude.

810
00:50:55.971 --> 00:50:58.700
You just need to go out.
This is what you need to do.
You need to go out.

811
00:50:58.701 --> 00:51:01.160
First thing you need to do is go down to the thrift shop and get yourself a

812
00:51:01.161 --> 00:51:04.750
fucking smoking jacket and some slippers.
All right?

813
00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:08.060
And just start fucking walking around and just feeling that vibe.

814
00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:15.010
<v 1>You have to stop giving a fuck.
All right?
Get yourself a bunch of condoms.</v>

815
00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:16.443
You know,

816
00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:19.140
<v 2>that's a great thing to do.
Get yourself a bunch of condoms,</v>

817
00:51:19.141 --> 00:51:22.230
like you're preparing for something wonderful to happen and then just get out

818
00:51:22.231 --> 00:51:24.600
there in the game.
Don't care if we don't go out there,
go like,

819
00:51:24.601 --> 00:51:27.060
I have to convince this girl to have sex with me tonight.

820
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:31.250
<v 1>You know,
that's you.
You're going to come off desperate.</v>

821
00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:36.440
<v 2>Just go out there and just fucking have a good time.
I'm telling you right?</v>

822
00:51:36.441 --> 00:51:37.390
And it's like doing stand.

823
00:51:37.391 --> 00:51:40.750
Half of doing standup is if you're up there having the fucking time in your
life,

824
00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:44.590
the crowd's going to go along with you.
They like it,
they see you having fun.

825
00:51:44.591 --> 00:51:46.830
It's contagious.
They want to be around you.
You just go out,

826
00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:51.760
have a good time at a fucking party,
crack some jokes.
Say what's up,
be friendly.

827
00:51:51.761 --> 00:51:55.030
Don't freak them out.
Then eventually he's all,
what's your deal?

828
00:51:55.031 --> 00:51:58.330
What's going on with you?
And they did a little touch on your arm right there.

829
00:51:58.331 --> 00:51:59.740
You're at least rounded second,

830
00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:04.180
<v 1>you know,
let's do it.
Baby</v>

831
00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:08.830
<v 2>steps hit a double first before you worry about fucking hitting the cycle.
Um,</v>

832
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:11.850
that would be my advice to you,
even though I haven't read the rest,

833
00:52:11.851 --> 00:52:14.670
so I don't even know what you're fucking question is.
So let's,
let's plow ahead.

834
00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:18.840
Although now I've also brought up airborne born Ghana,
Rio,
Rio,
Rio,

835
00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:22.650
get a gas mask and some condoms and I think you ought to be good.

836
00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:25.300
That's going to be sexier in the next couple of years.

837
00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:33.870
<v 0>Zach,
right back.
Hi.
Hi.</v>

838
00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:38.970
Yeah,
it's like my dad.
My Dad.
Yes.
Dan is a

839
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:41.970
fucking idiot.

840
00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:44.633
<v 1>Okay.</v>

841
00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:50.500
<v 0>Oh,
has it?
Oh,
how are you going to fuck a labor?
You got</v>

842
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:53.420
your fucking

843
00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.843
pitch

844
00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:04.780
<v 1>that's going to be sex in a couple of a couple of years.</v>

845
00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:10.830
<v 2>Is that going to be a campaign issue in the next few years?</v>

846
00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:13.170
That'll be tough for on healthcare.

847
00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:17.700
We're going to get schooled deck and we're going to tackle the problem head on

848
00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:22.500
of airborne gonorrhea.
Um,
let's go,
let's get to this fucking question here.

849
00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:22.840
Uh,

850
00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:26.820
I'm also on a college budget and definitely do want to spend extra money I have

851
00:53:26.821 --> 00:53:30.540
on taking some girl out to dinner or some shit.
Well then go fuck yourself dude.

852
00:53:30.541 --> 00:53:34.560
Have Fun jerking off.
You know what?
There's your opening line.
Yeah.
Listen,

853
00:53:34.561 --> 00:53:37.710
I want to fuck you tonight,
but like,
I don't want to waste any money so,
well,

854
00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:42.420
what do you,
what he say?
I'll take it out myself.
You know,
you know,
don't worry,

855
00:53:42.421 --> 00:53:46.400
unless you want to burn some calories,
take it out,
mark.
Um,

856
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:49.800
so I am wondering if I should stop spending so much time thinking about getting

857
00:53:49.801 --> 00:53:54.540
laid and just focusing on my focus on myself until I graduate and let whatever

858
00:53:54.541 --> 00:53:56.520
happens happens.
Yeah,
that's great.

859
00:53:56.521 --> 00:54:00.240
Should I just take my hand off the wheel and see where the car goes or should I

860
00:54:00.241 --> 00:54:04.830
just say fuck it and try to fuck the next girl who gives me attention?
No,

861
00:54:04.831 --> 00:54:08.430
don't do that.
All right.
You're a relationship guy.

862
00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:11.610
You don't want to go down that fucking road.
Okay.
But also,
you know,

863
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:13.710
even though you are a relationship guy,

864
00:54:13.711 --> 00:54:16.830
if you're the next one you meet is the one and you get married,

865
00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:18.300
you're going to be,
it's going to bug you.

866
00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:23.010
But you didn't go out and Bang at least fucking 20,
30 girls.
So I would,

868
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:32.940

871
00:54:42.601 --> 00:54:45.630
I know they're all the fucking rage,

872
00:54:45.631 --> 00:54:49.500
that says something about you forget a tattoo.
I don't give a fuck.
All right.

873
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:54.420
You're definitely on the other side of the skank fence.
All right.

874
00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:59.580
Um,
the way a girl dresses,
you want a girl who dresses classy?

875
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:04.740
All right.

She dresses like a whore.
Okay.

876
00:55:04.741 --> 00:55:09.060
A sports car looks like a sports car and it has been driven like one.
Okay.

877
00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:12.780
You go get a girl who's dressed like a fucking whore.

878
00:55:12.781 --> 00:55:16.160

look,
you know those classic girls can be a lot of fun too.
They really can.

881
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:31.320
They actually can have a conversation with him.
Your relationship guy,

She's completely fuck with my head.

885
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:42.210
I'm not even trying to be in a relationship,
you know,

886
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:45.450

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:46.770

888
00:55:46.771 --> 00:55:50.160
Maybe we have got a puppy Sunday and you'll fucking be in there

889
00:55:52.410 --> 00:55:55.140

890
00:55:55.141 --> 00:55:58.400

891
00:55:58.590 --> 00:55:59.423
<v 6>bear bear</v>

Um,

893
00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:13.880
A bill.
Greetings from Spain.
Oh,
la Mi Amigo.

894
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:15.230
When are you coming here?

895
00:56:16.610 --> 00:56:19.820
I'm going to come there and watch people get run over by bulls at some point.

896
00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:23.660
And I've realized that the place to be at is you want to be in the arena where

897
00:56:23.661 --> 00:56:27.700
there's nowhere left to run,
you know?
Um,
anyway,

898
00:56:27.701 --> 00:56:30.550
I'm 22 and need some advice about a girl on dating.

899
00:56:30.551 --> 00:56:34.870
She was in class with me in high school.
Dude,
are you bilingual?

900
00:56:34.871 --> 00:56:36.580
And you write this?
What is,
this is fucking amazing.

901
00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:40.120
My old Spanish fell off again cause I can't find the disc to put it on this

902
00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:44.860
fucking laptop.
It's only on my old one.
The worst.
Um,

903
00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:50.020
two months or so ago we met again for my best friend's birthday.
Wait,

904
00:56:50.021 --> 00:56:51.520
let's start over again.
Or he forgot what happened.

905
00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.760
She was in class with me in high school.
We were good friends at the time.

906
00:56:54.761 --> 00:56:57.490
Two months ago we met again for my best friend's birthday party.

907
00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.590
She fit in my group of friends pretty well.

908
00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:02.830
And after a couple of days we started flirting with each other.
Finally,

909
00:57:02.831 --> 00:57:06.100
one night we hooked up and now we're dating.
Great.
What could go wrong?

910
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:08.320
Two years ago,

911
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:13.150
she quit her career in college and I picked another one that she liked

912
00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:15.491
two years ago.

913
00:57:15.491 --> 00:57:18.850
She quit her career in college and I picked another one that she liked.

914
00:57:18.851 --> 00:57:23.050
I don't know what that means.
She had to move to Madrid to attend school.
Uh,

915
00:57:23.051 --> 00:57:25.880
yesterday we were having a small,
small,

916
00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:29.560
small pillow talk and I asked her how many guys she'd bang.

917
00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.940
She started counting in my asshole shrunk a little.

918
00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.220
It turns out when she was in Madrid,

919
00:57:36.221 --> 00:57:40.870
she fucked six guys in six months and then started a relationship with another

920
00:57:40.871 --> 00:57:44.320
one that went for a year and a half.
Uh,

921
00:57:44.321 --> 00:57:47.920
they broke up a month ago and now she's with me.

922
00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:51.520
So if my math doesn't fail,
counting her first boyfriend,

923
00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:55.690
the six dude that she's fucked in,
this last guy,
I'm dick number nine.

924
00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:59.290
I slept with six women in my entire life.

925
00:57:59.530 --> 00:58:04.480
And somehow I feel like I'm dating a whore that she still in single digits.

926
00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:10.030
You know,
any nine Dicks,
you're number nine eight.

927
00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:14.650
I'm trying to think of the schoolhouse fucking rock song for eight.

928
00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:17.560
Was there one?
Three is a magic number

929
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:21.070
<v 0>number.
Nah,</v>

930
00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:24.880
we'll put you on the spot.

931
00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:30.120
Number nine

932
00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:34.390
when a not,

933
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:38.550
<v 2>um,
um,
I've slept with six women.
My,</v>

934
00:58:38.551 --> 00:58:42.060
it's so have something six with my entire life in some I feel like I'm dating a

935
00:58:42.061 --> 00:58:45.060
whore.
I can't help but have this horrendous thought in my head.

936
00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:47.010
I'm not a jealous guy at all,

937
00:58:47.011 --> 00:58:50.670
but I caught myself a couple of times and her Facebook page guessing who these

938
00:58:50.671 --> 00:58:54.540
dudes are through.
Don't do that to yourself.
Look,
your competitive.
All right.

939
00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:59.370
You know,
you have six TD passes.
She has nine.
She's going,

940
00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:04.020
she's starting the pro bowl.
Uh,
she's sweet.
She's nice.
She's into me.

941
00:59:04.021 --> 00:59:08.880
But I think it will be different from me to trust this girl,

942
00:59:08.881 --> 00:59:12.750
which had never happened to me before.
I'm feeling miserable.

943
00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:16.560
Any advice will be appreciated.
Yeah.
Dude,
it's not her fault.

944
00:59:16.561 --> 00:59:20.910
You only bank six broad.
All right.
It'd be one thing if she had,

945
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:21.793
um,

946
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:26.450
a history of cheating on guys she was in a relationship with,

947
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:31.880
um,
look,
put it this way,
a woman,

948
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:36.290
if she's even just halfway decent look and can go out to a bar and get dick

949
00:59:36.291 --> 00:59:40.190
every fucking night.
All right.
Now if you could do that,

950
00:59:40.191 --> 00:59:41.630
if he could turn the fucking table,

951
00:59:41.631 --> 00:59:45.500
if you could go out and get laid like that with women,

952
00:59:45.501 --> 00:59:47.630
how many women women will view of banged

953
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:54.080
in fucking six months.
180 is what I'm going to say.

954
00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:57.800
Six months.
30 days of fucking month roughly.
Yeah.

955
00:59:57.801 --> 00:59:59.180
You probably would bang.

956
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.500
You'd probably bang 80 before you started thinking,
what am I doing?

957
01:00:03.501 --> 01:00:07.340
And this is empty.
You know,
she banked sex.

958
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:12.620
Um,
she,
that was probably her fucking little little,
uh,

959
01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.030
she got it out of her system.
You know,

960
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:20.760
she's not fucking around on you.
She's not a horse,
just making ends.
Uh,
uh,

961
01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:24.050
I didn't consider it.
What's the word?
Insecure.

962
01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:29.090
You are right through nine and this day and age with airborne gonorrhea.
I mean,

963
01:00:29.091 --> 01:00:32.270
that's pretty,
that's a pretty fucking low number.
And she did it all in Spain,

964
01:00:32.271 --> 01:00:34.610
way away from San Diego State University,

965
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:39.740
home of Airborne Kinda Rhea Maria,
Maria,
Maria.

966
01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.680
And you think they're going to put that in there?
They're fucking brochure.

967
01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:46.100
You know every,
every college has to be number one in something.

968
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:48.883
Oh my God.

969
01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.760
Who's their big rival in football that you guys got to make the airborne

970
01:00:52.761 --> 01:00:57.761
gonorrhea fucking tee shirts show up with gas masks on for those dirty,

971
01:00:58.161 --> 01:00:59.840
filthy fucking students.

972
01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:05.050
The fact that the fucking chick from the God damn school is sitting there going

973
01:01:05.601 --> 01:01:06.291
in the sad thing,

974
01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:11.291
he didn't even get any ass right there that a fucking lady would talk like that.

975
01:01:12.141 --> 01:01:16.970
Let you know why there's airborne gonorrhea.
Oh,

976
01:01:16.971 --> 01:01:21.090
you fucking skank.
Um,

01:02:00.621 --> 01:02:04.910
I would all right,
but I'm not gonna sit here and lie to the listeners,

989
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:06.710
the listeners.
Um,

990
01:02:06.711 --> 01:02:10.310
you can have virtual answering service with multiple accents that make you sound

991
01:02:10.311 --> 01:02:13.910
bigger than you are.
Transcribe your voicemails to texts or email.

992
01:02:13.911 --> 01:02:15.920
Basically he voice makes your life easier.

993
01:02:15.921 --> 01:02:18.050
It makes a small business owner look much bigger.

994
01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:21.090
My favorite thing is the professional voiceover actors,

995
01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:24.780
actors and actresses that will give you any accent you want and sound all good

996
01:02:24.781 --> 01:02:27.150
looking and stuff and make people want to go to your business.

997
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:31.310
Go to www dot [inaudible] dot com slash bill burr and you can get,

998

Um,

999
01:02:36.031 --> 01:02:38.730

1005
01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.400
You can't do any better than that.
And the last two,

1006
01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:03.930
let me just get these out of the way.
amazon.com holiday shopping starting.
Uh,

1007
01:03:03.931 --> 01:03:06.960
if you'd like to donate to this podcast and the wounded warriors project,

1008
01:03:06.961 --> 01:03:09.540
just go to [inaudible] dot com click on the podcast page,

1009
01:03:09.541 --> 01:03:12.680
click on the Amazon banner.
Anything you buy after that on Amazon,

1010
01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:16.290
they'll give me a piece.
I kicked the,
uh,
a piece of the piece over to,
uh,

1011
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:21.330
the wounded warriors project.
And then you go and that's it.
Um,

1012
01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.630
okay.
Bill,
what am I doing?
I'm originally from Massachusetts.

1013
01:03:24.631 --> 01:03:28.590
I recently got out of the army,
infantry and I'm now living in Hawaii.

1014
01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:33.750
They go,
Huh,
that's,
that's a good deal.
He goes,

1015
01:03:33.751 --> 01:03:37.200
it's not as good as it sounds.
Okay.
All right.
Well,
there goes all that happiness.

1016
01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:41.820
I stayed here because I fell in love with a smoking hot local girl.

1017
01:03:41.821 --> 01:03:45.360
She's 29 with three kids,
all from the same guy,

1018
01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:48.450
but he's a fucking piece of shit in and out of jail for being,
um,

1019
01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.750
a meth head like most Hawaiians.

1020
01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:57.480
Anyway,
sometimes it feel trapped here playing daddy.

1021
01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:02.310
I'm 25 years old.
Ben All over the world,
done my time in the middle of the Terry.

1022
01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:06.690
Now I'm going to school to be a firefighter.
Had a fucking college,

1023
01:04:06.691 --> 01:04:11.640
were only 6% of the people are white and they fucking hate white people.

1024
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:16.050
How the white people hate white people.
All right.

1025
01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:20.850
But it's kind of good deal because her grandfather is a retired federal fire

1026
01:04:20.851 --> 01:04:24.480
chief.
So in a year I can be in the firehouse.

1027
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:28.860
I don't know what to do.
She and the kids aren't too bad.
Honestly.

1028
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:30.540
It's all fucking amazing.

1029
01:04:30.541 --> 01:04:34.530
But I still feel trapped in this fucking twilight zone fucking life where I've

1030
01:04:34.531 --> 01:04:38.610
got three kids and a wife,
air quote.
Another option is,
um,

1031
01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.990
back in mass drinking beers and trying to avoid getting any felony convictions.

1032
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:44.700
I don't fucking know,
man.

1033
01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.030
Sometimes I just feel like I'm letting the best years of my life get away from

1034
01:04:48.031 --> 01:04:48.510
me.

1035
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:52.620
Then I think maybe these are the best years of my life and I start crying into

1036
01:04:52.621 --> 01:04:54.660
my fucking beer.
He got to need advice.

1037
01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.170
I need a new point of view on this whole thing.
Thanks man.
Jesus,
dude,

1038
01:04:58.171 --> 01:05:00.130
this is a fucking dilemma.
You know,

1039
01:05:00.131 --> 01:05:02.820
you gave me just enough information to still be

1040
01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:04.470
<v 3>okay.</v>

1041
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:09.190
<v 2>All right.
Are you going to marry this girl,
the lover like that?</v>

1042
01:05:10.090 --> 01:05:14.740
When you're 35,
she's 39 is 65.
She's 69.
You know,

1043
01:05:14.741 --> 01:05:17.020
is she going to have any more kids with you?
How many kids do you,

1044
01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:17.980
how many more kids

1045
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.630
<v 1>to she want?
You know,
they got fires in Massachusetts too,
you know,</v>

1046
01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:27.700
so you can always be a firefighter wherever the fuck you go.
Um,

1047
01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:32.350
are you ready for all of this?
This is what you got to ask yourself.

1048
01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:38.530
You know,
it sounds like you're pretty happy.
You live in a paradise,
you know,

1049
01:05:38.531 --> 01:05:40.990
with those volcanoes there,
you're always going to have work.

1050
01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:45.790
There's always going to be some fires,
right.
You know,

1051
01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:49.660
when the dollar collapses,
while it's still a zillion people there,

1052
01:05:49.661 --> 01:05:54.280
you can still have some shit going on.
Um,
yeah dude,
this is up to you.

1053
01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:58.930
Hate to say that.
I mean,
when I was 25 years old,

1054
01:05:58.931 --> 01:06:03.490
I was not ready to be living in Hawaii with a woman four years older than me

1055
01:06:03.491 --> 01:06:08.200
with three fucking kids.
I was not ready to do that.
Um,

1056
01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:14.590
so
I understand why.
If you're feeling shit like that,

1057
01:06:14.591 --> 01:06:17.500
I definitely get that.
But I also hadn't traveled the fucking world,

1058
01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:20.680
fought in a war and done all,
all this stuff that you've done.

1059
01:06:20.681 --> 01:06:25.660
You've lived way more life than I have at 25.
So,
uh,

1060
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:27.580
yeah.
You just got to ask yourself those questions.

1061
01:06:27.581 --> 01:06:32.320
What the fuck do you want to do?
You know,
smoking hot local girls,

1062
01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:37.090
29,
he's got three kids.
Uh,
you're on the fucking beach.

1063
01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.580
Once you make friends with Woody Harrelson and get some fucking weed.

1064
01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.700
I'm sorry dude.
I don't know what to tell you.
This is one,
you know what,

1065
01:06:44.701 --> 01:06:46.030
you're gonna have to be on your own in this one.

1066
01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:50.110
This is too big a fucking decision.
Too big a decision.

1067
01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:54.160
I would just say,
do I love this girl?
Is she the one or am I just here?

1068
01:06:54.161 --> 01:06:57.520
Cause she's fucking smoking hot and you know,

1069
01:06:58.410 --> 01:06:59.710
doesn't have any tan lines.

1070
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:07.180
That's what I would ask myself.
All right,
that's the podcast for this week.
Um,

1071
01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:11.980
tonight I am flying to Sydney,
Australia,

1072
01:07:11.981 --> 01:07:13.360
14 fucking hours.

1073
01:07:13.361 --> 01:07:17.110
Hopefully there'll be no airborne gonorrhea on the fucking plane.

1074
01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:22.750
Um,
ah,
fuck me.
This is going to suck.

1075
01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:25.720
But once I land it's going to be awesome.
And um,

1076
01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:31.030
I'm going to fuck in a,
I'm going to have great shows out there.

1077
01:07:31.031 --> 01:07:34.120
I'm really excited.
I got three nights of shows as far as I know.

1078
01:07:34.121 --> 01:07:36.820
I think they're all sold out.
And uh,

1079
01:07:36.850 --> 01:07:40.300
so thank you for all the podcasts listeners out there and Sydney for stepping it

1080
01:07:40.301 --> 01:07:44.800
up.
And uh,
Oh and also another thing about rugby,
I forgot,

1081
01:07:44.801 --> 01:07:47.500
some guy sent me a story,
some guy lost his ball.

1082
01:07:48.110 --> 01:07:51.490
And the first half of the rugby game and he played the rest of the fucking way.

1083
01:07:51.491 --> 01:07:52.900
So whatever.
All right.

1084
01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:59.320
I would put the way the NFL used to be up against rugby.
Now,
um,

1085
01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:00.750
my buddy Joe Barton at Kooskia,

1086
01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:05.530
who's got a new CD coming out is going to be on hyping a his CD here in a couple

1087
01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:08.320
of weeks when he releases it said the funniest thing to me.
He said,

1088
01:08:08.321 --> 01:08:13.150
if you want to watch how NFL football used to be,
watch SCC football.
So they go.

1089
01:08:13.151 --> 01:08:15.830
So if you're an old fucking NFL head like me,

1090
01:08:15.831 --> 01:08:19.340
and you're a little disappointed with the escort that the fucking cornerbacks do

1091
01:08:19.341 --> 01:08:23.990
now is a rundown on the field and how you can't block a fucking quarterback

1092
01:08:23.991 --> 01:08:27.050
after he just threw a fucking interception and he's basically trying to make a

1093
01:08:27.051 --> 01:08:31.760
play.
Uh,
SCC football,
pick a team.
Alabama,

1094
01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:35.840
Lsu,
Georgia,
Florida,
South Carolina,
Vanderbilt,
Tennessee,

1095
01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:40.580
Arkansas and Mississippi,
Mississippi state.
Who the fuck did I forget?
Kentucky.

1096
01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:45.620
Somebody fucking else.
Auburn War Eagle.

1097
01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.580
We're all fucking great.
Great to watch.
Uh,
that's it.

1098
01:08:49.581 --> 01:08:52.280
That's a podcast for this week.
Go fuck yourselves.

1099
01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:57.200
I'm bringing my mixed all the way over to Sydney,
Australia.

1100
01:08:57.290 --> 01:09:00.450
Uh,
we're going to have great time out there and a I,

1101
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:03.890
we'll give you some photos and all that type of shit.
All right,
that's it.

1102
01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:08.900
Go fuck yourselves.
Please watch night of too many stars this week on,
um,

1103
01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:13.730
on comedy central and thanks to everybody at inside the NFL.
I,

1104
01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:16.040
it was a dream come true to be able to do that show.

1105
01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:20.570
And I'm for all fans of that show.
Um,
I,

1106
01:09:20.571 --> 01:09:25.220
I can't tell you how,
how hilarious everybody was.

1107
01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:29.240
It was such a good time.
Just the ball breaking that those guys do.

1108
01:09:29.241 --> 01:09:31.580
It's just like you're in a locker room,
you know,

1109
01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:33.530
that's all they do is give each other shit.

1110
01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:37.940
And when we would be in between segments,
you know,

1111
01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:42.230
they would like just egging me on,
give us more shit,
give us more shit.

1112
01:09:42.231 --> 01:09:45.920
They would just,
just totally,
just couldn't have been nicer.
Uh,

1113
01:09:45.921 --> 01:09:49.160
which ended up being great for me cause I really didn't even feel worthy to be

1114
01:09:49.161 --> 01:09:53.780
on the show.
So thank you to those guys.
Um,
and that's it.

1115
01:09:53.781 --> 01:09:56.570
That's the podcast.
All right?
Go fuck yourselves.
We'll talk to you next week.
