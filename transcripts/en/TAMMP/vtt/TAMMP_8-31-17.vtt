<v 1>Hey,

It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.</v>

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:08.100
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast,
Dan.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.720
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.700
<v 1>Yeah.
I'm just checking in on you.
Just checking in to see how your day's going.</v>

6
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.280
Give you a quick,
some fucking half hour laughs,
you know,

7
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.790
keep me in your thoughts and in your prayers.

8
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.490
<v 0>Okay?</v>

9
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.020
<v 1>You're in our thoughts and you're in our prayers.
Speaking of that,
Houston,
Texas.</v>

10
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.910
All right,
I got a warning for everybody.
All right?
There's going to be all

11
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.040
bunch of people making money off that fucking devastation down there.

12
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.681
All right?

13
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:44.520
Be careful where you send your money and cause people are going to make videos.

14
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.700
They're going to have your bottom lip quiver and you're going to feel bad for

15
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:52.080
them.
And the family fucking dog just makes sure it's getting to those people.

16
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.950
New York Times put our list of shit.
That's legit.

17
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.543
<v 0>All right.</v>

18
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.760
<v 1>Fucking sat down.</v>

19
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.430
Somebody sent me something of this woman saying she was a single mom with two

20
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:08.970
kids,
right?
And uh,
I didn't know what to do.

21
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.600
It's like,
do I sent,
does this get to you?

22
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.710
Is there a bald hairy back guy on the other end of this?

23
00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:18.360
So I'm sticking with the Red Cross.

24
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.133
<v 0>You know,</v>

25
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.580
<v 1>as I was looking at all those,
I just kept hearing that song.</v>

26
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:27.480
How do I know that y'all really drown in,
right?

27
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.510
How do I fucking know?
How do I know this is not a scam?

28
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.930
Because people are such pieces of Shit Uk,

29
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.940
they will actually like I want to fuck,

30
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.510
I swear to God they could literally take it when they find those fucking people,

31
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.320
they find those people.
They should,
they should take all the money back,

32
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.500
give it to the victims.
And when the neck hurt,
next hurricane comes,

33
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.520
you dropped those fuckers right in the middle of it,
right in the middle of it.

34
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.520
And then when they cry for help,
nobody sends him fucking help.

35
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:54.271
That's what they should do.

36
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:58.020
The kinds of pieces of the shit that would fucking take advantage of people

37
00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:02.700
during a situation like that.
So,
um,
yeah,

38
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.230
I would donate to the Red Cross.

39
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:07.260
I'm not going to tell you whether I'm donating or how much of doting and cause

40
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:11.330
I'm sick of fucking people talking about that.
You know,
I donate it.

41
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.760
[inaudible] they can you can you,
can you not make it about yourself?

42
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.990
Fucking celebrities.
Gee,
what,

43
00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:22.110
what would they be doing if they weren't making everything about themselves?

44
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.230
Somebody else's absolute fucking devastation becomes an opportunity for them to

45
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:29.640
show how fucking amazing they are.

46
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.563
<v 0>Ah,</v>

47
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.050
<v 1>fucking horrific.
Anyways,</v>

48
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.620
I shot nine holes of golf when I was back east.
It was baggy.

49
00:02:38.621 --> 00:02:42.270
She leaves your new family.
[inaudible] and um,
you know,

50
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.510
I love going out and playing golf.
I let you go out there.
There's a foursome.

51
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.050
Everybody's talking,
Shit,
I'm smoking a cigar.
I'm having a good time.

52
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.090
I don't keep score.
I don't give a fuck.

53
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.890
I think I've got a 27 combined in the first two holes.
I was just,
you know,

54
00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.670
yeah,
I go,
I do it like John Daly.
Like I don't fucking,
I don't sit there in line,

55
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:03.370
the Goddamn ball up going gonna waste everybody's fucking time.

56
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.250
I just walk up and hit it.
I take one practice swing,
that's it.

57
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:08.740
Then I hit the fucking thing.
All right.

58
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:12.790
I just fucking wind up and you know,
I hit it straight.

59
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:17.410
It just doesn't go for.
So,
uh,
those guys started giving me tips.

60
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.530
I started listening to them and they just kept picturing how the swing on TV,

61
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.270
keep that front arms straight,
you know,
keep your leg down,
you know,

62
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:29.290
that type of shit.
And I ended up doing all right.
You know,

63
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.780
I started breaking eight on holes.
I hate when they go,

64
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:34.780
you can't score more than an eight on a whole.
It's like,
Oh yeah,
watch me,

65
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.920
watch me.
I'll still be 200 yards from the hole taking fucking shot number nine.

66
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.210
All right,
that is it.
That is a fucking myth.
My friend,

67
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.220
he has to do with like handicaps or something.
It's just yet another way,

68
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.670
you know,
so there's no cheating or whatever.

69
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.700
It's the biggest fucking cheat and game.

70
00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.970
I'm trying to think other than like,
you know,
business.
Um,
so anyways,

71
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.950
I got down to the last hole I got,

72
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.980
I got like a s a seven on the eighth hole was psyched that I broke aid and then

73
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:13.201
on the last hole was a par four and I shot a four Sanka 30 fucking fun.

74
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.793
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

75
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.850
<v 1>was all right.
It's all right.
And once again I just,</v>

76
00:04:19.851 --> 00:04:21.200
and then the guy who I was playing with,

77
00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:25.760
the oldest guy in our group was like looking like it was pushing 60 and he shot

78
00:04:25.761 --> 00:04:29.270
party tea party for nine holes.
Once again,

79
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.640
proving it's not a,
it's not a sport,
it's a game.
It's a fucking game.

80
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.240
There's no way it's 60.
You know what I mean?

81
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.230
That's like the basketball equivalent is still being able to dunk when you're 60

82
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.900
you know,
and I don't mean cause you're seven feet tall.

83
00:04:44.901 --> 00:04:46.730
I mean you're like fucking six three.

84
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.750
He used to throw it down a little bit back in the day and then you come back for

85
00:04:50.751 --> 00:04:53.060
the old timers game and you still fucking dunking.

86
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.710
He is still dropping 30 and then you're doing it on people like 20 years younger

87
00:04:57.711 --> 00:04:59.910
than you get the fuck outta here.
Um,

88
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.580
but I got to admit I really didn't join somebody finally explained that.

89
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.170
Why you tee the ball up high?

90
00:05:06.171 --> 00:05:08.720
I would teed up high and then try to hit it flush with the club.

91
00:05:08.721 --> 00:05:10.340
I didn't know you kind of swung underneath it.

92
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.120
That was a game changer and uh,

93
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.530
<v 0>okay.</v>

94
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.390
<v 1>That was the,
I dunno my shit as I stink kitten off the ground on the fairway.</v>

95
00:05:21.391 --> 00:05:22.320
I'm not good at that shit.

96
00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:26.550
But I feel like I could take a couple of lessons and uh,

97
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.070
I could go out there and not embarrass myself.

98
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.333
<v 0>MMM.</v>

99
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.950
<v 1>I only lost,
I only lost one.
I think two balls in nine holes.</v>

100
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:39.290
That's pretty good for someone that never fucking plays my pat and myself.

101
00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:42.200
Am I making this about myself?
Am I pulling some fucking move here?

102
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.580
Do you know how much money I donated to that golf course when I saw all those

103
00:05:47.841 --> 00:05:51.890
white men out there?
I knew I had to do something.

104
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.780
Um,

105
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.780
that's why I created the fun for cause named after me with my face on it because

106
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:05.440
I care.
All right,

107
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.560
why does this thing always do this to me?
And then I,

108
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.170
I typed in the wrong fucking password,
didn't I?
And Go fuck yourself.
God dammit.

109
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.210
All right.
So yeah,
so I,
you know,
something,
I actually enjoy golf.

110
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.520
I don't have the fucking time for it,
but I do enjoy it.
Um,

111
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.110
I also,
uh,

112
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.470
was fucking with my first drunk kid I ever had and it's amazing now that I

113
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:33.050
actually know what a tune up the drums,
I got the snare to sound great,

114
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:36.020
but my fucking bass drum,
I don't know what was going on with it.

115
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:40.580
There was like this vibration of something,
no idea what it was.

116
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.680
Maybe that,
you know,
it's one of those that's an old school.

117
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:46.130
Slingerland maybe I didn't have the,
uh,
you know,
he has the clause on it,

118
00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:49.010
which sucks because if you're gonna do like a quarter turn,

119
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:51.320
those ones that are on the ground,
you can't fucking do it.

120
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.130
He just got to be a guy.
We're just going to leave those ones alum.
But um,

121
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.070
I got the toms in the snare to sound good.
The bass drums,

122
00:06:58.071 --> 00:07:02.450
the last fucking thing that I need to learn how to tune up and then I have a

123
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:06.440
nice jump off and I think I'll actually Sunday actually be able to tune up a set

124
00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:09.860
of drums.
Make them Sandra.
Right.
That's the goal anyways.
That is the goal,

125
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.443
you know,

126
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.970
shooting less than an eight when I go out and golf every seven years and uh,

127
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.320
being able to Napa fucking set of drums.
By the way,

128
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.130
speaking of that Queens of the stone age,
his new album,

129
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:28.160
have you listened to it yet?
Jesus Christ.
It's fucking amazing.

130
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.540
Listen to it twice.
I loved it the first time.
It was even better the second time.

131
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.280
And um,

132
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.360
<v 3>okay.</v>

133
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.430
<v 1>He got out on.
No,
you don't have to check it out.</v>

134
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:39.590
I'm just saying if you like fucking great music,

135
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.590
I would definitely check that out.
That's what I've been listening to it.

136
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:45.210
But listening to that and um,

137
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.590
what's his face there with the fuck is my phone.
I can't remember any,

138
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.880
anything anymore.
The fuck is the guy's name.

139
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.410
<v 3>Okay.</v>

140
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:59.060
<v 1>The Guy who sings a Marlo Vizo Phi.</v>

141
00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:02.110
Yeah.
Uh,
uh,

142
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.990
the fuck is his name.

143
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:07.550
<v 3>Okay.</v>

144
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.640
<v 1>Yeah.
Jesus Christ.
I gotta look up dream weaver.
Weaver.
No,</v>

145
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.090
so we're not going to do,
we'll,
we'll,
we'll drink Gary.
Right.

146
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.900
Gary writes album the fuck's the name of the album here.

147
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.930
It's called the dream.
We are no Nada.
Is that the,
what's it called,

148
00:08:22.931 --> 00:08:27.930
the dream weaver?
It's under soft rock,

149
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.350
but we don't,
Andy Newmark,

150
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.540
one of my new favorite fucking drum is plays on it and he's unbelievable.

151
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.000
I just switched to drums are more up in the mix.

152
00:08:36.001 --> 00:08:39.630
Something about like drums in the fucking seventies they just,

153
00:08:39.631 --> 00:08:42.570
it was like they had a towel over the entire fucking kit.

154
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.760
They can't hear anything.
I'm,
once again,
the genius of John Bond them to be like,

155
00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:52.720
dude,
fuck that.
You can't hear the drums.
I wish.

156
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:57.600
I wish they would remaster that fucking album and bring Andy's drums up so I can

157
00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:59.100
hear him.
It's fucking incredible.

158
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.610
Incredible player and everybody sleeps on that album.

159
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:06.420
Everybody just downloads Dreamweaver and love is alive.
Can't find the judges.

160
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.300
Great.
Let it out is great blind feeling.

161
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.310
It's a fucking tremendous album.

162
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.950
And what he wanted to do evidently was good to get away from that.

163
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:21.420
You wanted to have like a fucking get away from everything being guitar based.

164
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.170
I don't think it's soft rock doe.
Some of it is,
but not all of it.

165
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.990
It's got some balls.
Right?

166
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.610
Does anybody know what I'm talking about or who I'm talking about?
Probably not.

167
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.070
Oh,
look who's in town this week.

168
00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:38.730
The Boston Red Sox had going to the fucking New York Yankees.

169
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.170
I got two of my buddies.
I'm Ben,
50 bucks a game for the rest of the year.
I'm up,

170
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.630
I'm up 100 on both of them.
Uh,
am I?
Yeah,

171
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.200
I think I'm up 100 bucks on both of them.
So I'm up 200 bucks total.

172
00:09:52.201 --> 00:09:55.590
So I went to lose a hundred depending on if the red sox win or lose.

173
00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:59.880
So worst case scenario,
I'm down 200 bucks this weekend,
I believe.

174
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.540
I think that's what it is,
right?
Yeah.
That's what the fuck it is.
Um,

175
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.780
I'm hoping we've been playing great.
They got swept,

176
00:10:06.781 --> 00:10:09.450
but they played the fucking Indians.
The Indians are on fire.

177
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.930
So we'll see what happens with backup to a five and a half game lead.

178
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:16.350
I'm loving that.
And who knows?
With any luck,
we'll play the Yankees and the,

179
00:10:16.351 --> 00:10:20.910
and the fucking playoffs hasn't happened in a long time since 2004.

180
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.740
If I was a giants fan,
I would bring that up all the time.
Um,

181
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.890
I remember when new champion 15 years ago,

182
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.000
we've won championships since then.
Everybody,
it doesn't matter.

183
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.400
You can do it that year.
Um,
like Yankee Fan.

184
00:10:36.401 --> 00:10:40.890
So you give a shit about 2004 considering you one in 2009,
does it really hurt?

185
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.330
You know what I mean?
Exactly.
All right.
So,
um,
all Billy,

186
00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:48.660
no fun.
14 fucking days,
no booze.

187
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.090
Once I get this far out in front of it,

188
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.560
once they get this far out in front of it,
I could literally go a year,
um,

189
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.310
you know,
I could go the rest of my fucking life.
I just don't choose to,

190
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.600
you know,
it's fun.
I enjoy it,

191
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.340
but fortunately I don't have that fucking chemical think.

192
00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:14.230
Did I already talk about this because I've started this podcast like 19 times

193
00:11:14.231 --> 00:11:17.350
because I'm never funny generally.

194
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.250
And I'm really not funny on days when I fucking fly.
Um,

195
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.230
so I'm 14 days in.
I did real good with the,

196
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.580
when I was back east for the first couple of days in the last two days I fucked

197
00:11:27.581 --> 00:11:32.280
up,
uh,
in a major way.
Lots of pizzas and that type of shit.
Um,

198
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:36.040
I went to my favorite pizza spot twice and then,
uh,

199
00:11:36.041 --> 00:11:40.870
I got this other new spot where I got ahead of free some fucking pizzas for me

200
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.790
and I'm trying to send them out here through dry ice and all that bullshit.

201
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.050
We'll see what the fuck happens.
Um,
we'll see if it happens,
man.

202
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.220
Um,
should I read some at this point?

203
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.170
Is that what I should do?

204
00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.340
I think I've talked about everything that I promote the surf ballroom in clear

205
00:12:00.341 --> 00:12:04.210
Lake Iowa,
by the way,
it November 5th,
I think is what I'm going to be there.

206
00:12:04.211 --> 00:12:05.140
That's where buddy Holly,

207
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:09.190
the big Bopper in Ritchie Valens last play it and be there with Dean del Ray.

208
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:10.960
And I know I brought this up on Monday,

209
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.990
but I got to keep promoting this fucking date because they don't do a lot of

210
00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:18.820
standup dates.
I'm performing there because I'm a fan of music and,
uh,

211
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.030
I always wanted to see that it's like a museum slash place where you can
perform.

212
00:12:22.031 --> 00:12:24.760
So I was like,
why don't I just fucking do both and make a little bit of money?

213
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.060
I get to see this.
They get to pay my respects.
You know what I mean?

214
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:28.960
But I will tell you what,

215
00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:31.840
I am not going to be playing any of that fucking music that night cause I'm sure

216
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:36.160
everybody who works there is so God damn sick of hearing a pig.
He says,

217
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:40.920
you pay gets to you pick the pig seat.
I'm not going to do the to,

218
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.650
um,
I'm going to do the,
uh,

219
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.970
the movie version of it to Gary Busey version of it.
You know,

220
00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:52.540
just to switch things up for you.
All right,
what am I doing here?
Let's,
uh,

221
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.300
by the way,
it's about people given Donald Trump shit.

222
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.400
Whenever there's a fucking natural disaster,

223
00:12:57.401 --> 00:12:59.410
they always give the standing president shit like,

224
00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:03.250
like what is he fucking Zeus as he supposed to stop it from happening?

225
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.820
You know,
I heard something today that one of the problems was,
it was one,

226
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.300
the people that developed in Houston,

227
00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:14.500
they paved over a bunch of wetlands that would have absorbed a lot of that
water,

228
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.640
which then got them talking about how out here in La that they've,

229
00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.920
they've built over land that was just,
it's just going to disintegrate,
you know,

230
00:13:23.921 --> 00:13:28.300
whenever we have a big earthquake or something.
Um,
cause they were like,

231
00:13:28.301 --> 00:13:31.180
well why don't we do about out here now that we sell what's going on in Houston,

232
00:13:31.181 --> 00:13:33.520
what should we do out here?
I'm like,
there's no fucking hurricanes out here.

233
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.170
But there's always something.
The old earthquakes already,
Aaron,
when Aaron,

234
00:13:38.171 --> 00:13:41.860
he comes to town,
um,
shaking everything up,
right?

235
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.820
It's like your absentee father comes off the road after a fucking three year

236
00:13:45.821 --> 00:13:48.850
bender starts telling you to make your bed,
you know,

237
00:13:48.851 --> 00:13:51.580
like are you fucking doing that?
Then he beats you like he doesn't even know you.

238
00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:56.650
That's what an earthquake is like.
Um,
all right,
let's read some advertising here.

239
00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.910
Okay.
What do we got here?
Oh,
Jesus.
These people are new.
Sue,

240
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.350
do you play sports or workout a lot?

241
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:09.790
Talk about how sore you can get from that and now I can trigger injuries.

242
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.170
Why?
Why isn't this shit ever edited out of the fucking reading?
Oh,

243
00:14:14.171 --> 00:14:17.680
I played golf this weekend.
It's now this week.
It's not really a sport.

244
00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:20.200
It's an activity.
I felt fine after.

245
00:14:20.201 --> 00:14:24.880
It's certainly after I s fucking sank that 30 foot.
Uh,
I do work out.

246
00:14:24.881 --> 00:14:28.900
I fucked up my,
uh,
my shoulder,
you know?
Yeah.

247
00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:32.950
It's annoying that I talk about it long enough.
All right.

248
00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.680
Lead into your personal endorsement.

249
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:40.000
Talk about your personal experience with your soothing massage.

250
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.110
I don't even know what it is.
I haven't.
How relaxed you are afterwards,

251
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:49.060
how easy it was to book,
how excited you are for the next booking,
et cetera.

252
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.770
All right.
Now,
now that after they wrote me all that,

253
00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.610
I guess I'm supposed to look at this shit before do this sue.

254
00:14:55.611 --> 00:14:59.530
There's an on demand massage service.
Wow.
Geez.

255
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.900
Oh Geez.
Is now.
Okay.

256
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.070
Do you get to see what you must Seuss looks like he is swiping left.

257
00:15:10.071 --> 00:15:13.130
What's going on here?
Ah,
sue,

258
00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:18.131
there's an on demand massage service that delivers a hand selected,

259
00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:22.760
licensed and experienced massage therapist to you in the comfort of your own

260
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:26.840
home hotel or office in his little as an hour.

261
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:30.410
Sue's shows up.
I'm sure these people are above board,
but you know,

262
00:15:30.411 --> 00:15:33.440
there's always a couple of dirty cops out there that'll take bribe money.

263
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.010
So there's an odd man I read that.
Um,

264
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:43.100
sue the shows up with everything.
They bring the massage table,
the sheets,

265
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:48.130
the oil and even music to drown you out at the end.

266
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.910
Ah,
so you can unwind no matter where you are.
I'm sorry,

267
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:56.030
I'm being really immature,
really mature.
This is all above board.

268
00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.490
There's no fucking way we would,
we would do something like that.

269
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:03.880
You choose the kind of massage you want from Swedish and sport,

270
00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:08.750
the deep tissue and more that just fucking Laba in this opening and that you can

271
00:16:08.751 --> 00:16:11.810
even opt for couples massages.
All right,
here we go.

272
00:16:11.811 --> 00:16:13.850
Get a little fucking freaky set.

273
00:16:13.851 --> 00:16:17.540
The length of your massage and uh,

274
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:21.590
get to also pick the gender of your therapist aren't right for the homophobes

275
00:16:21.591 --> 00:16:22.250
out there.

276
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:27.250
Therapists can earn over three and a half times what they make it a spa while

277
00:16:27.471 --> 00:16:32.390
maintaining incredibly an incredible schedule flexibility.

278
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:37.280
That means you can even book a massage for 10:00 PM on a Wednesday.

279
00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.180
This also brings the best therapist to the PSU.

280
00:16:41.181 --> 00:16:45.650
That network you can book via the iPhone or Android App on the web.

if they can legalize weed,

292
00:17:28.641 --> 00:17:32.780
why can't they just legalize a hand job at the end of a fucking massage?

293
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:36.470
You know what I mean?
Jesus Christ.

294
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.340
And just so like the women wouldn't get all fucking upset cause God,

295
00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:43.370
they should have some for women too.
But I'm just saying I go,
oh my God.

296
00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:45.710
But it starts with dad and any wide yet touching her,

297

just have him strap you down like a fucking love bottomy patient and you know,

and then that's it.

299
00:17:52.081 --> 00:17:57.081
Then you can't touch him by he do you know how much mapo peaceful the fucking

300
00:17:57.391 --> 00:18:01.530
world would be if every guy started the day with the massage and a fucking hand

job.
Do you know,

but ladies,

303
00:18:07.261 --> 00:18:11.730
we've been asking you to do this for us for years.
And evidently,
you know,

304
00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:14.910
after two,
three months into the relationship,
it's outs.
It's,

305
00:18:14.911 --> 00:18:17.070
it's not your pay grade anymore.

306
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:18.130
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

307
00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.470
<v 1>Okay.
And what's funny is you could,
you could see,</v>

308
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.590
you fucking ladies are going to come at me like I'm a fucking animal.

309
00:18:23.591 --> 00:18:24.880
Despite the fact,
you know,

310
00:18:24.881 --> 00:18:27.640
this is how guys are wired and you use it to your advantage.

311
00:18:27.641 --> 00:18:29.260
Whenever you want to fucking rounded drench,

312
00:18:29.261 --> 00:18:31.510
you fucking let the girls out a little bit,
right?

313
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:35.350
You look at somebody just long enough for them to fucking throw down their card.

314
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.760
You get your drink and then you go,
oh,

315
00:18:36.761 --> 00:18:40.990
excuse me that I have a very important call over this way with at the table just

316
00:18:40.991 --> 00:18:43.540
opened up.
Um,
yeah,

317
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.760
and if elected pan jobs at the end of massages would be made legal,

318
00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:52.750
provided the male was strapped down by the wrist,

319
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:59.370
um,

320
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:04.500
then you get out of like an express massage window when you don't have time for

321
00:19:04.501 --> 00:19:08.640
the full body massage and you just pull up like those drive through Starbucks

322
00:19:08.641 --> 00:19:09.990
with like your deck out in some,

323
00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.050
some chick just reaches out and fucking rubs went out.
There you go.

324
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:16.020
Then you fucking drive to work,
you know,

325
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.450
cause she's stopping at the yellow light at that point.

326
00:19:18.451 --> 00:19:19.680
What the fuck do you care?

327
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.043
<v 0>You know,</v>

328
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:25.780
<v 1>I hope women don't get offended by this.
Well,
who's getting,
no,</v>

329
00:19:25.781 --> 00:19:27.670
I don't give a shit.
If you're doing it,
but you know,

330
00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:32.710
rather than look down at med,
why don't you understand,
you know,

331
00:19:32.711 --> 00:19:35.470
and try to have empathy and understand what it is that we're going through.

332
00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:40.030
Oh my God,
that would be fucking tremendous.
Drive through fucking massage.

333
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.230
You know what I mean?
And it's,
you know,
this is what would shut it down.

334
00:19:44.231 --> 00:19:47.620
Some dope would also try to add a coffee machine to it and eventually someone

335
00:19:47.621 --> 00:19:50.450
would spill coffee on the deck and that would be just a fucking lawsuit.

336
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:53.470
They would take the whole industry down.
All right.
I don't know.

337
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.530
I'm just brainstorming here.
Alright.
Oh Dodo.

338
00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.070
<v 5>Dope.
Dope me undies.

340
00:20:04.571 --> 00:20:08.740
I'll keep quiet.
I won't shout.
If we could be legal,

341
00:20:08.741 --> 00:20:10.330
why not be a job?

342
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:16.140
<v 1>And when you come in,
you're fucking Soffe shorts.
Oh Jesus.

345
00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:25.410

You know what I mean?

346
00:20:25.411 --> 00:20:26.580
Let's not blame the underwear here.

00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:03.584
introduced.

425
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:08.770
Express pay lets drivers get paid almost instantly instead of waiting for weeks

426
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.950
lift as even taking the guesswork out of pickups.
Where is he?

427
00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.240
The new APP device uses color coding to help passages find their drivers.

428
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:20.060
You can earn hundreds of dollars a week plus tips.
You want to earn more money,

429
00:25:20.061 --> 00:25:23.900
drive more,
drive more.
It's never been easier to give yourself a race.

430
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.660
It's a simple formula.
Happy drivers being happy passengers.

431
00:25:26.661 --> 00:25:29.960
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 Lyft rides get a perfect five star rating.

432
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:34.940
Go to lift.com/bar today and you can get a $500 new driver bonus.

433
00:25:34.941 --> 00:25:39.941
That's lyft.com/burr lyft.com/burr limited time only terms do apply.

434
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.310
All right.

435
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:48.310
I'm laying on the floor and my fucking back trying to fix that fucking crib

436
00:25:48.531 --> 00:25:49.364
downstairs.

437
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:51.773
<v 0>Ugh.</v>

438
00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.390
<v 1>That's the thing.
Once your kid just gets over like fucking seven,
eight months,</v>

439
00:25:55.391 --> 00:25:58.930
you know,
it's just like you pick it up,
this sack of potatoes,
you don't,

440
00:25:58.931 --> 00:26:01.930
you didn't have a squat down to do it right.
You bend at the waist,
right?

441
00:26:01.931 --> 00:26:06.400
Blowing out your lower back.
It's the fucking worst.
Um,

442
00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.190
all right.
What the hell did I want to talk about?

443
00:26:09.191 --> 00:26:12.820
Was there anything to talk about beyond,

444
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:14.170
<v 0>yeah,</v>

445
00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.560
<v 1>what everybody else is talking about.
I tried to stay outside of all of that.</v>

446
00:26:17.561 --> 00:26:21.430
You know what I mean?
Everybody's like,
you know,
talking about it,

447
00:26:21.431 --> 00:26:24.340
raining down in Houston,
right?
The hurricane and all of that shit.

448
00:26:24.341 --> 00:26:28.840
Am I going to be yet another?
I guess I already did,
but I did it in a way.

449
00:26:28.841 --> 00:26:32.530
I actually told you to watch out for these fucking scams.
How do I know?
Right?

450
00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:37.240
You always got to ask that because I gave a bunch of money to that wounded

451
00:26:37.241 --> 00:26:40.510
warriors thing and then I got all this information that it was a fucking scam.

452
00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.770
I don't know if it is or not,
but there was enough fucking article that it was,

453
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:48.890
and it made me nervous that allegedly that's what they were doing over there and

454
00:26:49.841 --> 00:26:52.020
they fucking turned me off to charities that,

455
00:26:52.021 --> 00:26:54.000
that they could possibly be somebody out there then,
you know,

456
00:26:54.001 --> 00:26:58.110
watching that pink lady in the NFL.
So make sure you fucking money,

457
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.270
you know,
gets to the people.

458
00:27:00.271 --> 00:27:04.830
Speaking of which Ron White is doing a gig out in Austin,
Texas,

459
00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.520
he's going out with some other comedians in all,

460
00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:14.010
all the proceeds are going to be going to,
uh,
you know,

461
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:18.690
help out the people there in Houston.
Um,
so there's a good one you can go to.

462
00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.450
All right.
I wasn't able to make the GIG and I said,

463
00:27:21.451 --> 00:27:25.110
well who should I make the check out to?
He said,
Red Cross.
All right.

464
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.000
So then I looked it up.
Is the Red Cross?
I know,
I saw him on mash.

465
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.550
Are they reputable?
And they checked out.
They are reputable.
So there you go.

466
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.420
All right.
And with that,
I am completely out of shit to talk about.

467
00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.380
I don't know what I've talked about cause I've started this fucking podcast 15

468
00:27:43.381 --> 00:27:46.560
fucking times.
I have no goddamn idea.
You know,

469
00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.490
so I don't know what to tell you people other than this is the end of this

470
00:27:50.491 --> 00:27:52.590
podcast right here.
But even though it is the end,

471
00:27:52.591 --> 00:27:57.591
I'm going to continue to talk for another fucking two minutes and three seconds.

472
00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:02.070
Contractually obligated to do a half hour here.
All right,

473
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:07.680
there you go.
You want to hear a fucking first world problem?

474
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.800
I got bumped up to first class,
right?
And uh,

475
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.010
they sat me in the last row right by the bulkhead,

476
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.770
so my fucking seat didn't recline.
You know,

477
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:19.920
and that ladies and gentlemen is a classic example of cold lotion.

478
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:24.660
Remember called Lotion?
I'm bringing it back.
Cold Lotion.

479
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:29.310
Classic example of fucking Cold Lotion.
If you don't know what it means,

480
00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.780
it's in the urban dictionary.

481
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:35.700
It's basically somebody gives you something nice,
but it fucking sucks.
It's like,

482
00:28:35.701 --> 00:28:38.640
hey,
somebody says,
want to put?
Say,
you know,
your back's all dried out.

483
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.730
Your wife goes,
Hey,
can you put some lotion on your back?
You Go,
absolutely.

484
00:28:41.731 --> 00:28:43.260
She goes,
thank you sweetie.
But you know,

485
00:28:43.261 --> 00:28:46.410
warming up and your hands yet you just slap it right on her back.
She's like,

486
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.770
yeah,
right,
right there as some fucking cold lotion.

487
00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.920
You get bumped up to first class.
You were in the last row.

488
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.430
You seats up against the bulkhead.
See,
you can't fucking lean back.

489
00:28:56.431 --> 00:28:59.040
Cold fucking lotion.
But I'll tell you what I watch.

490
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:05.160
I watched three movies,
two and a half movies.
I watched,
um,

491
00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:09.930
founder starring Michael Keaton about,
uh,

492
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.960
how the whole Mcdonald's franchise came about and it was fantastic movie.

493
00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:17.820
Loved it.
Then I watched the original alien,

494
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:22.500
which totally holds up other than their computers cause what's fucking hilarious

495
00:29:22.501 --> 00:29:25.560
as they're flying through space,
doing shit we still can't do today.

496
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:30.630
But like the computers,
you know,
it looks like from fucking war games.

497
00:29:30.631 --> 00:29:33.860
I don't know.
It's 1979 technology.
MMM.

498
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:38.540
But everything about what movie was fucking awesome and said go any waiver was

499
00:29:38.541 --> 00:29:41.890
fucking bad ass and everybody should have listened to her.
That fucking,

500
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:45.210
I can't say what happens.
You know,
they didn't listen to her.
Um,

501
00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:49.540
she felt she wanted to follow protocol and then I watched the beginning of chips

502
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:54.520
cause I wanted to see,
uh,
I wanted to see the motorcycles.

503
00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.040
You know,
it was a couple Ducati,
so that was cool.

504
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:01.210
And then the plane landed and then that was fucking it.
That was it.

505
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.990
But I saw two good moves.
I didn't watch enough of chips to know.
You know,

506
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.800
all I wanted to see is where Eric is.
Strada was going to be in it,
right?

507
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:13.420
It John Baker,
Larry Wilcox,
you know,
they had to be in there.
Right.

508
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:17.050
I bet the sarge was there.
Baby Grossman.
What about Berry?

509
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:22.050
You know,
you know what they should've done?
They should've put fucking,
uh,

510
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:26.680
what's her face in there?
Uh,
Caitlin Jenner.

511
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.670
Bruce Jenner did a couple of seasons on that fucking thing.

512
00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:31.483
<v 6>Bad.</v>

513
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.160
<v 1>Fuck,
I made it 30 minutes.
There you go.
That's your podcast for this week.</v>

514
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:44.080
I apologize.
I know this one stunk.
I just,
I suck when I'm on.
I'm on a plane.

515
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.900
You know what I mean?
I just,
I don't know what the fuck it is.
I just,
uh,

516
00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:52.330
it just never seems to work out for me.
Uh,

517
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:56.920
several Bardo breathing that dirty air and not being able to recline my seat.

518
00:30:56.921 --> 00:31:00.190
I have no idea.
All right.
That's it.
That's the podcast.
Thank you everybody for,

519
00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:04.460
uh,
for listening.
Enjoy the music.
And now we're going to play some,
uh,

520
00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:08.500
classic Thursday afternoon podcasts just before Friday.

521
00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:13.270
Whatever the fuck I call this thing.
Um,
and joy,
the greatest sets.
All right.

522
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.800
That's it.
Have a great weekend.
You can't,
and uh,

523
00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:18.310
I'll talk to you later.

524
00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.860
<v 7>Do you ever get nostalgic for the 90s?
If so,</v>

525
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:25.570
what part of the night can you have your podcast guy used?

526
00:31:25.571 --> 00:31:28.160
The friends theme song for the Thursday podcast?

527
00:31:28.161 --> 00:31:31.430
That's a question mark or anything awesome from the 90s.

528
00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.253
<v 8>Uh,</v>

529
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:50.183
because

530
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:15.050
<v 9>I don't know,
I have the,
after the cock blocks all been defined,</v>

531
00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.270
like the different kind of cock blocks.

532
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:20.660
I don't know if there's this names thrown,
but I got a new,

533
00:32:20.661 --> 00:32:22.600
I got a new cock block for you.
Uh,
this,

534
00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.300
this cock block is very special in a very obvious one.

535
00:32:26.301 --> 00:32:29.690
And I think like this happens all the time,

536
00:32:29.691 --> 00:32:33.060
but for some reason I've never heard anybody name it.
So I'm gonna,

537
00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.260
I'm gonna kick off the creative process.

538
00:32:36.261 --> 00:32:39.870
I call this guy the announcer that's,
uh,

539
00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.590
<v 10>that's,
that's the name of this cock block.
This is what happened to me.</v>

540
00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:45.050
<v 4>Okay.</v>

541
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:49.430
<v 10>I was,
I did a Gig in Jersey and at the end of the night,</v>

542
00:32:49.431 --> 00:32:53.990
these two girls who waited to be at the back of the line came up and they said,

543
00:32:53.991 --> 00:32:57.170
hey,
you want to go out and get banana pancakes?
You know,

544
00:32:57.171 --> 00:33:00.020
making a reference to my joke saying if I wanted to go out and hang out with

545
00:33:00.021 --> 00:33:04.490
both of them,
right.
And the second day said it,
I was like,

546
00:33:04.491 --> 00:33:08.360
Holy Shit,
he's a fucking,
here's something I'd never had.

547
00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:12.380
Here's a two on one and I can't fucking do it cause I'm with Nia.

548
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:15.860
Whose kid?
Nicco not cause I'm with Nias because everyone's got a cell phone,

549
00:33:15.861 --> 00:33:17.180
fucking camera.
And I get caught.

550
00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:26.630
Honesty.
Um,
no,
I couldn't deal with the guilt,
um,
about,
I got it.

551
00:33:26.631 --> 00:33:28.920
I'll be honest with you.
And I would say this,
if Nia was here,

552
00:33:28.921 --> 00:33:33.210
if two fucking tens came up to me and said,
let's do this.
I,
I,
you know,

553
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.700
yeah,
fuck it.
Let's do it.
I never did it,
you know,
fuck it.

554
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:42.600
So anyways,
so they said,
hey,
you want to get a,

555
00:33:42.601 --> 00:33:45.240
you want to go out and get bananas and pancakes or something like that.

556
00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:50.460
And then this fucking guy like 10 feet array way just goes like,
oh,

557
00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:56.870
you know those guys,
like if a girl just comes up to you,
just like you know,

558
00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.950
you know I've always loved guys and green shirts and your thinking raise your

559
00:34:00.951 --> 00:34:02.990
thinking like holy fuck,
this is going to happen.

560
00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:05.470
There's some other guy like five minutes,
hey

561
00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:11.800
and just makes the whole fire the whole fucking room.
Look over at you.

562
00:34:11.801 --> 00:34:13.450
The fucking announcer

563
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:20.050
fucking cock block mother fucker.
You know who would do that?

564
00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:24.610
If I was standing there and her two girls said to a guy and be like God damn,

565
00:34:24.611 --> 00:34:29.010
it's going down right side of my mouth at lucky motherfucker.
I wouldn't be

566
00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:32.043
<v 4>okay.</v>

567
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:36.780
<v 10>I mean why would you do that?</v>

568
00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:43.380
The fucking announcer.
And if you have a friend like that,
all right,

569
00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.300
the only way you can still hang out with them is if he goes out.

570
00:34:48.301 --> 00:34:50.070
If you guys are going out trying to meet women,

571
00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:55.610
he has to wear one of those old ABC bright yellow Monday night football sport

572
00:34:55.711 --> 00:35:00.330
coats.
And if the girls,
why is he wearing that?
You'll see,

573
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:04.920
you'll see.
And that'll be the,
that would be the funniest fucking thing ever.

574
00:35:04.921 --> 00:35:08.490
Like if somehow if he couldn't figure out the joke and he just thought the coat

575
00:35:08.491 --> 00:35:10.740
look good and just the whole night you just saw him.

576
00:35:10.741 --> 00:35:15.140
Anytime you heard in the,
you know,
10 feet away,

577
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:21.720
hey just look over and you'd see this guy dressed like Howard Cosell and you'd

578
00:35:21.721 --> 00:35:23.940
be like,
oh that's the announcer.
He's the,
he's the,

579
00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:31.500
he's the guy he can cock block from like he's almost like a sniper.

580
00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:35.910
If he wasn't so fucking loud.
He's at the same distance as a fucking marksman,

581
00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:40.770
but he kills it with a,
with loudness.
Oh my God.

582
00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:43.830
Did that guy fucking annoy me?
Hey Mia,
come here.
Come here.

583
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:45.870
She just came in shaking her head.

584
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:50.430
You are what I am beyond the,
come on over here.

585
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.880
I was just telling that story with that Guy Cock block me with those two chicks

586
00:35:53.881 --> 00:35:57.600
out in a Jersey when they would just go cock blocks you.

587
00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.610
I told you this story.
No,

588
00:35:59.611 --> 00:36:02.910
but you're making it seem like you were going to do something.
No,
no.

589
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.470
I wasn't going to do something.
This is the thing,

590
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.340
but I just admitted general cock blocking.
Yeah,
but this is what I did admit.

591
00:36:08.341 --> 00:36:12.060
If they will both tens,
I would've,
I would've,
I would've done it.

592
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.400
I never had a fucking two on one.
And you know something.

593
00:36:14.401 --> 00:36:18.930
Would you be that mad if they were both smoking hot and the cell phone video got

594
00:36:18.931 --> 00:36:23.220
out?
The video is even need to get out when you got the announcer.
Then the guy,

595
00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.940
he just literally goes,
yeah,
we'd have to get banana pancakes with Yoda.

596
00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:27.813
He said something.

597
00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:31.693
<v 11>Okay.
Hmm.</v>

598
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:36.560
<v 10>Nothing.
You're a jerk.
Why am I a jerk?
So pajamas</v>

599
00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.680
you are talking about cock blocking and two on ones.

600
00:36:42.681 --> 00:36:45.410
What kind of podcasts is this turning into?
You know what,

601
00:36:45.411 --> 00:36:49.310
it's turning into a very honest podcast.
I was very honest.
I said,

602
00:36:49.311 --> 00:36:53.120
this is good for you.
This is the thing I said I couldn't,
uh,

603
00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:57.000
I couldn't deal with the guilt.
Yeah.
Unless if they,
if,

604
00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:00.320
unless they were both Ted's,
if they're both fucking tends to give me a break.

605
00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.720
Let me tell you something.
If you hooked up with Brad Pitt,

606
00:37:02.721 --> 00:37:07.690
there's only so mad I could get.
Oh,
it's fucking Brad Pitt.
Okay.
Yeah.

607
00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:11.330
Good to know.
Okay,
well you know what that would if I just,

608
00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.780
if I just said some generic,
yeah,
good looking guy.

609
00:37:14.781 --> 00:37:18.500
If I just said some generic good looking guy and you,
and you just said that,

610
00:37:18.501 --> 00:37:19.310
that would have scared me.

611
00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:21.650
But the way you just acted like you had Brad Pitt's phone number.

612
00:37:21.651 --> 00:37:24.940
That doesn't scare me.
Oh really?
Okay.
It's going down.

613
00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:29.810
What if it's the like the regular guy version of Brad Pitt.
Is that okay?

614
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:33.080
Like he's just as good if you want to go live out on the street and get the fuck

615
00:37:33.081 --> 00:37:36.710
out of this house.
Absolutely.
But you're allowed to have some sort of crazy two.

616
00:37:36.711 --> 00:37:41.180
One one.
Yes.
That's bullshit.
No it isn't.
It is.
If you just,
you know what,

617
00:37:41.181 --> 00:37:45.080
cause you're your thinking on it unlike like a,
a very basic level.

618
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:48.470
But if you really,
but you really think about it,
just think about it.

619
00:37:48.471 --> 00:37:49.860
It makes sense.
Bill.

620
00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:53.810
You're not going to try to mind fuck me and thinking that it's okay for you to

621
00:37:53.811 --> 00:37:56.210
have some sort of two on one and I can,
that's not,
no,

622
00:37:56.211 --> 00:37:59.470
it's not going down like that.
Yeah,
but God,
women are beautiful.
We,

623
00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:03.020
we lost after you a totally makes sense.
You guys find like Dick's or weird.

624
00:38:03.021 --> 00:38:06.140
They're gross.
It's all hanging out there.
It's disgusting.
You don't want that.

625
00:38:06.141 --> 00:38:07.940
You know nothing about you.

626
00:38:07.941 --> 00:38:11.650
You don't want that which has been proven time and time and again and your stand

627
00:38:11.651 --> 00:38:15.380
up and in your podcasts.
But that's a,
that's another discussion.

628
00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:16.560
You know what you,

629
00:38:16.561 --> 00:38:19.490
you just set yourself up like you're going to make some huge point and then you

630
00:38:19.491 --> 00:38:22.160
just tapped out.
You know nothing about women but,
but the,

631
00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:25.940
but that's just another discussion and I just don't want him to get into that.

632
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:31.660
So now what?
You just gave me the face.
What are you doing today?
Lazy.
Huh?

633
00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.860
What do you mean?
Like is he Nini?
Cool brick?
Yeah.

634
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.350
I just filled my short film over the weekend.
Screw you.

635
00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:42.910
I'm working hard while you're in here in your pajamas talking about two on ones.

636
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:46.300
Yeah.
Well I have to do an hour's worth a shit here.
I'm coming up on it.

637
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:51.480
Fill it up with whatever,
an hour and two minutes,
an hour,

638
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:55.940
two minutes.
If you done your,
uh,
your viewer emails yet?
Yeah,

639
00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:00.280
I did listen their emails.
You did that already because you want to chime in?

640
00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.820
I Dunno.
I already did it.
What do you guys already did it?
What about overrated?

641
00:39:03.821 --> 00:39:07.960
Underrated.
Didn't do it.
They didn't have any of this week.
Oh,
okay.
Look at you.

642
00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.410
I think you were a fan of this podcast.
No,
I'm not.

643
00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:18.130
Listen,
it didn't go down.
All right,

644
00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:22.030
but I'm telling you right now,
Nia,
if two tens come up to me,

645
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:27.670
it's going down.
Okay.
All right.
Well,
just be prepared for the retaliation

646
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:35.710
game set match.
Really?
You're going to deny me that?

647
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:40.800
Can I just buy you some stuff?
Wow.
Really?
Yes.

648
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:44.830
Really not some sort of fucking basketball wife that can be placated with

649
00:39:44.831 --> 00:39:49.780
material things to a point.
Yeah,
exactly.
If I'm going to be fucking honest here,

650
00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.500
come on.
This gotta be something that I can buy.
You know something.

651
00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:56.830
This should be our Valentine's Day.
All right.
For the guide,

652
00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:58.270
the Guide Valentine's Day,

653
00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:02.440
this is what Valentine's Day should be every year is the guy gets a two on one

654
00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.060
and then you get some nice stuff.
Well why can't I have a two on one?

655
00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.110
Cause you don't like that.
What do you mean?
What do you know?

656
00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:12.790
Women don't like sex?

657
00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:19.510
You don't find like when you guys fantasize,

658
00:40:19.511 --> 00:40:22.720
you think about the guys in your life.
You don't think about other things.

659
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:29.680
Um,
come on Nia.
Just one.
Just give me one.

660
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.780
You get one and I get one.
No you don't.

661
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:34.870
You don't because you don't want one.

662
00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:38.510
What do you mean you just being childish?
No I'm not.
Yeah,
you are.
You,

663
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:41.530
you say you think you think you want to hook up with,

664
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:46.540
with Jake Gyllenhaal in a bread face,
whatever the fuck his name is,
Brad Pitt.

665
00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:51.580
Brad thread,
face pit.
You just think you do.
See,

666
00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:52.580
you know what to think about me is,

667
00:40:52.581 --> 00:40:54.670
is like you have to hook up with somebody famous.

668
00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:58.420
I'm actually just regular people.
See I'm down to earth with this shit.
See,

669
00:40:58.421 --> 00:41:02.520
that's what I'm saying.
You like stuff you like shiny,
shiny things.
Oh,

670
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.770
this is the deal.
I get a two on one and you,

671
00:41:04.771 --> 00:41:09.771
you get some some cracked up face old man in Vegas like Robert Redford.

672
00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:13.920
Like I used to be good looking when Nixon was in office.
No,

673
00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:15.430
that's not how negotiating works.

674
00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:17.740
Now you've got to come with something else here.
No,

675
00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:21.490
I think we should both get an equal opportunity thing going on.
Yeah,

676
00:41:21.491 --> 00:41:25.600
but this isn't an equal relationship.
Why?
Why is it not an equal relationship?

677
00:41:25.601 --> 00:41:26.530
Cause I wanted to,

678
00:41:26.531 --> 00:41:29.920
I could pin you down to the ground right now and tickle you until you passed out

679
00:41:29.921 --> 00:41:32.860
and there's not a fucking thing you can do about it.
What did that,

680
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:35.680
that has nothing to do with anything.
That's how the world works.
Nia,

681
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:39.120
why do you think America's our top?
Because we're right or because we could,
oh,

682
00:41:39.121 --> 00:41:43.070
because?
Because we can blow you up more times.
Also,
it's your,

683
00:41:43.071 --> 00:41:46.820
your physical presence.
That's what makes it like an unequal relationship.
Yeah.

684
00:41:46.821 --> 00:41:49.940
Cause I can beat you down.
Well,
maybe you're physically stronger,

685
00:41:49.941 --> 00:41:51.110
but I'm mentally stronger than yeah.

686
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:52.390
<v 12>Oh</v>

687
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.400
<v 10>snap.
I'm smarter than you.
Yeah.</v>

688
00:41:55.401 --> 00:41:58.550
So whatever physical power.
Let me ask you this.

689
00:41:58.551 --> 00:42:03.551
What is you have are trumped by my mental fucking Goliath Munis and those suck

690
00:42:03.981 --> 00:42:08.750
on that red.
What do you think?
You're smarter than,

691
00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:12.050
Oh,
that was good though.
You got a good one in and now you're storming off.

692
00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.400
I taught you.
Well,

693
00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.033
<v 8>the,</v>

694
00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:54.410
<v 12>hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burr and this is the Monday morning podcast.</v>

695
00:42:54.411 --> 00:42:57.770
So Monday,
August 31st,

696
00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:01.820
2009 and I am recording this one from Stockholm,
Sweden.
That's right.

697
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.930
I'm a big shot international traveler.
You know,

698
00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:11.720
not bad for some bomber.
Used to work in a warehouse.
Stockholm,
Sweden,
people.

699
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:17.390
Um,
I've been here for a week and uh,
it has been absolutely incredible.

700
00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.770
I'm not going to lie to you.

701
00:43:18.771 --> 00:43:23.480
It's one of the most beautiful cities I've ever been to and has some of the most

702
00:43:23.481 --> 00:43:27.290
beautiful people I've ever seen.
And I'm not gonna lie to you.

703
00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.240
I got to go with a Adolf Hitler on this one.
A,

704
00:43:30.241 --> 00:43:34.310
these are some good looking sons of bitches out here,
you know?
I mean,

705
00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:37.790
I don't think that's an excuse to go out and try to eliminate all the other

706
00:43:37.791 --> 00:43:42.380
races of people.
He took it a little far,

707
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:46.130
but I can definitely see what he was enamored with.
Like,

708
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.100
I'm not even kidding you like,
like these are some of the most,

709
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:51.230
even like the guys,

710
00:43:51.231 --> 00:43:54.350
like I was walking down the street with my girl and go look at that fucking guy.

711
00:43:54.351 --> 00:43:55.700
Would you look at them?

712
00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:57.110
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

713
00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:01.610
<v 12>How was that guy?
Not Famous?
Sekai would be Brad Pitt and our country.</v>

714
00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:05.970
Look at them.
Even that old people are good looking.
You know what?

715
00:44:05.971 --> 00:44:09.740
All the younger dudes,
they all look like a,
um,

716
00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.430
who's that fucking dude with the,

717
00:44:11.431 --> 00:44:15.030
with the Paul Mccartney haircut that all the girls are screaming about.

718
00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:20.490
She's got those Jim Breuer eyes,
you know,
those glassy eyes.

719
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:24.480
And he's got to fuck.
And a Paul Mccartney Haircut,

720
00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:28.650
I think it was in one of those high school musical,
I dunno,

721
00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:33.330
they all fucking look like that except it's blonde and uh,

722
00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:38.130
and I don't know.
And then,
then the older guys,
they all look like fucking,
uh,

723
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:42.990
like the bad guy in,
in a Mel Gibson 1980s movie,
you know,

724
00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:47.490
something like that.
And then the women are just absolutely fucking ridiculous.

725
00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:49.900
I saw this girl,
uh,
like,
I haven't even,
you know,
you,

726
00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.540
when you walked down the street with your girlfriend,

727
00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:56.010
you try to like subtly look at women.
I was not doing that,

728
00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.510
had absolutely no respect for,
I was just going,
Jesus Christ.

729
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.020
And then she,
she wouldn't even punch me if it was in the state.

730
00:45:04.021 --> 00:45:07.950
She would fucking punch me.
But here she was just like,
was,
was that a VJ?

731
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:12.330
You know,
it was that,
uh,
you know,
they're just fucking gorgeous.

732
00:45:12.331 --> 00:45:15.100
And I'm sitting there and I've never felt like I had a,

733
00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:20.610
that I was compromised genetically until I came to Stockholm,
Sweden,

734
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.140
and I was really starting to get a complex.

735
00:45:25.141 --> 00:45:30.050
But yesterday I took the subway or the,
the on the ground as they call it.

736
00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:34.050
Do you want to find the on the ground?
Uh,
they don't talk like that,

737
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.750
but that's my hacky foreign accent.
Um,

738
00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:42.300
and I took the subway out of Stockholm,
Sweden,
and I went to some of the,
like,

739
00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.740
it was almost like I got on the train and I went up to the Bronx.

740
00:45:44.741 --> 00:45:45.870
So like out to Queens.

741
00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:50.760
And that's evidently where they keep all their ugly people and a,

742
00:45:50.761 --> 00:45:55.020
yeah.
All of a sudden I felt like I was in revere,
you know,

743
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:58.590
or Medford.
So there's definitely some,

744
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:01.320
there's definitely some struggling people here.
You know what,

745
00:46:01.321 --> 00:46:02.670
you know what it looks like.
Like all this.

746
00:46:02.671 --> 00:46:07.350
Stockholm looks like Soho in New York where everyone's really trendy,

747
00:46:07.351 --> 00:46:11.820
really fashionably dressed and just fucking ridiculously good looking.

748
00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:15.860
And,
uh,
you know,
like I said,
I've never felt like,
uh,

749
00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.870
I've never felt like I should be sleeping under a bridge before,

750
00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.530
until I came out here.
But anyways,

751
00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:28.350
so with that,
I had one show this weekend,
um,

752
00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:32.730
on the 29th,
I was working the,
uh,
I dunno,

753
00:46:32.731 --> 00:46:35.160
some fucking theater,
I forget the name of it,
but,
uh,

754
00:46:35.161 --> 00:46:38.640
I was all nervous because everybody over here,
even though they're bilingual,

755
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:44.340
you know,
they,
they fractions fashion,
fashion when they're walking around,
right?

756
00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:48.280
So the comedians going on in front of me are all up there going out on a

757
00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:51.630
[inaudible].
Right.
And I'm fucking sitting back there going,

758
00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:55.170
I don't think these people are going to get what the fuck I'm talking about.

759
00:46:55.171 --> 00:46:59.730
So fortunately I was smart and I,
uh,

760
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.990
I went up the night before my,
my theater Gig is what I did.

761
00:47:03.991 --> 00:47:06.720
I went up the night before and I kind of got all that,

762
00:47:06.721 --> 00:47:11.670
like nervousness out and I was able to figure out just a couple of things to

763
00:47:11.671 --> 00:47:15.090
switch up.
Like,
I made a reference to kickball.

764
00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:17.070
If you guys saw my tonight show set,

765
00:47:17.071 --> 00:47:20.400
I did where I talk about the bankers striking out playing kickball.

766
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:23.850
They don't know kickball over here.
So one of the other,
uh,

767
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:27.570
comedians told me switch it to soccer.
I said okay.

768
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:31.930
And just little adjustments like that.
So I kind of had an okay set,

769
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:36.370
um,
Thursday,
but I was really on my fucking heels.

770
00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:40.000
I really felt like a freak.
Um,

771
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:44.860
but then Friday came along and um,
I dunno,
it was,

772
00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:49.750
the theater wasn't packed.
It was sort of like maybe like half full.

773
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:54.990
So I have this weird psychological thing where if a room is in full,

774
00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:58.510
I don't feel nervous,
but if it's full,
I feel nervous.

775
00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.490
And it has nothing to do with numbers.

776
00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:05.530
If you had a room that only held like 40 people and there was 40 people in

777
00:48:05.531 --> 00:48:10.180
there,
I would feel a pressure to kill.
But if you stuck me in a theater,

778
00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.860
that health,
like,
you know,

779
00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:15.850
700 people and there was only 400 people there,

780
00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.980
I would feel like I was in this little ass crowd.

781
00:48:17.981 --> 00:48:19.330
So that's basically what happened.

782
00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:23.780
And I went out and I had a great time to steroid,

783
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.440
got a standing ovation in the end.
And I was,

784
00:48:26.441 --> 00:48:30.580
I can't even tell you how fucking relieved I was because,
you know,

785
00:48:30.581 --> 00:48:34.780
it took me 16 hours to get here from La.
So you really don't want to bomb.

786
00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:36.760
And,
um,

787
00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:41.970
one of the goals of coming over here was to fucking destroy so that I can start

788
00:48:42.641 --> 00:48:47.110
build building like a following over here because you know,

789
00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:47.980
like most people,

790
00:48:47.981 --> 00:48:51.760
I've always wanted to come to Europe and see all this stuff over here,

791
00:48:51.761 --> 00:48:55.180
but it be even better if I could come over and make a little bit of money.

792
00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:59.440
So that's Kinda my goal,
you know,
going to start,
you know,

793
00:48:59.441 --> 00:49:01.690
getting a following over here and I'll fly over here,

794
00:49:01.691 --> 00:49:05.940
I'll make some kronas here in Sweden and then I'll go fucking blow,

795
00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:10.900
blow it all in Italy are fucking,
uh,
Paris Assam Shit.

796
00:49:10.901 --> 00:49:15.880
Why the fuck not right?
Come over here and drink like Ernest Hemingway.

797
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:20.920
Act like I'm an actual fucking artist rather than someone who curses every other

798
00:49:20.921 --> 00:49:24.100
a word.
But,
um,
so this is the funny part,
right?

799
00:49:24.101 --> 00:49:28.360
So I killed and everything was great and I felt fantastic.

800
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:31.930
And then the next night,
you know,
they go,
well,
hey,
you know,

801
00:49:31.931 --> 00:49:34.330
we're having this comedy festival,
there's this big theater show.

802
00:49:34.331 --> 00:49:38.290
It's going to be sold out even more people who came out to your show.

803
00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:40.870
Do you want to do it?
And I said,
yeah,
fuck it.

804
00:49:40.871 --> 00:49:42.600
I'll do it because I'll get in front of more people.

805
00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:46.540
Maybe they'll come to my show.
And uh,
like a fucking

806
00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.310
typical comic.
I couldn't just leave.
I couldn't leave on a high note.

807
00:49:51.311 --> 00:49:54.250
I had to go for one more and I went up and a,

808
00:49:54.251 --> 00:49:59.251
I only did okay Saturday night I came out a little too cocky and,

809
00:50:00.041 --> 00:50:03.850
um,
I think I kinda came off like an ass.
I didn't suck,

810
00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.790
but it wasn't great.
But,
um,

811
00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:10.870
I know it wasn't great because when I got off one of the people was like,

812
00:50:10.871 --> 00:50:12.280
how did you feel about that?

813
00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:17.860
That's fine as long,
you know,

814
00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:23.230
it could have been better when they don't say great job.
When somebody says,

815
00:50:23.231 --> 00:50:27.540
how did you feel about that?
Um,
I dunno,

816
00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.680
I'm probably making a bigger deal out of it then it was,
but uh,
but anyways,

817
00:50:30.681 --> 00:50:31.380
it was a,

818
00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:35.090
it was a big success over here and I really miss my dog and I'm ready to go
back.

819
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.870
I got one more day over here today and um,

820
00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:44.480
I actually went to a museum yesterday and they have this,
this uh,

821
00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:50.410
I can't explain what the fuck it is basically in the 16 hundreds.

822
00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.140
It's kind of a funny story.
The,
uh,

823
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:58.710
the king over here commissioned this big battle ship to be built and it actually

824
00:50:58.901 --> 00:51:02.800
had two gun decks,
I think back in the day.
They only usually had one,

825
00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:06.480
but they built two gun decks.
Literally.
I like fucking,

826
00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:09.460
I counted when I went to look at it like they had like,

827
00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:13.690
like 20 some odd cannons on both sides.
It was absolutely huge.

828
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:18.260
The carvings and the woodworking in the back of the ship and you know,
like the,

829
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:21.520
the little windows where you open up,
where you stick to the cannons out.

830
00:51:21.521 --> 00:51:25.980
They had like these,
these,
uh,
lions' heads carved in.
I know.

831
00:51:25.981 --> 00:51:28.600
I guess it was something else to intimidate the enemy.

832
00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.600
Like the fucking Canon's weren't enough,
you know?

833
00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:32.963
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

834
00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:35.940
<v 12>I thought the 20 canons were bad dude,
but they got a fucking,</v>

835
00:51:35.941 --> 00:51:40.530
they got a fake lion head and it doesn't look happy,
you know?
So anyways,

836
00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:43.770
so they commission have this ship built so they build the fucking thing.

837
00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:47.880
Everybody piles on the God damn thing.
They got the guns out and all this shit.

838
00:51:47.881 --> 00:51:48.714
You know.

839
00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:50.060
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

840
00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:53.110
<v 12>if I can go out there in the bay,</v>

841
00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:55.930
<v 10>it's like a couple thousand people watch</v>

842
00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:02.500
and fucking sec
and I even got to use it.

843
00:52:02.501 --> 00:52:06.130
It'd be like if you bought a brand new car and something,
you know,
you come home,

844
00:52:06.131 --> 00:52:08.990
do it once it got,
I've got three 51 queen,

845
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.120
we don't fucking do a burnout and he just fucking with like eight miles on the

846
00:52:13.121 --> 00:52:13.740
car.
Right.

847
00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:17.010
<v 12>You wrap it around a pole and not only do you wrap it around a pole,</v>

848
00:52:17.011 --> 00:52:21.210
all your friends fucking watch.
And even though they're your friends,
you know,

849
00:52:21.211 --> 00:52:24.660
they're fucking secretly happy because they can't be happy for you because you

850
00:52:24.661 --> 00:52:26.850
have a better car.
Which means you're going to get better pussy.

851
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:29.220
So it's just in their DNA,
right?

852
00:52:29.221 --> 00:52:34.221
So they fucking take this boat out there and they say a squall came.

853
00:52:34.441 --> 00:52:37.770
I didn't look up to see what a squall was.
Is that some sort of a storm?

854
00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:41.970
Is it a gust of wind?
I know it isn't a rogue wave.

855
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:45.270
That's one of the worst lines ever in a movie.

856
00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:47.040
Did you guys ever see perfect storm?

857
00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:51.780
A rogue wave evidently is like this mini tidal wave that just comes out of

858
00:52:51.781 --> 00:52:56.520
fucking nowhere in a lot of times it washes people off the boat.
So,

859
00:52:56.580 --> 00:53:01.440
um,
most people,
you know,
they're not out to see like me.

860
00:53:01.441 --> 00:53:03.240
So you have no idea what the fuck it was.

861
00:53:03.241 --> 00:53:05.820
So if you just showed a rogue wave in a movie,

862
00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:09.780
if the seas were kind of calm and all of a sudden this big wave out of fucking

863
00:53:09.781 --> 00:53:13.780
nowhere,
just washed a couple people overboard,
you,

864
00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:16.470
you would have been like me sitting in the movie theater going,

865
00:53:16.471 --> 00:53:17.610
what the fuck was that?

866
00:53:17.611 --> 00:53:22.611
So they literally had to have mark Wahlberg's character's scream out rogue wave

867
00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:26.880
as it comes in.
Do you remember who would yell that out?

868
00:53:28.930 --> 00:53:32.750
You know,
what'd you yell get,
you know,
get down or whatever the fuck you'd use.

869
00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:39.430
Udl.
Fuck Dude.
That's what you'd yell.
You wouldn't yell.

870
00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:44.570
Like if someone pulled a gun on you and,
and started shooting at you,
you,

871
00:53:44.571 --> 00:53:48.860
you'd be screaming,
running down the alley.
You wouldn't be like,

872
00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:51.320
you know,
38 special.

873
00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:58.610
Anyways,
let me fucking,
let me,
let me plow ahead here.
All right,

874
00:53:58.611 --> 00:54:01.270
so they send this ship out.
Everybody's standing on the shore.

875
00:54:01.271 --> 00:54:05.330
Is everybody's all proud?
Oh yeah.
Look at this sizes they bought.

876
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:08.360
Look at Zions head.
Yeah,
right.

877
00:54:08.361 --> 00:54:12.090
And the fucking thing is some sort of squall hits it then it,

878
00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:12.891
I don't know what happened.

879
00:54:12.891 --> 00:54:17.891
It started to right itself and then another one hit it and it just fucking went

880
00:54:18.291 --> 00:54:22.010
down.
And when you got two decks of guns,
you go down quick,

881
00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:26.390
like 50 people fucking drowned.
It was just a nightmare.

882
00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:29.090
And evidently they had some sort of stones at the bottom of the boat,

883
00:54:29.091 --> 00:54:32.120
but they didn't have enough.
I think that's to make it sort of sit in the water.

884
00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:35.720
You know,
when it really came across,
it Kinda came across like a,

885
00:54:35.721 --> 00:54:36.770
what Chrysler said,

886
00:54:36.771 --> 00:54:41.150
this is Zucchini Samurai was where it said it tipped over like two miles an hour

887
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:44.570
because of its center of gravity,
which evidently was a total fucking lie.

888
00:54:44.571 --> 00:54:46.100
They just wanted to sell more jeeps.

889
00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:48.440
But I think that that's basically what happened.

890
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:53.210
They built this big grand fucking boat and uh,

891
00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:55.640
oh yeah,
they had,
they had trials trying to figure it out.

892
00:54:55.641 --> 00:54:58.600
Everybody was blaming each person.
But anyway,
so the,

893
00:54:58.601 --> 00:55:02.480
if motherfuckers sinks to the bottom of the bay and over time people kind of

894
00:55:02.481 --> 00:55:06.500
forgot where the fuck it was.
And um,

895
00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:11.220
it stayed down there for 333 years before they brought it.

896
00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.051
Somebody found it,

897
00:55:12.051 --> 00:55:14.990
they brought it back up and it was in pristine fucking condition.

898
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:19.490
Jesus is a long way to go.
And me and my girl went to the museum and we saw it.

899
00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:19.971
I'm going to tell you,

900
00:55:19.971 --> 00:55:22.130
it's one of the most amazing fucking things I've ever seen,

901
00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:27.110
which is funny because if you tell anybody in Sweden that you're going to go see

902
00:55:27.111 --> 00:55:30.170
it,
they just laugh at you because I guess his kids,

903
00:55:30.171 --> 00:55:33.080
they always get dragged there and they have to do book reports on it and they

904
00:55:33.081 --> 00:55:36.740
fucking hate the thing.
It's the typical thing.
Think about where you live.

905
00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:38.840
Think about what the tourist attractions are.

906
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:42.200
You never go to the tourist attractions in your own town.
Okay?

907
00:55:42.201 --> 00:55:45.710
There's just something in human beings DNA where you're like,
dude,

908
00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:49.670
I'm not standing in line in my own fucking town.
You know?

909
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:51.830
It's like when I lived in New York,

910
00:55:51.831 --> 00:55:55.450
I never went to the statue of Liberty or the empire state building and let,

911
00:55:55.451 --> 00:55:59.570
some friend of mine came to town and they want it to go and I hated every second

912
00:55:59.571 --> 00:56:04.190
of it.
You know,
that's basically the deal.
But if you ever go to Stockholm,

913
00:56:04.191 --> 00:56:08.090
Sweden,
I'm telling you,
you have to go.
You've got to go.

914
00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:11.750
You know,
you gotta go check it out if you're into that type of shit.
It was,

915
00:56:11.810 --> 00:56:14.420
it was unbelievable.
I don't read a lot of this stuff either.

916
00:56:14.421 --> 00:56:16.850
I was getting like sleepy when I start reading the plaques.

917
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:21.020
I just like looking at the shit and the little fucking boots that they have.

918
00:56:21.021 --> 00:56:23.650
People were so small back then,
you know,

919
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:27.040
I always wondered if I could go back in time,
like the size I am,

920
00:56:27.041 --> 00:56:30.340
if I would be like the toughest guy in town,
you know,

921
00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:31.661
especially if you've mentioned,

922
00:56:31.661 --> 00:56:35.440
if you took like Jujitsu classes and all the latest fucking fighting styles,

923
00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:38.770
what a God damn bad ass you are.
You'd be,
you know,

924
00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.780
now wait a minute.
They had like those fucking spiky

925
00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:47.670
balls that were at the end of the chains.
All right.

926
00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:51.300
Do I sound dumb enough to make this an official fucking podcast?
All right,

927
00:56:51.301 --> 00:56:53.460
let's get on with the podcast.
Um,
Oh,
before I do,

928
00:56:53.461 --> 00:56:56.730
I just want to thank everybody who came out to my,
uh,
to my show at,

929
00:56:56.731 --> 00:56:59.720
at rival rival the however the fuck you said.
Um,

930
00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:04.380
I had a great time and it was an absolute thrill to go onto the other side of

931
00:57:04.381 --> 00:57:08.010
the planet and actually have people know who the fuck I was.

932
00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:11.430
I even brought up my dog and somebody in the crowd yelled out,
Cleo.

933
00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:14.820
There was actually people who,
uh,
listen to the podcast,

934
00:57:14.821 --> 00:57:19.530
which was really awesome and fucking scary all at the same time.
I was like,
yeah,

935
00:57:19.531 --> 00:57:24.060
I've got a dog recently and somebody yelled out,
cleo.
I was like,
yeah,

936
00:57:24.061 --> 00:57:28.130
it was really,
uh,
you know,
your papers please.
Yeah.
You know,

937
00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:31.600
<v 10>there was that and somebody else was like,
what is that to do out here?</v>

938
00:57:31.601 --> 00:57:35.410
What should I be doing out here?
And somebody in the crowd fucking yelled out,

939
00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:37.770
<v 12>come to my house,
we'll have a party.</v>

940
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:45.240
<v 10>I'm not even exaggerating.
That's what it fucking sounded like.</v>

941
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:49.200
And I wanted to record that guy in my cell phone and have that as my outgoing

942
00:57:49.201 --> 00:57:54.150
message that if you called me and it went directly to my,
my outgoing message,

943
00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:57.600
that's what would come up rather than,
hey,
this is bill.
Uh,
you know,

944
00:57:57.601 --> 00:58:01.890
leave a message.
You can't,
you know,
it was actually,
it would be him just going

945
00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:06.710
<v 12>come to my house.
They'll have a party.
Ooh.
All right,</v>

946
00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:07.640
let's plow ahead here.
Oh,

947
00:58:07.641 --> 00:58:10.470
somebody actually informed me that last week was the first time,
uh,

948
00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:12.110
in the history of my podcast,

949
00:58:12.111 --> 00:58:14.840
I did an entire podcast without using the word content.

950
00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:17.043
<v 13>MMM.</v>

951
00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:20.000
<v 12>I don't know what that says about that person,
but a,</v>

952
00:58:20.001 --> 00:58:24.680
they're definitely into the podcast.
Okay.
Um,
let's move on here.

953
00:58:24.681 --> 00:58:27.200
Getting on with the podcast.
Uh,
this is,

954
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:30.410
somebody sent me a really good email about last week when I was,

955
00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.250
I was going off on how,
um,

956
00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:36.830
somebody had made fun of Ringo Starr and said something to the effect of,

957
00:58:36.831 --> 00:58:37.610
you know,

958
00:58:37.610 --> 00:58:41.290
cause Ringo said that he wasn't going to be signing anymore anything anymore

959
00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:46.010
after like October.
Basically after 50 years of signing autograph,

960
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:50.210
that guys approaching 70 years of age,
his wrist is going to fall off.

961
00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:54.500
He's probably going to die within the next decade.
Right.
That's still a good run.

962
00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:58.520
He wants to go do some shit.
So,
of course,

963
00:58:58.521 --> 00:59:01.520
all the fans get pissed and someone's like,
you know,
without us,

964
00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:06.740
he wouldn't be famous.
And I was saying that that was really a,

965
00:59:06.741 --> 00:59:08.000
a,
an arrogant.

966
00:59:08.810 --> 00:59:11.410
Did somebody just knock on the fucking wall telling me to shut up on?

967
00:59:11.411 --> 00:59:15.530
He's yelling.
Yeah.
Um,
I'll go fuck yourself.
I'm just doing a podcast.

968
00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:17.270
Um,
anyways,

969
00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:22.190
<v 10>so I thought that that was just an arrogant statement.
It's like,
like the fans,</v>

970
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:25.220
<v 9>like if it wasn't for the fans,
he wouldn't be famous.</v>

971
00:59:25.221 --> 00:59:28.670
It's like you totally discounting demands talent.

972
00:59:28.671 --> 00:59:31.280
He's considered one of the greatest drummers of all time.

973
00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:36.140
He inspired an entire generation to play drums.
Um,

974
00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.280
I dunno.
So anyway,

975
00:59:37.281 --> 00:59:40.280
I can't really even explain my point of view because so much so many in my point

976
00:59:40.281 --> 00:59:43.160
of views are just spur spur of the moment,
you know.
So anyways,

977
00:59:43.161 --> 00:59:46.220
the guy writes 'em on your last podcast,

978
00:59:46.221 --> 00:59:49.820
you were talking about how the fans don't make someone who they are the fans.

979
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:53.390
And this guy says,
the fans don't make someone talented.
You're right about that.

980
00:59:53.391 --> 00:59:57.320
But without the fans,
all the talent in the world doesn't mean Shit.

981
00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:01.370
How many talented performers have faded away because they failed to find an

982
01:00:01.371 --> 01:00:02.204
audience.

983
01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:06.470
How many know talent ha hacks are making a living in entertainment in the

984
01:00:06.471 --> 01:00:10.520
entertainment industry just because they somehow managed to get a bunch of

985
01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:14.780
mindless fucktard's to buy their crap.
Um,

986
01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:17.460
uh,
yeah,
I mean,
you know,
some,

987
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:20.150
I understand what you say in there and he brings up this,

988
01:00:20.151 --> 01:00:24.920
this great point of how,
uh,
that that show carnival or Carney val,
however,
the,

989
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:27.920
however the hell you said it was on HBO and he said to this day,

990
01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:31.760
it's probably the second best show they've ever had behind the wire,

991
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:36.170
but they canceled the show up to two seasons claiming that the DVD sales weren't

992
01:00:36.171 --> 01:00:41.171
sufficient to justify the amount of money they were spending on making the show.

993
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:42.321
Um,

994
01:00:42.321 --> 01:00:46.300
yet still shit like 24 which is retelling the same fucking story every goddamn

995
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.900
years in its eighth season.

996
01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:52.550
Just being talented isn't what keeps entertainers employed.
The fans do.

997
01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:56.990
Okay.
Now that's actually,
that's kind of a different argument.

998
01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:03.140
Okay.
I was saying that fans are not the reason Ringo Starr is famous.

999
01:01:03.141 --> 01:01:08.141
If you wanted to say like if it wasn't for the songwriting ability of Paul

1000
01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:14.000
Mccartney and John Lennon,
Ringo Starr might've ended up washing dishes.

1001
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:19.100
I would go with that.
I would definitely go with that.

1002
01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:23.900
All right.
And I can definitely see that aspect of it.

1003
01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:28.790
But to sit there and,
and like put it this way,
if it wasn't for ACDC,

1004
01:01:28.791 --> 01:01:32.630
I wouldn't have had a life in my teenage years.
Okay.

1005
01:01:32.631 --> 01:01:37.631
And at no or no level do I feel like Angus and Malcolm should thank me for back

1006
01:01:40.311 --> 01:01:44.900
in black for the success of back in black.
They made a fucking killer album,

1007
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:46.633
you know,

1008
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000
and they worked their asses off on it and it was so fucking good.

1009
01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:55.730
My ears couldn't ignore it.
All right.
I'm not part,

1010
01:01:55.731 --> 01:01:58.310
I wasn't part of this group of people who sat there and said,

1011
01:01:58.311 --> 01:01:59.720
you know what we're gonna do today?

1012
01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:03.140
We're going to make ACDC famous and God damn it,

1013
01:02:03.141 --> 01:02:07.010
those sons of bitches better appreciate us because if it isn't,
well,

1014
01:02:07.011 --> 01:02:10.790
if it wasn't for us,
the back in black album would suck.

1015
01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:14.630
I guess if we didn't buy it,
it w would,
it disappeared into obscurity.

1016
01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:19.631
But like I just give ACDC more credit because they're an organized

1017
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:25.280
<v 12>group of people creating something and I'm just a fucking jackass walking</v>

1018
01:02:25.891 --> 01:02:30.650
around.
I don't know.
I don't look at it that way,
but I definitely see,
yeah,

1019
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:34.360
if people don't listen to your shit,
um,

1020
01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:39.480
then you don't sell any of it then,
then yeah,
your career is over.
Absolutely.

1021
01:02:39.481 --> 01:02:44.481
But I don't feel that buying the shit is in the control of the fans.

1022
01:02:45.481 --> 01:02:50.130
I think the artists make something so great.
You have to buy it,
you know?

1023
01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:52.770
And as far as like a TV show,

1024
01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:57.390
I hate this expression because I don't hunt,
but I'm going to use it anyways.

1025
01:02:57.750 --> 01:03:02.040
As far as the TV show goes,
that's an entirely different animal,
man.

1026
01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:04.440
I hate when people say that,
but it kind of fits here.

1027
01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:09.390
A TV show is different because what you're doing there is you're,

1028
01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:14.060
you're trying to go like you're commercially fishing.
You don't give a fuck you,

1029
01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:16.950
you're trying to grab as many people as you can

1030
01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.160
as opposed to just doing what you do.

1031
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.990
I can't explain it.

1032
01:03:23.991 --> 01:03:27.500
Having a TV show goes beyond doing what you do and if they like,
you know,

1033
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:30.110
build it,
they will come.
It goes beyond that

1034
01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:36.420
because you know,
just because they weren't selling enough DVDs,
that's,

1035
01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:41.260
is that really a fan thing or is that the [inaudible] in the industry who have

1036
01:03:41.261 --> 01:03:45.610
this,
this corporate mentality where every quarter they have to make more money.

1037
01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:47.643
You know what I mean?

1038
01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:52.090
So it causes them to do things after only two seasons.

1039
01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:55.600
I mean,
I don't know.
I'm not trying to belittle people who are fans.

1040
01:03:55.601 --> 01:03:59.580
I don't think that artists should take their fans for granted,
but I don't,

1041
01:03:59.581 --> 01:04:02.020
I don't feel as a fan of all the people I'm a fan of.

1042
01:04:02.021 --> 01:04:05.110
I don't feel like they owe their success to make.

1043
01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:08.410
And if they don't want to sign something,
I'm fine with that.

1044
01:04:09.490 --> 01:04:13.510
Does that make me fucking weird?
I don't think Ringo Star's 70 fucking years old.

1045
01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:15.340
What?
What the what?
What more is he going to?

1046
01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:19.510
How many more pairs of Ted's connect I sign.
All right.

1047
01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:22.600
It's probably got diarrhea every other Thursday.
I mean,

1048
01:04:22.601 --> 01:04:27.430
can the guy fucking live his life?
I Dunno.
All right.
Let's,
uh,
let's,

1049
01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:32.530
let's move on here.
All right.
You know what I mean?
Like,
I just went to Stockholm,

1050
01:04:32.531 --> 01:04:35.320
Sweden.
I just said,
thanks Dan.
For all the fans who came out,

1051
01:04:35.321 --> 01:04:38.140
I don't take them for granted.
You know,

1052
01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:42.190
when I was fucking kissing babies and shaking hands at the end of my show,

1053
01:04:42.191 --> 01:04:44.170
but I got to admit,
if I'm coming over here,
it's 70.

1054
01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:47.080
I want to be wheeled back to my hotel and drink some tea.

1055
01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.050
And that wouldn't mean that I'm taking them for granted.

1056
01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:55.210
It just means I'm fucking old and I'm tired.

1057
01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.330
Do you know how many autographs Rinko is?
Probably,
you know,

1058
01:04:59.331 --> 01:05:02.480
I've already been through this.
He gets no credit.
50 years of autographs.

1059
01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:06.140
It's not enough.
And then people are going to take credit for his success.

1060
01:05:06.141 --> 01:05:08.330
I just thought that that was a little lot of life.
All right.

1061
01:05:08.331 --> 01:05:11.840
That's all I'm fucking trying to say there.
You know?
And like I said,

1062
01:05:11.841 --> 01:05:14.190
having said that,
I will be kissing babies and sell it,

1063
01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:19.200
signing DVDs and taking pictures with awful fucking digital cameras that for

1064
01:05:19.331 --> 01:05:22.900
some reason take like you just don't shoot.
You know,

1065
01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:25.930
you got to hold the button down for like 19 minutes and,
and you to,

1066
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:30.370
is it the 18th flash or the 19th flash where I can finally stop smiling.

1067
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.780
Um,
alright.
Plowing ahead.
Uh,
Bill.
Uh,

1068
01:05:34.781 --> 01:05:38.200
so something kind of ridiculous happened to me the other day and you're the only

1069
01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:41.290
person who I think might appreciate my point of view on the matter.
Okay.

1070
01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:45.060
So this is really good looking lady,
uh,

1071
01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:48.100
that works at the sandwich shop around the corner from my job.

1072
01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:51.460
So I've been going there for like a year now and I've always wanted to say

1073
01:05:51.461 --> 01:05:52.091
something to her,

1074
01:05:52.091 --> 01:05:55.300
but it never did because either the place was too busy at the time or I just

1075
01:05:55.301 --> 01:05:57.280
pushed it out,
usually the latter.

1076
01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.210
So the other day I finally man up and decide to say something and it went a

1077
01:06:01.211 --> 01:06:05.560
little something like this.
Uh,
I go in after two,
so it's not as busy.

1078
01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:09.910
I placed my order,
she makes me a wrap.
She hands me a wrap and I say,

1079
01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:12.460
excuse me.
Uh,

1080
01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:16.180
I've been coming in here for a while and I've always wanted to introduce myself

1081
01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:21.490
and before I can even get the words out,
her smiling expression turns blank.

1082
01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:25.930
Her lips seal tight and she kind of looks up at her eyebrows with that.

1083
01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:29.680
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
Look all over face.

1084
01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:34.490
I can only equate a shit.
I just hit the wrong button on my computer.
Um,

1085
01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:38.950
he goes,
I can only equate the look to an a to an employee,

1086
01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:42.910
what an employee you might have when they're done with their work for the week

1087
01:06:42.911 --> 01:06:45.670
and on Friday evening,
right as they feel like they're going to get out of there,

1088
01:06:45.671 --> 01:06:49.390
the boss comes and drops another hour's worth of paperwork on their desk.

1089
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:53.380
They can't say anything,
but you know the thinking,
you fucking prick.

1090
01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:57.100
So what I ended up saying after I get this look from this chick is this is

1091
01:06:57.101 --> 01:06:59.260
basically what the guy says.
He said,
excuse me,

1092
01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:02.920
I've been coming in here for a while and I've always wanted to introduce myself.

1093
01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:05.530
You know what?
Fuck it.
Never mind.

1094
01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:10.350
<v 14>Okay.</v>

1095
01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:15.290
<v 12>And he goes,
I turned around and I just walked out.
All right?</v>

1096
01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:19.220
And he goes,
now,
here's my issue,
dude.
We've all been there.
All right,

1097
01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:24.020
we've all fucking been there.
Um,
all right.
So he goes,
now here's my issue.

1098
01:07:24.021 --> 01:07:27.480
It's not that I was rejected.
Big Deal.
That shit happens all the time,
right?
Uh,

1099
01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:30.740
that's like an ongoing theme in an adult life and I've learned to live with it.

1100
01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:35.010
Jesus,
dude,
don't jump off a cliff here.
Um,
he goes,
my problem is that sets,

1101
01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:38.570
this says as a society,
I can't even talk to a society that,

1102
01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:42.530
but my problem is society dictates that the guy should approach the girl and all

1103
01:07:42.531 --> 01:07:44.450
the girls really needs to do is look pretty,

1104
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:48.170
throw a few signals and wait for dudes to start clamoring like morons.

1105
01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:51.770
Is it fair?
No.
But then again,
it's really not a big deal.

1106
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:53.930
It's one of the situations you grow accustomed to.

1107
01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:59.150
But if that is the case and if all women have to do is be pretty,

1108
01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:02.330
then say yes or go fuck yourself.

1109
01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:07.610
Could they at least wait 30 seconds for me to say whatever retarded shit,

1110
01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:10.760
whatever retarded shit I'm thinking before they shoot me down.

1111
01:08:11.030 --> 01:08:13.550
All she has to do is wait a minute and say,
no thank you.

1112
01:08:13.551 --> 01:08:16.820
But instead I get cut off by Stinkeye mid sentence.

1113
01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:18.800
Should I have told her to go fuck herself?

1114
01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:23.330
What are your thoughts on this sort of shit?
Your true and loyal fan?
Bobo.

1115
01:08:23.331 --> 01:08:27.140
The douchebag.
Alright.
Um,

1116
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:31.580
what am I failings on this?
All right.
First of all,
dude,
we've all been there.

1117
01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.550
We've all,
you know,
you got in your head,

1118
01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:37.820
you're going to come up there like fucking Sean Connery and one of those early

1119
01:08:37.821 --> 01:08:41.330
James Bond's even feel like you got to fucking Tuxedo on.

1120
01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:43.010
And then the second you open your mouth,

1121
01:08:43.011 --> 01:08:47.330
you sound like fucking Arnold Horshack and you even want to shoot yourself down

1122
01:08:47.331 --> 01:08:51.110
at that point.
Okay?
Um,
but to answer your question,

1123
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:55.490
should I have told her to go fuck herself?
No,
that's not.

1124
01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:00.740
I mean I'm,
I'm just,
you know,
having not been there,
I,

1125
01:09:00.741 --> 01:09:02.870
I can't,
it'd be,

1126
01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:07.160
it would depend on what the look on her face was or how she looked.

1127
01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:09.410
You know,
if,
uh,

1128
01:09:09.830 --> 01:09:13.460
if she was just some hot girl who didn't have a brain in our head,
yeah.

1129
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:14.810
Then you tell her to go fuck herself.

1130
01:09:14.811 --> 01:09:18.230
But this is a really cute girl and you actually feel like,
wow,
I,
you know,

1131
01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:21.740
I'd like to get to know that girl.
No,
you don't tell her to go fuck herself.

1132
01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:25.310
It's actually in that moment when she gives you the stink eye is when you have

1133
01:09:25.311 --> 01:09:29.360
to come up with something funny to say something,
something clever,
something.

1134
01:09:29.361 --> 01:09:32.300
See you show that you're not going to quit in life.

1135
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:34.760
Cause that's what I hate to say dude.
But that's what you showed her.

1136
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.830
You showed her that you have,

1137
01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:42.020
you have the quit DNA in your fucking ball bag and she's not going to want to

1138
01:09:42.021 --> 01:09:42.854
meet with you.

1139
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:50.840
But fortunately there's plenty other gazelles out there on the fucking Serengeti

1140
01:09:50.841 --> 01:09:53.390
that you can try to run down.
You see the discovery channel.

1141
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:55.880
Cheetah doesn't always fucking run the thing down.

1142
01:09:55.881 --> 01:09:59.420
Sometimes it gets kicked in the face and then it sits there feeling stupid,

1143
01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.730
especially when it realizes that it's being filmed.

1144
01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:03.950
It's going to be on basic cable.
There's where you can,

1145
01:10:03.951 --> 01:10:07.070
you can actually look at a bright side.
It wasn't filmed did you?

1146
01:10:07.071 --> 01:10:10.670
You just got to kind of come up with something in that moment.
That's funny.

1147
01:10:10.671 --> 01:10:12.320
And I actually kind of thought about it,

1148
01:10:12.321 --> 01:10:16.130
what I would have said and I would have choked even if I tried to come up with

1149
01:10:16.131 --> 01:10:19.700
something funny because in the moment I would have felt like a Douche and I

1150
01:10:19.701 --> 01:10:21.800
probably would have attacked what she did for a living,

1151
01:10:21.801 --> 01:10:26.450
which is the worst thing you can do.
We like really,
you know,
you fucking,

1152
01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.920
you've been working here for a year and a half,

1153
01:10:27.921 --> 01:10:29.720
two years I've been seeing making sandwiches.

1154
01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:34.280
You're not getting any younger this sweetie.
All right.
You know,
I would,

1155
01:10:34.281 --> 01:10:37.700
it would have been bad.
It would have been bad.
It's very easy for me,
you know,

1156
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:41.030
for me to sit here and tell you what you should've done.
You know,

1157
01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:43.320
it's kind of like,
uh,
you know,
when you,

1158
01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:48.330
when you watch a football game or something like that and once it ends and

1159
01:10:48.471 --> 01:10:50.780
whatever the game plan was,
didn't work out.
They do.

1160
01:10:50.781 --> 01:10:54.090
What did they give it to Marshall?
Foch I don't understand.
Um,

1161
01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.230
it's easy to do that.
So,
um,

1162
01:10:58.490 --> 01:11:02.100
I don't know what to tell you.
Like,
you know,
be funny.

1163
01:11:02.101 --> 01:11:04.410
You got to go back there and keep ordering sandwiches.
I don't know.

1164
01:11:04.411 --> 01:11:06.870
That's fucking humiliating.
You might,

1165
01:11:06.871 --> 01:11:08.700
you might have to find a new place to get a sandwich.
Dude.

1166
01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:11.700
I gotta be honest with you.
I don't know how you pull yourself out of that one.

1167
01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:17.680
What did you say?
You know what?
Fuck it.
Oh,

1168
01:11:17.681 --> 01:11:20.590
this is what you do.
Jake Heights is just in and just kind of be a dick.
You know,

1169
01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.090
once you could just walk up,
hey sunshine or something.

1170
01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.700
I don't listen to me.
All my shit just always ends up with,
you know,

1171
01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:32.760
if there's a reason I get heckled as much as I do because I'm an asshole.
Um,

1172
01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.930
but as far as like a,
what you said earlier,

1173
01:11:34.931 --> 01:11:37.540
cause I know there's a lot of women pulling their fucking hair out right now

1174
01:11:37.541 --> 01:11:41.680
when you say all the woman has to do is be pretty and wait for the offers to

1175
01:11:41.681 --> 01:11:45.640
come in.
Um,
I dunno dude,
if you ever had a girlfriend,
first of all,

1176
01:11:45.670 --> 01:11:50.020
that whole thing of looking pretty from my standpoint and my experience takes at

1177
01:11:50.021 --> 01:11:54.100
least four and a half fucking hours.
And um,

1178
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:55.751
and you never know.

1179
01:11:55.751 --> 01:11:58.780
That girl might might've been giving you the stink eye because she's a really

1180
01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:01.360
good looking girl and she,
she has a public,

1181
01:12:01.361 --> 01:12:06.250
she has a job where she deals with the public.
So believe it or not,

1182
01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:11.820
the amount of ugly fucking Addis shape dudes who actually don't have a problem

1183
01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:17.080
approaching beautiful women,
uh,
is actually,

1184
01:12:17.081 --> 01:12:21.990
it's the,
it's pretty high.
I mean,
personally I think it's funny,
but,
um,

1185
01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:23.740
if you're a woman,
it's not as funny.

1186
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:28.990
And I think that's something that took me a long time to realize how like I'm

1187
01:12:29.230 --> 01:12:33.040
uncomfortable.
That feeling can be,
you know,
cause guys,
snake,
dude,

1188
01:12:33.041 --> 01:12:35.080
I would love to be standing there and women hitting on me.

1189
01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.110
But would you have to do is you've got to see how we're physically made up.

1190
01:12:38.111 --> 01:12:40.330
The fact that a guy,
you know what,

1191
01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:44.560
what if there was this thing that physically could beat the shit out of you and

1192
01:12:44.561 --> 01:12:46.120
it wanted to enter your body?

1193
01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:53.470
That's the only way to try to put yourself and the,
and what if it's,

1194
01:12:53.471 --> 01:12:57.790
if you had not attracted to it and you feel it getting angry when you're trying

1195
01:12:57.791 --> 01:13:01.660
to communicate that,
you know you're all set,
you know,

1196
01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:04.930
and then there's the option that if they wanted to,

1197
01:13:04.931 --> 01:13:09.850
they could give you a forearm shiver and begin to execute their plan.
You know,

1198
01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.070
oh Jesus,
how do I talk myself out of this one?
You know what it's like,

1199
01:13:15.370 --> 01:13:17.980
put it this way for all the guys listening out there,
if somebody said,
hey man,

1200
01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.650
I'll give you 10 bucks.
This is like an old joke.
I still my act,

1201
01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:23.770
I'll give you 10 bucks to walk over to that birth.

1202
01:13:23.771 --> 01:13:28.760
Keep birthday cake and stick your finger in it.
Yeah,
got you.
10 Bucks.
Yeah.

1203
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:31.620
Fuck it.
I'll do it.
You know,
20 bucks or whatever.
Just something,
you know,

1204
01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.380
you do it.
You wouldn't think anything about it.
Whatever.
Stick it in.

1205
01:13:35.381 --> 01:13:37.420
You take it right back out.
You know,
you wouldn't give a fuck.

1206
01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:39.280
What if somebody said,
dude,
I'll give you,

1207
01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:43.390
I'll give you 20 bucks to take that cake and put it in your ass.

1208
01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:48.810
See what I mean?
There'd be a difference then.
Then you,

1209
01:13:48.811 --> 01:13:52.870
you would have some questions.
You know,

1210
01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:56.050
where's that kicked Ben?
Are you going to tell anybody?

1211
01:13:56.530 --> 01:13:59.470
I usually don't do things like this.
You know,
that's,
that's why women,

1212
01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:02.560
they approach sex that way.
You know,

1213
01:14:02.561 --> 01:14:05.320
they got to have rules on when they're going to fuck you and all that.
It's,
it's,

1214
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:09.490
uh,
did that,
that,
that example.
But I know on some level it made sense.

1215
01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:10.630
I'm a little jet lagged.

1216
01:14:10.810 --> 01:14:14.290
I done that joke in a while and I got halfway through and it didn't even make

1217
01:14:14.291 --> 01:14:18.850
sense to me.
I'm just saying it,
you know,
did I answer your question?

1218
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:22.390
Um,
so this is what you gotta do.
You gotta treat a,

1219
01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:25.900
you've got to treat women like,
uh,
like I treated open mikes.
Okay.

1220
01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:28.420
You just know you're going to bomb and eventually you're going to get good at
it.

1221
01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:29.440
So just keep,
you know,

1222
01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:34.870
make some notes what you're going to do the next time that happens.
You know,

1223
01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.240
maybe try to come up with a couple of lines and I hope women,

1224
01:14:37.241 --> 01:14:38.880
I hope you appreciate,
uh,

1225
01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:43.480
what a fucking pain in the acid is for a guy to get laid.
You know what I mean?

1226
01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:48.550
And that's why there's the whole,
um,
stud whore double standard.

1227
01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:51.430
Because basically for a guy to get laid,
this is what he has to go through.

1228
01:14:51.431 --> 01:14:55.360
This guy actually has to develop skills to get laid.
You know,

1229
01:14:55.361 --> 01:14:58.170
all you have to do is show up,
you know,
I mean,
for a guy,

1230
01:14:58.171 --> 01:15:03.130
the brass ring is getting a two on one.
No TV credits.
No,
my dad has a yacht.

1231
01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:07.480
You just get it from talking shit.
That is the brass ring for a guy.
Now a woman,

1232
01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:11.170
her first night of fucking all she'd have to do is laid out in a pool table.

1233
01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:14.980
She could fuck every guy in the bar.
It's not a skill.
It's gluttonous.

1234
01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:20.470
You know,
Scott Ness,
it's like watching a fat guy eat an ice cream.

1235
01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:24.850
You never catch up,
you know,
kind of many slack.
Haven't you had enough?

1236
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:30.940
Um,
all right,
I'm really glad I read it,

1237
01:15:30.941 --> 01:15:33.940
this podcast because this other one was not nearly as fucked up as this one.

1238
01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:37.440
I don't know if it's funny,
but it's definitely fucked up.
Okay,
here we go.
Uh,

1239
01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.930
there's another one.
Um,
Bill,
I'm getting laid off at the end of the month.

1240
01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:44.500
Naturally,
I would like to go to the dentist before my benefits run out.

1241
01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:49.330
What a sad fucking state.
You know what I mean?
Jesus Christ.

1242
01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.800
I really believe that people should have,

1243
01:15:50.801 --> 01:15:52.480
you should have some sort of fucking healthcare.

1244
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:55.690
We really need to overthrow these fucking bankers because there's plenty of

1245
01:15:55.691 --> 01:15:56.524
money out there.

1246
01:15:56.590 --> 01:16:00.580
If those banker comments weren't fucking charge in the u s government interest

1247
01:16:00.581 --> 01:16:04.720
for its own fucking money plowing ahead.
Um,
anyways,

1248
01:16:05.290 --> 01:16:09.130
here we go.
Uh,
since I did not care much for my current dentist,

1249
01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:12.610
I asked my fiance for the name of hers.
All right,

1250
01:16:12.611 --> 01:16:16.900
so just get you caught up if you didn't get lost at my moronic rant with no

1251
01:16:16.901 --> 01:16:19.780
information behind it there.
Okay.
This guy's getting laid off.

1252
01:16:19.781 --> 01:16:22.420
He wants to get his teeth cleaned before it's health insurance runs out.

1253
01:16:22.421 --> 01:16:25.960
He doesn't like his dentist.
So he asks his fiance for the name of hers.

1254
01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:27.160
He says my,
uh,

1255
01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:30.520
my fiance is Vietnamese and gave me the name of her dentist who was also

1256
01:16:30.521 --> 01:16:34.420
Vietnamese.
Bear in mind,
this is a typical Vietnamese dentist's office.

1257
01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:39.460
You have a dentist and office manager who is usually a woman over 50 and two or

1258
01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:44.200
three.
And he writes this in capital letters,
hot Asian hygienists.

1259
01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.040
I had a cleaning firm,

1260
01:16:46.041 --> 01:16:51.041
one of the hygienists who couldn't have been more than 20 years old and screamed

1261
01:16:51.071 --> 01:16:52.270
of junior college.

1262
01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:56.410
This was the high point of her career until she landed that Mrs degree,

1263
01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.800
I don't even know what that is.
Maybe I'm dumb.
I'm so,
anyways,

1264
01:16:59.801 --> 01:17:02.770
I'm getting my teeth cleaned.
We were flirting back and forth.

1265
01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:04.150
The appointment ended.

1266
01:17:04.151 --> 01:17:09.151
And we headed to the old 50 plus office manager before I could even utter a

1267
01:17:09.381 --> 01:17:13.370
word,
the old bag of bones said,
and broken,
broken English.

1268
01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:17.960
This appointment is covered,
but you can't come back until you find another job.

1269
01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:23.450
Jesus Christ.
Anyways,
he says,
my hot hygienists,

1270
01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.850
who up until that time was totally into me,

1271
01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:30.260
quickly looked at the floor and made an immediate beeline to the nearest

1272
01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:32.240
unoccupied exam room.

1273
01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:36.930
Now I am not a racist,
but I was so mad.

1274
01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:41.780
There's a sentence like this never ends good.
Okay.
Anything that starts with,

1275
01:17:41.781 --> 01:17:45.800
I'm not racist,
k but these motherfucking,
anyways,
um,
he says,

1276
01:17:45.801 --> 01:17:47.300
now I am not a racist,

1277
01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:51.500
but I was so mad that I could've slapped that bitch back to the Vietnamese rice

1278
01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:55.520
patties of 1974.
Here we go.
He's not racist.
Everybody.

1279
01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:56.840
How could she say that?

1280
01:17:56.870 --> 01:18:01.310
Especially in front of the Hottie who was obviously as dumb as she looked,

1281
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:04.550
Jesus Christ.
Dude.
Uh,
when I got back to work,

1282
01:18:04.551 --> 01:18:08.090
I told my coworkers the story and they implied that I was the victim of reverse

1283
01:18:08.091 --> 01:18:12.650
racism.
If I was Asian and had eyes that couldn't see through a key hole,

1284
01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:15.110
Jesus Christ,
dude,
she would,

1285
01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:17.900
she would have bitter tongue or said something more appropriate.

1286
01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:22.820
What do you think?
Uh,
okay.
What do I think?
All right.

1287
01:18:22.821 --> 01:18:25.610
Let me go with my first thought.
A thought number one,
dude,

1288
01:18:25.611 --> 01:18:30.170
you should not be getting married.
You should not be getting married.

1289
01:18:30.171 --> 01:18:31.004
Okay.

1290
01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:35.180
Especially because not only are you hitting on these fucking women,

1291
01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:40.040
you're so fucking
like end of this shit.

1292
01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:44.780
Like you just told me you were engaged and now you're dragging me into your

1293
01:18:44.781 --> 01:18:46.100
bullshit.
And I'll tell you when people do that,

1294
01:18:46.101 --> 01:18:48.230
like I don't mind if a guy cheats on his girl.
I don't give a fuck.

1295
01:18:48.231 --> 01:18:50.550
Just don't drag me into it,
you know?

1296
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:54.450
So then I got to fucking fix my face to the next time I see your girlfriend.

1297
01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:58.650
Don't you hate when people do that?
You know,
do what you do,
what you do.

1298
01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:03.200
Do what you do.
Do it over there.
Don't do it near me.
See what you,

1299
01:19:03.201 --> 01:19:05.700
now you're telling me you're,
you're fucking engaged and now you're,

1300
01:19:05.701 --> 01:19:09.410
you're hitting on,
first of all,
why are you hitting on this girl?
You know why?

1301
01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:10.273
I'll tell you why.

1302
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:15.430
Because you're not done fucking and because you're not done fucking,

1303
01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:20.060
you're setting yourself up,
dude,
for a brutal,
brutal situation.

1304
01:19:20.061 --> 01:19:22.100
The last thing you should be doing is getting married.

1305
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:26.120
You shouldn't even have a fucking girlfriend right now.
Okay?

1306
01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:29.240
And then there's a whole weird thing where your girlfriend's Vietnamese,

1307
01:19:29.241 --> 01:19:32.360
you go in here and they got all these hot Vietnamese girls and you're saying

1308
01:19:32.361 --> 01:19:34.760
he's not racist,
but then you're saying fucked up shit about them.

1309
01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:38.310
But I will give you the benefit of the doubt,
doubt,
benefit of the doubt.

1310
01:19:38.311 --> 01:19:41.040
Because this is written.
Okay?

1311
01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:44.730
And the one thing that sucks about writing shit is you lose the tone.

1312
01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:47.010
And a lot of times people are trying to joke around.

1313
01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:50.430
So it might've been the way I read it.
So we'll leave all of that out of there.

1314
01:19:50.431 --> 01:19:53.220
But Dude,
I'm gonna tell you right now,
you,
you should,

1315
01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:55.800
the biggest fucking thing about this is don't get married.

1316
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:58.230
You're not ready to get married.
Okay.

1317
01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:01.830
I think you're ready to go to Vietnam and fucking hit a single's bar.

1318
01:20:02.610 --> 01:20:05.970
I think you're ready to do that,
but you are not ready to be married,

1319
01:20:05.971 --> 01:20:09.030
so don't fucking do it.
All right.
You know,

1320
01:20:09.570 --> 01:20:13.740
just sit down and ask yourself,
am I done?
Fucking,

1321
01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:20.060
I guess other women because that's what you sign up for and um,

1322
01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:23.730
you're going to lose half your shit and you're going to have to,

1323
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:26.670
even if you don't have a kid,
you're going to have to pay alimony.

1324
01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:30.780
At least that's how it works in New York where you have to pay.

1325
01:20:30.781 --> 01:20:33.420
How about if you're married seven years for three and a half years,

1326
01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:38.130
you have to pay alimony to a healthy human being who really should just go out

1327
01:20:38.131 --> 01:20:42.260
and get a fucking job,
but for some reason they don't have to.
So,
um,

1328
01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.930
that's my advice.
I would say don't get married,
but as far as,

1329
01:20:45.931 --> 01:20:50.460
were you an example of reverse racism now?
You were,
uh,

1330
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:56.510
you were a victim of a 50 year old woman who is the typical front desk person at

1331
01:20:56.851 --> 01:21:00.750
any medical place.
They always yell out intimate information,

1332
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.660
like information,
you know,

1333
01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:09.440
constantly because they're so in the job that they stop understanding that

1334
01:21:11.761 --> 01:21:15.910
they're in front of the public.
That shit.
Hey,
you know,
you walk in there,
oh,

1335
01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:19.970
you know,
Mr. Johnson,
did you get that appointment?
How did it work out?

1336
01:21:19.971 --> 01:21:23.070
They'll yell that across the,
you know,

1337
01:21:23.190 --> 01:21:28.010
I actually worked in a dental office and I saw people get haggling over money

1338
01:21:28.011 --> 01:21:32.780
all the time at the fucking front desk and a,
I saw it bother a lot of people.

1339
01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:36.570
And um,
I don't know.
Um,

1340
01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:41.170
I don't think you were a victim of reverse racism.
I think that the,
uh,

1341
01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:45.500
old bag of bones as you call her a pro probably would have said that to anybody

1342
01:21:45.501 --> 01:21:47.210
else.
She sounds like,
you know,

1343
01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:51.470
you kind of have to be a tough person to work the front desk because a lot of

1344
01:21:51.471 --> 01:21:55.910
people try to get out of pay in their shit.
So,
um,
your,

1345
01:21:56.010 --> 01:21:59.480
what you should've done was talk to the dentist or even taken her aside.

1346
01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:03.310
And that's what you do in that situation.
Just be like,
look,
you know,

1347
01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:04.061
I understand that.

1348
01:22:04.061 --> 01:22:06.940
I don't have a job right now and you really don't need to be yelling that.

1349
01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:10.870
I think you owe me an apology.
That's the way you handle it.
You know what I mean?

1350
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:14.460
I wouldn't go the reverse race.
You've got to understand this concept every race.

1351
01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:18.360
So don't take it racially.
You know,
if she said,
hey,
round die.

1352
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:22.020
Once you go get a job at Dunkin donuts so you can afford the next fucking

1353
01:22:22.021 --> 01:22:25.650
payment.
All right?
You Fat.
Fuck.
You know she said something like that.
Yeah,

1354
01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:29.910
but she kind of laid the facts that she was rude,
she was rude.

1355
01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:33.270
Uh,
that's what I would go with on that one.
But then again,
I wasn't there.

1356
01:22:33.450 --> 01:22:38.040
All right.
What am I up to here?
Dirty nine.
Okay.

1357
01:22:38.041 --> 01:22:40.260
I gotta read this revenge story.
Then I got to get off my day,

1358
01:22:40.261 --> 01:22:42.970
cause this is my last day in Stockholm,
Snead and Yang,

1359
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:45.510
and I want to go have a good time.
All right.
Um,

1360
01:22:45.511 --> 01:22:48.030
I called this part revenge of the revenge stories.
All right,

1361
01:22:48.031 --> 01:22:52.740
here's a revenge story that comes back.
I'm bringing this,
this topic back.

1362
01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:54.830
Here's this guy's revenge story.
Um,

1363
01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:57.750
you always hear about people fucking up someone's car.

1364
01:22:58.050 --> 01:23:01.230
I actually used this guy's car to fuck him up and no,

1365
01:23:01.231 --> 01:23:04.410
I didn't run him over or any stupid shit like that,
like that.

1366
01:23:04.411 --> 01:23:06.040
This was more and much more fun.

1367
01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:10.540
I was employed by a company that made electronic equipment for computers a

1368
01:23:10.541 --> 01:23:13.830
number of years back and I drove one of my,
uh,

1369
01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:18.550
I drove one of the many forklifts in the warehouse during the regular day shift.

1370
01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:22.090
It was one of those warehouses,
um,
where the warehouse,

1371
01:23:22.091 --> 01:23:24.490
the administration was an all in one building,

1372
01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:28.870
which meant that everyone employed in the company worked in the same location.

1373
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.930
I'm the warehouse manager at the time.

1374
01:23:31.931 --> 01:23:36.460
My boss's boss was this short Mexican dude who stood about five foot five and

1375
01:23:36.461 --> 01:23:40.490
was a fantastic shitbag asshole.
Oh,

1376
01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:44.650
I'm just going to let you digest that and never heard that vulgarity put

1377
01:23:44.651 --> 01:23:48.700
together that way.
Fantastic.
Shitbag asshole to anyone taller than him,

1378
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:53.500
which meant pretty much the entire planet with the exception of China and maybe

1379
01:23:53.501 --> 01:23:58.150
one island in Indonesia.
Indonesia got on bed.
Um,

1380
01:23:58.810 --> 01:24:02.200
he believed that leadership meant he could be an asshole to him or whoever,

1381
01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:06.430
whoever damn well he pleased and it pleased him a whole fucking lot to be an

1382
01:24:06.431 --> 01:24:07.264
asshole to me.

1383
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:10.480
I won't bore you with the issue with or your listeners with the details,

1384
01:24:10.481 --> 01:24:14.530
but as Napoleon complex drove his actions more than any other reason,

1385
01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.260
this is what always happens when I start to read them bad.

1386
01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:21.400
I think if I read it faster,
I will,
uh,
start reading it better.

1387
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:26.380
Why don't I take a breath,
slow down and read the rest?
Okay,
here we go.

1388
01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:28.130
Here comes the revenge.
Uh,

1389
01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:33.100
my job would be on the line if I outrage outright fuck outright faced off with

1390
01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:37.150
this guy.
So abroad would be out of the question.
And frankly,

1391
01:24:37.330 --> 01:24:40.150
the whole morale of the workplace with Lyft a little bit.

1392
01:24:40.151 --> 01:24:42.490
If this shit bag was taken down a notch or two.

1393
01:24:42.730 --> 01:24:46.660
So I decided to take matters in my own hands without the use of physical

1394
01:24:46.661 --> 01:24:51.460
violence or property damage.
Now this here is actually a unique way to go.

1395
01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:56.860
All right,
here we go.
He said,
uh,
what I did was,
is I,
I put up the A,

1396
01:24:56.861 --> 01:25:00.070
I put up his car for sale and here's how I did it.

1397
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:02.650
At the time I worked for this company,

1398
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:07.720
the PT Cruiser had just come out and this Mexican closet case went out and

1399
01:25:07.721 --> 01:25:08.740
bought himself one.

1400
01:25:09.010 --> 01:25:12.520
Maybe he thought they weren't as gay as everyone else knew they were,
but hey,

1401
01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:17.440
this fuck nut didn't have both oars in the water in the first place.
Um,

1402
01:25:17.441 --> 01:25:21.010
some months before I struck up a great friendship with this chick who worked at

1403
01:25:21.011 --> 01:25:24.130
the front desk who also doubled as a human resource assistant.

1404
01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:26.600
I took her out to lunch as in a,

1405
01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:30.940
at a place of her choosing an exchange for this shitbags home phone number.

1406
01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:32.740
Here's where the fun begins.

1407
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:36.700
I picked up two different local newspapers and I took out ads for the,

1408
01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:40.400
in the classifieds for this guy's car and arrange to have the,

1409
01:25:40.450 --> 01:25:41.800
have them run for a week.

1410
01:25:42.190 --> 01:25:47.080
The ads basically said that I had a brand new PT cruiser for sale for less than

1411
01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:50.710
half the cost of the new one and I had to leave the country soon but couldn't

1412
01:25:50.711 --> 01:25:51.670
take the car with me.

1413
01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:56.440
I also worked at odd hours and the best time to get ahold of me would be between

1414
01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:58.180
the hours of one and five in the morning.

1415
01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:03.010
Newspapers got really lax about their classified ads used to be,

1416
01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:05.810
they'd call the number you gave them to make sure it wasn't bullshit.

1417
01:26:05.811 --> 01:26:09.200
But since the Internet and craigslist took over,
they rarely checked.

1418
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:13.340
I placed the same ad and two papers on Monday afternoon and quietly waited.

1419
01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:17.360
Wednesday rolls around and I can already see the result of my handiwork.

1420
01:26:17.361 --> 01:26:19.490
This fucker shows up to work without a shave.

1421
01:26:19.690 --> 01:26:23.720
Pores themselves fuck loads of coffee all day while cowering in his office.

1422
01:26:23.721 --> 01:26:27.170
Like one of those baby monkeys with the wire cage mother.

1423
01:26:28.630 --> 01:26:29.650
I don't know what that means.
Um,

1424
01:26:29.651 --> 01:26:32.740
he'd obviously been getting calls at fuck all hours of the night and couldn't

1425
01:26:32.741 --> 01:26:35.920
sleep for shit.
It may have cost me a couple of bucks to get the ads up.

1426
01:26:35.921 --> 01:26:38.620
But to see this asshole bloodshot and out of his head more,

1427
01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:42.310
more than made up for it,
that's actually pretty decent.

1428
01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:46.060
Um,
and with that I'm going to do overrated,
underrated.

1429
01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:49.120
And I actually have to commend that guy cause there was no physical violence,

1430
01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:54.280
didn't chop his hair off.
He didn't fuck up his car.
He just had people,
uh,
he had,

1431
01:26:54.310 --> 01:26:59.310
I like all he also like somehow had other people doing his dirty work for him.

1432
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:03.700
Um,
I give that one an eight.
Alright.
[inaudible] overrated,
underrated.

1433
01:27:03.730 --> 01:27:04.660
Televised Poker.

1434
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:08.320
Who wants to watch a group of Asians with mullets sit at a table,

1435
01:27:08.321 --> 01:27:11.560
sober playing cards.
You know,

1436
01:27:11.561 --> 01:27:13.980
you guys are really getting good at this writing shit,
I think,
uh,

1437
01:27:14.110 --> 01:27:17.590
with each week when you write these in,
it's making it easier for me to be funny.

1438
01:27:18.130 --> 01:27:19.600
Uh,
Nancy Grace,

1439
01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:24.250
this media horror needs to change her fucking Tampon or get a good night's Dick

1440
01:27:24.251 --> 01:27:27.970
in her.
All right.
Child beauty pageants.

1441
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.490
Mom never want any beauty contests.

1442
01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:34.780
So it's real important for her to her fucking that are fucking spawn does.

1443
01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:37.360
All right.
You know what,
I'm done reading.
I don't know what happened.

1444
01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:39.850
I can't read anymore.
These are all great.

1445
01:27:39.851 --> 01:27:42.970
I should read the rest of them next week.
I'm too fucking tired.

1446
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:45.430
I've been stuttering over everything.
Um,

1447
01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:48.280
let's just end this God damn podcast abruptly.

1448
01:27:49.650 --> 01:27:50.483
<v 13>MMM.</v>

1449
01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:55.250
<v 9>I want to thank the person who sent me the a ram super bowl and um,</v>

1450
01:27:55.610 --> 01:28:00.610
I actually went on the Internet and watched a number of other super bowls and

1451
01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:05.120
I'm not going to tell you where they are for fear that the NFL is going to take

1452
01:28:05.121 --> 01:28:06.860
them down.
But they had the,

1453
01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:08.973
<v 13>mmm.</v>

1454
01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:13.510
<v 9>The original broadcast,
not the NFL film version.</v>

1455
01:28:13.511 --> 01:28:18.511
They had the original broadcast of a Superbowl three and all four of the

1456
01:28:20.051 --> 01:28:23.620
Superbowls that the Steelers won in the 70s.
And I got to tell you,

1457
01:28:24.850 --> 01:28:29.850
it's a real football education to watch those games without like,

1458
01:28:30.970 --> 01:28:33.130
I mean,
I love NFL films style beautiful.

1459
01:28:33.131 --> 01:28:36.750
They make it in the drama and the music and everything.
But to watch the,

1460
01:28:36.910 --> 01:28:40.240
you know,
some of them even had the commercials.
They will fucking incredible.

1461
01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.830
If you want to know where they're at,
just email me and I'll,

1462
01:28:42.831 --> 01:28:44.790
I'll let you know where they're at.
But um,

1463
01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:48.610
which is stupid cause if someone from the NFL is listening to this,

1464
01:28:48.611 --> 01:28:53.500
they send me an email,
whatever you can find them.
But anyways,
like I just,

1465
01:28:53.530 --> 01:28:57.070
I watched super bowl three and um,

1466
01:28:58.630 --> 01:29:01.710
<v 12>you know,
Joe Namath was,
I,
it really reminded me of Dan Marino.</v>

1467
01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:04.800
Like he couldn't sack the guy.
He's totally picking up the blitz.

1468
01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:07.100
He had that quick release.
He was,

1469
01:29:07.101 --> 01:29:10.370
he was really picking them apart and uh,
but I

1470
01:29:10.630 --> 01:29:14.460
<v 9>[inaudible] the cults just fuck themselves.</v>

1471
01:29:14.910 --> 01:29:17.160
They threw three interceptions

1472
01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:21.870
<v 12>in their own end zone,
not their own end zone.
And the jets end zone.
Like they,</v>

1473
01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:26.820
they literally like conservatively left like 23 points on the table in the

1474
01:29:26.821 --> 01:29:30.360
first.
Um,
and the first half alone,

1475
01:29:30.361 --> 01:29:33.810
and I'm not taking anything away from the jets here because they played a

1476
01:29:33.811 --> 01:29:38.640
phenomenal game,
but like,
uh,
that Earl moral man,

1477
01:29:38.641 --> 01:29:41.120
he just,
he was the MVP of the NFL that yeah,

1478
01:29:41.150 --> 01:29:45.650
<v 9>year took over for Johnny Unitas,
I guess the guy's elbow was,
uh,</v>

1479
01:29:46.190 --> 01:29:50.600
was all tore up so he couldn't play.
But I mean he had one,
he had a touchdown.
It,

1480
01:29:50.601 --> 01:29:53.240
it's like a three yard pass and he threw it like Brett farm.

1481
01:29:53.241 --> 01:29:58.010
He threw it like 90 miles an hour to the guys outside shoulder at the flecks off

1482
01:29:58.011 --> 01:30:02.120
them.
Easy touchdown.
And it'll shoots up in the air.
It gets picked off.

1483
01:30:02.850 --> 01:30:06.920
They had a flea flicker at the end of the half and this Guy Jimmy or is wide

1484
01:30:06.921 --> 01:30:09.110
open jumping up and down.

1485
01:30:09.111 --> 01:30:12.020
He misses him and he throws into to fucking,

1486
01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:15.110
I mean tactically it wasn't double coverage,

1487
01:30:15.111 --> 01:30:18.020
but there was jets all around the guy.
They throw another fucking pick.

1488
01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:20.203
I watched three

1489
01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:22.750
<v 12>watch Superbowl nine,
which is a great game.</v>

1490
01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:25.540
The first half total defensive struggle.

1491
01:30:25.810 --> 01:30:28.840
And then in the third quarter of Franco Harris starts running wild.

1492
01:30:28.841 --> 01:30:31.880
And it really wears down the front four of a,

1493
01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:34.990
the Steelers and the Steelers defense.
It's just fucking incredible.

1494
01:30:35.650 --> 01:30:39.550
And I'm something I didn't know Terry Bradshaw was fast.

1495
01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:41.790
See,
I was too young to,

1496
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:44.710
to know that I saw older Terry when he couldn't run anymore.

1497
01:30:44.711 --> 01:30:49.210
He ran a four five 40 and he was at definite threat.

1498
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:52.460
<v 9>But um,
and then</v>

1499
01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:56.180
<v 12>Bolton killed me because I was a huge cowboy fans in the,</v>

1500
01:30:56.181 --> 01:30:58.070
in the 70s and watching them

1501
01:30:58.900 --> 01:30:59.860
<v 9>kind of,
you know,</v>

1502
01:30:59.861 --> 01:31:03.790
they went up 10 to nothing in the first half and just they were playing real

1503
01:31:03.791 --> 01:31:07.150
loose and then they went like halfway through the second quarter they started

1504
01:31:07.151 --> 01:31:08.960
playing Marty Ball.
They just,

1505
01:31:08.970 --> 01:31:13.390
it was sitting on the this 10 nothing lead with two and a half quarters to go.

1506
01:31:13.391 --> 01:31:15.940
I fucking could not understand it.

1507
01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:19.090
And then all of a sudden the Steelers just creep back into the game.

1508
01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:22.390
And next thing you know they're down by like,
I dunno,
six points.

1509
01:31:22.570 --> 01:31:25.390
Then they open it up again and they fucking score touchdowns.
I'd,

1510
01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:28.660
I was really frustrating as a cowboys fan,
but I got to tell you,

1511
01:31:28.661 --> 01:31:32.170
watching those great Steelers teams was incredible and super bowl 10.

1512
01:31:32.171 --> 01:31:34.270
Lynn Swann has,
I believe,

1513
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:37.570
the greatest performance of any wide receiver in Superbowl history.

1514
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:40.960
And that includes Jerry Rice.
He,
he,

1515
01:31:40.961 --> 01:31:44.740
he has arguably two of the greatest catches in NFL history.

1516
01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:46.120
Forget about the super bowl.

1517
01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:51.240
The guy had like four catches for like 160 yards and that last pass that Terry

1518
01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:54.760
Bradshaw's throws him is one of the best pastors have ever seen in my life.

1519
01:31:54.761 --> 01:31:58.090
I'm telling you,
go on,
go on the Internet,
find them.

1520
01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:00.550
There's a of shit up there.
This,

1521
01:32:00.551 --> 01:32:04.390
that game where a Joe Montana becomes a superstar,

1522
01:32:04.391 --> 01:32:08.270
that game where he fucking throws it to Dwight Clark.
If you're an uh,
you know,

1523
01:32:08.290 --> 01:32:11.050
if you're a younger guy and you never got to see those games of telling,

1524
01:32:11.051 --> 01:32:13.330
you just go on the Internet,

1525
01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:18.010
you know where the fuck to go and find them because they're,
uh,

1526
01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:21.910
they're absolutely incredible.
And,
um,
I dunno,

1527
01:32:21.970 --> 01:32:24.370
I got to watch three Superbowls I'd never seen before.

1528
01:32:24.371 --> 01:32:28.090
I had basically plus the rams.
So I watched four super bowls.

1529
01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:32.310
That's what I did in Stockholm,
Sweden when I couldn't sleep.
Um,

1530
01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:37.320
I know I'm babbling right now and this is only interesting to a football fans.

1531
01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:40.630
God Damn,
I forgot to talk about that keg rater again.

1532
01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:46.150
I saw this story on the Internet.
I saw this TV show with this guy.

1533
01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:50.020
He got a Kegerator,
which I had never heard of before.

1534
01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:54.940
It's basically looks like a big desk,
you know,
some of the bigger ones,

1535
01:32:54.941 --> 01:32:59.230
but it basically,
it holds a keg in there and you just have beer on tap.

1536
01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:03.820
Any wield it.
He had an in his kitchen and of course his wife is like,
honey,

1537
01:33:03.821 --> 01:33:07.270
it's ugly.
It doesn't match anything.

1538
01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:11.200
And what is this fucking sad sack do?

1539
01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:15.940
Does he say it's my kitchen too?
Eh?

1540
01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:19.300
They give a shit back?
No.
He's like,
Ooh.

1541
01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:21.650
And she,
you know what?

1542
01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:24.970
They fucking wield the thing out into the garage.

1543
01:33:26.170 --> 01:33:26.470
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1544
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:30.650
<v 9>And he's like,
well,
how'd the garage,
and I'll turn this into a man cave.
Why?</v>

1545
01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:31.271
You know something?

1546
01:33:31.271 --> 01:33:35.860
If you're a man and you've been banished to your basement or your fucking
garage,

1547
01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:40.300
what the fuck is wrong with you?
You know what I mean?
I just,

1548
01:33:40.301 --> 01:33:41.680
I don't understand that.
Why

1549
01:33:43.370 --> 01:33:47.600
it's just not a partnership.
I couldn't believe it.
But you know what?

1550
01:33:47.601 --> 01:33:50.080
It did really make me do as I want to get a fucking CAGR rater.

1551
01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:52.220
You want a reason why I'm not going to,
cause if I had one,

1552
01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:55.040
not only wanted it to be a fucking raging alcoholic,

1553
01:33:55.190 --> 01:34:00.020
I would weigh a good two 40 I could have blocked for Franco Harris and fucking

1554
01:34:00.021 --> 01:34:04.760
Superbowl nine if I had a Goddamn Kegger rater.
But I'm telling you,
you know,

1555
01:34:05.150 --> 01:34:08.090
if you're one of those people who doesn't give a fuck and you're already an

1556
01:34:08.091 --> 01:34:12.380
alcoholic,
if you want to cut down in some of the expenses of,
you know,

1557
01:34:12.381 --> 01:34:15.920
we're always having to go to a store and then everyone's trying to have an

1558
01:34:15.921 --> 01:34:19.250
intervention and try to help you not be an alcoholic so they won't go to the

1559
01:34:19.251 --> 01:34:23.810
store anymore and you don't have to be standing there going,
get me the booze.

1560
01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:27.200
Like that dude on intervention.
Get a fucking kegger.
[inaudible]

1561
01:34:28.810 --> 01:34:33.070
it's,
it's,
I'm telling you,
I didn't even know that they existed.

1562
01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:35.980
I just wish I was like,
you know,
15,

1563
01:34:35.981 --> 01:34:39.580
20 years younger and those things existed.

1564
01:34:40.330 --> 01:34:42.040
Or maybe they did.
I never heard of him,

1565
01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:46.720
but I would have had one in my apartment back in my old bachelor of fucking
days.

1566
01:34:47.170 --> 01:34:50.230
And how would it had shit on tap because that's back then you remember back then

1567
01:34:50.231 --> 01:34:53.110
your 20s was the tail end and we could fucking eat,

1568
01:34:53.111 --> 01:34:57.500
drink 12 beers and eat McDonald's and somehow wake up with a flat stomach and

1569
01:34:57.530 --> 01:35:00.920
barely a headache.
I swear to God,

1570
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:03.740
I've never done a,

1571
01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:09.020
I did a commercial early on in my career long fucking time ago,
my career.

1572
01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:14.000
Um,
but don't,
I kind of got away from it after a while.
I don't know why,

1573
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:18.470
but uh,
that's something I would have no problem doing a fucking commercial for.

1574
01:35:19.130 --> 01:35:19.963
You know,

1575
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:24.730
I would have no fucking problem whatsoever doing a commercial for a,
uh,

1576
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:29.690
for a Kegger Raider,
you know,
cause that's something I would fucking use.

1577
01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:33.410
Oh,
by the way,
somebody sent me this hilarious fucking email.

1578
01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:36.170
This is going to be when these classic podcasts where I,

1579
01:35:36.171 --> 01:35:40.040
Sam wrapping it up and then I do another 15 minutes.
Where the fuck is it?

1580
01:35:40.041 --> 01:35:42.260
This guy sent me this hilarious email.

1581
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:45.140
Remember last week when you guys asked me about,

1582
01:35:45.170 --> 01:35:46.730
somebody asked me about the bloggers.

1583
01:35:47.370 --> 01:35:48.203
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1584
01:35:48.430 --> 01:35:50.440
<v 9>And,
uh,
I,
you know that,</v>

1585
01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:55.150
that supermodel who outed the blogger and I basically said,

1586
01:35:55.210 --> 01:36:00.010
uh,
that I could see,
you know,
I could see both sides of it.
Why the fuck is it?

1587
01:36:00.011 --> 01:36:04.690
Somebody was really pissed at me for a God damn it,

1588
01:36:04.691 --> 01:36:06.700
where is it on any level.

1589
01:36:08.890 --> 01:36:09.670
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1590
01:36:09.670 --> 01:36:13.240
<v 9>Supporting that supermodel.
I can basically paraphrase what they said,</v>

1591
01:36:13.241 --> 01:36:17.600
but what they wrote was so fucking funny though.
Ah,

1592
01:36:17.630 --> 01:36:21.410
God damn it.
I can't find it.
They basically said,
uh,

1593
01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:23.750
sticking up for celebrities.

1594
01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:28.550
I knew you moving to La was a bad move.
Uh,

1595
01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:33.990
and it was something else about me being a sellout and then it just said,

1596
01:36:33.991 --> 01:36:35.820
fuck you,
bye.

1597
01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:44.910
You know,
and I,
I just wrote back,
I was just like,
okay,

1598
01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:48.420
have a good one.
I just thought it was funny.
You know,

1599
01:36:48.421 --> 01:36:53.070
I just think it's funny when people complain.
Uh,
I dunno.
There's like,

1600
01:36:53.071 --> 01:36:55.950
people have that thing.
If you move to la,
like you become a phony.

1601
01:36:55.980 --> 01:37:00.980
It's like all that road really proves his was I was already a phony and that

1602
01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:05.640
you,
you don't become a phony moving out to la.
You,
you're,

1603
01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:09.210
you're either a phony or you're not this phony people on the fucking east coast.

1604
01:37:09.330 --> 01:37:13.170
How many times do you fucking cunts back on the east coast got to get fucked

1605
01:37:13.171 --> 01:37:17.040
over by somebody in business or like,
dude,
yeah,
I'll be there.
Yeah,

1606
01:37:17.041 --> 01:37:18.030
I'm going to pay you back.

1607
01:37:18.031 --> 01:37:21.160
How many fucking times when people got to do shit like that before you realize

1608
01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:23.940
that there's this console over the country.
All right.

1609
01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:27.950
This constant la too.
It's just better whether that's,

1610
01:37:27.951 --> 01:37:31.670
see that's the only difference.
All right.
All right.
That's it.

1611
01:37:31.671 --> 01:37:32.720
That's the end of the podcast.

1612
01:37:32.721 --> 01:37:36.050
