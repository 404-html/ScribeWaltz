00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.930
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.970
September 2nd.
Oh,
happy Labor Day,
everybody.

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.670
Huh?
Ou
um,

4
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.830
is it labor day around the world?

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.450
If it is happy Labor Day to all you guys out there,

6
00:00:23.451 --> 00:00:26.810
especially ones that make all of our clothes.
Huh?

7
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.150
Everybody in the first world out there.
Come on,

8
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.160
let's have a nice round of applause for this six year old in El Salvador.

9
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.960
Who made you a little cargo pants that you're walking around the cookout with

10
00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:41.360
right now with your big stupid pockets,

11
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.220
your wife's role in her fucking eyes gone.
Why does he keep wearing those shorts?

12
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:50.450
He hadn't college.
Oh God.
The nineties or over.

13
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.740
Why doesn't he see it?

14
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.450
Why did I end up chopping on his dick instead of that other guys?

15
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.520
Then another guy,
he became a doctor and he wears slacks.
Now.
Um,

16
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.900
for those of you around the world listening to this podcast and my ego tells me

17
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.030
that diverse people around the world,

18
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.200
yet I'll maybe somebody sitting in a bunker,
right?

19
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.560
Listening to this shit over here in the United States,

20
00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:20.300
we have something called Labor Day because we worked so fucking hard in this

21
00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:24.170
country.
[inaudible] number one.
You know why?

22
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.170
Cause we outworked all you.
Yeah.
A bunch of lazy fucking cunts.

23
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.903
<v 0>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.260
<v 1>Actually we did,
according to Tom Brokaw was the greatest generation.</v>

25
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.020
They fucking did everything except raise their kids,
right.

26
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.083
<v 0>You know,</v>

27
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.070
<v 1>they raised their kids,
right?
What?</v>

28
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.830
They are reacted to the Vietnam war the way they did not,

29
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:51.990
they would've gone into the Pacific the same way they did in World War II.

30
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.850
We got a job.
The dough,
it's gotta get done.
No one wants to do it.
Fuck it.

31
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.250
I'm volunteering.
Right.
They were so shell shocked from that.

32
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:03.630
They couldn't even look at their kids.

33
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.150
And then the kids just grew up all spoiled rotten.

34
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.210
And then all of a sudden it was their turn to go and then they would just say,

35
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:13.560
Hey man,
like Joan harsh to mellow man.

36
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.840
Right?
And that was the beginning of the end.
I'm telling you right now,

37
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.630
if less people dodge the Vietnam war,

38
00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:25.410
you wouldn't have as many fat people in this fucking country right now.
Okay.

39
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.830
And if you can't do the math on that one,
then you know what,
I can help you.

40
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.280
That's one of my new things is I just make stupid statements to people in bars,

41
00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:42.060
right?
That connect in no way possible.

42
00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:44.700
And as I watched their forehead wrinkle up,

43
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.660
I throw in and if you can't do the math,
then I can't help you.

44
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.090
It's a fucking wonderful game because it,
it,
it puts somebody,

45
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:57.240
remember when you were like in,
in like junior high grade school,

46
00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:58.380
junior high or whatever,

47
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.690
and kids started talking about sex and they would be like,

48
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:05.440
do you know what this is?
And you had no idea,
but you didn't want to admit to it.

49
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.230
You know,
cause you didn't want to be the kid who didn't know,

50
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.990
even though nobody was fucking anything at that point.
Right.

51
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:15.580
But you just didn't want to be the dummy.
That's what I'm tapping into.
All right.

52
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:18.340
And if you can't do the math on that,
then I can't help you.
I'm telling you,

53
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:20.180
you got,
and when you say I can't help you,

54
00:03:20.181 --> 00:03:24.340
he got to look away and just let them sit with that,
you know,

55
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:29.000
just sitting with it.
But that didn't make any sense.
Why should I let it go?
He,

56
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.730
anybody else noticing that?
Ah,
I don't know what it means.
Um,
anyways,
Labor Day.

57
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:38.050
I don't know what the history of it is.
I'm sure I could look it up on Wikipedia,

58
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.770
but so could you,
you know what am I?
You're fucking reader.

59
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.360
Do you want me to do it?
Cause I,
I will,
I'll look it up right now.

60
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.720
I'll fucking click on this right here,
right?

61
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.660
And then I'm going to type in Labor Day l a.

62
00:03:53.661 --> 00:03:58.510
M.
B.
E R.
T.
O.
R.
Jesus Christ.

63
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.430
Labor Day history.
What is the history of Labor Day?
You know,

64
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:07.480
there's gonna be something horrific.
Labor Day politics,

65
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:10.200
history begins with worker strikes and 1890.

66
00:04:10.201 --> 00:04:13.480
So you know what you knew there was going to be some sort of bloodshed.

67
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.780
My,
and then we all forget,

68
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.380
years later we're just sitting around a fucking big green egg smoking a big pork

69
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:22.480
shoulder,
which is what I'm doing right now.
A,
uh,

70
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.810
Rosebowl legend Jason Law head will be joining the,
uh,

71
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.930
um,
I,
I should really clarify that.
Rosebowl tailgate legend.

72
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.030
I keep calling this legends like we're actually out there playing the game.

73
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.570
Oh look at that.
An advertisement for Hertz rental car.
You know what?

74
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:42.100
I think I'm actually going to switch to them.

75
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:46.030
This is free advertising for those cons because whenever I go to the airport and

76
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:48.850
I'm waiting for fucking budget,
those Douche bags,

77
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.310
I think they have one bus at every airport.

78
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.000
And I've really tried to sit there and be like,
okay,
am I just impatient?

79
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.350
And so I just started counting buses and I got to tell you,
Hertz and Avis,

80
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.380
they got a lot of buses,
national and Alamo.
They're kind of like a,
I dunno,

81
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.930
they're from the other side of the tracks.
You know,
they didn't come from money,

82
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:10.930
but they're working their way up.
They got to share a bus,
you know,

83
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:12.340
but it's building character over.

84
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:16.930
There's a lot of character or at Alamo and a national,
but I'll tell you,

85
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:21.010
budget,
budget,
budget wasn't raised right.

86
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.610
He need to stay away from them.
I've had it with those cuts.

87
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.210
We had it with my belt,
with them for fucking ever.
I've had it with them.

88
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.871
All right.

89
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:32.200
Labor Day's political history begins with worker strikes and eight to in the

90
00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:35.680
1890s yeah.
This is when,
why we had sweatshop labor over here,

91
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.190
which is why we created unions so that they would stop.

92
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.160
And then the unions literally became the fucking thing that they were fighting.

93
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.910
All right?
Lean in on shovels,
some on break and all that fucking thing.

94
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:49.660
Taken advantage of it.
And then the corporate client said,
Oh yeah,
well,
you know,

95
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.590
good luck to you and your union would taking the factory to another country.

96
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.920
Go on strike all you want.
We're still making money.
All right,
there you go.

97
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.580
Like the Maginot line,
they flew right over the fucker.

98
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.580
So now here we are.
All right.

99
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.750
And that poor guy in rage against the machines got to bring his Ukulele all over

100
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:13.751
the fucking country to try and get the people of this nation refocus on what the

101
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:17.990
purpose of a union is.
Because all those,

102
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:22.070
hey man,
people,
they all had kids.
They all had kids.

103
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.230
All right?
And then they joined unions and then everything left.
All right.

104
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.150
And Cue can't do the fucking math on that.

105
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:33.210
Then I can't help you feel that I just walked away and I can't help.
Um,

106
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.220
Labor Day has fallen upon us once again.
Oh,
this guy,

107
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.610
what a writer has it really fallen upon us,

108
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:47.090
has its graced itself with its,

109
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:50.960
with our graced ourselves with its presence.
Is that how we say it?

110
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.870
Labor Day has fallen upon us.
Once again,

111
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.350
I would love to look up the Douche bag who wrote this and find out how many

112
00:06:57.351 --> 00:07:00.020
fucking articles he started that way,
you know,

113
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.820
just the way this does this hacky standup comics is also hacky writers.
Like,

114
00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:08.660
I refuse.
Ooh,
do you bill?
Are you really refusing?

115
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.400
Can you feel the world shaking in its fucking boots?
Um,

116
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.100
fuck you.
I have my or my,
my,
my,
my,
I have my standards that I live by.

117
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.200
I like to think piece of shit standards,
but standards done the left.
Um,

118
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:24.770
I don't,

119
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.770
I refuse to read any celebrity interview that begins with what they're eating.

120
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.490
I think that's the hackiest way to,

121
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.690
I've married a zillion to Ed John Travolta,
you know,

122
00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:43.691
breaks into some fucking medium rare steak wearing a smart button down.

123
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:47.990
Shut the fuck up and just ask him what it was like to be in dance fever.

124
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.380
All right.
Just say,
Hey,

125
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.360
I'm a star fucker and I can't believe I get to sit across in this ICAD.

126
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.120
It's amazing that when he eats,
he also gets shit on his face.

127
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.870
You wouldn't think that from an Oscar.
Um,

128
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.770
all right.
For most Americans,
we're back to the article now.

129
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.690
This means little more than the end of the summer.
Oh,
really?

130
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.670
You got to talk down to me right at the beginning of the fucking article,
Joseph,

131
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.470
if you fucking horn rimmed glasses from the 80s.
All right.
For most Americans,

132
00:08:18.471 --> 00:08:22.220
this means a little more than the end of the summer social season.
Oh,
well,

133
00:08:22.221 --> 00:08:25.460
you know he's actually right because I did have to look this thing up.

134
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.640
Kids and college students alike returned to school,

135
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.780
leaving relieved parents to grasp some sense of normalcy.
Yeah.

136
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.210
Jesus.
It to be more fucking dramatic.
Uh,
cookouts,

137
00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:43.190
flare on and friends get together for cool drinks after some outdoor fund.

138
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.910
Was this written in the twenties?
Uh,

139
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.610
no because there hasn't been anything racist yet.

140
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.990
We're playing horseshoes back then.
They probably use like a black guy.

141
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:57.990
They just hammered his head into the ground and use them as like a steak and

142
00:08:57.991 --> 00:09:00.480
nobody said anything wrong with it.
Right?

143
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.520
Isn't that how bad the racism was back then?
I might be wrong on that one.

144
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:07.350
I don't know.
Alright.
Amid all of the action,

145
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:10.990
everyone seems to forget that Labor Day,
what Labor Day is all about.

146
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.580
Well for the love of God.
Joseph,
can you get to the fucking point?
We get it.

147
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.440
You know what it is and we don't.
Oh,
what an asshole.
You know what?

148
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:22.020
In this picture he has his glasses on.
But as I read this,

149
00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:26.590
I picture him taking them off right now to give me a little talking to,
um,

150
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.630
during the late 18 hundreds,
labor leaders labor,
uh,

151
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:34.530
decided that hardworking Americans deserve the holiday of their own.

152
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.580
In other words,
they felt them getting ready to storm the castle.

153
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.070
This is the old bread and circus.
Um,

154
00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:45.570
after 1894 is monumental Pullman railroad strike,

155
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.520
Congress decided to federalize this holiday.
Ah,
God.

156
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.960
And let me guess.
The fucking morons agreed to it.
Hey,

157
00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:59.550
we wanted equal pay and we wanted some days and hours.
Hey,

158
00:09:59.551 --> 00:10:04.180
how about we give you a one day off a year?
Is there going to be bear?

159
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.900
Of course it's going to be there.
All you can track.
Oh,
I don't know about that.

160
00:10:07.901 --> 00:10:12.640
Fell sounds pretty good to me.
He's a jolly good fellow and that's the end of it.

161
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.140
They completely lose their focus.
Um,

162
00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:21.340
the Pullman strike has such a wide ranging implication that less than a week

163
00:10:21.341 --> 00:10:24.730
after it ended the president that then,
ah,
fuck,

164
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.000
President Grover Cleveland signed the Labor Day.
Act into law.

165
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.520
Now if you can't fucking do the math on that,

166
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.840
don't you see what's happening at this strike happened and all the fucking

167
00:10:34.841 --> 00:10:38.810
Blueblood Douche bags with their top hats chomping on a cigar bar.
Wow.

168
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.010
Why are walking around like the fucking penguin?
They saw what was coming.

169
00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.190
People were like,
we've had it.

170
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.730
We're not going to take this anymore and we'll come for you.

171
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:50.770
You tuxedo count on a Tuesday.

172
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.920
How much money do you have that you're wearing that getup on a fucking Tuesday.

173
00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.890
Right?
Back then they had spats,
right.

174
00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.180
Showed up a big long car.
Oh God.
They didn't try to hide it.

175
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:06.670
So they saw what the fuck was coming and then,

176
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.570
you know Grover Cleveland flow.
Who's kidding who,
how did he get an office?

177
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.330
All those rich cuts.
Right?
So they get them,
hey Grover,

178
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.630
I'm supposed to call me mister president Grover,

179
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.160
get an air wattle your fat ass in here.
You can't listen.

180
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.303
<v 0>Okay.</v>

181
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.050
<v 1>Okay if this shit,</v>

182
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.290
what happened at the Pullman strike happens straight across this land.

183
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.110
We're not going to have the money to keep the horse coming in to suck your Dick

184
00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:33.390
while your wife's in the other room.
Do you want that to happen?

185
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:34.580
<v 0>Okay.</v>

186
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.980
<v 1>It was a rhetorical question.
Just listen to us.
Okay.</v>

187
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.260
We need to have a fucking day off for these people.

188
00:11:39.261 --> 00:11:41.870
Just give them one fucking day off or smoke a pork shoulder.

189
00:11:41.871 --> 00:11:45.170
We'll get them a bunch of beer.
That'd be so fat and fucking hung over there.

190
00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:47.270
They'll be good till Christmas.
All right.

191
00:11:47.271 --> 00:11:50.390
Just do this for us so we can keep all the money.
Can you do that forest?

192
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.310
Haven't we done enough for you?
Your fucking name?
Grover Cleveland.

193
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:59.140
And we still got your,
the Oval Office.
All right,
we ready on to on tow.
Ready?

194
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.230
Right.
Um,
all right.
Sorry.

195
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.930
I think I don't need to read the rest of this.

196
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.190
Isn't that what happened considering then both of US soldiers in federal law

197
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:11.860
enforcement officers killed a number of strikers.

198
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.670
This was the least that he could do.
Oh yeah.

199
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.110
God forbid you protest that you work in fucking 900 hours a God damn week.

200
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.820
You know,
Jesus Christ.
See,
this is before they had like fucking,

201
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:30.470
you know,
CNN and Fox News to spin it and all that type of crap.

202
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.140
All he had was word of mouth going around,

203
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.673
<v 0>you know,</v>

204
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:36.470
<v 1>I'm sure they had newspapers.</v>

205
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.610
They have newspaper people read back in the 18 hundreds.
All right.

206
00:12:39.611 --> 00:12:41.570
I know I'm just sounded dumber by the second,
but I,

207
00:12:41.571 --> 00:12:46.510
I think I made some sort of point in there.
I like to think I did.
Uh,
well let's,

208
00:12:46.511 --> 00:12:47.950
let's,
this is actually fascinating to me.

209
00:12:47.951 --> 00:12:52.930
Enough to read some more of Jason's article said his name,

210
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.860
Joseph.
Sorry.
Uh,
minimum wage laws.
We're,

211
00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:01.150
we'll long way off and if one thinks the health insurance is bad now it was

212
00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:02.230
nonexistent then.

213
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:07.530
Then there was the gilded age is near total lack of workplace sanitation and

214
00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:10.960
fair paste pay standards.
Oh yeah.
Like when they built like the Brooklyn Bridge,

215
00:13:10.961 --> 00:13:14.110
like they average like five guys dying a day a day.

216
00:13:14.111 --> 00:13:16.210
Something crazy because they didn't understand the Benz.

217
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.760
And as they will bring somebody up and they'd start to get it,

218
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:23.260
were like bring him up quicker.
He's getting sick and then that would be it.
Um,

219
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.250
that was it.
Your Dad went to work and he died,
you know,

220
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.100
there was no 60 minutes,
you know,

221
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:32.740
coming out to fucking help you at Bradley or some Shit.

222
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.760
So he's still around and he died too.
Why do people died on that shelf?

223
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.290
<v 0>Okay.</v>

224
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.750
<v 1>Um,
well it's been around for 50 years,
Bill,</v>

225
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:44.430
but people died in the Brady bunch at this point.
Now Alice is still alive.

226
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.690
I don't know about Sam the butcher.
Mike died.

227
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

228
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:54.630
<v 1>The dead died.
Dad always dies,
you know,
fucking working his ass off.</v>

229
00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.150
I'm trying to drop some plans in fucking Florence Henderson coming in with the

230
00:14:00.151 --> 00:14:01.200
world's first mullet.

231
00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.293
<v 0>You know,</v>

232
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.960
<v 1>what the fuck am I?
Thankfully,
scores of long press.</v>

233
00:14:08.961 --> 00:14:12.200
Labor's eventually got together and formed bunions as individuals.

234
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:15.680
They were all but powerless to bring about the positive change in large groups,

235
00:14:15.681 --> 00:14:19.340
though they manage to secure the American dream,
not only for themselves,

236
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.640
but for generations to come throughout the 20th century.

237
00:14:22.641 --> 00:14:26.480
Democrats typically favored the interest of non-managed workers while

238
00:14:26.481 --> 00:14:29.570
Republicans catered to administrators and business owners.

239
00:14:29.571 --> 00:14:34.310
Why do you got to throw the Hatfields and McCoys in there?
Ya know,
it's US

240
00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:40.480
versus the 5% of them.
Okay.
Stop with the Yankees.
Red Sox,

241
00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:41.350
shit dammit.

242
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.580
Radicals in both parties often destroyed the chance for reasonable solutions to

243
00:14:45.581 --> 00:14:48.640
come.
Okay,
that's fair to complex financial problems.

244
00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:50.770
But moderate voices often prevailed.

245
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.720
That should explain our country's economic success.

246
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.000
It's success for most of the 19 hundreds.
Well,

247
00:14:56.001 --> 00:14:59.240
I imagined there's more to it than that,
but what the fuck?
So there you go.

248
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:03.050
People,
there's a little ignorant history on this wonderful fucking day.

249
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:08.070
And here we are 120 years later.
And,
uh,

250
00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:12.500
I'm sitting around today doing a podcast smoke at a pork shoulder.

251
00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:16.430
I made a fucking apple pie.
Now it's going down.
Calories,

252
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.660
calories will be consumed on this wonderful day.
Um,

253
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:22.191
you know,

254
00:15:22.191 --> 00:15:27.190
it would be great is if somehow you could just eliminate greed,

255
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.450
envy,
jealousy,
paranoia.
Last basically the seven deadly sins.

256
00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:38.910
Okay?
Look,
I'm far from a fucking perfect person.

257
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.990
Oh Geez.
Um,
but it would be good just at least at that fucking level,

258
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.130
<v 2>you know,
for brick,
you'd be like,
Hey,
yeah,</v>

259
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.900
we'll making enough money know why we should,
you know,
give you health insurance.

260
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.720
<v 1>I love that whole fucking myth that if you actually treat workers decently,</v>

261
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:59.110
like a fucking tee shirt is going to cost $50.

262
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.570
It isn't in order for you to continue maintaining your fucking giant yacht,

263
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.550
it would cost that.
When I was a kid,
you know,

264
00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.750
<v 2>factories would just starting to go overseas,</v>

265
00:16:09.751 --> 00:16:13.350
but they made a lot of shit here and sneakers weren't the equivalent of fucking

266
00:16:13.351 --> 00:16:15.930
$200 or whatever the fuck they said that they were going to be.

267
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.820
It's all bullshit.
I don't buy a fucking word of it.
And,
uh,
then that's it.

268
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:21.963
<v 1>All right.</v>

269
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.050
I'm not gonna talk anymore because at this point I'm probably even sounding more

270
00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:29.850
ignorant than usual,
but,
uh,
my gut tells me I'm right.
So go fuck yourselves.
Whoa.

271
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.590
I just bailed out of that one.
Didn't I?

272
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.180
Nice barrel roll right out of a fucking moving car.
Um,

273
00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.850
so most of you are probably asking,
not most of you,

274
00:16:38.851 --> 00:16:40.590
but a lot of youth or maybe none of you,

275
00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:42.890
but none of you can call in to tell me nothing.

276
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:43.460
<v 2>Thinking the song.</v>

277
00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.550
I'm going to go with this and say that you are thinking this shit you probably

278
00:16:45.551 --> 00:16:48.640
want.
And what exactly is a pork shoulder?
You're eating the shoulder of a port.

279
00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:50.410
It's actually the pig's ass,

280
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.370
<v 1>but you would sell a lot less of them,
I think if you said,
you know,</v>

281
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.330
you know pig ass pig rectum,
some people will go pig.

282
00:16:58.331 --> 00:17:02.650
But that's the closest I'll say.
But uh,
yeah,
we're eating the uh,

283
00:17:02.651 --> 00:17:03.820
the ass of a pig.

284
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.120
We smoking the fucker and it's going to be delish.

285
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.150
Um,
so anyways,
let's get on with the podcast here.
Have you buddy,

286
00:17:16.151 --> 00:17:19.990
do you watch any,
uh,
any of the college football this weekend?
Lie Ahead.

287
00:17:19.991 --> 00:17:24.180
Come on in.
Oh,
look who's here.
I'll tell you buddy.
Huh?

288
00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.890
Jump On.
Wait,
wait,
wait.
I got to give it a proper inch or the skill.

289
00:17:26.891 --> 00:17:29.860
You've never been on the podcast,
right?
Ladies and gentlemen,

290
00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.860
we have here the living legend.
He's tipping the cap.

291
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.180
I keep saying Rosebowl legend.
It's gotta be a rose bowl.
Uh,

292
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.040
a tailgate legend.

293
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.010
<v 2>Tailgate legend hall of fame.
Grabbed the microphone right there.</v>

294
00:17:42.011 --> 00:17:46.300
Grab the Mike touchdown in a rose bowl.
Exactly.
But we're built,

295
00:17:46.301 --> 00:17:51.150
we built a program here because when we started thing it was ugly.
It was bad.

296
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.860
I mean we were like three in the Bayesian.
You,

297
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.730
you weren't even there the first tailgate,

298
00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.560
<v 1>the first two years you showed up to the second one,
but you weren't cooking.</v>

299
00:18:00.561 --> 00:18:02.900
You were in another light first year.

300
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:08.710
I don't think I remember it was being drunk and barnick putting butter on the

301
00:18:10.701 --> 00:18:13.700
stakes with two fingers with his index finger and his middle thing.

302
00:18:13.701 --> 00:18:16.100
Cause we didn't have any utensils doing that today.

303
00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:20.420
And I had this little Hibachi and uh,
I just had met him.

304
00:18:20.421 --> 00:18:23.120
I didn't know how to cook.
I did not a grill or anything like that.

305
00:18:23.121 --> 00:18:25.910
I kept flipping the steak and I heard this guy go,
please,

306
00:18:25.911 --> 00:18:26.820
please stop flipping that.

307
00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.780
<v 2>Hopefully it was an Ohio state fan or no,
that was the second year.</v>

308
00:18:31.781 --> 00:18:33.860
I showed up to this,
this,
this was the first,

309
00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:34.870
<v 1>the first year.</v>

310
00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.410
This is already how long we've been doing this and how I'm starting to feel like

311
00:18:38.411 --> 00:18:39.221
the old man over there.

312
00:18:39.221 --> 00:18:43.090
The first year we went there it was USC versus Penn State.

313
00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.470
Fucking Mark Sanchez.

314
00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:48.340
Sanchez was quarterback for USC.

315
00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.120
Pete Carroll was still coach Joe Paternal

316
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:57.030
<v 2>Joe Paterno head at now need an uncovered yet.
Well,
I mean,
well you know,</v>

317
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.140
but the,
the fucking uh,
I actually

318
00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.340
<v 1>did stand up for both teams down at the Improv.
They had like,</v>

319
00:19:03.341 --> 00:19:06.580
there's three things.
So one night they had us,
one day they'd USC,

320
00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.300
one day they had Penn state.
Joe Paterno was not there.

321
00:19:10.301 --> 00:19:12.800
I often wondered was sent Dusky there.
I mean,

322
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.930
<v 2>granted everybody there was like the staff by then,</v>

323
00:19:14.931 --> 00:19:18.560
but everybody was shaving so he would,
he would have been hanging around.

324
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:22.700
They got to another rose bowl after what all that has happened right down a

325
00:19:22.701 --> 00:19:24.380
little bit.
Do you think that they would ever,

326
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:29.150
Penn state would ever go to an improv comedy show like that now,
even if,

327
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:33.990
you know,
just some guy that might just think they would,

328
00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:38.360
<v 1>they're already on TV.
And yesterday I caught myself going,
oh,</v>

329
00:19:38.361 --> 00:19:40.430
let's see how they rebuild this.
And then I had to think,

330
00:19:40.431 --> 00:19:43.490
wait and rebuild it from the pedophile case,
but they were already like,

331
00:19:43.491 --> 00:19:46.850
they're bringing Joe Paterno statue back out.
And uh,
you know,

332
00:19:46.851 --> 00:19:50.120
they took it down like he was fucking Sadam Hussein.
But I mean,
dude,

333
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.720
I don't want to get into that whole subject cause I love the guy,

334
00:19:53.721 --> 00:19:58.190
but I just don't know.
No matter what generation,
no matter how old you are,

335
00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.080
how you like,
you know what it is,
dude,
it's power.
It's money.

336
00:20:03.081 --> 00:20:04.190
It's the reputation.

337
00:20:04.191 --> 00:20:08.070
There was so much shit on the line that they tried to fucking and a handle it.

338
00:20:08.071 --> 00:20:11.010
And I don't know,
handling in house,
who knows?
Let's not even talk about that.

339
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:16.580
So smoking,
so they,
uh,
so that first year,

340
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.410
um,
I don't even think we had cigars.
We might've had cigars,
but dude,

341
00:20:21.411 --> 00:20:23.660
we got absolutely fucking annihilated.

342
00:20:23.661 --> 00:20:27.080
I think all we had was the stakes or maybe burgers.
I can't,

343
00:20:27.081 --> 00:20:30.060
I can't fucking remember all I remember dude,
I was selling cars.

344
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.390
You gotta understand when you guys go there,

345
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.990
like you help with the drinking with partner.

346
00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:39.620
I would go in like one on one.
Like if partner was a wrestler,

347
00:20:39.621 --> 00:20:42.680
we'd have to all come running in from the locker room.
Tried to take them down.

348
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:43.873
But I was

349
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.900
<v 2>mud wrestling scene from strikes when everybody,</v>

350
00:20:45.901 --> 00:20:49.590
all the girls had to go pick down John.
Yeah.
Is shut out of a mom.
Yeah.

351
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.580
<v 1>Um,
I actually saw that that actor who played,
uh,</v>

352
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.030
we played psycho and brands is Sawyer,
right?
Yeah.

353
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:59.740
I saw him in an episode of Tj Hooker.
It,
Tj Hooker,
some of the worst acting ever,

354
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:04.930
ever.
And he's still great.
He still great in it.
He was just,

355
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:05.920
he just was a fucking,
yeah.

356
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.430
<v 2>Great.
Atkins mammoth,
is that what his name was?
No,
no.
The other guy,</v>

357
00:21:09.431 --> 00:21:12.050
his partner hookers partner to good looking guy.

358
00:21:12.051 --> 00:21:15.740
The young guy who played in Italian,
but he was,
uh,
he was,
uh,

359
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.330
our meaning our eastern block and he played,

360
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.830
he played Romano was his name,
his last name started with a z.
He wasn't Italian.

361
00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:28.730
Yeah,
his real last name as like a Z,
y,
m t.
And it was like,
uh,
well you asked

362
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.100
<v 1>to watch it because they,
they never call him TJ.</v>

363
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.880
They just call them hooker the whole time so that they'll be like,

364
00:21:35.881 --> 00:21:38.010
when Tj is in a difficult situation,

365
00:21:38.011 --> 00:21:40.740
there'll be trying to find them out and the in and they got the walkie talkie

366
00:21:40.741 --> 00:21:44.640
going,
hooker,
hooker and it's just like that.

367
00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.790
I heard hooker from the day I was bored.
So like why,

368
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.460
how the fuck did they get on the air?

369
00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.500
Like why wouldn't you just pick something else?

370
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.760
<v 2>And that's probably why they just threw the Tj in the title so they could just</v>

371
00:21:55.761 --> 00:21:59.540
have the Tj but knew that they were going to have used it.
Yeah.

372
00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:02.450
I don't think you're going to get away with like hooker Friday night hooker and

373
00:22:02.451 --> 00:22:05.660
cvs,
CBS,
everybody.
Although that was right.
Everybody will know what I'm saying.

374
00:22:05.661 --> 00:22:09.980
The characters could have said fucking a could have said it said like Tj,
right?

375
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.890
Tj.
Tj.
That's still bad.
It is bad.
Call Him Tommy.
Tommy Hooker.

376
00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.130
Tom,
Tom Thomas.
He needs,
he needs more of a manly man.

377
00:22:19.131 --> 00:22:21.740
Built this program to what it is today.
I mean,

378
00:22:21.741 --> 00:22:25.550
this is like now listen for your arrest from where it started to now we're

379
00:22:25.551 --> 00:22:30.520
smoking meat.
Oh,
I,
the day starts with the Omelet got starts with the heater.

380
00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:33.380
Who's getting the heat?
Yeah,
it starts off with a whiskey.

381
00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:36.630
Then you have a fucking hundred of these.
Joe Barton.
Nick,

382
00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.820
I could drink a hundred of these.
I love when he does that.

383
00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.510
Literally Joe Part Nick,
after his first sip of Whiskey,
when it hits his lips,

384
00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:48.320
he looks around everybody in this like strong whispery voice.

385
00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.970
I could drink a hundred of these and then the nights,
the days on it,

386
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:55.850
he loses his ticket and then waits for us at the game.

387
00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.580
<v 1>Oh,
I don't even know if I even brought that up from last year.</v>

388
00:22:58.581 --> 00:22:59.870
That was the worst fucking,

389
00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.020
that was like the Willem defoe moment and platoon left and by,

390
00:23:03.021 --> 00:23:05.930
and somehow he lost his ticket.
We got,
yes,

391
00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:08.990
<v 2>so big.
He put him in his back pocket and I think,</v>

392
00:23:08.991 --> 00:23:10.610
cause I walk to the stadium with him,

393
00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.820
you guys were a little ahead of us because he was moving slow.
You know,

394
00:23:13.821 --> 00:23:17.180
Joe's a big duty at about a hundred of these in them.
Right.

395
00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.510
And as I was kind of like stay in his pace,

396
00:23:20.511 --> 00:23:23.150
like helping him and then we get to the gate and he goes right to his back

397
00:23:23.151 --> 00:23:26.780
pocket and it's gone.
And I'm like,
I looked up at,
I'm like,
ah,
we walked around.

398
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:30.680
But it was one of those things like if somebody had their game on and they saw

399
00:23:30.681 --> 00:23:33.010
that thing sticking out of his back pocket,
if he's just what you could just,

400
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.940
I mean those crowds,
you swipe it and you're gone.

401
00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:39.240
Or if it just fell on the ground,
pick it up.
He go scalpels.
Sizewell yeah.

402
00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.550
So he had to,
he had to stay outside.
That was a fucking worst.
Uh,
hey,

403
00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.650
is it true that they don't sell booze at the Rodeo booze at Rose Bowl?

404
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.040
That's where

405
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.420
<v 1>we are.
We're so in the,</v>

406
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.990
I never noticed by then that we don't even care and I never noticed that they

407
00:23:50.991 --> 00:23:53.540
don't.
So I gotta do,
I gotta do a couple of advertising right here.

408
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:55.780
If you just tuned again,
I like to say that like I,

409
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.250
this is actual radio station for then people downloaded it.

410
00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:02.210
We're talking to the two of the temp Rosebowl tailgate legends.
Uh,

411
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:06.840
Jason Law head.
He's over here smoking a fucking pig's ass.
Um,

412
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.990
all right.
Uh,
dollar shave club,
everybody.

413
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:13.910
There is so many things in this world that irritate me.
People with neck pillows,

414
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.840
people ride bicycles and don't get over and feel like I have to drive the

415
00:24:17.841 --> 00:24:21.080
slowest them because they want to go out on a ride.
Uh,
my own cowardice,

416
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.590
that annoys me.
Uh,
when so many things can irritate you,

417
00:24:24.591 --> 00:24:29.270
why add raises to that list?
It's time to stop milking your razor blade.

418
00:24:29.271 --> 00:24:30.080
Everybody.

419
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.290
I know what the brand name razors are used to paying outrageous prices and

420
00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:37.040
exhausting those razors until they start to look like a rusty soda camp.
Well,

421
00:24:37.041 --> 00:24:38.940

All right,
now went back to the podcast here.

466
00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:18.570
Everybody,
uh,
you're like,
you turned into like the Paul Harvey of

467
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:22.000
<v 2>casters now,
you didn't make live spots like right in the middle,
you know,</v>

468
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:25.550
like Paul Harvey now it's actually are,
you know,

469
00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:29.540
Sharman tissue paper,
Charmin tissue.

470
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.850
And then he'd go right there.
Now the rest of the story,

471
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:36.420
Sherwin tissue wrap a Jap in it and light them on fire.
It's 1945.

472
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.610
<v 1>Um,
yeah.
Back then when they would do like the,
the promos for the war,</v>

473
00:27:41.611 --> 00:27:45.200
I was watching all this emphasis of it reading these worlds war tube,
uh,

474
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:50.380
books and stuff and just watching some of those,
those like,
uh,

475
00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:54.190
propaganda films that they have like dude,
like the,
the um,

476
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.330
the work,
they would actually show like literally like war crimes,

477
00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.780
like strafing I guess was considered a war crime,
which is basically,

478
00:28:02.781 --> 00:28:07.250
if you had people like defenseless in the water after you shut down this ship or

479
00:28:07.251 --> 00:28:09.230
whatever,
shut down the ship,
torpedo their ship.

480
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:11.250
They would just see the survivors and the warrant.
Right.

481
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:15.663
<v 2>And it would show that</v>

482
00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.390
<v 1>no,
it to us,
it was brutal.
It was war man.
It's fucking brutal.</v>

483
00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.910
But what kills me is you think they try to keep it quiet,

484
00:28:21.911 --> 00:28:26.030
but they were describing one showing strafing in,
in a movie theater.

485
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.660
The crowd was going nuts and it goes there.
They,

486
00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:29.850
I boys let them have it and then he goes

487
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.120
<v 2>deserve it.
It's like Phil,
I was like,
I'm Phil Hartman sketch</v>

488
00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:38.300
and it got to like,
they always did the music behind it too.
Like the time,

489
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.720
like the happy like parade music.
Oh yeah,
absolutely.
No,
I was

490
00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.240
<v 1>of repeating myself from last week.</v>

491
00:28:47.241 --> 00:28:50.990
Like both sides viewed each other like they were animals.

492
00:28:50.991 --> 00:28:54.620
Like they thought that we,
we bled green blood and we had tails.

493
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:59.000
And uh,
I dunno where we said does,
we probably both said they,

494
00:28:59.001 --> 00:29:02.510
each side was the devils.
They said,
you know,

495
00:29:02.511 --> 00:29:05.810
if the Americans come kill yourself because they're going to eat you and all

496
00:29:05.811 --> 00:29:10.010
this type of stuff.
And they were actually,
uh,
committing acts of cannibalism.

497
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:14.210
Dude,
I've read that this book fly boys.
I'm telling you this,
a chapter in there,

498
00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.620
like I had to set it down and walk away for a little bit and then plow my,

499
00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.130
cause it was such a good book.
Just that,
that one chapter on that they would,

500
00:29:22.131 --> 00:29:25.490
it was a,
I don't know what's a,
were smoking a pork shoulder.

501
00:29:25.491 --> 00:29:27.620
I don't need to be talking about,
yeah,
the sugar pork shoulder.

502
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:31.700
We're going to be making some Coleslaw.
Coleslaw.
Yeah,

503
00:29:31.701 --> 00:29:35.150
but I don't need to be talking about fucking cannibalism.
If you had to,

504
00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:38.540
if you had to eat a person.
All right Jay,
I gotta ask you this.

505
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.980
What's the body type you would be looking for?
You

506
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.600
<v 2>wouldn't want survival or enjoyment.</v>

507
00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:48.580
Like if I had to like string it out over like if I had to like stock my shelf.

508
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:49.120
Well let's,

509
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.590
if I just really wanted an ice put on a nice suit and Hannibal Lecter,

510
00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:56.710
I want you to be,
let's consider for a second that I'm surprised that,

511
00:29:56.711 --> 00:30:00.670
that that reaction,
but let's just say your one night out or is it,

512
00:30:00.671 --> 00:30:05.570
I'm a Hannah and island John Goodman.
If I'm,
you know what I mean?
Like,
yeah.

513
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:10.370
Okay.
John Goodman will be nice and marbled.
Yep.
It's a lot of flavor of that.

514
00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:14.880
You've got an athlete,
it's gonna be yeah.
Too tough.
Exactly.
You know?
Right.

515
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.920
That's why,
that's why I asked and then can give,
you got to get it,

516
00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:19.310
you know what you're the best one you got,

517
00:30:19.311 --> 00:30:23.210
you got to get that married guy who used to work out,
but now he's got four kids.

518
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:27.020
I figured that would be the Volta that would be the best eats.
He's like Nice,

519
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:31.550
nice middle of the road kind of a guy.
Yeah.
And he used to dance.

520
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:37.630
Be Soft in areas where you can taste really good.
Like is no,
you think like,

521
00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.530
I'm like now it was like his nose or his double Chin would taste really good.

522
00:30:40.531 --> 00:30:45.510
Like I'd be like a snacks too exotic.
I ate like the pig hook up.

523
00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:49.310
No pig cheek.
I at one time started like sweating up.
My body was just like,

524
00:30:49.311 --> 00:30:50.720
what kind of fucking meat is this?
No,

525
00:30:50.721 --> 00:30:53.930
you gotta you gotta go with the nightmares for like a month straight.

526
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:57.620
You got to go with the term volt is pork shoulder.
All right,
let's see.
Okay,

527
00:30:57.621 --> 00:31:02.450
let's go with this Phillip Seymour Hoffman or uh,

528
00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:04.550
or John Travolta.

529
00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:09.580
I taught John Travolta be more like an eight ounce steak to be self fucking.

530
00:31:09.581 --> 00:31:12.050
And I think Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
You'd have to check this.

531
00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.570
You have to do a lot of cleaning.
Like you'd have to clean

532
00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.220
it looks like he waxes so you wouldn't have to go off that.

533
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.380
You wouldn't have to like,
you know,
job so much of the hair off.

534
00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:29.200
If I get killed a bear deer,
you have to really work the barrel.
Thank you.

535
00:31:29.201 --> 00:31:31.620
Right now it was Louie Depalma.
Let's get out of this.
Yeah,

536
00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.850
you're a big college football fan.
What'd you watch this weekend?

537
00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.690
Obviously I was in Vegas this weekend.
I watch my buckeyes.
We didn't look great,

538
00:31:37.691 --> 00:31:41.570
but uh,
I've got some work to do on defense number two in the country.
Oh,

539
00:31:41.571 --> 00:31:43.650
I can't wait.
We might be seeing them,
uh,

540
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.220
get yourself out of the hole real quick.

541
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:51.730
Like that guy in the Viagra commercial when he hopes to truck up to the horse.

542
00:31:51.731 --> 00:31:55.030
Right.
Well,
we got herb,
man,
urban Meyer.
That guy goes everywhere.
That guy goes,

543
00:31:55.031 --> 00:31:58.810
he wins.
I mean,
this is winning percentage is ridiculous.
Like eight 70.
I mean,

544
00:31:58.811 --> 00:32:02.790
he's undefeated season it Utah One.
I'm not as deep as,
you know,
he,

545
00:32:02.791 --> 00:32:06.550
he's not the guy who was there when they got suspended,
he left dress was gone.

546
00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:08.290
The white haired guy that's trestles guard.

547
00:32:08.291 --> 00:32:11.890
We had the defensive coordinator was like an an an an an him for one year.
Uh,

548
00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.180
thank God Meyer got sick of his family after a couple of years.
He,
oh,

549
00:32:15.181 --> 00:32:16.470
I would spend time with my family now.

550
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.570
Luckily they were annoying and he's back on the scene

551
00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.440
and,
uh,
two national titles.

552
00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:27.460
He probably could have won one in Utah if it was before it was po,

553
00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:32.050
Po prior bcs.
You know,
Alex Smith,
he recruited Alex Smith.
Uh,

554
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:35.590
you know,
getting rid of the bcs.
Like this is the last year.

555
00:32:35.591 --> 00:32:36.424
They're going to go to the big,

556
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.100
they're going to go to that final four type thing.
They're going go to a finally

557
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.650
<v 1>like,
has somewhat of a play off.
You got to play two games.
Yeah.</v>

558
00:32:42.651 --> 00:32:46.850
You're going to do.
They have a final for an NCAA football final four.
Huge.

559
00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:49.420
That's ridiculous.
And you know it,

560
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:51.920
most of the Games will be played right here in our backyard right here.

561
00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.860
I mean there'd be idiots not to use Pasadena for that.

562
00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.810
That's going to be amazing.
Well,
I've got to tell you,

563
00:32:56.811 --> 00:32:59.910
I watched my Lsu tigers playing the uh,

564
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:05.600
he go brown.
Hey.

565
00:33:05.601 --> 00:33:06.630
You know what's funny is I,

566
00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:10.870
I couldn't find the fucking game cause I kept looking up Lsu when it's on.

567
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.330
All he saw was versus Texas Christian University and I'm so dumb.
I didn't,

568
00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:19.160
I didn't know what they all,
they never said it the whole game.
They didn't go,

569
00:33:19.161 --> 00:33:21.710
come on Texas Christian University,

570
00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:26.870
they want to take no problems.
That was the game.

571
00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:28.220
We saw them against Wisconsin.

572
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.450
That was the game when we basically knew then we had to up our game in the tail

573
00:33:31.451 --> 00:33:35.510
gate realm.
It was that Tcu is causing game.
Like was that too next to us?

574
00:33:35.511 --> 00:33:39.010
Had the flat screen TV.
That's when we were like,
dude,
what are we doing?

575
00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:42.530
We thought we had,
we thought we came owed more prepared from the year before,

576
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:45.770
which was right.
And then we were like last year,

577
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:49.030
last year where the first time we had people were looking at our tailgate,

578
00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.600
go and see those guys.
They're doing it right.

579
00:33:50.601 --> 00:33:53.270
People were coming over every time I lift it up on the big one is women.

580
00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:55.490
When women start looking over gone,
thank God.
Look,

581
00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:59.510
because women don't forget anything.
No.
Yeah,
we had like moms like Wisconsin,

582
00:33:59.511 --> 00:34:01.940
mom's coming over going,
what are you cooking?
Like wherever,
you know,

583
00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:05.810
what is that were like kind of like trying to be nice to us to see if we'd offer

584
00:34:05.811 --> 00:34:09.140
them someone.
It was done like get them like,
oh yeah,
it was great.

585
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:12.080
I guess the greatest singer,
but la,
I watched the,

586
00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:14.740
the Ellis Lsu Tcu game and I gotta tell you,
man,

587
00:34:14.741 --> 00:34:17.580
this is supposed to be a rebuilding year for us.
This is my team,

588
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.620
but I got to tell you a Boston,
well do,
what am I?
What am I gonna Route?

589
00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:26.530
You got that football program that gone and a BC.
I never was a,

590
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.300
I liked their hockey,
but I just was never into the football team.

591
00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:33.140
I just was never ended.
I never liked the uniforms.
Well,
yeah.

592
00:34:33.141 --> 00:34:34.810
And you said that Maroon with the gold.

593
00:34:34.811 --> 00:34:37.700
I just never got like once every 10 years.

594
00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:41.250
Every DePaul they did an amazing job.
We had some great coaches.

595
00:34:41.251 --> 00:34:43.900
Said the fucking Guy Guy there with the,
uh,
the,

596
00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:47.870
the rosacea on his face from the wind burn.
Oh,
time.
Coplin yeah,

597
00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:52.400
we had him when it's not in season,
I can't remember anybody's fucking name.

598
00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:53.211
But anyways,

599
00:34:53.211 --> 00:34:57.080
we got that met and Burger guy at quarterback and now they're not switching off.

600
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:59.450
He actually looked really fucking solid.

601
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.690
They got cam Cameron now and is the a QB coach to everywhere.

602
00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.650
That guy look on waivers.
Drew Brees and uh,
what's his face?

603
00:35:06.651 --> 00:35:09.590
Joe Flacco when the Superbowl last year,
he coached all of those guys.

604
00:35:09.591 --> 00:35:13.040
So I feel good about that.
They got to,
they got this new kid.
Ego.

605
00:35:13.041 --> 00:35:16.970
Ferguson is great,
isn't it?
Sec?
What Games are the best right name?

606
00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.710
Anthony Johnson.
Both those guys were beasts yesterday.
Um,

607
00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.900
and then they've seen that,
you know,
the receivers are right,
Odell Beckham's.

608
00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.270
All right.
That's going to be a good year in a sec.

609
00:35:26.271 --> 00:35:29.970
Cause I mean obviously less what we're doing here.
We're doing Spurrier ball.

610
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:34.220
If LSU did didn't,
didn't have that one,
that one fumble,
that blue kid,

611
00:35:34.221 --> 00:35:35.270
I don't know whose fault it was,

612
00:35:35.271 --> 00:35:39.720
but dropped it right there and just basically gave him seven points.
Uh,

613
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:43.300
but Tcu actually looks strong and they're fucking uniforms.
A great,
yeah,

614
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.470
it was black on.
Did you hear what was blue?
Why they had that?
Uh,
no,

615
00:35:46.471 --> 00:35:50.160
it's purple with the purple.
Black and purple.
Yeah.
But why they had the uh,

616
00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.840
that Red Stripe?
No,

617
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:55.620
because I guess when the Horn toad or whatever the fuck it is,
the horn frog,

618
00:35:55.621 --> 00:36:00.300
when it gets mad and it gets upset,
blood comes out of its eyes.
Yeah.

619
00:36:00.301 --> 00:36:02.730
So that's what that's supposed to be.
We got to see one,

620
00:36:02.731 --> 00:36:05.820
I got to see one of those real life.
I've never seen me in real life and aids.

621
00:36:05.821 --> 00:36:09.410
Who's,
or do they exist?
They do well,
how you do this sign that they have is,

622
00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:13.550
it's the Fred Sanford Yard.
I got the Os right hands.

623
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.730
I can't work.
I can't pick it up.
Hey,

624
00:36:17.731 --> 00:36:22.530
do you need to check on that shoulder?
Yeah.
And they'd come back.
So anyways,
yeah.

625
00:36:22.531 --> 00:36:26.760
So I am a,
I am not referring to Lsu is,

626
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:31.110
is my team as a just,
I dunno,

627
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:34.590
I just did that acting gig down there and I got to tell you,

628
00:36:34.591 --> 00:36:38.360
I actually Miss New Orleans,
New Orleans sour.
The fuck you say it.
I,

629
00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:43.200
I,
I was there long enough to see the regular people where they live in those

630
00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:47.760
fucking awesome houses.
I got to tell you the humidity is for the fucking birds.

631
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.260
Um,
but I dunno,

632
00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:57.690
I really liked it and I actually was getting into the saints was just a fun town

633
00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:02.220
party town.
People like to booze.
I like to booze people like sports.

634
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:06.540
I like sports.
You know,
the only thing was missing was a fucking hockey team.

635
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:09.510
And then I liked the fact that they named that team the Pelicans and everyone

636
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:11.160
was giving him shit,
including me.

637
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.480
And they were starting to fucking bond over the fact that nobody liked their

638
00:37:15.481 --> 00:37:17.460
name.
And uh,
I dunno,

639
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:20.670
I spent too much time down there and I fell in love with the fucking city.

640
00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:25.470
Go ahead,
sue me.
So when law heads comes back,

641
00:37:25.471 --> 00:37:28.620
we're going to talk about our upcoming trip out to Denver.
Uh,

642
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:32.580
what am I going to talk about now?
Is it time to get into the questions?
Oh,
fuck.

643
00:37:32.581 --> 00:37:37.560
37 minutes in.
Let's get into the questions for this week.
Everybody,
uh,
Syria,

644
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.160
General Billy Patton.
Here's what's going on in Syria.

645
00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:45.600
I love that he starts with that.
Other than other words,
I kind of fucked up.
What?

646
00:37:45.601 --> 00:37:48.930
Ha,
well,
whatever I said was going on last week.
So here's the real deal.

647
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:52.260
I guess Assad is killing his people now.
That's the,
uh,

648
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:57.060
the Grand Poobah who's in charge over there.
He's killing his people.

649
00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:58.020
Not all of his people.

650
00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:01.140
Just the people that don't like him and anybody who's standing nearer,

651
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:05.610
I think anyways,
equally terrible rebels,
some of whom are al Qaeda,

652
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:10.110
al Qaeda are now going to be supported by the u s military.

653
00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:12.390
Now you're probably wondering,

654
00:38:12.391 --> 00:38:15.710
well why would we support anything that alcaide is doing?
Cause there it's,

655
00:38:15.711 --> 00:38:20.070
it's a money thing.
I guess this is sad isn't doing what we want them to do.
So,

656
00:38:20.071 --> 00:38:24.900
uh,
we're going to try and support the fucking,
uh,
the Marlins,
right.

657
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:29.070
That works to the Marlins sucked this year.
I have no idea.
Anyway,

658
00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:33.990
estimated up to 1.5 million civilians have been displaced.
That means homeless.

659
00:38:33.991 --> 00:38:38.991
I guess so now going to bomb Syria but also target some of Russia's shit and see

660
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.110
in Syria.
Yeah.
Cause they're supporting the Assad guy.

661
00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:47.620
What's my call?
Well I gotta tell Ya,

662
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:52.390
Russia is the six and nine team that nobody wants to play.

663
00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:57.460
I mean a lot of fucked it.
Why now?
I don't know what's going on over there.

664
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:59.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

665
00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:00.550
<v 1>I don't know who's I look,</v>

666
00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:05.640
I know that the only reason why we're over there was because of fucking money

667
00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.700
and something that comes out of the ground.
Other than that,
we don't give a fuck.

668
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.910
All right.
We don't,
we didn't give a shit about the people in New Orleans.

669
00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.640
Why would we give a shit about them over there?
It's all about fucking,
yeah,

670
00:39:14.641 --> 00:39:15.474
I don't,
I don't know.

671
00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:20.720
And whether that is the proper way to do it or if that's an evil way of doing

672
00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.590
what goes on around the world,

673
00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:26.850
I have no idea because I've never sat in a meeting in the Pentagon,

674
00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.070
so I have no idea what's going to go on over there.

675
00:39:29.071 --> 00:39:33.150
I feel bad for all the innocent people sitting there in the crossfire.

676
00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.660
And I feel lucky that I can lay in a bed and do a podcast right now.

677
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:40.500
Need some fucking poor pig's ass.
That's all I got for you,
sir.
What's my call?

678
00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:41.363
Um,

679
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:42.770
<v 0>yeah.</v>

680
00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:45.080
<v 1>Well,
it's an uphill battle,
I'd have to say.
I mean,</v>

681
00:39:45.081 --> 00:39:50.060
it's a home game for his side and now that they brought in the Russians,
I mean,

682
00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:53.180
well,
they don't have the greatest record.
They will.
He beat the fucking Germans.

683
00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:55.373
That was great.

684
00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:00.180
They just backed into their own country and just burned and blew up dams and

685
00:40:00.181 --> 00:40:03.510
bridges and all that.
Shay fucking raped their own goddamn country.

686
00:40:03.511 --> 00:40:07.320
So the Russians would have nothing the fuck they drew them in and then the

687
00:40:07.321 --> 00:40:10.170
winter came and then that was it.
They did the old rope,

688
00:40:10.171 --> 00:40:12.150
a dope before fucking alley.

689
00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:17.490
So he got to give them that one then,
but then they lost in Afghanistan.

690
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:20.870
That's always a hard thing to,
when you,

691
00:40:20.871 --> 00:40:24.440
when you got a road game in the game of war,

692
00:40:24.441 --> 00:40:28.440
that's such a fucking hard one to win because,
uh,

693
00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:32.270
the occupy in game,
because they know eventually you're gonna fucking leave,

694
00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:37.720
right?
Eventually.
You know,
your soldiers are going to want to go home,

695
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.420
right.
Sit down and have a fucking sandwich.

696
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.400
They get an egg.
I Dunno,

697
00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:49.110
find love and get on with their fucking life.
So that's,
I dunno,

698
00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:54.350
Afghanistan,
that's a tough one,
man.
You know what they are,

699
00:40:54.351 --> 00:40:57.350
they like the charges in the first round of the playoffs.
It's just a very,

700
00:40:57.351 --> 00:41:02.060
very dangerous team.
Um,
so what's my call?

701
00:41:02.061 --> 00:41:04.460
I think it's going to cost billions of dollars.

702
00:41:04.461 --> 00:41:07.220
It's going to make a couple of people $1 billion.

703
00:41:07.221 --> 00:41:09.380
Then everybody else is just going to be suffering.

704
00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.790
That's what I think is going to happen.

705
00:41:10.791 --> 00:41:13.190
And it's probably gonna ruin some of the environment.
That's what I,

706
00:41:13.191 --> 00:41:18.191
that's my call more of the same surf and it's just going to breed more hatred

707
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:21.320
and it's not going to solve anything.
That's what I think.
All right.

708
00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:26.060
Onward and upward towards new levels of misery.

709
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:30.050
All right.
Grass fed steak.
A dare bill bunches.

710
00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.660
You talked about juicing and all that.

711
00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:35.930
Have you to grass fed steak switched to what?

712
00:41:35.931 --> 00:41:37.580
I've been eating it the whole fucking time.

713
00:41:37.581 --> 00:41:41.360
I do two juices a day and then I throw down for dinner.
Right.

714
00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:46.160
I eat like a yoga instructor for the first two fucking meals and then I eat like

715
00:41:46.161 --> 00:41:50.880
John Wayne.
So what's better than doing it three times a day?
Um,

716
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.230
anyways,
he said it's amazing.
It tastes like steak.

717
00:41:54.231 --> 00:41:58.160
Tasted like 1520 years ago before they started pumping the cows full of

718
00:41:58.161 --> 00:42:00.480
everything.
Well,
I think they've been doing it longer than that.
Having that,

719
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:05.270
there's a company called grass fed beef company that Rogan talked about and had

720
00:42:05.271 --> 00:42:09.870
the owner on his podcast.
I highly ranked commend.
Uh,
I'll cut.
Cool.

721
00:42:09.871 --> 00:42:14.520
I highly recommend the Joe Rogan experience podcast because it's the exact

722
00:42:14.521 --> 00:42:18.120
opposite of this one where I just say shit with no facts behind it.

723
00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:23.160
Borderline makeup stuff.
Um,
he actually,
uh,

724
00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:27.540
oh shitty.
You got a TV show on about Joe Rogan questions,
everything.

725
00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.920
So,
um,
this is like,
I do,

726
00:42:32.921 --> 00:42:35.170
what I do on this podcast is kind of like,
you know,

727
00:42:35.171 --> 00:42:38.140
when you had what you thought was a cool teacher and then years later you

728
00:42:38.141 --> 00:42:42.760
realized he was completely irresponsible and wasn't doing his job slash may be

729
00:42:42.761 --> 00:42:45.130
trying to fuck one of the students.
That's what I do here.

730
00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:50.950
What Rogan does,
Rogan actually teaches the class.

731
00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:53.560
He earns his paycheck.
All right,
there you go.

732
00:42:53.561 --> 00:42:55.570
I probably just lost some fucking listeners,
but you know what,

733
00:42:55.571 --> 00:42:58.900
every once in a while even I have to tell the truth,
you know,

734
00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:04.680
uh,
back to school.
Mr. Barr,
do you miss going back to school?

735
00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:07.870
I missed the social aspects of it.

736
00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:13.350
I miss if I could have appreciated going like going back to school,

737
00:43:14.321 --> 00:43:18.040
especially if you're in like a public school that's like going to a club with no

738
00:43:18.041 --> 00:43:23.041
cover charge and every woman and is in there is single and is in their prime.

739
00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:24.500
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

740
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:29.090
<v 1>You know as are you all the guys have full heads of hair,
right?</v>

741
00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.040
All the ladies get their looking good.

742
00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:34.310
I made just to fucking shooting fish in a barrel.

743
00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:39.360
You don't need no opening lines or anything.
What's your side?
But,

744
00:43:39.361 --> 00:43:43.410
but you know you've been going to school for fucking ever now you got to do a,

745
00:43:43.411 --> 00:43:47.670
you know,
just shoot the shit with them.
I wish I knew that.
I did not know that.

746
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:52.730
Hence that was a complete failure,
failure and that department.
Anyways,
he goes,

747
00:43:52.731 --> 00:43:56.000
I'm 31 and every year around this time I think about how fun it was to go back

748
00:43:56.001 --> 00:43:58.880
to school despite the fact that I hated summer ending.

749
00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.320
It didn't want to be in class.

750
00:44:00.321 --> 00:44:03.560
You knew you didn't have a choice and focused on the good things like which

751
00:44:03.561 --> 00:44:07.130
girls are going to come back hot.
Will it be a new hot girl in school?

752
00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:11.540
I'm glad I get to see the girl I had a crush on last year but didn't see all

753
00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:15.110
summer because I was a nerd and had no balls.
What do you miss?
Yeah,

754
00:44:15.111 --> 00:44:16.100
I miss all of that.

755
00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:20.950
I miss running into my friends cause back before you even had a car,

756
00:44:20.951 --> 00:44:25.000
like you wouldn't see even most of your friends all summer.
Um,

757
00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.610
yeah I missed out on a lot of shit.

758
00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:32.190
It's like when star wars came up and we didn't have,
you know,

759
00:44:32.191 --> 00:44:36.450
we only had three channels and we didn't have the ones that the kids watched the

760
00:44:36.451 --> 00:44:37.020
UHF

761
00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.980
<v 2>stations.
And I guess that that's where they advertise that I dunno,</v>

762
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:43.380
we will live in a bubble.
I went outside everyday,
played in the woods,

763
00:44:43.381 --> 00:44:47.400
played sports,
went swimming.
I completely missed out when star wars came out,

764
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:51.900
came out.
And uh,
when I got back to school in September,

765
00:44:51.901 --> 00:44:55.620
everybody was talking about it and I had no idea what anybody was talking about.

766
00:44:55.621 --> 00:44:57.120
And I just had to kind of like a,

767
00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:02.960
<v 1>just stand there and then people realized that I wasn't contributing.
You know,</v>

768
00:45:02.961 --> 00:45:06.440
I felt like Steve Carell and fucking 40 year old virgin when he's talking about

769
00:45:06.441 --> 00:45:11.060
filling up a girl saying it feels yeah,
like a bag of sand.

770
00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:15.580
You know,
when he said that,
like that's what I,
I had nothing.
And um,

771
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:20.990
so finally somebody asked me,
they're like,
you know,
Bill,
did you see star wars?

772
00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:25.850
And I was like,
uh,
no.
Actually I didn't.

773
00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:26.713
And then all the little,

774
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:29.860
<v 3>oh my God,
you need to see what a fucking loser.</v>

775
00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:31.930
<v 1>Yeah,
no.
And that was it.
And I got trashed.</v>

776
00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.750
I literally get trashed for the rest of recess.
Recess.

777
00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:39.190
What's wrong with your parents?
And Blah,
blah,
blah.
And I just wished,

778
00:45:39.191 --> 00:45:43.210
like that's one of the things I wish I could go back to certain parts.

779
00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:47.650
Um,
J law,
heads back everybody.
Okay,
buddy.
We're talking about,
uh,

780
00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:49.960
going back to school here.
And by we,

781
00:45:49.961 --> 00:45:53.360
I mean me and my listeners who aren't talking,
um,

782
00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.180
and just saying things that you missed,

783
00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:59.230
are there any moments that you wish you could go back to in school to just have

784
00:45:59.231 --> 00:46:00.460
that fucking comeback?

785
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.110
You know when somebody gave you shit and maybe beat the shit out of somebody or

786
00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:07.390
maybe fucking ask the girl out the regrets anything.

787
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:11.030
<v 2>Hmm.
That's a good question.
You know what I,
one big regret I have is that uh,</v>

788
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:16.130
my parents always had one of them always took me to school.
That was so cool.
So,

789
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:20.070
so what to what gives?
My parents were all the way.
My Dad was my highest,

790
00:46:20.071 --> 00:46:23.800
my senior government teacher.
Oh my.

791
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.030
I rolled into the high school at my,

792
00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:28.290
I rolled into high school with my dad every day.

793
00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:33.280
<v 1>Oh Jesus.
But there must've been some girls.
It's cute.</v>

794
00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:35.830
<v 2>They did cause my dad,
every,
all the girls thought my dad,
they like,</v>

795
00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.020
there was a couple of girls that had shrines and my dad,

796
00:46:38.021 --> 00:46:40.750
he was kind of a good looking guy for his age back then.
He had the power,

797
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:43.150
you know how the guys,
when you had the power of dad by the way,

798
00:46:43.151 --> 00:46:47.290
is a hall of Fame High School Basketball coach.
Great Guy.
You met him but he,
he,

799
00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:51.130
so he had that bond believable.
But he was also a sharp looking guy.

800
00:46:51.131 --> 00:46:54.340
He was a good dresser.
He's kind of like a Pat Riley,
Chuck Daley of his era.

801
00:46:54.341 --> 00:46:57.610
He was always a sharp dresser.
Um,
good head of hair.

802
00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:01.030
So there was a one girl in my class,
I won't name her because if she's listening,

803
00:47:01.031 --> 00:47:04.120
she's just,
yeah,
don't ever don't name names.
No.
But she had,
like,
I,

804
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:06.280
I discovered this my junior year,

805
00:47:06.281 --> 00:47:08.840
she had a shrine to my dad because he was the coach.

806
00:47:08.841 --> 00:47:12.430
So there would be newspaper articles or anything she cut out of like our school

807
00:47:12.431 --> 00:47:13.264
paper.

808
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:16.540
She'll open her locker one day and there was a show like pictures of him from

809
00:47:16.541 --> 00:47:19.390
the newspaper,
pictures of him coaching pictures of him from the thing.

810
00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:23.350
And she was like,
what did you seriously just like,
it was creepy,
you know,

811
00:47:23.351 --> 00:47:25.590
I'm Kinda half him.
Yeah.

812
00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:30.070
That's gotta be where the hand job and about of him.
I'm a,
I'm

813
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:34.270
<v 1>a,
I'm a seventh of him,
I hope,
but I'm like you.</v>

814
00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.230
So it was just kind of creepy.

815
00:47:35.231 --> 00:47:37.930
But I think the one thing is I was held back in the fifth grade.

816
00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.620
This is like kind of a joke I tell.
Um,

817
00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:45.730
trouble maker,
but the thing was is like a little bit of like a trouble maker,

818
00:47:45.731 --> 00:47:48.070
not doing my work,
getting in with the wrong crowd type thing.

819
00:47:48.071 --> 00:47:52.900
But the joke was is no,
no,
no.
I was just like,
you know,
like uh,

820
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:56.590
you know,
getting sent to the office,
allied being,
you know,
sent in the corner.

821
00:47:56.591 --> 00:48:00.250
I was,
Shit's great.
I mean,
I wasn't doing drugs.
I got held back in first grade,

822
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:02.380
but not because of me.
My,

823
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:07.590
my brother was gonna borderline get held back in third grade and then my dad,

824
00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:12.010
what you catching them and no,
my dad just had this one for all,

825
00:48:12.011 --> 00:48:13.120
all for one kind of thing.

826
00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.600
So we held everybody back and then just felt like boys are more,

827
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:20.290
aren't as mature as girls,
they should be held back.
So we held all of his pack.

828
00:48:20.291 --> 00:48:23.530
Yeah,
that's part of why I was like the maturity level of just being a,

829
00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:24.603
as a young youngster.

830
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:28.800
And you know what's funny is I still completely fucking screwed up in,

831
00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:29.810
in high school.

832
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:33.480
I actually went back to my parents' house a few years ago and you know,

833
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.640
I was getting the last remaining shit out of there and my mother doesn't throw

834
00:48:36.641 --> 00:48:39.860
anything out.
And she had some of my,
my report cards too.

835
00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:43.240
I make just,
it was fucking ridiculous.

836
00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.020
It was cs ds and we didn't have F's.
They were called ease.

837
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:49.450
And I don't know why I'd see those.
Like cs ds,

838
00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:54.950
like the high water mark maybe was a solid c and it was just deep plus d minus d

839
00:48:56.050 --> 00:49:00.490
e and you're a smart guy.
You're a smart guy.
I mean,
that's like interesting.
Like,

840
00:49:00.491 --> 00:49:04.990
no,
you're a smart guy.
I mean you're a genius be you're a smart guy.
And uh,

841
00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:06.093
from what I know,

842
00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:12.340
I know what I'm good at and what I'm good at is being a loud mouth fucking idiot

843
00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:17.140
and somehow thanks to this business,
I'm able to turn that into a living.

844
00:49:17.141 --> 00:49:21.640
But if I was in anything else.
Um,
I always,
always a good,

845
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:25.150
I got a good work ethic from my parents,
but I,
I trust me dude.

846
00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:29.950
I failed at a lot of shit.
A lot of shit.

847
00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:33.430
Yeah.
I just,
I just wanted to have fun,
dude.
That's all I want to do.

848
00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:37.350
I didn't want to lie.
I didn't want to a,
I didn't want to work.
I,

849
00:49:37.351 --> 00:49:39.880
I didn't mind working,
but it had to be fun.

850
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.950
That's why I liked working at warehouses.

851
00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:45.070
I'd like blue collar jobs because there was this thing where you were working

852
00:49:45.071 --> 00:49:47.500
but you weren't in like this office of this cubicle.

853
00:49:47.501 --> 00:49:48.970
You weren't in this designated area.

854
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:53.950
It's switched yet different job sites and everybody was fucking funny.

855
00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.950
Like I had a buddy of mine,
he did construction and um,

856
00:49:57.850 --> 00:49:59.610
I went over to his job site one time and dude,

857
00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:03.170
they were the funniest motherfuckers and they had like catch phrases.

858
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.160
He had this thing where they would do,
if anybody bitched,

859
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:09.670
they would just like someone be like,
you know what the fuck is my nail gun?

860
00:50:09.671 --> 00:50:11.710
I Blah Blah.
And you hit somebody on the other side of house,
just go

861
00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.010
through like this baby thing,

862
00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:18.280
they this whack thing and that's who they would get because what they were doing

863
00:50:18.281 --> 00:50:22.570
was this unbelievable.
It was a fucking bitch of a job.
So what it is,

864
00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:26.590
you just saw how humor worked because if he starts bitching everybody bitches,

865
00:50:26.591 --> 00:50:28.730
then you just doing this job and he got this negative thing.

866
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:33.140
So it was this way to see because anybody would do it and they would start

867
00:50:33.141 --> 00:50:35.780
fucking laugh.
Everybody else would start fucking laughing.

868
00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:39.200
You'd be 90 degree heat,
putting a fucking roof on a house,

869
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:42.860
just hating your life.
Did I remember one time I lasted,

870
00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:46.280
I lasted 10 days doing this shit before I went back to the warehouses.

871
00:50:46.281 --> 00:50:47.810
I was fucking uh,

872
00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:50.360
working with these guys and we were putting a roof on something and I know I had

873
00:50:50.361 --> 00:50:54.780
to put like the scaffolding,
like the supports up,
drilling holes in and fucking,

874
00:50:54.781 --> 00:50:54.941
you know,

875
00:50:54.941 --> 00:50:57.740
hanging on the side of the house so they can put the board across it so they

876
00:50:57.741 --> 00:50:59.510
could do the fucking the roof.

877
00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:04.280
And I remember next door was his house with a backyard with an in ground pool

878
00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:08.570
and these two fucking hot chicks are bringing out shit and as these two guys

879
00:51:08.571 --> 00:51:13.571
fucking Jersey shore looking guys laying out right and enjoy in their fucking

880
00:51:14.031 --> 00:51:16.010
summer.
And I was just sitting there going like,

881
00:51:16.011 --> 00:51:18.980
what the fuck is wrong with this picture?
I remember one of them,

882
00:51:18.981 --> 00:51:20.060
one point was looking up,

883
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:23.870
watching us work and like he was just one of those good looking shredded guys.

884
00:51:23.871 --> 00:51:25.700
So he didn't have a fucking ounce of guilt,

885
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:30.260
not announced where I would actually in shame gone back into the house.

886
00:51:30.261 --> 00:51:33.350
Like I don't want to be enjoying the pool with those guys working like that.

887
00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:37.580
They,
this guy was just fucking like,
if you would've felt radio louder,

888
00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:39.950
you would have felt like we were making the roof for him.

889
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:42.320
He just fucking owned it.
And I'll tell you that guy,

890
00:51:42.321 --> 00:51:45.980
he has no regrets from his childhood.
He crushed I,
you just see it.

891
00:51:45.981 --> 00:51:48.760
This guy's crushing everything he was.
This is fucking beautiful.
God,

892
00:51:48.761 --> 00:51:51.670
that's funny.
I still remember that.
And there was this Irish guy,
Billy,

893
00:51:51.671 --> 00:51:54.680
it must work quicker.
You must work quicker.
And at one point I got mad.

894
00:51:54.681 --> 00:51:56.720
I was like,
dude,
this is the first time I fucking never put these up.

895
00:51:56.721 --> 00:52:00.350
If you want me to go faster and you've landed on your fucking back,
I'll do it.

896
00:52:00.351 --> 00:52:02.080
You know?
Wow.
You know?
That's like

897
00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:06.170
<v 2>I never had a real job.
That's what I,</v>

898
00:52:06.171 --> 00:52:08.660
the one thing I've loved about my life so far is I've never had one of those

899
00:52:08.661 --> 00:52:11.510
jobs where you just hate every day.
Like,
you know,
going into,

900
00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:15.950
I've always worked in the restaurants or you know,
hard like hard labor,

901
00:52:15.951 --> 00:52:19.430
worked out on the highway crew,
worked a little construction,
the more of a labor.

902
00:52:19.431 --> 00:52:21.950
I didn't know how to build anything right Kerry in the ship.

903
00:52:21.951 --> 00:52:23.330
But those kind of guys,
you're right.

904
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:27.020
Those kind of jobs are where you meet really funny people that you know

905
00:52:27.021 --> 00:52:28.240
appreciate the things that,

906
00:52:28.241 --> 00:52:32.260
that they get when they get them because they're working their ass off.
You know,

907
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:36.950
one time we had a guy who worked in the guy was a total fucking alcoholic,

908
00:52:36.951 --> 00:52:41.860
like coke head maniac.
And one time he showed up,
like,
I swear to God,

909
00:52:41.861 --> 00:52:45.590
like he was supposed to be the eight 30,
showed up like 10 30,
10,
45.

910
00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:50.260
And he comes in all bleary died and,
and his fucking hair there

911
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:54.090
<v 1>was soaking wet from a shower.
And he just comes walking in and he goes,
oh,</v>

912
00:52:54.091 --> 00:52:55.600
the traffic's traffic was doing,

913
00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:01.830
his fucking hair was soaking wet.
Dude,
his eyes look like roadmaps,
right?

914
00:53:01.831 --> 00:53:05.670
He's big.
Like,
it was funny,
he had like this,
he was a big guy,

915
00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:08.880
but he never worked out.
It was just all calories from his awful life.

916
00:53:08.881 --> 00:53:12.750
And he had this limp fish handshake.
He had skinny arms,
skinny legs,

917
00:53:12.751 --> 00:53:15.720
and just this keg of a chest,
you know?

918
00:53:15.721 --> 00:53:18.510
And even when those guys just keeps pushing the pants down and tightness and

919
00:53:18.511 --> 00:53:23.460
Belcher,
so he fucking,
um,
so we just used to keep giving him shit.

920
00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:26.910
This is before like being an alcoholic,
considered like a sad disease.

921
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:31.320
So remember what we were going to get donuts that day and fucking hilarious.

922
00:53:31.321 --> 00:53:34.430
Who Go,
Hey,
you know,
Paul,
you know,
I can't say I just said his name.
Paul,
Paul,

923
00:53:34.431 --> 00:53:36.830
you don't want,
you want a,
you want anything for donkeys?

924
00:53:36.831 --> 00:53:39.190
We're going to Dunkin donuts.
You want anything you want to,
you know,

925
00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:40.880
but back then they had muffins,

926
00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:44.320
they had donuts and that type of shit and he gives you guys right that and

927
00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:48.070
somebody goes,
how about a donut?
No good muffin.
I've good copy and I'm good.

928
00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:50.560
And then this other guy goes,
how about a rum cake?

929
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:58.620
We all fucking laughed our asses off of the guy.
Long story short,
he finally,

930
00:53:58.621 --> 00:54:02.800
he ends up getting fired and he left one of his,

931
00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:07.420
remember the show,
Remember Shaq?
It's,
it was like a,
it was a jacket and a shirt.

932
00:54:07.930 --> 00:54:12.730
It was basically like a flannel shirt with like a,
yes,
it had the,
yeah,
yeah,

933
00:54:12.731 --> 00:54:13.211
Shaq it.

934
00:54:13.211 --> 00:54:16.300
So he left that thing behind and this one dude you talking about like a funny

935
00:54:16.301 --> 00:54:18.160
basket and I'm like,
but really like artistic.

936
00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:22.990
He took all these empty boxes and made like a giant statue of the guy out of the

937
00:54:22.991 --> 00:54:27.250
boxes and he put the jacket on it and he drew these bleary eyes and he put like

938
00:54:27.251 --> 00:54:31.630
this mop and thing on top too.
We fucking came in.
Even the boss,

939
00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:36.760
we were fucking howling at this drunk that we didn't even try to help.

940
00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:38.290
We just fired,
fired.

941
00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:41.260
The guy sent him out on the street and then we just made that.

942
00:54:41.261 --> 00:54:45.190
We laughed our asses off when we leave and we left it up for like fucking like

943
00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:46.150
look,
this shrine.

944
00:54:46.151 --> 00:54:49.850
It was up for like two weeks and then finally the boss was just so well run low

945
00:54:49.851 --> 00:54:53.620
on boss.
You got to fucking take that thing down.

946
00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.550
Do we had this other guy?
I feel bad about this one.

947
00:54:57.551 --> 00:55:01.030
This guy we hired this guy in and the boss thought it would be a good idea to

948
00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:04.240
hire somebody that was a little bit older to try to get some sort of fucking

949
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:06.700
maturity because do we want,
we will.

950
00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:11.010
We just did all this dumb shit like uh,
you didn't care about your job.

951
00:55:11.011 --> 00:55:12.540
It is did dumb shit.
And then we,

952
00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.460
and we had like these things that we would do to get through the day.

953
00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:19.000
I remember there was this guy,
hey,
what bid is this thing in?
And it was,

954
00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:23.560
it was seven 37 and he kept going seven 37 in the gag.
Why?
Why?

955
00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:26.500
And he finally jumped off these boxes and did like this karate thing

956
00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:30.370
is loud as he could.

957
00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:34.180
And then one day we just decided we were all going to scream that at the same

958
00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:34.780
time.

959
00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:38.950
And the door was open from the warehouse into the suited area where everyone was

960
00:55:38.951 --> 00:55:43.110
dressed like Michael J.
Fox and out of nowhere and every,

961
00:55:43.111 --> 00:55:44.800
it was just really quiet.
Summer Day,

962
00:55:44.801 --> 00:55:48.070
the entire warehouse screamed at the top of their lungs,
just went

963
00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:55.020
right and I'm around it,
I can pick this.
So still,
I didn't know why we did it.

964
00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:59.940
Picked his fucking head up and his boss immediately came running in and he's

965
00:55:59.941 --> 00:56:03.910
going,
they're yelling that they're yelling out here like,
like we were animals.

966
00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:07.650
Like what are they doing?
And then he got fucking,
I almost said balled out.

967
00:56:07.651 --> 00:56:09.450
This is how old this story is.
Remember that expression,

968
00:56:09.451 --> 00:56:14.451
all that yelled at and then he came out and he had this high pitched voice and

969
00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:19.180
Ebook,
you know,
come on you guys,
you know,
you all here with Blah Blah Blah.

970
00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:22.090
And then whenever he would talk we would just just do this impression of him

971
00:56:22.091 --> 00:56:24.130
back.
We wouldn't even listen.
We were just

972
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.170
then you would just be frustrated and would walk away shaking his head and would

973
00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:35.410
just be like a bunch of babies.
Just a bunch of babies and we would,

974
00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:40.420
we wouldn't listen to any anybody like the level of mad that he had to get cause

975
00:56:40.521 --> 00:56:42.240
he oh that's right cause he gives us a substitute teacher.

976
00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:46.140
He used to be us and then he got promoted.
Ah,
there you go.

977
00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:48.290
That's what it was like.

978
00:56:48.291 --> 00:56:52.370
I've asked from wondered how Bill Russell was able to coaches players even

979
00:56:52.371 --> 00:56:55.150
though they all one together and he was the legend.
He had,
you know,

980
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:56.330
nine rings at that point,

981
00:56:56.331 --> 00:57:01.010
10 rings before he got his 11th like there's just something about like,
dude,

982
00:57:01.011 --> 00:57:04.150
you're telling me to run the stairs now.
Give me a fucking break.
Exactly that.

983
00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:07.270
That's where,
yeah,
come on.
All right,
let me,
uh,

984
00:57:07.271 --> 00:57:08.780
I got to read one more advertising here.

985
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:12.880
My little more Paul Harvey thing here and then I got to go a good day.
Good day.

986
00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:17.480
What have we got here?
Is this it?
Uh,
or we got a couple of here.
All Right,

987
00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:21.290
ladies and gentlemen,
uh,
he voice.

988
00:57:21.291 --> 00:57:23.510
If you're an entrepreneur and a customer calls,

989
00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:25.850
do you want to seem like you're in a high rise window view,

990
00:57:25.851 --> 00:57:29.480
fancy pants offers or do you want them to know you're sitting in your underwear

991
00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:33.230
with he voice?
You can create the appearance of an entire building,
sales,

992
00:57:33.231 --> 00:57:35.210
customer support,
tech support,
you name it.

993
00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:37.550
They're going to think you've got a giant office.
Uh,

994
00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:39.920
give your customers the royal treatment with he voice.

995
00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:42.080
A voice will forward business calls to your home,

996
00:57:42.081 --> 00:57:45.770
mobile or any number you choose.
Wherever you are,
he voice.

997
00:57:45.771 --> 00:57:48.950
We'll find you don't have time to take a call.
No problem.

998
00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:52.430
It's routed to your voicemail and you can read it at your convenience as an

999
00:57:52.431 --> 00:57:55.790
email.
He voice not only gives you an edge over competitors,

1000
00:57:55.791 --> 00:57:59.870
it takes away the edge that big companies have over you right now.
Why?

1001
00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:03.650
Because you can appear that you're just as big as they are and now you can try

1002
00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:08.450
he voice for 30 days for free.

Everybody.

1006
00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:23.660
Most Americans do not have a will,
but why?

1007
00:58:24.350 --> 00:58:25.910
I don't know cause they don't have a pot to piss in.

1008
00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:29.270
That's why I don't have a will.
That's what I would guess.
But if you do,

1009
00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:32.390
if you just,
if you do have a pot and it is filled with Piss,

1010
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:37.280
you don't want government rules dictating what happens to you,

1011
00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:40.100
to your property and your minor children.
A lot of people have children.

1012
00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:44.180
Here we go.
This is why.
So why procrastinate?

1013
00:58:44.181 --> 00:58:47.870

1031
00:59:45.261 --> 00:59:47.270

1032
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:51.780
<v 2>I like how they basically that that,
I mean,
I like,</v>

1033
00:59:51.790 --> 00:59:53.030
I like how that basically,

1034
00:59:53.031 --> 00:59:56.970
like they say everything in a roundabout way of basically,

1035
00:59:57.110 --> 00:59:59.830
<v 1>please don't trash my advertisers do it before you.
Oh wait,
wait.</v>

1036
00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:02.460
They're basically saying do it before your dad wasn't supposed to read legal

1037
01:00:02.461 --> 01:00:05.400
zone that I messed up.
So they got a free one in there.
That's a day.

1038
01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:10.260
That's why I keep saying it's national.
Make a will month.
Yeah.
Who has really,
no,

1039
01:00:10.261 --> 01:00:12.030
I didn't.
Uh,
well,
there's always something like,

1040
01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:13.890
I don't know what time I was in Atlanta and it was,

1041
01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:17.340
it was national blueberry pancake day,
you know,

1042
01:00:17.341 --> 01:00:20.280
from the people who bring you blueberries comes blueberry pancake day.

1043
01:00:20.281 --> 01:00:25.110
It's just like,
it's like naming a star,
except there's only 365.
All right,

1044
01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:28.160
let's,
let's move on here.
Where are we in the podcast?
Oh,
by the way,
how's the,

1045
01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:29.003

uh,

1046
01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:33.310
<v 2>she's looking good.
Did you peak?
Oh yeah,
I just peeked.
She's looking good.</v>

1047
01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:37.030
There's a little look in you.
We're right at two 75.
Well,

1048
01:00:37.031 --> 01:00:40.540
I wanted to make sure that the chips were needed.
Any we got,
you know,
we're a,

1049
01:00:40.541 --> 01:00:42.070
we're adding,
you know,

1050
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:46.730
<v 1>bull soaked apple chips to this bad boy.
We're smoking them.
Oh,</v>

1051
01:00:46.731 --> 01:00:49.670
what did you start with the apple?
You start with the APP?
Yeah.

1052
01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:53.220
Just sprinkle it with you to get some books.
I want it to smell back then.

1053
01:00:53.221 --> 01:00:55.250
We were back then it was some hickory.
Yeah.
Don't,

1054
01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:59.880
don't give me the cores light of smoke to fucking take,
but no.
Uh,

1055
01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:02.530
all right.
Need to stop being in nervous cunt.

1056
01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:06.380
This is going to be the last one here.
People,
uh,
Billy red face.
Love the podcast.

1057
01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:08.750
Oh,
speaking of red face,
the red state tour.

1058
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:13.200
It got splintered because of the acting work.
So flinor this,
but though,
but I,

1059
01:01:13.201 --> 01:01:14.420
I make it up,
all of them.

1060
01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:19.421
So this week is going to be a boulder and pikes peak on Wednesday and Friday.

1061
01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:23.010
Thursday we have off dump,
dump dump.

1062
01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:32.060
<v 2>I'm fine.
We're going,
we're going to the a Broncos,
a ravens game.</v>

1063
01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:35.900
But what are you in Vegas this weekend?
He wanted me to ask you.
He goes,

1064
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:38.450
cause you know when you're under the disguise,

1065
01:01:38.451 --> 01:01:41.720
I'm from Cleveland everybody originally if you haven't known that.

1066
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:44.570
But the funny thing is when I told my boys this weekend I was going to the

1067
01:01:44.571 --> 01:01:45.860
Broncos ravens game.

1068
01:01:45.861 --> 01:01:48.890
They're like well look this is the guy not like you because you know the ravens

1069
01:01:48.891 --> 01:01:53.120
for the browns and the Broncos like put it in our heart like nine times.

1070
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:56.440
But if it has nothing to do with that,

1071
01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.300
the actual Cleveland Brown franchise at this point.
You just hate the ravens.

1072
01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:03.680
Well because of the browns.
Yeah,
originally cause there's a brown shirt.
Gorgeous.

1073
01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.360
Yeah.
We still hate him because of that.

1074
01:02:05.361 --> 01:02:08.020
That's why we hate them and they're in our division and they,
they,

1075
01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.720
they've awesome new goes still ravens and win a super bowl twice.

1076
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:14.540
It w w you know what I mean?
That does,
does,

1077
01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:17.300
does Ozzie Newsome still work for them?
That's the problem.

1078
01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:21.870
He's the only guy that went with and he's been running that team and he had just

1079
01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:24.540
gotten the job.
Like he,
he was an ex player.

1080
01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:28.230
He had just gotten the job as president of football operations when we were in

1081
01:02:28.231 --> 01:02:31.230
Cleveland.
They leave town.
He goes,
he,
they got to see,

1082
01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:34.100
<v 1>do you know why you guys never get you?</v>

1083
01:02:34.101 --> 01:02:37.660
I don't know if he would want the attention cause I lived through it.
It sucks.

1084
01:02:37.661 --> 01:02:40.420
You don't want to be like,
Oh this sports misery capitol of the world.

1085
01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:45.550
The reason why you guys don't get the attention is because you're not rivals

1086
01:02:45.790 --> 01:02:50.500
with New York City.
Right.
I think that that's why we got what we did because,

1087
01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:55.660
uh,
was Yankees red sox and then like,
well you know what it was.

1088
01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:58.360
<v 2>We get a little bit of that because we're a Steeler rival.</v>

1089
01:02:58.361 --> 01:03:00.550
While we're not assigning an,
we would considered a rival any more.

1090
01:03:00.551 --> 01:03:03.070
The Pittsburgh doesn't even worry about us,
but we,
we,

1091
01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:08.071
the brown specifically do kind of have that moniker and the NFL kind of realm

1092
01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:11.110
because of that Steeler rivalry and they won six.

1093
01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:15.550
But you know what's crazy is if you go back and count NFL championships and

1094
01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:18.520
bowls combined,
we still have more.
We have seven NFL James.

1095
01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:23.130
<v 1>I think it's so ridiculous that they don't count NFL championships because the</v>

1096
01:03:23.131 --> 01:03:25.950
green bay packers or the Yankees a football.
Oh yeah.
They've,

1097
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:27.810
they've won in all areas.
They had a rough,

1098
01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.610
the 70s and eighties were rough for them.
All right.
When the Lynn Dickey,
yeah,

1099
01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:34.820
years.
But even then they had James lofty do.

1100
01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.230
At one point they had James Lofton and John Jefferson Grande.

1101
01:03:37.231 --> 01:03:42.231
They had nobody to throw the ball to one of the worst moves a player ever made.

1102
01:03:42.421 --> 01:03:46.200
John Jefferson said he went from the San Diego chargers Air Corre el would Dan

1103
01:03:46.201 --> 01:03:47.770
file,
Dan Fouts.

1104
01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:53.180
And he signed for more money to play in frozen fucking green bay.

1105
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:55.870
It wasn't Lynn Dickey at that point.
I forget who it was.

1106
01:03:55.871 --> 01:03:58.080
What was the thought that was before the magic man?

1107
01:03:58.890 --> 01:04:00.960
Whoever the fuck they had in between there,
they just,

1108
01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:05.850
they just went through a bad period.
Yeah.
And,
um,
he said,

1109
01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:09.150
he said if I stayed in San Diego,
uh,

1110
01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:12.900
Jerry Rice would be breaking all my records and I'm telling you don't it wasn't

1111
01:04:12.901 --> 01:04:17.370
line.
No,
no doubt he was,
he was unreal.
Him and I remember West Chandler,

1112
01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:20.580
oh west Chandler,
Chandler in that strike here with the Redskins won it.

1113
01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:24.180
He fucking,
uh,
he still had over a thousand yards.

1114
01:04:24.181 --> 01:04:25.780
That's how much they were throwing it.
Really?

1115
01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.520
Those guys only played like 12 games,
didn't it?
Less than that dude.

1116
01:04:29.521 --> 01:04:33.030
They played like eight or nine.
Eight or nine that the,
the the,

1117
01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:35.310
I want to say the Redskins were like eight and won that year.
Yeah.

1118
01:04:35.311 --> 01:04:38.490
Cause the scrubs played like four of them.
Right.
Or to whatever they call them.

1119
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.490
Oh,
is that that year that the scab scabs.
Yeah.
Yes.

1120
01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:48.120
Something that I find fascinating is just how like certain teams just,

1121
01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:52.380
they get new coaches,
they get new owners and blah,
blah blah.
But they just still,

1122
01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:55.710
there's this thing where they just like,

1123
01:04:55.711 --> 01:04:58.560
the giants will always just have a great defense.

1124
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.860
The bear is always have a good defense,
but they can't for the life of them.

1125
01:05:01.861 --> 01:05:06.660
The bears have never had a superstar quarterback.
Everett,
even Jim Mcmahon.

1126
01:05:06.661 --> 01:05:08.490
Jim Mcmahon was a personality.
He was,

1127
01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:12.870
he was downtown Julie Brown of quarterbacks.
Right.

1128
01:05:12.871 --> 01:05:16.470
Like more like a social life.
Yeah.
I would put him,
he couldn't jump.

1129
01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:19.150
I know people couldn't carry you on his back and the fourth quarter,

1130
01:05:19.151 --> 01:05:22.420
like an la or a Montana.
He wasn't that kind of a,
they've never had that.

1131
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:26.770
Cleveland Auto Graham maybe was your last superstar.
Bernie was tough.
Man.

1132
01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:31.450
[inaudible] was good.
But yeah,
really,
I mean,
we had a Frank Ryan,

1133
01:05:31.451 --> 01:05:33.670
a lot of people forget.
People Forget.
Frank rang.

1134
01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:38.560
Brian Sipe won an MVP in 81 almost wondered again in 82.
Um,

1135
01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:43.780
Frank Ryan was great.
Frank Ryan,
I believe site Rick Springfield.
Same Guy.

1136
01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:46.630
I'm telling you.
Same Guy.
When I,
my head,

1137
01:05:46.631 --> 01:05:50.440
when I think of them per Frank Ryan though,
a lot of people don't realize,

1138
01:05:50.441 --> 01:05:53.620
I think Frank Ryan has the greatest winning percentage of any starting

1139
01:05:53.621 --> 01:05:56.290
quarterback in the history of the NFL.
He came after Otto Graham,

1140
01:05:56.291 --> 01:05:58.660
but he was winning Paul Brown.
They were still winning titles.

1141
01:05:58.661 --> 01:06:00.820
It's like just winning titles left and right all the time.

1142
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:06.340
I believe had bill Bellacheck for one year.
Last time we won a playoff game.

1143
01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:09.220
The last time we won a game,

1144
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:14.670
we beat the New England Patriots and Bill Belichick was our coach the last time

1145
01:06:14.921 --> 01:06:18.490
94 I was at that game,
wildcard game in Cleveland Stadium.

1146
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:23.180
The last time we have won a playoff,
we'd be who do you like?
Who Do you like?
Uh,

1147
01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:26.910
what do you think?
Pate manning.
Wes Welker.
I love that match.

1148
01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:31.930
Why leave veterans and I think we're going to see if like a 45 38 or Thursday

1149
01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:36.020
night.
Yeah,
I think so.
Yeah.
I can Flaco they can put a dude,
bro.

1150
01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:38.140
Baltimore's going to put up some points this year.
They're going to have to,

1151
01:06:38.141 --> 01:06:40.150
cause at defense ain't going to be as good as it used to be.

1152
01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:44.620
We're gonna see a ball game.
Yeah,
but it's Flaco that good Flacko is that good?

1153
01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:46.090
You think you can put it in numbers like that?

1154
01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:47.790
I'm not saying he's not a good quarterback cause I think he's a,

1155
01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:50.140
he's a good quote.
I didn't believe in him forever and I was wrong.

1156
01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:53.740
That playoff run man.
I think that played out and showed it.
But is he like,

1157
01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:58.580
he's going to go fucking touchdown for touchdown against Manny?
Well maybe.

1158
01:06:58.590 --> 01:07:01.060
I mean maybe,
maybe not all season long,
but in this game,

1159
01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:03.960
you know what's funny about manning is like everybody was looking at like,

1160
01:07:03.961 --> 01:07:07.300
he was a little fragile China doll and now,
now that he made the season,

1161
01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:10.450
nobody's even thinking about it.
Like he keep one hit.

1162
01:07:10.451 --> 01:07:11.890
They was showing his spinal cord.

1163
01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:15.880
This guy could never walk again and now nobody's,
nobody's talking about it.

1164
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.180
Some of them are predicting them doing the MVP award this year.

1165
01:07:19.181 --> 01:07:24.181
Longest neck since the program is another coach named Steve Grogan to deep

1166
01:07:25.570 --> 01:07:28.850
Grogan had to wear like two neck braces.
Just the pile them up.
Yeah.

1167
01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:29.500
Well they have,

1168
01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.260
they have all that flesh between the shoulder pads and the helmet.

1169
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:36.030
You have like two or three of them on top of each other.
We'll see.

1170
01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:39.800
I think they're going to have,
they're going to,
oh,
this is my prediction on a,
uh,

1171
01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:40.953
Tim Tebow.

1172
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:44.680
Tim Tebow is to get cut and he's going to go to the CFL is going to become a

1173
01:07:44.681 --> 01:07:48.250
superstar up there like Doug Flutie did and he's going to come back the end of

1174
01:07:48.251 --> 01:07:51.840
his career either with Buffalo,
with the bears.
Really?
That's my prediction.

1175
01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:54.990
He's going to the CFL.
CFL.
Yes sir.
You heard it here tonight?

1176
01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:56.840
Monday morning podcast.
Yeah.

1177
01:07:56.860 --> 01:08:00.310
He'll be able to and be able to run around because that feels like a hundred

1178
01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:03.010
yards in both directions.
Right?
Or meters,
whatever the fuck they say.

1179
01:08:03.011 --> 01:08:07.640
It's 110 long and I think 60 wide to see.

1180
01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:09.970
See what I'm saying?
Just when you guys thought I was a sports fan,

1181
01:08:09.971 --> 01:08:12.480
this is why I go to him.
He,
he fucking knows everything.
All right.

1182
01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:16.440
Need to stop being a nervous cut.
Billy red face loved the podcast.
Uh,

1183
01:08:16.441 --> 01:08:20.570
as soon as I have a need for any of the services that are advertising your show,

1184
01:08:20.571 --> 01:08:24.560
I'll make sure I go there was okay.
Thank you.
Um,
this may not rate Jesus.

1185
01:08:24.561 --> 01:08:25.850
Get to the fucking point.

1186
01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:30.140
I'm dying a slow death working a day job that isn't fun anymore.

1187
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:35.240
The money's great.
I'm 32 and make a mid six figure salary,
but like you,

1188
01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:39.230
I'm not really motivated by more money.
I would much rather,
okay.

1189
01:08:39.231 --> 01:08:40.970
I dream on a daily basis.

1190
01:08:40.971 --> 01:08:45.620
He wrote that all in capital letters about doing comedy full time.
All right,
Jay,

1191
01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:49.190
this guy's making mid six figures.
He's 32 years.

1192
01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:55.140
<v 2>You can have,
I got 45 minutes.
You can take it right now.
Give me the wool.</v>

1193
01:08:55.150 --> 01:08:56.650
Mid Six figures.
I'm gone.

1194
01:08:56.750 --> 01:09:01.190
<v 1>Uh,
standup,
Improv,
sketch,
performing,
writing,</v>

1195
01:09:01.191 --> 01:09:05.270
producing.
I'd love to do it all.
I'd love to do it all all the time.

1196
01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:09.590
But the flip side of not being motivated by more money is being motivated by the

1197
01:09:09.591 --> 01:09:13.820
fear of not having enough.
See,
I'm a nervous condition as you would say.

1198
01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:17.900
I will do once you're making mid six figures in your 32 years old,

1199
01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:22.040
you're not nervous.
You're,
you're also kind of rational.
Okay.

1200
01:09:22.330 --> 01:09:23.120
You'd like,

1201
01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:27.050
that's why you try and start as young as you can because you stepping off a curb

1202
01:09:27.051 --> 01:09:30.620
rather than a fucking three story building at this point that you own and have

1203
01:09:30.621 --> 01:09:35.000
tenants in.
Um,
that is there till I was 31.
Yeah,
no,
no,
no.

1204
01:09:35.001 --> 01:09:39.470
Absolutely.
And what's his face?
Retired,
um,
Dangerfield and he came back.

1205
01:09:39.471 --> 01:09:41.090
I'm not discouraging the guy.
I'm just saying that

1206
01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.770
<v 2>not when I wasn't making six figures,</v>

1207
01:09:43.771 --> 01:09:46.860
I don't think I would have just jumped off the curve for that.
Right,
right,
right.

1208
01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:50.470
<v 1>He's,
look,
he,
he's,
he's,
he's not nervous.
That's what I'm saying.</v>

1209
01:09:50.471 --> 01:09:53.430
He's thinking rationally.
So anyways,
he goes,
see I'm,

1210
01:09:53.431 --> 01:09:56.500
I'm a nervous cons as you would say with the New Jersey Mortgage,

1211
01:09:56.530 --> 01:09:59.950
Aka the land of high taxes bills and a three year old daughter.

1212
01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.820
I can't bring myself to cut and run from the corporate country.
I work in,

1213
01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:07.150
my wife and I have no debt other than the mortgage do.
That's great.

1214
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:12.250
That's great man.
And we generally live below our income level.
That's also great.

1215
01:10:12.251 --> 01:10:13.800
Those are two things you need to do,

1216
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:15.370
<v 2>which people don't do any more than that.
Yeah,</v>

1217
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:17.400
<v 1>you really need to do that,
man.
Uh,</v>

1218
01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:22.340
but I don't think we live at or below the income that we'd have if I stop

1219
01:10:22.341 --> 01:10:26.740
killing myself on a daily basis by commuting to a fucking computer instead of

1220
01:10:26.741 --> 01:10:30.130
community to a couch with a laptop and a giant cup of coffee just to work on

1221
01:10:30.131 --> 01:10:34.570
comedy ship.
I love Shit.
I love how he's,
he's romanticizing being comedian.
Yeah.

1222
01:10:34.810 --> 01:10:36.850
Although he's kind of right.
Um,

1223
01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:41.860
it's more coming out of your pajamas with a hangover trying to figure out how to

1224
01:10:41.861 --> 01:10:45.370
get dealt with fucking whatever you picked up that night out of your hotel room

1225
01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:51.040
and then going downstairs and having a greasy breakfast to fucking,
I dunno.

1226
01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:51.850
Anyways,

1227
01:10:51.850 --> 01:10:56.050
I have no frame of reference to know how much money could be made or how long it

1228
01:10:56.051 --> 01:10:57.040
would take to make it.

1229
01:10:57.250 --> 01:11:00.970
And I'm scared shitless that I don't have the talent or the balls or both to

1230
01:11:00.971 --> 01:11:05.680
actually get paid to make people laugh in spite of believing in [inaudible].

1231
01:11:06.850 --> 01:11:09.490
All right.
My friends sent me to practice,
practice calming shit.
Dude.

1232
01:11:09.491 --> 01:11:12.250
I can get right to the end of this.
All right.
This is what you gotta do.

1233
01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:18.450
You do both.
Don't quit your fucking job.
This is what you do,
right?

1234
01:11:18.451 --> 01:11:23.070
Five minutes of material and go sign up for an open mic and try standup comedy.

1235
01:11:23.730 --> 01:11:24.563
Okay?

1236
01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:28.860
That way if you go up and you eat your fucking balls and you hated it and it was

1237
01:11:28.861 --> 01:11:31.080
humiliating and you don't ever want to do it again,

1238
01:11:31.230 --> 01:11:33.390
you're not going to be sitting at your cubicle going,

1239
01:11:33.391 --> 01:11:37.950
what if you're going to be like,
no,
I tried it.
I bombed and I didn't like it.

1240
01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:43.160
Now if you go down there and you go up and even if you bomb but you still like

1241
01:11:46.141 --> 01:11:50.010
it,
you know,
which is a major fucking sign.

1242
01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.230
If you bomb and you still like,
I want to come back.

1243
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:56.790
Then just keep coming back and keep doing that and just balancing it out.

1244
01:11:57.270 --> 01:12:00.690
And I,
but I,
you need to have a major talk with your wife and just say,
listen,

1245
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:04.830
this is going to kill me if I never try this.
I,
but I promise to you,

1246
01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:08.640
I promise you that there's going to be no let down me as a husband or a father

1247
01:12:08.641 --> 01:12:10.770
here.
Um,
but there will be,
you know,

1248
01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:15.120
a couple of nights a month at first just to see.

1249
01:12:15.121 --> 01:12:18.650
I just have to know.
Okay.
And um,

1250
01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:23.250
then if she goes,
well,
you're making mid six figures and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

1251
01:12:23.251 --> 01:12:23.940
blah,
blah.

1252
01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:28.940
That's when you start pointing out all the morons that you listen to one podcast

1253
01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:33.120
that are making fucking money in this business.
Okay.
And I'm telling you,
dude,

1254
01:12:33.121 --> 01:12:37.500
if I can do it,
anybody can fucking find a place.
Uh,
well,
not anybody.

1255
01:12:37.501 --> 01:12:40.370
You know what I mean?
If you have any sort of fucking talent,
you can do it.
Jay,

1256
01:12:40.371 --> 01:12:40.840
I've worked,

1257
01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:44.330
<v 2>Stu,
I'd like to say real quick before you say that,</v>

1258
01:12:44.690 --> 01:12:47.360
because he's mentioned money a couple of times like these,
like I,

1259
01:12:47.361 --> 01:12:48.141
and then I don't know,

1260
01:12:48.141 --> 01:12:51.620
I don't have any frame of reference of how much money I could make if I could

1261
01:12:51.621 --> 01:12:54.320
make any or Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.
The one thing is you can't,

1262
01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:58.700
I don't think you can worry about that going into it because you know,

1263
01:12:58.701 --> 01:13:00.640
you've seen them every day in the clubs,

1264
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:05.600
in La and everywhere else within five or seven years you can be a millionaire

1265
01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:08.510
and then you know what,
five or seven years after that,
nobody wants to work you.

1266
01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:10.730
I mean cause it's a,
it's a,
but then

1267
01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.040
<v 1>all goes down to what he was talking about and it goes,</v>

1268
01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:17.910
it goes all down to that living within your means,
paying down your house,

1269
01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:22.020
not carrying credit card debt.
Like,
dude,
I to fuck these fucking people.
Yeah.

1270
01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:24.110
<v 2>Doesn't mean that you don't get smart doing that.</v>

1271
01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:27.540
And then still not this people die in five years after you were making a
million.

1272
01:13:27.541 --> 01:13:29.580
You know what I mean?
In this business,
in this business,

1273
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.460
<v 1>people in the NFL,
in the NFL,
NBA,</v>

1274
01:13:32.461 --> 01:13:36.780
and in show business with their own TV shows living paycheck to paycheck because

1275
01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:41.280
they're doing the exact same fucking thing that you do just at a much grander

1276
01:13:41.281 --> 01:13:44.850
scale.
And everybody goes,
how the fuck could you fuck that up?
And you know,

1277
01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.880
most people saying that are doing it at that look at their level now it's,

1278
01:13:50.011 --> 01:13:51.990
look,
if you,
if you have not making any fucking money,

1279
01:13:51.991 --> 01:13:53.760
I get living paycheck to paycheck.

1280
01:13:53.761 --> 01:13:57.210
But if you know you don't need that extra pair of sneakers,

1281
01:13:57.211 --> 01:14:00.330
you don't need another flat screen TV.
You don't even need a fucking TV.

1282
01:14:00.331 --> 01:14:04.260
There's ways you got to get out in front of it.
Yeah.
If,
if when you're young,

1283
01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:09.000
you got to start building up a fucking nest egg and you got to get on the

1284
01:14:09.001 --> 01:14:10.020
Internet,
read some books,

1285
01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:15.080
figure out how fucking evil the game is so you at least know how it's played.

1286
01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:20.380
So you can like take on as little water as you can and he can fucking stay

1287
01:14:20.381 --> 01:14:21.214
afloat because,

1288
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.440
because you know there's a lot of people want to do other things in there.

1289
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:31.420
They just got a ball and chain around their fucking neck and it financially and

1290
01:14:31.421 --> 01:14:32.860
they just got themselves in this thing.

1291
01:14:32.861 --> 01:14:36.490
So if you're in that situation just immediately start fucking dude,

1292
01:14:36.491 --> 01:14:40.030
I ever have a yard sale and just start selling shit,
downsize in my life.

1293
01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:44.860
And if I had to take two years off from fucking live in the the American dream

1294
01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:47.950
and just paying myself down and getting out of that fucking debt,

1295
01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:51.580
I would do it and I would start over again because that shit,

1296
01:14:51.581 --> 01:14:52.780
oh fucking keep you up at night

1297
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:56.790
<v 2>said,
I mean this guy talks so he's like,
you know,
he is going to make money but,</v>

1298
01:14:56.791 --> 01:15:01.540
but what I'm saying is like just be aware of the idea of the money of it isn't

1299
01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:02.100
why,

1300
01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:06.780
because maybe anxiety make making mid six figures in what he's doing.

1301
01:15:06.930 --> 01:15:09.450
95% of the times you can't go backwards.

1302
01:15:09.451 --> 01:15:13.260
Usually we'll probably what he does for living at,
once he hits one 50 year,

1303
01:15:13.410 --> 01:15:17.550
the next step is one 65 to 200 year.
That's not the formula.

1304
01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:21.420
In standup comedy,
you can make one 52 years in a row and guess what?

1305
01:15:21.421 --> 01:15:23.700
By year four,
you're making 45.
No,

1306
01:15:23.701 --> 01:15:25.770
but this is the great thing about standup comedy though.

1307
01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.500
Or you can make 2 million,
no boards.

1308
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:30.900
What's great about standup comedy though is you never unemployed.
True.

1309
01:15:30.930 --> 01:15:33.750
You're never unemployed.
You never employed and less,

1310
01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:39.140
<v 1>but unless you,
you want to,
uh,
unless your ego gets in the way where like say,</v>

1311
01:15:39.170 --> 01:15:43.190
you know,
you were selling,
selling out clubs,
you know,

1312
01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:45.350
so you just come in and do on Thursday through Saturday,

1313
01:15:45.351 --> 01:15:46.490
I'm not doing the Sunday show.

1314
01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:48.530
If it starts to taper off and they want you to do too,

1315
01:15:48.531 --> 01:15:51.290
the Sunday show and you refuse to do it and you start doing that shit rather

1316
01:15:51.291 --> 01:15:53.360
than being like,
I got to get it going again,
then,

1317
01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:58.010
then you can get yourself in fucking trouble.
But like,
um,
you know,

1318
01:15:58.011 --> 01:15:59.300
I don't know how actors do it.

1319
01:15:59.301 --> 01:16:02.110
I don't know how musicians do what that Shit's fucking Harper being a standup

1320
01:16:02.150 --> 01:16:05.870
comic.
Once you start,
you know,
you've established yourself,

1321
01:16:05.871 --> 01:16:07.160
you've made a name for yourself.

1322
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:11.150
If you never take your foot off the gas pedal and you just keep pushing yourself

1323
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:13.200
and you keep doing that,
like you,

1324
01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:17.930
you can have the closest thing to job security.
But even in his world,
dude,

1325
01:16:17.931 --> 01:16:20.700
like they could downsize.
They should fucking kick him out.
And then he,

1326
01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:24.140
then he's at that weird age.
So,
dude,
this is my advice.
Don't quit your job.

1327
01:16:24.141 --> 01:16:25.850
But I would definitely just start doing it.

1328
01:16:25.851 --> 01:16:30.851
And there's nothing wrong if you always keep your job and you just do standup

1329
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:32.090
because you like doing it,

1330
01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:35.630
or you started a sketch group with your friends and just have fun.
Um,

1331
01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:38.000
and don't listen to any other comedians who were saying like,

1332
01:16:38.001 --> 01:16:42.110
you're taking my stage time.
It isn't their stage time.
All right?
It's an art.

1333
01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:43.610
It doesn't belong to anybody.

1334
01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.340
It's supposed to make you happy and other people happy when you do it.
So that,

1335
01:16:47.341 --> 01:16:50.090
that's what I would do.
All right,
so good luck to you,
sir.

1336
01:16:50.091 --> 01:16:52.950
You're not a nervous cons.
Okay.
You're a fucking normal human being.

1337
01:16:52.951 --> 01:16:56.840
Stop being hard on yourself.
So there you go.
There's the podcast for this week.

1338
01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:00.250
I'm like,
I mentioned,
uh,
me and Jason Lawhead,

1339
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:02.950
we're going to be at the boulder theater in boulder.
I believe that's,

1340
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:05.180
<v 2>I can't even wait to say that word when I get there.</v>

1341
01:17:05.181 --> 01:17:08.900
Isn't that the girl that's like a voiceovers dream is boulder that can go from

1342
01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:10.640
like a beer commercial

1343
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.830
<v 1>all the way to like a murder mystery show.</v>

1344
01:17:12.831 --> 01:17:17.620
Like that quiet town of boulder who was murdered.

1345
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:19.070
Or You could be like,
you know,

1346
01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:22.850
when we were the Rockies with cold water or bold or you know,

1347
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:25.910
like you have a watch that shit when they'd sit there and uh,

1348
01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:30.770
I love those murder mystery shows
and they'd just be like,

1349
01:17:31.330 --> 01:17:33.110
it was a quiet town.
That's my dream

1350
01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:39.410
for the July.
But the underbelly,
I want to do that every day.

1351
01:17:39.970 --> 01:17:43.030
That's how you doing the downturn.

1352
01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:48.440
This wasn't supposed to happen in this town.

1353
01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:51.740
A town where they keep the doors are locked at night.

1354
01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:57.560
You knew your neighbor.
People sat on porches,

1355
01:17:57.561 --> 01:18:01.000
drinking tulip bothers the perfect name for,
oh,

1356
01:18:01.001 --> 01:18:05.960
that's a voiceover three boulder,
Colorado,
September 4th pikes peak center,

1357
01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:09.570
Colorado Springs on the sixth look for me and Jason were a,

1358
01:18:09.650 --> 01:18:12.290
we're going to be looking for a tailgate.
If you guys have any information,

1359
01:18:12.291 --> 01:18:12.681
if you got,

1360
01:18:12.681 --> 01:18:16.790
if you throw it down and you do it right and you got some extra Breskit or

1361
01:18:16.791 --> 01:18:19.580
something and I'll be cheering for the Broncos cause all the years I cheered

1362
01:18:19.581 --> 01:18:21.500
against them when they were playing the actual browns.

1363
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:25.010
Now they're playing the old browns who are my division and I will definitely be

1364
01:18:25.011 --> 01:18:28.880
cheering for the Broncos because I've been so mean to Peyton manning over the

1365
01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:28.881
years.

1366
01:18:28.881 --> 01:18:32.390
And now you get that thing where you're getting sentimental cause he's in the

1367
01:18:32.391 --> 01:18:36.590
final third and yet you don't.
That's like doctor Jay.
I didn't hate him as much.

1368
01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:39.320
Magic [inaudible] Jeter,

1369
01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:42.600
I hated Jordan killed us and as he got older I'm like Ha,

1370
01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:44.580
I'm going to miss that guy.
Yeah.
Am I saying that guy?
Yeah.

1371
01:18:44.581 --> 01:18:48.650
So the paint that I've ever had with Lebron,
but I missed due to flip Ron.

1372
01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:51.140
They talk about Lebron look coming back to clean.

1373
01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.630
No going to the Lakers as a joke over.

1374
01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.890
If he goes to the Lakers and that championship is celebrating,

1375
01:18:58.030 --> 01:19:00.350
then you know what I want.
You know what,
you know what they should do.

1376
01:19:00.650 --> 01:19:05.540
They should literally have like the pregame for that should literally be like

1377
01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:08.540
eighth graders playing first graders and tackle football

1378
01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:14.990
and then doing long fucking interviews with the eighth graders when they won.

1379
01:19:14.991 --> 01:19:18.140
Talking about coming together as a team and all that type of shit.

1380
01:19:18.141 --> 01:19:20.800
I'm telling you dude,
like who got a Lakers when,

1381
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:24.200
where some stupid number like 49 or something.
You know what I mean?

1382
01:19:24.201 --> 01:19:26.480
Like you know,
just I,
it'll be just the worst.

1383
01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:29.470
It's what sports has become and your,

1384
01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:34.480
I saw some more on it was trying to say that pile on teams are not a new thing.

1385
01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.640
It was so dumb.
He like,

1386
01:19:36.650 --> 01:19:40.550
he was trying to sit there saying like talking about like those Laker teams in

1387
01:19:40.551 --> 01:19:44.630
the 80s and the Celtics like to those teams were built,
built.
Yeah.

1388
01:19:44.631 --> 01:19:46.360
Two trades and traps.
They,

1389
01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:50.450
it wasn't like magic and James Worthy sat on a yacht during the off season
going,

1390
01:19:50.451 --> 01:19:54.700
hey man,
what'd be great if we all played in same team fucking moron.
The Guy,

1391
01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:56.840
this guy at the top 10 sports myths.

1392
01:19:56.841 --> 01:19:59.850
And he tried to say that that was his pet pile on teams where sports Smith,

1393
01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:00.551
it was an end.

1394
01:20:00.551 --> 01:20:04.430
Go back and look at the teams that didn't win it in those areas that were built

1395
01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:08.400
the,
I watched the hardwood classics a couple of weeks ago.
They had the 1985

1396
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:12.360
<v 2>all star game on the Milwaukee Bucks had four guys on the eastern,
all stars,</v>

1397
01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:14.670
they won't.
Seventh Street,
seventh straight,

1398
01:20:14.671 --> 01:20:17.900
50 win seasons off built through the draft and trade.

1399
01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:19.210
<v 1>And this is what the guy was saying though,</v>

1400
01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:23.710
his justification that they were pylon teams despite the fact nobody piled on,

1401
01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:27.970
was that in the,
in the 80s the Lakers,
the Celtics,

1402
01:20:27.971 --> 01:20:30.700
the sixers and the Pistons were the only ones who won championships.

1403
01:20:30.701 --> 01:20:34.030
Everybody else was without.
And he goes,
so it was,

1404
01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:37.360
it was good for the league and that's in it's complete bullshit because what

1405
01:20:37.361 --> 01:20:41.170
they didn't realize was that despite the fact that the bucks never came through,

1406
01:20:41.171 --> 01:20:42.640
they had Sidney Moncrief.
Yep.

1407
01:20:42.730 --> 01:20:45.400
<v 2>Jack Sigma,
Terri Cummings,
Jack [inaudible].</v>

1408
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:49.570
Pressy what Jackson was on them was on the,
uh,
the signup for it.
But no,

1409
01:20:49.571 --> 01:20:53.160
he came to the box in the mid eighties.
Honix he was in,
uh,
he was,
uh,
uh,

1410
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:58.020
<v 1>um,
he came to the box back then.
Back then you had,</v>

1411
01:20:58.021 --> 01:21:03.021
you had blockbuster trades like when Moses Malone went to the sixers did,

1412
01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.330
there would be in a k or we're Kareem went to the Lakers,

1413
01:21:06.331 --> 01:21:10.230
but there wasn't like what happened in Boston.

1414
01:21:10.231 --> 01:21:11.600
We're just overnight too.

1415
01:21:11.610 --> 01:21:15.330
We went from the worst team in the League to winning the championship and we

1416
01:21:15.331 --> 01:21:19.650
fucking go.
We got Kevin Garnett for nothing from Kevin Mchale.

1417
01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:23.860
That should have been investigated the same way.
The way the Lakers got,
uh,
uh,

1418
01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:27.860
Pau Gasol and Jerry Jerry West was,
was with fucking,
uh,

1419
01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:32.510
is that who it was was with the fucking
Grizzle Grizzlies?
Yeah.

1420
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:37.220
Like both those trades were complete
behind enemy lines.
Bullshit.

1421
01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:41.070
And then we got ram round.
That's why I wasn't upset when when ray went to Miami,

1422
01:21:41.071 --> 01:21:43.260
I was like,
we'll do,
that's how we got him.
He wasn't ours.

1423
01:21:43.290 --> 01:21:47.070
He wasn't a Celtic keep it.
I still look at him like he's one of the great,

1424
01:21:47.730 --> 01:21:50.510
the great step played for the organization,
but it's,

1425
01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:54.810
it's a different thing where he was like the,
you become like a mercenary.

1426
01:21:54.811 --> 01:21:56.280
Like they just,
they're bringing you in.

1427
01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:59.330
<v 2>A couple of weeks ago,
Lebron had that,
there was this big news that he takes,</v>

1428
01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:02.110
he's going to add another hour to the podcast.
I'll end with this.

1429
01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.101
A couple of weeks ago,

1430
01:22:03.101 --> 01:22:07.420
Lebron had this big news where he tweeted out his top three players of all
times.

1431
01:22:07.421 --> 01:22:10.710
I,
some big publication tweeted at him like,
Hey Lebron,

1432
01:22:10.730 --> 01:22:12.340
you've never talked about that.
Tada.

1433
01:22:12.341 --> 01:22:14.680
So everybody would on the edge of their seat,
what's his big dream?

1434
01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:17.350
So he named it,
I'm not going to be mad at the list in a,

1435
01:22:17.351 --> 01:22:21.010
in a way because it's hard.
It's so subjective.
Three players really.
He said,

1436
01:22:21.011 --> 01:22:22.990
Larry Bird,
which I thought that was pretty cool.

1437
01:22:23.050 --> 01:22:25.300
Birds a bit greatest small forward in the history of the game.

1438
01:22:25.301 --> 01:22:28.350
I don't know if I'd put them on the greatest three lists.
Uh,
he said,
uh,

1439
01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:31.960
Michael Jordan.
Yeah,
that's great.
That's easy.
And Doctor Jay,
I love Doctor J.

1440
01:22:31.961 --> 01:22:36.490
That's great.
Maybe that's easy,
but how do I tweet back to them?
I go,
really key.

1441
01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:41.650
How do you leave Kareem off the list?
I got a guy won six titles,

1442
01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:45.220
<v 1>one of which in Milwaukee,
the boot.
I go,</v>

1443
01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:47.340
that's kind of like a guy winning one in Cleveland.

1444
01:22:50.130 --> 01:22:53.790
<v 2>Wow.
That'd be like if somebody won't want to Cleveland is what I said.</v>

1445
01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:57.060
I said he won one in Milwaukee to boot.
How many have they won since?

1446
01:22:57.061 --> 01:22:59.700
That'd be like somebody wanted one in Cleveland.
That's what I tweeted at him.

1447
01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:02.490
Jesus quest.
Very clever way of saying,

1448
01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:05.360
well thanks for thanks for leaving and buddy.
Exactly.

1449
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:08.560
But I like Dr j because I love dogs.

1450
01:23:08.670 --> 01:23:12.650
<v 1>This is why,
because the big thing with me is changing the game.
Yes.</v>

1451
01:23:12.710 --> 01:23:16.080
And like it's fine and I'm fine with that.
Bet It does list.
I'm just saying,

1452
01:23:16.081 --> 01:23:19.360
how do you leave Karimov cream cheese?
Well,
that's the thing.

1453
01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:22.890
Don't buy off basketball.
If I only had three,

1454
01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:25.950
I would have to pick three guys who changed the game.
So it would be Jordan,

1455
01:23:25.951 --> 01:23:30.100
it would be Dr j,
and then I would have to be somebody else that I,

1456
01:23:30.210 --> 01:23:34.000
I'm not aware of from the 60s,
like a Russell.
I mean,
I mean you get,

1457
01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:37.770
was it Oscar Robinson who scored all the points?
Yeah,
yeah.
Ask Her was great.

1458
01:23:37.771 --> 01:23:40.980
I mean,
people don't realize how great Bob Pettit was.
I mean,
Bob Pettit was,
uh,

1459
01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:44.000
uh,
I know that there's somebody from that era because that's,

1460
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:47.220
that's one of those things with like standup where you had like,

1461
01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:51.300
like what Lenny Bruce did took it to,
first of all,
you had the Vaudeville guys,

1462
01:23:51.301 --> 01:23:53.640
whoever the first guys to do that.
Then you have the Lenny Bruce did.

1463
01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:57.840
Then you had what prior did and what prior did I feel is like what Jordan did,

1464
01:23:57.841 --> 01:24:01.990
what?
There's just some guys that they're geniuses at such a level that it's you,

1465
01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:05.670
it's,
you can't surpass it.
Yeah.
It's,
they almost take it to the end.

1466
01:24:05.671 --> 01:24:09.280
I would say like James Brown,
James Brown,
the,

1467
01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:13.440
the music that he made.
There's been a zillion funk bands after him,

1468
01:24:13.441 --> 01:24:16.650
but nobody ever took it to another level.
Yeah.
Never.

1469
01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:20.570
<v 2>Jabar I don't know how you can leave tomorrow,
if any.
Was He changed the game?</v>

1470
01:24:20.571 --> 01:24:24.440
He changed it.
He,
he,
he won six titles.
Magic.
Never one on one with a holiday.

1471
01:24:24.441 --> 01:24:27.920
I know.
Was older player ever to win?
How did he change the game?

1472
01:24:27.921 --> 01:24:30.830
Change the game by,
well,
first off they outlawed dunking.

1473
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.350
<v 1>Right.
But because of what it will Chamberlain NBA too though because of,</v>

1474
01:24:35.530 --> 01:24:39.190
uh,
they,
well,
here's how he changed the game.

1475
01:24:39.810 --> 01:24:40.650
<v 2>All the ends of the floor.</v>

1476
01:24:40.651 --> 01:24:44.280
He was Russell Russell couldn't do what Jabar did on the offensive end.

1477
01:24:44.490 --> 01:24:46.830
You can say wilt Chamberlain.
Yeah,
he was dominant,

1478
01:24:47.010 --> 01:24:50.280
but because they moved Jabar away from the basket,

1479
01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:52.620
Chamberlin couldn't do anything away from the basket.

1480
01:24:52.621 --> 01:24:55.890
Jabbar developed the Skyhook from 20 feet out and he was just,

1481
01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.360
he was Russell on both ends of the court.

1482
01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:02.540
And Russell couldn't play offensively like Jabar could it not even close Jabbar.

1483
01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:06.330
The fact that he won oldest man ever to win a finals MVP award.

1484
01:25:06.331 --> 01:25:07.260
The guy won the NBA,

1485
01:25:07.410 --> 01:25:12.400
he won the NBA Finals Mvp at 38 I mean come on man.
In a young dude,

1486
01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:16.200
I'm not arguing with you.
I just like Karen.
Like seriously dude,
like got what's,

1487
01:25:16.201 --> 01:25:18.660
what's the name of your podcast?
By law heads court.
Yeah.

1488
01:25:18.661 --> 01:25:21.840
If you want to listen to a guy who really knows sports as opposed to me being

1489
01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:26.420
Brady Anderson calling in tomorrow,
former Oriel Brady Anderson,
first guy first.

1490
01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:29.820
The guy that hit 50.
So it should be an interesting conversation.

1491
01:25:29.821 --> 01:25:34.170
I met Brady at the Hollywood improv a few weeks ago.
Got Em in cause great duty.

1492
01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:38.270
You remember,
you know Dan Godfrey from uh,
Irvine and proper,
but Dan big orange.

1493
01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:39.511
So I'm,
I'm the,

1494
01:25:39.511 --> 01:25:42.240
I'm ducking in there a couple of weeks ago cause I hear a tells in towels.

1495
01:25:42.241 --> 01:25:44.200
I was over at the kind of store so I decant,

1496
01:25:44.250 --> 01:25:47.370
I wanted to see David [inaudible] said,
well the place is packed.
Quick story,

1497
01:25:47.610 --> 01:25:50.820
there's a line and you know the door guy I know works at implant.

1498
01:25:50.821 --> 01:25:52.850
I'm just squeezing by going like,
Hey,
I'm going to go on the bar and,

1499
01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:54.240
and try to peek my head in and see a towel.

1500
01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.340
And there's this girl like arguing with the door guy.
She's like,
well,

1501
01:25:56.341 --> 01:25:59.610

He's like,

It's,

He said,

1502
01:25:59.611 --> 01:26:01.980
well,
my brother and I look over as,
I'm like squeaking by.

1503
01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:05.570
I looked and she's with Anderson,
I can pick out an athlete.
He right.

1504
01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:08.570
He ended his career as an Indian and I met him in Cleveland one time,

1505
01:26:08.571 --> 01:26:11.060
just down in the flats after a game.
He was a cool guy,
so what'd you do?

1506
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:14.140
So I was like,
so she's arguing.
So I was just like,
hey man,
how you doing?

1507
01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.940
He's like,
Hey,

Jason.
And he's like,
he's like,

1509
01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:22.550
and then she goes,
