00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.850
Hey,

00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:07.170
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,
uh,

3
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:11.060
December 10th,
2012 as it going,

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.320

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.900

Um,

6
00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:19.950
and we're going to get right to it cause he's already bugging me with this

7
00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:21.240
fucking giant shirt.

8
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:25.560
We have the one and only Michael Rappaport from every film that you've ever

9
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:29.190
Fuckin Huh?
Nice to a nice to have you on here.

10
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.990
You're reinventing the podcast cause you just said podcasts,
your accent.

11
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.270
The p a wd cast.
Yeah.

12
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.070
And I'm talking shit about accents.
That's the,
uh,
that's the Boston podcast.

13
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:45.250
I know,
but I like that.
That's the Boston accent.
I know.
I got it.
No,
I got it.

14
00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:49.050
It goes,
a lot of people when they do that,
you actually pick up on that,

15
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:53.430
that it's that we say pa,
WWE,
we say Boston,
ba w like Boston.

16
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.680
And people always go,
where are you from?
And I say,
you know,

17
00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:59.520
I grew up outside of Boston and they go,
oh,
fasting.
It's like,
no dude.

18
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:03.560
Boston like saw would be no,
I gotcha.
Yeah,

19
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.960
I know I'm not wanting to talk about accents,
but I I like,

20
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:08.550
I like the Boston accent.

21
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.280
I like it cause it's more fucked up than the New York accent.

22
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:14.130
That's why I like this.
All the pens,
it all depends.

23
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:17.300
I can tell you that I have to adjust these levels.
So not oranges,

24
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.270
but I do like the,

25
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:21.260
I like the Boston accent and then I liked the Chicago accident.

26
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.650
Their shit is way out there.
Yeah.
And that's one of the,
I can't even duplicate,

27
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:26.170
like I can't eat,

28
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.870
I haven't been out to the Midwest enough like in Chicago to even try and like do

29
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:35.770
a bad,
it sounds like everybody's doing an SNL character.
The Chicago accident is,

30
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.930
it's just,
I love it.
He likes to Chicago.
I just like working class accents.

31
00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:43.800
Like Boston New York was when I think about you as you've lived out here forever

32
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.920
and you never lost your accent.
Yeah.
I have my state had the,

33
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:50.490
the voice coaches and all that saying like,
yeah,
Michael,

34
00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:54.180
if you want to work more in this industry,
they warned me.
But you know,

35
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.440
all the actors that I really admire,
they never truly lose their accent.

36
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:01.740
So I was like,
if they don't have to do it,
and I'm of course it's good as them.

37
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:04.130
And I'm of course referring to like the Deniros,
the Patinas.

38
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.320
Cause you know when you mentioned de Niro,
Pacino Rapaport,

39
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:11.770
it's like Deniro Rapaport Brando wrap up,
but sometimes they put Britain,

40
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.150
Europe Opportunity Brando Rapaport and that's fine.
That's fine.

41
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.130
You don't get upset,
don't get upset.
But you know,

42
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.890
I lost it a little bit here and there and you know,

43
00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:23.010
you told me you could tone it down,
you can do variations on it when you go back.

44
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.650
I like,
cause when I go back to Boston,
like,
uh,

45
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.830
and I run into some people who really have it hardcore,

46
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.550
I like burst out laughing going like,
especially when it's a beautiful girl,

47
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.380
Massachusetts in that heinous accent like he is.
Sure.
Yeah.

48
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.460
They'll say stuff like that.

49
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:41.010
And it's coming out of their mouth and they sound like they're fucking,

50
00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:41.791
like there's something,

51
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:45.930
they have brain damage and there is those times where I'm just like,
wow,

52
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:48.750
I eat them.
I used to and I never thought I had it that bad.

53
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.990
I have some old standup tapes that I will never show anybody.
Oh,

54
00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:55.950
where you could really hear it.
I'll do it.
I'm a brutal,
brutal,

55
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.880
like I would win an Oscar like if Boston accent,
how bad it was.

56
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.040
And I still have it pretty bad.
This is good.

57
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:06.880
But when we were working in Boston years,
cause we were playing boss,

58
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.390
of course I was,
my,
my Boston accent was,

59
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.000
it's pretty pretty well I was just down east coast so I,
yeah,
well I was the,

60
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.150
I was the,
I was the black sheep of the family,
so I was like,

61
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.570
oh he must've left Boston.
So yeah,
he went upstate.
But yours was yours.

62
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:21.800
It was hard.
I was like,
oh cause it was you and you.

63
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.170
There was other bosses to people.
I was like,

64
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.650
people that are there really got that shit down.
You know,

65
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.180
people were really in their native,
their native tongue.
Yeah.
No,
no,

66
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:32.140
I didn't get anything down.
I just,
I was from there.
Right.
I don't do any,
uh,

67
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.940
I don't do any work,
but just to let people know,
we did a movie this,
uh,

68
00:03:34.941 --> 00:03:39.730
this summer called the heat with Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy and the

69
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:42.700
director of a bridesmaid.
Paul Feig.
Yup.

70
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.940
Comedy r rated comedy definitely was really funny.

71
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.030
Every nurse is a lie.
Everybody curses a lot.
And this we're,
we're,

72
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.930
we're a dysfunctional family.
Yeah.
We all play,
we all,
and we all play brothers,

73
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:56.970
which is of course when I,

74
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.060
when I tweeted out that you were going to be on the podcast here and I was just

75
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:02.650
saying,
if you have any questions,
let me know.

76
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.170
And I knew it was going to be a bunch of,
what are you guys brothers,

77
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:09.820
the pigment thing and all that.
The red head,
Sun,
Sun,
the sun,
cancer,

78
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:12.280
twins,
all that shit.
They didn't,
they weren't even that good.

79
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.070
And that's the thing.
They send them to me like they're gonna make me laugh.

80
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:16.450
And they think they're so fucking clever.

81
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:20.860
And it was basically 70 of the exact same joke,
but there was a couple,
uh,

82
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.990
I should actually read the funny one.
What were some of the,

83
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:25.810
what were some of the highlights you want to hear some of these?

84
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.030
Sometimes I set myself up on Twitter to see like,
wait,

85
00:04:29.031 --> 00:04:31.000
if I'm going to get some good stuff and people make me laugh,

86
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.070
even if they're insulting me,
I'll see if I can,

87
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.770
I fuck you if you insult me on Twitter,
by the way,
you know,
I don't,

88
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:39.850
I don't respond back.
I might just retweet because you know my kids,

89
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:42.820
I got kids and it's,
it's not,
it's what good does it do to.
I used to,

90
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:45.700
when I first got on Twitter,
I would get into arguments with people,
oh,

91
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.280
you're making that day.
I know that guy from true romance,

92
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.150
I'm actually interacting with him.

93
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.610
He told me to fuck off and they re they retweet.
Fuck your mother.
And they,
they,

94
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.970
they put that on there.
All right,
well this is a good one.

95
00:04:57.971 --> 00:05:01.360
Why did stupid Fox cancel?
He's show the war at home.
So that's a nice one.

96
00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:05.500
They were a fan.
They were a fan.
They were a fan.
Politics man.
Politics,

97
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.890
politics in show business.
Just like politics and politics.

98
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.720
Let's see what we got here.
Let me think.
God,

99
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.170
do you think you were separated at birth?
That's funny.
Ha ha ha.

100
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.330
That's all you unblock.
You and him were the same guy.
There's like another one.

101
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.530
Ah,
ask Rappaport if he realizes he's white.
Yeah,
I love that.

102
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:29.230
Just because you're from Brooklyn and you have an appreciation for,
uh,

103
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.250
a culture other than your own.
Um,
where are we at?

104
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.190
I was just going to be more of this.

105
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.290
I'm not going to waste time fucking blowing through this stuff,
but,
uh,

106
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.500
what was I going to ask you?
I was going to get into this thing.
Well,

107
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.400
we'll hope the whole way,
this whole podcast,
you being on the podcast came about,

108
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.520
wasn't just that we,
you know,

109
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.820
we're working together was that we both have dogs.
Right?

110
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.880
And I started talking about,
you know,
the big thing is curved your dog.

111
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:56.590
If you have a dog like a New York City,

112
00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.250
I think that they were the first ones came up with the preschool pooper scooper,

113
00:06:00.251 --> 00:06:03.200
a pooper scooper where I was from.
And uh,
yeah,

114
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:05.340
that basically to get the dog shit off.
Right.

115
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.140
And then that became a thing cause when I was a kid,
if you'd dog took a shit,

116
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.770
it just took a shit.
Right?
It was just outside and barely have a license.

117
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.340
So now you supposed to pick up after it.
So I never owned a dog in New York,

118
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.280
but I own one out here and I always pick up after her.

119
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.500
And you had this interesting duality is far as when and where you pick up after

120
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:28.820
your dog.
Yes.
Well here's the deal.
Okay.
I grew up,
I never had dogs.

121
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.840
So when I actually got my first dog,
I lived in Los Angeles and of course,

122
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:35.830
you know,
you want to follow it and got the dog,
the license and you know,

123
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.640
pick up after the dog.
And I was good and I would carry the shitbags and,

124
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.820
and I would pick up the shit.
And then I had two dogs so it would be,
you know,

125
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:47.750
you'd have to bring like three or four shit bags per trip cause each dog who

126
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:52.310
knows what's going to happen.
But the thing is then I,

127
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:55.730
then I moved to Los and then I moved back to New York with my two dogs.

128
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.810
And in New York,
this is where the World Cup,
what kind of dogs but months,

129
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.650
two months,
two months,
two months.
Uh,
and,

130
00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:05.390
and but this is where the conversation between me and bill about dog shit and

131
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:09.890
shit bags got interesting cause I said I don't use shitbags anymore.

132
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.220
Now back living in Los Angeles and bill there was a just a sense of judgment.

133
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.840
You don't,
you shitbag in La,
in La,
in La.
I don't use shit bags.

134
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.330
And the reason why,
here's the deal in New York,

135
00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:24.990
I use shitbags I clean up all the die in New York cause you're like no,
no,

136
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.070
no,
no,
no.
That's not why prejudice.
No.

137
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.480
I would pick up the shit and then be able to walk to the corner and drop the

138
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:34.670
shit bag in the garbage pail.

139
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.390
K in Los Angeles there's not.
And so the New York,

140
00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:42.560
there's garbage cans on every corner there is,
yes,
there is even caddy corner,

141
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.580
there's garbage cans.

142
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.250
Sometimes they're filled all the way to the top and the garbage is spilling out,

143
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:49.580
but at least it's the place to get rid of the shit bag full of shit.

144
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.510
In Los Angeles,
for those who are not familiar with less interest,

145
00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:55.730
there are not garbage cans on every corner.

146
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.890
So therefore when you are walking your dog and two dogs,

147
00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:05.300
when I made up my own rule about this,
you,
you pick up the dog crap,

148
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:08.810
I don't want to keep saying shit.
You pick up the door,
crap in the shit bag.

149
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:13.880
All right,
and then you carry it and you could be walking three,
four,
five,

150
00:08:13.881 --> 00:08:17.540
six blocks with it.
Now I'm caring.

151
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.510
I have two dogs on a leash,
medium sized dogs,

152
00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:25.511
50 60 pound dogs were to shitbags right by my side.

153
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.200
It's not like you could shake the shit bag and put it in your pocket and then

154
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.000
dump it out like it's like,
like a like a candy wrapper.
Right?
That's not cool.

155
00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:38.420
To be half to walk around with two shoots and it's not the picking up.

156
00:08:38.421 --> 00:08:40.820
It's the caring of the shit that you're carrying of it.

157
00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:43.640
Now I could change my rule and pick up the shit,

158
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:47.090
put it in shit bags and they'd throw that right on the side of the street and

159
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:49.850
then someone else has to deal with it.
But a person,

160
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.110
but just to play devil's advocate,
play it.
You can you plant,

161
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.890
you got the tooth dogs.

162
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.280
<v 1>All right.
You live in a nice upstanding neighborhood.</v>

163
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.660
You're considered a good citizen of this,
of the snap by anyone who knows me.

164
00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.540
I appreciate that to your neighbors,

165
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:09.810
like see like your dog's takes shits and you just walk up like,

166
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.080
let me ask you this.
So when you're in La,
if your dog's taking a shit,

167
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.720
the least put your head on a swivel and be like,
oh,
there's a basket over there.

168
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:19.680
I will pick this lump shit.
I do not buy shit bags anymore.

169
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.970
My zero tolerance.
I have a,
I don't fuck with shit bags anymore.

170
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:26.550
And the reason why I don't fuck with shit bags in words because I'm not walking

171
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:29.490
around with bags of shit for blocking block and block and block.

172
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.370
It's just not cool.
It's not cool.
It's degrading.

173
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.440
And here's who is it degrading to to walk with Oh,

174
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.160
steaming hot bag of shit for like you know it from underneath them.

175
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:48.360
I got two to one.
I have one dog,
Stanley died our Ip Stanley,
sorry to hear that.

176
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.770
It's Kay.
She was old but,
but,
but you know,
even now I have a big dog.

177
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.010
Dog takes big shits,
you know,

178
00:09:56.011 --> 00:10:01.011
and in the bag and then I can't walk text cause you've got a text when you're

179
00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:03.490
walking your dog.
That's when you get with Texas.
Yeah.

180
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.790
That's good techs time when you're walking your dog,

181
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.180
I can't walk the dog who I sometimes take off the leash,

182
00:10:09.181 --> 00:10:13.050
she's trained and then carry a shitbag.
Hey I'm just not doing it.

183
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:14.640
And now I'll tell you something.
I'll tell you something.

184
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.330
So you say upstanding citizen and I'm like this the game,

185
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.870
I'll refer to it as the game,
the shit game.
Listen if some,

186
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.700
if a dog shits on my yard,

187
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.810
I don't it's part of the game or you don't get mad if so.
Nope,

188
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.950
you shit on my yard.
It is what it is.
My dog shits in your yard.

189
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.980
It is what it is now sometimes there is a tinge of guilt if I know that it's,

190
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.410
it's cause I know some of my neighbors so I'll be like,
oh shit.

191
00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:42.060
You know it could like there's a six year old there.

192
00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:45.420
He's probably going to wind up playing footprint,
stepping in it,
running in it.

193
00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:48.330
Oh there's a six year old girl and he's like,
when your dog takes a shit,

194
00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:51.300
do you stand there?
Defiantly like I know my dog taking a shit.

195
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:55.260
I'm not picking up or do you pretend to be talking on the phone and not notice

196
00:10:55.261 --> 00:10:58.410
it or you a warm about it?
I'm a warm about it.

197
00:10:58.411 --> 00:11:00.190
I'm not going to front listen this.

198
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:04.350
Sometimes I'll faint like I'm bending over and I'm doing something that pick it

199
00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:08.760
up or if somebody goes pay your dog just went to the,
Oh you know he's sick.

200
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.040
I ran out of shit bags.
You know like he's right.

201
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.750
I am not going to get cause you buck because?
Because I've had confrontations.

202
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.310
One Dude,
two people literally say hey Michael Rappaport that happened.

203
00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:24.450
One dog took a shit one because now,
now that you have great,

204
00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:26.790
you've had fame for a while but you're not some random,

205
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.210
they can't that you get blue with this fucking asshole did you?

206
00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.400
They still can't believe I will have to accept that.

207
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.520
I will not argue that it's part of the shit game.

208
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.340
So I got to turn this down man cause we're fucking getting into this.

209
00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:41.700
I think I got the level's too high.
If you want to insult me,
criticize me,

210
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:46.080
judge me on,
on my policies with shitbags fine.
It's not a Los Angeles thing.

211
00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:47.820
I love Los Angeles.
I'm from New York.

212
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:52.020
It's just you put a garbage can on every corner.
This will go out the door.

213
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.800
You got a with me,
put it on rock.
You have demands.
Listen,
I'm not walking,

214
00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.080
I'm not walking more than a half a block with a shitbag it.

215
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:02.650
He's the most famous person you've seen walking with a shitbag for a good six

216
00:12:02.651 --> 00:12:05.350
blocks.
You ever just been driving around and you'd be like,

217
00:12:05.351 --> 00:12:08.350
oh there's Mary Tyler Moore with the sharing and shit.

218
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:13.000
I had never seen if you've ever seen somebody with a shitbag somebody famous.
No,

219
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:16.210
but I think that they have like the assistant walks their dog.

220
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.000
Maybe that's what your problem is to once you get famous dude,
you need,

221
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:22.310
you need like an assistant.
I need to walk the dog.
I need that tech's time.

222
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.930
And to clear my head.
It got got two kids,
get out of the house for a few minutes.

223
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.780
I and I do my thing,
but I will tell you one time,

224
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:33.460
do your kids know that you don't pick up your shit?
Unfortunately,
yes.
And I,

225
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:37.400
and I say,
you know,
don't,
don't,
this is a three pronged problem.
Yeah.

226
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:41.110
Cause it's just too Ken and it's creating other little kids.
But I,

227
00:12:41.111 --> 00:12:44.850
I explained to them the reason why,
because if you in most inches,

228
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.770
if you carry that shit bag,
you either have to make it back to your house,

229
00:12:47.771 --> 00:12:50.020
say your 10 blocks away from your house.
Dude,

230
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:54.740
I live it every morning you walk with a shit bag,
10 blocks,
you know,
I almost,

231
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:55.241
it's almost,

232
00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:58.210
remember that Tom Hanks movie where he was like talking to the soccer ball,

233
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.380
like literally like it's to that point and isn't,

234
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.200
it disrupts once you pick up the shit and you have the shit bag,

235
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.010
that's the only thing you're thinking about.

236
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.660
And then sometimes you get so relaxed it,

237
00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:10.030
it's just like you forget that it's even in your hand and it's like just

238
00:13:10.031 --> 00:13:11.890
dangling.
It's not cool,

239
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.280
but gets to the point now you know what it is when she takes a fucking horrific

240
00:13:15.281 --> 00:13:17.440
shit.
This isn't gonna be the Shit podcasts here,
by the way,

241
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.490
when she takes one of those horrific shits steamer that you can literally see

242
00:13:21.491 --> 00:13:25.060
through the bag and then you'll walk in with it and then some hot chick comes

243
00:13:25.061 --> 00:13:28.420
jogging by you just,
you just feel like an asshole.
It's degrading,
man.

244
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:32.890
It's the grading and that's my thing.
I had left a grading.
I've had,
it's,
it is.

245
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.900
I've had people say,
pick your shit up,
you know law.
I had one guy,
my dog,

246
00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:41.620
and I told this guy,
shook his hand afterwards,
my dog shat his yard.

247
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:46.730
I kept walking.
I told him I the dog is sick.
This guy's a prick.
Anyway,
I is.

248
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.120
When he first moved in the neighborhood and I didn't know he was much,

249
00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:52.150
why is he a prick?
Because he called you out or cause he know,
I respected that.

250
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.890
We,
we got into some other thing later.

251
00:13:53.891 --> 00:13:58.870
He called [inaudible] my kid and some other kids call them really bad names and

252
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.470
it was bad and it was it because they weren't picking up.
No,
it wasn't even that.

253
00:14:02.471 --> 00:14:07.090
He was just one of those guy like it was whatever.
But my dog shat in his yard.

254
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.920
He's some had a weird accent too.
And,
and,
and,
and then he said something,
I said,

255
00:14:11.921 --> 00:14:15.640
the dog is sick or whatever.
The,
what am I,
two or three I excuses.

256
00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:20.260
I had to kept going,
this fucking guy.
I was walking three,
four blocks away,

257
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.010
picked up the shit in a Shitbag,
drove up to me.

258
00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:27.480
So he picked up the shit and shit bag and brought the shit back and his car.

259
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.890
I respected it and he came up to me and your dog shit and he handed me the shit

260
00:14:31.891 --> 00:14:36.010
bag and I said,
you know what I respect that took the shit.
I said,

261
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.190
it's shake.
He didn't want to shake manager please,
please.

262
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.010
I shook his hand and he went on,
you know when I dropped the ship.

263
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:47.050
But you're acting like your noble that this guy had to go pick up your shit and

264
00:14:47.051 --> 00:14:49.090
be like,
you know,
and I respect that.
I respect that.

265
00:14:49.091 --> 00:14:52.160
You just picked up my dog rat.
If fucking

266
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.460
<v 0>it's good.
Depends on what you feed them.
You feed them the human food.</v>

267
00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:58.640
Then this shits is healthy as our shit's fine.
It's good for the grass.

268
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.860
But let's have you noticed that by the way.
What?

269
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.480
Anything can take his shit on your yard and it'll make the grass greener except

270
00:15:05.481 --> 00:15:10.100
for a human being and I've Shat on my own yard.
Okay.
We got to get into this.

271
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.220
That's my shift bed.
Sorry,
I apologize for the cough.
No,
no bro.
Listen man,

272
00:15:16.221 --> 00:15:17.054
I fucking,

273
00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.440
I bought these fucking Hook in cigars and I put them in the fucking humor door

274
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:26.200
and I had it turned up to fucking high and it fucked up the cigars like this.

275
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.840
They get this fucking acceptable.
There's like fucking little bug eggs in there.

276
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.830
If it's up too high.
They like hatch.
I Dunno.
I Dunno what I haven't,
I think,

277
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:38.660
I think I got a virus in me.
It's gradually,
this is the most disgusting.

278
00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:43.700
First 10 discuss people.
I'm not,
I'm not like one of these people with,

279
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.240
you know,
who likes to talk about shit.
Right.
It's on a scale.

280
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.090
A scale of one to 10.
Yeah.
As far as your,

281
00:15:50.091 --> 00:15:53.960
your upstanding citizen count,
10 being the best one being like,

282
00:15:53.961 --> 00:15:57.080
I can't wait for that motherfucker to move out of where,

283
00:15:57.081 --> 00:16:00.500
where are you aside from dog stuff.
I'm a good neighbor.

284
00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:03.830
I consider myself a good neighbor.
I do,
let's like Manson say,

285
00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:08.060
aside from fucking getting people killed,
I'm a good drawer.
Aside from my dog.

286
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:12.860
My dog is harmless.
The dog couldn't hurt a fly.
Listen,
my house got broken into.

287
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.950
The fucking dog was sleeping.
It's set on the police report.

288
00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:18.830
It said the dog was sleeping.
It freaked me out about that.

289
00:16:18.831 --> 00:16:23.180
You are home and somebody came in and just like the boldness of that just came

290
00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:24.380
into your house at night.

291
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:29.980
Took like whatever laptop or some bullshit stuff and my dog didn't wake up.

292
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:35.630
Cops come dog fucking bolts out there.
Cops pull a pepper spray.
No,
no,

293
00:16:35.631 --> 00:16:39.230
don't,
don't,
don't pepper spray him.
Right.
When he had his moment to shine,

294
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.030
to bark attack something,
he was sleeping.
You know,

295
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:47.550
I made this reference the other day.
You know,
it's like,
he's like a,

296
00:16:47.551 --> 00:16:51.470
that dude Bobby in Saturday night fever driving around the crowd.

297
00:16:51.471 --> 00:16:55.340
What were you guys I was [inaudible] I was looking for exactly.
I would,

298
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:58.100
I would have done something.
You actually made me.

299
00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:01.880
I got a fucking got guts in Santa Fe fever.
Remember they beat up guts.

300
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.760
That's why they went back and got them all.
That's fine.

301
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:08.270
It's only seen it a couple of times.
Send a fever.
I know,
I know.

302
00:17:08.271 --> 00:17:11.990
That's a big one for you,
for you guys.
You guys in Brooklyn,
you're from Brooklyn,

303
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.510
but I'm from Manhattan.
From Manhattan can make that mistake.

304
00:17:14.511 --> 00:17:16.580
I went to school in Brooklyn.
I have a lot of friends in Brooklyn.

305
00:17:16.581 --> 00:17:19.790
I have a lot of affiliations in Brooklyn,
but I'm from enhance.
You know people.

306

I got to Brooklyn Path.

307
00:17:22.431 --> 00:17:25.700
Well let me ask you this as a out before we get into this shit.

308
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.440
We know what the Shit topic here.
I'm fine with.
You brought it up.
You brought,

309
00:17:29.441 --> 00:17:31.410
I'm comfortable with it.
You were fascinated by,

310
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.220
I am comfortable with my stance on it,
you know,
cause you know what it is.

311
00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:37.310
I have such a fucking need to be liked.
I got,

312
00:17:37.311 --> 00:17:40.280
when we come back after this talking about your needs to be liked.

313
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.520

Back to the podcast.
Do it.
Um,
so today,
right?

360
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:17.070
We saw Bruce Springsteen by the way,
the other night down in Anaheim.
Oh,

361
00:20:17.071 --> 00:20:19.990
I thought you saw him around here.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Sorry.
That's cool.
Yeah.

362
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.200
And I had never seen him and I was one of those guys going through it.

363
00:20:22.201 --> 00:20:24.060
I don't get it.
All he does is sing about jersey,

364
00:20:24.061 --> 00:20:28.500
but like so many people I know who were borderline.
Did you do a southern accent?

365
00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.550
He's from Jersey,
but he does a southern accent sometimes,
which is weird to me.
I,

366
00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:36.210
he didn't do that tonight.
I'm talking about,
I'm just,
you know,
he's,

367
00:20:36.211 --> 00:20:39.450
he does like a southern accent,
but he's from Jersey.
He's the,

368
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:44.430
he's the common man.
But you're from Jersey.
Yeah.
I like guy.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

369
00:20:44.431 --> 00:20:47.980
I don't want to show him the Bruce.
He went and I was down there like,
hi man.

370
00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:51.520
You know,
all right.
I was gonna say,
born to be wild,
born to run or whatever.

371
00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:54.370
I'll listen to this shit,
dude.
I got to tell you something,
man.

372
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.090
The fact that I ever think that I gave a performance after seeing what that guy

373
00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:02.890
did,
do four songs in the,
I'm already blown away.
He's blown away.

374
00:21:02.891 --> 00:21:05.740
Bands that are in their twenties and thirties that I've seen just fucking

375
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:08.920
killing his voice.
Sounds unreal.
Goes out to the middle of the crowd.

376
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.790
He's standing on this stage out there.
People go and fucking nuts,

377
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.820
and then he just lays back into the crowd and crowd surfs like 70 rows.

378
00:21:18.071 --> 00:21:21.370
That's cool.
Up to the,
as a band keeps playing,
that's crazy,
right?

379
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:25.420
As he gets onto the stage,
boom,
they go right into the closing verse.
Dude,
that's,

380
00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:30.430
that's encore.
That's,
you know,
that's somebody closing out a great concert.

381
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:34.090
That this fourth song.
That's crazy.
And it didn't peak there.
It just kept,

382
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.580
he wore me out,
dude.
I was sitting.
How long did he go for?

383
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.860
Three and a half hours of that.
He is no joke,
dude.
It was,

384
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.800
it was,
it was sick.
And the thing about that,

385
00:21:44.801 --> 00:21:47.650
that I love so much that he doesn't have to do three and a half hours.

386
00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:52.120
He loves to perform.
Totally,
totally get your money's worth like that.

387
00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:55.350
[inaudible] he was like,
what do you like it or not like Bruce,
that guy.

388
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.900
I got this like longer than Schindler's list.
We put the fuck Bruce.
I got to go,

389
00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:01.620
man,
I got to take my dog.
I have to take a shit.
You know what?

390
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.430
Every time like I was,
I'm so old,

391
00:22:03.431 --> 00:22:07.200
like my back's killing me and shit and they do that shit where they have like a,

392
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.300
they hit the final note of the song and Weinberg's doing the simple wash and

393
00:22:10.301 --> 00:22:14.500
then playing a chord and you think he's going to be like,
thanks a lot.
Anaheim.

394
00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:18.400
You are great.
And he always just goes one,
two,
three,
four and they go into them.

395
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.080
I'm like,
oh my God,
that's crazy.

396
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:24.400
Like he just kept thinking that this guy couldn't get a dude and it's fucking

397
00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.010
Anaheim.
What are the cheesiest like?

398
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:31.030
Just like he said it not me as bill talking by Anaheim Dude.

399
00:22:31.031 --> 00:22:32.230
It doesn't even look real.

400
00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.800
I think back in the day when they had like all the orange groves has bent some

401
00:22:35.801 --> 00:22:39.790
sort of personality.
It's just one fucking strip mall after another.

402
00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:45.010
It looks like a giant,
like it's Disneyland down there.
Right?
Like there's no,

403
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:50.380
there isn't that feeling them any sort of culture.
Right.
Either way.
Right.

404
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:54.640
And he's down there active performing like he's in giant state.
That's cool.
Yeah.

405
00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.260
I,
I respect them and that's,
yeah.
So anyway,

406
00:22:57.261 --> 00:23:01.540
so today that fucking born to run song,
which I never,
never was into.

407
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.220
So I'm up in the bathroom and I'm singing it,

408
00:23:03.221 --> 00:23:08.221
but I'm doing different lyrics and I'm singing to Nia and it's all vulgar and I

409
00:23:08.411 --> 00:23:10.810
did all your born come.
No,
no,
no.

410
00:23:10.811 --> 00:23:13.970
I was just saying how it was starting off saying,
uh,

411
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:18.100
I was just singing about what a great guy I was and that Nia doesn't appreciate

412
00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:21.310
it and all this shit that I put in the cadence of born to run.
Yeah.

413
00:23:21.311 --> 00:23:24.120
And then there's somehow there was something about banging you in the ass.
Just,

414
00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.470
it was really,
it was that cold.
He's really vulgar.
That's cool.

415
00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:30.310
Then it go some like banging.
Yes.
Like maybe hey like you know,

416
00:23:30.311 --> 00:23:33.180
I don't need a Christmas gift or bang you in the end I will let me do it.

417
00:23:33.181 --> 00:23:35.980
Maybe we can do,
but she'll never let me do that.
Okay.
Yeah.

418
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.640
So I was singing that and got it.
You got to ask.
I got all the way to the dat,

419
00:23:39.641 --> 00:23:43.870
Dat,
Dat,
Dat,
Dat,
Dat,
dat,
it loudest,
fucking hell.
So I walked out of the bathroom,

420
00:23:43.871 --> 00:23:46.640
I didn't realize my bedroom window was,
and I know Amy,
I go,

421
00:23:46.641 --> 00:23:50.270
do you like that Bruce Springsteen impression?
And before she could answer,

422
00:23:50.271 --> 00:23:54.800
I heard somebody just in a talking voice goes now and I was like,
Oh shit.

423
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:57.950
It was your neighbor.
Yeah.
And I started thinking like,
Holy Fuck,

424
00:23:57.951 --> 00:24:02.180
how much did they been hearing?
How loud I am,
I,
and then Nia,

425
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.810
I kept wanting need to make me feel better,
but she just goes,
you know,
you're,

426
00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:07.520
you're,
you're loud.
You're,

427
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:12.140
there's times I pull up in the car and I hear you on the phone and it's making

428
00:24:12.141 --> 00:24:15.920
me like really like self conscious.
Like fuck him.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm that loud.

429
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:19.880
And I felt bad until you fucking come.
And I'm like,
you come and I,
and I,

430
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.760
you hit the buzzer and I pick it up.
I'm like,
hello.
And you start screaming,

431
00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:27.380
Derek cheat or like loud as fuck.
And I'm like,
it may be,
it's just an east coast.

432
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:30.940
Well,
it still,
as far as upstanding citizens and loudness,
I,
I,

433
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.730
I've come to terms with the fact that my neighbors know everything about me.

434
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:36.980
If they wanted it to like,
you know,

435
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:42.040
start a scandal on me or they know my whole life because yeah,

436
00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:45.290
I got this buddy of mine,
Becky's big giant Yankee fence.

437
00:24:45.291 --> 00:24:49.040
We have these epic Paul versus epic fucking,
uh,

438
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.710
arguments about sports where I'm just like,

439
00:24:51.711 --> 00:24:55.490
I got him on speakerphone and I'm yelling like,
we're in a crowded bar.

440
00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.090
I can't imagine.
I feel bad for my neighbors and what they've heard.

441
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.180
I know they've heard me doing,

442
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.520
my neighbors on this side have kids and the stuff that all the time,

443
00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:07.610
it's just like,
she doesn't give me dirty looks.
So,

444
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.420
but I look at it like she has a toddler and I can never hear her kid.
Well,

445
00:25:11.421 --> 00:25:14.750
if you'd never hear the little snotty nose loudmouth kids screaming and crying,

446
00:25:14.751 --> 00:25:16.580
she probably never hears it.
You should ask her,
see,

447
00:25:16.581 --> 00:25:20.330
that's what I need to hear me,
hear me sick cunt or fuck you.

448
00:25:20.331 --> 00:25:23.420
Or cause I don't want to offend your kids and then you should just ask her.

449
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.600
I Dunno.
I think that would get a,
they get weird,
but whatever.

450
00:25:26.601 --> 00:25:28.430
I should be mean to say,
Yo,
I still,

451
00:25:28.431 --> 00:25:31.610
it takes a lot for me to be embarrassed at this point.
All,
you know,

452
00:25:31.611 --> 00:25:35.020
just in general,
you become immune to humiliation when you get into this big,

453
00:25:35.021 --> 00:25:38.270
like every audition you go into and you eat your balls after awhile you just

454
00:25:38.271 --> 00:25:42.140
don't feel it anymore.
But that I literally got,
uh,

455
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.980
that made me feel,
I felt I was embarrassed.
I was like,
wow.
She,

456
00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:50.990
she heard all of that.
And like just the,
uh,
the way she said no to was,

457
00:25:50.991 --> 00:25:54.240
this was not the first time I heard my loud voice.
She's,
yeah,
she's,

458
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.770
this is just an option.
You just open the window up for her.
The,

459
00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:59.670
the opened the window literally for her to get involved with the conversation.

460
00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:02.930
I was fantasizing about all these cool comebacks that I wish I said,

461
00:26:02.931 --> 00:26:06.110
but in the end I just had to realize like,
you know what she was yeah,

462
00:26:06.111 --> 00:26:09.740
she was right.
She was right.
I um,
I've come to terms with it.

463
00:26:09.741 --> 00:26:13.160
I got loud speaking voice and it,
but I'm in my house.

464
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:17.090
I'm not bringing it down so you hear what you hear and that's it.

465
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.840
But I turn music up,
I got a pool and I turned the fountains on when I'm there.

466
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.770
It's not like,
it's not our fault that fucking house is a two feet.

467
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.840
Like I could literally take a running leap up my,

468
00:26:26.841 --> 00:26:30.170
if I could leak through my bedroom window and I couldn't be landing on the roof

469
00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:32.930
of the house next door.
Right.
I know we're on top of each other,
not the house.

470
00:26:32.931 --> 00:26:35.480
I mean it slammed into the side,
but you know what I mean,
be there.

471
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:37.310
I would be there.
I would definitely be there.

472
00:26:37.311 --> 00:26:40.240
So this is some sports questions I'm trying to,

473
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.780
and I know people want to know about your movies and shit,
but I just figured,

474
00:26:42.781 --> 00:26:44.100
Hey,
yes,
you've answered

475
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.860
<v 1>all of that is us or whatever.
Silly at times.
All right,</v>

476
00:26:46.861 --> 00:26:48.950
well before I go into more sports shit.
Okay.

477
00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:52.560
We haven't started but I always end up talking sports.
Yeah.
Like you know,

478
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.930
right out of the gate dude,
you were in one of the greatest movies of,
uh,

479
00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:00.690
of my life,
a true romance and a,
I was wondering like,

480
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.300
you were basically roommates with Brad [inaudible],
Brad Pitt,

481
00:27:03.301 --> 00:27:07.530
Brad Pitt at that point.
It was just about to be almost Brad Pitt at that point.

482
00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:11.550
Like he was,
he had done like Thelma and Louise.
He had done,
um,

483
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:15.870
the movie with Robert Redford.
He had done stuff,
he'd done California and,

484
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:18.960
and you know,
he was,
he wasn't the superstar,

485
00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:22.170
but you knew that he was going to be,
that he was very well liked and,

486
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.590
and you know,
there was,
he was,
he was about to be Brad Pitt.
So you,

487
00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.500
it was excited that you were just sitting at a yes.

488
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:32.220
Good looking son of a bitch with his ABS.
None.
No,
no,
he was,
he was,
he was real.

489
00:27:32.221 --> 00:27:35.430
He was totally cool.
And,
and,
um,
you know,

490
00:27:35.431 --> 00:27:37.800
the thing about true romance was that,
first of all,

491
00:27:37.801 --> 00:27:41.540
the script was so great when you read the script,
it just read you like,
you know,

492
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.900
Quentin Tarantino scripts.

493
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:47.130
They just read so easy and you're just like laughing and like,
what the fuck?

494
00:27:47.131 --> 00:27:49.680
And it was so a reverend.
And so,
you know,
every,

495
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:54.900
I'd say about 95% of what wound up insurance was,
was written like,

496
00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:59.460
it's so active,
friendly,
like it's hard to score it up.
And so,
you know,

497
00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.950
I had heard like,
you know,
initially it was like,
okay,

498
00:28:01.951 --> 00:28:04.320
Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette and Patricia Arquette,

499
00:28:04.321 --> 00:28:07.770
I had just seen in Sean Penn's movie called Indian runner.

500
00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:10.140
That was like one of the first things she did.
And she was great in that.

501
00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.180
And I was like,
oh,
this is going to be dope.
And you know,

502
00:28:12.181 --> 00:28:15.600
Christian Slater was like,
you know,
right at that time he was,
it was perfect.

503
00:28:15.601 --> 00:28:19.620
And then you heard,
oh,
well Gary Oldman's plane,
um,

504
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:23.130
whatever the pimp and the pimp,
I can't remember the character's name and oh,

505
00:28:23.131 --> 00:28:26.440
that's cool.
And then val Kilmer's playing Elvis.
Really Salt.
So you,

506
00:28:26.441 --> 00:28:29.370
you were already,
I wasn't cache.
I was,

507
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:33.280
I had been going in for another part I hadn't been going in for,
for,
for um,

508
00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:37.140
one of the mobsters and um,
and,
and actually actually at the,

509
00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:41.010
actually I got cast as one of the mobsters as one of the younger mobsters.

510
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:43.800
So I would,
I always like kind of like,
oh,
you know,

511
00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.240
you would have been in that scene with,

512
00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:50.520
if I succeed I would've been in there like,
yeah,
around there.
And then,

513
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:54.120
so then you heard like,
yeah,
walking's planned the mobs a holy shit.

514
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.160
And then Dennis Hopper's plane is that Holy Shit.
And,

515
00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:01.620
and Sammy and I'm 24 years old at this point.
I had done zebra head,

516
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:06.480
a little part in poetic justice just to meet Tupac.
I was like,

517
00:29:06.481 --> 00:29:09.530
it was like I just want it to meet him like I and then and then,

518
00:29:09.531 --> 00:29:13.710
and then a little part in,
in,
in,
in a a move,
another movie and then,
and then,

519
00:29:13.711 --> 00:29:14.291
sure.
Oh Man.

520
00:29:14.291 --> 00:29:19.160
So I mean I was such a fan of all these guys and I was so sort of excel and

521
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.710
everybody was and but how big was Tupac by the time?
Uh,
he was,

522
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.190
he was super oc for what he was doing.
Poetic Justice.
He was,
as soon as he was,

523
00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:29.090
he was at,
he was like a star and he,

524
00:29:29.091 --> 00:29:31.810
I thought he kinda came out and he was with the who?
Who's that guy?

525
00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.570
The humpty dance guys and like 90,

526
00:29:33.571 --> 00:29:37.320
89 90 and then he broke out on his own like 91 92 I would think.

527
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.910
He was still like on the ride he was on,

528
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:42.550
he wasn't what he became like he became this iconic,
I love to know,

529
00:29:42.551 --> 00:29:45.100
this was after juice.
I loved his music.

530
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:48.370
He wasn't the star that he became like after,
you know,

531
00:29:48.371 --> 00:29:51.280
when he was with death row and he really took it to the next level.
But he was,

532
00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:54.850
he was big.
I mean he was,
you know,
and I,
I thought he was,

533
00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:57.970
I thought juice has performance in this movie.
Juice was just like,

534
00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.310
it was incredible.
And I was just,

535
00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.940
I at that time I met was still huge fan of movies and huge fan of actors,

536
00:30:03.941 --> 00:30:05.230
but like at that time,

537
00:30:05.231 --> 00:30:09.010
like I would become a namerd with people's performances and I d I liked his

538
00:30:09.011 --> 00:30:13.810
music and I had a funny kind of relationship following him because I was friends

539
00:30:13.811 --> 00:30:16.660
with Jada Pinkett and she kept telling me before he did anything,

540
00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.040
my friend Tupac,

541
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:21.070
he's going to be a big star two and I had heard his name and then he came out

542
00:30:21.071 --> 00:30:23.470
with Humpty dance and he came out with that,
you know,

543
00:30:23.471 --> 00:30:26.530
that one verse on digital on the ground.
And then,
you know,

544
00:30:26.531 --> 00:30:30.230
then of course his solo album and then juice.
And I was just like,
damn,
this,

545
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.830
this guy is special.
And so to do that,

546
00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:37.330
it was John Singleton who was just off of Boyz in the hood and I'm Janet Jackson

547
00:30:37.331 --> 00:30:40.000
would Janet Jackson was like Jenny's Jackson,
you worked with everybody.

548
00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:42.820
It was your first week,
your first,
by the time you're 24,
you were with,

549
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:46.300
there's a lot every icon out there.
Yeah.
And then it meant a lot to me.
Like,

550
00:30:46.301 --> 00:30:49.000
I mean I,
I get excited now,
but like at the time I was,

551
00:30:49.001 --> 00:30:53.020
so I was young and I was like,
I was like really excited.
So true romance.

552
00:30:53.021 --> 00:30:57.430
And it was Quentin Tarantino who had done reservoir dogs.
Um,

553
00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.530
natural born killers had come out.
I think he didn't direct us,

554
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.710
he didn't direct it.
He wrote it.

555
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:06.910
And I had met Quentin originally at the Sundance Film Festival because the year

556
00:31:06.911 --> 00:31:10.930
that reservoir dogs was,
there was the same year that Zebra had was there.

557
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:14.110
And that was a big deal for me.
It was a big deal for him.
He was nobody,

558
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.230
I was nobody.
I was really nobody.
And you know,

559
00:31:17.231 --> 00:31:20.770
that was a really exciting time for independent filmmaking.
So,
you know,

560
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.850
the script was being passed around in Hollywood fall,
like a smaller community.

561
00:31:24.851 --> 00:31:29.710
At that time everybody was talking about a true romance and I got cast as one of

562
00:31:29.711 --> 00:31:32.230
these mobsters and then this one was in it and that one was in it.

563
00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:36.970
And then I'll see they cast you as the is one of the mobsters.
So what happened?

564
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:40.320
So then they,
in the script,
Dick Richie,

565
00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:42.490
the character I wanted to play was written as a black,

566
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.420
it was written as Dick Richie,
black,
young actor,
blah blah,
blah blah.

567
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.580
So they were looking at young,
uh,
young act of black actors,
right.

568
00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:55.060
He was just written that way.
Um,
and then they,
they,
they weren't finding them.

569
00:31:55.061 --> 00:31:59.950
And um,
Tony Scott,
the Great Tony Scott,
rest and peace,
great guy.

570
00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:03.590
So much fun to work with.
Um,
the,

571
00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.270
they called me in the Mary for new,
uh,
who was a casting system,

572
00:32:07.271 --> 00:32:10.810
who is now a huge casting director and um,
oh man,

573
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.110
I got to fix this because the other casting director,
I can't remember her name,

574
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:19.210
I never remember names they gave me.
They gave me a big break.
Anyway,

575
00:32:19.211 --> 00:32:22.750
but I remember I got the word that from my agent that Mary renew was like,

576
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:26.080
she thinks you're a Dick Richie and you should play that.
And it was very true.

577
00:32:26.081 --> 00:32:28.720
I never considered the park cause I wasn't even brought in.

578
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.270
She was like the way you are.
And I was like that.

579
00:32:31.271 --> 00:32:33.910
Like I was like looking for my big break and you know,

580
00:32:33.911 --> 00:32:37.480
and I was just really sort of wide eyed and I don't know how actors,

581
00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.010
that's the hardest thing ever.
I don't know how you guys do

582
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.390
<v 0>it.
What?
It's so much easier.</v>

583
00:32:41.391 --> 00:32:44.660
It was a stand up that doing an hour long commercial is,

584
00:32:44.661 --> 00:32:48.380
that's your special people.
You just do it enough eventually.

585
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:50.270
That's how I finally got little,

586
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.910
little parts that I'm been getting lately was just going through that.

587
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:54.440
The shit that you guys do.

588
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:58.700
Like I've done a couple of pilots and like the second the pilot is over,

589
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:02.270
you know,
I'm going to go go tell jokes and these other guys are like,
well,

590
00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:05.000
unemployed again.
And she's like,
I don't know.
I don't know how you'd do that.

591
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.080
I didn't want to,
no,
no,
no.
It's cool.
I want to talk to about,

592
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.640
because you said something when we were working together about the standup
thing,

593
00:33:10.641 --> 00:33:12.800
which is like your independent,
if you're good at it,

594
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:17.540
which you are and you're successful at it,
it's you have it never unemployed.

595
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:18.890
Like I knew the full thing.

596
00:33:18.891 --> 00:33:23.450
I don't have that level of strength to do,

597
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:27.630
uh,
to try and make it just as an why man.
I had a passion for Standup,
but just,

598
00:33:27.631 --> 00:33:30.290
just,
just sit there and be like,
all right,
I'm going to fucking wake table.

599
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.980
Fuck that and I'm going to get a bit part and be in this movie,

600
00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.110
this giant production and then you know,

601
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:39.740
every fucking movie you see there's like a hundred whatever.

602
00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:44.330
What 40 actors work on them.
Yeah.
It's like two people that continue on.

603
00:33:44.331 --> 00:33:48.200
Exactly.
And then the,
then maybe somebody in,
in the other whatever,

604
00:33:48.201 --> 00:33:51.980
38 get something and then everybody else goes back to fucking waiting tables.

605
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.990
You would just,
you were in a movie,

606
00:33:53.991 --> 00:33:56.300
which is the biggest thing ever to everybody in your hometown and stuff.

607
00:33:56.301 --> 00:34:00.980
And they,
I don't know that they,
and it's like how fucking hard that it's tough.

608
00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.940
It's tough.
It's so true.
Just uh,
it,
it,
the,
the uh,
on the scene,

609
00:34:04.941 --> 00:34:06.710
I'm not saying like,
you know,
as opposed to digging a ditch,

610
00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:07.700
it's not physically hard,

611
00:34:07.701 --> 00:34:11.930
but the emotionally it's hard emotionally to go from that.
It's emotionally,

612
00:34:11.931 --> 00:34:16.490
it is hard.
Yeah.
To then fucking going back to,
to waiting the tables and uh,

613
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:19.240
I dunno and just know when you're good enough.
Right.

614
00:34:19.241 --> 00:34:22.400
Miss just have and then you and knowing you couldn't have paid is being proved

615
00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:23.860
cause you,
you got a part.
Yeah.

616
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:27.860
But it might not pay the bills much longer than you know,
you know,
when you're,

617
00:34:27.861 --> 00:34:30.620
when you could be like,
what are you,
if you were a quarterback and you came out,

618
00:34:30.621 --> 00:34:35.270
you first start you through 300 yards and for some inexplicable reason you sit

619
00:34:35.271 --> 00:34:38.680
on the bench again for two fucking years.
Tom Brady crazy.

620
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.660
Like that's like Brady's thing.
Like he was just sitting there and sitting there.

621
00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:46.580
Right.
You know?
Yeah.
It's being an of the emotional highs and lows are,
are,
are,

622
00:34:46.581 --> 00:34:50.240
are,
are tough.
But I could never do it.
It's,
it's,
it sucks.

623
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:54.530
It's the worst part of it.
That's so much of it does.
It seems like it sucks.

624
00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:58.670
That's why it always makes me laugh when,
when,
when,
when actors,
there'll be like,

625
00:34:58.671 --> 00:35:02.240
standup has this weird sort of like it's respected and they also look at you

626
00:35:02.241 --> 00:35:05.570
like you're slapping yourself in the head with a rubber chicken where it's like

627
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.660
it's,
it is obnoxious.
Just ask my neighbor,

628
00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.610
he's fucking obnoxious.
But then like there is this respect for it,

629
00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.420
but like all the balls it takes to get on that.

630
00:35:14.421 --> 00:35:18.980
Like I feel like there is a lot of humiliation but the level,

631
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:22.670
I just couldn't handle the fucking stress.
Like I would be doing a movie,

632
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.570
God willing and I would just be thinking the whole time as I'm doing this.

633
00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:30.530
Like I have to be so fucking unreal in this thing or else I go back to

634
00:35:30.531 --> 00:35:34.760
Applebee's.
Fuck.
Like I don't know how they do it.
It's tough.
You got.

635
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:38.070
That's why when people ask me if anybody,
they,
you know,
people

636
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:39.590
<v 1>always ask,
what do you,
what do you need to be to,</v>

637
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:42.750
what do you need to do to be in this business?
And I always say,
you have to,

638
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.630
it has to be something you have to do.

639
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:50.550
If it can't be something that you kind of want to do,
I might do this business.

640
00:35:50.551 --> 00:35:53.730
You will,
if you're,
if it's not something that you have to do,

641
00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:57.290
if it's intrinsically in you that you have to do it,
stop.

642
00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:01.290
Don't even try to do it because there's too much.
It takes too much out of you.

643
00:36:01.291 --> 00:36:03.630
You have to do,
it has to be something that's within you.

644
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.900
It's like if you are a writer,
like what do I have to do to be a writer?
Right?

645
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:08.940
Keep going.
Keep it ended that.

646
00:36:08.941 --> 00:36:12.810
And if you're in it just because you're not on riding on,
you know the Sopranos.

647
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.680
Gee,
if you,
you have to,
it has to be like something that's organic.
Just like,

648
00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:21.930
like I really just have to have that,
that psycho,
once you start down the road,

649
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:26.180
there's no way I'm stopping no matter how many times like I did,

650
00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.610
I got to tell you what's of course crazy as,

651
00:36:27.611 --> 00:36:32.611
as I know a couple of comics throughout the years that these legendary guys who

652
00:36:33.031 --> 00:36:38.031
never got beyond doing open mikes are doing the occasional spot and they fucking

653
00:36:38.491 --> 00:36:43.491
bomb 98% I bomb like quit the business bomb and they've stuck with it for 2025

654
00:36:47.101 --> 00:36:47.934
fucking years.

655
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.820
And you see like all these funny people that you run into on the road and

656
00:36:50.821 --> 00:36:52.920
they'll say,
she like,
dude,
like as much as I'm shitting on some of the stuff,

657
00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:55.530
people around in Twitter,
there's people out there that write really funny shit,

658
00:36:55.531 --> 00:36:58.000
right?
And I think God damn,
that's funny.
And then have to fucking great.
Right.

659
00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.680
But you know,
try going on stage on and I'll do it.
I can never do it.

660
00:37:01.681 --> 00:37:04.710
Like I never do it because it's the whole fear of bombing and then you see this

661
00:37:04.711 --> 00:37:06.960
guy just night after night after night,

662
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:11.400
basically living the horror that everybody does it and he and he just keeps

663
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.740
fucking right back.
And I always look at those guys.
It's like dude,

664
00:37:13.741 --> 00:37:17.760
if you could take that sticktuitiveness right and actually apply it to something

665
00:37:17.761 --> 00:37:20.790
you're good at,
right.
There'll be be great.
Yeah,
there'll be no stopping you.

666
00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.790
That's,
that's fucked up.
It is.
But anyways,

667
00:37:23.791 --> 00:37:25.770
let's go back cause I know people probably upset.
Okay.
Okay.

668
00:37:25.771 --> 00:37:30.540
I got off of the sort of social roles.
So just this cast was compiled.

669
00:37:30.541 --> 00:37:33.030
So anyway,
so on a Saturday they were,

670
00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.180
they needed to cast this part like I almost like a week or two weeks away from

671
00:37:36.181 --> 00:37:37.590
shooting.
So on a Saturday,

672
00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:41.340
which is unusual for show business and end in general to do anything on a

673
00:37:41.341 --> 00:37:44.160
Saturday cause it's fucking Saturday,
you know,
show business.

674
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.640
They take all of December's off.
Yup.

675
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:49.530
The 4th of July is like a three week holiday.
You know,

676
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:52.300
like this business after September is Jewish holiday.

677
00:37:52.301 --> 00:37:56.390
So that way in this business for them to do something on a Saturday,

678
00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:59.130
there was a necessary,
you know,
like there was some urgency.

679
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:01.800
So I go in there and they're like,
you know,
we feel like you're,

680
00:38:01.801 --> 00:38:05.190
you're this guy who you are and just read that.
And it was with me,

681
00:38:05.191 --> 00:38:06.480
Tony Scott in the casting directors.

682
00:38:06.481 --> 00:38:10.590
And I went through all the Dick Richie scenes and they will,
and I said to them,

683
00:38:10.591 --> 00:38:13.180
cause I,
once that door opened and I was like,
I,

684
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:16.220
once I started thinking about tomorrow,
I was like,
this,
I love this part.

685
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:19.860
I love this character.
I remember I said to them,
don't let me leave,
um,

686
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.390
until I get it right.
You know,
and I,
and I went in and I kept reading and Tony,

687
00:38:24.391 --> 00:38:28.280
you,
and you knew to say that a 24 it because it wasn't,
I wasn't in the hustle,

688
00:38:28.281 --> 00:38:32.010
right.
It wasn't any hustle.
That's like,
like now you could say that that's like,

689
00:38:32.011 --> 00:38:36.040
oh,
that's a smart thing to say.
Like,
I just,
cause I,
once I locked into the,

690
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.870
to the idea of me doing it,
I was like,

691
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:42.580
I had blinders on right when I was younger.
I would go in there with blinders on.

692
00:38:42.581 --> 00:38:44.530
That's another,
that guy would be like,
Yo,
I'm going in here,

693
00:38:44.531 --> 00:38:47.900
I'm getting this shit.
I'm doing this shit.
And that's it.
And,
and,

694
00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.910
and but it was talking about that's psycho focus.
Yeah,
it was,

695
00:38:51.911 --> 00:38:54.250
that's what I had because it was really,
it was a sense,
you know,

696
00:38:54.251 --> 00:38:57.010
it was like I wanted it and it was,
it was right there.
So I went in there,

697
00:38:57.011 --> 00:38:59.680
I did it,
I did a good job.
And I remember,

698
00:38:59.681 --> 00:39:02.230
I remember one thing is that behind me,

699
00:39:02.231 --> 00:39:06.310
like when I went to go set up in the room,
all the people that had been cast,

700
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:09.610
their head shops were,
were sitting behind me.
So it was like Christopher Walken,

701
00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.620
Samuel Jackson,
Gary Oldman,
the all their headshots,

702
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:16.360
like blah to play in this part.
I remember seeing that and I was just like,

703
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:18.250
you know,
try not to pay attention to it.
But I remember,

704
00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:21.070
I remember walking over to the thing and like seeing all of them and I was like,

705
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:24.970
I got to fucking do this,
I gotta get this shit right.
And,
um,
you know,
and,

706
00:39:24.971 --> 00:39:29.080
and for,
and then they called me like two or three days later and they said,

707
00:39:29.081 --> 00:39:31.360
you got the part.
And it was like the character in the movie,

708
00:39:31.361 --> 00:39:34.840
cause it was like you got the part,
I got the part and I would just was so happy.

709
00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.570
And,
and,
and then,
you know,
I remember I went to a,

710
00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:41.350
a rehearsal was me and Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette and Patricia

711
00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:46.150
Arquette was fine at that time.
She said she's fucking,
I had a huge crush.
Me Too.

712
00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:50.890
And she was beautiful and she was sexy and really sweet and I was tripping out.

713
00:39:50.891 --> 00:39:52.150
I was like,
she's fine.

714
00:39:52.151 --> 00:39:55.720
And I just saw her in Indian runner and Christian Slater was like a part of my

715
00:39:55.721 --> 00:39:57.370
youth watching him.
So,

716
00:39:57.371 --> 00:40:01.900
and I'm just starting to be in the show business and I had done a few things and

717
00:40:01.901 --> 00:40:03.990
he kind of your age too,
because he started so young.
He,

718
00:40:03.991 --> 00:40:06.610
he might've been a little older,
a little older,
maybe not,

719
00:40:06.611 --> 00:40:09.070
but I mean he was Christian Slater.
He was a huge star.

720
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.890
So I'm like tripping out and they're like,
you know,
yeah.
You know,

721
00:40:11.891 --> 00:40:15.040
like we're like having this like bonding sessions and we're like,
I don't know,

722
00:40:15.041 --> 00:40:17.830
we'd go out to eat and we're like eating lunch.
And I'm like,

723
00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:19.480
what the fuck am I doing here?
You know?

724
00:40:19.481 --> 00:40:22.420
And we're reading scenes and it's Tony Scott and he directed all these movies

725
00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:26.950
and Tony Scott was just such a Tony Scott,

726
00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.700
the way he treats actors and,

727
00:40:28.701 --> 00:40:33.130
and the way he treated me at that time was a big thing because I was low man on

728
00:40:33.131 --> 00:40:36.160
the totem pole.
At least I looked at myself like that and you know,

729
00:40:36.161 --> 00:40:40.690
but I was also had ideas and thoughts about the character and he was so open

730
00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:44.360
and,
and,
and some things he would say,
great,
great,
do that.
Somethings Z,
not,

731
00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:45.010
don't do that.

732
00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:48.430
But he gave me a voice and it was the first time where I felt like the first

733
00:40:48.431 --> 00:40:51.010
time I had only done four or five things,
not like I've been trying to do it.

734
00:40:51.011 --> 00:40:52.540
The treating you like you actually,
that you were a pro,

735
00:40:52.541 --> 00:40:56.110
like you knew what you were doing,
your ideas were,
were worth listening to.

736
00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:59.470
Exactly.
And some of them he liked and some of them he didn't.
And,
and,
and,

737
00:40:59.471 --> 00:41:01.570
but it really gave me confidence to go for like,
yeah,

738
00:41:01.571 --> 00:41:02.980
I have a say in these things.

739
00:41:02.981 --> 00:41:06.700
And he just was so positive and so much energy and,

740
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:11.230
and so enthusiastic every day and his energy would supersede everybody on the

741
00:41:11.231 --> 00:41:13.990
crew.
And he just was,
was the uh,
like you know,

742
00:41:13.991 --> 00:41:16.570
the guy that I actually was such a huge fan of,

743
00:41:16.571 --> 00:41:20.650
it was devastated when he passed was Chris Pan,
Chris Penn,
what was it like?

744
00:41:20.651 --> 00:41:23.200
Hangs and you got to,
because he was fun.
You,
you are in that,

745
00:41:23.201 --> 00:41:26.380
that final shaft scene when you were covering up and everything.
He was great.

746
00:41:26.381 --> 00:41:28.910
Crisp and you know,
what would the day this goes out,
if I'm going to,

747
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:31.650
I'm going to still send you a picture you could tweet with is a really guy,

748
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:35.840
I found these cool pictures from on the set.
Oh yeah,
I'll love it.

749
00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:38.420
I'll send it to you.
They like,
you know,
like personal pictures that I,

750
00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:42.020
that I took,
but Chris Penn,
Tom Sizemore and these guys were like,

751
00:41:42.021 --> 00:41:44.990
Tom Sizemore was in everything at a time.
It,
Chris Penn with these words like,

752
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:45.981
dude,
you know,

753
00:41:45.981 --> 00:41:49.550
and they were in a lot of shit and I'm like with them and they're like treating

754
00:41:49.551 --> 00:41:53.000
me like I'm one of them in Chris pennants size where they're like regular dudes,

755
00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:55.380
Chris Penn,
you know,
rest in peace also.
Yeah.

756
00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.410
<v 0>He's just a sweet guy.</v>

757
00:41:57.411 --> 00:42:01.460
And then there was a reservoir dogs like anniversary DVD that I watched with

758
00:42:01.461 --> 00:42:06.270
this buddy of mine to Rosa.
And uh,
it had all of them like telling stories.
Yeah.

759
00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:10.040
And Chris Penn stories were just like,
you could just see like,
he was just that,

760
00:42:10.041 --> 00:42:14.270
that hanging out with a guy,
he's a sweet guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just sweet.

761
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:18.040
So fun like that.
He,
I always felt like the way he,
he did,
I loved him.

762
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:21.020
A reservoir dogs and actually went on a closed range.
Oh yeah.

763
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:25.520
And I went on this whole like Chris Penn tear.
Yeah.
That anything he was in,

764
00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:29.550
he did some obscure movie,
not obscure,
but it was one with Harvey Kaytel.

765
00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:33.620
I can't remember what it was.
He was somehow his landlord is something,

766
00:42:33.621 --> 00:42:37.010
I just remember him running up the side of the house trying to see if Keitel was

767
00:42:37.011 --> 00:42:38.750
in there.
I can't remember what the name of the movie was,

768
00:42:38.751 --> 00:42:41.600
but this is back when like blockbuster video.
Yeah,
I would,

769
00:42:41.601 --> 00:42:42.900
I'd be going there like every day.

770
00:42:42.901 --> 00:42:47.810
And then on this [inaudible] I just like reservoir dogs was like ground zero for

771
00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.720
every actor in there.
I just went like off,
shoot,
just find all their stuff.

772
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:55.670
Just like watching all of that.
And I became a not like,
I stopped.

773
00:42:55.671 --> 00:42:59.100
I was just such a huge fan of that guy was a,
well they like hilarious.

774
00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:02.670
<v 1>They were just hilarious and fun and,
and,
and,
and,
and warm and,</v>

775
00:43:02.671 --> 00:43:07.250
and big personalities.
And you know Victor Argo,
he's another guy passed away.

776
00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:11.150
Victor Argo was one of the mobsters.
He was in taxi driver.
Yeah,
he,
he was,

777
00:43:11.151 --> 00:43:14.690
he was the guy in the,
in the store.
When tack,
when,
when Travis shoots the guy,

778
00:43:14.691 --> 00:43:15.980
when he tries to rob the Bodega,

779
00:43:15.981 --> 00:43:19.580
you fucking the bees in a lot of square seems to means she saw him like
plugging,

780
00:43:19.581 --> 00:43:22.220
I mean I'm bugging out that I'm working on the,

781
00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:27.080
and then Samuel Jackson Need Sam's treat me like he knows me.
Right.
You know,
and,

782
00:43:27.081 --> 00:43:27.960
and I'm sure you know,

783
00:43:27.961 --> 00:43:31.370
and Val Kilmer is there and like I'd walk into the makeup trailer and val Kilmer

784
00:43:31.371 --> 00:43:35.090
is doing is Elvis makeup and he's talking in the Elvis voice finding the

785
00:43:35.091 --> 00:43:38.210
character and Gary Oldman.
I remember having a conversation.
He was,

786
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:42.470
it was crazy to sit next to val Kilmer who's doing Elvis.
It's crazy.

787
00:43:42.471 --> 00:43:45.560
I'm tripping out.
I'm tripping.
I'm literally like chipping.

788
00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:50.300
And then Brad Pitt cone.
What did you do?
How did you,
how did you

789
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.140
<v 0>feed into that and go,
oh my God,
I'm not worthy to be here.</v>

790
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:55.860
How did you keep yourself settled?
This is becoming like inside the box.
Yay.

791
00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.640
<v 1>What do you that?
Well,
what I would do and what I,</v>

792
00:43:57.641 --> 00:44:00.000
what I always do still to this day when I'm working with somebody,

793
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:03.300
like when I worked with you I had to get myself together.
Shut up.
No,

794
00:44:03.301 --> 00:44:05.340
but you know what,
but you know it's the same thing.

795
00:44:05.341 --> 00:44:09.570
Like my ego actually entertained that for half a second was on premium blend.

796
00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:13.610
Maybe it was a thrill for him for at the time,
at the time I used to wear.

797
00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.770
What I would do is I would,
I would enjoy and,
and,

798
00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.110
and be a fan when it was time to be a fan,

799
00:44:19.111 --> 00:44:21.510
I would never invade space or talk to them about any,

800
00:44:21.511 --> 00:44:23.540
I never would go up to somebody and,
and,

801
00:44:23.541 --> 00:44:27.060
and sort of do what I'm doing to you right now.
I wouldn't even do that.

802
00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.520
I remember me and my friend Kevin Corrigan,

803
00:44:29.521 --> 00:44:33.450
Hawaiian did playing the young gangster and we had worked together on my first

804
00:44:33.451 --> 00:44:35.850
movie zebra head and we had worked together on something else in.

805
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.160
We were both like he got cast now.

806
00:44:38.161 --> 00:44:41.250
We're friends now and I always look at Kevin like he's a real actor.

807
00:44:41.251 --> 00:44:44.640
He's really good and he's been in tons of stuff.
He's on,
he's on Twitter.

808
00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:49.320
We can tweet out Kevin and,
and,
and we saw Christopher Walken in,

809
00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:54.360
in his wardrobe for the first time by the craft service.

810
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:58.470
And Kevin like Kevin would probably put Christopher Walken and he says number

811
00:44:58.471 --> 00:45:01.890
one,
like I love Christopher Walken,
but I would go like,
Deniro is my number one.

812
00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:04.830
Right.
And Kevin was a psych and I was like,
Yo,
you got to go talk to them.
Go to,

813
00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:08.700
I'm hyping him up to go talk to a man like,
Yo,
you're like him.
Go talk to him.

814
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:11.490
And I remember he went over and talked to them and like the conversation,

815
00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:15.060
you can tell it better.
It was kind of anticlimactic because you know,

816
00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:18.510
Chris is bugged out.
Chris is so much more funnier than you would think cause,

817
00:45:18.511 --> 00:45:18.751
but he,

818
00:45:18.751 --> 00:45:22.800
at the time he was younger so he really had that spooky look and in the dark

819
00:45:22.801 --> 00:45:25.130
black hair.
And he has the,
he had the wardrobe wants.

820
00:45:25.131 --> 00:45:29.450
So he had the suit on with this long trench coat,
Vincent.
Oh,

821
00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.440
wasn't Vincent Vega.
That's what was known as the blonde.

822
00:45:31.441 --> 00:45:35.520
It was that core led or I don't remember,

823
00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:38.610
he was the antichrist.
He was the antichrist reincarnated.

824
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:42.390
But I remember seeing it by craft service by that,
by the truck.
And I was like,

825
00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:46.050
Oh shit.
And I mean it was just,
it was just such an exciting time.

826
00:45:46.051 --> 00:45:48.730
And Gandel Feeney was in our boat,
gamble.
Feeney was not,

827
00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.900
that was his first thing.
Right.
So he was even less than,

828
00:45:51.901 --> 00:45:53.460
he had never acted in a movie before,

829
00:45:53.461 --> 00:45:56.550
like he had done stage and so he was really nervous.

830
00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.580
He was really freaking eyes.

831
00:45:58.581 --> 00:46:01.650
So he was playing the mobster and I remember being there watching that scene

832
00:46:01.651 --> 00:46:04.710
with him and Patricia Arquette and I'm just,
I would,
I would go to this,

833
00:46:04.711 --> 00:46:08.430
this single hung out.
Oh yeah.
We'd go to the set just to,
just to go,

834
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:11.640
just to watch you be like the scene with Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper.

835
00:46:11.641 --> 00:46:15.390
I was there watching it.
Wow.
Yeah.
I was watching the Monitor.

836
00:46:15.391 --> 00:46:19.770
It was a small city was a set and it was a small little guy as as that whole

837
00:46:19.771 --> 00:46:23.490
thing was,
yeah.
Where you just sit there,
go on this.
This is crazy.
Crazy.
Yeah.

838
00:46:23.491 --> 00:46:24.690
You knew that was the only,

839
00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:28.800
that was the only movie that I've ever done where you,
I could say,

840
00:46:28.801 --> 00:46:30.660
and I have a pretty good track record,

841
00:46:30.661 --> 00:46:34.350
this zone who got ever done where I knew it was going to be great to all the

842
00:46:34.351 --> 00:46:37.890
movies that I've done.
Highs,
lows,
good or bad.
Whenever I,
I,
we,

843
00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:41.220
you knew it was special.
What it now when,
when they would go,

844
00:46:41.221 --> 00:46:43.640
I got ask some Geek questions,
whatever.
All right,

845
00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:46.470
so when they would say cut after he did a run through with a scene,

846
00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:51.270
would there be any laughing and joking around or was it was,
it was,
it was,

847
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.250
it wasn't serious.
Like,
I'm taking myself seriously,

848
00:46:53.251 --> 00:46:56.160
but I think the tone of the scene,
because it was serious,
you know,

849
00:46:56.161 --> 00:46:59.640
and then I remember a couple of times a line would get messed up and you know,

850
00:46:59.641 --> 00:47:02.610
there'd be a little bit of giggling and Tony,
you know,
I was behind the Monitor.

851
00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.060
Right.
You know,
being super quiet and literally saying to myself,

852
00:47:06.061 --> 00:47:09.810
I can't fucking believe I'm here.
Like tripping out.
Right.
Cause we all,

853
00:47:09.811 --> 00:47:12.600
when you read that scene,
that was word for word,
you knew that scene.

854
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:15.720
You knew what it was going to be and just to hear them,
um,

855
00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.960
I don't think I had headphones on listening to,
you could hear them,
you know,

856
00:47:18.961 --> 00:47:20.520
just to hear them and be around it.

857
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:22.530
Like you knew you were watching something special.

858
00:47:22.531 --> 00:47:25.140
Like I remember feeling like this is something special.

859
00:47:25.141 --> 00:47:28.080
And then when you see the scene,
you know,
like I,
like I was there,
like,

860
00:47:28.081 --> 00:47:30.100
I remember sitting there like watching it,
like this

861
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.970
<v 0>is special,
you know,
and,
and um,
they,</v>

862
00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.360
each time they did it a little different or pretty hip,

863
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.820
they had their choices down.

864
00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:41.260
They had their choices that walk and fluctuates a little bit.
Um,
but I think,

865
00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.830
I think the scene was so well written,
this is like almost 20 years ago,

866
00:47:44.831 --> 00:47:49.240
but the scene was so well written.
You didn't need to really,
once you meet your,

867
00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:49.871
you're locked in,

868
00:47:49.871 --> 00:47:54.610
you locked in because it was the writing Omani moments in that scene.

869
00:47:54.611 --> 00:47:57.340
I love when walking clasps his hands together like a,

870
00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:01.060
please don't make me whatever he says.
Yeah,
I spent a while since I've seen it,

871
00:48:01.061 --> 00:48:02.140
but that,

872
00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:07.330
that point where a hopper just like,
you know,

873
00:48:07.331 --> 00:48:09.550
can I,
can I have one of those chesterfields and he's just like,
you know what,

874
00:48:09.551 --> 00:48:13.030
I'm going out fucking swinging.
And when he finishes the story,

875
00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:17.200
he sees that look on his face where he's like preparing himself,

876
00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:21.190
I'm going to get killed.
And it was just a,
I don't know,

877
00:48:21.191 --> 00:48:25.270
it's just one of the greatest scenes.
It really is.
It was.
It really is special.

878
00:48:25.271 --> 00:48:26.670
It's special.
And,
and,

879
00:48:26.671 --> 00:48:30.040
and you knew it was going to be special and when they got cast you knew it was

880
00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:31.900
going to be great.
And how long did it take him to shoot it?

881
00:48:31.901 --> 00:48:35.770
Like they probably had a whole afternoon all afternoon or maybe the whole day

882
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.610
like,

883
00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:39.400
but they might have been had the whole afternoon because the thing about the

884
00:48:39.401 --> 00:48:41.920
scene,
there's not much other than the acting,

885
00:48:41.921 --> 00:48:43.840
there's not much logistically going on.

886
00:48:43.841 --> 00:48:45.520
So he's not sitting there in that little trailer.
Yeah.

887
00:48:45.521 --> 00:48:47.860
So like technically it might've been a whole day.

888
00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:50.650
I know I was there for a few hours.
Where did they shoot that?

889
00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:54.040
It was on a soundstage.
I don't want to say it wasn't Warner brothers.

890
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:57.310
It was a soundstage me,
I don't think it was Warner brothers.

891
00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:59.740
I can't remember exactly where,
but it was this,
it was a stage,

892
00:48:59.741 --> 00:49:03.310
I feel like it was Culver city ish,
but Sony,
you might've been Sony.

893
00:49:03.311 --> 00:49:08.080
I think it was Sony.
I think it was Sony.
Culver City.
So it was cool man.

894
00:49:08.081 --> 00:49:11.620
It was exciting to watch that again immediately because I also like,
uh,

895
00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:14.150
now that I've been out in la here for like five years,
I like,

896
00:49:14.151 --> 00:49:17.490
she like the same way.
I like watching old movies about New York City.
Yeah.

897
00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:20.230
And seeing stuff that's still standing there and they'll shift to change.

898
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:22.510
I'm starting to get like that for like la out here,

899
00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:26.980
like just to to go to the locations sometimes.
Yeah,
I'll actually do that.

900
00:49:26.981 --> 00:49:30.610
Like it bums me out that where they shot a reservoir dogs right out in Eagle

901
00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:32.800
Rock didn't exist anymore.
And I met Jay.

902
00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:35.380
I just want to at least is the alley still there right,

903
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:39.490
where they pull the cop out of the trunk.
Like I'm a geek.
I love that stuff.

904
00:49:39.491 --> 00:49:41.680
Sports stadiums.
And I'm a geek for like this,

905
00:49:41.681 --> 00:49:46.681
like this probably 20 like guy movies that I was like,

906
00:49:46.871 --> 00:49:50.710
I don't give a fuck about,
you know,
you know what women want.
They shot that.

907
00:49:50.711 --> 00:49:53.170
But you know,
like if there's a place where they shot Goodfellas,

908
00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:56.020
if there's a place like that to pants,
reservoir dogs,

909
00:49:56.021 --> 00:49:58.840
like the typical hacky guy list.
Yeah.
Of Film.

910
00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:01.060
There's no left turns on the still the same way.

911
00:50:01.061 --> 00:50:05.650
And my film and the films that I like,
but uh,
me neither.
But,
um,
let,
let's,
uh,

912
00:50:05.651 --> 00:50:08.560
I want to talk to you did something about about hoop real quick,

913
00:50:08.561 --> 00:50:11.310
unless you had something more to add.
No,
no,
no.
I mean,
I all I can say is it's,

914
00:50:11.311 --> 00:50:12.520
it was a great experience.

915
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:16.880
It was everything that you would imagine everybody was,
was great.
And I mean,

916
00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:19.030
Brad Pitt,
it just was,
it was special.

917
00:50:19.031 --> 00:50:23.290
It was a special special film to be a part of and it was a special time for me,

918
00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:26.920
you know,
it was just a good,
it was a suspect.
You were in one of those rare,

919
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:30.380
what before I described it,
you know,
two people continue on the right.

920
00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:34.490
You were in one where there was like,
it seems like 10,
like everybody,
yeah.

921
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:35.690
Worked out of that.
In fact,

922
00:50:35.691 --> 00:50:40.580
one of the guys who played in the scene,
uh,

923
00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:44.960
the wok and scene with hopper,
uh,
the guy who was over at the fridge,

924
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:49.040
he speaks in a town called victor.
He's a good friend of mine.
Yeah.
He,
he was in,

925
00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:53.870
um,
he's in tons of stuff.
He was in what the the wire.
He was in the wire.
Yeah.

926
00:50:53.871 --> 00:50:56.200
He's in day works all the time.
Yeah.
And he's one of,

927
00:50:56.201 --> 00:50:59.600
he was in there and he was in the scene,
but he's one of those guys.

928
00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:02.360
He would have been back in the day when blockbuster video was still around.

929
00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.810
He'd been one of those guys that you gradually like who is this guy,

930
00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:08.200
this guy and then you just,
you figure out how to fuck dude.

931
00:51:08.201 --> 00:51:10.820
How the fuck back in the day did you figuring out what other movies they did

932
00:51:10.821 --> 00:51:13.920
before IMDP before I MDB.

933
00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:17.270
You just had to like muscle it through that to be for good conversation piece.

934
00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:20.050
Oh you'd buy like at that book you'd buy the book,

935
00:51:20.051 --> 00:51:22.490
look at something that you wouldn't even be able to keep up the update.

936
00:51:22.491 --> 00:51:24.500
Praise people.
You'd have to have a conversation.

937
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:27.410
Oh he was in this and you'd call friends and now you could just text.

938
00:51:27.411 --> 00:51:30.680
And I am DB has having that conversation the other day,
like the,

939
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:33.410
the art of conversations and figuring things out as God.

940
00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:34.550
Cause you could just be like hold on.

941
00:51:34.551 --> 00:51:37.460
And you look at your phone and you got ever even thinking now on the,
on the,

942
00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:42.280
on the new,
the new download and the iPhone where they have like the,
the uh,
that,

943
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:44.270
that gps thing,
right.
Which is great.

944
00:51:44.271 --> 00:51:45.740
Now you don't have to look down at the phone.

945
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:47.630
You could just sit down and mindless,
silly,
right.

946
00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:52.070
Make a right now make crazy hair that I don't mind,
but sometimes like,
you know,

947
00:51:52.071 --> 00:51:54.950
like,
oh,
what was he in?
And you could kind of like,
oh yeah,
he was in that,

948
00:51:54.951 --> 00:51:58.460
but you just get it all taken away from my MDB.
Now it's organic.

949
00:51:58.461 --> 00:52:03.140
It gets rid of the debates and then Zach,
what he bucks says he was in the movie.

950
00:52:03.141 --> 00:52:05.030
Then it will get resolved six weeks here.

951
00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:09.650
But now you can't even get to the bet now.
So anyway,
you can a bedding I've got,

952
00:52:09.651 --> 00:52:11.060
we got to talk sports.
Okay.

953
00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:15.630
This is a fucking question here that I want to I about the nick.
I got,

954
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:18.980
I got to ask,
what about the thing you were saying to me about red or back?

955
00:52:18.981 --> 00:52:20.970
You heard that what was happening?

956
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:23.690
You said that you said that you heard it and I was like,
I don't know.

957
00:52:23.691 --> 00:52:25.460
That's your guy.
And you were like,
say that her,

958
00:52:25.461 --> 00:52:28.640
you heard that he had a bungalow in West town and I was like,

959
00:52:28.641 --> 00:52:31.490
that's a big skill or you should break down what I know where this is coming

960
00:52:31.491 --> 00:52:32.750
from.
What this is coming from.

961
00:52:32.751 --> 00:52:36.260
You being a Knicks fan and you have two little championship banners that have to

962
00:52:36.261 --> 00:52:39.290
be turning yellow at this point.
They've been hanging up there so fucking long.

963
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:43.040
Yes,
that's true.
All right.
I wasn't going to drop in like that.
Okay,

964
00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:46.070
but you did say something about red or black having a bungalow in west Hollywood

965
00:52:46.071 --> 00:52:49.250
and there was a whole scandal.
I thought it was,
I understand it.

966
00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.440
It's the jealousy.
Somebody brought that up to me.

967
00:52:51.441 --> 00:52:55.640
I thought it was probably another sad ass fucking Knicks fan.
I was surprised.

968
00:52:55.641 --> 00:52:55.881
I was like,

969
00:52:55.881 --> 00:53:00.050
how could read horror of a bungalow in west Hollywood and that there was a whole

970
00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:03.500
era you got into true romance hires here.
Emma favor.

971
00:53:03.501 --> 00:53:07.010
You gave him a fucking handy and that's why we met on a Saturday when the

972
00:53:07.011 --> 00:53:11.570
business was set though one of his cigars so to speak.
Um,

973
00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:17.150
fucking New York.
Yes.
Basketball Fan,
Knicks fans,

974
00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:21.650
all these fucking Knicks fans who've lived in Brooklyn and have been live,

975
00:53:21.651 --> 00:53:23.390
die hard fucking Knicks fans.

976
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:28.380
All of a sudden the New Jersey Nets move into their burrow and then all of a

977
00:53:28.381 --> 00:53:30.000
sudden they just all Brooklyn net fans.

978
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.020
And when are they all Brooklyn that fence.
Enough of them are that,

979
00:53:34.021 --> 00:53:37.650
it's shocking to me the fact that when the day we're beating the Nixon,

980
00:53:37.651 --> 00:53:39.230
the end when Brooklyn play,

981
00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:41.610
when they played in Brooklyn and you knew that the uh,
the nets,

982
00:53:41.611 --> 00:53:44.750
we're going to beat the next,
that all those people were standing up going brook.

983
00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:48.360
Yeah.
Yeah,
Bro.
Like taunting the New York Knicks.

984
00:53:48.361 --> 00:53:51.840
Like to me that's like some Benedict Arnold Shit.
Well,
I,
here's the thing,

985
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:54.810
here's the thing is,
is that he's explained me what the thing is,

986
00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:57.330
I don't fucking get,
let me put it in Boston terms.

987
00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:01.830
Let's say a team became the Dorchester ducks,

988
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:05.040
a basketball team,
and they were like the Dorchester,

989
00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:08.110
like I don't know Boston so well,
but I know that right?
Dorchester's like,
uh,

990
00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:11.190
like it's a,
there is a place in Dorchester and our ducks up there.
Okay.

991
00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:12.990
But so you're on the right path toward let's say,

992
00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:16.740
or let's see the Er to the door and let's say a team became like a sub team of

993
00:54:16.741 --> 00:54:19.950
Boston and it was Dorchester and was like this neighborhood that's like very

994
00:54:19.951 --> 00:54:24.210
close knit and it's a lot of pride and a lot of people have come through there

995
00:54:24.211 --> 00:54:28.650
and it's,
it's a working class neighborhood.
Brooklyn is that,
I get that.

996
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:31.690
And I think it's cool that there's a team.
Go ahead.
I always that,

997
00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:37.200
that's the thing.
So I think some people flipping are,
is because of that,

998
00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:40.690
because it's like,
Yo,
this is Brooklyn.
Like if you're from Brooklyn,

999
00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:43.770
you grew up a Knicks fan,
some Brooklyn Guide.
For me.

1000
00:54:43.771 --> 00:54:47.130
I'm curious who were going to be the Brooklyn net fence?
Well,
here's my question,

1001
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:51.360
but the Knicks or on a fucking tear.
Yeah,
they beat the heat last night.

1002
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:53.490
They're like,
what?
Like 12 and four,
something like that.

1003
00:54:53.491 --> 00:54:57.630
13 and four something crazy.
Right?
I don't count my chickens with that shit.
Okay.

1004
00:54:57.750 --> 00:55:00.810
By the way,
you could get into that,
say hypothetical.

1005
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:05.820
They finally pushed through this year and they win a championship and all those

1006
00:55:05.821 --> 00:55:09.060
people in Brooklyn who've been sitting there going to be pissed and they went

1007
00:55:09.061 --> 00:55:11.280
through all,
you know the finger roll instead of the dunk.

1008
00:55:11.281 --> 00:55:14.900
They went to all the fucking shit with the Knicks.
Right.
And all this.

1009
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:18.600
And like you're not going to be real years and years and yes.

1010
00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:23.310
And let's just like,
I look,
I guess I get it to a certain extent.
If you're a kid,

1011
00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:26.400
like I get like little kids if like,
Oh Brooklyn,
I'm from Brooklyn,

1012
00:55:26.401 --> 00:55:30.300
I'll be on that.
But if you're some guy in his 30 years old,

1013
00:55:30.301 --> 00:55:32.430
so what have you started watching when you're six 20,

1014
00:55:32.431 --> 00:55:37.431
you got a quarter of a century of fucking just rooting for this team and then

1015
00:55:38.101 --> 00:55:42.330
all of a sudden that fucking New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Nets,

1016
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:46.770
the New Jersey Nets.
I the fucking,
it's,
it's,
it's an interesting thing.

1017
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.680
I don't know why it is,
is it going to be a conflict of interest?

1018
00:55:49.681 --> 00:55:53.490
Because the crazy thing is they're both doing well and if they play each other

1019
00:55:53.491 --> 00:55:55.800
in the playoffs,
it's gonna.
It's gonna be interesting.

1020
00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:59.340
Like I would be curious like when the,
at the Brooklyn Arena,

1021
00:55:59.341 --> 00:56:01.800
at the Barclays Arena,
which I haven't been to,
which I'm going to go to,

1022
00:56:01.801 --> 00:56:04.560
that annoys me.
How nice that places compared to with the south,

1023
00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:07.350
except I just saw it on TV.
It's fucking ridiculous.
I heard it's really nice.

1024
00:56:07.351 --> 00:56:09.900
They got the,
uh,
the little suites that they have up there,

1025
00:56:09.901 --> 00:56:12.180
this fear like little mini brownstones.
That's,
that's what the,

1026
00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.980
that's what the floor is supposed to look like.
Like,

1027
00:56:13.981 --> 00:56:15.330
I guess if you have a nice Brownstone,

1028
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:18.360
that's the pattern of the wood on the floor.
That's crazy.

1029
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:21.240
And then you look at the fucking Celtics.
Yeah,
we have the parquet floor,

1030
00:56:21.241 --> 00:56:25.230
whatever,
but they just,
it's just a of cinder blocks.
No carer.

1031
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:28.450
You knock that shit box down the Boston Garden.
Dude.

1032
00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:32.560
Get the fuck out of my house right now.
Shit.
Box down.
Shit.

1033
00:56:32.561 --> 00:56:36.820
Fuck you talking about this whole down right.
Then wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.

1034
00:56:36.821 --> 00:56:39.670
I know this is coming from.
Can I use for you guys?
I'm standing up now.

1035
00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:43.840
Where you fucking guy.
This guy's about to assault me.
No,
no.

1036
00:56:43.841 --> 00:56:48.310
Where you guys could never win.
I get it.
Kenny Skywalker.
Listen,
Bernard King,

1037
00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:52.570
listen,
Patrick Ewing,
you guys came through and they all lost to the,

1038
00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:56.380
I just want to say,
I just need to say Yam rock.
You guys knocked that shit.

1039
00:56:56.381 --> 00:57:00.880
Hold down.
And then you have a new arena.
What's it called?
Fleet Center.

1040
00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:03.520
The fucking fleet center.
You should or you shouldn't call it.

1041
00:57:03.550 --> 00:57:07.300
You should've done that.
He should have,
you know,
made it tie tech did and stuff.

1042
00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:08.920
But you cut corners.
What does that mean?

1043
00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:12.190
Make a nice like the Barclays make it nice like you know,

1044
00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:16.510
do something nice to it but you want it to make a shitbox knocked the one down

1045
00:57:16.511 --> 00:57:19.510
and then make another shitbox that fleets and I walked by it.

1046
00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:21.790
It looks like she should go to the Boston Garden.
I've never been there.

1047
00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.730
You sound like a guy who's never gone to the Boston Garden.
I never been in it.

1048
00:57:24.731 --> 00:57:28.280
What do you consider?
Did you think?
Yeah.
No cause it wasn't mind you go me.

1049
00:57:28.281 --> 00:57:29.650
You go on that tour of Fenway.

1050
00:57:29.730 --> 00:57:34.030
We really get to know we did get on with your insult.
That fucking place.

1051
00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:36.970
That new is that not put all the history.
The history is great.

1052
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.830
I can go home museum for his laptop.
It was a piss hole.
If they sold mouse ears,

1053
00:57:41.831 --> 00:57:44.500
they're like,
you were at Disneyland,
you would have bought him.
You loved it.

1054
00:57:44.501 --> 00:57:48.910
Bill told me you love me now he's just serene.
A cunt to side from the history.

1055
00:57:48.911 --> 00:57:52.930
Is it not a shitbox you I could even fit in some of those seats.

1056
00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:58.000
It's a shit hole blocking here.
It's a shit hole.
It's,
it's,
it's character.

1057
00:57:58.030 --> 00:58:02.240
Okay,
so Barclays wanted to revamp their and make a nice arena.
God bless him.
No,

1058
00:58:02.241 --> 00:58:06.220
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I'm not giving them shit.
I think it's great that they did that,

1059
00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:09.220
but what I'm saying is that you went from,
Oh,

1060
00:58:09.221 --> 00:58:13.120
the fans that you went from the Boston Garden.
Yeah.
Being a shit hole.
A step.

1061
00:58:13.121 --> 00:58:16.540
Was it?
I mean,
if you consider winning 16 titles,
they're a shit hole.

1062
00:58:16.541 --> 00:58:17.770
I didn't say what they weren't good.

1063
00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:20.800
I'm just saying the garden itself was a piss box.
Listen,

1064
00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:22.480
I'm not gonna say it didn't need a coat of paint.

1065
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:25.960
I'm not going to say that the electrical didn't crap out on you every once in a

1066
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:28.630
while.
I'm not saying that.
I'm not saying that all right,

1067
00:58:28.631 --> 00:58:31.660
but spending in the fucking Madison Square Garden,
my friend,

1068
00:58:31.661 --> 00:58:35.080
they don't call the lead.
What do they call it?

1069
00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:37.360
What do they call Madison Square Garden going?
Or they call it,

1070
00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:41.020
what do they call Madison's Gurgle the most,
the most famous arena in the world.

1071
00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:45.160
It'll never get knocked out.
This is the thing,
and we revamped it.
First of all,

1072
00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:47.770
that's the second one.
They already knocked down the first one.

1073
00:58:47.771 --> 00:58:52.630
I know that New Year history,
I note that the first one was a piss box.
Secondly,

1074
00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:56.800
the fucking most famous arena in the world.
You know who came up with that?

1075
00:58:57.010 --> 00:59:00.820
The people who fucking own the thing.
Well,
they're,
they're good marketing people,

1076
00:59:00.821 --> 00:59:03.640
right?
That's what I'm saying.
When I fight,
I fight.
What if I,

1077
00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:06.730
I anoint myself a fucking nickname.
You got to start.
You should call them,

1078
00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.530
discover them for something,
some kind of,

1079
00:59:08.531 --> 00:59:11.860
something about the fleet center because that's a Michael Jackson just said,

1080
00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:14.890
you know,
like almost not even in Boston.
It's like I went there.
I was like,

1081
00:59:14.891 --> 00:59:19.240
where is this place?
It's like,
no,
it's in downtown Boston.
Downtown.
I don't know.

1082
00:59:19.241 --> 00:59:23.060
It just seemed weird.
Don't like,
no,
I like basic.
We've won a bunch of titles.

1083
00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:27.560
I liked it.
I was us working on the heat boards.
You like,
they're the swan boats.

1084
00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:32.330
I liked it.
I liked the food.
I respect the sports.
I could.
You not respect them.

1085
00:59:32.331 --> 00:59:36.170
I love Larry Joe Berger.
It's his birthday today.
Larry Joe Bird.
Love Him.

1086
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:41.120
Is it really real big Boston fan?
It's Larry.
Joe Burns.
He'll rest his soul.
It's,

1087
00:59:41.121 --> 00:59:43.190
we're taping this on the seventh.
It's his birthday too.

1088
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:45.260
I never knew they had the same bird then.
He loved Larry Bird.

1089
00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:48.560
I asked him why didn't you like him over Magic Johnson cause he goes,

1090
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:52.450
cause Larry made me feel like I could make the league too.
Right?
Yeah,

1091
00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:56.200
he made it feel like anyone could do it.
Yeah.
So let's see.
This is,

1092
00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:59.540
this is the old thing about the Boston Celtics and I told him you something

1093
00:59:59.541 --> 01:00:02.660
after your thing.
Go ahead.
I grew up hating the Celtics.

1094
01:00:02.661 --> 01:00:05.690
I couldn't even appreciate how good they were and how good Larry Bird was.

1095
01:00:05.691 --> 01:00:07.910
Although I x because we killed the next everybody.

1096
01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.270
I hated them and people used to have,

1097
01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:14.180
my nickname in Brooklyn is Larry Bird because of the way I look and you know

1098
01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.990
dude,
if you could grow one of those awful mustaches,
remember coloring.

1099
01:00:17.991 --> 01:00:21.080
I don't look like Larry Bird.
No,
I don't look like,
and we just said,

1100
01:00:21.081 --> 01:00:23.630
I just cause I play basketball and I have,
you know,

1101
01:00:23.631 --> 01:00:27.590
but I never had a fucking what do they have a Shag or what does the thing had

1102
01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:31.000
the haircut every white dude had in the 80s everybody had that idea.

1103
01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:34.250
I do have that.
They never Molly,
but I was feathered.
You feathered it.

1104
01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:38.320
I did feather what she did.
I should have a patient bet you had some sort of a,

1105
01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:40.700
with your liking of hip hop and everything.

1106
01:00:40.701 --> 01:00:44.400
You probably had one of those thin Puerto Rican I wish shaped up and I sit down

1107
01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:46.150
at the time when Larry looked like Larry Bird.
No,

1108
01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.970
at the time I was too young to have one but are also with,
but,

1109
01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.140
but I'll tell you something.
I told you this,

1110
01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:55.820
I really love the Celtics team that they have now and what they did to Miami

1111
01:00:55.821 --> 01:00:59.300
last year,
pushing them to game seven and that was one of my favorite team.

1112
01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:03.580
Celtic teams evolve all heart.
I was rooting for them so hard and,

1113
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:06.680
and I've had mixed feelings about Kevin Garnett pushing that.
He's a Celtic.

1114
01:01:06.681 --> 01:01:09.290
I respect him.
I love his career.
He's awesome.

1115
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:14.140
The way he plays his inspires me and what I do,
he plays at the same level to,

1116
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:16.830
and they went out on their fucking shields last year.

1117
01:01:16.831 --> 01:01:20.640
I almost beat those mother fuckers cause I don't care who it is.
The Knicks,

1118
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:23.120
the nets,
the Utah Jazz,

1119
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:25.970
the fucking New Orleans Pelicans or whatever they're becoming.

1120
01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:29.360
Somebody needs to beat the heat.
You don't like to he see me.

1121
01:01:29.361 --> 01:01:31.160
I feel that way about the Lakers.

1122
01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.250
I hate the Lakers and I actually think Koby Bryant,

1123
01:01:34.251 --> 01:01:35.570
this will get me some fucking emails.

1124
01:01:35.571 --> 01:01:39.800
I think he's one of the most overrated crazy five time champions.
Crazy time.

1125
01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:42.800
Well go ahead.
I can argue it.
What it,
what can you say he,

1126
01:01:42.801 --> 01:01:45.050
he's been on nothing but pile on teams.

1127
01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:48.590
Like everything that they give Lebron Shit for doing going into Miami.

1128
01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:49.820
Coby has been living,

1129
01:01:49.821 --> 01:01:53.300
he just hasn't had to leave cause they bring everybody and do what he did the

1130
01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:55.250
other night when he walked off the court with 10 seconds left.

1131
01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:59.240
Did you see that shit?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dude.
You know what?
It was four seconds,

1132
01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:02.840
four seconds,
whatever you did,
you left your teammates sitting out there.

1133
01:02:02.841 --> 01:02:05.570
All that does is breed resentment.
That guy is a cancer.

1134
01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:09.470
He's one of the greatest individual one on one players ever since Jordan,

1135
01:02:09.471 --> 01:02:11.420
I would say he's number two behind Jordan,

1136
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:13.520
but he doesn't make anybody better around him.

1137
01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:16.370
He may eat pig breeds fucking resentment.
I agree.

1138
01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:20.760
I so love cozy kills me is that he's a blood.
He's a,

1139
01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:24.530
he's an animal and that's what he has over the rest.
Listen,
here's a story.

1140
01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:27.110
Here's a debate.
I have to say this before.
People see you see Colby,

1141
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.710
who to play with the five stitches.

1142
01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:31.350
Do you think Coby Bryan would have played with the five stitches?

1143
01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.810
And I'm not disrespected,
Carmelo,
I love you,

1144
01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:38.070
but do you think Colby Bryan would be missing a leg and he would play.

1145
01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:39.810
He would have played against Miami last night.

1146
01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:41.880
That's the difference between him and everybody else,

1147
01:02:41.881 --> 01:02:43.290
but this is my criticism of the guy.

1148
01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.670
The guy does not know how to get along with the other fucking people.
I,

1149
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:50.010
he's a savant.
He,
he,
he's the Bobby Fischer of basketball.

1150
01:02:50.011 --> 01:02:53.490
Fucking ran shack out of town.
Like he said the other day they'd go,

1151
01:02:53.491 --> 01:02:56.490
you're going to score your 30th thousand point.
Did you ever think you do that?

1152
01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.240
And he says,
well,
you know,
I'm not into individual stuff.
I've just was.

1153
01:03:00.241 --> 01:03:01.620
To me it was always about champions.

1154
01:03:01.621 --> 01:03:04.710
It's like that's why you ran shack out of town at the height of his fucking

1155
01:03:04.711 --> 01:03:07.350
powers.
You'd won three championships in four years.

1156
01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:10.920
Shaq leaves the very next year he wins one with the heat.
But you can get,

1157
01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:13.700
but you got your 50 a game.
I'm not saying that he,

1158
01:03:13.810 --> 01:03:17.460
he hasn't done some things that he probably regrets.
He would never say this,

1159
01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:21.300
but I'm saying I love that guy in his game and I've learned to appreciate him

1160
01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:24.810
and,
and his tenacity and his intensity.
Let's listen.

1161
01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.040
They're not saying anything that nobody hasn't said.

1162
01:03:29.041 --> 01:03:33.720
All they do is blow Coby and boredom.
He makes your fucking giving him,

1163
01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:36.900
I'm a Knicks fan.
So what?
I'll give him what?
He deserves a fucking hand job.

1164
01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:40.310
And you know what?
I was at that break.
First of all,
let's go back.
No,

1165
01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.900
he would have played with the stitches that Carmelo Mike Dunn,

1166
01:03:42.901 --> 01:03:46.440
you're talking too loud.
Carmelo.
I love.
Carmelo was retarded.

1167
01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.170
He's sick and he's becoming a great,

1168
01:03:49.171 --> 01:03:52.810
great team player and a winner and and and,
and all that.
She is and I,

1169
01:03:52.811 --> 01:03:56.820
I've definitely seen that and his talent is immense.
His,
his talent does,

1170
01:03:56.821 --> 01:04:00.300
he meant,
but last night while I was watching that gave me like he might play,

1171
01:04:00.301 --> 01:04:01.134
you might not play,

1172
01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:03.870
you know what I played with last night with five stitches on your non shooting

1173
01:04:03.871 --> 01:04:07.890
it Allen Iverson where the played Koby Bryant Woods.
Michael Jordan.

1174
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:11.820
I'm not questioning the guy's heart.
Know anyone else in the NBA.

1175
01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:16.560
His inability to get along with other fucking guys has fucked the Lakers.

1176
01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:18.390
Like I feel like dude,
the amount of times,

1177
01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:21.390
I'm trying to think like all those championship runs in the finals.

1178
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:24.780
When is he just taken over a fucking series?
Has He ever done that?

1179
01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:29.730
Didn't he do that against you guys when that series that we just not we,

1180
01:04:29.731 --> 01:04:32.100
they just beat you like what was it?
This was his quote.
The loan.

1181
01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:34.470
They just beat us last time.
He said,
I don't know how we won that game.

1182
01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:37.140
The MVP of the game,
seven of that series was,

1183
01:04:37.141 --> 01:04:40.800
it was the fucking officiating crew.
We,
we,
we,

1184
01:04:40.850 --> 01:04:44.580
I'm not repeat June called like fucking beat you.
Yes they did.
They won.

1185
01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:48.000
And this is my thing,
dude.
If somebody beats me like the fucking giants,

1186
01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.680
they fucking beat us.
I don't,

1187
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:53.250
I don't mean in the Superbowl last year and the Superbowl before that.

1188
01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:56.020
You mean when they beat the Patriots twice and seeing them last?

1189
01:04:57.090 --> 01:04:59.580
You remember they did.
Oh,
that's right.
Oh,
sorry.
Okay.

1190
01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:02.360
When do you mean when they beat them?
When you guys were 18 and older.

1191
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:03.690
I just gonna let you get through this.
Go ahead.

1192
01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:05.740
And then they beat you in the Superbowl.

1193
01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.920
Are you talking about that year or you saw my last year?

1194
01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:10.740
I'm talking about last year when they beat you in this role was,

1195
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:15.350
was that last year?
I'm sorry,
I get confused with talking about you feel better.

1196
01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.650
I'm just,
I get confused though.

1197
01:05:16.651 --> 01:05:20.110
Better bitch about when the giants beat the New England patriots in the last two

1198
01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:24.670
Superbowl because it happened twice.
Twice.
I give it up,

1199
01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:29.590
I definitely give it up.
Okay.
But my thing about the a,
a Celtics,

1200
01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:32.920
this is,
I'm just saying as a fan here,
Celtics,
Lakers,

1201
01:05:32.921 --> 01:05:36.850
finals should be decided by the players.
You put your fucking whistle away,

1202
01:05:36.851 --> 01:05:39.660
you don't call 35 fucking files in one team sites here and there.

1203
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:44.740
And I sat there and watched the Lakers make a fourth quarter comeback against

1204
01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:48.010
the Celtics from the fucking fall line.
I remember,

1205
01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:52.120
if you tell me one memorable fucking shot in that fucking game,

1206
01:05:52.121 --> 01:05:54.160
there's only one was metal world peace.

1207
01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:57.610
He hit a three pointer and the only thing that made it memorable is was he was

1208
01:05:57.611 --> 01:06:00.700
so fucking high on whatever the fuck his therapists gave him.

1209
01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:05.050
He was waving to the crowd like he was already at the fucking parade.
That was,

1210
01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:07.480
that was the only memorable.
Other than that,

1211
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:10.990
it was received Wallace just standing there as Coby jumps into them,

1212
01:06:11.110 --> 01:06:14.560
which I can see a no call but to call a fucking offensive foul like,

1213
01:06:14.561 --> 01:06:16.750
and Colby said at the end again,
because I don't know how we won that game.

1214
01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:21.280
All right,
so I'm saying that this guy,
he's sick and individual.

1215
01:06:21.281 --> 01:06:22.560
The individual.
Yeah.

1216
01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:24.820
You're one of those guys probably thought Peyton manning was better than Brady

1217
01:06:24.821 --> 01:06:28.990
too,
for the longest.
Fuck no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I'm not saying there's not flaws that I

1218
01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:35.230
pay.
My copay might be hating my hating Coby phase two,
but I don't listen.

1219
01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:38.410
I respect you think you'd think the sick.
You would think that.
I hate the guy.

1220
01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.300
I don't,
I don't.

1221
01:06:40.301 --> 01:06:45.301
But my fucking thing about that guy is he's really in a very openly way a

1222
01:06:45.941 --> 01:06:50.770
fucking cancer.
He's the Bobby Fischer of the NBA.
He's like,
he,
he,
he's,

1223
01:06:50.771 --> 01:06:53.050
you know what he is?
He's reversed magic Johnson.

1224
01:06:53.330 --> 01:06:58.330
Magic Johnson could walk into a locker room and look at me on his team

1225
01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:03.550
inexplicably and he could somehow figure out where he needed to give me the
ball,

1226
01:07:03.551 --> 01:07:06.280
which would probably be right under the fucking net.
And he would,

1227
01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:08.950
I would somehow get eight points.
I agree.

1228
01:07:08.951 --> 01:07:11.650
Colby would walk in and would fucking be like,

1229
01:07:11.651 --> 01:07:15.690
get that fucking piece of Shit Outta here.
And he'd tell you to get the fuck out.

1230
01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:18.280
And people think that's because he gives a fuck.

1231
01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:21.310
He gives a fuck about himself through those championships.

1232
01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:25.150
He doesn't go to the front fucking office because he wants the Lakers and the

1233
01:07:25.151 --> 01:07:26.470
team to win a championship.

1234
01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:30.190
He like that winning championships is another individual stack for him.

1235
01:07:30.191 --> 01:07:34.780
It's all about fucking him.
That's that.
That's my complaint about that.

1236
01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:38.800
I'm not going to argue or debate with you about any of that shit.

1237
01:07:39.010 --> 01:07:41.260
I think the guy's retarded though.

1238
01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:45.730
I say that in three minutes away in an in an effective one on one,

1239
01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:50.950
one sheer he days.
The fact that he,
he's never,
you're never gonna see him dip.

1240
01:07:51.130 --> 01:07:53.500
He's never going to dip.
No Louie.
Absolutely.

1241
01:07:53.501 --> 01:07:56.950
But the thing about it is though is if you really give a fuck about winning

1242
01:07:56.951 --> 01:07:59.380
championships,
you don't walk out on your teeth.
Dude.

1243
01:07:59.381 --> 01:08:02.470
He made everybody on that team.
His bitch at that point,

1244
01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:07.060
I know becomes his dude in fucking Dwight.
When did it become Dwight Howard,

1245
01:08:07.061 --> 01:08:08.790
by the way?
What?
Are there any saying?

1246
01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:12.460
Everybody goes to Dwight Howard and la though the stew and those guys on the

1247
01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:15.740
[inaudible] sale last night on on TBS when I was watching your next beat,

1248
01:08:15.741 --> 01:08:19.940
the heat.
Everyone's going,
Dwight Howard.
I don't know.
I don't like his headband.

1249
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:23.870
I think it's fucking with them.
Take that had been,
how old were you?

1250
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:27.410
What are you doing?
Put It on straight.
Do something.

1251
01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:29.590
And I'm like the headband though.
They've brought every,

1252
01:08:29.591 --> 01:08:30.920
but another thing too about his five.

1253
01:08:31.190 --> 01:08:34.670
They brought everybody in short of Jesus Christ to help this guy get five

1254
01:08:34.671 --> 01:08:35.420
fucking rings.

1255
01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:38.830
And then they compare him to Colby Bryant who had Luc Longley and bill car to

1256
01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:42.200
Jordan.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
As you to Jordan.
That's how he won with,

1257
01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:46.620
give me a fucking break.
All right.
Listen.
The rings of the Rings and,

1258
01:08:46.621 --> 01:08:50.540
and that's,
that ring is the thing.
That's not it.
That's not it.
It's different.

1259
01:08:50.541 --> 01:08:53.780
It's like the steroid era and not the steroid ever.
This is the pile on error.

1260
01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:56.630
They should,
there should be,
oh,
it is the pilot error.
Give me a fucking,

1261
01:08:56.631 --> 01:09:01.200
Miami started it.
Miami started that bullshit.
The Lakers been piloting

1262
01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:07.490
that was a pylon champion.
Yeah,
so I can fucking admit that.
Yeah.

1263
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:11.300
Pile on championship.
Miami's was a pile of champion to Shaq,

1264
01:09:11.301 --> 01:09:13.040
Phil Jackson and all those fucking guys that,

1265
01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:17.270
that was a pilot like do they like the Yankees?
A fucking bass.
I agree.
They just,

1266
01:09:17.271 --> 01:09:20.540
every year they're going to be signing these giant green can guys.
I agree.

1267
01:09:20.541 --> 01:09:24.560
I'm an elite this fan like that.
I'm not going to sit here and defend the Lakers,

1268
01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:25.910
eh,
the way like that.

1269
01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:29.360
I'm just saying I want somebody to make sure they beat the heat.

1270
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:32.720
I love the showtime Lakers and as much as I hated those guys,

1271
01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:36.740
like back then when like they had a crew tool,
but this is,
the thing happened.

1272
01:09:36.741 --> 01:09:40.130
It was like draft picks,
but the whole Mba was different then.
I know,

1273
01:09:40.131 --> 01:09:44.270
but I wish it went back to that where it was just like year after fucking you've

1274
01:09:44.271 --> 01:09:46.580
got to groom your guy.
When the six came in,

1275
01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:50.480
you knew who was coming to town and you had fucking three years of fucking hate.

1276
01:09:50.570 --> 01:09:54.380
I agree.
Now it's like the guy you fucking hate the most the next year,

1277
01:09:54.381 --> 01:09:55.760
all of a sudden he's on your team.

1278
01:09:55.820 --> 01:10:00.080
I agree with in the fucking hat on and it's no Ray Allen did I?

1279
01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:04.550
I'm with Kevin Garnett.
I don't say hello.
I'm on that shit.
I is a Boston fan.

1280
01:10:04.551 --> 01:10:06.710
Don't mind what he did cause he wasn't ours to begin with.

1281
01:10:06.711 --> 01:10:09.860
We got him as a free agent.
Fine.
But he knew what he was.
Go there.

1282
01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:13.130
Don't go down there to Miami because that's the way it's done now they all

1283
01:10:13.131 --> 01:10:15.770
fucking hang out and drink pina coladas and the off season.

1284
01:10:15.771 --> 01:10:19.550
They were all friends.
What have you,
you and you and me all got on the stage.

1285
01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:23.180
Bullshit.
And then we'll,
and then we're like Larry and magic seat.

1286
01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:26.060
You're coming around to my side.
I would say,
I don't want you to know that,
hey,

1287
01:10:26.061 --> 01:10:28.310
it's all that Aau shit.
They all grew up together.

1288
01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:29.450
That's the problem with the MBA.

1289
01:10:29.451 --> 01:10:33.080
They all grew up together playing basketball since were 1112 years old.

1290
01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:34.550
You're not going to fight them.

1291
01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:39.590
Moses Malone met bill in beer on a basketball court.

1292
01:10:39.591 --> 01:10:43.520
Moses Malone met doctor met me when against Kareem Abdul Jabbar when they came

1293
01:10:43.521 --> 01:10:47.570
out their magic and Larry,
the first time they went out,
they met face to face,

1294
01:10:47.571 --> 01:10:50.910
was playing against each other.
Right.
Does shit they do now they,

1295
01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:52.970
they travel and they're 11,
12.

1296
01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:55.130
Everybody's kissing and hugging and they're all friends.

1297
01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.540
That's what's wrong with the NBA.

1298
01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:00.680
You think the fucking Lani Shelton was hanging out with Darryl Dawkins?

1299
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:04.810
Hell fucking no.
You know Lonnie Shelton is you ani sung is a Seattle.

1300
01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:07.130
The Seattle supersize me.
He was like a goon.

1301
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:10.580
You looked at Bob Linear and artists Gilmore were like,
you know,

1302
01:11:10.581 --> 01:11:14.160
yucking it up during the off season and in,
in,
in Cabo.
Fuck no,

1303
01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.000
these guys were all kissing and hugging.
That's what I,
so my thing is,

1304
01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:19.850
even in the NFL and seed is doing,

1305
01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:23.520
cause I already always sound like a fucking crabby old man with a Tampon.

1306
01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:27.930
But like my thing is,
if that's how it's done now,

1307
01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:32.620
that's how it's done now.
But don't fucking put these people in the same,
uh,

1308
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:34.740
category is Larry Byrd who,
you know,

1309
01:11:34.741 --> 01:11:36.660
come and we played like a bunch of sissies last night.

1310
01:11:36.661 --> 01:11:41.490
No fucking lay up this game and like that type of Shit won't have is gone.

1311
01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:45.210
It's gone.
You'll never see the choose like when doc and Larry fought,

1312
01:11:45.211 --> 01:11:48.030
that was shocking.
You will never see that happen.

1313
01:11:48.031 --> 01:11:52.500
Now you like Lebron and Kolby won't get into a fist fight with Dwayne wade did

1314
01:11:52.501 --> 01:11:56.590
to Coby last year during the All star game.
See,
that's why I like Coby Bryan.

1315
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:59.400
See like memory,
like I liked them too.
I like him,

1316
01:11:59.401 --> 01:12:01.200
but I'm just saying like he's on that shit.

1317
01:12:01.201 --> 01:12:03.240
But this is the thing on that alliance claims shit.

1318
01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:06.150
Colbys if he acts like a fucking asshole,
like Steven A.

1319
01:12:06.150 --> 01:12:07.950
Smith was still blowing the guy.
It's just like,
dude,

1320
01:12:07.951 --> 01:12:12.270
he walked off this from his fucking team.
Call them hour.
I agree.
I agree.

1321
01:12:12.271 --> 01:12:15.630
But Colbys on that shit though.
That old school shit.
Like,
he's like,

1322
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:20.250
fuck these guys.
He's literally like,
fuck these guys and I liked that.

1323
01:12:20.251 --> 01:12:22.680
Fuck these guys.
And he's like,
fuck these guys.
I think he's like,

1324
01:12:22.681 --> 01:12:25.620
fuck these guys when he's playing you and at the end of the year he goes,

1325
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:29.430
fuck this.
Those guys just beat us.
Get,
get us their best guy.

1326
01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:32.250
I don't know about all that me,
but I like that.
He's like,

1327
01:12:32.251 --> 01:12:34.380
fuck these guys and I liked that.
Garnette is like,

1328
01:12:34.381 --> 01:12:38.250
fuck these guys and you want to go to the Miami Heat then fuck you Jesus.

1329
01:12:38.251 --> 01:12:43.170
Shuttlesworth fuck you.
I liked that.
He's like,
I see what you're saying.

1330
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:47.130
No,
Colby is a hard guy to have even as a fucking Celtic fan,
but my,
my,

1331
01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:51.750
it just pisses me off when they compare these guys today where he's the closest

1332
01:12:51.751 --> 01:12:55.980
comparison you can make though.
Now we isn't.
Yes,
he is.
And all the guys left.

1333
01:12:56.010 --> 01:13:00.140
Coby.
Brian is an old city.
Paris is not even close.
I didn't see,
I say,

1334
01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:02.610
I said he's the closest and you're saying not even close.

1335
01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:06.570
He doesn't make anybody around a better,
he's all about himself.

1336
01:13:06.571 --> 01:13:10.140
He's not about the team.
I agree.
Like magic wasn't like that.

1337
01:13:10.141 --> 01:13:13.030
Larry wasn't like that doctor Jay was one of those guys weren't like that.

1338
01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:17.250
That tenacity day.
Berlin was like that.
Yeah.
Well that's a whole other story.

1339
01:13:17.251 --> 01:13:20.210
I'm just saying.
I'm just saying,
I'm just trying to,

1340
01:13:20.211 --> 01:13:25.020
Russell is the most overrated icon.
It's an esports.
They was like,

1341
01:13:25.021 --> 01:13:27.060
it was like when Lebron was playing in high school,

1342
01:13:27.061 --> 01:13:29.370
you know those clips of him playing ice,
cause it's all your pain.

1343
01:13:29.490 --> 01:13:32.130
The pimple faced,
you know,
the 17 year olds.

1344
01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:34.620
That's what Bill Russel was when he's playing in the NBA.

1345
01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:38.100
I'm not saying he wasn't great,
but he never got to compete against,
you know,

1346
01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:41.430
consistently good competition.
If you're only at William Chamberlain,

1347
01:13:41.431 --> 01:13:45.420
he's not a good just,
just ruled Baylor,
Jerry West nine centers.

1348
01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:47.790
These are not centers.
Of course,
you're going to block every shot.

1349
01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:51.540
You're seven feet every with the biggest guys I know would be white guys a lot.

1350
01:13:51.541 --> 01:13:55.200
We beat you guys.
A lot of this is coming from just saying that whole,

1351
01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:59.040
the 11 championships,
whatever.
Look,
now I'll,
I'll go,
I'll go with this.

1352
01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.820
I'll go with this.
Um,
what would bill,
what would bill Russell be now?

1353
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.480
He'd be like,
he'd be like,
uh,
you know what?
He'd be in the NBA Today.

1354
01:14:06.481 --> 01:14:11.320
He'd be like surge a Baka if he was lucky.
No,
that's,
he was lucky.
No,

1355
01:14:11.321 --> 01:14:15.340
that's if you teleported him.
But if he actually came up in this era with his,

1356
01:14:15.341 --> 01:14:18.110
with his talent,
with Bass,
the basketball knowledge,

1357
01:14:18.111 --> 01:14:21.130
I'm gonna get so much trouble for saying that the nutrition that they have,

1358
01:14:21.131 --> 01:14:23.080
they'd all be bulked up.
You can't compare different hours.

1359
01:14:23.081 --> 01:14:26.770
But I will say this early on,
you know,
like those,

1360
01:14:26.890 --> 01:14:28.930
every sport has that fucking team that,

1361
01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:33.190
that went on a run back during the 23 skidoo years.
You know what I mean?

1362
01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:36.580
And it's just like you could do,
yeah,
you can,
you can,
you just like,
all right,

1363
01:14:36.581 --> 01:14:37.240
well,
I mean,

1364
01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:40.210
I probably could have made the fucking league back then meet soon as it just

1365
01:14:40.211 --> 01:14:43.360
came in.
I mean,
which I couldn't,
but the only period,
like the person,
like,

1366
01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:47.990
like the Yankees are a team as much as I fucking hate him.
Where the,

1367
01:14:48.130 --> 01:14:51.380
what makes them the greatest franchise ever.
I think more so than,
you know,

1368
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:56.430
the 27 that they talked about is that they went babe Ruth to Lou Gehrig to Joe

1369
01:14:58.930 --> 01:15:03.430
Dimaggio to Mickey Mantle.
You talking like 40 fucking years of getting Jordan?

1370
01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:07.720
Yes.
In a row and everybody else's scouting people.

1371
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:10.530
When we fucking sold Babe Ruth,
we were morons.

1372
01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:14.530
That's why I hated the curse of Babe.
I felt that was a cop out.
It's like,
no,

1373
01:15:14.531 --> 01:15:17.560
we're fucking idiots.
You know,
there was an occurrence.
It was just,

1374
01:15:17.561 --> 01:15:21.880
you guys fucked up unbelievably and deserved every,

1375
01:15:21.881 --> 01:15:26.110
not the fans,
but the organization does or they could've got done any jack,

1376
01:15:26.111 --> 01:15:29.620
you guys,
those titles,
they could've given a don't give us what title,

1377
01:15:29.621 --> 01:15:31.060
the two titles you want.
I don't even,

1378
01:15:31.090 --> 01:15:33.790
they don't really count and I'm on the time of good.
This makes me feel,

1379
01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.820
I didn't like any Laker fan lists me bitching about Colby.

1380
01:15:36.821 --> 01:15:39.510
How happy that made them.
Those titles don't even count to me.
Yeah,

1381
01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:42.310
why would they?
They just don't count.
Yeah.
Why would they come to you?

1382
01:15:42.730 --> 01:15:45.580
Because they're just whatever meg it God got,
Hey,

1383
01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:49.840
we were just down three games to none to a $215 million team.
You know,

1384
01:15:49.841 --> 01:15:51.470
we came back.
Oh you do?

1385
01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:56.140
Do you know that'll never happen again unless the New York Yankees steward to

1386
01:15:56.141 --> 01:16:01.141
have another $215 million team with like four first ballot hall of famers choke

1387
01:16:02.381 --> 01:16:03.430
away four games in a row.

1388
01:16:03.431 --> 01:16:05.830
You're never going to see it again unless the fucking Yankees do it.

1389
01:16:05.831 --> 01:16:10.180
Cause they're the only ones who can afford a $250 million fucking team.
Yes.

1390
01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:12.920
Yeah.
That's all I'm gonna say.
Yes.
Yeah.
You just gotta.

1391
01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:15.520
You gotta take that one the same way.
I got to take your giant shit.
Oh,

1392
01:16:15.521 --> 01:16:19.510
you mean when they beat the fucking patriots?
Yeah.
Oh Shit.
That's crazy.

1393
01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.020
It all circles back.
It's a circle of life.
Speaking the curse of the bay.

1394
01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:26.620
Somebody wanted me to ask you this.
Go ahead.
Let me see here.

1395
01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:29.920
Evidently you were on one of those ghost stories.
Yes.

1396
01:16:29.921 --> 01:16:34.890
Celebrity ghost stories thing and they bluntly asked her,
where the fuck is this?

1397
01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:38.470
Ha ha ha ha.
It was totally real.
That's what they said.

1398
01:16:38.471 --> 01:16:39.281
So you knew they were going to say,

1399
01:16:39.281 --> 01:16:42.790
they wouldn't say how full of Shit I got to see this here.
No,

1400
01:16:42.791 --> 01:16:47.410
but we got parked to the part two is even better.
It's coming up on 'em fuck,

1401
01:16:47.411 --> 01:16:51.100
I don't know the name of the new show,
but it's uh,
something,
something.

1402
01:16:51.101 --> 01:16:53.860
And we went back to school.
Me and the friend that it's pretty good.

1403
01:16:53.890 --> 01:16:56.440
Well tell me what happened cause I missed and I know I'm a familiar with the

1404
01:16:56.441 --> 01:17:00.350
show where it's like celebrities had a gun counter with a ghost man and,
and I,

1405
01:17:00.351 --> 01:17:01.030
and I went in there,

1406
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:05.440
he told it and it was real and that you believe in ghosts.

1407
01:17:05.970 --> 01:17:09.070
I said eye for eye.
I had a ghost encounter.

1408
01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:13.130
I can't find the fucking thing.
All right,
fine.
Second,
wait a second.

1409
01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:15.810
So take me through this cause I think,

1410
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:20.310
I think he'd just afraid of the dark.
No,
no,
no,
I'm not.
It was in,

1411
01:17:20.311 --> 01:17:22.390
it was in high school.
I went to a really old high school.

1412
01:17:22.670 --> 01:17:27.200
Billy Cunningham went to Doug Moe and Barbara Streisand and the rapper special

1413
01:17:27.201 --> 01:17:30.950
Ed.
Wow.
Yeah,
that's a pretty eclectic,

1414
01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:34.980
it was eclectic mix of p Rasmus whole high school in Brooklyn.
Okay.
And we were,

1415
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:37.730
wait,
I thought you from Manhattan.
I went to high school.

1416
01:17:37.731 --> 01:17:39.470
I had gotten kicked out of every two.

1417
01:17:39.471 --> 01:17:43.270
We read an hour and seven towel effort of listens this shit or fucking,

1418
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:46.800
I got to hear the get go.
Let's,
we'll wrap it up with what?
The ghost story.

1419
01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:49.220
It's not worth it and trust me.
Yes it is.
I promise.

1420
01:17:49.221 --> 01:17:52.610
I want to give you shit about this.
I promise you it's not.
There's other things.

1421
01:17:52.611 --> 01:17:56.120
Give me enough.
Fuck you.
You saw a ghost.
I want to hear this.
All right.

1422
01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:58.870
So we were in high school,
we got locked in a room and she was,

1423
01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:02.570
we does 15 years old and we've got the shit scared out of us.
So you know,

1424
01:18:02.571 --> 01:18:06.570
my friend,
boom,
we went on the thing and I talked about it,
but the,
the part,
no,

1425
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:11.480
no,
no,
no.
Slow it down.
Where did your in you,
you were in this high school.

1426
01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:15.170
It's really old.
It's a really old high school.
There's ghosts in there.

1427
01:18:15.171 --> 01:18:17.210
Like it's known.
It's known that this goes,

1428
01:18:17.211 --> 01:18:21.290
so you're in there and you're going to your science class.
Is this after hours?

1429
01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.270
It was after school.
It was like during um,

1430
01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.770
dusk goes number come out during the day.
We had a,
we had the tension,

1431
01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:28.970
you had detention.
It was like,

1432
01:18:28.971 --> 01:18:32.080
it was like the urban urban aversion of the breakfast club.

1433
01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:35.860
It was like the Brooklyn version of the breakfast club.
So you know,

1434
01:18:35.970 --> 01:18:39.980
it was like that.
And we got instead of weed and he had coke,
coke,

1435
01:18:39.981 --> 01:18:44.210
crack sniffing it.
Not Drinking Beers in forties.

1436
01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:48.440
But even if you know,
you know,
they make things seem heightened on the,

1437
01:18:48.441 --> 01:18:53.390
on the celebrity ghost stories.
So it's you again,

1438
01:18:55.430 --> 01:19:00.040
I don't want to talk about it.
I went,
oh my God.
Oh,

1439
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:03.070
okay.
All right.
Okay.
All right.
Well we just,
deep boats is,

1440
01:19:03.071 --> 01:19:06.080
it's too hard to talk about.
It's emotional.
It makes me,

1441
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:09.470
I don't want to get so because we're taught here today and it brings you to a

1442
01:19:09.471 --> 01:19:11.420
bad spot.
I want you to have a good time.

1443
01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:15.480
I don't want to bring up your true life ghost story that you told.
Yeah.

1444
01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.720
The reason I wanted to tell you the reason why I'm wearing my,

1445
01:19:18.010 --> 01:19:18.950
it's changed the subject.

1446
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:22.880
So we usually to wearing my giants tee shirt and my matching giant sneakers is

1447
01:19:22.881 --> 01:19:24.910
because my son has his playoff game today.

1448
01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:27.560
Looks like a make a wish kid with that matching shit on it.
But go ahead.

1449
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:29.810
Cause we're,
we're,
we have a playoff game today.

1450
01:19:30.490 --> 01:19:33.320
I have to get to the field and hour and a half before to check the grass,

1451
01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:36.260
make sure everything's good.
Cause you know,
it's,
it's the,
uh,
it's uh,

1452
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:41.150
what's he playing?
Soccer,
football,
football,
football.
But you know,
he's 10.

1453
01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:44.180
I,
you know,
I,
I'm the inspiration,
I'm not the coach,
but I'm the,

1454
01:19:44.181 --> 01:19:48.080
the inspirational leader of the team and I have to get the firemen Ed.

1455
01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:53.340
Exactly.
Exactly what I am.
Nice.
Exactly what I am,
um,
uh,

1456
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:58.310
of the,
of the Barrington of the Barrington,
uh,
a 10 year old,
uh,

1457
01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:01.090
league.
I am the firemen at the time.

1458
01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:05.060
We won the Superbowl last year and we have our playoff game today.

1459
01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:08.160
And you know there's other yelling at the other little kids.
That's right,

1460
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:12.000
<v 1>bitch.
I know.
I never,
I,
I'm,
I'm actually very good in that way.</v>

1461
01:20:12.001 --> 01:20:16.890
But I will say one game that we played,
it wasn't Tony Gonzalez,
his kid,

1462
01:20:16.891 --> 01:20:18.210
but Tony's gung exalts.

1463
01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:22.440
His kid was on that team this year we were losing and I was,
I was like,

1464
01:20:22.441 --> 01:20:25.410
we're going to win this game with three touches and every time we'd score a

1465
01:20:25.411 --> 01:20:29.820
touch on,
not Tony's a Gonzales's kid,
but he was on their team.
But this fat kid,

1466
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.170
again,
not,
not Tony's kid,
was a,
what's the big deal?
You,

1467
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:36.390
you just got one touchdown and I ignored him the first time.

1468
01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:39.780
It as a kid in the crowd?
No,
on their team because I'm going nuts.

1469
01:20:39.810 --> 01:20:43.800
So this is a fat kid on the other team on the other nine year old at this point,

1470
01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:49.230
10 between 10 and 12 he could be 10 or 12 the way you make him sound 12 so you

1471
01:20:49.231 --> 01:20:52.280
don't sound that bad.
That's the looking at whole fat 12 year olds hockey.

1472
01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:55.850
He's hockey me to,
what's the big deal is,
hey,
I don't say anything to them.

1473
01:20:56.220 --> 01:21:00.420
And then we score again.
Now we're down six points.
These guys,
he said this to me,

1474
01:21:00.421 --> 01:21:03.960
this is a little kits at,
this guy's getting so excited every time they score,

1475
01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.070
I'm looking over and I'm like,
and then I said,
hey,
don't,
don't speak to me.

1476
01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:11.040
You're not allowed to talk to me.
And then when we won the game,

1477
01:21:11.041 --> 01:21:13.080
we find that when the head and yeah,

1478
01:21:13.130 --> 01:21:17.850
because we're only going to want to be like you fat.
Fuck listen,
Twinkies.
Okay.

1479
01:21:17.851 --> 01:21:21.180
And then you know,
stock up.
And you could say that back in the day too,
right?

1480
01:21:21.181 --> 01:21:24.990
You can't,
you could,
you could literally Duke it out with his dad and in the end,

1481
01:21:24.991 --> 01:21:27.540
even though his blood and teeth in the ground,
that would be no loss,
nothing,

1482
01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:30.300
nothing.
Anyway,
we won the game and after the game,
you know,

1483
01:21:30.301 --> 01:21:34.290
you'd line up in the handshake and Toby,
you saw me cause he was like,

1484
01:21:34.291 --> 01:21:38.310
this guy's nuts.
But I'm always really,
you know,
I know what you're in the stance,

1485
01:21:38.311 --> 01:21:41.760
so why are you out on the field?
I'm inspirational leader on vocational coach.

1486
01:21:41.761 --> 01:21:43.170
So I was actually,
because we were losing,

1487
01:21:43.171 --> 01:21:46.350
they brought me at halftime to come over there and give a speech.
Oh,

1488
01:21:46.351 --> 01:21:50.520
there you go.
So I gave a speech,
it's like my version of Hoosier is every week.

1489
01:21:50.521 --> 01:21:54.850
I love it.
But anyway,
so I gave,
I gave fats on a nice,
a good,

1490
01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:58.830
a good five and I'll pop on the,
on the ass after the game and said good game.

1491
01:21:59.010 --> 01:22:01.500
And they get mad enough.
No,

1492
01:22:01.501 --> 01:22:04.560
but he knew that we had a little thing and it was like,
you know,

1493
01:22:04.561 --> 01:22:06.760
it was like that moment in,
um,
in the hangover,
you know,

1494
01:22:06.761 --> 01:22:10.260
when the little kid was like,
but I was the little kid.
I was like,
fuck you.

1495
01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:14.760
So hopefully we'll play them in the,
in the playoffs there that the chiefs there,

1496
01:22:14.761 --> 01:22:17.630
the chair,
where are they at right now?
What level is it?
The,

1497
01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:20.100
is it the first round of the playoffs as a city is the first round of the

1498
01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:22.890
playoffs and we're playing the kid,
we're playing,

1499
01:22:22.891 --> 01:22:26.820
I have a speech plan out today and it's about us being a team and being brothers

1500
01:22:26.970 --> 01:22:30.810
and them having just one good player.
And Are you going to let one good player,

1501
01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:34.170
Pete,
you brothers,
something like that.
Hey,

1502
01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:36.780
I don't want to blow my load right now,
but it's a really good speech.

1503
01:22:36.781 --> 01:22:38.940
I haven't written down third.
You know what,
we're at the end here.

1504
01:22:38.941 --> 01:22:41.280
And you know what I completely forgot to bring up that I,

1505
01:22:41.281 --> 01:22:44.940
that I love was the documentary.
Oh thank you.
On a,
on a tribe called quest.

1506
01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:47.970
Thank you.
Thank you.
And there was a question that if people didn't see it,

1507
01:22:47.971 --> 01:22:50.810
like I'm,
I'm one of those people came way,
way late to the game.

1508
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:54.180
You talked about that when it comes to all a rap,
hip hop or yell,

1509
01:22:54.181 --> 01:22:57.660
you're supposed to call it.
And uh,
so like there's a bunch of stuff that,

1510
01:22:57.661 --> 01:22:58.410
you know,

1511
01:22:58.410 --> 01:23:03.000
like I was obviously familiar with them and I knew a lot of their stuff.
Know,
Yo,

1512
01:23:03.001 --> 01:23:07.000
MTV raps would put down,
but I didn't know to the level all of this stuff.

1513
01:23:07.001 --> 01:23:10.630
It was such a like,
even if you're not a fan of that music,
you'll love it.

1514
01:23:10.990 --> 01:23:13.180
You'll love this documentary.
Then you'll actually like me,

1515
01:23:13.181 --> 01:23:16.150
you'll start downloading all their music is for everybody.

1516
01:23:16.210 --> 01:23:18.880
I call him the rolling stones,
a hip hop there.
Music is,

1517
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:23.350
you can't not like the music or the Beatles of hip hop like their music is that

1518
01:23:23.351 --> 01:23:27.370
accessible in all ages.
Tribe called quest.
It was a pleasure doing it.

1519
01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:29.980
The name of the film is beats,
rhymes and life.

1520
01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:33.130
The travels of a tribe called quest.
It was a,
then everything's good.

1521
01:23:33.131 --> 01:23:36.190
Everything's smoothed over.
I know there was a little bit of drama.
They moved.

1522
01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:37.840
I mean I think you know that was all,

1523
01:23:37.841 --> 01:23:42.100
because they are very protective and and and,
and you know,

1524
01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:45.370
they understand what the legacy of a tribe called quest means to the fans.

1525
01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:49.630
I do too.
That's why I made the movie.
I came at it as a fan.
I loved the group.

1526
01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:53.240
I didn't know anything about them and I didn't think it showed them in a bad
way.

1527
01:23:53.241 --> 01:23:56.260
It just made me want to download this stuff in Britain and respected them.

1528
01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.340
That's why I made the movie.

1529
01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:02.730
That's why I made it wasn't the first time saw a documentary director got into

1530
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:05.780
with the subject of a documentary and it's not going to be the last time.
Um,

1531
01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:08.500
I think it takes,
I think feet people freak out right before it comes out.

1532
01:24:08.501 --> 01:24:11.110
You're like,
oh my God,
is this God?
Is this going to ruin me?
It'd be,

1533
01:24:11.111 --> 01:24:16.030
I understand you do you know a Burt Reynolds I heard before a boogie nights
came,

1534
01:24:16.031 --> 01:24:19.090
right?
Like freaked out.
He walked out of a screening.
Yeah,

1535
01:24:19.091 --> 01:24:21.150
maybe even fired his agent.
He was just like,
what?

1536
01:24:21.190 --> 01:24:24.010
Why didn't you put me in this piece of shit?
Now it's like everybody loves it.

1537
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:26.920
Trust me.
If somebody was filming a documentary of,
of,
of,

1538
01:24:26.921 --> 01:24:28.990
of my life and they were doing this segment,

1539
01:24:28.991 --> 01:24:31.750
you think I'd want this segment and our celebrity goes through thing to be,

1540
01:24:31.751 --> 01:24:35.380
I'd be like,
no,
that can't make it into the fucking movie.
So I understand.

1541
01:24:35.381 --> 01:24:38.140
I understood because I was,
I've thought about a lot.
I'd be like,

1542
01:24:38.141 --> 01:24:42.040
how would you feel someone who's making a doc that was beyond just me being the

1543
01:24:42.041 --> 01:24:46.960
incredible,
incredible,
you know,
highly achieved actor,
you know,

1544
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:49.620
it became this personal thing if they just didn't want to go into that.

1545
01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:53.440
Me As a highly,
highly,
highly achieved actor.
Now I'm just playing.
But I,
you know,

1546
01:24:53.441 --> 01:24:54.670
when it gets personal and you like,

1547
01:24:54.671 --> 01:24:58.210
you started to see like the intimacy and you see yourself in moments that you

1548
01:24:58.211 --> 01:25:00.790
forgot about because they're being filmed throwing screen.

1549
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:03.160
It's a vulnerable position.
So that's all it was.

1550
01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:04.810
And I made the movie out of love and,

1551
01:25:04.811 --> 01:25:09.670
and I think at the end of the day they know that and,
and the movie's gone on to,

1552
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:11.860
you know,
it's really like,
what else do you get?

1553
01:25:11.861 --> 01:25:14.740
Do you got anything you want to hype before we,
uh,
Nah man.
I mean,

1554
01:25:14.741 --> 01:25:16.870
the only thing I want to hype is,
is the New York Knicks.

1555
01:25:16.871 --> 01:25:18.220
I want to hype the giants,
you know,

1556
01:25:18.221 --> 01:25:20.680
starting to do their little midseason fumble and you know,

1557
01:25:20.681 --> 01:25:22.210
we got a movie coming out in,
in,

1558
01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:26.470
in I think it's April 5th to heal it comes Sandra,
Sandra Bullock and bill burrs.

1559
01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:31.640
Incredible.
And he's funny.
He's good.
He's got red hair and a red beard now.
Yo,

1560
01:25:31.641 --> 01:25:32.474
he,
there's,

1561
01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.930
there's going to be bill burrs going to be doing this thing in this movie.

1562
01:25:34.931 --> 01:25:37.730
It's going to be,
it's a funny movie and uh,
all right.
Do,

1563
01:25:37.930 --> 01:25:41.170
I'm really psyched that you came on this.
I'm glad to do it.
Definitely.

1564
01:25:41.171 --> 01:25:41.651
We were going to,

1565
01:25:41.651 --> 01:25:44.620
we might have to have you on again to talk shit when the Patriots finally beat

1566
01:25:44.621 --> 01:25:47.980
your ass in the fucking super bowl.
We should do us and we got to go.
We'll do it.

1567
01:25:47.981 --> 01:25:50.950
He will do a thing for the heater.
There'll be after football season,

1568
01:25:50.951 --> 01:25:54.940
it'll be going into the playoffs of,
of,
of,
for basketball and baseball.

1569
01:25:54.941 --> 01:25:58.810
Just be starting.
We'll do it.
I'm always a pessimist.
I hate our defense.

1570
01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:00.910
I hate our secondary for the Patriots.

1571
01:26:00.911 --> 01:26:03.950
I think the best thing we have going for our secondary as their running game

1572
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.680
<v 0>because it keeps them off the God damn field.
You know your shit.</v>

1573
01:26:06.710 --> 01:26:09.050
I'm going to tell you this right now,
like I think,
I think,

1574
01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:12.410
I think we're going to lose to the Broncos in the playoffs.
I really do.

1575
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:17.110
Because would that be the first round that would wildcard,
right?
No,
no,
no.

1576
01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.800
We were,
uh,
no,
Brock wasn't gonna win the division like,

1577
01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:23.600
and we're going to win out.
So maybe like second round,
I just feel like,
I think,

1578
01:26:23.601 --> 01:26:26.570
you know,
because Bella check knows how to get into Payton's head.
But like,

1579
01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:30.080
I just,
I just don't believe in our defense.

1580
01:26:30.081 --> 01:26:31.460
And also was that when we played the Broncos,

1581
01:26:31.461 --> 01:26:33.920
earliest year of Peyton had only been with them for 60 days.
Yeah.

1582
01:26:33.921 --> 01:26:36.080
That doesn't count.
Now he's going to be emails.
Yeah.

1583
01:26:36.081 --> 01:26:39.110
Now he's jelling with them and he's gonna have another hundred and 20 days.

1584
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:42.920
It'd be like [inaudible] to 300 fucking days in 240 days in or something.

1585
01:26:42.921 --> 01:26:45.160
He's something else.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
no,
absolutely.

1586
01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:48.680
And I'm so glad that he came back because who would want in him to end?

1587
01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:49.491
I didn't want,
you know what?

1588
01:26:49.491 --> 01:26:51.380
I ended up realizing that I never really hated paint man,

1589
01:26:51.381 --> 01:26:55.520
and what I really fucking hated was the disrespect that they weren't given Brady

1590
01:26:55.521 --> 01:26:58.790
his fucking do.
It's a long fucking argument and at the end of it,

1591
01:26:59.030 --> 01:27:01.720
you know there's no way as a football fan you can't love that guy,
but I,

1592
01:27:01.721 --> 01:27:05.450
I think that that defense is good enough with Brady Bella check.

1593
01:27:05.451 --> 01:27:09.590
He can never count that.
That's going to be a brutal game.
What about Greg Koski?

1594
01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:13.610
Is he going to come back?
I love Greg Koski by the way.
Yeah,
I don't know.

1595
01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:17.090
It's what he break his fall.
I guarantee you he'll be,
he'll be there.
He's,

1596
01:27:17.091 --> 01:27:21.140
I love him.
I love God.
Koski he's,
he's,
he's good.

1597
01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:24.920
He reminds me of [inaudible] Welker if he caught that fucking ball,

1598
01:27:24.921 --> 01:27:29.480
you're not talking about that little loop that barely read.
Come on man.

1599
01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:31.320
You lost the game show.

1600
01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:35.120
We fucking cut your throats and blood spilled twice.

1601
01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:39.350
First Time it happened,
you came back,
you got surgery,
rehabilitation,

1602
01:27:39.351 --> 01:27:42.410
and then we slid them again.
He left us on lights and fog.

1603
01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:45.620
You can't got to play it up again.
We got to play you guys again.
All right,

1604
01:27:45.621 --> 01:27:48.200
Michael.
Thank you so much,
God dwelling.
Aw,
man.
You're fucking awesome.

1605
01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:51.530
I appreciate it.
