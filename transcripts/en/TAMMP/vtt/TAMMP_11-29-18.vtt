00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.390
Okay.

It's time for the Thursday afternoon.</v>

Just fucking cough,

I don't know what's going on,

6
00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:23.120
There's something going.
Wow.
I heard about it,
dude.

7
00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:26.210
You'd hear that about that guy in swamp Scott already fucking dude.

8
00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:30.920
The fucking guy die.
He had to fucking sniffles.
You went up,
dude.

9
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:35.150
He went upstairs to bed and it came up in that no fucking guy was dead.

10
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.780
There's always those stories around Europe,
uh,
around Europe,

11
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.700
about a brown winter this time of year,
right?

12
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.130
Europe.
I'm thinking about my year old dates.
I might as well tell you,

13
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.881
listen to this shit.

14
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:50.780
The following cities in Europe from my European tour and have sold out Munich

15
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.460
often buck ragga or Riga,
Vienna,
Liverpool,
London,

16
00:00:55.461 --> 00:00:57.050
Copenhagen and Helsinki.

17
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.530
A second show will be added at the Royal Albert Hall in London.

18
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.720
More shows in other cities of second shows.
If we feel that we can sell them,

19
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.830
uh,
they will be,
they will be added.
All right.
They go.

20
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.880
Okay.
And the Patrice O'neil comedy benefit.

21
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.460
February 19th,
2019 Jim Gaffigan,
uh,

22
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.650
fucking rich Vos,
myself and a bunch of other people.

23
00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:22.610
I don't have the shit in front of me.

24
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.310
A big Jay Oakerson and little bill birth.
We're all going to be down there.

25
00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:32.000
It's going to be tremendous.
Um,
alright.
Plowing ahead here.

26
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.610
Um,
yeah,
I don't know everybody,

27
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:38.960
my fucking house is sick right now and I got to go to a New York because I'm

28
00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:42.140
doing a benefit on December 1st in the city.

29
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.590
I tweeted about it and I forget what the fuck it's going to be at,
but um,

30
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.520
she'll be a good time,

31
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.520
music and a comedy extravaganza to help people with,

32
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.610
I dunno what I did,
but I never fucking know.
They just ask and I say,
all right,

33
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.260
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

34
00:01:57.261 --> 00:01:59.810
Then you make the bad mistake as a comedian is you don't find out what the

35
00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:02.720
benefits for before you go on stage and then you end up doing a fucking joke

36
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:07.610
about it.
What is this?
Is this a benefit but cancer?
Yes,

37
00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:12.530
it is.
Oh,
sorry.
Sorry.
I should have looked in.

38
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.690
I should have looked in before I fucking,
you know,
for,
I started doing my shit.

39
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.230
I apologize.
I apologize.
Um,

40
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.590
so,
you know,
it's funny,
my,
uh,

41
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.380
one of my relatives ask me what's on your Christmas list.

42
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:29.500
I should have talked to him about this speaker thing I should ask Joe.

43
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.460
Rosa was just here,
we were taping an uninformed,

44
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:34.550
I should have asked him what exactly it is that I need,

45
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.550
like where the problem is.
Cause right now I just hold it,
you know,

46
00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:40.760
like a fucking suicide bomber if we got take like your thumb off the thing and

47
00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:44.480
then you blow up.
That's the way I got to hold it to be able to hear shit and uh,

48
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.340
I think it's going to affect my performance.
Um,
so anyways,

49
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.260
I was sleeping
so soundly.

50
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.790
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

51
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.420
<v 1>All right.
I went to bed early,
I ate great.</v>

52
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.520
I had no booze,
none of that bullshit.

53
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.580
I fucking just went to sleep and I was sleeping so soundly and I am awoken to

54
00:03:07.941 --> 00:03:12.080
this noise that sounds like literally like God's alarm clock.

55
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.880
It was just going,

56
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.880
<v 0>Eh,</v>

57
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.870
and

58
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.790
<v 1>right.
So I'm like,
the fuck is that right?</v>

59
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.550
<v 0>Yay.</v>

60
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.340
<v 1>And I opened the window,
you know,
I go over,
I'm going to open up the window.</v>

61
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.060
<v 0>Okay.
Yay.</v>

62
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.570
<v 1>I'm like,
it's fucking outside.</v>

63
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.640
So I go outside.
Yay.
Fucking,

64
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.990
I don't know what at the power box,
the pallet box,

65
00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:58.690
whatever the side of my house where it says,
you know,

66
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.240
high voltage and all of that shit.
I just walk up to it and it's just like,
Yay.

67
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.960
I don't know what the fuck happened.
And then right as I walked up to it,

68
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:13.600
it just stopped nay.

69
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.320
And I went inside and you know,
nothing has happened since.

70
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.550
So I'm going to go out on a limb and I want to say that somebody should take a

71
00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:28.220
look at that thing.
It was raining on.
I don't what happened.

72
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.460
I heard sirens down the street.
Somebody probably slammed into a fucking pole.

73
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.553
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

74
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.020
<v 1>Or something.
I don't,
I don't know.
I don't cause last name,</v>

75
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.330
but we know before I went to bed,
you know,

76
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.040
I was driving home from the comedy store and uh,

77
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:46.710
I saw like fucking three fire trucks down the street.
And,
uh,

78
00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:49.620
I made a left before it got to him and shit.
And I dunno,
you know,

79
00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:52.650
it rains a little bit out here and people just fucking slamming the trees

80
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.050
because it never rains out here.

81
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.070
So all the oil and antifreeze and fucking just shit,

82
00:04:59.071 --> 00:05:02.940
it's just on the road and all it takes is a little bit of water and it gets

83
00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:06.720
slick as hell and a plus.
People aren't used to driving and then I guess,

84
00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:09.690
and they just fucking crash the cars.
So anyways,

85
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.190
<v 0>okay.</v>

86
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.440
<v 1>Evidently I stared down this electricity and it got self conscious and it</v>

87
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.140
stopped making the fucking noise and then I get my house and then,
you know,

88
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.790
it's the first rain of the year,

89
00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:25.320
so I got to go up on my roof and make sure there's no fucking problems,
you know.

90
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.750
And one of the gutters was clogged up just because,
you know,

91
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:31.990
we've got trees out here and shit falls in there and when it rains it pours out.

92
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:36.820
It just like the song.
So I'm fucking cleaning out the Goddamn gutters and uh,

93
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.740
I almost fucking fell off the roof.
There's a,

94
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.230
it's split second.
You know,

95
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.890
cause I didn't want to get wet so I was crouched down.
I wasn't leaning back,

96
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.730
I was just sorta crouched down and I was reaching forward and it was just like,

97
00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:54.600
what the fuck am I doing?
I had to do that quick math like bill,

98
00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:55.590
what would you rather do?

99
00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.440
Would you rather get your clothes wet and have to throw them in the hamper or

100
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:05.420
would you like to die or be paralyzed?
So I laid down on the roof,

101
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.990
you know,
and it fucking cleaned all this shit out.
Cause that's what I do.

102
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.730
That's the thankless fucking work you do as a dad and nobody appreciates it.

103
00:06:14.731 --> 00:06:17.640
You know,
you make sure the water gets away from the foundation,
you know,

104
00:06:17.641 --> 00:06:20.880
you do those types of things for,
you know,

105
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.210
I don't know the roof over the your fucking head.
No,

106
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.060
maybe I'm just spoiled.
You know,
cause I tell a joke and everybody laughs,

107
00:06:28.061 --> 00:06:31.810
you know,
you guys give me an Atta boy every fucking 10 to 12 seconds,

108
00:06:31.811 --> 00:06:35.710
so whatever,
eight to 10 of them killing.
Um,

109
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.720
maybe that's what the fuck it is.
But now,

110
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.540
now I have to get some goddamn electrician to come over and figuring out what

111
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:45.290
the fuck that thing is about.
My front door lock is fucked up.
It's just like,

112
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:48.730
it's just never ending.
You know?

113
00:06:48.731 --> 00:06:51.430
I don't know who the fuck the American dream was.
You wanted to own a house,

114
00:06:51.431 --> 00:06:55.600
but I swear to God,
it's just,
it's never fucking ending plus,

115
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.880
but there's another way to do it.
There's other people,

116
00:06:57.881 --> 00:07:01.180
they just live in a house and when something breaks,
they just deal with it.

117
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.390
You know,
those kinds of people,
they buy a car and they don't get it fixed ever.

118
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.460
They don't get the fucking,
you know,

119
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.990
remember back in the day they'd have those sports cars with the lights flip down

120
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:14.840
and flipped up and one would just be up and they would just drive around and be

121
00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:19.490
okay with it.
You know?
I always set that,
that was like a,
like a,

122
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.110
a ridiculous like sign of a loser.

123
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.200
Like this guy's a fucking loser.
I know he's got a core of it,
but like he's,
he's,

124
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.930
he's living beyond his fucking means.

125
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.180
You know how unless it just happened.

126
00:07:36.181 --> 00:07:38.110
How long are you going to ride around with that fucking thing?

127
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.270
Looking up like that,

128
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.510
the beautiful lines of that car and you're fucking it up with that and just,

129
00:07:42.511 --> 00:07:44.340
I would watch people that drive me nuts.

130
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.590
Your parents are always like that.
If something broke in the car,

131
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:53.120
they just fucking,
they ain't never got it fixed.
I don't get that
pill.

132
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:56.920
You really mad about this?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

133
00:07:56.921 --> 00:07:58.670
It's just I was sleeping soundly and then yeah,

134
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.550
like my daughter was still asleep at fucking woke her up and it's just like,

135
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.750
it can,
it can.
I just have one fucking day where I,
I get,

136
00:08:12.751 --> 00:08:16.230
I mean I feel like I get eight hours,
so,
oh,
was I sleeping well?

137
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.200
I was sleeping so good.
Oh God.
It was so fucking great.
And then I just woke up.

138
00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:27.180
I was like,
what the fuck is said?
What the fuck is why?
What is that?

139
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.480
Is that what the alarm in the house sounds like?

140
00:08:30.481 --> 00:08:32.100
Is there a serial killer in the house?

141
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:34.950
Can you give me another five minutes to sleeping?
Let,

142
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.970
shouldn't we just fucking laying there in bed.
You just don't give a shit.

143
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.773
Um,

144
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:49.220
I vaguely remember my Nia coming into waking me up last night as your wife does,

145
00:08:49.981 --> 00:08:53.100
you know,
you sleeping soundly.
Why when they wake up she goes,
was that the car?

146
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.610
Was that the house alarm?
Did you hear that?
And I went,
no.

147
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.160
And I did hear it.

148
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.930
It's just like I'm not fucking going downstairs for the 9000000th time with that

149
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:08.790
softball bat going down the fucking stairs just to find out that the the fucking

150
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:11.610
window in our old ass house,
you know,

151
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:15.990
blew open a little bit.
Um,

152
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.350
then I woke up feeling guilty like I should have done it,
but I was just sleep.

153
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.190
I was sleeping so fucking,
well.
Anyways,

154
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.490
let's plow ahead here.
So freckles,
um,
I mentioned,

155
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:27.960
<v 0>yeah,</v>

156
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.740
<v 1>I my uh,</v>

157
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.210
on the Monday morning podcast I was going to be on the Joe Rogan experience.
Uh,

158
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.990
there ended up being a little confusion on the booking.

159
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:38.520
So instead it's going to be December 20th.
And,
uh,

160
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:42.330
which you'll be cool because I'm going to hang with Joe a couple times before

161
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:44.310
that.
It give us some tea,
some shit to talk about.

162
00:09:44.311 --> 00:09:46.560
Cause I hadn't seen him in a while just cause I've been doing the road and he's

163
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:48.770
been doing his stuff.
So,
uh,

164
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.770
that got rescheduled and um,

165
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.040
I also said I was doing dice Clay's podcast.
I wasn't,

166
00:09:56.041 --> 00:09:58.350
it was somebody else's pocket.
I fucked the whole thing up.

167
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.480
But I did call in spit and chiclets on Barstool so I did,
I did do that.
Right.

168
00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:06.960
And I also said thatF is for family was coming out today and it is,

169
00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:11.730
and it's coming out tomorrow,
the 30th.
So I basically,
I fucked everything up.

170
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.990
Um,
I apologize.
So,
um,
anyways,

171
00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:18.580
<v 0>okay.</v>

172
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.440
<v 1>Hang on a second.
What the fuck is that now?</v>

173
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:21.993
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

174
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.280
<v 1>Anyways,
next week I am going to be on a,</v>

175
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.920
I'm going to be on Seth Meyers show on Tuesday of next week promotingF is for

176
00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:33.650
family.
And then I will also be,
uh,

177
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:39.310
at the Gotham comedy club doing a show with Paul Versey and Sam j.

178
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.300
It's going to be awesome.
Christmas in New York and we suck.

179
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:46.190
They all suck cause I'm with my family and shit.
But a big bang,

180
00:10:46.191 --> 00:10:50.350
boom real quick.
Oh,
and then right back and uh,
uh,

181
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.570
back on the Diet.
I'm not boozing,
it had been dry for five days,

182
00:10:53.571 --> 00:10:54.590
bored out of my mind,

183
00:10:54.591 --> 00:10:58.730
but obviously sleeping well until my fucking side of my house starts buzzing.

184
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.260
But I've decided that I've lied to get in great shape again.

185
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.220
Like I did the end of August and then Labor Day came and I made a couple of

186
00:11:07.221 --> 00:11:09.290
Burgers,
had a couple of beers and I just,

187
00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:11.690
then I had six weeks on the road and I just,
I fucking put it,

188
00:11:11.691 --> 00:11:12.950
almost all of it back on.

189
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.180
But now I've turned the ship around and all freckles is headed back.

190
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.430
Last time I was able to get four ABS,
four out of Eight,
I got halfway there.

191
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.420
You know,
you don't really feel like you ever watched the,
uh,

192
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.460
American Ninja Warrior and there's that fucking guy every year.

193
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:29.521
<v 2>Hey,</v>

194
00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:33.960
last year he couldn't get past the fucking trap piece and then he gets past the

195
00:11:33.961 --> 00:11:35.370
trap.
He's,
he's all excited.

196
00:11:35.371 --> 00:11:37.310
Then he does a face plant on the next [inaudible] fucking

197
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.080
<v 1>whatever you call it,
object,
obstacle,
whatever.
The fuck you call it that.</v>

198
00:11:42.081 --> 00:11:45.840
That's basically what I'm doing is far as trying to get in shape,
but a,

199
00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:48.920
at least this time,
cause I went to nutritionalists a nutritionist,

200
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:53.010
I know how to a,
I know how to eat.
So I've just been doing that and it got to me,

201
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.520
once you lay off the booze,
it's fucking,
it's all good.
It's all good.

202
00:11:57.521 --> 00:11:59.710
So I go home and my new show on me TV,

203
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:03.950
I watched the untouchables and as an episode of,
uh,

204
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.480
I watched the other day,

205
00:12:05.481 --> 00:12:10.090
he had a young Carroll O'connor who played Archie bunker,
Ron.
And it's just the,

206
00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:14.590
uh,
it really is the shit.
And um,
you know,

207
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:18.940
I got my Christmas tree already fucking amazing already got my Christmas tree.

208
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:22.120
I was sitting there going,
you know what?
I want to get a good one this year.

209
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.450
I'm going to knock that out before I go to New York.
I'll just make sure,

210
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.740
you know,
my wife waters the fucking thing.
And uh,

211
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:33.190
so I go down there and it's just classic La,

212
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.110
why I love La and why it can be annoying.

213
00:12:35.111 --> 00:12:39.520
Sometimes I show up to buy a Christmas tree and there's some like,

214
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.580
you know,
fucking hot chick,
right?

215
00:12:42.581 --> 00:12:47.581
This Asian chick just dressed ridiculously nice bike.

216
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.450
She was going to go walk a red carpet,
you know,
high heels,

217
00:12:52.451 --> 00:12:56.950
makeup,
the whole fucking thing.
Getting out of this shiny SUV.
I'm like,

218
00:12:56.951 --> 00:12:58.690
what the fuck are you buying a Christmas tree like that?

219
00:12:58.691 --> 00:13:02.140
Then of course I look over the left and there's a guy with the fucking camera

220
00:13:02.141 --> 00:13:06.970
filming or there's some fucking reality show.
I mean like full makeup,

221
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:07.601
the whole,

222
00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:10.840
you think reality shows look fucking stupid when you watch them at home.

223
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:14.310
If you see one that's really being shot,
it's just like,
what the fuck?

224
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.250
Who the fuck looks like that going to get a God damn Christmas tree?

225
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:20.143
<v 3>MMM.</v>

226
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:22.240
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

227
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.280
And I'm standing there and I'm trying to find what I'm facetiming with my wife.

228
00:13:25.281 --> 00:13:28.550
What about this white [inaudible] care full enough,
you know,

229
00:13:28.551 --> 00:13:31.940
go through all that bullshit.
Then all of a sudden this other guy shows up.

230
00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.210
He's dressed like little Bo peep,
swear to God,

231
00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.880
but with like a beard and everything.
This guy,
mini skirt,

232
00:13:37.881 --> 00:13:40.400
tattoos on his legs and holding a selfie stick,

233
00:13:40.401 --> 00:13:44.720
filming himself with full fucking makeup on.
And I was just like,
all right,

234
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:49.250
you know,
this is uh,
this is fucking la man.

235
00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.090
Will this cough ever go away?

236
00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:01.420
I think I might take some medicine.
My wife had me go on and get some Robitussin.

237
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:04.250
I've always been a Nyquil guy,
you know?

238
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.750
Well I gotta tell you I cannot taste the fucking difference between the two of

239
00:14:08.751 --> 00:14:10.070
them.
They get that red shit.

240
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.850
It's almost like you'd rather die in pneumonia than fucking drink that stuff.

241
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.720
And now when you go there to buy it,
they actually asked for your fucking id,

242
00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:23.000
which is really annoying.
It's like,
look at me lady.
Do you think I'm fucking,

243
00:14:23.001 --> 00:14:27.520
do you really think I'm 20 look at me and I hand the gang.

244
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.190
He think gag a death.
You know,
you mentioned like,

245
00:14:32.191 --> 00:14:37.010
that's like how rock bottom.
You know how much fucking going to look that up.

246
00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.100
I don't know how to spell Robitussin,
but I am a drink.
Look up Nyquil.

247
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.820
This shit that I end up looking up on my fucking laptop because of this God damn

248
00:14:43.821 --> 00:14:46.970
podcast.
I can't imagine what.
So watch lunch list.
I'm on here.

249
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:52.670
How much is that Nyquil?
The window.

250
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:54.680
NYQUIL.

251
00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:56.060
<v 0>Okay.</v>

252
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.970
<v 1>To get drunk</v>

253
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:02.081
right now.

254
00:15:02.081 --> 00:15:05.800
They're all thinking this is a functioning alcoholic because he's drinking

255
00:15:05.801 --> 00:15:07.960
Nyquil to get shit faced yet.
He's still somehow is.

256
00:15:07.961 --> 00:15:11.170
It has access to a laptop and the Internet.
All right.

257
00:15:11.171 --> 00:15:13.570
Drinking copious amounts of Nyquil.
Pros,

258
00:15:13.571 --> 00:15:16.790
a bottle comes with its own personal shotglass.
All right,

259
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:17.920
already love this right here.

260
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:19.450
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

261
00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:24.350
<v 1>I already loved this.
Sorry.
What do we got here?
Alright.</v>

262
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.030
Flood Cat tampons.
What the fuck?
What,
what part of the Internet of my aunt

263
00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:36.140
vapor teeny vodka.

264
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.000
Eyeballing and snorting.

265
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:44.310
Do these people are fucking crazy people.
Don't do any of this,
but let's,

266
00:15:44.311 --> 00:15:49.311
let's listen to it for the comedy taking shots of mouthwash wine.

267
00:15:49.981 --> 00:15:54.870
Ice Cream.
All right,
I can do that.
Oh,
at copious amounts of Nyquil.

268
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:59.910
All right.
Pro.
Okay.
Nyquil,
this nighttime sniffling,
sneezing,
coughing.

269
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.560
How the fuck did I end up on the kitchen floor?
Medicine.
Okay.
Uh,

270
00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:06.330
but this is on a spoon.
university.com by the way,

271
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.990
a bottle comes with its own personal shot glass.
This is the pros.

272
00:16:09.991 --> 00:16:14.190
Take a few shots,
fight the sleepy feeling,
and then you're in for a hazy,

273
00:16:14.191 --> 00:16:16.710
loopy drunk slash high combination.

274
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:21.240
It's kind of weird that you got to like fucking fight off going asleep.

275
00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:25.890
All right.
Cons,
you have to be 18 to buy it and most drug stores,

276
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.640
which is a big deterrent for the under age population of binge drinkers.

277
00:16:29.641 --> 00:16:31.380
Not a reliable way to get drunk.

278
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.830
You might just send up passed out or worse sober.
Yeah.

279
00:16:34.831 --> 00:16:37.260
People don't do any of this,
especially if you're fucking underage,

280
00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.300
but I for the comedy,
I have to read this here.

281
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:40.720
<v 0>Okay.</v>

282
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.530
<v 1>All right.
Tired of the wretched taste of booze.</v>

283
00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:48.180
This is this how they set this up like no booze tastes worse.

284
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.190
Busch light doesn't taste worse than Nyquil.

285
00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:55.490
Simply drinking alcohol to get drunk these days is just so mainstream in the

286
00:16:55.531 --> 00:16:57.630
mood to potentially,
they'll probably just making fun of,

287
00:16:59.130 --> 00:16:59.420
<v 0>okay,</v>

288
00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.320
<v 1>they're making,
okay,
I get it.</v>

289
00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:02.750
They're being sarcastic here so it's not Reggie taste of booze.

290
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.540
Then making fun of how rich and all this other shit is.
Okay?

291
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:11.230
I'm in the mood to potentially take a trip to the er or meet hot doctors.

292
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:16.610
Check out these alternative methods of imbuing for hardcore alcoholics only.

293
00:17:16.611 --> 00:17:20.090
Not for the faint of heart.
Disclaimer,
in case she didn't get it.

294
00:17:20.091 --> 00:17:23.510
Do not try any of these messages.
Methods.
Seriously,
don't.
Yeah,
don't.

295
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.960
This is what lunatics do.
Vodka tampons.

296
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:29.541
All right?

297
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:34.310
A good friend shows you how to soak your Tampon in vodka for a quicker buzz.

298
00:17:34.311 --> 00:17:37.100
These are like little advertisements like this is smart things to do,

299
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.031
which it isn't.

300
00:17:38.031 --> 00:17:41.390
I have to keep putting that disclaimer out there before when you dopes does this

301
00:17:41.391 --> 00:17:42.530
do not do this pros,

302
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.490
these suckers were designed for more than just that time of the month and

303
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:51.480
nosebleeds.
Soak one up with your choice of liquor.
Um,

304
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.400
who am I kidding?
If you're trying this method,

305
00:17:53.401 --> 00:17:55.650
you're most definitely a vodka gal.

306
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.710
They're supposed to hold a show about a shot's worth.

307
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:04.020
Shove it up there to bypass your digestive track and get drunk way faster.

308
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:06.190
It doesn't,
it sting.

309
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.620
<v 0>Okay.</v>

310
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:12.110
<v 1>Cons,
a yard.
Golf.</v>

311
00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.180
You only got one.
You only get one vagina.

312
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.570
Flooding the sensitive area with 40 proof liquor is bound to leave a wake of

313
00:18:17.571 --> 00:18:21.530
destruction.
Your baby coming out drunk would be the least of your problems.

314
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.090
Ladies,
stick to fake tampon flasks.
They sell it.
I don't know what the fuck.
Okay.

315
00:18:26.091 --> 00:18:27.050
That was too many jokes here.

316
00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:28.400
<v 0>Okay.</v>

317
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.060
<v 1>What's a vapor?
Teeny.
No calories,
no carbs,
no hangover.</v>

318
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.510
Smooth taste and feel the effects of liquor much quicker.

319
00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:38.700
Since the alcohol bypasses your stomach,

320
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:44.240
he could also bypass your liver so that those with liver damage from too much

321
00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:48.490
drinking can once again partake.
This doesn't make sense.
Also,

322
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:53.510
you look like a boss smoking alcohol out of an orb with a metal straw.

323
00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.870
Oh,
that's like that.
Chemistry Shit.
Vodka.
Eyeball snorting,

324
00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:03.970
eyeballing and snorting.
All right.

325
00:19:03.971 --> 00:19:07.360
This is just dumb shit.
All right,
I'm done with it.
Okay.
I'm done.

326
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:09.010
<v 0>Okay.</v>

327
00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.620
<v 1>I'm done.
I can't believe anybody would ever fucking do that.</v>

328
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.700
Pour alcohol into your fucking eye.
That can't be right.

329
00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.800
Can I just do the reeds here?
People just,

330

And then out of nowhere they came back with a full head of hair.

429
00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:30.090
How fucking weird is that?

430
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:31.720

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.180

438
00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.250
<v 1>I'm going to get some astro turf glued to the top of my head.</v>

446
00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:16.060
Can a bald person receive a hair transplant?
This is Bosley.

447
00:26:16.061 --> 00:26:19.510
Obviously they're going to say yes.
They want your fucking money.
Oh,

<v 1>That guy was not completely bald.
Okay.</v>

451
00:26:25.841 --> 00:26:30.730
This guy was really bald and now he's got the Conor Mcgregor.

452
00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:38.260
These guys,
they just always look,

453
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.720
It always looks just a little weird.

454
00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:42.850
<v 0>Okay,</v>

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.300
<v 1>Oh,

Nope.

460
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:02.560
They still don't have it down.

461
00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.680
They still just don't have it.
Wow.
There are a lot of famous people.
Oh my God.

462
00:27:08.681 --> 00:27:12.400
What the fuck happened to that guy?
Hair transplant gone wrong.

465
00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.010
You know people.
Why do,

466
00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:24.620
why do people feel the need to lie so much on the Internet?

467
00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.910
Have you ever wondered that?
That's something hair transplants gone wrong.

479
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.760
I'm not fucking doing that.

480
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.970
Oh my God.
Look at these fucking Jack Atlanta looking sons of bitches.

482
00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.090
I got it though.
I guess really listening to me googling the shit.

483
00:28:34.091 --> 00:28:36.850
What the fuck am I doing?
Can we get back to the goddamn shell?
Um,

484
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.540
anyways.
Um,
you don't need as people.

485
00:28:43.541 --> 00:28:47.380
I did fucking back to back episodes of uninformed with Joe de Rosa and I am

486
00:28:47.381 --> 00:28:51.790
fucking,
I'm for the one of the few times in my life,
I'm a little talked out.

487
00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.660
I am,
I'm just a little fucking talked out and I'm fucking stab and,

488
00:28:55.661 --> 00:28:56.920
and I want to go get something to eat,

489
00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:00.970
but my wife is fucking pissed at me right now cause I flipped out about

490
00:29:00.971 --> 00:29:04.090
something really important,
you know,
like,
uh,

491
00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.000
I don't know what the fuck I feel.
I didn't know what the fuck.

492
00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.590
I just want to see us,
what I was right.

493
00:29:08.591 --> 00:29:11.860
And then I flipped out and then I became wrong as always,
you know,

494
00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.670
then I tried to walk away and then she wants to fucking,

495
00:29:15.671 --> 00:29:19.630
let's just sit down and discuss it like fucking a regular person.
I'm just like,

496
00:29:19.631 --> 00:29:23.890
I'm not a regular person and I'm already heated.
So you gotta let me walk away.

497
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:28.540
You know,
she won't let me walk away.
You know,
it's got to get out of the way.

498
00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:34.650
What highlight,
Huh?
Tommy Lasorda,

499
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:35.520
New York Yankees.

500
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.020
Reggie Jackson leaning into that ball accidentally according to him.
Um,

501
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:46.390
anyways,
I,
uh,
she says I'm always in the fucking dog house.

502
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.290
Anyways,
I want to thank everybody for listening today.
Uh,

503
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:52.840
thank you to everybody who's been buying the Patrice O'Neal tickets.
Uh,

504
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:56.890
they're going even faster than usual every year.
They go by fast for the benefit.

505
00:29:56.891 --> 00:30:01.140
Thank you for that.
And thank you to everyone that's joining my patrion page.
Uh,

506
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:05.110
we have all the backstage footage of,
um,

507
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:09.730
my arena shows at the forum,
the Boston Garden and Madison Square Garden.

508
00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.620
W me walking off Madison Square Garden is,
uh,

509
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:18.130
arguably the coolest moment of my life.
Not the most important.

510
00:30:18.131 --> 00:30:20.260
I had a kid get married and shit,

511
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:24.280
but like the coolest moment of my fucking life because the show could not have

512
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:27.640
gone better.
And I talked to the audio guide today and we got the audio.

513
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.540
There's no problem.
And,
uh,

514
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:33.010
I'm hoping to be releasing that in vinyl after my next special cause there'll be

515
00:30:33.011 --> 00:30:37.390
too much overlap in the material.
But,
um,
uh,
I'm,

516
00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:40.240
I'm very anxious to hear the audio cause it's like,
dude,

517
00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:43.540
I want people when they listened to it to feel like they're at the fucking show

518
00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:48.850
and I'm not going to lie to you.
It was a good one.
So,
um,
that is it.

519
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.590
<v 4>Um,
enjoy the music here and uh,</v>

520
00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:55.950
we'll have another half hour bonus material from my Thursday afternoon just

521
00:30:55.951 --> 00:30:59.010
before Friday,
Monday morning podcast with Thursday.
God,

522
00:30:59.011 --> 00:31:02.250
by years and years ago or I don't know,
a couple of weeks ago.

523
00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.200
I don't know how it works.
All right,
I'll see you guys.

524
00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:16.380
<v 5>Many guys had come to you with a line and you pay down</v>

525
00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:26.590
and bare lines.

526
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.110
Let me try.

527
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:34.720
No,
I don't.

528
00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:00.630
<v 4>So anyways,
uh,
well yeah,
we got to go it</v>

529
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.820
<v 1>Christmas tree.
So for the last two years</v>

530
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:05.510
<v 6>I have to admit something to you people.
All right.</v>

531
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:10.220
I have been going down to get these fucking Christmas trees and I have been

532
00:32:10.221 --> 00:32:14.120
getting the traditional Christmas tree and we all know what it looks like.

533
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.620
All right.
It looks like someone on the biggest loser about four weeks in.

534
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:22.280
That's what a Christmas tree suppose about that full,
you know,

535
00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:29.180
but disease,
other Christmas trees that I noticed,
not the scrawny ones,

536
00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:35.140
but they are minimalists Christmas trees where you can see the entire trunk and

537
00:32:38.121 --> 00:32:42.410
it's like they still have the branches,

538
00:32:42.411 --> 00:32:46.400
but there it's very like symmetrical.
It looks fucking cool as hell.

539
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:50.270
Clean looking Christmas tree,
right.

540
00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:54.980
It looks like one of those trees and like the doctor Seuss books,
you know.

541
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:59.210
So I go,
you know what?
Fuck this.
I'm going to get something different.

542
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.080
I liked this tree.
It looks fucking cool.

543
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.560
I think the ornaments are going to hang off it much better as if you don't,

544
00:33:06.561 --> 00:33:10.610
when you get one of those full trees,
you know this.
Yeah.
It's just,

545
00:33:10.611 --> 00:33:13.760
it's a fucking pain in the ass.
And then the end of the end of the God damn,

546
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.220
you know,
Christmas season,

547
00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:19.640
if you're not a dick and you just don't throw it out the side of your car,

548
00:33:19.641 --> 00:33:22.280
like a fucking some,
you know,

549
00:33:22.281 --> 00:33:25.010
some piece of degenerate gambler that owed him money.

550
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:29.510
I said have it by Tuesday and then you just throw it out the fucking right.

551
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.870
If you actually do it the right way and you,
you saw it up,

552
00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:38.020
it's a pain in the ass.
It makes an unbelievable mess.
This thing,
you know,

553
00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:41.570
it's like,
it's like you ever walk into like,
uh,
like when I'm out with,
with a,

554
00:33:41.571 --> 00:33:46.520
with Nia and we go out to one of her,
uh,
her clothing stores and um,

555
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.800
if it's like a corporate place,
the place is just jam packed was shit.

556
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.740
But if it's like a privately owned,

557
00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.000
they go out and they buy these individual pieces still by a couple of sizes of

558
00:33:59.001 --> 00:34:00.650
each things that they like.
And you go in there,

559
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.830
you pray to God that they have your size and it's,

560
00:34:02.831 --> 00:34:05.150
and you go in and it's very minimalist.

561
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.750
That's the sort of Christmas tree that I bought.
And uh,
you know,

562
00:34:08.751 --> 00:34:11.150
knee is a fashion Easter so I thought she would like it.

563
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.650
So I bring this Christmas tree in and the second she looks at it,

564
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:19.130
cause I think she's going to be like,
you know,
like I live at,

565
00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:22.910
she just have like techno music on like I'm so far into the fucking future here.

566
00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:28.180
The second sheet looks at it all my confidence just drains out the bottom of my

567
00:34:28.281 --> 00:34:33.050
shoes and I go,
yeah,
this is the Christmas tree.
And she goes,
Oh yeah.

568
00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:37.660
He goes,
where's the rest of it?
And I'm like,
no,
no.

569
00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:41.860
That's the style.
That's the style it's supposed to look like that.
I go,

570
00:34:41.861 --> 00:34:44.690
it doesn't have the cool,
I mean it looks like one of those trees and Dr Seuss.

571
00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.930
She goes,
yeah.
She goes,
I think it looks more like that,

572
00:34:47.931 --> 00:34:50.060
that Christmas tree and that Charlie Brown carts,

573
00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.350
and I feel like an asshole.

574
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:59.840
So because I love the verbal abuse that you guys give me every fucking week.

575
00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:04.550
I'm actually going to be dumb enough to send a picture of my Christmas tree.

576
00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:09.650
Now granted it's naked.
It's not all dressed up.
It's not all dolled up.
All right.

577
00:35:09.651 --> 00:35:14.450
It's like Charlie's Thoren and that stupid movie monster that rather than

578
00:35:14.451 --> 00:35:16.790
chastising her for being a murderous cont,

579
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:20.420
they actually made a movie that said maybe guys Outta look at themselves and

580
00:35:20.421 --> 00:35:23.810
treat bitches a little bit better before they go and start killing you after a

581
00:35:23.811 --> 00:35:27.200
blow job.
It wasn't that the message in the move SMS,
which I got.

582
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.500
So anyways,
it doesn't have any makeup on,

583
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.980
which I think should automatically give it a golden globe for being that

584
00:35:33.981 --> 00:35:37.710
courageous.
It was so brave.
It was such a brave performance.

585
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:42.690
Um,
just take a look at the Christmas tree.
Tell me what you think.

586
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.500
I think it looks fucking bad ass.
I love it.

587
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:51.090
I fucking love it.
And uh,
I stand by it.
You know,

588
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:52.500
I'm breaking a little tradition.
Here

589
00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:55.590
<v 5>are no</v>

590
00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.980
ahead
will.

591
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:08.980
You
will see.

592
00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:36.490
<v 6>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill birds to Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

593
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:40.810
November 29th,
2010.
How the hell are you?

594
00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:44.440
Did you have a nice thanksgiving?
Did you,

595
00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:49.240
did you hang out with all your family and all your friends?

596
00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:52.600
Will you sitting at the table with someone that,
you know,

597
00:36:52.601 --> 00:36:56.380
this time next year you're not going to be together.
You know,

598
00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:59.680
and you're just trying to just sit there and plow through the fucking meal.

599
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:05.200
Go and God dammit.
Why didn't I break up with this bitch before I came home?

600
00:37:05.201 --> 00:37:07.900
My fucking parents?
Why are you asking your questions?

601
00:37:07.901 --> 00:37:12.160
She's not going to be here next year people,
this is all a rose.
Okay.

602
00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:17.350
She was fun to bag.
We were having a good time and a,
I don't know what happened.

603
00:37:17.351 --> 00:37:21.430
It got out of control and next thing you know she wanted to come to this thing

604
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:25.180
and I didn't have the balls to say no.
All right,

605
00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.050
I fucked up.
I can tell you what.

606
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.980
I'm not going to get sucked into buying her a fucking Christmas gift.
Okay,

607
00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:38.020
so you do the math.
You know when the fuck Christmases.

608
00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:40.330
We all know when it is.

609
00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:45.450
It's on the fucking 25th so 29th of November and she's out this bitches out

610
00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:52.540
before Christmas cause I'm not feeling it past the fucking porch.

611
00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:56.140
Thank you
Jesus Christ.
Nia,

612
00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:00.970
I'm trying to do the podcast.
Can you not distract me?
Good Lord.

613
00:38:00.971 --> 00:38:03.880
You know something you have to have a girlfriend or just does not appreciate

614
00:38:03.881 --> 00:38:07.240
your creative space.
It's like you're sitting in here,

615
00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:11.860
you're trying to give people something that they can enjoy for the week.

616
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.150
And what do you Donia you just come walking in here like this,

617
00:38:16.151 --> 00:38:21.090
this amazing thing that's happening isn't happening.
Okay.
Nothing.

618
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:23.880
I don't get anything from you.
You're just gonna.

619
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:28.400
You're just going to collect your little belongings and then walk out of my life

620
00:38:28.401 --> 00:38:33.130
for a couple hours.
Where are you going?
In and out.
Burger Nino.

621
00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:37.800
All right.
She's gone.
No words of wisdom from her this week.
She's,
she's annoyed.

622
00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:41.520
She's annoyed with me.
I've been traveling a lot lately.
Everybody,

623
00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:45.460
it's because,
uh,
the tax man woe,
the tax,

624
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.130
the tax man's coming my way.
All right.
And as usual,

625
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.430
he's got his fucking handout with a scowl on his face.
So,
uh,

626
00:38:53.431 --> 00:38:55.320
this is what always happens to me at the end of the year,

627
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:58.730
right before I take my month off,
you know,

628
00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.710
to stare at my balls.

629
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:05.910
<v 5>Okay?</v>

630
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:08.820
<v 6>Ah,
that's what I do.
During my Christmas break,
I could take a month off.</v>

631
00:39:08.821 --> 00:39:12.400
I just stare at my balls,
you know,
find my censure.

632
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:16.930
Um,
Jesus,
I'm gonna fucking goofy.
Goddamn move.
You know,

633
00:39:16.931 --> 00:39:21.270
somebody hit my fucking car.
Can you believe that shit?

634
00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:26.010
Why?
Yes,
Bill.
We can believe it.
Thousands of accidents happen every day.

635
00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:30.970
All right.
So basically I was sitting at a red light,
uh,
me and my,
uh,

636
00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:35.140
lovely compadre we were sitting there shooting the Shit,
you know,

637
00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:40.230
and all of a sudden we just got hit from behind.
And uh,

638
00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.250
I see this woman,
she's doing the gestures like,

639
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:47.580
<v 5>and I,
I,
I,
I that.
Yeah,</v>

640
00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:51.240
<v 6>I am like south side.
She's making those faces,
right?</v>

641
00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.280
At least that's how I'm reading it.
Okay.

642
00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.240
So then I got to pull over and then she starts pointing to different places

643
00:39:57.241 --> 00:40:00.090
where I should be pulling over,
which is really fucking annoying me.
It's like,

644
00:40:00.091 --> 00:40:04.980
listen,
bitch,
you hit my car.
How about I get to make a decision here?
You know,

645
00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:07.890
like,
maybe we'll pull over here.
So we pull into this fucking Jiffy Lube.

646
00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:11.760
She gets out,
turns out she's a fucking sweetheart.

647
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:16.590
She's a sweetheart,
right?
She's not a bad person.
She's like,
you know,

648
00:40:16.591 --> 00:40:19.650
my dog was jumping around and went to go pick her up and I fucking rammed into

649
00:40:19.651 --> 00:40:24.480
you.
So,
uh,
I look at my back bumper and it's got a nice little crease in it,

650
00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:27.600
you know what I mean?
Like right down the side of Keith Richards face.

651
00:40:27.601 --> 00:40:31.230
That's what I got like on a,
not on the,
the uh,

652
00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:34.590
the side that you would see if you were standing behind it,
if you will,

653
00:40:34.591 --> 00:40:36.780
creeping up right behind my car.

654
00:40:36.781 --> 00:40:39.840
Like you were going to fuck it for some reason and you look down at it.

655
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.640
That part of the bumper,
the top part of the bumper,

656
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:46.060
that's what I'm trying to say.
I looked as crease a little bit.
Whatever,

657
00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:51.180
you know the fuck.
I'm going to get a new bumper,
you know,

658
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:55.760
and then what some other person's going to hit me.
It's La,
it's a bumper.

659
00:40:55.761 --> 00:40:59.240
Cars out here.
It's impossible.
I've done that a couple times.

660
00:40:59.241 --> 00:41:02.060
I've gone out and I got my bumper replaced and literally a fucking week later

661
00:41:02.061 --> 00:41:05.960
some asshole bumps into me.
So I'm just like,
fuck it.
Uh,

662
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:09.560
but what have we exchanged information?
And I,
and I go to leave.
And today,

663
00:41:09.561 --> 00:41:11.660
Lo and behold,
I go for the first time,

664
00:41:11.661 --> 00:41:16.340
I guess in a week to open and close the hatchback and it's not closing,
right.

665
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:20.720
So evidently she hit it hard enough that it did a little more damaged.

666
00:41:20.721 --> 00:41:24.770
So I took it over to the place to get an estimate.
And of course the guy's like,

667
00:41:24.771 --> 00:41:27.980
yeah,
you go fuck him with place the age you go fucking place data.
You know,

668
00:41:27.981 --> 00:41:32.540
the gas tank,
you know,
it looks intact,
but it's probably a,
you know,

669
00:41:32.541 --> 00:41:35.780
suffered sort of trauma.
So emotional trauma.

670
00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:38.240
So he tells me it's going to be,
uh,

671
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:41.900
around two grand if not three grant

672
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.610
for this bullshit.
So I just had to call her back and just say,
listen,

673
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:51.110
I don't know if you got that kind of cash.
I ain't got that kind of fucking cash,

674
00:41:51.111 --> 00:41:54.050
so why don't you report it to your fucking insurance company?
Because,
uh,

675
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:57.530
basically pull,
thought it was going to be a new bumper,
which is like,
you know,

676
00:41:57.531 --> 00:41:57.801
five,

677
00:41:57.801 --> 00:42:01.370
600 bucks depending on whether or not the fucking mechanic wants to have a keg

678
00:42:01.371 --> 00:42:05.150
party that weekend.
You know,
and I don't know how to fix the shit.

679
00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.150
So all you guys are going to send me emails,
do it.

680
00:42:07.151 --> 00:42:10.520
There's no fucking way I know this.
No fucking way.
All right.

681
00:42:10.521 --> 00:42:14.690
But I don't have time to find the fucking guy that's going to give me that.

682
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.420
I think actually,
whatever.
I have no fucking idea.

683
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:20.450
I have no idea what it's supposed to cost.
I drive a hybrid.

684
00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:21.950
It's half a fucking spaceship.

685
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:26.300
God knows what the health behind those plastic bumpers.

686
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:31.490
But um,
so that's my day.
I just got off the beaten track.
What the fuck is today?

687
00:42:31.491 --> 00:42:33.350
Today's the 29th of November.

688
00:42:33.351 --> 00:42:37.580
This is the Monday morning podcast and I hope all you guys had a happy

689
00:42:37.581 --> 00:42:41.210
thanksgiving.
I apologize last week for the volume.
I don't know what happened.

690
00:42:41.211 --> 00:42:43.310
I don't know if I hit it or what,
but uh,

691
00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:48.170
I'm surprised I didn't get more than the 30 complaints I got for how quiet it
is.

692
00:42:48.171 --> 00:42:53.000
So this week it's going to be nice and loud.
Okay.
So called white man.

693
00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.080
Um,
so anyways,
let's get through the podcast here.

694
00:42:57.081 --> 00:43:01.860
I would,
I do this weekend I have after thanksgiving.
Um,

695
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:05.420
you know that this podcast has,
this podcast has a lot of momentum,

696
00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.960
but not a lot of funny.
I'm just fucking,
you know,

697
00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:12.150
you ever switched your drunk when you go down a flight of stairs and you start

698
00:43:12.151 --> 00:43:15.350
the fall and you just like,
well fuck it.
I'm going in this direction anyways,

699
00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:17.120
so you don't even try to break your fall.

700
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:21.320
That's basically how I've been doing this podcast.
So I'm going to take a breath,

701
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.240
let it out,
and I'm just going to fucking relax here.

702
00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.110
I'm going to tell you about my weekend.
I had a phenomenal weekend.

703
00:43:30.111 --> 00:43:31.850
Everybody just sit back,

704
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:37.850
take your fucking scrunchy out,
let your hair fall down around your shoulders.

705
00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:42.830
Um,
no,
I went to a,
a,
I did the more theater,
the more,

706
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:47.840
the more theater up in,
uh,
Seattle,
Washington.

707
00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:52.790
And um,
I'm going to tell you a fucking underrated right now,
Seattle,

708
00:43:52.791 --> 00:43:56.630
Washington.
That place is,
uh,

709
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:59.450
that places the shit.
And if you ever decided,
you know,

710
00:43:59.451 --> 00:44:04.451
you didn't want to fucking go overseas or go to some stupid fucking place just

711
00:44:04.461 --> 00:44:08.450
because it had palm trees.
Uh,
Seattle is a,
is a,

712
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:11.690
it's just a fucking awesome city.
Although I got to tell you,

713
00:44:11.691 --> 00:44:15.950
the weather is just as brutal as they say.
You know,
I have this new fancy phone.

714
00:44:15.951 --> 00:44:18.950
I went out and got the droid incredible and

715
00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:25.340
it always has the forecast.
If it's sunny out,
there's a sun.
If it's cloudy,

716
00:44:25.341 --> 00:44:28.670
they just have a look.
They have a cloud.
The whole fucking weekend I was,

717
00:44:28.671 --> 00:44:32.940
there was just this gray cloud on phone.
And I got to admit,

718
00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:36.630
after three days it was really starting to fuck with me.
Um,

719
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:38.550
and even when they actually,

720
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:43.290
when you would look at the forecast and they would try to predict the next

721
00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:45.870
couple of days,
they didn't have the balls to just say it was sunny.

722
00:44:45.871 --> 00:44:49.560
They always throw a couple of clouds in front of the sun just to hedge their

723
00:44:49.561 --> 00:44:53.580
bets.
Uh,
but anyways,
I did the,
uh,

724
00:44:53.581 --> 00:44:57.570
the Moore theater up there with Paul Versey.
Uh,

725
00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:01.250
my gambling associates slash comedian buddy.
Um,

726
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:05.190
and man,
I had a fucking great time.
If you have,
you listen every week,

727
00:45:05.191 --> 00:45:06.001
you already know this shit.

728
00:45:06.001 --> 00:45:08.790
If you're just tuning in for the first time where you haven't listened to a

729
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:09.000
couple of weeks,

730
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000
the more theater is a legendary music venue up there in Seattle.

731
00:45:14.281 --> 00:45:18.060
All those grunge bands played it.
Alison Change Soundgarden Nirvana,

732
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:21.660
pearl jam shot that video there for ra even flow.

733
00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:26.430
Remember that when Eddie Vedder walked out and kind of fell off the balcony or

734
00:45:26.431 --> 00:45:30.910
whatever the hell he did a,
as they would go,
Bam,
pick a tech,
a tech Gand band,

735
00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:33.000
I could take it to gain whatever the fuck they were playing.

736
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:37.020
I never got into them until later on.
I never liked that first album,

737
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:41.820
even PLO.
I never got into that shit.
But anyways,

738
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.720
so I went there and um,

739
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:50.780
I found out the theaters like over a hundred years old and it had three tiers to

740
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:55.791
it and the upper most tier back in the day during a segregation when they had

741
00:45:57.511 --> 00:46:00.510
the white section and the black section all the way up top,

742
00:46:00.511 --> 00:46:05.511
there was the black section and they hadn't really done any different,

743
00:46:05.731 --> 00:46:09.300
uh,
anything different to the theater I guess.

744
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.690
So they still had this CEP,

745
00:46:11.691 --> 00:46:16.110
there's still a separate staircase to go all the way the fuck up there.

746
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:19.920
And I got to tell you,
cause I'm a history buff and that type of shit,
I'm like,

747
00:46:19.921 --> 00:46:24.480
I got to see this,
I got to check this shit out.
So the guy takes us up there,
man.

748
00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:25.920
It was fucking ridiculous.

749
00:46:25.921 --> 00:46:30.870
You had to walk up like two flights of like,
you know,
10,

750
00:46:30.871 --> 00:46:33.600
12 stairs and then it was just,

751
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:38.010
it's like you're going up the beginning part of the statue of Liberty before it

752
00:46:38.011 --> 00:46:42.210
becomes that spiral staircase and it was like a fucking nine floor walk up.

753
00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:47.550
And you got like fucking six levels up and literally your thighs are burning,

754
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:50.070
you know,
and we started joking,

755
00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:54.750
this right here is why you don't see any white running backs at the pro level

756
00:46:54.751 --> 00:46:55.584
anymore.

757
00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:00.570
We used to just waltz right in to the fucking theater with our fucking doughy

758
00:47:00.571 --> 00:47:05.250
white legs and we'd sit down right at the lower level.
Meanwhile,

759
00:47:05.251 --> 00:47:10.251
the black dudes had to fucking walk up like 200 fucking stairs and they had the

760
00:47:10.621 --> 00:47:12.180
lean forward,
you know,

761
00:47:12.181 --> 00:47:15.030
to try to watch the show that strengthens the back muscles.

762
00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:20.150
It's a fucking workout just to watch some jackass go up there and go,
Mami,
oh,

763
00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:22.950
I love you.
How I love you Mami.
You know,

764
00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:28.080
that's my fucking theory.
Either that or we just suck.
You know,
it's funny,

765
00:47:28.081 --> 00:47:31.180
we actually went to a trailblazer's gave Friday night me and version and we had,

766
00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:32.170
what do we bet?

767
00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:37.360
We bet the fuck in a New Orleans who bet New Orleans was Sean.

768
00:47:37.361 --> 00:47:40.990
Paul was sitting there watching it,
right?
And uh,

769
00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:45.970
the fucking,
the game keep,
every time we go we're going to be winning a bet.

770
00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:50.820
Portland comes back,
right?
And then all of a sudden a New Orleans,
I'm,

771
00:47:50.821 --> 00:47:51.251
I'm sorry,

772
00:47:51.251 --> 00:47:53.950
I'm fucking this story up because I keep thinking it's the Charlotte Hornets,

773
00:47:53.951 --> 00:47:54.880
the New Orleans Hornets,

774
00:47:54.881 --> 00:47:59.080
New Orleans comes flying down the court on this fast break and they'd dump it

775
00:47:59.081 --> 00:48:02.650
off to this white dude.
And of course he misses the fucking layup.

776
00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:03.610
And I swear to God,

777
00:48:03.611 --> 00:48:07.510
me and [inaudible] both looked at each other and in unison went fucking white

778
00:48:07.511 --> 00:48:10.870
guy,
you know,
and then we just started laughing.
But it's true.

779
00:48:10.871 --> 00:48:15.640
It's like get them off the court,
you know,
give him a ref shirt.

780
00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:19.180
Other than that,
get them the fuck out of there.
I got money on this fucking game.

781
00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:24.700
It's annoying,
man.
It's fucking embarrassing.
I Dunno.
I Dunno what happened to us.

782
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.190
Um,
but I think some of them,

783
00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.160
some of it has to do with that flight of stairs that I saw up there at the Moore

784
00:48:30.161 --> 00:48:30.994
theater.

785
00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:39.370
That's offensive.
Oh,
go fuck yourself.
Have a merry Christmas.
Anyways,

786
00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:43.870
I,
um,
I got to tell you that show that I did at the,
uh,

787
00:48:43.871 --> 00:48:48.871
the Moore theater there in Seattle was probably the best crowd that was like the

788
00:48:50.471 --> 00:48:54.040
best crowd I've had since my standup special.
And I've had some great ones,

789
00:48:54.041 --> 00:48:58.960
but I'm telling you,
man,
it was real.
I just want,

790
00:48:58.961 --> 00:49:01.870
it was one of those shows where I just walked out and the first word,

791
00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:05.590
I felt like it.
Uh,
it clicked.
Nia,
you look gorgeous.

792
00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:10.150
You look gorgeous.
All right,
go get them.
Knock 'em dead.

793
00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:15.430
Break a leg kicked our ass.
Look them right in the eye.

794
00:49:15.431 --> 00:49:19.840
Tell him to go fuck themselves,
but with your eyes,
you know,
read those sites.

795
00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:25.600
You get my right and you get my left.
I'm going to keep talking to you too.

796
00:49:25.601 --> 00:49:27.670
You leave.
I'm in the middle of telling a story here.

797
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.750
Let me pick out the right earrings.
They're earrings that go with this outfit.

798
00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:36.610
There's the jewelry box.
Where's the bracelet?
Oh my God.

799
00:49:36.611 --> 00:49:40.270
Does anything take longer than your fucking girl to pick out a shit and get out

800
00:49:40.271 --> 00:49:43.840
of the Goddamn Room?
That's all.

801
00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.630
I'm trying to get you to yell at me near to add to the comedy.

802
00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:56.860
Yeah,
I know,
but you know how I am.
You know I'm going to add you to it.

803
00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:00.610
Am I supposed to act like you're not in the room?
That's fucking weird.

804
00:50:00.611 --> 00:50:04.300
Like you're a guest.
Like I'm actually doing this in a radio show.

805
00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:12.400
Yeah,
she's gone.
All right.
Anyways,
um,
the fuck was I talking about?

806
00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:13.510
Yeah,
it was one of these shows,

807
00:50:13.511 --> 00:50:16.900
like I went out there and I was ridiculously excited.
You know,

808
00:50:16.901 --> 00:50:18.160
cause I'm a music geek.

809
00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.090
You combine the fact that I'm a music Geek and then I'm a history buff.

810
00:50:22.091 --> 00:50:25.630
He combined the whole thing.
It's a 100 year old theater downstairs.

811
00:50:25.631 --> 00:50:29.290
It's all fucking cramped.
They,
these little doorways,
you know,

812
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:32.030
cause back in the day we weren't all hopped up on these fucking,

813
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:37.430
whatever the fucking horse tranquilizers they put into the chicken nowadays.

814
00:50:37.431 --> 00:50:42.050
So now we're all like at least five 11 for some fucking reason.
You know,

815
00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:46.790
they had those little douche bags with the powdered wigs a hundred years ago.

816
00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:50.270
Right.
Who Actually,
these people stop wearing powdered wigs.

817
00:50:50.271 --> 00:50:52.430
Gow Fuck Yourself.
I know.

818
00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:55.370
I'm just saying you ever seen those old pictures,

819
00:50:55.371 --> 00:50:57.730
those little runt sitting there and making the fucking,
uh,

820
00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:03.640
the railroads are standing there with their evil fucking white guy.

821
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:08.060
Racist Mustache is the,
uh,
the Chinese guys built it,
right.

822
00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:11.630
At least they built it from San Francisco.
All right.
People,
I'm a history buff.

823
00:51:11.631 --> 00:51:15.410
I didn't say I know the history.
I just thought I just sorta walk by it.

824
00:51:15.411 --> 00:51:18.980
Every once in a while.
I read a couple of plaques in the museum.
I'm that guy.

825
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:24.110
Then I deliberately try to shoe horn the information.
I just read it at a,
at a,

826
00:51:24.111 --> 00:51:27.680
at a museum and to whatever conversation is going on at a party,

827
00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:33.200
you know,
I was kidding him.
A fucking moron.
Anyways,
let's plow ahead here.
So,

828
00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:37.610
um,
I was really excited to do the show and I walked out there and it was just,

829
00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.890
just from,
I don't know,

830
00:51:39.891 --> 00:51:44.891
some shows you just go out there and from the first word you just lock in with

831
00:51:44.901 --> 00:51:48.820
the crowd.
And uh,
that's what happened.
And they were,
yeah,
they were just,

832
00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:52.250
they were just a great crowd.
Totally went along for the ride.

833
00:51:52.251 --> 00:51:56.180
For some reason they didn't turn the fucking heat on in the building.

834
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:59.900
Um,
and I think that's what happened.

835
00:51:59.901 --> 00:52:03.830
I just started making fun of how fucking cold it was and then that just sort of

836
00:52:03.831 --> 00:52:08.630
opened my brain up and I went off and I had a great time and I want to thank

837
00:52:08.631 --> 00:52:13.550
everybody up in Seattle who came out to,
uh,
came out to the shelf.

838
00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.980
So that was my weekend.
I'll wait a minute,

839
00:52:15.981 --> 00:52:19.480
then I went to the Seahawks game on Sunday and uh,

840
00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.690
the fuck did I go to and I'm fucking white.
Dot.
I came around.

841
00:52:23.691 --> 00:52:26.420
What the Hell I did,
went to the Seahawks game with Versie.
That's right.

842
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:30.040
We will walk into the stadium going,
should we bet the fucking Seahawks?
Oh,

843
00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:30.470
we see.

844
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:33.560
Should we bet the chiefs in both those teams have fucked me over the whole God

845
00:52:33.561 --> 00:52:38.330
damn year and a,
we bet the fucking Seahawks.
You know,

846
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.650
I was just sick of going to games and rooting against the home team.

847
00:52:42.651 --> 00:52:45.350
So I actually bet with my heart,
like a fucking asshole.

848
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:50.540
And the second I showed up and I saw Pete Carroll and his entire coaching staff

849
00:52:50.541 --> 00:52:53.660
in those fucking Khaki Docker's,

850
00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.810
I don't know why they're wearing those things.

851
00:52:56.811 --> 00:52:59.330
You know like they're going to go play the fucking Ryder Cup.

852
00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:03.920
This is football and it was a,
the game started off awesome.

853
00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:05.600
First of all,

854
00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:10.130
it's the loudest fucking Stadium Professional Football Stadium I've ever been to

855
00:53:10.131 --> 00:53:13.340
and I think it's louder than even when I went to western Michigan,

856
00:53:13.341 --> 00:53:18.140
the big house as far as I can remember,
I'd have to go to a Michigan game again.

857
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:20.870
It was louder than Ohio state,

858
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:24.950
I think it was the loudest fucking football game I'd ever been to was it was,

859
00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:28.830
I know you guys think I'm exaggerating,
but I'm not bullshitting.
First of all,

860
00:53:28.831 --> 00:53:33.120
they started off and every fucking week they have some guy come out there and

861
00:53:33.121 --> 00:53:35.970
they've got this big thing out there.
The 12th man,
which is the crowd,

862
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.450
a phone for non sports fans is 11 guys.

863
00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:42.870
In any given time when you play in the game live in guys on defense,

864
00:53:42.871 --> 00:53:46.890
11 guys on offense,
that type of shit.
So the 12th guy's the fucking fan,

865
00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:51.900
little bit of pandering,
but you know these fans earn it.
So just start the game.

866
00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:53.790
They have some fucking,

867
00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:58.820
they just find some dude that's gonna fucking ramp the crowd up to come out and

868
00:53:59.791 --> 00:54:03.030
raise the 12 12th man flag.

869
00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:07.080
Like we're going to Goddamn or like you already conquered some shit.

870
00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:12.570
All right?
Never.
Denley earlier this year on some sort of veteran's day,

871
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:16.680
they brought out some old guy who stormed the beaches of Normandy,

872
00:54:16.681 --> 00:54:20.220
came out to get his purple hearts and all that and the poor bastard.

873
00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:23.690
It took him like 20 minutes to raise the flag because he was so old.
But it just,

874
00:54:23.691 --> 00:54:27.210
the fact that the fucking guy storm normally the place and a place almost

875
00:54:27.211 --> 00:54:31.770
collapsed people flipping out.
So the week we went,

876
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:35.810
they brought the guy,
I can't remember his name,
that actor,
uh,

877
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:39.600
who was in top gun viper,

878
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:43.950
I believe his name was to do two flew with Maverick's dad deck guy came out

879
00:54:43.951 --> 00:54:46.290
there.
So they're playing the top gun music and all that.

880
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:49.250
And it should have been cheesy,
but it was,
it was Kinda cheesy.

881
00:54:49.251 --> 00:54:52.920
It was fucking hilarious and a,
that's a guilty pleasure.

882
00:54:52.921 --> 00:54:56.010
Everybody loves that movie.
So the place is just going fucking nuts.

883
00:54:56.670 --> 00:55:00.930
And I'm feeling like,
uh,
I'm feeling like we're going to win.
I bet.

884
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:06.300
And then Kansas City gets the ball and immediately first play from scrimmage,

885
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:11.490
castle rolls out and just fucking throws one 12 yards first down.
Right.

886
00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:15.550
And all of a sudden I hear this voice behind me and I,
it,
I just say,

887
00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:20.310
this guy just go and they'll fucking sea hawks,
quarterback sock.

888
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:25.950
Right.
And I turned around and it's this big fat Kansas City chiefs fan,

889
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:28.020
and he was so fat.

890
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:31.980
You could just tell he knew about football and this son of a bitch was right

891
00:55:31.981 --> 00:55:34.080
because they got burned the entire fucking gay.

892
00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.550
I don't want to talk about the rest of it.

893
00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:38.580
So he ended up losing the money we won on the fucking Portland game.

894
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:43.080
We ended up giving it back.
But,
uh,
I don't know.

895
00:55:43.081 --> 00:55:44.250
It was still an awesome time.

896
00:55:44.251 --> 00:55:47.460
We ended up meeting some people from the show and they had these seats right

897
00:55:47.461 --> 00:55:51.300
down on the end zone.
So we fucking went all the way down for the second half.

898
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:55.830
And you're actually basically sitting on the field and uh,

899
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:59.760
you know what sucked was Seattle actually scored a touchdown.

900
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:02.580
They threw a bomb is 50 yard bomb for a touchdown.

901
00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:06.720
And I was in the suite taking a piss.
And when I come walking out,

902
00:56:06.721 --> 00:56:10.380
as I'm walking out trying to see past all these people stuffing their faces with

903
00:56:10.381 --> 00:56:11.214
Nachos,

904
00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:15.030
I just see these male cheerleaders running around with those Seahawk flags,

905
00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:20.640
you know,
out on the field and the crowd's going nuts.
And I was like,

906
00:56:20.641 --> 00:56:25.240
you gotta be shitting me.
So other than that,
it was a great fucking time.

907
00:56:25.241 --> 00:56:29.980
So we had an awesome time up there in Seattle and went down to the,
uh,

908
00:56:29.981 --> 00:56:34.390
the fish market,
their guts.
It was just,
it was awesome.
It was,
it was just,

909
00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:37.690
it was fucking phenomenal.
50 if it just could have been a little sunny,

910
00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:41.320
it would have been the best weekend I had all goddamn year.

911
00:56:41.321 --> 00:56:42.370
Other than other than the,

912
00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:47.680
the depressing gray skies and you,
it's funny,
he's everything.

913
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.380
I was joking on stage.
Everything in Seattle is made,

914
00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.170
I swear to God from the same bag of concrete,

915
00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:57.490
see exact same consistency.
It's the exact same fucking color.

916
00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:00.790
And on those overcast days,
it just,

917
00:57:00.791 --> 00:57:04.690
the horizon just blends in with that concrete and it says,

918
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:08.890
I can really see why people fucking blow their brains out up there.
You know,

919
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:11.620
if you're not careful,
if you're not fucking careful,

920
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:16.570
you can end up like that fellow there,
that fellow from that,
from that,

921
00:57:16.571 --> 00:57:20.530
that place who,
who did that stuff?
Remember that guy?
Um,

922
00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:23.050
you know what I noticed about Paul Brizy last week?

923
00:57:23.051 --> 00:57:25.690
I was giving him shit and I can't give him shit this week cause I went one in

924
00:57:25.691 --> 00:57:26.021
three.

925
00:57:26.021 --> 00:57:29.380
I officially do not know shit about football when it comes to fucking gambling.

926
00:57:29.381 --> 00:57:31.960
And evidently,
uh,

927
00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:35.770
I don't know shit about a football without gambling because I said the Steelers,

928
00:57:35.771 --> 00:57:39.040
we're going to be the team to beat fucking assholes.

929
00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:42.880
You can't cover against the God damn bills.

930
00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:46.690
What the fuck is wrong with that team?
They got the defense.

931
00:57:46.691 --> 00:57:51.400
They got Ben Roethlisberger is back.
Is it because he can't rape anybody anymore?

932
00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:54.430
It's fucking thrown off his game.
I don't know what's going on,
but they got all,

933
00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:56.470
maybe they got some injuries.
That's another thing.

934
00:57:56.471 --> 00:57:58.300
Why I suck at gambling is cause I don't,

935
00:57:58.301 --> 00:58:03.301
I can't watch ESPN because they just hype shit through the fucking roof.

936
00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:08.980
Like that Monday night football game,
Michael Vick,
remember that?

937
00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:12.020
Thought there was over,
just give him the Superbowl.
True.
Michael Vick,

938
00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:16.780
Michael Vick,
Michael Vick.
What was gene tonight?
We,
Michael Vick.

939
00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:17.790
It was fucking over.

940
00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:22.090
They weren't even addressing the fact that he was doing it against the hapless

941
00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:27.460
Washington.
Fucking Redskins
didn't even mention that.

942
00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:30.520
And then what happens the next week they played the giants.
Giants beat him,

943
00:58:30.521 --> 00:58:34.990
I believe contained Vic this week.
I still got their fucking voices in my head.

944
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:38.320
Michael Vick,
fucking Michael Vick,
right?
So what do I do?

945
00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:41.410
I fucking put money on the Goddamn Eagles in the fucking bears.

946
00:58:41.411 --> 00:58:44.620
Kicked the shit out of him.
So once again,

947
00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:49.420
and I even said on this pot podcast when somebody tried to say that Michael Vick

948
00:58:49.421 --> 00:58:52.510
was the best quarterback in the fucking league because he kicked the shit out of

949
00:58:52.511 --> 00:58:54.010
the Redskins one fucking week.

950
00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:59.310
And it's the exactly the reason why I keep trying to tell people that Peyton

951
00:58:59.411 --> 00:59:01.600
manning isn't as great as people are saying,

952
00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:07.210
I give up,
but you know something.
I've actually,
I give up with that argument.

953
00:59:07.211 --> 00:59:11.320
I officially fucking give up because this guy after my show in Seattle,

954
00:59:11.321 --> 00:59:16.150
just started the argument with me and then followed up and sent me an email.

955
00:59:16.151 --> 00:59:20.830
And one of the points he wanted to make as to the reason why Tom Brady was an

956
00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:23.780
inferior quarterback was because of his knee injury.

957
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:29.450
He said something that if Tom Brady knew how to scramble and didn't suck so bad,

958
00:59:29.451 --> 00:59:32.750
he wouldn't have injured his fucking knee.
Now that's a funny fucking line,

959
00:59:32.751 --> 00:59:36.560
but this guy was actually serious.
So at this point,
it's just like whatever,

960
00:59:36.561 --> 00:59:41.030
people like who they like.
So go ahead.
Like who you like,

961
00:59:41.031 --> 00:59:44.100
I don't give a fuck.
Anyways.
Um,

962
00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:47.210
I finally got bored with that whole fucking thing.
And also I got to,
I just,

963
00:59:47.211 --> 00:59:49.970
I just don't believe in the Patriots.

964
00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:53.120
I just can't get behind that fucking defense.

965
00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:56.720
Bella checks a fucking genius can make the,
make the adjustments,

966
00:59:56.721 --> 01:00:01.721
but we're not going to go anywhere with that giving up 24 to 30 points every

967
01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:06.850
fucking week.
Did you see Fatboy slim there?
Uh,
uh,

968
01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:11.430
what's his face?
Rex Ryan trying the,

969
01:00:11.431 --> 01:00:16.310
the age old world against us fucking speech,
you know,

970
01:00:16.311 --> 01:00:18.440
trying to paint his team as the underdog.

971
01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:22.420
Do you think his team's dumb enough to fucking believe it?
I do.
You know,

972
01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:27.230
allow people out there that check of the needs and Beth came and the leg.

973
01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:28.693
Well,

974
01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:33.710
we have that and one of those guy and he gives his stupid fat John Wayne Smile.

975
01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.180
Ah,

976
01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:40.160
Jesus fucking Christ cookie dough wheat and fucking patent looking jackass.

977
01:00:40.161 --> 01:00:41.480
I'm so fucking sick of them.

978
01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:49.360
It's how to fuck you guys kicked the shit out of us when the fuck you getting

979
01:00:49.871 --> 01:00:52.820
off of this fucking underdog talk you fucking Pansy.

980
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:54.620
What are you already hedging your bet?

981
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:58.730
You afraid you're going to fucking lose you faggot.
Oh,

982
01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:03.530
there's no game in the world that I want to win more than this Monday night

983
01:01:03.531 --> 01:01:07.150
coming up next week.
The patriots versus the jets.
I want,
I,
I,

984
01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.780
I can't remember the last time.

985
01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:13.130
This is worse than Celtics Lakers and you know what the sad thing is is we're

986
01:01:13.131 --> 01:01:18.050
not going to fucking win cause at defense sucks fucking assholes.

987
01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:23.060
24 to 30 points a game.
There's no fucking way you can give that up.

988
01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:27.470
The jets have to good at defense those mother fuckers and now the Steelers

989
01:01:27.471 --> 01:01:29.990
aren't stepping on maybe the ravens.
Maybe the ravens will say,

990
01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:31.970
but that's all I need.
That's all I need.

991
01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:37.190
I don't give a fuck longest somebody beats the jets in the playoffs.

992
01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:42.220
I am going to be excited if that fucking half ass bullshit fucking team wins the

993
01:01:44.511 --> 01:01:45.344
super bowl,

994
01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:49.580
that fucking team that wins by the skin of that goddamn teeth hasn't fucking

995
01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:53.000
dominated anybody but my shit ass fucking defensive team,

996
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:58.340
it gets going to kill me.
It's absolutely going to fucking kill me.
I'm going to,

997
01:01:58.341 --> 01:02:00.200
I don't know what I'm going to do.
I'm going to have,

998
01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.080
I would say I cancel the podcast for two weeks,

999
01:02:03.081 --> 01:02:05.780
but that would be the bitch move after I talked to all his shit.

1000
01:02:05.781 --> 01:02:08.630
So I'm going to have to come in and take my shit if it happens.

1001
01:02:08.631 --> 01:02:13.340
But luckily I don't think it's going to happen,
but I got to admit,

1002
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:15.440
I got no fucking faith.
I got no faith.

1003
01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.560
The fuck you let the lion scored 24 points on you

1004
01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:24.840
got trampled by the browns were fucking horrific on defense.

1005
01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:29.040
We're good for the first two doubts.
What grade of what great with dead.

1006
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.030
Then third down,

1007
01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:33.180
I think that our defense is just having so much fun being out there that they're

1008
01:02:33.181 --> 01:02:36.840
like,
yeah,
let's just lit up 12 yards on a run.
Let's do it on a run.

1009
01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:41.880
They'll eat up some of the clock.
That'd be fucking awesome.
Um,
who else?
Fuck me.

1010
01:02:41.881 --> 01:02:46.630
Last week I,
Lila,
calm,
blaming everybody,
but myself for my,
uh,
for my,

1011
01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:51.030
my awful Pyxis this week.
Actually bet on Peyton manning.
You know,

1012
01:02:51.031 --> 01:02:54.120
all you douchebags telling me such a great fucking quarterback with his three

1013
01:02:54.121 --> 01:02:57.370
picks.
You know what,
why,

1014
01:02:57.371 --> 01:03:01.660
why wouldn't I realize at this point after the chargers have essentially what

1015
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:03.450
are they beating the cults at home?

1016
01:03:03.451 --> 01:03:07.590
Like what nine times in a fucking row a couple of times in the playoffs.

1017
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.640
Look at Peyton manning now.
Now that he has no fucking tools.
Now look at him.

1018
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:18.500
Look how average he looks and just fucking pissing people off our name.

1019
01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:21.870
Let's get off this fucking subject.
So that's my prediction.
Next.
I actually,

1020
01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:25.410
I think next week I think it's gonna be a tight fucking game,

1021
01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:29.280
but I just can't see us.
Uh,

1022
01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:34.070
it wouldn't surprise me because I can't believe he'd beat the Steelers,
but I,

1023
01:03:34.071 --> 01:03:37.320
I just,
I can't get behind a fucking team that lets up all those goddamn points.

1024
01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.090
They're fucking old lady.
We did.
Our defense should be dressed like matadors

1025
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.600
with big red capes.

1026
01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:51.150
Just letting receivers and running backs go down the field Olay.
Um,

1027
01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:55.320
all right.
I think that's about enough.
See that wasn't that bad.

1028
01:03:55.321 --> 01:03:57.900
I'm trying to tone down the fucking NFL Shit I get.
I'm getting really,

1029
01:03:57.930 --> 01:04:02.340
I'm never doing this again because I realized there's no fucking way I can talk

1030
01:04:02.341 --> 01:04:05.040
for 17 weeks about anything.

1031
01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:10.400
I am absolutely bored shitless with the sports talk with that specific shit.

1032
01:04:12.691 --> 01:04:13.980
I can't fucking do it anymore.

1033
01:04:13.981 --> 01:04:17.250
But now I have to hang in there cause I've talked so much God damn shit.

1034
01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:18.680
So maybe that'll be the engine.

1035
01:04:18.681 --> 01:04:20.940
Maybe that'll be the entertaining part of this podcast.

1036
01:04:20.941 --> 01:04:24.600
Listening to me talk about something I don't give him slowly not giving a fuck

1037
01:04:24.601 --> 01:04:27.840
about anymore.
Um,
all right.

1038
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:32.130
Oh,
I know what I want to talk.
I wanted to make fun of Paul Versey.

1039
01:04:32.131 --> 01:04:35.730
Do you guys remember that?
Fucking,
uh,
you remember good fellas?

1040
01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.440
Maybe that little movie,
Goodfellas,

1041
01:04:37.441 --> 01:04:40.560
it was just a little art house movie that kind of came and went and theaters

1042
01:04:40.561 --> 01:04:43.950
really quickly.
What was the name of that character in the beginning?
One of the,

1043
01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:47.280
uh,
Jimmy two times or whatever.
Get the papers,
get the papers.

1044
01:04:47.281 --> 01:04:51.930
Remember that Paul Versey is fucking,
uh,
Paulie three times.

1045
01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:58.020
It's not that he says shit twice or three times.
It's like,
I don't,

1046
01:04:58.021 --> 01:05:02.880
I don't know if he thinks that you can't hear him or f if he starts to make a

1047
01:05:02.881 --> 01:05:07.350
point and he realizes that the wall that he wanted to jump over with his point

1048
01:05:07.351 --> 01:05:09.630
is like six feet higher than he thought.

1049
01:05:09.631 --> 01:05:11.790
So he's got to run back another 10 paces.

1050
01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:16.890
I'd never met a guy who starts and then stops and then restarts his fucking

1051
01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:21.430
sentences more times than this guy who fucking at the game the other day.
Right.

1052
01:05:21.431 --> 01:05:25.120
I can't remember what we were just talking about something and this,
this is him

1053
01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:31.390
trying to make this point.
He goes,
goes,
you know people talk shit.

1054
01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:36.460
And he goes,
no.
He goes,
you know,
he goes,
people talk,
people talk shit,

1055
01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:41.920
dude.
People Talk Shit when they think they know what's going on

1056
01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:48.750
the whole fucking weekend.
It was driving me nuts.
Like watch it.

1057
01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:52.900
It was like the verbal equivalent.
You know,
when you watch those reality shows,

1058
01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:55.570
you know,
and they're about ready to weigh some fat fuck.

1059
01:05:55.571 --> 01:05:59.080
And then they do the scale and you're like,
oh fuck,
what's going to happen?

1060
01:05:59.081 --> 01:06:01.750
And then they go to commercial and then when they come back from compared

1061
01:06:01.751 --> 01:06:04.930
commercial,
they go right back to the fat fuck getting on the scale.

1062
01:06:04.931 --> 01:06:07.810
It's just like,
just wait the fucker.
Just weigh him.

1063
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:13.540
That's what verse he does.
Robinson Cano,

1064
01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.700
Dude Robinson Cano was four,
four,
four last night.

1065
01:06:20.290 --> 01:06:24.600
He does,
he,
he fucking,
he,
he,
he bangs against the door once just to see if,
oh,

1066
01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:27.180
if it's solid or it's particle board and then he,

1067
01:06:27.181 --> 01:06:29.290
he figures out how far back he has to run.

1068
01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:37.360
Don't you heard it here first?
All right.
The New York giants,

1069
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.020
dude,

1070
01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:43.020
the New York giants are going to fucking run the table hurting here first.

1071
01:06:43.601 --> 01:06:48.270
Paul,
I heard it the first nine times you said it.
I swear to God,
it's,
it's,

1072
01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:52.480
it's like he's got some sort of like a,
it's not a,
a speech impediment.

1073
01:06:52.481 --> 01:06:57.220
It's like a brain impediment.
He states starts to make a point and uh,

1074
01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:00.370
then there's like a heckler in his head.
Just go,
no Paul Unit.

1075
01:07:00.371 --> 01:07:03.730
You're not saying it with enough confidence.
Like there's a director going cut.

1076
01:07:03.731 --> 01:07:06.970
Cut.
Cut.
All right,
Paul.
No,
no,
no.
We,
we love what you're doing here.

1077
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:07.930
We love what you're doing here.

1078
01:07:07.931 --> 01:07:10.300
But if you could just come with a little more emotion this time,

1079
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:13.680
a little more fucking emotion.
Um,
all right,

1080
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:19.420
that'll,
that'll be about enough of that shit.
I'm really,
this is,

1081
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:22.000
this is what travel does to me this time of fucking year.

1082
01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:26.230
I fly through a fucking point and then I slammed into a brick wall and then I'm

1083
01:07:26.231 --> 01:07:29.890
done with it.
All right.
I'm done with fucking sports,
you know,

1084
01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:33.220
and that some of you on this podcast,
I'm fucking done with you.
You know,
you are,

1085
01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:38.620
uh,
let's get the youtube videos for the week.
Ladles and Sylvan.
Um,

1086
01:07:39.110 --> 01:07:42.160
and they,
they've actually at this point,
uh,

1087
01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:47.220
kind of broken off into two because we have the clips from the bad movies,

1088
01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:49.030
the great bad movies.

1089
01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:53.200
And I'm telling you some of the shit you guys are sending me is unbelievable.

1090
01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:57.720
And all these videos will be up on the [inaudible] podcast.com.
She's,

1091
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:59.800
she'll check this one out.
You got to see this one.

1092
01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.820
This is actually something that I brought up.
This is not a bad movie.

1093
01:08:03.821 --> 01:08:07.840
This is actually an incredible movie.
It's the original Manchurian candidate.

1094
01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:11.950
But I had mentioned a long time ago that there's a fight scene in there,

1095
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:16.790
Frank Sinatra versus Asian dude.
And,

1096
01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:21.380
um,
according to Frank Sinatra,

1097
01:08:21.381 --> 01:08:22.910
it's the first karate film,

1098
01:08:22.911 --> 01:08:27.410
the first Kung Fu film ever done in American cinema.

1099
01:08:27.411 --> 01:08:30.830
And you have to see how fucked it mean.
Especially now.
I mean,

1100
01:08:30.831 --> 01:08:31.850
I don't know how to fucking fight,

1101
01:08:31.851 --> 01:08:34.670
but I've watched enough UFC and you look at the stance,

1102
01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:37.610
the stance is that some of the stances they get in about three quarters into the

1103
01:08:37.611 --> 01:08:41.930
fight are just as ridiculous as that karate kid.
Um,

1104
01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:46.280
fear the sparrow or whatever the fuck that,
the name of that stance,

1105
01:08:46.281 --> 01:08:50.150
that bird cloth thing that he would do.
Um,

1106
01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:56.000
anyways,
I got to it's Manchurian candidate in 1962 fight.

1107
01:08:56.001 --> 01:08:57.470
You can look it up if you want to,

1108
01:08:57.471 --> 01:09:01.580
but we have all these videos listed nice and neatly along with some pictures

1109
01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:05.450
from my trip to Seattle,
if you'd like to see where we sat at the game.

1110
01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.680
Me and Mr [inaudible] took a picture of the nice fluffy fish and chips.

1111
01:09:09.681 --> 01:09:13.680
I got fucking unbelievable seafood.
That's a great place to take your,
your,

1112
01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:17.390
your girlfriend or your wife.
I fucked up.
I should have brought my girl,
you know,

1113
01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:18.481
but you know,

1114
01:09:18.481 --> 01:09:22.420
I was going to a couple of sporting events and she doesn't like sports,
you know,

1115
01:09:23.230 --> 01:09:24.910
you know,
when you date a girl doesn't like sports.

1116
01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:28.760
You take to a sporting event and all they talk about has how pretty the grass

1117
01:09:28.761 --> 01:09:33.510
looks.
And then by like the second inning,
they're just bored shitless.
Uh,

1118
01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:38.570
that's my experience when I take Nia places.
So,
uh,
you know,

1119
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:42.290
I don't,
I don't fucking know who's kidding,
who I fucked up.
Anyways,

1120
01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:47.090
let's plow head.
Um,
the second,
um,
great bad movie.
Here we go.

1121
01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:50.840
Uh,
I drink your blood 1970 trailer.

1122
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:54.890
This is the fact that they made this fucking movies.
It's just,

1123
01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:57.680
it's unbelievable.

1124
01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:03.320
But when you think back to it how there was no internet and uh,

1125
01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:07.790
just how early on they were into like those slasher kind of movies when you

1126
01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:10.040
actually watched this trailer,
like this is the kind of,

1127
01:10:10.041 --> 01:10:14.180
it's like very like you're really going after the serial killer sort of

1128
01:10:14.181 --> 01:10:15.050
demographic.

1129
01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:18.830
I bet like Ted Bundy and those fucking maniacs went to go see this stuff back

1130
01:10:18.831 --> 01:10:22.790
when it was shocking.
Now it's hilarious,
but it's really,
uh,

1131
01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:28.440
it's just really bizarre,
really fucking bizarre.
Um,
all right.
And his er,

1132
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:30.550
regular youtube videos for the week.
Um,

1133
01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:34.880
this one was actually already shown on tosh point.
Oh,
but this one is so funny.

1134
01:10:34.881 --> 01:10:37.400
I don't like to,
to show videos that have already been shown on that show,

1135
01:10:37.401 --> 01:10:39.980
but just in case you missed the episode,
this is fucking hilarious.

1136
01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.850
Remember that when I talked about last week,
man versus booze.
If you did that,

1137
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:46.670
this dude tries to chug a bottle of patroned,

1138
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:52.250
which by the way,
guys is really fucking dangerous.
All right?

1139
01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.370
If you actually did it successfully,
you would die.

1140
01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.890
Which is why this guy projectile vomits.

1141
01:10:58.310 --> 01:11:01.640
That's your body basically saying let's get this shit the fuck outta here so we

1142
01:11:01.641 --> 01:11:03.500
don't die.
Um,
the name of the video,

1143
01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:08.360
you want to search a Joe Breezy patroned challenge and uh,

1144
01:11:08.361 --> 01:11:10.130
this guy is fucking hilarious.

1145
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:13.860
The shit talk and he does in front of it is,

1146
01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:18.060
is almost as funny as when he pukes is,
you know,
this guy's a fucking riot.

1147
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:22.760
He's like mocking the shit talk.
I think that you see on a lot of these uh,

1148
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:26.580
videos of that you see on reality TV.
It's hilarious.
Um,

1149
01:11:26.581 --> 01:11:28.650
another one you guys see a lot of Christmas lights on.

1150
01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:31.830
You're on the houses as you driving around a check out.

1151
01:11:31.831 --> 01:11:35.850
This one heavy metal Christmas light show.
That one was actually on live,

1152
01:11:35.851 --> 01:11:38.400
leak.com heavy metal Christmas light show.

1153
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:43.260
And then there's another video here.
This one is awesome as far as like,

1154
01:11:43.261 --> 01:11:48.261
it's really interesting if anybody's into animals and you can explain this one.

1155
01:11:48.451 --> 01:11:52.740
It's crows verse Cat First Cat Street fight.

1156
01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:57.810
And this person put this unbill almost like they custom made this music for this

1157
01:11:57.811 --> 01:12:01.590
fight.
It's fucking incredible.
He's two cats.
I'm not,

1158
01:12:01.591 --> 01:12:03.340
I'm not going to ruin it for you.
Just,
you just got to see it.

1159
01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:07.950
It's fucking incredible.
Um,
another video,
I love this one.

1160
01:12:07.951 --> 01:12:11.700
It's called a censored 8,000,
800 pennies.

1161
01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:17.430
Um,
and it basically,
this dude looks like a college aged kid.

1162
01:12:17.431 --> 01:12:21.750
He got his car towed and he had to walk 15,
20 miles to get home.

1163
01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:23.370
The next day called up,

1164
01:12:23.371 --> 01:12:27.990
he found out where his car was and they wanted $88 to get it out.
So he said,

1165
01:12:27.991 --> 01:12:32.720
fuck it.
I got $88,
and he showed up with 8,000,
800 pennies.
Uh,

1166
01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:37.740
most of them unrolled and he brought it in and he's like,

1167
01:12:37.741 --> 01:12:40.170
it's legal tender.
You have to take it.
And ladies like,

1168
01:12:40.171 --> 01:12:42.660
I'm not going to take this,
I'm not taking this.
And he's like,

1169
01:12:42.661 --> 01:12:46.500
you got to take it's legal tender.
She's like,
I'm not taking it.
He goes,
fine.

1170
01:12:46.501 --> 01:12:51.210
I'm calling the cops,
which he did,
and you got to see it.
It's fucking awesome.

1171
01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:54.660
I don't want to ruin it,
but it's awesome.
Uh,
is another good one.

1172
01:12:54.661 --> 01:12:57.660
A speeding ticket fail.
Just a quick one for you.

1173
01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:01.050
People who don't like to watch a 10 minute videos and uh,

1174
01:13:01.051 --> 01:13:03.150
this is another great one.
Do this.

1175
01:13:03.151 --> 01:13:07.080
A really funny fucking filmmakers and actors and shit just fucking around.

1176
01:13:07.081 --> 01:13:10.020
Just regular people are on Youtube,
man.
These dudes are really funny,

1177
01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:14.910
especially the guy who fucking punches the pig.
And this one,
uh,

1178
01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:19.830
this is called Turbo Bacon epic Thanksgiving,
epic mealtime.

1179
01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:20.971
Uh,
you know,

1180
01:13:20.971 --> 01:13:24.240
I think I'd like to you every year they come up with a new fattening way to cook

1181
01:13:24.241 --> 01:13:26.910
a Turkey.
These guys just take it to the fucking nth degree.

1182
01:13:26.911 --> 01:13:30.600
They make like a 7,900 calorie,
uh,

1183
01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:34.160
Turkey man.
It's fucking insane.
And uh,

1184
01:13:34.290 --> 01:13:36.630
just watch the part where he's tenderizing the pig.

1185
01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:40.960
That's my favorite fucking part,
really made me laugh out loud.
Um,

1186
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.520
and let's get to the overrated,
underrated for this week.

1187
01:13:44.521 --> 01:13:47.760
Did I not get an advice one?
Why did I,
God dammit,

1188
01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:52.410
that's usually a nice fucking time filler.
Somebody asks me some fucking advice.

1189
01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:57.660
Um,
oh,
by the way,
speaking of advice,
uh,
did not Boosie,

1190
01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.300
still have not boost.

1191
01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:06.080
I am 44 days in 44 is a very famous number in professional sports.

1192
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:12.790
Right.
You all know who I'm talking about.
Who's the most famous number?
44

1193
01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:18.970
and all of professional sports.
Think about it.
That's right.

1194
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.740
You got it.
Robert Newhouse,
the old fullback used to block for Tony Doerr set.

1195
01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:28.690
You're absolutely right though.
And it's fucking Reggie Jackson was,

1196
01:14:28.691 --> 01:14:32.740
was was Hank Aaron 44.
I don't fucking know.

1197
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:36.340
You know what people really drop the ball on was the obscure sports facts.

1198
01:14:36.370 --> 01:14:39.040
I thought that people were going to work really gonna keep that one going.

1199
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:44.080
I thought I had a new segment and it,
it just died a quick death.
You know,

1200
01:14:44.081 --> 01:14:46.750
like one of those critically acclaimed shows.
Critics love it.

1201
01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:50.440
Eight other people are watching it and then it just fucking gets canceled

1202
01:14:50.441 --> 01:14:54.220
because no one else gives a shit.
And then what happens?
All right,

1203
01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:59.610
comes out on DVD and then everybody loves it.
Why they ever cancel this?
Alright.

1204
01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:02.860
Overrated.
Underrated for the week.
No,
I'm not done talking about booze.

1205
01:15:02.861 --> 01:15:07.600
I'm 44 fucking days in.
All right.
Uh,

1206
01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:12.340
all I got as I got San Francisco this week,
just as far as tentation goes.

1207
01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:18.160
I got San Francisco this week.
I'm playing COBB's comedy club for the first time.

1208
01:15:18.161 --> 01:15:19.690
I've always been a punchline guy.

1209
01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:25.000
Now I'm going across town playing cobb's comedy club this Thursday,

1210
01:15:25.001 --> 01:15:28.860
Friday,
Saturday and Sunday.
Um,

1211
01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:32.210
and I'm also doing a book signing in.

1212
01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.400
I got to get the,
I got to get you guys not a book signing.
I don't have a book.

1213
01:15:36.401 --> 01:15:40.570
I'm doing a DVD signing.
It's for,
uh,

1214
01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:45.460
to support,
uh,
research for AIDS and Amanda.
Oh,

1215
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:48.520
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck are,
you know the silly,
how dumb I am.

1216
01:15:48.521 --> 01:15:49.720
I didn't know the name of the bookstore.

1217
01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:53.230
I keep thinking Brookstone begins with a B.

1218
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:58.000
What's that bookstore everybody goes to see the only one left,
isn't it?

1219
01:15:59.830 --> 01:16:03.190
Wow.
I just went fucking blank.
Um,
yeah,

1220
01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:08.020
I'm going to be at one of those borders,
borders,
bookstore.
I want to be up there,

1221
01:16:08.021 --> 01:16:10.090
uh,
doing a book,
a book signing,

1222
01:16:10.091 --> 01:16:13.240
a DVD signing on Wednesday night before I do my gig.

1223
01:16:13.241 --> 01:16:16.120
And I absolutely love San Francisco and a,

1224
01:16:16.121 --> 01:16:18.790
if you guys know any cool places to eat cause I'm not drinking.

1225
01:16:18.791 --> 01:16:20.370
I'm really enjoying this.
I went to a,

1226
01:16:20.371 --> 01:16:23.800
I think it was called the steel diner in um,

1227
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:29.050
in Seattle.
Me and versing,
we got like the best fucking fish,

1228
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:33.100
most the freshest seafood.
You've,
you've ever fucking had those,

1229
01:16:33.101 --> 01:16:35.230
those goddamned deadliest catch guys show up.

1230
01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:39.250
You can buy shit right off the goddamn boats if you want to.
It's unbelievable.

1231
01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:44.140
Uh,
best fish and chips I've had,
uh,
I'm eating them like Jesus,

1232
01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:47.410
this is like light as air then,
you know,
cause it's deep fried and shit.

1233
01:16:47.410 --> 01:16:49.330
Afterwards I felt like I had a boot in my stomach,

1234
01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.580
but it was absolutely delicious.
So anyways,

1235
01:16:51.581 --> 01:16:56.530
I'm not boozing if you guys know of any,
uh,
any,
any cool restaurants,

1236
01:16:56.531 --> 01:16:59.740
if that man versus food guy went there and I don't want to eat the fucking

1237
01:16:59.741 --> 01:17:02.410
challenge thing,
but if he went there like that Burger,

1238
01:17:02.411 --> 01:17:06.220
I was trying to remember the name of Juicy Lucy,
the one in Minneapolis.

1239
01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:08.980
I missed out on that.
So if this,
if there's something,

1240
01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:13.610
whatever people in San Francisco,
late night,
you're drunk or you're going just,

1241
01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:17.600
or you just went there as a kid,
you had to get this sandwich or this pizza,

1242
01:17:17.601 --> 01:17:21.870
whatever,
please let me know where it is because uh,
I need some,
uh,

1243
01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:25.400
productive shit to be doing rather than sitting around thinking about booze and

1244
01:17:25.401 --> 01:17:29.420
cause I got to admit that weather up there in Seattle,

1245
01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:30.620
you know,

1246
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:35.180
it makes you want to eat comfort food and then just go out and drink whatever

1247
01:17:35.181 --> 01:17:38.690
local beer that they have.
Ah,
fuck.

1248
01:17:38.691 --> 01:17:41.420
That's what I really miss about booze and you know,

1249
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:47.330
I'll tell you a great time to go to Cleveland,
Ohio,
Cleveland,
Ohio,

1250
01:17:47.331 --> 01:17:49.910
this time a year.
Great.
When you get into December,

1251
01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:52.010
go out there and go to a browns game.

1252
01:17:52.011 --> 01:17:55.280
They got a great team and they got this fucking Christmas Ale out there.

1253
01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:59.420
That is the shit and it's an extra couple of,
uh,

1254
01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:01.790
I think they have one in,
in,
in Pittsburgh too.

1255
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:05.320
This is a really knocked me back on the wagon.
Why don't you guys sit,

1256
01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.610
send me a list if you guys in those colder cities,

1257
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.960
just because that seems to be where they only put those,
those beers out,

1258
01:18:12.230 --> 01:18:17.180
those seasonal beers that come out.
Man,
a fucking unbelievable.
Um,

1259
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:20.570
Jesus Christ.
Am I gonna be able to make it to the Rose Bowl?

1260
01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:24.560
I'm actually contemplating not drinking at the Rose Bowl and this year rather

1261
01:18:24.561 --> 01:18:29.480
than going with,
with one other drunk buddy,
I'm going with two other three other,

1262
01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:34.150
I got a crew of four and uh,
I dunno,

1263
01:18:34.190 --> 01:18:38.920
for some reason I want to see if I can go 100 days.
I know I can,
but uh,

1264
01:18:38.921 --> 01:18:42.200
I got to admit,
man,
I was in Seattle was fucking really difficult,

1265
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:44.380
really difficult.
But every day,

1266
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:47.240
every day you wake up when you didn't drink the night before you wake up,

1267
01:18:47.241 --> 01:18:51.540
you feel good.
You know,
you work out,
go down,

1268
01:18:51.570 --> 01:18:52.910
you get yourself a juice,

1269
01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:56.780
you sit there stone sober.

1270
01:18:57.140 --> 01:19:00.920
Don't have any good stories to tell because you didn't fucking do anything the

1271
01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:03.410
night before.
And you sit there bored shitless with the,

1272
01:19:03.411 --> 01:19:06.560
but you have the exact same brain cells you had the night before.
People,

1273
01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.820
I think the level of brain cells you have left is,

1274
01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:15.840
it is exactly equal to the amount of fun that you had in life as a theory.

1275
01:19:16.671 --> 01:19:21.110
I just came up with,
you know,
if you have half your brain cells left,

1276
01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:22.910
you enjoyed half of your life.

1277
01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:28.970
A fucking makes no sense.
But you know what I mean.
All right,

1278
01:19:28.971 --> 01:19:30.890
let's stop talking about boots.
Cause I swear to God,

1279
01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:33.350
I still have one of those Murphy's stout in the fucking roof.

1280
01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:34.820
I keep leaving in there.

1281
01:19:34.821 --> 01:19:37.580
I can't get myself to dump it down the sink because it's such a good beer,

1282
01:19:37.581 --> 01:19:38.414
you know?

1283
01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.470
And I keep thinking that some friend out here that I don't really have is going

1284
01:19:41.471 --> 01:19:45.620
to come swinging by.
Would you like a bear?
I'm going to pour it to him.
Hands.

1285
01:19:45.621 --> 01:19:50.480
Fucking trembling.
Like a Goddamn crack addict.
Um,
anyways,
overrated.

1286
01:19:50.481 --> 01:19:54.170
Underrated for the week here.
Um,
all right.

1287
01:19:54.171 --> 01:19:58.370
Overrated laptops.
Uh,
the batteries fucked after a month.

1288
01:19:58.371 --> 01:20:01.700
So when you move to scratch your ass,
you'd delete half of your work.

1289
01:20:01.701 --> 01:20:04.850
Isn't that the fucking truth?
I'm underrated.

1290
01:20:04.851 --> 01:20:08.100
Throwing snowballs on cars are at cars.

1291
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:12.480
No easier way to get your ass kicked.
Wow.

1292
01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:13.680
Now there's something to do.

1293
01:20:13.681 --> 01:20:17.580
If you're not drinking and you still want an adrenaline,
adrenaline rush,

1294
01:20:17.581 --> 01:20:17.970
you know,

1295
01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:21.330
you remember that as a kid when he threw a snowball at a car and you got him

1296
01:20:21.331 --> 01:20:26.331
real good and the guy slammed on his brakes and fucking pulled over that fucking

1297
01:20:26.611 --> 01:20:31.611
adrenaline rush as you turned around and your snow suit and your big stupid

1298
01:20:31.621 --> 01:20:36.360
boots trying to run in like a foot of snow that actually comes up to mid thigh

1299
01:20:36.361 --> 01:20:40.440
because you're so small.
Oh Man.
That was fun.

1300
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:42.960
That was a good fucking time back in the day.

1301
01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:46.590
That's another reason why people always think it snowed more when you were a
kid.

1302
01:20:46.591 --> 01:20:50.100
It's because you were a fucking midget walking around in the snow though.

1303
01:20:50.101 --> 01:20:53.670
When I was a kid,
we used to have snowstorms.
Hey,
would come up to your waist,

1304
01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.560
you know?
Yeah,
dude,
you are for

1305
01:20:58.070 --> 01:21:00.840
five fucking years old.
Remember that Shit,

1306
01:21:00.841 --> 01:21:03.180
you're knocked out your front teeth and your dad's shoes,

1307
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:07.140
you will little you dumb.
Fuck.
Um,
alright.

1308
01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:12.420
Overrated coffee houses.
This guy says,
I can't stand these places.

1309
01:21:12.810 --> 01:21:16.320
People show up in their scarves and laptops,
ex,
uh,

1310
01:21:16.450 --> 01:21:18.120
that are exclusively apple.

1311
01:21:18.121 --> 01:21:21.720
May I add and park themselves in a booth for three hours?

1312
01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:23.310
You're going to get a coffee.

1313
01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:27.360
You have to stump stumbled through some college kids project than stand in the

1314
01:21:27.361 --> 01:21:30.120
longest line known demand.
All the while listening,

1315
01:21:30.121 --> 01:21:33.690
some mellow hippie with a beard playing his acoustic guitar.

1316
01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:36.330
Is it just me or these places stink?

1317
01:21:38.570 --> 01:21:42.960
Um,
I,
I think they do stink.
You know,
I just heard some laughter downstairs.

1318
01:21:42.961 --> 01:21:45.720
I wonder if they're actually listening to the podcast or they're laughing at how

1319
01:21:45.721 --> 01:21:50.100
unfunny this shit is.
Um,
and then I have one here,
underrated Seahawks fans.

1320
01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:54.330
I got a whole new fucking respect for those people to chair on that God awful

1321
01:21:54.331 --> 01:21:55.470
fucking performance.

1322
01:21:55.740 --> 01:22:00.270
They hung in there right to the fucking end and a lot of them were pissed at the

1323
01:22:00.271 --> 01:22:03.600
end of the game when with like a minute left,
they just took a knee.

1324
01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:06.180
You know for the last two or three fucking plays,

1325
01:22:06.181 --> 01:22:08.700
even though you're down by 20 points,
can you go down swinging?

1326
01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:13.860
I'll tell you that's that Pete Carroll ball standing up there and his fucking

1327
01:22:13.861 --> 01:22:17.400
Docker's.
Huh?
That fucking that.

1328
01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:21.750
You know what he's like?
He's like in the coach's witness protection program.

1329
01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:26.490
That's kind of like what he did.
It's like the shit hit the fan.
He's Henry Hill.

1330
01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:30.330
He's the Henry Hill and Mike Paul Versey.
He's Henry Hill.
He's dude.

1331
01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:34.440
He's the Henry Hale.
A fucking coaches.
Look at his contagious now.

1332
01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:36.990
He really is though.

1333
01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:42.690
He got all the glory at USC and then the second the shit he told Sanchez,

1334
01:22:42.691 --> 01:22:46.170
he left too early and made all this big fucking speech and then the second the

1335
01:22:46.171 --> 01:22:49.470
shit went down and people start talking about Reggie Bush and all this other

1336
01:22:49.471 --> 01:22:51.870
bullshit.
He just fucking skips town.

1337
01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:57.720
Has he even commented on it or did he pull that bullshit where they just look,

1338
01:22:57.930 --> 01:22:59.610
I'm here to coach the Seattle Seahawks.

1339
01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:03.270
If you have some Seattle Seahawks questions,
I'll be happy to answer those.

1340
01:23:03.450 --> 01:23:08.120
Anything else?
I'm not answering.
That is all in the past,

1341
01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:12.860
but blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Did he do that bull shit,
son of a bitch?

1342
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:17.030
Oh big but hope he fucking flames out and it has nothing to do with Seahawks

1343
01:23:17.031 --> 01:23:17.330
fans.

1344
01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:22.130
I hope he flames out in Seattle and then he goes back with his tail between his

1345
01:23:22.131 --> 01:23:26.210
legs.
Right.
It goes back to the college coaching level.

1346
01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:29.810
He'll probably get a coaching job in the sec.
Right.

1347
01:23:30.150 --> 01:23:33.810
And we all know that the SEC has the best fucking teams.

1348
01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:37.500
It's got the bets coaching and it's got the best players and I don't think that

1349
01:23:37.501 --> 01:23:40.170
he can fucking stand up to the fucking sec conference.

1350
01:23:40.171 --> 01:23:44.800
He was out there in the PAC 10 bunch of God damn pansies out there other than

1351
01:23:44.801 --> 01:23:48.250
Jim Har bar over.
Fuck you say his name,
Captain Comeback there.

1352
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:54.850
That fucking guy can coach.
There's a guy who should go to the pros.
Pete Carroll,

1353
01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:56.740
when you make a good play,
he goes,

1354
01:23:56.910 --> 01:23:58.140
<v 7>Woo.</v>

1355
01:23:58.490 --> 01:24:02.540
<v 6>You ever seen that?
Like fucking ric flair.
But it's not funny.
I remember that.</v>

1356
01:24:02.541 --> 01:24:04.660
I haven't,
does he still do that shit?
I remember that back when he said,

1357
01:24:04.690 --> 01:24:08.530
coach the Patriots,
they score a touchdown.
They cut to him on the sidelines.

1358
01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:10.870
You know,
all the fat fuck defensive coordinators are like,

1359
01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:14.020
like they just murdered somebody got that look,

1360
01:24:14.021 --> 01:24:15.890
a rage on their face at the play work.

1361
01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:18.520
And Pete would be in the middle with his hand straight up in the air and just go

1362
01:24:18.521 --> 01:24:18.730
on,
right.

1363
01:24:18.730 --> 01:24:20.060
<v 7>Woo.</v>

1364
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:24.870
<v 6>And I was just like,
this guy's a pussy.
And then he went to the,</v>

1365
01:24:24.871 --> 01:24:28.200
you went to the fucking,
uh,
Trojans.
And I was like,
all right,
maybe I was wrong.

1366
01:24:28.410 --> 01:24:31.710
Maybe I was wrong about this guy.
It turns out I was right.

1367
01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:36.410
Go back down to the college level with your fucking dockers.

1368
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:41.730
You fucking Richie Cunningham
coming out there,

1369
01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:46.930
you know,
dress like you're going to host an am radio show.

1370
01:24:48.130 --> 01:24:52.050
That's it.
That's how you fucking lead your team to battle.

1371
01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:55.930
I can understand if you're a fat fuck like Rex Ryan,

1372
01:24:55.931 --> 01:24:59.020
he had to wear those soccer moms stretchy pants.
I don't understand that shit.

1373
01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:02.850
I don't understand that shit.
A second.
Jared shape.
Pete Carroll.

1374
01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:04.380
What the fuck are,

1375
01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:06.570
you know something I even know what kind of pants coaches were,

1376
01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:10.620
but I know they're not dose.
What are you going to a fucking sock hop?

1377
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:15.230
Oh my God.
You know,
to have money on that fucking guy.

1378
01:25:15.231 --> 01:25:18.380
If they should just show me the pants that they're coaching staff was going to

1379
01:25:18.381 --> 01:25:23.120
fucking where I would've put money on the chiefs who fucked me when they played

1380
01:25:23.121 --> 01:25:25.820
the bills.
How's kitten?
Who?
I don't know how to gamble.

1381
01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:29.630
Thank God Paul Versey doesn't either.
I'm actually still two games ahead of them.

1382
01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:33.770
I'm only saying that because I know he's listening to this shit at this point.

1383
01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:36.530
Um,
all right,
Paul Versey by the way.

1384
01:25:36.531 --> 01:25:41.420
Absolutely fucking destroyed growing by leaps and bounds.
You know,

1385
01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:44.600
he's jumped out of the little standup nest.
He's flapping his wings.

1386
01:25:44.601 --> 01:25:47.970
He didn't hit the ground.
I think this one's going to make it,
you know,

1387
01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:51.510
you know comedians are,
when we start off,
you ever see those things when like a,

1388
01:25:51.530 --> 01:25:53.860
the little turtles hatch,
you ever see them on the,

1389
01:25:53.861 --> 01:25:58.250
on the discovery channel and then you,
they start fucking going down the beach.

1390
01:25:58.251 --> 01:26:02.570
Those cute little turtles and those fucking birds come in and swoop up like 90%

1391
01:26:02.571 --> 01:26:07.230
of them and only 2% make it out to the water.
Right.
Okay.

1392
01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:09.970
That's where [inaudible] is right now.
He's not in the water.

1393
01:26:09.971 --> 01:26:12.010
He's not on the beach.
It's getting a little wet

1394
01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:15.820
and you want the birds are,

1395
01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:18.190
those are the broads in your life that don't support yet.

1396
01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:19.093
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

1397
01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:25.540
<v 6>Just fucking scoopy up in your fucking dreams and they fly away with you and</v>

1398
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:30.590
hate your fucking soul.
Bill.
Do you have anything positive to say about women?

1399
01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:36.500
Um,
yes.
Yes I do.
Yes I do.

1400
01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:41.620
I sat next to a pretty lady on the plane yesterday,
you know,

1401
01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:46.860
just a beautiful girl.
Cleavage half a titty.
Okay.

1402
01:26:47.070 --> 01:26:49.290
But a nice teddy,
you know what I mean?
Not Obnoxious,

1403
01:26:50.430 --> 01:26:54.120
nice healthy BEACOPP just sitting there just made you,
you know?

1404
01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:58.420
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just something nice to look at during the turbulence.
Like,
you know,

1405
01:26:58.421 --> 01:26:59.960
it's not all bad.
Okay.

1406
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:03.850
Fact that this plane is probably going to crash and because it's a jet,

1407
01:27:03.851 --> 01:27:05.800
when the engine's cut out,
you can't even glide.

1408
01:27:06.130 --> 01:27:09.910
Is tendencies actually to just turn over and I'm actually be hanging from my

1409
01:27:09.911 --> 01:27:13.260
fucking seat belt,
you know?
Yeah.

1410
01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:17.570
There's some fucking free peanuts stuck to my face.
If we're pulling four g's,

1411
01:27:17.571 --> 01:27:21.250
going back to mother earth,
you know,
if I have the neck muscles,

1412
01:27:21.251 --> 01:27:26.080
maybe I can glance over at that cleavage right before we fucking enter the

1413
01:27:26.081 --> 01:27:29.850
fucking ground.
Jesus Christ bill.
Okay.
Um,
you know what I'm doing?
I'm,
I,

1414
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:33.830
I'm not even listening to what the fuck I'm saying.
Oh,
you know,
it was great.

1415
01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:34.753
Was uh,

1416
01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:38.480
we actually got hooked up with tickets while we were supposed to be hooked up

1417
01:27:38.481 --> 01:27:43.070
with tickets to the Seattle game.
You know,
it's just one of those things.

1418
01:27:43.071 --> 01:27:46.580
You have to have a friend who just says,
Oh yeah,
dude,
I can fucking hook you up.

1419
01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:50.420
I guy got the tickets,
don't you worry about it.
Right.

1420
01:27:50.421 --> 01:27:54.560
And then you show up and they're not there and you just realize that the guys

1421
01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:59.060
all talk,
I'm just fucking,
I could just in case he's listening,

1422
01:27:59.090 --> 01:28:01.280
but just fucking around.
We had a good time,

1423
01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:05.120
buddy of ours hooked us up with tickets and uh,
they,
I guess they fucked up,

1424
01:28:05.710 --> 01:28:10.440
you know,
at the front office.
They're in Seattle.
You know what it was.

1425
01:28:10.441 --> 01:28:13.620
They were too busy laughing at Pete Carroll and they're fucking Goddamn Chino's

1426
01:28:13.650 --> 01:28:17.550
as they walked down the down the fucking hall that they actually got,

1427
01:28:17.551 --> 01:28:20.870
they got us two tickets for next week.
Hey,
you know what,

1428
01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:26.710
I dunno if I should do this,
but there's two tickets waiting under my name.

1429
01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:29.930
Uh,

you'd need an ID.

1430
01:28:30.050 --> 01:28:32.900
There's two tickets waiting under my name for next week.

1435

1437
01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:56.270
This whole podcast has gone off the fucking Ralph 52 minutes in.

1438

1442
01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:16.470

I can't scroll and,
and talk at the same time.

1453
01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:06.660
Airbag prank old man.

Seattle DVD order advice.

1455
01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:13.200
Let's look at the Seattle DVD order cause I thought I asked for three.

1456
01:30:14.810 --> 01:30:18.870
I have confirmed the tracking Deni damp.
The third,

Okay.
You know what?
Fuck it.

1458
01:30:23.101 --> 01:30:27.180
That's the podcast for this week.
God bless all of you.
Thanks for listening.

1459
01:30:27.181 --> 01:30:30.810
I thought I had an advice one here.
Uh,

1460
01:30:30.811 --> 01:30:34.440
I hope you guys all had a really nice thanksgiving.
Ameri thanksgiving.

1461
01:30:34.650 --> 01:30:37.320
I hope you have a merry Christmas.
You get to start your shopping.

1462
01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:40.320
That's something I could talk about.
I haven't started my shopping yet.

1463
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:44.940
I'm at that weird age where,
uh,
you know,

1464
01:30:44.941 --> 01:30:47.760
I don't have any fucking kids so I don't have to do that.

1465
01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:52.200
All my friends are too fucking old.
What am I going to buy them,
you know,

1466
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:57.360
worth the Cologne and new shirt age.
Uh,

1467
01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:01.620
you know,
everyone in my family has their own fucking lives.
They have their own.

1468
01:31:01.621 --> 01:31:03.480
So my overheads really not that high.

1469
01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:09.270
All you gotta do is just buy something for my girl and I'm done and I'm done.

1470
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:14.430
You know what?
You don't actually,
I'm thinking of getting her is uh,

1471
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:20.000
I was driving by Arby's the other night and I saw on underneath the sign that

1472
01:31:20.401 --> 01:31:24.660
they have these Christmas gift packs and a,
it's this booklet.

1473
01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:27.550
It's really cool because they have like everything,

1474
01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:31.680
like coupons for everything on their menu at a discount because a,

1475
01:31:31.681 --> 01:31:35.160
you know what,
if she doesn't want one of those awful roast beef sandwiches,

1476
01:31:35.161 --> 01:31:38.490
maybe she just wanted to go,
go in there and get the fucking,
the uh,

1477
01:31:38.491 --> 01:31:39.990
the onion rings.
You know?

1478
01:31:41.610 --> 01:31:46.610
Wouldn't it be awesome to do that just as a fuck you to the,

1479
01:31:46.621 --> 01:31:51.030
to the pressure of,
of,
of getting something nice for the woman in your life.

1480
01:31:51.031 --> 01:31:55.650
It just,
one year you just went out and just bought her a gift like that.

1481
01:31:57.950 --> 01:32:01.390
How do you think your would read what you can't go that you can't call that low

1482
01:32:01.391 --> 01:32:05.140
cause that's like insulting.
You can't get her a fucking coupon.
But you know,

1483
01:32:05.141 --> 01:32:08.200
it gets to the point like how much fucking money do I got to spend on you?

1484
01:32:09.650 --> 01:32:14.420
You know,
what have you bought her like a really nice bathrobe,
you know,

1485
01:32:14.421 --> 01:32:17.150
that's something she can wear every day when she gets out of the shower.

1486
01:32:17.151 --> 01:32:20.750
Really Nice and comfy and you give it to her and she thinks like,
Ooh,

1487
01:32:20.930 --> 01:32:25.280
this is just one of the buildup gifts.
And it's like no,
that,
that is the gift.

1488
01:32:25.310 --> 01:32:29.640
That is the one,
there it is.
Yeah.

1489
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:31.380
Barry Christmas,

1490
01:32:32.730 --> 01:32:37.170
you know that it will be a great thing just to,
you know,
that's what I know.

1491
01:32:37.171 --> 01:32:39.660
Something that's a great idea.
If you actually got us some really nice,

1492
01:32:39.661 --> 01:32:42.780
do something like that,
just act like this.
No other gifts.

1493
01:32:42.781 --> 01:32:47.220
And then just watch her stewing and figuring out how to play it,

1494
01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:51.160
you know,
because she's mad at you.
All right.

1495
01:32:51.161 --> 01:32:55.070
Cause you didn't get her something good enough,
but she has to play it right.

1496
01:32:55.071 --> 01:32:58.910
Because if she flips out too much,
she's going to look selfish,
you know,

1497
01:32:59.060 --> 01:33:01.520
because she,
cause she has to be honestly sitting there thinking like,

1498
01:33:01.521 --> 01:33:05.240
well wait a minute,
what if he really thought that this is enough?
You know,

1499
01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:09.500
how rude of it would it be for me to be giving you shit?

1500
01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:14.320
Oh,
wait a minute.
Wow.
I just had a flashback.

1501
01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:22.080
I just had a flash one time.
Oh my God.
One time.

1502
01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:27.110
One of my first girlfriends.
Right.
I grew up with all brothers.
Right.

1503
01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:31.210
I don't mean black people,
I mean that,
uh,
siblings and uh,

1504
01:33:32.290 --> 01:33:35.800
and I had a,
so I didn't know shit about women,
you know,

1505
01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:38.560
and a lot of you who are listening,
it's probably still think I don't.

1506
01:33:38.890 --> 01:33:43.270
So when he was my first girlfriend,
I went to buy her something for her birthday.

1507
01:33:43.271 --> 01:33:47.650
What the fuck did I get her?
I was on the road and I was like,
no.

1508
01:33:47.651 --> 01:33:50.100
So I was on the road.
It's already a comedian.
This wasn't my first Mike,

1509
01:33:51.670 --> 01:33:56.480
this is my second serious girlfriend.
I was like 25 years old,
24,

1510
01:33:56.481 --> 01:34:01.481
25 and that was in the mall and I bought her this shirt.

1511
01:34:02.210 --> 01:34:05.540
Was there a birthday?
And I swear to God,
I think it was one of those,
you know,

1512
01:34:05.541 --> 01:34:09.500
those polo style shirts.
I bought her one of those and it was like striped.

1513
01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:14.620
I got a two of them and I wrapped him up and she was all excited.

1514
01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:19.190
She was just complete fucking psycho that I was dating.
As I told you before,

1515
01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:22.610
you know what the deal is when somebody dating is psycho and you're sitting

1516
01:34:22.611 --> 01:34:24.680
there going,
why are they dating this fucking person?

1517
01:34:24.681 --> 01:34:28.890
You know why all psychos are good in bed.

1518
01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:33.070
At least everyone that I ever met,
not only the good in bed,

1519
01:34:33.190 --> 01:34:36.160
they're fucking unbelievable in bed.
All right?

1520
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:40.320
So I'm sitting there like I,
you know,

1521
01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:44.030
I don't know why I didn't I just ask a woman,
just get help me out here.

1522
01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:47.810
But I basically bought or what I would have bought my older brother.

1523
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:54.590
So,
and this is the thing,
I hadn't had a girlfriend a couple of fucking years,

1524
01:34:55.170 --> 01:34:58.760
uh,
you know,
just one of periods where I was just focusing on,

1525
01:34:58.761 --> 01:35:02.740
on becoming a comedian.
And I don't even think I was really even,
whoa.

1526
01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:07.640
I went through a fucking dry spell like an 18th month fucking not hooking up

1527
01:35:07.641 --> 01:35:11.950
nothing.
So this girl says,
psycho comes into my life.
So I buy,

1528
01:35:11.951 --> 01:35:16.340
are these two fucking izod looking shirts that,
you know,

1529
01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:22.550
a married father with three with three fucking kids would be pissed if he got

1530
01:35:22.551 --> 01:35:24.800
there.
And I gave it to this disco was fucking hot too,
right.

1531
01:35:24.801 --> 01:35:28.350
And I gave it to her and she's all excited and it professionally wrap.

1532
01:35:28.351 --> 01:35:31.610
That's the one thing I did.
So she's thinking it's going to be something nice.

1533
01:35:31.611 --> 01:35:35.920
And she goes and she fucking unwraps the stamp thing and uh,

1534
01:35:38.210 --> 01:35:40.250
she opened it up and she just like,

1535
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:45.560
and I was standing up and I was so fucking nervous and she just goes like,
what?

1536
01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:51.080
She's like,
what,
what,
what is this,
what you'd be bought me this,
this.

1537
01:35:51.081 --> 01:35:53.630
And she starts holding upon this and she's like,
this is stupid.

1538
01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:56.990
She kind of like throw it down.
I can't remember what the fuck she said.

1539
01:35:57.170 --> 01:36:02.170
All I remembered was by the end of it I was sitting and she was standing and she

1540
01:36:02.511 --> 01:36:05.090
was fucking like,
I was getting scolded like a child.

1541
01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.610
You're like your first girlfriend when your first relationship or whatever.

1542
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.580
You just think of the dumb shit that you did.
It's like my second one,

1543
01:36:10.581 --> 01:36:12.830
but I'm such a moron.
I had to learn this shit over again.

1544
01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:17.980
I was just sitting there getting fucking scolded for like 10 minutes about this

1545
01:36:18.921 --> 01:36:22.610
awful fucking,
admittedly it was awful.
But what the fuck?

1546
01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:27.650
You know what kind of a fucking cunt would do that?

1547
01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:30.710
I don't have a date and I'm like fucking two months.
But she,

1548
01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:35.890
I sat there like this sad kid getting scolded and it was one of those things

1549
01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:41.740
where I w the only reason why I sat there was cause I was so embarrassed and I

1550
01:36:41.991 --> 01:36:45.080
didn't have a lot of experience with women and all I wanted to do,

1551
01:36:45.081 --> 01:36:46.310
I wanted to crawl out of there.

1552
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:49.610
It felt like the way it felt the first time I bombed doing jokes,

1553
01:36:49.611 --> 01:36:50.630
that's how bad it felt.

1554
01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:56.080
And then as she got to the end of her 10 minute fucking tirade about how bad

1555
01:36:57.441 --> 01:36:58.640
this fucking gift was,

1556
01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:03.820
that's when I started getting my feet underneath me where finally the shame and

1557
01:37:06.351 --> 01:37:11.270
the embarrassment had gone away because she just gave me shit for so long that I

1558
01:37:11.271 --> 01:37:14.210
was actually able to regroup and I was like,
wait a minute.

1559
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:17.330
I don't even think I yelled at her.

1560
01:37:17.570 --> 01:37:20.120
I just remembered that switch in my head just went,
you know what?

1561
01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:24.300
Fuck this person next.
And uh,

1562
01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:27.860
later on that night she actually called me up and apologize.
It's just like,
yeah,

1563
01:37:27.861 --> 01:37:31.560
listen.
Um,
I,

1564
01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:36.220
I probably shouldn't have said that and I was totally passive aggressive.
No,
no,

1565
01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:37.730
it's fine.
No,
it's cool.
You know,

1566
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:39.830
you know back then when you don't know how to get out of a relationship,

1567
01:37:39.890 --> 01:37:43.980
I know it's too,
that's cool.
So you want to come see me tonight?
Oh,

1568
01:37:43.981 --> 01:37:48.410
actually I got,
oh whoa.
I got up,
fixed the toilet,
uh,

1569
01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:50.040
fucking clean off the stove.
Uh,

1570
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:54.850
my brother's coming to town and gave her like every fucking excuse and I,
uh,

1571
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:59.280
okay.
I basically,
in a coward way,
just sort of back my way out of that.

1572
01:37:59.290 --> 01:38:02.780
Has that ever happened?
Oh No.
Wait.
I remember how I remember how I got out of it,

1573
01:38:02.781 --> 01:38:06.650
but I can't tell you cause it's fucking horrific and some stuff is just too

1574
01:38:06.651 --> 01:38:09.590
personal and I'm gonna leave you at that and they'll leave you fucking hanging.

1575
01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:13.570
Fuck you.
It's an hour in one minutes into this podcast,
right?
It.

1576
01:38:13.571 --> 01:38:15.310
Was this one loud enough for you?
I hope it was.

1577
01:38:15.311 --> 01:38:16.870
Now people are going to say it was too fucking loud.

1578

01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:48.400
So for all you people out here asking me when the fuck I'm going to be in Bray

1602
01:39:48.401 --> 01:39:51.350
California,

1604
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:57.870
Then I'm all my Christmas break where I stare at my bulls.
Um,

1605
01:39:59.310 --> 01:40:00.420

1606
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:05.990
I'm doing the Gada in Atlantic City and uh,
we,

1607
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.980
we sold out that show in 30 hours.

1608
01:40:07.981 --> 01:40:10.770
Hopefully they're going to add a second show would be great if you guys called

1609
01:40:10.771 --> 01:40:15.240
up and asked them to add a second show.
And then they could,

1612
01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:25.330
How the fuck do you not add a second show?
