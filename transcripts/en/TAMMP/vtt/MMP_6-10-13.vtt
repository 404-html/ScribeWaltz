1
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.260
Okay.

2
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.310
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:06.830
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday Day,

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.730
<v 2>June 10th,</v>

5
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.340
2013 happy birthday to me.

6
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.350
Happy Birthday to me.
Happy Birthday.

7
00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.640
You ran.

8
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.040
<v 1>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.300
<v 0>okay.</v>

10
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.050
<v 2>Happy Birthday to me.</v>

11
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.340
<v 3>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.690
<v 1>Yeah.
What's going on?
Oh,
sorry.
Just yelled there.
I'm excited.</v>

13
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:37.800
This is the first time I've been doing,
I've been doing this podcast

14
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.420
for six years and not once has the part I have the podcasting God's ever graced,

15
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:47.740
meet with the podcasts.

16
00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:52.290
That actually fell on my birthday and I'm going to go out on a limb here and I'm

17
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:57.291
going to say despite the fact that there were over 7,458 podcasts on my street

18
00:00:58.471 --> 00:00:59.304
alone,

19
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.850
I that I am the first podcaster to have a host of fucking podcast on his

20
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:06.924
birthday.

21
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.740
<v 0>I'm putting that out there.
All right.</v>

22
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.350
<v 1>You can go with Wikipedia,
Google it,</v>

23
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:16.110
or do whatever the fuck you want to do with it.
I'm telling you,

24
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:17.580
I'm the first one who ever did it.

25
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.450
These other guys and women who said that they did it,
they're just talking.

26
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.640
All right.
That's just talk over there.
I'm actually fucking doing it.

27
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.573
<v 0>MMM.</v>

28
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.820
<v 1>So I don't want you to thinking right now you like,
wow,
bill,
it's your birthday.</v>

29
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.410
First question everybody asks,
how old are you now?

30
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.090
I'm 45

31
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.400
let me tell you something about the fives for all you youngsters out there.

32
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.290
It's not the ones,
it's not the tools.
It's not the sevens.

33
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.840
It's the fives.
The fives get ya.

34
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.030
<v 0>You know what I mean?
25</v>

35
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.910
<v 1>and now 24 kinds of scares,
but 25 fuck.</v>

36
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.710
Here we go.
Slide near the 30 you know that's when you're,

37
00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:10.210
you're right on top of the fence there,
right?
The fucking Berlin Wall.
You know?

38
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.410
Which way am I going to fall?
Free side or the countryside,

39
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.193
<v 0>right?</v>

40
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.710
<v 1>Aging is like,
it's like reverse progress.
So you would actually,</v>

41
00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:26.360
when you get to the fives,
you fall back over into fucking a post World War II.

42
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.860
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

43
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.580
<v 1>sure.
Well,
I guess from now until forever,
it's going to be post World War II.</v>

44
00:02:31.581 --> 00:02:33.830
Bill,
what do you know what the fuck I'm talking about?

45
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.580
Whenever they put up that God damn wall,
what did they put it up?

46
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.500
They put it up during a Kennedy.
Oh was it 1948.
Oh,
is that Israel?

47
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.390
I don't fucking remember.
Um,
35 was a bitch.

48
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.300
They all suck.
I'm not going to lie to you if they all suck,

49
00:02:50.301 --> 00:02:53.410
but 35 was a bitch and now 45,

50
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.860
five I'm sliding into 50.
Does that even make sense?

51
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.700
I'm still doing pull ups.

52
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.210
How can I be 45 what?
I'm still doing polyps.
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

53
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.690
Cause when I was a kid,
old people,
nobody,
actually,

54
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.400
nobody worked out when I was a kid.

55
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.910
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

56
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.530
<v 1>nobody's strapped.
Like I've never seen.</v>

57
00:03:15.531 --> 00:03:18.980
My Dad tried to touch his toes my entire fucking life.

58
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.840
I never seen him do a jumping jack.
I never saw any of his friends.

59
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.240
None of them.
They just rolled out of bed,
you know,

60
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.430
sat on the side of the bed for a second going,
ha ha.

61
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.820
And then they get up,
brush your teeth,
take a shower,
put on some clothes,

62
00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:44.330
have bacon and eggs and go out to work,
you know,

63
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.270
like fucking come home.

64
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

65
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.660
<v 1>They walked through the door and be like,
all right,
all right,
cool.</v>

66
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.030
And everybody would shut the fuck up.

67
00:03:56.031 --> 00:04:00.500
And then they'd sit down and they eat their fucking beef stew and then they go

68
00:04:00.501 --> 00:04:02.810
in the living room and they'd sit down in their chair.
I had

69
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.700
fucking tired.
What,
what'd you do today,

70
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.210
Billy?
Listen,
I'm tired.
Okay.
All right.
Just go to your room.

71
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.980
You know,

72
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.720
and then they'd watch a little bit TV right now within two hours they have

73
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.790
fucking head was just bad.

74
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.870
All right.
And that was that day.
There was no working out whatsoever.

75
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.070
There was maybe like two people who could do still do pull ups at 45 when I was

76
00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:39.210
a kid and it was like Johnny Weissmuller and uh,

77
00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:40.380
that guy who did the juicer,

78
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.280
who used to dress like Arthur funds a rally when he worked on cars on happy
days.

79
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.680
I want to three o'clock.
Um,
hey,
do you know stuff?
Did I tell you this?
I actually,

80
00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:51.780
uh,
I can't remember it cause I did that,

81
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.160
that quick podcast in middle of the week I did an episode of a Nick Kroll show.

82
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.200
And I got to work with Ron Howard's dad and he was,

83
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.750
yeah,
he was in cool hand Luke.

84
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.770
And he actually told me stories about being in the,
uh,

85
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.320
I guess he's in,
he had a small role and he's in the last scene.

86
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.490
We're cool hand Luke.
Um,
for those of you who haven't seen it yet,

87
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.600
spoiler alert.
All right.
Sticky rice

88
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.980
<v 4>fingers in your ears and go</v>

89
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.760
<v 1>for the next fucking 10 seconds.
All right.</v>

90
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.160
Because I don't want to hear your shit.
Um,

91
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.610
and at the end of the movie when cool hand Luke gets shot in the church,
uh,

92
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.460
he's part of the cops,
you know,
that had taken them out.

93
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.240
And then that what we've got here,
that guy says no,
we'll take them from here.

94
00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:47.010
He's in that scene.
Um,
absolutely legendary.

95
00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:51.150
And he said they shot it up in Bakersfield,
California.
So there you go.

96
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.680
And the guy was hilarious.

97
00:05:52.681 --> 00:05:57.080
I think it was like 85 years old improv and still sharp as hell.
Um,

98
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.200
it was awesome.
Great,
great guy.

99
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.180
So thanks to a crawl show in Nick Kroll.
Forget me on,
cause if he didn't,

100
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.530
I wouldn't have had that experience.

101
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:09.740
And please watch the Kroll show cause I think that dude's a fucking genius.

102
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.340
They go,
there's my plug for the look of that on my birthday.

103
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.690
Hyping somebody else's project.
You know what that is it right.

104
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.920
That isn't right at all.
It's very generous.
Why being a martyr bill,
Huh?

105
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.670
Don't cry for me.
Fucking Billy.
Um,
I'm going to,

106
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:32.150
I'm going to hype something right now.
Hey Bill,
nobody stopping you.

107
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.830
It's just stupid podcasts.
I'll right
fucking grumpy cunt.

108
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.473
Um,

109
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.310
tickets for the Billy red state tour are now on sale,
uh,

110
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.950
for a number of the venues.
Uh,
specifically,
uh,
my first two dates,

111
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.230
one in Boise,
Idaho,
and the other one in Bozeman.
Hope I'm saying that right.

112
00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:58.430
Montana,
the last state in the union that I've never been to.

113
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.160
Um,
and here's the deal.
You know,
a lot of east coast comics,

114
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:05.000
like myself,

115
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.990
we never traveled the states unless we're doing some college gig or some shit,

116
00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:10.400
but we usually don't come through here.

117
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.580
So it would be great if you guys gave me some wonderful stories to tell all my

118
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:21.260
fucking hilarious comedian friends about where to go to play,

119
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.540
you know,
Hi Montana.

120
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.830
You want the sensation,
the teen idol cessation,

121
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.940
Joe Fucking Derosa to grace big sky country within goddammit,

122
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.990
sell a pair,
your wrangler jeans,
get off the Meth,
whatever.

123
00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:45.500
You got to fucking do it.
Come down to my shop.
I'm just fucking with you guys.

124
00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:47.360
I'm,
I'm just hoping that I'm going to sell tickets out there.

125
00:07:47.361 --> 00:07:49.790
What it really is and I'm nervous that I'm not going to,

126
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:53.440
which is why I'm already trying to guilt you guys into the fact that I'm going

127
00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:57.920
to spread rumors that you guys don't like East Coast comics even though I'm a

128
00:07:57.921 --> 00:08:02.390
Hollywood sell out out here.
Um,
so anyways,
that's the deal.

129
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:07.280
The Billy red state tour is coming to a state near you,
make stops in Idaho,

130
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.930
Montana,
South Dakota,
obscure places in Colorado.

131
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.670
I don't have the dates in front of me,
Kansas,
Oklahoma,

132
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.370
and uh,
El Paso,
Texas is where it wraps up.
And uh,

133
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:23.150
we'd love to see you.

134
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:27.040
I'm working on a Badass tee shirt that I'm going to be selling.
Um,

135
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:31.160
it's selling only on the,
on the red red state tour and a,
and that's it.

136
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.500
All right,
there you go.
I'm done plugging the shit.

137
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:38.530
So let's get onto this movie that I wanted to see until I saw the rating.

138
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:43.100
And now it's fucking annoying.
The shit out of me is,
uh,
you know,

139
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.940
it's this summer season.
You know,

140
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.180
there's actually a wonderful movie coming up called the heat that a certain

141
00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:53.360
someone might be in.
If you watch the,
uh,
the trailer,

142
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.460
the heat starring Sandra Bullock and Muscle Melissa McCarthy,

143
00:08:56.461 --> 00:09:00.570
if you guys could hook me up and go buy a movie ticket to that one,
uh,

144
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:03.720
that would be tremendous.
And,
uh,
you know,

145
00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.550
be something that I would enjoy.

146
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

147
00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.490
<v 1>Oh Shit.
Is it any wonder why they don't have me do press for anything?</v>

148
00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:20.890
Where the Fuck Brad Pitt?
I'm looking this up right now.
Or Z.

149
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.420
What is the name of this fucking movie?

150
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:23.580
<v 0>Okay.</v>

151
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.780
<v 1>World War Z.
Oh,
there we go.
Now here's a fucking movie.
Here's a guy.</v>

152
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.420
There's a fucking movie that I wanted to see.

153
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:31.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

154
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.540
<v 1>Brad Pitt,
World War Z,
and to the fucking world,
right?</v>

155
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

156
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:39.020
<v 1>The zombies.</v>

157
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.600
This she shit the world as we know it will not exist in,

158
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.010
I don't know how many days.
One of the great fucking lines,

159
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:50.450
the kind of line that makes me want to get off my fucking couch,
you know,

160
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.190
put on my slippers.

161
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.520
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

162
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.850
<v 1>Put on a smoking jacket and go down to the local movie theater and taking a</v>

163
00:09:56.851 --> 00:09:59.010
picture.
Right?
And then at the end of it,

164
00:09:59.011 --> 00:10:01.500
if they show everybody running for their fucking lives,

165
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.330
it's the end of the God damn world.

166
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:04.900
<v 0>Okay.</v>

167
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.720
<v 1>World War z.
What?
What?
What did,
I don't even know what that is.</v>

168
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.410
It was World War One.
World War Two.
They said,

169
00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:13.540
fuck all the numbers right through infinity.

170
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.970
Fuck the entire alphabet all the way to the last letter.
World War Z.
I'm a,

171
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:21.130
I'm fucking,
I'm there.
I got to see this shit.
And then in the end,

172
00:10:21.131 --> 00:10:26.080
what do they do to me?
Rated PG 13 oh,

173
00:10:26.081 --> 00:10:29.820
go fuck yourself.
All right.

174
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.480
And that's not a go fuck yourself to Brad Pitt or the director or anybody else

175
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.430
that I'm trying not to burn a bridge with.

176
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:40.080
It's a fuck you to the conch.

177
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.800
I know that that was a rated r movie.
In fact,

178
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:46.320
I've heard that it was and they fucking took the knees out of it and they

179
00:10:46.321 --> 00:10:50.300
fucking drag it down and to PG 13 all right,

180
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.170
I don't give a fuck who you are.

181
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.290
If the world is ending and you're getting chased by zombies,

182
00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.120
you're not running around going,
oh golly gee,
oh heck crime.

183
00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:04.800
And he's Oh,
Jimminy cricket.
And once every 10 minutes you go,
ah,

184
00:11:04.801 --> 00:11:05.670
Shit.

185
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:06.923
<v 0>Okay.</v>

186
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.350
<v 1>You know
you don't.</v>

187
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.140
That's the end of the world was zombies from the beginning.

188
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.010
Once they discover these zombies to the end of that movie where they hopefully

189
00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:22.120
solve the problem,
should be a bunch of people.
Wait,

190
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.580
eight 85% of the people going,
fuck what the fuck?

191
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.750
And then the other 50% should be grabbing them by the shoulders gone for,
I said,

192
00:11:32.751 --> 00:11:36.360
get a fucking all the ESL.
Right.

193
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.600
That should be most of the dialogue in that movie.

194
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.910
But now,
now I don't know why I just said it that way.
Now it's,

195
00:11:44.911 --> 00:11:49.240
it's PG 13.
So what are they going to do?
What,
what,

196
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.080
what's going to happen?
And they're going to slowly,
you know,

197
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.890
have some for why we should not stop using fucking plastic water bottles.

198
00:11:56.891 --> 00:12:01.420
So they get a weave that into the storyline.
You know,
you know,
it's funny,

199
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:05.200
I actually tweeted,
I have to admit that I hang my head in shame,

200
00:12:05.201 --> 00:12:10.060
but I did tweet and I do still consider myself a man even saying that out loud.

201
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:14.500
Say it again,
Bill.
I tweeted,
um,
I said,

202
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:19.000
Zombie movies are rated R Hashtag World War Z,
right?
And most people agreed.

203
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:23.590
So of course this one client goes,
I have to respectfully disagree,

204
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.480
said the success of a,
the walking dead.

205
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.260
That's what he said.

206
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.180
Said the success of the walking dead fucking Twitter.
Heck,

207
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.990
it's just like,
oh,
that,
that's,
that's a great idea.
I see that business model.

208
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:38.950
So let me get this straight.

209
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:44.200
I'm going to spend over a fucking a hundred $150 million of my money making a

210
00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:48.610
Zombie movie and I'm going to make it no more fucking crazier than what people

211
00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:52.180
can sit at home on their couch and watch.
That's what the fuck you telling me.

212
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:56.260
That's that right there.
That's your business model.
That makes sense to you.

213
00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.550
Forget about all the clients who are going to steal the movie anyways,
or just,

214
00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:04.360
man,
I'll just wait a few weeks and then I'll watch it on fucking whatever.
Right?

215
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.360
You want to get them out.
You'll want to get them excited.
Say That,

216
00:13:10.361 --> 00:13:14.190
come down and go see the picture and a big screen.
That's themselves.

217
00:13:14.191 --> 00:13:17.600
Some popcorn.
Sit now with their best gout.
Right?
You're going to make it.

218
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:22.490
You know what?
Why don't you just make,
according to Jim's World War Z,

219
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:24.863
<v 0>nope.</v>

220
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.790
<v 1>No disrespect to Jim or according,</v>

221
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.093
<v 0>right.</v>

222
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.490
<v 1>I'm just saying what?
What the fuck?
What is the purpose?</v>

223
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.930
It's like when you go out to your favorite pizza place.

224
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:39.820
If you could make the pizza just as good at home,

225
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.140
you wouldn't fucking go out there.

226
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.250
Or if someone would just show up to your fucking house and step out of your TV,

227
00:13:45.251 --> 00:13:47.170
go,
here's your fucking pizza.
You're not going,

228
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:54.560
why the fuck would you make a PG 13 Zombie fucking movie?

229
00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.760
Could somebody for the love of fucking God explained that to me?

230
00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.180
They've been doing that lately.
Alright.

231
00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:07.300
Superhero movies should also be rated r unless you're doing one of those Doshi

232
00:14:07.821 --> 00:14:12.020
ones that nobody cares about.
All right?
But all the other ones,

233
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:13.910
Batman,
Captain America,

234
00:14:13.911 --> 00:14:18.911
all that Shit should all be rated r those superheroes are not for kids.

235
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:23.750
Those are for adults who don't know how to fight and want to live through

236
00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.770
somebody else who actually has a six pack.
That's what those movies are for.

237
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:29.383
I feel,

238
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.053
<v 0>you know,</v>

239
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.250
<v 1>then I actually think that I would take it.
I would actually go for,</v>

240
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.440
if I haven't made a fucking superhero movie,
I would go for the NC 17

241
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:41.210
get out me.

242
00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:45.300
If you remember in Spiderman when he's hanging upside down and the fucking girls

243
00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:47.790
kissing him,
right?
That wouldn't be,

244
00:14:47.791 --> 00:14:50.340
he would have been hanging a little bit lower,
if you know what I mean.

245
00:14:50.341 --> 00:14:53.660
He'd still be down,
but he would be hanging a little bit lower.

246
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.550
Come on people do the math.

247
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:56.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

248
00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:01.010
<v 1>Somewhere between 68 and 70 is what I'm talking about.
All right.</v>

249
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.660
That's how that fucking scene would have gone down.
Okay.

250
00:15:04.661 --> 00:15:07.280
And fuck all these critics.
Who would be like,
oh my God,

251
00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:08.570
that's absolutely horrific.

252
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.860
Stan Lynch must be fucking rolling over on his futon cause they never gave him

253
00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:17.170
the money deserve for creating the character.
And I,
I would,
I stand by it.

254
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:19.810
I stand by it.

255
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:25.820
This is the Peter Parker that everyone knew existed,
but no one wanted to see.

256
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.740
You know he'd be hanging upside down just stores soon as fucking spider Dick

257
00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:33.830
right in your mouth.
Okay.
You know why?
Cause he's,

258
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.430
cause he's spider man.

259
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:39.623
<v 0>All right.</v>

260
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.680
<v 1>Half man,
half spider.</v>

261
00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.120
Using the power for good and he still has a day job.

262
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.310
Still has a fucking day job and that great.

263
00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:55.250
We taught what a what a common man.

264
00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.680
He's not like Bruce Wayne walking around at all these fucking eyes wide shut

265
00:16:00.681 --> 00:16:04.130
party.
You know how many Tuxedos does Bruce Wayne.
Okay.

266
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.430
And how did he make his money?
You know,

267
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.610
I know all these comic book people of Losing Their fucking minds cause I don't

268
00:16:10.611 --> 00:16:13.040
know anything about the backstory,
but any of these fucking people,

269
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.760
I don't give a shit.
All right.
How much,
what,
what did he do?

270
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.870
How did he inherit money when both his parents got shot in the alley?
Dad,

271
00:16:20.871 --> 00:16:24.660
they're,
your parents got killed.
Is that what the money's spent it,

272
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.190
he's never working.

273
00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:29.880
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

274
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.960
<v 1>He's never at work in any of those fucking movies.</v>

275
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.860
It's always going over to the mayor's house.
He's a fucking trust fund kid.

276
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:40.140
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

277
00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:44.750
<v 1>Beat a park is still works for the school paper or whatever.
Ah,</v>

278
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.110
working for fucking Jamison,
a guy named after whiskey.

279
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.270
Alright.
Techy guy.
And I liked when he wore the black suit too.

280
00:16:53.271 --> 00:16:56.030
I think that that one look better,
you know,

281
00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.450
and the suits started controlling him.
I didn't like that.

282
00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:04.070
That made Peter Look weak.
All right.
You know,
you know,

283
00:17:04.071 --> 00:17:05.450
I'm in over my fucking head when I'm,

284
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:10.370
I'm talking about God damn superheroes here.
Um,
all right,

285

Everybody.
I like the light.

288
00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:22.580
Doing the shaded ones just makes me feel like the old days,

289
00:17:22.581 --> 00:17:26.030
like when you used to watch baseball and everything was about you fucking balls

290
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.180
or Cologne,
right?
Or Busan,

291
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:35.480
aqua velvet,
old spice.
Put it on your nuts,
right?
All right.

293

Getting a good shave can be a real pain in the aish.

294
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.170
Searching around through 50 different brands.
Matching new blades to old handles.

295
00:17:45.171 --> 00:17:49.410
Bullshit features where your razor doubles as a flashlight.
Vibrator.
Toothpick.

296

20 bucks for a new razor.
It's a complete rip off.

297
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:58.320
I talked to you guys about this.
They have the stupid blades locked behind glass,

298
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.370
right?
Like their bars of gold.
You know,
why are people stealing them?

299
00:18:02.371 --> 00:18:04.030
Cause they're a frigging rip off.
Alright,

300
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.950
frigging you can tell them to read an advertising.
They're even Carson in this,

301
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.560
in the copy here.
So to hell with it,
it's a fucking rip off.

302
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.430
20 bucks for a new razor to hell with that.

346
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:58.930

oh,
here's a question somebody had.
Hey,
Bilbo Fagens.
Now people,

347
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.950
let's try to keep the homophobia down a little bit and he says,

348
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:07.480
I went to see your show in Denmark a couple of years ago or a year.

349
00:21:07.481 --> 00:21:10.120
I don't fucking remember.
Are you going to do some more shows in Europe?

350
00:21:10.121 --> 00:21:13.750
Preferably in Scandinavia.
Thanks.
A why?
Yes.
Yes I am.

351
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.280
I'm going to be coming over to Europe in the beginning of December.

352
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:19.970
<v 6>Okay.</v>

353
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:22.670
<v 1>I'm going to go all Howard Dean here.
We're going to start in Ireland.</v>

354
00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:26.460
We're going to kind of on an angle and,
hey,
no,
we're gonna.
Uh,

355
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.750
I'm gonna Start in Ireland.
I bill,
I haven't looked at the date yet,

356
00:21:29.751 --> 00:21:33.110
but I imagine I'm going to go to all the places that I've been to before and

357
00:21:33.111 --> 00:21:36.950
maybe add another couple of cities,
but I'm going,
I'm hoping to go.
Ireland,

358
00:21:36.951 --> 00:21:40.190
Scotland,
England,
Denmark,
Norway,

359
00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.840
Sweden and Finland again.
And uh,
who knows.

360
00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.630
Maybe I can add something else.
Maybe in a,

361
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:49.470
<v 6>okay,</v>

362
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:50.580
<v 1>where the hell else could I go?</v>

363
00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.670
I know if you get too far south in Europe,
they start to like more,
they,

364
00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:00.380
they're still on that Benny Hill Shit where they want us.
Yeah.
Way.
Bay Bay,
Bay,

365
00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.550
Bay,
Ba to day,
day to day.
They want to see that shit.

366
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:07.050
They're very intellect slapstick and prat falls.
I don't know if that's true.

367
00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.190
I'm not trying to insult anybody in France,
you know,

368
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:15.570
Italy or whatever.
I heard you can get halfway through Germany,

369
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.250
you know.
Oh,
Amsterdam or Rotterdam or some of those places that have been to,

370
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.930
or some other places.
Maybe I could do some standup,

371
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.250
but I'd love to do it and I'm trying to keep up on what's going on over there,

372
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.200
over in Europe.
Wow.
What's going on over in Europe?
Everybody,

373
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:35.830
it's time for a new segment called what's going on in Europe,

374
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.360
delivered by an ignorant American.
Well,
evidently there's floods in Germany.

375
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:41.730
<v 6>Okay.</v>

376
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.760
<v 1>On this river that goes all the way down to the Czech Republic.</v>

377
00:22:44.761 --> 00:22:48.150
And there they were moving people out.
And uh,

378
00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:52.800
that story made me sick to my stomach just having water damage in my house.

379
00:22:52.801 --> 00:22:55.420
I can't imagine an entire fucking river coming through my house.

380
00:22:55.421 --> 00:22:58.650
So my condolences to everybody out there.
Uh,

381
00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:04.260
Vladimir Putin is getting divorced from his fucking wife.
You know,

382
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.050
she doesn't like to be in the spotlight.
You know,

383
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.530
he likes going out there and lifting up little boy shirts and blowing bubbles on

384
00:23:10.531 --> 00:23:14.400
this stomachs in front of the press.
That just to it.
If they've grown apart,

385
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.650
the kids are grown up.
They go in their separate ways.
I think,
um,

386
00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:23.730
I think Latin mayor wants a nice hot piece of ass.
You know,

387
00:23:23.731 --> 00:23:27.270
like in 2008,
they speculated that he was banging some chick.

388
00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:32.040
I'm always going to marry some chick and a,

389
00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.550
and as far as I could tell with my ignorance,
they put that paper out of business

390
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:44.810
and I have to tell you as fucked up as this country's becoming,

391
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.750
it's way better.
You know,

392
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.060
cause you don't have to deal with stuff like that.

393
00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:54.200
Although I am a little disturbed with the Obama going to China to be like,
well,

394
00:23:54.201 --> 00:23:56.360
hey,
how do you censor your,
your fucking,

395
00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:00.470
how do you censor your people that you're supposed to be doing the right thing

396
00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:05.120
for,
you know?
No,
no.
Say,
and there you go.

397
00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.730
And that's what's going on in the world.
I know what's going on.
The word Turkey,

398
00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.560
they have in those protests over there,

399
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.360
and I'll start it off with a bunch of hippies because they were cutting down
the,

400
00:24:14.361 --> 00:24:14.951
uh,
the,

401
00:24:14.951 --> 00:24:18.320
the trees in the park and one to put up a strip mall and all the hippies and

402
00:24:18.321 --> 00:24:22.800
Turkey.
We're like,
hey,
okay,
that's not cool.
Man,

403
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:25.800
it started with that shit and then all of a sudden everybody just snapped.

404
00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:30.480
It was like,
by the way,
you know,
fuck the police and all this other shit.

405
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:35.140
I like you.
But up on that stuff lately I've been going to that Al Jazeera,

406
00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.950
England,
English,
whatever,
which I was saying on the Wednesday,

407
00:24:38.951 --> 00:24:41.740
the special one that I thought that the Al Jazeera and I know a lot of people

408
00:24:41.741 --> 00:24:43.840
listen to it right now.
Like what are you a fucking terrorist?

409
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:48.730
That's what I thought cause low lately I've noticed Al Jazeera has been on like

410
00:24:48.731 --> 00:24:51.340
your TV,
my TV's in like hotel rooms and I'm like,

411
00:24:51.341 --> 00:24:56.320
what the fuck did they got this terrorist channel on here for?
Um,

412
00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.990
and for those you oversee listening to this and laughing.

413
00:24:58.991 --> 00:25:03.110
You have to understand that the only thing that we've seen,
mmm.

414
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:07.010
Unless you seek it out over here is when they would broadcast Americans getting

415
00:25:07.011 --> 00:25:10.660
their heads sought off by,
uh,
you know,

416
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.930
al Qaeda.
That's the only thing we saw.

417
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:16.720
And the way they would frame it would be like,

418
00:25:16.721 --> 00:25:19.300
and they actually tell a vlog channel.

419
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:24.170
So I just assumed that like that was like,
you don't,

420
00:25:24.171 --> 00:25:28.700
like Ted Turner has TNT and TBS,
I thought a Saba bin Ladin with that oil money,

421
00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.030
you know,
that was his t and t like Al Jazeera.

422
00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:40.580
But uh,
she filed it really fucking interesting and it's great to see a,

423
00:25:40.581 --> 00:25:43.490
I don't know,
it's just great to just read about other countries.
It's not,

424
00:25:43.491 --> 00:25:47.640
it's not,
not,
you know,
it's not what you said.
I think it is.

425
00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:51.690
And I'm not saying that they don't trash the u s but it's kind of interesting to

426
00:25:51.691 --> 00:25:55.650
read the criticism,
to hear their perception of what's going on here next.

427
00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.530
Saying that there are 100% right.
Not saying they're a hundred percent raw.

428
00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:02.010
Oh well we get it.
You try to broaden your horizons.

429
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:05.820
Does that mean checking out that and somebody told me also checkout BBC World

430
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.960
and uh,
whatever.
I know they're all full of shit to some extent.

431
00:26:09.961 --> 00:26:14.730
They all have their rangle but it's a,
you know,
you know,
you get enough angles,

432
00:26:14.731 --> 00:26:17.040
this shit,
maybe you could stand in the middle of that shit storm.

433
00:26:17.041 --> 00:26:21.190
I try to make sense of it.
I don't fucking know.
Um,

434
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:24.710
plus I'm hedging my bets,
you know,
from when the dollar collapses over here.

435
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.530
Hopefully at that point I could,
I could maybe,
uh,

436
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:33.860
then do a Billy red state tour over and fucking,
I dunno,
India,

437
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.150
I don't fucking know.
Speaking of which,

438
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.210
this is another great reason to go to Al Jazeera

439
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:46.020
cause he cause failures.
Americans who just think it's a terrorist thing.

440
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.050
They got some great stories here from around the world that you're not going to

441
00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:50.100
hear about.
Here's one for you.

442
00:26:50.101 --> 00:26:54.690
Referees sentence for sex bribe and Singapore.

443
00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.090
<v 6>Okay.</v>

444
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.300
<v 1>Oh,</v>

445
00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:01.130
Lebanese lineman pled guilty to accepting sexual favors in exchange for agreeing

446
00:27:01.131 --> 00:27:05.430
to fix a football match.
That

447
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:13.130
why wouldn't you just get a walker?
You know,
why wouldn't you just,

448
00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.280
it's just go look at some online porn.

449
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.990
Good Lord.
Go to a bar.
Say a load of somebody.

450
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:22.590
<v 6>Okay.</v>

451
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:25.200
<v 1>How fucking lucky.
I mean,
I don't understand it.</v>

452
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.660
I want to see what these guys look like.
But here's a story.

453
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:31.350
Three Lebanese football flares play football referees,
sorry.

454
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.910
At blood pled guilty to accepting free sex charges from a gambling linked global

455
00:27:35.911 --> 00:27:40.911
syndicate and return for agreeing to rig a match with is Singapore Judge Jaylene

456
00:27:41.281 --> 00:27:44.250
too.
And differing sentencing sentencing for a third.

457
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:49.320
The third guy just got a hand job or maybe he was a creep who just like to
watch,

458
00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:54.090
um,
a district court judge on Monday,
jailed assistant referee a,

459
00:27:54.091 --> 00:27:57.870
I'm not saying their fucking names.
Uh,
uh,
talk topic.

460
00:27:57.871 --> 00:28:00.900
The first name Ali Abdallah.

461
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:07.590
He gave him three months
and then the third referee,
Ali,

462
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:11.970
another Ali Ali,
I think over there is,
that's like somebody named Mike,

463
00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:17.010
at least back in the day before they started naming kids Dakota.
Um,

464
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.550
the assistant referees broke down into sobs.

465
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:25.770
When the judge Lau low,
we ping low.
We pay,

466
00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:27.610
motherfucker said a,

467
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:32.630
they could be freed by later on Monday or Tuesday after remission for good

468
00:28:33.571 --> 00:28:37.200
behavior and due to time already served a weighting their sentences,

469
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:40.830
they fucking broke down and cry.
Cried.
All right,
let me tell you something.

470
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.820
I don't know much.
I don't know much about going to prison,

471
00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.220
but I know you don't want to fucking cry.

472
00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.110
<v 6>Okay.</v>

473
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:53.200
<v 1>Going into prison.
I don't think you want to do that.
I really don't.</v>

474
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:57.970
Unless maybe they're crying because maybe they just dip putting them into the

475
00:28:57.971 --> 00:29:01.540
regular jail with all the fucking rapist and that type of shit and I got to

476
00:29:01.541 --> 00:29:05.650
somehow not get fucked in the ass until Monday or Tuesday.

477
00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:07.871
Jesus Christ.

478
00:29:07.871 --> 00:29:12.070
Can you imagine the calories you would burn just by stressing that someone was

479
00:29:12.071 --> 00:29:16.660
going to fucking rape you and the Goddamn booty hole?
You know what I mean?

480
00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:21.940
I would just think the quivering alone would be like walking on a treadmill at

481
00:29:21.941 --> 00:29:24.160
like,
you know,
3.1

482
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:32.520
um,
I don't want to get into that next year I had,

483
00:29:32.521 --> 00:29:33.560
that was a rape joke,
right?

484
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:38.300
Is that fucking failed comic turned blog are going to give me shit about it.

485
00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:40.071
You know,

486
00:29:40.071 --> 00:29:44.320
I did comedy for a minute and wasn't successful and these are the jokes that I

487
00:29:44.321 --> 00:29:45.670
think people should be doing.

488
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.500
Did you guys see that thing with Jim Norton was on with that,

489
00:29:50.501 --> 00:29:55.300
that blogger person,
I was just fucking was hilarious.

490
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.240
She was saying that comedy clubs were filled.

491
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:02.260
We're basements filled with angry men and she was coming off is quite angry

492
00:30:02.261 --> 00:30:06.010
herself.
The whole thing was fucking hilarious.
Uh,

493
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.560
and this is the thing about people who get offended by comedy.

494
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:12.700
I want to see somebody get outside of their own box.

495
00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:14.613
You know,

496
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:19.890
I want to see the fat person in the crowd get offended by,

497
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:25.030
I don't know.
I Dunno what,
pick a topic,
a different topic.

498
00:30:25.031 --> 00:30:27.070
I'm trying to think.
Okay.

499
00:30:27.071 --> 00:30:31.540
A fat guy get offended by misogynistic,
uh,

500
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:34.360
material.
Have the dog lover,

501
00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:38.670
the Peta person get offended by fucking,
uh,

502
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.860
I don't know the rape jokes or whatever.
Whatever the fucking Joe gives a fuck.

503
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:45.640
You know what I mean?
Who goes to a comedy club and takes joke seriously,

504
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.720
especially as a standup comedian.
You know what I mean?

505
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.760
I just,
for the life of me,
I'll never fucking understand that.

506
00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:57.403
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

507
00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:59.060
<v 1>I don't know.
I had the right,</v>

508
00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:04.810
when I came up to fucking talk about whatever I want to talk about and I failed

509
00:31:05.151 --> 00:31:10.151
miserably and I flailed and I made big mistakes and I offended people in the

510
00:31:10.311 --> 00:31:12.200
crowd and all of that fucking shit.

511
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:15.530
But that was all part of learning to become a comic.

512
00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.030
<v 6>Okay.</v>

513
00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.420
<v 1>Finding what it is you're supposed to be doing on stage is part of the learning</v>

514
00:31:20.421 --> 00:31:24.620
process.
So to try and fucking just cut that off.

515
00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:30.080
I Dunno.
I think it was really just a publicity stunt.

516
00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:34.280
You know,
when you write an open letter to white male comics right there,

517
00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.960
how hard,
how much harder could you be trying to be like a lightening rod?

518
00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:43.940
Um,
I don't know.
I don't fucking get done.
Hey,

519
00:31:43.941 --> 00:31:48.140
I played guitar for like six,
seven years and I'm offended by the cords.

520
00:31:48.141 --> 00:31:49.310
Eric Clapton is using it.

521
00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.593
<v 0>Okay.</v>

522
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:58.170
<v 1>And if you're listening to this,
you're angry blog or I'm just fucking around.</v>

523
00:31:58.171 --> 00:32:02.470
It's just jokes before you get your fucking panties and a God damn bunch again,

524
00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:03.920
but maybe that's what you should do.

525
00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:08.610
And then you can get on another talk show and discuss comedy.
Um,

526
00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.210
anyways,
plowing ahead.
By the way,
I thought Jim was great on it.

527
00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:17.160
I thought he was fucking,
I thought it was tremendous.
All right,
there we go.

528
00:32:17.161 --> 00:32:21.030
What else am I talking about here?
Um,
you know,

529
00:32:21.031 --> 00:32:25.320
I sold lemonade,
you know,
street side for like three weeks when I was a kid.

530
00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.243
And um,

531
00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:29.370
I would like to talk to the people that Lipton ice tea about some of the things

532
00:32:29.371 --> 00:32:31.980
that they're doing with their ice tea and lemonade.

533
00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.113
<v 6>You know,</v>

534
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:40.580
<v 1>I don't like the Arnold Palmer.
I feel that they should be separate.
All right.</v>

535
00:32:40.581 --> 00:32:44.960
I'm sorry,
what am I talking about here?
Let's get back to the podcast.
All right.

536
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:47.720
Can we do that bill for the love of fucking God?

537
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:50.720
Oh my apologies to the Chicago Blackhawks by the way.

538
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:52.130
<v 6>Okay.</v>

539
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:55.220
<v 1>My apologies to the Chicago Blackhawks.
I thought the La Kings,</v>

540
00:32:55.221 --> 00:32:58.740
we're going to beat you guys.
I really did.
My Damn dammit.
I'm like,

541
00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:02.900
don't even act like he didn't age during both of those games since the last time

542
00:33:02.901 --> 00:33:03.530
I said that.

543
00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:08.180
And I got to tell you a lot of Blackhawk fans really confident talking a lot of

544
00:33:08.181 --> 00:33:09.530
shit on my Twitter.

545
00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:15.220
It's almost as if the Bruins didn't just sweep the fucking Pittsburgh penguins.

546
00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:18.730
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

547
00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:20.500
<v 1>I guess that doesn't mean anything to them.</v>

548
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.080
I'm impressed with the way that they beat the La Kings.

549
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:27.730
Evidently they're not too impressed with sweeping the Pittsburgh Penguins.

550
00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.150
And by the way,
did anybody watch,
uh,
the,
um,

551
00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:35.920
after the Bruins one,
did anybody watch,
uh,

552
00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.930
the Sidney Crosby press conference?

553
00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:43.680
That dude would not give it up to the broads on any fucking level whatsoever.

554
00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.220
They'll be like,
you know,

555
00:33:45.221 --> 00:33:50.221
you were held scoreless you had zero points through four games in a playoff

556
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.060
game.
That's never happened.

557
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:56.830
You ever in the history of your being the Wayne Gretzky of right now,

558
00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:02.290
why do you think that was?
And he's just like,
I dunno,
you know,
uh,

559
00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:07.570
I don't know.
It was weird.
It was like a,
you know,
uh,
I dunno.
I Dunno.
They go,

560
00:34:07.571 --> 00:34:11.040
do you think it was the goal tending on the other team?
He's like,
Nah,

561
00:34:11.041 --> 00:34:13.990
I wasn't it.
Yeah,
I don't think so on wasn't the,
uh,

562
00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:19.750
goaltender we had our opportunities and uh,
just wouldn't go in.

563
00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.291
What do you think?

564
00:34:20.291 --> 00:34:23.780
Because maybe they blocked the shots and they were playing great.
Nah,

565
00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.660
that wasn't that one that either.

566
00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:31.870
Then what was it Sydney actually respected or on some level that he was such a

567
00:34:31.871 --> 00:34:36.070
competitor that he was still competing with the Bruins even though the series

568
00:34:36.071 --> 00:34:39.490
was over,
he just would not give them credit on any fucking level.

569
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:41.220
<v 6>Okay.</v>

570
00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:44.910
<v 1>For completely disrupting his game,
four straight games in a row,</v>

571
00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.850
you know,
I mean,
I'm

572
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:49.800
<v 6>okay.</v>

573
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.620
<v 1>Look,
I was as dumbfounded as anybody that we swept them,</v>

574
00:34:52.621 --> 00:34:55.530
but I mean I didn't have any questions at the end.

575
00:34:55.531 --> 00:34:59.810
The answers to all of those questions was sitting on the other bench and uh,

576
00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:04.680
and he didn't give it up.
They didn't give it up.
But you know what do,
by the way,

577
00:35:04.681 --> 00:35:09.430
how many teeth did that guy fucking lose?
Man?
Holy Shit.

578
00:35:09.431 --> 00:35:12.130
That guy is like,
what is that?

579
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:17.440
That was one to 16 up top.
17 to 32 on the bottom.

580
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:23.670
Halfway between 17 and 32 we'll say that's like numbers 25 he lost like teeth

581
00:35:25.031 --> 00:35:27.520
number 25 26 27

582
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:33.200
in at least 28 if not 29.

583
00:35:33.201 --> 00:35:37.680
He's lost either four or five fucking teeth right down the bottom.
Man.

584
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.650
Jesus.
Did you guys ever see that?

585
00:35:40.651 --> 00:35:43.770
Like you want to talk how tough hockey players are and I include Sidney Crosby

586
00:35:43.771 --> 00:35:46.650
and as much as I call them,
the pouty lips,
Cub Scout,

587
00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:51.330
that fucking dude took us slot.
Somebody,
I forget,

588
00:35:51.331 --> 00:35:54.930
I can't remember who the puck deflected off somebody stick and caught him right

589
00:35:54.931 --> 00:35:58.950
in the fucking face,
broke his jaw and knocked out.

590
00:35:58.951 --> 00:36:01.680
It looks anywhere from three to five teeth.

591
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:04.320
They literally flew out of his mouth

592
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:11.000
and the fucking dude gets up in skates off the ice with the trainers and uh,

593
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:15.240
you know,
I guarantee you within five days he was skating again.

594
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:22.050
I don't know,
I could never do that.
So anyways,
so here we are,
the original six,

595
00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.940
the original six or in the Stanley Cup,

596
00:36:23.941 --> 00:36:27.390
we've got an original six for the first time since 1979 when the Montreal

597
00:36:27.391 --> 00:36:31.080
Canadian French were playing,
uh,
the,
uh,

598
00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.490
the New York Rangers.
Um,

599
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:37.350
so I'm really excited about that.

600
00:36:37.351 --> 00:36:40.380
This is great for hockey and I think it's going to be a great series.
And,
uh,

601
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:45.780
you know,
I actually watched those last two games and uh,

602
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:51.000
I want,
see if Brian Billick in loot in Milan,

603
00:36:51.001 --> 00:36:54.750
Lou Cheech around on the ice at the same time,

604
00:36:54.751 --> 00:36:57.720
that's going to be fucking unbelievable because those are two of the biggest

605
00:36:57.721 --> 00:37:00.630
dudes in the league.
And uh,
it's,

606
00:37:00.631 --> 00:37:04.080
I think it's going to be a fucking awesome series and I hope it doesn't go six.

607
00:37:04.081 --> 00:37:08.280
I want this thing to go seven.
I hope it's going to be a classic.
Like I said,

608
00:37:08.281 --> 00:37:11.250
the NHL is going to be on the cover and the NHL playoffs are on the cover of

609
00:37:11.251 --> 00:37:16.251
sports illustrated under the headline the best and it should just a great time

610
00:37:16.291 --> 00:37:20.880
for hockey.
And if they had this a great,
you know,
Stanley Cup final,
you know,

611
00:37:20.881 --> 00:37:24.420
maybe they'll get a little more respect and uh,

612
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:27.870
and obviously of course I want my Bruins to win and I'm thinking about going to

613
00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:31.530
a game.
I might go in Chicago.
You know,

614
00:37:31.531 --> 00:37:34.980
I already went to a playoff game when I was back in Boston and plus I love those

615
00:37:34.981 --> 00:37:36.600
Chicago Jerseys,
the red ones.

616
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.270
I think it was one of my favorite ones in the league.

617
00:37:39.271 --> 00:37:42.090
And I want to go there and a,
and I won't be a cunt.

618
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.710
I'm not going to show with my Bruins shit.

619
00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.620
I'm just going to sit there stoically and,
uh,

620
00:37:46.621 --> 00:37:49.230
when the Bruins score and hopefully win the fucking gate,
you know,

621
00:37:49.231 --> 00:37:51.150
I won't do anything to get the shit kicked out of me.

622
00:37:51.151 --> 00:37:55.770
And I'll go back to my rented fucking Chevy Malibu and I'll drive back to

623
00:37:55.771 --> 00:37:58.950
fucking O'Hare and that'll be it.
And I'll have that experience.

624
00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.570
Speaking of experiences,
it is my birthday,
everybody,

625
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:08.370
and I want to thank everyone who wished,
wished me a happy birthday.
And,
uh,

626
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.830
what was I gonna say?
Yeah.
People are,
uh,
you know,

627
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.960
my friends and family and life were asking me,

628
00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:19.110
you know what I wanted for my birthday and I told all of them,
nothing.

629
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:25.430
Look at me.
Don't buy me anything.
Just like Jimmy and,
uh,

630
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:27.470
in Goodfellas.
All right.

631
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:32.120
I've learned something through the water damage that I had in my house when I

632
00:38:32.121 --> 00:38:35.000
took everything out of my fucking closets in these couple of,

633
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:40.290
I have so much fucking shit that I have not used or even looked at in,

634
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:45.400
in years.
And uh,
I already gave away my Fran Tarkington Jersey.

635
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:47.500
I know some people were asking whether it was still available.

636
00:38:47.501 --> 00:38:51.520
I gave that away and I gave it away to the first guy.
Um,

637
00:38:51.521 --> 00:38:55.450
I read like I read like 20 emails before I got to this guy and he actually

638
00:38:55.451 --> 00:38:59.500
brought up like Alan Page,
Jim Marshall,
Carl Eller,

639
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:03.490
Paul Krauss,
Chuck Foreman,
Fred Cox,

640
00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:07.990
right back when men one named after Dicks,
you know,

641
00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:12.880
and um,
he knew all that shit.
So I said,
fuck it.

642
00:39:12.881 --> 00:39:16.090
I'll give it to it to give it to that person.
Um,

643
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.910
and if the person who as it is listening,

644
00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.400
please take a picture yourself in the Jersey sent it to me.

645
00:39:21.401 --> 00:39:23.980
I'll put it up on the podcast page if you want.
If you want a little,

646
00:39:23.981 --> 00:39:26.680
a little fucking shout out or an,

647
00:39:26.681 --> 00:39:29.020
and actually will stop people from suggesting that.

648
00:39:29.021 --> 00:39:33.340
I would say that there's a giveaway when there is no giveaway.
So anyways,
um,

649
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.440
yeah,
I don't want any more shit.

650
00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:41.600
I'm not buying any more sports tee shirts because I get sentimental value and I

651
00:39:41.601 --> 00:39:45.020
can't fucking throw him out.
And uh,
from here on out,

652
00:39:45.021 --> 00:39:48.440
I'm just buying those Malcolm young solid color fucking tee shirts.

653
00:39:48.441 --> 00:39:53.270
And when they wear out,
I throw him out cause they don't mean shit to me.
And uh,

654
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:57.440
no,
I got to do it,
man.
I gotta fucking get rid of all my God damn shit.

655
00:39:57.441 --> 00:40:01.100
So today what I'm doing for my birthday is I think I'm going to go to the gun

656
00:40:01.101 --> 00:40:05.150
range and I'm going to go drive out into the desert.
One of the other,

657
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:11.440
um,
one or the other.
I don't know if I'm going to go over the,

658
00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:14.040
I usually go over the gun range or somebody knows what the fuck they're doing,

659
00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:19.590
like going over there by myself and just renting a gun.
But I gotta tell you,

660
00:40:19.591 --> 00:40:24.270
it's oddly fucking relaxing.
Who's kitten Ho.
I'm 45 fucking years old.
What?

661
00:40:24.271 --> 00:40:26.790
I'm not going to do shit for my birthday.
All right.

662
00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:29.910
I'm doing my God damn podcasts and I might go drive out to the desert cause I

663
00:40:29.911 --> 00:40:33.930
just want,
I always wanted to do that because I'm a nerd.
All right,
that's it.

664
00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:38.970
Okay,
so here we go.
Here's the,
uh,
here's some questions for this week.

665
00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:44.010
Um,
oh,
casino carpets.
It says part three.

666
00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:47.970
The final answer.
I was just like a trilogy,
like one of those spaces.

667
00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:48.441
You know what?
No,

668
00:40:48.441 --> 00:40:51.540
I feel bad that I fucking came down on that girl who was fucking blogging and

669
00:40:51.541 --> 00:40:55.500
the shit call in our failed comic.
Like,
I fucking know.
You know what it is.

670
00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:58.230
If she's still fucking listening,
if somebody gives her this part of it,

671
00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:00.270
you know what it really is,
is

672
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:06.150
I just can't believe a fellow comic would fucking attack.

673
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:13.540
I just didn't criticize it
with,

674
00:41:13.541 --> 00:41:15.640
with that angle,
you know what I mean?

675
00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.230
To shrink it down and make it smaller.

676
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:20.720
<v 0>Okay.</v>

677
00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:24.100
<v 1>I just,
it just blows my fucking mind.
I'm just disappointed.</v>

678
00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:25.760
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

679
00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.320
<v 1>Disappointed,
I guess is more the word.</v>

680
00:41:27.321 --> 00:41:30.200
The Shit I said before I set out a fucking anger.
I didn't mean that shit,

681
00:41:30.201 --> 00:41:31.340
but it's just fucking

682
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.890
<v 0>okay.</v>

683
00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:33.723
<v 1>You know what I mean?</v>

684
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:37.040
<v 5>I've been doing this shit 21 years and I'm still learning stuff.</v>

685
00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:38.510
I don't know shit about the yard.
Why?

686
00:41:38.511 --> 00:41:42.110
There's no fucking way I would go on television and start.

687
00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:43.470
<v 0>Okay.</v>

688
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:43.771
<v 5>You know,</v>

689
00:41:43.771 --> 00:41:48.240
criticizing other fucking calm and not to mention like this whole fucking thing,

690
00:41:48.241 --> 00:41:53.241
like there's all these rape jokes being told is just so fucking inaccurate.

691
00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:58.790
Like you just walk into a comedy club in,
everyone's rang,
her rang,
rang rape,

692
00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.190
rape.
I,
I'm trying to think,
the only person I can actually think of,

693
00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:03.770
<v 0>okay.</v>

694
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:04.850
<v 5>The Raleigh rape joke that I,</v>

695
00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:07.970
that really stands out that I remember was Jim Norton.
He did a,

696
00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:12.770
he did a hilarious one.
He was talking about going to prison in some,
he said,
Jim,

697
00:42:12.771 --> 00:42:17.750
would you,
uh,
you think you'd get raped if you went to prison?
He goes,
he goes,

698
00:42:17.751 --> 00:42:18.261
look at me.

699
00:42:18.261 --> 00:42:21.410
I would get raped on the bus ride on in the way into prison or something like

700
00:42:21.411 --> 00:42:24.800
that.
I butchered the joke
and it was funny.

701
00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:28.910
So I don't know.
I just think,
you know,

702
00:42:28.911 --> 00:42:33.911
the last thing stand up needs is for fellow comics to be fucking trying to mold

703
00:42:36.321 --> 00:42:39.380
it into what the fuck they is an individual think it should be that just,

704
00:42:39.381 --> 00:42:43.790
that's just beyond me.
Why did I get into this shit?

705
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:47.390
I don't fucking know.
You know why?
Because it bugs me.
All right,
here we go.

706
00:42:47.391 --> 00:42:51.080
Casino carpets,
part three.
The final answer.
Bill Ewm Wallace,

707
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.830
I installed carpet for six years.
That guy was only half right.
Oh,
that,

708
00:42:55.831 --> 00:43:00.260
that was the guy last week who claimed that the carpeting is actually really

709
00:43:00.261 --> 00:43:04.940
expensive and it's a really high quality and uh,

710
00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:08.690
so I guess it's easier to clean or set came with the fuck he said.
Jesus Christ.

711
00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:12.770
He said yes.
The casino carpets are a commercial grade carpet.
Yes,

712
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.710
they last a long time.
Um,

713
00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:19.730
but they aren't crazy colors and designs because it makes the carpets last

714
00:43:19.731 --> 00:43:23.840
longer.
The colors and design are a to hide stains.

715
00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:29.320
When you spill a big strawberry Margarita on a solid blue carpet stain will be

716
00:43:29.511 --> 00:43:33.140
playing his day with wacky designs and colors.

717
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:37.070
You can't spot a spilled drink.
Oh,
cool.
Be,

718
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.320
it hides the seams of the carpet.

719
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:42.950
Carpet comes in 12 or 15 foot wide rolls.

720
00:43:42.951 --> 00:43:45.200
Commercial carpets are usually 15.

721
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:49.700
That means for every 15 feet in with you,
we'll have a full scene.

722
00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:52.130
Uh,
it was a solid color.

723
00:43:52.131 --> 00:43:55.520
You would see a straight line in the carpet for the entire length of the room.

724
00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:00.380
The colors and design breaks up to seem like camouflage.
Well,
there you go.

725
00:44:00.381 --> 00:44:04.910
Love the podcast.
Come to Tulsa sometime and go fuck yourself.
Oh,
thank you.
Um,

726
00:44:04.911 --> 00:44:09.650
I am coming to Tulsa on the Billy red state tour.
All right.

727
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.670
X Defense Minister from Canada speaks out about,
speaks,

728
00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:14.900
speaks about,

729
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:16.500
<v 0>okay.</v>

730
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:19.680
<v 5>See,
this is what not,
once again,
not my fault,
this person writes x,</v>

731
00:44:19.681 --> 00:44:24.420
defense minister from Canada speaks about out about aliens,

732
00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:31.250
out about aliens or speaks out about aliens or does he speak about out about

733
00:44:32.161 --> 00:44:36.010
aliens?
See what I'm saying?
Susan always me.

734
00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:41.020
All right.
Bill loved the podcast.
Freelance every week.

735
00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:44.080
Uh,
they're much appreciated,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.

736
00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:49.140
I thought you might like this link as you're a big conspiracy theory of big

737
00:44:49.661 --> 00:44:51.940
conspiracy theorist.
You mean?
He said,

738
00:44:51.941 --> 00:44:54.550
it's the former Canadian defense administrator.

739
00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:59.680
No Canadian defense minister giving some bold claims about several species of

740
00:44:59.681 --> 00:45:03.400
aliens living among us and actually working with elements and the government.

741
00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.760
Uh,
not only that,
but a shadowy

742
00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.730
cabal.
Ca Bal cable cable,
I dunno,

743
00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:16.600
comprised of the council on Foreign Relations,
the bill,
the Burgers,

744
00:45:16.601 --> 00:45:20.650
the tea
trilateral commission.

745
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:24.910
That should add a hyphen in it.
You can't,
the international banking cartel,

746
00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:27.910
uh,
the oil cartels,

747
00:45:27.911 --> 00:45:30.850
members of various intelligence organizes and select members and military judge

748
00:45:30.851 --> 00:45:34.540
[inaudible] one world government.
Check it out,
sir.

749
00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:37.870
The last thing I'm going to do is look at this.
I'll put the link up there.
Ah,

750
00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:39.070
fuck it.
I'll look at it right now.

751
00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:42.490
This shit just freaks me out and makes me depressed because there's nothing I

752
00:45:42.491 --> 00:45:45.790
can do about it.
Okay.
Now,
well,
how is this going to help me,
sir?

753
00:45:45.791 --> 00:45:49.540
If I find out there's actually aliens living among us,

754
00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:54.820
talking to international bankers,
you know,
am I going to come walking in,

755
00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:59.770
bursting into their meeting like the end of a feel good movie?
You know,

756
00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:04.210
like,
hey man,
the people have spoken and they liked me.

757
00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:08.290
All right,
here we go.
I got it right here.
Uh,

758
00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.780
Canada's former minister of national defense,

759
00:46:10.781 --> 00:46:15.040
Paul Haler testifies at the citizen's hearing on disclosure,

760
00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:20.160
where the fuck am I last month in Washington DC that aliens are living among us

761
00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.700
and that it is likely at least two of them are working with the u s government.

762
00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:31.710
Oh,
this guy sounds like he's out of his fucking mind.
Ugh.
Let,
let's,
let's,

763
00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:35.220
let's,
let's kind of flip the script here.
Let's say you're an alien.

764
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.580
<v 6>Okay.</v>

765
00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:36.960
<v 5>All right.</v>

766
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:40.020
Whoever's listening to this still who believes in aliens who isn't blogging

767
00:46:40.021 --> 00:46:42.600
about my reaction to the blogger?
Um,

768
00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:44.210
<v 6>okay.</v>

769
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:47.330
<v 5>Can you go to what you go to another fucking solar system now,
the galaxy,</v>

770
00:46:47.331 --> 00:46:51.350
whatever the fucking terminology is,
and you land there.

771
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.393
<v 6>Okay,</v>

772
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:57.700
<v 5>what are you going to do other than try and get blended it.</v>

773
00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.020
Blend in so people don't chop your fucking alien head off.

774
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.820
Like,
how exactly did this fucking alien?

775
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.470
<v 6>Okay.</v>

776
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:09.480
<v 5>Get,
infiltrate the government.</v>

777
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:16.030
This is like Mr. Smith goes to Washington,
the alien just lands and just goes,

778
00:47:16.031 --> 00:47:19.840
okay.
Ah Right.
I mean,
how come he didn't do this in Argentina?

779
00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:23.140
We picked the United States,

780
00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:28.240
goes right into fucking Washington DC walks into the Capitol building is

781
00:47:28.241 --> 00:47:31.540
somebody filibustering so they can't make an electric car or whatever comes

782
00:47:31.541 --> 00:47:34.750
right out on the house floor and then does what?

783
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:36.290
<v 6>Okay.</v>

784
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:37.760
<v 5>You know,
security comes up,</v>

785
00:47:37.761 --> 00:47:40.760
tries to shoot him and he just puts his hands up and their guns turned into like

786
00:47:40.761 --> 00:47:42.620
chocolate bars or fall to the ground.
Yeah.

787
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:49.050
And then for some reason everybody in their suits doesn't scrambled and freak

788
00:47:49.051 --> 00:47:51.810
the fuck out,
you know?

789
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:58.620
No,
you just fucking walk out there today.
Let's go and I'll relax,
relax,

790
00:47:58.830 --> 00:47:59.663
relax.

791
00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:04.270
A simple technology that you guys will discover if you become friends with me,

792
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.610
hired attorney,
the fucking gone into some melted shit that a,

793
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:12.110
doesn't let people shoot you.
I am from the planet.
Zoll Tar.
Right.

794
00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:17.210
It always begins with a z.
How does that work?

795
00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:23.280
Like if you were a fucking alien and you went to another God damn planet.

796
00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:26.250
Exactly.
I guess.
Okay.
You'd be like,
all right,

797
00:48:26.251 --> 00:48:30.120
if there's a bunch of different nations,
which one seems to be running?
Shit,

798
00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:35.160
I got to chop the head off and you're just going to want you when you were in a

799
00:48:35.161 --> 00:48:37.020
buddy,
two of you

800
00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:40.420
going to walk in fucking arm and arm.

801
00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:43.383
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

802
00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:46.820
<v 5>And do what?
Yeah.
Hey,
listen.</v>

803
00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.710
I think just the simple fact that we were able to get here,

804
00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:53.560
you know the kind of firepower that we're capable of.
Uh,

805
00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:58.730
for some fucking reason we want to take over this planet or we want you guys to

806
00:48:58.771 --> 00:49:02.250
do shit the way we feel that the it should be done.

807
00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:03.870
<v 6>Okay.</v>

808
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:05.690
<v 5>Who?
Who would want that fucking headache?</v>

809
00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:11.960
I don't,
I don't know that I believe this shit anyways.

810
00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:16.610
He believes hell.
Whose beliefs on extra life?
Extra terrestrial life.

811
00:49:16.611 --> 00:49:18.950
And you are so your foes are well established.

812
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:22.930
Made the statements at the nongovernmental hearings chaired by six form a US

813
00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:26.600
calm congressmen and aimed at,
according to the events website,

814
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:31.370
doing what the u s congress had failed to do for 45 years.

815
00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:35.090
Seek out the facts surrounding the most important issue of this or any other

816
00:49:35.091 --> 00:49:38.570
time evidence pointing towards an extraterrestrial presence.

817
00:49:38.571 --> 00:49:41.300
Engaging the human race.
Yeah.

818
00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.030
<v 1>All right.
You know what?</v>

819
00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:48.550
Even I have my limits when it comes to that type of shit.
All right.

820
00:49:48.551 --> 00:49:50.510
I don't think that's the most pressing thing.
I would say.
Yeah,

821
00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:54.220
I was fucking up the environment,
world population and that type of shit.
Shit,

822
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:55.063
it's a little more

823
00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:56.980

of the podcast.
Let me close this right here.
I don't want to save that.

886
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:45.960
Uh,
fuck.
This happens every God damn week older.
All right,
here we go.
Next letter.

887
00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:51.190
This letter is about an older lady.
Um,

888
00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:55.560
I'm a 29 year old guy and for the last two years I have been seeing an

889
00:53:55.561 --> 00:53:59.850
incredible,
incredibly amazing woman that is 13 years older than me.

890
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:03.300
And you know what?
It's not going to work out,
sir,

891
00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:07.530
cause you're 29 and she's fucking 42.

892
00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:10.683
<v 0>You know,</v>

893
00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:13.850
<v 5>that doesn't seem to work out.
Women can do that.</v>

894
00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:17.910
For some reason they could do it.
You know,

895
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:21.720
didn't you learn anything with Ashton Kutcher and ain't going to happen.

896
00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.353
<v 0>You know,</v>

897
00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:26.990
<v 5>when you're 37,
she's going to be 50.</v>

898
00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:28.843
<v 0>Come on</v>

899
00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:34.430
<v 5>37.
You could still pull a 27 year old.
You're coming home to her,
right?</v>

900
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:37.700
She's starting to get hot flashes.
She's taken Geritol.

901
00:54:37.701 --> 00:54:41.990
I mean this is not going to work.
I'm sorry.
Let me continue.
She's sexy,

902
00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:44.390
fun and we share a lot of common interests.

903
00:54:44.391 --> 00:54:48.290
We talked about what direction our relationship was going to take very early on

904
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:52.370
and we decided that keeping it casual was the way to go.
Smart move.

905
00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:53.923
Smart move.

906
00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:58.610
Now what does taking a casual meet that means I fuck you once every six weeks in

907
00:54:58.611 --> 00:55:00.980
my birthday and my birthday and my,
my,

908
00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:06.680
why did I say birthday in my book?
You know what it is.
It's my birthday.

909
00:55:06.681 --> 00:55:08.900
I don't want to get on with it.
I want to go drive out to the desert.

910
00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:11.080
That's what it was.
Uh,

911
00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:14.390
we didn't commit to each other in any official sense,

912
00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:19.290
but neither of us saw anyone else.
Well,

913
00:55:19.291 --> 00:55:22.950
Jesus Christ,
now you're gonna catch feelings for over the two years.

914
00:55:22.951 --> 00:55:27.951
I fell in love with her they ago and wanted to commit so we could make a real go

915
00:55:27.961 --> 00:55:31.830
of it.
I fucked up though.
I never confessed those feelings to her.

916
00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:35.730
I was afraid of things eventually hitting a wall because of the age difference.

917
00:55:35.731 --> 00:55:37.350
So I felt safe or not telling her.

918
00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:41.940
She recently told me she had has wanted the same things I do this whole time,

919
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:46.110
but she has now met someone closer to her own age promising the real

920
00:55:46.111 --> 00:55:50.100
relationship.
I never gave her.
I believe she has feelings for me but thanks.

921
00:55:50.101 --> 00:55:52.230
This is the best choice for her.
What do I do?

922
00:55:52.231 --> 00:55:54.240
Do I stand up and fight for what I want?

923
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:58.220
Consequences be damned or should I let her go and accept that age differences in

924
00:55:58.221 --> 00:56:03.060
an insurmountable problem.
On a side note,
I've been in many relationships.

925
00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:06.750
I know myself well enough to know the difference between love and infatuation.

926
00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:11.070
Well then if you know the difference,
I would go for what you want.
Okay.

927
00:56:11.071 --> 00:56:13.140
As an outsider I would say let her go.

928
00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:15.143
<v 0>MMM.</v>

929
00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:19.220
<v 5>And even though you know the difference between love and infatuation,</v>

930
00:56:19.221 --> 00:56:20.660
do you want to have a family sir?

931
00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:22.300
<v 0>Okay.</v>

932
00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:24.220
<v 5>You know,
cause if you,
you need to marry this girl</v>

933
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:29.220
<v 0>in a week and start pumping out the fucking kids cause she's already 42 are you</v>

934
00:56:29.471 --> 00:56:33.460
ready to do that?
Because if you're not,
you got to let her go.

935
00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:35.353
All right.

936
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:40.660
<v 5>That's all I got to say.
I'm sorry.
That's all I got on that one.
All right,
wife,</v>

937
00:56:40.661 --> 00:56:41.560
not down with the,

938
00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:46.210
with the with nose job wife not down with nose job.

939
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:50.950
All right,
dear Billy boy loved the podcast.
I'll just stand up.
Thanks for that.

940
00:56:50.951 --> 00:56:55.540
Well,
you're welcome.
Thank you for,
uh,
thank you for typing that.
Um,
he goes,

941
00:56:55.541 --> 00:57:00.070
I'm a 31 year old guy.
I'm happily married to a usually supportive wife.

942
00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:04.030
I never been too much of a self conscious person,

943
00:57:04.031 --> 00:57:05.620
but ever since I was a teenager,

944
00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:08.560
if there was one thing I could change about my physical appearance,

945
00:57:08.561 --> 00:57:09.580
that would be my nose.

946
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.380
It's a little big and has a bump on the ridge I have now.

947
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:19.690
Okay.
He said ref referenced a profile on Nikolai Tesla

948
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:24.370
or the rule of Constantine to get the idea.

949
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:28.600
Obviously a giant knows what the SIF with severe acne was.

950
00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:33.600
Immediate fuel for insult through junior high school for the hordes of 14 year

951
00:57:33.851 --> 00:57:38.110
olds.
I vowed that one day.
Oh,
I'm sorry.

952
00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:39.460
I am just the fucking worst year.

953
00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:42.610
I vowed that one day I would get a nose job to boost my self esteem.

954
00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:48.340
Well I am now in a position where I can pay to have the surgery.
Um,

955
00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:51.250
I used to ask my wife a few years back what she thought about it and she said

956
00:57:51.251 --> 00:57:53.260
that if it makes me happy than do it.
However,

957
00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:55.780
now that I am closer to having one having it done,

958
00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:58.660
she seems to have changed her mind.
She says that she couldn't,

959
00:57:58.661 --> 00:58:02.140
she couldn't get used to seeing me look different and isn't sure if she'll like

960
00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:04.750
the uh,
the way the remodeled me looks,

961
00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:09.100
I'm disappointed because I really want to have it done and what she would be

962
00:58:09.101 --> 00:58:09.790
supportive.

963
00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:14.080
The thing is my wife is a self conscious person and I'm worried that on a small

964
00:58:14.081 --> 00:58:17.710
level she thinks that the new me will be more attractive and warrant the

965
00:58:17.711 --> 00:58:22.450
attention of more females.
This is not what I'm,
this is not why I'm doing this.

966
00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:26.110
I just want to feel better about myself.
What should I do?
Thanks for your help.

967
00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:28.120
All right.
Back up for a second.

968
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:32.840
You said your wife has self conscious and you're worried that on a small level

969
00:58:32.841 --> 00:58:36.080
she thinks the new me will be more attractive and warrant the attention of more

970
00:58:36.081 --> 00:58:39.020
females.
As much as you say,
this isn't why you're doing this.

971
00:58:39.021 --> 00:58:42.410
I think that's why you're doing it subconsciously,

972
00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.353
<v 0>you know,</v>

973
00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:48.050
<v 5>I think that that's your thought and you're putting it on your wife.</v>

974
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:52.100
You have to understand,
yeah,
you gotta understand this.
All right.
Your nose.

975
00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:56.380
All right.
That's like the,
uh,
that's the Hubby of face.

976
00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:02.320
Okay.
If you add or subtract to that,
you're really changing what you look like.

977
00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:05.200
Okay.
And every checkout,

978
00:59:05.201 --> 00:59:08.950
they're so dirty dancing and they all sell at the lead of that movie.

979
00:59:08.951 --> 00:59:13.600
Did she got a nose job?
And I thought she was fucking adorable in that movie.

980
00:59:13.601 --> 00:59:16.090
I thought she was beautiful.
You know,
I never,

981
00:59:16.091 --> 00:59:19.330
I could never get through the fucking movie,
but,
uh,

982
00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:23.690
I thought she was hot and then she got a nose job and I,
it was like,
ah,

983
00:59:23.691 --> 00:59:26.480
what did you do?
You know?
Look Dude,

984
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:31.220
you're fucking nose makes you unique.
That's why you should stick with it.

985
00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:34.470
Stay with it.
I mean,
I dunno

986
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:39.170
to get a nose job because people teased you when you were 14.

987
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:41.990
You better than that.
All right.
And you with your wife,

988
00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:47.050
she loves you for who you are.
You know,
I

989
00:59:49.170 --> 00:59:52.120
listen to,
I mean,
it's your,
it's your call in the end,

990
00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:57.820
but they don't exactly have those things down to a science,
you know what I mean?

991
00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:03.940
At this point,
plastic surgery,
it's like shooting threes.
You know,
most of them.

992
01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:05.590
Uh,
and most of them don't go in,

993
01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.630
but when they do,
the crowd goes crazy.

994
01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:15.130
So there's a chance that you could come out with the nose you want,

995
01:00:15.131 --> 01:00:17.260
but more times than not,
I think it's going to,

996
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:22.470
if you know you want your nose to fucking clang off the front of the rim,

997
01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:27.070
or even worse,
shoot a fucking air ball splat on the fucking hardwood.

998
01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:32.950
Um,
I would never recommend plastic surgery,
but dude,

999
01:00:32.951 --> 01:00:36.550
I know what you're a,
I know what you're going through.
This shit about myself.

1000
01:00:36.551 --> 01:00:38.950
I don't like that.
I'm fucking losing my hair.
And believe me,

1001
01:00:38.951 --> 01:00:40.630
every time those hair commercials come on,

1002
01:00:40.631 --> 01:00:43.210
I fucking sit there and look at them and go,
should I,
should I?

1003
01:00:43.211 --> 01:00:46.570
And then I always say I'm not gonna but I never rule it out that I wouldn't do

1004
01:00:46.571 --> 01:00:50.410
it.
I just keep waiting because every five years it gets better and better and

1005
01:00:50.411 --> 01:00:50.710
better.

1006
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:54.460
Like how it looks at this point now they can just vacuum the hair out of the

1007
01:00:54.461 --> 01:00:58.580
back and just fucking planet upfront.
Um,

1008
01:00:58.990 --> 01:01:02.430
as opposed to having the scars and the hair plugs and having that shit.

1009
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:05.860
But I still,
for some reason I'm not going to do it.

1010
01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:11.750
Uh,
I dunno why and I don't know why

1011
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:18.040
I think about it cause I think like,
I can guarantee you this,
if women went bald,

1012
01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:19.450
they would all get fucking hair.

1013
01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.840
They would all have hair plugs in one generation and then they would all have

1014
01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:23.860
that type of thing.

1015
01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:28.210
And I always makes me laugh when women make fun of guys that get like a hair

1016
01:01:28.211 --> 01:01:32.080
transplant,
like,
oh my God,
it's,
they sit,
they're wearing makeup,
you know,

1017
01:01:32.081 --> 01:01:36.610
high heels on and everything about them is to fucking enhance,
you know,

1018
01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:41.980
they're looks.
Um,
but then also I get why they don't like it,

1019
01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:45.700
you know?
Cause I think what they're attracted to is different.

1020
01:01:45.701 --> 01:01:49.870
Obviously they don't want to have some troll of a man,
but,
uh,
I think that they,

1021
01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.730
they made sure this might come back to you.

1022
01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:55.240
They want you to be a fucking man and be comfortable with yourself.

1023
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:58.870
Go out there and just swing a goddamn acts and bring some fucking lumbering for

1024
01:01:58.871 --> 01:02:00.610
the fire.
You know,

1025
01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.230
they don't want to just sit there watching you,

1026
01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.560
looking at yourself in the mirror.
Go on and look at this.
Look at my nose.

1027
01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:11.040
I just don't like why my ears look,
you know,

1028
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:15.320
I dunno.
I this,
this,
my advice would be,

1029
01:02:15.321 --> 01:02:19.980
I would think long and fucking hard.
All right.

1030
01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.320
And you told me to look at that picture of like Tesla and Constantine over the

1031
01:02:25.321 --> 01:02:27.720
fuck you say their names.
Uh,

1032
01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:32.670
why don't you go look up that chick before and after who was in a dirty dancing,

1033
01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:34.260
which is an asshole thing for me to do.

1034
01:02:34.261 --> 01:02:35.900
Cause I'm sure she had a lot of trauma over that.

1035
01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:39.780
Now I'm going to fucking restir the pot.
Uh,

1036
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:43.170
but yeah,
and then you,
you'll probably be like,

1037
01:02:43.171 --> 01:02:46.590
well that was a nose job from fucking 23 years ago and I feel like rolling the

1038
01:02:46.591 --> 01:02:49.170
dice then by all means go for it.
But uh,

1039
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.550
why don't you do it before and after.
Take a picture,
you know,

1040
01:02:53.551 --> 01:02:57.000
standing to the side,
like the Mug Mug shot photo,

1041
01:02:57.001 --> 01:03:00.510
give me a forward and to the side and then forward to the side in the end.

1042
01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:04.800
And this is the deal.
If you get me a before and I never get an after,

1043
01:03:04.801 --> 01:03:05.730
then I know what happened.

1044
01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:11.370
I'm trying to think what was one of the songs from dirty dancing
was that,

1045
01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:16.460
<v 2>that [inaudible] that all dad stay with her drinks were hazy.</v>

1046
01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.360
He has really tight slacks.

1047
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:25.280
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1048
01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:28.640
<v 2>And his hair is done better then mine,</v>

1049
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:34.480
<v 5>um,
Outros Howard core was Patrick Swayze,
the guy had cancer.
He's like,
yeah,</v>

1050
01:03:34.481 --> 01:03:39.220
I'm still smoking.
Go Fuck Yourself.
That dude,
when I like a man,
you know,

1051
01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:43.960
he really did.
So did she sit down with same to take a total lefthand turn.

1052
01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:48.410
All right.
I can tell you right now,
people are about ready to hang me.
All right?

1053
01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:51.880
And I was rough.
I would definitely accept the hood.

1054
01:03:52.090 --> 01:03:55.840
Please put the hood off my face.
You can't see me blubbering inside of it.

1055
01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.260
He said,
no,
I don't want the hood.
The stare down,
everybody was talking shit.

1056
01:03:59.261 --> 01:04:01.630
F Fuck you go fuck yourself.
Your mother's a whore.

1057
01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:05.530
And they put the rope around his neck and furthermore,
I said,

1058
01:04:05.531 --> 01:04:09.340
your grandmother's mother's a cunt.
I spit on your wall and that was it.

1059
01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:15.030
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1060

He got to do it.
Okay,

Fundamental basketball.
You know,

1091
01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:10.900
every white guy wants that to win.
Get Out.

1092
01:06:10.901 --> 01:06:14.320
Cause that's the best we can bring fundamental basketball.

1093
01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:18.790
There's never been a white doctor Jay.

you know,

I don't know what's going to happen.
Uh,
I think the inevitable,

1098
01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:40.570
but I'm hoping the spurs are gonna win.
Um,

1099
01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:44.290

1102
01:06:49.891 --> 01:06:51.520
it got to be the underdog against the,
uh,

1103
01:06:51.521 --> 01:06:55.870
the black cocks considering the first two games are in Chicago.
