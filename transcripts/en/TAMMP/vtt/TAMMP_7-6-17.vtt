00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.730
Just checking in audio.
Sorry,
I'm saving my voice.

5
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:21.570
I fucked up my voice a couple of months ago and I've just ignored it and now I

6
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:24.360
am time,
throat coding,
teeing.
Um,

7
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.310
I got some halls sucking on the halls there.

8
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.460
Dude.
It's still fucking metal lip.

9
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:36.000
This would have been fucking says on the thing.

10
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.280
Hauls Mental Lippolis mental lip.
This Eucalyptus,

11
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.620
I don't know.
Take a steam.
You,

12
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:47.310
what you need to do via voice is you need to stop talking.

13
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.920
You need to drink some condensed milk.

14
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.020
It's like 20 people right now.
What could does milk a little,
she calls Flim.

15
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:59.010
Shut the fuck up.
You never went to medical school.
Okay.

16
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.860
All you did was drink a glass of milk.

17
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:05.040
Stop talking like you're a fucking veterinarian.
Ah,
you know,

18
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:09.900
I didn't want to be in a mood like this.
Um,
all right,
so Billy,

19
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.980
no fun.

20
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.750
Now I've cried wolf for about three weeks right now,

21
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.430
talking about how I was going to get my act together,
right.
And I was gonna,

22
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.700
I was gonna start working clean on stage.
I was going to,
uh,

23
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.820
you know,
get my relationship with Christ going again.

24
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.470
Now I'm talking to that guy and fuck fucking forever.
We had a big falling out.

25
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.760
I mean,
that guy,
you know,
and I still feel like he owes me the apology.

26
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.980
I'm waiting for him to call,
you know,
wait for him to reach out.

27
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.270
But,
uh,
you know,
I can see that he's being a big baby about it.
So evidently,

28
00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:51.630
you know,
I'm going to have to be the bigger man,
you know,

29
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.650
I'm going to have to reach out.
Jesus,
if you could,

30
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.860
could you help me avoid the demon of the booze?
Um,

31
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.840
no,
I was good.
This,
this is how,

32
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.580
this is how much I've been eating and drinking like a fucking asshole.

33
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.060
I just shut everything down Sunday night and I lost four pounds this week,

34
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.880
you know,
just fucking,
and I even got hammered one night.

35
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.460
I was doing so well,
dude,
the 4th of July.

36

<v 0>you live in on goop and we wanted Kay.</v>

41
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.060
Oh Jesus.
Anyways,
on July 4th,

42
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.090
you know how many Burgers I had?
Zero.
How many hot dogs?
I had.

43
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.110
Zero.

44
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.920
You know how much alcohol I had zero until a couple came over.

45
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:16.120
I'm French.
You know,
they brought their kids over,
you know,
they had a little one.

46
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:17.960
Then they had one that was like seven,
eight years old.

47
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.550
He was a riot telling me knock knock jokes.
He was killing me,
killing me.

48
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.960
It's delivery was outstanding.
He was making up his own knock knock jokes,

49
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.710
but just the way he would do the deliver the punchline,
he'd be like,
um,

50
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.750
um,
okay.
I got one,
I got one.
He was just making them up on the spot.

51
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.010
He'd be like,
knock,
knock.
I'd be like,
who's there?
And He'd be like,
Liz,

52
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.150
I be like Liz,
who when?
It'd be like Liz to my music.

53
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.470
<v 5>Yeah,
I mean,
you come up with one on the spot,
those are easy.
Um,
anyways,</v>

54
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.460
so we ended up having an,
I had a great time,
but uh,
you know,

55
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.830
the guy brought over some beers,
so I'm like,
yeah,
these are cold.

56
00:04:01.831 --> 00:04:03.770
I got a couple of cores,
the cores,

57
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.510
like keying on the little grenade fucking bottles in the back.
I'm like,

58
00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:11.190
I'll have one.
So I have one,
they're only here for an hour.
Right.

59
00:04:11.191 --> 00:04:11.911
But what did I do?

60
00:04:11.911 --> 00:04:16.890
I sprinkled a little fairy dust on the demon in me and then the demon woke up
on,

61
00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:21.510
so like walk over to your borrower record,
shipped a cooler.
And I did,
you know,

62
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.680
big fucking square ice cube,
nice home poor.
And the bottle was almost empty.

63
00:04:25.681 --> 00:04:28.200
So I'm like,
well I gotta have another one and finish that one.
Nope.

64
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.130
Long story short,

65
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.210
one and a half of those plus the fucking cores and I'm downstairs in my bed

66
00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:36.190
talking gibberish to my wife.
Fudge.
My one point,
she just goes,
what?

67
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.760
<v 0>And I was like,
all right,
time to go to bed.
So I had one minor slip up.</v>

68
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.780
You know what have,
I think if you just did heroin once a week,

69
00:04:44.781 --> 00:04:48.230
that wouldn't be bad.
Right.
If you just did once,
you know,

70
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.100
maybe on the weekends he would want to be nodding off at work and if I be bad,

71
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.110
that'd be hilarious.
If you just stuck to your guns
and be like,
yeah,

72
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.030
<v 5>four out of five days,
I'm fucking on it.
One fucking day.</v>

73
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.690
I come in here with track marks,
nod off of my cubicle and all of a sudden,
oh,

74
00:05:05.691 --> 00:05:06.850
we need to have a meeting.

75
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.963
<v 0>Okay,</v>

76
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.510
<v 5>that's an 80% it's a B minus.</v>

77
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.170
Tell me your parents would ground you over a B minus.
They just say,

78
00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:19.770
get your grades up.
If this is a get your grades up conversation,

79
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.910
then I'm all about it,

80
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.070
but if you're going to start saying that you're going to fire me,

81
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.030
you're going to fire me over a B minus or a B minus.
Okay.

82
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.060
I'll get a fucking lawyer.
I'll sue the shit out of you.

83
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.040
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

84
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.491
<v 6>your honor.</v>

85
00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:37.380
My client was only doing heroin once a week.

86
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.960
Okay.
It was,
it was the middle of the week.
It was a Wednesday.
Okay.
Yuki came in,

87
00:05:42.961 --> 00:05:45.270
he crushed it on Monday and Tuesday.
Wednesday.

88
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.480
Admittedly he wasn't worth anything but Thursday and Friday,
right.

89
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.383
<v 0>Finish strong.</v>

90
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.820
<v 6>If we could equate this to way sports analogy,
he uh,
you know,
uh,
what uh,</v>

91
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.980
did,
uh,
when o for and the

92
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.350
<v 5>beginning of the third quarter.
But anyway,
he came out with a victory.</v>

93
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.800
<v 0>Sorry.
Um,
anyways.
Yes sir.
I lost four pounds his fucking week and um,</v>

94
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.580
I think I'm back on it.
I,
you know what,

95
00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:13.660
I have an acting gig coming up so I got to get down to my fighting weight.

96
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.800
Is Bob Pogo?
Um,

97
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.680
<v 5>yes.
Dave Kepner is Bob.
Pogo says my fighting weight is a one 72,</v>

98
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.990
so I can drop three a week.
It's in two weeks,
so I'll be down to like one 74,

99
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.910
three,
four,
something like that.

100
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.000
And then I'll just fucking wean the next two off while I do the shoot.

101
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.470
Now you go,
that's how it's done.

102
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.163
<v 0>All right.</v>

103
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.350
<v 5>Oh,
you fat actresses out there.
Fucking bitch.
More than a complete,
oh,</v>

104
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:42.260
it's so easy for a fucking guy.
We got our fighting weight too.

105
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.503
<v 0>You know,</v>

106
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.370
<v 5>so sick of that fucking myth that they put out.
A guy can look however he wants.</v>

107
00:06:48.371 --> 00:06:50.770
Now,
if you're a fat fuck,
you're going to play a fat fuck as a guy,

108
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.850
<v 0>okay?</v>

109
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.170
<v 5>It's just just what it is.
You're going to play a fat fuck in.</v>

110
00:06:56.171 --> 00:06:59.380
The jokes are going to be that you're a fat fuck,
okay?

111
00:06:59.381 --> 00:07:02.380
You're going to be doing it.
Chip and Dales dance with no shirt on.

112
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.390
You're going to be breaking Claffey tables.

113
00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:06.520
You'll be living in a van down by the river.

114
00:07:06.521 --> 00:07:10.090
You're going to be a mall cop that tries to slide behind a pole but doesn't

115
00:07:10.091 --> 00:07:12.100
quite make it because of the shape he's in.

116
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.680
<v 0>Okay?
I don't know what fucking movies you're watching.
Um,</v>

117
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.560
<v 5>and then the whole thing where they sit there and they go,
oh,
you know,</v>

118
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.980
I'm so sick of seeing these movies where there's these guys in these,

119
00:07:25.981 --> 00:07:29.220
these women,
you know,
the,
with women half of their fucking age.
Well,

120
00:07:29.221 --> 00:07:32.850
you know what that is,
is because you haven't traveled to where the money is.

121
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.040
<v 0>Go Down to Miami,</v>

122
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.500
<v 5>you know,
get out of it.
The ugly parts of the world,
like De Moines,
Iowa.
Okay,</v>

123
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.960
well come on.
You know,
you're ugly and if you're not ugly,

124
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.980
you're fucking planning an escape.
All the hot chicks move out at de Moines.

125
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.860
Where do they go?
Cash.
Cheyenne,
Wyoming.

126
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:51.923
<v 1>Uh,</v>

127
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.430
<v 5>yeah.
And then they meet some hot guy from Greeley and next scene.</v>

128
00:07:57.431 --> 00:07:59.080
Other than Denver growing some wheat.

129
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.780
<v 0>Greeley,
we're having a bad smell day</v>

130
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.220
anyways.
You know,
a friend of mine was just talking recently about this,

131
00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:12.430
this farm that they have,
uh,

132
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:17.170
they sponsored this farm summer somewhere out in England and they,
um,

133
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.670
they don't kill the cows when they stopped producing milk.

134
00:08:21.671 --> 00:08:25.780
They just let them kind of just get old.
It's really cool.

135
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.650
It's like a cool farm man.
They milked the cows by hand.

136
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.400
I think all farms should do that.
You know,
all farms should do that.

137
00:08:33.401 --> 00:08:35.650
And if there's,
you know,

138
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.760
if they can't keep up with the milk supply demand that,
you know,

139
00:08:39.761 --> 00:08:42.370
all that means is human beings will die.

140
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.440
And considering where the problem,
you know,

141
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.530
<v 5>I say as long as it's not me or anyone that I love,
I'm all for it.</v>

142
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:56.190
<v 1>Here's</v>

143
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.910
<v 5>some really fucked up.
Environmentally,
I started watching baseball again.</v>

144
00:08:58.911 --> 00:09:02.220
I finally gave in,
I bought the MLB package.
I'm so,
I'm all set now.

145
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.660
I got the center rice,
I got the fucking,
what's this?
What's,

146
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.250
they always got some dumb name.
They can't just say the NHL.

147
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:13.090
He gets the center ice,
the court's sad flood and 50 yard line,

148
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.700
whatever they call them.
Right.
I got the Bruins to patriots,
Celtics and red.

149
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:21.450
So I got the whole fucking thing.
It was my cable.
It just automatically renews,

150
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.760
which I love.
I usually don't like when it automatically renews.
Like,
Hey,
hey,

151
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:30.270
I make the decision now.
I don't give a shit.
I'm just like,
all right,
fine,

152
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.980
whatever.
Whatever.
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.
Um,

153
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.280
so I've been watching,
uh,
I watched that ranger series.

154
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.200
I didn't realize how many Red Sox,
I didn't know.

155
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.513
<v 7>Okay.</v>

156
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.170
<v 5>He's Mookie Betts and right</v>

157
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.010
Bradley Jacob Jr or something like that.

158
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.040
<v 7>Okay.</v>

159
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.120
<v 5>Bradley,
a,
a fucking Walmart Junior,
whatever the fuck his name is.
Milton Bradley.</v>

160
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.960
What's his name?
Some Bradley Jr.
I Dunno.

161
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.820
Then you've got Andrew a mighty you bought on the fucking left.

162
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.480
Zanda Bogue Dustin Pedroia.
I don't know a lot of them.

163
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:14.670
Um,
anyway,
so I'm going to start watching them and watching the Yankees too.

164
00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:18.150
Cause Aaron Jug.
Aaron Judge looks like a fucking myth,
doesn't he?

165
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:20.730
He looks like one of those fucking things when they talk about baseball in the

166
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:25.620
early 19 hundreds.
You don't need those giant fucking,
you know,

167
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:29.040
elephant Titus of the fucking hand gloves that they used to play with,

168
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.463
you know?

169
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.150
<v 7>Okay.</v>

170
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.590
<v 5>Guy's fucking amazing.
I Dunno what's going on though,
but I,</v>

171
00:10:35.591 --> 00:10:38.540
I think baseball's numbers are down.
I think they do something whenever they,

172
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.660
whenever the fucking numbers go down,
I believe that they juice up the ball.

173
00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.320
They got to do something.
I mean,
it's just all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

174
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.140
everybody just starts cranking all these fucking home runs and this guy's on

175
00:10:48.141 --> 00:10:51.860
pace to hit like 60.
Um,

176
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:53.580
<v 7>okay.</v>

177
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.300
<v 5>But anyways,</v>

178
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.920
I been not just sitting there recording the games were in Tampa tonight.
Right.

179
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:01.121
We started,
you know,

180
00:11:01.121 --> 00:11:04.780
what happened was I went did that big papi roast and then I went to the game and

181
00:11:04.781 --> 00:11:08.440
then I just got back into it.
I was like,
Oh yeah,
I fucking love this game.

182
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.970
I forgot about that.
Um,
and I think we went to a

183
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.490
Toronto,
that's where I went to Toronto,
won that series,
went to a,

184
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:22.730
<v 7>yeah,</v>

185
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.590
<v 5>rangers.
Right?
Texas means this is what I want to stand.</v>

186
00:11:24.591 --> 00:11:29.591
This is what the fuck I was trying to get to was I'm watching the fucking Texas

187
00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:34.700
Rangers.
They had that amazing ballpark.
I went there,

188
00:11:34.701 --> 00:11:35.534
I sat up,

189
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.870
I sat in the outfield because I wanted to have the opportunity to run out on the

190
00:11:38.871 --> 00:11:42.740
grass to try to get one of those home runs,
you know?
And um,

191
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.200
<v 7>okay.</v>

192
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.590
<v 5>I've just found out that fucking ballpark.
It's not even 25 years old.</v>

193
00:11:47.591 --> 00:11:49.390
They're already,
they're already knocking it down.

194
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:50.870
<v 7>Okay.</v>

195
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.610
<v 5>All that concrete,
all of that shit,
all of that fucking stuff.</v>

196
00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.070
Somebody please do a documentary and follow the dump trucks and just show up.

197
00:12:01.071 --> 00:12:04.970
Where does that go?
What are they gonna do with all that fucking,

198
00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.540
it's fine.
It's fucking fine.
Like,
well,
you know,

199
00:12:08.541 --> 00:12:12.320
gets really hot out here in the summer and we need a fucking room.

200
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.380
It gets hot out here in the summer because of us.

201
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.570
We're a fucking plague.

202
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:20.980
<v 7>Okay.</v>

203
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.820
<v 5>Jesus Christ.
You already fucking Yag doll led shit out of the Goddamn ground.</v>

204
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:26.440
Now you just going to throw it out.

205
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.840
You gotta throw it in the fucking ocean and build another one.

206
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.103
<v 0>I don't know.</v>

207
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.050
<v 5>They're doing that in Atlanta.
Atlanta has a fucking ballpark.</v>

208
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:40.000
That thing's not more than 25 years old now.
Like,
well,
you knew our fan base.

209
00:12:40.001 --> 00:12:41.530
Each gs too far.
Right?

210
00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.810
<v 8>Damn.
Damn Udo.
Well Raylee</v>

211
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:52.250
<v 5>right.
They got to bring it out to where the white people are white people,</v>

212
00:12:52.251 --> 00:12:55.820
white people.
You don't have to do it.

213
00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.250
I'm going to move it out to the where the white people are.

214
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.120
You know what the problem is?
Is Atlanta Braves fans fucking suck.

215
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:05.270
<v 7>Okay.</v>

216
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.280
<v 5>They just,
they don't,
it's not even that they suck.</v>

217
00:13:07.281 --> 00:13:10.940
It's just they've had the ball yanked out from underneath them a Zillion fucking

218
00:13:10.941 --> 00:13:14.540
times.
They got Charlie Brown.
Okay.
And then,
you know,

219
00:13:14.541 --> 00:13:18.500
after that last fucking Superbowl,
if you think these,
these,
these,
these fucking,

220
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.580
I mean,
if I was the president,
I would declare Atlanta a fucking disaster area.

221
00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.150
If I was in Georgia.

222
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.310
<v 0>All right?
I would just watch college sports.
Ibm,
them,</v>

223
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.700
Georgia bulldogs.
That's what I would do.
Georgia tech,

224
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.620
university of Georgia.

225
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.240
<v 5>I love [inaudible].
I'm,</v>

226
00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.250
and I didn't want o go to come over and just slobbering my fucking hand.

227
00:13:47.251 --> 00:13:50.920
I'll go home and Jericho up to the Vlog and Georgia bulldogs.
Um,
I would go,

228
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.990
that's disgusting.
I will fucking,
I would be into that shit.

229
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.660
<v 0>So evidently they feel that not enough black people come out.
I have no idea.</v>

230
00:13:59.661 --> 00:14:01.160
This is just what people from Atlanta told me.

231
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:06.190
They don't feel enough black people come out or white people are too afraid to

232
00:14:06.981 --> 00:14:11.210
drive their Chrysler town and country countries and as she loves into the

233
00:14:11.211 --> 00:14:14.200
greater Atlanta area,
um,

234
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.180
<v 5>to go to a fucking baseball game.
I have no idea.</v>

235
00:14:18.181 --> 00:14:23.181
So they're just abandoning that fucking major league ballpark that some like

236
00:14:23.281 --> 00:14:26.370
college team is now going to play their baseball games and it's fucking

237
00:14:26.371 --> 00:14:27.960
ridiculous.
And then they're going to build another one.

238
00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.253
<v 0>MMM.</v>

239
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:32.881
<v 5>I don't know.</v>

240
00:14:32.881 --> 00:14:36.330
I think you should have to be in a ballpark for at least 50 fucking years,
right?

241
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.070
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

242
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.020
<v 5>I,
I'll be honest with you.
I couldn't believe how old those were.</v>

243
00:14:40.021 --> 00:14:43.220
I thought they made those in like in the year 2000.

244
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:48.270
I thought they made them 2000 to meet him like 94 or something like that.
So,

245
00:14:48.271 --> 00:14:51.000
um,
I dunno.
Who Cares?
You know who gives a fuck?

246
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.110
Just keep yanking the shit out of the fucking ground building.
Shit.

247
00:14:54.111 --> 00:14:56.960
Rip It down and throw it in the ocean.

248
00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:58.420
<v 7>Okay.</v>

249
00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.730
<v 5>And then blame people with red ties or blue Tyson.</v>

250
00:15:00.731 --> 00:15:03.550
Then we'll just continue doing,
what the fuck would this depressing bill.

251
00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:07.420
This is fucking depressing.
All right.
How about some good news?

252
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.130
I have some of the best news I've gotten in a long time.
A long time.

253
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:17.380
All right.
You're ready for this.
The Indianapolis Colts got caught.
Cheating.

254
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.690
Got caught cheating again.

255
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:21.280
<v 7>Okay.</v>

256
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.630
<v 5>It's fucking on.
It's,
it's hilarious.
It's fucking hilarious.</v>

257
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:30.280
How many of these fucking things that these guys do and how little attention

258
00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:35.200
those clients at ESPN pay attention to the ship,

259
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:39.310
the level of fucking focus on spy gate,
the flight gate,

260
00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:44.260
all of this fucking shit.
They're not even going to do a story on ESPN like,

261
00:15:44.261 --> 00:15:45.041
Hey,
wait a minute.

262
00:15:45.041 --> 00:15:50.020
We spent two and a half years on fucking deflate gate because the owner of a

263
00:15:50.021 --> 00:15:53.710
team that's gotten caught pumping and crowd noise,

264
00:15:55.550 --> 00:16:00.550
fucking haven't hearing aids now I guess in the helmets because Peyton manning

265
00:16:01.011 --> 00:16:04.250
was an or new quarterback and hadn't mastered the silent count.

266
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:09.560
The dude who caught the underinflated fucking ball got busted doing roids.

267
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:11.010
<v 7>Okay.</v>

268
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.600
<v 5>They stole our fucking offense.
I mean did they?</v>

269
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.700
<v 7>Yeah,</v>

270
00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.670
<v 5>they get it.
They're owners sat on the competition committee.</v>

271
00:16:18.671 --> 00:16:21.850
It changes the rules of passing to tip it in his favorite so they could beat the

272
00:16:21.851 --> 00:16:25.930
Patriots.
It's fucking unbelief.
This is a thing.
I'm not mad at any of that.

273
00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:28.670
<v 7>Okay.</v>

274
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.330
<v 5>Do you like does that make Indian it does that really make them win the fucking</v>

275
00:16:32.331 --> 00:16:35.180
game?
Cause they have hearing aids and they're fucking helmets.

276
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.080
I think that's fucking hilarious.
All right.

277
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.250
And I think it's the job of the league to try to catch those people doing it.

278
00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:45.200
And when people get caught,
I just laugh.

279
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:46.740
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

280
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.450
<v 5>Corked bats.
All of that Shit's funny.
Steroids is the one thing.</v>

281
00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:57.790
Steroids,
that's the one for me that I feel that's the biggest thing.

282
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:03.250
You know,
pumping in crowd noise,
hearing aids,
taking a cons.

283
00:17:03.251 --> 00:17:07.630
Hair where the air out of a ball trying to steal signs.

284
00:17:07.631 --> 00:17:11.200
Jesus Christ.
Everybody fucking,
but that shit's hilarious to me.

285
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.090
And those are some of the best stories that you hear.

286
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.850
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

287
00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:18.050
<v 5>When you listen to a pro athletes,</v>

288
00:17:18.051 --> 00:17:20.750
half their fucking funny stories are about guys cheating.

289
00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.430
You send me time to ref.
Wait,
it's got to keep punching me in the boss.

290
00:17:25.431 --> 00:17:27.840
I'm just like,
dude,
what the fuck?
By the third quarter,

291
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:29.600
my balls are the size of my fucking head.

292
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.840
So I turned around and I kick him in the nuts from behind.

293
00:17:32.841 --> 00:17:36.110
I get his tank is fucking asshole.
Like every one of them,
you go to a banquet,

294
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.080
all of their fucking stories are about the shit that they did to each other when

295
00:17:39.081 --> 00:17:43.430
the refs weren't looking.
Um,
my only one is steroids.

296
00:17:43.431 --> 00:17:46.550
That's the only one I give a fuck about.
If you get caught using steroids,

297
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.320
just because that,
um,
you know,

298
00:17:50.321 --> 00:17:53.920
and that doesn't make you throw the ball farther or see it better or get bad

299
00:17:53.921 --> 00:17:58.750
speed or any of that shit.
It just keeps you feeling brand fucking new.

300
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.990
You're going up there like you got eight hours sleep,

301
00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.300
like you never got tackled in your life.

302
00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.750
Like you never got hit on the rib cage by a fast ball.
It just,

303
00:18:07.751 --> 00:18:10.400
you like a fucking x man.
That's the one.

304
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:15.180
<v 0>Um,
Dan,
I look at it like what the fuck?</v>

305
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.010
But I also,
I also understand it.

306
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.640
I mean cause at least in football,

307
00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.140
<v 7>okay.</v>

308
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.260
<v 5>Like what those guys do to their bodies and what happens to their brains at the</v>

309
00:18:25.261 --> 00:18:28.470
very least.
I mean,
I think they ought to be able to heal up like x men.

310
00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.750
I think they ought to be able to smoke weed.

311
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:36.150
<v 0>You know,
at a state level so they don't get in trouble.
Um,</v>

312
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.830
<v 7>that's the only thing.
Um,</v>

313
00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.980
<v 5>but this is the thing,
Colt.
I don't think Peyton Manning's a cheater.</v>

314
00:18:44.981 --> 00:18:46.600
I don't think the cults of fucking cheaters.

315
00:18:46.601 --> 00:18:50.440
I think it's fucking hilarious that you got caught doing that just because your

316
00:18:50.441 --> 00:18:52.180
owner is a cunt.

317
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:53.380
<v 7>Okay.</v>

318
00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.790
<v 5>He's such a fucking content.</v>

319
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.870
I can't believe that ESPN is just gonna fucking ignore this story.

320
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:00.660
<v 7>Yeah,</v>

321
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.470
<v 5>they're just ignoring the thing.
Quick little blurb.
Bing,
Bang,
boom.
Done.</v>

322
00:19:04.471 --> 00:19:05.460
See you later.

323
00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:06.720
<v 7>Okay.</v>

324
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.640
<v 5>There's no,
Hey,
wait a minute.</v>

325
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.770
<v 7>Okay.</v>

326
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:14.220
<v 5>The whole time this guy was saying by the,
bear me while he's doing this,</v>

327
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.520
I mean,
Jesus Christ,
ESPN has dog days of summer.

328
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.250
God knows you got to fill up some fucking airtime

329
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.090
as a patriots fan.

330
00:19:23.091 --> 00:19:26.900
Can you at least have Bob Lee do some fucking outside the line?
Shit.

331
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.660
<v 0>They won't do it.
They won't fucking do whatever.
What are you going to do?</v>

332
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:33.530
I love it though.

333
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.490
I love it because to this day I still get shit when I was up in,
um,

334
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:41.240
when I was up in Porchester fucking giant fans,

335
00:19:41.241 --> 00:19:44.600
giant fans who had former great giants talk about fucking cheating all the time,

336
00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:48.800
all the shit that they do with like,
like this fucking Guy Jeremy Mercy

337
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.730
<v 5>succeeded because he in his own way tainted.</v>

338
00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.180
<v 7>Okay.</v>

339
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:54.430
<v 5>Uh,</v>

340
00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:59.020
the Patriots when they did absolutely nothing more than anybody else's fucking

341
00:19:59.021 --> 00:20:00.280
dual,
which is basically

342
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.720
fucking grab as bullshit and they're acting like they're fucking,
yeah,

343
00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.920
<v 0>I dunno.
I Dunno.</v>

344
00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.560
<v 5>I Dunno.
I don't get it.
I don't fucking get it.
You know what?
I just Tom Brady,</v>

345
00:20:12.561 --> 00:20:13.880
he's just too good looking.

346
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.270
If Tom Brady look like Peyton Manning,
I'm telling you right now,
this will,

347
00:20:20.271 --> 00:20:22.910
and we weren't winning championships.
It wouldn't be a fucking story,

348
00:20:22.911 --> 00:20:23.744
but whatever.

349
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:28.490
All I know is I got another round of ammunition that I can put in the gun any

350
00:20:28.491 --> 00:20:32.380
fucking time.
Anybody speaks up,
uh,

351
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.960
about the Patriots cheat?
Nah.
What do you think about the Indianapolis Colts?

352
00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:38.043
<v 7>Huh?</v>

353
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:42.150
<v 5>Hey,
how do you feel about the,
uh,
the Falcons or the,
uh,
the Vikings?</v>

354
00:20:42.151 --> 00:20:44.080
What do you think about those guys?
Uh,

355
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.170
what do you think about the Pittsburgh Steelers?

356
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.980
What do you think about the New York football giants?
What do you think about AI?

357
00:20:50.981 --> 00:20:52.930
You don't think anything about that?
You know why?

358
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.780
Because Espn didn't tell you to think anything about it.

359
00:20:55.781 --> 00:21:00.580
You fucking buffalo wild wings,
mouth breathe,
and five let it go below,

360
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.470
right area.
Anyways,

361
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.730
a buddy of mine was just brought up that Conor McGregor Mayweather fight again

362
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.170
and uh,
it was fucking hilarious.
He goes,
you don't think Mcgregor has a chance?

363
00:21:11.171 --> 00:21:13.270
And I'm just like,
I think he's,
you know,
I told him I got him.

364
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.160
I think he's had an unbelievable disadvantage.

365
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:16.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

366
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.330
<v 5>You know what I mean?
He's like a,
he's like a fucking swimmer and a,</v>

367
00:21:21.331 --> 00:21:24.000
this is like a,
I don't know,
that's a bad analogy.
I don't know what it is.

368
00:21:24.001 --> 00:21:26.070
I told you the analogy,
it's like fucking Tom Brady,

369
00:21:26.071 --> 00:21:29.550
Jerry race at the height of their fucking careers.

370
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.720
Let's use a better football player by seeing who can throw the football further

371
00:21:33.721 --> 00:21:38.250
and more accurate.
That's the only level of competition.
So this guy's gone.

372
00:21:38.251 --> 00:21:39.840
You don't think he's got a chance.
He goes,

373
00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:42.960
look at his boxing in this and he shows me a fucking MMA fight.

374
00:21:42.961 --> 00:21:46.770
The guy throws like three punches and then a fly in fucking knee and takes the

375
00:21:46.771 --> 00:21:49.270
guy to the ground.
It's just like,
dude,
that's not boxing.
Yeah.

376
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:51.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

377
00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:51.883
<v 5>All right.</v>

378
00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:56.980
World class championship boxers could not lay a fucking glove on this guy.

379
00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.500
These not going to be able to land a fucking,
I don't know.

380
00:21:59.501 --> 00:22:00.610
He's an Atlanta glove on them.

381
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.640
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

382
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.460
<v 5>The only change,
the only thing he has is if Mayweather,</v>

383
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:09.590
I dunno,
in the last,

384
00:22:09.591 --> 00:22:14.591
whenever the last time you fought was he just got old like Jordan between the

385
00:22:15.321 --> 00:22:16.790
Bulls and the wizards.

386
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:21.470
Like he just had a noticeable fucking drop off and you can somehow rough the guy

387
00:22:21.471 --> 00:22:25.400
up.
And I know Mayweather's hands are fucked up from all the years of fucking

388
00:22:25.401 --> 00:22:26.690
punching guys in the head.

389
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.613
<v 1>MMM.</v>

390
00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:34.810
<v 5>Well maybe he can fucking somehow getting Mayweather his ego and to like,</v>

391
00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:39.430
you can talk enough shit that MMA is a superior sport

392
00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:41.840
that may,
what is it?

393
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.970
Gonna wanna knock 'em out and maybe he comes in and do and for the first time in

394
00:22:45.971 --> 00:22:49.810
his career does something stupid.
I just don't see it happen.
And um,

395
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.890
I said that I hate this fight cause I know I'm going to order it.
But um,

396
00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:58.980
after the debate with him and watching him sending me an MMA clip to show me how

397
00:22:59.171 --> 00:23:00.630
good this guy was at boxing,
yeah.

398
00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.013
<v 1>MMM.</v>

399
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.410
<v 5>I'm now,
but I don't think I'm going to order the fucking thing.
I'm gonna wait,</v>

400
00:23:07.411 --> 00:23:11.550
I'm gonna wait to people call me up and it in,
I mean wait for text of like,

401
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:15.030
Oh shit,
capital letters 10 I'll order it.

402
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.290
Or if they guy was a complete fucking waste of money,

403
00:23:18.291 --> 00:23:21.980
then I'll just laugh at them.
I'll probably,
we'll order it,
I'm going to order it.

404
00:23:21.981 --> 00:23:24.830
God Damn fucking Shit.
I'm going to order it.

405
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:26.840
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

406
00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.790
<v 5>I'm going to give Mayweather another hundred,
you know,
but your fucking money,</v>

407
00:23:28.791 --> 00:23:29.624
that guy owes me.

408
00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:35.610
Watch him fight Manny Pacquiao fucking 10 11 years after when he should have.

409
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:40.770
Although I actually,
I mean I thought that that guy was on something,
you know,

410
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:42.690
you know,
I know cause I'm not in the fight game.

411
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:46.820
Anytime a guy just keeps moving up in weight class and he just keeps getting

412
00:23:46.821 --> 00:23:49.100
stronger.
I mean is,
is that possible?

413
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.260
I moved up in weight class.
I went up to him with you a buck 90.

414
00:23:54.261 --> 00:23:57.800
I didn't get any faster.
Um,
anyways,

415
00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.600
let's read some fucking advertising here.
Um,

416
00:24:00.601 --> 00:24:03.950
and then I have to go into the writer's room for season three of F is for
family.

417
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:09.950
Oh boy,
another 10 episodes.
Um,

418
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.370
and I am being a fucking angel,

419
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.510
an angel as far as my eating in that writer's room.
Nothing.

420
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.840
Nothing will fuck you over like sitting in a goddamn writer's room.

421
00:24:20.841 --> 00:24:25.841
You sitting on your ass all fucking day and his candy and chips and chips and

422
00:24:26.811 --> 00:24:31.400
candy and pizza and fucking burgers and fries.
I mean,

423
00:24:31.401 --> 00:24:36.200
it is,
it is.
It's fucking,
you might as well be sitting in a crack house.

424
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:41.330
Um,
this K,
here's my diet.
All right,
here at for me,

425
00:24:41.331 --> 00:24:44.270
I feel like this works.
All right.
I have oatmeal,

426
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.420
third of a cup of oatmeal with a Bernina.
Right.

427
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.960
A little bit of milk in there to cool off the fucking,
the the fucking,

428
00:24:50.961 --> 00:24:53.510
I don't know what it was in.
Fuck you guys with the steel cut oats.

429
00:24:53.511 --> 00:24:55.250
I don't give a shit.
This works for me.
All right.

430
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.280
Then I have two eggs all week and that's it.
Right.

431
00:24:58.281 --> 00:25:01.400
Then between lunch and breakfast,
I have an orange,
that's it.

432
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:06.620
And then for lunch I have some sad fucking salad with the protein,
no bread.

433
00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.010
And then I just crush waters.
I leave around five,

434
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:12.410
I got to eat something else in the afternoon.
I don't know what.

435
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:17.440
And then I come home and I have a salad with a protein and I do a half hour of

436
00:25:17.441 --> 00:25:21.620
cardio and a,
that's it.
The fat has nowhere to hide.

437
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.920
It's like a fucking roach when you turn the lights on it,
it's just phrases.

438
00:25:24.921 --> 00:25:28.880
It doesn't know what to do.
And then it's dead.
That's it.
Um,

439
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.700
and I just have to,
what I have to do is I have to stick with this.

440
00:25:31.701 --> 00:25:36.650
So I'm down to just under one ATM,
a buck 79 and change.

441
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.300
So this time next week I want when I'm in fucking grand rapids,
Michigan,

442
00:25:41.301 --> 00:25:43.820
during my favorite fucking gigs in the country,

443
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:48.200
the Fountain Street fucking Church,
um,

444
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.550
I'm doing some fun gigs coming up by the way.
Uh,

445
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:57.470
I want to be one 76 next week is what I'm saying.
Um,
but uh,
I got a,

446
00:25:57.471 --> 00:26:00.350
I'm playing that fucking venue,
that buddy Holly,

447
00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.920
the big bopper and Ritchie Valens all played the night.

448
00:26:03.921 --> 00:26:07.970
They died flying into the same fucking airport.
I know you guys are saying,
aw,

449
00:26:07.971 --> 00:26:10.130
Geez,
Bell,
don't judge your work.
No,
no,

450
00:26:10.131 --> 00:26:13.670
because we actually have de icing exists.

451
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.030
They did not have that right.
Legal Zoom,
everybody.

452
00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.350
Now that kid is going to be like in a November,
right?

453
00:26:22.351 --> 00:26:24.020
And it's not on sale yet as far as I know.
All right.

454
00:26:24.021 --> 00:26:28.640
Legal Zoom in order to successfully run your own business attention to detail is

455
00:26:28.641 --> 00:26:31.910
so critical.
One contract slip up,

456
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.170
one contract slip up or legal misunderstanding can really set you back.

457
00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:41.270
Fortunately,
there's legal zoom.
You may already know that over a million,
billion,

458
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.790
billion,
billion Americans have used legal zoom to start their business,

459
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.840
but legal zoom services go well beyond business formation.

460
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:53.870
They built a nationwide network of independent attorneys who can provide legal

461
00:26:54.241 --> 00:26:57.540
answers to the day to day questions you have about your business.

462
00:26:57.541 --> 00:27:00.750
What the fuck is this man?
Because let's face it,

463
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:06.030
things like trade Max employment laws and lease agreements can get pretty

464
00:27:06.031 --> 00:27:09.120
complicated,
so no waste.
Your valuable time trying to wrap you up.

465
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.190
Simple little head around,
all the fine print.

466
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:16.320
Use Legal Zoom for that so you can focus on growing your business.
Instead,

478
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:11.090
what's the first thing you put on and the last thing you take off?
Huh?

479
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:14.460
It's not your socks.
Your fucking Weirdo.
It's your underwear.

Make your most important piece of clothing the best it can be with me undies.

Me undies are designed in La and made from sustainably sourced that micro modal.

484
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:35.040
Modal,
a fabric three times softer than cotton.

485
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.970
You know what?
I think my stomach's three times softer than micro

486
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:44.960
me undies softer than soft.

487
00:28:44.961 --> 00:28:49.100
Luxury undies comes in an ever changing selection of classic colors.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.440
Bold shades.
What are classic colors?

489
00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.470
Does that like your first box of crayons where you just have the eight colors,

490
00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.350
bold shades and adventurous patterns.

So you can tailor your undies to your own personal style.
And guess what?

492

494
00:29:07.191 --> 00:29:09.170
This is great monthly subscription.
You know,

495
00:29:09.171 --> 00:29:11.900
you keep dressing up your junk in a different way.

496
00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.240
It seems new to your wife,
right?
All of a sudden she's dropping to her knees,

497
00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.320
putting her Edith Wharton book on the fucking nightstand going to town.

498
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.641
And guess what?

499

You can save time and money each month with a monthly subscription.

508
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:58.860
how about those fucking Celtics de de de de de de de de

509
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:00.250
<v 9>age.
Age.
Age.</v>

510
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.700
<v 5>Age is a word that Larry Bird.
Bird bird by days at wired.
Um,</v>

511
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:10.510
he's making some fucking moves.
I guess we're going after this.
Gordon Haywood,

512
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:15.220
everybody thinks he's a great fit for the Boston Celtics because one,

513
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:19.810
he's a great player too.
He played for coach Brad Stevens at Butler and three,

514
00:30:19.811 --> 00:30:23.500
he's fucking right.
Why?
Why,
why?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

515
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:27.810
Celtics love of white guys still love a white guy.
Boop,

516
00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:34.300
boop,
boop,
boop.
I don't know what it is.
The Celtics,

517
00:30:34.301 --> 00:30:38.770
they just have to have the white guy.
I watched this.
We played Utah.

518
00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:42.820
I didn't see what the big fucking deal was.
Everybody sleeping.
Oh my God.
Go.

519
00:30:42.821 --> 00:30:44.710
This guy is fucking unreal.

520
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.440
These white like me.
Um,
Jason Tatum,

521
00:30:50.441 --> 00:30:52.330
we got Jason Tatum drive,
drafted him.

522
00:30:52.331 --> 00:30:54.970
I saw him play at Duke last year against Carolina.
You know,

523
00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:57.640
I think he's a great fit for the Celtics.
You know,

524
00:30:57.641 --> 00:31:01.090
we used to get played at Duke under coach k is an absolute beast in a,

525
00:31:01.091 --> 00:31:05.670
appears to be at least taf white.
He's light skinned.
Good.
There you go.

526
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:06.930
That's Celtics like dead.

527
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.860
I'm fucking with you guys.

528
00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.970
Look at fucking daddy age becoming like a fucking red Arrow back.

529
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.320
Junior's got all these draft picks.
He's fucking wheeling.
He's dealing,

530
00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:23.210
you know what?
I want to see him do.
I want to see him light up a fucking sick.

531
00:31:23.211 --> 00:31:25.320
You can't do it any more.
Light up a fucking cigar.

532
00:31:25.321 --> 00:31:28.380
When we're up by 20 in the fourth quarter,
just light it up.

533
00:31:28.381 --> 00:31:31.230
It's fucking over red.
Our back used to do that on the bench.

534
00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:37.250
I mean just one of the biggest shit talkers ever without having to say one word.

535
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:43.990
Oh my God.
How bad did people want to beat that guy?
Um,

536
00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.570
all right.
Anyways,
that's going to be the podcast for this week.
Oh,
you know what?

537
00:31:47.571 --> 00:31:50.570
I bought some new symbols.
I got a bunch of new symbols.

538
00:31:50.571 --> 00:31:53.880
I finally get the jazz ride that I wanted.
I still fucking suck,

539
00:31:53.881 --> 00:31:57.020
but my simple sound great.
And um,

540
00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.340
I'm still my,
my Gretsch kit that I ordered.
I ordered it and may,

541
00:32:01.341 --> 00:32:04.580
they said it take two and a half months.
So it's been a month and a half.
So,
uh,

542
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:09.770
it should be here at any moment now,
Bill,
it should be here in another month.

543
00:32:09.771 --> 00:32:10.940
If you do the math,
whatever.

544
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:15.500
I know what's going to happen when I fucking leave to New York and I go to do

545
00:32:15.501 --> 00:32:18.320
the acting gig.
That's when it's going to fucking show up.
Murphy's law.

546
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:20.810
And then I'm going to come here and they'll be like,
sorry we missed you.

547
00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:25.120
And they're going to be like,
we don't know where the drum kit is.
Uh,
you know,
we,

548
00:32:25.121 --> 00:32:26.420
we set it down right?

549
00:32:26.421 --> 00:32:30.260
And then I'm going to fucking see some street performer with my fucking Gretsch

550
00:32:30.261 --> 00:32:32.780
kit and I'm going to know it's mine cause it's going to have three floor times.

551
00:32:32.781 --> 00:32:36.380
Like fucking doesn't,
not,
couldn't one rack Tom,
three floor toms,

552
00:32:36.381 --> 00:32:38.870
the triangle of death to my,

553
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:44.090
<v 0>um,
I'm already going to order another rack,
Tom.
I think,
uh,</v>

554
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.170
I'm just doing everything I can to have a different fucking set up so I can get

555
00:32:48.171 --> 00:32:51.800
out of my 30 year fucking John Bonham

556
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:56.270
vortex that I went down and,
um,

557
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:58.820
I've been playing the double pedal.

558
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:04.610
I've been playing a double paddle to Primus in a,
in a little bit of pant.
Tara,

559
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:10.070
I'm just doing whatever I can listen to the lung and then slowing it down and

560
00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:14.430
fucking trying to get my shit up to speed and,

561
00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:17.750
and I'd been listening to like 1950s miles Davis.

562
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:19.930
Typical me fucking add

563
00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:21.280
<v 5>all over the map.
Why,</v>

564
00:33:21.281 --> 00:33:25.540
why work at one of those things at one time so you can actually get something

565
00:33:25.541 --> 00:33:29.260
down bill when you can work with at all of it at once.

566
00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:33.940
All of it at once.
All right.
Whatever.
I'm having to put the fucking,
I mean,

567
00:33:33.941 --> 00:33:36.580
I'm not putting pro Dharma,
you know,
not going to be recording anything.

568
00:33:36.581 --> 00:33:41.520
So who gives a fuck?
I'm going to record anything ever.
Yeah.

569
00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.980
Although,
you know,
I've been doing the,
I did that video,

570
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.550
that Sunday video podcast.

571
00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:50.760
I had a great time doing that.
I'm going to do those every once in a while.

572
00:33:50.761 --> 00:33:51.990
Maybe one of these times

573
00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:57.370
<v 0>I'll fucking,
I'll do like a Nah,</v>

574
00:33:57.371 --> 00:34:01.690
I can't do a draw to a little clip.
I'll put a little clip up.

575
00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:03.653
<v 7>MMM.</v>

576
00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:08.640
<v 5>I got to do a drum cover of like one of the worst songs ever and then just be</v>

577
00:34:08.641 --> 00:34:11.460
sitting there cause it has to,
I have to somehow make you laugh,
right.

578
00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:13.410
I can't just do a drum cover and be like,
yeah bill.

579
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:16.530
Well I don't understand what the purpose of that was.
What am I watching?

580
00:34:16.531 --> 00:34:19.560
The banana splits is like fucking danger island going to come on next.

581
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.133
<v 7>MMM.</v>

582
00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.680
<v 0>Oh maybe I'll just do one behind the drum kit.</v>

583
00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:27.590
<v 7>Okay.</v>

584
00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:30.380
<v 0>I'll just talk shit for fucking half hour and then the second I'm done,</v>

585
00:34:30.381 --> 00:34:33.140
I can play drums.
Maybe that's how I do it.

586
00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:36.140
And I act like I'm going to play drums but then I never do.

587
00:34:36.910 --> 00:34:40.490
And then you like bill,
what the fuck?
And I'll just be like,
no,
what the fuck you,

588
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:45.260
because I made you watch until the end.
I'm like,
Bill,

589
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:47.090
Bill and beer right now I'm playing a mind game.

590
00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:53.600
<v 5>We have to play mind games with people.
Um,
is that what you did bill?</v>

591
00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.331
I think you just waited.

592
00:34:55.331 --> 00:34:57.860
Two people left the ground and he took their fucking legs out from underneath

593
00:34:57.861 --> 00:34:59.150
them.
I didn't realize that that was some,

594
00:34:59.151 --> 00:35:02.510
still was a whole [inaudible] level of mental shit going on there.

595
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:06.560
I thought you just understood gravity and somebody being vulnerable.
All right,

596
00:35:06.561 --> 00:35:11.360
that's the podcast.
Go fuck yourselves.
Uh,
God bless the Indianapolis Colts.

597
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:14.600
Not everybody having been through this as a patriots fan,

598
00:35:14.601 --> 00:35:19.310
I want you to be nice to those colts fans.
Do not call them cheaters.

599
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:20.720
It isn't fair.

600
00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:25.870
<v 0>Um,
fucking hearing aids status.
Hilarious.</v>

601
00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:30.490
Could they talk to each other?
Do you realize how fucking funny that is?

602
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:32.020
<v 7>Okay.</v>

603
00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:35.260
<v 5>And that you're sitting there and your offensive line coach comes in.
I listen.</v>

604
00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.340
This kid ain't fucking making it.
He doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.

605
00:35:38.341 --> 00:35:39.080
We're going to get her ass.

606
00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.850
Is this going to be allowed building or I just put these fucking things in.

607
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:45.510
Anything.
Any one of them sat that going like,
but coach,

608
00:35:45.511 --> 00:35:46.980
isn't that against the rules?

609
00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.670
<v 0>That's fucking hilarious.
I love that they did that.</v>

610
00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:57.410
That's one of my favorite things about sports
is that shit.

611
00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:02.780
Somebody with Vaseline under their fucking,
that guy had the shit on his neck.

612
00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:04.070
It's just fucking funny.

613
00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.460
<v 5>And then everybody judges him.
Like,</v>

614
00:36:10.461 --> 00:36:14.450
you never drove in the car pool lane without another person in the car.
Right?

615
00:36:14.451 --> 00:36:16.040
You never cheated on a test.

616
00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.240
You never fucked around on your girlfriend or your boyfriend,
you know,

617
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:20.960
fucked around and your taxes.

618
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.983
<v 0>Huh?</v>

619
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.540
<v 5>You never cut in line.
We're all fucking cheaters.</v>

620
00:36:26.541 --> 00:36:31.520
You constant fucking holier than thou douche bags.
All right.

621
00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:34.650
Um,
anyways,
I mean,
look,
it is,

622
00:36:34.651 --> 00:36:38.930
unless you do like steroids or like you're making somebody,
you know,

623
00:36:38.931 --> 00:36:41.840
you're fucking somebody over on a house and then they're upside down in the

624
00:36:41.841 --> 00:36:44.930
house and you fucked them over for life.
And then there's senior citizens,

625
00:36:44.931 --> 00:36:46.340
they have to eat out Paul.
That's when,

626
00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:50.870
that's when you got to step in and do something.
But other than that,
you know,

627
00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:53.630
you bust somebody and then you fucking laugh at him.
You know,

628
00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:58.420
<v 10>you never cheated on your diet.
Your fucking spouse walks in.</v>

629
00:36:58.421 --> 00:37:00.360
Did you got to fucking spoonful?

630
00:37:00.361 --> 00:37:04.570
The ice cream is your corked bat right in your fucking mouth.
All right,

631
00:37:04.571 --> 00:37:08.130
go fuck yourselves.
I have a great weekend.
Your cons and I love,

632
00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.393
I'll see you on Monday.

633
00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.560
<v 11>Sure.</v>

634
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.750

And MMP is all capitalized solar power.

640
00:38:39.521 --> 00:38:44.521
Everybody can I take five minutes just to be a fucking hippie man.

641
00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:50.910
Um,
every once in a while I go in and out of my fucking,
you know,

642
00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.200
um,
with the team and now and then,
and then I'm against the team,
you know,

643
00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:00.690
kind of like a fucking,
uh,
like a Randy Moss,

644
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.510
you know,
you come into town,

645
00:39:03.511 --> 00:39:06.420
you got your mind right and after about a season and a half,

646
00:39:06.421 --> 00:39:11.010
you start acting like a fucking maniac.
That's how I feel when I look at,
uh,

647
00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.090
whatever the fucking explore.
I'm really trying to avoid the expression,

648
00:39:15.091 --> 00:39:19.500
the powers that be,
but,
um,
I dunno,

649
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:20.611
I can't help it.

650
00:39:20.611 --> 00:39:25.410
Every time when I land in Los Angeles and I look out at the basin as they call

651
00:39:25.411 --> 00:39:26.244
it,

652
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:30.900
I'm from the San Gabriel mountains all the way south of that,

653
00:39:30.901 --> 00:39:33.840
which is fucking La and greater la.
All of that,

654
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:38.280
just what an absolute clusterfuck it is.
And um,

655
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:41.730
what happens when the shit hits the fan?

656
00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.760
So I'm thinking about getting some solar panels and I know all your rednecks out

657
00:39:47.671 --> 00:39:51.350
there saying the obvious thing,
thug goods,
the solar panel I'm going to do,

658
00:39:51.351 --> 00:39:52.460
if he ain't got a gun,

659
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:56.270
what are you going to keep the guy warm that fucking shoot you in the head

660
00:39:56.271 --> 00:39:57.440
steels you provisions.

661
00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:02.480
I understand they're fucking bearded.
Wonder.
All right,

662
00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:05.240
I get it.
But one step at a time.

663
00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:10.160
One step at a fucking time.
First thing I want to do,
I want to get,

664
00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:14.510
you know,
it's ridiculous.
I live in a fucking desert.

665
00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:18.350
The House bakes in the sun and um,
I still have,

666
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:22.910
I don't have solar power.
It's the dumbest shit ever.
So,
uh,

667
00:40:22.911 --> 00:40:27.800
I'm going to look into it and I want,
I want to know is,
is,
you know,

668
00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:30.460
is that two types of solar power.

669
00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:33.580
There's one way you still on the grid and then there's one where you're off the

670
00:40:33.581 --> 00:40:38.500
grid.
I like off the grid and if anybody's listening to my podcast,

671
00:40:38.501 --> 00:40:42.720
if you're off the grid,
like what happens?
Did they like it?

672
00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:43.810
Do they get mad at you?

673
00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:51.490
I mean,
how do they know?
Because all of a sudden you've bill goes down.

674
00:40:51.491 --> 00:40:54.020
Does that like set off a light,
you know,

675
00:40:54.021 --> 00:40:57.250
and underneath the mountain that all those Illuminati guys live in and then

676
00:40:57.251 --> 00:40:58.870
somebody pulls up to your house,
Hey,

677
00:40:58.871 --> 00:41:03.490
I noticed you haven't been making any toasts lately.
And,

678
00:41:03.491 --> 00:41:08.160
uh,
you know,
what's going on here?
How come you're not,
you're not watching TV.

679
00:41:08.161 --> 00:41:10.980
What are you reading books in their fucking eaten apples off the tree.

680
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:16.290
How come you're not using any electrical,
uh,
tricity there?
Does that happen?

681
00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:22.210
Is it,
it's not illegal to be off the grid.
They just sort of fucking a,

682
00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:28.640
do they bully you at all?
Like,
just let me know what I'm in for.
All right.

683
00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:34.440
Because what I would love to do is it continue spending legal tender that really

684
00:41:34.941 --> 00:41:38.870
has nothing behind it other than the faith of every freckled face can't over

685
00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:43.610
here.
Um,
I would really love to continue existing in this,

686
00:41:43.611 --> 00:41:48.611
but I would like to have the backup that if the shit does hit the fan before I'm

687
00:41:49.391 --> 00:41:52.350
overrun by a mob,
you know,

688
00:41:52.351 --> 00:41:55.350
because mine's the only light on the top of the hill.
See that's,

689
00:41:55.351 --> 00:41:58.590
I used to do a bit about that.
That's the thing.
Like if you actually have,

690
00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:03.420
if you're off the grid,
all right and everything just goes fucking haywire.

691
00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:07.660
You immediately,
you got to cut your lights out quick.
Okay.

692
00:42:07.661 --> 00:42:10.480
Cause the first thing when everybody loses power,
they stand that go,

693
00:42:10.481 --> 00:42:12.490
oh you got be fucking shitting me.

694
00:42:12.491 --> 00:42:16.720
I was watching two broke girls Olvey right.
That's the first thing

695
00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:22.840
you flipped the switches is it,
and then you know,
within 30 seconds you're like,

696
00:42:22.841 --> 00:42:26.530
is it just our house?
And you look out the window.
So you basically,

697
00:42:26.531 --> 00:42:31.060
you have 30 fucking seconds to cut all your lights off.

698
00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:37.310
Tell your wife to shut the fuck up and get downstairs and that little corner

699
00:42:38.431 --> 00:42:43.230
room,
all right?
You put your hand on a shoulder

700
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:48.810
firmly.
You don't hurt her,
but you're not affectionate.

701
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.210
You place your hand on her shoulder.

702
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:55.250
So she knows that some pertinent fucking information is on the way and you say,

703
00:42:55.251 --> 00:42:56.084
honey,

704
00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:02.120
we're the only ones left are the only ones that look at me.
Stop crying.

705
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:07.370
We're the only one.
We're the only ones left was power.

706
00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:12.770
And I need you to hold it together.
Cry It out.

707
00:43:12.771 --> 00:43:17.660
Now I want you to cry every ounce of bitch you have in you,

708
00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:21.740
out of you in this corner of this house,
okay?

709
00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:23.240
And when you come upstairs,

710
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:28.640
I want you to sit here and act like we do not have power.
Okay?

711
00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:33.500
So when the Sullivan's come across the fucking street and see if we don't have

712
00:43:33.501 --> 00:43:36.140
power y to their fucking faces,

713
00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.370
honey,
forget about the cell phones.

714
00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:45.650
They're not going to make you understand.
Yeah,

715
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:50.510
I don't want that to happen.
I don't want that to happen to anybody,

716
00:43:50.511 --> 00:43:53.660
but I don't want to be the Sullivans.
You know what I mean?

717
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:58.940
I want a shot.
Just give me a fucking shot.
That's all I need.

718
00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:03.980
I just need some solar panels and a fucking helicopter and I will get the fuck

719
00:44:03.981 --> 00:44:08.300
outta here.
That's what you need.
You fucking 80 switching guns,

720
00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:14.410
Huh?
Well you Schwartzenegger how long is that?
Gonna last.
Um,

721
00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:18.820
anyways,
so I'm thinking about it.
Does anybody,
is anybody live in the La area?

722
00:44:18.821 --> 00:44:22.540
Does anybody have solar panels anywhere in the fucking world?
Can you recommend,

723
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:24.100
are there two different kinds?

724
00:44:24.101 --> 00:44:28.530
Because I actually looked up solar panels off the grid.
Okay.

725
00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:32.120
And uh,
I came to [inaudible] this place

726
00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:35.820
<v 13>up Blue Pacific solar.
It says off grid packages.</v>

727
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:40.620
Um,
then there's another one that just says get solar power,

728
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:44.130
Sun power off grid systems.
Off Grid System.

729
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:48.120
Backwoods solar electric systems.
Yeah,

730
00:44:48.121 --> 00:44:51.580
I kind of stole that Shit.
Well,

731
00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:56.110
what we're gonna do is we're going to bring it in and we'll just run it over the

732
00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:56.980
outhouse.

733
00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:02.500
<v 12>Well,
what go ban on.
What's that?
A cigar?</v>

734
00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:08.380
I'm
sorry,

735
00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.760
I'm going a stupid fucking mowed this week.
Um,

736
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.530
<v 7>okay.</v>

737
00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:15.570
<v 12>Yeah.
Oh,
then there's one for Australia.</v>

738
00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:20.410
I don't mind paying the grid,
but I would like to have,

739
00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:24.580
if the grid fails to have the then off the grid switch.
How about that?

740
00:45:24.581 --> 00:45:25.630
Can we just have that?

741
00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.520
<v 7>Okay.</v>

742
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.320
<v 12>Those of you who've been on the Internet this week,</v>

743
00:45:29.321 --> 00:45:33.610
you know the direction that I'm working in.
Oh yes.
You do.
The stop being modest.

744
00:45:33.611 --> 00:45:37.870
Do you know the direction I'm going in?
I'm talking about solar fucking Rhodes.

745
00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:43.090
Has anybody seen this,
this youtube video?
It's fucking amazing if,

746
00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:47.410
if what they're saying is true about these solar roads.
Um,

747
00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:50.320
and I apologize for the narrator.
I get what he's doing.

748
00:45:50.321 --> 00:45:52.780
He's trying to keep an interesting,

749
00:45:52.781 --> 00:45:56.050
but he kept it interesting too long and then he brings it down to an interlude,

750
00:45:56.051 --> 00:45:59.020
which should have come a minute earlier and then he goes back to scream.

751
00:45:59.021 --> 00:46:02.200
And so it's a little bit annoying,
but,
uh,

752
00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:06.310
just try to listen to the information and then try not to get sucked into a

753
00:46:06.311 --> 00:46:10.280
George Bush Obama debate because,
uh,

754
00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.290
I dunno.
I Dunno if these sinks,
what the fuck do I know?
Right.

755
00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:16.060
But it just basically saying,

756
00:46:16.061 --> 00:46:21.061
if we replaced all our roads with these solar fucking things that literally

757
00:46:21.311 --> 00:46:21.491
look,

758
00:46:21.491 --> 00:46:25.780
makes it look like Lego land and it's all lit up and there'd be sensors to let

759
00:46:25.781 --> 00:46:28.480
you know a deer is going around the corner and then it would just light up in

760
00:46:28.481 --> 00:46:32.230
the turn a,
there's a fucking deer around the corner,
you know,

761
00:46:32.231 --> 00:46:34.510
enjoy your barley pancakes or whatever.
Right?

762
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:36.490
For some fucking full on Hippie Shit.

763
00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:41.520
And that basically the amount of energy that it would create would be three

764
00:46:42.641 --> 00:46:45.010
times what this country even needed,

765
00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.820
which immediately we can just leave the Middle East,

766
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:50.783
<v 7>right?</v>

767
00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.480
<v 12>We don't have to be over there pissing them off by getting in the middle of</v>

768
00:46:54.481 --> 00:46:55.410
their bullshit.

769
00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:57.363
<v 7>All right.</v>

770
00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:03.330
<v 12>We don't have to deal with oil and oil money is what funds the terrorist as far</v>

771
00:47:03.331 --> 00:47:08.310
as my limited reading goes.
Right?
The,
the,
the families over there that,

772
00:47:08.311 --> 00:47:12.690
fuck,
hang on,
she's scratching.
I just gave you a bath.
What's wrong?

773
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:17.550
Oh,
cleo.
Um,

774
00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:22.700
anyways,
uh,
yeah,

775
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:26.090
like the fucking the oil people over the people who make all the money over

776
00:47:26.091 --> 00:47:30.490
there,
they then donate to mosques.
And then in the mosque,

777
00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:34.870
they fucking,
you know,
Kinda of fucking a,
you know,

778
00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:37.570
send it over to these fucking people over here.

779
00:47:37.571 --> 00:47:40.240
That ended up coming back at US shooting shit.
It us as far as you know,

780
00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:44.080
like I said,
I don't know shit.
Cleo,
would you stop fucking,

781
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:46.870
you're going to have to go to the other room here.
Come here buddy.

782
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:52.660
What's up sweetheart?
We went on a nice hike today,
didn't we?
Huh?
The flute.
Good.

783
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:57.250
All right.
Get out of here.
Um,
so anyways,
um,

784
00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.350
yeah,
and then that whole fucking thing is just null and void.

785
00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:02.890
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

786
00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:06.250
<v 12>We have all this extra power.
We actually did we create a bunch of jobs.</v>

787
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:08.560
The only thing I don't know is the way it looks.

788
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.390
It doesn't seem like it's a smooth ride.

789
00:48:10.391 --> 00:48:15.040
It just seems like the whole time he going like over these fucking things.

790
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:19.180
I have no idea,
but just check it out and I swear to God,

791
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:23.170
because this is something that I don't know if it,
if it is,
if it does work,

792
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.770
if it does fucking work,
it could benefit everybody.

793
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

794
00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:30.960
<v 12>Conservatives,
liberals,
independence.</v>

795
00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:36.060
Every boy who wouldn't benefit from all of this energy.
All that's right.

796
00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:40.750
The people in power.
Oh,
how could I forget that?
That's right.

797
00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:43.980
How do you think that they're going to derail this if this actually becomes a

798
00:48:43.981 --> 00:48:48.810
movement,
how will they somehow tie in terrorism?

799
00:48:48.811 --> 00:48:53.540
Nine 11 liberals fucking right wing conservatives and just get the,

800
00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:58.240
the pot fucking stern so everybody's screaming and yelling.
It was good.

801
00:48:58.241 --> 00:49:02.510
It will be for helping of Les Expensive and the Babies will starve.

802
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:05.240
They're going to do all of that shit.
Um,

803
00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.910
the only way this thing gets off the ground,
if it works,

804
00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:10.493
if it works,

805
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:15.950
is if people don't get sucked into those arguments and we all become one and we

806
00:49:17.041 --> 00:49:21.540
all pick up a hatchet and we start marching towards the bankers.

807
00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.710
Gated communities.

808
00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:24.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

809
00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:26.500
<v 12>Because the asphalt streets,</v>

810
00:49:26.501 --> 00:49:31.501
we'll have to run red with blue blood money before something wonderful like this

811
00:49:31.901 --> 00:49:35.100
will ever fucking happen because you are fucking with,

812
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:37.070
<v 1>yeah.</v>

813
00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:42.070
<v 12>A century and a half of cashflow going to a small amount of people.</v>

814
00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:48.170
That's what you fucking with and when you're fucking with something like that,

815
00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:49.850
that level of money.

816
00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:51.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

817
00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.430
<v 12>Basically the money that gives the dollar power,</v>

818
00:49:53.431 --> 00:49:57.420
like the only thing gives the US dollar powers that oil barrels of oil are still

819
00:49:57.421 --> 00:50:00.570
measured in US dollars.
Other than that,
it's a fucking shit show.

820
00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.420
So these guys are the guys behind all of that.

821
00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:07.290
It's them in the fucking bankers and that's it.
All right.

822
00:50:07.291 --> 00:50:10.650
The insurance companies like the Ted Kennedy or that fucking family.
All right,

823
00:50:10.651 --> 00:50:14.130
but fucking Bobby and Jack.
All right.

824
00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:18.150
Actually the banks have fucking Joe Kennedy.
All right,

825
00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.200
I'll shut up with the Kennedy Shit.
All right.
So anyways,
that's my thing.

826
00:50:22.201 --> 00:50:25.020
Like this is a great fucking idea.
If it works,
if it works,

827
00:50:25.021 --> 00:50:29.450
it's a fucking great idea.
Even if you just did a few roads,

828
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:31.100
if he just did a few of them,

829
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:35.300
each state just did like their main highway or whatever.

830
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:37.640
If you just did that,

831
00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:42.730
I can't imagine the amount of of money we would save and on the less than about,

832
00:50:42.731 --> 00:50:46.700
man,
it was incorrect.
The possibilities of it are incredible.

833
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:51.650
I don't know if it works,
but it is fucking incredible.
But the sad thing is,

834
00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:56.660
um,
the fact that whenever new stuff like this comes up,

835
00:50:56.690 --> 00:51:00.200
it all just turns into a Obama,

836
00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.850
Bush,
Republican,
Democrat,
blah,
blah,
blah.

837
00:51:03.851 --> 00:51:06.830
Everybody's just yelling at each other and then it just fucking goes away.

838
00:51:06.831 --> 00:51:11.510
And then everybody turns on sports.
And that's what happens.
So there you go.

839
00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:15.770
This is all off the grid,
Billy.
15 minutes of crazy talk.

840
00:51:15.771 --> 00:51:20.660
But that makes sense to me.
Makes sense to me,
man.
Fuck,
you know,

841
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:25.220
we get this done if everyone wasn't so,
so,
so fucking lit,
Bro.

842
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:30.440
All them liberals out there in Hollywood,
right?
And I gotta tell you I'm not,
I'm,

843
00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:34.880
I'm not just making fun of stereotypical southern guy.
All right?

844
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:37.010
Because I haven't lived out here in Hollywood.

845
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:41.240
These people are out of their fucking mind state.
They have Fox News to the left.

846
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:42.860
They're out of their fucking minds.

847
00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:47.660
The there does such fucking hypocrites where it's just like,

848
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:52.430
you can say the most,
uh,
I guess racist isn't the word.

849
00:51:52.431 --> 00:51:57.080
Cause you can make fun of white people,
rich,
white people.
You,
you can basically,

850
00:51:57.081 --> 00:51:58.700
you can be a,

851
00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:02.030
you can use the exact fucking thing that they don't like seeing used on poor

852
00:52:02.031 --> 00:52:05.330
people against rich people and they fucking love it.
You know,

853
00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:08.240
you can suggest that people from the south or all fucking,

854
00:52:08.241 --> 00:52:12.650
they're sisters and they're slapping their knees and they're doing the wave and

855
00:52:12.651 --> 00:52:14.060
the crowd.
All right.

856
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:19.240
But if you suggest any homeless guy needs to get off his fucking ass,

857
00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:23.010
stop boozing and get a fucking job,
then you're the devil.
So

858
00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:25.780
<v 10>I mean,
I dunno.
Does that make any sense?
Well,
it shouldn't.</v>

859
00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.290
Isn't that why you listened to this podcast?

860
00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.380
<v 11>Okay.</v>

861
00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:04.370
<v 10>Solar panels.</v>

862
00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.090
<v 12>Last week I talked about,</v>

863
00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:08.580
I was thinking about maybe get solar panels off my house,

864
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:12.570
off my house on my house and uh,

865
00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:15.090
I dunno if I want to go off the grid,
but whatever.

866
00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:18.420
A city of baking in the sun in this fucking house,

867
00:53:18.421 --> 00:53:21.930
I might as well get something out of it.
Right.
All right,
so here we go.
Hi Bill.

868
00:53:21.931 --> 00:53:24.270
First off,
huge fan of your comedy podcasts.
Thank you.

869
00:53:24.271 --> 00:53:27.990
I saw you perform Brian Regan.
Oh,
with Brian Regan.
COBB's comedy.

870
00:53:27.991 --> 00:53:30.810
While that was a,
that was a bucket list night for me to be able to perform it.

871
00:53:30.811 --> 00:53:33.390
That guy show is absolutely hilarious.

872
00:53:33.391 --> 00:53:36.510
Well thank you and thank you for Brian Regan to um,
anyway,

873
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.850
regarding your question about solar,

874
00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:42.690
there is no solar power that is completely off the grid.

875
00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:47.400
You use all the energy that you can provide through solar and the rest that

876
00:53:47.401 --> 00:53:52.401
can't be provided by the sun like at night or if it gets shady on your roof.

877
00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:58.020
The utility provides,
this is called interconnection.
Uh,

878
00:53:58.021 --> 00:54:00.990
you save a ton of money and you use clean energy in the process.

879
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:02.430
I worked for a solar company,

880
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:06.030
I promise this isn't a bullshit sales pitch and I managed the construction

881
00:54:06.031 --> 00:54:08.100
timeline so I've learned a lot about this stuff.

882
00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:10.080
Here's the link to my company I worked for.

883
00:54:10.081 --> 00:54:12.900
We install a lot in la and in Boston as well too.

884
00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:15.570
I think we're in like 12 different states.
Anyways,

885
00:54:15.571 --> 00:54:19.020
thanks you for the awesome podcasts and you know something about this solar
shit.

886
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:22.260
This,
every person you talk to says something different.

887
00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:27.480
I watch people on Youtube make up a solar thing.
Um,

888
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:33.390
but a solar thing put up their solar panels broke down how they worked and,

889
00:54:34.291 --> 00:54:38.160
uh,
and how you could get off the grid,
but it was really,
really,

890
00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:42.600
really fucking involved.
Sky's digging a God damn trench.

891
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:45.180
I can't even know what the fuck was going on,
but I'm just like,
all right,

892
00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:49.450
I don't have room for a trench.
All right.
My little piece of property here.
So I,

893
00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:53.070
I,
you know,
I got room for a whole,
does that work?

894
00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:54.660
I can't even what he was doing,

895
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:57.510
they dug this translate stuff like a fucking tarp in there.

896
00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:02.220
And I know what the heck.
I can't even tell you what was going on,
but,
um,

897
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:07.500
I will definitely,
uh,
I'll definitely look into it.
Um,

898
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:11.130
hopefully I'll have more luck with you guys and the fucking concept.

899
00:55:11.131 --> 00:55:15.230
Put the roof on this house.
Fucking assholes.

900
00:55:15.231 --> 00:55:16.160
I told you what they did right?

901
00:55:16.161 --> 00:55:19.550
They put the roof on the house and then like the drain pipes,

902
00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:20.690
because it's an old house,

903
00:55:20.691 --> 00:55:25.691
old stupid design with a drain off was it goes down into a pipe that actually

904
00:55:25.701 --> 00:55:30.500
goes into like,
uh,
I don't,
I have like,
uh,
my attic is actually ever see,

905
00:55:30.501 --> 00:55:34.430
seen John Malcovich are being,
being John Malcovich.

906
00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.070
Remember how they had that floor?
We had to walk around,
bent over,

907
00:55:37.071 --> 00:55:41.480
like that's basically how much space there is between,
um,

908
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:46.010
the ceiling on my top floor and then the roof.

909
00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:49.830
I don't even know what the purpose of it is.
All it is,
it's just true.

910
00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:54.830
It just traps air that gets heated up and causes my house to be hot.
But anyways,

911
00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:55.911
that's what it is.

912
00:55:55.911 --> 00:56:00.911
So the drain off of the water on the roof goes into a pipe that goes in,

913
00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:06.770
into the fucking crawl space and then back out the front of the house and down

914
00:56:06.771 --> 00:56:11.060
the side.
So you take water from the roof,
you bring it into the house,

915
00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:12.800
it's inside a pipe,

916
00:56:12.801 --> 00:56:17.801
but nevertheless you bring it into the fucking house and God forbid that pipe

917
00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:24.760
bursts or you have some fucking moron who disconnects it when he's putting the

918
00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:27.670
new roof on and forgets to hook it back up.

919
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:29.060
<v 14>Okay.</v>

920
00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:31.080
<v 12>And then tries to blame it.
Not yet.
He blamed it on,
Oh,</v>

921
00:56:31.081 --> 00:56:33.650
you know the fuck it all the blah blah blah.
And I'm just sitting there going,

922
00:56:33.651 --> 00:56:35.750
all right,
this is at least a year in court.
You know what?

923
00:56:36.110 --> 00:56:39.830
Why don't you just get the fuck Outta here?
I'll just put in a god damn claim.

924
00:56:39.831 --> 00:56:44.810
You can't.
That's what I did because I didn't want to go to court.
So,
um,
anyways,

925
00:56:44.811 --> 00:56:48.080
I'm hoping you,
you're better than those guys.
I mean,
how couldn't you be?

926
00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:53.330
All right.
Here's my favorite one of this week.
A solar roadways debunked.

927
00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:55.590
<v 14>MMM.</v>

928
00:56:56.590 --> 00:56:58.420
<v 12>I got a note from my guy here.
Andrew says,</v>

929
00:56:58.421 --> 00:57:02.980
a ton of people forwarded the same link as the one in the email below.

930
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:07.090
I watched this,
so you don't have to,
it's 30 minutes long.
Basically.

931
00:57:07.091 --> 00:57:11.020
He bitches about costs maintenance and the efficiency,
efficiency of the perks.

932
00:57:11.021 --> 00:57:14.830
Advertising original video like heating,
repairing the road.
Yeah,

933
00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:18.090
I actually watched the first 10 minutes of it.
Um,

934
00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:21.670
I'll save my opinion until I read this.
Uh,
Yo Billy,
the sunburn kit,

935
00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:25.360
I know you were pretty pumped up about solar roads is be honest.
So was I,

936
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:29.410
but someone's smart sat down and crunched some numbers and brought up points as

937
00:57:29.411 --> 00:57:32.440
why as to why solar roads are economically in tech.

938
00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:36.280
Technically not feasible.
It's about 30 minutes long.

939
00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:40.090
So if you got some time to kill in any airport,
check it out.
Well,

940
00:57:40.091 --> 00:57:44.860
you know what sir,
I watched the first 10 minutes of it.
Uh,
he didn't debunk them.

941
00:57:44.861 --> 00:57:46.810
He just brought up a bunch of questions.

942
00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:52.120
He's just like a road has to be durable and I would have some questions about,

943
00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:55.180
I mean they showed a tractor run over the tiles,

944
00:57:55.181 --> 00:57:59.800
but it was a small tractor and they only did it once.
Um,
I,

945
00:57:59.801 --> 00:58:02.680
I would like to see how these,
you know,

946
00:58:02.681 --> 00:58:06.970
these things hold up when it's wet out and you need water to run off.

947
00:58:06.971 --> 00:58:11.200
And he just brought up a bunch of fucking questions.
You know,

948
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:14.860
he didn't debunk them.
He did basically,
basically what he did,

949
00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:19.960
it's like 50% what you have to do,
you can't have somebody just come in and,
hey,

950
00:58:19.961 --> 00:58:24.130
these are brand new roads.
Can I make them?
Oh,
okay.
You think,

951
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:27.610
do you think they're going to work?
Okay.
I mean,
obviously you can't do that,

952
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:31.600
but it's 50% that,
which is smart.
You got to ask the right questions.

953
00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:35.800
And then the other side is anytime you try to do something new,

954
00:58:35.801 --> 00:58:39.070
there's always people saying it's not going to work.
You know,

955
00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:42.670
and this guy in his half hour,
I'm sure he brings,

956
00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:45.100
he brought up a number of things that would be a problem.

957
00:58:45.101 --> 00:58:47.910
It doesn't mean they can't work.
Okay.
So I don't,

958
00:58:47.911 --> 00:58:49.240
I wouldn't say they would debunked.

959
00:58:49.241 --> 00:58:53.530
I would just say somebody asked a bunch of fucking questions and rather than

960
00:58:53.531 --> 00:58:56.230
just,
what he does is he just throws it out there.
It's like,

961
00:58:56.231 --> 00:59:01.090
why don't you contact the people at the solar road who tried to make the solar

962
00:59:01.091 --> 00:59:04.300
roads and actually get some answers and get some fucking,
uh,

963
00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:07.870
or maybe order some tiles and tried to do some experiments yourself rather than

964
00:59:07.871 --> 00:59:12.160
wasting people's time with the half hour of questions and speculation.

965
00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:16.780
That's basically what it was.
So I wouldn't say that it was debunked.
Um,

966
00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:19.870
but you know,
you throw up three pointers for a half an hour,

967
00:59:19.871 --> 00:59:21.770
some of them are going to go in even if you suck.

968
00:59:21.771 --> 00:59:25.400
So I'm sure a couple of his concerns were true,
but uh,
you know,

969
00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:30.510
let me look at electric cars
since way back in the day.

970
00:59:30.511 --> 00:59:32.310
People who are,
they show up to fucking up,

971
00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:36.240
like people actually questioned the power of electric electricity.

972
00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:40.860
It powers the entire fucking shitty can light up a whole fucking city.

973
00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:46.080
And I get a Prius and my own mother,
my own mother is going,

974
00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.590
can it go up a hill?
No,
mom,

975
00:59:49.591 --> 00:59:53.700
I just got to get out and start walking.
It's great for my weight.

976
00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:57.780
And look at that.
They say,
oh,
they're underpowered and their this and their that.

977
00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.930
First of all,
the Prius is not an electric car.

978
01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.080
<v 11>Okay.</v>

979
01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:05.230
<v 12>It's not even a fucking 50% electric car.</v>

980
01:00:05.410 --> 01:00:07.870
It's like an 8% electric car.

981
01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.250
<v 11>Yeah,</v>

982
01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:12.580
<v 12>that's what it is.
From like zero.</v>

983
01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:15.730
I've told you this guys for years from zero to seven miles an hour,

984
01:00:15.731 --> 01:00:19.510
that car runs on electric power and then switches over to gas for the rest of

985
01:00:19.511 --> 01:00:21.760
the time.
And if you drive with a lead foot,

986
01:00:21.761 --> 01:00:25.120
you're going to get maybe 25 miles a gallon.
But if you listen,

987
01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:28.000
if you listen to the engine,
okay.

988
01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.450
And you don't stop on the gas and drive like a fucking maniac,

989
01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.540
slam on the brakes,
you can get,
you know,
I don't,

990
01:00:34.541 --> 01:00:38.200
I wouldn't say 40 miles a gallon.
Yeah,
you can get like 35 but it's great.

991
01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:42.670
Perfect car.
If you live in,
in the city.
I absolutely love the fucking thing.

992
01:00:42.671 --> 01:00:43.960
So anyways,
so you had that,

993
01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:49.320
I bought that thing in October of 2007 and now look at these,

994
01:00:50.711 --> 01:00:53.440
these Tesla cars.
I actually wrote in one of those,
uh,

995
01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:58.300
the end of last year before I wrote in Casey's fucking truck,
Jesus Christ,

996
01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:01.900
which probably gets two feet to the gallon,
especially the way he was driving it.

997
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:03.303
Um,

998
01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:09.660
those Tesla cars are fucking amazing and you can drive from last I checked from

999
01:01:10.181 --> 01:01:13.150
San Diego all you up to Vancouver.
Um,

1000
01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:17.440
you know they have a recharge stations from San Diego.

1001
01:01:17.441 --> 01:01:20.860
All we have to Vancouver and I think recently someone just drove one across the

1002
01:01:20.861 --> 01:01:24.750
country.
So it's not like that guy in the speculation video.
Um,
I'm,

1003
01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.520
I got to look that one up or you should look it up or whatever.
But um,

1004
01:01:27.970 --> 01:01:32.770
I'm actually,
uh,
I'm leaning towards that fucking thing.
Thinks bad ass.

1005
01:01:32.771 --> 01:01:34.060
You walk up to,
when you turn it on,

1006
01:01:34.061 --> 01:01:37.240
like the door handles are flush against the car and you walk up and things pop

1007
01:01:37.241 --> 01:01:40.000
out.
I'm sure other cars do that,
but I never seen it.

1008
01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:36.460
<v 15>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

1009
01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:40.750
It's bill burr and it is the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

1010
01:02:40.751 --> 01:02:43.600
June the sixth,
2009,

1011
01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:47.800
and this is my last couple of days here in New York City.

1012
01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.360
I can't wait to get back to,
uh,
to Los Angeles,

1013
01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.560
even though everybody fucking trashes that city.

1014
01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:01.150
I've never lived in a city where so many people so openly just fucking trash it.

1015
01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:06.970
You know what I mean?
It's weird.
Hey,
what do you live?
Oh,

1016
01:03:06.971 --> 01:03:11.530
I lived in a,
I live in Saint Paul,
Minnesota.
Oh my God.

1017
01:03:11.531 --> 01:03:15.850
That place sucks.
Those people are so fucking phony.
Yeah.

1018
01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:20.960
Have another contrived snowball fight,
you know?
I Dunno.

1019
01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:22.120
Whatever.
People always,

1020
01:03:22.121 --> 01:03:25.870
I love when people go to fucking La is they go down to fucking right on the

1021
01:03:25.871 --> 01:03:30.871
sunset strip and then they fucking talk about how Hollywood and phony it is.

1022
01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:35.140
Really.
When you go to Georgia,

1023
01:03:35.141 --> 01:03:38.560
do you go to Atlanta or do you go to like fucking Macon,
Georgia?

1024
01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.060
And they'd be like,
I can't believe how many of you,

1025
01:03:40.061 --> 01:03:41.920
I can't believe how many rednecks they're where they're,

1026
01:03:41.921 --> 01:03:45.160
where you fucking went to ground zero of it yet dumb fuck.

1027
01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:50.230
Um,
from grumpy this week.

1028
01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:54.430
I'm grumpy this week cause uh,
I don't want to fucking be here anymore.

1029
01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:56.620
I just realized that I don't want to be here anymore,

1030
01:03:56.621 --> 01:03:58.570
which is great because this is my last day of shooting.

1031
01:03:58.571 --> 01:04:03.250
I am having a great time when I am on the set but when I am off to set and I'm

1032
01:04:03.251 --> 01:04:07.480
trying to figure out what the fuck I do in a city that I already lived in for 12

1033
01:04:07.481 --> 01:04:11.080
fucking years,
you know,
what am I going to get another slice?

1034
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:15.880
Am I going to go to central park for the 90th million fucking times.

1035
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:18.220
90 million fucking time is what I'm trying to say there.

1036
01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:22.930
I was drinking yesterday and like the afternoon,
you know,

1037
01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:28.080
went into watch the red sox play the mariners at some bar and my buddy,

1038
01:04:28.901 --> 01:04:31.540
he came in for the first three innings and then he left and I was like,

1039
01:04:31.541 --> 01:04:32.590
you know what,
I'm going to hang out.

1040
01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:38.070
And I just sorta just stayed there and it had like five Heineken's in the middle

1041
01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:38.470
of the day.

1042
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:42.190
Now I know all you youngsters out there like five Heineken's in the middle of

1043
01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:46.990
the day.
What do you fucking pussy,
what does it,
it's,
it's all you got.

1044
01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:51.900
I Dunno what the ages,
but there becomes an age.
Jesus Christ.

1045
01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:55.450
Can I get like a fucking double Chin looking at myself in the mirror?

1046
01:04:55.451 --> 01:04:56.440
That's when you know you've been booze.

1047
01:04:56.441 --> 01:05:00.400
And if you've got to like a fucking two scruff and all of a sudden you've got

1048
01:05:00.401 --> 01:05:05.200
like that Pelican Chin,
uh,
what a fucking mess.

1049
01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:09.970
You know,
I don't know.
I gotta get Outta here.
That's the fucking point.

1050
01:05:09.971 --> 01:05:14.230
So anyways,
so I have like five beers and uh,

1051
01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:19.340
it was that per fino five beers is like that point where you don't think you're

1052
01:05:19.481 --> 01:05:20.314
drunk,

1053
01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:25.090
so you continue talking to people and uh,
I dunno,

1054
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:26.290
it just sucks.

1055
01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:29.260
Stricken in the middle of day sucks because you go through the whole fucking

1056
01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:34.450
hangover.
You know,
usually when you just pass out at the end of the night,
I mean,

1057
01:05:34.451 --> 01:05:38.380
you sleep through most of your fucking hangover as opposed to this one where I

1058
01:05:38.381 --> 01:05:41.740
came off and I just sort of gradually came down and I would not off like a

1059
01:05:41.741 --> 01:05:46.510
fucking old man and then wake up back again and just wake up back again.

1060
01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:51.040
It doesn't even make any sense.
I'd wake up again.
I don't know.

1061
01:05:51.041 --> 01:05:54.730
I'm all over the fucking place.
I want to get outta here.
I've had it,

1062
01:05:56.350 --> 01:05:58.870
fucking had it.
I've had it.
So anyways,

1063
01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:03.520
I went up to see some family over the 4th of July to celebrate the birthday of

1064
01:06:03.521 --> 01:06:06.990
this country.
And um,

1065
01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:08.560
as I'm driving up,

1066
01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:15.130
I'm listening on the radio and evidently I looked up the song on,

1067
01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:20.160
uh,
on the Internet.
It's a,
uh,

1068
01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:23.230
Carrie Underwood song,
who I don't,
I don't know what she has.

1069
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:27.670
I'm guessing she's white cause it sounded country and she had little Twang in

1070
01:06:27.671 --> 01:06:30.370
your voice,
but I don't want to piss off any Koreans out there.

1071
01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:33.620
She might've been Korean.
Um,

1072
01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:36.820
is a song called before he cheats.

1073
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:42.100
So I'm driving along and you know,
I'm driving my buddy's car.

1074
01:06:42.101 --> 01:06:44.230
This is how I'm going to fucking defend myself.

1075
01:06:44.231 --> 01:06:47.120
That I was on a radio station that was actually playing this and I was just sort

1076
01:06:47.121 --> 01:06:51.630
of clicking the,
uh,
the preprogram radios.
Fuck,

1077
01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:54.830
getting to whatever,
you know what I'm saying?
And I'm home.
I'm feel like shit.

1078
01:06:55.160 --> 01:07:00.050
Cut me some slack this week.
So anyways,
this song comes on and this,

1079
01:07:00.051 --> 01:07:04.260
this Carrie Underwood CIC is sitting there singing this song going rat.

1080
01:07:04.310 --> 01:07:07.790
Now he's probably slow dancing man frat now.

1081
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:12.470
And she's singing about her boyfriend.
Yeah,
I got the lyrics right here.

1082
01:07:12.471 --> 01:07:12.981
Right now.

1083
01:07:12.981 --> 01:07:17.810
He's probably buying her some fruity little drink cause she can't shoot whiskey

1084
01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.810
right now.
He's probably up behind her with the pool stick,

1085
01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:22.990
showing her how to shoot it Combo.

1086
01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:29.130
And then they go into the chorus and she goes and he don't know,
um,

1087
01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:34.550
that I dug my keys into the side of his pretty little souped up four wheel

1088
01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:37.700
drive.
Carve my name into his leather seats.

1089
01:07:37.701 --> 01:07:40.220
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights,

1090
01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:43.100
slashed a hole in all four tires.

1091
01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:48.180
And all I could think was,
why don't you just break up with them?

1092
01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:52.170
You're dumb cunt.
You know what I mean?

1093
01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:55.830
What are you going to do?
You're going to do all this shit.

1094
01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.450
Then he's going to get mad,

1095
01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:01.230
and then what you're going to make up after five days and then you're going to

1096
01:08:01.231 --> 01:08:05.880
blow him again.
I hate this fucking song and I'm going to tell you why,

1097
01:08:05.881 --> 01:08:10.350
because it's,
I,
I'm pretty sure it's a hit.
It's on the radio,
right?

1098
01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:12.920
Uh,
I dunno.

1099
01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:17.690
And what I love about this is people will listen to this song and they won't

1100
01:08:17.691 --> 01:08:21.680
even question the rationale of what the fuck someone's doing in there.

1101
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.250
Because so many people in life,
myself included,

1102
01:08:27.710 --> 01:08:30.750
you,
you,
you,
you play,
you like powerless in life.

1103
01:08:31.230 --> 01:08:32.850
You just play the powerless card.

1104
01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.113
<v 16>You know,</v>

1105
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:39.250
<v 15>just get out of the fucking relationship.
I fucking hate this song.</v>

1106
01:08:39.610 --> 01:08:42.670
And this is one of these songs too.
We're fucking women all get together.
They,

1107
01:08:42.671 --> 01:08:46.420
he saying,
Hey guy,
cat man ass car.

1108
01:08:46.570 --> 01:08:51.460
You're all a bunch of dumb cunts.
Okay,
you're fucking stupid.

1109
01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:55.030
Just break up with the guy.
Just break up with them.

1110
01:08:55.180 --> 01:09:00.110
Not even to mention the fact that now you're going out there and you're,

1111
01:09:00.111 --> 01:09:04.210
you're,
you're doing damage.
You're,
I don't,
is that a felon?
That's not a felony.

1112
01:09:04.211 --> 01:09:05.044
I don't know what it is,

1113
01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:09.400
but it's just a classic thing where a woman would listen to that song and at no

1114
01:09:09.401 --> 01:09:13.150
point would she ever think may,
maybe I could get arrested for this.

1115
01:09:13.210 --> 01:09:18.040
I am damaging somebody's property.
No,
you got to fucking vagina.

1116
01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:20.170
You can just go out and broad daylight.

1117
01:09:20.230 --> 01:09:22.210
You don't even have to wear a fucking mask.

1118
01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:25.570
Do you know what I would have to do if I wanted to go out and go fuck up

1119
01:09:25.571 --> 01:09:28.720
somebody's car?
I would have to wait for the,
first of all,

1120
01:09:28.721 --> 01:09:31.960
I'd have to make sure I had an alibi.
It'd be like I was killing somebody.

1121
01:09:32.050 --> 01:09:34.990
I had to make sure somebody could cover for me and say that I was fucking

1122
01:09:34.991 --> 01:09:36.040
somewhere.
Right.

1123
01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:40.330
I had to put on some God damn cat suit and a fucking mask.

1124
01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:45.300
Right?
Like,
I'm in that dead presidents movie and all I would able to get,

1125
01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:49.330
I'd be able to get off one quick hit,
right?
One quick hit.

1126
01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:52.240
Let's say I wanted to start carving it up like a pussy.
Right.
But if I,

1127
01:09:52.241 --> 01:09:55.030
if I really was going to go out there and smash somebody headlights,

1128
01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:58.000
I can hit one and the second the car alarm goes off,

1129
01:09:58.030 --> 01:10:00.310
I have to fucking take off and then run home,

1130
01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:05.400
get out of my little fucking fucking a little cat suit and then tried to put on

1131
01:10:06.431 --> 01:10:08.440
my pajamas so when the cops show up,

1132
01:10:08.530 --> 01:10:10.870
because you know they're going to find some sort of fucking fingerprint,

1133
01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:12.550
I got to act like I'm not out of breath.

1134
01:10:12.610 --> 01:10:15.550
Like I actually have been sitting there for fucking eight hours watching TV.

1135
01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:20.960
I know I just,
I can't stand,
you know,
it just reminds me of when that movie,

1136
01:10:20.961 --> 01:10:24.140
a fatal attraction came out.
Right.

1137
01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:27.470
And the amount of women who would just sit there and you see that movie?
Huh?

1138
01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:32.270
Yeah.
That's what she get [inaudible] get.
You know,

1139
01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:36.840
there's no thought of like this bitch put a rabbit in,
in,

1140
01:10:36.841 --> 01:10:40.490
in boiling water does not have that.
Women are there.

1141
01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.700
They're out of their fucking minds.
But that's not even the point of this.

1142
01:10:43.701 --> 01:10:46.490
My point of the Carrie Underwood song,

1143
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:49.790
it actually made me feel like a loser because the amount of fucking times,

1144
01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:53.120
I mean I haven't gone out and fucked up somebody's car,
but the amount of times,

1145
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:56.480
you know what it is that song is that song.
It's a powerless song.

1146
01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:57.400
<v 16>Yeah.</v>

1147
01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:58.330
<v 15>That's what the fuck it is.</v>

1148
01:10:58.331 --> 01:11:02.620
And I went to the whole lyrics to see if she breaks up with them in the end and

1149
01:11:02.621 --> 01:11:07.030
there's sort of an ambiguous line in the end where she goes,
uh,

1150
01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:11.320
cause the next time he cheats,
oh you know,
it won't be on me.

1151
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.590
So that's sort of ambiguous because it could mean because I broke up with them

1152
01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:20.100
or it could be because he doesn't want to get his truck fucked up.

1153
01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.473
So I dunno.

1154
01:11:25.050 --> 01:11:29.270
I just at just fucking annoys me.

1155
01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:35.090
That song just annoyed the shit out of me
on,
on,

1156
01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:39.870
on both levels.
Well,
you,
you got somebody,
it's like,
just break up with the guy

1157
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:44.130
and your solution is,
you know,
something.

1158
01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:47.790
If a girl ever fucking cheated on me that,
that I would break up with them.

1159
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:53.600
I'm not saying I wouldn't flip out and I give them a good fucking and verbally,

1160
01:11:54.930 --> 01:11:59.160
but I would never go in like,
uh,
what,
you know,

1161
01:11:59.161 --> 01:12:01.920
throw all their clothes out in the front lawn and Burnham.

1162
01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:09.330
You know,
why wouldn't I do that?
I don't know.
I don't know why.

1163
01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:12.900
I think a lot of it has to do because I'd be fucking worried I'd get arrested

1164
01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.280
for damaging property.

1165
01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:19.350
Why do women have an exemption from damaging property?
I don't understand it.

1166
01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:25.980
Of a woman's sat there smashing up somebody's car in broad daylight because the

1167
01:12:26.561 --> 01:12:31.030
guy cheated on them.
People would be laughing.
I would be laughing.

1168
01:12:31.330 --> 01:12:34.450
Everyone.
It would,
it's,
it's a comedy.
It's just hilarious.

1169
01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:38.480
But if the exact same scenario was going down and a guy did it,
he,

1170
01:12:38.570 --> 01:12:42.370
he be the classic,
you know the cops come and they put you in that little,

1171
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:46.720
you get tasered and they mush you face into the fucking pavement.
I Dunno,

1172
01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:47.291
I get it.

1173
01:12:47.291 --> 01:12:50.650
Women have to carry a kid around and that God damn stomach for nine months,

1174
01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.570
but I don't think that gives you the right to go out and attack somebody fee

1175
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:58.090
arrow.
I really don't.
You know,
so why don't you guys just fucking relax.

1176
01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:03.700
All right.
You're a bunch of God damn psychos.
You know,

1177
01:13:03.701 --> 01:13:06.730
with your,
I'm on my period excuse.
So three weeks a month,

1178
01:13:06.731 --> 01:13:11.320
you're out of your fucking mind.
I think if a girl goes,

1179
01:13:11.321 --> 01:13:15.130
even if you were cheating on a girl on a woman,
right?
And she fucks up your car,

1180
01:13:15.131 --> 01:13:19.240
I really think you ought to be able to go up to her and give her a nice fucking

1181
01:13:19.241 --> 01:13:22.150
two piece combination to the Goddamn fucking cabbage.

1182
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.270
What do you think about that?
Right?
Just fucking,

1183
01:13:25.271 --> 01:13:27.670
just hook off on that fucking

1184
01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:33.070
hair teased head a lettuce on the top of her fucking shoulders.
Right?

1185
01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:35.050
What would you go with?

1186
01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:38.190
I'm really going to alienate a lot of my pants on this one

1187
01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.910
and I want you to know that most of this is not me advocating punching a woman

1188
01:13:42.911 --> 01:13:44.530
in the face.
Most of this is,

1189
01:13:44.531 --> 01:13:48.640
I can't fucking sit in this stupid hotel room anymore.

1190
01:13:48.670 --> 01:13:50.980
I can't fucking do it.
I've had the Goddamn

1191
01:13:52.690 --> 01:13:54.970
do not disturb light on for like four days.

1192
01:13:54.971 --> 01:13:58.390
They probably think I overdosed in here.
I'm really big on that.

1193
01:13:58.391 --> 01:14:00.760
Don't clean up the room.
Beat it.

1194
01:14:01.090 --> 01:14:04.330
You know you had to come in and every three days and change the sheets like I'm

1195
01:14:04.331 --> 01:14:08.470
royalty.
It changed his sheets like fucking once every three weeks.

1196
01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:14.170
Maybe that's if that's only if they are white and I could tell how filthy they

1197
01:14:14.171 --> 01:14:17.260
are.
That's right.
Wrinkle your nose up.
You fucking pump is broads.

1198
01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:21.520
That's how I live my life.
Jesus.
Why am I attacking women?

1199
01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.330
I Dunno.
Why?
What was I talking about?
Oh yeah.
If you,

1200
01:14:25.331 --> 01:14:27.850
if you could punch a woman in a face,
you allow two punches,

1201
01:14:27.851 --> 01:14:31.510
what would you go with?
Okay.
Would you go classic?

1202
01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:35.910
Would you set up the overhand right with the jab?
Would you actually waste a jet?

1203
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:39.970
You know,
waste a jab
which you go,

1204
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:43.780
this is just evil.
All right,
I gotta get off this fucking subject.
I don't know,

1205
01:14:43.781 --> 01:14:45.880
that song just annoyed me.
Um,

1206
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:50.380
I hate those fucking songs when women just just openly talk about how they're

1207
01:14:50.381 --> 01:14:53.690
going to go out and destroy a guy's fucking property rather than break up with

1208
01:14:53.691 --> 01:14:57.910
them,
you know,
and it's considered some sort of justification,

1209
01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:01.240
you know,
rather than looking inward going,
you know,

1210
01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.700
maybe I'm a bad judge of character.

1211
01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.890
What sort of qualities of am I looking for in somebody?

1212
01:15:08.891 --> 01:15:11.050
And I'll date that.
I mean,

1213
01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:14.890
didn't the fact that the guy had a souped up four wheel drive truck,

1214
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:18.880
didn't that give it or didn't that give it away on any fucking level?

1215
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:24.530
Huh?
And is,
I mean a souped up four wheel drive truck.
Carrie Underwood,

1216
01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:27.430
you dumb fucking,
what else did he have?
Huh?
Uh,
uh,

1217
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:31.760
a fucking earring hanging down with a lightening bolt on the side of it to have

1218
01:15:31.761 --> 01:15:35.780
this fucking song sticks.
This is one of the,

1219
01:15:35.781 --> 01:15:38.990
you know why I hate this sign this and I'm going to do my whole podcast on this

1220
01:15:38.991 --> 01:15:39.800
fucking song.

1221
01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:43.850
This is going to be one of those fucking songs when I'm the on the road and I'm

1222
01:15:43.851 --> 01:15:45.860
hating my life,
you know,

1223
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:49.700
and I just don't want to go back to the hotel room and be lonely and I'm going

1224
01:15:49.701 --> 01:15:54.110
to go out to a bar and that song's going to come on and fucking four fucking

1225
01:15:54.111 --> 01:15:58.190
twats with their ear piercing.
I'm singing and I'm drunk.

1226
01:15:58.430 --> 01:16:00.440
High pitched voices are going to start singing.

1227
01:16:00.441 --> 01:16:03.840
Every fucking word of that song liked it.

1228
01:16:03.841 --> 01:16:08.760
They like these fucking cunt bad asses.
Ah,
okay.

1229
01:16:08.761 --> 01:16:09.600
And I'm done.
All right,

1230
01:16:09.601 --> 01:16:12.230
I'm done with that and I'm done with that fucking Jesus Christ.

1231
01:16:12.231 --> 01:16:13.500
That fucking song annoyed me.

1232
01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:18.390
What a fucking loser that Carrie Underwood is.
Huh?

1233
01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.730
Is that an anthem for all you broads out there?
You know,

1234
01:16:22.731 --> 01:16:25.700
I love about this is I'm really like,
I'm really taking the,

1235
01:16:25.701 --> 01:16:29.000
literally the dumbest demographic of women and a,

1236
01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:34.001
and I'm just fucking super imposing it over all women and I'm doing it on

1237
01:16:35.531 --> 01:16:40.120
purpose because it's just cause I'm childish this week I'm fucking in a bad

1238
01:16:40.121 --> 01:16:43.810
mood.
And um,
you know,

1239
01:16:45.130 --> 01:16:49.480
rather than doing some yoga and going out and getting a Veggie Omelet or

1240
01:16:49.481 --> 01:16:53.440
whatever dumb shit you supposed to do,
what you look at my fucking face,

1241
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:55.270
this bloated booze face.

1242
01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:57.280
<v 16>Okay.</v>

1243
01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:01.780
<v 15>Oh Jesus Christ.
What happened?
I wasn't,
you know,
my life was great.</v>

1244
01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:06.280
I came to New York going,
okay,
this is awesome.
You know,

1245
01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:09.680
live in a dream here and I'm going to,
I'm going eat right.

1246
01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:14.030
I'm not going to drink.
I'm going to work out every day.
And you know,

1247
01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:19.310
I dunno what happened.
Well,
I know what happened was this,

1248
01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:22.460
the second day I got here was my birthday,

1249
01:17:22.461 --> 01:17:26.240
so you got a drink on your birthday and then I just got the booze coursing

1250
01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:31.130
through my veins and then it's just,
it's just been a,
it's just been a,

1251
01:17:31.131 --> 01:17:35.000
I can't even say drunken debauchery.
It's just been sort of sad old man.

1252
01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:40.910
I've kind of been sitting there like norm in cheers.
If he didn't know anybody,

1253
01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:46.280
you know,
cliff clave and didn't come in and butcher his name with his bed,

1254
01:17:46.281 --> 01:17:50.330
Boston accent a their nomy nom.

1255
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:54.740
It's norm.
Just take the out.
If you want to do a Boston accent,

1256
01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:58.130
that's what you do.
You just take the r out.
Everything doesn't become an ae.

1257
01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.920
I know I've mentioned that before,
but uh,

1258
01:18:00.921 --> 01:18:03.380
you know how the deal is people in North Dakota.
I went there,

1259
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:07.130
Fargo when I brought up that movie and they were just like,
dude,

1260
01:18:07.131 --> 01:18:10.070
we don't fucking talk like that.
That movie was annoying,

1261
01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:14.360
but everyone else thought it was hilarious because how many of us have ever been

1262
01:18:14.361 --> 01:18:18.980
to Fargo,
North Dakota and the same thing with chairs.
You know,

1263
01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:24.170
everybody thinks that that's how they say norm.
They say Nami now they don't,

1264
01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:28.910
they say norm.
All right.
Does this make any fucking sense?

1265
01:18:28.911 --> 01:18:33.050
This is just like,
I am like a,
I'm just cut to the week right now.
Um,

1266
01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:37.010
what else did I want to talk about that I do anything this week?

1267
01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.210
I don't think I did anything.

1268
01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:41.600
I started to read a book was reading a book on the mob.

1269
01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:44.420
Why don't I just start reading some shit cause I'm actually,

1270
01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:46.670
this is my last day of shooting and I'm excited.

1271
01:18:46.671 --> 01:18:51.170
I'm really excited about this scene because I have the most lines of any scene,

1272
01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:56.060
you know,
and uh,
and he seen that I,
that I've been in,

1273
01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:00.260
which means I have 1.5 now.
I'm kidding.
Actually got like two or three lines,

1274
01:19:00.261 --> 01:19:04.490
which is going to be cool.
And I'm really excited to do this shit,
but,
uh,

1275
01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.800
I got to get this fucking podcast out of the way.

1276
01:19:06.801 --> 01:19:11.640
Can you tell him scrolling down?
Um,
all right,
here's one.
I got this,

1277
01:19:11.641 --> 01:19:14.990
this dude in England who always fucking emails me and uh,

1278
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:20.830
I guess he was sick of me not re reading his questions or whatever.

1279
01:19:20.841 --> 01:19:25.580
So in the title,
whatever you call it,
the subject line,
he said,
read this,

1280
01:19:25.581 --> 01:19:30.110
you fucking cunt.
So of course they have to open it.
And he said,
sorry,

1281
01:19:30.111 --> 01:19:33.020
you're not a content.
I just need to get your attention.
All right.
Hey,

1282
01:19:33.021 --> 01:19:36.590
bill dynamite podcast this week.
Or should I say last week?
Well,

1283
01:19:36.591 --> 01:19:39.140
because it's Wednesday and oh look,

1284
01:19:39.170 --> 01:19:42.740
no Monday morning podcasts because I was really looking forward to hearing you

1285
01:19:42.741 --> 01:19:46.580
talk about your dog for 40 minutes again,
dude,
we get it.

1286
01:19:46.730 --> 01:19:49.820
You have a dog.
No one cares.
Be funnier.

1287
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:55.220
I,
that's my main point.

1288
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:57.140
Also rename the podcast.

1289
01:19:57.141 --> 01:20:02.141
Bill birth speaks for 40 minutes because for a start it's hardly ever out on a

1290
01:20:02.811 --> 01:20:05.510
Monday.
And also you do ramble aimlessly.

1291
01:20:07.930 --> 01:20:10.990
Uh,
it's called the podcast.
You fucking moron.

1292
01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:13.120
What do you think a podcast is?

1293
01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:18.810
Are there a bunch of podcast out there where people aren't babbling aimlessly?

1294
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:24.110
Podcasts are basically fucking radio shows for people who weren't good enough to

1295
01:20:24.271 --> 01:20:25.530
be on the fucking radio.

1296
01:20:25.531 --> 01:20:29.520
So I don't know what's what level of quality you're looking for here,

1297
01:20:29.521 --> 01:20:32.400
but you really need to lower your standards.
All right,

1298
01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:35.640
and who the fuck says dynamite?
And they still saying that over there.

1299
01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:37.350
Did you guys just get good times?

1300
01:20:38.530 --> 01:20:38.930
<v 16>Yeah.</v>

1301
01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:42.630
<v 15>All right,
here we go.
Let's continue here.
Um,
anyways,
uh,</v>

1302
01:20:42.631 --> 01:20:46.320
I'm not trying to trash you because sometimes it's great.
Oh,
that's cool.

1303
01:20:46.321 --> 01:20:47.760
I'm glad.
Sometimes it's great.

1304
01:20:47.970 --> 01:20:51.600
I just think bill birth speaks for 40 minutes is a better title.

1305
01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:56.670
Take a lead my advice,
but my main point,
stop talking about the dog.
It kills me.

1306
01:20:56.700 --> 01:21:00.930
I fast forward when,
when,
uh,
when you do,

1307
01:21:00.931 --> 01:21:04.050
nobody cares about your fucking dog.
But apart from that,

1308
01:21:04.051 --> 01:21:08.810
the show is great and I love your work.
One quick question.
Um,

1309
01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:11.720
I can see how it'd be annoying if I was talking to my dog.

1310
01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:14.400
I know there's a bunch of animal lovers right now.
Listen to this going.
No,

1311
01:21:14.401 --> 01:21:19.260
I really am.
Giant.
Fuck you dude.
I love my dog.
All right.

1312
01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:22.560
Why don't you go get some fish and chips and not brush your teeth or whatever

1313
01:21:22.561 --> 01:21:25.380
other hacky fucking thing you guys do over there.
Huh?

1314
01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:31.530
Geeta pork chop for breakfast.
Yeah,
man.
I'm trying to think.

1315
01:21:31.531 --> 01:21:33.690
The last good looking person that came from England,

1316
01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:37.970
pay towns in with that warp knows

1317
01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:42.980
was there anybody good looking even what's his face?

1318
01:21:42.981 --> 01:21:47.540
Roger Daltrey who wasn't shape,
but his face is just,
it's just beat,

1319
01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:51.440
just beat down,
man.
He's just weathered,
weathered,
fucking people over there.

1320
01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:55.400
Um,
I can't,
I don't think I've ever remembered that.

1321
01:21:55.540 --> 01:22:00.080
Anybody ever saying they met some hot chicken England?
I've heard it.
You know,

1322
01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:01.910
you go to France,
you go to Sweden,

1323
01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:07.730
you know you go to Spain,
right?
You go to Puerto Rico,

1324
01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:11.600
there's all kinds of fucking hot women.
You go to England

1325
01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.960
to look at the royal family.

1326
01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:19.200
Actually Princess Diana was kind of hot,

1327
01:22:19.201 --> 01:22:21.360
but she had weird fucking hands and feet.

1328
01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:25.650
She looked like she was part lizard juice.
Does she live like a beautiful lizard?

1329
01:22:25.651 --> 01:22:29.760
That's what she lets what she looked like and Prince Charles looks like,

1330
01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:31.740
um,
ah,
you know what?

1331
01:22:31.741 --> 01:22:34.890
I don't have the fucking medical background to talk about how in bread that guy

1332
01:22:34.891 --> 01:22:35.724
is.

1333
01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:36.890
<v 16>Okay.</v>

1334
01:22:36.890 --> 01:22:41.450
<v 15>You know what I mean?
But he just basically,
I dunno,
I dunno what he has.</v>

1335
01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:45.110
He has one of whatever the fuck he has and it's all the same coursing through

1336
01:22:45.111 --> 01:22:48.600
his fucking body,
whatever.
If I fell of a regular Mug,

1337
01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:50.870
human being has to shut up hill.

1338
01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:52.970
You're too fucking stupid to go through with this.
All right,

1339
01:22:52.971 --> 01:22:57.920
one quick question bill.
How long did it take to crack the standup scene?

1340
01:22:58.310 --> 01:23:01.580
I mean,
when you started getting decent money and radio spots?

1341
01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:04.820
Uh,
let's see.

1342
01:23:04.821 --> 01:23:09.670
Well took me three and a half years before I quit my day job,

1343
01:23:09.671 --> 01:23:14.671
but I was living at home and I saved every dime that I made from work that I

1344
01:23:14.891 --> 01:23:19.840
could.
And I also saved every dime that I was making from um,

1345
01:23:20.150 --> 01:23:24.820
stand up.
And I basically saved up 10 grand,

1346
01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:27.460
which believe it or not,

1347
01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:31.690
you can do if you don't run out and buy every new fucking I iPhone,

1348
01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:36.250
iPod and all laptops and all that shit.
I didn't do any of that.

1349
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:41.650
I just dressed like Malcolm young and ACDC jeans and tee shirt.

1350
01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:43.090
I had a fucking,

1351
01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:47.380
I had this old pickup truck that I used to drive two wheel drive,

1352
01:23:47.381 --> 01:23:52.150
one of the little little ones.
And I drove that until it fucking died.

1353
01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:58.140
And I was at this critical point where I was only a year into my standup career

1354
01:24:00.281 --> 01:24:02.170
and I needed a reliable car,

1355
01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:06.100
but I also didn't want to be chained to my job by,

1356
01:24:06.190 --> 01:24:10.060
by buying a new car,
which is the dumbest fucking thing you can do.

1357
01:24:10.090 --> 01:24:14.350
If you're in your 20s and you got some job and it's not your business,

1358
01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:17.560
it's not your own business and you know you want to leave it at some point,

1359
01:24:17.561 --> 01:24:20.800
the dumbest fucking thing you can do is go out and buy a brand new car.

1360
01:24:21.730 --> 01:24:26.020
You just change yourself to your desk.
I know I've said this before,

1361
01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:27.520
but it's like that.
You don't remember.

1362
01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:32.521
You remember in a Bronx tale when those bikers are acting like assholes and they

1363
01:24:33.041 --> 01:24:35.650
ask them to leave and they don't leave and then they fucking,
you know,

1364
01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:40.120
put the thing on the door and then Chazz Palminteri goes,
now you can't leave.

1365
01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:41.060
You're,
you're,

1366
01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:44.980
you're doing the financial equivalent of that scene when you go out and buy a

1367
01:24:44.981 --> 01:24:47.920
brand new fucking car.
Okay?
First of all,

1368
01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:50.230
you can afford a good car.

1369
01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:55.680
You just got to get some generic fucking twenty thousand twenty five thousand

1370
01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:59.350
dollars stupid ass fucking car.
And it,
it's,
it's,
it's gonna,

1371
01:24:59.830 --> 01:25:02.050
it's gonna change the desk.
So long story short,

1372
01:25:02.051 --> 01:25:05.500
what I did was instead of buying a new car was I,
I just,

1373
01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:09.080
I had a new engine put in my foot in my truck and everybody,

1374
01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:13.150
all the fucking people at work told me that's the dumbest thing.
Do,
what do you,

1375
01:25:13.151 --> 01:25:14.940
when it do you would do for you?
Fuck them.

1376
01:25:15.230 --> 01:25:19.480
A really cost me 50 things at the time cause it costs about 1500 bucks to get

1377
01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:20.440
the whole thing done.
Right.

1378
01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:25.090
As opposed to having a $15,000 car loan.

1379
01:25:25.210 --> 01:25:29.200
I had the fucking engine paid off,
you know,
and about four or five months,

1380
01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:31.900
then I had no car payment again.
And I could,

1381
01:25:31.901 --> 01:25:35.080
I could use that to put towards my nest egg.
And My,

1382
01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:39.100
my idea when I went down to New York was I was going to get a day job.

1383
01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:41.940
But,
uh,
you know,
uh,
you know,

1384
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:45.550
I waited a couple of weeks before I started looking and I started doing standup

1385
01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:49.420
and then I got a couple of gigs and they were on the road so I couldn't get a

1386
01:25:49.421 --> 01:25:53.650
day job and believe me,
my 10 grand was fucking going down,
down,
down,
down,
down.

1387
01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:58.540
But it bought me enough fucking time where I could,
uh,

1388
01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:04.850
I could get in with the clubs,
start getting gigs.
And,

1389
01:26:04.851 --> 01:26:07.490
um,
what ended up happening,

1390
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:11.870
I think I went all the way down to like fucking 2,500 bucks.

1391
01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:17.970
And,
uh,
I think that's when,

1392
01:26:17.971 --> 01:26:20.270
then I started booking shit.
That's what happened.

1393
01:26:20.271 --> 01:26:23.570
Then I started booking shit and I was able to sustain,

1394
01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:28.070
um,
it didn't dip below 2,500,

1395
01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:30.890
but it didn't really get above three grand either.

1396
01:26:30.891 --> 01:26:34.670
I got to that point where I could,
I could basically pay my bills.

1397
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:38.750
And,
uh,
that's also back when somebody told me about,
you know,

1398
01:26:39.230 --> 01:26:41.090
paying off your fucking credit cards

1399
01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:45.590
every month so you don't get fucked with the,
uh,
on the interest.

1400
01:26:45.591 --> 01:26:48.980
I started doing that and I basically,

1401
01:26:48.981 --> 01:26:52.460
I ate spaghetti like every fucking night.
Pasta is a really cheap meal.

1402
01:26:52.461 --> 01:26:55.880
It fills you up.
I told you about this shit before and when I went on the road,

1403
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:59.540
I would go to Denny's or the international house of pancakes and I get the large

1404
01:26:59.541 --> 01:27:00.980
stack of pancakes in the morning.

1405
01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:05.000
I get to five stack and they would sit in my stomach like fucking cement.

1406
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:09.260
And I could literally go from like eight in the morning to eight at night

1407
01:27:09.261 --> 01:27:11.480
without eating.
And you know,

1408
01:27:11.481 --> 01:27:15.770
I drive my little rented fucking dodge neon to some college gig.
There you go.

1409
01:27:15.771 --> 01:27:18.470
When you get a college Gig,
that's a big thing.
So about three and a half years.

1410
01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:21.110
All right,
I'm sorry dude.
Was that fucking boring?

1411
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:25.010
I know I didn't talk about my dog and do an I am just breaking your balls

1412
01:27:25.011 --> 01:27:25.341
sometimes.

1413
01:27:25.341 --> 01:27:28.100
Like people give me shit and I give him shit back and people think I'm serious.

1414
01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.750
I really don't give a fuck.
Um,
all right,
now here's is overrated,
underrated list.

1415
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:37.130
Overrated bill burrs dog.
No one cares.
Bruce Springsteen,

1416
01:27:37.131 --> 01:27:41.330
bloated overrated stadium rocker.
Barack Obama.
He can't,

1417
01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:44.330
he can't hide behind the black forever.

1418
01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:46.640
The economy is still fucked.

1419
01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:51.980
Uh,
Jesus Christ.
Dude,
did you even proofread this?

1420
01:27:51.981 --> 01:27:56.350
He can't hide behind the black forever.
The economy is still fucked.
Um,

1421
01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:00.840
dude,
I dunno if you've fucking notice,
but we had a,
uh,

1422
01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:06.680
we've had a war for a good fucking seven years to the tune of $1 billion a month

1423
01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:11.681
and bankers loaned out money to homeless people and we had to bail them out.

1424
01:28:11.811 --> 01:28:16.550
So I think I don't give a shit.
Who the fuck you are.
A Republican Democrat.

1425
01:28:16.670 --> 01:28:20.780
Liberal,
conservative.
Fucking independent.
You,

1426
01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:24.290
you're not getting us out of this,
which is why I am going to Sweden.

1427
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:27.710
I have a gig coming up in Sweden and the end of August,

1428
01:28:28.130 --> 01:28:32.290
I'm going to start doing a Australia once a year.
Um,

1429
01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:36.110
this talks about me going to Dublin.
These fucking overseas gigs,

1430
01:28:36.111 --> 01:28:39.200
they're very hard to get.
You know,
shit usually ends up falling out,

1431
01:28:39.201 --> 01:28:43.880
but that's my thing.
All right.
If these corporations are going global,

1432
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:47.720
going global too.
I don't give a fuck.
I'll be the goddamned James Bond,

1433
01:28:47.721 --> 01:28:52.580
a comedy James Bond.
I Dunno.
International Man of jokes,

1434
01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:55.100
um,
underrated arctic monkeys.

1435
01:28:56.260 --> 01:29:00.740
It's a great British band from Sheffield,
England,
cocaine,

1436
01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:05.610
brilliant song by Eric Clapton.
Dude,
you must be young.
Okay.
That song's great.

1437
01:29:05.611 --> 01:29:10.460
The first 40,000 times you hear it,
it,
it,
Eh,

1438
01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:16.320
um,
underrated football slash soccer,
easily the best sport ever.

1439
01:29:16.321 --> 01:29:19.740
Hands down.
Um,
you know what?
I wouldn't argue that,

1440
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:22.170
I wouldn't argue that because if you actually,
if you,

1441
01:29:22.171 --> 01:29:23.400
if you watch American soccer,

1442
01:29:23.401 --> 01:29:25.680
it's sucks like an American team versus an American team.

1443
01:29:25.681 --> 01:29:27.330
But if you watch that oversee shit,

1444
01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:32.900
you know where people fucking die and people get trampled and crushed to death

1445
01:29:33.570 --> 01:29:38.160
and then they go on youtube and talk about how dumb Americans are.
Um,
you know,

1446
01:29:38.161 --> 01:29:39.930
you'd think what those awful English teeth,

1447
01:29:39.931 --> 01:29:42.690
you could eat your way through the fence when you're getting crushed up against,

1448
01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:52.260
ah,
to people in England even have bad teeth or was my entire fucking,
uh,

1449
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.890
<v 1>okay.</v>

1450
01:29:53.890 --> 01:29:57.580
<v 15>Understanding of England,
basically three Austin power movies.
All right.</v>

1451
01:29:57.581 --> 01:30:01.510
Probably is.
All right,
let's talk about grenades again this week.

1452
01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:04.720
Um,
I asked somebody a,
when you throw a grenade,

1453
01:30:04.721 --> 01:30:07.960
how long do you have before the fucking thing goes off?
And it said Bill,

1454
01:30:07.961 --> 01:30:12.460
three to four seconds sounds about right.
Uh,
I'm still amazed at that.

1455
01:30:12.461 --> 01:30:16.840
Crazy son of a bitch who was filming,
didn't use a tripod.
Some shit.
Oh yeah.

1456
01:30:16.841 --> 01:30:20.710
If you guys want to see what a fucking grenade does,
go on youtube.

1457
01:30:20.711 --> 01:30:24.900
Look up grenade and washing machine.
I believe that's what you search.
Uh,

1458
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:26.980
some Army Guy,
cause I asked last week,
you know,

1459
01:30:26.981 --> 01:30:29.160
whenever you see a those army movies,

1460
01:30:29.161 --> 01:30:33.850
somebody dives on a fucking grenade and uh,
you know,

1461
01:30:33.851 --> 01:30:36.940
saves the life of his comrades.
Um,

1462
01:30:36.941 --> 01:30:39.820
I don't know this conflicting advice that I got on this shit.
You know what dude,

1463
01:30:39.821 --> 01:30:42.080
I'm fucking losing it right now.
This podcast is,

1464
01:30:42.081 --> 01:30:46.780
is quickly spinning out of control because I haven't eaten yet.
And uh,

1465
01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:49.780
I have an early pickup today and if I don't do it now,

1466
01:30:49.781 --> 01:30:52.260
it's not going to be coming out on Monday.
So why don't I,

1467
01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:56.350
I'm just gonna Start Reading Shit here.
Um,
all right.

1468
01:30:56.351 --> 01:30:58.270
If you want to talk about weaponry,
what,
what the,

1469
01:30:58.271 --> 01:31:02.380
what is the question I asked last week?
Oh,
I asked,
I asked,
uh,

1470
01:31:02.381 --> 01:31:05.950
if there's any people in the military,
if they had any,
uh,
combat stories,

1471
01:31:05.951 --> 01:31:08.890
because I was talking about,
you know,

1472
01:31:08.891 --> 01:31:11.140
whenever you fantasize about going to war,

1473
01:31:11.410 --> 01:31:15.730
you always picture yourself doing some Rambo Shit.
But in the back of your head,

1474
01:31:15.731 --> 01:31:20.440
you know that there's a strong possibility that you might be that fucking dude

1475
01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:25.690
who when the shit goes down,
you can't move.
You freeze or you're fucking

1476
01:31:27.150 --> 01:31:30.480
balled up in the fetal position crying.
You know,

1477
01:31:31.230 --> 01:31:34.410
I heard a story one time is sometimes in battle people just stand up.

1478
01:31:34.411 --> 01:31:37.620
They can't deal with it anymore and they just killed themselves.
Granted,

1479
01:31:37.770 --> 01:31:41.670
I heard that from my high school teacher who's teaching the English.

1480
01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:45.630
And uh,
he had never been to war,
you know,

1481
01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:50.380
so that's probably bullshit.
Anyway,
so here's a guy who actually went to combat.

1482
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:50.851
He said,
Bill,

1483
01:31:50.851 --> 01:31:53.700
you asking your podcast about the first time you're outside the wire,

1484
01:31:53.701 --> 01:31:58.701
which is military jargon for leaving protected base in Iraq or Afghanistan.

1485
01:31:59.470 --> 01:32:03.160
And this dude said I was absolutely terrified for the first couple of weeks.

1486
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:06.820
But the trick is that you can't let anybody around you know that you're scared

1487
01:32:06.821 --> 01:32:09.640
because you don't want it.
You don't want to look like a pussy.
Uh,

1488
01:32:09.641 --> 01:32:11.770
the rules of engagement are strict.

1489
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:14.630
We were ordered to not shoot back unless we could.

1490
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:19.710
We could see who was shooting at us.
Is that true?

1491
01:32:21.630 --> 01:32:24.900
You couldn't shoot back unless you saw who was shooting back at you?
Dude,
uh,

1492
01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:29.920
I would break that rule if I wasn't on the ground crying in the fetal position.

1493
01:32:30.081 --> 01:32:30.914
Yeah.

1494
01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:33.580
<v 17>Good man is I don't want to do this.</v>

1495
01:32:33.930 --> 01:32:35.790
<v 15>If I could actually get past that,</v>

1496
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:39.660
I would be definitely shooting in the general fucking direction of wherever it

1497
01:32:39.661 --> 01:32:42.570
was to do fuck that.
Fuck that.

1498
01:32:44.130 --> 01:32:48.630
This war is different from other wars and so far as we are fighting right in the

1499
01:32:48.631 --> 01:32:53.580
middle of where normal people lived and we tried hard not to kill any of them.

1500
01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:58.980
Um,
you know what,
I'm not a student of military history,

1501
01:32:58.981 --> 01:33:01.860
but I think most wars are kind of where people are at.

1502
01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:03.380
<v 16>Okay.</v>

1503
01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:03.771
<v 15>Um,</v>

1504
01:33:03.771 --> 01:33:07.280
I think back in the revolutionary days that you would go out and stand in a line

1505
01:33:07.281 --> 01:33:10.640
out in the field or even in the civil war.

1506
01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:16.100
But,
uh,
I know they had the front in World War One,

1507
01:33:16.101 --> 01:33:19.670
but at some point when you're kicking the other team's ass,

1508
01:33:20.150 --> 01:33:24.560
you end up in their backyard.
Cause a lot of them don't just give up like,

1509
01:33:24.561 --> 01:33:26.900
well you,
you beat us on our field.

1510
01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:32.360
We wouldn't want to go into this town and hide amongst the civilians.
You know,

1511
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:36.640
am I wrong there?
I'm proud.
I don't know if I'm wrong.
How did I,

1512
01:33:36.641 --> 01:33:38.900
how does Dresden happen if,
if,
if

1513
01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.670
you know,
I don't know.

1514
01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:45.850
<v 16>Okay.</v>

1515
01:33:45.850 --> 01:33:47.680
<v 15>Well I don't fucking know,
Dude.
I'm out of it.
Let's,</v>

1516
01:33:47.690 --> 01:33:50.980
let's just get to the fucking questions for the week and uh,

1517
01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:58.100
I can,
I can gradually fucking bail out of this thing.
Um,
oh,
okay.
Overrated.

1518
01:33:58.101 --> 01:34:02.090
Underrated Bill.
People Bitch about the,
uh,
gas prices are a,

1519
01:34:03.710 --> 01:34:04.730
I guess overrated bill.

1520
01:34:04.731 --> 01:34:08.180
People Bitch about the greedy oil companies whenever they are a high gas prices

1521
01:34:08.181 --> 01:34:13.181
and also about how there are no alternative energy options for transportation.

1522
01:34:13.670 --> 01:34:16.220
What they don't seem to understand is that no sane entrepreneur,

1523
01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:20.480
entrepreneur is going to invest at diamond developing alternative energy until

1524
01:34:20.481 --> 01:34:24.860
gas gets to $10 a gallon and people are converting their vacuum cleaners into

1525
01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:29.660
segues to get to work.
We can either have one or the other.
Um,

1526
01:34:30.230 --> 01:34:34.610
dude,
um,
it's not quite as simplistic as that.
Yeah,

1527
01:34:34.611 --> 01:34:38.060
there definitely has to be some sort of outrage from the people.
But uh,

1528
01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:40.120
<v 16>okay.</v>

1529
01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.480
<v 15>You know what,
rather than get into fucking details,</v>

1530
01:34:42.481 --> 01:34:47.481
look up a guy stand mayor m e y e r at this guy actually came up with a car that

1531
01:34:48.421 --> 01:34:52.200
ran on water,
rain water,
fresh water,
salt water.

1532
01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:55.860
It didn't make a fucking difference and he basically figured out a way where you

1533
01:34:55.861 --> 01:34:57.120
could get across the country,

1534
01:34:57.290 --> 01:35:02.290
14 and a half gallons and the dumb fuck told people about it,

1535
01:35:02.391 --> 01:35:05.270
went to the news,
they announced it on,
uh,

1536
01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:07.580
we played it on the opiate Anthony show.

1537
01:35:08.630 --> 01:35:12.020
They talked about it on the news and then they said that there was somebody from

1538
01:35:12.021 --> 01:35:13.700
the Pentagon who was so excited.

1539
01:35:13.701 --> 01:35:16.760
They sent a lieutenant colonel out there to check out his device.

1540
01:35:17.690 --> 01:35:20.780
Basically what happens is when you come up with some shit like that is they go

1541
01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:24.860
out there and they,
they sort of tell you that it's very wise for you to buy,

1542
01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:29.870
to sell them the patent of it,
you know?
And then if you don't play ball,

1543
01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:34.820
you mysteriously die four or five years later and your invention disappears.

1544
01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:39.170
Stand mayor,
look it up.
That's what the fuck happens.
All right dude.
Um,

1545
01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:41.750
I've always used the iPod.
I used to do a bit about this shit.

1546
01:35:41.751 --> 01:35:46.010
You're telling me basically that I can have my entire fucking record collection,

1547
01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:50.210
you know,
8,000 fucking songs in my pocket,

1548
01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:54.140
but they can't come up with a car that can't do better with the gas mileage.

1549
01:35:54.141 --> 01:35:57.860
Dude.
It's all bullshit.
Would you basically have at the top as you have ra,

1550
01:35:57.890 --> 01:36:01.550
the robber baron,
blue blood blood families and uh,

1551
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:06.110
some of the underworld guys who went legitimate and the government is middle

1552
01:36:06.111 --> 01:36:10.640
management for these motherfuckers and the guys at the top,
they run everything.

1553
01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:14.960
Banks are at the top and then the blue blood guys,

1554
01:36:14.961 --> 01:36:19.850
I think the corporations are the next level.
And then it's the politicians.

1555
01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:23.540
Okay.
And this is coming from a completely uninformed Jack Ass.
Fuck that.

1556
01:36:23.541 --> 01:36:26.360
I've read a couple of books,
but I think that that's what's going on.

1557
01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:29.630
That's what's going on.
And you know,

1558
01:36:29.810 --> 01:36:33.320
I don't know how you can invent shit nowadays and actually get it up to the

1559
01:36:33.321 --> 01:36:34.154
public.

1560
01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:38.750
You have to basically be working for a corporation that has the money to put it

1561
01:36:38.751 --> 01:36:42.410
out there.
So then basically they own it.
You know what I mean?

1562
01:36:43.850 --> 01:36:48.020
I guess you could kind of try and be the Tyler Perry of fucking inventing shit.

1563
01:36:48.690 --> 01:36:51.620
Um,
you know,
what,
can I just tap out of this fucking podcast?

1564
01:36:51.650 --> 01:36:54.170
I don't even know what the hell I'm talking about.
I'm fucking on the road.

1565
01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:57.500
I'm lonely.
I want to see my fucking dog.
I want to get back to my girl.

1566
01:36:57.501 --> 01:37:02.060
I'm going to get back to my fucking life and I want to do a good job today on

1567
01:37:02.061 --> 01:37:06.440
set.
So I don't fuck this thing up because I've had a great guy damn time.
And,

1568
01:37:06.441 --> 01:37:08.450
um,
I fly back

1569
01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:14.570
in a couple of days and a couple of fucking days and I'm really looking forward

1570
01:37:14.571 --> 01:37:16.000
to it.
Oh,
did I tell you guys?
I A,

1571
01:37:16.001 --> 01:37:18.740
I bought the hangover when I was drunk in the bar.

1572
01:37:18.741 --> 01:37:23.200
I bought the hangover of some fucking,
uh,
I dunno,

1573
01:37:23.210 --> 01:37:27.170
50 year old Asian woman came walking in,
you know,
it was great.

1574
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:30.830
It was like fucking
portable,

1575
01:37:30.831 --> 01:37:35.570
a blockbuster video and I bought the hangover for five bucks.

1576
01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:41.240
Great bootleg copy.
Only a couple of times did somebody stand up and walk by?

1577
01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:41.930
Do you got,
you know,

1578
01:37:41.930 --> 01:37:45.390
that's the great thing about living in New York is all the bootleg movies that

1579
01:37:45.391 --> 01:37:46.370
she can fucking buy.

1580
01:37:46.850 --> 01:37:50.780
And it basically someone just goes into the movie theater with a video camera

1581
01:37:50.781 --> 01:37:54.620
and they just film the screen and it's great cause you can hear other people

1582
01:37:54.621 --> 01:37:55.454
laughing.

1583
01:37:55.770 --> 01:37:59.400
It's kind of like mystery science theater and then somebody can adjust their,

1584
01:37:59.430 --> 01:38:03.180
their seat in front and all of a sudden you see somebody's head and you're

1585
01:38:03.181 --> 01:38:05.340
trying to look around it,
you know,

1586
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.520
or somebody just gets up in the middle and starts walking down the row.
And it's,

1587
01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:14.490
it's funny to me,
but,
uh,
I actually,
I saw it,
man.
I was all right.

1588
01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:20.040
It was,
it was fucking all right.
I guess five bucks.
Can you complaint?

1589
01:38:20.041 --> 01:38:20.761
Can you complain?

1590
01:38:20.761 --> 01:38:24.420
I wish I met this lady at the beginning of my fucking a trip out here.

1591
01:38:24.421 --> 01:38:27.480
I would've had,
I would've bought like 58 of them.
Yeah.

1592
01:38:27.481 --> 01:38:30.980
So next time you're in New York,
all right.

1593
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:34.170
And that the cute little Asian lady comes walking and going,

1594
01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:38.070
am I really doing this?
Am I advocating the stealing of shit?
I think it's over.

1595
01:38:38.071 --> 01:38:41.940
Anyways,
people send me emails.
Hey,
I listen to all your running forms.
Uh,

1596
01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:44.670
I downloaded them for free.
Sorry.

1597
01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:47.580
They always got to tell you that they got your shit for free.
And then they say,

1598
01:38:47.581 --> 01:38:49.770
sorry.
You know what I mean?

1599
01:38:51.930 --> 01:38:55.860
I pay for my music.
She fucking cunts pay for my comedy.
All right,
whatever.

1600
01:38:55.890 --> 01:38:58.110
That's the end of this podcast.
Um,

1601
01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:04.380
I'm literally dizzy right now.
Uh,
the fucking my hyping.
All right,

1602
01:39:04.381 --> 01:39:07.410
next week I go back to my life as a standup comedian.

1603
01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:12.330
I'm going to be at the punchline in San Francisco,
uh,
on Monday,

1604
01:39:12.570 --> 01:39:13.920
July the 13th,

1605
01:39:14.250 --> 01:39:17.760
and I'm doing two shows and it's going to be just like the last time where I'm

1606
01:39:17.761 --> 01:39:21.780
going to try to do as little material from my act as humanly possible and I'm

1607
01:39:21.781 --> 01:39:25.590
just going to tell you some fucked up stories,
uh,
from my childhood,

1608
01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:30.390
from my dating life to uh,
to whatever,
you know.

1609
01:39:31.010 --> 01:39:35.040
Um,
and then the following week I'm going to be at the comedy works in Denver,

1610
01:39:35.041 --> 01:39:39.900
Colorado.
Um,
that's the 23rd,
24th and 25th.

1611
01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:44.250
And then I believe on gearing up to do another special.

1612
01:39:44.251 --> 01:39:48.870
So I'm going to be on the road pretty much right through August,

1613
01:39:48.871 --> 01:39:51.390
September,
October,
November and December.

1614
01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:56.420
I am pretty much going to be doing three out of four weeks on the road and um,

1615
01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:02.970
I'm going to be getting this fucking special together and hopefully I will be

1616
01:40:02.971 --> 01:40:04.740
shooting it in San Francisco.
That is,

1617
01:40:04.741 --> 01:40:08.980
that is the goal to shoot it in San Francisco and uh,

1618
01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:12.450
to have a very funny,
memorable,
special.
That's what the fuck I want to do.

1619
01:40:12.451 --> 01:40:16.710
And the stress of it is already starting to hit me because,
uh,

1620
01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:22.620
I dunno,
you know,
you don't want it to suck.
You don't want it to suck.

1621
01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:27.540
The reality is,
is I wish I had another fucking six months just because I'm lazy,

1622
01:40:27.570 --> 01:40:31.350
but I know,
if at all,
it's bullshit.
All right?
I'm just,
I'm just really,

1623
01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:33.510
I'm babbling.
I need nourishment.

1624
01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:36.150
I need to stop drinking and I need to go downstairs,

1625
01:40:36.151 --> 01:40:39.270
under the treadmill and somehow get some of this fucking booze weight out of my

1626
01:40:39.271 --> 01:40:43.650
Goddamn Chin.
All right?
That's it.
That's the Monday morning podcast.

1627
01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:47.560
Um,
I,
if I had to critique this podcast,
I would say would,

1628
01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:52.080
it was like when evil Knievel tried to jump the snake river and that rocket,

1629
01:40:52.530 --> 01:40:55.360
you know,
where it started off fast and you thought I was going to fuck him.

1630
01:40:55.361 --> 01:40:57.520
That's what the I did.
You know what happened to this podcast?

1631
01:40:57.521 --> 01:41:01.840
To fucking parachute came out halfway through it and then I just slowly went

1632
01:41:01.841 --> 01:41:05.650
down towards the snake river and actually have a bloody nose right now.

1633
01:41:05.710 --> 01:41:09.910
Just like evil Knievel.
All right,
I'm going to go get some eggs.
Uh,
God bless Ya.

1634
01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:13.060
Hope to see you in a,
if you live anywhere near San Francisco,

1635
01:41:13.061 --> 01:41:15.920
hope to see you out at my gig and,
uh,

1636
01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:18.100
please keep the questions coming next week.

1637
01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:22.090
I'm going to give you a great podcast because a,
um,

1638
01:41:22.150 --> 01:41:25.120
I'll be back in my home life and I'll be eating right and I won't be drinking

1639
01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:29.080
and a brace yourself.
Douchebag from England.

1640
01:41:29.081 --> 01:41:31.960
I'm probably going to be talking about how excited I am to see my fucking dog.

1641
01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:33.490
All right.
That's it.

1642
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:39.270
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

1643
