00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.760
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:07.260
It's the Monday morning podcast from Mine Day,

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.290
June 15th,
2015.

4
00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:14.150
And I'm back in the United States.

5
00:00:14.151 --> 00:00:19.151
So United States of America and Danny

6
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.820
pigs in a blanket.
Yeah,
I'm back.
I'm back in the United States.

7
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.210
And uh,
immediately I started putting on weight when I got back here.

8
00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:34.760
Cause this is something,
I don't know what the fuck is going on with their food.

9
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.130
<v 0>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.460
<v 1>You know,
you remember a long time ago they had that book,
you know,
eat like a,</v>

11
00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:40.990
why you eat like a French woman,

12
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.610
be as skinny bench bitch like the a fucking chick over there in Paris,

13
00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:47.290
whatever the,
whatever it was called,

14
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.540
the secrets of being a skinny bitch and Paris when a,

15
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.350
you're drinking your juice in the hood,
whatever the fucking,

16
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.980
whatever the book was called.
[inaudible] it has nothing to do with it.

17
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:03.630
Their food is as of a finer quality.
And uh,

18
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.441
you know,

19
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:08.770
they're constantly having legal battles with WHO's those fucking evil con?

20
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.880
What the fuck is his name?
The people own the food,
you know,

21
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.650
Mona Sant or something like that.
Not Jesus Christ.

22
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.000
And I know this Monsanto,

23
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.250
a four k more Tony months saying,

24
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:30.090
are we owns all the fucking say Jovi.
Um,

25
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.500
yeah,
they're constantly fighting and being like,
look,

26
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:36.830
if you want to have your fucking genetically altered food over here,

27
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:41.480
you have to put it on the label that is genetically altered and these cons won't

28
00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:45.960
fucking do it.
Evidently.
Allegedly.
That's what I'm hearing.
Um,

29
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.370
now I'm also hearing that they sue organic farmers,

30
00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:53.480
like they fucking plant their food next to,
uh,
you know,

31
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.050
the property next door to the organic farmers.

32
00:01:57.051 --> 00:01:59.000
And then when the bees like cross pollinate,

33
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:03.500
then they sue the fucking organic farmer for fucking having some of their,

34
00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:06.740
uh,
I dunno some of this shit and their food,
I don't even get out of that works.

35
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.800
It's like,
well what were some of my organic stuff being some of yours?

36
00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:14.180
This is like a Reese's peanut butter cup here,
but they're bigger.
So they,
so,
um,

37
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.380
and then they fucking win.
So anyways,
all I know is um,

38
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.060
if they really have to watch what I eat in my own country and is sad cause I

39
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:26.900
want to eat like a fucking animal like I did overseas,
you know,

40
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.890
and I can still walk around and be a skinny bitch and Paris while drinking the

41
00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:35.870
juice in my hood.
Is that asking too much?
God bless America.

42
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.460
<v 0>Okay</v>

43
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.780
<v 1>land that I love.</v>

44
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.170
And those people like talk their way through a song cause they can't sing

45
00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:42.620
anymore.

46
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.440
Stand beside her and guide her through the light.

47
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.690
But tonight up above band,
still playing like Dat,
Dat da Dat,

48
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.950
exact front of mountain dew,

49
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.400
<v 0>God bless America.</v>

50
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.740
<v 1>So a little Virbrato with some point.
Um,
I'm going to dumb ass mood.</v>

51
00:03:10.741 --> 00:03:14.760
I'm still a little jet lag.
It's four 53 where I'm at right now.

52
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.700
I'm probably going to wake up my neighbors because when you live in La this
year,

53
00:03:17.701 --> 00:03:20.580
that close,
you're that close to your neighbors.

54
00:03:20.581 --> 00:03:23.760
So right now my next door neighbor,
she's probably lying there going like,

55
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.000
who the fuck is talk singing.
God bless America.

56
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.580
I got as high fuck hang five 53 and the morning,

57
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.350
I know my wife Watches that show with the ladies there whose dad is now a woman

58
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.700
and a,
you know the ones out there in Kappa Alpha,
you know,

59
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.740
the way they fucking talk.
I was sitting there,
you know,
and this is,

60
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:51.741
this was a pivotal turning point in me getting along better with my wife was I

61
00:03:52.201 --> 00:03:55.320
just gave into reality TV and I,
you know what I mean?

62
00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.190
I just dialed into my fucking inner Caitlyn Jenner and was just like,

63
00:04:01.821 --> 00:04:05.760
all right,
I'm going to fucking,
I'll feminine it up here,
right.

64
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.400
I'll tuck the package between the fucking,

65
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.720
I'll duct tape my balls and Dick to my tape for the next fucking hour and I will

66
00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:20.010
sit here and I will watch this or shit.
So I'm watching it right.

67
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.170
And uh,

68
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.710
the big one there as j law had caused her the power forward of the Kardashians.

69
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.483
All right.

70
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.670
She's driving the mere cap one and then the one who's married to the fucking a

71
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.450
Kanye West.
The always humble Kanye West.
Right.

72
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.760
And,
uh,
did drive and over just cause she's trying to figure out,
you know,

73
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.130
if the fucking or whatever,
if this BlueEdge made it to the fucking

74
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.910
hanger area.
Sorry,
I'm not trying to get on medical and you guys,

75
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.040
she's trying to see if she's pregnant or I,
what the fuck's going on?

76
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.460
So the driving to some SUV there in Wyoming,
right?

77
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.140
Because that's what rich people in California do.
They eventually,
you know,

78
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:08.260
want to pretend that they're ranchers.
So they buy a big,

79
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:11.410
they buy a spread out there in Montana or some strong and long story short,

80
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:14.320
they're driving in this fucking SUV,
right?

81
00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:16.810
The power forwards behind the wheel is j law had calls her,

82
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.200
the mere cat is in the fucking passenger seat and a else blue jeans in the back,

83
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:27.030
right?
So they fucking,
uh,

84
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.050
it's snowing in.
This truck goes by,
you know,

85
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:36.850
the truck he has like the wind or whatever you know,
is,
it goes by.
So,

86
00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:40.190
uh,
you know,
James Worthy,
there is fucking,
you know,
Whoa,

87
00:05:40.191 --> 00:05:41.560
go and look what the fuck.

88
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.640
And then they keep talking and Blahblahblahblahblah and then another truck goes

89
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:49.600
by and next thing you know she lost complete control of the car.

90
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.760
It as it's spinning,
right?
A woman in the back,
I think she's pregnant.

91
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:56.910
So she's freaking out.
Oh she's got a baby there.

92
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.600
Cute little baby is sitting there,
you know,

93
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.300
reading the fucking paper and they start spinning.
So the one in the back,

94
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.190
the mother is going,
hey,
fucking,
uh,
you know Orlando wool rich,

95
00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:16.980
what the fuck?
What's going on?
And as they're spinning,
the woman behind the,
the,

96
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.340
the fucking wheel is God is no,
I fall,
it's not my fault.
It's all my fault.

97
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.413
And they fucking,

98
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.250
they spun into oncoming traffic luckily,

99
00:06:27.251 --> 00:06:28.420
or not hit all right.

100
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.480
And then they fucking went off the road into a ditch and the big one,

101
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.730
the captain,
captain fucking Kirk took no responsibility whatsoever.

102
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.220
Was just like,
yeah.

103
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.090
And was actually mad at old splotchy back there cause she was upset with her.

104
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.060
She's going to add,
I mean,
as I,

105
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:55.160
I was Jack handed by when and it,
it blew me into some black ice.

106
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.820
It's like,
no,
you were going too fast.

107
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.450
You were driving too fucking fast for those conditions.

108
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.590
You lost control of the car with your niece in the car.

109
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.460
You fucking dope.
Right.

110
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.150
And nobody held their feet to the fire.

111
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.270
<v 0>Okay.</v>

112
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.190
<v 1>Nobody gave her an instance like you,
you are a fuck up.</v>

113
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.460
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

114
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.890
<v 1>You know,
just standing there with your fucking back of your head,</v>

115
00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:23.840
touching the top of your back,
trying to talk to her,

116
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:27.230
get torn and getting a grill right.
Staring up from her navel,

117
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.000
looking between her teddies seeing a half or two nostrils,
just yelling out,
hey,

118
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.450
you fucked up lady.
Right.
None of them said that.

119
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.050
And then they just like the dare fucking just standing there going like,

120
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:41.600
Eh,

121
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.600

122
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:57.050

And,

123
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.200
and it's always just say hi.

124
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.130
<v 0>Okay.</v>

125
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:07.130
<v 1>And this media came down at our house and it slammed in to the roof above my bad</v>

126
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:15.260
route.
Uh,
half a second I thought I was going to die.

127
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:19.850
I was like so scared.

128
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:29.020
So I am standing up pacing in the living room now.

129
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.640
Like the fucking,
I dunno,

130
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.990
some fucking pissed off coach who's trying to stay inside the coach's box so he

131
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:40.460
doesn't get a technical and I'm fucking screaming at the TV like a bad call was

132
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:44.780
made completely forgot that I was going to sit there and try and get along with

133
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:49.550
my wife by watching this horse shit.
And I'm yelling at the TV.

142
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.140

Stop being powerless.
You Moron.
Alright.

144

You have total control of that fucking situation.
You just drive a little slower,

145
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:37.620
you drive a little slow.
Um,

146
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.360
anyways.
Anyway,
I shouldn't be making fun of them.

147
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.270
You know what they're going through right now.
What they're having to deal with,

148
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:50.100
you know,
lefties,
white,
black gays,
my up and down his back end.

149
00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:54.870
Why inside out Doda Dad and now Bruce is fucking Kaitlin.
Right.

150
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.170
I really,
I really hold farm on that.

151
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.290
That people can not get upset with anybody in that family.

152
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.360
If this is still a little fucking wigged out that dad did,

153
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.590
dad is now their mom.
You know what I mean?

154
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:13.110
Just exactly what is the average time it takes,

155
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:18.420
you know,
for you to fucking get your head around that,
you know,

156
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.900
I dunno my white shit and going out.
He's shown his fucking Teddy's to his kids.

157
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.110
It's just like he's doing what I,
I mean,
I don't know.
Is that true?

158
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.070
If that's true,
I don't give a fuck.
That's just wrong and all kinds of levels.

159
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.300
You know what I mean?
I know.
I get it.
I get it.

160
00:10:33.301 --> 00:10:37.260
You're coming back from the mall and you got a little la shop shopper's high

161
00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:40.140
going on and you want to show what you got,
but the tits,

162
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.500
right when you were guided,
you take your balls out and shown to,

163
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.970
no you didn't.
You don't do that.

164
00:10:47.971 --> 00:10:52.971
You don't show you sexual goods to your fucking kids and then compile it with

165
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:58.650
new sexual goods.
Right.
And it's not like new and improved like,
Hey,

166
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.580
I've got my dick and large.
No,
I fucking,

167
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:09.780
I got some debts now.
Would you like to see them?
No,
Dad.

168
00:11:09.781 --> 00:11:14.280
I mean,
mom,
I wouldn't,
Jesus Christ.

169
00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:17.100
Kaitlin,
can you put your fucking new tits away?

170
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.480
Is that asking too much?
You're already took all my rouge.

171
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.750
Now you're going to take your tits out.

172
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.040
I mean,
I'm sitting in a car and I shall as power.

173
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.460
I was like Sam Scott or you took,

174
00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:38.530
you have techs out dad.
It was like Thai sky.

175
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:40.500
<v 2>Okay.</v>

176
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.050
<v 1>I was like,
is my dad taking his Ted Tower?
Right?
Yeah.</v>

177
00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.750
I was like Bruce,
I mean Kayla.
I mean,
what the fuck?

178
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.210
Jesus Christ.
You know what I mean?
You think you have enough?
Dude,

179
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.810
I haven't been having the week.
I don't know.
You haven't?
No.
You haven't.

180
00:11:54.811 --> 00:11:57.830
You been having a nice regular fucking time.
I got news for you.

181
00:11:57.831 --> 00:12:02.160
You've been having a time.
That is yes,
that is right.
Is fucking rain.

182
00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.860
Do you want to stand me?
Well

183
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.950
anyways.
What are some of the other shit that people want to,
uh,

184
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.520
wanted me to talk about this week?
Um,
I don't.
Oh,

185
00:12:14.521 --> 00:12:16.080
here's what another thing I don't understand.

186
00:12:16.081 --> 00:12:20.850
Like I get the kids being freaked out by Caitlin.
I get that.

187
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.130
You know what I mean?
I get that they need some time on that.
What?

188
00:12:23.131 --> 00:12:24.480
That makes total fucking sense.

189
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:27.870
What I don't understand is people flipping out about this white chick who said

190
00:12:27.871 --> 00:12:31.620
she was black and everybody's going,
she's actually white.

191
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.760
She's saying she's black.
She's got odds are fucking Tana Dude.

192
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.020
And she fucking kicked up a,
Hey,
what the fuck?
Like I,

193
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.990
this is what I don't understand.
Who gives a fuck?

194
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:47.310
I don't give a shit if she says she's Portuguese,
I don't care.

195
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.610
That's what the fuck she wants.
I don't give a fuck.

196
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.140
<v 3>Okay.</v>

197
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.550
<v 1>You want me to go?
It goes back to Bruce Jenner.</v>

198
00:12:53.551 --> 00:12:55.230
I don't give a shit that he wants to be a woman,
but I mean,

199
00:12:55.231 --> 00:13:00.060
you got to understand people got out.
Whoa.
Oh,
it's going on here.
You know,

200
00:13:00.061 --> 00:13:02.070
you gotta give you gotta keep people a couple of weeks

201
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.560
bros.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Katie.
Do Kolby Kay.

202
00:13:10.561 --> 00:13:14.730
It's Caitlin.
I all right.
Sorry.
Sorry,
Kaitlin.

203
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.383
Um,

204
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:18.750
<v 3>okay.</v>

205
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.110
<v 1>Anyways,
yeah.
This white chick who said she was black,
right.
Um,</v>

206
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:26.700
the only thing I think was fucked up on of all of that,

207
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.840
Rachel was her name,
which should have been a dead giveaway.

208
00:13:30.841 --> 00:13:34.590
Have you ever met a black woman named Rachel and I got righteous.

209
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.530
You look so dope today.
I got right.

210
00:13:38.531 --> 00:13:42.870
Jill came out and she was like sad fly.
Um,
all right,

211
00:13:42.871 --> 00:13:47.210
Rachel Dolce Dolce Dolezal.

212
00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.890
Now that sounds like a black woman's name.
Her last name.

213
00:13:49.891 --> 00:13:54.750
She should have flipped around.
She says she should've been Doughlas owl.
No,

214
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.320
though is there,
I don't know how to say it.
Anyways,
racial,

215
00:13:58.321 --> 00:14:03.321
whatever 37 was pictured outside of her home Friday for the first time since the

216
00:14:03.661 --> 00:14:08.380
scandal
erupted over her misrepresentation of a race.

217
00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:11.470
This is what people are flipping out about.
Not that are fucking food is a,

218
00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:15.360
you know,
I dunno.
Whatever the fuck they do the ship,

219
00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.750
they don't tell us.
Um,

220
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:23.380
genetically altered baby seals washing up onto the fucking beach is fuck all of

221
00:14:23.381 --> 00:14:24.100
that.

222
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.760
There's some chick from some fucking God forsaken place pretending to be black

223
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:32.590
when she's actually white.
Let's focus on this.
Uh,
um,

224
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:35.900
she also responded to her detractors in a new interview saying,

225
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.580
what I'd like to say them is that don't give two shits about what you think.

226
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.410
I liked that.
There you go.
There you go.
You got girl.
Um,

227
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.220
she then added,
I do consider myself to be black.

228
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.530
Her parents revealed Thursday.
This is the only thing that I thought was,

229
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.060
was fucked up.
All right.

230
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:58.120
Are Parents revealed Thursday she started disguising yourself as black in 2007

231
00:14:59.541 --> 00:15:02.780
and no longer speaks to them because they will ruin her.

232
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:06.950
Image is chick is out of her fucking mind.
But in,

233
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.950
in the long and short of all of it.
Who was she hurting?

234
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.900
You know what I mean?
It's as far as a white person's goal.

235
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:20.130
Could you be any more involved in bettering race relations?

236
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.170
She killed off the white person.
It's side of her.
Right.

237
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.200
She's working at the Naacp.
We what,

238
00:15:27.201 --> 00:15:29.660
what more she got to do on some level.

239
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:34.900
I mean she could have just been some privileged fucking a white chick driving

240
00:15:36.111 --> 00:15:39.940
around in a fucking SUV and they are,
I was like sigh.

241
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.860
All right.
She could have been that.
Instead.

242
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.590
She does all of this shit about,

243
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:51.170
I don't understand like cutting off your fucking parents.

244
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.810
You know what I mean?

245
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:55.520
<v 2>Okay.</v>

246
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.080
<v 1>I wonder if she called him crack as you cracked.</v>

247
00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:58.910
He's got to stay away from my black ass,

248
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.370
my newly black ass.
Cause you're going to ruin my image.
Um,
she,

249
00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:09.020
she has been a civil rights activist in Idaho.
That's not an easy gig.

250
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.000
I remember a long time ago,

251
00:16:11.001 --> 00:16:15.530
a comic I know was working the funny bone up there and the Klan was fucking

252
00:16:15.531 --> 00:16:18.800
having a demonstration in Boise and he called up the club.

253
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:19.730
He was black by the way,

254
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.930
and asked for a ride over and they wouldn't give it to them.
And they were like,

255
00:16:23.931 --> 00:16:26.120
why do you need a ride?
It's a quick walk over.
He's like,

256
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:30.020
I'm cause I'm black in the clan is having a fucking rally.
You assholes.

257
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:35.660
And then the club was just like,
and I got,
why are you being sad?
Difficult?

258
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.970
Um,
so she was an activist and uh,

259
00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.450
Idaho,
uh,
she's,

260
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:49.220
she also teaches African studies that eastern Washington University and that's a

261
00:16:49.221 --> 00:16:53.720
little bit fucked up.
You know what I mean?
I think she can report on it.

262
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.090
I don't know if she can teach about it right now.
Maybe it gets,

263
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.450
if you read up enough on it,
you can teach the class.
I have no idea.

264
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.600
She is facing a city ethics investigation after identifying herself as black and

265
00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:09.791
an application to serve on a local police ombudsman commission.

266
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.970
What the fuck?
Ombudsmen.
I,
you know,

267
00:17:13.971 --> 00:17:16.400
I've been speaking the English language or at least attempting to

268
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:21.110

269
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:27.850

271
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:40.090
maladministration,
especially that of public authorities?
See,

272
00:17:40.091 --> 00:17:43.090

Now.
What the fuck is maladministration

273
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:46.960

274

275
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:56.590
My flow was not where it needs to be.
Sorry,
sorry.
The menstrual flow joke.

276
00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:01.120
What do you want from me?
Um,
anyways,
so she's,
uh,
I dunno.
Facing all this shit.

277
00:18:01.121 --> 00:18:01.571
Rachel,

278
00:18:01.571 --> 00:18:06.190

279

280
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.810

When you see her,

281
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:18.320
everyone's just going to be like,

284
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.330
They actually interviewed her son.
We asked,

uh,
what race are you?

285
00:18:32.331 --> 00:18:37.070
And she's like,
um,
I don't understand the question.
And the guy's like,

286
00:18:37.071 --> 00:18:41.270
what race are you?
Okay,
Rachel,
whatever.

287
00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.950
She also gave an interview about the controversies saying of our detractors.

288
00:18:45.951 --> 00:18:49.190
I said that already one press further about her race.
She told K,

289
00:18:49.191 --> 00:18:53.690
r e m I actually don't like the term African American.
I prefer black.

290
00:18:53.691 --> 00:18:58.190
Oh God.
And I would say that if I was asked,
I would definitely say that yes,

291
00:18:58.191 --> 00:19:01.940
I do consider myself to be black.
You know what?
I don't understand this.
You know,

292
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.410
if Bruce can consider him or herself to be Kaitlyn,

293
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.060
why can't fucking uh,

294
00:19:08.061 --> 00:19:12.380
Debbie here consider itself to be a,
uh,
Desiree?

295
00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.380
Whatever the fuck you want to call her.
I don't know.
Dacia um,

296
00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:22.760
oh my God.
Look at a parents.
Jesus Christ.
Then you're extremely white.

297
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:24.150
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

298
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.390
<v 1>they're so white.
Her Dad's name is Larry.
Although wait a minute,</v>

299
00:19:27.391 --> 00:19:30.580
Larry Johnson played for the Knicks,
but anytime I hear Larry,
Larry,
to me,

300
00:19:30.581 --> 00:19:35.430
he's a white guy.
Larry Bird,
Larry,
Jerry,

301
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:36.803
um,

302
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.330
Larry and Ruth Ann.
Oh my God.

303
00:19:42.331 --> 00:19:47.331
Pictured speaking to CNN on Friday had revealed their daughter Spokane's NAACP

304
00:19:48.901 --> 00:19:52.320
chapter president is white,
not African American.

305
00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:57.570
They actually have her fucking birth certificate.
Oh Man.

306
00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:02.870
Oh Jesus.
You know,
what is she,

307
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.740
what the way she's done her hair,
she kind of looks mixed.

308
00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.220
Although when she was,
uh,
when she was a little girl,

309
00:20:10.221 --> 00:20:11.850
she looks like she was on the Olson,

310
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:16.130
the Olson now the fucking little house on the prairie.
Hey,

311
00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:17.870
did anybody see that fucking article?

312
00:20:17.871 --> 00:20:21.440
I'm on Lionel Richie and Gq magazine.

313
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.490
Um,
you know,

314
00:20:25.491 --> 00:20:28.760
at a nine hour flight I fucking grabbed every magazine out there,
right?

315
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.600
Gq magazine,
such a stupid fucking magazine by the way.

316
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.100
They got some decent articles.

317
00:20:34.101 --> 00:20:38.120
But what was funny was some guy in there just ripped rolling stones to shreds

318
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.590
because they fucking,
you know,
had the,
uh,

319
00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.020
that rape story that ended up not being true and how they didn't investigate it

320
00:20:45.021 --> 00:20:49.140
saying all this fucking horseshit and saying that,
you know,

321
00:20:49.141 --> 00:20:52.230
I don't even understand why people took it so seriously because I,
oh my God,

322
00:20:52.231 --> 00:20:54.600
like rolling stone hasn't been relevant forever.
Right.

323
00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:59.100
And it's in literally in that Gq fucking magazine they got,

324
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.290
who's that tennis star from fucking Russia,

325
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.500
the fucking nine foot blonde who wasn't as good as Serena,

326
00:21:04.501 --> 00:21:09.420
but she makes more money cause she's blonde.
And blue eyed,
right.
She fucking,
uh,

327
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:14.070
they got a,
she's,
she,
she's going to drive some new Porsche,
right.
And the,

328
00:21:14.071 --> 00:21:17.610
all the quotes that they're using is that she's fucking totally into speed.

329
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:21.390
She likes driving like a maniac and she's a car person.
So I'm like,
wow,

330
00:21:21.391 --> 00:21:25.920
this girl's even hotter now.
How fucking hard is it that uh,
that uh,
uh,
uh,

331
00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:29.370
some beautiful woman likes to get behind the wheel of a Porsche and just fucking

332
00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:30.600
see how fast it can go.

333
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.350
And the quotes they using is leading you to believe that that's what the fuck's

334
00:21:34.351 --> 00:21:35.010
going on.

335
00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:38.070
And then you read the article and it's like a one page article and she's like,

336
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.780
it's like,
I like to go fast,

337
00:21:39.781 --> 00:21:43.380
but I have too much to lose by maybe in another life.

338
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.230
You know what I mean?
That's what it was.

339
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:50.340
And you're sitting there talking about journalistic integrity as you suck me

340
00:21:50.341 --> 00:21:54.240
into this fucking magazine because I want to read about the new Porsche and this

341
00:21:54.241 --> 00:21:57.870
statute was fucking blonde.
Likes to drive it and like 200 miles an hour.

342
00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.080
That's the way you sold it.
Yukon.
And it wasn't that

343
00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:02.550
<v 0>okay.</v>

344
00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:05.490
<v 1>I don't know.
I don't like that fucking magazine because the ivory,</v>

345
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.990
everything in there is like a fucking $30,000 watch and you're supposed to own

346
00:22:09.991 --> 00:22:13.590
like a plane.
Like that's supposed to be the thing that I'm going for.
It's like,

347
00:22:13.591 --> 00:22:17.940
what am I fucking James Bond?
Like who is this magazine for my a spy.

348
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.120
I hate when they have fucking pictures too.
Right.

349
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.450
And they have a celebrity and they're fucking in casual clothes and then

350
00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:28.570
there'll be like,
you know,
fucking uh,
you know Eddie,

351
00:22:28.571 --> 00:22:33.571
Rick Shaw here is where is wearing a fucking $900 tee shirt,

352
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:38.920

That's fucking stores.
I always think it's herpes.

353
00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:42.370
Fermi's Ar Mez,
right.

354
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.400
Kind of a fucking jerk off.

355
00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:46.990
<v 0>Uh Huh.</v>

356
00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:51.080
<v 1>Why would you do,
you know,
wears a pair of fucking $900 million,</v>

357
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.560
I dunno,
whatever.
So I'm off,
I'm totally off the beaten path.

358
00:22:57.561 --> 00:23:00.970
I there this chicky or wants to be black.
I mean,
she should fucking be a,

359
00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.940
her and her parents need to fucking work on their relationship.

360
00:23:04.941 --> 00:23:09.380
Maybe they can just treat her like she's African American.

361
00:23:09.381 --> 00:23:12.470
I have no idea.
Like God knows I live in Idaho.

362
00:23:12.471 --> 00:23:13.580
They probably wouldn't let her in the house.

363
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:18.710
They could use the back door and shit.
Larry all Matt.
Yeah.

364
00:23:18.711 --> 00:23:19.840
You want it to be black

365
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:26.500
who's out is you are not invited over for Christmas and come over and clean up

366
00:23:28.461 --> 00:23:29.294
if you want.

367
00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.770
That'd be fucking hilarious for parents who are actually fucking racist.

368
00:23:33.771 --> 00:23:34.371
And then they start,

369
00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:38.330
this is like a Chappelle show skit waiting to fucking happen.
Um,

370
00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.600
so anyways,
yeah,
they got it.

371
00:23:41.601 --> 00:23:43.310
They could definitely got to repair some stuff there.

372
00:23:43.311 --> 00:23:48.030
I don't know what's going on with his fucking lady.

375
00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:56.260
<v 0>yeah,</v>

376
00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.120
<v 1>and I'm wondering is if you see the car she's driving,</v>

377
00:23:58.121 --> 00:24:01.630
she's definitely a white chick though.
Jesus Christ.
What is that?

378
00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:05.770
What the fuck is that thing?
It's one of those things that isn't a van.

379
00:24:05.771 --> 00:24:09.460
It isn't an SUV and it isn't a car.
You know those things,

380
00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.290
whatever you call those things.

381
00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:17.230
Gmcs almost whatever the fuck it is,
I don't know.
All right,

God bless her.

Um,

383
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.700
all right.
What do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?

384
00:24:24.701 --> 00:24:26.440
You know what you do?
You read a little bit of advertising.

385
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:28.780
I think that that's the move to make here.

386
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:33.010
I definitely think that's the move my white freckled ass.

You don't feel like getting out of bed if your balls aren't being cradled.

428
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.090
How can you walk into your boss's office and say,
listen there fuzz face.

429
00:27:09.091 --> 00:27:12.240
I want to fucking race.
Who says so?

430
00:27:12.241 --> 00:27:14.740
Me and my snuggled ball say sell.

431
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.150
You grab out his letter opener and you stick it to his neck.

432
00:27:18.151 --> 00:27:20.340
You're not going to do that.
If your balls hanging in the breeze,

433
00:27:20.341 --> 00:27:21.420
you're going to feel vulnerable.

434
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.870
You need to know the feeling of the great fitting underwear that is two times

435
00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:29.630
softer than cotton Jesus Christ.
You need to know about me undies,
Dotcom,

436
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.510
me undies as the most comfortable underwear you will ever try on,

437
00:27:33.511 --> 00:27:37.290
and it's insane how good they make you fucking balls field.

438
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.840
They fit perfectly.
They don't ride up on you.

439
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:44.940
They literally pull moisture gross away from your skin.
She stay cool,

440
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.130
but they also make you look great.

441
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.850
It's going to be no reason to wear pants anymore.

442
00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:52.590
You're just going to walk down the street.
Hey ladies.
Hey ladies,

443
00:27:52.591 --> 00:27:57.300
look at these snug fit balls.
Oh yeah,

444
00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:58.980

447
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.730
but you have to try them on for yourself.
Nice and slowly too.

448
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.990
Sorry.
This quality would typically retail for two times to me.
UNDIES,

449
00:28:15.991 --> 00:28:20.250

453
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.170

464
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.540
why don't they say that about men while we're not gorgeous,

465
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:20.130
they make statues with the guy's junk hanging out.

But to get that 20% off,

480
00:30:17.201 --> 00:30:19.120

483
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.830
They recommend sending you.
This is fucking great by the way.

484
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.890
This is like you're a celebrity.
You got your own stylist.

485
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.880
Hey this is what I like.

486
00:30:42.881 --> 00:30:46.660

They ship a trunk full of fresh,
new,
close the door.

487
00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.570
Well I would hope so.
I don't want to want to be used.
Try them on.

488
00:30:49.571 --> 00:30:52.960
Keep what you want.
Send back what you don't in their prepaid box.

489
00:30:52.961 --> 00:30:55.780
That said a better wardrobe than you could ever pick out your self.

490
00:30:55.781 --> 00:30:59.170
Evidently in minutes that I mentioned the services free.

491
00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:03.130
How could they do that?
Well they just jack up the price of the clubs.

493
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.030

That's trunk club.com/burr.

500
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.190
He should definitely do that,
man.
I would think,

501
00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.850
cause I've learned in the last like six months that um,

502
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:48.070
when you actually dress nice as much as your guy friends break your balls,

503
00:31:48.071 --> 00:31:51.730
fucking women love it.
And I don't mean putting on a nice goddamn shirt.

504
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.070
All right.
I mean just,
you know,

505
00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:58.130
every once in awhile you break out a pocket square,
the,

506
00:31:58.131 --> 00:32:00.760
the level of shit you're going to in a sport coat,

507
00:32:00.761 --> 00:32:04.840
the level of shit you're going to take from your friends will easily be balanced

508
00:32:04.841 --> 00:32:07.870
out by the amount of fucking women that will just pack.
All right.
God,

509
00:32:07.871 --> 00:32:11.050
I like that look good.
Yeah.
Oh,

510
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:15.330
what's going on with you?
All right.

511
00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.530
Cause they slowly dropped to their knees.
I carbo.
Alright,
next thing you know,

512
00:32:19.531 --> 00:32:22.840
you're getting blown.
Least that's how the fantasy works in my head.

513
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:28.330
My head,
my head,
big fucking white freckled head.
Oh yeah.

514
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:33.460
All right.
Do you see that fucking lady yet?
Who yelled at Lebron?

515
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:40.350
He's walking off the court after having a fucking professional team on his back

516
00:32:40.561 --> 00:32:44.070
for 82 games in four rounds of the fucking playoffs.

517
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:48.540
You know,
going headfirst into a camera and even needing stitches,

518
00:32:48.541 --> 00:32:50.880
finishing the game like a fucking hockey player.

519
00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:56.100
You'd think that he'd get respect even though it is fans of the other team,

520
00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.360
even though it is in a way game or whatever the fuck it was,

521
00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.520
wasn't a way game.
I don't know.
I don't pay attention.

522
00:33:02.521 --> 00:33:06.510
So He's walking off the court and some lady yells at them.

523
00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:08.070
<v 3>Okay</v>

524
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:09.210
<v 1>something like 10 feet away.</v>

525
00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.570
<v 2>Well I did like to be a punk ass bitch</v>

526
00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:19.140
<v 1>and I love the security.
Just goes watch your mouth lady.
What's your mom?</v>

527
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.200
A woman watch your mouth.
Watch your mouth.

528
00:33:22.201 --> 00:33:27.201
Woman and Lebron just stopped and glared at her and I can't tell cause everybody

529
00:33:27.421 --> 00:33:30.990
did so many mishmash is of the video.
I believe she went,
sorry.

530
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:33.590
You know what is wrong with people?

531
00:33:33.591 --> 00:33:37.410
I that's one of my favorite moments in sports is when some asshole in the crowd

532
00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.160
yells something cause you know they're looking at him like they were a cartoon.

533
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.900
All right?
She wouldn't have said that shit to a regular size.
Lebron.

534
00:33:45.901 --> 00:33:48.720
Forget about what is Lebron?
Six seven six eight six nine.

535
00:33:48.721 --> 00:33:50.190
The guys literally a giant.

536
00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:55.020
You guys are doing this with my fucking voice this week.
Um,

537
00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.480
I just love when he just stopped the fucking glared at him,

538
00:33:58.500 --> 00:33:59.820
but you know what I mean?
What do you,

539
00:33:59.821 --> 00:34:04.320
what would you expect from a sports fan from California?

540
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:07.110
All right.
They,
they are the worst.

541
00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:12.570
I am a huge sports fan and it's depressing how bad sports fans are in the entire

542
00:34:13.681 --> 00:34:16.980
state of California.
The all they,

543
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:22.170
every fucking thing they say ends with the word bitch.
This is our house.
Bitch.

544
00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.940
What bitch?

545
00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:25.490
<v 3>Okay.</v>

546
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:29.810
<v 1>Fucking Dodgers bitch.
That just the fucking,</v>

547
00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:35.570
they're the fucking worst.
They don't know a fucking thing about the game.

548
00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.730
And I know there's going to be a bunch of people being like,

549
00:34:37.731 --> 00:34:42.560
I know about the game.
I'm just saying generally fucking speaking.
All right.

550
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:45.050
Like listen,
if you actually said,
hey bill,

551
00:34:45.051 --> 00:34:49.730
you're from Massachusetts and every time they pan into the crowd,
that is delta.

552
00:34:49.731 --> 00:34:53.520
Those are some of the ugliest collections of human beings I've ever seen him in

553
00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:57.860
my life.
I would not argue with you all right?
And I am part of that.

554
00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:00.860
If I was in the crowd too,
I would cause you to recoil.

555
00:35:00.861 --> 00:35:04.820
I always see it whenever they go.
Whenever they pan into the crowd at Boston,

556
00:35:04.821 --> 00:35:07.580
I'm always like,
Jesus Christ.
Look at those people.

557
00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.610
Look at him fucking animals.
Right?

558
00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:12.890
But I'll tell you something about those animals.

559
00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:17.600
They know the game and they could talk the game.
So can fans in New York.
Oh,

560
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:21.020
all these posts.
They can fucking talk the game.
People in the Midwest,

561
00:35:21.021 --> 00:35:22.430
great fucking fans.

562
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.410
Those maniacs down south again after it,
they can talk about the game.

563
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:31.550
I don't know what the fuck it is.
This state of California,

564
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:39.030
you know what's up?
NBA Finals,
bitch.
This is our house,

565
00:35:39.031 --> 00:35:43.740
bitch.
Hey Lebron,
your punk ass bitch.
I don't get it.

566
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:49.590
Everybody sounds like they're in one of those awful car movies,
right?

567
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.170
The fast and the furious and 24 seconds.
Get that car out of here.

568
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.570
All those fucking movies,
gumball,
rally,

569
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.010
all of them.
They all sound like they're,
they'll,

570
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.090
everybody sounds like they're on fucking MTV cribs.
I don't understand it.

571
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:12.150
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what caused it.
Was it reality television?

572
00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.270
You know what I mean?
Reality Television.

573
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:19.260
They had this formula where they would always have nine annoying white people

574
00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:20.123
and then,
uh,

575
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:24.540
somebody black and they would stick them in there and then eventually the black

576
00:36:24.541 --> 00:36:29.130
person lost their fucking mind because they live in with nine white people the

577
00:36:29.131 --> 00:36:32.880
same way as a white person after a fucking while.
You know what I mean?

578
00:36:32.881 --> 00:36:34.830
The black person is sitting there and you know,

579
00:36:34.831 --> 00:36:37.110
listening to James Taylor in the background,
I mean,

580
00:36:37.111 --> 00:36:40.470
how long do you expect somebody black to have to deal with that before they

581
00:36:40.471 --> 00:36:42.900
fucking flip out?
You know?

582
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:47.850
And I just think watching them screaming and yelling,
I noticed over the years,

583
00:36:47.851 --> 00:36:52.170
all of a sudden,
like the fucking white people on the show,
they,

584
00:36:52.171 --> 00:36:53.490
when they would flip out,

585
00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.220
they started yelling at the way the black person yelled.
It was,

586
00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:01.170
it's been a real weird thing.
Like when you,
regardless of your background,

587
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:05.410
you know what I mean?
You could be like,
you know,
the widest,
like,
Oh,

588
00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:09.690
I gotta I gotta I got called.
That's how I kind of already hang on.
It's like fat.

589
00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.590
Now all of a sudden if you are on a reality show and you got into a fight,

590
00:37:13.591 --> 00:37:17.520
you'd be like,
what's up bitch?
This is my house,
Bitch.

591
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.390
You fucking head would be rolling all around and shit.
I don't,

592
00:37:20.391 --> 00:37:23.580
I don't fucking get it.
But anyways,

593
00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:26.210
fortunately the only place in um,

594
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:30.000
sports fandom that that is seeped into is the California sports.

595
00:37:30.001 --> 00:37:34.710
Can't sports fan the fucking worst?
The worst.
I will say though,

596
00:37:34.711 --> 00:37:37.830
every once in a while when you meet a California sports fan that actually knows

597
00:37:37.831 --> 00:37:39.480
the game,
it's one of the great,

598
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:44.220
it's one of the great fucking moments that you can have in the state.
Like,

599
00:37:44.221 --> 00:37:47.580
I stopped going to sports bars.
I stopped.
Like if I go to a game,

600
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:51.330
I don't wear any sports paraphernalia.
I just don't,
I don't do,

601
00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:52.860
I mean look at them like what the fuck they did out here?

602
00:37:52.861 --> 00:37:57.270
They fuck God damn dodger fans.
You got a dad with his,
with his kids,

603
00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.030
beat him to the point where he's permanently brain damaged

604
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:05.430
fucking baseball bitch.
That's just,
I don't get it.

605
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.790
Don't fucking get it.
So it doesn't surprise me that she said that.

606
00:38:08.791 --> 00:38:12.780
I love that Lebron stopped and glared at her and she was able to be like,
oh,

607
00:38:12.781 --> 00:38:16.090
that's not a fucking hologram.
That's actually a real person.

608
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:20.300
Hologram the right word.
I was like halfway through that sentence,

609
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:25.320
don't say it built.
Don't saying I'm going to try a new word.
I hope it's right.

610
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.510
So anyways,
um,
the fucking,
uh,

611
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.880
Golden State Warriors,

612
00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:36.560
I actually watched the game and then watch that kid there with his chew toy is a

613
00:38:36.561 --> 00:38:39.770
little pacifier coming out of his mouth every two seconds.
I don't give a fuck.

614
00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.010
Then he does that and it drives me up the fucking wall.
That's,

615
00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:44.810
that is one of the greatest shoot as well.
Time.

616
00:38:44.811 --> 00:38:49.460
I was actually sitting at the bar with a buddy of mine and he was saying that

617
00:38:49.461 --> 00:38:53.810
guy,
he's the greatest shooter in NBA history.
And I was like,
Whoa,
whoa.
Hey,
oh,

618
00:38:53.811 --> 00:38:56.960
wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I know he's having a hell of a year.

619
00:38:56.961 --> 00:39:00.590
I know he's had a hell of a couple of years.
I said,
listen,
all right,

620
00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:05.300
Larry Bird made players from the opposed,
he was having a game,

621
00:39:05.301 --> 00:39:09.770
he was shooting so well,
players on the opposing team,

622
00:39:09.771 --> 00:39:12.710
when he hit like his 50th fucking three pointer of the game,

623
00:39:12.711 --> 00:39:15.140
it seemed they fell off the bench.

624
00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:16.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

625
00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:21.090
<v 1>The coach of the other team had to scold his players to stop cheering on this</v>

626
00:39:21.671 --> 00:39:24.880
guy who was killing them on the other team.
All right,

627
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:29.380
so out of respect for Larry Legend,
I don't respect for Kobe Bryant.

628
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.090
I haven't ever seen a guy,

629
00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:32.860
<v 0>okay.</v>

630
00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:36.880
<v 1>Have two or three guys hanging on him from beyond the arc and do a turnaround</v>

631
00:39:36.881 --> 00:39:40.120
jumper and it fucking goes in more than that guy.
However,

632
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:44.620
how I will say this,
if curry plays at this level,

633
00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:45.910
<v 0>okay.</v>

634
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:49.810
<v 1>For the next like for five years straight without a doubt is the greatest shoot</v>

635
00:39:49.811 --> 00:39:50.610
I've ever seen in my life.

636
00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:54.100
I had never seen a guy hit threes the way the guy gets threes.
Um,

637
00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:56.493
<v 0>okay.</v>

638
00:39:56.590 --> 00:40:01.480
<v 1>I mean I like Larry Bird,
Reggie Miller,
they've,
they've had those games,</v>

639
00:40:01.481 --> 00:40:05.320
but it just,
this guy is like unconscious every fucking game.

640
00:40:05.321 --> 00:40:09.730
I've never seen anything like it and watching Lebron carrying this team.
I mean,

641
00:40:09.731 --> 00:40:11.680
I'm not always,
you can tell us as you can tell,

642
00:40:11.681 --> 00:40:13.030
I don't really know this fucking sport,

643
00:40:13.031 --> 00:40:15.940
but like watching what that guy's doing with that team,
man,

644
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.320
putting that team on his back,
dude.
Like just how much second,

645
00:40:19.321 --> 00:40:20.710
remember that guy a few years ago,
he was like,

646
00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:23.710
I didn't want the ball at the end of the game and now he's just,

647
00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.070
he's just fucking beast.
And for that fucking lady to be at,

648
00:40:27.071 --> 00:40:28.490
what's it like to be a punk ass?
But what the,

649
00:40:28.491 --> 00:40:29.620
what the fuck are you talking about?

650
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:31.720
<v 0>Okay.</v>

651
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:32.420
<v 1>Oh,</v>

652
00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.330
I wish she turned around with to walk away and he took like is eight foot arm.

653
00:40:35.331 --> 00:40:38.930
It just reached in,
grabbed the back of her bra and what right.

654
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:41.450
He couldn't have done that,
what a,
her flying over eight rows.

655
00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.950
But if ever it would have been deserved,
I would think so.
And um,

656
00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:51.440
I have been watching the Stanley Cup final,
the Stanley Cup final,

657
00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:56.090
um,
the NBA finals,
Stanley Cup final.
Um,

658
00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:57.010
<v 0>okay.</v>

659
00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:57.281
<v 1>You know,</v>

660
00:40:57.281 --> 00:41:00.100
I actually think that somebody corrects me on that every fucking year and I'm

661
00:41:00.101 --> 00:41:03.240
always just like,
I'm just at that old age now.
I'm just like,
oh,

662
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:09.670
um,
I've been watching that one and uh,

663
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:14.440
I think the Black Hawks winning that game five just won the series going back to

664
00:41:14.441 --> 00:41:16.600
Chicago.
That's really not,
I'm not going out on a limb,

665
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:21.630
but there's that amazing thing when you see a truly great team that's gonna win

666
00:41:22.871 --> 00:41:27.340
a number of championships there ability to step up in the moments and their

667
00:41:27.341 --> 00:41:31.960
ability to know how to win a game that's lost.

668
00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:36.500
They stole that fucking game.
Five.
No,
no.
They didn't know what to tell them.

669
00:41:36.501 --> 00:41:39.690
They stole that game four was even when they still think they stole game four

670
00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:43.950
game file game five was one of the fucking tamp just kept fucking up on their

671
00:41:43.951 --> 00:41:47.130
own end.
They fucking,

672
00:41:47.131 --> 00:41:49.260
the goalie and the defenseman run into each other.

673
00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.090
They looked like peewee hockey and they had so many giveaways in their own

674
00:41:54.091 --> 00:41:58.910
fucking end.
I just,
I dunno,
I bet as a Tampa fan,

675
00:41:58.911 --> 00:42:00.570
your heart had to sink when that fucking happened.

676
00:42:00.571 --> 00:42:02.910
Considering every Goddamn game has been a one goal game.

677
00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.370
That the fact that you give up an easy one like that,

678
00:42:05.371 --> 00:42:09.270
you must be thinking that that's like being down like three goals in this
series.

679
00:42:09.271 --> 00:42:13.920
But anyways,
it's been an amazing thing.
And if,
uh,
if uh,

680
00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.890
Chicago wins three in the last six years,
man,

681
00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:21.690
I would say that they are the new Detroit Red Wings and I mean that is a highest

682
00:42:21.691 --> 00:42:25.800
compliment because the red wings had that run for like 10,

683
00:42:25.801 --> 00:42:29.220
11 years where every time you thought,
you know,
there's stars like,
okay,

684
00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:31.110
Eisenman's getting older,
right?
This is done.

685
00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:35.580
They just have that next fucking superstar step in.
And um,

686
00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.990
they just fucking knew how to win.
And uh,
I don't,
I,

687
00:42:38.991 --> 00:42:43.890
I'm a big fan of dynasties I like,
I like seeing like,
um,

688
00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:46.230
I don't like this team was the next year this team wins.
Next thing,

689
00:42:46.231 --> 00:42:50.640
this team where it's like you,
you need,
you need dynasties.
So you have like that,

690
00:42:50.641 --> 00:42:55.470
uh,
those timeless players,
you know what I mean?
Like as much as people,

691
00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:59.280
you know,
who will play against the Blackhawks all the fucking time.

692
00:42:59.281 --> 00:43:02.100
Say like Vancouver fans will probably hate the fucking black cocks,
right?

693
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:06.150
Or Minnesota fans,
St Louis Blues fans.
As much as you hate him,
you got it.

694
00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:11.070
You got to admit,
even now,
Jonathan tapes.
So he's the fucking man.

695
00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:14.160
He gaffed I'm gonna give a fuck.
I don't give a shit.

696
00:43:14.161 --> 00:43:16.420
If you bleed you fucking team's colors.
Did you just,

697
00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:17.990
<v 2>okay.</v>

698
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:19.560
<v 1>Yeah,
there's no way you went under.
So anyways,</v>

699
00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.180
I'm going to watch that game tonight and I actually think that,
um,

700
00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.030
Chicago closes them out.
However,

701
00:43:25.031 --> 00:43:28.510
I am going to be rooting for Tampa because I don't have a dog in this fucking

702
00:43:28.511 --> 00:43:32.410
fight and I don't want the hockey season to end.
I'd like it to go seven games.

703
00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.761
Um,
and by the way,

704
00:43:33.761 --> 00:43:37.930
I think this is the been the best NBA finals and Stanley Cup finals,

705
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:40.360
like in the same year,
in a long time.
And it's been fucking great.

706
00:43:40.361 --> 00:43:44.860
So I'm glad I'm back in the country here where I can actually watch the shape.

707
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:50.430
Um,
and speaking of which,
oh,
am I going to go to Vietnam?
I can go to these yet.

708
00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:52.680
Did anybody see Hillary Clinton's fucking speech,

709
00:43:52.681 --> 00:43:54.690
which she went up there dressed in Democrat.
Blue.

710
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.900
<v 2>Okay.</v>

711
00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:59.480
<v 1>Oh my God.
At the risk of burning a bit,</v>

712
00:43:59.481 --> 00:44:01.250
cause I'm definitely going to talk about this,

713
00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:07.180
to sit there and watch her talking about rich people when her and her husband go

714
00:44:09.741 --> 00:44:14.741
to that Bilderberg fucking meeting every year where the world's richest fucking

715
00:44:14.931 --> 00:44:19.370
people,
most powerful military people and most powerful political people all get

716
00:44:19.371 --> 00:44:23.030
together and decide how they're going to carve up the country,
the fucking world.

717
00:44:23.031 --> 00:44:23.864
This year,

718
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.610
she's at that fucking meeting and she's sitting there talking about the working

719
00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:29.980
man as cafe.

720
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.500
<v 4>If you guys can't work,</v>

721
00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.750
<v 1>oh,
whatever the fuck.
She said,
yeah,</v>

722
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:41.270
you guys some jabs and everybody's like,

723
00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:42.730
<v 4>Yay.</v>

724
00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:45.670
<v 1>Dumb little flag.</v>

725
00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:47.910
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

726
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:52.220
<v 1>I don't.
She's literally making fun of the Super Rich.</v>

727
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:54.860
It's like Hillary,
how are you going to get into office?

728
00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.070
You were a senator.
What does that pay?
A couple hundred grand a year.

729
00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:03.130
This fucking job costs a 100 million to get,

730
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:04.140
<v 3>okay.</v>

731
00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:08.460
<v 1>Costs 100 million to get to then make like 400 grand a year as president.</v>

732
00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:10.730
Right?

733
00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:15.730
How the fuck you going to get that job from what regular Joe's $25 contribution

734
00:45:17.751 --> 00:45:22.660
to your fucking campaign
or these fucking cunts.
The rich,

735
00:45:22.661 --> 00:45:26.220
the exact rich constant you're talking about is how you're going to be fucking

736
00:45:26.221 --> 00:45:27.360
president.
You're going to all,

737
00:45:27.361 --> 00:45:31.950
all of them favors and you're going to do exactly what the fuck they tell you.

738
00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:36.420
So you can get a second term and then in the end when you're fucking

739
00:45:36.421 --> 00:45:37.500
presidencies over,

740
00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:42.210
you're then going to go around the country and give speeches for $1 million a

741
00:45:42.211 --> 00:45:44.370
night.
Nobody's worth a million and night,

742
00:45:44.371 --> 00:45:47.550
but you're going to get paid $1 million a night and you're going to go right

743
00:45:47.551 --> 00:45:51.360
back speaking to the people who put you into fucking office and they're going to

744
00:45:51.361 --> 00:45:55.050
give you $1 million is they don't even fucking listen to you,
right?

745
00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:56.070
Because they don't give a fuck.

746
00:45:56.071 --> 00:45:59.800
All they're doing is washing their bribe money and food and I,
okay,

747
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:06.030
if you can't fucking see that and you're going to sit there and vote for a

748
00:46:06.031 --> 00:46:08.100
Democrat or Republican,
I can't,

749
00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:11.910
I can't even have a fucking conversation with you and you people who sit there

750
00:46:11.911 --> 00:46:12.280
and say,

751
00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.450
if you vote for the Libertarian fucking guy or whatever that you're throwing

752
00:46:15.451 --> 00:46:18.420
your vote away.
I it,
you're not,

753
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.140
you're not all you're going to get,
it doesn't make a difference.

754
00:46:22.141 --> 00:46:23.850
Who wins the Democrat or the Republican.

755
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:26.160
You're going to get the exact same shit fucking sandwich.

756
00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:28.980
It might be a little to the left,
a little to the fucking right,

757
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:32.460
but it's going to be the exact same shit sandwich because those rich cons to

758
00:46:32.461 --> 00:46:36.150
have money on both horses.
So no matter what they win.
Right.

759
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:41.820
So the fucking,
if you vote for somebody outside of that,

760
00:46:41.821 --> 00:46:43.830
all you're doing is encouraging more people.

761
00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:44.980
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

762
00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:49.980
<v 1>That there's hope that you can maybe somehow undo this fucking situation.</v>

763
00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:55.060
I Dunno.
I actually think that it's,
it's fucking over.
I don't think that it's,

764
00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.740
it's possible.
You know,
it's so fucking depressing though,

765
00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:02.590
to watch people once again,
once again,

766
00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:06.580
I'm going to sit there and listen to a candidate who's a Democrat or Republican,

767
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.170
make these stupid ass fucking promises and they lose their fucking minds

768
00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:16.570
thinking that it's actually going to change their lives for the better.
You know,

769
00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:19.780
I,
I don't,
I don't know.
Sorry.
I know that's fucking super depressing.

770
00:47:19.781 --> 00:47:22.750
That's just what I think.
So anyways,
let's get into the,
uh,

771
00:47:22.751 --> 00:47:27.010
the questions here for the week.
All right.
And if you listen to these questions,

772
00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:31.520
I'm going to get Joe [inaudible].
Yeah.
Um,

773
00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:35.110
all right,
French listeners.

774
00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:39.100

775
00:47:39.101 --> 00:47:43.540
job.

776
00:47:43.541 --> 00:47:44.140
you're right.

777
00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:49.140
We're mostly assholes to people whether they come for France or abroad and I

778
00:47:49.781 --> 00:47:52.560
don't think you guys are assholes.
You guys treated me Nice.
Uh,

779
00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:56.590
currently with a couple of friends.
I currently am with a couple of friends,

780
00:47:56.591 --> 00:48:00.400
having a good time listening to your ranch last jokes and since had been

781
00:48:00.401 --> 00:48:02.860

I said to myself,

782
00:48:02.861 --> 00:48:06.730
let the guy know you enjoy his jokes.
Well,
I appreciate that.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:01.640

How do you say 800 in French and French

798
00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:07.230
wheat

799
00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:09.521

You have to,

806
00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:33.880
uh,

807
00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:38.350
like you know that fucking dragon and as you're trying to come up with your

808
00:49:38.351 --> 00:49:41.080
thoughts,
right?
Put your thoughts together over there.
They go like,
yeah,

809
00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:44.350
who's your buddy?
It was all blue.
Blue,

810
00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:45.670
<v 5>Do,

811
00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.180
<v 1>It's fucking telling you you smoke a joint.
You listen to that shit.</v>

812
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:54.830
You're going to fucking laugh your ass off.
Um,
so anyways,
the audience,
yes.

813
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:56.110
Daddy,
that op is,

814
00:49:56.111 --> 00:50:00.050
it's located at DOL rule cornea in the CSERIES,

815
00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:05.110
these mall of Patty on the Left Bank of this sen next to Luxembourg garden.

816
00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:08.930
Um,
ah yeah,
I know where that is.
I just love that.
I know where that is.

817
00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:14.140
It was originally built between 1779 and 1782 right back before particle board

818
00:50:15.731 --> 00:50:16.610
nailed guns.

819
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:21.110
Took you a little while to build something in the garden at the former hotel,

820
00:50:21.111 --> 00:50:24.680
dig Dante to a neoclassical blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

821
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:28.030
The theater was inaugurated.
Wait a second,
this is what I love here.

822
00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.680
It was reopened in eight.
It burned in 18,
18.

823
00:50:32.681 --> 00:50:36.940
Everything fucking burned down back then.
It was all made out of wood.

824
00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:41.620
You didn't have any fire hydrants and some jerk off comes in and drops his

825
00:50:41.621 --> 00:50:43.360
cigarette down.
Separate booth,
right?

826
00:50:43.361 --> 00:50:47.500
Throws the fucking thing down and all of a sudden everybody's just like ruin

827
00:50:47.501 --> 00:50:51.670
feel lives.
Right?
And the whole thing fucking burns down.

828
00:50:51.671 --> 00:50:55.030
They got the Bucket Brigade trying to pee on the fire.

829
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:58.720
Then they just like God dammit.
Right,
let's rebuild it.

830
00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:00.040
Then they start all over again.

831
00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.170
This is why they weren't in great shape back then.

832
00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:07.030
The building and rebuilding of shit that burned down and they're fucking food

833
00:51:07.031 --> 00:51:11.200
wasn't g uh,
genetically altered.
That right there.

834
00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:16.120
That is a recipe for a six pack.
So anyways,
that is my goal.

835
00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:20.850
I want to do a show there.
Neo has already given me shit,
you know,

836
00:51:20.851 --> 00:51:24.840
cause I'm a fucking workaholic and she's giving me shit going like can that just

837
00:51:24.841 --> 00:51:28.860
be like the one city where you know,
we just hang out.

838
00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:34.290
You know,
we have some us time,
which she's so fucking right,

839
00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:39.780
but I'm a guy so I'm going to fuck that up.

840
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:44.880
I thought I finally got it.
I think I finally get being in a relationship and

841
00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:50.280
how to keep a woman happy,
believe it or not.
Um,

842
00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:53.340
I think I finally get it.

843
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:57.600
I don't know how to explain it to you cause it's like embarrassing because it

844
00:51:57.601 --> 00:52:01.530
involves feelings and listening and being respectful

845
00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:10.730
and all your women right now who went like you see,
that's a two way street.

846
00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:15.380
All right?
It's a fucking two way street.
So anyways,

847
00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:20.780
um,
I don't give a fuck.
I'm still going to play over there.
Come on man.

848
00:52:20.781 --> 00:52:24.170
To have a show in Paris,
if ACDC,
complainant,
Paris,
you know what I mean?

849
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.160
They can't,
you know,

850
00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:29.030
there's no fucking way I can sit there and not want to play that place.

851
00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:32.150
I love ACDC.
You know,

852
00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.370
bon Scott,
one of his last fucking shows he plays in Paris.

853
00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:41.300
I gotta I gotta fucking,
I don't give a shit of Carol.
Ron People fucking show up.

854
00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:45.140
Right.
And I'll give a fuck.
I'm going to do it.
I'll be like,
look,

855
00:52:45.141 --> 00:52:49.910
it's one fucking show.
It's one show she'll give and she's a sweetheart.
Um,

856
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:51.930
so anyways,
that's nice.

857
00:52:51.931 --> 00:52:55.320
I guess I actually got some letters here from people and from France and they're

858
00:52:55.321 --> 00:52:57.990
actually helping me with my French.
All right.

859
00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:02.280
The French correction from a lady.
That's fucking great.

860
00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:06.210
Hey Billy boy,
I'm,
I'm listening to your last Thursday afternoon,

861
00:53:06.211 --> 00:53:09.300
Monday morning podcast.
And I have to correct you about your French insults.
Oh,

862
00:53:09.301 --> 00:53:12.570
by all means.
I don't want to be like Roman Moroni.

863
00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:17.460
You fogging best judges.
That's a fucking twit question.
The next one,

864
00:53:17.461 --> 00:53:20.160
are you fog a nice toasted something.
Remember that?

865
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:23.880
It's going to have his fucking bells as far good bells in a sling.

866
00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:28.320
You corked sucker.
Jesus the math and that guy.
Um,

867
00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:30.840
Roman Moroni is one of my favorite characters of all time.

868
00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:34.770
It's in a Johnny dangerously.
He's an immigrant and he,
uh,

869
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:38.730
he has a potty mouth,
but he mispronounces all the curses,
so I don't want to,

870
00:53:38.731 --> 00:53:43.680
I don't want to be the Roman Moroni of,
uh,
of uh,
France.
So anyways,

871
00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:46.920
she says,
I'm listening to your last Thursday afternoon,

872
00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:49.360
Monday morning podcast just before Friday.

873
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:52.560
You and I have to correct you a bunch of French insults.

874
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.840
If you want to say fuck your mother.

875
00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:59.400
We usually say Veronica Tom Mayer.

876
00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:04.050
I'm really nervous about n I Q.
U e r like that could be like,

877
00:54:04.051 --> 00:54:07.800
I could accidentally say the n word there or say something homophobic because

878
00:54:07.801 --> 00:54:10.440
the end kind of looks like queer.
Nick were

879
00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:15.900
funny.
Quit man.
You gotta help me out.

880
00:54:15.901 --> 00:54:19.890
Can you sound spell that so I don't fuck it up.
Say That instead of bus.

881
00:54:19.891 --> 00:54:23.730
There is preferred here,
um,
about,

882
00:54:23.731 --> 00:54:28.020
this is bullshit about something.
A better translation will be,

883
00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:32.370
uh,
say say della married.
This is shit.

884
00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:36.930
I like that better than this is bullshit.
This is shit.
You getting right to it.

885
00:54:36.931 --> 00:54:40.860
Say Dad,
I mad.
Hey Jack.

886
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.260
Say Dale and Matt.
Um,
say data math.

887
00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:50.460
Um,
rather than saying,
say Song Day con Connery Connery can be,

888
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.410
can be employed.
When you want to say to someone,

889
00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:58.960
what you say is bullshit and the translation is to rent,

890
00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:03.210
to recontact aid.
They con Ra.
I know,
I stink.

891
00:55:03.211 --> 00:55:07.200
I got to get the Rosetta stone here.
Uh,
and,
and the last one,

892
00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:11.960
uh,
employed.
Very employed in France.
We'll see.
Look at that.

893
00:55:11.961 --> 00:55:13.740
Trying to get their fucking up the English here.

894
00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:19.050
I guess this means used a lot in France.
Um,
it's best aid.

895
00:55:19.051 --> 00:55:22.320
The Canard Open saying that first word right,
which I'm probably not.

896
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.770
When the person in front of you was the biggest asshole that you've ever met in

897
00:55:25.771 --> 00:55:29.970
your life,
what does it mean canard?

898
00:55:29.971 --> 00:55:34.950
Is that pig you fucking pig.
That means you're an asshole.
Oh,
there's two n's.

899
00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:38.220
I Dunno.
Well thank you Sabrina.
Hey,
by the way,
you guys,

900
00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:41.460
anybody French listening to this?
If you can help me out with anything.

901
00:55:41.461 --> 00:55:44.730
Just like a new one alone.
Bruce share.

902
00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:48.570
We're going to brunch.
I learned that yesterday,
right?

903
00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:51.570
We were going to go to brunch cause I had like,
you know,

904
00:55:51.571 --> 00:55:54.780
I'm trying to fucking be a better husband here so I'm just like,
all right,

905
00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:59.580
this is your ESPN sports zone.
Let's go to fucking brunch.
And I'm,

906
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:04.560
oh my God,
what a shit show Brunches,
the dumbest fucking thing ever.

907
00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:08.100
Let's go to breakfast when everybody else is going to breakfast so we can all

908
00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:12.990
you just,
you just see these fucking people as you drive it over there,

909
00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:14.280
all these breakfast places,

910
00:56:14.281 --> 00:56:17.310
but you're not going to them and you just see all of these people just standing

911
00:56:17.311 --> 00:56:21.060
outside,
sitting on benches,
staring at their fucking iPhones.

912
00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:25.420
You know what I mean?
And breakfast is the easiest fucking meal to make.

913
00:56:25.421 --> 00:56:29.160
You can't scramble up some eggs yourself while your wife makes some pancakes.

914
00:56:29.161 --> 00:56:33.190
You can go make yourself a grand slam breakfast.
You guys could sit around,
right?

915
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:36.580
So he's got the orange juice,
she got some music playing and guess what?

916
00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:41.080
There's a table.
The kitchen table.
No waiting,
right?

917
00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:42.430
But at some they want to do,

918
00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:45.490
I want to fucking go out and everybody look at their outfits.

919
00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:50.620
Everybody look at the fucking outfits.
Um,
so anyways.

920
00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:54.820
All right,
so we've got one from Manchester,
England here,
Manchester,
England,
Bill.

921
00:56:54.821 --> 00:56:57.190
I'm a big fan from across the pond as you Yankees.

922
00:56:57.250 --> 00:57:01.940
You'd like to say a not Yankees.
Yankee.
Oh,
calls Yankees.
Alright,

923
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:04.600
I'm red sox.
You understand me?
I was wondering if you,

924
00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:08.740
I was wondering if you ever consider film and especially say he's preferably in

925
00:57:08.741 --> 00:57:09.790
England.
Thanks for the laugh.

926
00:57:09.791 --> 00:57:14.250
She can't even fucking hear me miserable

927
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:19.530
or that thing used to go Dell make me laugh.

928
00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:22.640
Every count I don't face.
Um,

929
00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:27.880
what I ever considered doing a special overseas.
Um,

930
00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.180
yeah,
I was actually considering doing one in France,

931
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:36.100
just doing it in French and just put in the fucking thing out and then I could

932
00:57:36.101 --> 00:57:39.220
actually do the same one in English somewhere else.

933
00:57:39.221 --> 00:57:41.050
I'd have two different fucking specials.

934
00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:45.880
I wouldn't give a fuck if a bunch of them English speaking countries saw the

935
00:57:45.881 --> 00:57:46.510
French one.

936
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:50.050
They not even going to know what I'm talking about because they don't speak

937
00:57:50.051 --> 00:57:53.860
French for the most part.
And that's the way we get a little two for one there.

938
00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:57.290
You know what I mean?
Right there.
Like right there.
I,

939
00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:01.510
the way I'm thinking comedically is I am thinking the way home depot thinks.

940
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:04.000
Like how can we take those two employees,

941
00:58:04.001 --> 00:58:08.170
make them one and get the same job done and we make more fucking money.

942
00:58:08.171 --> 00:58:11.940
That's what I'm doing.
You know,
I'm being a bit of a being a blimp,

943
00:58:11.941 --> 00:58:16.150
being a little cheeky.
Um,
when I consider doing one over there,
um,

944
00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.273
I dunno,

945
00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:23.380
I don't know if I get you guys enough that,
uh,

946
00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:27.100
that I would do that.
I would,
I would tell you this though.

947
00:58:27.101 --> 00:58:30.100
I really enjoy doing one last,

948
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.680
last time down south.

949
00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:36.760
I think what everybody seems to like to do is to get in front of their own

950
00:58:36.761 --> 00:58:39.970
people because you don't want to get heckled or anything,

951
00:58:39.971 --> 00:58:44.971
but I think there's some fun that is lost when,

952
00:58:46.811 --> 00:58:50.830
uh,
you stand up in front of a room,
that's all you,
you know what I mean?

953
00:58:50.831 --> 00:58:54.100
I think you want a little back and forth.
Personally,
I've always enjoyed,

954
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:57.150
you know,
people yelling out to me.
I don't,
I'm more,

955
00:58:57.310 --> 00:58:59.170
I don't give a shit if somebody yells out to me.

956
00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:02.650
I mean if you just being an asshole and just trying to disrupt the fucking show,

957
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:03.730
obviously that's annoying.

958
00:59:03.731 --> 00:59:08.731
But I say a lot of stupid shit on stage so it doesn't surprise me.

959
00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:15.870
You know when I'm talking about the wage gap that some woman yells at me when

960
00:59:15.871 --> 00:59:18.160
I'm in the crowd.
And then to be honest with you,

961
00:59:18.161 --> 00:59:21.830
I really want to hear what she has to say cause I'm trying to learn something

962
00:59:21.831 --> 00:59:23.960
about it because I don't have to deal with that shit.

963
00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:28.760
And the only way that I can hear that is through my own fucking manners.

964
00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:33.230
So it's good to hear her fucking perspective.
So I don't consider that a heckle.

965
00:59:33.231 --> 00:59:36.920
I consider it a conversation.
So getting back to that to go to England,

966
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:41.950
I would probably say some shit deliberately to get you guys going because what's

967
00:59:42.141 --> 00:59:44.840
the fun?
What the fuck is the purpose of me going over to England?

968
00:59:44.841 --> 00:59:47.840
If I'm not going to give you guys a little bit of Shit and then you give me a

969
00:59:47.841 --> 00:59:50.000
little shit back and then we all fucking laugh.
Right.

970
00:59:50.001 --> 00:59:54.590
So maybe that could be a good idea,
sir.
That might be a good idea.
I Dunno.

971
00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:59.540
I would,
I would definitely consider it.
I would consider it,
you know,

972
00:59:59.541 --> 01:00:01.970
I'd run that up.
The flag pole.
All right.

973
01:00:01.971 --> 01:00:06.560
Let me do the last little bits of a advertising here and uh,

974
01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:09.110
and then I'll answer your last questions you guys can get on with your life.

975
01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:09.411
All right.

976
01:00:09.411 --> 01:00:13.940
stamps.com everyone making trips to the post office is becoming a thing of the

977
01:00:13.941 --> 01:00:16.910
past.
You just don't need to do it anymore.

978
01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:21.290
Thanks to stamps.com you're already know that going to the post office is

979
01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:22.610
inconvenient.
Yeah,
but you know,

980
01:00:22.611 --> 01:00:26.360
if you're into collecting stamps or if you want some cool stamps,

981
01:00:26.361 --> 01:00:29.240
you know what I mean?
If either one of those nerds,
you know,

982
01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:30.950
if you're into that and like birdwatching,

983
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:33.410
you probably still go to the post office,
but for the rest of you,

984
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:37.010
you already know that going to the post office is,
is that,
that's a nightmare.

985
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:38.120
Totally inconvenient.

986
01:00:38.121 --> 01:00:42.560
Driving their right standing behind the person who is trying to send a muffler

987
01:00:42.561 --> 01:00:46.040
out in a fucking envelope,
right?
You don't want to be there finding parking,

988

I have some leftover posters also from um,

1009
01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.140
my run of 19 shows at the,
uh,

1010
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:05.360

1015
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:20.390
If you wondering where your poster is,
it's the way.
All right,
legal zoom,

1016

There's a lot of great reasons that Smart People Trust,

1019
01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:30.980

from a first stop when you need advice from an attorney,

1025
01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:49.580
legal zoom is not a law firm,

1026
01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:53.300
so they built a network of independent attorneys in most states to provide legal

1027

01:02:59.781 --> 01:03:04.220
incorporate or form an LLC,

They just kicked me a little,

1042
01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:51.470
a little something,
something for fucking driving traffic to their site.

All right,

1045
01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:02.880
let's get on with the last questions here.
Dilemma.
Billy Bird.

1046
01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:08.060
Would you rather play 15 seasons in the professional sport and wind zero rings

1047
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:09.320
or when one year,

1048
01:04:09.321 --> 01:04:14.321
rookie year and suffer a career ending injury the next oh,

1049
01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:18.030
Jesus.
Uh,
no.
I'll take the 15 seasons,

1050
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:21.840
I'll take the money and put the rest on a gift certificate.
Now I would rather,

1051
01:04:21.841 --> 01:04:24.690
uh,
as much as you want to win a championship,

1052
01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:29.880
there's also playing for the love of the game,
you know?
And there's also a,

1053
01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:32.860
I think,
I think,

1054
01:04:33.850 --> 01:04:38.850
I think most athletes would choose playing 15 seasons because you want to play,

1055
01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:43.480
you know,
y'all self,
you're going to fuck up your body.

1056
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:45.940
I don't want just one fucking,
you know,

1057
01:04:45.941 --> 01:04:49.570
what kind of contract did I get my rookie year?
I mean,

1058
01:04:49.571 --> 01:04:53.170
if I had a shit contract and I was on that team and I got my ring and then I

1059
01:04:53.171 --> 01:04:56.860
blow out my knee the next year I'm working at the fucking,
I'm doing landscaping,

1060
01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:00.380
then people,
hey you,
you,
you,

1061
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:04.560
you played in the Superbowl and they'll look at your trimming hedges.
You know,

1062
01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:06.670
that would be a motherfucker,
you know,

1063
01:05:06.671 --> 01:05:10.420
I would take a while to get over that emotionally.

1064
01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:14.660
Um,
you know,
like,
I bet he,
you know,

1065
01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:18.230
what's his face there for the Broncos?
I at the game too,

1066
01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:22.460
when he suffered his career ending injury.
Um,
Tarell Davis,

1067
01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:24.950
I was at Dec ever tell you guys that I was at that game.

1068
01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:27.630
I was doing some college gigs out in,
um,

1069
01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:31.040
Colorado and uh,

1070
01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:34.580
as always I always try to build the road around something,
you know,

1071
01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:37.940
beyond just doing stand up.
So you know,
you get,

1072
01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:40.490
get a feel for that part of the country.

1073
01:05:40.491 --> 01:05:42.710
And one of the big things for me was always going to sporting events.

1074
01:05:42.711 --> 01:05:44.810
So this was,
they was still in Mile High Stadium.

1075
01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:50.180
They had just won back to back titles.
John Elway retired.
Right.

1076
01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:53.030
I always wanted,
he played one more year if they could have got three,

1077
01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:56.330
but you know,
to got hurt but would've Sharelle got heard of John was playing,

1078
01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:59.320
what did they have passed on that play?
Who knows?
Anyways,

1079
01:05:59.321 --> 01:06:02.750
so they were playing the jets.
Jts,
Jess,
Jess,
Jess and uh,

1080
01:06:02.751 --> 01:06:07.610
that's when bill Parcells was there and he was building a monster and they were

1081
01:06:07.611 --> 01:06:09.800
going to win their first Superbowl.
They were favorites.

1082
01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:13.760
One of the favorites to go to the Superbowl at the beginning of the year.
So I,

1083
01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:14.960
uh,
you know,

1084
01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:19.250
when I saw that they were going to be playing the Denver Broncos in Mile High

1085
01:06:19.251 --> 01:06:22.700
Stadium,
like the fifth week of the season or something like that.

1086
01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:26.240
And Lo and behold,
John Elway's not playing.

1087
01:06:26.241 --> 01:06:29.210
It was supposed to be at this great fucking match up the Broncos.

1088
01:06:29.211 --> 01:06:32.840
We'll all win for the jets that year.
Uh,

1089
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:36.950
Vinny Testaverde blew out his Achilles tendon the first game of the year.

1090
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:39.800
And that's when Keyshawn cried,
right?

1091
01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:45.020
<v 4>No.
Are you give me the,
um,</v>

1092
01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.500
no,
that's my quarterback was that other guy that had a lunatic.

1093
01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:52.920
That's my waterbed.
You don't talk about it.
And that's by quarterback.
Um,

1094
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:58.060
<v 1>so the jets were owned four,
so it was too fucking,
oh.
And fourteens.</v>

1095
01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.490
And I showed up and there was like nobody there.

1096
01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.650
The scalpers had a mountain of fucking tech.

1097
01:07:02.651 --> 01:07:07.180
I bought a ticket for fucking face value.
It could have probably got it for less,

1098
01:07:07.181 --> 01:07:10.270
but you know,
I'm not one of those people.
It's like I do,
you'll break even.

1099
01:07:10.271 --> 01:07:13.180
He ain't go give you a fucking money.
And I went to the game and um,

1100
01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:16.060
and that was the game that Soil Davis,
uh,

1101
01:07:16.090 --> 01:07:18.760
unfortunately one of the would have been,

1102
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.470
I still think he is one of the great fucking running backs of all time and a,

1103
01:07:23.471 --> 01:07:23.771
I mean,

1104
01:07:23.771 --> 01:07:27.010
I'm a can't imagine what that guy had to go through emotionally after winning

1105
01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:30.850
two rings.
And just wondering what might have been,

1106
01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:35.560
I think despite winning the championships and knowing what that feels like,

1107
01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:37.540
I think the,

1108
01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:42.340
the equal to that high would be the low of what could have been.

1109
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:46.090
And you know,
and when he's watching all of those,
uh,

1110
01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.980
greatest running backs of all time,

1111
01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:51.370
he's left off that list a lot because he doesn't have,

1112
01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:54.640
because what people do when those arguments is they immediately go to the

1113
01:07:54.641 --> 01:07:59.230
ALMANAC and they go,
all right.
Emmitt Smith has 17,000 fucking yards.

1114
01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:04.480
You know,
they look at Dickerson,
Walter Payton fucking Jim Brown,

1115
01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:05.770
Oj Simpson,

1116
01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:10.030
they go through all of those guys and they look and because their career numbers

1117
01:08:10.031 --> 01:08:14.080
are up there,
and then guys who got hurt,
um,
Barry Sanders,

1118
01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:19.990
Barry Sanders,
who would I think is the greatest running back of all time,

1119
01:08:19.991 --> 01:08:23.050
the greatest one that I ever saw.
Um,

1120
01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:28.490
I would say the most complete I ever saw was Walter Payton.

1121
01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:35.030
I'd say the most devastating just of speed and power.

1122
01:08:37.230 --> 01:08:38.000
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1123
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.810
<v 1>That was a precursor to Bo Jackson was Earl Campbell.</v>

1124
01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:45.850
Bo Jackson was like a faster,

1125
01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:51.460
but I would say not as strong as Earl Campbell.
That's how big Earl Campbell was,

1126
01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:53.320
by the way.
Um,

1127
01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:59.530
Bo Jackson and Barry Sanders.

1128
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:05.360
I would say those four were the best that I ever saw.
And,

1129
01:09:05.361 --> 01:09:09.140
but then as far as just effortless,
the greatest,

1130
01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:12.050
most beautiful runner I ever saw was Eric Dickerson.

1131
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:15.020
Eric Dickerson didn't even look like he had to try.

1132
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:19.070
He just looked like he was just,
he looked like he was jogging and it ain't,
it,

1133
01:09:19.090 --> 01:09:21.920
you couldn't even,
you couldn't understand why people couldn't catch up to him.

1134
01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:26.930
A man that,
that just makes me fucking,
I that,
that,
that was football back then.

1135
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:30.440
I fucking,
I dude,
I,
that's the greatest thing I have.
Do you realize I grew up,

1136
01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:31.971
you know,

1137
01:09:31.971 --> 01:09:36.350
started watching sports in the late seventies and I got to see all of the late

1138
01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:39.530
seventies and the aids,
like the golden age of football was in the 70s.

1139
01:09:39.531 --> 01:09:43.550
I got to see the end of that.
And then the result of it,
the west coast offense,

1140
01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:48.200
air corps yell,
all of that,
Dan Marino and all those guys come of age in the 80s,

1141
01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.820
all those great running backs.

1142
01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:55.070
And meanwhile in hockey you had fucking Wayne Gretzky,

1143
01:09:55.071 --> 01:09:59.540
Mario Lemieux,
those great Edmonton teams.
Uh,
um,

1144
01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:04.280
the mystique of the Canadians was,
was still there.
Um,

1145
01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:09.500
I don't mind insulting Canadian fans like it just the big bad fucking Bruins.

1146
01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:12.500
They would just was fucking amazing.

1147
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:16.580
Perfect amount of the greatest gold scores of all time.

1148
01:10:16.581 --> 01:10:21.470
Fucking Paul Coffee scored like 49 50 goals is a fucking defenseman was

1149
01:10:21.471 --> 01:10:24.110
unbelievable.
And then there was always a fight,

1150
01:10:24.111 --> 01:10:27.140
like every like period period and a half.
It was fucking perfect.

1151
01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:29.360
And then a basketball.

1152
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:34.570
You had Larry Bird Magic Johnson that then went into fucking Michael Jordan.

1153
01:10:37.190 --> 01:10:38.870
This is just the fucking eighties.

1154
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:44.420
And baseball was the one that actually kind of dropped off during that time.

1155
01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:48.110
But even though they dropped off,
you still had the wizard of Oz,
the Smith,

1156
01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.750
you still like Kirk Gibson's home run.

1157
01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:55.640
You still had the bash brothers in the Oakland A's,
right.

1158
01:10:56.490 --> 01:10:59.180
Yankees dropped off or whatever,
but it was still great.

1159
01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:04.220
Still still fucking great.
That's like the 80s might be the greatest decade ever,

1160
01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:07.160
if you will,
just to fucking sports fan and American sports to watch.

1161
01:11:07.161 --> 01:11:10.310
I'm arguing that right now.
I'm saying it might've been the greatest one.

1162
01:11:10.311 --> 01:11:13.190
It might've been.
Um,
all right.
Walmart.

1163
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.570
A Billy birthday boy.
How,
why?
Yeah.
Happy Belated Birthday.

1164
01:11:18.571 --> 01:11:19.291
Thank you very much.

1165
01:11:19.291 --> 01:11:23.280
Just wanting to share with you what I believe to be the finest display of white

1166
01:11:23.281 --> 01:11:25.380
trash entertainment found on the Internet.

1167
01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:29.430
This video has gone viral and where I,
uh,

1168
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:34.320
where I live and it's not every day you see two obese fat fucks duking it out in

1169
01:11:34.321 --> 01:11:38.070
a Walmart.
Um,
it's two women.
I've actually seen this,
uh,

1170
01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:43.230
this video and um,
let's see,
what does it say?
I'm sorry.

1171
01:11:43.231 --> 01:11:45.270
I was just making sure that it wasn't in mono again.

1172
01:11:46.150 --> 01:11:48.300
Headphones felt weird here for a second.
Uh,

1173
01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:51.750
this video has gone viral or around where I live.
Um,

1174
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:55.410
the lady does bring her kid in off the sideline at one point,

1175
01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:58.080
so I guess we can call it a family outing anyways.

1176
01:11:58.081 --> 01:12:01.770
Just thought you'd have a chuckle and you and your podcast last Thursday,

1177
01:12:01.771 --> 01:12:03.300
June 11th was one of the greatest ones.

1178
01:12:03.301 --> 01:12:05.760
Thank you Jaime and stitches make you all right.
Thank you.
Um,
yeah,

1179
01:12:05.761 --> 01:12:09.090
I did see this and I actually loved,

1180
01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:11.990
I don't know what this says about me.

1181
01:12:11.991 --> 01:12:16.460
I loved that that little kid took out the shampoo bottle,

1182
01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:20.520
you know,
and was helping out his mom,
you know,

1183
01:12:20.521 --> 01:12:22.620
what is the kid supposed to fucking do?

1184
01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.350
Like that is exactly your mom's losing the fight.

1185
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:29.910
You got to jump in there and save your mom.
I mean,

1186
01:12:29.911 --> 01:12:32.190
even if you don't love your mom,
that's your ride home.

1187
01:12:32.191 --> 01:12:33.900
You fucking seven years old.

1188
01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:39.870
So he goes to take the fuck.
He grabs a shampoo bottle due to,

1189
01:12:39.871 --> 01:12:41.610
it's like wrestling back in the day.

1190
01:12:41.611 --> 01:12:46.410
Captain Lou Albano comes in with a foreign object now in the ref,

1191
01:12:46.411 --> 01:12:47.244
didn't see it.

1192
01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:52.290
I guess people got upset because some were telling the kid not to do it.

1193
01:12:53.010 --> 01:12:57.300
And then one woman was saying telling the kid to do it and I agreed with her.

1194
01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:01.470
Cause if you're just going to stand there and you're not going to break up the

1195
01:13:01.471 --> 01:13:02.304
fight,

1196
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:04.423
<v 0>you know,</v>

1197
01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:08.540
<v 1>I dunno at that point I think everybody's guilty at that point.</v>

1198
01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:12.380
I actually thought it was great and I actually thought that that kid could have

1199
01:13:12.381 --> 01:13:13.670
swung the bottle a little harder.

1200
01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:16.490
I would have liked to seen that kid get a little more torque.

1201
01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:20.240
He needed to twist his body.
He went more with like hammer fist motion,

1202
01:13:20.241 --> 01:13:24.620
which I understand cause UFC is really popular.
But um,
you know,

1203
01:13:24.621 --> 01:13:28.100
if he got one of those,
one of those baseball videos,

1204
01:13:28.101 --> 01:13:30.130
you know how to swing a bat correctly.
You know,

1205
01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:33.770
they broke it down to the three fucking movements.
He got that thing going on.

1206
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:35.150
He would,
he would have knocked her out.

1207
01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:39.410
I just love that one of them drives up and like one of those fucking motorcars

1208
01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:42.710
cause they can't fucking walk.
So you thinking like,
oh,

1209
01:13:42.711 --> 01:13:46.100
maybe you have some sort of disease.
Maybe you're,
you're,
you're,
you're paralyzed.

1210
01:13:46.101 --> 01:13:49.160
I don't know what the fuck's going on with you,
but uh,
you know,

1211
01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.600
I respect that you're in that thing and I'm going to get out of the way.

1212
01:13:52.601 --> 01:13:56.860
And all of a sudden she fucking stands up like some preacher put his hand on her

1213
01:13:56.861 --> 01:13:59.590
forehead and churns out.
She's fine

1214
01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:03.330
and she's fighting and shit.
So it really came down.

1215
01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.280
That was the most fascinating thing to me.
It's like,

1216
01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:07.620
so why are you in that motorized cart?

1217
01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:13.220
I you just fucking lazy or you a genius because I got to admit,

1218
01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.770
you ever seen those motorized cars?
Those things can fucking fly.

1219
01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:20.790
And there is an expression why stand up when you can sit down.

1220
01:14:20.791 --> 01:14:25.200
Why sit down when you can lie down.
Why walk when you can drive,

1221
01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:31.170
you know,
all you gotta do is lay off the donuts and you're crushing it.
Um,

1222
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:33.390
anyways,
I don't know what to tell you.
All right.

1223
01:14:33.391 --> 01:14:38.340
That's the podcast for this fucking week.
I'll put the link up for that.
Um,

1224
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.120
I don't have any,
any crazy predictions for the finals.

1225
01:14:42.121 --> 01:14:46.650
I think that they're going to go the way that they're going to go.
You know,

1226
01:14:46.770 --> 01:14:50.730
I think Chicago's going to win the cup and I think Sacramento is going to win

1227
01:14:50.731 --> 01:14:54.090
the title and uh,
I'm happy for the fucking warriors,

1228
01:14:54.091 --> 01:14:57.930
men if they went and I'll be happy for the Cavaliers if they fucking win.
Um,

1229
01:14:58.050 --> 01:15:00.720
I really liked both of those teams,
both those organizations and stuff.

1230
01:15:00.721 --> 01:15:03.150
I just like him,
you know what I mean?
Neither one of us.
One in for fucking ever.

1231
01:15:03.151 --> 01:15:06.210
You really can't.
If you're a true sports fan,
you know,

1232
01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:10.510
you gotta be happy for either one.
Um,
and then as far as,
uh,

1233
01:15:10.570 --> 01:15:13.020
the Stanley Cup goes,
I'd love to see Tampa when,

1234
01:15:13.021 --> 01:15:18.000
cause I'm a huge Steve Eisenman Fan.
And um,
I just,
I said this before,

1235
01:15:18.001 --> 01:15:21.000
I just like Tampa in general.
I like the devil race.

1236
01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.840
I still call him the devil rays fucking pussies down there.
We started,

1237
01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:27.370
they have a range.
Does that mean we locked the Daryl?

1238
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:31.010
Can we just call the Royce Lean on getting nerves?
Shit,

1239
01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:35.930
I live on a houseboat and clear all the Florida.
I'll just regular buy in.

1240
01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:38.800
I don't think,
I don't think for myself.
I think could be,

1241
01:15:38.801 --> 01:15:43.801
say a word that means is this Damon's going to come out not come right up on the

1242
01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:48.190
pitcher's mound and invite the picture on their clock,

1243
01:15:48.191 --> 01:15:49.240
a vampire and then,

1244
01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:53.860
and then he fucking has lightening coming out his fingers and we all turn into

1245
01:15:53.861 --> 01:15:57.580
Damon's and are never get to see my Lord,
my savior,
Jesus Christ.

1246
01:15:58.450 --> 01:16:03.060
Can we just call him the raise?
Um,
all right,

1247
01:16:03.090 --> 01:16:07.730
that's the podcast for this week.
Go Fuck Yourself.
And on Thursday out,
Jack.
