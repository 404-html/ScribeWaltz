00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.520
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:06.570
It's bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.090
February 20th,
2017.
What's going on?
How,
why?
Yeah,

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.060
I am a recording off of my laptop.
If this sounds a little bizarre.

5
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.820
Um,
I'm in New York City,
came in town to do the,
uh,

6
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:24.390
the Patrice O'Neal benefit the fifth annual Patrice O'Neal benefit.

7
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.073
<v 0>MMM.</v>

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.090
<v 1>It's going to be going down tomorrow night at the New York City Center.</v>

9
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.490
And uh,
it should be a great time.
As you can tell.
I'm a little jet lagged.

10
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.520
I took a fucking red eye last night and there was this lady know what's

11
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:44.940
hilarious is when you have a kid,
if you actually go on the road,

12
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:48.570
the big thing when you go on the road now is not,
you know,
not the booze,

13
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:53.520
not the cigars,
not hanging out with your friends.
It becomes like,
Holy Shit,

14
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.320
I'm going to get eight hours of uninterrupted sleep.
So I get on the plane

15
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.280
<v 0>and um,</v>

16
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.120
<v 1>this woman,
not in my row,
but the next row over,</v>

17
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.910
she had a little baby and it was crying

18
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.030
and the dude next to me fell asleep and start snoring.
And,

19
00:01:16.031 --> 00:01:20.860
uh,
I just started laughing.
And,
um,
the,
the poor woman,

20
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.210
like she was traveling alone with this baby.
Right.

21
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:26.620
And [inaudible] was a baby too,
maybe a little bit older than mine.
I,
I don't,
I'm,

22
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.460
this is my first kid,
so I can't judge.
I don't know if this kid was two,

23
00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:34.720
three months,
I don't know if it was 26 years old and had that disease,

24
00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:38.710
that dead fucking baby head in the Brad Pitt movie.
Remember that?

25
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.270
Remember the old baby was just hanging around and um,

26
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.600
you know,
that guy wanted to like bang the check and he's like,

27
00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:51.950
you got to get this old baby outta here cause it's weird me out.
Which,
you know,

28
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.440
I'd like to think that that guy later on,

29
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.160
once his dick wasn't hard and he was thinking clearly again,

30
00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:01.790
he probably was thinking,
you know,
I probably shouldn't have said that.
You know,

31
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.420
I probably shouldn't have trashed that old baby.
It was a name of a band.

32
00:02:07.421 --> 00:02:11.790
I used to play an old baby and a,
you know,
we've got,

33
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.770
we've got a record contract and everything,
but uh,
you know,

34
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.350
please sing a gun,
an appendicitis.
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

35
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.520
Um,
anyway,
so the baby's fucking crying and the poor woman,

36
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.580
like she falls asleep in the baby's like freaking out screaming and she can't

37
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:31.560
hear it because she's like,
she's fucking exhausted.

38
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.500
She's got a baby and she's flying with it.
So,

39
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.740
and I'm sitting there and I'm watching the things squirming around in her hands

40
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.750
or like not really holding it anymore.

41
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.260
So now it's like this situation,
like,
is this,

42
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.550
is this lady gonna drop that fucking baby?

43
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.290
So I'm staring over there.

44
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.620
I'm sure other people will look at me thinking I was given her the evil eye

45
00:02:55.621 --> 00:02:58.020
because the baby was crying,
but I wasn't,
I was just,

46
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.590
I dunno what the fuck I thought it was going to do,

47
00:03:00.591 --> 00:03:02.120
cause I still had my seatbelt on.

48
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.863
<v 2>Okay.</v>

49
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.550
<v 1>My safety first,
then have babies.
See that?</v>

50
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:11.140
That's why I'll never be a hero.

51
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.440
Because what a true hero does is he sees danger and without any sort of self and

52
00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:21.690
he's,
and he's safe.
You know what I mean?
That's to me is a year off.

53
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.600
Like if you're,
if you're in a fucking bank,
right?

54
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.840
And these guys come in with guns and they go to rob the place and they said,

55
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:32.800
we're going to blow everybody's fucking brains out and then you act on that.

56
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.920
You're not really a hero to me.
Okay?

57
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:40.510
Because at no point in that scenario where you safe,
all right,

58
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.920
you will immediately in the situation.
So no matter how you slice it,

59
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.540
no matter how many fucking people you say that the end of the day you were

60
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:54.100
motivated to save your own ass and everybody else getting saved along with you

61
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.930
is uh,
you know,

62
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.430
that's just collateral damage that makes positive.

63
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.960
But if you're outside the bag,
you're like,
Holy Shit,
I'm out here.
I mean,

64
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:07.960
you're begging bacon,
egg and cheese sandwich.
You know,

65
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.130
getting ready to go for a run,
you know,
fuel myself up.

66
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:13.340
<v 3>Okay,</v>

67
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.370
<v 1>you stretching your fucking ham.
He said,
all of a sudden you see you,</v>

68
00:04:16.371 --> 00:04:18.860
I don't know if you look at one of those fucking giant bank windows,

69
00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:23.861
you see a robbery going down and then you go in there with you Larry Bird short

70
00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:29.570
shorts.
Right.
And fucking try to stop the rob dead to me.
Yeah.

71
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.790
That's like you what I mean you don't like,

72
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.240
there's like the hall of fame and then there's also,
you know,

73
00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:39.170
people will literally have like their own wing of a hall of fame.
Yeah.

74
00:04:39.171 --> 00:04:40.500
To me that's like,
yeah.

75
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.703
<v 3>You know,</v>

76
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.790
<v 1>that's when you get your own way.
But if you're already in the shit,
I don't,</v>

77
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:48.200
can't remember what the fuck I was talking about.
The honest with,
yeah.
Okay.

78
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.360
Not a hero.
Right.
So,

79
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.760
<v 3>okay.</v>

80
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.870
<v 1>I finally sort of flagged down the stewardess and she goes,
yes,</v>

81
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.150
you know what can I get you?
And I said,

82
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.000
I think what I have to fuck that I say,
I said,
I said,

83
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:08.500
can that baby fall?
And she started laughing.

84
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.960
<v 3>Okay.</v>

85
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.420
<v 1>Cause she thought I was being sarcastic.
Like,</v>

86
00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:16.080
I was upset with the baby crying and she thought I meant like in that baby fall

87
00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:19.950
on the ground and shut the fuck up.
And she was like taken aback.

88
00:05:19.951 --> 00:05:21.300
But she also laughed,

89
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.530
which to me immediately made a really cool that she could laugh,

90
00:05:25.531 --> 00:05:28.590
thinking that some guy was just being sarcastic,
being like,
in that baby,

91
00:05:28.591 --> 00:05:31.140
please fall on the fucking floor of an airplane.

92
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.850
Knock itself out so I can get some sleep.
And I was like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I,

93
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.580
I mean,
I was,
I'm concerned that it's going to fall.

94
00:05:38.581 --> 00:05:42.930
So she kind of went over there to make sure the baby was all right.
But,
um,

95
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.780
<v 3>okay.</v>

96
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.190
<v 1>I don't know.
I'm a changed man.
My urge was to go over and hold the baby.</v>

97
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.470
What's happened to me becoming a fucking softy?
You know?

98
00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.870
I actually know,
I told you before,

99
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:02.990
I never got mad at baby's crying on airplanes because I always felt they would,

100
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.750
they would just expressing exactly what I was feeling.

101
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.653
<v 0>MMM.</v>

102
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.170
<v 1>There's no way to get on an airplane.
And at some point,
you know,</v>

103
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.810
and unless you go in on some fucking great vacation,

104
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.770
but if you getting on there and you know you're going back to see the relatives

105
00:06:17.771 --> 00:06:21.100
or some business trip or something like that,
you know,

106
00:06:21.101 --> 00:06:25.000
and you just see some wide body coming down the fucking aisle and you're praying

107
00:06:25.001 --> 00:06:28.050
to God,
the person is not going to sit next to you.
And we,
you know,
they got to,

108
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.340
you know,
something's going to fucking happen.

109
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.993
<v 0>MMM.</v>

110
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.430
<v 1>It probably be really good for you,
for your life expectancy.</v>

111
00:06:35.431 --> 00:06:38.670
If you had access to your emotions that you could just break down crying.

112
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.513
<v 0>Uh,</v>

113
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.830
<v 1>God,
I would love to ski mentioned,</v>

114
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.170
get up on a fucking plane and it was just the 300 adults in there just crying

115
00:06:46.171 --> 00:06:50.070
like babies.
Yeah,
I'd probably be a nightmare.

116
00:06:50.071 --> 00:06:52.650
But then there's a part of me would think that that was awesome.
Anyways,

117
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.290
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
So I,
um,

118
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.670
I'm telling this fucking story in the wrong way.
I actually,
yesterday I did a,

119
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.100
I presented at a Hollywood award shelf,
old freckles,

120
00:07:07.101 --> 00:07:10.340
the big fucking phony himself.
Um,

121
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.580
when all Hollywood rented a Tuxedo shout out to Miss Detox on Wilshire

122
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.393
Boulevard,

123
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.353
<v 0>mmm.</v>

124
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.810
<v 1>Wasn't going to say.
Yeah,
I had to,
uh,</v>

125
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.690
had to do the present thing and I just sort of wrote something

126
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.910
and I quickly,
when I got to the writer's guild thing,

127
00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:35.260
I immediately was like,
wow,

128
00:07:35.261 --> 00:07:39.640
I should have not just written what I'm going to say once.

129
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.250
I should've gone over this a bunch of times.

130
00:07:42.251 --> 00:07:47.230
So I just was kind of going over it in my fucking head.
And um,
you know,

131
00:07:47.231 --> 00:07:48.970
I thought it was just going to be a bunch of writers,

132
00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:53.320
but there was some like actors there and shit,

133
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:57.950
like Denzel was there and uh,
uh,

134
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.800
who's the other guy that,
uh,
James Woods,
it was a like,

135
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.240
I don't know,
there was like serious fucking people that,

136
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.030
the thing was when you go up in front of a bunch of writers,

137
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.210
like no matter what they've accomplished,
you don't know what they look like.

138
00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:12.530
So you can't get nervous.

139
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.580
Like someone could literally have been sitting there and they wrote the best

140
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:20.600
picture Oscar winner fucking nine years in a row.
What,
nine years?

141
00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:22.640
I know what they look like,
but whatever,
you know,

142
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.380
they could accomplish shit like that.

143
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.690
You have no fucking idea who they like for the whole night.

144
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:30.360
They would just pulling people out of the crowd and I will be sitting there

145
00:08:30.361 --> 00:08:31.880
going,
I don't,
I don't know who this guy is.

146
00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:34.760
And then when they would say what the fuck they did,
I was like,
Jesus Christ.

147
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:36.283
<v 0>MMM.</v>

148
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.590
<v 1>So with every person they pulled out of the crowd,
like I dunno,</v>

149
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.620
I just felt like the pressure was getting more and more and I just kept

150
00:08:43.621 --> 00:08:46.530
muttering to myself,
this is it.
This is it one and done.

151
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.300
I'm never doing one of these fucking things again.
This is not,
this is not my,

152
00:08:51.301 --> 00:08:54.420
uh,
this is not my thing.
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing here.

153
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.620
This is stupid.
These people are,
are smart.

154
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.810
They're accomplished.

155
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.863
<v 0>Like,</v>

156
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.450
<v 1>like the shit that,
you know,
some of the fucking people in the crowd,</v>

157
00:09:05.451 --> 00:09:07.400
the stuff that they do,
you know,

158
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:11.360
what it takes to write a movie and actually get it made and then get that

159
00:09:11.361 --> 00:09:16.361
fucking giant rock up the fucking hill as opposed to me who just,

160
00:09:18.441 --> 00:09:21.230
hey,
here's a tip,
a shit job.
I think we'll try this.
You know,

161
00:09:21.231 --> 00:09:23.570
as I'm riding over on the subway to a club,

162
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.193
<v 0>mmm.</v>

163
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.180
<v 1>I Dunno.</v>

164
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.500
It just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger and a Patton Oswald hosted it,

165
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:36.000
fucking murdered.
It's monologue was great.
Uh,
is Mandala was so great.

166
00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:38.310
I kind of forgot that I had to go up.
I was just sitting there,

167
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:40.660
was a fan enjoying for an arborist,

168
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.770
was there and he went out and somehow gave his credit card information.

169
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.710
That's what he did before he said the nominees.

170
00:09:49.711 --> 00:09:52.680
And somehow we made that fucking hilarious.
And once again,

171
00:09:52.681 --> 00:09:55.680
it just made me feel like,
why am I here?
I shouldn't be here.

172
00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.630
So I'm finally waiting to go up
and I'm,

173
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:06.870
James Woods is giving some sort of lifetime achievement award to a all over

174
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:12.390
stone.
Thank God this shit wasn't televised.

175
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.143
<v 0>MMM.</v>

176
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.970
<v 1>Which is also fucking,
somebody made a reference to that.</v>

177
00:10:16.971 --> 00:10:19.700
Like nobody works fucking harder than those guys and they want to go and put it

178
00:10:19.701 --> 00:10:22.130
on TV because nobody knows what they look like,
I guess.

179
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.833
<v 0>MMM.</v>

180
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.700
<v 1>So he tells the whole fucking story of being best friends with Oliver Stone.</v>

181
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:29.990
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

182
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:34.130
<v 1>For 35 years and I have to go on after the shit and I just,</v>

183
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.840
yeah.
That's why I just kept thinking.
I just kids,
I started looking at my watch.

184
00:10:38.841 --> 00:10:42.680
The way I used to back in the day when I would do newness,

185
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.280
which is a standup expression for basically you're doing a college gig and the

186
00:10:48.891 --> 00:10:52.970
show is essentially at 12 noon or one in the afternoon.

187
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.340
It's usually in a cafeteria and it is a fucking nightmare.

188
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:04.050
You go up there and you have to do an hour and you have to stand in front of
you.

189
00:11:04.051 --> 00:11:08.780
Just stand in public in a cat fucking college cafeteria in front of like God

190
00:11:08.781 --> 00:11:10.850
knows how many,
three,
four,
five,

191
00:11:10.851 --> 00:11:14.360
600 fucking college students who have no idea

192
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.860
there's going to be any sort of performance.
Forget about a comedy show

193
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.900
and um,
like the,
the level of just fucking like,
I don't even,

194
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:26.800
I think it's like,

195
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:31.570
it's really hard for me to be humiliated now after doing enough of those.

196
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.670
Like you just get so walled off,
you just,
you just accept it.
You like,
okay,

197
00:11:36.671 --> 00:11:39.970
my life is going to suck.
Like it's never sucked.

198
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.753
<v 0>MMM.</v>

199
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:47.470
<v 1>Starting in about three minutes.
However,
in an hour,</v>

200
00:11:47.471 --> 00:11:52.330
in three minutes I'm going to be back in my rental car and I'm never going to

201
00:11:52.331 --> 00:11:56.650
see these fucking again.
That's what,
that's what I,

202
00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:58.390
that's the mindset I used to go into.

203
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:02.860
I used to go up there and I used to just psych myself up to be like,

204
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.900
how hard can I commit to these jokes?

205
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.020
How big of an ask can I make of myself?

206
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.333
<v 0>And</v>

207
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:15.510
<v 1>just to try and to not give into the horror slash negative vibe of the</v>

208
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:21.610
situation.
Because if he did that,
I learned the hard way.

209
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:26.520
You were going to burn through an hour of material in like 17 minutes and you

210
00:12:26.521 --> 00:12:28.990
are going to be angry and um,

211
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.060
your agent was going to get a call.
Um,
so anyways,

212
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.450
James Woods is going on and on and on and he brings up fuck it.

213
00:12:37.451 --> 00:12:40.590
And I don't mean that in a bad way.
It's just said,
um,

214
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.220
Oliver stone is accomplished so many things and all of this stone goes up there

215
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.280
and after a night of fucking Trump bashing,

216
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.820
just so eloquently stated that all the countries we've invaded,

217
00:12:54.401 --> 00:12:55.770
all of the stuff that we've done.

218
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.480
And he said during all of our history of doing this,

219
00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:03.870
there's been both Democrats and Republicans holding the office of President.

220
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.110
I thought I should have got more of an applause break,
but um,

221
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.030
you know,
I don't know.
The Trump thing is just such low hanging fruit.

222
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.090
At some point it's like we get it.
Hollywood does not like Trump.

223
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:17.560
Having said that,

224
00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.390
this fucking guy went on stage and did the best Trump,

225
00:13:22.391 --> 00:13:25.570
I should've gotten his name.
I was so fucking nervous.
But what I had to do,

226
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.020
he did the best Trump impression,

227
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.500
I the fucking nuance performance that he did.

228
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.553
<v 0>Uh,</v>

229
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:39.430
<v 1>it just,
it was unbelievable.
And then he did a lot of really,</v>

230
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:44.230
really fucking harsh jokes.
Like even like writers,

231
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.520
they sit and fucking writer's room.

232
00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:47.470
You wouldn't think that you'd get them to pull back.

233
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.850
It's just cause they were in public.
Um,
and he just totally fucking committed.

234
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:54.790
So I got kind of inspired by that.
So long story short,

235
00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.370
I'm sitting there waiting to go on.
And uh,

236
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.360
they mentioned that Oliver Stone,
I guess wrote Scarface,
which I didn't know.

237
00:14:04.361 --> 00:14:08.500
And I remember my mother took us to go see that my youngest brother was nine at

238
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:09.334
the time.

239
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:13.840
So I thought that was pretty cool.

240
00:14:13.841 --> 00:14:18.780
So I just went out there and I sort of winged it,

241
00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:24.740
told a story about how I used to think of pony was a small horse.
And,

242
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.800
and I don't even,
I can't remember what I said,
but I think it went okay.
And,

243
00:14:29.801 --> 00:14:30.634
um,

244
00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:36.010
I got off stage and I actually thought for half a second,
like,
you know what,

245
00:14:36.011 --> 00:14:37.630
that was actually kind of fun.

246
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.560
And I realized that a lot of buy adversion to award shows is just my own social

247
00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:49.090
anxiety of not knowing how to behave when there's a room full of people just

248
00:14:49.091 --> 00:14:50.800
saying positive shit to each other.

249
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.090
Like if that they'll give award shows were like absolute,

250
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.740
I'm not talking like roast.

251
00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:58.730
<v 0>Okay.</v>

252
00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.840
<v 1>I don't like row seeder.</v>

253
00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:02.420
I don't know what happened to roasts roast to me used to be funny.

254
00:15:02.421 --> 00:15:05.840
And then it just became just like this,
you know,
Tourette's thing.
Hey,

255
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:10.760
I wouldn't fuck you with a dog.
Dick AIDS Cock Shit cunt.
You know,

256
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:14.810
it's just like,
all right,
so and so's there,
I'm not saying any,
we'll go,
we'll go,

257
00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:19.130
we'll go.
But this Guy Bob and dub a doable,
I'd find them fucking mind.

258
00:15:19.131 --> 00:15:20.060
Numbingly boring.

259
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:21.993
<v 0>MMM.</v>

260
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.350
<v 1>But whatever is somewhere in between this somewhat,
somewhere short of that.</v>

261
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.593
<v 0>MMM.</v>

262
00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.240
<v 1>If it was totally negative,
I would have been comfortable.
So I don't,</v>

263
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.280
what the fuck that says about me.
So I figured out what my hangup was with WWE.

264
00:15:34.281 --> 00:15:35.890
I will say though,
um,

265
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:40.490
I still will never get past listening to fucking people talk politics in

266
00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:43.580
fucking,
uh,
the environmental issues.

267
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:44.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

268
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.380
<v 1>In all of that shit,
it's just like everybody knows we already know this shit.</v>

269
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:49.190
<v 0>Okay.</v>

270
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:53.210
<v 1>We already know it.
You're not going to inspire anybody.
Like,
you know,</v>

271
00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:55.430
I kind of gave a shit about the environment,

272
00:15:55.460 --> 00:16:00.460
but then when that guy from fucking a third rock from the sun set that shit

273
00:16:01.311 --> 00:16:06.170
about Antarctica,
I was like,
wait a minute,
this is an important issue.

274
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:07.723
<v 0>Uh,</v>

275
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.780
<v 1>I dunno,
maybe I'm just a negative con why am a negative comp?</v>

276
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.400
But I'll never be able to get,
I just,
I just think that's just like some,
like

277
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.210
it's like the Beyonce thing,
you know what I mean?

278
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.900
Like I never would've thought that somebody could like

279
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:28.170
exaggerate the magnitude of creating life,
but somehow she's done it.

280
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.900
My wife gets so upset when I make,
I don't,
I mean,

281
00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:39.170
I don't really have any feelings.
It's just fun to make fun of her.

282
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.390
It's her fan base is just so fucking,
I dunno.

283
00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:48.520
I was like,
I was driving me nuts when she was watching the grammys and stuff.

284
00:16:48.521 --> 00:16:49.600
Like I,
first of all,
I don't get,

285
00:16:49.601 --> 00:16:53.380
why does she get like a four hour performance and everybody else only gets like

286
00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:54.850
fucking six seconds.

287
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:56.180
<v 0>Okay.</v>

288
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:56.960
<v 1>You know,
brewer,</v>

289
00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.140
Bruno Mars is running around and doing a bunch of costume changes.
You know,

290
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.840
she comes out dressed like a Batman villain in fuck.

291
00:17:03.841 --> 00:17:06.000
It does like a 45 minutes set.

292
00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:09.770
I would think it was fair to the other performance,
but you know what,

293
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:14.420
I gotta be honest with you.
I don't think I could name one.
Wow.

294
00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.660
Ooh,
delicious.
That was a,

295
00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:20.600
that's when she was with those other two girls that she kicked to the curb.
I,

296
00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:25.270
if you're in an all girl group or if you're in a boy band,

297
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:29.740
you can't at this point,
people have to be so fucking educated that you know,

298
00:17:29.741 --> 00:17:32.440
at some point there's going to be,

299
00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:33.760
<v 0>yeah.</v>

300
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.270
<v 1>Like one person is going to go solo,
you know,</v>

301
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:42.990
it'd be extremely successful in the rest of you are just going to be sitting

302
00:17:43.061 --> 00:17:44.950
around working at staples,

303
00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:49.300
hoping that the person who left and is now wildly successful.

304
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:53.730
A solo artist will eventually have a couple of shit album.

305
00:17:53.731 --> 00:17:57.750
So they have to come back to you to do a reunion tour.
You know what I mean?

306
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.710
Like,
do you think Justin Timberlake's ever going to do the instinct thing?

307
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.510
Maybe he has.
I don't fucking know.

308
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:05.343
<v 0>Uh,</v>

309
00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.060
<v 1>well I could say,</v>

310
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.010
I guess what I'm saying is if I was in a boy band way back in the day and I

311
00:18:12.011 --> 00:18:14.290
still had my reddish orange hair,

312
00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:15.853
<v 0>mmm.</v>

313
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.480
<v 1>I would save my money.
I'd be like,
you know what?
Someone's going to break out.</v>

314
00:18:20.481 --> 00:18:21.890
I know it's not going to be making,

315
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.790
oh,
well.
Um,
anyways,

316
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.830
how far into this podcast already?
I gotta check.
I gotta check the fucking time.

317
00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.013
<v 0>MMM.</v>

318
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.930
<v 1>Hey,
how about fucking ah,
the Boston Bruins?
We were,</v>

319
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.240
we are undefeated with our new coats coach.

320
00:18:42.241 --> 00:18:43.980
I don't even know what it was in Bruce Cassidy,

321
00:18:43.981 --> 00:18:48.330
a butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid.
I already forgot his fucking name.

322
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:52.200
I've been some goddamn busy.
Um,
hey.

323
00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.870
You know what the best thing about having a baby is,
dude,

324
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.650
you can watch so much fucking sports in the first three months before they learn

325
00:18:58.651 --> 00:19:01.290
how to crawl around and shit.
Every morning.

326
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.560
<v 4>My faith,
like my daughter is like my new best friend.
I mean,</v>

327
00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:09.760
I was going to happen anyway.
Sorry for the extra noise.

328
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:13.320
So sending the laptop down.
My daughters,
my new best friend.
Okay.

329
00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:18.190
Aside from the obvious that she's my blood,
she's my daughter and everything,

330
00:19:18.191 --> 00:19:22.090
but just like on a real level,
she's my best friend.

331
00:19:22.091 --> 00:19:26.860
I probably have watched like 20 games with her already every morning.

332
00:19:26.861 --> 00:19:29.950
Right.
The lovely Nia,
you know,

333
00:19:29.951 --> 00:19:32.540
she's exhausted cause she still has to breastfeed at night.

334
00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.710
Well I just have to wake up,
you know,
and change a diaper every once in a while.

335
00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.420
Sorry for the hiccups here.

336
00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:43.740
So in the mornings I try to give my wife like three hours at least.

337
00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:45.340
You know what I mean?

338
00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:50.340
Like I got it down where if she just feeds or I can take her and then I can have

339
00:19:51.101 --> 00:19:55.990
an inch.
And you know,
I have a,
I have like,
I have a little fucking bottle,

340
00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.320
you know,
to feed her.
I can,
I can go three hours.

341
00:19:59.321 --> 00:20:02.350
I can keep her calm for fucking three hours while,
uh,

342
00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.630
my wife sleeps and all that type of stuff.

343
00:20:04.631 --> 00:20:09.631
So what I do is I just tape games and every morning we come upstairs and I just

344
00:20:11.771 --> 00:20:16.600
put her on my chest and I just sit there and I watch games with her.
And um,

345
00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.740
when she starts to cry,
you know what it is.
It was a,
what's been working for me,

346
00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.390
you know,
those giant exercise balls that people use for core strengths.

347
00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.220
I just get on one of those and I just,

348
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.560
just fucking bouncing up and down on the thing.

349
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.840
It gives them the feeling of weightlessness is some shit.

350
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:35.410
And if they start crying when you're doing the bouncing thing,

351
00:20:35.411 --> 00:20:37.270
cause it's killing my fucking back,
right.

352
00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.700
I just go fucking crazy big air.
Then they just like,
you know,

353
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.960
it makes them almost almost like when a dog wants to kill somebody and if you

354
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.740
make a loud enough noise and they fucking looks at the in another direction,

355
00:20:50.741 --> 00:20:53.710
it just,
they completely forget that they wanted to kill somebody.

356
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:58.810
Babies are like that.
Or if they start to cry,
if you get this stomach to drop,

357
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.270
they kind of go make this face like,
well,
you know,

358
00:21:01.271 --> 00:21:04.990
their eyes get big and shit and then they just kind of get into that vibe and

359
00:21:04.991 --> 00:21:07.360
then you slow.
You just slowly get it back down to three,

360
00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:10.390
four repetitions back down to the lob level that you have and they don't cry.

361
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.010
And,
um,
that eventually they fall asleep.

362
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:19.810
Then I do,
you know,
that I got to,
I got the fucking game on and um,

363
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:23.800
I've watched more fucking college who said it's going to that Duke UNC game.

364
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.790
I've been,
you know,
obviously started taping all the Duke Games.
Um,

365
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:31.780
I watched Duke,
Virginia,
I missed them against wake forest yesterday,
but,
uh,

366
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.480
I got all the rest of the year.
I think they got like,

367
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:36.850
they got Syracuse on Wednesday,

368
00:21:36.851 --> 00:21:41.230
then they got university in Miami and then a Florida state.

369
00:21:41.231 --> 00:21:45.010
And then they play UNC again March 4th.
Even if you're,

370
00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.290
you're not a huge fan of fucking college basketball.

371
00:21:47.291 --> 00:21:50.980
You've got to watch that one.
I watched Kentucky,
Georgia,
so Georgia,

372
00:21:50.981 --> 00:21:54.160
you lose another heartbreaker I watched Wisconsin,
Maryland,

373
00:21:54.161 --> 00:21:56.680
which was fucking so boring.

374
00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:01.600
I went into my fucking DVR and I had tape,
UNC,
Virginia,

375
00:22:01.601 --> 00:22:06.100
and I watched that one instead.
And once that a fucking kid,

376
00:22:06.101 --> 00:22:10.270
what's his name?
Number 44 when UNC,
the fuck is his name.

377
00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:15.490
It's a literation Justin Jamieson.
No,

378
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:20.950
I can't remember his fucking name.
I'm,
I fucking sleep deprived here.
Um,

379
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.470
totally gotten into that.

380
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:26.980
I've been watching the NHL and because of the all star break,
you know,

381
00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:29.070
the Celtics gave me a break,
you know,
cause they,
they,

382
00:22:29.071 --> 00:22:31.880
they were on the all star break and I got to watch a bunch of college shit.

383
00:22:31.881 --> 00:22:36.250
So anyways,
um,
I landed here in New York,

384
00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:38.710
slept the whole fucking flight.

385
00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.350
I had my eye mask in my earplugs and I was all good.

386
00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:45.310
That lady didn't drop dead baby and um,

387
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.020
everything was fine,
you know,
nobody tried to hijack the plane,

388
00:22:50.021 --> 00:22:55.021
everything was good and I get in the car taking the cab ride over to the hotel

389
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.020
and uh,

390
00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:01.300
they had Trump on the radio and it's just a fucking guy met Jesus Christ.

391
00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.420
He was talking about some terrorist thing that happened in Sweden.
He goes,

392
00:23:07.421 --> 00:23:11.500
I mean this happened in Sweden.
People Sweeney,

393
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.980
he yells sweet.
And again he just saw like,
I just,

394
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:17.410
I cannot fucking believe,

395
00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:24.030
I can't believe that this guy is president and I cannot believe that he's,

396
00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:30.100
he's so successful at it in that he's just implementing everything.

397
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.150
Like I didn't know you could just go around Congress with these fucking

398
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:38.680
executive orders.
Man is fucking hilarious that he's filed yet another,

399
00:23:38.681 --> 00:23:43.660
this guy is like the,
if there's like a hall of fame for filing the loophole,

400
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.410
I mean he really is like a,
he's a fucking genius.

401
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:53.090
I just wish he was more stable because,
um,
you know,

402
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.540
Hillary would have scared the shit out of me and a much quieter,

403
00:23:56.570 --> 00:24:01.520
dignified way and not even dignified just as far as she knows how to give a

404
00:24:01.521 --> 00:24:03.980
fucking speech.
But,
um,

405
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:07.540
I dunno,
I dunno,

406
00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.240
the day he stops reacting to people saying shit about them in award shows,

407
00:24:13.241 --> 00:24:16.200
I think I'll feel a little more comfortable with the fact that he's,
uh,

408
00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:18.850
you know,
in power,

409
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.450
this is like the most simple and basic thought I've ever had in my life,
right.

410
00:24:22.451 --> 00:24:26.050
Is they keep talking about how the tensions,
you know,

411
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:31.660
bit of Russia was actually in communication with Trump in Europe,

412
00:24:31.661 --> 00:24:33.580
all nervous because,
uh,

413
00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.660
Russia's fucking doing whatever over there and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

414
00:24:37.661 --> 00:24:40.300
And these guys are thinking this and these guys are thinking that.

415
00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.710
And I just was thinking like,
hey,
why doesn't everybody just fucking relax?

416
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:50.350
You know?
And I don't mean you,
I don't mean me.
We just regular,

417
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:53.680
everybody's just walking around,
you know,
living your life,

418
00:24:53.681 --> 00:24:58.540
getting a fucking newspaper.
Why don't these kinds up top,

419
00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.430
why don't you just fucking relax?

420
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.530
I know this is way too overly simplified,

421
00:25:04.531 --> 00:25:09.531
but like I would have no fucking idea what another country was thinking or

422
00:25:09.901 --> 00:25:14.300
planning to do if you weren't yammering about it.
All right?

423
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:17.100
And if the other people on the other side weren't yammering about,

424
00:25:17.101 --> 00:25:22.000
what the fuck we're trying to do?
You know,
why don't we just stay?

425
00:25:22.001 --> 00:25:25.510
Everybody just stays home.
Where's your country?

426
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.660
You fucking stay there,
right?
I don't mean refugees.

427
00:25:28.661 --> 00:25:33.490
I just mean leaders in your arms.
Just fucking stay there.
We bring our guys back.

428
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.540
Everybody just sorts out their own shit.
You know?

429
00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.870
And when people come to your country to go to your fucking water park or

430
00:25:40.871 --> 00:25:43.410
whatever,
you'd give them the Mickey mouse ears.
You give them,

431
00:25:43.411 --> 00:25:47.230
do you get to be put on a show?
Well why can't it just fucking be like the,

432
00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:52.100
you know why?
Cause they want to get the fucking,
you know,

433
00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.680
natural resources and money.
That's all the fuck it is.
That's all it is.

434
00:25:56.681 --> 00:25:59.020
I don't give a fuck of all any of that goddamn rhetoric.

435
00:25:59.021 --> 00:26:00.130
That's why the fuck they ain't doing it.

436
00:26:00.131 --> 00:26:01.760
And all they do is sit there scaring the shit.
I,

437
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.440
I just wish everybody could like regular people just collectively all at the

438
00:26:05.441 --> 00:26:10.270
same time be like and fuck it.
Yeah.
Yeah,
exactly.

439
00:26:10.271 --> 00:26:14.680
Fuck it.
Fuck everything is saying fuck wars.
Fuck all of this shit.

440
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.080
If you fucking rich concept have a problem with each other,

441
00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:21.370
why don't you sit down at your yacht clubs and try and fucking work it out?

442
00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:26.320
You know,
play a game of seven,
seven fucking something,
stud,

443
00:26:26.321 --> 00:26:27.460
whatever the final one card play,

444
00:26:27.461 --> 00:26:31.870
whatever the fuck it is he do you know enough with the blowing up of people and

445
00:26:31.871 --> 00:26:34.470
shit.
I don't know.

446
00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.260
I know it's completely over simplified but Nike at sometime.

447
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:41.560
But when I think about having mind control,
like that's what I think of doing.

448
00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.000
I haven't,
you know,

449
00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.020
we'd like people on the terrorist groups all the way to our country starts

450
00:26:48.021 --> 00:26:51.200
saying we're going to go to war.
It's just like,
yeah,
no,

451
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:56.270
you know now not all righty then and then just see what the fuck they would do.

452
00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.230
I think they would literally lose their fucking minds.

453
00:27:00.231 --> 00:27:02.570
They wouldn't know what to do because they'd just be like,
well,
now what?

454
00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.240
What am I going to do?
And if I'm not out there trying to get more,

455
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:10.540
what am I going to do?
Sit here alone with my own thoughts.

456
00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.180
How many do you think would actually take their own lives?

457
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:18.550
Like take that fatty over there in North Korea?
I'm really in over my head.

458
00:27:18.551 --> 00:27:18.881
By the way,

459
00:27:18.881 --> 00:27:23.260
if you haven't realized that this is like meet the press with no press or

460
00:27:23.261 --> 00:27:27.470
information,
it's the same thing.
I'll probably get sued by that program for a

461
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:33.430
ruining their format.
Um,
that fat cunt there,

462
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:38.920
you know,
old softy there.
It doesn't have a whisker on his fucking face.
Like,

463
00:27:38.921 --> 00:27:42.610
you know what I mean?
Like you want to be able to grow a fucking crazy beard man.

464
00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.700
You know that,
that,
that's one thing I'll have to commend that.

465
00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.790
I don't even know his name.
Kim Jong Il,
is that his name?

466
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:53.050
Was it Kim Jong Il Jr Sonny boy.

467
00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:58.150
Um,
Frank Sinatra jr whatever the fuck his name is over there.

468
00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:02.470
Like the fact that he can't grow a beard and he still has people scared
shitless.

469
00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.860
You know,
like what if they could just collectively over there,

470
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.370
everybody just be like,
yeah,
dude,
we don't give a fuck anymore.
Right.

471
00:28:09.371 --> 00:28:11.260
And everybody just goes about their business.

472
00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.980
He still gets to live in that big fucking house,
but nobody listens to him.

473
00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:20.600
Like how like nobody will kill farm anymore.
No Army.
We'll do anything.

474
00:28:20.601 --> 00:28:23.120
But he still gets to keep the giant fucking house.

475
00:28:23.121 --> 00:28:25.300
Like how fucking freaked out when he'd be,

476
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.433
<v 0>you know,</v>

477
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.240
<v 4>nobody really goes over and talks to him or anything.</v>

478
00:28:30.241 --> 00:28:33.540
So eventually he has to come out and go to like a farmer's market,

479
00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.110
you know,
and then you don't talk to them.

480
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:41.490
You force him to acclimate himself socially.
You know,

481
00:28:41.491 --> 00:28:45.900
like anybody else would if they were the new guy in town.
If I had mind control,

482
00:28:45.901 --> 00:28:50.010
that's what the fuck I went to.
Um,
what I,

483
00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:53.760
I don't know what do I,
I would probably do some evil shit.
He can't,

484
00:28:53.761 --> 00:28:58.350
even if you could control the entire world's fucking brains.
Yeah.

485
00:28:58.351 --> 00:29:02.460
I don't think,
I
don't think I can handle that power.
I fuck that.
I,

486
00:29:02.461 --> 00:29:07.140
that was a dumb idea.
All right,
let's,
let's read some,
uh,
let's read some fucking,

487
00:29:07.141 --> 00:29:11.400
uh,
advertising here for this week.
All right.
Uh,

488
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:16.430
wince pronounced the Winc spelled [inaudible] without the Ewi.

489
00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:17.813
NC.

490
00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:18.950
<v 0>Okay.</v>

491
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:22.320
<v 4>All right.
With see India,
November Charlie,
finding new.</v>

492
00:29:22.321 --> 00:29:26.100
Great new wine is tough.
You know,
I can tell you I've got to agree with these.

493
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.780
I got agree with these fucking people.
That to said constantly.

494
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.510
I know they don't like when I say that during these reads,

495
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:34.350
I actually agree with these guys.
Finding good wine is difficult.

496
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.560
It's like trying to find a good cigar.
Like where the fuck do you start?

497
00:29:37.561 --> 00:29:42.370
There's so many of them.
There's so many articles.
There's so much fake news.

498
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.630
Fake news about the cigars.
I'm finding new one is tough.

499
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:52.370
That's why I've been telling you all about our sponsor,
a club,
w column,
JB,

500
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:53.680

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:13.960

507
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:18.070
It's still the same amazing wine company introducing you to new wines that you

508
00:30:18.071 --> 00:30:20.880
love.
Why did they switch from club w to something that you,

509
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:25.420
it's really difficult to pronounce and spell winked works directly.

510
00:30:25.421 --> 00:30:27.580
It's not,
I'm not saying it's difficult to pronounce,

511
00:30:27.581 --> 00:30:30.730
but like if you looked at w I n C I mean you're not thinking wink.

512
00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:33.690
What does that stand for?

513
00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:34.670
<v 3>Okay.</v>

That's mean alcohol.
You know what I mean?

540
00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:18.560
<v 1>When you ship a bunch of wine
and what's going to happen,</v>

541
00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:24.260
you know
some woman's going to slur around some guy,

542
00:32:24.261 --> 00:32:26.390
I'll start crying.
It's just wine,
right?

543
00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.180
I hope this isn't making too much noise as I'm moving this thing around,

544
00:32:29.181 --> 00:32:33.110
but like I can only sit in one position for so long.
It's part of it.

You pissed your pants but you fine because they have that fucking Modell's.

550
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:52.420
It'll dry up the grapes and you'll be a power when you take your nuts and your

551
00:32:52.431 --> 00:32:53.720
dick out.
Yo,

I hope you drank some fucking white wine or your bulls will be purple.
Me undies.

553
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:00.170
Picture a picture.

554
00:33:00.171 --> 00:33:04.880
A world we're putting on a new pair of underwear isn't just fresh.

555
00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:08.750
You stepping into a better day.
So you've got to take a shower first.

556
00:33:08.751 --> 00:33:11.720
You can't just put on a fresh pair of underwear,
you gotta take a shower,

557
00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:13.130
then you put it on a fresh pair of underwear.

558
00:33:13.131 --> 00:33:16.460
If you combine that with a fresh pair of socks telling you right now,

559
00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:19.640
your energy is going to be crazy.
Like,
do you realize that there's,

560
00:33:19.641 --> 00:33:24.320
there's women out there that married guys because the first time they met them,

561
00:33:24.321 --> 00:33:27.830
they were wearing a fresh pair of underwear and socks and they just felt this

562
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:29.610
amazing energy from,
you know,

563
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:34.730
and then now they're stuck in this lovely loveless marriage,

564
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:40.130
wondering where it all went.
And what they have to understand is that like,

565
00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:45.110
you know,
ladies,
if you,
if you want you guide to treat you nice.
Okay?

566
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.110
Every once in a while you got to go out.

567
00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:49.910
You gotta make sure you update his fucking underwear and sock drawer.

568
00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.640
They'll put them in a better mood.
You know what I mean?

569
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.460
You don't have to cower in the corner anymore.
All right?
Think about it.

570
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.990
Underwear.
It's the first thing you put on in the last thing you take off.

571
00:33:59.991 --> 00:34:01.190
Unless you Matthew mcconaughey,

572
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:04.760
why would you settle for anything less than the best feeling underwear on the

573
00:34:04.761 --> 00:34:06.280
planet?
Um,
you,

574
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.250

576

My friends that in the Andes,
I don't know.

577
00:34:15.891 --> 00:34:20.630
You sent me a few pairs awhile back and now I can't imagine wearing anything

578
00:34:20.631 --> 00:34:25.310
else.
I where I wear,
I,

581
00:34:30.831 --> 00:34:34.670

So why is your mattress one size fits all well?

606
00:35:55.941 --> 00:35:58.670
Because there's a basic shape of a fucking human being.

607
00:35:58.671 --> 00:36:01.910
Not to mention his size because,
oh,
I'm sorry.

608
00:36:01.911 --> 00:36:05.000
I guess I had the wrong answer because it truly customized mattress will cost

I want to thank everybody,
uh,

655
00:38:42.131 --> 00:38:45.610
the night before the Patrice or only your benefit for everybody that has,
uh,

656
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.280
bought tickets once again.
Um,

657
00:38:48.281 --> 00:38:52.750
and we've been able to keep this benefit going and I cannot even begin to tell

658
00:38:52.751 --> 00:38:56.650
you how much this has helped his loved ones.
Um,

659
00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:01.830
it's just been such a great thing and a is sad and tragic as it always will be

660
00:39:02.261 --> 00:39:05.560
that he passed away too soon.
Um,

661
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:11.310
just all you guys stepping it up every year and seeing like just how much that

662
00:39:11.381 --> 00:39:16.240
has changed,
uh,
and help the peoples that he was helping out when he was alive.

663
00:39:16.241 --> 00:39:20.710
It's just I can't thank you enough.
All right.
Okay.
Uh,

664
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:24.850
Friday the 13th bullshit.
Oh,
this is,
um,

665
00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.110
this is in regards to,

666
00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:31.520
I was talking about that like why is Friday the 13th unlucky rather than Monday

667
00:39:31.521 --> 00:39:35.330
the 13th.
So this person comes to me with this.
It says bill,

668
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:39.020
with regards to your podcast involving Friday the 13th,

669
00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:44.530
the main superstition that spread was amongst sailors during the late 17th

670
00:39:44.871 --> 00:39:49.640
century who considered setting sail on any Friday to be a bad omen.

671
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.020
And given that most people,
including pirates,
were God fearing Christians.

672
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:55.250
The 13,

673
00:39:55.790 --> 00:40:00.790
the 13 relating to the last supper being the night before Jesus died according

674
00:40:01.221 --> 00:40:03.620
to historical hearsay,

675
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.070
the 13 relating to the last supper,

676
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:12.960
the night before Jesus died where they're 13 upon,

677
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.720
there was 12 apostles plus Jesus.
That was 13.

678
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:17.290
<v 3>Okay.</v>

679
00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:19.360
<v 4>If the 13th fell on front,
well first of all,</v>

680
00:40:19.361 --> 00:40:23.110
I don't understand why didn't sailors wait until the 17 hundreds.

681
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:27.680
They waited 1700 years,
minus 32 years,

682
00:40:27.681 --> 00:40:32.600
so they waited 1,600 and fucking 68 years.

683
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:38.890
People have been sailing for fucking ever.
They were sailing back in Jesus's Day.

684
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:42.430
Right?
Well,
I guess there was no fucking social media,

685
00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:46.180
so it took a while for the story to get out.
I Dunno.
Anyways,

686
00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:47.680
if the 13th fell on Friday,

687
00:40:47.681 --> 00:40:51.070
most docs imports would be emptied out as sailors believe this to be the

688
00:40:51.071 --> 00:40:55.750
greatest ill omen there could possibly be and for reason and reason enough not

689
00:40:55.751 --> 00:41:00.751
to work on the day or get out of bed for that matter is most people of that time

690
00:41:01.151 --> 00:41:04.930
hung crucifixes over their bed and believed it to be the safest place in the

691
00:41:04.931 --> 00:41:07.690
house that I'm going to say most people didn't do that.

692
00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:09.190
<v 3>Okay.</v>

693
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:12.940
<v 4>You know what I mean?
I would just say like if back in the day,</v>

694
00:41:12.941 --> 00:41:14.860
if TV news existed,

695
00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:19.060
those were the people's houses that they would go to and they would try to scare

696
00:41:19.061 --> 00:41:23.080
the shit out of everybody about Friday the fucking 13th but I think they would.

697
00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:26.770
I think that there was a lot of fucking people back then.
Even back then,

698
00:41:26.771 --> 00:41:29.200
that were just like,
dude,
are you finding you a fucking

699
00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:30.600
<v 3>okay?</v>

700
00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.950
<v 4>It was people back then that said,
Jesus Shit never happened.</v>

701
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.650
They would say it's a couple of pieces of wood.

702
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:40.040
It makes the shape of a cross.
It's,
it's,

703
00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:43.760
it's not like some holy fucking [inaudible] imagine there was plenty of people,

704
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:46.730
granted they probably got lit on fire if they said some shit like that.

705
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.950
I have no idea.
So anyways,
it sounds pretty basic now,

706
00:41:51.951 --> 00:41:54.590
but back in the day,
people simply didn't know any better.

707
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:58.670
If you fell sick around a Friday,
you were unlucky around,
uh,

708
00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:03.110
around a 13th of a month.
Also unlucky.
But the two together,

709
00:42:03.111 --> 00:42:06.920
somehow it was much worse.
Dip Shit.
Ancestors.

710
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:11.540
Um,
oh,
they just lack the information.
Jesus Christ.

711
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:15.860
What about us?
We're the smart ones ruining the fucking oceans.

712
00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:19.790
The Great Barrier Reef is dead.
You know,
they didn't fucking go.

713
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:21.770
They woulda killed it if they had the fucking opportunity.

714
00:42:21.771 --> 00:42:26.390
You know what did the same dip shits we are right now.
All right.
Canadian,

Oh,
you know what,
I,
I meant to look this up.

716
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:36.770
So did you hear about this guy who beheaded and eight another guy and they set

717
00:42:36.771 --> 00:42:37.604
free?

718
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:42.330
How the fuck is he allowed free and why wasn't he executed?

719
00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:47.370
How do they know he won't relapse into another murder slash?

720
00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.550
Dinner?
Am I crazy by saying if you murder someone,

721
00:42:50.551 --> 00:42:55.110
you should be murdered yourself.
Um,
well yeah,
if,

722
00:42:55.111 --> 00:42:58.170
if people didn't lie,
you know,

723
00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:02.850
if there weren't people wrongly convicted,
I mean,
I just,
if I feel like though,

724
00:43:02.851 --> 00:43:05.310
if it's beyond a shadow of a fucking doubt,

725
00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:07.843
<v 0>uh,</v>

726

727
00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:13.910
the animals kids or if you eat somebodies head on a bus,
I would have to say,

728
00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:18.410
you know,

730
00:43:20.841 --> 00:43:22.640

731
00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.430
I'm finally going to start posting videos of them and start doing tours of

732
00:43:25.431 --> 00:43:29.030

<v 4>I'm sorry guys.</v>

742
00:44:11.921 --> 00:44:14.230
This is usually what I'll try to hit fucking pause so you don't have to go

743
00:44:14.231 --> 00:44:19.210
through the torture of this.
All right,

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:40.490
a Canadian man who was found not criminally responsible for beheading and

749
00:44:40.741 --> 00:44:45.720
cannibalizing a fellow passenger on a Greyhound bus has been granted his
freedom.

750
00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.900
He cut somebody's head off,

751
00:44:49.901 --> 00:44:53.560
fucking aided and wasn't criminally responsible or who was

752
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:59.400
Manitoba's Criminal Code Review Board announced Friday.
It will give.

753
00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:03.990
It is given.
Will Baker formerly known as Vince Sleep?
Well,

754
00:45:03.991 --> 00:45:05.640
thanks for fucking up his identity.

755
00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:07.313
<v 5>MMM.</v>

756
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:11.230
<v 4>And an absolute discharge meeting.</v>

757
00:45:11.231 --> 00:45:13.780
He is no longer subject to monitoring

758
00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:18.880
man who thought roommate was a Zombie pleads guilty to murder.
Okay.

759
00:45:18.881 --> 00:45:22.030
What the fuck is going on in Canada?
That's a completely different story.

760
00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.280
He's a rabbit hole.
I'll read that one.
Next.

761
00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:28.690
Baker a diagnosed schizophrenia killed Tim Mclean,

762
00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:32.290
a young carnival worker.
Jesus Christ.
See,

763
00:45:32.291 --> 00:45:36.190
this is why you never take bosses,
Carney workers,
schizophrenia.

764
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.450
It's just you know,
you're taking your life in your hands.

765
00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:45.810
A young carnival worker who was a complete stranger to Baker in 2008 a year

766
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:50.680
later,
he was found not criminally responsible due to mental illness.
Okay.

767
00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:52.720
Mclean's mother,
Carol,

768
00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:57.370
whatever has been outspoken against granting bakers for her or his own mother is

769
00:45:57.371 --> 00:45:57.581
saying,

770
00:45:57.581 --> 00:46:02.140
don't set this guy free saying there'd be no way to ensure he continued to take

771
00:46:02.141 --> 00:46:04.770
his meds.
She declined.
Comment in a,

772
00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:08.470
in a post on Facebook Fridays saying,
I have no words.

773
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:12.030
Baker was initially kept in a secure wing of a psychiatric hospital,

774
00:46:12.031 --> 00:46:13.840
was given more freedom every year.

775
00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:17.110
He's been living on his own and Winnipeg apartment since November,

776
00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:21.370
but it was still subject to monitoring trait to ensure he took his medication.

777
00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:26.350
Baker's Docker,
dude,
this is fucking insane.

778
00:46:26.351 --> 00:46:28.090
You let a head eat go free.

779
00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.033
<v 5>MMM,</v>

780
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:36.180
<v 4>I dunno dude.
Do you think that they should kill people who are mentally insane?</v>

781
00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:38.101
I mean,
what are you going to do?

782
00:46:38.101 --> 00:46:40.290
Are you going to stick them in a room and beat him?
For instance,

783
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.430
Flintstone vitamins for a select right.

784
00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:46.020
Made him thought roommate was a Zombie pleads guilty to murder.

785
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:49.950
These are all just mentally ill people here,
man.

786
00:46:49.951 --> 00:46:54.951
A 38 year old man who said he beat his roommate to death because he thought she

787
00:46:55.081 --> 00:46:58.630
was a Zombie,
pleaded no contest.
The secondary murder.

788
00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:02.260
Now I'm sitting there wondering,

789
00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:05.050
maybe he just beat her to death and now he's just trying to act like he's

790
00:47:05.051 --> 00:47:09.130
fucking insane.
Um,
guy entered the plea Friday,

791
00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:15.070
ms strangling and beating death of 35 year old Jennifer Lopez.

792
00:47:15.071 --> 00:47:19.590
Not the same.
I want to obviously,
uh,

793
00:47:19.591 --> 00:47:22.960
cause the Kansas City Star reported Wallace told police he had fallen asleep

794
00:47:22.961 --> 00:47:25.420
after taking a methamphetamine court.

795
00:47:25.421 --> 00:47:29.320
Documents said he began beating Lopez when she woke up because he thought she

796
00:47:29.321 --> 00:47:34.150
was a Zombie.
He told police he kept being Lopez until something made him stop.

797
00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:35.843
<v 3>Okay.</v>

798
00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:39.090
<v 4>Wow.
This is not a funny podcast anymore.
Now is it,
um,</v>

799
00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.770
uh,
should you be murdered if you murder somebody?

800
00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:46.530
I think without a fucking doubt,
if they know you did it.
Yeah.

801
00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:48.403
<v 5>MMM.</v>

802
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:54.400
<v 4>And uh,
yeah.</v>

803
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:59.140
Yeah.
I mean,
I,
you know,
I saw it.

804
00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:01.840
I don't want to say what this fucking person did do a kid,

805
00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.300
but the kid died and like,
I was just like,

806
00:48:04.301 --> 00:48:05.890
why is that person still walking on the earth?

807
00:48:05.891 --> 00:48:07.180
There's definitely times where I feel that,

808
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:09.580
and I don't think that that makes us as bad as they are.

809
00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:11.183
<v 5>MMM.</v>

810
00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:16.720
<v 4>But prison is a big business,
so,
you know,
they want that fucking guy in a cell.</v>

811
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:21.210
All right.
Ministry of truth.
Hey there,
Billy.
Hey Billy.

812
00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.680
Of Rights.
Uh,
I'm sorry guys.

813
00:48:24.681 --> 00:48:28.760
I'm so fucking jet lag to this podcast is really just fucking lagging here.

814
00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:32.000
Dragging,
I should say.
Lots of people are comparing Trump to Hitler.

815
00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:33.170
<v 3>Okay.</v>

816
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:34.400
<v 4>Uh,
but back in December,</v>

817
00:48:34.401 --> 00:48:38.510
Obama tried to quietly pass a bill that would allow the government,
yeah,

818
00:48:38.511 --> 00:48:42.560
I saw this have jurisdiction over news and outgoing information on all channels.

819
00:48:42.561 --> 00:48:45.380
I.
E.
TV,
Internet,
radio.
That includes you.

820
00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:48.260
You can read the fine print in the article below.
Also,

821
00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:52.280
fuck all the people listening who haven't read the legislation but are,
uh,

822
00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:56.530
already up in arms because it goes against who they cheer for.
Amen to that.

823
00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:59.530
Amen to that.
Everybody,
like,
like last night,

824
00:48:59.531 --> 00:49:03.310
all these fucking guys at this fucking award show everybody trashing Donald

825
00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:03.550
Trump,

826
00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:08.320
nobody brings up the fact that Obama basically signed something that is going to

827
00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:12.130
implement an incredible level of fucking censorship.
Like they're,

828
00:49:12.131 --> 00:49:16.000
they're basically going to decide what is real news and what is fake news.

829
00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.810
I mean,
I'd like to think,
because I openly admit that I don't read,

830
00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:26.620
and the shit that I say is just fucking absurd that I would be exempt,

831
00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:33.320
but who knows?
But like people with blue ties do this shit all the fucking time.

832
00:49:33.321 --> 00:49:33.620
And that's,

833
00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:38.620
that's what kills me about people who wear red ties and watch Fox News and the

834
00:49:39.321 --> 00:49:41.990
Hollywood people.
Like they just cannot see the bullshit

835
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:44.940
all out of the only six.
It's like,

836
00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:48.630
it's like listening to was a fanatic red sox and Yankees Fan.

837
00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:51.090
You know what I mean?
You know,

838
00:49:51.091 --> 00:49:55.050
giving each other shit for buying titles in fucking abusing steroids.

839
00:49:55.051 --> 00:49:57.720
And it's like,
no,
we both did it.
We bought it.

840
00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:03.900
We should hang our heads in shame collectively.
Um,

841
00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:06.870
all right.
Let me see if I can find this.
This are,
I,

842
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:10.280
I don't really even want to fucking read this because this is just so fucking,

843
00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:12.200
<v 3>yeah.</v>

844
00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.520
<v 4>Uh,
let's see.</v>

845
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:19.120
So the AI have signed into law S.
Dot.
Two nine four three,

846
00:50:19.121 --> 00:50:24.121
the National Defense Authorization Act for the fiscal year 2017 this act

847
00:50:24.731 --> 00:50:29.360
authorizes fiscal year 2017 appropriations principally for the department of

848
00:50:29.361 --> 00:50:32.900
Defense and the Department of energy national security programs provides vital

849
00:50:32.901 --> 00:50:36.560
benefits for military personnel families.
Okay.
Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

850
00:50:36.561 --> 00:50:40.280
blah.
And where do we get to the,

851
00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:43.750
yeah.
Do I can't read all of this.

852
00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:48.520
I can't read all of this.
I don't want to fucking,

853
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:50.810
this will take me fucking three hours to read out to this.

854
00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:54.900
This would have to be a part of a,
a mini series for me to read all of this.

855
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:59.460
Okay?
Uh,
here's some Oh shit and bold.

856
00:50:59.461 --> 00:51:03.810
The first priority is developing a whole of government strategy for countering

857
00:51:03.811 --> 00:51:08.811
the foreign propaganda and disinformation being wage wage against us and our

858
00:51:09.181 --> 00:51:13.860
allies by our enemies.
Now that reads great,
but it's basically,

859
00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:19.110
you know,
they want to listen to our propaganda,
not their fucking propaganda.

860
00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:23.730
You know,
our version of what's going on is right and their version is wrong.

861
00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:28.650
We're all fallible.
We're all fucking human beings,
but we don't make mistakes.

862
00:51:28.651 --> 00:51:32.250
They do.
So,
I dunno.
It just gets back to all of that shit.
And you know what?

863
00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:33.330
Sorry,
you're never going to solve.

864
00:51:33.331 --> 00:51:35.730
And even everybody's sin starts fucking screaming at each other.

865
00:51:35.731 --> 00:51:37.230
And if you ever bring up something like that,

866
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:40.260
people call you a socialist and tell you to get the fuck out of the country.

867
00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:40.921
If you,

868
00:51:40.921 --> 00:51:45.330
if you would ever even remotely suggest that this government would ever fucking

869
00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:49.860
lie,
they all lie to their fucking people.
Uh Oh God,
they'll shut up.

870
00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:52.980
Okay dear Billy beer thighs.
Um,

871
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:55.620
forgive my poor English.

872
00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:59.640
Well the fact that he can come up Billy Beard thighs in a fucking second

873
00:51:59.641 --> 00:52:02.520
language is pretty amazing.
So I I think your English is fucking,
yeah,

874
00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:03.840
<v 1>great.
Um,</v>

875
00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:08.370
I am a native Berliner but I have family across Germany.

876
00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:13.080
One of my female cousins was harassed on the way to work by some people who are

877
00:52:13.081 --> 00:52:13.914
different.

878
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:19.200
I didn't want to s I do not want to say just a different race or religion,

879
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.780
but also a different way of thinking.

880
00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:27.180
They are not native to Germany and are not acclimating well to western life.

881
00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:30.870
I am not a racist and I find the issues very sensitive,

882
00:52:30.871 --> 00:52:35.871
but I believe that reality has to play a part in one's objective view.

883
00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:41.220
I'm not against refugees or anyone displaced because of terrible political and

884
00:52:41.221 --> 00:52:45.420
military situations,
but also have a new opinion because of my cousin.

885
00:52:45.690 --> 00:52:46.560
She is okay,

886
00:52:46.561 --> 00:52:51.561
but had 19 stitches in the back of her neck and head from a bottle thrown at her

887
00:52:52.381 --> 00:52:54.690
because she was a woman walking alone at night.

888
00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:58.350
This is not the first time this has happened in her town.

889
00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.230
<v 5>MMM.</v>

890
00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:05.250
<v 1>That was good enough to show good graces to refugees.
Uh,</v>

891
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.760
if countries are going to let people in,

892
00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:11.510
they have to at least be okay with women having certain rights.

893
00:53:11.511 --> 00:53:16.460
Should they not forget about religion or release.
That's just good and bad.

894
00:53:16.461 --> 00:53:16.730
Um,

895
00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:21.410
I think am I a bad person for becoming a more cautious person when it comes to

896
00:53:21.411 --> 00:53:26.100
refugees?
Thank you and cheers on your new child.
Uh,
no,
not at all.

897
00:53:26.101 --> 00:53:29.400
I mean a lot of that and also people's prejudice because you're German,

898
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:33.510
they're going to fucking think a certain way.
But like,
you know,

899
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:38.820
if one of the elements that comes into play is that from wherever these other

900
00:53:38.821 --> 00:53:39.840
people are from,

901
00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:44.400
that a woman walking alone at night is suggesting that she's fucking,
I dunno,

902
00:53:44.401 --> 00:53:49.160
I dunno what loose or having sex or whatever the fuck it is that's going to make

903
00:53:49.161 --> 00:53:52.290
them throw a God damn bottle.
Like how do you not address that?

904
00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:54.523
MMM.

905
00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.850
And also to me it's like what kind of a fucking person,

906
00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:05.960
you know,
when I go to another country,
like whatever I see,
I just go,
oh,

907
00:54:05.961 --> 00:54:10.310
I guess that's how they do it over here.
I don't think like,
you know,
well,

908
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:14.000
I'm from someplace else and this is the way we do it.

909
00:54:14.001 --> 00:54:17.510
So I'm going to act like we're still in my country.
I think that's ignorant,
but,

910
00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:22.040
um,
never underestimate the power of religion.
You know,

911
00:54:22.041 --> 00:54:26.540
when people really get into it,
when they really fucking get into it,

912
00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:30.670
um,
I,
you know,
there's,

913
00:54:30.671 --> 00:54:34.300
there's something where your brain goes on like autopilot and you just let

914
00:54:34.570 --> 00:54:38.950
religion make decisions for you and rational thought kind of goes out the

915
00:54:38.951 --> 00:54:42.760
fucking window and you just start breaking one commandment after another.

916
00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:46.360
Like you tell me one religion out there,

917
00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:51.220
if you could find it in whatever book it is that you read that say it's that

918
00:54:51.221 --> 00:54:56.221
says it's fucking okay to throw a fucking bottle at a woman walking alone at

919
00:54:57.751 --> 00:55:00.120
night.
I mean,
it shouldn't you give me an if you think it's,

920
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:05.910
you should have walked her home if you were concerned about like,
I dunno,

921
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:10.730
I don't understand.
Like,
um,
but yeah,
one of the things,

922
00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:15.710
um,
I think refugees should,
like,
if I,
if okay,

923
00:55:15.711 --> 00:55:16.180
say this,

924
00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:20.480
this country goes to complete shit and there's a big war and all of a sudden

925
00:55:20.481 --> 00:55:25.430
they're hunting down fucking bald redheads and I need to seek political asylum

926
00:55:25.431 --> 00:55:28.160
or some shit in another country.
When I go there,

927
00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:31.760
the first thing I'm going to do is try to learn the fucking language and then

928
00:55:31.761 --> 00:55:34.940
I'm going to try to figure out,
okay,

929
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:38.900
how do they do shit over here?
You know what I mean?

930
00:55:38.901 --> 00:55:42.440
So I don't fucking offend anybody and so I don't get the shit kicked out of me.

931
00:55:42.441 --> 00:55:47.150
But I would say the type of people that throw a bottle like that,

932
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:48.223
um,

933
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:49.980
<v 3>okay.</v>

934
00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:50.311
<v 1>You know,</v>

935
00:55:50.311 --> 00:55:54.360
they're also the kind of people that if they were in a higher up in a corporate

936
00:55:54.361 --> 00:55:55.890
thing that they would be a

937
00:55:58.350 --> 00:56:00.480
pilfering the coffers as they say or whatever.

938
00:56:00.481 --> 00:56:03.900
Like there's just certain people out there that just,
they're not good people.

939
00:56:03.901 --> 00:56:07.620
There's certain people that are just not smart people.
Um,

940
00:56:07.621 --> 00:56:11.520
that's one of the fucking problems with human beings is this,

941
00:56:11.521 --> 00:56:13.980
a lot of mouth breathing morons.
And,
uh,

942
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.090
when you accept a bunch of refugees,
you know,

943
00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:21.750
you're going to get some fucking super smart people all the way down to mouth

944
00:56:21.751 --> 00:56:24.190
breathing morons.
Um,

945
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.180
I don't think you're,
yeah.

946
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:31.120
Why wouldn't you be more cautious when it came to refugee subs if something like

947
00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:34.540
that happen?
I mean,
now having said that within your own country,

948
00:56:34.541 --> 00:56:39.360
you also have neo Nazis.
You know what I mean?
So,

949
00:56:39.361 --> 00:56:42.570
you know,
uh,
if you're suggesting getting rid of all refugees,

950
00:56:42.571 --> 00:56:46.680
then you should also do something about Neo Nazi.
So,
um,

951
00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:50.610
the hard fucking thing when people go to a new country is they don't look like

952
00:56:50.611 --> 00:56:51.630
the people that are there.

953
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:55.470
So they stick out like a fucking sore thumb and people stopped looking at them

954
00:56:55.471 --> 00:56:58.590
as human beings.
They just look at them and just one giant group.

955
00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:02.250
Whereas if you look at a fucking neo Nazi,
he's still a fucking white dude.

956
00:57:02.251 --> 00:57:06.120
I'm assuming you're white German,
right?
And you're like,
yeah,
that guy,

957
00:57:06.121 --> 00:57:08.280
he's a fucking moron.
You know what I mean?

958
00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:12.000
You're just looking at him like he joined a stupid club despite the fact that

959
00:57:12.001 --> 00:57:15.960
those people can do some really horrific shit too.
So,
um,
but I don't think,

960
00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:17.140
<v 3>okay,</v>

961
00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:21.460
<v 1>you know,
you're a bad person for becoming more cautious.
Um,</v>

962
00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:25.240
but I would also remain open minded that this is going to be some really great

963
00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:28.630
people that were lucky enough to get out of those bad situations.

964
00:57:28.631 --> 00:57:33.130
And that's the hard part.
The easy thing is to just say fuck all of these people.

965
00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.640
And uh,
you know,
that's,
that's the basic,

966
00:57:36.641 --> 00:57:41.350
let's sit down and eat some fritos and cake.
Um,
or you can actually

967
00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.700
do the crunches,
your

968
00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:50.500
<v 4>cardio and actually try to look at people as individuals.</v>

969
00:57:50.501 --> 00:57:55.210
Now having said that,
when the sun goes down at night,
all bets are Ra.

970
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:59.920
You have to look at people you know,
the most cautiously,

971
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:02.290
as cautiously,
as high as you possibly can,

972
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:06.070
because I guarantee you that even if they had a fucking rule about that during

973
00:58:06.071 --> 00:58:08.270
the day,
if there was a bunch of people walking around,
the,

974
00:58:08.271 --> 00:58:11.680
the chances of them doing that during the day would have been much less.
So,

975
00:58:11.681 --> 00:58:16.681
I'm sorry that happened to one of your cousins.

976
00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:20.110
Uh,
I hope it doesn't turn you into a hateful person.

977
00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:23.110
You seem like you're trying to be measured.
I Dunno,

978
00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:26.380
but it would suck if you became another hateful person because,
uh,

979
00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:30.670
it just going to add fuel to all of this blue tie,
red ties.
Shit.
All right,

980
00:58:30.671 --> 00:58:35.050
dear Billy Butkus
on Valentine's Day,

981
00:58:35.051 --> 00:58:39.220
my ex whom I love people to know how to use whom,

982
00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:44.170
you know,
who and whom.
I'd looked up the definition fucking a hundred times.

983
00:58:44.171 --> 00:58:46.120
I believe I've read it on this podcast.

984
00:58:46.121 --> 00:58:49.870
I still for the life of me cannot figure it out.
Um,
on Valentine's Day,

985
00:58:49.871 --> 00:58:54.640
my ex who I had been dating for three years,

986
00:58:54.641 --> 00:58:59.641
came to my job at a bar with an new much younger day,

987
00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:04.540
sat with her for hours and proceeded to get a cab home with her.

988
00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:09.220
My coworkers obviously told me and I was devastated.
Well,

989
00:59:09.221 --> 00:59:10.240
that's why he did it.

990
00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:14.320
We've been broken up for two and a half months and it was a really tough
breakup.

991
00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:15.640
I know I deserve better,

992
00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:19.270
but I feel like he's driving me out of a small town that I generally love.

993
00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:23.930
This isn't the first time he's a public show with a woman with women.

994
00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:29.000
Um,
at this point I just want to want to move and start over what it should take.

995
00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:32.180
Uh,
my take is that you,
uh,

996
00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:36.560
you're a lucky woman that you,
you,

997
00:59:36.561 --> 00:59:39.830
you didn't hit your wagon to someone that's stead fucking petty.

998
00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:41.513
<v 5>MMM.</v>

999
00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.670
<v 4>Then yeah,
I don't,
I mean,
I'd like that.
Like,
that's</v>

1000
00:59:47.770 --> 00:59:48.270
<v 5>okay.</v>

1001
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:50.220
<v 4>I just liked the way you described it.</v>

1002
00:59:50.221 --> 00:59:53.580
I look at that guy as though he's pathetic and I feel like,

1003
00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:57.630
and I feel bad for the woman that he brought there because I feel like he was

1004
00:59:57.631 --> 00:59:59.940
barely listening to her in pretending to be smiling,

1005
00:59:59.941 --> 01:00:04.050
having a good time as he was trying to look around to see if he could catch you.

1006
01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:08.690
I mean,
he basically went out of his way to hurt you.
We obviously,
when you're,

1007
01:00:08.691 --> 01:00:11.700
you,
you're going to break up with somebody that's going to be that awful pain

1008
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:14.880
because usually somebody wants it and the other person doesn't.

1009
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:18.180
So it's bad enough that that went down.
Now if you dumped him,

1010
01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:23.190
but I feel like if you dumped him,
you wouldn't be that upset about it.
Um,

1011
01:00:23.330 --> 01:00:25.970
and you did say it was really tough.
So,
uh,

1012
01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:30.020
what I would say is happy do yourself a celebratory glass of fucking wine,

1013
01:00:30.021 --> 01:00:32.090
whatever your poison is that right?

1014
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:33.343
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1015
01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:37.900
<v 4>You didn't marry this count.
And uh,</v>

1016
01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:45.740
I dunno,
I think at some point,
I mean if you really love him,
be ashamed.

1017
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:46.320
If you've,

1018
01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.780
if you really love living while you were at that you would move just because

1019
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:53.700
some shallow con is bringing some woman that always,

1020
01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:56.530
I mean he obviously does not give a fuck about that one cause I,

1021
01:00:56.531 --> 01:00:57.364
I'll just tell you this,

1022
01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:02.520
if that guy in two and a half months found the one and found true love lists,

1023
01:01:03.171 --> 01:01:07.780
petty shit with you would not even be an issue.
So,

1024
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:10.400
<v 3>okay.</v>

1025
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.610
<v 4>Maybe a new way of looking at it is feeling bad for the woman that he's with.</v>

1026
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:15.343
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1027
01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:20.480
<v 4>Because he's wasting her time and I,
I could Guaran fucking tee you.</v>

1028
01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:25.820
She has no idea who you are and if she does,

1029
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:28.850
then the two fucking psychos that deserve each other,

1030
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:32.840
that should both be sterilized because they're going to make an evil baby.

1031
01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:36.410
So there you go.
That's what you walked away from.
Um,

1032
01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:39.320
but as far as like,
you know,

1033
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:41.870
at this point you want to move and start over at all,

1034
01:01:41.871 --> 01:01:46.100
depends on what you got going on in your town.
That's a pretty a big move.

1035
01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:51.500
Uh,
you know what a few days go by.
See if you feel that again,
it just,

1036
01:01:51.501 --> 01:01:51.960
I don't know,

1037
01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:55.070
just really focused on the type of person that would do something like that.

1038
01:01:55.071 --> 01:01:57.500
So to really just go out of your way to hurt somebody and I said,

1039
01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.560
I've heard a bunch of people in my life but to like go out of your fucking way.

1040
01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:03.530
Like that's like the debts,

1041
01:02:03.531 --> 01:02:07.700
like the difference between first degree and second degree continuous there,

1042
01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:11.930
whereas,
you know,
second degree it's just spontaneously happens.
You know,

1043
01:02:11.931 --> 01:02:15.260
you guys got all this history and he just says something fucking horrible or

1044
01:02:15.261 --> 01:02:17.180
stuff's chatting up some shit there at the bar,

1045
01:02:17.181 --> 01:02:20.640
but to fucking sit there and like methodically plan it out like that,

1046
01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.820
that guy's a fucking psycho.
And again,

1047
01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:27.600
congratulations to you that he's done in your fucking life anymore.
Um,

1048
01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:34.080
yeah.
And don't fuck with this food.
That's a petty thing too.
That's bad.
Con,

1049
01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:36.480
