76
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.690
<v Speaker 1>AM flight and the only way there's two </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways to handle a 7:00</v>

77
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>AM flight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is going to involve like a fucking</v>

78
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 1>4:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM pickup.</v>

79
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.430
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>

80
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.500
<v Speaker 1>There's only two ways to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You either go to bed,</v>

81
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.410
<v Speaker 1>you know you drink some hot cocoa at </v>
<v Speaker 1>7:00</v>

82
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.230
<v Speaker 1>PM and you figure out how you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get your fucking eight hours.</v>

83
00:03:46.231 --> 00:03:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do people do with your pills?</v>

84
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you do when you sit fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian style 40th bed going,</v>

85
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.993
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

86
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.480
<v Speaker 3>Oh</v>

87
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever's whatever that meditation shit</v>

88
00:03:59.411 --> 00:03:59.941
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

89
00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:00.774
<v Speaker 1>Which I have not done and I'll tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ramifications of that here in a </v>

90
00:04:03.271 --> 00:04:04.104
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you either do that or you just stay </v>

91
00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:09.030
<v Speaker 1>out drinking with your friends to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>2:30</v>

92
00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:11.970
<v Speaker 1>in the morning and then you come home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get about an hour and a half,</v>

93
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.900
<v Speaker 1>two hours sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You staggered to the fucking airport,</v>

94
00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:19.080
<v Speaker 1>whatever out to the cab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go in there and you just do.</v>

95
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.690
<v Speaker 1>The biggest thing is not to nod off at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gate,</v>

96
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.553
<v Speaker 1>you got to stay awake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the lights are on and that type of </v>

97
00:04:24.691 --> 00:04:26.910
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once you get to your seat,</v>

98
00:04:26.911 --> 00:04:27.930
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're out.</v>

99
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.910
<v Speaker 1>You're out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see,</v>

100
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:30.743
<v Speaker 1>let's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a great way to do it because </v>

101
00:04:31.801 --> 00:04:33.930
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have to sit there bored </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of your mind on the flight,</v>

102
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.713
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103

<v Speaker 1>in which for some dumb reason,</v>

105

<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting there watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the tail section coming off this </v>

106

107
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.440
<v Speaker 1>fucking way to try to land it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course you can at that point,</v>

108
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.853
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't surprised that they didn't </v>

109
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.770
<v Speaker 1>invert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always a fun thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

191
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like a navel ring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's on your Dick.</v>

<v Speaker 1>for some reason.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

240
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:48.414
<v Speaker 1>when they have one Atari for $3,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way in the back of the store and </v>

00:10:51.991 --> 00:10:54.300
<v Speaker 1>everybody's just basically going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trample people.</v>

242
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.163

246
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:02.994

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.753

<v Speaker 1>Giant selections.</v>

249
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I've gone in there a bunch of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I brought that up.</v>

250
00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:14.520
<v Speaker 1>I still knew what the fuck I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this point o t j Maxx,</v>

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.530
<v Speaker 1>So I go in there and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

253
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 1>typical Manhattan fucking store where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like half the stores downstairs and</v>

254
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:26.364
<v Speaker 1>the oldest in is on the ground floor on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other is like upstairs because they </v>

255
00:11:30.091 --> 00:11:31.980
<v Speaker 1>slammed this little fucking store in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there</v>

256
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:33.813
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

257
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:39.200
<v Speaker 1>finally find some underwears and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

258
00:11:39.201 --> 00:11:40.034
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta stand in this God damn like </v>

259
00:11:41.361 --> 00:11:42.860

<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

260
00:11:42.861 --> 00:11:44.810
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got 12 fucking registers open.</v>

261
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.520
<v Speaker 1>So even though there's like 24 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

262
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:49.873
<v Speaker 1>roughly each one of these cashiers just </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocks out to people and then it's my </v>

263
00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Speaker 1>turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

264
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.420
<v Speaker 1>this shouldn't be this bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was this woman in front of me.</v>

265
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what kind of soap she used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I would divorce her.</v>

266
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.090
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if she made my heart stop,</v>

267
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>

268
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I wish nothing for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this fucking soap.</v>

269
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a specific soap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've smelled it before.</v>

270
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:14.560
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't smell bad,</v>

271
00:12:14.561 --> 00:12:17.260
<v Speaker 1>she smelled of this soap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck it is,</v>

272
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.000
<v Speaker 1>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

273
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:19.834
<v Speaker 1>I can't be around it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had to be around someone who's </v>

274
00:12:21.301 --> 00:12:24.310
<v Speaker 1>going to cut me and then they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked you through,</v>

275
00:12:24.311 --> 00:12:25.144
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Disneyland thing where you walk all </v>

276
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 1>the way to the right.</v>

277
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Then you go back to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

278
00:12:27.761 --> 00:12:28.594
<v Speaker 1>zig zag and all the way up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just the shit that they had the </v>

279
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:37.030
<v Speaker 1>impulse buys in everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they weren't staring at their fucking</v>

280
00:12:37.031 --> 00:12:39.490
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just pick it up.</v>

281
00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:42.910
<v Speaker 1>These things and the more I saw people </v>
<v Speaker 1>picking up this shit,</v>

282
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:44.800
<v Speaker 1>looking at it like the angrier I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>

283
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:46.900
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you picking that up?</v>

284
00:12:46.901 --> 00:12:50.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't need that when you find you </v>
<v Speaker 1>the names of these fucking things.</v>

285
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:52.263
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had this one thing that said I </v>

286
00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:55.600
<v Speaker 1>would thank you from the bottom of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>

287
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.513
<v Speaker 1>but for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my heart has no bottom and it was just </v>

288
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:06.160
<v Speaker 1>framed in this piece of shit frame and </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a white piece of paper,</v>

289
00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:06.994
<v Speaker 1>which is regular font,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like please don't walk away with the </v>

290

<v Speaker 1>like the same kind of font.</v>

291
00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:14.620
<v Speaker 1>You would use the data at the gas </v>
<v Speaker 1>station.</v>

292
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.350
<v Speaker 1>They wrote that fucking cheesy heartfelt</v>
<v Speaker 1>message.</v>

293
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:22.000
<v Speaker 1>And what the fuck was the next one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

294
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:26.690
<v Speaker 1>it was just some sort of like coconut </v>
<v Speaker 1>almonds,</v>

295
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.170
<v Speaker 1>yummy clusters or something was called </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

296
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.570
<v Speaker 1>And that's how I was able to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

297
00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.080
<v Speaker 1>this is the demographic I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

298
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.350
<v Speaker 1>let's become Fed Fox and talk about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>we love each other.</v>

299
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get the underwear and I fucking get</v>

300
00:13:39.921 --> 00:13:40.754
<v Speaker 1>back to the hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I realized in my looking down at </v>

301
00:13:43.011 --> 00:13:45.590
<v Speaker 1>everybody in Tj Maxx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot to get socks.</v>

302
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.380
<v Speaker 1>So I had to go back to the gay store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

303
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:50.860
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

304
00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.753
<v Speaker 1>I come walking into the store and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same dudes behind the counter and I was </v>

305
00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:54.581
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

306

<v Speaker 1>you got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sell socks here,</v>

307
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because all he had was white socks.</v>

308
00:13:59.281 --> 00:14:00.114
<v Speaker 1>I was going to sit down at church and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were going to come up and they're </v>

309
00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:01.840
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ankles,</v>

310
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.710
<v Speaker 1>like Nikes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socks.</v>

311
00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna wear with like fucking wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>tips.</v>

312
00:14:04.271 --> 00:14:07.300
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they actually had regular socks.</v>

313
00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.130
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I learned at the gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

314
00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:09.964
<v Speaker 1>They just had regular Nike socks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for some reason the tag on him took </v>

315
00:14:15.971 --> 00:14:17.650
<v Speaker 1>a picture of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to send this,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

317
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tweet this out or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tag on the socks just said,</v>

318
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:23.560
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I guess woman or maybe a guy in drag </v>
<v Speaker 1>with his face all twisted up.</v>

320
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.110
<v Speaker 1>I got on bitch please socks by Nike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

321

<v Speaker 1>These are made for gay feet.</v>

322
00:14:36.761 --> 00:14:40.030
<v Speaker 1>But for some reason they seem to fit </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind just just fine.</v>

323
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

324
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.313
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned earlier that I hadn't been </v>

325
00:14:45.281 --> 00:14:48.850
<v Speaker 1>meditating and it came to a head so to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>

326
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.950
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember when I was bitching,</v>

327
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.003
<v Speaker 1>updating my fucking phone and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to update my laptop and there's </v>

328
00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:55.694
<v Speaker 1>no one to call and I'm typing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right passwords and the two are not in </v>

329
00:14:58.101 --> 00:14:58.934
<v Speaker 1>sync and I don't know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I finally had a meltdown and my laptop </v>

330
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:09.431
<v Speaker 1>was closed and I took my phone and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just fucking slammed it down like corner</v>

331
00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:14.530
<v Speaker 1>first onto my laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

332
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.750
<v Speaker 1>somewhere between a jab in an overhand </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

333
00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:20.930
<v Speaker 1>But it was a stabbing motion and a,</v>

334
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.413
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what.</v>

335
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Then I fucking opened my laptop and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen was broken.</v>

336
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.150
<v Speaker 1>So my question I have for you guys</v>

337
00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.700

<v Speaker 1>do I need anger management?</v>

338
00:15:32.701 --> 00:15:34.220

<v Speaker 1>screen?</v>

340
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.950
<v Speaker 1>You could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the hard drive.</v>

341
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.950
<v Speaker 1>There was no water get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just take that out.</v>

342
00:15:40.951 --> 00:15:42.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like I got a broken windshield on </v>
<v Speaker 1>my laptop.</v>

<v Speaker 1>can they do that?</v>

344
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to find out because once again</v>

345
00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:47.904
<v Speaker 1>I didn't back up anything there and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just really thinking back anything </v>

346
00:15:50.011 --> 00:15:52.650
<v Speaker 1>up and I didn't back anything up my </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone when I dropped it in the toilet.</v>

347
00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:56.310
<v Speaker 1>But do I miss any of that data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>data,</v>

348
00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.490
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck you say it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>

365
00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:51.950
<v Speaker 1>twice and I was on the road and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to see,</v>

366
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get to hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

367
00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm hanging out with her all day today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

368
00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:02.120
<v Speaker 1>other than the benefit I have to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight and I'm really like psyched.</v>

369
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Like I came home and of course dropped </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and picked her up and um,</v>

370
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.660
<v Speaker 1>she just smiled for like three minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight,</v>

371
00:17:10.661 --> 00:17:11.494
<v Speaker 1>which was amazing and I could tell she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was getting sleepy and I can read her </v>

372
00:17:14.741 --> 00:17:15.574
<v Speaker 1>body language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was on the floor and she started </v>

373
00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:18.070
<v Speaker 1>doing this thing like she's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit up.</v>

374
00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:18.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

375
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:19.323
<v Speaker 1>she wants to get up and I just put her </v>
<v Speaker 1>on my lap and we were watching these </v>

376
00:17:23.891 --> 00:17:26.440
<v Speaker 1>people in Maine rebuilding cabins or </v>
<v Speaker 1>some shit.</v>

377
00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.100
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt there start to slump,</v>

378
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:30.993
<v Speaker 1>slumped to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that she was falling asleep and </v>

379
00:17:33.821 --> 00:17:35.110
<v Speaker 1>she was asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which as I was like,</v>

380
00:17:35.111 --> 00:17:37.030
<v Speaker 1>this is a perfect time to do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

381
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.490
<v Speaker 1>but felt so awesome her just laying </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

382
00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:40.324
<v Speaker 1>Then I stayed there for like another 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes and I'm kind of breaking down </v>

383
00:17:44.741 --> 00:17:48.040
<v Speaker 1>parenting into just like sections where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

384
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 1>like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

385
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.700
<v Speaker 1>I got 18 years with her before she goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>off to college.</v>

386
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.520
<v Speaker 1>God willing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how many months is that?</v>

387
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:57.563
<v Speaker 1>I just did three of them and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other big countdown is the first three </v>

388
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:01.164
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first three years all I have to </v>

389
00:18:03.721 --> 00:18:08.721
<v Speaker 1>do is just fill her up with love support</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I do lose my temper because I'm</v>

390
00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:11.724
<v Speaker 1>going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to apologize to her and ask </v>

391
00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:18.000
<v Speaker 1>her to help me work on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's not like necessarily afraid,</v>

392
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:19.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

393
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I got to kill this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

394
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.390
<v Speaker 1>this aspect of my family tree because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else is pretty,</v>

395
00:18:24.391 --> 00:18:25.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

396
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.003
<v Speaker 1>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't want to be the guy stabbing </v>

397
00:18:28.261 --> 00:18:31.290
<v Speaker 1>his fucking laptop with this phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freaking is cut out.</v>

398
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Do I do know who wants to be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person?</v>

399
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.400
<v Speaker 1>And you laying on your death bed one day</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they come walking in Pekin instill,</v>

400
00:18:38.401 --> 00:18:40.110
<v Speaker 1>nervous to be around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just be like,</v>

401
00:18:40.111 --> 00:18:40.944
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

402
00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:45.690
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Back to,</v>

403
00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm,</v>

404
00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hanging out with her all day today,</v>

405
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:55.480
<v Speaker 1>reading books and the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've also decided like,</v>

406
00:18:55.481 --> 00:18:56.314
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I still gotta do my two weekends a </v>

407
00:18:57.311 --> 00:18:59.830
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those will be like six days.</v>

408
00:18:59.831 --> 00:19:03.670
<v Speaker 1>I won't see her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll actually see her more than if I</v>

409
00:19:03.671 --> 00:19:04.504
<v Speaker 1>had like a nine to five because then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can come home and just totally focused </v>

410
00:19:07.091 --> 00:19:08.800
<v Speaker 1>on her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

411
00:19:08.801 --> 00:19:11.980
<v Speaker 1>for the next 10 days before I go out on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>

412
00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:13.210
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

413
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.270
<v Speaker 1>and every person that's apparent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all say it goes by so fast,</v>

414
00:19:16.271 --> 00:19:17.104
<v Speaker 1>it goes by so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just keep thinking that every </v>

415
00:19:18.551 --> 00:19:22.330
<v Speaker 1>fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm every day.</v>

417
00:19:23.351 --> 00:19:25.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully I don't fuck this up,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know I'm a mess so I'm differently.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's a comedy hero.</v>

446
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.183
<v Speaker 1>A regular on the daily show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got standup specials on HBO and </v>

447
00:20:49.001 --> 00:20:52.870

<v Speaker 1>connecting everyday on social media.</v>

449
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.940
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time I saw Louis </v>
<v Speaker 1>Black,</v>

450
00:21:00.941 --> 00:21:04.330
<v Speaker 1>I saw him at the comedy cellar right </v>
<v Speaker 1>before he blew up.</v>

451
00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:07.570
<v Speaker 1>He was about my age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little younger,</v>

452
00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:09.010
<v Speaker 1>about 45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>46,</v>

453
00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:14.011
<v Speaker 1>and it was one of those fucking hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutally hot summer days</v>

454
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.473
<v Speaker 1>in La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he came and still wearing his sport </v>

455
00:21:18.731 --> 00:21:20.530
<v Speaker 1>coat and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was just like,</v>

456
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.960
<v Speaker 1>miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

457
00:21:22.961 --> 00:21:26.020
<v Speaker 1>He already walks around with a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of agitation,</v>

458
00:21:26.021 --> 00:21:29.620
<v Speaker 1>which I could totally relate to is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember I said I walk around at a six,</v>

459
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.280
<v Speaker 1>so going up to 10 isn't that quick of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ride.</v>

460
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:37.900
<v Speaker 1>So Louis came in and there was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody in the fucking club.</v>

461
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.180
<v Speaker 1>It was like the mid nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like [inaudible] 95,</v>

462
00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:43.510
<v Speaker 1>96 and comedy was still dealing with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties hangover,</v>

463
00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:48.010
<v Speaker 1>still waiting to make another comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he goes in there in front of like</v>

464
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.160
<v Speaker 1>three fucking people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>once you get up to like three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>400 viewings of it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>denny live from philly and I remember </v>

533
00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:19.660
<v Speaker 1>when he was doing this white guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>denny's,</v>

534
00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.040
<v Speaker 1>a black dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's doing this white guy and the way</v>

535
00:25:22.041 --> 00:25:26.240
<v Speaker 1>he was doing the cadence and the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the guy was talking was,</v>

536
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:27.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like sort of at the height of </v>

537
00:25:29.691 --> 00:25:33.220
<v Speaker 1>the fallout of the hacky white guy like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

538
00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.670

539
00:25:34.671 --> 00:25:37.730
<v Speaker 1>like that fucking thing.</v>

540
00:25:37.731 --> 00:25:38.564
<v Speaker 1>white guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an impression that I couldn't even </v>

541
00:25:40.971 --> 00:25:41.804

597
00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:19.363

598
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.190
<v Speaker 1>the CBI was just above fucking truckers.</v>

599
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Kris Kristofferson was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in it.</v>

600
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.290
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ernest Borgnine was,</v>

601
00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.070
<v Speaker 1>was the state trooper up there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>helicopter.</v>

602
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:32.933
<v Speaker 1>Convoy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember they were trying to get </v>

603
00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:38.960
<v Speaker 1>this fucking convoy of trucks to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop driving.</v>

604
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:41.220
<v Speaker 1>It was like vanishing point with like </v>
<v Speaker 1>70,</v>

605
00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.770
<v Speaker 1>72,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking 18 wheelers.</v>

606
00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.350
<v Speaker 1>They just weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't stopping for nothing,</v>

607
00:28:46.351 --> 00:28:47.850
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just out there and you're just</v>

608
00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:48.684
<v Speaker 1>gonna keep on driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these cops were trying to stop them </v>

609
00:28:51.151 --> 00:28:53.670
<v Speaker 1>and they for some reason couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now Ernest Borgnine,</v>

610
00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:54.563
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of the go between between truckers </v>

611
00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:58.110
<v Speaker 1>and cops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he understands them.</v>

612
00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:00.810
<v Speaker 1>So there's some cut up in the elevator </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

613
00:29:00.811 --> 00:29:02.360

<v Speaker 1>helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really don't have a gun turret or </v>

00:29:07.591 --> 00:29:08.424
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're watching you so you better be </v>

<v Speaker 1>this fucking helicopter.</v>

619
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.710
<v Speaker 1>So Ernest Borgnine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just shakes his head.</v>

620
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:18.690
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ain't going to listen to that.</v>

621
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.810

<v Speaker 1>they got a language all their own.</v>

623
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.250
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes to talk to them down </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

624
00:29:26.251 --> 00:29:30.200
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the bear in the air.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We've lost three games straight to the </v>

762
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Ottawa senators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

764
00:36:36.331 --> 00:36:39.430
<v Speaker 1>I was at the memorial service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I definitely watched game two,</v>

765
00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.293
<v Speaker 1>game three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And although we had a furious got back </v>

766
00:36:43.021 --> 00:36:44.770
<v Speaker 1>and [inaudible] three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not enough.</v>

767
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:49.750
<v Speaker 1>I was actually in the north end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the cigar bar smoking his stogy,</v>

768
00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:54.320
<v Speaker 1>hoping it was going to be a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a fuck.</v>

769
00:36:54.321 --> 00:36:56.950
<v Speaker 1>And that was a great goal though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And overtime they'll give and go,</v>

770
00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.530
<v Speaker 1>got to admit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

771
00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:00.423
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno if they'd just been out playing </v>

772
00:37:03.101 --> 00:37:04.810
<v Speaker 1>us and they deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

00:37:04.811 --> 00:37:08.950
<v Speaker 1>granted it was a shit call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's going to be shit calls.</v>

774
00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:11.870
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

775
00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:12.843
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

778
00:37:17.491 --> 00:37:18.324
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

779
00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:22.530
<v Speaker 1>you can only look in the mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see what happens.</v>

780
00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:23.453
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the excitement of the bruins making the </v>

781
00:37:26.071 --> 00:37:26.904
<v Speaker 1>playoffs is quickly subsiding here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see them win a series </v>

782
00:37:30.631 --> 00:37:31.464
<v Speaker 1>and now they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get their fucking backs up against </v>

783
00:37:34.501 --> 00:37:35.490
<v Speaker 1>the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see.</v>

784
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:38.250
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see when game five comes up.</v>

785
00:37:38.251 --> 00:37:39.870
<v Speaker 1>I imagined tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

786
00:37:39.871 --> 00:37:42.090
<v Speaker 1>And then the celtics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

787
00:37:42.091 --> 00:37:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Celtics have been completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed.</v>

788
00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.270
<v Speaker 1>I know that that's probably been said a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand times.</v>

789
00:37:48.271 --> 00:37:51.360
<v Speaker 1>You know what's funny is when I first </v>
<v Speaker 1>got back into the NBA,</v>

790
00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:52.763
<v Speaker 1>which I got back into it because Paul </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] was coming out here and he </v>

791
00:37:55.411 --> 00:37:57.150
<v Speaker 1>loves the NBA and he was staying with </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

792
00:37:57.151 --> 00:38:01.740
<v Speaker 1>him and his lovely wife staying with me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and my lovely wife for like four or five</v>

793
00:38:01.741 --> 00:38:02.574
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

794
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:05.430
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a hell of a host or what a host,</v>

795
00:38:05.431 --> 00:38:06.264
<v Speaker 1>what host,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

796
00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:07.470
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

797
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:08.363
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

798
00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.400
<v Speaker 1>he's coming to town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to get some johnny blue.</v>

799
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:14.370
<v Speaker 1>I got to get the NBA package so he can </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch his Nixon.</v>

800
00:38:14.371 --> 00:38:15.204
<v Speaker 1>I just got into the Celtics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've been watching them since </v>

801
00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:21.870
<v Speaker 1>December of 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my first thought when I was watching</v>

802
00:38:21.871 --> 00:38:22.590
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

803
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:24.540
<v Speaker 1>where are we going to go with this game </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan?</v>

804
00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Where we have this super superstar point</v>
<v Speaker 1>guard,</v>

805
00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:31.610
<v Speaker 1>we live and die by the three and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get any fucking rebound,</v>

806
00:38:31.611 --> 00:38:33.690
<v Speaker 1>so like I don't understand how you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>win</v>

807
00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:36.370
<v Speaker 5>anything</v>

808
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.070
<v Speaker 1>playing basketball like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then here's what happened.</v>

809
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.540
<v Speaker 1>They did and they just kept winning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else,</v>

810
00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:44.523
<v Speaker 1>it just became socially acceptable on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hard court to fucking run down the </v>

811
00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:53.020
<v Speaker 1>court with the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three people</v>

812
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:58.060
<v Speaker 1>from the other team onto the net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody on your team or maybe one guy.</v>

813
00:38:58.061 --> 00:38:58.894
<v Speaker 1>It was totally acceptable to say I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for my other teammates and I'm </v>

814
00:39:01.351 --> 00:39:04.230
<v Speaker 1>just going to launch a fucking three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

815
00:39:04.231 --> 00:39:06.900
<v Speaker 1>and we're up by one with like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight minutes to go like,</v>

816
00:39:06.901 --> 00:39:09.180
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that just,</v>

817
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:12.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way after Jordan,</v>

818
00:39:12.601 --> 00:39:14.730
<v Speaker 1>people were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I guess we don't need to feed it to</v>

819
00:39:14.731 --> 00:39:15.590
<v Speaker 1>a big man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

820
00:39:15.591 --> 00:39:17.020
<v Speaker 1>We even need a big man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>randy,</v>

821
00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:17.881
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

822
00:39:17.881 --> 00:39:19.440
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess this is the new game.</v>

823
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:24.300
<v Speaker 1>So we ended up not only doing great this</v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

824
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:25.463
<v Speaker 1>once we added Al Horford yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fucking got the number one seat and </v>

825
00:39:30.421 --> 00:39:34.740
<v Speaker 1>at that point I completely forgot about </v>
<v Speaker 1>my initial reaction to the way that they</v>

826
00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:36.720
<v Speaker 1>were playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

827
00:39:36.721 --> 00:39:37.560
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

828
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the number one.</v>

829
00:39:40.351 --> 00:39:42.030
<v Speaker 1>See we get an eight seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

830
00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:47.000
<v Speaker 1>And after the first two games it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

831
00:39:47.001 --> 00:39:47.834
<v Speaker 1>it seems like the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like they're the number one seed </v>

832
00:39:49.461 --> 00:39:52.520
<v Speaker 1>and where the eight seat and I kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew we were in trouble.</v>

833
00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:54.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

834
00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:59.190
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well when Charles Barkley just basically</v>

835
00:39:59.191 --> 00:40:03.060
<v Speaker 1>broke our team down after the first half</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the first game going,</v>

836
00:40:03.061 --> 00:40:03.894
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just basically you double team </v>

837
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:06.023
<v Speaker 1>Isaiah tried to make a beat the double </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if these guys don't hit their </v>

838
00:40:08.371 --> 00:40:10.200
<v Speaker 1>threes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

839
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:11.970
<v Speaker 1>they're not getting any fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the hell he said,</v>

840
00:40:11.971 --> 00:40:12.900
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

841
00:40:12.901 --> 00:40:13.734
<v Speaker 1>this guy's already figured this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically what I'm saying is I think </v>

842
00:40:18.181 --> 00:40:20.280
<v Speaker 1>this is the first real test for Brad </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stevens,</v>

843
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:25.230
<v Speaker 1>this next game where he has to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drastic adjustment with the players that</v>

844
00:40:25.231 --> 00:40:26.064
<v Speaker 1>he has because they figured this out </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the opening tip off and that has </v>

845
00:40:31.321 --> 00:40:34.920
<v Speaker 1>led to two losses and we have not been </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to make any adjustment.</v>

846
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:36.743
<v Speaker 1>And what's fascinating about the bowls </v>
<v Speaker 1>is even though that they're an eighth </v>

847
00:40:39.811 --> 00:40:40.644
<v Speaker 1>seed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got Rondo and they got Dwayne Wade </v>

848
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.480
<v Speaker 1>and Rondo's got a ring and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne Wade,</v>

849
00:40:45.481 --> 00:40:46.020
<v Speaker 1>he's got what?</v>

850
00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:46.853
<v Speaker 1>Three rings for rings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He won one was shack and then two with </v>

851
00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Lebron three with Lebron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

852
00:40:53.041 --> 00:40:54.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a big NBA guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got at least three rings,</v>

853
00:40:54.841 --> 00:40:59.700
<v Speaker 1>so there's four rings right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys have been through it numerous</v>

854
00:40:59.701 --> 00:41:00.534
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're not afraid of the ebbs and </v>

855
00:41:03.721 --> 00:41:04.554
<v Speaker 1>flows of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not afraid of playing on the </v>

856
00:41:06.121 --> 00:41:06.954
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had just totally chill and I think </v>

857
00:41:09.691 --> 00:41:10.524
<v Speaker 1>that affects the rest of the team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he got Butler and Lopez who </v>

858
00:41:13.201 --> 00:41:18.201
<v Speaker 1>have just fucking animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just hitting 12 foot jump shots,</v>

859
00:41:19.471 --> 00:41:21.780
<v Speaker 1>15 photos while getting all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebounds.</v>

860
00:41:21.781 --> 00:41:23.880
<v Speaker 1>And then that fucking white dude from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

861
00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:25.523
<v Speaker 1>Vlade Divac Junior Jr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking started hitting threes and </v>

862
00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:33.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting asses kicked.</v>

863
00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:34.610
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

864
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:38.370
<v Speaker 2>I'll see wHat happens if you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

865
00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:40.893
<v Speaker 1>jesus christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we were down three to one in </v>

866
00:41:42.551 --> 00:41:43.750
<v Speaker 1>hockey and went down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

867
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:47.710
<v Speaker 1>to going out to chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm hoping.</v>

868
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.863
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

869
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we don't get fucking swept.</v>

870
00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:53.553
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

871
00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:55.910
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brutal,</v>

872
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:56.451
<v Speaker 1>brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal.</v>

873
00:41:56.451 --> 00:41:57.840
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you gonna do with him?</v>

874
00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:58.933
<v Speaker 1>It's just a fucking game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized that if the first one when </v>

875
00:42:00.801 --> 00:42:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

876
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:06.890
<v Speaker 1>isaiah thomas crying about losing his </v>
<v Speaker 1>sister was really a brutal week for that</v>

877
00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:09.830
<v Speaker 1>type of shitter than Aaron Hernandez </v>
<v Speaker 1>hung himself.</v>

878
00:42:09.831 --> 00:42:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was fucking brutal.</v>

879
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:12.103
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all those fucking jokes that </v>

880
00:42:14.361 --> 00:42:17.020
<v Speaker 1>people were making like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

881
00:42:17.021 --> 00:42:17.854
<v Speaker 1>he got hung up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got an upper body injury to the </v>

882
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:22.570
<v Speaker 1>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

883
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:27.640
<v Speaker 1>this dumb shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit to me is always weird.</v>

884
00:42:27.861 --> 00:42:28.521
<v Speaker 1>Where are you going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

885
00:42:28.521 --> 00:42:31.100
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking piece of shit.</v>

886
00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:36.020
<v Speaker 1>And then everybody acts like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal when he kills himself.</v>

887
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:37.793
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

888
00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.290
<v Speaker 1>of course there's people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think,</v>

889
00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else happened.</v>

890
00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:42.661
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

891
00:42:42.661 --> 00:42:43.494
<v Speaker 1>you got just got acquitted on those </v>
<v Speaker 1>other two murders and then you had a </v>

892
00:42:46.171 --> 00:42:48.990
<v Speaker 1>good chance for an appeal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

893
00:42:48.991 --> 00:42:50.950
<v Speaker 1>you had some hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

894
00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:54.360
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know who the fuck knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck happened.</v>

895
00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily agree with that or </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree.</v>

896
00:42:56.371 --> 00:42:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I have no fucking idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do know was,</v>

897
00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.200
<v Speaker 1>I think you've already sort of a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>

898
00:43:01.201 --> 00:43:04.880
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was just sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

899
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:05.833
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

900

<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Granted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

903

<v Speaker 1>and everything like that,</v>
