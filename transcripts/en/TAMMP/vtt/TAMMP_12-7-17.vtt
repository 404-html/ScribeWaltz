00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.820
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn is time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.821 --> 00:00:08.330
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast and ah,

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.120
just checking again.
Oh,

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.030
can't,
how are you?
What's going on?
Jesus Christ.
I wrote my little notes area.

5
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.370
We'll collect collect ticks instead of Celtics.
Huh?
Oh fuck.

6
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:25.760
There's another helicopter flying over.
I am out here in Los Angeles.

7
00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:27.620
Los Angeles is on fire.

8
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.950
That's all everybody's talking about.
Oh my God.
Are you okay?

9
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.470
Are you anywhere near the fire?
I am fine.

10
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.170
I am fine.
I have not had to evacuate yet.
I have a,

11
00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:45.620
I've driven past the fires.
It's just,
it's just what happens out here.

12
00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:49.190
Plus a global warming is the issue.

13
00:00:49.191 --> 00:00:53.990
Earlier this year we had unseasonably high rains in the hills,
turned green.

14
00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:55.370
It looked like fucking Portland,

15
00:00:55.371 --> 00:01:00.110
Oregon and the fucking dumb ass mayor out his leg.
The drought is over,

16
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.070
so everybody goes back to water and they're fucking lawns and it's just like the

17
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:05.450
drought has never over out here.

18
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.130
It's over fucking populated and we live in a place that should not exist.
Okay.

19
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.530
That is such a fucking irresponsible statement.

20
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.960
We have enough water now where there isn't a drought,

21
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.840
but please conserve it because we don't know when it's gonna rain like that

22
00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:21.440
again.
Thank you.
And it's,
you know,
it's on to Chicago and let's win there.

23
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.780
That's what the fuck she should have said.
Oh Hey,

24
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.090
I don't know what the fuck it was.
Right.

25
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.150
So all it did was just fatten up the fucking land said always burned out here.

26
00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:36.470
Anyways,
so Santa Ana,
when z come in after my Javvi desert over there,

27
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.390
it's like a giant fucking hair dryer.

28
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.290
It dries out the fucking they'll fuck in the hills and it lights on fire.

29
00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:43.670
But the problem is,
is people live there now.

30
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.010
So then that's when it becomes a problem.

31
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.920
<v 2>Mike.
Oh,
are gone.
How are they going to get their fucking Prius out of air?</v>

32
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.510
<v 1>Um,
by the way,
I love all the people playing like politics,
you know,</v>

33
00:01:56.511 --> 00:01:59.420
going good.
All those fucking liberals are burning out there.
It's a,

34
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.990
La is one of the most conservative fucking places you're ever going to live in

35
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.900
this second.
She get into the valley,
just get out of there.

36
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.230
Get out of Hollywood with all these starlets solving problems as they accept a

37
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:14.030
fucking award.
You know,

38
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.120
<v 2>let's not forget about the fucking planet puts his in the cove next to the blood</v>

39
00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:24.380
diamonds.
Thank you so much.
This one's for all the fat bitches,
right,
right.

40
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.540
<v 1>Whatever the fuck it is.
They say,
you know,</v>

41
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.080
before they jump in their limo back to their fucking gated community outside,

42
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.890
outside,
you just go to Burbank and they're making it great again.

43
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.330
All right.
And first of all,
what kind of a fucking ass hole?

44
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:42.960
Watch his fellow Americans houses burn down,
you know,

45
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.310
and they actually are happy about it.
You know what I mean?

46
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.930
This is how fucked up like,

47
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.490
<v 0>okay,</v>

48
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.090
<v 1>like politics has become an a in this,
in this goddamn country.
However,</v>

49
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:58.680
I feel like Hollywood did bring it on themselves with their fucking finger
wagon.

50
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.770
You know,
I told you that fucking jerk off.
So this guy in Twitter and he goes,

51
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:07.450
okay,
in case you didn't take your smart pills today,
um,
Obama is awesome.

52
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.960
It's just like,
what?
Like,

53
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
how dumb are you that that's how you'd present your point as opposed to me who

54
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:18.610
just calls everybody comes,
he should do it the way that I do it.
So anyways,
I'm

55
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.650
watching all of this shit happen and knowing that,
you know,

56
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.540
and I believe anyways that we are playing a major role in it is really

57
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:33.370
depressing.
But I've,
I've now I've got myself into a positive mindset about it.

58
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:37.750
I just think they think they're going to look at like the last hundred years

59
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.870
is just this
period in our history where we were wrong.

60
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.450
It's not wrong with oil.

61
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:49.040
We didn't fucking realize that it was going to do all of this shit.

62
00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:52.210
But now we know and I think that's getting in the future.

63
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.650
I think that we're going to,
hopefully we'll utilize solar power,
wind,

64
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.240
uh,
water,
whatever the fuck it is that these egg heads know how to use.
I mean,

65
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.660
I show,
I saw that flashlight the other day.
It just runs on water.
I mean,
we,

66
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.250
we can do stuff like this and we can live happily.
All right,

67
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:12.340
we don't need to cut beaks off chickens.
You know,

68
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:17.050
I think in every period,
like when you look at how we get to live right now,

69
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.980
it's fucking amazing.

70
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.880
And even still how we treat each other is amazing compared to way we did it for

71
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.240
500 years ago.
Well,

72
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:28.720
eventually there's going to be four or 500 years beyond this and they're going

73
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:29.560
to be looking at us like that.

74
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.560
We were barbarians and they were spraying on let it feel until the atmosphere

75
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.770
was hating on the positives were Burdick data.
They bought chickens.
Right?

76
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.061
You know,

77
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:42.850
as we sit there thinking we're fucking amazing because we can take a pill that

78
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:46.810
makes her dick stand up even though we're 85.
Um,

79
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.530
so I think we're going to come out of it.
I think,
uh,

80
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.540
what has to happen is to solar people have to start paying off politicians the

81
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:58.600
way the oil people do.
And once that happens,

82
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.130
then hopefully what will happen is the same thing that happened in my business

83
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:06.970
where I watched everybody being at the big three networks all of a sudden

84
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:11.500
wanting to be over it.
And Netflix.
So if you look at the big three,

85
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:15.910
like NBC,
ABC,
and CBS is,
you know,
the oil companies,

86
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.180
hopefully everybody will jump over to like solar stuff.

87
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.770
And I know people are saying,
well,
you know,

88
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:23.800
you need flicking junior age and getting me,
keep looking for,
look into it.

89
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:24.670
I know,
I realize that.

90
00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:29.380
I realize that there's always going to be some sort of lubricant.
Um,

91
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.460
I understand that.
But you know,
have you seen that,
that,

92
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.630
that fucking shit that Tesla guy came out with where they got the,
they got the,

93
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:37.750
uh,
the roof tiles that are solar.
I don't know if they work yet.

94
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.540
I don't know if he can even fucking get it.
But if those things fucking work,

95
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:42.880
and I mean,
there's a thing,

96
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.300
there's a thing that blow $1 billion a month on,

97
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.690
right as it Plos post of fly in f eighteens trying to find fucking people with a

98
00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:55.270
little bag of dynamite and some nails in it.

99
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.650
Those little cock suckers over there.
Man,
they're fucking bankrupt in us

100
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.540
running around with a little trick or treat bag and we'll fucking sick sending

101
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:08.030
$1 billion worth a shit at him every fucking month.

102
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.640
They're never going to defeat us in that game.

103
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.120
They're going to kill this fucking financially.
That's it.

104
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.460
I'm off my tree stump that just burned down.

105
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.550
One of the great things about spending a lot of time alone is nobody debates the

106
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:24.860
points you're making.
So you always feel like you're right.

107
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.420
And that's what I'm doing right now.
Um,
please by all means,

108
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:31.940
don't take any of this shit seriously.
Alright,
I'm just fucking around.

109
00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:35.000
I talk about what's in the news.
Okay?

110
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.150
Don't get your red tie or your blue tie and your fucking panties in a bunch.

111
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.260
All right.
Grow the fuck up.

112
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.300
Um,
hey,

113
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.890
what's going on this weekend on the fucking La Rams?

114
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.880
The who would have thought La fucking rams.
What are the 92,
10 and two?

115
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:58.190
I don't know where the fuck were you armed?
Too busy editing.

116
00:06:58.191 --> 00:07:02.420
The third season of F is for family.
Um,
I dunno where the hell we are.
God Damn,

117
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.231
it's already December.

118
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:07.640
Can you believe that the regular season of football is almost over?

119
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.900
The regular season of college football is already over.

120
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.770
We're already into the bowl season.

121
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:20.771
It's just unfucking believable how fast the football season goes by September,

122
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.380
October,
November,
December.
And if you look at baseball,
that's April,
May,
June,

123
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.990
July.
Well,
no wonder they still play September.
We've also,

124
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.330
they still play September,
August,

125
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:36.440
September and into October and into fucking November.
Oh,
there you go.

126
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.380
Unfucking believable.
Um,
well they can say plaintiff February hearing,

127
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.890
who knows.
Anyways,
um,
I was actually going to have time next week to,

128
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:52.040
uh,
start flying again.
The helicopter.

129
00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:55.100
I was going to try to get up to 150 hours by the end of the year.

130
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.390
And I had this flight I wanted to do from long beach up to Bakersfield,

131
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:04.420
over to Santa Barbara and then back down to a long beach.

132
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:07.580
And who's going to take me roughly like three hours?

133
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:13.030
And I was going to do that about five,
six times and I was going to get my,
uh,

134
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.150
I was going to be up to 150 hours.
And,
uh,

135
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.270
then the fires came and I was like,
all right,
you know what,

136
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.030
I'm not going to be another asshole up there in the fucking way.

137
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:27.950
And plus I don't want to have to deal with trying to fly around that shit.
So,
uh,

138
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.390
I don't know,
maybe I'll do it in January cause I'm taking most of January off.

139
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.310
Um,
by the way,
I was going to be in Santa Barbara this weekend that got moved.

140
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:42.380
Um,
that got cancelled and moved because of the fires.
Um,

141
00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:47.000
so I don't know,
maybe in February or something like that.

142
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.830
I'll let you guys know what the,
uh,
the rescheduled date is.
Um,

143
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.010
anyways,
let's,
uh,
let's move ahead.

144
00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.241
Um,
oh,

145
00:08:57.241 --> 00:09:00.330
and also I forgot to trash the liberals that we're happy that Rupert Murdoch's

146
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:04.410
house caught on fire too.
I mean,
you just,
you just beyond a childish cunt,

147
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.430
if watching another person's house on fire because you don't agree with their

148
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:12.110
fucking political
views,
it's just,

149
00:09:12.111 --> 00:09:15.320
that just blows my mind,
you know?

150
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.930
I Dunno.
Look if his tie caught on fire anymore,

151
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.400
but why won't he had to pat it off?
There's,
I mean,
that's funny.
You know,

152
00:09:21.401 --> 00:09:24.820
the guy's got a zillion fucking tight,
he probably has a zillion houses too.

153
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.470
I mean,
what,
what am I saying here?
I'll tell you what I'm saying.

154
00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:32.430
I watch the Celtics,
I'm getting caught up on the [inaudible],
the Celtics.

155
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:33.900
I watched my Bruins,
uh,

156
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.480
make a valiant effort to get back in the game with Nashville,

157
00:09:38.481 --> 00:09:42.380
which they did a bright,
as I said in the second period,
I was just like,

158
00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:42.981
just come on man,

159
00:09:42.981 --> 00:09:45.890
let's score one fucking goal here before the end of the second period.

160
00:09:45.891 --> 00:09:49.850
They did still ended up losing five to three.

161
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:55.160
But,
um,
I dunno.
I Dunno what the Bruins are doing,
you know,

162
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:56.121
I was like,

163
00:09:56.121 --> 00:09:59.450
what the fuck are they doing when they blew up the team and then we started to

164
00:09:59.451 --> 00:10:03.650
make some progress last year and this year,

165
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.410
I know what I think we just have,
we had a bunch of injuries and shit,

166
00:10:06.411 --> 00:10:10.850
so I'm still holding out hope that they know what they're doing.
But I just,

167
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.120
I think we just signed some guy that was more of a physical presence,

168
00:10:14.121 --> 00:10:18.500
but somebody,
we're still feeling the effects of not having Luci each out there,

169
00:10:18.501 --> 00:10:23.440
man,
every three or four shifts.
But,
uh,
watch the Celtics first,

170
00:10:23.441 --> 00:10:28.360
the,
uh,
the Milwaukee Bucks and,
and watch that Yannis,
uh,
Super Khalil,
fragile,

171
00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:32.590
whatever his fucking name is,
uh,
the Greek freak.
Jesus Christ.

172
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:33.510
<v 3>Okay.</v>

173
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.750
<v 1>The difference between him last year when the Celtics played,
and this year,</v>

174
00:10:36.751 --> 00:10:41.200
I mean,
that guy was unbelievable.
He ate,
he had every,

175
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.450
every fucking shot you could possibly have.

176
00:10:43.451 --> 00:10:46.980
The guy's hitting fucking three pointers.
He was Dunkin on gay.

177
00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.310
He was dunking on guys.

178
00:10:48.311 --> 00:10:52.090
He was like 12 feet away from the rim and he would just reach his fucking arm.

179
00:10:52.091 --> 00:10:56.710
Just keeps going.
Um,
I got to see that guy life.

180
00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.760
That is,
uh,
that's when he's fucking young,
before his knees and they start,

181
00:11:00.761 --> 00:11:04.930
you know,
like,
you know,
like when you look at Tom Brady and he was like,

182
00:11:04.931 --> 00:11:05.980
what do you see as socks?

183
00:11:05.981 --> 00:11:08.650
And you could see there's all kinds of metal and shit underneath his fucking

184
00:11:08.651 --> 00:11:13.620
socks now.
MMM.
Or like Allen Iverson,

185
00:11:13.621 --> 00:11:15.870
who by the end was wearing like a cat suit,
you know,

186
00:11:15.871 --> 00:11:20.340
they had like those compression sleeves and then he got one on your leg.
Um,

187
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.540
I want to see that dude when he's fucking young,
you know,

188
00:11:24.541 --> 00:11:29.160
not favor and an injury,
just dunking on people the way I saw the other night.

189
00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:33.390
It was,
it was,
it was an incredible display.
Um,

190
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.070
I got to start watching them.
I just don't have fucking time.
I teach,

191
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:39.510
this is what I take.
I take Bruins,
Celtics,

192
00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:42.760
patriots and Duke University.
Okay.

193
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.823
<v 3>MMM.</v>

194
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.900
<v 1>And I try to stay up on those as much as I can.
And um,</v>

195
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.870
I got to start taping the Kansas Jayhawks too.
And it's just,

196
00:11:50.871 --> 00:11:54.370
it's just not enough fucking time.
Kansas Jayhawks that's my first team.

197
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.300
That's my first team.
But I got into Duke last year when I went to that game.

198
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.130
And um,

199
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:01.770
<v 4>okay.</v>

200
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:02.810
<v 1>I Dunno.
And I also,</v>

201
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.980
I called in this show and I got to talk to coach k and he was talking about like

202
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.610
how hard it is to recruit now

203
00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.860
because everybody's like one and done and he somehow got another whole batch of

204
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.540
one and done instead of the shit.
Two or three guys and a,
I dunno,

205
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.610
it's like what Kentucky does every year,
but a,
I don't know what happened.
I mean,

206
00:12:22.611 --> 00:12:27.611
I have slowly become like a college sports fan while trying to still pay

207
00:12:28.261 --> 00:12:33.261
attention to the pro shit's still not knowing what the Los Angeles Rams record

208
00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:37.200
is.
All right,
well we got,
we got Jared was his name,

209
00:12:37.201 --> 00:12:41.220
golf jaw for whatever the fuck he says that his,
his last name is like,

210
00:12:41.221 --> 00:12:46.210
how do you say Gif?
Jiff said Jeff is a Gif.
Um,

211
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.500
versus uh,
Carson Wentz.
Um,

212
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.420
although I got to tell you after watching the Seattle Seahawks last fucking
week.

213
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:56.150
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

214
00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:00.740
<v 1>I mean that was,
that was a,
that was an MVP level performance by Russell Wilson.</v>

215
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.780
I couldn't even tell how good their offensive life.
It was good.

216
00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:06.130
If it just absolutely sucked.

217
00:13:06.131 --> 00:13:08.410
It was like every fucking play drop back for a pass.

218
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.790
There'd be like three eagles,
you know,

219
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:17.160
defensive linemen in his face and he would just fucking zig zag around up there

220
00:13:17.771 --> 00:13:19.660
and changed direction.
Do is spin.

221
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.030
The one thing I will say about the Seahawks offensive line is they are really

222
00:13:25.031 --> 00:13:30.031
good about not holding when some shit like that because usually when somebody

223
00:13:30.281 --> 00:13:33.070
changes direction,
somebodies like,
oh fuck,
now you're going back the other way.

224
00:13:33.071 --> 00:13:36.070
Then they just,
they can't fight the urge to just hold.

225
00:13:36.071 --> 00:13:37.990
They were really good about not doing that shit.

226
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:43.070
I guess when you can't really tackle somebody,
there's no reason to block.
But um,

227
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:44.980
I was really,

228
00:13:44.981 --> 00:13:49.770
really impressed with how well Pete Carroll had those guys play in,

229
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:50.980
in the fact that,
uh,

230
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.480
Sherman was out with the ruptured Achilles and you hate to see that.

231
00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.540
Where is the fun beating Seattle?
If you know Sherman is plane,

232
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.150
you're not beating the Seahawks and me come,
c'mon,

233
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.430
you're beating an injured fucking team.
But they stay still looked.
Uh,

234
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.370
I think the Patriots,
Jesus Christ,

235
00:14:09.371 --> 00:14:10.960
we don't get enough pressure on the quarterback.

236
00:14:10.961 --> 00:14:12.640
Forget about a guy that runs around like that.

237
00:14:12.641 --> 00:14:16.780
I would not want to play those guys.
Um,
there I admitted it.

238
00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.770
They were scary fucking team.
All right,
let me read a little bit of,
um,

239
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:26.820
let me read a little bit of this shit here.
Um,
the advertising.

242
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:37.930
<v 4>Okay.</v>

243
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.150
<v 1>Oh,
your feminist speeches.
We'll look what happens now.</v>

244
00:14:40.151 --> 00:14:45.151
There's the pushback man crate crate for a man.

245
00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.440
Or if you're a lady out there and you want to get by your guy a created a shit,

246
00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:54.890
this is probably it.
It's hard to pick.
It's hard to pick out the perfect gift.

247
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.280
It's also hard to fucking mine for diamonds,

248
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.940
but all too easy to get it totally wrong.

It rolled into the hills and burn the houses down.

318
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.660
Um,

You know,

319
00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:30.650
just like this corrupt referees in the NBA.

320
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.950
There's corrupt firemen and you'll have,

321
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.840
you'll have a fire in your fucking garage and then,
you know,

322
00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:37.960
they'll put that out.
And when you go into your bedroom,
you,

323
00:19:37.961 --> 00:19:42.590
your wife's missing your earrings.
Where's my earrings?
I burned up in the fire

324
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.000

everybody,

325
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.660

326
00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.430
underwear.
Uh,

327
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:58.850
but we will still give it to our family and our loved ones who just don't want

328
00:19:58.851 --> 00:20:01.910
it.
But maybe it's not that that the underwears the problem.

329
00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.330
Maybe it's the kind of underwear.

Um,
this,
this fucking month.

363
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.740
I am trying to stay off social media because I think it is a,

364
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.230
uh,
I think it has,
it's,
it's,

365
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.760
it definitely has its good points now.
Right?
But wherever they are,

366
00:22:20.761 --> 00:22:23.250
I don't see them right now.
I'm taking a month off.

367
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:28.230
I'll still obviously tweet and post shit,
but I'm not reading anything.

368
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.020
Are any of that fucking crap?
Um,

369
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:34.690
I'm trying to be perfect Billy this month.

370
00:22:34.691 --> 00:22:38.590
I'm trying to go back to the bill that I was when I was eight years old.

371
00:22:38.591 --> 00:22:42.460
I didn't drink.
You know,
I didn't take the occasional hit of weed.

372
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:46.060
I didn't fucking,
I didn't watch porno.
Right?

373
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.590
I did watch people getting fucking slapped by gorillas on fucking youtube,

374
00:22:50.591 --> 00:22:53.020
but didn't exist.
Okay.

375
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:58.030
I ended up pure fucking mind.
I went outside,

376
00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:02.920
I picked up a stick and I played cowboys and Indians and reenacted the genocide

377
00:23:02.921 --> 00:23:06.160
that made this country what it is.
Okay.
I was innocent.

378
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.720
Uh,
yeah.
I'm just trying to fucking,
now I'm trying to slow it down here.

379
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.980
All right.
I've been doing great,
man.
Uh,

380
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:18.910
Dean del Rey has gotten me on this fucking diet that is working for me and I

381
00:23:18.911 --> 00:23:20.960
just got to eat more salads.
I got to get it again.

382
00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.400
I haven't been doing that lately,
but,
uh,
um,
I swear to God,

383
00:23:24.401 --> 00:23:26.230
I know you guys are going to fucking hate me.

384
00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:29.980
I know you're going to fucking hate me.
I'm laying off the bread.

385
00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:35.530
I'm kind of doing that gluten free thing,
you know.
And I used to always be like,

386
00:23:35.531 --> 00:23:38.560
fuck that dude.
I'm always eating pizza.
I'm always eating bread and shit.

387
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.790
I got to tell you something dude.

388
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.780
The fucking wait jus if you don't booze and you lay off the bread and the flower

389
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:49.670
that get off and you eat well,
that the fan has nowhere to hide.

390
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.150
It's like fucking roaches when you turn the light or I guess they run an I
don't,

391
00:23:53.151 --> 00:23:56.620
they,
I don't know what it is.
I Dunno.
I Dunno what the,
I don't know.

392
00:23:56.621 --> 00:23:58.930
I hate people.
I don't know what the fucking analogy is.
It's,

393
00:23:58.931 --> 00:23:59.900
it's out there somewhere.

394
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.200
<v 5>All right.
But it's not in my brain right now.
Um,</v>

395
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:09.770
<v 1>and I'm actually liking the Goddamn food.
I finally went to steel cut oats.</v>

396
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.160
Uh,
and for some reason on this diet,

397
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:15.380
I'm putting a little brown sugar and a little bit of butter in there.

398
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:19.310
It's been fucking tremendous.
And I know there's all these people are going,

399
00:24:19.311 --> 00:24:23.330
oh my God,
glad he's getting a cloud that brid worries.
Ah,
you know what?
Fuck you,

400
00:24:23.331 --> 00:24:24.440
I got to eat something.

401
00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:26.603
<v 5>MMM.</v>

402
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:29.390
<v 1>Then I have a couple of eggs over eg.</v>

403
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.673
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

404
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.080
<v 1>I got this other thing that I can make some times a breakfast where it's just</v>

405
00:24:34.081 --> 00:24:38.340
Keenan were black beans in an egg.
I throw a little salsa on top,

406
00:24:38.341 --> 00:24:40.620
fucking delicious.
I just don't wrap it up.

407
00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.880
One of those giant flour tortillas,
you know what the fuck and you know,

408
00:24:44.881 --> 00:24:45.631
you know what the deal is,

409
00:24:45.631 --> 00:24:49.080
then all of a sudden you start throwing the sour cream on and the cheese and all

410
00:24:49.081 --> 00:24:51.870
of that shit and you literally like,
you fucking,

411
00:24:51.871 --> 00:24:55.980
you leave the Taco stand and you're fucking walking out like leaning to one
side,

412
00:24:55.981 --> 00:24:59.490
like someone punched in your fucking ribs.
Um,

413
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:01.933
<v 5>yeah.</v>

414
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.910
<v 1>And then also I,
uh,</v>

415
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:09.890
my teeth are getting fucked up down the bottom.
Just as you get older,

416
00:25:09.891 --> 00:25:11.690
I guess your jaw keeps growing or whatever.

417
00:25:11.691 --> 00:25:15.140
This is whatever the fucking dentist told me.
So I actually,
I've,

418
00:25:15.141 --> 00:25:18.530
I finally bit the bullet and I got that fucking Invisalign,

419
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.520
so I got to wear that thing for the next 12 to 16 weeks and I'll do it.

420
00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.860
I'll tell you right now,
dude,
it fucking sucks.

421
00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:26.980
<v 5>It sucks,
man.</v>

422
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:29.640
<v 1>But it definitely makes you eat less because it's like,</v>

423
00:25:29.641 --> 00:25:32.300
I don't want to take this fucking thing out and go through this whole rigmarole.

424
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.193
<v 5>MMM.</v>

425
00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.970
<v 1>Oh my God,
Dude.
You realize I'm bald.</v>

426
00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.690
I'm going to be 50 and I'd be wearing braces.
Can you want us,

427
00:25:40.691 --> 00:25:42.880
do you understand the trifecta of fucking

428
00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:44.170
<v 5>okay.</v>

429
00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:45.490
<v 1>Thank God I have never in my life.</v>

430
00:25:45.491 --> 00:25:48.040
Can you imagine if I was a single man and that's what the fuck I was doing?

431
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:49.430
<v 5>Okay.</v>

432
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:53.060
<v 1>Um,
I'm kind of doing like a fucking light overhaul on my body right now.</v>

433
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:54.590
I'm laying off the booze.

434
00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:58.310
I'm getting my fucking teeth down the bottom because I was starting to look like

435
00:25:58.311 --> 00:26:00.530
a fucking,
I don't know what some sort of a,

436
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:05.240
where are my references today?
I don't know where the hell they are.

437
00:26:05.241 --> 00:26:09.470
I'm trying to think that there's a couple of fucking wild which said fucking

438
00:26:09.471 --> 00:26:11.580
thing that exists in um,

439
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:15.350
South America and it's the worst kind of animal to be.

440
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:20.030
It's like you would your like you exist to keep the top predators alive.

441
00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:21.200
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

442
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.710
<v 1>Like people are,
they fuck like rabbits.
The reason why rabbits fuck like that.</v>

443
00:26:24.711 --> 00:26:28.070
And they have all this because everybody eats them in the wild.
Okay.

444
00:26:28.071 --> 00:26:31.730
They'll live there like the,
the,
the,
hey,
you guys want to get some sliders?

445
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.360
That's what like rabbits are in the wild.
So there's some sort of fucking,

446
00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.670
it's not a pig and it's not a rat.

447
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.780
<v 5>What is that?
Fuck it to look it up now.</v>

448
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:44.250
South

449
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.280
<v 1>America.
I want to go to South America.</v>

450
00:26:47.281 --> 00:26:51.930
So bad South American pig rat.

451
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:57.240
Let's see if they show it the fuck is it?
Come on man.
Come on.

452
00:26:57.241 --> 00:26:58.074
Internet.

453
00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:00.043
<v 4>Okay.</v>

454
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:04.970
<v 1>Uh,
cappy cappy Barra.
Is that what it is?
These giant Guinea pigs.</v>

455
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.430
That's what my lower teeth are starting to look like.

456
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.660
Come on clicking on the images.
Did I do it right?

457
00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:18.700
Did I fucking nailed it?

458
00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.640
Fucking nailed it.

459
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:26.890
It's like if a squirrel fucked up pig.
Well they have,

460
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:29.980
they have like surprisingly one of the pig size rats.

461
00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:36.780
I got Omerta kind of cute.
The face really makes him fucking cute.
Um,

462
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:42.610
it's just gonna be like the next Pixar movie,
these giant mother fuckers.

463
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.440
Um,

464
00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:46.620
<v 4>okay.</v>

465
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.630
<v 1>By the way,
Dude.
Yeah.
I have South American man.
I've,</v>

466
00:27:48.631 --> 00:27:51.630
I've wanted to go there for so goddamn long.
I just don't have the time.

467
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.770
I'd love to go down there and do a fucking show,
you know,

468
00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:01.770
I've always wanted to go to the Galapagos Islands.
All of this shit.

469
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:07.200
It just seems green and beautiful,
you know,
I dunno,

470
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.500
I gotta get my ass fucking down there at some point.
Why?
Why the hell wouldn't I?

471
00:28:10.501 --> 00:28:11.940
If I talk about global warming,

472
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:15.390
why don't I jump on a fucking jet plane and spray on leaded,

473
00:28:15.391 --> 00:28:20.391
leaded fuel across the fucking atmosphere for a good 12 hour flight from la?

474
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.820
This is how dumb I am.
I actually thought,
cause I moved out here,

475
00:28:23.821 --> 00:28:27.810
I was actually just a shorter flight to fucking like Brazil or something.

476
00:28:27.811 --> 00:28:31.380
I didn't realize that like,
you know when you look at it,

477
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.580
if you were in New York and he flew due south,
you'd be on the east,

478
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:39.780
the west coast of their country.
Um,
yeah.
Bill.
Yeah,
we all have a globe.

479
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:41.940
We've all looked at a map at some point.
Well you know what,

480
00:28:41.941 --> 00:28:46.050
sometimes I don't look at Shit.
Um,

481
00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.710
anyways,
so I don't know shit about NFL football this year.

482
00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:52.950
So I'm actually going to go on a limb here and say something that is based on

483
00:28:52.951 --> 00:28:55.290
watching one football game.
Um,

484
00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:00.440
I'm actually thinking all right that the winner of the Rams Eagles game will

485
00:29:02.251 --> 00:29:06.720
fucking lose to Seattle or the Seattle might be on the road

486
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:10.590
come playoff time.
I have no,

487
00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:14.230
can you imagine if Marshawn lynch didn't fucking retire and kept,

488
00:29:14.231 --> 00:29:15.210
was still playing with them,

489
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:19.800
but they got that other kid dead fucking mini Marshawn that came with a fucking

490
00:29:19.801 --> 00:29:24.510
maniac.
Like,
I don't know what p care,
what the Fuck Pete Carroll does.
You know,

491
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.640
aside from looking the other way,

492
00:29:26.641 --> 00:29:30.930
would half his defense is doing fucking steroids?
I don't know what their,

493
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:33.210
what's in the water up there in Seattle,

494
00:29:33.211 --> 00:29:37.350
but they got some people that could fucking play.
Um,
all right,

495
00:29:37.351 --> 00:29:41.170
I'm done blowing the Seattle Seahawks.
Uh,
all right,

496
00:29:41.171 --> 00:29:42.790
that's the podcast here for this,

497
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:48.670
this wonderful Thursday.
Um,
all sober bill,

498
00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:52.300
who would've thought bold,
slender,
sober bill.

499
00:29:52.301 --> 00:29:57.220
I finally stood on the scale today I have to fucking not boozing eating like a

500
00:29:57.221 --> 00:30:01.000
fucking Hollywood douche.
And um,

501
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.760
you know,
when I went back in August,
I was pushing like,
I was like one 87.

502
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:11.320
I was pushing,
like pushing it,
you know,
it was closing in on 200 days.

503
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.130
Um,
I'm now down to about,

504
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:18.820
I said one 71.6.
It's perfect.

505
00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:23.740
My clothes fit now and this is what I'm going to do this time.
All right.

506
00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:28.660
I'm actually going to buy jeans that fit,
you know,
when I'm this way,

507
00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.500
because the problem is,
is I have a bunk.
All my jeans fit me when I'm wanting,

508
00:30:32.501 --> 00:30:36.130
right?
Seven.
So as I put on the way,
and I don't notice,
I'm all comfortable,

509
00:30:36.131 --> 00:30:40.670
they're just fucking walking around my big fucking Jade's Oh,
Billy big jeans.

510
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:47.200
Uh,
that might be my favorite one.
Oh,
Billy big jeans.

511
00:30:47.201 --> 00:30:49.510
I'm not fucking doing it anymore.
Do you understand me?

512
00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:54.260
Do you still speak English of fucking Bob?
I'm going to,

513
00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:58.030
there's like a skid row right down the street from me.

514
00:30:58.031 --> 00:31:02.210
I don't go to goodwill anymore.
I don't trust those cuts.
All right.
Uh,

515
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:05.730
what I do is I go down to skid row and I got,

516
00:31:05.731 --> 00:31:09.760
Hey Johan with free clothes.

517
00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.700
Um,
no,
I don't do that.

518
00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:17.210
I know anybody who was sorta my size step right up.

519
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:22.670
I just know I go down and I just have the bag and I walk up to where the tents

520
00:31:22.671 --> 00:31:26.840
are and I just fucking set it down and I turned around and I walk away like

521
00:31:26.841 --> 00:31:30.250
fucking Santa Clause for junkies.

522
00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:34.120
Okay.
Then I got all kinds of shit in there,
you know?

523
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.380
And it's just funny to me dead,
uh,

524
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:41.480
that I'm giving away clothes that late.
Maybe I would like this.

525
00:31:41.481 --> 00:31:46.481
Some like fucking homeless guy walking around wearing a shirt that I wore on

526
00:31:46.671 --> 00:31:47.510
Conan O'brien.

527
00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:55.940
I know what I should be doing is going down there and thinking,
oh my God,

528
00:31:55.941 --> 00:31:58.850
this is so sad that fellow Americans have to live this way.

529
00:31:58.851 --> 00:32:02.300
But I am such a self involved Hollywood douche.

530
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:07.510
I actually walk away still thinking about how about myself and how I just gave

531
00:32:09.591 --> 00:32:13.520
away close that had TV credits.
You know,

532
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:18.770
I hate that about myself,
but you know,
I'm just being honest.
I do,

533
00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:23.300
I and I also feel good that I did something like that.
Right?

534
00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:27.890
It's all that stuff that allegedly Jesus doesn't appreciate,
you know,

535
00:32:27.891 --> 00:32:29.210
he then spraying in public,

536
00:32:29.211 --> 00:32:31.700
I should just do that shit and not tell you guys that I did it,

537
00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:36.020
but now I'm telling you that I did it,
which takes away the,
uh,

538
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.630
the good deed because if you do a good deed,

539
00:32:38.631 --> 00:32:40.210
just so you walk around and talk about her,

540
00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.460
sit down and talk about it on a podcast,
you're not a good person.

541
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:47.960
You're a cunt and a,
yeah.
So that's what we learned here.

542
00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.380
You know,
if there really was a Jesus,

543
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:57.070
if there really was a Santa Claus did be coal in my stocking and I would be on

544
00:32:57.381 --> 00:33:01.070
my way to the fiery depths of health,
right?

545
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:02.660
According to my religion.

546
00:33:02.661 --> 00:33:05.630
Just because I went down there and I gave the clothes but then told you guys

547
00:33:05.631 --> 00:33:10.260
about it.
That's how it works in my religion.
That's how my religion is.
Um,

548
00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.590
all right.
I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about this point.

549
00:33:12.591 --> 00:33:15.440
All right.
That's the end of the podcast.
Okay.

550
00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.690
But fortunately we have some bonus material for you.

551
00:33:17.691 --> 00:33:19.070
We're going to play a little music.

552
00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.890
The Great Andrew Feminists always comes up with these tracks.

553
00:33:21.891 --> 00:33:24.440
You guys are always out here man.
Like who's ESPN?
Well Bill,

554
00:33:24.441 --> 00:33:28.880
you listen to all these interesting music.
It's not me.
It's Andrew.
All right?

555
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:33.110
And then after the music is over,
you'll then be able to listen to a,

556
00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:36.890
a greatest hits podcast from a Thursday gone by from earlier this year.

557
00:33:36.891 --> 00:33:37.760
A fucking,
I don't know.

558
00:33:37.761 --> 00:33:40.430
Whenever the hell I started these and that's how it works.

559
00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:43.310
And if you have a problem with that,
then you know what I would do?

560
00:33:43.311 --> 00:33:45.890
I would go to the all things comedy network and I would listen to a different

561
00:33:45.891 --> 00:33:47.420
podcast.
By the way,

562
00:33:47.421 --> 00:33:51.350
thank you guys so much for buying tickets to the Patrice O'neil comedy benefit.

563
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:56.190
<v 2>Tickets are going fast.
The lower level is already sold out.</v>

564
00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.010
Now we got the upper two decks to go.
You know what?

565
00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:03.180
It makes a wonderful Christmas gift.
Why don't you get your best guy,

566

567
00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:14.070
<v 2>a bouquet of candy cane fucking roses from pro flowers and get,</v>

568
00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.870
you know,
and then in the card when they think that,

569
00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.480
that you went gay for him and they're going like,
oh my God,

570
00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.240
how do I still hang out with this guy?
I thought it wasn't homophobic.

571
00:34:22.241 --> 00:34:25.510
I'm not homophobic until my best guy friend who I thought was straight has a

572
00:34:25.511 --> 00:34:28.150
crush on me.
Is that considered homophobia?

573
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:31.850
<v 1>Okay.
If you don't have a problem with gay people,</v>

574
00:34:31.851 --> 00:34:33.920
but then one of your friends who you thought was straight,

575
00:34:33.921 --> 00:34:38.630
then I'm going to use this.
The stupid expression becomes gay,

576
00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.180
you know,
like,
like,
like they caught the mumps or something.
Um,

577
00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.550
tells you that this whole time that Ben gay and that they also have feelings for

578
00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:49.980
you if you get weirded out by that.
Like,
dude,
I can't hang out with you.

579
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.590
Hang out with you for a while until,
uh,
I can't hang out.

580
00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:55.910
I don't think I can hang out with you.

581
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.240
<v 2>I mean,
a woman would say that,
right?
If you were this like,
you know,</v>

582
00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:01.980
I though we'd been friends for a while,

583
00:35:01.981 --> 00:35:05.890
but I just want to let you know that I've developed feelings for you.
Yeah.

584
00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.680
You're not coming over apartment to fucking watch survivor at that point
anymore,

585
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.840
unless,
unless she has feelings for you.
Right.
Isn't that how it works?

586
00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:17.470
<v 1>Well,
I don't know.
All right.</v>

587
00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:21.010
There's a lot of times I should have stopped a podcast 10,

588
00:35:21.011 --> 00:35:24.820
15 minutes earlier and uh,
this might be one of those times,

589
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:26.291
I have no idea.

590
00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:28.810
But you don't want to have to do the second eye fucking shut this off is I have

591
00:35:28.811 --> 00:35:32.770
to put my fucking Invisalign back in.
It's fine.
Once they're fucking in there,

592
00:35:32.771 --> 00:35:37.560
but one year
when you pop them in and they're like,
it's,
you know,

593
00:35:37.561 --> 00:35:38.010
to get the

594
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.180
<v 2>best results were at 22 hours a day.
You know,</v>

595
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.410
you ever go to the airport,

596
00:35:43.411 --> 00:35:47.100
you see those people who like broke the fucking ankle and then it's like they

597
00:35:47.101 --> 00:35:48.690
got that thing that they are,
uh,

598
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:52.980
it's like a scooter and they can just rest their knee on it.
This is like,

599
00:35:52.981 --> 00:35:55.020
this is the teeth version of that.

600
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.320
I don't understand why those people just don't use fucking crutches.

601
00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.680
Do they have like that little upper body strength?

602
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:06.660
Is there a cast that fucking heavy or is it just more efficient?

603
00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:11.820
Those are the hard hitting questions we ask here in the podcast.
All right.

604
00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:12.900
Have a great weekend.

605
00:36:12.901 --> 00:36:16.170
Your constant joined the music and the greatest hits Thursday afternoon.

606
00:36:16.171 --> 00:36:18.800
Just before Monday.
No,
just profile Friday.
Monday morning.

607
00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.100
<v 6>Okay.</v>

608
00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:33.240
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

609
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:09.370
<v 2>I had the urge to make a pumpkin pie this week.</v>

610
00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:14.500
I want to practice before the holidays.
Uh,
ginger,
scumbag

611
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:22.860
bill.
I've been a fan of yours for 15 years.
Okay,

612
00:37:22.861 --> 00:37:27.690
so you guys got that.
This guy has been a fan of mine for 15 years,

613
00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:33.170
so for 15 years this guy has been falling me enjoying things that I'm doing.

614
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:37.650
All right?
This guy's locked in for 15 years.

615
00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:42.210
The people that work hard every day and spend their hard earned cash,

616
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.990
that's kind of redundant,
sir.
If you work hard,
then you have harder and cash.

617
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.670
All right?
If you've got an easy job,
you know,

618
00:37:47.671 --> 00:37:50.190
and then you'd be spending your fucking teddy money,
right?

619
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:55.350
They'll just read the fucking email.
All right?
He's having fun,
Bill,

620
00:37:55.351 --> 00:37:56.820
I've been a fan of yours for 15 years.

621
00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:00.930
The people that work hard every day and spend their hard earned cash to see you

622
00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:05.160
have been really disappointed.
This is one of the classic things.

623
00:38:05.161 --> 00:38:08.010
When people complain,
rather than just complaining for themselves,

624
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:11.930
they act like they're standing in front of like a zillion people and they go

625
00:38:11.931 --> 00:38:12.050
right,

626
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.600
<v 7>relaxed attention,
everyone.</v>

627
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:20.180
I will send the email and we'll convey on your feelings.

628
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:25.100
Get on with your day,
relax.
I will handle it.

629
00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.360
<v 2>So evidently he has like,
you know,
all of these people are disappointed in me.</v>

630
00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:33.960
He said,
the people that follow you and made you who you are.

631
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.290
They made me people.
I didn't work hard on stand up.

632
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.840
I was just standing there and they all said,
hey yo,

633
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:46.290
we have decided to make you and who you are so sad it be said,

634
00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:48.760
so set it beat,
done.
He said,

635
00:38:48.761 --> 00:38:51.850
you have made dates all around the country and then cancelled them.

636
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.390
When Hollywood calls you to do a part,
that's exactly what happened.

637
00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.150
I picked up the phone.
I said hello.
They said,
this is Hollywood hair.

638
00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.940
We're calling you to do a part.
Say uh,

639
00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:03.580
the people that go to your shows and made you,

640
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:08.110
that made you aren't making a 10th of the money that you make,

641
00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:11.080
but they paid to see you.
Hey Ginger boy.

642
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:19.120
Without these fans,
you're illiterate.
Ass would be working at Mcdonald's at best.

643
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:22.660
Now I take offense to that,
sir.
Okay.

644
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:27.760
Without my fan base,
I would not be working at Mcdonald's.
You son of a bitch,

645
00:39:27.761 --> 00:39:32.410
I would be unloading trucks in a warehouse.
Get it straight.

646
00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:37.600
He goes,
you're a scumbag.
Ba Gee,
you're a scum.

647
00:39:37.601 --> 00:39:42.601
Baije and I hope every fan realizes what you are and stops going to your shows.

648
00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:48.280
I will never listen to your shows or podcasts again and we'll tell everyone to

649
00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:49.114
do the same.

650
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:53.440
You are the typical sellout to Hollywood fucking disappointment.

651
00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.640
I know you won't have the balls to read this on your podcast.
Instead,

652
00:39:57.641 --> 00:40:01.260
you will read a letter from a 20 year old guy confused about his girlfriend's

653
00:40:01.261 --> 00:40:02.470
sex and sexuality.

654
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.650
This is the best part here.
You're a real cunt.

655
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.320
Fuck you and everything you do

656
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:18.880
as one of the greatest endings,
one of the greatest standing,

657
00:40:18.881 --> 00:40:23.050
standing email ever got your a real cunt in the real deal.
If you,

658
00:40:23.051 --> 00:40:24.320
if you tip over your country,

659
00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:29.260
you see the stamp of approval from the current factory and then it's just not.

660
00:40:29.261 --> 00:40:32.530
Fuck you.
It's fuck you in everything you do.

661
00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:35.820
Even when I go to the grocery store.
Yeah,
that too.

662
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.110
Fuck you when you're picking out apples.

663
00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:39.903
<v 4>MMM.</v>

664
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:42.690
<v 2>Jesus Christ,
sir.</v>

665
00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:44.680
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

666
00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:49.240
<v 2>you made me,
did I have anything to do?
Did I do anything?</v>

667
00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.720
Did I work?
Did I not fucking go onstage and eat my balls?

668
00:40:52.721 --> 00:40:55.390
Learning how to do this.
I guess you did I listen,

669
00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.520
I just want to thank you for making me,
uh,

670
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:02.770
without your hard work of going through.
I mean,
I can't imagine how many,

671
00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:06.070
I mean,
how many people live in this country?

672
00:41:06.071 --> 00:41:09.370
I just can't imagine when you're just going through the macbook trying to figure

673
00:41:09.371 --> 00:41:13.960
out who you've decided will become a professional comedian.
That just is,

674
00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:18.250
and the fact that you also have a day job during the time where I guess you're

675
00:41:18.251 --> 00:41:21.850
grossly underpaid.
I mean,
that's just incredible to me,
sir.

676
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:24.880
What the fuck do you want from me?
Let me ask you this.

677
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:30.470
Okay.
If Hollywood called you and asked you to be in a movie,

678
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:33.023
you're going to say,

679
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.640
<v 4>you're going to say no.
Okay.</v>

680
00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:41.660
<v 2>All right.
And like,
like you told your mom,
Hey,
listen Ma,
don't worry.</v>

681
00:41:41.661 --> 00:41:45.500
I'll come over and I'll clean up your yard this Saturday.
All right.

682
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.590
And then all of a sudden Hollywood comes to Collins says,
Hey,

683
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.320
do you want to pretend you are a lot tougher than you are and getting to a

684
00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:55.820
gunfight and get shot by,
I know whoever your favorite actor is,

685
00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:01.370
you're going to say,
no,
I have to go.
Uh,
I got a stick.
What?

686
00:42:01.371 --> 00:42:03.620
You've never broken a fucking thing.
You know what?
Fuck that.

687
00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:05.690
Even like a play off game comes along.

688
00:42:05.691 --> 00:42:10.400
You've never fucking had to change a schedule,
sir.
I had to cancel some dates.

689
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:14.510
I didn't cancel them.
I rescheduled the fuck.
Do you want from me?

690
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:21.200
You want me to stay in the strip malls for my entire career telling jokes I did

691
00:42:21.781 --> 00:42:25.780
that.
I'm trying to fucking,
you know,
and I'll,
I'll,

692
00:42:25.781 --> 00:42:28.690
all these movies to do is make more people know who I am.

693
00:42:28.691 --> 00:42:32.020
So more people come out to my shows so I can keep writing more hours and having

694
00:42:32.021 --> 00:42:36.520
a good time.
All right.
I don't even know why I'm talking to you.

695
00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:39.700
You said you're never going to listen to my shit again,
right?

696
00:42:39.701 --> 00:42:43.620
Are you a man of your word after you saying,
I'm not a man of my word.
If you,

697
00:42:43.621 --> 00:42:47.200
you're actually listened to this,
then you're a fucking hypocrite.
All right.

698
00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:48.123
What's the matter?

699
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:49.553
<v 4>Huh?</v>

700
00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:51.450
<v 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

701
00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.710
Who fucking pissed on your sweat pants this week?

702
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:57.240
I don't even know what the fuck that was all about.

703
00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.160
You didn't even say what it was.

704
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:03.150
You may dates all around the country and then cancel them.

705
00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:04.960
The fuck are you talking about?
I had one tour,

706
00:43:04.961 --> 00:43:09.850
I had to move around and I fucking did the first two dates.
Then I'm,

707
00:43:09.851 --> 00:43:14.851
I've made up a one to 3 cents then and add an another one that wasn't even on

708
00:43:16.591 --> 00:43:20.010
that original tours.
So go fuck yourself.
All right.

709
00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:24.720
All the tickets are honored and if he can't make that date,
you get it refunded

710
00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:29.610
Jesus Christ.
You know that Ted tour that I was going to do,

711
00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:33.270
I was just going to land in Boise,
you know,

712
00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:38.280
jump on a bus and knock them all out in 10 days now because that whole thing

713
00:43:38.281 --> 00:43:41.850
blew up.
Now I've got to get on it.
You know,
it's like an extra 10 airplane ride.

714
00:43:41.851 --> 00:43:46.110
You won't hear me bitching though.
Yeah,
you fucking cunt.

715
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:49.680
You're a real cunt.
Fuck you.
And everything to do that was worth it.

716
00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:53.130
That was worth them getting mad.
That's fucking tremendous,
sir.
You know what?

717
00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:56.370
As much as you,
you disappointed me.
You're a real disappointment.

718
00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:59.370
You fucking jerk off.
You've liked me for 15 years.

719
00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:02.970
One cancel fucking Gig and now you're now you're saying fuck me and everything I

720
00:44:02.971 --> 00:44:06.810
do.
I make that Pumpkin pie this week.
You saying fuck the pie too.

721
00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:10.530
That's a part of it.
You're saying fuck America.
If you're saying fuck punk,

722
00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:11.413
punk a pie.

723
00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:15.123
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

724
00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.990
<v 2>but I got,
Hey,
I am a real cunt.
I,
you know,
I can't argue that</v>

725
00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.330
you know something.
Could somebody please put that on a tee shirt?

726
00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:31.990
You're a real cunt.
Fuck

727
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:33.790
<v 8>you and everything you do just to have that just</v>

728
00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.870
<v 0>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

729
00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.123
yeah.

730
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:39.250
<v 9>We feel go around to the regional striking is wrong.</v>

731
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.390
There's Friday and the oceans,

732
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:48.030
we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the hour.

733
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.260
We shall defend our island.
Whatever the cost.

734
00:45:52.261 --> 00:45:55.050
Maybe we shall fight on the beaches.

735
00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:57.780
Fight on the landing grounds.

736
00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:01.860
We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.

737
00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:05.910
Have to fight in the hills.
We shall never surrender.

738
00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:08.443
<v 5>Okay.</v>

739
00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:15.540
<v 8>Bill borrows to Monday morning podcast and I think I have the swine flu.</v>

740
00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:21.780
Ah,
yeah.
I'm sweating here.

741
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.960
Roasting,
baking,
boiling.
It's like a fucking Shona,
I Guess Second Cleveland.

742
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:31.380
Why did I play Winston Churchill to begin this podcast?

743
00:46:31.381 --> 00:46:34.080
I'll tell you why you group of fucking cunts.

744
00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:37.320
It's because I'm one week out from my standup special,

745
00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:42.350
my next hour special that I'm taping December 17th two shows at the Fillmore in

746
00:46:42.751 --> 00:46:44.430
San Francisco,
California.

747
00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:49.680
And I am beyond fucking ready for this thing and I'm getting myself psyched up

748
00:46:49.681 --> 00:46:54.360
and I always fucking love that speech first heard it as an iron maiden fan when

749
00:46:54.361 --> 00:46:56.070
power slave came out,
right?

750
00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:57.270
<v 5>Okay.</v>

751
00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:00.740
<v 8>That power slave when the fucking doe the live the live when they weren't</v>

752
00:47:00.741 --> 00:47:03.050
screening for me,
Long Beach.
Remember that one?

753
00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:07.610
And they play that speech right before they went into ace is high and I was
like,

754
00:47:07.611 --> 00:47:10.190
what the fuck is that speech sets?
You know?

755
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.460
<v 5>It's incredible.
We had a fire on their land.</v>

756
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:18.340
<v 8>We didn't fight in the change in the ocean,
which I never saw.
Landa.</v>

757
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:20.743
<v 5>You imagine that.</v>

758
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:23.840
<v 8>What a fucking time to be alive.</v>

759
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:27.200
All these fucking NFL coaches getting credit for their little halftime

760
00:47:27.201 --> 00:47:30.960
adjustments,
you know?
Well,
it's weird.

761
00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:34.510
One for the gipper has nothing compared to that shit.

762
00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:36.580
You understand what the fuck was going on?

763
00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.670
Can you imagine living in that little fucking island?

764
00:47:39.671 --> 00:47:41.440
They call a country over there in England.

765
00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:45.480
They're little sissy ass little fucking island.
I'm just fucking with you.

766
00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:46.373
You can't.

767
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.310
You live in over there in England and you got that fucking sweaty cow licked.

768
00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:53.170
Half a mustache,

769
00:47:53.171 --> 00:47:58.171
psychopath Adolph off and getting all those fucking maniacs all excited for the

770
00:48:00.701 --> 00:48:01.570
blitzkrieg

771
00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:06.580
and you're sitting there having your little fucking cup of tea.

772
00:48:06.581 --> 00:48:08.110
Whatever the fuck it is you do over there.

773
00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:09.720
<v 4>Okay?</v>

774
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:14.210
<v 8>You know with your fucking handmade britches listening to the radio.
Hey,</v>

775
00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:15.250
there you go to this guy.

776
00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:16.930
<v 4>Okay</v>

777
00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:21.350
<v 8>shall fight on the land.
We shall
fight in France.
Uh,</v>

778
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:25.810
so fucking greatest.
It's the fucking greatest thing ever.
And they did it.

779
00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:29.770
They fucking fought them off.
They survived the fucking blitzkrieg.

780
00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:31.330
What exactly was the blitzkrieg?

781
00:48:31.331 --> 00:48:36.070
That was a eight off strategy where he hits you from the air,

782
00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.880
from the sea,
and also on the land all at once.
Was,
that's what,

783
00:48:39.881 --> 00:48:44.610
was that what it was or was it just his bombing?
Sort of a,

784
00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:48.640
I don't know.
Fucking know.
My nose is clogged up.
I want to fucking,

785
00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:50.360
<v 4>okay.</v>

786
00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.660
<v 8>I want to know is transplant.
This sucks fucking blows.</v>

787
00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:58.790
I was getting sick all the way to Cleveland.
You know,
I was fighting this shit.

788
00:48:58.791 --> 00:49:02.810
What kind of a fucking asshole gets a cold in Los Angeles?
You know,

789
00:49:02.811 --> 00:49:06.730
that's why I moved out here.
I was like,
Oh my God,
I'm so sick.
If getting exists,

790
00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:12.680
I don't want to get to the full 30 more
fucking losing my voice.

791
00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:17.510
It's a Sunday night.
It's a nine 31 and uh,

792
00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:19.820
just flew back from Cleveland today.

793
00:49:19.821 --> 00:49:23.780
I'm supposed to be in my acting class and I wasn't able to do that because

794
00:49:23.781 --> 00:49:26.390
obviously you know,
and then one of those,
fuck don't hate that.

795
00:49:26.391 --> 00:49:31.391
Fuck those fucking assholes who are sick and they still come to work and then,

796
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:35.930
and then not only do they come to work,
they want to get like,

797
00:49:35.931 --> 00:49:39.980
like they want you to like be like,
wow,
what a trooper.

798
00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:44.120
He's like,
dude,
you're fucking sick and now you're going to make me sick.

799
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:49.350
You know,
get Outta here.
Go crawl back down your fucking man hole.

800
00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:53.060
Wherever you got that 28 days virus that you fucking bring it in here.

801
00:49:53.061 --> 00:49:56.000
You Maniac it Outta here.
The Fuck Outta here.

802
00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:01.310
What you do here is not important.
Do you understand that?

803
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.590
<v 4>Okay,</v>

804
00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:06.250
<v 8>that's why your cubicle is so small.
Take a fucking day off.</v>

805
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:10.960
I fucking hate all those people.
All those assholes.

806
00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:16.110
The first fucking warm day in the spring and you look out the door,

807
00:50:16.841 --> 00:50:17.351
what do you see?

808
00:50:17.351 --> 00:50:22.180
Some asshole and a tank top and fucking short shorts jogging down the fucking

809
00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:25.330
Goddamn river,
right,
right next to the fucking river.

810
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:28.820
Stupid son of a bitch is going get sick and then he's going to fucking show up

811
00:50:28.821 --> 00:50:32.150
and get everybody else sick.
So I don't do that shit.
When I get sick,

812
00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:36.610
I stay home and I do a podcast.
That's what I do.

813
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:40.820
Ah Fuck.
I got one of those,

814
00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:43.820
those headaches where if when you're lying down it doesn't hurt.

815
00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:47.210
And then when you get up you almost fucking tip over.

816
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:52.540
You could feel every time your heartbeats on either side of your forehead.
Ah,

817
00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:56.910
fuck.
You know what I noticed is such a weird night,
you know,

818
00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:01.360
if you don't watch football like Sunday night,
especially around December,

819
00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.540
they showed all the first run episodes.

820
00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:06.850
So they got a lot of reruns and now they're trying to do some little holiday

821
00:51:06.851 --> 00:51:10.660
special things.
I was just watching Pavarotti duets.

822
00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:16.750
I'm live from,
I don't know where I'm going to guess Italy.
Um,

823
00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:20.220
cause it look European.
The guy's singing in Italian.
I know it's opera.

824
00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.760
We sing it at anywhere else,
but whatever,
man,

825
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:29.820
I turn it on and there is Annie Lennox and that scraggly dude from the

826
00:51:29.821 --> 00:51:33.720
eurythmics and they're singing some song.
She's a terrible dancer by the way.

827
00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:34.710
I'm really surprised me.

828
00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:39.410
And he's standing there stoically and uh,

829
00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:43.540
in a little in his fucking Tuxedo waiting,
waiting to sing,

830
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:46.990
she's dancing around like a,
you know,

831
00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:49.600
you don't like when you want to adjust your fucking underwear,

832
00:51:49.601 --> 00:51:51.880
but you can't use your hands cause you were in public.

833
00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:55.090
So you do that little weird move with you fucking,
you know,

834
00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:58.120
sorta Elvis hole.
You do.
Oh,

835
00:51:58.190 --> 00:52:03.150
who my fucking underwear is up my ass.
Right?

836
00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.690
If I wasn't sick,
I would have done that smoothly.
That would have that.

837
00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:07.740
We actually would have been funny.
So anyway,

838
00:52:07.741 --> 00:52:10.950
she's dancing like a fucking retard and he's just standing there.

839
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:14.680
She's sitting there going,
sweet dreams are made of these.

840
00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:16.660
Wait for him to be like,
Hey,

841
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:21.790
a getcha Toray up,
put up,
put up an apoe two.

842
00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:26.080
I don't even know what the fuck it is.
I know what they're doing.
You know,

843
00:52:26.081 --> 00:52:30.980
I should actually keep my down because a downstairs is this.

844
00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:34.170
There's an old guy who lives beneath me.
Um,

845
00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:37.100
just picture Pat Cooper if he wasn't funny,

846
00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:41.630
just keep the rage and eliminate all the brilliant jokes.

847
00:52:41.631 --> 00:52:46.370
That's what lives underneath me and he's a fucking cunt.
And I'll tell you why,

848
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:51.330
because he yells at my girlfriend.
All right,

849
00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.350
it's fucking old.
Motherfucker yells at my girlfriend,

850
00:52:54.351 --> 00:52:58.040
but he only does it when I'm on the road.
Okay.

851
00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:02.270
Cowardly bastard.
So it's like,
first of all,

852
00:53:02.271 --> 00:53:05.900
how the fuck do you know when I'm not in town?
This is what happens.

853
00:53:05.901 --> 00:53:10.700
We have hardwood floors and you know,
my gorgeous girlfriends,

854
00:53:10.701 --> 00:53:15.620
like most gorgeous girlfriends,
they have a lot of Horry shoes.
You know,

855
00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.360
all women have that little horse shoes,

856
00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:19.670
you know the sound they make when they go across,
you know,

857
00:53:19.671 --> 00:53:23.870
and she tries to put them on the last seconds before she leaves.
You know,

858
00:53:23.871 --> 00:53:27.420
you know that sound of the horse,
the WHO,

859
00:53:27.421 --> 00:53:32.070
a shoes hitting the hardwood floor.
And maybe some will have no Liam,
have any,

860
00:53:32.071 --> 00:53:37.071
you guys notice that you can be engrossed in the greatest conversation ever with

861
00:53:37.201 --> 00:53:40.590
one of your guy friends.
And the second you hear high heels hitting the floor,

862
00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:44.820
you immediately,
both of you stop talking.
You turned to look,
you know,

863
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:48.630
let's see.
Let's see what level of horror we're talking.
Oh,
oh,

864
00:53:48.631 --> 00:53:52.830
the old business suit.
Oh yeah,
I have a career.
I'm not that kind of girl.

865
00:53:52.831 --> 00:53:55.470
You're shoes are giving you a way,
Wendy.

866
00:53:55.830 --> 00:54:00.780
We know all about you and your drunken escapades down at the Tgi Friday's.

867
00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:01.290
Okay.

868
00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:06.290
So stop with your whole Dimi more little fucking vibe when is going on with that

869
00:54:07.891 --> 00:54:11.040
fucking broad anyways,
to me more,
she gonna age at any point.

870
00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:15.820
You know what?
Uh,
when I was flying back from Cleveland,

871
00:54:15.821 --> 00:54:19.490
I actually sometimes I don't want to think,
and I,

872
00:54:19.491 --> 00:54:24.310
I bought people magazine and a,
you know,
you do the crossword puzzle,

873
00:54:24.311 --> 00:54:25.910
you feel smart and uh,

874
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:35.270
start with seven across on happy days and Sin Williams.

875
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:38.710
Oh God,
look at that 17 letters.
Um,

876
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:43.350
what am I going,
what am I trying to say here?
Yeah.
So there's,

877
00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:47.170
so some woman had written in,
um,

878
00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:50.200
I wish I still had the magazine.
Somebody asked me if they were like,

879
00:54:50.201 --> 00:54:52.780
can I look at that?
Can you look at it?
You can fucking have it.

880
00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:57.610
Blow your nose on it.
I don't give a shit to people magazine.
Um,

881
00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:59.790
some lady had written in,

882
00:54:59.791 --> 00:55:04.791
cause they had written a big article on Demi more where they would just throw

883
00:55:04.811 --> 00:55:07.720
THEC thethe though,
hot and 48 and then this,

884
00:55:07.721 --> 00:55:12.721
this person had written in response to that [inaudible] sell hot and 48.

885
00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:16.330
Yeah.
Anybody could be that with Botox,

886
00:55:16.331 --> 00:55:20.860
a private chef and a fucking personal trainer.
You know,

887
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:25.450
women are really competitive with that shit.
You know,

888
00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:29.620
that's like if they did an article and they talked about the toughest guy ever

889
00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:32.950
on the planet,
you know,
no matter how much you respect them,

890
00:55:32.951 --> 00:55:35.440
at some point you're going to have to be like,
that guy's a fag.

891
00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:40.750
You know though all I would,
you know what I would do do right.
No,

892
00:55:40.751 --> 00:55:44.530
I'm serious dude.
You know I do.
I will fuck it.
I just walk up to him,
you know,

893
00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.460
like,
hey bro was going on.

894
00:55:46.461 --> 00:55:49.840
Do you want to give them by Ryan was cha the Saccharin he looked away,
dude,

895
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:53.680
I front kick him right in his knee.
Blow out his fucking Acl,
dude,

896
00:55:53.681 --> 00:55:56.350
I'm telling you it works.
I'm taking this fucking Israeli shit,
dude.

897
00:55:56.351 --> 00:55:57.184
I'm telling you,

898
00:55:57.550 --> 00:56:02.350
telling you I took like two classes and now I just use the fucking gies pajamas.

899
00:56:02.351 --> 00:56:06.010
But you know,
I still feel like I know how to fight shut up.

900
00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.680
Um,
yeah,

901
00:56:08.681 --> 00:56:13.570
there's a few girls out there who just are not aging to me.
More Courtney Cox.

902
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:18.400
I Dunno what that just like,
that's a funny thing about that.
Courtney Cox,
uh,

903
00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:23.140
move,
uh,
show that she has,
that's outright now where she's a,

904
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:26.680
you know,
she supposed to be like this desperate,
uh,

905
00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:29.680
what the fuck do they call those?
Uh,
Jesus Wolf's.

906
00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:31.390
<v 4>Okay.</v>

907
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:34.900
<v 8>Ducklings.
Cougars.
There we go.
There we go.</v>

908
00:56:34.901 --> 00:56:38.320
Fucking NYQUIL kicking in baby.
Uh,
yeah,

909
00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:42.100
she's supposed to be this desperate cougar trying to fuck,
you know,

910
00:56:42.101 --> 00:56:45.760
hook up with the younger guy and it's like,
all right.
First of all,

911
00:56:45.761 --> 00:56:50.761
she's still hot and she's in ridiculously good shape.

912
00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:53.500
And then the way they shoot her with that fucking,

913
00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:56.040
I don't know what the trick is that it,

914
00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.810
but it basically eliminates every line in your face.

915
00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:03.160
So now she looks like she's like 31 32,
you know,

916
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:06.640
that's a hot age for a woman.

917
00:57:06.641 --> 00:57:11.420
So like I that that's the whole fucking thing doesn't work for me,
you know?

918
00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.910
And then they got her dress like this,
this,
this,

919
00:57:13.911 --> 00:57:18.911
so fucked on that show because they're trying to appeal,

920
00:57:20.090 --> 00:57:23.420
I guess to this certain segment of women that they're going to watch it who were

921
00:57:23.421 --> 00:57:26.930
in that situation.
There's a lot of divorces out there.
53%.
Right.

922
00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:29.660
But uh,
and the other thing,

923
00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:33.590
but the other side of it is they have to make her look good.
You know,

924
00:57:33.591 --> 00:57:37.400
they got a horror out,
so they kind of cancel each other out and like,

925
00:57:37.401 --> 00:57:39.440
it doesn't make sense.
I'm like looking at it going,
wow,

926
00:57:39.441 --> 00:57:42.330
I've fucking bag of that girl a second.
She's gorgeous.
Right.

927
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:45.670
But then there will make it or walk around like she's desperate.

928
00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:50.570
You know,
I just realized,
I admitted that I watched that show.

929
00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:52.420
<v 4>Okay,</v>

930
00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:53.860
<v 8>where the fuck did I watch it too?</v>

931
00:57:53.861 --> 00:57:56.650
I at least have the out that I was on the road and I was lonely.

932
00:57:57.730 --> 00:57:59.170
I think I watched that show.

933
00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:00.620
<v 4>Okay</v>

934
00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:04.940
<v 8>by myself in my old apartment.
Well,
you know,</v>

935
00:58:04.941 --> 00:58:09.050
every once in a while you find a new level of sadness in your life that you

936
00:58:09.051 --> 00:58:11.270
didn't even know existed,
existed.

937
00:58:11.271 --> 00:58:16.271
Like just so not even in touch with how pathetic you're life has become.

938
00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:18.460
<v 4>Okay.</v>

939
00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:21.430
<v 8>That you just openly admit something like that.
And then by the end of it,</v>

940
00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:24.460
you know,
like if you guys were actually sitting here like halfway through it,

941
00:58:24.461 --> 00:58:28.480
you would've given me that look the same look he just gave you fucking iPod or

942
00:58:28.481 --> 00:58:32.620
your radio or your high fi,
whatever the fuck you listen to this thing on.

943
00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:34.990
You know,
except I didn't see it.

944
00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:38.590
That's the great thing about this podcast is when I started opening up and

945
00:58:38.591 --> 00:58:43.240
making an ass out of myself.
You guys can sit there and laugh at me and fuck,

946
00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:48.020
I wish you were here right now because I would have stopped that story.
Wow,

947
00:58:48.021 --> 00:58:51.530
that's embarrassing.
That is really fucking embarrassing.
Um,

948
00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:57.470
so anyways,
I'm sick,
um,

949
00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:59.990
and I'm getting ready to do my special,
but I'm getting over this shit.

950
00:58:59.991 --> 00:59:00.780
I don't give a fuck.

951
00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:05.780
I want to thank everybody who came out to see me at hilarity and Cleveland this

952
00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:10.130
past weekend.
I had a great time and uh,
you know,

953
00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:14.130
want to thank nick for having me out there just to fucking great,
clever.

954
00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:18.080
You know,
salt of the Earth Guy,
he's one of these guys,
he's like fucking,

955
00:59:18.081 --> 00:59:21.380
I don't know how old the guy is.
He's somewhere in his sixties,

956
00:59:21.381 --> 00:59:25.580
I'll say 61 in Casey's listed and I know he's like 63 but he's still lifts,

957
00:59:25.581 --> 00:59:29.720
still wears like a wife beater.
But he's a classy guy.
You know,

958
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.150
he,
he,
he's still,
he can still fuck somebody up.
That's,
you know,

959
00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:36.170
it's very inspirational.

960
00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.950
You know what's funny about him too is that you can tell that he a,

961
00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:44.000
we were talking about having a temper and a,
I have a temper,

962
00:59:44.001 --> 00:59:45.530
but I wear my more on my sleeve,

963
00:59:45.531 --> 00:59:50.150
which lets you know that I'm pretty much harmless,
but it's,
it's the guys who,

964
00:59:50.151 --> 00:59:54.410
you know,
have a temper and they're,
they're,
they're really soft spoken.

965
00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:58.610
Those are the guys who will literally twist your fucking head off like a fucking

966
00:59:58.611 --> 01:00:03.560
beer cap.
You know,
those guys,
he's one of those dudes,

967
01:00:03.561 --> 01:00:08.480
like somebody told me a fucking story about him doing some crazy shit and then I

968
01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:12.240
asked him about it and then he's telling the story and he's just,
Oh,
you know,

969
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:16.640
I can't yell.
Yeah,
I had a situation and uh,
you know,

970
01:00:16.641 --> 01:00:21.050
it thinks God ah,
interesting.
And Ah,
you know,

971
01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:23.750
I mean it's just one of those things.
And so what happened,

972
01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.970
they just like immediately moves on

973
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:30.260
and then later on you find out he beat the shit out of seven guys with like a

974
01:00:30.261 --> 01:00:31.340
fire hydrant,
you know,

975
01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:35.480
as opposed to the other guy who doesn't even throw a fucking punch.

976
01:00:35.481 --> 01:00:38.300
And then the ads like 97 details.
Right.

977
01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:41.110
So I could tell the way he was standing that he was a southpaw,

978
01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:45.290
so I start cheating to the right.
Right.
Shut the fuck up.
Don't,

979
01:00:45.291 --> 01:00:48.950
I'm telling you I'm taking this Jujitsu stuff.
You know,
I started watching spike,

980
01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:53.690
you know,
without I gotta I gotta go,
Gee,
I went down there,
I took one class,

981
01:00:53.691 --> 01:00:55.460
I got my ass kicked.
But,
uh,

982
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:59.360
I'm really good at like seeing things for like an hour and then being able to

983
01:00:59.361 --> 01:01:00.111
talk about them.

984
01:01:00.111 --> 01:01:03.620
Like I've been doing it for 10 years while my nose just hit another level of

985
01:01:03.621 --> 01:01:07.310
being fucking stuffed up.
Ah,
okay.

986
01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:12.530
This is going to be a short podcast,
everybody.
Um,
all right.

987
01:01:12.531 --> 01:01:16.110
What else can I admit to that's fucking embarrassing.
It's not embarrassing.
Uh,

988
01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:21.110
Santa Claus is coming to town.
Is that the name of it is on tomorrow.

989
01:01:21.111 --> 01:01:21.440
That,

990
01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:25.040
that claymation thing that I used to watch as a kid and I'm recording it and I'm

991
01:01:25.041 --> 01:01:26.240
going to watch it with my girlfriend.

992
01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:31.190
Hopefully I'll have a Christmas tree up by then.
And,
uh,

993
01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:35.030
if I had a fireplace I would get a fire going,
but I doubt so,
uh,

994
01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.770
I'll just light our little fuck candle.
Uh,
anyways,

995
01:01:39.771 --> 01:01:42.080
happy holidays to everyone.

996
01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:46.220
I have not even started my shopping.
Um,
you know,

997
01:01:46.221 --> 01:01:48.810
I do a thing on this podcast where people give me an a,

998
01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:53.860
I give people advice and this week somebody is actually giving me advice how to

999
01:01:53.931 --> 01:01:56.480
fuck to both nostrils get clogged up at the same time.

1000
01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:02.510
I fucking dog sleeps all day all day long and then it comes in at night and it

1001
01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:06.440
is like tired from sleeping.
You're a bum.

1002
01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:08.413
Look at you.

1003
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.710
You know I'm teaching the dog how to speak and I swear to God I give,

1004
01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:16.250
you got to hear it.
You got to hear it.
It's absolutely adorable to me.

1005
01:02:16.251 --> 01:02:20.040
It will be annoying to you.
And I'm gonna.
I'm gonna fucking play it.
Oh,

1006
01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:21.030
I know what I wanted to do.

1007
01:02:21.031 --> 01:02:24.990
I wanted to go on fucking youtube and find out why Carsello got suspended

1008
01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:29.100
against the fucking capitals.
Dude,
that guy,

1009
01:02:29.101 --> 01:02:34.101
I swear to God is like Mickey Featherstone on fucking skates.

1010
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.360
Jimmy Ku did.

1011
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:39.360
You know that's why when I look at it and he's got that same haircut.

1012
01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:43.050
Anybody read that book?
The westies 30 reminds me of like,

1013
01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:46.140
you should be at Hell's kitchen to the seventies but he's played for the flyers.

1014
01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:49.650
All right,
car Sylo.

1015
01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:52.220
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1016
01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:56.570
<v 8>Suspended.
Let's see what this brings up.
Sorry.
Winston Churchill.</v>

1017
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.840
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1018
01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:03.070
<v 8>A cheap shot.
Carsello a that's 2000 what the fuck did he do?</v>

1019
01:03:03.370 --> 01:03:06.670
But anybody knows what he did.
Let me know.
Just let me know what he did.

1020
01:03:06.671 --> 01:03:10.340
He did something against the capitals.
I have no fucking idea.
Uh,

1021
01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.820
anyways,
let's get onto the advice.

1022
01:03:12.821 --> 01:03:15.640
Somebody wanted to give me some advice this week,
which is a nice turn of the,

1023
01:03:15.641 --> 01:03:20.500
if I consider again it,
it's the holidays.
Um,
alright.

1024
01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:26.020
Jesus Christ Carsello has more fight videos that Brittany Spears has look at my

1025
01:03:26.021 --> 01:03:30.940
vagina videos.
Thank you.
That was a joke.
Sorry,

1026
01:03:30.970 --> 01:03:35.230
I'm sick.
This has really bad.
Come on.
And Bell,
step it up.
Oh,
you know,

1027
01:03:35.231 --> 01:03:37.840
I didn't finish telling me this story about the guy downstairs.
Right.

1028
01:03:37.841 --> 01:03:41.920
So this is a fucking asshole.
This is what he does.
Anytime.

1029
01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:43.943
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1030
01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:48.840
<v 8>Uh,
my girlfriend walks across the floor.
He just goes,
why is he say?</v>

1031
01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:53.500
He goes like,
ah,
great.
Keep it up.
Keep it up.
He says that he was,

1032
01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:58.520
he's real sarcastic and it infuriates my girl to no fucking dead,

1033
01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:03.590
to the point that she's claiming that he's harassing her and she wants me to go

1034
01:04:03.691 --> 01:04:05.910
downstairs and have a talk with this guy.

1035
01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:10.680
There's no way this isn't going to be fucking hilarious,
which I've got to go do.

1036
01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:14.460
Right.
But I don't understand.
Like if this guy,
what is this guy just says,

1037
01:04:14.461 --> 01:04:18.450
you know,
why don't you go fuck yourself?
What am I going to do?
I mean,

1038
01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.220
I wouldn't fight this guy if he was my age and now I'm going to have a fucking

1039
01:04:23.221 --> 01:04:27.660
70 year old guy who lives alone at all.
It's a sad fucking thing.
I'm just like,

1040
01:04:27.661 --> 01:04:29.010
why don't you just laugh it off?

1041
01:04:30.850 --> 01:04:31.650
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1042
01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:35.790
<v 8>I dropped something.
What?
I was up here one time and he goes,
he's real sarcastic.</v>

1043
01:04:35.791 --> 01:04:39.510
And he goes,
do it again.
And you know what I did?

1044
01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:43.560
I did it again even harder and I yelled out.
How was that?

1045
01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:47.010
And he's never yelled at me again.
You know,

1046
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.170
you guys fucking heartless Jesus Christ,

1047
01:04:49.171 --> 01:04:50.610
having a word in your life that what I got,

1048
01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:55.310
I got to go downstairs and confront this guy like I bit a Bronx Tale,
you know?

1049
01:04:57.330 --> 01:05:02.260
Anyways.
All right,
here's the advice I got.
Jesus Christ by fucking doses is,

1050
01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:06.990
it's done well,
90 minutes.
So this is going to be a half hour one.
All right guys,

1051
01:05:06.991 --> 01:05:11.520
I'm sorry,
whatever.
You get shopped at a dude.
Oh yeah.
Got To shop for Kwanzaa.

1052
01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:17.040
Hanukkah,
uh,
are there,
how many days a hypercar?
There's like 13.

1053
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:18.220
Why don't I keep asking you questions

1054
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:20.890
<v 7>about the Jewish religion?
I think I'm searching for something new.</v>

1055
01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:25.400
<v 5>You know,
I'm a</v>

1056
01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:28.220
<v 7>aware of my mortality.
Um,</v>

1057
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.910
especially with the swine flu that I caught out in Cleveland.

1058
01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:36.160
Don't you guys just celebrate it a one day or do you really have to buy somebody

1059
01:05:36.161 --> 01:05:39.670
13 fucking gifts?
He give him something every day.

1060
01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.840
That's it.
More than a religious bullshit.
That's,

1061
01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:47.470
that's their version of Jesus Pollard the fish out of the fucking basket.

1062
01:05:47.930 --> 01:05:50.020
Where the sub Guy Dave Jebidiah,

1063
01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:55.530
he only had enough fucking knock Zima to keep the zits off his face for five

1064
01:05:55.931 --> 01:05:59.140
days and sub it's sub how he did it for fucking 13 rarely.

1065
01:05:59.141 --> 01:06:03.040
Who gives a shit just set around the collection basket.

1066
01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:06.120
We'll keep paying for your bed sheets.
All right,

1067
01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:12.790
dear bill,
irregular serve your weekly podcasts,
uh,

1068
01:06:12.791 --> 01:06:14.200
which I enjoy immensely.
Thank you.

1069
01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:18.580
I noticed on occasion that you have met should you are learning to play guitar.

1070
01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:20.620
First of all,
Kudos.
Secondly,

1071
01:06:20.621 --> 01:06:25.621
please tell me that you will never fucking incorporate any form of guitar

1072
01:06:25.871 --> 01:06:27.310
playing into your act.

1073
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:31.600
I know it's easy to learn a few open chords or they'd pile all your c grade

1074
01:06:31.601 --> 01:06:33.540
material.
Just some bullshit SOG.

1075
01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:37.720
I though you could do it and I know people read idiots with laugh at you and

1076
01:06:37.721 --> 01:06:40.990
you'd kill five,
10 minutes of set time,
easy.
However,

1077
01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:46.100
please promise me you will never stoop to that level.
Sincerely concerned.

1078
01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:50.920
Fat Ass.
Fucking hilarious.
Yeah,
dude,
I have no intentions of doing that,

1079
01:06:50.921 --> 01:06:53.500
but I hope I do do it some day.
I'm standing up right now.

1080
01:06:53.501 --> 01:06:58.150
Hopefully this will clear be up.
Uh Oh.
It's like magic.
You're like that.

1081
01:06:58.151 --> 01:07:01.260
You like hear me sniffle on this fucking thing.
Uh,

1082
01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:05.080
I actually hope that I do that one day,
sir.
And you know why that is?

1083
01:07:05.081 --> 01:07:09.580
Because that would mean that I have actually reached such a level of success

1084
01:07:10.450 --> 01:07:14.050
that no one around me can tell me what a horrible mistake I'm fucking making

1085
01:07:14.051 --> 01:07:18.550
with my career.
You know,
Kinda like Al Pachino in the 90s.
He was like,

1086
01:07:18.551 --> 01:07:20.920
so you know,
such a legend at that point,

1087
01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:26.490
that one director ever pulled him aside.
It was like owl.
Ah,

1088
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:31.480
you're yelling.
Yeah,
yeah.
You're,
you're just,
you're just sorta yelling.

1089
01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.640
You're not,
you're not acting,
you're just yelling.

1090
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.380
[inaudible] we were like on the sixth day of the shoot here and uh,
you know,

1091
01:07:38.381 --> 01:07:40.540
I mean this scene is like,
you know,
two lines.

1092
01:07:40.541 --> 01:07:43.990
You're get some coffee and a donut and um,

1093
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:50.800
yeah,
you just cut a yell at,
I don't know what I mean,

1094
01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:53.470
I respect you were the godfather,
but you don't,
you just fucking,
you know,

1095
01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:54.363
one of those deals.

1096
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:59.430
So if I actually got to the point where nobody actually told me to stop,

1097
01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:03.630
you know,
to not go on stage with a guitar,
do it.
I'm like,

1098
01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:06.250
I'm never going to do that shit.
I shouldn't never say never.

1099
01:08:06.251 --> 01:08:07.011
But I'll tell you this,
I,

1100
01:08:07.011 --> 01:08:10.900
I'd be lying if I didn't already fantasize about doing it.
You know,

1101
01:08:11.350 --> 01:08:14.920
like fuck going to happen the greatest hour special of all time.

1102
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:16.870
And then the head,
my encores,

1103
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:20.720
I come out and I play better than Stevie Ray Vaughn.
You know,

1104
01:08:21.210 --> 01:08:23.570
and then next thing you know,
I'm playing drums in them,

1105
01:08:23.571 --> 01:08:27.890
crooked vultures when David Grohl as to take a night off,
right?

1106
01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:30.710
But you guys have fantasies like that.

1107
01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:36.350
You got to dream big and that sit down and watch that Courtney Cox fucken

1108
01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.850
whenever the COO fucking cougars show is,
oh,

1109
01:08:40.851 --> 01:08:43.100
he had a little epilogue here to this.
He said,
ps,

1110
01:08:43.101 --> 01:08:45.980
I saw that picture of you playing with the victor Wooten band,

1111
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:50.990
playing drums with them and know that you've been an avid drummer for a long

1112
01:08:50.991 --> 01:08:55.190
time.
So what's it like to learn a real instrument now?

1113
01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:58.670
Boo Yah,
it's fucking guitars.

1114
01:08:58.671 --> 01:09:02.840
They're all so full of themselves with their feathered hair playing the same

1115
01:09:02.841 --> 01:09:06.230
fucking power cords that have been playing since fucking Peter Frampton.

1116
01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:09.380
Once you guys get over yourself,
you know,
you know what?

1117
01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:13.620
I hope you go to a holiday party for no particular reason.
Just in,
in,
in this,

1118
01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.980
in this,
in the,
in the vein of a Bronx tale.

1119
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:19.880
Every time I think I'm a Bronx tale is Chazz Palminteri and the end of that

1120
01:09:19.881 --> 01:09:23.750
pistol just comes out and whacks him in the back of the head.
You know,

1121
01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:29.120
I helped that APP is to you,
but it's a fucking Ukulele.
I don't want you to die,

1122
01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:32.720
but I just really want you to take a nice fucking get a little blunt force

1123
01:09:32.721 --> 01:09:35.600
trauma with the Ukulele.
What are you thinking about that?
Uh,

1124
01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:40.460
I would love to have youtube video of you alone.

1125
01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:44.600
You know some of this stupid rock poses that you probably did back in the

1126
01:09:44.601 --> 01:09:47.030
eighties if you're older.
Huh?

1127
01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:51.620
Did you do the point and the little kick we did.
You do the thing,

1128
01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:56.210
the state trooper to the 10th power where you stand with your legs apart but

1129
01:09:56.211 --> 01:10:00.970
really far apart.
Huh?
Admitted you ever done that?
Mr Guitarist,

1130
01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:02.660
Mister fucking musician.

1131
01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:08.180
He never ever doing a little tap on solo in the bathroom mirror and then started

1132
01:10:08.181 --> 01:10:11.820
flicking your tongue.
Like you will look in a clit.
Huh?

1133
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:13.880
Cause you saw the white snake video.

1134
01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:17.180
Did you lick your guitar like the Douche bag in that band?

1135
01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:21.710
That's what I want to know.
The fucking guitars is so fucking annoying.

1136
01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:25.190
They really thinking.
They all think they're fucking virtuosos.
They're not,

1137
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:30.140
you know,
they're doing the same bullshit.
I actually did notice that.
You know,

1138
01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.900
I'm going to begin to say that.
Why would I do that?

1139
01:10:32.901 --> 01:10:34.790
Then I'd be shitting on a band that he fucking like.
All right,

1140
01:10:34.791 --> 01:10:38.510
let's plow ahead here.
The fuck is wrong with my keyboard here.
Um,

1141
01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:42.680
all right,
Bill.
Oh this is,
this is what I would tell you right now.

1142
01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:45.840
This guy is asking me for advice and I don't know.

1143
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:49.970
I don't know what to do on this one.
Okay.
So I need some help on this one.

1144
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.150
All right,
Bill,
I have a situation for you.

1145
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:55.340
Um,

1146
01:10:55.341 --> 01:10:59.990
so I've been banging this engage girl for the past several months

1147
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:08.690
and we're in,
we just went in with both feet.
Okay.
How's the water?
Fine.

1148
01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:09.500
All right.

1149
01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:12.440
I started with the two years ago when we took a break for a year when she got

1150
01:11:12.441 --> 01:11:15.180
gays in 2008,
uh,

1151
01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.260
she reinitiated our arrangement over the summer.

1152
01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:20.580
<v 5>Uh,</v>

1153
01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:27.900
<v 7>the fuck,
sorry guys.
I got to stand up here so I'm gonna get fucking all right.</v>

1154
01:11:27.930 --> 01:11:30.180
While I know it's wrong to be bagging and engage girls,

1155
01:11:30.181 --> 01:11:33.340
she's a petite Latin girl,
a great lay a,

1156
01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:37.680
she's 22 and a fiance lives over in London.
A Guy Sd too.

1157
01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:40.620
That's what he says.
Yeah.
You just justified it.
However,

1158
01:11:40.621 --> 01:11:44.640
now that the miserable son of a bitches moving from London to New York to be

1159
01:11:44.641 --> 01:11:45.230
with her,

1160
01:11:45.230 --> 01:11:48.960
he had hit me that marriage is actually a serious move in life and this poor

1161
01:11:48.961 --> 01:11:52.500
bastard is going to be spending the rest of his life with her.

1162
01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:55.350
That only do I feel a bit guilty though.

1163
01:11:55.351 --> 01:11:58.860
I don't hesitate to call her at 4:00 AM when I'm at least 20 drinks deep.

1164
01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:03.180
I feel bad for the poor guy that he's going to be marrying this slag.

1165
01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:07.650
Maybe this girl is so fucking horror as she actually compares the size of my

1166
01:12:07.651 --> 01:12:11.710
deck with her fiance's.
Wow.
Um,

1167
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:15.060
and she thinks that I'm going to be a take it as a compliment that mine is

1168
01:12:15.061 --> 01:12:20.040
bigger.
And she even invited me to her wedding.
What the fuck is wrong with her?

1169
01:12:21.810 --> 01:12:26.760
Jesus Christ,
dude,
it is a situation.
Uh,
he said,

1170
01:12:26.761 --> 01:12:27.750
I'm going to use a,

1171
01:12:27.751 --> 01:12:31.350
I'm going to use her as exhibit a when I educate my son's on how women are

1172
01:12:31.351 --> 01:12:35.940
complete horse rarely.
So now they're all whores because of this one here.
Dude,

1173
01:12:35.941 --> 01:12:40.020
you really,
you picked a fucking winner here.
Uh,

1174
01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:41.010
in any event,

1175
01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:46.010
my question boils down to this by friend suggest that I write her fiance and an

1176
01:12:46.201 --> 01:12:48.960
anonymous email.
Um,

1177
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:51.900
I was thinking more of one of those kidnapping letters with a different letters

1178
01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:56.040
cut out from magazines.
Did that would be fucking hilarious.

1179
01:12:56.610 --> 01:12:59.070
Um,
about how I was,
uh,
one,

1180
01:12:59.110 --> 01:13:02.880
the leg would be about how I was begging her for the last several months.

1181
01:13:02.881 --> 01:13:04.620
What do you think?
Well,
I hate rats.

1182
01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:07.770
I think I'd be saving this guy lifetime of misery.
On the other hand,

1183
01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:11.460
that bastard proposed to her after only three months of meeting her.

1184
01:13:11.461 --> 01:13:14.910
So he kind of deserves it.
Am I doing this poor bastard or favor?

1185
01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:18.300
Any advice would be appreciated.
Uh,
okay.

1186
01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:24.240
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Where do we go with this one?
What should you do?

1187
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:26.833
<v 5>MMM,</v>

1188
01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.110
<v 7>well,
you know what,
dude,
in a perfect world,</v>

1189
01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:32.680
you could actually send a letter to that guy.

1190
01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:37.930
You could tell him what was up and once he got over the shock of it,

1191
01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:42.090
he would actually be like,
oh,
thank God.
You know,
you know,

1192
01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:45.280
I'm not saying he would like you,
but he'd be like,
thank God you did me a favor.

1193
01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:51.400
I almost fucking married this psycho.
Right?
And,

1194
01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:55.360
and then the little Latino hoary girl would be like,
you know,

1195
01:13:55.570 --> 01:13:59.650
as mad as I am at you,
um,
you were right.

1196
01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:01.840
I was doing the wrong fucking thing,

1197
01:14:01.841 --> 01:14:06.690
so I should probably shouldn't be getting married too immature,
blah,
blah,

1198
01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:10.900
blah,
blah,
blah.
And uh,
and then you'd stop fucking her.

1199
01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.200
Right?
That would be the perfect world.

1200
01:14:14.201 --> 01:14:17.140
But this is probably what's going to happen.
You're going to do it.

1201
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:21.130
This guy's going to flip out and flip out.

1202
01:14:21.131 --> 01:14:26.131
Has a whole rainbow of emotions anywhere from collapsing in the street,

1203
01:14:26.411 --> 01:14:31.240
crying and peeing on himself to going over there and choking that woman to

1204
01:14:31.241 --> 01:14:33.970
death.
Um,

1205
01:14:34.690 --> 01:14:38.470
and she's going to flip the fuck out at you and it's just going to be a big

1206
01:14:38.471 --> 01:14:39.430
fucking mess.

1207
01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:41.043
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1208
01:14:41.970 --> 01:14:44.910
<v 7>You going with your gut here?
What kind of a fucking asshole?</v>

1209
01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:47.850
What kind of a fucking asshole,

1210
01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:54.390
you know,
date somebody who lives on the other side of a fucking ocean.

1211
01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:58.280
If you need a passport to get to the person that you're going to marry you,

1212
01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:02.250
not only should you not marry them,
you're not even in a relationship with them.

1213
01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:07.440
You know what I mean?
Fuck that.
That's fucking retarded.

1214
01:15:07.530 --> 01:15:09.930
You know what that is?
He was so used to fuck it.

1215
01:15:09.931 --> 01:15:14.400
All those pasty bitches over there in London with their awful fucking teeth and

1216
01:15:14.401 --> 01:15:15.750
they're efficient chips,
breath.

1217
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:19.560
All of a sudden he comes over in New York on the fucking Puerto Rican Pride Day

1218
01:15:19.770 --> 01:15:23.640
parade and it was over.
That's what happened.
That's what I'm guessing.

1219
01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:25.080
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1220
01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.830
<v 7>Top of those little J.
Lo girls came walking by and he said,
Holy Shit,</v>

1221
01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:32.610
life does it have to be this hard.
It's just like sexy beast,

1222
01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:34.313
<v 4>you know?</v>

1223
01:15:36.090 --> 01:15:38.100
<v 7>Do you ever meet the of it Miss London?</v>

1224
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:40.770
I remember that guy was fucking say it all that shit

1225
01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:46.410
heavy Cantwell along face Dell make me laugh.

1226
01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:50.040
He really made the London scene miserable.
I'm just fucking with you guys.

1227
01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:53.100
Some reason I keep shitting on England here.
Yeah,
Dude.
You know what?

1228
01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:56.640
You got a great story.
Just fucking tap out man.

1229
01:15:57.390 --> 01:16:01.170
You don't want to do that shit.
You know that's his story.
Just tell a little bar.

1230
01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:06.380
Fuck this guy.
Fuck up.
You know,
come on.

1231
01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:11.880
Really,
this girl is this pig of,
I dunno,
but women are so great at fucking lie.

1232
01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:15.450
They really are better at Dennis.
They lie just as much as we do.

1233
01:16:15.451 --> 01:16:18.120
So I don't want to make this seem like I'm trashing a women here.
I,

1234
01:16:18.121 --> 01:16:19.470
I view women that they're,

1235
01:16:19.471 --> 01:16:23.190
they're sitting in the same mud puddle that were sitting in their animals just

1236
01:16:23.191 --> 01:16:25.710
like us with the same fucking desires.

1237
01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:30.480
The one thing I do like about this story is what I've been saying all along,

1238
01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:34.980
getting into horrific arguments with my girlfriend is,
you know,
they,

1239
01:16:34.981 --> 01:16:39.160
why don't they ever catch women cheating?
You know,
tiger woods,

1240
01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:40.600
another guy getting busted.

1241
01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:44.770
It's like the six fucking famous guy to get busted,

1242
01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.870
you know,
so it really,

1243
01:16:46.871 --> 01:16:51.871
people are starting to buy into this shit that guys are the only ones who cheat.

1244
01:16:52.511 --> 01:16:55.450
And I can tell you this,
being a road comic,

1245
01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.820
the amount of fucking married women who have approached me is fucking

1246
01:17:00.821 --> 01:17:04.870
ridiculous.
You really sit there yet you got your,
oh my God.

1247
01:17:04.871 --> 01:17:08.410
Did the fucking guy just yell at me?
I think he just yelled at me.
I fucking,

1248
01:17:08.411 --> 01:17:09.244
what's he going to do?

1249
01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:15.750
By the time he walked up all my stairs,
you know what I'm saying?
Um,

1250
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:22.280
anyways,
the fuck was I just talking about.
Yeah.
They just,

1251
01:17:22.281 --> 01:17:26.420
they're just,
they're fucking,
they're better at it.
They're better.

1252
01:17:26.421 --> 01:17:29.600
They already liked do a mild form of lying all day long.

1253
01:17:29.601 --> 01:17:33.200
They call it manipulation.
You know,
that shit that they do.

1254
01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:37.760
You know,
they want something and they just immediately,
they always know like,

1255
01:17:37.761 --> 01:17:40.370
what emotion?
Let me try cute.
And they put their shoulders are,

1256
01:17:40.371 --> 01:17:45.060
he did a little fucking smile or they do the pouty face,
you know,
or they're,

1257
01:17:45.061 --> 01:17:47.690
they act like they're just like this helpless little fucking thing.

1258
01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:51.980
Those are all lies.
This is all shit thickets.

1259
01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:57.040
That just basically means there's something that I don't want to do and I want

1260
01:17:57.201 --> 01:18:00.800
you to do it for me and I want you to pay for it.
And I want you to,

1261
01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:04.730
not only do I want you to do like,
they're so good at it.
It's not even,

1262
01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.460
it's not even good enough for you to just do it for them.

1263
01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:12.560
They want you to actually enjoy it,
enjoy doing it for them like that.

1264
01:18:12.561 --> 01:18:14.660
Like that's how much they get your fucking head spinning.

1265
01:18:14.661 --> 01:18:18.980
So that's why they never get caught.
That's mine.
That's my belief.
All right,
Bell.

1266
01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:22.880
Uh,
I don't even know if that made sense.

1267
01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:26.270
I sort of fucking zoned out halfway through that with the Nyquil haze I have

1268
01:18:26.271 --> 01:18:31.250
going on here.
No,
actually took dayquil deny.
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,

1269
01:18:31.251 --> 01:18:33.800
let's go to overrate.
Underrated,
overrated.

1270
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:38.870
Condescending cons from Connecticut.
Jesus,
a little,
little literation.

1271
01:18:38.910 --> 01:18:39.830
They're condescending.

1272
01:18:39.831 --> 01:18:44.831
Comes from Connecticut who infest New York bars and grade you on that three

1273
01:18:45.561 --> 01:18:47.990
dimensional grid of where you work.

1274
01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:52.670
Went to school and live these cards.
Work in PR,

1275
01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:57.740
make 30 grand a year and live off daddy's AMX and his rent checks for their

1276
01:18:57.741 --> 01:19:00.620
Chelsea flats.
Uh,

1277
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:04.320
should be purged at.
Didn't even make sense to it.

1278
01:19:04.321 --> 01:19:09.290
I don't know if you edited that last sentence.
All right
dude,
you got,

1279
01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.870
you got some issues with women here.
Okay.
First of all,

1280
01:19:11.871 --> 01:19:14.000
you're going to wear this condescending cons.

1281
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:15.860
There's plenty of great women out there.
You know,

1282
01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:20.330
he just used give fishing in the same poison pod.
You know,

1283
01:19:20.410 --> 01:19:22.490
what are the names of these places that you go to?

1284
01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:26.990
I lived in New York for 12 years.
I never met women like that.
I never met him.

1285
01:19:26.991 --> 01:19:30.320
I ain't one of those a Wall Street bars,
you know,

1286
01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:36.210
go to go to some,
a little bit different.
Start off with like a sports bar that,

1287
01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:40.760
you know,
what about those wine bars?
Is that where you're going?

1288
01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:47.210
People sit there and a chat?
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

1289
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:50.510
Um,
I'm just trying to take the edge off or how bad women are getting trashed on

1290
01:19:50.511 --> 01:19:55.460
this.
Uh,
underrated.
Uh,
what the fuck does that say?

1291
01:19:56.090 --> 01:20:00.110
Heleo sequence a kick ass band from Portland,
Oregon.

1292
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:05.390
H e l I.
O sequence.
All right,
I'll check those guys out.
Thank you for the email.

1293
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.891
All right,

1294
01:20:06.891 --> 01:20:09.150
let's get to the questions that I'm going to have to tap out guys because

1295
01:20:09.151 --> 01:20:13.490
obviously,
yeah,
I feel too fucking hot here.
All right,
questions bill.
Um,

1296
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:15.750
love the podcast but,
but all,

1297
01:20:15.751 --> 01:20:19.740
here's one from a guy who actually went to my Saturday night show at hilarity is

1298
01:20:19.741 --> 01:20:24.060
in Cleveland.
Um,
as such,
I was at your late show for,
uh,
last Friday night,

1299
01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.320
Saturday night and Cleveland.

1300
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:29.460
The group I was with went out for dinner or drinks before the show and everyone

1301
01:20:29.461 --> 01:20:33.150
was having a great time.
So we get to the club,
take our seats to the waitress,

1302
01:20:33.151 --> 01:20:37.050
informs my buddy that they have some absinthe Martinis,

1303
01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.890
have set I believe was illegal for a long time and recently now it isn't.

1304
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:44.330
They used to think it makes people go crazy or something like that.
Um,

1305
01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:49.280
so anyways,
so he offers to buy them.
Uh,

1306
01:20:49.290 --> 01:20:53.250
so my buddy offers to buy,
uh,
those absent Martinis for everyone in our group.

1307
01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.990
Mind you,
um,

1308
01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:57.690
everyone has said that they were not planning on drinking at the club due to

1309
01:20:57.691 --> 01:21:02.160
various obligations they had the next day.
So he buys was for everyone but me,

1310
01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:05.340
I'm driving even though no one really seems to want it.
Dot.

1311
01:21:05.341 --> 01:21:09.120
My girlfriend is a small girl as such,
cannot really hold their liquor that well.

1312
01:21:09.330 --> 01:21:12.420
So this Martini cubs that she didn't want it,
she begins to drink it.

1313
01:21:12.690 --> 01:21:15.690
I see you're sipping on it throughout the opening of middle acts until it's

1314
01:21:15.691 --> 01:21:18.990
finished.
Finally you get on stage.
We're all laughing our asses off.

1315
01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:20.910
Then all of a sudden I notice her stop.

1316
01:21:21.150 --> 01:21:26.150
I look at her ask if she's okay to which she shakes her head and says no and she

1317
01:21:26.521 --> 01:21:29.280
says she needs me to take it to the bathroom.

1318
01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:30.870
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1319
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:34.350
<v 7>Why I need to go?
I have no idea.
You know why?</v>

1320
01:21:34.351 --> 01:21:38.490
Because she's a fucking woman.
They drag you down with them.

1321
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:43.590
If you had to fucking Puke,
you would just get up and puke.
Right.

1322
01:21:44.130 --> 01:21:45.600
I need you to go with me.

1323
01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:47.220
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1324
01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:51.100
<v 7>Fucking Oh God.
It's so fucking annoying.
Why I need to go.
I have no idea.</v>

1325
01:21:51.101 --> 01:21:54.100
I guess so I get uh,
I have no idea.

1326
01:21:54.101 --> 01:21:57.100
I guess so I get to look like,
oh,
I guess so.

1327
01:21:57.101 --> 01:21:59.990
I get to look like the Douche walking out with their behind me anyway,

1328
01:21:59.991 --> 01:22:03.310
she ends up puking and I ended up having to take her home missing half of your

1329
01:22:03.311 --> 01:22:04.690
show.
So my question is,

1330
01:22:04.691 --> 01:22:08.770
should I be mad at my buddy for buying her the extremely potent drink that she

1331
01:22:08.771 --> 01:22:12.460
didn't want or should I be pissed at her for drinking it after saying she didn't

1332
01:22:12.461 --> 01:22:16.030
want it because she didn't want to get drunk.
I'm kind of mad at both of them,

1333
01:22:16.150 --> 01:22:20.410
but more so at her because no one put a gun to her head and forced her to drink.

1334
01:22:20.411 --> 01:22:25.060
She chose to.
Um,
all right.
Who should you be mad at?

1335
01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:25.953
Um,

1336
01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:29.400
<v 4>MMM Christ.</v>

1337
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:31.590
<v 7>I don't,
I don't fucking know.
These are hard questions.</v>

1338
01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:37.670
Do you know what you should kind of be mad at yourself for?
Somehow I had it.

1339
01:22:37.671 --> 01:22:40.440
First of all,
you know,
I need you to go with me to the bathroom.

1340
01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:42.670
<v 4>Okay?</v>

1341
01:22:42.670 --> 01:22:43.780
<v 7>You know,
that's just one.
You know what?</v>

1342
01:22:43.810 --> 01:22:46.630
That's one of those things where you shouldn't have to go to the fucking

1343
01:22:46.631 --> 01:22:48.760
bathroom,
but that's one of those things.
If you don't,

1344
01:22:48.761 --> 01:22:50.650
they're going to make it seem like,
you know,

1345
01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:54.160
it's Vietnam and you took off in the chopper and left him down there like

1346
01:22:54.161 --> 01:22:57.820
fucking Willem to fall.
You know what I mean?
It just becomes a,
yeah.

1347
01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:02.230
If you were think I would have fucking blah,
blah,
blah.
You know,
it's amazing,

1348
01:23:02.231 --> 01:23:05.200
sweetheart.
Hawaii,
you're always a hero in these hypothetical.

1349
01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:10.510
You know why that is?
Because they're hypothetical
and annoys me.

1350
01:23:10.511 --> 01:23:13.600
Why do you have to go to the fucking bathroom?
What did you do?

1351
01:23:13.601 --> 01:23:15.550
You can't go in there.
What she did?

1352
01:23:15.551 --> 01:23:20.140
You sit there with like a glass up to the door so you could hear a puking.
Um,

1353
01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:21.340
who should you be mad at?

1354
01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:26.110
You should break your fucking buddies balls and then tell your girl that she

1355
01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:30.310
needs to take you out for a fucking something or rather just go make her do

1356
01:23:30.311 --> 01:23:33.280
something for you.
Break a break her fucking balls about it,
you know,

1357
01:23:34.450 --> 01:23:37.600
cause you got fucked it all of that.
You brought your buddies a dickhead.
What do,

1358
01:23:37.601 --> 01:23:38.434
what do you care?
You know,

1359
01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:41.470
he's probably trying to bang the other girl that's at the table.
Right?

1360
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:43.750
He's doing what he's doing.
He's getting everybody liquored up.

1361
01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:49.330
He's trying to be a show off,
right?
Absolutely.
It used to be illegal.

1362
01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:52.560
Right.
And he orders all the fucking things.
I Dunno.
That's what,

1363
01:23:52.570 --> 01:23:53.081
that's what I would do.

1364
01:23:53.081 --> 01:23:55.610
I break your buddy's balls and that I'd make your girlfriend.
Yeah.

1365
01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:57.973
<v 5>I don't know.</v>

1366
01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:00.670
<v 7>Totally go make your breakfast or salted.</v>

1367
01:24:00.730 --> 01:24:03.070
It's say it is chauvinistically as possible.

1368
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:05.143
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1369
01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.160
<v 7>You know,
and if she does it,</v>

1370
01:24:06.161 --> 01:24:08.440
I would just start jerking off right in front of her.
But that's me.

1371
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:11.680
That's what I do.
All right,
next question.
Hey Bill,

1372
01:24:11.681 --> 01:24:15.730
a big fan of yours from the opiate Anthony show and the Monday morning podcast.

1373
01:24:15.731 --> 01:24:19.180
You do look,
little quick question for you.

1374
01:24:19.181 --> 01:24:22.390
I am a military vet.
I'll do this is a brutal,

1375
01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:25.330
this is a brutal situation situation.

1376
01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:30.550
Um,
all right,
quick question for you.

1377
01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:34.930
I am a military veteran and I also happened to be Korean.
Um,

1378
01:24:34.931 --> 01:24:37.780
I'm in college right now and all my friends are white.

1379
01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:40.870
When we hang out and get drunk,
the ugly racist shit comes out.

1380
01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:43.720
I know the difference between joking around in real hate.

1381
01:24:43.721 --> 01:24:48.700
My problem is I was homeless week getting food with my dad went outside.

1382
01:24:48.701 --> 01:24:51.070
I hear,
fuck you chink,
yelled at us.

1383
01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:56.020
I went blind with rage and jumped out of the car that was going about 20 miles

1384
01:24:56.021 --> 01:24:59.620
an hour.
I chased those.
Fuck the two fucks down.
But they are,
I try to,

1385
01:24:59.621 --> 01:25:01.970
but they were too fast and got away.
Um,

1386
01:25:02.050 --> 01:25:04.360
chickens is probably the racial slur that hurts the most.

1387
01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:07.000
That shit really eats away at me.
And my parents are immigrants,

1388
01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:10.930
but they work hard and I've never fucked over anyone or cheated on their taxes,

1389
01:25:10.931 --> 01:25:11.764
et cetera.

1390
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:16.000
I felt that I served my country for a year in the desert just to come back and

1391
01:25:16.001 --> 01:25:20.530
still be hated because I have a small cause I have small eyes and a tiny penis

1392
01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:24.150
or you just,
well,
okay.
Okay.
Um,

1393
01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:28.540
any advice on how to handle undeserved racism?

1394
01:25:29.770 --> 01:25:34.600
Uh,
many advice to help my friends understand what it's like to be a minority.

1395
01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:39.490
Anyways,
let me know what you think.
A huge fan of fucking chink.

1396
01:25:40.330 --> 01:25:42.190
I'm all right,
dude.
All right.

1397
01:25:42.191 --> 01:25:46.510
The first advice I would give you is when you want somebody to understand what

1398
01:25:46.511 --> 01:25:47.920
it feels like to be a minority,

1399
01:25:47.921 --> 01:25:50.710
you probably shouldn't ask a white male heterosexual.

1400
01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:55.510
Because I read that whole thing of,

1401
01:25:55.511 --> 01:25:59.680
my big question was was what do you hang out with your friends?

1402
01:25:59.681 --> 01:26:03.440
And they get drunk and you know,
all the racist stuff comes out.

1403
01:26:03.441 --> 01:26:08.090
And you were like,
I can tell the difference between joking and just,
uh,

1404
01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:12.650
in real hate.
Uh,
my question is,
is why?

1405
01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:14.240
Just because you're Korean,

1406
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:19.270
that it just seems like my brain for half a second was like,

1407
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:23.510
oh,
he's Korean.
So because he is a minority in this country,

1408
01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:27.920
that means he's incapable of racist thoughts.
My question would be,
I'll,
I'll add,

1409
01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:30.620
I'll got a question.
If you,
have you ever thought something fucked up,

1410
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:33.770
you had to have,
you know,

1411
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:35.590
<v 4>okay,</v>

1412
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:37.810
<v 7>he never saw a black guy coming down the street.
You're like,
oh,</v>

1413
01:26:37.811 --> 01:26:41.140
this guy's going to rob me.
And then it turned out,
uh,
you know,

1414
01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:44.470
he just cured pancreatic cancer or some shit.
You know,
that never happened.

1415
01:26:44.471 --> 01:26:48.550
Who doesn't have that fucking story,
right?
It doesn't make you a bad person,

1416
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:53.770
but what he's supposed to do,
come of age when gangster rap is on the television,

1417
01:26:54.190 --> 01:26:57.880
you live in the white suburbs.
You don't know any better.
Um,

1418
01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:01.570
the fuck am I doing here?
Let me try to answer this question.
Well,

1419
01:27:01.571 --> 01:27:03.110
what the fuck was the question?
Um,

1420
01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:04.860
<v 4>okay.</v>

1421
01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:08.120
<v 7>Any advice on how to handle undeserved racism?</v>

1422
01:27:10.090 --> 01:27:13.210
A Cheetah?
I mean,
I dunno.
I Dunno what in tune.
In a perfect world,

1423
01:27:13.211 --> 01:27:16.150
you could go out there and beat the living shit out of him and everyone else

1424
01:27:16.151 --> 01:27:18.820
would cheer you on as you did it,
you know,

1425
01:27:18.821 --> 01:27:21.600
and then buy a drink for serving the country.
I mean,
that's,
you know,

1426
01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:25.000
the world I would like to live in.
You know,
you wouldn't kill those people.

1427
01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:28.210
Well I guess you would cause they're not going to change.
Yeah.
Fuck it.

1428
01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:29.810
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1429
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:33.200
<v 7>You know,
then I'll have to traffic a little bit.
Um,</v>

1430
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:35.740
I don't know what to tell you,
dude.
Well,
why don't you,
um,

1431
01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.430
I'm not trying to be an asshole here,
but I would,

1432
01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:42.460
I would probably not hang out with people who got drunk and suddenly started to

1433
01:27:42.981 --> 01:27:47.780
sound racist.
You know,
I would pick a better group of friends.
I mean,

1434
01:27:47.781 --> 01:27:49.640
it's bad enough.
You got to hear it from strangers.

1435
01:27:49.641 --> 01:27:53.090
I wouldn't want my inner circle of people like,
you know,

1436
01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:59.000
that's not a good thing.
That's not a good sign.
Do you know what?
I get drunk.

1437
01:27:59.001 --> 01:28:03.320
I like to explain stuff.
I don't just start,
you know,
putting on a Klan Hood.

1438
01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:09.740
So that would be my advice.
I would get some better friends.
And um,

1439
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:14.450
as far as helping your friends to understand what it's like to be a minority,

1440
01:28:14.451 --> 01:28:18.960
I just,
they're not going to be able to understand it.
Yeah.

1441
01:28:19.090 --> 01:28:22.750
It's,
they're just not,
they would have to,
uh,

1442
01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:27.070
move to South Africa and have a farm that was being taken away from him or some

1443
01:28:27.071 --> 01:28:30.690
shit.
Uh,
they'd have to do it like that,
you know?
I Dunno.

1444
01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:33.340
And even then they would still have the arrogance of a,

1445
01:28:33.341 --> 01:28:37.270
I am a fucking from the white race.
They'd still have that card to throw it down,

1446
01:28:37.271 --> 01:28:42.010
you know,
but it really got ugly,
you know?
So,
uh,
I don't think,
yeah,

1447
01:28:42.011 --> 01:28:44.980
I don't think somebody white could never understand that.
You know,

1448
01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:46.390
you can empathize,

1449
01:28:46.450 --> 01:28:49.690
you can listen to the stories and nod and have a concerned look on your face.

1450
01:28:49.691 --> 01:28:53.550
But at the end of the day,
you know,
I don't know,
but let me ask you this,

1451
01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:57.290
like Koreans.
All right.
Now as far as I know about Asia,

1452
01:28:57.370 --> 01:29:01.860
Japanese are sort of the white people have a of Asia,
you know.

1453
01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:05.820
Well they kind of don't take kindly consider themselves superior and they looked

1454
01:29:05.821 --> 01:29:08.220
down on the Chinese and the Koreans and that type of shit.

1455
01:29:08.221 --> 01:29:11.640
And they've kind of been a little cunty with their little shogun warrior

1456
01:29:11.641 --> 01:29:14.280
practices.
Is that what they tried to do?

1457
01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:17.490
The rape and Dan King and all that shit that they did in world war two,

1458
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:22.910
you know how to Koreans fail.
Why am I asking you this man?
You're from America.

1459
01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:24.220
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1460
01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:27.130
<v 7>Have you ever ran me and I haven't read any books on Ireland or Germany.</v>

1461
01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:32.470
I'm an asshole.
Yeah,
I wouldn't even fly by even listening to this.

1462
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:33.340
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1463
01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:38.170
<v 7>Um,
anyways,
you know what I would do?
Said Steve Bird in email,</v>

1464
01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:43.720
comedian Steve Byrne,
hilarious comedian and he is a,
he's half white,

1465
01:29:43.721 --> 01:29:45.180
half Korean.
I believe so.

1466
01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:47.380
<v 5>Uh,
yeah.</v>

1467
01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:49.700
<v 7>He'd probably tell you to punch him in the face if I know him.</v>

1468
01:29:49.730 --> 01:29:53.750
He likes to play hockey.
All right.
More overrated.
Underrated.
Uh,

1469
01:29:53.751 --> 01:29:57.380
I had a great time but you show in Cleveland.
Did it,
did it today.
Underrate.
Okay.

1470
01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:01.780
Um,
your,
um,
okay.
This heat,

1471
01:30:01.781 --> 01:30:05.950
this guy basically did an overrated,
underrated from the show that he saw me do.

1472
01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:09.610
He said underrated the way non smokers smell.

1473
01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:11.533
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1474
01:30:12.290 --> 01:30:16.190
<v 7>I'm not saying that your fans steak,
but sweet Jesus Christ.</v>

1475
01:30:16.191 --> 01:30:19.460
I kept looking around during your set because I could've sworn that someone was

1476
01:30:19.461 --> 01:30:23.090
smoking a cigarette,
especially those two Hicks who are heckling you.

1477
01:30:23.330 --> 01:30:27.480
How was behind them in line for your DVD and they just reeked of cheap tobacco

1478
01:30:27.481 --> 01:30:32.330
with booze.
I'm not some militant anti smoking guy.
As a matter of fact,

1479
01:30:32.331 --> 01:30:34.130
I quit smoking about four months ago.

1480
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:37.760
I've just horrified that I smelled that bad for 20 years and wasn't even aware

1481
01:30:37.761 --> 01:30:38.510
of it.

1482
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:42.680
Another underrated people who don't have to tell you every thought that pops

1483
01:30:42.681 --> 01:30:43.550
into their head.

1484
01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:48.980
The guy sitting behind me at your show was easily the guy who was laughing the

1485
01:30:48.981 --> 01:30:53.750
loudest,
which I'm guessing is good for you as a comedian.
A what you could hear.

1486
01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:57.950
Thankfully his,
the way he would comment on almost everything you said on stage.

1487
01:30:58.770 --> 01:30:59.603
<v 5>Uh,</v>

1488
01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:04.700
<v 7>now he goes to give some examples.
Uh,
what a great analogy bill just made.</v>

1489
01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:05.680
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

1490
01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:10.180
<v 7>that is really,
that is a really old reference.
That's hilarious.</v>

1491
01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:12.550
I can't believe bill just said that.
Jesus,

1492
01:31:12.551 --> 01:31:14.500
how did you not punch that guy in the throat?

1493
01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:18.580
And he said he did about a thousand more deep observations.

1494
01:31:18.581 --> 01:31:22.540
Obviously he's being sarcastic.
Uh,
I was glad he was,

1495
01:31:22.541 --> 01:31:24.190
enjoyed your show so much,
but fuck,

1496
01:31:24.191 --> 01:31:28.240
I just wanted to turn around and tell him it's okay to just think these things.

1497
01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:31.850
Dude.
You should have said that.
Uh,
you don't think,
uh,

1498
01:31:32.410 --> 01:31:35.280
you don't have to tell your buddy every reaction you're having a bill's chokes

1499
01:31:35.281 --> 01:31:37.240
save something for the ride home for Christ sake.

1500
01:31:37.241 --> 01:31:41.080
But I didn't say anything because I'm a peace loving pussy who just sits there

1501
01:31:41.081 --> 01:31:43.120
and lets people adore him.
Thanks for the great show.

1502
01:31:43.121 --> 01:31:46.630
It was nice to meet you afterwards.
All right,
dude.
Sorry you had that bad time.

1503
01:31:46.631 --> 01:31:47.590
Yeah,
that was a weird show.

1504
01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:52.990
I just had a couple of couple of drunks there who thought they were helping the

1505
01:31:52.991 --> 01:31:56.290
show and uh,
they weren't.

1506
01:31:56.860 --> 01:32:01.600
So I fucked with them a couple times and then I just had to deliberately make it

1507
01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:04.240
uncomfortable.
And then I got out of it.

1508
01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:07.090
Then what ended up happening was most people didn't even hear him.

1509
01:32:07.091 --> 01:32:11.710
So they were like,
what did they say?
What did they say?
They were yelling Jew.

1510
01:32:12.250 --> 01:32:14.650
And then they kept yelling,
faggot.
That's what they were doing.

1511
01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:18.940
I don't know why I made a reference to a drain and then they thought it would be

1512
01:32:18.941 --> 01:32:20.920
funny if they just kept yelling Jews.

1513
01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:28.600
I don't know why they were vibing on,
on some shit.

1514
01:32:28.601 --> 01:32:32.980
And then I was talking about some sort of homophobic thing and then they were

1515
01:32:32.981 --> 01:32:37.960
yelling,
you faggot,
you fucking faggot.
Faggot.
The whole,
the entire joke,

1516
01:32:37.961 --> 01:32:41.920
like every two and a half seconds.
Uh,

1517
01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:45.400
and in their world it was hilarious and it was helping my set.

1518
01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:49.640
So when are you going to do all right?
I,
uh,

1519
01:32:51.490 --> 01:32:52.810
I'm going to go take a bath.

1520
01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:59.290
It's a visual foyer.
I'm all fucking aches and pains here.

1521
01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:04.600
And I'm not going to fucking take a shower like a fucking man.
That's it.

1522
01:33:04.601 --> 01:33:08.440
That's the Monday morning podcast this week.
I apologize for the,
uh,

1523
01:33:08.890 --> 01:33:10.360
the nasal problems here,

1524
01:33:10.990 --> 01:33:14.740
and I apologize to my country downstairs neighbor.

1525
01:33:14.741 --> 01:33:18.910
Everybody have a great week.
And,
uh,
please come out and see me up in a,

1526
01:33:18.911 --> 01:33:21.940
the punchline up in Sacramento.
Um,

1527
01:33:22.450 --> 01:33:26.740
uninformed radio.com to listen to my radio show with the wonderful Joe Derosa,

1528
01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.440
the teen idol,
uh,
teen idols,

1529
01:33:29.441 --> 01:33:33.250
sensation of the opie and Anthony Radio Program on Sirius Xm.

1530
01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:35.710
What else can I hype?
I think that said,

1531
01:33:35.711 --> 01:33:40.270
go to [inaudible] dot com I owe about five people on my mailing lists away from

1532
01:33:40.271 --> 01:33:43.170
having 10,000 people on my mailing list.
And I would like to,

1533
01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:47.950
as a Christmas gift for four of you to sign up for it.
Could you do that?
Lovely.

1534
01:33:48.490 --> 01:33:50.780
And that's it.
You guys have a great week.
