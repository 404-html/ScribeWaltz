00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.190
Hey,
what's going on as bill burn?
It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.180
August 31st,

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.880
2015 August 31st as far as I know,

4
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:14.430
it's the last day of fuck kids.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.880
Maybe it isn't.
Maybe some of you consider a Labor Day.
You know,

6
00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:24.510
maybe some of you have those traditionalist where you can't wear white after

7
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:25.500
Labor Day.

8
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.120
Well tell it to that whore that was on that thing last night.

9
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:34.160
That fucking doesn't show videos anymore.
Um,

10
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.700
I am of course talking about the,
uh,
the MTV music awards,

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.980
which I gotta be honest with you.
I don't even know that they were on,

12
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.290
you had no idea.
My wife knew and she put them on.

13
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.170
And um,
I remember one point,
they were in the background,
they were showing the,

14
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.800
the old MTV logo and it was changing all colors and stuff.
And I just,

15
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:59.840
I always get sad when I see it.
Like,
what happened,
what happened and that,

16
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.080
where the fuck did they get off?
And I know I'm the 1000000th person to say this,

17
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:05.640
but where the fuck did they get off?
Yeah.

18
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.910
Why do they have a video music awards when they don't show any music videos?

19
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.460
<v 0>Okay.</v>

20
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.040
<v 1>You know what I mean?
Do I,
do I have a,</v>

21
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.480
I dunno to what do I host a fucking show about not being a colony?

22
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.890
It would be just as hypocritical.
Right?
By the way,

23
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:32.460
could that check be trying any fucking harder?
Good Lord,

24
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.673
we get it.

25
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.400
<v 0>Okay.</v>

26
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.020
<v 1>Those dumb ass outfits,
you know every fucking outfit looking like,</v>

27
00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:45.740
are you going to go fuck Captain Kirk
this soap?
I

28
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.400
go back and look,

29
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.420
look at some of the truly shocking shit that people did way back after.
You know,

30
00:01:52.421 --> 00:01:56.740
fucking freak me out a long time ago was Marilyn Manson.

31
00:01:56.741 --> 00:02:00.430
The first time that guy came out and he sang that beautiful people and he was,

32
00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:02.620
I don't know what the fuck he was wearing.
It was something,

33
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.310
I think it was that thing that women wore back in the day when they try to make

34
00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:09.010
their waste really small.
Is that a corset?

35
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.530
He had that and like his fucking awful ass hanging out and he had like these

36
00:02:14.531 --> 00:02:16.570
contact lenses that made them look like a hustle.

37
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.330
I was just like,
what the fuck is that?
You know,

38
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.140
running around out there like jail bait with the fucking tongue hanging out and

39
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:31.430
now you'll legal and
I was in the other room.
Right.

40
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.640
And uh,
you know,

41
00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:38.810
my wife has some family in town so she and some of the ladies were in there

42
00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:39.644
watching it.

43
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.100
<v 2>And uh,</v>

44
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.260
<v 1>so the fucking uh,
Captain Kirk's one night stand there.</v>

45
00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:49.650
What the fuck is in there?
I want to keep saying lady Gaga.
I know.
It's not that,

46
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.530
it's not Taylor swift.
That's two out of three though.

47
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.153
<v 2>MMM.</v>

48
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.540
<v 1>Miley Cyrus.
Miley Cyrus.</v>

49
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.870
So she's in there singing this fucking song over and over again about how she

50
00:03:04.561 --> 00:03:06.790
doesn't give a fuck at,
uh,

51
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.260
I felt bad for,
you know what I mean?
Cause you know,

52
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.210
with the music game,
it's like,
yeah,

53
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.220
you have your popular for a while and then it just fucking starts to go down and

54
00:03:20.791 --> 00:03:23.220
then maybe you get one more hit and then you fucking finished.

55
00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:27.550
And then for the rest of your life you got to sing those songs.
Sega guys,

56
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:32.040
this Shaw.
Yeah,
the piano.
Bad.
Say guys just saw tonight,

57
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.830
why do you think Billy Joel drinks so much?

58
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.340
He's got to sing the same fucking 20 songs for 40 years.
I mean,

59
00:03:38.341 --> 00:03:41.160
the fact that that man is still standing

60
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.400
<v 0>yeah.</v>

61
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.910
<v 1>Is a testament to his inner strength.</v>

62
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.150
I find to do the same fucking jokes for 20 years.

63
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.720
<v 0>Okay.</v>

64
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.320
<v 1>40 or 40 years you go back to fucking,
uh,</v>

65
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.930
I didn't want to do jokes I did fucking four years ago.

66
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.810
There's no way these two poor people and this poor woman,

67
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.030
Miley Cyrus is going to have to sing about how she doesn't give a fuck when

68
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:10.870
she's in her fifties and sixties.
You know what I mean?

69
00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:15.100
And she's painted herself into a corner wearing those star trek outfits.

70
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.550
No,
she hasn't.
Gee,
if I was her manager,
I say,
listen,

71
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.000
at some point you got to put your tongue away and,

72
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.460
and put some God damn clothes on.
Or uh,
you know,
um,

73
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.850
I'm going to leave right around when you're about 32 33 cause I'm not going to

74
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.270
watch this fucking train wreck.

75
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.490
<v 0>Okay.</v>

76
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.780
<v 1>Like what's her face?
Uh,
Madonna,
I mean Mcdonald's pushing 60,</v>

77
00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:42.000
and she still has to go out there and fish nets,

78
00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:45.000
rubber and a clam because that's what God are there.

79
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.220
<v 0>Okay.</v>

80
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.860
<v 1>You know what I mean?
I mean,
she should be,
I mean,
she's a month,</v>

81
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.350
so I'm still somebody's mom.
She has like grown up kids.

82
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.980
She's still trying to hide behind that.
Ah,

83
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.620
I was trying to break down the boundaries of what you picture when you picture a

84
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:03.490
58 year a woman.
Yeah.
You're really not,

85
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.080
it's just like a growing up and having a little bit of class and admitting that

86
00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:13.030
you know,
those days are behind you and enjoying your kids.
Right.

87
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:16.900
That's what I would think
you run around.

88
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.250
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

89
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.460
<v 1>Wait a minute.
I mean,
old rock star is still running around grabbing that Dick's.</v>

90
00:05:22.461 --> 00:05:23.960
I know God knows Billy idol is.

91
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.090
Um,
I dunno,
maybe I'm wrong on this one.
I have no idea.

92
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:37.450
But you really got to,
I would think if I,
if I was a musician,

93
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:38.440
which I'm clearly not

94
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.750
<v 0>okay</v>

95
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.130
<v 1>in the back of my head as much as I had to be present and who the fuck I was</v>

96
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.720
when I was writing songs,
there would be something that's going like,
hey,

97
00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:50.250
you know,
if this is a giant hit,

98
00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:52.920
I'm going to have to sing this in a casino when I'm 60.

99
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.070
You know what I mean?
It's going to be 60 years old going,

100
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.560
<v 0>yeah,
smoke weed.
I don't give a fuck.
Right.</v>

101
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.790
Fucking jelly.
Roll's hanging out of that fucking outfit.
Um,

102
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.850
I dunno the fuck do I know?

103
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.650
Don't you got to do maybe just give it a funny intro to be all right.

104
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:20.630
This next song I wrote when I was 21,
uh,
within the first half of line of lyrics,

105
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:22.530
you're going to realize it.
Oh,

106
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.870
forgive me as I roll my eyes when I sing this fucking thing.
Um,

107
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.170
<v 1>Oh my God,
Jesus Christ,
that's going to come back to haunt you.</v>

108
00:06:32.171 --> 00:06:36.100
I worry about that.
You know about ever becoming a fucking parent,
you know,

109
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.130
is uh,
some of the bits that I've done coming back and blowing back in my face.

110
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.173
You know what I mean?

111
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.640
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

112
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.820
<v 1>I just said,
hey,
you know,
I,
you know,
I'm,</v>

113
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.840
I was an idiot and a kind of still am but a legally you have to do what I say

114
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.930
within reason.
Sorry.

115
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.930
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

116
00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.770
<v 1>Would you like some fruit loops?
Um,
I don't know how you'd do it.</v>

117
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.200
You know what it is.
I don't give a shit about any of those things,

118
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.080
those fucking video awards.
You know what it really is?

119
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.740
I just wished an MTV still played music so I could stay up on it rather than

120
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:14.510
just no one who liked the f five pop stars are,
you know what I mean?

121
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.200
Like how many times are they going to keep going back to Taylor swift and Kanye

122
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.060
West?
That's just like,
is there anybody new Kanye west Taylor swift,

123
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.480
Miley Cyrus fucking,
uh,
uh,

124
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.340
that chick there with the booty.
The fuck is her name.

125
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:36.740
She's always arguing with people on Twitter.
I just had it.
Nicki Minaj,

126
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:42.080
those same four people have been on every fuck that same award show for like 10

127
00:07:42.081 --> 00:07:46.130
years at this point.
I see that show like once every three fucking years.

128
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:47.480
It's the same God damn people.

129
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.480
Even Justin Timberlake went home at some point like guys,

130
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:52.740
since they don't show videos anymore,
it's fucking over,

131
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.503
<v 0>right?</v>

132
00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:00.140
<v 1>I don't know the fuck do I know?
Um,
anyways,
uh,</v>

133
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:04.070
this is the Monday morning podcast.
I'm running my Yap here and a dude,

134
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:09.100
this is the last day of August in which means obviously tomorrow is September

135
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.680
1st and September.

136
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.340
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this is the greatest fucking month of

137
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.250
the year and starts the greatest four months of the year.

138
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.180
It's football season.
Baseball is,

139
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.980
is her hurdling towards the fucking,
uh,

140
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.370
hurdling are hurling cruising.

141
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.000
We'll pick a word I can use crucial towards the playoffs.

142
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.400
Hockey and hoops startup,
right?
You got thanksgiving,

143
00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:44.600
which is the shit.
And then you got Christmas,
which is awesome.

144
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.820
If you married the right person

145
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.300
or you're not in jail right now,
he's heard the holidays.

146
00:08:53.301 --> 00:08:57.290
We'll rough when you fucking locked down if listening to this somehow in jail.

147
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.640
Uh,
I don't know what to tell you.
I'm sorry about that.
You know,

148
00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:04.070
I hope you're right.
He's nine.
I hope you're ready to send IOP.
Did it?

149
00:09:04.071 --> 00:09:08.000
Jesus Christ.
Are you going to sit there eating that fucking slop?
Um,

150
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:09.643
anyways,

151
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.120
I wonder if they actually have a reprieve in prison during the holidays.

152
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.013
You know what I mean?

153
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:19.010
Like for like one day everyone can just walk around the yard and act like it's

154
00:09:19.011 --> 00:09:21.160
like central park.
Uh,

155
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.620
the I the idea idealistic version of central park where you could just sort of

156
00:09:24.621 --> 00:09:27.680
skip around with birds.
Like you're in a Walt Disney movie,
you know,

157
00:09:27.681 --> 00:09:32.240
without the antisemitism of Walt Walt [inaudible].

158
00:09:32.241 --> 00:09:33.980
Walt's,
they're not all bad.

159
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.210
How many times do you think they said that to him as he was drawing Pluto?
Um,

160
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.500
anyways,
so my big plans for this week,

161
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.360
aside from this is the final fucking week of my diet to get down to the weight

162
00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:49.550
that I want to be at.
Um,

163
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.600
Thursday afternoon I'm going to a sick cow,
blah.

164
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.111
And,
uh,

165
00:09:55.111 --> 00:09:58.180
I say Thursday afternoon because the games come on early out here and I'm going

166
00:09:58.181 --> 00:10:02.430
to watch the beginning
of,

167
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:07.110
of the Michigan wolverines turning their football program around.

168
00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:08.973
<v 2>Huh?</v>

169
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:15.010
<v 1>Making the Ohio State Michigan game and actual factor again for the first time</v>

170
00:10:15.231 --> 00:10:19.640
in 15 years.
Jim Harbaugh,
ah,
I'm telling you if you,

171
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.000
you guys got us,
if he didn't look at it already,
just Google a picture.

172
00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:26.720
Jim Harba first pitch Detroit Tigers.

173
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.400
Just look at that.
That guy is a fucking animal.
He's a maniac.

174
00:10:31.401 --> 00:10:35.420
He's such as psycho grown men at the professional level.

175
00:10:35.421 --> 00:10:38.150
Couldn't handle them anymore in San Francisco.

176
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.920
And now he's going to Michigan where they don't make any money,

177
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.540
at least illegally.
Right?

178
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.600
<v 2>Okay.</v>

179
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.660
<v 1>They got to do what the fuck he says,
I'm telling you,
within two years,</v>

180
00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:50.010
this guy's going to turn this thing around.

181
00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:52.380
I think they're going to make major leaps.
I'm hoping they are.

182
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.940
And all of a sudden that song will be able to be sung with pride again.

183
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.030
Come on Buckeye fans.
Sing it with me.
Huh?

184
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:05.090
Hail to the victors val yet hail to the victors val.

185
00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:07.410
Yet hail.
Hail.

186
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:11.190
Tobish Shagan does Schomp then add something?

187
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.840
Um,
you know,
I think the number one reason why Ohio state's a hate,

188
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.260
hate Michigan is because they don't have as good a fight song.

189
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.230
Nobody knows what the fight song is for Ohio state.
They don't,

190
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:26.820
as much as woody Hayes jumped up and down and it had a temper Tantrum,

191
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.580
nobody gave a fuck about that song.
I don't know why.

192
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.010
There's like three songs that everybody knows.
They know that one.

193
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.420
Then I know yet bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,

194
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:40.430
bad Jesus labs as fuck and best and then the USC Trojans,

195
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:45.390
which is the worst.
I feel like I could have wrote that song.
Bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,

196
00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:47.940
bad,
bad.
Do they play that song?

197
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:52.310
The reason number one reason why I fucking hate USC is a,
well,

198
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.740
when I was younger,
I a Notre Dame fan.
Then somewhere around the Lou Holtz,

199
00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:56.850
I've talked about this before,

200
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.750
when sometime around the Lou Holtz when he was holier than thou and go,
yeah,

201
00:12:00.751 --> 00:12:05.730
you need to do you believe you all that dumb shit.

202
00:12:05.731 --> 00:12:10.530
And he was just like,
okay.
Trying to claim that they weren't doing steroids yet.

203
00:12:10.531 --> 00:12:12.960
They were just as big as teams that were doing steroids.

204
00:12:12.961 --> 00:12:17.580
It's just that classic religious God loves us best.
Touchdown,

205
00:12:17.581 --> 00:12:19.980
Jesus horseshit.
Once I got older,
it started to annoy me,

206
00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.290
but when they got really bad,

207
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.770
I don't want to see that happen the same way I hated watch your Michigan get

208
00:12:25.771 --> 00:12:26.550
really bad.

209
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.100
I would hate to see that happen to our house state and I'm one of those weird

210
00:12:29.101 --> 00:12:32.970
people because I lived in Massachusetts.
Um,

211
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.660
I like Ohio state and Michigan,
which makes no fucking sense,

212
00:12:36.661 --> 00:12:40.320
but I like both of them and I want them to be both be great and kick the shit

213
00:12:40.321 --> 00:12:43.200
out of each other in November.
Is that asking too much?
I don't think it is,

214
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:49.140
but getting back to USC,
those motherfuckers play
that song,

215
00:12:49.141 --> 00:12:52.380
which isn't a bad song.
It's just they pummel you with it.

216
00:12:52.381 --> 00:12:56.040
It's like a fucking Beyonce song by the end of the first quarter.
It's like,

217
00:12:56.041 --> 00:12:58.170
I got it.
This song has been released.

218
00:12:59.330 --> 00:12:59.870
<v 0>Okay.</v>

219
00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:03.790
<v 1>What if I,
if I pay 99 cents and downloaded on the iTunes kick,</v>

220
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:07.100
can you stop playing it at least for eight fucking seconds?

221
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.900
Those stupid cunts at USC.
Okay.

222
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.160
They play that song every they,
they,
they,

223
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.870
<v 0>yeah,</v>

224
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:18.770
<v 1>they,
they break the huddle on,
they play it.
Like that was some accomplishment.</v>

225
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.620
Hey,
they're all on the same page and they're gonna try to execute this play.

226
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.710
It drives me up the fucking wall.
Like whenever I watch a USC game,

227
00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.730
I just have my thumb on the mute button and I swear to God by the end of it,

228
00:13:28.731 --> 00:13:32.480
I have like,
is it possible to have carpal tunnel in your thumb or whatever,

229
00:13:32.481 --> 00:13:37.310
whatever the,
the,
the fucking tendon is in my forum.
It's a little sore there.

230
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:41.900
Right.
And then when I watched the late game,
I got my forearm and Ben Gay.

231
00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.250
Um,
and I know what the fuck I'm talking about.
So anyways,
this is,
um,

232
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.400
<v 0>okay.</v>

233
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.400
<v 1>So I had my way in yesterday.
I'm actually doing this podcast Monday morning.</v>

234
00:13:50.401 --> 00:13:52.620
I've been doing,
I'm Sunday nights recently,
but uh,

235
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:57.000
so I had my way and yesterday I had to get down to one 65,
um,

236
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.170
after a loss last week.
And the question was,

237
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:07.150
was a old Billy fucking flabby tits going to be fought?

238
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:10.230
Wait,
why?
Why?
I mean,
let's see.
I know what the fuck my record is.

239
00:14:10.231 --> 00:14:13.740
I know I had two losses.
All right.

240
00:14:13.741 --> 00:14:18.450
First Week on went down to one 83,
then down to one 80.
Then I had a loss.

241
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:22.350
Then once 77,
one 7,471,
then I had a loss

242
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.020
then.
Uh,
no,
I won that one.

243
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:33.100
Then I lost the next week.
All right,
so this,

244
00:14:33.101 --> 00:14:36.520
this week would be to see if I'd be five and three or six and two,

245
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.900
five and three.
The season's starting to slip away.

246
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.140
Is there a trouble and freckle town?
How'd you get down to a buck 65?

247
00:14:45.141 --> 00:14:45.974
And God dammit,

248
00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:51.190
I got on the scale and I was drum roll one 65.0 made.

249
00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.130
I made it.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

250
00:14:56.131 --> 00:14:58.320
I had to go fucking skip rope for a couple of rounds,

251
00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:01.680
the drop some waterway to make weight and my buddy goes,
dude,
that's cheating.

252
00:15:01.681 --> 00:15:04.830
I'm like,
no,
it isn't.
It's not fucking cheating.
All right,

253
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.370
you're negative comment.
It's not fucking cheating.

254
00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.920
Fighters do that all the time to make weight.

255
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.860
All I'm trying to do is make weight and I,
I,

256
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:17.850
I've weighed myself throughout all of this right after I worked out.

257
00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.790
That is when I've weighed myself,
so that is consistent.

258
00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:23.610
Now I know that I weigh a couple more pounds over that,

259
00:15:23.611 --> 00:15:27.990
maybe even three more pounds over that.
All right,
but this is working for me,

260
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:32.110
so shut your fucking pie hole.
So this deal,

261
00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:36.480
when I get down to a buck 62 next week,
which is the way I want it to be,

262
00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.080
so I'll be one 62 after my workout.
All right.

263
00:15:40.081 --> 00:15:42.330
Now what most people do at that point,
they go,
hey,

264
00:15:42.331 --> 00:15:45.360
I made it and I'm going to have a cheeseburger and fries and become a fucking

265
00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:47.910
addict again.
Sugar,
salt shows,
I'll shoot us all right.

266
00:15:47.911 --> 00:15:51.030
Doing that shit when I'm going to then do is try to,

267
00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:55.440
I'm going to start weighing myself after lunch,
seeing what that number is,

268
00:15:55.441 --> 00:15:59.490
and then I'll get down to one 62 weighing myself after lunch every day.

269
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:03.480
So there you go.
I'm doing it in baby steps.
Go Fuck Yourself.
I'm an old man.

270
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:08.940
Um,
so anyways,
uh,
yeah,
I'm psyched.

271
00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.090
I knew if I talked about this shit on the podcast,

272
00:16:12.091 --> 00:16:13.440
I would have done it because if I didn't,

273
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.700
if I was just doing it on my own and they didn't have you guys hypothetically in

274
00:16:17.701 --> 00:16:21.750
my fucking ear given me shit that I'm a loser because I didn't make it,

275
00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.530
I probably would've stopped around a buck 72 of,
hey,
I'm going to be good.

276
00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:31.380
They can get out of a fucking cookie.
Um,
but this morning,
uh,

277
00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.840
today's like technically my day off.
So,
uh,

278
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.450
on my day off I still go do something because I'm at that age.

279
00:16:36.451 --> 00:16:39.740
If I take a day off,
I'm still fucked.
Even if I eat well,
I don't understand.

280
00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:44.760
I have to do something.
So,
um,
every fourth day,
my day off.
Right.

281
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.190
I do chest and Tris,
I do the fucking,
uh,
pull ups and all that shit the next day.

282
00:16:50.191 --> 00:16:52.170
And then the next day I do legs.

283
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:57.000
And then on my day off I have to do something,
go for a walk or whatever.

284
00:16:57.001 --> 00:17:00.060
But lately I've been riding a bike and,
uh,

285
00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:05.540
so I'm riding up through the fucking hills out here and uh,

286
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.090
I'm fucking dying,
right?

287
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:14.010
I'm standing up in first and like first,
like the,

288
00:17:14.011 --> 00:17:18.480
the easiest gear and I'm probably like gear six,
you know,
we get,
you got one,

289
00:17:18.481 --> 00:17:20.250
two and three.
As far as level of difficulty,

290
00:17:20.251 --> 00:17:23.700
I'm on one and I think I'm on gear for and I'm standing up.

291
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:27.390
<v 2>Mm.
Every</v>

292
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.320
<v 1>fucking you know,
pedal that I'm doing right.
Every revolution.</v>

293
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:35.340
And then I'm hearing this guy coming right up behind me and I'm just going off,

294
00:17:35.341 --> 00:17:36.031
fuck this.
You know,

295
00:17:36.031 --> 00:17:40.260
here comes one of these fucking guys just gonna fucking blow by me in this dude.

296
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.300
I thought it was,
but I thought it was gonna be somebody in their 20s,

297
00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.100
maybe early thirties.

298
00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:49.170
This fucking old man with his old legs with elasticity.

299
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.140
His legs gone.
Fucking blows by me,

300
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.180
blows by me still sitting in his seat on the bicycle.

301
00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:02.520
Didn't even say hello.
He just went right by me.
I'm not even joking.

302
00:18:02.521 --> 00:18:05.250
I know that sounds like a hacky fucking joke.
I swear to God.

303
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:09.210
And then within two turns,
I couldn't see him anymore.

304
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:12.930
He was gone and I was looking all the way up the hill and I just see this

305
00:18:12.931 --> 00:18:16.740
fucking little guy all the way up the hill.
You know,

306
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.530
I was riding through the canyons and I'm looking all at the hill gone.

307
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:23.430
That's not him.
And I'm trying to look like between that guy,

308
00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:24.780
whoever the fuck that guy is,

309
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.990
and me as we're going around the tone and turned out it was him.

310
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:32.150
He just fucking smoked.
Absolutely smoked me.
But um,

311
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.480
whatever we going to do.
But you don't spend motivate me to ride the bike every,

312
00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:40.950
every fourth day.
It was Versie forsee going,
dude,
getting a bike at your,
eh,
no.

313
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.460
That's the biggest fucking waste of money.
His head,
that's in my head.

314
00:18:44.461 --> 00:18:46.620
Every time I look at the bike,
I'm like,

315
00:18:46.621 --> 00:18:49.950
I got to fucking put a hundred miles on that bike by the end of this year.

316
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.270
You know,
cause forsee is coming out this year.

317
00:18:54.271 --> 00:18:56.370
I believe he's going to go to the rose bowl with this.

318
00:18:56.371 --> 00:18:57.990
So at some point when I'm hammered,

319
00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.230
I'm going to have to say it to him versus he not for fucking nothing.

320
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.650
Not for nothing.
I put a hundred miles out of miles in that bicycle.
Ah,

321
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.090
look at this.
That fucking stomach flat.
All right.

322
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.733
Um,

323
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:16.500
you know what kills me is I'm basically at a weight where I used to have abs and

324
00:19:16.501 --> 00:19:19.410
I don't anymore because once you get the fucking stomach get done,

325
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.420
and I've been watching all these videos on how to get the fucking last,
you know,

326
00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:29.120
right now I have the Cli,
I have the quintessential cunt belly.
Like you could

327
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:30.783
<v 3>good.</v>

328
00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:35.750
<v 1>You could fucking put me.
Ah,
I want to warn you right now.</v>

329
00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.690
This is going to be such a horrific visual,
but I got to do it.

330
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:43.990
You could put me in a pair of ladies Bikini Bottoms,

331
00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.193
right?

332
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.850
And just just take a picture of my belly hanging over him and nothing else.

333
00:19:49.851 --> 00:19:50.950
And you would think it was chicken.

334
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.103
<v 3>Okay.</v>

335
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.890
<v 1>Oh,
that's adorable.
I wonder how old her taught her toddler is.</v>

336
00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:00.040
I have a little bit of baby fat here.
I got a baby bump.

337
00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:05.140
It's almost worse than my beer belly.
The beer belly was really masculine.

338
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.610
You know what I mean?
That was becoming a big fucking teddy bear.
Like,
ah,

339
00:20:09.611 --> 00:20:12.820
you know,
you know women love and when that guy's a little fat,

340
00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:17.350
they love that Shit.
You know?
No other women are going to be looking at them.

341
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.830
They don't have to be intimidated that he's looking at her and says certain

342
00:20:20.831 --> 00:20:24.310
fucking way.
Cause you know he's over there crushing it on the elliptical.

343
00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:28.540
They like it.
They like when you are fucking dope.
That's like my wife.

344
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:32.380
She will not give me a fucking compliment.
I swear to God.

345
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:37.570
I swear to God you're not.
They'd say you go out and in like,
you know,

346
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.290
you end up marrying somebody just like your mom.
My mom was like that.
My mom.

347
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.250
Yeah.
I swear to God,

348
00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.710
never navigate our compliments ever,
you know?

349
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.010
And I was thinking,
ah,
yeah,
you know,
she's so fucking,

350
00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.310
<v 0>yeah,</v>

351
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:56.600
<v 1>positive.
She says unbelievers,
this force,
her personality is incredible,</v>

352
00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.200
but when it,
you know,
whenever I'm fucking doing something,
like,
you know,

353
00:21:00.201 --> 00:21:04.320
I learned something on the drums,
I go up and crush it as a comic or whatever.

354
00:21:04.321 --> 00:21:09.050
I never,
not how fucking peep,
not a peep.

355
00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:11.750
She says it to her friends.

356
00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:15.590
I hear her compliments to me through her fucking friends.
That's how I hear it.

357
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:19.310
So the whole time,
right.
I'm sitting there,
you know,
as I'm dropping the weight,

358
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.750
you know,
I'm gonna to check it out.
I'm looking good.
Right?
Am I looking good?

359
00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.740
She'd be like,
yeah,
you're looking good.
My,
come on man,

360
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:30.170
we typed drop like fucking six pounds.
She's like,
Bill,
I said,
you look good.

361
00:21:30.171 --> 00:21:32.930
Jesus Christ.
Like that's the best I would get out of it.

362
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:37.340
And I'm such an insecure asshole.
I keep coming back,
you know,

363
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.140
like looking for this,
like does parental approval from her.

364
00:21:42.141 --> 00:21:45.050
I gotta I gotta get past that.
That's what I've learned throughout all of this.

365
00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.600
I know.
I look good.
I only her,

366
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:54.390
um,
anyways,
the fuck am I talking about here?

367
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:59.160
A 21 minutes in Jesus Christ.
It's time for a little bit of advertising here.
Um,

368
00:21:59.161 --> 00:22:03.120
so that's the deal,
dude.
So,
um,
um,
I'm not gonna lie to you dude.

369
00:22:03.121 --> 00:22:07.470
I like to make weight this week because I fucked up so bad the previous week.
Uh,

370
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:12.280
I got on the scale and I was one 65.8 and then I went in the garage and I

371
00:22:12.281 --> 00:22:13.360
finished my workout.

372
00:22:13.361 --> 00:22:17.800
And then just to make doubly sure I skipped rope for six rounds.

373
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:22.000
MMM.
Does poor and sweat.

374
00:22:22.001 --> 00:22:26.210
And then I came back in and I got on the scale and I was like one 63 point

375
00:22:26.211 --> 00:22:29.920
something,
which I know is bullshit.
I'm probably about,
honestly,
after lunch,

376
00:22:29.921 --> 00:22:33.610
walking around,
I'm probably like one 67,
one 68,
but I made weight.

377
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:37.870
So go fuck yourself.
That's a victory.
All right.
You can't get me.

378
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.800
I wanted on a technicality.
This isn't some Bella check cheating.

379
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.750
It was more gym or say in that I'm not going to get in trouble for it.
Um,

380
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.950
but by,
by Bob Boto Podo put it to put it.
Can't believe it.

381
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.610
I can't fucking wait.
I love September.
I love the,

382
00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:56.271
I'm one of those people,

383
00:22:56.271 --> 00:22:58.310
I love the end of the year and the beginning of the year.

384
00:22:58.311 --> 00:23:02.420
It's these middle fucking months here that drive me fucking nuts with the summer

385
00:23:02.421 --> 00:23:05.330
heat.
I love the beginning of the year where it's like,
oh man,

386
00:23:05.331 --> 00:23:07.970
fucking a whole year clean slate.

387
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:12.680
What are we going to try to fucking fix?
What do we try to get better at?

388
00:23:12.681 --> 00:23:14.930
All that type of shit.
What do I want to do?
Right.

389
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:18.590
And then I loved the end of the end of the year,
you know,

390
00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:23.150
cause it's just like,
man,
I'm so happy to all these people in my life,
man.

391
00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:27.320
You know,
as football,
it's fucking great.
It's,

392
00:23:27.321 --> 00:23:31.990
it's really,
I think it's just August.
I fucking hate August.

393
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.420
I don't hate it.
Hate it.
I just,

394
00:23:34.421 --> 00:23:36.880
it's just too fucking hot living out here in the desert,

395
00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:41.680
living out here in the desert.
Um,
all right,

396
00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:45.750
let's get to the fucking,
uh,
let's get to the things here.
Oh,
by the way,

397
00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:49.480
by the way,
I'm supposed to read this here.
Oh,
hey,
please.

398
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:53.520
I got to thank everybody who bought court McCown's comedy album.
Uh,

399
00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:58.230
people who didn't get it can get it at www dot all things,
comedy.com,

400
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:03.330
uh,
the podcast network for the people.
Um,

401
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.220
oh and by the way,

402
00:24:05.221 --> 00:24:10.221
next week we have some old friends are returning some old friends,

403
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:16.260
not going to be returning to the uh,
the advertising portion of the program.

404
00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:21.870
Uh,
you might,
uh,
how can I tease that they are a game of skill.
Wink,

405
00:24:21.871 --> 00:24:26.250
wink.
Um,
and we're happy to have him back there.
Good sports about it.
All right.

406
00:24:26.251 --> 00:24:27.300
So uh,
I will,

407
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.530
I will respect their copy as much as I can

408
00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.790
do all this shave club.

409
00:24:35.791 --> 00:24:39.470
Everybody's stopped shaving with an old razor.

410
00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:42.450
It's gross.
Why?

411
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:48.200
Why are you torturing yourself with the gross old blade week after God Damn

412
00:24:49.961 --> 00:24:50.800
Week?
You know,

413
00:24:50.801 --> 00:24:54.090
probably part of it is cause you don't want to shell out 20 bucks for a pack of

414
00:24:54.091 --> 00:24:55.290
new ones.
Well,

415
00:24:55.291 --> 00:25:00.090
dollar shave club has revolutionized the way men shave with dollar shave club.

416
00:25:00.091 --> 00:25:04.080
You can shave with a fresh blade as often as you want because they deliver a

417
00:25:04.081 --> 00:25:06.120
whole sleeves of amazing,

418
00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.210
a whole sleeve of amazing razors for just a few bucks a month.

419
00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:13.260
The razors are so good.
Millions of guys have joined.
This is a no brainer.

420
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.740
Even the billion dollar razor corporations are freaking out,

421
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:19.230
but instead of lowering their bloated prices,

422
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:24.060
they're trying to fool you into milking the same blade for an entire month.

423
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.450
And that's gross.
They've priced gouged us for long enough.

424
00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:30.630
I wish this guy was around whoever started this company back when they were

425
00:25:30.631 --> 00:25:33.650
killing us on cds,
compact discs.

426
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:38.100
I'm never go back to squeezing weeks and weeks of shaves out of uh,

427
00:25:38.101 --> 00:25:39.810
out of a disgusting Rusty Blade,

428
00:25:39.811 --> 00:25:42.900
joined dollar shave club and use a fresh blade whenever you want.

429
00:25:42.901 --> 00:25:45.330
It feels amazing and it's a third of the price.

430
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:49.230
Join the millions of others who've joined,
uh,

431
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:53.670
who figured out the smarter way to shave.

432
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.990
Join Dollar Shave club now by going to dollar shave club.com/spur that's dollar

433
00:25:57.991 --> 00:26:01.320
shave club.com/bar do you realize what this guy did?

434
00:26:01.321 --> 00:26:04.650
This guy is so brilliant who started this company,
it was just

435
00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:07.623
<v 0>like</v>

436
00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:14.020
<v 1>razor blades are probably marked up like what?</v>

437
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.690
Conceding this guy can sell them for a dollar.

438
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.780
They have to be marked up like 15000%

439
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:21.250
<v 0>okay.</v>

440
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:24.920
<v 1>Or 20,000 or whatever the fucking percentages.
And this guy was just like,
yeah,</v>

441
00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:29.300
fine.
I'll just mark them up 1000%.
It's like,

442
00:26:29.301 --> 00:26:34.100
what's his face in a,
it's like that guy that figured out how to pick the mark,

443
00:26:34.101 --> 00:26:37.930
the uh,
pick the uh,
parking meters and said,

444
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:39.970
I ain't go rob a fucking bank.
They got cameras.

445
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:44.490
I'll just fucking take the change.
Well,
and eventually allowed up to my fortune.

446
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.500
Granted,
the guy got caught.
It's like,
what should prior and that superman movie,

447
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:53.910
whether it was at half a cent leftover and everybody's fucking paycheck,
right?

448
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:58.890
And then he just took the half a cent times a zillion fucking people.

449
00:26:58.891 --> 00:27:03.690
Then all of a sudden he had half a zillion Penny's bill.
We get it.
All right.

450
00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:04.800

They've created a better way for your spouse to take control of your family's

458
00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:33.540
future.
Wait a minute.
What about me?
My dead at this point.

459
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.250
Why don't want to give my spouse control?
I don't like the way that was worded.

467
00:27:59.461 --> 00:28:02.730
independent attorneys in most states since they're not a law firm.

468
00:28:02.731 --> 00:28:07.260
I think that's one of the worst written state sentences ever of attorneys in

469
00:28:07.261 --> 00:28:10.370
most states since they're not a law firm.
What is this sense?

470
00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.390
They're not a lot from that little tag there,

471
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:17.010
hanging off there like some sort of appendix drives me nuts every week.

don't procrastinate when it comes to protecting your family.

Uh,

484
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:03.400
so anyways,
what a fucking week.
What a fucking sports week.

485
00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.540
Tennis fans or even non tennis fans,

486
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:11.700
US Open starts this week.
Starts today actually.
And,
uh,

487
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.220
after reading that Andre Agassi book,

488
00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:17.610
I feel like I can watch it much better than I used to watch it.
You know what?

489
00:29:17.611 --> 00:29:19.110
It's funny,
I used to sit there,

490
00:29:19.111 --> 00:29:22.260
I used to get tired when I used to love watching women's tennis,

491
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.350
aside from the fact that they will hot,
you know,

492
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:29.230
running around with the fucking little skirts on there.
Um,

493
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:30.990
it was only the best two out of three.

494
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.470
So I could sit there and watch the whole fucking thing,
uh,
the men set.

495
00:29:34.471 --> 00:29:37.870
When I would go five fucking sets,
I'd be like,
Jesus Christ,
this is,
you know,

496
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.410
three,
four hours.
And now that I've actually read Agassi's book,

497
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.700
because I'm such a self-involved Douche bag,
I never sat there and wondered like,

498
00:29:45.701 --> 00:29:49.090
wait a minute,
like a football game takes three hours.

499
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:53.860
Baseball game takes three hours,
but you don't get the ball every fucking play.

500
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:59.270
These guys are like running backs,
running the ball for three to four hours.
Um,

501
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.400
I don't think I ever fully appreciated,

502
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:04.770
<v 0>yeah,</v>

503
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:09.390
<v 1>the physical condition that you have to be in to,
uh,
to play that game.</v>

504
00:30:09.391 --> 00:30:14.230
So I'm really excited to,
um,
to watch it this year.
You know,

505
00:30:14.231 --> 00:30:17.510
even like the earlier rounds or whatever,
now that I,
I can't,

506
00:30:17.511 --> 00:30:19.230
can't recommend that book enough and I feel like I've,

507
00:30:19.231 --> 00:30:21.360
I've recommended it so much.
I'm starting to know you guys,

508
00:30:21.361 --> 00:30:25.020
so I'm going to get off the subject.
I watched a little baseball this week.

509
00:30:25.021 --> 00:30:27.180
I actually watched a Yankees Braves game.

510
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.840
I keep missing the games with this score and like 20 runs and then they have

511
00:30:30.841 --> 00:30:34.530
like the fucking outfielder come in to pitch.
But,
um,

512
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:40.140
I gotta tell you,
man,
I am envious of what a,
the Yankees have done man.

513
00:30:40.141 --> 00:30:44.700
Like they,
they kept it to number one,
uh,
prospects,

514
00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.670
that kid bird.
And then that picture I got,

515
00:30:47.671 --> 00:30:52.410
got to watch that kid 21 years old man,
fucking crushing it on the mound.

516
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:57.270
Um,
and then some guy in the,
in the broadcast booth goes,
you know,

517
00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.390
do you know this is not what they used to do.
They,

518
00:31:00.391 --> 00:31:02.880
you still always try to buy it and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

519
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.340
And it's just like,
no,
they've done this before.

520
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:10.290
When George Steinbrenner got suspended because he got suspended,

521
00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:13.410
they ended up not trading away.

522
00:31:13.411 --> 00:31:17.460
Passata I don't think they have already traded away Jeter,
but Jeter,

523
00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.280
Bernie Williams,
Andy Pettitte,

524
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.460
Jorge Posada and Marianna Rivera.

525
00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.920
If George Steinbrenner did not get suspended,

526
00:31:25.921 --> 00:31:29.310
there's no fucking way he wouldn't have traded away at least three of those and

527
00:31:29.311 --> 00:31:30.150
one of them would have,

528
00:31:30.151 --> 00:31:34.960
I bet he would have traded away Marianna Rivera because at first they had him

529
00:31:34.961 --> 00:31:37.590
pitch in like,
you know,
seventh and eighth innings or whatever.

530
00:31:37.591 --> 00:31:39.510
He wasn't a fucking start.
He would have tossed him.

531
00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:42.600
He definitely would have got rid of Andy Pettitte Christ's he did it anyways.

532
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:47.250
Bernie Williams,
he would have probably got an impatient with Jorge Posada.

533
00:31:47.251 --> 00:31:51.300
He would have just tossed in there.
You would have made some dumb move like that.

534
00:31:51.301 --> 00:31:53.110
So I dunno,

535
00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:57.750
I just feel like the way Tampa is doing it and the way Kansas City is doing it,

536
00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:03.180
um,
I think was always the way to do it.

537
00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:04.440
It's still the way to do it.

538
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:08.520
I just think what the Yankees did and then the Red Sox,
you know,

539
00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.090
doing it too and a couple other teams.
I mean,

540
00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:16.060
you're just not successful when you do it for the most part.

541
00:32:16.061 --> 00:32:19.450
And then you've blown 180 to $200 million.
Look at us.

542
00:32:19.451 --> 00:32:23.620
How much fucking money did we spend?
We are 12 and a half games out of first

543
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:29.260
just wallowing around in the fucking sell off.
Um,

544
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:31.360
so,
I mean,

545
00:32:31.361 --> 00:32:34.180
I don't hate the Yankees the way I used to itself where we won three world

546
00:32:34.181 --> 00:32:34.960
series.
I mean it's,

547
00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:39.560
the fucking movie ended when we came back and oh for and won the world series.

548
00:32:39.561 --> 00:32:41.810
It was over.
You know what I mean?
I'll always not like them,

549
00:32:41.811 --> 00:32:45.050
but they don't have that,
that fucking thing that they can hold over us anymore.

550
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:49.700
But,
um,
despite that,
I'll always,
you know,

551
00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:51.740
not like the Yankees,
but,
um,

552
00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:56.570
I know I always respect the team when they,
when they do something the right way.

553
00:32:56.571 --> 00:32:57.404
So I'm,

554
00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:02.390
I'm kind of psyched that they're in it and Kansas City is fucking crushing it

555
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:03.930
because most,
some of my fate,

556
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:08.780
the most favorite baseball ever watch was those late seventies,
early eighties.

557
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:09.703
Um,

558
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.060
back before they had the wildcard and it was for the American League pennant,

559
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:17.990
the Elcs,
those Yankees,
Kansas City wants.

560
00:33:17.991 --> 00:33:20.630
And yet Kansas City can never beat the fucking Yankees.

561
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:25.070
And then they finally did in 1980 and I was so god damn site too,

562
00:33:25.071 --> 00:33:26.030
because we can never beat him.

563
00:33:26.031 --> 00:33:27.950
And then of course they lost to the Phillies and the world series,

564
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.810
but one horrific call,
five years later they'd beat the cardinals.

565
00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:37.490
Um,
anyways,
plowing ahead here.
Um,

566
00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:42.580
I saw a really annoying ad on the side of a bus today as I was ending my bike

567
00:33:42.621 --> 00:33:46.010
ride.
Um,
uh,

568
00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:51.080
it was this thing on the side of a bus about wearing condoms and it was two guys

569
00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:55.950
and then a woman in the middle.
And she was both telling them,

570
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:57.210
<v 0>okay,</v>

571
00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:00.030
<v 1>to have some willpower and use a condom.</v>

572
00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:01.430
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

573
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:06.320
<v 1>And once again with all the bitching out there about all this sexist fucking</v>

574
00:34:06.321 --> 00:34:07.011
shit out there.

575
00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:09.650
I guess maybe that's sexist because like what you were going to have a threesome

576
00:34:09.651 --> 00:34:13.520
with these two guys so maybe I guess women could pitch on that level.

577
00:34:13.521 --> 00:34:14.960
But as a guy,
I'm sitting there looking at it,

578
00:34:14.961 --> 00:34:19.790
thinking about all the women that I got with like how many times,

579
00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:22.580
right.
The moment of truth and you go to reach for the condom.

580
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:26.690
Have you been with a woman who would go,
Oh God,
condoms,

581
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:30.830
but just sort of whisper that and literally you'd feel like that fucking in your

582
00:34:30.831 --> 00:34:33.800
fucking stomach and your heart at the same time.
Like,
yeah,

583
00:34:33.801 --> 00:34:37.230
I think I'm putting on too thick.
I'm putting on too old.

584
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.080
Unless of course you were drunk and be like,
yeah,
hey,
don't kill.

585
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:46.700
I have no idea where it just cut out.
I moved my fucking,

586
00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:50.660
God dammit.
I moved my computer.

587
00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:53.540
Fortunately I only talked for a couple of seconds there.

588
00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:55.770
I was talking about that condom man.

589
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:58.240
I don't know where the fuck I left you out of here.
Um,

590
00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.100
I was just thinking how funny would it be if they actually,

591
00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:06.101
how long would that add last if they put a woman there and on in that ad and the

592
00:35:06.981 --> 00:35:11.900
guy's reaching for the condom and the woman said,
Oh God,
I hate condoms.

593
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:18.920
You can never have it.
They would be flipping the fuck out.
Oh,

594
00:35:18.921 --> 00:35:20.240
by the way,
you know,
I watched,

595
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:24.950
I watched a little bit of the,
uh,
Christ.

596
00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:29.480
Who the hell is playing the Raiders?
What a fucking uniform,
by the way,

597
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.140
I'm going to,
I'm saying right now that's the best uniform at sports pursuit.

598
00:35:33.141 --> 00:35:35.810
You'd have silver and black.
Come on,
man.
You can't fuck with that.

599
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.120
I swear to God now
that Al Davis has gone,

600
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:43.110
if any douche comes along and fucks with that emblem or those colors,

601
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.250
you know,
I felt bad for rate of feds is they will,

602
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:51.180
they will holding those signs up once again,
stay in Oakland.

603
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:55.290
You know what I mean?
Why do they put those fans through that shit?

604
00:35:56.570 --> 00:36:00.450
You know what I mean?
Fucking babies,
man.

605
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:03.180
You started in Oakland.
They love you.

606
00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.510
Why don't you pony up and fucking give a little bit of money towards your own

607
00:36:06.511 --> 00:36:07.291
fucking stadium,

608
00:36:07.291 --> 00:36:11.610
you ass hole instead of holding your fan base hostage like that.

609
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.170
So ridiculous.
What the fuck they put those fans throw,
you know.
Anyways,

610
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:20.730
we 20 years.
Yeah,
we're going to leave.
Go Fuck Yourself.
MMM.

611
00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:23.380
So anyway,
so I'm watching it.

612
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.090
They're playing the cardinals and they were showing the,

613
00:36:25.091 --> 00:36:29.230
the first female coach than the first female referee.

614
00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:30.610
And then,
you know,

615
00:36:30.611 --> 00:36:34.090
I'm watching Fox and they had ladies' night where they had the women all,

616
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:38.170
you know,
anchors and all that type of stuff.
And um,

617
00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.330
now that women are,

618
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:44.110
and then you know that down on the fucking field bugging the coaches as they're

619
00:36:44.111 --> 00:36:48.790
running into the locker room.
I'm going to say just as a male football fan,

620
00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:54.520
now that you guys have completely infiltrated the fucking league,

621
00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:57.220
you're basically at all levels.

622
00:36:57.221 --> 00:37:00.730
I know you're still going to blow or you got an owner or whatever.

623
00:37:00.731 --> 00:37:03.100
You're going to keep complaining all the way up to the top.

624
00:37:03.101 --> 00:37:04.480
Can you do me a favor?

625
00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:10.240
Just do me this favor Kenyan,
not ruin it.

626
00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:17.000
Can you do that?
Can you not ruin it the way you fucking ruined?

627
00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.810
You've ruined every guy's only thing.

628
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:25.460
Whether it was sexist or not.
You know what I mean?

629
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.340
I don't give a fuck that you're in the league.

630
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:31.190
I don't give a fuck that you coach and that you're reffing.

631
00:37:31.191 --> 00:37:35.120
I don't give a fuck if you own a fucking team.
I don't give a fuck.

632
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:39.800
Just don't ruin it.
Okay?

633
00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.980
Fucking learn how to roll with a joke.

634
00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:49.910
Learn how to just be one of the,
learn how to be fucking cool.

635
00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:53.630
Just fucking do that.
Just,
that's all I ask.
Don't fucking ruin it.

636
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:59.210
Okay?
Every 10 fucking seconds complaining.
You know what I mean?

637
00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.930
About how your feelings got hurt.
All right?

638
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:09.400
Just fucking learn how to laugh at yourself and be one of the guys and I mean

639
00:38:10.431 --> 00:38:14.000
that figuratively.
I don't mean that like in any sexist fucking white.

640
00:38:14.001 --> 00:38:15.110
Just don't fucking ruin it.

641
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:16.970
<v 0>Okay?</v>

642
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:18.410
<v 1>Not Jesus.
What are the fucking odds?</v>

643
00:38:18.411 --> 00:38:20.360
What are the odds that they're not going to ruin it?
You know what I mean?

644
00:38:20.361 --> 00:38:24.260
And turn it into,
I swear to God,
my biggest fear is within 10 years,

645
00:38:24.261 --> 00:38:29.240
the combination of all the women that they're now going to add into the league,

646
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:31.430
which they're not doing because they like women.

647
00:38:31.431 --> 00:38:34.100
They're doing it because of the ray rice thing.
They got to turn it around.

648
00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:40.430
That's how bad Roger Goodell fucked up so bad with that ray rice thing.

649
00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:45.650
Only suspending that guy for four fucking games out of the gate when he knocked

650
00:38:45.651 --> 00:38:48.860
his fiance out and dragged her down the hall like a fucking Cave Man.

651
00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:52.750
They fucked.
He fucked that thing up so goddamn bad.

652
00:38:52.751 --> 00:38:55.310
Do you realize that within one football season,

653
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.530
he fucking suspends Tom Brady for four games for absolutely nothing.

654
00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.980
And there's the first female head coach.
I mean,

655
00:39:04.981 --> 00:39:09.470
I coach all,
he fucked that thing up so bad that he,

656
00:39:09.471 --> 00:39:10.230
he this,

657
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:14.670
this is the way he had to overcompensate so he could keep his $40 million a year

658
00:39:14.671 --> 00:39:17.490
job.
So anyways,
yeah.

659
00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:22.560
Just don't be like,
just please for the love of God.

660
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:24.460
<v 0>Okay.</v>

661
00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:27.040
<v 1>You know that broad that makes everything about herself.
Don't,</v>

662
00:39:27.041 --> 00:39:30.040
don't be that fucking person.
All right.
Just please don't fucking do that.

663
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:35.470
My biggest fear is that within 10 fucking years with all this,
this,

664
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:36.873
you know,

665
00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.870
talk about concussions and all that and all the women that they're going to,

666
00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.020
now you know the flood gates are open,
they're going to add into the league.

667
00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:49.350
My biggest fear is that like within 10 years they're going to be playing two

668
00:39:50.141 --> 00:39:55.141
hand touch or flag football and it's just a,

669
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:59.720
it's just going to be over.
She's going to be over.
You know what I mean?

670
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:05.300
I just,
I dunno,
just don't ruin it.

671
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:08.990
Can you not do that?
I'm like,
even like out here,
oh fuck.
I didn't like,

672
00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:15.510
I'm a long time ago.
Like in the writer's room of this one show,
right.

673
00:40:15.511 --> 00:40:19.860
They were on like the fucking eighth season and they're sitting around trying to

674
00:40:19.861 --> 00:40:24.420
come up with storylines for characters that they've written for for well over a

675
00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:27.570
hundred episodes.
At that point,
you're out of ideas.

676
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:33.300
That's usually when you have a character getting married.
They have a baby.

677
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:36.680
The cousin comes to town like Oliver.

678
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.770
They mean the Brady bunch.
They did so many episodes.

679
00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:44.520
They had like nine characters on that show.
Three boys,
three girls,

680
00:40:44.521 --> 00:40:46.110
mom and dad and Alice.

681
00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:51.120
And then Alice had to get a boyfriend and it just kept going and going and
going.

682
00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.420
They became a music group.
They went to Hawaii,

683
00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:58.650
they went to the Grand Canyon.
And when they will finally out of fucking ideas,

684
00:40:58.651 --> 00:41:03.570
this fucking kid,
Oliver,
the seventh kid,
that 10th character shows up,

685
00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:06.190
who the fuck was he?

686
00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:10.440
They did one whole episode that was about an entirely different family.

687
00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:11.780
<v 0>Okay.</v>

688
00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:15.290
<v 1>That adopted a white kid,
a black kid and an Asian kid.</v>

689
00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:21.790
Like they would just add a fucking idea.
So anyways does show that,

690
00:41:21.791 --> 00:41:26.080
I'm not going to name there in the writer's room,
they eight,
nine seasons in.

691
00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:26.800
And they had like,

692
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.580
they are at that point where they got to go to Hawaii or they got to go to the

693
00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.420
Grand Canyon or add all over.

694
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.540
So they're sitting around trying to come up with new storylines.

695
00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:41.020
So one of the writers is a joke suggests that one of the characters rapes the

696
00:41:41.121 --> 00:41:43.130
other character and blah,
blah,
blah,

697
00:41:43.131 --> 00:41:46.760
which is totally over the top and fucking absurd.

698
00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:50.120
And there was a woman in the writer's room and she fucking sued.

699
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:52.183
<v 0>You know what I mean?</v>

700
00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:58.160
<v 1>He making,
is he,
is he really,
Geez.</v>

701
00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:02.710
Is He really going to sit there and take that literally in a comedy writing
room?

702
00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:05.410
That's what I mean.
That's what I'm talking about.

703
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.780
That's my big fear is that's going to happen.
It's like no,

704
00:42:07.781 --> 00:42:10.870
any sort of ball breaking,
we'll have to be done with it.

705
00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.890
Like I'm just picturing guys in the locker room having to look over this

706
00:42:14.891 --> 00:42:17.830
shoulder before they make some stupid fucking joke.

707
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.113
<v 0>You know,</v>

708
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:26.150
<v 1>just imagine Ken Stabler whispering a joke in a locker room can even picture</v>

709
00:42:26.151 --> 00:42:28.280
that.
That's what I'm worried about it,
it's,
it's going to ruin it.

710
00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:33.650
It's going to definitely have an impact.
Um,
I,
in a good way,

711
00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:36.950
but also a negative way.
I just don't understand.
Like,
um,

712
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.000
<v 0>yeah,</v>

713
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.920
<v 1>and I'm sure we ask them this.
I'm not saying this as like,</v>

714
00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.180
maybe you guys think I'm a fucking pig here.
I'm just asking is,

715
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:47.670
is there anything guys can just have,

716
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:52.200
they could just be guys only that won't be considered like some sort of

717
00:42:52.201 --> 00:42:56.040
Illuminati sexist fucking thing that's holding women down.
Can they can,

718
00:42:56.041 --> 00:43:01.041
is there a place where guys can just hang out and not have to look over their

719
00:43:01.561 --> 00:43:04.830
shoulder and worry about offending somebody?
You know what I mean?

720
00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:10.310
Where is our brunch
that's got,
it's going to end up happening.

721
00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:14.580
Guys are going to have to start going to Brunch,
you know,

722
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:17.790
and then it was going to happen is if they have a guy's only brunch,

723
00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:21.480
it's going to annoy women on some level and eventually they're going to have to

724
00:43:21.481 --> 00:43:24.630
go there just because we say that they can't,

725
00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.410
it's fucking unreal.
They have all women gyms.

726
00:43:28.411 --> 00:43:32.700
I don't give a fuck and I'll try to show up there and my speedos go,
oh,

727
00:43:32.701 --> 00:43:37.110
I should be able to use an elliptical in here too.
You know?
I mean,
I don't know.

728
00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:43.190
I am also saying this too,
as a worker bee,
I don't run any company,
by the way,

729
00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.600
before you get all,
Fuck Jesus Christ,
what are you going to do anyways?

730
00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:50.900
Let's plow ahead it ladies just don't fucking ruin it.
Okay?
Please don't do that.

731
00:43:50.901 --> 00:43:52.250
Like you've ruined titty bars.

732
00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:54.200
<v 0>Okay.</v>

733
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.420
<v 1>I used to a bit about that.
You know,</v>

734
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:57.800
women's just started going to titty bars and then they would look over it.

735
00:43:57.801 --> 00:44:00.860
You will be like,
this isn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be.
And I was like,

736
00:44:00.861 --> 00:44:05.510
yeah,
cause you're here.
Leave and it'll get,
it'll get fucking crazy again.

737
00:44:05.511 --> 00:44:10.100
Everybody's on their best behavior because mom's here.
All right,
let's,
uh,

738
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:14.330
let's plow ahead hill.
Uh,
Donald Trump.
All right,
Bill,

739
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:17.630
people are getting seriously worried about Trump.

740
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:20.810
I see very liberal friends of mine making posts,

741
00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:25.640
yearning people to not mention his name because it'll just perpetuate what they

742
00:44:25.641 --> 00:44:30.140
believe would be the downfall of the country.
I get that.
He's a bit out there,

743
00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.970
but even if he get elected,
how bad could it be?

744
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:37.380
I'm sure some of your listeners alike,
like my paranoid friends.
Uh,

745
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:40.480
should they be worried?
Um,

746
00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:46.980
should they be worried that an absolute dope would be in the White House?
Uh,

747
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:50.640
how did you like George W.
Bush?
How did you like that guy?

748
00:44:50.641 --> 00:44:54.990
Did you enjoy when he was in the office when you had a guy who couldn't complete

749
00:44:54.991 --> 00:44:55.650
a fucking,

750
00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:58.530
couldn't get through a sentence without stuttering to me sounded like me.

751
00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.560
That was a bit I used to do.
I used to say I liked George W.
Bush.

752
00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:03.900
You know why he makes me feel like I could be president too.

753
00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.760
That's literally what I felt like.
I was like,

754
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:07.560
I went to summer school at this guy.

755
00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.920
Like the president shouldn't give a guy like me hope.
You know what I mean?

756
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:16.740
That's all that I'm saying.
And I got to be honest with you,

757
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:21.750
these simplistic way that this guy talks about major things like just bombing

758
00:45:21.751 --> 00:45:24.540
people in the Middle East and the way he talks about Mexicans,

759
00:45:24.541 --> 00:45:26.730
it's a tough like that.
Um,

760
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:29.333
<v 0>yeah,</v>

761
00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.760
<v 1>there's something about him that he's very cartoonish.</v>

762
00:45:31.761 --> 00:45:34.410
So I think it's very easy to think that,
uh,

763
00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.170
that he isn't like a bad thing.

764
00:45:38.171 --> 00:45:42.640
But that thing there where he told that to a guy from the,
uh,
the Latino Guy,

765
00:45:42.641 --> 00:45:45.220
he's a citizen of the country and when they are escorting him out,

766
00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.250
that fucking white guy,
he goes,
get it out of my country.

767
00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:53.020
What kind of an adult says that get out of my country?

768
00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:57.400
Like it's his sandbox.
I mean,
it's not necessarily Trump,

769
00:45:57.790 --> 00:46:01.960
it's the kind of people that gravitate towards that guy.

770
00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:05.890
And as much as I've loved his honesty,

771
00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:10.720
let's forget about all the racist shit the guy has said.
Um,

772
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:16.930
I,
I just,
I be,
even if he wasn't racist,

773
00:46:16.931 --> 00:46:21.490
like he doesn't have the intellect for that job.

774
00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.640
You know what I mean?
I mean,
you're talking about limited the guy fucking,

775
00:46:25.641 --> 00:46:30.641
he hosts a reality show as much as he runs around talking about this empire he

776
00:46:30.981 --> 00:46:32.660
has,
I don't buy it.

777
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:37.610
It's like if he truly had all the money he had and truly had all this success he

778
00:46:37.611 --> 00:46:38.030
had,

779
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:43.030
would he really have time to decide if if fucking Sheena Easton or,

780
00:46:45.711 --> 00:46:46.880
or,
uh,

781
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:52.160
Lindsay Davenport is going to make us better see CEO for this company that

782
00:46:52.161 --> 00:46:56.150
doesn't even fucking exist.
You know what I mean?

783
00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:02.420
The one thing I will say is I've loved his honesty and that he sticks to what

784
00:47:02.421 --> 00:47:04.280
the fuck he's gonna say.

785
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:09.080
And I hope it encourages more politicians,
to be honest.

786
00:47:09.081 --> 00:47:10.010
But at the end of the day,

787
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:14.720
you have to have somebody in there that has the pedigree.
I mean,
come on dude.

788
00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:19.670
Like you'd look at it.
Donald Trump,
dude.
Okay.
Just imagine him is he's,

789
00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:24.060
he's somebody in the NFL draft as a quarterback.
All right.

790
00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:27.800
Can this guy make all the throws?
How's his footwork?

791
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.190
Is he patting the ball?

792
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.390
If his number one receiver is covered,

793
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:39.630
is he really going to have the calmness in his head when he's standing in the

794
00:47:40.211 --> 00:47:43.690
pocket and it's closing in to check down to receivers two,
three,
and four?

795
00:47:43.691 --> 00:47:47.860
I don't think he is.
I don't think he's presidential material,
but,
um,

796
00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:50.960
the fact that the,

797
00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:55.930
the kinds of people that he's stirring up like racist people who say,

798
00:47:55.931 --> 00:47:57.830
get out of my country,
um,

799
00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:03.650
it's kind of making Pat Buchanan look like,
uh,
like John Denver.

800
00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:11.420
So I'm,
I don't think you're,
you're,

801
00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:16.040
you're,
I think you're underreacting as much as your friends are overreacting.

802
00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:21.290
Um,
I don't think any one person has the ability to,
uh,

803
00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:25.220
be the downfall of the country.
Obviously he doesn't have that level of power.

804
00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:29.480
And I actually think if he did get elected that both Republicans and Democrats

805
00:48:29.481 --> 00:48:33.140
would resent him.
And I don't think that they would work with him the same way.

806
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:37.760
If somebody from one of,
you know,
the third party's got elected,

807
00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:41.210
they just wouldn't work with them because it would be great for their own

808
00:48:41.211 --> 00:48:43.520
argument that if you elect a guy from this party,

809
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:47.840
or if you elect a guy like this,
see he can't get anything done.

810
00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:52.760
And they would act like a bunch of babies,
Republicans and Democrats,

811
00:48:52.761 --> 00:48:57.680
because it's really not about doing what's right for American people.

812
00:48:57.681 --> 00:48:59.960
It's about winning.
That's all they give a fuck about.

813
00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:01.560
It's the same way why I won't watch it.

814
00:49:01.561 --> 00:49:05.870
And like a debate on CNN or Fox or,

815
00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:09.950
or any of those shows,
even like Bill Maher show real time,

816
00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:11.630
which is kind of outside of that shit.

817
00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:14.990
So much of watching that when you listen to people argue,

818
00:49:14.991 --> 00:49:16.670
they're not listening to the other person,

819
00:49:16.671 --> 00:49:20.840
they're thinking about the next point and they just want to win.
And um,

820
00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:25.040
I don't know.
I find all of that shit,
like it gives me a headache,
you know,

821
00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:29.230
it's kind of like,
um,
I don't know.

822
00:49:29.231 --> 00:49:32.890
Like my fucking wife watches those God damn reality shows all the time,
you know,

823
00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.730
come home and it's just like 10 women screaming at each other.
Right.

824
00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.920
And then it's bad enough she watches that show.

825
00:49:38.921 --> 00:49:43.190
Then she watches the show with that dude there,
uh,

826
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:45.430
whenever his fucking name is.

827
00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:50.200
And then it's like they do the recap of the series and then that fucking guy,

828
00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:54.820
he just brings up all the bad shit that they said about each other and stirs

829
00:49:54.821 --> 00:49:57.820
them up all over again.
And,
uh,
it's like,

830
00:49:57.821 --> 00:50:00.580
why the fuck would I want to sit here and want listen to 10 women screaming at

831
00:50:00.581 --> 00:50:02.800
each other for the life of me?

832
00:50:02.801 --> 00:50:05.110
I'll never understand why my wife watches that shit.
You know?

833
00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.020
<v 0>Okay.</v>

834
00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:10.980
<v 1>Of all the shit out there that,
you know,
I,
you know,
making women look bad.</v>

835
00:50:10.981 --> 00:50:15.390
Like those fucking shows where they just walking around with did dumb with their

836
00:50:15.391 --> 00:50:16.590
fucking horse shoes.

837
00:50:16.591 --> 00:50:20.220
Like they're going down to the club and there's still 21 trying to get a

838
00:50:20.221 --> 00:50:22.280
boyfriend and they're in their fifties.
It's like,
what,

839
00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:26.250
when are you going to grow up?
Get yourself some flats,

840
00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:29.790
give you toes a for the last 30 years of your life,
you know?
All right,

841
00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:34.190
passion for cars.
Dear Bill,
my dead,
uh,

842
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:36.000
has an older Porsche nine 11.

843
00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:40.380
He's currently restoring these currently restoring and hopes to pass.

844
00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:44.790
Pass it on to me some day.
Wow,
man,
your dad's fucking cool.
He goes,

845
00:50:44.791 --> 00:50:47.970
I don't exactly share the same passion and knowledge of God

846
00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:55.310
as the worst.
Are You rebelling against Your Dad?
He goes,

847
00:50:55.311 --> 00:50:59.180
I don't exactly share the same passion for our knowledge for cars,

848
00:50:59.181 --> 00:51:00.820
especially when it comes to Porsches.

849
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:03.650
He takes a lot of pride in the work he puts into it.

850
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:05.420
I'm the same way with my hobbies.

851
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:10.430
Can you make his passion for classic cars relatable to a guy who is perfectly

852
00:51:10.431 --> 00:51:13.910
content driving in o four Hyundai Elantra?

853
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.090
Can you describe what it's like to go through?

854
00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.760
What goes through your mind when you look at a classic car?

855
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:23.630
The feelings and the emotions Jesus Christ do.

856
00:51:23.631 --> 00:51:25.820
Can you give me more of a difficult task?

857
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:28.580
You obviously you don't have a passion for it.

858
00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:30.773
<v 0>MMM.</v>

859
00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.460
<v 1>What goes through my mind?
It's not even what goes,</v>

860
00:51:35.461 --> 00:51:39.220
it's a feeling when you're looking at a piece of,

861
00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:40.640
<v 0>yeah.</v>

862
00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.473
<v 1>All right.</v>

863
00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:45.840
Like I think cars right through like a

864
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:50.580
right to this.
I was talking to rogue and about that Rogan was fucking hilarious.

865
00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:54.840
The other night I saw him at the comedy store.
Joe Rogan said that American cars,

866
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:59.870
they made the best looking cars right up through the 1960s and then on turn on a

867
00:52:01.411 --> 00:52:06.411
dime and from like the mid seventies on made the ugliest fucking cars ever feel

868
00:52:08.461 --> 00:52:13.170
like,
I don't know,
10 or 15 years barring a couple,
two or three.
Um,

869
00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:18.560
so what I consider classic cars or early seventies all the way back and then

870
00:52:18.691 --> 00:52:22.440
there's a few cars from like the 80s that remind me like,

871
00:52:22.441 --> 00:52:26.490
oh my buddy had one of those and we get shit faced and stuff like that.

872
00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:31.410
Um,
I can tell you this now that I've got my truck,

873
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:35.010
68 f 100 off,
fixed up,
rebuilt engine,

874
00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:40.920
new exhaust system,
all the lights on at work except for the interior light.

875
00:52:40.921 --> 00:52:45.570
When I opened the door,
the radio lightworks the brakes work.
Fuck.

876
00:52:45.571 --> 00:52:50.520
It starts right up when I'm driving down the street and I'm running through the

877
00:52:50.521 --> 00:52:54.500
gears,
shifting on the column and I got my arm hanging out the window.
This is,

878
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:57.360
I can't,
there's,
it's not a describable feeling.

879
00:52:57.361 --> 00:52:58.680
You either love that or you don't.

880
00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:05.570
And I was sitting the other night at a red light listening to my truck idling.

881
00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:10.840
And I am hard pressed
to think of a better sound that,

882
00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.720
that I've ever heard.
When you just sitting at a light,

883
00:53:12.721 --> 00:53:17.280
it's got bowled over all the,
and you run into the fucking gay,

884
00:53:17.281 --> 00:53:20.670
it's just the greatest.
You either have that in your blood or you don't.

885
00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:22.553
<v 0>MMM.</v>

886
00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:25.730
<v 1>And the fact that your dad is into Porsche's,</v>

887
00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:29.840
I always felt that the people who are into the European stuff,

888
00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.870
specifically the performance cars,

889
00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:37.490
like the guys that I've run into that are into them are usually,
you know,

890
00:53:37.491 --> 00:53:39.100
I'm not trying to shit on Americans here,

891
00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:43.100
but they're highly intelligent and um,

892
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:49.740
you know,
just like the car refined and there's like,
I,
what I would do it,

893
00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:54.330
I would read up on those cars.
I'd read up on Formula One racing.
You know,

894
00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:56.010
I read this great book called the limit.

895
00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:57.600
I just don't think you're going to be into it,

896
00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:03.140
but it kind of talks about a formula one racing at its peak when you with

897
00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:08.700
somebody like died every other race.
And it talks about the Italians,

898
00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:12.230
the Germans and the English,
uh,
racing teams of that time.

899
00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:14.643
<v 2>I don't know,</v>

900
00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:16.700
<v 1>watch some old movies.</v>

901
00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:21.770
What was it Steve Mcqueen or was that Paul Newman that did the lamonds movie?

902
00:54:21.771 --> 00:54:23.030
I want to say it was Steve Mcqueen.

903
00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:26.360
I know you're either into it or are you not like this?

904
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:28.600
This car's out there that I just look at.
Like why,

905
00:54:28.601 --> 00:54:30.710
why did they stop making this design?

906
00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:35.620
Like I swear to God the,
the two door sedan,
like,

907
00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:41.280
like those Gtos,
the,
uh,

908
00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:45.350
the Ford galaxies,
the Pontiac's,
the Buick's,

909
00:54:45.351 --> 00:54:49.460
the two door fucking sedans that they had those long with the long trunks.

910
00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:54.350
They were the meanest look and fucking sedans and even just the baddest looking

911
00:54:54.351 --> 00:54:58.480
fucking cars.
I just looked at him like,

912
00:54:58.481 --> 00:55:01.990
what the fuck?
Why the fuck would you stop making that?
I mean,

913
00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:06.400
I learned on the Seinfeld chose because about safety that they have all the cars

914
00:55:06.401 --> 00:55:09.670
today,
like the car that you drive.
If I looked at that real quick,

915
00:55:09.671 --> 00:55:12.760
I can't tell the difference between that and a fucking Lexus or,
uh,
I,

916
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:16.000
they all look like dinner rolls to me.
Um,

917
00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:20.210
before you give up on it,

918
00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:23.480
I would say actually go rent a classic car.

919
00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:25.283
<v 2>MMM.</v>

920
00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:29.950
<v 1>Do you understand how the whole thing works?
How the engine works and all that?</v>

921
00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:33.520
Once you learn how that works,
the brilliance of it.

922
00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:37.240
And then if you just read up on racing and all this stuff that they do,

923
00:55:37.241 --> 00:55:40.750
just to try to get another hundredth of a second,
maybe that will light the fire.

924
00:55:40.751 --> 00:55:42.250
But I don't think I can help you if you,

925
00:55:42.251 --> 00:55:46.090
if you don't have a problem driving an o four.
Hi Hyundai Elantra.

926
00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:51.130
I don't think there's any,
you know,
and you know what,
to be honest with you,

927
00:55:51.131 --> 00:55:52.990
there's nothing wrong with it.
If you're not into it.

928
00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:58.150
I'm not gonna sit there and force my passion on to you.
But,
uh,
I will say,

929
00:55:58.151 --> 00:56:01.930
you know,
if you had your dad ever wants to hang out,

930
00:56:01.931 --> 00:56:06.070
let me know cause I'd love to see that car.
All right.

931
00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:08.380
Sunglasses,
dear bill,

932
00:56:08.381 --> 00:56:13.381
my wife told me I look stupid and aviators because I'm 34 years old and not in

933
00:56:13.721 --> 00:56:16.210
high school.
Uh,
that just the fucking worse.

934
00:56:16.211 --> 00:56:19.090
Can you imagine if you've ever said that to her?
Hey,

935
00:56:19.091 --> 00:56:23.380
you look bad and Spaghetti straps.
You're not fucking 21 anymore.
Yeah.
Me,

936
00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:27.990
how long before she even remotely consider fucking you again?
Um,

937
00:56:27.991 --> 00:56:30.990
anyways,
uh,
he goes,
I'm not going to send you a picture,

938
00:56:30.991 --> 00:56:34.680
but I really don't look bad in them.
Uh,
they don't look to flashing.

939
00:56:34.681 --> 00:56:37.530
I never once heard anyone say anything I've been where,

940
00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:42.690
when I've been wearing them so long that it blew my mind that it was something

941
00:56:42.691 --> 00:56:43.590
that bothered her.

942
00:56:43.591 --> 00:56:48.591
What the fuck kind of sentences that they don't look too flashy and I never once

943
00:56:49.081 --> 00:56:53.670
heard anyone say anything,
period.
Oh,
you're not using capitals.
Just helps me.

944
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:57.510
I've been wearing them so long that it blew my mind that it was something that

945
00:56:57.511 --> 00:56:58.344
bothered her.

946
00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:02.280
I think she doesn't like that they are youthful and she sees me and pictures and

947
00:57:02.281 --> 00:57:04.830
college wearing them as assumes that I put them on.

948
00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:10.070
I'm going to start boozing during the day and bang and soft six is that those

949
00:57:10.471 --> 00:57:15.210
days of by me,
she's being insecure,
right?
Yeah.
She's being an asshole.

950
00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:20.160
She's been an asshole.
Dude.
Aviators are great.
There's nothing wrong with them.

951
00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:23.060
They're cool sunglasses and you look cool on them.

952
00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:27.930
It'd be one thing if you were wearing like z Kava Ricci's or a,

953
00:57:27.931 --> 00:57:28.764
I don't know,

954
00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:32.370
something else that's out of style that I can't really think of it this moment.

955
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:37.080
But,
uh,
now she's being an asshole.
She's actually,
she,
yeah,
she's being insecure.

956
00:57:38.550 --> 00:57:38.971
Look,
dude,

957
00:57:38.971 --> 00:57:41.520
if you were out of shape and he was still wearing a tank top and he had

958
00:57:41.521 --> 00:57:45.420
grandmother arms,
she's looking out for you.
You know what I mean?
But,
uh,

959
00:57:45.421 --> 00:57:47.280
I'd have to see them.
Are they old?

960
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:51.150
But it's not like aviators ever fell off.
Really.

961
00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:56.640
The classic sunglasses.
I think he should still wear them.
And uh,

962
00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:00.420
I think there is a thing that when you're in a relationship,

963
00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.650
if you're not careful,
um,

964
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:08.710
there's a part of you that can say something,
uh,

965
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:13.120
that comes from a place that isn't,
isn't positive.

966
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:16.300
It could come from a place of like insecurity or resentment.

967
00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:18.580
Um,

968
00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:20.300
<v 0>okay.</v>

969
00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:24.070
<v 1>I would guess you probably look cool.
And Are you driving down the street?</v>

970
00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:27.230
Maybe that bothers him.
I have no idea.

971
00:58:27.231 --> 00:58:30.650
But I mean that's pretty pedestrian.
A pair of aviators.
I mean,

972
00:58:30.651 --> 00:58:32.780
that's like a pair of blue jeans.
I mean it's,
it,
that's,

973
00:58:32.781 --> 00:58:35.150
those things are timeless.
I don't know what her problem is.

974
00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:39.010
What does she want you to wear?
Those fucking old people wrap around glasses.

975
00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:40.313
<v 0>Okay.</v>

976
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:44.700
<v 1>So she can feel okay that you're not going down to the fucking fruit store and a</v>

977
00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:47.850
banging the chick behind the counter.
I Dunno.
Yeah.
Fuck her.

978
00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:52.440
I'd still wear the glasses.
I just say,
listen,
I like him.
I like him.

979
00:58:52.770 --> 00:58:57.520
And uh,
you know,
I don't make fun of your sports bras.

980
00:58:58.170 --> 00:58:59.940
<v 4>What is that supposed to be?</v>

981
00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:05.390
<v 1>All right.
Computer a bill.
I don't own a computer anymore.</v>

982
00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:08.840
Uh,
some people downgrade their phones.

983
00:59:09.110 --> 00:59:13.160
Ari Shaffir did so and he said he's loving not having all the distractions of a

984
00:59:13.161 --> 00:59:15.620
phone in his pocket.
I went the other way.

985
00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:18.680
I'm here to tell you that is an absolute pain in the ass.

986
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:22.900
I know you've never suggested not owning a at all,
but boy,

987
00:59:22.901 --> 00:59:26.440
Oh boy do I wish I had a shitty computer as opposed to no computer.

988
00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:27.970
I don't know what I was thinking.

989
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:33.040
I should have gotten rid of my phone when I ran on my laptop.
What,

990
00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:37.150
when I read on my laptop,
it's usually informative stuff.
My question is,

991
00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:40.030
do you think you could go without a computer or a smartphone,

992
00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:43.960
assuming you would record in a podcast studio?

993
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:48.840
Uh,
and Nia could handle anything you really needed?

994
00:59:49.570 --> 00:59:53.800
I could definitely downgrade my phone.
I could definitely do that.

995
00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:57.490
Um,
and I'm definitely,
uh,

996
00:59:57.510 --> 01:00:01.450
an attic when it comes to that type of stuff.
You know,
looking at my phone,

997
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:07.630
I wish I never went from a flip phone to a smart phone.

998
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:12.520
I wish I never did that.
I will tell you now that I'm doing a show,

999
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:16.120
you know,
right in this show and there's new drafts and that type of stuff that's

1000
01:00:16.121 --> 01:00:20.380
constantly being emailed to me and everything.
And a,

1001
01:00:20.381 --> 01:00:23.910
or somebody just emailed some notes,
people communicate through email.

1002
01:00:23.911 --> 01:00:28.180
So if I couldn't get emails on my phone,
I'd have to kind of be walking around.

1003
01:00:28.181 --> 01:00:32.770
So I think at this point
I'm kind of married to it in a way.

1004
01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:35.800
I mean,
I can,
I can,
I guess I could,
I could,
I could do the phone thing,

1005
01:00:35.801 --> 01:00:39.640
but a computer,
uh,
I couldn't do that.
No.

1006
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:43.240
I love going on the Internet and every,
any thought I had,

1007
01:00:43.241 --> 01:00:47.890
I could look up information on it.
I,
I love having that.
I just don't like the,

1008
01:00:47.891 --> 01:00:48.724
uh,

1009
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.870
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1010
01:00:49.870 --> 01:00:54.280
<v 1>I don't like having to download new operating systems that fill up my computer</v>

1011
01:00:54.281 --> 01:00:58.000
and make my computer.
That totally worked fine.
All of a sudden obsolete.

1012
01:00:58.930 --> 01:01:02.080
And,
um,
I know part of that is progress,

1013
01:01:02.081 --> 01:01:04.870
but I think that a lot of it is pushing the,

1014
01:01:04.871 --> 01:01:09.670
her towards having to get rid of these things that,
you know,
who's kidding,

1015
01:01:09.671 --> 01:01:12.160
who or anything that you throw out unless it's biodegradable,

1016
01:01:12.161 --> 01:01:15.400
which a computer certainly is and it really hurts the environment.
And I think,

1017
01:01:15.401 --> 01:01:19.120
uh,
you know,
I don't like being a part of that,
but I am,

1018
01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:22.930
I'm in the herd man.
When the herd stampedes I kinda got to run with it.

1019
01:01:22.931 --> 01:01:25.780
I guess I could do,
I could not do the phone thing.
I could definitely do that.

1020
01:01:25.781 --> 01:01:28.300
I've done shit before,
you know,
in the late nineties,

1021
01:01:28.301 --> 01:01:33.250
a couple times I got rid of cable and that type of thing.
And,
uh,

1022
01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:37.780
it was pretty cool and I had an amazing amount of free time,

1023
01:01:37.781 --> 01:01:42.760
but I got to tell you,
dude,
I fucking Miss Sports.
Like you wouldn't believe.
But,

1024
01:01:42.761 --> 01:01:46.690
um,
I don't know.
As,
as I've gotten older,
I watch a lot less TV,

1025
01:01:46.691 --> 01:01:49.750
but maybe that's because I got replaced by being on the computer a lot more.

1026
01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:54.520
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,
pool our vacation home bill.
Simple question.

1027
01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:58.990
My wife and I are debating the pros and cons of having a pool installed versus

1028
01:01:58.991 --> 01:02:02.170
buying a home up in Maine.
Uh,

1029
01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.160
they're actually not far and costs by the time you dig through all the Rock in

1030
01:02:06.161 --> 01:02:08.860
my New Hampshire backyard.
What are your thoughts here?

1031
01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:12.310
I know you don't have a pool,
so maybe you could tell me what you would do.
A,

1032
01:02:12.311 --> 01:02:17.280
I'd buy the house.
I buy the house because that's going to increase in value,

1033
01:02:17.281 --> 01:02:18.780
I would think more so than the pool.

1034
01:02:18.781 --> 01:02:22.260
And you in New Hampshire and even with global warming,
how much,

1035
01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:25.510
how many months out of the year can you use the pool?
Um,

1036
01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:29.490
you can't rent out your pool and earn money off of it.
You can't,
you know,

1037
01:02:29.491 --> 01:02:34.140
in a pinch,
just sell off your pool to save your house,
uh,
up in Maine.

1038
01:02:34.141 --> 01:02:37.590
You could,
I would say by the house in Maine.

1039
01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:43.100
And then with the money that you're earning by renting that out up in Maine,

1040
01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.180
um,

1041
01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.530
I would fucking use that money towards home improvements.

1042
01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:54.150
And your place in New Hampshire,
like having a pool day,

1043
01:02:54.151 --> 01:02:56.910
you'd go,
oh,
there you go.

1044
01:02:56.911 --> 01:03:00.120
This is your financial tips from a standup comedian.

1045
01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:04.230
And why would you listen to me when it comes to that shit?
All right,

1046
01:03:04.231 --> 01:03:07.830
that's the podcast for this week.
Everybody,
um,
oh man,

1047
01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:11.310
I gotta I gotta say the name of this fucking drummer that this this person sent

1048
01:03:11.311 --> 01:03:15.450
to me.
Jesus Christ.
I got to tell you something,
dude.

1049
01:03:16.770 --> 01:03:20.510
I've been taking these lessons,
right?
Um,

1050
01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:26.180
and I am seeing like such a fucking improvement in my plane and I was really

1051
01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:35.040
feeling great about it.
And then all of a sudden,
you know,

1052
01:03:35.041 --> 01:03:37.560
and obviously I know I'm not a professional drummer,
but you know your hobby,

1053
01:03:37.561 --> 01:03:41.310
you want to get better at it.
It's fucking makes you feel good,
right?

1054
01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:44.970
And then somebody sent me this fucking video,

1055
01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:50.730
I gotta make sure lead Pearson,
this drummer dude and this guy,

1056
01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.460
this fucking Solo,
this guy does.

1057
01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:55.330
You would've thought a guy was playing and he was getting,

1058
01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.750
he was going in the crowd going nuts.

1059
01:03:57.751 --> 01:04:01.410
Like they will listen to a guitar solo and I'm sorry,
Guitar Soloist.

1060
01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:05.370
You know the fucking deal and those big shows,
if he just fucking take a guitar,

1061
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:09.120
right?
And you just go bang,
I'm mirror and look at the crowd,
the all golf

1062
01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:14.730
Wang going out and then they just do that fucking shit.

1063
01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:16.741
Drums.

1064
01:04:16.741 --> 01:04:19.740
Everybody goes to the fucking bathroom during the drum solo or a lot of people

1065
01:04:19.741 --> 01:04:23.550
do write this fucking guy had them going nuts.
Like he was like,

1066
01:04:23.551 --> 01:04:28.290
he was up there playing eruption on guitar,
man.
So I'm gonna,

1067
01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:32.160
I'm gonna actually put this video up.
I don't really have that video,
uh,

1068
01:04:32.161 --> 01:04:36.510
that somebody sent me on Twitter,
which I really appreciate.
A home,
Sam,

1069
01:04:36.511 --> 01:04:39.210
his last name,
right?
Lead Pearson.
Jesus Christ.

1070
01:04:39.211 --> 01:04:44.210
What a fucking based on drums.
Um,

1071
01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:47.440
and then also,
you know,
I've talked before,
you know,

1072
01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:50.430
you guys know I love Italians,
right?
You've got to know that at this point.

1073
01:04:50.431 --> 01:04:54.000
And I love their food and I'll,
so I am a closet Italian when it comes to,
uh,

1074
01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:59.280
you know,
a lot of shit.
And,
uh,
so I'm,
I'm,
you know,

1075
01:04:59.281 --> 01:05:00.660
when I get through this whole diet thing,

1076
01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:04.630
I've always wanted to try and make it like a Sunday gravy,
which is basically a,

1077
01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.510
you just pick three,

1078
01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:10.350
four meats that you want to brown up in a pan.

1079
01:05:10.351 --> 01:05:12.870
You make some fucking meatball meatballs.

1080
01:05:12.871 --> 01:05:17.210
Then he'd throw it all in a fucking tomato sauce and you slow cooking and then

1081
01:05:17.211 --> 01:05:19.490
you make some pasta and then you just fuck it.
It's just,

1082
01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:24.350
do they throw like fucking spare ribs in there?
Meatballs,

1083
01:05:24.351 --> 01:05:27.140
sweet Italian sausage.
And they crazy as shit.

1084
01:05:27.141 --> 01:05:30.530
Like Anthony Bourdain had like fucking ox tail and like the more traditional

1085
01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:33.500
lower grade meets in there that you have to cook a long time,

1086
01:05:33.501 --> 01:05:36.440
really slow to get the flavor and get them to like be tender.

1087
01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:40.550
I can't wait to fucking do that.
So,
but there's this guy,
uh,

1088
01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:45.010
I sent the video to Farsi.
Uh,
it's fucking hilarious.
Well,
first of all,

1089
01:05:45.011 --> 01:05:45.844
I'll let you know the youtube,

1090
01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:48.620
it opens with one of the worst songs I've ever heard in my fucking life.

1091
01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:53.480
But when you watch this fucking guy is Italian guy,
go into the grocery store,

1092
01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:57.950
you have to see the look on his face when he's getting his ingredients,

1093
01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:00.890
the the look on his face,

1094
01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:05.920
like Germans have had less serious looks on their faces trying to win world wars

1095
01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:11.930
and this guy's just picking out fucking garlic in like he's fucking like the

1096
01:06:11.931 --> 01:06:16.780
look of intensity.
I was crying,
laughing.
Um,

1097
01:06:17.370 --> 01:06:21.430
and this is what my appreciation of Italians is being German,

1098
01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:25.990
mostly German and Irish,
Scottish,
I got English,
Dutch,

1099
01:06:25.991 --> 01:06:29.230
French and all that.
But I'm mostly,
you know,
German,

1100
01:06:29.231 --> 01:06:33.370
Irish and the complete lack of giving a fuck

1101
01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:40.090
when it comes to the food compare,
like watching like Italians,

1102
01:06:40.091 --> 01:06:43.420
how much they give a shit.
I literally,

1103
01:06:43.421 --> 01:06:47.530
I'm crying laughing because it,
it,
it just,
I don't know,
it just,

1104
01:06:47.590 --> 01:06:51.880
it's so comical compared to what I'm used to where everything was fucking
boiled,

1105
01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.810
salt and pepper and you just turn it on high and cook the shit out of it.

1106
01:06:55.990 --> 01:07:00.990
Now I know that there was some good Irish cuisine and German cuisine before I go

1107
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:03.820
listen to all your fucking bitch moaning and complaining.

1108
01:07:03.821 --> 01:07:08.140
But don't even try to remotely act that there's any dish in Scotland,

1109
01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:13.210
Ireland,
England,
uh,
uh,

1110
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:16.900
the Netherlands,
Germany,

1111
01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.020
I can't say France because they have some good food,

1112
01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:23.410
but all those other countries,
there's not one.

1113
01:07:23.411 --> 01:07:28.240
All of your best dishes combined can't fuck
with,

1114
01:07:28.241 --> 01:07:32.050
with just,
just,
just a fucking bowl of pasta and some sauce in Italy.

1115
01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:34.000
You know it's true.
I know it's true.

1116
01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:39.010
So I'm watching this guy making this fucking thing and it's in his fuck.

1117
01:07:39.011 --> 01:07:41.060
It's a bunch of older guys and I,

1118
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:45.550
and I love old guys with their corny fucking jokes.
Like one of them,

1119
01:07:45.551 --> 01:07:48.190
he was making some marriage joke.
He goes,
hey,
he goes,
you know,

1120
01:07:48.191 --> 01:07:50.200
when you get married there's the three rings,

1121
01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.680
there's engagement wing and the engagement ring,

1122
01:07:54.010 --> 01:07:57.790
the wedding ring and this suffering.
And then I'll,
ah,
fuck allow,

1123
01:07:57.791 --> 01:08:00.400
I love old guy,
corny fucking jokes.

1124
01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:05.640
And he's having his buddies over and he makes this unbelievable fucking meal and

1125
01:08:05.861 --> 01:08:10.060
they all sit down eating it and then they all talk about like,

1126
01:08:10.061 --> 01:08:14.230
this reminds me of my mother's cooking.
This is as good as my mother's.
And like,

1127
01:08:14.231 --> 01:08:16.010
that's like the highest level compliment.

1128
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:21.000
The whole fucking thing is just awesome and you got to watch this video.
Um,

1129
01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.990
and it doesn't even look that difficult as far as like,

1130
01:08:23.991 --> 01:08:27.050
the ingredients aren't that difficult.
It's course all about the way that you,

1131
01:08:27.051 --> 01:08:30.860
a season it and the guys catch phrases as he's doing,

1132
01:08:30.861 --> 01:08:33.140
he just keeps looking at the camera.
He goes,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1133
01:08:33.141 --> 01:08:36.740
And that's all the flavor.
And they looked at the camera,
he's like,
how you doing?

1134
01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:39.590
You know?
And he does it like 50 times.

1135
01:08:39.591 --> 01:08:43.640
It's funny the first seven times and then it starts getting old and then he just

1136
01:08:43.641 --> 01:08:48.080
keeps doing it so many fucking times that it literally becomes funny again.
Um,

1137
01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:51.260
I dunno,
it just made me want to,
I gotta go,
I gotta go.
I gotta go to Italy.

1138
01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.500
At least go to little Italy something.
Anyways,
so anyways,

1139
01:08:54.501 --> 01:08:57.950
that's a podcast for this week.
Can I say anyways any more times?

1140
01:08:58.190 --> 01:09:02.360
That's a podcast for this week.
Thank you guys for listening.
Hey,

1141
01:09:02.361 --> 01:09:05.780
don't sleep on that Michigan,
Utah game on Thursday.
You know,

1142
01:09:05.781 --> 01:09:09.470
Utah is going to come out and try to break fucking Michigan's heart and be like,

1143
01:09:09.471 --> 01:09:11.810
no,
it's going to be more the same and all.

1144
01:09:11.811 --> 01:09:14.540
There's a lot of people that come from pro football cities that don't watch

1145
01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:18.890
college football.
You got to get into it,
man.
Just pick an SEC team.
Uh,

1146
01:09:18.891 --> 01:09:21.140
I always watched Lsu tigers and I'm going to watch it.

1147
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:23.480
I'm going to try to watch them Auburn Games this year too.

1148
01:09:23.481 --> 01:09:25.040
I'm so fucking psyched.

1149
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:30.440
So fucking site and in the middle of all that is football's going on the pennant

1150
01:09:30.441 --> 01:09:30.861
races.

1151
01:09:30.861 --> 01:09:34.520
I get getting tighter and you got two weeks of the u s open the last major of

1152
01:09:34.521 --> 01:09:37.130
the year.
Okay.
If you're a bitch and this time of year,
I don't,

1153
01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:39.410
I can't fucking help you.
I can't help it.

1154
01:09:39.411 --> 01:09:42.110
Go hang out with that dude who can appreciate the classic cars.

1155
01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:43.430
Why didn't I take a dig at you?

1156
01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:46.760
I'm sure you're into something else that I'm not until you probably like those,

1157
01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:51.240
uh,
uh,
those x men movies,
uh,
such a concept.
All right.

1158
01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:52.970
Go fuck yourselves.
