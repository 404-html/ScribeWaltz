00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.130
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:04.131 --> 00:00:07.070
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.180
July 30th,

4
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.730
2018 what's going on?
How,
AH,

5
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.760
um,
I'm a little bit late here with this podcast.

6
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.480
Um,
you know,
I was out there and Houston,

7
00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:28.481
Texas for two nights in Dallas for one and I want to thank everybody that came

8
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:33.800
out and uh,
the weather was great.
It wasn't that hot,
you know,
I mean it was hot,

9
00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:37.730
but it wasn't like Texas hot when we flew into Houston.
I saw,
you know,

10
00:00:37.731 --> 00:00:39.470
a nice green fucking grass and that shit,

11
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.630
I didn't realize Houston was right on the water.

12
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.980
I always thought you still had to drive like an hour before you get to the Gulf

13
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:48.310
of Mexico.
I don't think I ever looked at that.
And I know a lot of,
yeah,

14
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.920
<v 2>Ooh,
boom.</v>

15
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.880
<v 1>No I didn't.
I didn't want to watch a bunch of people losing their houses.</v>

16
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.440
Did you watch it with your fucking popcorn before there was that disaster?

17
00:01:02.441 --> 00:01:05.590
Did you know that it sat right on the Gulf?
Unless you live there,

18
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.510
that's actually,
you know,
something.
Every time I go to a,
um,
a state,

19
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.440
I kind of look where everything's positioned in and it's self fucked.
How,

20
00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:16.060
like your brain remembers it,
Nick.

21
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.570
I always thought Austin was in between Houston and San Antonio.

22
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.090
Turns out it isn't,

23
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.470
it's north just northeast to San Antonio on the 35.

24
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.560
And then like a,
you know,

25
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.490
fucking San Antonio and Houston and kind of parallel with one another.

26
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:38.600
And of course,
Dallas is all the way up there on top Dallas,
Texas,

27
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.590
where the heat is real and the titties ain't.
Um,

28
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.890
I had an awesome time when I was up there.
And guess what,

29
00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:50.480
guess what old freckles has done?
He hasn't drank this whole month.
Oh,

30
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:55.310
did he want one last night?
But he didn't.
Um,
I'm going to,

31
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.660
yeah.
This is my new thing.

32
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.460
I'm drinking the way I smoke cigars once every 10 to 14 days.

33
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.070
If I do that,
if I do that alone,

34
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.110
I will cut down on my drinking by at least 172%.
No,

35
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.190
I don't know what I would do.
Um,
that's the game plan.

36
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.470
So I got a little,
uh,
little,
little Shindig August 7th.

37
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.070
Then I go right back on the wagon until fucking,

38
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.440
I'm gonna try to go back on the wagon.
That's the hardest thing for me.

39
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:28.970
Once I go off a whole daddy's playing the game again.
Oh,
he's,
he's in the game.

40
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.260
You get a little dirt on his beautiful.
Um,

41
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.030
yeah.
So,
uh,

42
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.070
Nate Craig was out there with me crushing it every single night.

43
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.880
And um,
I dunno,
don't have anything bad to say,

44
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.040
but it was weird.

45
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:49.670
It was weird going to Dallas and that's sending a vignette texts.

46
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.050
Other than that,
it was a good time.
Um,
all right.
They're just bum me out.

47
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:57.170
Why would I bum you up?
Good News.
Hey,
you know,
something,

48
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.180
his taste is something that you,
you might not have known about me,

49
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:04.600
but since when you were in my presence is,
I swear to God,

50
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.710
if I wasn't a comedian,
I could have been a manager.

51
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.350
Well,
at least I could.
I could have been a talent scout,
you know,

52
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.130
telling you how many more do I have to call?
Remember long time ago I said,

53
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:22.900
you know,
I've been watching this drummer on Instagram at the pocket queen.

54
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.710
Well,

55
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.330
that drum is going to be sitting in with the Seth Meyers show all this week.

56
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.430
What did I say?
Go ahead.
Go back and look at the old podcast.
Listen to them.

57
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.310
We're just right there.
I could have done it.

58
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.940
I could've brought the red socks out of there.
Fuck at age six,

59
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:43.000
year curse earlier.
If they had me as a talent scout,

60
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.780
I could just see now I can't see it in sports.
I can't see everyone.
Whatever,

61
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:47.840
you know,
you don't.
It really is.

62
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.090
You make a fun fucking thousand guesses and then one of them comes in and then

63
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:55.360
what you really do is you just brag about it,
which is,
which is what I'm doing.

64
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.920
So anyways,
I'm back out here in Los Angeles.
All right.

65
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.900
I'm sitting in a very progressive manner.

66
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.873
<v 3>MMM.</v>

67
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.300
<v 1>You don't want to watch.
Last night I watched a couple episodes of,
uh,</v>

68
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.630
Seinfeld's new,
uh,
comedians in cars.

69
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.260
You got to see the Brian Regan won the Dave Chappelle one is awesome.

70
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.980
It's Dave Chappelle.
But this Seinfeld one,

71
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.110
the car that Brian Regan likes,
I actually like it too,
but it's a 2005,

72
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.160
like two Cedar Cadillac or something like that.

73
00:04:29.161 --> 00:04:33.360
The level with I on all the episodes.
I've never seen Seinfeld shit on a car.

74
00:04:33.361 --> 00:04:34.440
Like he shut on that car

75
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.220
from the way it looked to the options to describing the person that was going to

76
00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:42.480
drive it.
Um,

77
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.710
and then Reagan of course it was Reagan and he was fucking hilarious.

78
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.070
But I was kind of hoping he was going to bring up how much he did not care for

79
00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:54.870
Brian's tastes and cars.
But you should check it out if you get a chance.

80
00:04:54.871 --> 00:04:58.440
So anyways,
is my story.

81
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.350
So I'm in Houston,
right.

82
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.920
And I was supposed to fly up to Dallas and once again I fucked up.

83
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.990
I wanted to fly into love field cause that's the smaller one in Dallas,

84
00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:12.870
the and whatever,
that fucking Metro airport,
whatever the hell it is.

85
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.350
It's gigantic.
But this time I actually went through Dallas airport and it,

86
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.700
it was,
it was really easy.
Oh I know why.

87
00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:23.610
Because that wasn't connecting,
connecting through Dallas.

88
00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:27.510
She always got to get on that fucking monorail.
And I swear to God,
if you're,

89
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.220
if you're in terminal B,

90
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.430
your connecting flight is in terminal a and you always have to go all the way

91
00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:34.890
around.
You always miss it.
Just buy one share.

92
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:37.890
You could grab your bags and start running through the airport,
you know,

93
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.120
like Oj Simpson back in the day,
I guess,
you know,
maybe that's an option.

94
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.550
<v 3>I don't know.
Um,</v>

95
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.200
<v 1>so anyways,
I was going to fly from Houston,
but uh,</v>

96
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.980
Nate didn't get a ticket,
thought we were driving up,
so it was like,
God,
fuck it.

97
00:05:54.981 --> 00:05:55.700
You know what?

98
00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.640
I can't remember last time I took the 45 north up to,
uh,

99
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.010
from Houston to Dallas and uh,
canceled my fight flight.

100
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.090
We just fucking drove up there.
And um,

101
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.890
I gotta tell you,
man,
that is a,
uh,
it's an intense state.

102
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.270
Dallas,
Not Dallas,
Texas.
I mean,
I mean,

103
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.940
there's just like nothing out there and then all of a sudden you just,

104
00:06:20.941 --> 00:06:24.120
you finally fucking come on something.
You get so fucking excited.

105
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.640
Some sort of barbecue.
Joy,
Mike,
Mike and I,
we should stop there,
man.

106
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.880
You're the middle of nowhere.
Everything starts looking good.

107
00:06:32.881 --> 00:06:37.680
Look at how they got fireworks.
Let's pull over man.
Got To get some of those.

108
00:06:37.681 --> 00:06:42.440
I haven't seen anything.
Any sun is civilization for the last fucking hour.
Uh,

109
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.340
but we ended up stopping at this gas station where they got this checklist,

110
00:06:45.341 --> 00:06:48.900
Slovakia,
Aki and a Slovakian.
I don't want to start any fucking wars over there.

111
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.410
Um,
little,
uh,

112
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.670
dessert thing that they have that some people put meat in,

113
00:06:56.671 --> 00:07:01.200
some people put fruit in it or whatever.
And I only see him in Texas.

114
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.580
It's usually when I'm on the 35,
right around Waco,
Texas.
Um,

115
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.840
I was joking about that guy all weekend.
You know,
Joel Olsteen.

116
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.440
I was teasing those people down in Houston going like,

117
00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:17.410
I can't believe you guys were surprised that that guy didn't let you into his

118
00:07:17.411 --> 00:07:21.880
house when the hurricane cave.
He's,

119
00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:25.420
he's selling out a basketball arena talking about Jesus.

120
00:07:25.421 --> 00:07:29.530
Do you think this guy's even remotely honest on any level?

121
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.970
Let's do that thing where I had my eyes closed going.

122
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.780
Jesus doesn't want you to step on my blue rug.
I'm

123
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.090
talking about David Koresh anyways.
Was that was named David Kresh.

124
00:07:43.091 --> 00:07:44.170
Really good looking guy,
man.

125
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.560
You remind me of that guy that who started in California,
California occasion.

126
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.590
He's also written,
uh,
um,

127
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.810
the x files.
David Duchovny,
sort of the David Duke Company.

128
00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:04.720
Sort of understated by with them with like Richard Gere's here.
What was that?

129
00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:09.360
I got more of a Rambo haircut,
you know,
I gotta look it up now.
Be like,

130
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.000
if you could go back in time,
we go hey to the cops,

131
00:08:12.001 --> 00:08:15.780
right before that guy went nuts.
Hey man,
you got to get this guy.

132
00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:19.440
He's saying he's Jesus.
Oh,
what's he look like?
Uh,
you know,

133
00:08:19.441 --> 00:08:24.360
he kind of looks like a skeletal Rambo Haircut like David did.

134
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.730
Covenant with just a splash or Richard Gere.

135
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.660
Sounds like a cover of people magazine from Phuket,
1989.
Um,
what,

136
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.570
what are you looking up,
David Koresh?

137
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.000
The K factor?
He definitely would have got the plane ticket to Vegas.

138
00:08:42.001 --> 00:08:44.720
Look at the guy.
You know what I mean?
If you tick off those fucking glad.

139
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.320
He looks like he could have done that.

140
00:08:46.321 --> 00:08:49.440
Bjorn Borg story is what's going to freak me out.

141
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:54.470
How long did this guy live from 1959 to 1923 Oh Jesus.

142
00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:02.160
Oh,
he's 33.
You know those Jesus freaks.
That's when they like to die.

143
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.620
That's when they like to die.
Oh Geez.

144
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:09.600
Is died at 33.

145
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:14.601
So if I fucking die too then that means I'm just as his father or to make no

146
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:23.460
sense.
I thought it was going to come out on Sun anyways.
Um,

147
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.200
so I'd been eating perfectly the whole weekend and then I stopped and I got a

148
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:30.750
couple of those uh,
with,
I didn't know what the fuck they called.

149
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.730
Checklists allow Hannis I'm going to get you the name of them.
I can't find it.

150
00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:39.270
It was called like a collage or something like that.

151
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.460
I can't find it.
What the fuck?
Come on.
There it is.

152
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.290
Kol a c h e.
Oh my God.
That the delicious.

153
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:53.460
Hey Nia.
Wait,
who's that?
Hey.

154
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.700
Hey Buddy.
Oh,
you've got your book.

155
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.960
You want me to read you a story baby?

156
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:07.560
Oh,
is it?
Hi Buddy.
Hi Buddy.
Can I get a kiss?

157
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.510
All right.
Oh,
the boss baby.
Did you guys like to listen?

158
00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:15.150
A little freckles Riccio kids book.

159
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.420
Oh,
you did?
Okay.
I don't touch that.
Don't touch that.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Thank you.

160
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:24.630
I appreciate you showing me that was there.
Yeah.
I have to do a podcast,
man.

161
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:27.810
I don't know if I could do this right now.
All right.

162
00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:29.610
From the moment the baby arrived,

163
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.380
it was obvious that he was the boss.
Yeah.

164
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:39.381
He looks like he put mom and dad on a round the clock schedule with no time off.

165
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:44.720
Thank you.
Does this seem familiar Kiddo?
Um,

166
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.870
bombing with her right now and then he set up his office right smack dab in the

167
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:51.930
middle of the house.
She's not even listening to me.

168
00:10:51.931 --> 00:10:55.560
I have like no charisma here whatsoever.
She's finding the crap on my couch way.

169
00:10:55.561 --> 00:11:00.240
My interesting,
he made demands many,
many demands.

170
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.760
And you've got a little Trump suit on and he was quite particular.
No,

171
00:11:03.761 --> 00:11:08.410
I don't like that.
If things weren't done to his satisfaction,
he had a fit.
Well,

172
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.360
it sounds like these parents need to pooch kick him into his crib.

173
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.620
He conducted meetings lots and lots and lots of meetings.

174
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.000
Hey,
I eat,
are you interested in this at all?

175
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.880
I had to get back to my podcast.
Keep reading.

176
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.390
All right.
Many of the meetings happen in the middle of the night.

177
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.460
The funky thing,
when was this written,

178
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:45.240
Marla?
Prezi.
Is that an old black woman,

179
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.100
Marla?

180
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:51.100
The funky thing that came out of nowhere is it the 70s read the book.

181
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.700
He never ever said a single word that made any sense,
but that didn't stop.

182
00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:01.600
She wants to run around.
Do you want to look at this?

183
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.680
I just feel like everybody's fast forwarding through this.
Oh,

184
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.020
whoa.
All right.
And then daddy went back to his podcast.

185
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:14.500
The end.
Is that cool?

186
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:16.803
Bye.

187
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.820
Okay.
Um,
yeah,

188
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.990
I have to get back to a particularly excrutiatingly unfunny podcasts.

189
00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:33.040
I'd been recording anytime I start and I start like promoting something or

190
00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:34.330
whatever the hell I just did.
I had it.

191
00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:36.310
My whole brain just goes out the damn window.

192
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.240
Do you want me to read that book again?
Okay.
Sorry guys.
This is just part of it.

193
00:12:40.241 --> 00:12:43.060
Not The boss baby by Marla phrase

194
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:49.000
from the moment the baby.
All right,
let me get back to this.

195
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:51.693
So

196
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.990
bye bye bye.

197
00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:02.170
Say I love you.
There you go.

198
00:13:02.171 --> 00:13:05.350
She can't say it.
She just goes and Yang,
Yang,
Yang,
Yang.
Um,

199
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:09.780
she yesterday after,
uh,
I flew back from Dallas,
um,

200
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.660
I landed at lax and I met a friend of mine,
believe it or not,
um,

201
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.060
who owns one of those Vietnam era fucking helicopters,

202
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.910
the Huey ewh ones.
And uh,

203
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.530
he was there with this instructor and they picked me up in the thing.

204
00:13:26.531 --> 00:13:29.920
I literally at least sounded like I was in fucking apocalypse now.

205
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.120
And um,
you know,

206
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.790
he flew around off the coast of Malibu and all that stuff and then we landed at

207
00:13:36.791 --> 00:13:41.750
this small airport,
got some lunch and then they let me fly it.
And uh,

208
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.770
it was amazing.
You know,
it's funny,
they,
old people always said,

209
00:13:44.771 --> 00:13:48.910
if he can fly in our 22,
you can fly anything.
Um,

210
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.390
they are 22 is the little egg beater that I fly and it's kind of like driving a

211
00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:56.280
car.
I would say like no power steering or power brakes.
You,

212
00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:01.000
you're really doing it.
Um,
but despite all that,

213
00:14:01.001 --> 00:14:04.240
anytime you get a new helicopter,
it's like,
it's not just like,
no,

214
00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:04.900
if you would just to like,

215
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.810
if someone was to like taxi it out for you and you just took off,

216
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.820
it's very easy to fly anything.
But it's like when you come to a hover,

217
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:14.260
you know,

218
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
and you're doing little turns and stuff and trying to set it down on the pad.

219
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:20.680
I don't,
I don't know.
That's when I sit there thinking like that,
you know?
Okay,

220
00:14:20.681 --> 00:14:25.150
you might be able to fly it,
but I don't think he can maneuver it.
Well.
So,
uh,

221
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:30.180
we just did it some pad work and then I flew from a camera Rio all the way out

222
00:14:31.211 --> 00:14:35.560
to,
uh,
to Burbank.
It was amazing.

223
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.360
It was fucking amazing.
And um,
I want to thank my buddy Phil.
Let me do it.

224
00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:44.650
Not naming any names or any of that crap that was speaking about helicopters.

225
00:14:44.651 --> 00:14:48.580
Everybody keeps telling me I got to see that new Tom Cruise mission impossible.

226
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.900
Doesn't it seem like my podcasts lately that I'm throwing in advertising.

227
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:57.360
I swear to God I'm not.
I watched that movie.
Uh,

228
00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:58.283
<v 3>okay.</v>

229
00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:04.650
<v 1>Uh,
the,
uh,
the death of Stalin yesterday on the plane.
Jesus Christ.</v>

230
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.340
I don't know who the hell wrote that man.

231
00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.550
How do you turn that guy into a comedy?

232
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:15.660
But somehow they did with those fucking hilarious,
um,

233
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.520
two of my favorites of all time,

234
00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:22.820
Steve Buscemi and a Jeffrey tambor or rent it.

235
00:15:22.981 --> 00:15:26.700
They are absolutely hilarious and I wish I knew the name of the one of the other

236
00:15:26.701 --> 00:15:27.780
league cronies there.

237
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:29.773
<v 3>MMM.</v>

you know,
something,
that's the first time ever,

275
00:17:39.711 --> 00:17:44.690
I'm actually starting to feel my God damn age,
you know,
and I was in Dallas,

276
00:17:44.691 --> 00:17:48.320
the fact that I had like two shows and I wrote up sitting down in that frigging

277
00:17:48.321 --> 00:17:49.370
car,
I'm you,

I had to go shovel somebody driving.</v>

280
00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.490
Once they get out on the stage,
I'm fine.

281
00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.373
<v 3>But,
um,</v>

282
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.800
<v 1>actually I'm probably fine the whole time,
but I'm just like,
uh,</v>

283
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.130
just the thought of it,
two shows never bugged me.

284
00:18:08.131 --> 00:18:10.980
Three was always like,
all right,
what the fuck?

285
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.950
What am I working in a mine here.

286
00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:17.850
I thought he got into show business to have a nice easy fucking life here.

287
00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:19.623
<v 3>MMM.</v>

288
00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:24.790
<v 1>Yeah.
It has been like feeling my age,
so I got to get back to a,</v>

289
00:18:24.791 --> 00:18:27.950
I don't know what you know,
cause I shouldn't be feeling.

290
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.630
I might feel a little bit my fucking now,
so my,

291
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.610
my shoulder's fine and now my knee is fucked up.

292
00:18:33.611 --> 00:18:35.030
I don't even know what the Hell I did to it.

293
00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:37.080
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

294
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.180
<v 1>Just crawling around,
playing with my daughter.</v>

295
00:18:39.181 --> 00:18:43.920
All of a sudden just my knee all of a sudden
felt like really?

296
00:18:43.921 --> 00:18:47.220
I don't know what hot,
stinging pain,

297
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.220
but it's not constant and it's only when I put pressure on it,

298
00:18:50.221 --> 00:18:52.800
so I don't think that it's bone to bone.
Thank God.

299
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.430
I think I've been active enough to have that shit.

300
00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.170
This is one of my favorite things to do by the way,

301
00:18:58.171 --> 00:19:02.010
is to let you guys know what some of my ailments are and then you guys all just

302
00:19:02.011 --> 00:19:04.950
turn it.
The doctors.
It's one of my favorite things.
Go.
Do you know what that is?

303
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:09.660
It's actually your kidney.
Hear me out.
One time there was this guy,

304
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:14.070
right.
And it just fucking goes into that shit.
And he was out on the golf course.

305
00:19:14.071 --> 00:19:16.470
You guys,
you know,
I'm at the doctor,
look at my,
my knees.

306
00:19:16.471 --> 00:19:20.850
And the next day he died of a,
uh,
a kidney apparatus.

307
00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.420
It kidney,
uh,
uh,
uh,

308
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:30.530
<v 3>aorta,
what'd they call it?
Kidney Hemorrhage.
Cambridge.</v>

309
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:32.833
Um,

310
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.690
<v 1>Tony was eight,
that fucking little checklists of Aki in dish.
And then,</v>

311
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:41.230
then I went right back to salads and I was fine and find a finding and late at

312
00:19:41.231 --> 00:19:43.270
night,
these goddamn hotels,
they always get me,

313
00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.990
they always had the little snack thing I'd eaten.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Perfect.

314
00:19:46.991 --> 00:19:49.270
When I was in Houston,
unbelievably,

315
00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:52.760
there was no snacks right now everybody knows Houston was voted,
uh,

316
00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.250
unprecedented back to back.

317
00:19:54.251 --> 00:19:58.450
They went back to back is the fattest city in America.
Okay.
And this is no,

318
00:19:58.451 --> 00:20:01.090
you know,
it's not like these are,
this is some little fucking,

319
00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:06.060
you're not going up against cupcakes here in America.
No Pun intended.
All right.

320
00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.580
Where are some of the fattest people on the plan?
I don't even think we are.

321
00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:14.170
I gotta be honest with you.
Maybe we are,
but collectively,

322
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.530
but when you're in the city,
she,
you know,
you don't see a lot of fat people.

323
00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:21.340
You're in the city.
There's just too many eyes on you.
You know,

324
00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.340
you get out in the country,
man.
I mean,
shit,

325
00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:28.000
you can just walk your property book and Butt ass naked.
Who gives,
if you don't,

326
00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:31.710
nobody cares how fat you get those overalls.
What we'll hide the,

327
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:35.080
the first 40 pounds.
Who's kidding?
Who remember Uncle Jesse,

328
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.550
that big goddamn beer belly he had,
but he had in the overall,
so you look,

329
00:20:39.551 --> 00:20:43.020
he looked like Santa Claus just look good.
All Bar.

330
00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.730
They have a main and no home.

331
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:53.790
It's dumb.
It's full of boobs and fucking regret.
He doesn't even know his kids.

332
00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.140
Um,
was that what that whole thing was about?

333
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.890
He was uncle Jesse,
Boeing,
Lou quick cousins.

334
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.760
He must've come from a big family because that should have been odds out.

335
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.280
We should have been one of their dads.
Right.

336
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.020
<v 3>Cooter okay.</v>

337
00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.680
<v 1>It's crazy.
Cool.
Do you get your ears on?
Um,</v>

338
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.050
I'm actually at the end of the sixth season.

339
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.500
Of a 77 sunset strip.

340
00:21:20.501 --> 00:21:24.460
It got canceled after 20 episodes.
And I'm really gonna miss that show.

341
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.290
And I hope that me TV,

342
00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.190
which I'm going to look up right now is going to go back to episode one again

343
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.040
cause I missed if they start,

344
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.020
I could have watched the whole series since last November and I didn't even know

345
00:21:35.021 --> 00:21:40.000
it was on.
Um,
and I would love to,

346
00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:44.110
I really wanted to see those first five episodes cause he was in la anytime they

347
00:21:44.111 --> 00:21:47.650
weren't in La.
I would always hit pause just to see,
uh,

348
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.430
if I could recognize where they were.
There he goes,

349
00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.300
me TV 77 sunset strip.
Come on man.
Give me a fucking showing.

350
00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:01.060
Gimme a showing schedule is that when I send me seven has its roots in an

351
00:22:01.061 --> 00:22:04.060
underrated,
I don't care about that.

352
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:11.710
<v 3>Come on schedule,

353
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:12.623

Thursday or Friday.

357
00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:29.770
So,
um,

358
00:22:29.771 --> 00:22:33.090

The red sox speak to twins.

359
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:34.110
There's something,

360
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:40.480
we got the Phillies tonight for some more exciting inner league play.

361
00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.770
They have inner league play like every fucking two days now.

00:22:58.571 --> 00:23:00.670
well it's Kinda sticking out so it wouldn't hurt that much.

368
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.590
It's designed for that.
Like,

369
00:23:02.591 --> 00:23:07.090
the inside of your palm or chip that as far as like the worst bones to break his

374
00:23:24.131 --> 00:23:26.890

She looked in amazement toe.

394

<v 1>continue podcasting's under these circumstances.
All right.</v>

403
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.700
First read of the week,
honey.

404
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:27.630
Millions of people are using honey to save money while shopping online.

405
00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:32.710
And why wouldn't they?
It's very hostile.
It's free.
It's free.

406
00:25:32.711 --> 00:25:37.000
Takes just two clicks to add to your browser and saves you time and saves you

407
00:25:37.001 --> 00:25:38.850
tons of money.
It's ingenious.

408
00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:43.860
But one of my absolute favorite things about [inaudible] is how much better it

409
00:25:44.111 --> 00:25:48.280
makes shopping on Amazon.
Um,
please personalize.

410
00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:52.120
Personalize this to make it your own honey.
Madge.
Okay,

411
00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:57.150
honey magically adds all sorts of useful information on the Amazon page of

412
00:25:58.721 --> 00:26:00.430
whatever you're looking at.
I was supposed to,
right?

413
00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:04.480
Am I supposed to make this personal?
Just shop like I normally do?

414
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:08.440
Hi honey.
Hi honey.

415
00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:13.210
Automatically searches the 2 million sellers on Amazon to find you the lowest

416
00:26:13.211 --> 00:26:18.130
price.
It even shows you the items,
prices changes.

417
00:26:18.131 --> 00:26:21.610
So you can decide if you want to buy or wait for the price to come up and down.

418
00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.850
Did I read the right?
It even shows you is the,
the item's prices.

419
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:27.880
Prices changes its price changes.

420
00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.830

484
00:30:49.511 --> 00:30:54.250
Acid is owning a couch from hell is like a rite of passage.

485
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:57.730
I eat too expensive,
too heavy,
too cheap to warn.

486
00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:01.060
You found it on a street corner and God knows who fucked on it.

487
00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:05.290
A police use one is your negative couch experiences to contrast.

488
00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.080
How amazing your new borough conscious.
Oh,

489
00:31:08.081 --> 00:31:11.830
I used to live with Robert Kelly back in the day and uh,

490
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:15.820
I think Bobby Watch Sanford and son too much because he was constantly bringing

491
00:31:15.821 --> 00:31:17.770
things in from the sidewalk.

492
00:31:17.771 --> 00:31:21.550
One of these was the couch that he then put a bedspread over,

493
00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:26.410
which was I guess supposed to block out the potential body lice or maybe broken

494
00:31:26.411 --> 00:31:28.990
cracked pipe that you could sit on,
you know,

495
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.180
you know what do you know what I really wish

496
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.270
other than that I could hug Bob Right now and tell him that it was okay that he

497
00:31:36.271 --> 00:31:37.830
took that couch off the sidewalk.

498
00:31:37.831 --> 00:31:42.720
I really wished that burrow existed back then cause me and Bobby could have

499
00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:45.810
fucking ordered a couch right after all these years of stuff.

500
00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.450
Was that personal enough?
After all these years of suffering,

501
00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.650

questions for this week.</v>

530
00:33:36.651 --> 00:33:39.560
I guess that's what we'll do.
We'll do a couple of questions and then we'll,

531
00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:42.740
I can go back to some more advertising if I can actually figure out how to read

532
00:33:42.741 --> 00:33:46.430
it.
All right.
Russia feeling left out.
Hey,

533
00:33:46.431 --> 00:33:50.360
your bill bur rough.
Uh,

534
00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:51.600
I've been listening to you,

535
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.340
you talking about your upcoming Eastern European tour in the latest podcast,

536
00:33:55.341 --> 00:33:59.720
but not hearing about any stops in Russia leaves me quite scarred and

537
00:33:59.721 --> 00:34:02.420
traumatized every time the podcast ends.

538
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:07.460
Is this guy making fun of millennials or how soft Americans are or are

539
00:34:07.461 --> 00:34:12.050
millennials a worldwide problem?
I mean,
what's the deal with leaving us out?

540
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:16.010
Stand up is very popular here right now.
Stand up in Russia.
I mean,

541
00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.630
you allowed to talk about anything.

542
00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:23.240
I can't see going over there doing a Vladimir Putin fucking impression could I?

543
00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:25.341
Then what happens?

544
00:34:25.341 --> 00:34:29.630
All of a sudden somebody sprays some mist on me and I'm sure you can easily pack

545
00:34:29.631 --> 00:34:34.280
a full show several times over in places like Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
Uh,

546
00:34:34.281 --> 00:34:39.260
besides think of all the experiences you can have in the Oji Vodka capitol of

547
00:34:39.261 --> 00:34:42.530
the world.
It's dirt cheap with the current exchange rates.

548
00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:46.010
The cities are beautiful and quite different from what you see anywhere else.

549
00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.650
The people are friendly,
welcoming,
and fun loving.

550
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.990
Was this written by the KGB or is this really a regular person?
You never know.

551
00:34:53.991 --> 00:34:55.820
I mean,
we haven't gotten along for a long time.

552
00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.190
I know it kind of died down for a minute,
but you know,

553
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.060
it's always going to be Yankees and red sox with us,
unfortunately.
Um,

554
00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.650
to be honest with you,
dude,
I'm actually,

555
00:35:03.651 --> 00:35:08.570
I was talking to my agent about trying to add Moscow,
um,

556
00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.420
which I shouldn't have said because not everybody is always trying to add it.

557
00:35:11.421 --> 00:35:14.930
And then if I don't,
then I'm a fucking asshole.
Um,
anyways,
he said,

558
00:35:14.931 --> 00:35:17.510
I know we have a bad rap currently.
Even heard,

559
00:35:17.511 --> 00:35:20.780
you mentioned that gay people and journalists have been killed here,

560
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:25.040
which would be laughable to us if not so many people believe those stories.

561
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:27.410
<v 3>Uh</v>

562
00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:32.240
<v 1>Oh,
you don't think,
oh my God,
am I who's living under the right media bubble?</v>

563
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.660
Anyways,
but let me ask,
just ask you one thing.

564
00:35:35.661 --> 00:35:38.790
If you're so skeptical about trusting the media in your everyday life,

565
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:43.980
why go around and believe what that same media is spewing about other countries?

566
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.730
Not Saying you should take my word for it.
Come and see for yourself.
Hey,

567
00:35:47.731 --> 00:35:51.390
come on over,
Bill.
We're not killing anybody over here.
Grab it.

568
00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:53.940
Make your own decision and the meantime,

569
00:35:53.941 --> 00:35:58.860
give a little gift of laughter to melt are cold.
My strikes,
chef,

570
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:03.360
loving hearts.
I don't even want to say it.
Have a nice day and go fuck yourself.

571
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:07.170
Oh Man.
Um,
no.
I would love to fucking go over there and uh,

572
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.530
I dunno what the fuck the belief,
but I do know this a,

573
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:15.650
we're not the only one's lying,
you know?
Okay.

574
00:36:15.651 --> 00:36:17.600
It's don't believe the American media,

575
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:22.310
but believe my media about my country.
Well,
I guess maybe I should believe.

576
00:36:22.311 --> 00:36:25.760
I mean,
look,
I don't think I would if I went over there.

577
00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:31.610
Yeah,
it would be honest.
I Dunno.
Maybe you're being honest.
Who the fuck knows?

578
00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:36.470
You know,
I think we should just grow up and joined forces.

579
00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.310
Um,
okay.
A RP.
Oh,
hi bill.

580
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:42.770
I've heard on your podcast that you was,
oh wait,
by the way,

581
00:36:42.771 --> 00:36:47.771
have you guys seen the Vladimir Putin fucking goes out and plays hockey and

582
00:36:47.841 --> 00:36:50.990
they're just letting them score right and left.
I got a fucking post that video,

583
00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:53.780
you know,
that's that type of shit.
You know what I mean?

584
00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:59.480
Like do you think they'd let Donald Trump score?
They probably would,

585
00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:02.430
but we always had that thing all,

586
00:37:02.431 --> 00:37:04.690
they're not like they're letting them score cause they don't want to get sent to

587
00:37:04.691 --> 00:37:09.600
Siberia.
Um,
a high bill.
Hey,

588
00:37:09.601 --> 00:37:11.920
you know something?
I would like to hear from more Russian people.

589
00:37:11.921 --> 00:37:14.650
I want you guys to infiltrate my fucking podcast here.

590
00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:20.020
Like you did the last election.
Oh,
a hot take.
I don't even know if he did that.

591
00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:25.510
Um,
I have no idea.
I don't pay,
I don't watch the news.
Um,
a ARP,

592
00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.710
hi bill.

593
00:37:26.711 --> 00:37:30.970
I heard on your podcast that you received a r p invitation to join.

594
00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:36.240
The biggest benefit we get from arp is that it is a very large lobbyists for us.

595
00:37:37.691 --> 00:37:41.770
Old People.
Please join.
Thanks.
Oh my God.
Did I just joined a group?

596
00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:47.500
Um,
yeah.
For those of you didn't listen last week I tr uh,
I'm 50 years old now.

597
00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:51.130
Mooc makes me qualified for Aa,
our P and I can,

598
00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.820
I can go to the movies for like $8.
You know,

599
00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:59.740
I can get a custom cane walking cane or something if I want.

600
00:37:59.741 --> 00:38:04.510
There's a whole bunch of things I can do.
Um,
I'm actually,
you know what,

601
00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.950
I was on the road and I saw there was an email.

602
00:38:05.951 --> 00:38:10.530
It was something I needed to fill out.
Um,
anyways,

603
00:38:10.531 --> 00:38:14.370
plowing ahead further.
You know,
I gotta be honest with you guys,

604
00:38:14.371 --> 00:38:17.450
I'm always honest on this podcast.
Last night,
yeah.

605
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:22.500
Had this little square of fucking weed and she goes,
take a bite of it.

606
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:25.460
I got,
I hate eating wheat.
I don't like eating it.
And she goes,
no,

607
00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.500
just try as like,
I don't,
I don't want to do.
So she talks me into it.

608
00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:32.490
I'm eating dinner and I ate the fucking thing and I never really felt anything.

609
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:36.890
And about 10 minutes ago on this podcast of a sudden it fucking hit me like 12

610
00:38:36.891 --> 00:38:40.700
hours later.
You know,
I'm not like fucking tripping,

611
00:38:40.701 --> 00:38:44.620
but I think that's why I was reading like x,
x,
x,

612
00:38:44.621 --> 00:38:46.990
x twice instead of once.
I have no idea.

613
00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:49.180
I thought this shit is supposed to make it clearer.

614
00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:50.790
<v 0>Okay.</v>

615
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:53.760
<v 1>I really Miss Booze.
I mean,
you just kind of know what's going to happen.</v>

616
00:38:53.761 --> 00:38:57.150
Like what,
what's going on right now?
Is this like some Bruce Lee shit.

617
00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:01.980
It's my brain swell up now and I just keel over on my own podcast.
Um,

618
00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:05.930
anyways,
nutrition.
You goofy,

619
00:39:05.931 --> 00:39:10.580
bald headed baldheaded potato looking.
Fuck Jesus Christ.

620
00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:14.420
You're harsh in the mellow man.
I know.

621
00:39:14.421 --> 00:39:18.200
You were looking to go to a nutritionist for advice.
Be warned.

622
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:23.480
This industry isn't particularly well-regulated.
Yeah,
I know.
I know.

623
00:39:23.481 --> 00:39:27.620
It's terrifying.
Basically once they,
they have that degree,

624
00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:32.660
they don't have any oversight like real doctors.
If they fuck you over,

625
00:39:32.661 --> 00:39:36.800
there's only so much that you can do.
Well I could sue them,

626
00:39:36.801 --> 00:39:38.600
but the already saying they don't have the money of a doctor.

627
00:39:38.601 --> 00:39:40.970
So what's the point?
A here's what you should do.

628
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.540
A find a nutritionist that provides advice based on lab work.

629
00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:49.720
Most of these cuts we'll just have you keep a food journal and then give you

630
00:39:49.821 --> 00:39:52.010
advice based on what you ate over the week.

631
00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:55.310
This is stupid and it can be both misleading and inaccurate.

632
00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:59.940
Not to mention expensive
lab

633
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:06.770
for finance person that provides advice based on lab work.
Well,
I mean it's,

634
00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.400
it's can't you just fucking sit there thrown out stats.

635
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.200
Four to five doctors recommended this has barriers.
Um,

636
00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:18.820
anyways,
be whatever product they get you to start taking.

637
00:40:18.821 --> 00:40:23.020
Ask them if they get money for the referral and what are they going to say?

638
00:40:23.021 --> 00:40:25.990
Yes,
I'm a good nutritionist.

639
00:40:25.991 --> 00:40:29.680
Won't try to sell you something just because they get a kickback and an even

640
00:40:29.681 --> 00:40:30.401
better one.

641
00:40:30.401 --> 00:40:33.730
We'll give you a list of options of things you could do based on your blood
work.

642
00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:35.830
And I make this all makes sense,
I guess.
Hey,

643
00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.660
people that have to give their opinion,

644
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.510
give you their credentials as a means of validating their opinion.

645
00:40:40.511 --> 00:40:41.440
But for context,

646
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:46.630
I'm a member of Team USA and competed in the 2006 Olympics in Rio.

647
00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.320
Jesus Christ,
it fucking thrown your Dick on the table here.

648
00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:55.240
The only reason why I say this is that a is for the example that team USA is

649
00:40:55.241 --> 00:41:00.241
sponsored by Coca Cola and even our nutritionist attempt to hook us up on

650
00:41:00.341 --> 00:41:05.230
protein brand,
um,
on a protein brand owned by coke.

651
00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:06.790
Yeah.
It's how it works.

652
00:41:06.791 --> 00:41:10.630
Everybody has a side deal despite it being an inferior and more expensive

653
00:41:10.631 --> 00:41:15.220
product.
Wow.
They recommended it to the athletes,

654
00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:19.360
isn't that,
and there was,
and there was gold medals on the line anyways,

655
00:41:19.361 --> 00:41:21.130
just saying,
be careful who you listen to.

656
00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:25.300
They even do elite athletes with this shit.
Well,
you know what?

657
00:41:25.301 --> 00:41:30.280
That's probably one of the most informed fucking emails I ever read or are.
Yeah,

658
00:41:30.281 --> 00:41:34.100
I guess it is an email write letter.
And I was like,
oh,
when I was a kid,

659
00:41:34.101 --> 00:41:36.890
they called him letters.
Yeah,
I know.
I have to watch out for that.

660
00:41:36.891 --> 00:41:41.310
I'm one of the reasons I got a nutrition in this.
It is because,
um,

661
00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:44.740
when I went online,
anything that I looked up about food,

662
00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:46.780
I mean the whole front,

663
00:41:46.781 --> 00:41:51.460
I don't know how many pages was just all big time websites and um,

664
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.150
and then just confirm everything was conflicting.
You know,
these are good.

665
00:41:56.151 --> 00:41:59.570
Don't eat those.
I'll tell you he got belly flat.
You know what the problem is?

666
00:41:59.571 --> 00:42:04.030
Bananas.
A lot of people think banana is a fucking just like,
you know,

667
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:05.980
I don't know how long when people do that.

668
00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.770
You start telling you like certain fruits and vegetables are bad for you.

669
00:42:08.771 --> 00:42:12.250
It's like,
yeah,
well I imagine if I eat a fucking Bushel,
love him.
It's not good.

670
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.670
But isn't it also like some sort of a potassium or some shit I get out of

671
00:42:15.671 --> 00:42:20.290
bananas.
I Dunno.
Gorillas eat them.
They look pretty fucking buff.

672
00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:25.680
A 23.
And me,
uh,
here's the old Billy cito.

673
00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:30.570
Oh,
hey there Billy.
Ultimately Cheeto Dick.
Oh Man.
Come on man.

674
00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:35.280
A link to the article at the bottom,
but I know you don't read.

675
00:42:35.281 --> 00:42:38.720
So here's the gist.
All right,
hang on a second.

676
00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:41.810
23 and me is getting lots of money from big pharmacy.

677
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:47.190
What the fuck is this?
Okay.
Anyway,
he goes,
all right.
He goes,

678
00:42:47.191 --> 00:42:49.440
you were absolutely right.
This company,

679
00:42:49.441 --> 00:42:54.441
23 and me is set to make 300 million from sharing their users generic

680
00:42:54.931 --> 00:42:58.290
information with big pharmacy.
Oh,
is that one of those,
uh,

681
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.510
<v 0>okay.</v>

682
00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.190
<v 1>Like ancestry.com websites.
Uh,</v>

683
00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:07.240
they say it's so the bank company can use the data to develop medical

684
00:43:07.371 --> 00:43:11.730
breakthroughs,
Isam ship.
But I'm sure we all know that's bullshit except,

685
00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:15.980
except to see robot replacements within a decade or two anyway,

686
00:43:15.981 --> 00:43:20.120
so you could use some vindication from a fellow conspiracy nuts,

687
00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:24.890
have a good one and go swap your own spit,
go fuck yourself.
Um,

688
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:29.130
I would actually guess that
all of that is true.

689
00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.690
Okay.
They're going to use all of that information,

690
00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:38.530
um,
to develop new drugs,
I would think because they're trying to make money,

691
00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:42.970
none of which will cure you.
They'll just keep you up,
you know,
on the hook.

692
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:47.710
We'll keep them all just alive enough that he keeps buying her a little pill.
Um,

693
00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:51.370
and then I also think the robots are going to come.
Absolutely.
You know,

694
00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.260
but the bottom line is,

695
00:43:52.261 --> 00:43:55.540
is the people who are making the robots are overseeing it.
Earl so human.

696
00:43:55.900 --> 00:44:00.880
So it's in their best interest to try and cure shit for other humans.

697
00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:06.250
Right.
I already told you my philosophy.
Right.
Am I fucking theory was basically,

698
00:44:06.251 --> 00:44:10.300
I should've told you guys about that fucking stupid pot square thing.

699
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:13.250
Cause right now you're like oh man,
this is just cause he's high.
You know,

700
00:44:13.251 --> 00:44:17.370
fucking people who are like into,
we'd always give it credit.

701
00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:20.340
You know,
like I didn't already have this thought.

702
00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:24.900
I had this paranoid thought stone sober alone in a hotel room.

703
00:44:24.901 --> 00:44:25.680
This is what I think.

704
00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.820
I think that they're going to fucking use that shit to build robots and then

705
00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:31.110
they're going to kill everybody off,

706
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:35.460
keep a certain amount of people alive and their job's going to be to like keep

707
00:44:35.461 --> 00:44:39.570
reproducing so the Illuminati can harvest the organs.

708
00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:45.780
I swear to God that's got to be from the weed man.
No,
I swear to God,

709
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.630
I've actually said that on stage this weekend.

710
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:51.720
Stone's Silva after eating a salad.
You know,

711
00:44:51.721 --> 00:44:54.750
a lot of those salads actually have chemicals sprayed all over him.

712
00:44:54.751 --> 00:44:58.980
So you're actually,
I know,
I know.
There's no fucking way around it.
Alright,

713
00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:03.780
Bill from a lady,
uh,
hey,

714
00:45:03.781 --> 00:45:08.100
build the blahzay blahzay cunt,
the Blazo Kat,
um,

715
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:13.130
I'm a relatively recent listener of your podcast as if seeing you at cluster

716
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:15.630
fest in San Francisco a year ago.

717
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.213
<v 3>MMM.</v>

718
00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.070
<v 1>That sentence makes no sense.</v>

719
00:45:20.071 --> 00:45:24.360
I am a relatively recent listener of your podcast as of seeing you at cluster

720
00:45:24.361 --> 00:45:28.860
fest in San Francisco a year ago.
All right.
I guess that does make sense,

721
00:45:28.861 --> 00:45:32.640
but it's kind of written it up.
Passive aggressive Shakespearian way.

722
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.730
You could've fucking arranges the letters a little more,
uh,

723
00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:37.660
straightforward there.

724
00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:45.490
All right.
I'm not going to lie.
That one right there.
That was the weed.

725
00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:48.400
I literally have a meeting in a half hour.

726
00:45:48.401 --> 00:45:49.710
Like what the f I'm just going to fuck.

727
00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.420
I can't imagine the show I'm going to agree to do.
All right.

728
00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.130
Not Looking where I was going.

729
00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.330
I almost accidentally walked into you while you were on your way to interview

730
00:45:58.331 --> 00:46:01.690
Jerry Seinfeld.
Uh,
most of the same way.

731
00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:06.220
I probably came off as rude from my deer in the headlight moments of literally

732
00:46:06.221 --> 00:46:09.190
running into one of the best comedians of all time that I write this.

733
00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.520
So I hope you can accept my late apology.

734
00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:14.430
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

735
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:17.580
<v 1>What am I in fucking in Lord of the rings here?
Yeah,
I see.
You are forgiven.</v>

736
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:19.350
She is spared.

737
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:23.850
I thought your interview and headliner act was terrific and hope to see another

738
00:46:23.851 --> 00:46:27.360
one of your shows.
That was one of the coolest fucking days ever,
by the way.

739
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:32.220
I fucking got,
got to do a and [inaudible] show that day.

740
00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:36.360
No,
it was,
it was the day after I'd finished my show the next day.
Uh,

741
00:46:36.361 --> 00:46:39.540
I got to interview Jerry Seinfeld in a theater in front of them,
I don't know,

742
00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:43.650
a couple thousand people while he promoted the latest season of comedians in

743
00:46:43.651 --> 00:46:48.510
cars.
Had a great time.
And then I walked out the door and,

744
00:46:48.511 --> 00:46:50.410
uh,
had a car service to go over.

745
00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:51.760
<v 3>Okay.</v>

746
00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.080
<v 1>With Josh Adam Meyers.</v>

747
00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:57.040
We had booked a car service to go into the NBA finals to see like game three of

748
00:46:57.041 --> 00:46:59.500
the NBA finals.
Um,

749
00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:03.640
golden state versus the Cleveland Warriors and the driver was so cool.

750
00:47:03.641 --> 00:47:05.320
He let us smoke cigars in the back.

751
00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:07.043
<v 3>Come on man.</v>

752
00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:11.000
<v 1>Great fucking days of my life.
Anyways.
Um,</v>

753
00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:15.890
I'm glad you mentioned you wanted more women to write to your show.
I would love,

754
00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:19.170
yeah,
cause I love trashing you.
No,
I'm kidding.
I would like to hear what it is.

755
00:47:19.171 --> 00:47:23.150
Shit you think I would love if you had more female guests on your podcast.

756
00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:24.870
Oh Geez.

757
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:32.020
I don't think I've ever had a woman on my,
does that mean on sexist,
sexist,

758
00:47:32.021 --> 00:47:35.770
sexist?
I don't think I actually appealed to women.

759
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.570
And I can tell you why.

760
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:42.600
Because my shows a sausage fest and when I go outside I can't even tell you how

761
00:47:42.881 --> 00:47:44.080
many times somebody will be like,

762
00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:49.120
it'll be a couple and they want a picture and like the wife or girlfriend takes

763
00:47:49.121 --> 00:47:53.830
the picture and they never want one.
Just the guy does.
So I mean,

764
00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:56.290
I dunno.
I think maybe this is just like a,

765
00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:57.573
<v 0>okay.</v>

766
00:47:58.500 --> 00:47:58.891
<v 1>I Dunno.</v>

767
00:47:58.891 --> 00:48:02.730
I'm trying to think of something that's so strictly for guys like footballs,

768
00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:05.460
you know,
basically that version.

769
00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.270
I'm trying to pick something when actually offend women footballs and for

770
00:48:09.271 --> 00:48:13.050
everybody.
Anyways,
I was wondering if you could give me some dating advice.

771
00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:14.400
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

772
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:18.900
<v 1>Um,
society generally teaches women at a young age that men are suitors and women</v>

773
00:48:18.901 --> 00:48:22.920
are courted.
But as a 27 year old woman who dates women,

774
00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:27.990
sometimes it gets particularly difficult to figure out who does what role,

775
00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:30.690
especially if both women are very feminine.
Well,

776
00:48:30.691 --> 00:48:34.890
at that point you got to step it up.
Also just be a staring contest,

777
00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.550
right?
Sometimes these roles just fit naturally,

778
00:48:38.551 --> 00:48:43.020
but other times there isn't a clear sense of direction and the whole thing just

779
00:48:43.021 --> 00:48:47.340
falls apart.
Let me asked you this.
All right.
Because opposites attract.

780
00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.070
They always say,
um,

781
00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:54.720
and I've dated people who are too similar to me and it's just,

782
00:48:54.721 --> 00:48:57.180
we want a yin and a Yang.
We would to yangs.

783
00:48:57.181 --> 00:49:00.900
So we had half the fucking thing taken care of and the rest was a shit show.

784
00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:04.500
So when the lesbian world,
all right,
if both women are feminine,

785
00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:09.510
does that have less of a chance of making it as a relationship we want to hear

786
00:49:09.511 --> 00:49:13.650
from lesbians were taking college it fat,
fat,
fat.
Uh,

787
00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:15.650
sometimes these roles just fit naturally,

788
00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:19.050
but other times there isn't a clear sense of direction and the whole thing just

789
00:49:19.051 --> 00:49:19.884
falls apart.

790
00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:24.990
I'm also not naturally comfortable with approaching women at bars or social

791
00:49:24.991 --> 00:49:28.710
events that eventually wait for someone else to make the first move.

792
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:32.700
Risa,
why you got all the power?
Because it's,
it's,
it's,

793
00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:38.670
it's all women,
right?
So there's no fucking,
there's nothing,

794
00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:42.900
there's nothing holding you back here other than that voice in your head going,

795
00:49:42.901 --> 00:49:45.630
what if she says no?
Recently,

796
00:49:45.631 --> 00:49:49.320
I feel like I've missed out on some good opportunities for dates because of
this.

797
00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:53.850
What advice would you give to someone who isn't used to being the proactive or

798
00:49:53.851 --> 00:49:57.090
leading role in a dating situation?
Uh,

799
00:49:57.150 --> 00:50:01.200
thanks and best wishes to your family.
Oh yeah.
And Go fuck yourself.
Well,

800
00:50:01.201 --> 00:50:03.660
why don't you just start hitting on somebody you're not interested in.

801
00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:09.330
You don't just as practice and just say that stupidest,
dumbest,

802
00:50:09.331 --> 00:50:14.280
most over the top shit.
I mean,
I'm applying to this
two as a guy,

803
00:50:14.281 --> 00:50:17.010
if you're afraid to talk to women,
it's kind of like a,

804
00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:20.990
you got to see the humor in it.

805
00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:24.950
You guys see the humor and getting up thinking someone gave you a look like,

806
00:50:24.951 --> 00:50:25.850
yeah,
I'm in to you.

807
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:30.200
And you walk all the way over there and it turns out they were looking at

808
00:50:30.201 --> 00:50:34.280
somebody else or whatever you say to them,
just completely bombs.

809
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:36.710
And then instantly in that moment,
you know,

810
00:50:36.711 --> 00:50:38.930
I should just turn around and walk back to where I was,

811
00:50:38.931 --> 00:50:43.280
but just out of some stupid pride,
you'll continue to stand there for 10 minutes,

812
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.190
no adding rather than ripping the bandaid off,

813
00:50:46.191 --> 00:50:50.360
just slowly tearing it off so that person can reject you for another fucking

814
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:55.520
sixth of an hour.
Um,
oh,
she said,
ps,

815
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:59.060
I've been Vegan for six plus years and found it does work.

816
00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.720
It does wonders for my health.
Changing my diet,

817
00:51:02.721 --> 00:51:07.610
literally cured a moderate skin condition I had since I was a child.

818
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:12.590
Uh,
if you're still curious about giving ved veganism a trust,
a test run,

819
00:51:12.591 --> 00:51:17.150
sorry.
I'd say try it out for a month and see how you feel.

820
00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:18.830
It definitely works for me,

821
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:23.450
but I know that's not the case for everyone and tries it.
Um,
yeah,

822
00:51:23.451 --> 00:51:25.670
I'm trying to be lazy about learning how to do it.

823
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.780
I just like go to a nutritionist,
teach me,
you know,

824
00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:34.600
I was just like,
hang out with somebody that's,
you know,
show me some,

825
00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.220
just give me a fucking bitch.
You know what?

826
00:51:36.221 --> 00:51:41.221
I wish they just had like a giant march madness like poster for how to be a

827
00:51:43.271 --> 00:51:45.640
Vegan,
like that.
Easy.
You know what I mean?
Like you look okay,

828
00:51:45.641 --> 00:51:49.900
these two teams play.
Now,
this team's names here,
so I know it won that game.

829
00:51:49.901 --> 00:51:53.410
I wish they could just fucking do that and break it down and the bracket leads

830
00:51:53.411 --> 00:51:57.310
to the finals,
which is protein or at least the fucking,
whatever the fuck,

831
00:51:57.311 --> 00:51:59.770
whatever else you need.
Carbohydrates.
I don't fucking know.

832
00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:04.530
I swear to God,
I am literally going to assume my girl,

833
00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:06.450
my wife for fucking drug in me here.

834
00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:11.250
I came to keep my fucking thoughts straight at this point.
Um,
girlfriends,

835
00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:15.840
arguably racist family.
Oh boy.
Oh Jesus.

836
00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:16.733
Uh,

837
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:21.300
I'm a black guy in Louisiana with the girlfriend who is white.

838
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:26.100
Her family is very religious and reserved as am I.

839
00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.880
Although we are kind of religious,
her and I,

840
00:52:29.881 --> 00:52:34.881
not our families per se where we have our beliefs and don't shut them down

841
00:52:35.041 --> 00:52:38.400
people's throats.
Anyways,
the problem is she has had,

842
00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:43.320
she had a kid with a black guy right before I met her.
All right.
She has a type,

843
00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.630
her kid is not even six months.

844
00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.540
He left her high and dry and wants nothing to do with them.

845
00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.730
Now seeing as we are in the south,

846
00:52:50.731 --> 00:52:54.450
I asked her a normal question down here,

847
00:52:54.451 --> 00:52:58.020
is your family okay with you dating a black guy?

848
00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:00.660
That question gets asked all over the country.
By the way,
it's,

849
00:53:00.661 --> 00:53:04.570
there's this myth that racism is just down in the south.
Um,

850
00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:06.750
she was very honest and said,
Eh,

851
00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:12.940
my mom and dad should be fine.
He eats fried chicken every Sunday.

852
00:53:12.941 --> 00:53:13.930
So you'd love him.

853
00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:19.310
She said that my grandparents generation,
uh,

854
00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:24.190
not so much.
Well,
she was making,
I guess this is a joke.

855
00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.560
This is one like reading it.
You're like,
I don't know how this was set anyways.

856
00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:32.720
Fair enough.
I'll work with that.
The problem is after she talked me up to her mom

857
00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:38.000
and her mom saw a picture of me,
she was like,
oh no,
he's black.

858
00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:43.300
You just going to get hurt.
So I don't know if her mom was just an error.

859
00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:44.650
<v 3>Okay.</v>

860
00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:47.290
<v 1>Inherit,
oh,
inherited the races more if she feels that way,</v>

861
00:53:47.291 --> 00:53:51.490
because a black guy ditched her pregnant daughter.
Uh,

862
00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.950
how do I approach this?
They live in the woods.

863
00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:57.650
<v 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

864
00:53:59.290 --> 00:54:02.980
<v 1>This sounds like fucking Tarantino movie.
You know,</v>

865
00:54:02.981 --> 00:54:05.620
one of those little shorts that he makes,
you know,

866
00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:09.190
and going back to visit them is kind of sketchy to me.

867
00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:13.840
And I haven't told my mom because she'd have an aneurysm.
Yeah.

868
00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:19.630
Don't go in the woods of fucking Louisiana to fucking visit some feels like get

869
00:54:19.631 --> 00:54:24.170
out.
Don't fucking do that.
And that kid.

870
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:29.440
Yeah,
the chicken.
Oh,
wait a minute.
This is get out you motherfucker.

871
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:31.680
<v 3>Is that what this is?</v>

872
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:38.480
<v 1>Oh,
I've been had,
you know what?
That's embarrassing.</v>

873
00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:43.280
Anyways.
Rough and rowdy broke.
No,
wait,
is it,
did she get pregnant that movie?

874
00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.580
No.
I don't know if that's real enough.
Hey,
Nia,

875
00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:55.000
she probably left.
Left the scene of the crime.
All right,

876
00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:57.250
well I've got a couple more advertisements to read here.

877
00:54:59.340 --> 00:54:59.840
<v 3>Okay.</v>

He's getting married in the summer,

881

there's no air conditioning in the fucking church.
And then they're the,

882

they're the ones always want to have the long fucking religious ceremony.
Um,

You're going to be doing it big and going out to all of your buddies weddings.

886
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:31.340

And lastly,
but not leastly simply safe,

909
00:56:58.520 --> 00:56:59.450
simply safe.

910
00:56:59.451 --> 00:57:03.650
These guys obsess over the details and it's why the alarm system is so good.

911
00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:04.820
Here's an example.

912
00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:09.821
A typical glass breaks since sometimes gets fooled of false positive sounds like

913
00:57:11.631 --> 00:57:15.620
drop plates,
a baby crying.
Uh,
I was,
I supposed to like,

914
00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:18.420
here's an example.

915
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.890
Was I supposed to like try to make a funny example?

916
00:57:22.891 --> 00:57:25.560
I never know what this copy simply safe,
uh,

917
00:57:25.561 --> 00:57:29.130
didn't want to settle for typical because really good home security should be

918
00:57:29.131 --> 00:57:33.600
really accurate.
So they actually constructed a glass break,

919
00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:37.650
test facility off something breaks.
Scholastica okay,

920
00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:43.190
just give me a break.
Glass Test Facility class break.

921
00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:46.970
They ran over 10,000 live glass breaks situations,

922
00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:51.380
refining their detection technology.
It was so accurate.

923
00:57:51.381 --> 00:57:54.260
It could distinguish a broken plate from a broken window.

924
00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.810
How fucking boring was that?

925
00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:01.070
And what does it,
some guy looking at like the,
the,

926
00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:06.100
the volume to see if it's the same sound wave to get 500 different sounds of

927
00:58:06.491 --> 00:58:11.020
broken glass.
What if somebody breaks a window with a wine glass?

928
00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:15.580
Honey,
sorry,
I'm not going to be home tonight.
Yeah,
I got a break.
Uh,
you know,

929
00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:19.210
I got to see what happens when you frisbee a plate into some fucking stained

930
00:58:19.211 --> 00:58:23.200
glass.
Um,
but you know what?
God bless these guys for doing it.

931
00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:27.010
