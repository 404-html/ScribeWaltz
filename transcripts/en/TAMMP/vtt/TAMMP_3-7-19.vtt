1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.190
Yeah.

2
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.520
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
Is Bill Burn?
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.</v>

3
00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:08.570
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.
And Ah,

4
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.380
just check it in on you.

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.490
I'm just checking in on you.
How are you?
How's your week going?

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.230
My Week is going fed fucking tastic man.

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.440
<v 2>I did my special,
I taped it.
It is done.</v>

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.240
It's in the can as they say in my business and now just needs to be edited.

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.990
Some poor pastors got to look at the footage and try to put that mess together.

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.710
I want to thank everybody that came out to a Royal Albert Hall in London,

11
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:42.300
England.
I could not have had a better time.
Um,
I just,

12
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.860
it's just a couple of magical nights out there and hopefully it'll show up on

13
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:49.560
the digital recording that we made

14
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.920
somehow that it will,
that will be conveyed.
Um,

15
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.240
so now I have no act.

16
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.220
<v 0>Okay.</v>

17
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.980
<v 2>And uh,
I was like,
you know what,
man,</v>

18
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:02.900
I'm just going to stay away from the comedy clubs.

19
00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:06.110
I'm just going to go live some life.
You've heard me all that yoga teachers,
Shit.

20
00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:10.250
I was saying just going to go live some life and I'm going to let the next hour

21
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:13.430
come to me.
And I was literally thinking already tonight,

22
00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:15.710
I've been back for fucking 24 hours being like,

23
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.500
maybe I'll go down to the club tonight,
Dan.
I just go fuck around.

24
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.973
Yeah,

25
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.240
<v 1>no,
I,
I'm going to learn how to relax</v>

26
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.193
<v 2>man.</v>

27
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.160
No down and just fucking eat an avocado or whatever the fuck it is.

28
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.280
You people do that,
know how to relax.
You guys fascinate me.

29
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.500
You people know how to relax.
You know what I mean?

30
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.400
Like you go to a hotel and you actually put on the robe,
right?

31
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.690
You get the slippers on and shit and then you fucking order room service and

32
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:51.660
you're eating chocolate strawberries from Sherry's berries.

33
00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:56.630
Whatever the fuck it is.
Should do,
you know,
you have a spa day.
Okay.
Um,
I,

34
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.880
I know I'm making fun of it,
but I am fascinated

35
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.090
<v 1>by that.
I want to be that guy,
that guy who knows how to fucking chill man,</v>

36
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.150
because I don't know how to do it because this is what I do.

37
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:12.180
I go and I'm not doing fucking standup.
And then I go,
you know what I'm gonna do?

38
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.750
I'm gonna get fucking 20 hours in the air in a helicopter,

39
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.440
or I'm going to go fucking play drums for fucking 30 hours.
This my,

40
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:20.520
I just fill the time up.

41
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.770
<v 2>You know,
you fucking people who could just sit on a porch.</v>

42
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.300
You don't,
I can't do that unless some slowly killing myself,
booze or cigar,

43
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.820
you know,
I can't just sit on a fuck,
give it just walk by,
you know,

44
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.150
and one of these sleepy southern towns,
you know what I mean?

45
00:02:41.151 --> 00:02:43.610
Where they still think like Lyndon Johnson was president,
right.

46
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:47.810
And you just walking down the fucking street and you just see somebody sitting

47
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.680
on a porch reading a book
and it's just,
you know,

48
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.610
that person,
they got it figured out.
You know what I mean?

49
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.280
<v 1>They walk into church on Sunday with head held high.</v>

50
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.510
<v 2>They got nothing to confess.
The fuck did they do?
Huh?
What is it,</v>

51
00:03:05.511 --> 00:03:08.500
a big sin that they peaked a few pages forward,

52
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.670
hoping that there'd be an end of a chapter to give their eyes a break,
you know,

53
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.250
disrespecting the author and all the hard work that they put in.
Um,

54
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.070
yeah,
I'm going to try to fucking chill out here at least for three days.

55
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.090
I'm going to try to do,
uh,
nothing,
but I mean,

56
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:30.880
I also have a table read tomorrow for F is for family.
So that's something,

57
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.070
<v 0>Eh,</v>

58
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.970
<v 2>uh,
whatever.
What are you gonna do,
you know,
having shit to do.</v>

59
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:41.730
It's better than having nothing to do right around my fucking that up.
Was it?

60
00:03:41.731 --> 00:03:43.540
Because at that fork in the road,

61
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:47.350
I chose boo boos rather than we'd,

62
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.750
you know,
the people who choose,
we'd,
they liked the people that like,
you know,

63
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.750
their dream in life is to retire,

64
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:58.743
<v 0>you know,</v>

65
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.000
<v 2>and people who drink their dream in life is to tell people what to do and the</v>

66
00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:04.140
people go out and do it.

67
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.640
All right.
I'm paying with a broad brush here,

68
00:04:11.641 --> 00:04:14.520
but that's what I do on this podcast.
All right?

69
00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:18.060
None of this is fucking necessarily worked out.
You know,

70
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.140
there's the occasional goddamn setlist.
All right,
let's,
let's,
let's go.

71
00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:26.700
You know what I always do when I go to put together a new hour is I have to go

72
00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:31.290
topical.
Let's say what said the news?
Everybody.
R Kelly.

73
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.180
<v 0>Okay.</v>

74
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.900
<v 2>Bobby Kelly.
My good,
my old roommate,
just plain [inaudible],</v>

75
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.290
but the other r Kelly,
the singer,
right.

76
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.450
I'm trying to think of one of his fucking songs.
I used to know,

77
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.270
I used to know his songs.
Then they took the,
the videos away from MTV.

78
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.860
The like the last one I saw that he made was the one where he was sitting down

79
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.910
and he had half his head braided while someone was Braden is the other part of

80
00:04:58.911 --> 00:05:01.760
his fucking head.
You know,

81
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.830
and God knows what happened to that poor woman judge it by that fucking debacle

82
00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:08.150
of an interview.
Okay.

83
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.810
<v 1>I
like,</v>

84
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.970
<v 2>he is,
he is</v>

85
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.970
<v 1>fucked.
That's all I got out of that.
I had not get a,</v>

86
00:05:20.971 --> 00:05:24.360
I am an innocent man accused of some shit that I didn't do.
What I,

87
00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:28.110
the vibe from that is I am fucked.

88
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.820
<v 2>Um,
they got me this time.
God,
it,
um,</v>

89
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.003
<v 0>yeah.</v>

90
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.530
<v 2>You know,</v>

91
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.100
we know it's fucking hilarious when that guy was standing up screaming and

92
00:05:40.101 --> 00:05:42.800
yelling and that woman just sat there,
right?

93
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.760
How that became the opportunity for other Douche bags on the Internet to try and

94
00:05:50.631 --> 00:05:54.290
bring up some male female point,
you know,

95
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.270
to literally try to wedge.

96
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.650
They are fucking goddamn agenda.

97
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.590
We're literally talking about a guy who if this saying what he did,

98
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.960
if he did what they're,
say what he did,
this guy is a fucking monster.

99
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.560
This is about getting this fucking guy off of the god Damn Street before we can

100
00:06:10.561 --> 00:06:15.020
do this as somebody else.
But these selfish fucking assholes on the Internet.
Nah,

101
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:19.020
Nah,
Nah.
We're going to wet notice when he screams and yet,
and that reporter,

102
00:06:19.021 --> 00:06:23.480
she just sat there so stoically so defiantly so private.
It's,

103
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.730
that's what they teach you.
They teach you that in journalism class.

104
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.130
What do think a guy would have stood up and fought them?

105
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.390
So then all these women pile on and they start telling these stories of sitting

106
00:06:34.391 --> 00:06:37.750
quietly as their boyfriend punched the wall right next to their head.

107
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.890
These selfish fucking assholes took this moment in time,

108
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.990
a pedophile on alleged pedophile,

109
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:52.040
freaking the fuck out and all those victims.
Fuck all of them.

110
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:57.070
It's about you and whatever fucking went down during your fucking relationship

111
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:00.350
and how you were a total fucking victim.
You know what?

112
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.930
I got one thing to say to you guys,
ladies.

113
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.483
<v 3>All right,</v>

114
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.660
<v 2>we'll,
we'll fucking get to you on this one.</v>

115
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.660
This is about the women who actually were fucking a victim of this guy.

116
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.780
Stop trying to fucking,
you know,
you know what it's like.

117
00:07:15.781 --> 00:07:20.100
It's like back in the day whenever I see stuff about hair metal bands and the in

118
00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:23.610
the eighties on the sunset strip and you'd go up and you'd staple your fucking

119
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.481
banner,

120
00:07:24.481 --> 00:07:28.950
you little flyer up to a telephone pole and then two seconds later somebody else

121
00:07:28.951 --> 00:07:31.740
would staple.
There's over yours.
That's what the fuck is going on.

122
00:07:31.741 --> 00:07:35.730
It even happens on shit like this.
It's so God damn shameless,
you know?

123
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.500
<v 3>Okay</v>

124
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.520
<v 2>Lady,
she got to ask yourself something.
All right,</v>

125
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.800
if more than one time a man in your life punches a hole in a wall right near

126
00:07:44.801 --> 00:07:49.240
your head,
at any point,
is there any sort of self reflection where you're like,

127
00:07:49.241 --> 00:07:50.980
why do I keep picking this guy?

128
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.840
Or what exactly is it that I'm saying to the opposite sex that is causing this

129
00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:56.674
behavior?

130
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.350
Speaking from experience.
You know,

131
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.580
I remember when I got to my mid thirties and I was like,
dude,
chicks of fucking,

132
00:08:05.581 --> 00:08:08.110
oh,
they're all fucking psychos.
You know,
and by then I was just like,

133
00:08:08.111 --> 00:08:11.200
wait a minute,
but what are you doing?
What are you doing?

134
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.653
<v 3>You know?</v>

135
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.030
<v 2>It actually turned around and I looked at myself and I said,
oh,</v>

136
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.740
this is what I'm doing.
You know?
And then I,
I decided to stop,
you know,

137
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.130
fishing in the same area,
pulling out the same God damn fish.

138
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.343
<v 3>Right?</v>

139
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.790
<v 2>I blamed the victim</v>

140
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.463
<v 3>and all of that.</v>

141
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.730
<v 2>It's all you women out there who you know,
shaking the plaster Rati your hair,</v>

142
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.240
you know,
every once in a while,
you know,

143
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.300
every once in a while it might be you.

144
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:47.450
I'm just saying like just say one out of 3 million times when someone punches a

145
00:08:48.151 --> 00:08:49.260
wall near your head,

146
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:54.650
maybe you shouldn't bring up things about his family or whatever the fuck it is

147
00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:58.440
that said,
uh,
blows other times,
you know,

148
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:02.340
the guys who are aggressive and they shouldn't do that.
And um,
you know,

149
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:05.010
maybe they wouldn't be so many home depots out there if there weren't so many

150
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:08.610
guys with misdirected anger,
punching holes right next to their girlfriends heads

151
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.780
are Kelly,
could you just shut up for a second with your pedophilia?

152
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:19.170
This woman here has some plaster in our hair and she would like to,
uh,

153
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:23.430
tell her story.
Wireless is going down if you don't mind.
Um,

154
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.080
alright,
plowing ahead here.
So,
uh,
oh,

155
00:09:29.081 --> 00:09:31.030
you know what,
I got into the premier league a little bit,

156
00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.970
cause I know Liverpool was up by one point.
And from what I heard,

157
00:09:33.971 --> 00:09:37.990
by the time we get to Manchester,
man city was up by one point.

158
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:40.563
<v 3>So</v>

159
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:46.140
<v 2>let's see.
Premiere league standings.
Oh,</v>

160
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:48.150
and everybody's trying to explain offsides to me.

161
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.660
All they can say is the reason why they have offsides is so people won't hang

162
00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:55.620
down at the other end of the net.
And other end of the pitch,
it's like,
well,

163
00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:59.550
why don't you just have a blue line like hockey?
All right.

164
00:09:59.551 --> 00:10:02.640
And then nobody can hang down by the other goal and then on,

165
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:06.750
and then if somebody bringing it down the fucking field and they're faster,

166
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.980
then the defensive line,
they get past.
I mean,

167
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:14.100
you have what's known in hockey as a break away.

168
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.290
The crowd gets on its feet and there's exciting shows.
Hey Scott,

169
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.370
Jesus fucking Christ,
he scored,

170
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.490
don't understand it.
I understand the not hanging thing.
Oh Man.

171
00:10:31.491 --> 00:10:34.760
City up by one fucking point.

172
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:37.220
<v 3>Okay.</v>

173
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.040
<v 2>All right.
And I,
I realized that somebody told me I was wrong.</v>

174
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:42.323
<v 3>That,
uh,</v>

175
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.860
<v 2>they don't have Saudi Arabian money behind them.</v>

176
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.063
<v 3>Uh,</v>

177
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:52.410
<v 2>they have,
uh,
Abu Dhabi,
Abu Dhabi,
Baba boy,</v>

178
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.700
they have that money behind him.
All right.
What's going on?
What's,
who's,

179
00:10:56.701 --> 00:10:59.760
who's playing less?
Just city is playing.

180
00:10:59.761 --> 00:11:02.640
Who gives a fleas are a bunch of fucking teams that aren't in it anymore.

181
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.250
I don't care about any of these fucking teams.

182
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.180
When his Liverpool or man city play a next,
that's,

183
00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:12.100
that's the two you got to get into all you fucking yanks,
fellow yanks.

184
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:16.540
Listen to this shit slide in.
Now,
at the end of the goddamn season,
um,

185
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:21.360
there's like 10 games left.
So,
you know,
if you watch all 10 Liverpool Games,

186
00:11:21.361 --> 00:11:25.830
you probably see about nine goals.
So buckle up for that excitement.

187
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:31.170
Offsides uh,
no,
it's not that bad.
I'm kidding.
All right.
Um,

188
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.510
what am I up to here?
By the way,
fucking jet lag to shit.

189
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.160
I had a great flight back.

190
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.970
I started to watch black Klansman and uh,

191
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.170
before the jetlag got to me and I really enjoyed that movie.

192
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.173
<v 3>MMM.</v>

193
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.590
<v 2>Adam driver in a,
I don't know the names of the people in the fuck.</v>

194
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:58.060
I'm not go with the names.
Um,
but I liked what everybody was doing in that movie.

195
00:11:58.061 --> 00:12:01.720
I liked the guy playing David Duke.
Um,

196
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:05.410
can I see anything else then I watch anything else?
I don't think I did.
Oh,

197
00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:09.790
you know what I watched?
I was really disappointed.
I Some I went on kids' TV.

198
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:15.310
Um,
I clicked that by accident and I,
you know,

199
00:12:15.311 --> 00:12:17.080
they had all the dumb fucking kid movies,

200
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:20.050
but then they had like three episodes of the Jetsons,

201
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.180
which was just the Flintstones,
which was just the honeymooners.
Alright.

202
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.680
So they had the Jetsons.
You don't meet George Jetson.

203
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.920
Bada Debbie eat at the bar at the Buddha,

204
00:12:31.921 --> 00:12:35.980
the Buddha Bahram [inaudible] his,

205
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.130
his boy l ry.

206
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:43.940
Then it's daughter Judy and they played it.
Why?
Why,
why,
why,
why horn?

207
00:12:43.941 --> 00:12:48.200
Like she's already blowing somebody.
Then Jane,
his wife,

208
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.090
Baba Baba Baba,
you know,

209
00:12:50.091 --> 00:12:52.040
he goes to hand her money and she grabs the whole wallet,

210
00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.850
goes to the shopping center,
Duh,
Duh.

211
00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:01.650
Ooh,
being bone.
Boom.
Bump up.
Right.
I watched it.

212
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.510
That fucking show sucked.

213
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:04.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

214
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.040
<v 2>We use the episode.
I saw,
it's like they weren't even try,</v>

215
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.580
just kind of went further and further down here.
The honeymoon is,

216
00:13:12.581 --> 00:13:15.820
was at like the highest level of funny.
And then the Flintstones,

217
00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:20.340
they got halfway up the hill and then if fucking Jetsons didn't even get out of

218
00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:22.060
it was so bad.
I didn't even watch the other ones.

219
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.800
It's like I used to watch this shit,

220
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.250
but what I will say about the Jetsons is how much shit they got right about the

221
00:13:27.251 --> 00:13:30.700
future.
They had video phones,
they had flat screen TVs,

222
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:35.010
they had robots in the fucking house talking to people.
Right.

223
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.290
The only thing they got wrong was the,
uh,
the workweek.

224
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.890
They thought with all the technology we were going to be working less.

225
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:46.270
And that was one of George Jetson's famous comedy lines,
big,
Oh God,
these,

226
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.870
these three day work weeks or murder,
you know,
flying cars.

227
00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:54.140
They got that wrong.
That hasn't happened yet.
But uh,

228
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:59.120
most of the technology is a,
is right out.
It's right up there,

229
00:13:59.121 --> 00:14:03.920
you know,
and in the future,
women are still spending their guys money.

230
00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:08.480
Like,
you know,
like there's no tomorrow.
I mean,
some things never change.

231
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.850
Um,
all right.
So anyways,
the big thing is tomorrow I got to go to the gym.

232
00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:19.390
I got to get back into the fucking gym because right now there's this big

233
00:14:20.301 --> 00:14:24.380
temptation where it's okay,
the big two things that I was shooting.
All right,

234
00:14:24.381 --> 00:14:28.580
my acting Gig at,
uh,
one day at a time or as the world turns,

235
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:32.570
General Hospital,
whatever the fuck I did,
one of those soap operas that's over.

236
00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.980
And then I did my standup special and that's over.
And I have no TV,

237
00:14:36.981 --> 00:14:38.750
no television,
no nothing coming up.

238
00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.840
This is one of these times we put on like 10 pounds,
right?

239
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.470
He'd go down to the local fucking bar,
you get yourself some wings,

240
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.440
you have a couple of fucking beers it.
Oh.
And you look at the bears like,
wow,

241
00:14:48.441 --> 00:14:51.980
that thing looks lonely.
How about a couple of little short next to it,
right?

242
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.810
And next thing you know,
you're a fat fuck going.
Why did I do that?
So,

243
00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.433
<v 3>mmm.</v>

244
00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.630
<v 2>As I told you,
I'm not drinking this year,</v>

245
00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.560
taking the fucking year up and a,

246
00:15:04.561 --> 00:15:09.561
I'm getting the booze out of my house except for the pappies and uh,

247
00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.510
I'm just not going to have it in my house anymore.

248
00:15:12.511 --> 00:15:16.110
And then basically for the rest of my life,
if I want to go out fucking drinking,

249
00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.240
I will,
I'll go out and do it.

250
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.270
But just the amount of nights that when I come home,

251
00:15:21.271 --> 00:15:25.320
the fact that I won't have it in my house,
it's perfect.
I've kind of,

252
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.450
that I figured out that's the kind of booze hound I am.

253
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.990
It's like boost to me is like a half a gallon of ice cream in the freezer.

254
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.500
If it's there,
I'm going to fucking eat it.
Right.
The booze is there.

255
00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:40.250
I'm going to fucking drink it and uh,

256
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.740
and I like it and fucked up so I can't have it around.
That's basically it.
Oh,

257
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.620
just literally talking about it makes me want to do it now.
You know,

258
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:53.450
come on bill,
your did.
Um,
no,
I can't do that.
It's fucking stupid.

259
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:58.300
All right.
Not Living for myself anymore.
That's what you learn,
right?

260
00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.180
That's what the fuck.
That's what you learn when you have a kid.

261
00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.950
If you're doing it the right way,
you're not living for yourself anymore.
Stupid.

262
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.950
All right.
Put down the doughnuts.
Get rid of the cigars.

263
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:10.340
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

264
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.330
<v 2>You don't know.
I understand.</v>

265
00:16:11.331 --> 00:16:13.130
You know like when you look at your parents are like,

266
00:16:13.131 --> 00:16:17.270
why are they so goddamn boring?
Why do they just pick this regular fucking car?

267
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:20.540
Why didn't they get a cool car?
Why didn't they do any of this fucking shit?

268
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:25.430
And it's like,
oh,
because they were awesome.
Selfless fucking people.

269
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.090
That's why.
Okay.

270
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.660
And they made money and they wanted to have some leftover to,

271
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:37.810
to fucking give you when they died as opposed to going out and buying a bunch of

272
00:16:38.181 --> 00:16:42.970
Nice Shit for themselves.
Somewhere along the line.

273
00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.730
I think that was lost in today's America.

274
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.220
It really is like,
just the level,

275
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.430
the level of fashion that is fucking out there now

276
00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.420
is insane.
They used,
I mean they used to be,

277
00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:01.410
it was like fucking Andy Warhol and all the skinny doses that hung around with

278
00:17:01.411 --> 00:17:02.550
them more into fashion.

279
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:06.750
And a couple of movie stars and whatever and that was fucking it.

280
00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.310
You know,
housewives,
they were into fashion.
But Jesus Christ,

281
00:17:11.311 --> 00:17:14.820
I mean if they got something that Mrs Roper was wearing,
they,

once every three years they were happy.

289
00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:43.873
<v 3>I Dunno.</v>

290
00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.200
<v 2>People with fucking sneaker collections.</v>

291
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.980
When I was growing up,
you had,
you had a pair of sneakers.
That was it.

292
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.290
Like everybody had one pair of fucking sneakers.

293
00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:57.530
I don't give a shit what sport you are playing.
Yeah.

294
00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.480
Devastate you put on your chuck Taylors and you went out and you played it.

295
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.600
These are my cross trainers.
What are we playing?

296
00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:05.790
I have to go inside and get my soccer shoes.

297
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.400
Like that shit did not fucking exist.
And you know,

298
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.380
you fucking know good and God damn well,

299
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:14.220
a lot of it is bullshit other than like running,
I don't know,

300
00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:17.460
maybe they just got better at it.
I have no fucking idea.
You know,

301
00:18:17.461 --> 00:18:20.160
all these different kinds of genes,
all these different cuts.

302
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.530
There was basically when I was growing up,

303
00:18:22.531 --> 00:18:27.510
there was Levi's and whatever,
people who couldn't afford Levi's war,

304
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.860
which was wrangler,
it was tough skins.

305
00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:33.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

306
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.660
<v 2>And then I remember the gap.
The gap had jeans for awhile.</v>

307
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:38.843
Um,

308
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:44.550
but like the top of the line was fucking Levi's.
Oh Lee.

309
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:51.490
It was Levi's Lee Wrangler Toughskins and ember gap.

310
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.100
That was basically it.

311
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:58.230
That made fucking cheap jeans and corduroys and that was it.
You got two,

312
00:18:58.231 --> 00:19:02.770
three fucking pairs and you were good.
You're warm until you had fucking,

313
00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.890
until you,
you,
you made the holes in them and then that was it.

314
00:19:05.891 --> 00:19:10.120
And then eventually you fucking passed them on your mother put patches on them

315
00:19:10.121 --> 00:19:13.360
and pass them down to the next fucking kid.
That was it.

316
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:17.320
I look at some of the fucking childhood photos of me and the way the kids

317
00:19:17.321 --> 00:19:17.760
address,

318
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.650
we looked like we should have been hanging out with Tom Sawyer and huck Finn.

319
00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.280
People would like patches on the elbows of,
of,

320
00:19:25.281 --> 00:19:26.930
of their shirts and all of this shit.

321
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.380
And it wasn't like people were broke back then.
They just,
I dunno,

322
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.670
there was no Amazon there.
Like when I go down to the fucking store,

323
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:38.510
driving all the way out to the Goddamn moth,
gimme a patch,

324
00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:42.260
I'll just iron the sauna,
right?
Get outside fucking animal.

325
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.810
And that's the way it was done in 1970 [inaudible] where,
um,
all right,

326
00:19:47.811 --> 00:19:51.860
I'm totally,
I don't know what's going on in football,
not football,
sorry.
And uh,

327
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.690

328
00:19:53.691 --> 00:19:57.950
but I aims to sit down tonight and watch myself a couple of games so I can get

329
00:19:57.951 --> 00:20:02.951

369
00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:29.590
for reads and am I good?
Deep breath.
Here we go.
Simply safe.

370
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.660
Here's something interesting study.

371
00:22:32.661 --> 00:22:37.300
Show that security systems deter burglars.
It's a fact.

372
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.540
It's an asterick right next to its effect.

373
00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:44.380
And I can't see where I read the footnote.
Um,

374
00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:49.300
but there's still a burglary every eight seconds in America.
How well,

375
00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:53.410
think about it.
I don't want to think about it to explain it to me in the coffee.

376
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.160
I didn't come here to think,
came here to listen and buy shit.
All right,

377
00:22:57.161 --> 00:22:57.940
well think about it.

378
00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.570
Do Burglars give up just because some houses have security systems?

379
00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:03.490
You know what?
I don't know.
I haven't really,

380
00:23:03.491 --> 00:23:06.790
I can't remember last time I talked to somebody who openly admitted that there

381
00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:11.680
were a burglar.
Well,
fortunately they did the research.
Of course not.

382
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.530
They just find a house that isn't protected.

383
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:17.620
That's why securing your home is truly a necessity.

384
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:21.910
So let me recommend this brilliant security system built by my friends.

Here we go.

437
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.850
Sticker at the head.
Who gives a fuck?
She's got some tits.

438
00:26:38.851 --> 00:26:42.840
Were being progressive.
What happened to our next quarter profits?

439
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.190
We should have done

440
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:48.360
<v 2>a background shirt,
shirt,
a background background check.</v>

441
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.450
She really fucking sucks.
Alright,
me undies.

442
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.110
Ask yourself this one very important question.

443
00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.770
Um,
is your underwear making you happy at this very moment?

444
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:07.340
Mine isn't.
It's not making me sad either.
It's just sort of fucking,

445
00:27:07.341 --> 00:27:11.390
that wasn't really thinking about it.
Now I'm in my head,
right anyways.

446
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:15.350
Or are we not thinking about your underwear?
I was not beyond days.

447
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.410
<v 3>Okay.</v>

448
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:18.810
<v 2>This is getting exciting.
It's like,
it's like I read my thoughts.</v>

449
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.920
Wouldn't you like to be wearing underwear that is so soft that you can feel like

450
00:27:22.921 --> 00:27:26.640
you're making love to an actual cloud all day long?
Well,

451
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:30.960
what can I just be laying on the cloud?
Do I have to be fucking it?
Uh,
well,

452
00:27:30.961 --> 00:27:33.120
I've got one word for you.
Me undies.

453
00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.780
Buzzfeed said this about me undies.

454
00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:39.840
They feel like actual heaven against your skin.

455
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.480
What would the fuck is buzzfeed?
And when did they go to heaven?
Uh,

456
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:48.360
we're going to do assume heaven is really soft in this context.
As men said,

457
00:27:48.361 --> 00:27:51.630
they feel like silk drenched in hand.
Lotion.

458
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:56.040
These undies are so soft.
They make Bob Ross's voice.
Sound like Gilbert Godfrey.

459
00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.670
Gilbert Godfrey taken a little fucking smack there.
They're so soft.

460
00:27:59.671 --> 00:28:03.860
They think that Kenny g thinks about them to get inspired to write his next

461
00:28:03.861 --> 00:28:04.694
songs.

462
00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.013
<v 3>Okay?</v>

463
00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.360
<v 2>Oh,
I thought you would say this.
So soft.</v>

464
00:28:07.361 --> 00:28:10.660
They think Kenny g needs to be stopped with his devil music.
Uh,

465
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:14.320
me undies used the coveted micro modal modal fabric,

466
00:28:14.321 --> 00:28:18.310
which is a full three times softer than cotton.
Take that big cotton.

467
00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:19.720
You're puffy content.

468
00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:24.460
Not only will you feel your loins are being hugged by joy itself,

469
00:28:24.461 --> 00:28:27.790

478
00:28:56.861 --> 00:29:01.460
Go to [inaudible] dot com slash [inaudible] that's [inaudible] dot com slash

479
00:29:01.461 --> 00:29:05.860
burr.
All right,
so when you're jet lagged and you're over there in Europe,

480
00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:11.440
um,
what ends up happening is just shit starts popping into your head.

481
00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.653
<v 3>MMM.</v>

482
00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.760
<v 2>And I dunno what,
then you look it up and you're like,
my God,</v>

483
00:29:17.761 --> 00:29:21.240
I haven't thought about this in years.
And,
uh,

484
00:29:21.241 --> 00:29:22.890
one of the things that popped in my head,

485
00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:29.120
don't ask me why was that song by Doctor Hook sharing the night together?

486
00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.060
Oh my God.
Yeah.

487
00:29:34.061 --> 00:29:38.980
This is one of the great fucking easy listening fucking songs of all time and it

488
00:29:38.981 --> 00:29:40.030
gets a bad rap.

489
00:29:40.031 --> 00:29:45.031
You have to understand this is post Vietnam war post JFK getting assassinated

490
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.360
posts.
Bobby Kennedy posts.

491
00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:54.310
Fucking the bad acid at fucking Woodstock post all of that shit.

492
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:56.920
the 60s was a rough one.

493
00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:59.203
<v 3>You know,</v>

494
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:05.380
<v 2>people just wanted to listen to shit and not have to fucking think.</v>

495
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:09.730
All right,
which brought you music like this doctor Hook,

496
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:14.830
sharing the night together.
You got to listen to,
I'll post the video.

497
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:19.690
Uh,
but here are the lyrics.
You look and kind of lonely girl.

498
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:23.510
Would you lock someone new to talk to?

499
00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:27.970
I yeah,
are Rad.
I swear to God,

500
00:30:27.971 --> 00:30:32.290
he says that I'm feeling Canada lonely too.
And if you don't mind,

501
00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:36.850
can I sit right down here besides you?
Ah,

502
00:30:36.851 --> 00:30:40.520
Yay.
Ah,
Rad.
I swear to God,
this sounds like,
um,

503
00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:46.360
if this sounds like I'm making fun of a song,
but this is how it goes.
Um,

504
00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:51.100
so then it says,
you know,
if I seem to come on too strong,

505
00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:52.870
I hope that you will understand.

506
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.790
I say these things because I'd like to know if you're as lonely as I am and if

507
00:30:57.791 --> 00:31:01.760
you'd mind Sharon the night together,
we'll Hoho yeah.

508
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:05.290
Share and the Nad together.
Whoa,
whoa.
Yeah.
Right.

509
00:31:05.291 --> 00:31:10.291
Sharing the night together and later on he said we can bring in the morning girl

510
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:13.870
if you want to go that far.

511
00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:18.810
And if tomorrow finds us together right here the way we are,

512
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.840
would you mind basically,
hey,
you know,
I'll,

513
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.890
we can fuck if you want or I can just stand here and talk to you for the rest of

514
00:31:25.891 --> 00:31:28.230
the time.
Look it up,

515
00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.860
Doctor Hook Sharon the na had together.
Woo Hoo.

516
00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:37.770
Yeah.
Which then of course led me to doctor Hook,
sexy eyes.

517
00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.020
I was torturing Nia with this Sharon the night,
but then she actually,

518
00:31:43.021 --> 00:31:46.170
she likes sexy eyes.
Um,

519
00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.790
I don't know why I'm talking about this shit.
Oh,
how much time have I done?

520
00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:54.750
Have I have,
I haven't done my contractually obligated.
30 minutes here.

521
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:58.590
Have I spent my 30 minutes with you guys?
Um,
all right.

522
00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:02.520
So what did we learn on this little podcast thing here?
Um,

523
00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:07.550
don't punch a hole in the wall next to your girlfriend's head because if you do,

524
00:32:07.621 --> 00:32:11.430
she'll bring that story up while we're trying to catch a pedophile.

525
00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:18.270
That's something that should be,

526
00:32:18.271 --> 00:32:22.700
it's entirely own fucking,
you know.

527
00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:24.573
<v 3>Okay.</v>

528
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:28.590
<v 2>You know what it is.
I think,
I think guys need to start having,
you know,</v>

529
00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:31.350
you're not not that,
not that we don't bitch and we fucking listen to me.

530
00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.990
Jesus Christ.
I'd pitch it twice as much as any woman does,

531
00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:38.970
but it's not organized.
We need organized complaining like,

532
00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.810
you know,
just to balance this out.
So the next time you know,

533
00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.620
you see a woman doing something in a middle of a fucking important story,

534
00:32:47.621 --> 00:32:49.690
you can insert your agenda into it.

535
00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.110
And then if somebody comments on it in the wrong way,

536
00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:58.740
there's then a big fucking fall out and then some woman loses her.

537
00:32:58.751 --> 00:33:02.290
Yeah.
Job.
You got to fight fire with fire here.

538
00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:07.690
What'd you like to dance with me and hold me?
You know,

539
00:33:07.691 --> 00:33:12.140
I want to be holding you.
Ah,
yeah.

540
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.600
Oh right.
You guys don't,
am I allowed to play just like a second of that.

541
00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.530
I'll play just a second of it.
Let's see what happens.

542
00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.590
The worst thing I do is I is,
I put money in doctor hooks.
Fucking hands.

543
00:33:23.591 --> 00:33:26.520
I don't give a shit.
I like these guys.
All right.
Okay.

544
00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:30.560
This is the oldest song is there's like no advertising before it

545
00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.630
all your thoughts disappear.

546
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.540
<v 4>Some more new.</v>

547
00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:57.880
<v 2>It's my favorite thing ever.
Ah Yeah.
Oh Rad.</v>

548
00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:00.520
Try that tonight fellas.
There's your opening line.

549
00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.060
Just walk up to a woman and starts singing to it.
Sing that fucking song.

550
00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:07.510
Like when Tom Cruise sang that fucking song and top gun,
right.

551
00:34:08.410 --> 00:34:09.730
Just walk up to some woman,

552
00:34:09.731 --> 00:34:12.880
some poor fucker woman just trying to enjoy your God damn day.
Right?

553
00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:16.900
So he probably just,
you know,
punch some fucking wall near right.

554
00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:22.000
And she's just going out there,
right?
She cut his dick off or something.

555
00:34:22.001 --> 00:34:23.800
Whatever the fuck she did.
She's just sitting there.

556
00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:25.150
It's probably still in her purse.

557
00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:29.380
She's trying to enjoy the drink and just come up to her,

558
00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:33.470
tap her on the shoulder and just be like,
your looking kind of lonely girl.

559
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:38.600
Would you laksa want to talk to when she,

560
00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:42.680
right is she gives you the look like what the fuck you get to be like.
Ah,
yeah.

561
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:44.090
Ah Right.

562
00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:50.060
We can fucking go home and fuck.
Oh,
we could just stand here.

563
00:34:50.061 --> 00:34:53.840
We talked for a while.
Ah,
yeah.

564
00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:57.330
Right.
That was the seventies bed.

565
00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:00.540
You just parted your hair down the middle and you feathered it.

566
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:03.600
You grew a fucking beard.
That was it.

567
00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:07.470
You just came up with your pubes hanging out every which way when you just

568
00:35:07.471 --> 00:35:12.180
fucking said Shit.
As long as you tagged it with [inaudible].
Ah,
yeah.
Right.

569
00:35:12.181 --> 00:35:16.360
I guess you were in.
All right.
That's the podcast.
Everybody,
um,

570
00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.860
thank you to everyone who came out to the tour over the last year or so,

571
00:35:19.861 --> 00:35:21.450
and thank you to everyone who came out.

572
00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:26.610
I feel unbelievable about what we taped and um,

573
00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:32.490
I think it might be my best one.
That's what it feels like.

574
00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.870
And uh,

575
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:38.820
I still can't believe that I got to perform at Royal Albert Hall.
It was crazy.

576
00:35:38.821 --> 00:35:43.410
And the fact that I now have documented it in a special that's going to be

577
00:35:43.411 --> 00:35:47.130
coming out on Netflix,
maybe the summertime,
I don't fucking know.

578
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.910
I am so excited about that.
I can't even begin to tell you.

579
00:35:50.911 --> 00:35:55.080
And the fact that I went to,
like,
I added Liverpool this time,

580
00:35:55.081 --> 00:35:59.850
I had a great time.
So the next time I come out to the UK,

581
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:04.350
Ireland and all that shit,
right,
I'm going to do that,
run through Ireland,

582
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:08.220
go up to Northern Ireland and then go right down through Scotland and just,

583
00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.480
just do a bunch of fucking cities and uh,

584
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:16.290
and end up in London again.
And I got to tell you something.

585
00:36:16.291 --> 00:36:19.740
I don't know what happened this trip.
I've always been a Paris guide.
Some point,

586
00:36:19.741 --> 00:36:23.700
I don't know.
I'm starting to become a London guy.
I don't know what happened.

587
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.940
I'll tell you right now.
It's certainly not the fucking food,

588
00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:30.720
but just the vibe of that city.
I really like,
I was still always love Paris,

589
00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:36.000
you know?
But,
uh,
I don't know.
The last couple times I went there,

590
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.880
plus I gotta get back there.
I've never been to Wimbledon.

591
00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.780
That's the last tennis major I need to see life seen.

592
00:36:42.781 --> 00:36:47.040
A couple of US opens to French's in one fucking Australian and I've never been

593
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.660
to the,
the greatest one,

594
00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:52.440
the one on the grass to grass fucking court practice at Wimbledon with Dick

595
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.041
Enberg rest his soul.

596
00:36:53.041 --> 00:36:57.060
When I was growing up and I used to watch Bjorn Borg verse John Mcenroe and then

597
00:36:57.061 --> 00:37:01.200
Mac was the guy and then a uh,
what's his face came through there?

598
00:37:01.201 --> 00:37:05.250
Boris Becker,
right?
The redheaded German guy.
I'm like,
oh my God,

599
00:37:05.251 --> 00:37:07.470
there's another one out there.
Right.

600
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:12.810
He came in 17 years old,
one in fucking 85.
You know,

601
00:37:12.811 --> 00:37:16.170
von Lender was always there looking like a fucking giant.
Uh,

602
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:22.240
I know he always looked more like a rockstar to me.
Like that guy.
Oh saying that,

603
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:26.240
talk about pop music,
pop music man,

604
00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:29.130
that Guy London salt,
they had,
fuck,
it's opt in.

605
00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:33.160
Everybody talking about pop music,
you look and he was new wave.

606
00:37:33.161 --> 00:37:34.570
He looked like a new wave singer to me,

607
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:39.820
and then it was going east east and he featured bitch or whatever it was.

608
00:37:39.821 --> 00:37:42.340
That other guy,
Jim Courier,
who kind of looked like Phil Sims,

609
00:37:42.341 --> 00:37:46.900
his younger brother.
I can't believe I remember all these guys,
right?

610
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.580
And right as I was getting used to all of them,

611
00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:54.400
then all of a sudden came fucking,
uh,
what's his face from Vegas rule?

612
00:37:54.401 --> 00:37:57.280
One of the best books I ever saw open ever read,

613
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:03.560
fuck is his name.
He named,
he married a Steffi Graf.

614
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:07.680
He had to shave his head,
like make,

615
00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:12.420
and now he just has a beer Jay way.
I went,
the fuck's his name.

616
00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:20.580
The fuck is his name.
I saw him play

617
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:25.550
whatever.
And then fucking a peach.

618
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:30.420
Sanford's then I started doing comedy right around then what the fuck is that

619
00:38:30.421 --> 00:38:31.254
guy's name?

620
00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:35.860
He stole the fucking commercials about being a rebel.

621
00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:43.030
This is going to torture me
second.
I,

622
00:38:43.031 --> 00:38:45.170
I did.
You can't,
I can't.
This,
these,

623
00:38:45.171 --> 00:38:47.510
one of the only fucking people that went on all four surfaces.

624
00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:54.460
I gotta look it up and there's no fucking way I'm closing this fucking podcast.

625
00:38:54.461 --> 00:38:59.410
Not knowing who that guy's name is.
Tennis Book.
Open.
Boom.

626
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:01.900
What do you mean I'm not connected to the Internet?

627
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:06.550
I'm always connected to the Internet.
God dammit.
Come on.

628
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.570
He didn't even want to fucking play.

629
00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:16.620
Oh fuck you open.

630
00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:21.380
And our Andre August seat.
Jesus Christ.
Bill.

631
00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.850
Call yourself a sports fan.
Andre Agassi.
That's right.

632
00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.030
That's right.
And then I don't know where it went.

633
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:36.230
Then the next guy who came along there was that guy who he looked like a,

634
00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:40.830
the guy from dude,
where's my car?
Who did punked and married Demi Moore.

635
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:45.120
Ashton Kutcher.
It was a tennis player that looked like him.

636
00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:49.650
And then there was the,
the the Croatian dude who just,
we just won the French,

637
00:39:49.651 --> 00:39:53.020
the knee.
I can't fucking remember.

638
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.960
I don't,
I don't pretend to understand shit.
All right.
You know,

639
00:39:58.961 --> 00:40:02.110
I could've just ended on how psyched I was about my special rather than fucking

640
00:40:02.111 --> 00:40:05.410
talking about tennis.
But you know,
isn't that the charm of this podcast?

641
00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:08.290
All right,
I hope I got you through your workout or whatever.

642
00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:12.830
The fuck it is you did,

Huh?

643
00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:16.570
You almost home.
Do you want me to keep talking?
Oh my God.

644
00:40:16.571 --> 00:40:21.040
Can we be like podcast best days and you just fucking talk to,
you know what?

645
00:40:21.041 --> 00:40:25.930
Fuck you.
I got shit to do.

I got shit to do.

646
00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:29.520

You know what,
you know,
here's,

647
00:40:29.521 --> 00:40:30.840
here's the thing,
the,
uh,

648
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:33.490
Andrew's going to play a little bit of fucking music here and then after the

649
00:40:33.491 --> 00:40:38.410
music is going to be a half hour greatest hits from a Thursday afternoon,

650
00:40:38.411 --> 00:40:41.860

I don't know,

651
00:40:41.861 --> 00:40:44.500
a year ago,
four years ago.
I don't even know how long I've been doing these.

652
00:40:44.501 --> 00:40:47.650
And uh,
that'll fill up your hour.
All right?
So that's it.

653
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:51.610
<v 5>Okay.
God bless all yet.</v>

654
00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:56.670
Have a great weekend and I'll see you [inaudible]

655
00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:03.110
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

656
00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:36.683
share with them.

657
00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:42.550
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

658
00:41:42.551 --> 00:41:46.030
It's [inaudible] and it's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

659
00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:50.690
March 7th,
2011 there.

660
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:55.210
I set it right.
2011,
2011.
Um,

661
00:41:56.270 --> 00:42:00.210
I'm down here in Miami,
Miami beach.
I did the,
uh,
south beach comedy festival,

662
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:05.170
this,
this,
uh,
this past Friday night.
And uh,
the fuck did I do,

663
00:42:05.171 --> 00:42:09.730
I worked at the new symphony theater and uh,
it was funny.

664
00:42:09.731 --> 00:42:11.860
I worked there Friday night and Thursday night,

665
00:42:11.861 --> 00:42:15.010
the first comedian ever to perform there cause it's basically designed for a

666
00:42:15.011 --> 00:42:19.090
symphony was a Kathleen Madigan.
So they had an all redhead weekend,

667
00:42:19.091 --> 00:42:21.370
which I thought was nice,
you know,

668
00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:24.640
for once they paid attention to one of the,

669
00:42:24.641 --> 00:42:27.700
a overlooked minorities out there,
you know,

670
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:34.510
how come we don't get a day on the calendar?
What about us?

671
00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:36.760
Persecuted by the Sun.

672
00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:40.270
Do you know what it's like to be persecuted from Sunup to sundown?

673
00:42:40.271 --> 00:42:44.650
I don't think you do all you fucking bitch and people from other God damn

674
00:42:44.651 --> 00:42:49.390
fucking groups.
I've had it.
Uh,

675
00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:53.680
anyways,
yeah,
down here on Miami beach and everyone is dressed like a hooker.

676
00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:57.910
You know,
this is really just a,
it's a bunch of,
I dunno,

677
00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:03.780
really good looking women who are dressed as fucking trashy as you possibly can.

678
00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.330
None of them do you look at like,
God,
I could marry that girl.

679
00:43:07.331 --> 00:43:12.040
You just look at all of them and you just start thinking about porno.
Um,

680
00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:13.920
I don't get it.
It's that,

681
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.910
and I can't just say that it's c a Miami beach area cause I've kind of seen that

682
00:43:18.911 --> 00:43:22.880
in like a number of different cities.
It's that,
that Kim Kardashians,

683
00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:27.610
Paris Hilton influence where,
I dunno,
I don't know what happened to broads,

684
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:32.560
I don't know how they went from the 1950s to early sixties which I think was the

685
00:43:32.561 --> 00:43:36.250
high point of Cla.
At least classy looking women.

686
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:39.310
God knows there was plenty of gold digging horseback then.

687
00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:40.690
But that whole era there,
man,

688
00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:44.320
the way they dressed telling you they look classy,

689
00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:48.670
your approach to them was different.
Down here it's just,
it's fucking ridiculous.

690
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.480
I'm sitting there with my lady,

691
00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:56.920
I'm trying to pay attention to her as she's talking to me and these two checks

692
00:43:56.921 --> 00:43:59.800
at the fucking next table.
Just go sit in there with a tits still.

693
00:43:59.801 --> 00:44:01.090
Like they're almost,

694
00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:05.470
they were as close to being out of her dress as humanly fucking possible,

695
00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:09.400
you know?
So that's what am I thinking?
Am I looking at her like,
oh,

696
00:44:09.401 --> 00:44:12.460
look at that beautiful,
beautiful woman.
I'm not,
I'm thinking,

697
00:44:12.461 --> 00:44:16.660
what would it be like if I just stuck my Dick Right in the cleavage as my end of

698
00:44:16.661 --> 00:44:20.080
my girl's voice just fades off in the background.
Hey Tammy.
Hey Man.

699
00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:25.810
Maybe you married.
Get a jet ski.
I can't fucking hear what she's saying.
Um,

700
00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:29.910
yeah,
it's,
uh,
I've had it.
I've had enough down here.
I am.

701
00:44:29.911 --> 00:44:34.320
I'm fucking done with it.
I'm going in the ocean.
I respect the ocean.
All right.

702
00:44:34.321 --> 00:44:37.910
There's sharks in there is Barracuda.
There's jellyfish.

703
00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:42.180
That goddamn ocean itself can just get mad at you and drag you out to fucking

704
00:44:42.181 --> 00:44:43.650
see when it feels like it.

705
00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:46.470
And then you're supposed to remain calm and just sort of,
oh,

706
00:44:46.471 --> 00:44:49.290
which way is it dragging me?
I guess I'll swim sideways.

707
00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:54.330
I think that's what I'll do.
You know?
Does the ocean just fucking attack?

708
00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.930
She pulls your bathing suit off,
you know,
you know,
if you survive,

709
00:44:57.931 --> 00:45:00.540
you going to be walking up there with the sun burned Dick.
Is that what you want?

710
00:45:00.541 --> 00:45:05.010
I just know what I want.
It's not what I'm looking for in a vacation.
All right.

711
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:06.970
<v 3>Okay.</v>

712
00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:09.790
<v 1>These fucking ladies down here,
they're ridiculous.</v>

713
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:14.170
And I've been making fun of him all week and uh,
every brought have been around.

714
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:18.310
Uh,
yeah.
I don't know that they are,
or people from Miami,
they try to defend them.

715
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:22.990
Uh,
you do,
you die.
He doesn't understand and hits Miami.
The weather.
It's just,

716
00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:26.260
we are used to walking around with,
let's shut the fuck up.

717
00:45:26.261 --> 00:45:27.790
Walking around less clothes.

718
00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:29.953
<v 3>All right.</v>

719
00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:32.501
<v 1>EMEA,
tits,</v>

720
00:45:32.501 --> 00:45:36.440
hanging out of your fucking shirt and having a shirt design to show as much of

721
00:45:36.441 --> 00:45:39.910
your teddy as humanly fucking possible at.
That's a different thing.
All right?

722
00:45:39.911 --> 00:45:42.070
That's not all my God,
it's so fucking hot out.

723
00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:43.993
<v 3>You know,</v>

724
00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:48.640
<v 1>I saw it.
Right.
You know,
it was funny.
It was late at night and one of these,</v>

725
00:45:48.641 --> 00:45:50.890
these hooker dressed women who wasn't a hooker,

726
00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:54.580
was walking by herself on the other side of the street.
And I said to the guy,

727
00:45:54.581 --> 00:45:55.810
go look at that.
Right there I go.

728
00:45:55.811 --> 00:45:58.180
That's your daughter that you daughter walking down the street.

729
00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:01.720
What are you gonna say to her?
And he just started laughing,
shaking his head.

730
00:46:01.721 --> 00:46:02.560
It's like,
exactly.

731
00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:07.580
She looks like a fucking streetwalker and now she's away from the God heard.

732
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.130
Well,
what are you gonna say to her

733
00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:16.000
fucking five inch fucking he every God damn one of them.
How much,

734
00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:20.710
how much for a fucking blow job?
Um,
yeah,
that,
that really is Miami beach.

735
00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:21.640
So if you want to come down,

736
00:46:21.641 --> 00:46:26.230
if you want to come down here and you want to bang a 10,
uh,

737
00:46:26.231 --> 00:46:30.640
I think it's almost impossible not to because if you hook up with anything down

738
00:46:30.641 --> 00:46:32.530
here,
they're absolutely fucking gorgeous.

739
00:46:32.531 --> 00:46:37.240
And they're dressed like absolute fucking hookers.
Um,

740
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.100
<v 3>yeah,</v>

741
00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:43.480
<v 1>I think I saw maybe two or three class acts the entire time I was down here.</v>

742
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:45.130
So,
um,

743
00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:51.550
it was going to be great as the amount of people who are going to fucking email

744
00:46:51.551 --> 00:46:53.380
me and they're going to try to defend,

745
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:59.500
<v 3>um,
what is going on down here.
All right.</v>

746
00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.320
<v 1>And all you females from Miami who going to defend this type of shit?</v>

747
00:47:03.321 --> 00:47:06.710
Let me ask you this.
If you save her,
if you savor not,

748
00:47:06.711 --> 00:47:10.310
you saved your fucking savior.
Jesus h Christ showed up,
okay?

749
00:47:10.311 --> 00:47:13.160
And he was at one of those after parties,
all of a sudden,
you know,

750
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:17.960
he finally comes back,
improves assholes like me,
wrong.
There he is.

751
00:47:17.961 --> 00:47:18.794
Jay Star,

752
00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:24.070
you know on the one and two with the fucking headset on,
right up there.

753
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:29.000
Fucking all of a sudden starts re remix in key bear and mom and dad.
You're

754
00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:32.820
<v 6>Christ has died for rose,</v>

755
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:33.880
<v 3>okay.</v>

756
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.870
<v 6>And has risen from the dead.</v>

757
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:43.310
<v 1>Jesus.
Um,
all right.
And he comes back.</v>

758
00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:48.200
I be aren't you?
At the very least a second.
You see you,
I know two things.

759
00:47:48.201 --> 00:47:51.080
You're going to do.
One,
you going to take off those God damn shoes.

760
00:47:51.081 --> 00:47:51.914
And number two,

761
00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:55.490
you're going to reach for you a little granny shawl to cover your tits up.

762
00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:59.510
That's what you're going gonna do.
I think that's what you're gonna do.

763
00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:04.280
And you're probably going to try and stand behind as many thick legged,

764
00:48:04.281 --> 00:48:09.120
sturdy horse as you possibly can as you text your friend o m.

765
00:48:09.121 --> 00:48:12.020
G can you please find me a pair of pants?

766
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:17.280
<v 3>Okay.</v>

767
00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.310
<v 1>What would Jesus do?
Everybody.
What would he do?</v>

768
00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.460
I'm probably going to get a ton of shit for trash and fucking Miami like dead

769
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:25.410
like I did from the potheads last week.

770
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:30.000
Some guy actually gave me shit cause I do that,
that voice.
Hey me.
And he's like,

771
00:48:30.001 --> 00:48:33.450
I've never heard anyone shut.
Even though what I'm talking about.

772
00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:37.440
Go Watch that documentary on the Fillmore.
All right.
It's a fucking,

773
00:48:37.441 --> 00:48:40.650
it's an impression of the hippies from Woodstock.

774
00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:43.170
I realized that people don't talk like that anymore.

775
00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:47.370
I'm exaggerating for comedic effect.
You fucking cunt.

776
00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:50.190
I felt when you smoked weed,
everything became funny.

777
00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.990
Why aren't you giggling right now?
Ah,
angry pothead.

778
00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:58.290
And you never answered my fucking question.
None of you did.

779
00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:01.890
How many weed smokers?
All right,

780
00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:08.310
who fucking,
I came on with my five.
My fucking question about mushrooms.

781
00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:09.540
It's trying to make some sort of point.

782
00:49:09.541 --> 00:49:13.150
Last week you guys were all afraid of it stayed away.

783
00:49:13.151 --> 00:49:16.530
You changed the subject like a bunch of fucking politicians.

784
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:21.380
When's the economy going to turn around?
Governor,
you know,

785
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:25.590
I'm not teach 70 till this tub was built.
We Out of vision.

786
00:49:25.591 --> 00:49:28.470
What the fuck are you talking about?
Answer the Goddamn question.

787
00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:34.530
Um,
anyways,
so I got to see all sides of this state.

788
00:49:34.531 --> 00:49:39.210
I saw the who was,
I saw the,
uh,
you know,
the fist pumpers,

789
00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:42.090
you know,
that really sounds fucking filthy,
doesn't it?

790
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:45.990
A little bunch of twinkle toes down here too.

791
00:49:45.991 --> 00:49:50.070
And then after I took a tour of the everglades the next day,
right?

792
00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:55.500
Finally got to do that.
Went on a fan boat.
It,
uh,
I gotta admit,

793
00:49:55.501 --> 00:49:56.790
man,
I was pretty fucking nervous.

794
00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:58.130
<v 3>Okay.</v>

795
00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:59.310
<v 1>First of all,
you know what's great is you,</v>

796
00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:04.280
you go outside of Miami and you get a half a mile out there and the drop off.

797
00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.170
It's just like the ocean,
you know,

798
00:50:06.171 --> 00:50:08.330
we just sort of weighed out and everything's great.
And what are,

799
00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.510
what do you call one of those drop offs?
We have any oceanography,

800
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:14.930
oceanographers listening,
what do you call that?

801
00:50:14.931 --> 00:50:16.520
Where all of a sudden it goes from like,
you know,

802
00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:21.850
five feet deep to like 125 feet and you just slip into that darker water and no

803
00:50:22.551 --> 00:50:25.040
one ever hears from you again,
you know?

804
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:29.220
And then one day you come crawling back up on the fucking beach.

805
00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:30.950
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

806
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:34.130
<v 1>With three quarters of your body going like,
like the end of the terminator.</v>

807
00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:34.880
The first one,

808
00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:38.720
you know when he crawls out after he sticks that little canister and his robot

809
00:50:38.721 --> 00:50:41.480
rib cage.
You remember that nick just starts crawling.

810
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:48.570
I actually watched that movie unedited.
Fucking great film stands up.

811
00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:52.600
Stands the test of time.
Um,
anyways,
what the fuck am I talking about?
Yeah.

812
00:50:52.601 --> 00:50:57.490
So I started the second you get outside the dropoff where it goes from almond,

813
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:59.480
Miami Bitch.
And um,

814
00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:04.670
for some reason still wearing those white louvered Kanye West Grammy glasses

815
00:51:05.041 --> 00:51:08.040
that he wore like five years ago.
Um,

816
00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:09.670
<v 0>okay.</v>

817
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:12.830
<v 1>Yeah.
What's funny about him?
He broke his jaw.
Now he always looks upset.</v>

818
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:20.270
He's got that bulldog mouth with his is his bottom lip sticks out a little,

819
00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:23.850
little more than the upper lip.
Um,
anyways,

820
00:51:23.851 --> 00:51:28.070
so you go out there and it just immediately becomes,

821
00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:34.850
you want your shale.
Some frog legs.
Got Myself pickup truck.

822
00:51:34.851 --> 00:51:38.060
It's the one out there with the steel balls hanging off of it.
Hey,

823
00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:39.980
like my mullet,
you're like this shit.

824
00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.370
I'm immediately went out there and all of a sudden there's like,

825
00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:44.840
there's like signs,

826
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:49.100
billboards for like Bingo Parlor and this casinos.

827
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:55.030
So we go all the way out and as we're driving they got these goddamn canals and

828
00:51:55.041 --> 00:51:59.500
uh,
this,
these,
these fucking alligators
hanging out.

829
00:51:59.501 --> 00:52:03.730
Not big ones.
Just sort of like little,
like a,
I don't know,
little five footers,

830
00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.073
but still

831
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:06.240
<v 0>okay.</v>

832
00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:09.420
<v 1>Five foot alligator man.
If that thing bitch,
you,
uh,
you know,</v>

833
00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:14.700
I'm sure you can maybe pull yourself away from the thing.
I don't know what,

834
00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:17.700
I don't know what your door are.
You one of your friends could start,

835
00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:20.650
I guess you poke them in the,
I have no idea what the fuck you dude or,

836
00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:24.810
but you're,
you're definitely losing your calf muscle or a chunk of your leg,

837
00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:25.773
you know.

838
00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:27.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

839
00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:29.900
<v 1>Broken arm.
When they start doing that God damn death role,</v>

840
00:52:29.901 --> 00:52:33.430
they just lay in there.
I Dunno,
like people down here,

841
00:52:33.431 --> 00:52:38.320
they used to him alligators and shit,
but like if someone like me,

842
00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:43.110
a Yankee from up north,
I really don't do well with reptiles.
They've,

843
00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:47.140
they,
they freak me the fuck out.
So I know I'm on my way to the everglades.

844
00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:51.940
They got all these alligators.
They have a water moccasins or cotton mouth does,

845
00:52:51.941 --> 00:52:53.150
they're called.
And I learned,
cause they,

846
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.700
they sit there with their mouths open when the,

847
00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:57.610
when they feel like they're threatened and they have all,

848
00:52:57.611 --> 00:53:00.700
it's all white inside their mouths.
It's like black Mambas.

849
00:53:01.330 --> 00:53:04.530
I always thought that snake was black.
It isn't the inside of its mouth is black.

850
00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:05.621
The outside.

851
00:53:05.621 --> 00:53:09.610
He's sort of a gray now Jesus Christ built what does his fucking animal planet.

852
00:53:09.611 --> 00:53:12.070
Can you get to the goddamn comedy a go fuck yourselves.

853
00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:16.090
I learned some things this week,
so we show up out there,
right?

854
00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:21.300
It's me and the comedian in both our fucking ladies and uh,

855
00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:25.740
took one of those fan boats.
Now I'm going to give you some advice.
All right?

856
00:53:25.741 --> 00:53:30.420
You can be a cheap fuck and go on one of those fucking a air boats,

857
00:53:30.421 --> 00:53:34.560
I guess they call them and go on there with like 10,
12,
I the fucking people.

858
00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:39.180
Or You can shell out another 20 bucks ahead and you can go on one by yourself.

859
00:53:39.181 --> 00:53:42.930
I definitely suggest that one because,
uh,
this time of year,

860
00:53:42.931 --> 00:53:46.080
the waters a little bit shallow and the other people will get bogged down with

861
00:53:46.081 --> 00:53:48.240
the weight and there's,
and we fucking blew by all of them.

862
00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:51.480
And a little disappointed.

863
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.060
I didn't get to see too many fucking alligators.

864
00:53:54.061 --> 00:53:57.750
I guess they were mating and they're shy and they're in the fucking tall grass

865
00:53:57.751 --> 00:53:59.430
or some shit.
I don't know what was going on.

866
00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:01.320
So for the first three quarters of it,

867
00:54:01.321 --> 00:54:05.040
all I'm seeing is a bunch of God damn birds.
All right.

868
00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:10.290
Those white ones with the s the s turn fucking next.
Um,

869
00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:11.590
I'm not gonna lie to here was actually,

870
00:54:11.591 --> 00:54:14.490
it was amazing and I was absolutely terrified than any second one of those

871
00:54:14.491 --> 00:54:17.850
fucking alligators was going to come up and stuff and just rip off one of my

872
00:54:17.851 --> 00:54:20.040
legs.
And,
uh,

873
00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:24.420
plus you can't believe down here the amount of misinformation on alligators.

874
00:54:24.421 --> 00:54:27.630
These people were trying to tell me that those things can run 30 miles an hour.

875
00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:32.970
They go,
they can't run 30 miles an hour for a long time.
And they also,

876
00:54:32.971 --> 00:54:36.000
they can't,
like,
they can't run like Barry Sanders.

877
00:54:36.001 --> 00:54:37.620
They could just kind of go in a straight line.

878
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:43.170
So what you do is you supposed to serpentine,
which I don't get that.
It's like,

879
00:54:43.171 --> 00:54:45.390
should you just run in a straight line and then break?
Right.

880
00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:48.090
Why would you then break left and become,

881
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:52.500
you'd end up back in his fucking scope,
wouldn't ya?

882
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:56.010
I don't know what.
So I finally go on the fucking Internet.
I'm like,

883
00:54:56.011 --> 00:55:00.540
give me a God damn break.
Those fat fucks can run that fast.
And it turns out,

884
00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:04.440
uh,
answers.com how fast can they run?

885
00:55:04.441 --> 00:55:08.520
Says alligators cannot run at 35 miles per hour is previously,

886
00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:13.890
as a previous answer said 35 miles an hour is how fast a horse runs or an

887
00:55:13.891 --> 00:55:18.250
Olympic speed skater.
Uh,
it,

888
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:22.050
they said it's faster.
It's fast at 35 miles an hour is faster than a deer.

889
00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:26.970
People tend to make outrageous claims about crocodiles with no basis.
Um,

890
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.480
just today I was a on an everglades tour in the guide,

891
00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:34.640
the guide said they could go 35 miles an hour on land set of fast alligator Mike

892
00:55:34.921 --> 00:55:37.650
go eight or nine miles per hour.

893
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.930
According to a study in Australia,

894
00:55:39.931 --> 00:55:44.550
young crocodiles might be able to reach his fast as 10.5 miles an hour,

895
00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:48.180
but only over a few yards.
And also their ambush,

896
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:52.770
they usually ambush.
People saw that,
I don't know,
they said no.

897
00:55:52.771 --> 00:55:56.750
If they fucking run,
they usually just run away.
They run it back to water.
Um,

898
00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.070
they run like fat people will,

899
00:55:59.071 --> 00:56:02.940
you run and all of a sudden you lose your footing and you just do a face plant.

900
00:56:02.941 --> 00:56:03.541
That's what they do.

901
00:56:03.541 --> 00:56:06.890
They just try to stay up and then they do a face plant right into the fucker

902
00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:09.180
water.
But once they get in the water,
you're screwed.

903
00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:13.650
So I was also thinking with all these,
God damn alligator's laying around,

904
00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:18.060
you know,
how many,
how many people get killed a year?
And evidently it,

905
00:56:18.061 --> 00:56:21.930
it's not that many.
They only have like,

906
00:56:21.931 --> 00:56:26.690
they have like four or five attacks year.
That's it.
Four or five tests a year,

907
00:56:26.691 --> 00:56:30.800
but then they had like three people died all in one fucking week or three people

908
00:56:30.801 --> 00:56:33.890
down here got attacked.
Some woman jog or some shit.

909
00:56:33.891 --> 00:56:37.580
She was jogging and she decided to fucking cool off her feet in the water and

910
00:56:37.581 --> 00:56:38.780
that was the last time they saw her.

911
00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:42.730
<v 3>Okay,</v>

912
00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:47.650
<v 1>why the fuck would you do that?
Why would you do that?</v>

913
00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:51.250
That's why like whenever I watched like a fucking one of those horror movies

914
00:56:51.251 --> 00:56:54.790
from back in the day,
that's what you're always yelling as you're watching it.

915
00:56:54.791 --> 00:56:57.790
Like what?
Why are you going in there?
Why are you doing that?
Like this.

916
00:56:57.791 --> 00:57:02.440
The same thing.
If you live in Florida,
if you feed a hot fucking tough it out.

917
00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:08.150
Go home and stick them in the tub.
Dangle them in that fucking water.

918
00:57:08.151 --> 00:57:12.540
Hugh.
Imagine that Shit.
Oh my God.

919
00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:18.350
Checking you get pulled in to this to the moment you're underwater.

920
00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.930
You have to think,
I would think.

921
00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:22.360
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

922
00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:22.541
<v 1>Well,</v>

923
00:57:22.541 --> 00:57:26.230
however long it takes the alligator to pull you from where you're seated into

924
00:57:26.231 --> 00:57:29.050
the water.
What do you think that is?
Point eight seconds.

925
00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:31.420
I would say for 0.4 seconds.

926
00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:35.170
The first point to you like what the fuck?

927
00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:40.740
Point three your holy Shit.
Point four you have hope

928
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:45.430
maybe I can do.
Maybe I can do this.
Oh,
there's my ring.

929
00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:49.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

930
00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:53.760
<v 1>There it is.
Hey Dude,
I'm doing my podcast.</v>

931
00:57:53.761 --> 00:57:58.750
Let me call you right back in about an hour,
right?
Uh,
um.

932
00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:00.280
<v 0>Okay.</v>

933
00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:03.590
<v 1>Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
bom.
That's the only normal one I can get.</v>

934
00:58:03.591 --> 00:58:07.070
You want to hear my fucking things?
I was in such a great moment there.
All right,

935
00:58:07.071 --> 00:58:11.510
so 0.4 seconds.
You have hope.
Well,
maybe I could do.
Oh no I can't.

936
00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:15.860
That's 0.5.
Then you just like,
I'm dead.
Point five to 0.8.
You're like,

937
00:58:15.861 --> 00:58:19.250
I can't believe I'm going to get,
I'm going to die via alligator.

938
00:58:19.251 --> 00:58:21.200
And then once you're under the water,
that's when you renew.

939
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:23.120
Renew your relationship with the Lord.

940
00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:24.950
And I know what you guys are probably thinking.

941
00:58:24.951 --> 00:58:27.530
You're probably thinking what bill,
because you don't believe in that shit.

942
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:29.030
What would you be thinking?

943
00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:34.070
I would be praying to God and his second got a fucking hedge my bets.

944
00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:42.080
My prayers will be hilarious.
If you do exist and you do give a fuck,

945
00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:44.930
get me out of this or make it quick.

946
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:47.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

947
00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:50.860
<v 1>Oh my God.
How long do you think it takes?</v>

948
00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:55.610
Like how long do you think before you dead?
Here's the thing,

949
00:58:55.611 --> 00:58:57.820
just sitting at Chowan on your liver and you're going like,

950
00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:59.090
<v 3>uh,</v>

951
00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:02.130
<v 1>for the love of God eat my heart's Oregon.</v>

952
00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:05.590
I so getting really fucking more of it,
but uh,
I dunno man,

953
00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:09.340
I could not get comfortable.
So we ended up going out there on the everglades.

954
00:59:09.341 --> 00:59:13.450
I definitely recommend it,
although if you're going to go,
um,

955
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:17.620
try to go April and may because the water levels come up I guess.

956
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.870
And then also the mosquitoes aren't that bad.

957
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:25.070
There's a little travel tip for you.
April or may water levels come up.

958
00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:26.810
They're mating season.
Right?

959
00:59:26.811 --> 00:59:31.400
I was just joking about them wanting to make the fucking tall grass and full of

960
00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:33.140
shit.
Um,

961
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:38.870
gold during April and may definitely get your own fucking boat.
And,
uh,

962
00:59:38.871 --> 00:59:42.830
I would also say venture out as far as you can into the everglades.

963
00:59:42.831 --> 00:59:44.900
Don't stop at the first one.
Just keep going.

964
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:50.650
Go as far as you can until you're out there with some fucking a seminal Indians,

965
00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:54.440
you know,
and they're calling you.
And then the guide says white man,

966
00:59:54.441 --> 00:59:57.830
speak with forked tongue.
I think that that's the one you want to get on.
Um,

967
00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:02.900
we actually,
we had just a couple of redneck dudes and the redneck dude we had,

968
01:00:02.901 --> 01:00:07.400
the guy's name was Regis and uh,
they had all this uh,
airboat humor,

969
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:11.910
you know,
where they would just like,
do you know if you enjoy the tour,

970
01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:16.770
get out to the left.
If he didn't get out to the wreck,
kick,
kick,
kick,
get it.

971
01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.160
Cause then you'd step in the water and the alligators are in there.

972
01:00:20.970 --> 01:00:24.960
But seriously,
folks,
don't hang your legs off the boat at any forums.
We,

973
01:00:24.961 --> 01:00:28.740
we're going through here,
uh,
those you who are wearing hats,

974
01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:32.270
I suggest you take them off or turn them off backwards.
Cause if you don't,
we,

975
01:00:32.271 --> 01:00:35.580
they leave the known to fly off.
They go into the fan.

976
01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:39.810
And then they don't fit as well.
Could kick,
kick,
kick off.
Just kidding.

977
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:44.160
Alright folks,
seriously turn your hatch.
Rab.
Um,

978
01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:49.230
if you're wondering,
no,
I am not parked shark.

979
01:00:49.650 --> 01:00:54.150
That's just my awful dentition job.
Jazz fucking with you.

980
01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:58.170
Keep the fucking hands and legs inside of the boat at all times.

981
01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:02.880
Uh,
this one an alligator's sounds like when it's trying to make,

982
01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:05.250
they did all that shit.
It was fucking tremendous.

983
01:01:05.251 --> 01:01:10.110
We saw another boat that got it.
Got um,
it was hilarious.
This boat,

984
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:14.520
one of those boats that had too many people on it.
It actually a when a ground,

985
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:18.210
so they were just sitting out in the everglades waiting to be told in.

986
01:01:18.211 --> 01:01:21.450
So we came over to see if we can help him out.
And it was hilarious.

987
01:01:21.451 --> 01:01:23.550
It was like six people all from Germany.

988
01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:27.240
So they were getting the full on redneck experience.

989
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:29.730
I would love to hear the stories that are going to tell when they get back.

990
01:01:29.731 --> 01:01:33.330
They just sitting there,
we pull up near like one tie.
Hello.

991
01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:39.270
Hi.
And they had the most redneck dude ever and he was just standing there.

992
01:01:39.271 --> 01:01:42.630
He completely given up like there's no way and get towed out.

993
01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:48.340
And so he puts his cigarette in his mouth and he's fishing for his lighter as

994
01:01:48.861 --> 01:01:52.880
he's talking to the other redneck go and he's like,
yeah,
God damn garbage.

995
01:01:52.881 --> 01:01:57.350
Can you know what they say?
Well go chrome it

996
01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:04.550
is he saying he's saying it like you're starting to look there.

997
01:02:04.551 --> 01:02:05.361
If you know what this is,

998
01:02:05.361 --> 01:02:07.490
lips together cause he wants to hold onto the cigarettes.

999
01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:11.360
So cigarettes sitting there flapping around as he's reaching for his lighter and

1000
01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:13.850
it was amazing.
It was one of those moments as a performer,

1001
01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.570
I'm watching this guy going,
this guy doesn't even realize it,

1002
01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.490
but this guy is actually,
if someone could imitate

1003
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:24.480
<v 7>him,
they would win an Oscar with what he's doing right now just sitting there,</v>

1004
01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:25.513
<v 1>no drag.</v>

1005
01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.540
Well go chrome but that cigarette flap and not tie it up,
boy,

1006
01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:32.610
fuck a rock of dark snikers honor it.

1007
01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.810
<v 7>It was just so God damn authentic.
And we,</v>

1008
01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:40.060
I was sitting there with Nia and we both immediately just look down at the

1009
01:02:40.061 --> 01:02:44.920
ground and just started cracking up.
And a not an asshole.
Why not judging them.

1010
01:02:45.310 --> 01:02:49.000
And I looked over at me at one point,
I was like,
you know what,
I was like,

1011
01:02:49.001 --> 01:02:53.290
Lemmy doesn't have shit on this guy.
I'm not saying this guy's beyond Lemmy,

1012
01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:56.620
but these two could fucking hang out.
And they would be two peas in a pod.

1013
01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:00.520
Um,
speaking of which underrated anybody see that,

1014
01:03:00.521 --> 01:03:05.050
that documentary on Lemmy from Motorhead?
Fucking tremendous.

1015
01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:08.920
Um,
I'm one of those radio motor had fans.
All I know is

1016
01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:14.100
<v 1>the ace of spades,
but uh,
definitely a fascinating guy and uh,</v>

1017
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:17.360
he and I think it's on demand this month.
Should definitely try and check it out.

1018
01:03:17.361 --> 01:03:21.080
So anyway,
so we ended up going through the fucking everglades and then the end,

1019
01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.240
I know I made fun of those fan boat guys,
but they're actually,

1020
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:24.980
they're great dudes.
Tip Him,

1021
01:03:24.981 --> 01:03:29.510
don't be a fucking asshole and a then we got off and they,
uh,

1022
01:03:29.511 --> 01:03:33.200
they gave us a baby alligator and they said that you get one of these,

1023
01:03:33.201 --> 01:03:36.650
you get one of these with every trip.
Take it sticking in water.

1024
01:03:36.651 --> 01:03:39.830
Don't tell anybody you got it.
And,
uh,
when it gets too big,

1025
01:03:39.831 --> 01:03:42.800
you just flush it down the toilet.
Now they didn't,
they actually,

1026
01:03:42.801 --> 01:03:47.660
they just let us hold one.
And uh,
it was actually pretty cool.
I kind of,

1027
01:03:47.661 --> 01:03:50.450
I was terrified to do it.
Not like terrified.

1028
01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:54.740
I just thought it was going to fucking bite my finger off.
So,
uh,

1029
01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:59.870
it was weird the dog training that,
that I,
that I got through working with Cleo.

1030
01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:01.983
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1031
01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:05.390
<v 1>I realized that when you,
at least when you go to make a move with a dog,</v>

1032
01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.910
if you're going to go pet a dog,
you don't,
you don't,

1033
01:04:07.911 --> 01:04:11.390
no pun intended alligator arms.
You don't start the Pettit and then go,
oh,

1034
01:04:11.391 --> 01:04:12.710
wait a minute if they're going to bite me,

1035
01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:17.090
because then they feel that and then that makes them feel fucked up.

1036
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.983
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1037
01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.940
<v 1>So the guy goes,
you know,
take the alligator,
grab it right here.</v>

1038
01:04:22.941 --> 01:04:26.050
And before I would even think,
I just fucking made sure I had its mouth closed,

1039
01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:30.470
held it by it's God damn tail.
And uh,

1040
01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:35.740
<v 7>I got the picture taken,
but I got to admit,
I was nervous handing it back.</v>

1041
01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.113
You know,

1042
01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:41.470
like I think I could actually hold the most poisonous snake in the world.

1043
01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:44.890
If you showed me how to do it,
I think I could grab it by the back of its head,

1044
01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:46.960
you know,
and I wouldn't get bit,

1045
01:04:46.961 --> 01:04:50.650
but when I was going to get bit was the the letting go of it.
Like I don't know,

1046
01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.760
I don't get that whole,

1047
01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:57.550
do you like fucking throw it like hold onto the tail so it can't coil up and

1048
01:04:57.551 --> 01:05:00.730
then you,
you fuck.
Why am I asking you guys like your fucking snake experts?

1049
01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.120
You know what somebody is going to be,
hey,
you guys want to hear about the,

1050
01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.930
<v 1>I definitely recommend that.
And tonight I'm actually going to go to the,
uh,</v>

1051
01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.740
actually this would be tomorrow night with the podcast.
I'm going to the,
uh,

1052
01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:16.360
the panthers are playing the Washington capitals going to get to see,
uh,

1053
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:19.870
Alex,
what is he?
The great there's,
or what they call them.

1054
01:05:21.090 --> 01:05:21.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1055
01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:22.880
<v 1>Alexander the Great,</v>

1056
01:05:22.881 --> 01:05:25.730
I'm going to get to watch him and his fucking nine goals this year.

1057
01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.800
The fuck the capital's doing.

1058
01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:29.650
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1059
01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:32.230
<v 1>You know,
can they attend?
They can.
I turn that horse loose.</v>

1060
01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.590
What's going on with those guys?
How about them broads?

1061
01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:40.270
But they went 6.06 and o on their,
their uh,

1062
01:05:40.271 --> 01:05:45.271
their road trip one another one at home and last night they stole a point from

1063
01:05:45.521 --> 01:05:46.354
the penguins.

1064
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:51.200
It's motherfuckers are seven oh one one the last eight games.

1065
01:05:51.201 --> 01:05:53.000
If you can't do the math,
that's fucking great.

1066
01:05:53.001 --> 01:05:55.580
I hope they're not peaking too early,
but all of a sudden that Yo,

1067
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:58.940
we look all right with the penguins injuries.
I Dunno.

1068
01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:03.470
Who Do you think it's going to be this year?
I think you got to go with the fly.

1069
01:06:03.471 --> 01:06:07.890
Yes.
You know they were there last year.
They came.
Oh,

1070
01:06:07.891 --> 01:06:12.060
so fuck a close.
I think the flyers or the Goddamn team to beat,

1071
01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:14.340
but for some reason the penguins with all their injuries.

1072
01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.490
The filthy fucking Pittsburgh Penguins.

1073
01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:22.200
Um,
those sons of bitches.

1074
01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.180
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1075
01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:26.580
<v 1>they seem to be playing all right too.
I don't,
it all comes down.</v>

1076
01:06:26.581 --> 01:06:28.830
Can you beat them four times since in seven games?
I don't know.

1077
01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.690
I don't fucking know.
All right.
Yeah.
You guys want to read some on?

1078
01:06:31.691 --> 01:06:35.880
Want me to read some,
uh,
angry email?
An angry email from a fuckin pothead.

1079
01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:40.230
Uh,
all right,
I got one.
Who disagrees with my view on pot?
Okay,
Bill.
Dude,

1080
01:06:40.231 --> 01:06:45.231
you have obviously never regularly hung out with any weed smokers or smoked weed

1081
01:06:45.361 --> 01:06:48.960
yourself wrong on both counts right there,
sir.

1082
01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:52.230
I hung out with some of the biggest potheads you're ever going to meet in your

1083
01:06:52.231 --> 01:06:52.650
life.

1084
01:06:52.650 --> 01:06:57.650
I'm talking about people who smoked every fucking day because they couldn't

1085
01:06:57.691 --> 01:07:01.110
deal.
Uh,
they use stuff.
They quotes like this.

1086
01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:05.430
Why do you get high at work?
Why do you,
why do you smoke all the time?
Dude,

1087
01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:09.960
I like pot because it turns my world,

1088
01:07:09.961 --> 01:07:14.580
turns my life into a movie.
That's what this buddy of mine said.

1089
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:19.790
All right,
so yes,
I have hung out with them.
He said,

1090
01:07:19.791 --> 01:07:21.740
you are usually on point with what you say,

1091
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:25.580
but you talk like someone who was absolutely zero knowledge of weed.

1092
01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:28.860
I've never seen someone with that.
I've never seen.
So this is the guy,

1093
01:07:28.861 --> 01:07:31.400
I never seen him.
Something with that tire,
cliched pot,
smoker voice.

1094
01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.730
Obviously you haven't,
all right,
but if you watch shaggy and Scooby,

1095
01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:39.240
you see it right there.
They're making fun of the whole Woodstock generation.
Um,

1096
01:07:39.250 --> 01:07:42.650
and did I mention that or I can't even remember if you watch that fucking,
uh,

1097
01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.470
there's a documentary about Bill Graham and there's,

1098
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:49.340
and he's having the last night at the Fillmore and there's an,

1099
01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:52.160
there's a musician.
If anybody can find the clip on Youtube,

1100
01:07:52.161 --> 01:07:56.180
I think they took it down.
That guy was just like,
well,
hey man,
you know,

1101
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:58.070
just like,
you know,
man,
it's like,

1102
01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:03.410
like fuck you and thanks for their memories,
man.
You know what I'm saying?
Man,

1103
01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:08.390
you got to listen to the guy.
That's the guy everybody's making fun of.
All right.

1104
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:13.160
That's what I'm doing.
I realized that people in 2011 don't talk that way,
sir.

1105
01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.540
So anyways,
he said,

1106
01:08:14.541 --> 01:08:18.760
most pot smokers are like anyone else and don't sound like they have down

1107
01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:21.650
syndrome.
As funny as you are,

1108
01:08:21.770 --> 01:08:26.770
it pains me to hear you talk about your ass when usually you have good points.

1109
01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:32.030
Please smoke a joint and shut the hell.
All right.
That part was funny.

1110
01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:36.980
Uh,
ps,
I know you're going to tell me to go fuck myself cause it's your podcast,

1111
01:08:36.981 --> 01:08:40.850
but I'm sure I'm not the only one who notices this about you.
Uh,

1112
01:08:40.851 --> 01:08:43.280
you know what I would tell you what I'm really sick of.

1113
01:08:43.281 --> 01:08:47.870
I'm really sick of overly sensitive fucking pot smokers.
You know,

1114
01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:51.620
you guys are about to self righteous is fucking Jesus freaks.
I've had it.

1115
01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:55.880
I've had it with you guys.
I've had it with your lies of how,
uh,
you know,

1116
01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:57.980
you know,
there's like there's no they drinking and driving.

1117
01:08:57.981 --> 01:09:00.890
You can get pulled over for that and there's a test and there's nothing for
weed.

1118
01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:03.800
And then pot smokers say,
well you know what?

1119
01:09:03.801 --> 01:09:06.500
I actually think you drive better when you're high.

1120
01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:11.650
<v 7>You know,
everything's so fucking clear.
They say dumb shit like that.</v>

1121
01:09:11.651 --> 01:09:16.090
They say smoking weed is not addicting.
I just do it cause I like it.

1122
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:20.240
You're all fucking full of shit.
All right.

1123
01:09:20.241 --> 01:09:23.150
I think weed is one of the more dangerous drugs is because everybody thinks it

1124
01:09:23.151 --> 01:09:27.870
isn't fucking dangerous.
And I think the danger of that drug is that it,

1125
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:32.090
I don't know.
It just makes you want to sit on the goddamn couch.
All right,

1126
01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.810
now kind.
Of course someone's going to send me an email.

1127
01:09:33.811 --> 01:09:38.060
I smoke weed every fucking day and I'm a fucking the Valedictorian of my class.

1128
01:09:38.061 --> 01:09:40.610
Really?
Well,
you're a fucking exception.
All right.

1129
01:09:40.611 --> 01:09:44.450
You are doing damage to your brain.
You are fucking burning up your brain cells.

1130
01:09:44.451 --> 01:09:45.980
Why can't weed smoke as admit that?

1131
01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:49.790
Is it because it's illegal and you want to make it legal that you can't be

1132
01:09:49.791 --> 01:09:51.800
honest the way a drunk like I am,

1133
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:56.750
that alcohol fucking turns your nose into fucking,
you look like WC fields.

1134
01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:00.230
It fucks up your liver.
It kills brain cells.

1135
01:10:00.231 --> 01:10:03.110
You get behind the wheel of a car and you could kill yourself or even worse,

1136
01:10:03.111 --> 01:10:06.470
kill somebody else.
Why can't you guys admit that ship?

1137
01:10:08.690 --> 01:10:12.410
Ha Ha man.
Why can't you say that man?

1138
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:15.050
I'm just fucking with you by the way.
You know what?
I can't.
I can't actually,

1139
01:10:15.051 --> 01:10:15.740
you can't say I'll,

1140
01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:18.050
I'll weed smokers like that cause I only got one fucking email.

1141
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:22.730
Somebody really disagreeing with me on my views on weed.

1142
01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.033
Um,

1143
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.930
<v 0>okay.</v>

1144
01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:29.500
<v 1>I Dunno.
I don't fucking know.
You know my one thing I will,
I will,</v>

1145
01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:34.180
I will stand by this cause I am just fucking around.
I do know this.
All right.

1146
01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:38.710
You can come home after work and have a beer,
possibly two beers,

1147
01:10:38.711 --> 01:10:43.300
depending on your tolerance and yet maybe you're a little buzzed.

1148
01:10:43.810 --> 01:10:48.370
That's it.
These mother fuckers who come home and get,
they get high.

1149
01:10:48.371 --> 01:10:53.020
You get high.
You basically do the same as me drinking like six beers.

1150
01:10:53.021 --> 01:10:57.280
It'd be like me getting drunk every night.
If I drank six beers every night,

1151
01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:01.000
my girl would be talking to me going,
I think you need to go to some meetings,

1152
01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:04.630
but there's really no meetings for people who smoke weed.

1153
01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:09.700
Basically every fuck if he,
if you're getting high for fucking nights a week,

1154
01:11:09.850 --> 01:11:11.110
think about this shit.
All right?

1155
01:11:11.111 --> 01:11:15.150
You multiply that times 52 fucking weeks not to freak you out,
man.

1156
01:11:15.330 --> 01:11:19.260
This is fucking 208 days of the year.
You're fucking high.

1157
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.970
If I'm getting drunk,
torn eight times a year,

1158
01:11:22.971 --> 01:11:26.420
what's the F was I at one point I think I was,
that's what I finally,

1159
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:29.810
I started doing the fucking math and I was like,

1160
01:11:29.811 --> 01:11:34.580
I am very quietly kind of a fucking alcoholic here.
If you,

1161
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:36.560
if you get drunk two times a week,
a year,

1162
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:38.810
I'm really sounded like a fucking cunt right now,
but I'm just,

1163
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:43.220
this is just shit I worked out.
If you get drunk two times a week,
Friday,

1164
01:11:43.221 --> 01:11:47.090
Saturday night,
that's over a hundred days a year.

1165
01:11:47.091 --> 01:11:51.590
That's basically a third of the year your shit faced and that's only two times a

1166
01:11:51.591 --> 01:11:53.060
fucking week.
Eight days a month.

1167
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:56.420
You don't think you throw in the random Monday night football.

1168
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:59.000
I would like another Pale Ale,
you know?

1169
01:11:59.001 --> 01:12:02.900
Next thing you know you had three or four walk out of the house.

1170
01:12:02.901 --> 01:12:06.650
You fucking feel like you're floating in your loafers,
right?

1171
01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:11.360
You get out there and your Toyota Camry,
you didn't hit anybody.
You go home,

1172
01:12:11.361 --> 01:12:14.480
you wake up the next day,
you feel like shit.
Right?
How many times you do that?

1173
01:12:14.481 --> 01:12:18.980
A year at least 20 right?
There's a 30 year your shit faced.

1174
01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:25.540
So pot smokers on the other hand,
I,
you know,
they,

1175
01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:26.570
they got a whole different thing.

1176
01:12:26.571 --> 01:12:30.380
Like if I fucking walked by a guy in a car and he's got a beer,

1177
01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.070
I can't just come up to the window.
Amen.
Let me get,

1178
01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:36.470
let me get a couple of Poles off of that.
Just shotgun.
One of his bears.

1179
01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:41.870
Thanks Ben.
Thanks for getting me drunk.
Like pot smokers,

1180
01:12:41.871 --> 01:12:43.880
they do that shit all the time.
Maybe because it's illegal.

1181
01:12:43.881 --> 01:12:47.270
I don't know what it is,
but they get fucking baked,

1182
01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:51.470
which is the equivalent I think I have in like,
you know,
four,
five,
six beers.

1183
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:55.610
What I'm saying is,
is you pot smokers,

1184
01:12:55.611 --> 01:12:57.380
you're a lot more fucked up than you realize.

1185
01:12:57.950 --> 01:13:01.010
So you get off your God damn high horses or is it,

1186
01:13:01.011 --> 01:13:02.150
you're not even on high horses.

1187
01:13:02.151 --> 01:13:04.580
You just trying to tone down the effects of that shit.

1188
01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:06.350
Isn't that what you're doing?

1189
01:13:06.351 --> 01:13:11.090
So they'll make it legal so you can just smoke it and not worry about it and not

1190
01:13:11.091 --> 01:13:13.610
dimension how toxic fucking weed is.
Now.

1191
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.170
I remember when I was living in New York,
this dude came up to me,
he's like,
Yo,

1192
01:13:18.171 --> 01:13:21.980
I smoke this shit last night is called were tardy cause Yo,

1193
01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:25.430
you'd be smoking that Shit,
Yo,
you just be retarded.

1194
01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:29.540
You'd just be sitting there.
You'd just be sitting there like this,
Yo.

1195
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:31.790
And he makes his fucking face.

1196
01:13:31.791 --> 01:13:36.790
Like he doesn't have a thought in his goddamn head.
All right.
All that shit.

1197
01:13:36.791 --> 01:13:40.990
Chronic,
all of that shit that just fucking burns your Goddam head up.

1198
01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:45.520
I Dunno it.
Ah,
you know,
fuck you know something.
Go fuck yourselves.

1199
01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:47.800
If I can sit here and admit how bad whiskey is,

1200
01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:51.880
and then I was sitting there like Judy Garland for a quarter of the year,

1201
01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:00.220
you know what I mean?
I'm not saying you should quit.

1202
01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.540
I'm not saying that you shouldn't,
did you,

1203
01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:04.420
you know you shouldn't smoke more of it.

1204
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:09.630
I'm just saying stop acting like you're taking fucking a Flintstone vitamins,

1205
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:15.190
you know?
Because if you really wanted to,
rather than smoking it,

1206
01:14:15.191 --> 01:14:17.860
you could turn it into a hoodie.
Okay.
All right.

1207
01:14:18.010 --> 01:14:20.710
The fucking declaration of independence,
isn't that what they said?

1208
01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.810
Isn't that one of the theories out there.

1209
01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:29.030
Declaration of independence is written on hemp paper,
man.
Um,
anyway,

1210
01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:31.390
so someone who agrees with my views on pot,
I can I,

1211
01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:34.150
the amount of listeners I'm going to fucking probably lose this week.

1212
01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:40.990
I'm agrees with your view on pot.
Here we go.
Hey bill this morning.

1213
01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:42.790
Uh,
okay.
Hey bill,

1214
01:14:42.791 --> 01:14:46.240
this has been bothering me for a little while now and I'm not sure what to do.

1215
01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:51.460
I'm 19 years old.
I go to Umass Amhurst go minutemen.

1216
01:14:51.490 --> 01:14:54.100
Um,
I had a,
that's one of the worst fucking names.

1217
01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:58.070
You know something minute men used to be like the fighters because they could be

1218
01:14:58.071 --> 01:14:59.150
ready in a minute,
right?

1219
01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.610
The minute man and Nicole fight the real love revolution.

1220
01:15:01.611 --> 01:15:05.350
And then somewhere along the line I believe hip hop and R and B turned minute

1221
01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:09.650
men into people who prematurely ejaculate.

1222
01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:11.930
Do you like how my sentence slowed down there?

1223
01:15:11.931 --> 01:15:15.880
Cause there was too many words with big syllables.
Uh,

1224
01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:18.170
not just been hitting it hard down here.
Sorry.

1225
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:21.920
I had a girlfriend my first semester of college and was still in high school

1226
01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:26.990
when I was still in high school.
There Ya go.
Oh,
she was still in high school.

1227
01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:31.460
Oh wait a minute.
Sorry.
Ah,
now it's getting a little creepy.
Was she a senior?

1228
01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:32.773
Um,

1229
01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:38.300
we both knew that I would be going far away and we agreed we would stay
together.

1230
01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:41.420
However,
I guess her feelings changed and she wanted to be single.

1231
01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:45.770
I was devastated when she broke up with me and I've been really down because she

1232
01:15:45.771 --> 01:15:48.890
was the first girlfriend that I really liked.
Didn't I read this last week?

1233
01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:52.790
I think this happens to a lot of guys and I wasn't just trying to get laid.

1234
01:15:52.791 --> 01:15:53.630
I really liked this girl.

1235
01:15:53.631 --> 01:15:56.360
So after a few weeks I found out she was hooking up with this kid that I

1236
01:15:56.361 --> 01:15:57.620
consider to be a friend.

1237
01:15:58.760 --> 01:15:59.480
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1238
01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:01.460
<v 1>This is the exact same as last week.
I swear to God.</v>

1239
01:16:01.461 --> 01:16:03.700
This is different email though.
Uh,

1240
01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:06.080
because we've been hanging out over the summer and partying together.

1241
01:16:06.081 --> 01:16:08.990
What's fucked up about the whole situation is that this isn't the first,
Oh,

1242
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.490
I read this last week,
did night.

1243
01:16:10.491 --> 01:16:12.440
This isn't the first time this guy has done this to me.

1244
01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:13.760
And at the end of my senior year,

1245
01:16:13.761 --> 01:16:17.630
I broke up with a different girl and this kid was hooking up with her about a

1246
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:18.860
month later.
Then I answered this one.

1247
01:16:20.290 --> 01:16:20.940
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1248
01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:22.440
<v 1>I let that one slide again.</v>

1249
01:16:22.441 --> 01:16:26.390
I didn't really give a fuck about any of his girlfriends.
Yeah,
dude,
blah,
blah,

1250
01:16:26.391 --> 01:16:29.040
blah,
blah,
blah.
So it was question is,

1251
01:16:29.041 --> 01:16:33.180
should I go back to this kid and tell him to stop going after my ex girlfriends?

1252
01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:37.950
Uh,
yeah.
Yeah.
You should.
You should.
I mean,
who gives a fuck?

1253
01:16:37.951 --> 01:16:40.350
He's going after you're sloppy seconds.
Just ask them that.

1254
01:16:40.351 --> 01:16:42.880
I thought I said this last week.
Just call them up and be like,
listen to you.

1255
01:16:42.881 --> 01:16:45.900
Do you have an ability to get laid without fucking something that my Dick's

1256
01:16:45.901 --> 01:16:50.100
already been in?
All right.
Do I have to be your Dick Lewis and Clark?

1257
01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:51.450
The fuck is wrong with you.

1258
01:16:51.810 --> 01:16:55.770
Why don't you go forge some of your own stopped being Colby Bryan and be Michael

1259
01:16:55.770 --> 01:16:59.040
Jordan stopped doing the shit that I already did and taking credit for it.

1260
01:16:59.070 --> 01:17:01.950
You fucking cunt.
Fuck you.

1261
01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:05.490
And that fucking whore that you're with right now.
Okay.

1262
01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:09.530
Do you realize that this keeps up?
Someday I'll be able to say,
Hey,

1263
01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:13.910
I fucked your wife right before you fell in love with her.
She loved it.

1264
01:17:13.911 --> 01:17:18.050
And the Aa ash,
um,
just say some mean shit like that.
All right.

1265
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:20.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1266
01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:24.560
<v 1>How the fuck was that?
Agrees with me on pot.
I am an idiot.
All right.
Advice.</v>

1267
01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:25.750
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1268
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:26.080
<v 1>Bill,</v>

1269
01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:31.000
this is my tale of woe and in the interest of preserving the flow of the story,

1270
01:17:31.001 --> 01:17:32.350
I'm using names.

1271
01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:38.080
So I started at a Lexus dealership back in August a little bit after that.

1272
01:17:38.081 --> 01:17:41.140
A girl,
I don't give a fuck if you,
you know something.
I don't name names,

1273
01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.750
but if you guys are going to put names in your fucking thing,

1274
01:17:43.751 --> 01:17:44.890
I'm not going to say last names,

1275
01:17:44.891 --> 01:17:49.090
but I'm just going to name the names because my reading out loud skills are so

1276
01:17:49.091 --> 01:17:52.870
fucking bad.
I don't,
I don't have time to add other shit here.
All right.

1277
01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:54.100
So anyways,
so bill,

1278
01:17:54.101 --> 01:17:57.400
I started working at a Lexus dealership back in August a little bit after that.

1279
01:17:57.401 --> 01:18:01.960
A girl named Ashley started in the Accounting Department.
She was a cutie.

1280
01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:04.090
Uh,
for a few weeks.

1281
01:18:04.091 --> 01:18:07.840
I kept getting shit from the guys in the parts department for not going after

1282
01:18:07.841 --> 01:18:09.790
her.
That's hilarious.

1283
01:18:09.970 --> 01:18:13.750
What are they all married or the older perverts a look at a man who you're not

1284
01:18:13.751 --> 01:18:18.040
sticking your fucking Dick in.
I go over there.
What do you will fucking fig.

1285
01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:23.740
Um,
so they're giving me shit for not going after,
but uh,
but I had a good reason.

1286
01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:27.850
She was 20 years old.
I'm 23.
So it's not overly creepy,
dude.

1287
01:18:27.851 --> 01:18:29.710
That's not even close to being creepy.

1288
01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:32.890
That's good that you have a conscious about that.
But think about that.

1289
01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:35.380
Someday when you're fucking 47,

1290
01:18:35.381 --> 01:18:39.160
she's going to be 44 and she's going to be up your ass telling you were and

1291
01:18:39.161 --> 01:18:41.080
where you can't wear your shoes in the house.

1292
01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.970
So why don't you bang her at the height of her fucking good.
Looks.
All right.

1293
01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:48.670
Get that thought right out of your head.
That's my first piece of advice.

1294
01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:50.590
All right,
let's continue.
Uh,
right from the start,

1295
01:18:50.591 --> 01:18:54.460
I knew she was going to be the kind of girl that could only communicate through

1296
01:18:54.461 --> 01:18:59.461
her thumps text messaging a and B to a mature to handle any actual conversation,

1297
01:18:59.951 --> 01:19:04.540
not to sound self righteous.
Uh,
but going after against my better judgment,

1298
01:19:04.541 --> 01:19:06.220
I followed my Dick's advices.
Started,

1299
01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:09.340
started to get something going after a few weeks of US chatting.

1300
01:19:09.341 --> 01:19:13.270
Every once in a while I told her,
I told her I needed a massage.

1301
01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:18.270
Ah,
okay.
Dude,
that's a really creepy way to try to get her in the boat,

1302
01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:23.190
so to speak.
I need a massage.
All right,

1303
01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:25.830
well we'll deal with your opening lines later on in this.
All right.

1304
01:19:25.831 --> 01:19:29.430
But just put a little fucking,
uh,
little,
little check next to that to that.

1305
01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:34.170
That's not a,
that's a creepy way to fucking enter the atmosphere there.

1306
01:19:34.190 --> 01:19:38.070
All right.
Um,
anyways,
like a champ.
She tried her best to obliged,

1307
01:19:38.170 --> 01:19:41.640
but shit kept popping up when she walked by again.

1308
01:19:41.641 --> 01:19:46.470
I jokingly handed her my number telling her to call me and we'll schedule that

1309
01:19:46.471 --> 01:19:49.680
massage.
That's just creepy.

1310
01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:53.130
Massage is creepy.
That's,

1311
01:19:53.190 --> 01:19:58.050
that's a creepy word because creeps go to massage parlors and they have people

1312
01:19:58.051 --> 01:20:00.630
fucking do things to them.
That is fucking creepy.

1313
01:20:01.290 --> 01:20:04.950
And also a lot of perverts kind of go with the massage thing.
You're young,

1314
01:20:04.951 --> 01:20:06.390
you're 23.
I get it.

1315
01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:11.420
I had game at 23 beyond zero subzero freezing temperatures.

1316
01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:16.350
I was horrific with women at 23.

1317
01:20:16.351 --> 01:20:18.840
So the fact that you're even giving a girl a number,
I right.

1318
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:21.960
You're way beyond where the fuck I was.
Act.
I'm not talking down to you,

1319
01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:25.440
but she got to get the word massage Outta your fucking game.

1320
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:30.060
It's just a creepy fucking word.
And it,
it creeps women out.
Um,
anyways,

1321
01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:34.050
the day after I wake up with a t that,
um,
after I gave the text message,
whatever,

1322
01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:36.630
I give him my number,
the day after I wake up,
I have a text message says,
hey,

1323
01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:41.400
it's Ashley.
I can't help it.
So he said,
so I can't help but think.
Gotcha bitch.

1324
01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:44.520
That's nice.
So,
ah,
so after a week of texts we get together.

1325
01:20:44.521 --> 01:20:47.850
She finally calls me in pretty much in fights herself over to my house.

1326
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:52.110
She comes over all gussied up,
perfect outfit,
perfect makeup,

1327
01:20:52.111 --> 01:20:54.960
the whole fucking package.
Uh,

1328
01:20:54.961 --> 01:20:58.660
we watched some TV and she comes up with the idea of bringing booze into the x

1329
01:20:58.661 --> 01:21:02.580
situation.
Very nice.
I agree.
After a few hours of,
so she finally says,

1330
01:21:02.581 --> 01:21:05.850
I got to go.
She gets up to leave.

1331
01:21:06.090 --> 01:21:09.360
She tries to give me a high five as the goodbye.

1332
01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:13.950
So I come back with a more of a kiss.
Good night kind of guy.

1333
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:19.830
Jesus Christ,
Dude.
All she does is laugh and start walking to her car.

1334
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:23.910
I got mind fucked.
All right.
First of all,
dude,
um,

1335
01:21:24.930 --> 01:21:29.460
you were there for two hours and you were drinking and she's over there at some

1336
01:21:29.461 --> 01:21:33.120
point.
There's a moment where you got to make a move.

1337
01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:35.010
If you don't make a move,

1338
01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:38.550
then it gets weird and then they just shut down and say,
okay,

1339
01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:43.500
this guy is an interested.
So then she's going to leave.
Then she says,
hey,

1340
01:21:44.130 --> 01:21:45.030
good stuff.

1341
01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:50.310
Because the I five year and then all of a sudden you try to make it intimate in

1342
01:21:50.311 --> 01:21:51.420
the last five seconds,

1343
01:21:51.421 --> 01:21:53.430
you're going to be there and you come with a more of a kiss.

1344
01:21:53.431 --> 01:21:56.700
Good night kind of guy.
That's just creepy,
dude.
You're creeping them out.

1345
01:21:57.630 --> 01:22:01.910
All right,
but I get it.
All right.
I was creeping them.
I wasn't,

1346
01:22:01.911 --> 01:22:04.920
I wasn't even in the game to creep them out at that point and I went through my

1347
01:22:04.921 --> 01:22:08.340
phase where I was creeping them out.
I said dumb shit like that before too.

1348
01:22:08.341 --> 01:22:12.720
So don't feel embarrassed or anything.
Okay.
You're just,
you're coming with a,

1349
01:22:12.721 --> 01:22:16.080
you know,
it's like you're writing your first five minutes of comedy here.

1350
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:18.900
You know this.
None of this shit.

1351
01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:21.360
This is going to be embarrassing when you get older.
All right,
here we go.

1352
01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:23.970
This continuous,
after another week or so,

1353
01:22:23.971 --> 01:22:27.720
she calls me up again and invites himself over.
Very nice.
She comes over again.

1354
01:22:27.721 --> 01:22:31.890
All gussied up.
We pop in waiting.
I don't even know what that is.
That's a movie.

1355
01:22:31.891 --> 01:22:34.110
Okay.
And she gets the booze.

1356
01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:38.850
A few minutes go by and she asks if I want the massage.
Very nice.

1357
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:41.820
He said,
I never got on my stomach's so quickly.
She straddles me.

1358
01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:43.890
It tells me to take my shirt off.

1359
01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:49.100
I get a good 30 minutes in and I asked if I'm doing her next dude.

1360
01:22:50.521 --> 01:22:53.610
Your lines that it's like blunt force trauma.

1361
01:22:53.670 --> 01:22:56.120
You just punching this girl right between her tits with you,

1362
01:22:56.121 --> 01:22:59.610
with the alliance here.
Um,
anyway,
she says,

1363
01:22:59.611 --> 01:23:04.611
she tells me she doesn't know a swipe Telogis lay down while telling her I can't

1364
01:23:05.561 --> 01:23:06.580
work with shirts.

1365
01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:14.380
Jesus Christ.
Dude,

1366
01:23:15.450 --> 01:23:18.460
you can you try to finesse it a little bit?

1367
01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:24.070
I don't do I fives.
I'm more about the kiss.
Get your tongue out this weighty.
No,

1368
01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.620
you ain't leaving the house.
You lean it against the fucking door.

1369
01:23:26.621 --> 01:23:30.640
When you said that.
Um,
Jesus Christ.

1370
01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:35.260
Okay.
I say I'm not good with shirts.
Where the hell am I?
Sheets.

1371
01:23:35.261 --> 01:23:40.210
So she takes his shirt off and let me guess as she took her shirt off.

1372
01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:43.930
You didn't say anything,
you weren't touching her or anything.
You just sat there.

1373
01:23:43.931 --> 01:23:48.040
So it could be as awkward as humanly possible as you heard the sound of her

1374
01:23:48.041 --> 01:23:50.760
taking her shirt off.
Um,

1375
01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:54.470
is if she's just gotten arrested for drugs or something.
Uh,

1376
01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:58.990
she takes his shirt off and leaves on her Bra.
Of course she does.
But uh,

1377
01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:02.290
that quickly gets out of the picture.
Very nice.
It's fucking guys.
Oh,

1378
01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:05.230
cause she's 20.
I get it.
So her mind's saying no,

1379
01:24:05.231 --> 01:24:07.300
but she's too embarrassed if she continues.
All right.

1380
01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:11.020
After a while she says she has to go.
But I told her,
um,

1381
01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:16.090
she could just sleep here.
She agreed.
So thinking I was going to get laid.

1382
01:24:16.091 --> 01:24:21.091
I went and I took a piss and got back to my room to find her fully clothed with

1383
01:24:22.361 --> 01:24:26.830
her fucking coat on in my bed.
I couldn't stop thinking,

1384
01:24:26.831 --> 01:24:30.550
what the fuck he goes.
I slept pretty good though.
All right.

1385
01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:34.940
For all you rookies out there,
uh,

1386
01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:38.950
there's a lot of guilt that young women have when they're,

1387
01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:41.020
when they're going to hook up or whatever that they're doing.

1388
01:24:41.021 --> 01:24:43.960
They got a lot of voices in their hand and by my being of heart and that type of

1389
01:24:43.961 --> 01:24:48.850
thing.
So the thing is you got to keep the fucking plates spinning.
All right?

1390
01:24:49.690 --> 01:24:53.380
You can't leave them alone if you leave him alone for any period of time.

1391
01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:56.320
That gives them a chance to entertain that voice that's saying,

1392
01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:59.590
why am I doing this?
Do I want to do this?
I work with this guy.

1393
01:24:59.591 --> 01:25:04.450
We're not even going out.
You gave her time to basically do the right thing.

1394
01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:09.820
Um,
I dunno.
So yeah,
so yeah,

1395
01:25:09.821 --> 01:25:14.180
of course you come back,
she's fully fucking clothes.
It's like a,
and I don't,

1396
01:25:14.181 --> 01:25:16.120
I don't know.
Using analogies now.
I'm all set.

1397
01:25:16.121 --> 01:25:18.870
I'm feeling like a creep now cause I'm trying to teach you how to fucking banged

1398
01:25:18.871 --> 01:25:21.550
a girl like this.
This whole fucking emails just really creepy,

1399
01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:24.940
but I'm halfway through it.
I can't stop now people.
All right,
let's go.

1400
01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:28.780
He says now for the good part,
uh,
December rolled around.
Okay,

1401
01:25:28.810 --> 01:25:32.170
well you've really never give.
Told me when this started.
Oh,
he said August.

1402
01:25:32.171 --> 01:25:33.520
That's right.
My fault.
My fault.
All right.

1403
01:25:33.521 --> 01:25:37.930
December rolled around and there was a company Christmas party,
oh Jesus.

1404
01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.890
At my boss's house,
which we both attended,
me and a buddy,

1405
01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:47.230
I'm not saying his name went and she immediately finds and latches on to me

1406
01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:52.260
after a few hours and her friends giving her a fuck load of booze to,

1407
01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:53.680
to suck on.

1408
01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:57.820
She comes up to me and asked if I want to get out of there while biting her

1409
01:25:57.821 --> 01:26:01.750
lower lip and other gestures to that drive me crazy.
I agree.

1410
01:26:02.170 --> 01:26:05.600
Then she goes out her way to invite this,
this other dude along,

1411
01:26:06.230 --> 01:26:11.230
which leads us to believe that this going to be some sort of double penetration

1412
01:26:11.331 --> 01:26:14.180
action.
Jesus Christ.

1413
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:16.430
Now she's bringing this other guy

1414
01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:23.240
to fuck the whole thing up.
That's going to be like the chaperone.
So anyways,

1415
01:26:23.241 --> 01:26:27.740
we choose do this is,
this is how,
how uh,
you know,

1416
01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:31.010
the next day the phone call,
this is how all this shit goes.

1417
01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:33.320
Cause men and women just do not think the fucking same way,

1418
01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:38.090
especially at this God damn age completely not understanding what's going on

1419
01:26:38.091 --> 01:26:40.190
here.
Anyway,
so he said,
we choose my place for the,

1420
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:43.910
for the alcohol and head out while we're walking out to the car.

1421
01:26:43.911 --> 01:26:45.800
She has her hands all over me.

1422
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:48.830
So I'm thinking this shit is going down to this girl.

1423
01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.290
Like she's a Dick Tease man.
Jesus Christ.

1424
01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:55.430
We get to my place and we crack open some bear and she blatantly asked me to put

1425
01:26:55.431 --> 01:26:57.200
some porn on to watch.

1426
01:26:58.250 --> 01:27:02.230
Isn't this what happened to like the fucking Duke Lacrosse team?
Um,

1427
01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:04.790
at this point I think it's,
it's fucking over with.

1428
01:27:04.791 --> 01:27:09.260
I start getting all touchy feely with her and she seems a little annoyed.

1429
01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:13.310
Finally she starts to wrestle with me and I go in to kiss her and she dodges me

1430
01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:16.910
thinking she was playing.
I continued my advances.

1431
01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:19.160
Now there's a lot of women getting upset here.

1432
01:27:19.161 --> 01:27:21.960
You can't get fucking upset when she's doing that shit.
You want to come out?

1433
01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:26.240
Yeah,
we just hang out a little bite of the bottom lip.
Let's put a point on.

1434
01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:30.950
Um,
I continue my advances and then she gets genuinely offended.

1435
01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:34.220
Me being a little angry.
I asked the other dude to leave.

1436
01:27:34.221 --> 01:27:37.140
So we can have a little chat and I proceed to ask her what the fuck PR,

1437
01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:39.830
what the fuck she's looking for here?

1438
01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:42.920
She tells me nothing and that she doesn't have any interest in me.

1439
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:44.480
Fucking furious.

1440
01:27:44.481 --> 01:27:49.160
I just start playing a video game and drink Jamenson while she continues to ask

1441
01:27:49.161 --> 01:27:53.990
me what's wrong,
I'd never been so close to punching a girl.
In closing,

1442
01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:57.950
I started sending her incredibly asshole ish text messages.
Ah Dude,

1443
01:27:57.951 --> 01:28:01.910
why would you do that?
To self destruct?
Any chances of her talking to me again,

1444
01:28:02.150 --> 01:28:06.770
but I still left.
It still left a very conti taste in my mouth.

1445
01:28:06.771 --> 01:28:11.240
I'd love to hear your take on this.
All right dude.
All right.
Yeah,

1446
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:15.740
she's addicted.
He's all right.
And um,

1447
01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.080
I,
I don't know if she's got it.

1448
01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:21.780
<v 7>Fear of being alone.
She's using you,
she's using you for company.</v>

1449
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:24.330
She's probably doesn't now,
obviously it doesn't have a boyfriend,

1450
01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:27.300
so she needs to get rid of her little fucking sexual acts.

1451
01:28:27.301 --> 01:28:30.270
So she kind of takes it up to the point and then backs off from it.

1452
01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:34.080
But the problem is with the girl like that,
that first night she came over there,

1453
01:28:34.170 --> 01:28:38.100
you had the close the deal and when you didn't close the fucking deal,
that's it.

1454
01:28:38.101 --> 01:28:42.300
You got to fucking walk away and once you realize the girl is mind fucking you

1455
01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:46.350
basically being a dick tease,
you have to.
Two things you have to do.

1456
01:28:46.351 --> 01:28:49.410
You got to walk away and two,
you can't get mad.

1457
01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:52.140
You have to accept that that's part of the fucking game,

1458
01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:55.470
but for some reason you really want to still bang this girl.

1459
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:56.700
You have to realize that.

1460
01:28:56.701 --> 01:29:00.390
Then what you have to do is you have to start playing mind games back with her,

1461
01:29:00.391 --> 01:29:02.760
which personally gets fucking exhausting.

1462
01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:03.670
<v 0>Okay?</v>

1463
01:29:03.670 --> 01:29:05.530
<v 7>But if you want to do that in the future,</v>

1464
01:29:05.531 --> 01:29:08.530
what you then do is the next day when you go to work,
this is provided.

1465
01:29:08.531 --> 01:29:12.610
You didn't get upset is when you see her,
you don't ignore her,

1466
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.590
<v 0>okay?</v>

1467
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:17.490
<v 7>You're not snide door.
You're not angry to her.
What you do is you're like,
hey,</v>

1468
01:29:17.491 --> 01:29:20.700
how are you doing?
A big smile if it's acceptable,
a hug at work,

1469
01:29:20.701 --> 01:29:24.870
if you can do that or whatever,
you just be cool with her.
All right?

1470
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:27.090
But you don't try to go out with her or anything.

1471
01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:30.990
And then later on that day or whenever the opportunity arises,

1472
01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:35.920
you compliment some other female within earshot of her.
All right.

1473
01:29:36.710 --> 01:29:37.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1474
01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:41.070
<v 7>That will cause a dick tease to be like,
wait a minute,
Wa wa Wa</v>

1475
01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:45.520
fucking start coming your way.
And that's how you,

1476
01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:48.600
that's how you get them on the boat.
You gotta you gotta just turn what you get.

1477
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:52.180
It's weird.
You got to walk backwards.
You know what it is?
It's like,

1478
01:29:52.181 --> 01:29:56.860
like charged magnets.
You know what I'm saying?
If you fucking,

1479
01:29:56.861 --> 01:30:00.820
uh,
you take a fucking,
I don't know what the fuck it is.
What am I trying to say?

1480
01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.580
I don't try to say,
it's like you take a step towards it.

1481
01:30:03.581 --> 01:30:06.010
If fucking goes off the other direction,
if you walk away,

1482
01:30:06.011 --> 01:30:08.740
it starts coming towards you and you just got to slowly,

1483
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:15.160
slowly back them into the boat.
But I dunno,

1484
01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:15.701
I dunno.

1485
01:30:15.701 --> 01:30:18.610
I Dunno what to tell you as far as your fucking opening lines of what you really

1486
01:30:18.611 --> 01:30:22.330
have to do,
dude,
is when you just want to fuck a girl,
you have to say,

1487
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:24.250
you got to present that to them,

1488
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:27.370
<v 3>you know?
Um,</v>

1489
01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:31.080
<v 7>and the only way you got,
you got to do it through bombing.
Okay.
You're,
you're,</v>

1490
01:30:31.081 --> 01:30:36.040
you're blunt force trauma
period.
I,
I dunno,

1491
01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:39.830
I,
it's,
it's impossible.
It's,
it's a,
it's like how do I learn how to do standup,

1492
01:30:39.831 --> 01:30:41.540
the right five minutes of jokes and you have to go up there.

1493
01:30:41.541 --> 01:30:43.490
That's all the only advice I can give you.
And you've got to go up there.

1494
01:30:43.491 --> 01:30:45.410
You've got to fucking figure it out for yourself.
But like,

1495
01:30:45.411 --> 01:30:47.930
eventually you have to just,

1496
01:30:49.330 --> 01:30:53.380
if you just want to bang a girl,
you can't,
uh,
does he,
you have the,

1497
01:30:53.410 --> 01:30:57.190
you have the right instincts.
You're steering the conversation towards sex,

1498
01:30:57.550 --> 01:30:59.950
but you're doing it at 90 miles an hour.

1499
01:31:00.010 --> 01:31:03.970
You grabbing her by the back of the head and slamming her face into the wall.

1500
01:31:04.210 --> 01:31:05.043
You can't do that.

1501
01:31:05.610 --> 01:31:06.443
<v 3>Uh,</v>

1502
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:10.670
<v 7>you know,
I don't know.
I don't know where,
where,
where to begin.</v>

1503
01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:12.010
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1504
01:31:12.010 --> 01:31:15.340
<v 7>I'm trying to think of all the fucking horrific things that I did back in the</v>

1505
01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:16.173
day.
Um,

1506
01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:22.220
I remember one time hooking up with a girl who was like 23 or 24 when I was

1507
01:31:22.221 --> 01:31:23.870
about 33 or 34.

1508
01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:25.550
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1509
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:28.460
<v 7>At a,
what the fuck?
She said at one point she got,</v>

1510
01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:34.520
she came over to my apartment and I invite her in.
Right.

1511
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:38.870
Cause I was a veteran at that point.
I don't have to take you to the movie.

1512
01:31:38.871 --> 01:31:41.390
Why do they come on up?
Meet me over my place.

1513
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:43.940
This is embarrassing.

1514
01:31:45.110 --> 01:31:48.380
So she came over and one point we started fucking make it out doing whatever.

1515
01:31:48.381 --> 01:31:52.010
And then she says,
wait a minute,
where is this going?
She hits me with that shit.

1516
01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:52.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1517
01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:57.270
<v 7>And I was like,
uh,
I'm like 11 years older than you.
By the time you're 30,</v>

1518
01:31:57.271 --> 01:32:01.000
I'm going to be 68.
What do you mean?
Where's this going?
It's going nowhere.

1519
01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:02.390
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1520
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:05.060
<v 1>You know,
this is just basically,
yeah,
it's a sexual,</v>

1521
01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:08.610
I'm basically going to be the reason why you're not going to have a midlife

1522
01:32:08.630 --> 01:32:12.470
crisis because all the fucked up shit you want to try but are too afraid to do

1523
01:32:12.471 --> 01:32:15.830
with the guy you're in love with.
You can just do it with me,
obviously.

1524
01:32:15.831 --> 01:32:18.770
I said a little smoother than that and then,
you know,
she was just like,
oh,

1525
01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:19.693
all right.

1526
01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:24.020
<v 7>Oh Jesus Christ.
And then,
oh,
I can't even tell you what happened then.</v>

1527
01:32:24.690 --> 01:32:26.480
And it's not sexual.
It's disgusting.

1528
01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:28.630
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1529
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:31.720
<v 7>Oh God.
I gotta tell you this.
This is really fucked up.
This is why I'm so happy.</v>

1530
01:32:31.721 --> 01:32:34.360
I've got a great girl now.
So we ended up fooling around

1531
01:32:36.170 --> 01:32:40.900
and uh,
the next morning,
wake up,

1532
01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:45.340
you know,
he started in the living room and it in the bedroom,
you know,

1533
01:32:45.370 --> 01:32:48.550
that whole thing.
You never,
you never give him a chance to reconsider.
Right.

1534
01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:52.900
I don't even give them the chance to fucking think about it from the living room

1535
01:32:52.901 --> 01:32:54.160
into the bedroom.
You don't do that.

1536
01:32:54.161 --> 01:32:57.370
You just constantly hands are moving and you kiss it on the whole fucking thing.

1537
01:32:57.371 --> 01:33:01.920
Right.
So
she goes,
this is,
I can't believe him.

1538
01:33:01.921 --> 01:33:03.820
I tell you this.
She goes,

1539
01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:08.290
I walk out into the liver gum the next day cause she's getting dressed and she's

1540
01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:12.700
looking for underwear.
And she had these white lace,

1541
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:17.200
like foggy kind of underwear,
not a thong.
Geez.
No thought.
Yeah.

1542
01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:23.650
And they were in a,
they were crumpled up on the floor.

1543
01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:26.560
All right.
If anybody gets really grossed out,

1544
01:33:26.561 --> 01:33:31.030
I suggest just shut it off here right now.
All right.

1545
01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:34.570
I looked down at them,
so proud of myself,
you know,

1546
01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:40.450
that I hooked up and I looked down and there was a skid mark about,

1547
01:33:40.810 --> 01:33:45.010
I would say at least four inches long and those white panties.

1548
01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:49.420
And I was like,
what was going to fucking dry heave?

1549
01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:52.390
I didn't go down on her.
Thank God.
Um

1550
01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:57.190
Wow.
It's really just coming back.
And I was just like,

1551
01:33:57.700 --> 01:34:01.420
I didn't know what to do cause she was like,
yeah,
wait,
I can't find mine too.

1552
01:34:01.450 --> 01:34:04.240
It ha ha ha.
So I fucking went out to look for him and I found them.

1553
01:34:04.241 --> 01:34:07.660
And then it's just like,
you know,
if I had a stick in my apartment,

1554
01:34:07.661 --> 01:34:11.110
I would have picked him up and
ended up tour.

1555
01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:17.220
<v 1>But,
uh,
I didn't have a stick,
so I acted like I couldn't find them.</v>

1556
01:34:17.370 --> 01:34:21.120
I wandered over towards the kitchen and then she came walking out.

1557
01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:22.510
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1558
01:34:22.510 --> 01:34:24.160
<v 1>And she's like,
oh,
there they are.</v>

1559
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:28.330
And I know she saw what the problem was and she tried to play it off and she

1560
01:34:28.331 --> 01:34:31.530
just put them on,
Ugh,

1561
01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:35.350
that I,
you know what,
let's have a vote.

1562
01:34:35.351 --> 01:34:37.990
Was that the most disgusting story I've ever told in the pilot?

1563
01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:42.700
That was fucking horrific.
Right?
I Dunno.
W was there any advice in that?

1564
01:34:42.701 --> 01:34:45.160
Jesus Christ,
I don't know.
How the fuck did I relived that one?

1565
01:34:47.290 --> 01:34:49.090
<v 7>Wow.
Wow.</v>

1566
01:34:49.670 --> 01:34:51.810
<v 1>Um,
how about some youtube videos this week?</v>

1567
01:34:51.811 --> 01:34:56.010
Somebody sent me this youtube video of this guy on,
on,
uh,
Dr Phil.
He's like a,

1568
01:34:56.011 --> 01:34:58.060
he has this website,
men are better

1569
01:34:58.060 --> 01:34:59.260
<v 7>than women.com.</v>

1570
01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:03.430
He's really like a cartoon chauvinists cartoon character kind of chauvinist

1571
01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:06.820
stick person where he's just like,
you know,
women aren't good at working.

1572
01:35:06.821 --> 01:35:09.040
I mean they shouldn't have,
they shouldn't be allowed to vote.

1573
01:35:09.041 --> 01:35:12.070
Like he does shit like at that level.
Um,

1574
01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:16.510
which is just cartoonish.
There's a couple of funny things that he says.

1575
01:35:16.511 --> 01:35:19.660
At one point he's standing next to an ATM and he's taken cash out.
He goes,

1576
01:35:19.661 --> 01:35:22.580
this is how women perceive men.
This is how they look at us.

1577
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:28.600
Which obviously not all of them do,
but it's so,

1578
01:35:28.601 --> 01:35:32.920
it's such a true fucking statement.
If he just adjusted a few words,

1579
01:35:33.490 --> 01:35:38.320
said if he said a lot of women or there's a sizable group of women that look at

1580
01:35:38.321 --> 01:35:40.570
guys like this,
you know,

1581
01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:44.020
and I know there's a lot of broads out there that are getting upset by this,

1582
01:35:44.021 --> 01:35:47.710
but you know,
you guys say the same shit,

1583
01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:50.860
don't you guys go on TV and the radio and what?
What's that expression?

1584
01:35:50.861 --> 01:35:52.480
A good man is hard to find.

1585
01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:54.320
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1586
01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:57.920
<v 7>You know,
but for some reason you can't say a good woman's hard to find.
They are,</v>

1587
01:35:57.950 --> 01:36:00.740
they are hard to find.
But this guy basically,
so he goes on,

1588
01:36:00.741 --> 01:36:03.290
Dr Phil and this lady,

1589
01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:08.320
this lady starts heckling him and I'm telling you when I say a classic classic

1590
01:36:10.521 --> 01:36:15.390
comeback,
this the comeback this guy has what would have,
uh,

1591
01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:19.960
any respectable standup comedian on the ground laughing this,

1592
01:36:20.090 --> 01:36:23.840
this fucking lady,
you know,
they do the usual shit.
You know,

1593
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:29.030
when they get insulted when a guy in salt,
some they,
they do,
they basically,

1594
01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.580
females have like a,

1595
01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:33.490
<v 0>okay.</v>

1596
01:36:33.490 --> 01:36:33.761
<v 7>I don't know,</v>

1597
01:36:33.761 --> 01:36:36.460
for some reason they think of the very limited with their arguing ability.

1598
01:36:36.610 --> 01:36:38.660
Like if they get an argument with the guy,
then they're,

1599
01:36:38.661 --> 01:36:40.810
they're either going to attack your Dick size,

1600
01:36:41.530 --> 01:36:46.450
your sexuality or uh,
Oh yeah.
Or whatever.

1601
01:36:46.570 --> 01:36:48.700
So that's basically what this woman does.
She goes,
you know what,

1602
01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:51.760
I'm listening to you.
I bet you you,
you don't go out with any women.
You know,

1603
01:36:51.761 --> 01:36:56.680
she attacked him that way and he fucking,
he,
he brings the hammer down.

1604
01:36:56.681 --> 01:36:57.910
I don't condone what this guy does.

1605
01:36:57.911 --> 01:37:01.600
I actually think what he's doing is like a paint by numbers sort of shock.

1606
01:37:02.110 --> 01:37:02.943
There it is.

1607
01:37:06.190 --> 01:37:10.720
I challenge anyone to have a gay or a ringtone,
the net.
Um,

1608
01:37:11.890 --> 01:37:15.640
anyways,
uh,
check out that youtube video and a,

1609
01:37:15.641 --> 01:37:19.660
we've got a bunch of other funny ones where I'm actually just coming up on an

1610
01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:21.790
hour here.
I'm trying not to make these things too fucking long.
Let's,

1611
01:37:21.791 --> 01:37:24.820
let me just read a couple of more advice and then a couple more.
Is it racist?

1612
01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:29.500
He says.
All right,
here we go.
Bill.
Hi from Australia.
Uh,

1613
01:37:29.501 --> 01:37:32.290
I seem to share a lot of your views and I want some advice on women.

1614
01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.960
Jesus is all women's stuff.
Oh,
this week I'm supposed,

1615
01:37:34.961 --> 01:37:38.080
I'm only asking you because I want confirmation of my stance,

1616
01:37:38.081 --> 01:37:40.900
but who gives a shit?
Okay.
So generally,
uh,

1617
01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:45.400
so I generally look for value in things that I buy are things that I do with my

1618
01:37:45.401 --> 01:37:49.130
time.
I'm in my mid twenties,
and my parents,
um,

1619
01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:53.140
and my parents' friends put a lot of pressure on me to get a girlfriend.

1620
01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:58.410
I've had girlfriends and I always just got bored and sabotage it or fucked it up

1621
01:37:58.411 --> 01:38:01.850
somehow by not paying enough attention,
I pretty much decided that I want,

1622
01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:06.290
don't want to get married.
Everybody calling me boom,
ba,

1623
01:38:06.291 --> 01:38:10.080
ba boom,
ba boom,
ba boom.
Makes me feel important.
It feels like,

1624
01:38:10.081 --> 01:38:14.260
like announcement music.
Like I've just walked in and people are acknowledging.

1625
01:38:15.210 --> 01:38:18.180
I know.
I'm sorry.
I need to download a rig tone.
I should have the oh,

1626
01:38:18.181 --> 01:38:22.130
Jesus ringtone.
But I don't,
um,
anyways,
let's go back to this.
Um,

1627
01:38:23.610 --> 01:38:25.170
fucking sabotage shit.
To be honest,

1628
01:38:25.171 --> 01:38:28.770
I'd rather spend my money on myself and spend my time doing things I want to do.

1629
01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:32.260
Dude,
that's very,
it's very mature.
You know,
you,

1630
01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:34.410
all you're going to do is just end up hurting.
Somebody said,
yeah,

1631
01:38:34.411 --> 01:38:38.930
just bang them in and then leave that,
that hurts way less.
Especially,

1632
01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:42.600
especially if you're upfront.
Where does this go?
It's going nowhere,
sweetheart.

1633
01:38:43.650 --> 01:38:48.450
You'll want to ride it?
Nope.
Sorry.
Um,
as far as sex goes,
it takes too long.

1634
01:38:48.810 --> 01:38:53.010
What?
It's always worse than you thought it would be.
Oh,
I'm sorry.
I haven't read,

1635
01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:54.360
I haven't read any of these,
by the way,

1636
01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:59.550
and you're sweating your balls off under two feet of thermal blankets.
Dude.

1637
01:38:59.551 --> 01:39:02.190
You know you have the option to not have those blankets on.
Seriously,

1638
01:39:02.191 --> 01:39:05.460
what the fuck is it with women and the temperature?
I digress.

1639
01:39:05.670 --> 01:39:08.970
Basically I find women overall to be bad value.

1640
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:11.790
There's two types of men as I see it,

1641
01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:15.150
those interrelationships that seem to be able to tolerate,

1642
01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:20.180
tolerate women and those that women won't go out with because they're ugly or

1643
01:39:21.061 --> 01:39:24.480
don't have enough money,
but I don't fit into either one of those groups.

1644
01:39:24.481 --> 01:39:28.830
I think I'm perfectly capable of acquiring or girlfriend,
but I just can't do it.

1645
01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:31.380
At least I can't be bothered maintaining a relationship.

1646
01:39:31.381 --> 01:39:34.800
I could see myself still being single at your age and was wondering how you've

1647
01:39:34.801 --> 01:39:38.130
dealt with people constantly nagging you about being single.

1648
01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:39.540
I can't really explain

1649
01:39:41.370 --> 01:39:45.180
that the world is overpopulated and I'd rather watch my big TV and peace without

1650
01:39:45.181 --> 01:39:49.950
some little annoying prick running around because then I'm labeled as some sort

1651
01:39:49.951 --> 01:39:53.610
of inhumane monster.
Any advice you can offer will be much appreciated.

1652
01:39:53.611 --> 01:39:56.370
You don't need any advice,
dude.
You know who you are and you know what you want.

1653
01:39:56.371 --> 01:39:59.440
Just continued doing it.
And you have to realize that,
uh,

1654
01:39:59.730 --> 01:40:03.780
people look out of their own heads,
you know,
that's so they see the world,

1655
01:40:03.810 --> 01:40:07.500
how they see it.
And when you don't see it the way they do,
they argue it or they,

1656
01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:11.270
they're just confused.
Uh,
you're not hurting anybody.
You don't,

1657
01:40:11.271 --> 01:40:14.400
there's people out there who get married because they're of a certain age,
like,

1658
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:16.560
I should be getting married.
This is the age you get married.

1659
01:40:16.561 --> 01:40:17.940
They married somebody they're not in love with,

1660
01:40:18.450 --> 01:40:23.370
which is a fucking horrific thing to do to somebody a lot more.
I don't know.

1661
01:40:23.371 --> 01:40:25.020
There's a lot of people out there who shouldn't have kids.

1662
01:40:25.021 --> 01:40:28.770
They just fucking have kids and they're terrible fucking parents and their

1663
01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:29.251
selfish.

1664
01:40:29.251 --> 01:40:33.450
They'd rather sit around watching TV like me or go learn how to play drums like

1665
01:40:33.451 --> 01:40:38.400
me.
I am a selfish self centered cunt and a I w I,

1666
01:40:38.401 --> 01:40:42.690
you know,
I think I'd be a good dad at this point,
but,
um,
you know,

1667
01:40:42.691 --> 01:40:46.440
I was an angry fucking maniac when I was in my twenties.
You think I'm angry now?

1668
01:40:46.441 --> 01:40:49.730
Like this podcast would even have been funny in my twenties.

1669
01:40:49.731 --> 01:40:54.050
It would just be like Jesus,
dude.
Um,
you know,

1670
01:40:54.051 --> 01:40:56.090
when I would have brought a kid in the world then he would have been an angry

1671
01:40:56.091 --> 01:40:57.500
maniac.
So,
uh,

1672
01:40:58.610 --> 01:41:01.730
I dunno kind of bugs me that I waited this long,

1673
01:41:01.731 --> 01:41:05.480
but in general I'm kind of glad I did.
Um,
and what else if with that,

1674
01:41:05.481 --> 01:41:07.610
what the fuck was I going to read?
Oh,
I know.
It's a couple of oh,

1675
01:41:07.611 --> 01:41:10.760
Jesus ones and then we're out of here.
Where the hell,

1676
01:41:10.761 --> 01:41:13.100
how the hell do I get to this?
Ah,
you motherfucker.

1677
01:41:13.670 --> 01:41:17.800
While I'm trying to get to that,
I'm coming up.
I have,
um,
I'm getting,

1678
01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.090
I'm going to be at the,
uh,

1679
01:41:19.091 --> 01:41:24.091
the wise guys in Utah on a March 18th and 19th.

1680
01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.660
I have all that information up on my website,

1681
01:41:26.661 --> 01:41:30.740
[inaudible] dot com please show up for that show as is.

1682
01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:35.450
It's a nice quick flight and I would like to,
I like nice quick flights.

1683
01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:39.090
<v 1>Makes me even funnier.
Right here we go.
Here we go.
Is it racist?</v>

1684
01:41:39.091 --> 01:41:40.230
I haven't read this one at all.

1685
01:41:40.231 --> 01:41:42.630
So I have no fucking idea what this person's going to say.

1686
01:41:42.631 --> 01:41:43.770
So forgive me if this one,

1687
01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:47.130
because the really offensive ignorant ones I just don't read because I think

1688
01:41:47.131 --> 01:41:50.640
people are just fucking around or you're just beyond help.
All right.
Hey,
bill,

1689
01:41:50.641 --> 01:41:54.780
loved your podcast.
Love your comedy,
uh,
yet did at the day.

1690
01:41:54.781 --> 01:41:57.340
Here's what I want to ask.
If it could be race it's way I did.

1691
01:41:57.990 --> 01:42:02.070
When the team warms up in the shoot around,
uh,
I guess basketball,

1692
01:42:02.071 --> 01:42:07.071
they basically well shoot a route and it's always one or two white guys who are

1693
01:42:07.681 --> 01:42:08.491
not players.

1694
01:42:08.491 --> 01:42:12.150
The team managers or assistants who passed the balls back to the players when

1695
01:42:12.151 --> 01:42:13.650
they make or miss their shots.

1696
01:42:13.890 --> 01:42:18.120
But the white player who was suited up in uniform was standing next to the other

1697
01:42:18.121 --> 01:42:22.650
assistants or managers and was passing the ball out to the other black players

1698
01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:25.680
and he never got a chance to take a shot before the game started.

1699
01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:29.700
Considering every player on the team warmed up,

1700
01:42:29.730 --> 01:42:34.170
except for the white guy who was sitting in a lawn chair rebounding for every

1701
01:42:34.171 --> 01:42:38.190
other black player on the team.
Is it racist?
Keep up the great work.

1702
01:42:39.810 --> 01:42:40.643
Um,

1703
01:42:41.730 --> 01:42:42.200
<v 7>okay.</v>

1704
01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:43.730
<v 1>No,
there's no racism going there.</v>

1705
01:42:43.731 --> 01:42:47.960
He's either lazy or hurt or there's some sort of hazing going on.

1706
01:42:47.961 --> 01:42:51.740
He might be a rookie or he fucked up in the last game and that's his punishment.

1707
01:42:52.670 --> 01:42:56.120
Or maybe it was his turn.
I have no idea.
There's no racism going on there.

1708
01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:59.510
I don't think that they were saying,
uh,
you know,

1709
01:42:59.511 --> 01:43:03.920
do they have like a rally their team there and they just decided that,
uh,

1710
01:43:03.921 --> 01:43:07.190
that this guy could not shoot the fucking ball because he was white.
I mean,

1711
01:43:07.191 --> 01:43:08.720
you're really,
you're really stretching it

1712
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:09.623
<v 7>there.</v>

1713
01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:14.080
<v 1>I'll tell you though,
I did go,
I did daddy tell you guys this,
when I went to,
uh,</v>

1714
01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:16.300
when I went to fucking,
uh,

1715
01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:20.800
that Portland Trailblazers game when I was with Paul Versey and we put money on

1716
01:43:20.801 --> 01:43:23.950
the trailblazers and they were making a comeback against New Orleans and they

1717
01:43:23.951 --> 01:43:26.740
came down the court in a fast break and they ditched it over to the white guy

1718
01:43:26.741 --> 01:43:28.750
and he fucking,
I can't remember,
he missed a dunk or whatever.

1719
01:43:28.751 --> 01:43:29.650
And the second he did it,

1720
01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:32.440
me and Paul both looked at each other and went to fucking white guy,

1721
01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:38.200
fucking white guy.
Why would you get out of the game,
put on a suit and fucking,

1722
01:43:38.201 --> 01:43:39.760
you know,
start drawing on that,

1723
01:43:39.761 --> 01:43:43.930
that little fucking legal pad or whatever the fuck is she supposed to be doing.

1724
01:43:43.931 --> 01:43:46.210
But you know,
our stay out on the perimeter,

1725
01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:48.910
don't try to take it to the fucking rack.

1726
01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:50.830
And if you do try to take it to the rack,

1727
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.410
do at Pau Gasol does just start screaming like he just got raped because maybe

1728
01:43:55.411 --> 01:43:59.010
then you can take a couple of unguarded shots,
shots by the,
uh,
the foul line.

1729
01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:04.330
I'm telling you.
Watch your Lakers game anytime.
POW makes a move.
Oh,

1730
01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:08.000
is he goes there.
I just fucking hate that fucking white.

1731
01:44:08.001 --> 01:44:11.550
He's a great basketball player.
But that fucking,
what are you yelling about?

1732
01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:16.240
Sorry.
All right,
Bill.
Is it racist?
Um,

1733
01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:20.910
isn't racist for me to say all Asians are racist?
Uh,
yes,

1734
01:44:21.810 --> 01:44:22.471
I would think so.

1735
01:44:22.471 --> 01:44:26.310
I'm a white guy that happens to have dated a lot of Asian women of different

1736
01:44:26.311 --> 01:44:30.330
backgrounds from some from Asian,
some Asian Americans,
some actually born abroad,

1737
01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:32.910
all of whom were explicitly racist,

1738
01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:36.870
mostly against other Asian ethnicities.
For example,

1739
01:44:36.871 --> 01:44:39.750
my Korean x hates Japanese people.

1740
01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:42.060
A Chinese x hates Filipinos.

1741
01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:47.320
A Japanese x thinks the Chinese are stupid and the Thai Taiwanese or stuck up,

1742
01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:52.140
et cetera.
I should note that I didn't exclusively target Asian women to date.

1743
01:44:52.141 --> 01:44:56.220
I dated all sorts of women.
Some of them were Asian.
Uh,
my wife,
uh,

1744
01:44:56.221 --> 01:45:00.450
white girl thinks it's racist,
racist.
When I say that all Asians are racist.

1745
01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:05.100
Yeah.
Will it is dude,
I mean,
just cause the five that you banked.
I mean,
how many,

1746
01:45:05.101 --> 01:45:08.340
you know what mean Asian women you would have to fuck and have that experience

1747
01:45:08.341 --> 01:45:13.341
with before you realize that now I'm not gonna sit here and try and pretend like

1748
01:45:14.551 --> 01:45:16.230
those groups get along with each other.

1749
01:45:17.770 --> 01:45:18.603
<v 0>You know,</v>

1750
01:45:19.060 --> 01:45:21.910
<v 1>it's pretty safe to say any country that borders and other country,</v>

1751
01:45:21.911 --> 01:45:22.744
they don't like them.

1752
01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:24.733
<v 0>You know,</v>

1753
01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:30.110
<v 1>English England and Ireland,
England and France,
France and Germany,</v>

1754
01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:34.700
Germany and everybody.
Japan,
Koreans,
Japan.
Where they did that.

1755
01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:35.840
I mean,
first of all,

1756
01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:40.960
I understand if a people in China have issues with people in Japan for what the

1757
01:45:41.211 --> 01:45:43.280
fuck they did during World War Two.

1758
01:45:43.281 --> 01:45:45.740
I read this book called the rape and Nan King.
I mean,
that alone,

1759
01:45:46.710 --> 01:45:50.810
it was just fucking brutal.
So I mean,
uh,
I dunno,

1760
01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:55.850
maybe,
maybe you,
I dunno.
I Dunno.
Maybe you just kept,

1761
01:45:55.851 --> 01:45:57.850
you know you don't,
when you keep dating women,

1762
01:45:57.851 --> 01:46:02.480
I mean woman's a psycho and then he kind of figure out that you keep picking

1763
01:46:02.481 --> 01:46:05.480
psychos.
Did you see,
I don't know.
That's kind of,
I'm kind of stretching it there.

1764
01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:08.540
How does that work that you just keep

1765
01:46:10.150 --> 01:46:12.280
somehow picking racist Asian women?

1766
01:46:12.281 --> 01:46:15.070
Were you attracted to them and it's fucking bizarre,
but I think,
yeah,

1767
01:46:15.071 --> 01:46:17.560
I think it is racist to say that you can't say,

1768
01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:21.520
you could say every Asian woman I dated was racist.
If that's what it was.

1769
01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:23.230
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1770
01:46:23.230 --> 01:46:25.000
<v 1>I where the fuck knows.
Anyways,</v>

1771
01:46:25.001 --> 01:46:28.780
hey bill as a fellow pasty white male dating a beautiful black woman.

1772
01:46:28.781 --> 01:46:33.040
I say racist shit all the time.
Really?

1773
01:46:33.670 --> 01:46:35.170
All right.
The n word is off limits,

1774
01:46:35.171 --> 01:46:40.171
but I do make fun of her for having the middle name La Fonts is that I said La.

1775
01:46:43.450 --> 01:46:43.450
P.
H.
O.
N.
Z.

1776
01:46:43.450 --> 01:46:47.740
I also tend to react to any stories on TV shows about young black males by

1777
01:46:47.741 --> 01:46:49.060
saying how hard it,

1778
01:46:51.690 --> 01:46:55.850
<v 7>how hard it is for me to live my life as a strong black man.
And See,</v>

1779
01:46:55.851 --> 01:47:00.390
this is the danger of not reading these up before I considered entering the Mr.

1780
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:04.830
Black San Diego contest.
That would be funny.
I guess.

1781
01:47:04.831 --> 01:47:08.160
Am I racist?
I'm going to end up marrying this beautiful woman,

1782
01:47:08.161 --> 01:47:11.430
sorry about the comedy central show,
not working out.
If you're blah,
blah,
blah,

1783
01:47:11.431 --> 01:47:15.420
blah,
blah.
Ah,
is it racist?
I,

1784
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:19.020
I'd have to hear how you doing it.
If you fucking around and you're being a Dick,

1785
01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:21.780
uh,
you,
you can be a dick.
Yeah.
I mean,

1786
01:47:21.781 --> 01:47:24.900
a lot of the shit that you said and now that I read it out loud on the podcast

1787
01:47:24.901 --> 01:47:27.660
probably would be considered racist or offensive and that type of thing.

1788
01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:32.550
It depends.
Is your girlfriend laughing?
You know,
I mean,
I,

1789
01:47:32.670 --> 01:47:36.330
I believe me,
the shit that comes out of my mouth when I watch TV,

1790
01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:39.960
every fucking thing you could think of.
I make fun of fucking everybody.

1791
01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:44.560
Um,
so I,
I if you,

1792
01:47:44.561 --> 01:47:49.370
if you're doing that like micro watches,
reality TV,
I fucking can't stand it.

1793
01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:52.730
Okay.
So I make fun of every God damn person on it.

1794
01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:56.450
And she laughed.
Sometimes other times she gets annoyed,

1795
01:47:56.451 --> 01:47:59.960
but the reason why she's getting annoyed is because of disrupting the show.

1796
01:47:59.961 --> 01:48:03.950
Not because I'm truly saying anything offensive,
but,
um,

1797
01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:08.350
I dunno.
I Dunno.
Is it,
is it racist that you're doing that?

1798
01:48:08.590 --> 01:48:11.560
I think she would say something.
You know,

1799
01:48:11.561 --> 01:48:13.930
I think the day she gets up and punches you in the face,

1800
01:48:13.931 --> 01:48:15.940
I think you're going to know or she really gets mad.

1801
01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:19.450
And if she really gets fucking mad,
then you have to realize that you're be,

1802
01:48:19.451 --> 01:48:23.380
that you're taking it beyond the point.
Uh,

1803
01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:26.080
and then also just because you have a black girlfriend,
you can't use that.

1804
01:48:26.081 --> 01:48:30.250
It'd be like,
well,
I have a black girlfriend.
I can't be racist.
Yes you can.
Yes,

1805
01:48:30.251 --> 01:48:34.060
you can.
Um,
you could still be fucked up,
you know?

1806
01:48:35.620 --> 01:48:38.290
Right.
You could have issues with,
but with other groups of people.
Jesus Christ,

1807
01:48:38.291 --> 01:48:39.880
I am,
I'm fucking sick of this topic.

1808
01:48:40.330 --> 01:48:42.580
I think this might be the last week of this fucking topic.
All right.

1809
01:48:42.610 --> 01:48:45.020
I've had an enormous,
maybe it's because I'm in a hotel room.
Well,

1810
01:48:45.021 --> 01:48:48.430
you can't open the fucking windows and it's 900 fucking degrees out.

1811
01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:50.560
<v 0>Okay?</v>

1812
01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:51.220
<v 7>You know,</v>

1813
01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:54.280
why can't I open the fucking windows and get fresh air in here instead of having

1814
01:48:54.281 --> 01:48:57.250
to turn on the God damn air conditioner.
Why the fuck can't I do that shit?

1815
01:48:57.370 --> 01:49:00.160
You know why?
Cause there's a bunch of sue happy fucking cuts out here,

1816
01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:03.320
which is why he can't open the fucking windows in a hotel room because they got

1817
01:49:03.330 --> 01:49:07.240
to worry that some Douche bag is going to get drunk and fall out or jump out

1818
01:49:07.241 --> 01:49:11.530
himself,
you know?
So then guys like me have to suffer.

1819
01:49:11.770 --> 01:49:15.400
It's the same fucking reason why you can't find a God damn hotel pool that's

1820
01:49:15.401 --> 01:49:19.030
deeper than three feet because some fucking asshole is going to get drunk and

1821
01:49:19.031 --> 01:49:22.960
drown himself in a legitimate deep end.
Oh,

1822
01:49:22.961 --> 01:49:26.680
here's something I learned and I actually tweeted about it like a fucking pussy

1823
01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:31.030
is um,
here's one for you.
Don't judge a hotel by its lobby.

1824
01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:33.093
All right?

1825
01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:37.450
It's the same thing is when you have a piece of shit car and you want to sell
it,

1826
01:49:37.451 --> 01:49:40.210
so you slap some rims on it,
you know,

1827
01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:44.050
or a high performance fucking exhaust system.

1828
01:49:44.051 --> 01:49:47.660
So it sounds like it has more power than it does.
All right.

1829
01:49:48.610 --> 01:49:48.770
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1830
01:49:48.770 --> 01:49:49.830
<v 7>It's fucking,
yeah,
cause they,</v>

1831
01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:53.760
they go all out with the lobby and then he put that shit on the website and you

1832
01:49:53.761 --> 01:49:57.390
think everything's fucking fine and dandy.
And then all of a sudden what happens?

1833
01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:01.230
You get in the God damn elevator and you step off the elevator and they have

1834
01:50:01.231 --> 01:50:06.231
that casino rug from fucking 1973 it looks like they sewed together like 12

1835
01:50:06.751 --> 01:50:08.940
Robin Williams fucking shirts.

1836
01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:16.050
Dude.
I have in my hotel,
I have an old school fucking,

1837
01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:20.370
what do you call the old or old tube?
It's not a flat screen.

1838
01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:22.180
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1839
01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:23.860
<v 7>It's fucking ridiculous.
The amount of money.</v>

1840
01:50:23.861 --> 01:50:28.830
I'm on Miami beach and I don't want to fucking talk about it.
Whatever.

1841
01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:31.180
All right.
That's the podcast for this God damn week.
All right.

1842
01:50:31.181 --> 01:50:34.680
People stopped suing people so we can have legitimate fucking pools.
Can you,

1843
01:50:34.710 --> 01:50:37.210
can you do that so he can open a hotel fucking window?

1844
01:50:37.810 --> 01:50:39.880
It's your fault if you fall out.
Okay.

1845
01:50:39.881 --> 01:50:43.060
It's your fault if your kid's a moron and you're not a good parent.

1846
01:50:43.061 --> 01:50:45.490
If the kid crawled away from you and fell out the fucking window,

1847
01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:49.090
what were you doing?
Huh?
Tie him down.

1848
01:50:51.810 --> 01:50:54.660
That's fucking brutal.
Um,
all right,
that's the podcast for this week.

1849
01:50:54.661 --> 01:50:58.660
I'm going to have hype some ups,
upcoming dates here.
Uh,
I'm like,

1850
01:50:58.830 --> 01:51:02.910
I never sweated during a fucking podcast before.
Suddenly ridiculously hot.

1851
01:51:03.710 --> 01:51:07.950
Um,
all right,
here we go.
Um,
and we get wise guys in West Valley City,

1852
01:51:08.130 --> 01:51:08.963
Utah.

1853
01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:10.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1854
01:51:10.090 --> 01:51:14.580
<v 7>Um,
on March 18th and 19th,
which you guys think about that,</v>

1855
01:51:14.581 --> 01:51:17.080
that kid on Byu,
sorry,
I had the hiccups.

1856
01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:21.940
The kid on Byu played on the basketball team and he admitted that he had

1857
01:51:21.941 --> 01:51:24.630
premarital sex,
knocked his girlfriend up,

1858
01:51:24.631 --> 01:51:26.800
said he was gonna marry her and they still kicked him off the team.

1859
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:30.510
<v 1>I've got to go with the college on that one.
Believe it or not.
You know,</v>

1860
01:51:30.810 --> 01:51:33.210
they told you what the rules were.
If you didn't like the rules,

1861
01:51:33.211 --> 01:51:37.140
don't go to the fucking school.
You know?
That's like if I,

1862
01:51:37.141 --> 01:51:38.610
if I get booked on a corporate Gig,

1863
01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:40.500
I know I've used this example before and they said,

1864
01:51:40.501 --> 01:51:45.180
we want him to work totally clean.
This is how much we're going to pay.
And I say,

1865
01:51:45.181 --> 01:51:50.040
okay,
and then I show up and then I start dropping f bombs.
Right?

1866
01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:55.690
They're fucking,
did they have the right to get mad?
Don't take the fucking Gig.

1867
01:51:55.810 --> 01:52:00.170
Don't go to Byu Byu.
If you want some pussy this,
they,
they,

1868
01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:02.830
they make you sign a no pussy contract.

1869
01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:06.820
Don't sit there and act surprised and all these other fucking assholes who

1870
01:52:06.821 --> 01:52:09.610
aren't Mormons with 32 wide.
That's why they,

1871
01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:11.690
that's why they marry so many fucking women,
by the way.

1872
01:52:11.691 --> 01:52:14.950
It's that they're trying to make up for those college years when they didn't get

1873
01:52:14.951 --> 01:52:19.000
the fuck,
you know,
and now because they're married,

1874
01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:23.020
they can have a fucking orgy.
Can you imagine that?

1875
01:52:23.890 --> 01:52:26.410
That would be,
that would probably,
do you think that would be worth it?

1876
01:52:26.890 --> 01:52:31.300
And I know the old joke,
Jesus Christ,
you can't even put a warm,
warm welcome for,

1877
01:52:32.290 --> 01:52:34.900
you know,
actually the reality is she just get,
you know,

1878
01:52:34.901 --> 01:52:38.740
a couple of call girls and do that,
pay him and then just have him fucking leave.

1879
01:52:38.741 --> 01:52:42.910
Right.
That's probably what you should do.
But if you had four fucking wives,

1880
01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:45.613
that would be great.

1881
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:50.420
<v 0>You would win every argument unless they all banded together,</v>

1882
01:52:50.421 --> 01:52:52.670
then you'd be in trouble.
Okay?

1883
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:55.910
<v 1>Oh Jesus.
You could do a lot of pimp shit to start,
you know,</v>

1884
01:52:57.710 --> 01:52:59.720
to gain even more control.
You could just,
you know,

1885
01:52:59.721 --> 01:53:01.250
the ones that are the weakest one,

1886
01:53:01.251 --> 01:53:03.410
you start treating her the best cause she's doing all the good shit.

1887
01:53:03.411 --> 01:53:07.400
Then you break down the other ones,
you know,
do you get them in line?

1888
01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:11.360
Then they look like once you know these proud

1889
01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:15.320
free mustangs running in the wind,

1890
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:18.220
now they're just sitting there with their heads looking down at the coppers.

1891
01:53:18.230 --> 01:53:22.270
They bring you over TV dinner.
I think I'm gonna move to Utah.
Um,

1892
01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:24.080
I'm also going to be at the,
uh,

1893
01:53:24.730 --> 01:53:29.730
I'm going to be at the Ritchie Reci or theater in Maryland on April 8th,

1894
01:53:31.551 --> 01:53:36.551
and I'm going to be at the a tower theater in Philadelphia on April the ninth.

1895
01:53:37.970 --> 01:53:42.350
Um,
all these dates are on bill [inaudible] dot com and uh,
that is that,
that is,

1896
01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:46.110
that is the podcast for this week.
I hope all you guys,
uh,

1897
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:51.050
hope you enjoyed it.
I hope you learn some things.
I hope,

1898
01:53:51.051 --> 01:53:54.410
I hope I annoyed some pot heads out there.
Potheads I'm just fucking around it,

1899
01:53:54.411 --> 01:53:56.810
right?
Smoke it every God damn day.
I don't give a shit.
All right,

1900
01:53:56.811 --> 01:53:59.930
but don't give me this horse shit that it's not addicting.
Alright.

1901
01:54:01.130 --> 01:54:03.470
You smoke it because you can't fucking deal.

1902
01:54:04.970 --> 01:54:07.250
I shouldn't even tell you this story.
I had a buddy of mine,
he was fucking,

1903
01:54:07.251 --> 01:54:10.880
he was working at a car dealership one time and he got high and there was

1904
01:54:10.881 --> 01:54:13.130
somebody looking at a car.
Oh honey.
You know,

1905
01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:18.080
and they were bent down in front of the car and he got in the car and it was a

1906
01:54:18.081 --> 01:54:18.771
stick shift.

1907
01:54:18.771 --> 01:54:21.770
And he didn't press in the clutch and he turned the key and it alerts 40 hit the

1908
01:54:21.771 --> 01:54:22.604
guy right in the head.

1909
01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:28.093
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1910
01:54:29.590 --> 01:54:33.110
<v 1>And He tried to act.
He would never admit that he was high.
It was like,
dude,</v>

1911
01:54:33.111 --> 01:54:37.280
it was,
he goes,
he calls me up,
right?
He's like,
dude,

1912
01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:40.910
he leaves a message.
He's whispering.
That's how fucking scared he is.

1913
01:54:40.911 --> 01:54:43.280
He's whispering into my phone.
Maybe he's at work.
I don't know.
Saying,

1914
01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:48.350
<v 8>dude,
I,
I,
I hit somebody with a car,
dude.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.</v>

1915
01:54:48.650 --> 01:54:51.790
Aye.
I thought I had the car,
dude.
Dude,
I,
I,

1916
01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:54.740
I thought I had the car in neutral dude.
And I,

1917
01:54:55.610 --> 01:54:59.600
I went to turn the key and it,
dude,
I hit the guy in the head,

1918
01:54:59.601 --> 01:55:01.790
dude to call me.

1919
01:55:05.610 --> 01:55:07.610
<v 1>Somehow he didn't get fired.
Uh,</v>

1920
01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:10.710
that's another reason why I think weed is worse than booze.
People that you know,

1921
01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:15.210
you can get fucking high at work.
No one fucking knows.
No one knows,
you know,

1922
01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:18.600
little visor,
a little fucking gum.
No one knows,
right?

1923
01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:23.280
You guys are bringing down this country with your fucking cookies.

1924
01:55:23.310 --> 01:55:28.140
You realize that you're a bunch of Lazy Dorita wheat and sons of bitches.

1925
01:55:29.190 --> 01:55:29.810
<v 0>Okay?</v>

1926
01:55:29.810 --> 01:55:31.340
<v 1>Just sitting there getting baked.</v>

1927
01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:36.700
Do you realize that you'll potheads of the reason why so many awful movies get

1928
01:55:36.861 --> 01:55:39.140
made?
Cause they know,

1929
01:55:39.170 --> 01:55:42.980
they know people out there a smoking dope and then when they put it out on on,

1930
01:55:43.410 --> 01:55:44.130
they're going to fucking

1931
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:44.963
<v 2>rent it.</v>

1932
01:55:45.410 --> 01:55:48.540
And it doesn't only ways to be like remotely funny and then Shit that wasn't

1933
01:55:48.541 --> 01:55:49.530
even supposed to be funny.

1934
01:55:49.531 --> 01:55:52.950
It's going to be funny because he's fucking pot heads are going to be sitting

1935
01:55:52.951 --> 01:55:55.470
there.
They're going to be high giggling

1936
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:59.760
like a bunch of school girls.
You know,

1937
01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:05.180
you pot has got a lot of fucking balls.
You realize that

1938
01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:11.530
you fucking disgusting fucking habit.
Passing it around to each other.
It's white.

1939
01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:14.140
That's what is.
There's so many goddamn cold sores out there.

1940
01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:17.620
You know the number one cause of cold sores in this country.

1941
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:21.070
It's you fucking potheads passing the things around each other.

1942
01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:26.450
Do you realize that?
You know,
I'm real cracking open a beer.

1943
01:56:26.451 --> 01:56:29.930
I don't remember passing it around and nine other fucking people.
Hey,

1944
01:56:29.931 --> 01:56:32.810
let me get a swig of that.
Open your own.
You can't.

1945
01:56:34.130 --> 01:56:38.600
That's why I like weed,
man.
It's more social.
Yeah,
go fuck yourself.

1946
01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:44.150
Did you go to take a fucking shower and take off those goddamn outback pants?

1947
01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:49.580
All right,
I'm sick of all right.
With your bracelet around your ankle.

1948
01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:53.540
All right.
You're not more in touch with nature because you're smoking trees.

1949
01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:57.680
All right?
Get out there.
Get a fucking job.
Straighten up.

1950
01:56:57.681 --> 01:57:02.681
Potheads you just spent the last decade of your life on a fucking couch.

1951
01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:06.830
You know,
when are you gonna put your helmet on?
Getting the Goddamn game.

1952
01:57:06.831 --> 01:57:11.780
So what you're gonna do,
you're gonna sit there
like some kept woman,

1953
01:57:12.210 --> 01:57:16.610
Cynthia kept by yourself and you're fucking awful habit.
I got to get high,
dude.

1954
01:57:16.611 --> 01:57:17.900
I can't deal unless I'm high.

1955
01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:21.080
You know you can really going to sit there and act like you don't know that guy.

1956
01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:25.920
How come all they talk about is the alcoholics.
This is like the fucking broads.

1957
01:57:25.921 --> 01:57:27.540
All they do is talk about wife beaters,

1958
01:57:27.690 --> 01:57:29.670
but they never bring up gold digging horse.

1959
01:57:30.930 --> 01:57:35.930
Why don't you fucking get your God damn fucking pothead ass up off the couch and

1960
01:57:36.031 --> 01:57:38.490
go look in the fucking mirror?
Look,
look what you're doing to yourself.

1961
01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:43.470
Look at your eyes.
Feel how your brain feels compressed.
I'm looking down,

1962
01:57:43.471 --> 01:57:46.080
my alkie knows it all.
You fucking potheads.

1963
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:54.350
There is a reason why weed is illegal and alcohol isn't all right cause alcohol

1964
01:57:55.651 --> 01:57:59.650
is better for you.
Alcohol is what a man does.
All right.

1965
01:58:00.630 --> 01:58:04.860
We'd is what some pussy does.
Who,
who can't afford to pay for a good pizza?

1966
01:58:05.310 --> 01:58:08.820
So he's got a fucking get himself so fucking disoriented that that's how

1967
01:58:08.821 --> 01:58:12.300
Domino's survives.
Those fucking assholes.

1968
01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:17.760
Do you know Domino's makes such shitty pizza that actually potheads even fucking

1969
01:58:17.761 --> 01:58:19.080
noticed.
You realize that.

1970
01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:23.550
So they actually had to have an ad campaign where they fucking admit that their

1971
01:58:23.551 --> 01:58:28.140
pizza sucks and that it's stuck to the top of the box and it's completely

1972
01:58:28.141 --> 01:58:33.000
unacceptable,
right?
And now they're big ad campaign is we,
uh,

1973
01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:37.020
we admit that our pizza sucks and now we're going to start trying.

1974
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:38.940
We've only been around for what,

1975
01:58:38.941 --> 01:58:42.310
30 fucking years now we're actually going to to make decent pizza.

1976
01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:46.570
<v 1>Right?
So you think automatically they're going to raise the price.</v>

1977
01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:47.950
They're going to add to the quality.

1978
01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:52.870
This still selling like a large cheese pizza for five 99.
All right.
People,

1979
01:58:52.871 --> 01:58:57.610
you get what you pay for.
All right?
Don't order Domino's.
That's pothead pizza.

1980
01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:03.520
That's what those fucking drug users,
that's what,

1981
01:59:03.521 --> 01:59:06.820
that's,
that's what they,
they stick in their temple.
All right.

1982
01:59:06.821 --> 01:59:08.470
That's why they're so fucking dumb.

1983
01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:12.460
That's why it was the last time you talked to a smart pot head.
Have you ever,

1984
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:15.400
you ever seen a pothead with initiative?

1985
01:59:16.590 --> 01:59:17.423
<v 0>You know,</v>

1986
01:59:20.770 --> 01:59:23.370
<v 1>you know people are going to take that seriously and start sending me fucking</v>

1987
01:59:23.371 --> 01:59:27.660
emails about,
uh,
well what about Bob Marley bed?
Well,

1988
01:59:27.670 --> 01:59:32.080
we fucking go new kind of music,
man.
He was fucking dead.

1989
01:59:32.081 --> 01:59:35.300
A lung cancer,
you know,

1990
01:59:35.301 --> 01:59:38.750
from smoking goddamn joints the size of a bus exhaust.

1991
01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:40.820
It's no different,

1992
01:59:40.821 --> 01:59:43.730
no different than a booze hound or drinks himself to death at 28.

1993
01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:46.720
You know,
I think you know,

1994
01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:49.930
I think your part as you guys have been on your high horse long enough,

1995
01:59:49.931 --> 01:59:51.940
I think it's time I fucking knocked you off a little bit.

1996
01:59:53.410 --> 01:59:56.680
Even going to notice you probably already off the horse laying in the grass,

1997
01:59:57.190 --> 02:00:01.000
right?
Letting a breeze go through your toes.
Is that what you did today?

1998
02:00:01.001 --> 02:00:02.770
Instead of going out and earning your fucking rent,

1999
02:00:02.771 --> 02:00:04.780
you've got to call your parents up again this week.

2000
02:00:05.650 --> 02:00:08.560
Hit him up with some more money because you ran out of fucking Cheetos.

2001
02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:11.373
<v 0>Huh?</v>

2002
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:15.490
<v 1>You're too fucking old to have a full body.
Tim.</v>

2003
02:00:15.491 --> 02:00:20.110
Why don't you go get a God damn job.
You son of a bitch.
All right.
There you go.

2004
02:00:21.100 --> 02:00:24.640
Once a week.
I got to try to piss off one group,
but keeps the emails coming.
Um,

2005
02:00:24.670 --> 02:00:27.610
all right,
that's it.
That's the podcast for this week.
I want to thank everybody,

2006
02:00:27.611 --> 02:00:30.230
Sarah scene.
I'm not fucking around here like I was with the potheads there,

2007
02:00:30.250 --> 02:00:34.180
right?
So fucking don't get all fucking pissed off me.
And,
um,

2008
02:00:34.270 --> 02:00:36.910
I want to thank everybody who came out to my shows at the,
uh,

2009
02:00:36.911 --> 02:00:40.840
the Miami Symphony fucking,
uh,
Superman's house.

2010
02:00:41.850 --> 02:00:44.200
It's really what it looked like.
Um,

2011
02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:49.330
and I really hope a bunch of people show up in Utah,
uh,
and don't be,

2012
02:00:49.331 --> 02:00:53.380
don't be stuck up.
Cons,
all right?
With your fucking religion.

2013
02:00:54.370 --> 02:00:56.170
Okay.
I,
I don't need that.

2014
02:00:57.580 --> 02:01:01.720
I don't need you and your seven wives sitting there staring at me like I got a

2015
02:01:01.721 --> 02:01:05.620
fucking problem.
All right.
Fuck you.

2016
02:01:05.621 --> 02:01:10.230
And your legal orgy.
Okay.

2017
02:01:10.231 --> 02:01:12.990
I think that's it.
All right.
That's a podcast.
Everybody go fuck yourselves.

2018
02:01:12.991 --> 02:01:15.390
I'll talk to you next week.
Have a good week.
Don't talk any shit.

2019
02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:18.690
I'll talk some shit.
Don't take any shit.
There we go.
That's it.

2020
02:01:18.691 --> 02:01:20.220
I'm going to go get a sunburn.
I'll see you.

2021
02:01:26.350 --> 02:01:27.460
<v 4>You want and go.</v>

2022
02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:33.120
And just to gather right

2023
02:01:34.830 --> 02:01:38.380

would you mind

2024
02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:41.133
sharing?

2025
02:01:46.410 --> 02:01:46.620
Yeah.
