00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.990
Hey,

It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:08.991
It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday fucking Monday,

3
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.130
either year,
August 15th,
2016 what's going on?

4
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:16.210
How are Ya?
Oh,

5
00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:21.060
freckles finished his tour,
finished his tour strong.

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.010
Um,
I did my last two nights,
one Cologne,
Germany,

7
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:30.090
and then the other aunt twerp and Torben,
uh,
Belgium

8
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.680
got a frog in my throat here.
Um,

9
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.590
just amazing shows and I got to tell you something.

10
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:42.480
I want a special thank you to the people who came out in Germany.

11
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.250
I fucking did my Hitler Shit and I thought that they were going to pull back.

12
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:50.460
They loved it and I don't mean loved it.
Like,
yeah,
bring the guy back.

13
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:54.030
They had a great sense of humor about it and um,

14
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.400
oh yeah,
it was great too.

15
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.180
And then all my other shit too was working rows of just a great show.

16
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.640
And um,
I learned a lot about the city.
Oh No,
you didn't bill,

17
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.650
you were there for fucking like 17 hours.
I went on their Wikipedia page,
Cologne,

18
00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:11.130
Germany,

19
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.130
and I found out that it was one of the most bombed cities of a World War II.

20
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.430
So it was this weird thing where it was this really old city,

21
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:24.270
but everything was brand new because the allied's fucking blew everything up

22
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.040
except for this one church,
you know,
which I don't understand how it survived.

23
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.660
It's got the really tall fucking Spiers,
you know,

24
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.610
it was just sitting there.
It had like,

25
00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:38.100
must have had like Mayweather fucking head movement.

26
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.080
I don't know how it avoided it.
I asked her,
I don't get how like Cologne,

27
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:48.081
Germany somehow got bombed more than Hiroshima or Nagasaki.

28
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:51.030
I mean they got fucking,
is it,
cause it was just one,

29
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.430
one bomb that really redefined the old right there.
Fred,
you know,

30
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.220
when you drop a fucking atom bomb on somebody that that is,

31
00:02:00.221 --> 00:02:03.120
that is probably the ultimate right there,
Fred,

32
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.680
where I'm Cologne.
Germany was more just like,

33
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.950
do you remember that fight?
Uh,

34
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.980
what the fuck George Saint Pierre had where he just kept punching that other guy

35
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.030
right in his fucking eye.
We Jab,
Jab,
Jab,

36
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:23.370
and he kept hitting him in the exact same fucking place.

37
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.560
That's what we did to Cologne,
Germany where Japan,

38
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.260
that was more like a,
an Anderson silver.
Well,
you know,

39
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:34.230
when you stand in there and you'd think he's going to throw a jab and then he

40
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:38.310
somehow gives you an uppercut with his foot.
Is it bill?

41
00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:43.260
Is that what at the atomic bomb was like?
I don't know.

42
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.580
I don't fucking know.
Um,
anyways,
so,
uh,

43
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:51.270
the tour finished up strong and uh,

44
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.010
I don't hear a lot of people ever saying that they go to Belgium,
you know,

45
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:59.920
at least in the states.
Um,
Jesus Christ,
it was fucking incredible.

46
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.683
Um,

47
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.120
the number one thing that was so fucking cool about Belgium is there beer

48
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:10.900
glasses of the shit.
Every fucking beer.
It's like,

49
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:14.470
it has its own God damned chalice that it puts it in.

50
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.510
<v 1>Just,
I dunno,
we just psychologically it all tastes better.</v>

51
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.660
I bought some chocolates there from my lovely wife

52
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.270
<v 0>and now I'm going to be on vacation here.
All right.</v>

53
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.160
But fucking,
oh,
Billy fat again is hitting the gym.

54
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.170
I did,
uh,
did 45 minutes on the,
uh,

55
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.950
the elliptical yesterday and then went right into town and got myself a large

56
00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:47.180
pizza that I ate by myself
and he is laughing at me.

57
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.800
Then I had a coca cola with that.

58
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.360
<v 1>What else did I have?
I,
what else did I,
and I had a fucking gelato.</v>

59
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.610
Oh.
And I had to call cal Calamari how they said it,
right.

60
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.320
I'm like,
can I get some fried Calamari?
And the guy goes,

61
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.390
Calamari.
I'm like,
yeah,

62
00:04:09.391 --> 00:04:13.080
the way you said it to what you said sounds great the way I say it.

63
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.050
Just fucking terrible.
So,
um,

64
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.140
that's what I had for lunch.

65
00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:23.310
So I should have done four hours and 45 minutes on the fucking elliptical.

66
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.710
My fucking belly is so God damn round right now.
It's ridiculous.

67
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.980
You know,
it was hilarious.
The,
uh,
the Italian fellow

68
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.840
<v 0>that picked me up at the airport and by pick me up,
I'm just mean,</v>

69
00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:39.150
he just had a great opening line and I couldn't resist

70
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.070
<v 1>the taxi guy.</v>

71
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.240
He fucking said the funniest shit was saying how hard he was working during the

72
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.660
summer.
And he goes,
he goes,
that's why my body,
he goes,
it goes,

73
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.630
it's white like the Mozzarella.
And I was going,

74
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.020
I fucking died laughing because I have been caught my legs.

75
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.040
I had been called every a fucking Casper fucking yard sticks,

76
00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:06.780
you know,
in Golf,
uh,
chalk legs,
all this shit.

77
00:05:06.781 --> 00:05:10.520
No one ever said your legs.
The white,
like the Mozzarella.

78
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.990
You know,
it's funny about Mozzarella.
Is it sweaty too?

79
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.640
It's all fucking wet wipe.
It's only redeeming qualities.

80
00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:23.000
It tastes so good.
But if it just didn't taste good,

81
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.010
you just be like a ball of white slime and a,

82
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.020
yeah.
When I'm on the elliptical,
I'm like a big red fucking ball.
Mood.

83
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.860
Crl,
um,
came in.

84
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.133
What did you say?

85
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.500
Remember when I said you had legs dipped and flower?
Yes,
I remember all of those.

86
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.060
I remember all of them vividly.
What are you doing?

87
00:05:51.061 --> 00:05:53.790
Are you going to be on the podcast?
He just going to lay there giggling in the

88
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.940
<v 0>ground.
Can I,
can I do both?
No.</v>

89
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.490
You know what?
It was near.
You had that little fucking doughnut.

90
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.160
That's what puts you down on Mount.
I fucking hate donuts.
How do you hate?
I like,

91
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.570
I like kind of mighty.
I like the Margarita Pizza.

92
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.090
The colors of the Italian flag meeting.
You think that was it?
It was so little.

93
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:19.580
It was like,
it wasn't even a real size donut.

94
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.000
It wasn't even the size of a Munchkin from Dunkin.
Yeah,
it was.

95
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.450
It was smaller than the exact size of that.
Eat One of those.

96
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.980
It was smaller than a Munchkin.
This is why I don't like donuts.
Okay.

97
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:35.120
Most of them stink like that one.
That one was not good.
I thought it was good.

98
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.020
All right.
All right.
Well,
okay.
Fair enough.

99
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.100
All right.
But you eat one of those in your body just goes,
what the fuck?
Yeah,

100
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.850
it's the ultimate.
What the fuck?
Fruit.
It's sifting through it.

101
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.440
Where's the nourishment?
It's nothing,
Nini.
I'm eating pizza and Calamari.

102
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.650
Yeah.

103
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.650
You know even that shit makes sure that that the Gullah mark that was fucking

104
00:06:57.771 --> 00:07:00.980
light.
Yes it was.
Even though it was bad for you and all that shit,

105
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:02.270
but fucking don't.

106
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.970
At least there's some sort of protein and there's someone in there.

107
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:08.940
There's a fucking squid.
Is that what it is?
So yeah,
it's squid.
Squid.
Yeah,

108
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.410
it's all right.
So once you get past the bat or knowledge shit in there,

109
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:16.220
there was something that has some sort of nutrition.
Eat a fucking doughnut.

110
00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:21.170
It's just like no,
it's all sugar and doe.
Yeah.
Yeah.

111
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:25.100
I eat one of those and I feel like I,
uh,
I was up early though,

112
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.830
too earlier than you.
So I feel like,
oh,
I know.

113
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.720
I realize that this whole fucking vacation
I finally get to sleep.

114
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.230
I haven't slept in like 10 days.
Okay.
Because you know,

115
00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:40.490
I was going from country to country and then I was also drinking like fucking

116
00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:44.270
Nick naulty in 48 hours.
Did he drink or is just sound like a drunk?

117
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.520
Um,
so I wasn't getting a lot of sleep,
so now I'm catching up on all that.

118
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.830
Do you know what you said,
nick?
Naughty and I thought,
Gary Busey,

119
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.490
they're interchangeable.
Right?

120
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.700
But one of them is crazy and the other one isn't right.

121
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.270
One of them is like normal.
Yeah.
But they're like,
they look,

122
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.770
they really look like each other.
They got a similar,

123
00:08:07.771 --> 00:08:12.590
which is the same thing like the Spiderman guy and the hobbit.

124
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:15.740
Dude look the same to me.
Oh,

125
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:18.440
Toby McGuire and Elijah Wood.
Yeah.

126
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.840
So that's the petite men,
brown haired,

127
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:27.140
like blue wide boys that make like fantasy movies.
Right?

128
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.320
Yeah.
To me they're the same.
They're there.
The

129
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.460
Nick naulty and,
and,
and,
and what's his face of Gary?
Gary Busey.

130
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.200
Elijah Wood and Tobey Maguire.
All right.
Wait,

131
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:44.600
what was the movie we were talking about yesterday?

132
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.660
It was one of a Hashtag Bibi's titles.

133
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.343
<v 2>Uh</v>

134
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.160
<v 0>Oh,
right.
How I'm here.
Your computer.</v>

135
00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:00.040
<v 1>Oh,
that's sick.
Yeah.
When I was in Germany.
Um,</v>

136
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.850
but the story about the three nerds in the check then yeah.

137
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:10.530
You called it how I made her compete.
Yeah.

138
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.280
But I knew that was wrong.
I just kept thinking third rock from the sun.
Right.

139
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.630
I don't know why.
No,
what's the name?
There's no number on that show.

140
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.230
Big Bang theory.
Yeah,
but you kept called

141
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.050
how I met your computer.

142
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.753
This smart.

143
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.990
It's all of those sick cause I don't watch any of those sitcoms just cause,
uh,

144
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.260
I'm out of the loop with that stuff.
But I liked that show and I watched it,

145
00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:42.290
but I just sent you a video of it cause I was in Germany and uh,

146
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.270
the tallest one of the kids there on on Big Bang theory just watching him and in

147
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.230
a German accent.

148
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.600
<v 3>Oh Jim Parsons.
He's the one that wins all the MES.</v>

149
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.870
So you liked you like big bath theory?
I've never,

150
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.930
I've never seen a single episode and it's like the biggest show,

151
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.030
Big Bang Bang.
I have not seen that single episode.

152
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:09.600
<v 1>Well,
I don't know.
I enjoyed it.
I enjoyed watching it in German.
So anyways,</v>

153
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:12.990
so nia has been falling asleep here at like nine o'clock,
10 o'clock at night.

154
00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:16.170
Cause you're still jetlag.
And I know,
I,
you know,

155
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.340
<v 3>I stay up late,
you know,</v>

156
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:21.460
what does she do last night when after I fell asleep,

157
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:28.270
<v 1>I sat outside on the chair and uh,</v>

158
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:33.470
I watched a bunch of Billy squire videos.
I don't know how I got into that,

159
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:38.660
but I was sipping a little Johnnie Walker black over there and I was thinking,

160
00:10:38.661 --> 00:10:40.850
I don't know,
I was just watching all these drum videos,

161
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.950
what's going down that little fucking rabbit hole there.
And um,

162
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.560
I was like,
I'm that guy that used to play

163
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:49.900
<v 4>okay</v>

164
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.810
<v 1>for Billy squire that Kinda had a bond,
a mask field,</v>

165
00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.610
and I couldn't remember his name.
And then I looked it up.

166
00:10:54.611 --> 00:10:57.970
So I have Bobby chew and art and he was from Brockton mass.

167
00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:03.550
And um,
it was,
she,
you know,
she just was a fucking monster player.

168
00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:09.100
I don't remember.
Um,
you know him,

169
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.010
she died really young.
He was only like 43,
I think he had like a heart attack.

170
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.620
So I just went to go put that,
you know,

171
00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:20.621
I wanted to listen to him play and then I just was watching this Billy squire

172
00:11:21.051 --> 00:11:25.010
shit,
like live in Detroit.
That guy was such a fucking rock star.

173
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.660
It's ridiculous.
Like I don't understand.
And everybody always talks.

174
00:11:29.661 --> 00:11:32.750
He made this one video and everybody always talks about like,

175
00:11:32.751 --> 00:11:34.130
do it ended his fucking career.

176
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.130
It was like that thing came out in the fucking eighties.

177
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.500
It was so in the eighties like

178
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.730
that,
nobody noticed most of the videos,

179
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:49.440
most of the videos from that time did not stand the test of time.

180
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.740
You know what I mean?
I,
but I hate when people try and go like,
oh,

181
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.000
like in the moment when that video came out,

182
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:57.610
everybody said to hell with Billy squire.
That's not what happened.

183
00:11:57.611 --> 00:12:00.940
He just didn't have any more hits after that.
Um,

184
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.280
but even like,
I actually read a quote,
Martha Quinn,
what's going on?

185
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.010
When that video came,
I don't remember an adverse reaction to what she goes.

186
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:11.800
I thought it was Kinda cute,
which is not what you want to say,

187
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.300
but basically now you look at,

188
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:17.730
he's got like this Pastel fucking shirt on and he's just sort of stomping around

189
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.480
fucking record this apartment.
It's really bad.

190
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.880
If that's the case though.

191
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.660
What do like most rock videos in the 80s be like ripped to shreds?
Oh my God.

192
00:12:27.661 --> 00:12:32.640
Yeah.
Well people,
yeah.
I don't know.
The horrible,
wait,
everybody does synchronize.

193
00:12:32.641 --> 00:12:36.510
Fucking dancing,
licking your base.
Fucking doing the,

194
00:12:36.511 --> 00:12:39.560
everybody doing that thing like they will fucking eating pussy.
They're not as,

195
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.540
yeah,
that's the thing.

196
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:45.900
Steve Vibe with this fucking double neck guitar and he's sitting there like

197
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:47.970
acting like he's fucking the guitar.

198
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:52.260
What's your funniest play in your favorite video from the 80s?

199
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.080
I have one.
Um,
it's money for nothing.
The animation?
No,

200
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:01.080
no,
no,
no,
but that's number two.

201
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.230
The first one is take on me by Aha.

202
00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.890
But they weren't a rock band where they more pop where they considered pop.
Yeah.

203
00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.840
Yeah.
Do,
do,
do,
do,
do,
do in any,

204
00:13:12.841 --> 00:13:15.790
in any Robert Palmer video with all the charity,

205
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.440
me take on me.

206
00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:21.770
<v 5>Me.</v>

207
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.460
<v 1>Oh,</v>

208
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.670
<v 6>oh God.</v>

209
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:35.010
<v 1>And any Robert Power radio with the like the half dozen shakes with the same</v>

210
00:13:35.901 --> 00:13:39.440
body type and the black slicked back hair.
The Red Lips,
the big titties.

211
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:44.090
I gotta be honest with you,
that video,
they,
those chicks did nothing for me.

212
00:13:44.091 --> 00:13:46.700
Everyone was like,
oh my God.
It was just so fucking white dude.

213
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.940
It's like six of them.
Did you stand in there?

214
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:53.180
I was just like supermodels and they like,

215
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.980
I just find none of them could play an instrument fucking freaked out.

216
00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:01.210
It was really funny how they all just fake plants.
Yeah.

217
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.650
They had this look on their face.

218
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.830
They hadn't got enough free drinks that night.

219
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:12.610
I told you I have made your fucking issues with women of that ilk.

220
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.090
I did just fucking just,
I respect them.
You're gorgeous.

221
00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.170
You know what I mean?
But just like the fucking them,
the most boring people ever.

222
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:26.330
The worst fucking interviews ever.
You get a fucking model just sitting there.

223
00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:31.000
They stay fucking stink.
They just look good.
It's just,

224
00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.020
just shut up.
We just want to look at you.

225
00:14:33.021 --> 00:14:37.370
You're like a fucking lamp that somebody wants to fuck.
But other than that,

226
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:42.030
you're useless.
You're fucking useless person.
So,
oh,
I,

227
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.020
I liked,
I liked the fucking who is,

228
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.840
I always liked the who is,
I like the flooding party girls.

229
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.300
All those checks.
Does the good looking girls do you like?
Yeah,

230
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:54.620
they look like they were fun.

231
00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:59.180
Like if you showed up with like a 12 or fucking Budweiser's,

232
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.870
they'd fucking drink some with you in.
Someone was going to get a blowjob.

233
00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:06.840
You watch the fucking Robert Palmer video.
It's like nobody's getting indexed.

234
00:15:06.841 --> 00:15:10.800
Dick sucked here.
These fucking chicks is so up their own asses.
They're just,
Eh,

235
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:14.850
eh.
They probably all hated each other.
Yeah.

236
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.280
They don't want to go to a dive bar with,
yeah.
Oh yeah.
That too classy for that.

237
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:21.890
Until uncle Terry takes their pictures and all of a sudden they're getting a

238
00:15:21.891 --> 00:15:25.170
three d look at a salt pepper.
Fucking pubes coming at him.

239
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.810
That fucking creep,
dude.

240
00:15:29.811 --> 00:15:33.650
Anytime you're of a certain age and you start telling younger women to call you

241
00:15:33.651 --> 00:15:38.110
uncle so and so and you're not fucking related to them,
that's a major,
you know,

242
00:15:38.111 --> 00:15:41.000
one reason why I know about him was because you were in the fashion world.
He's,

243
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:45.330
he's so disgusting.
Yeah.
Anytime he takes Jesus chain.
Terry.
Yes.

244
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:48.820
What has that played out?
I know that whole styles play out.

245
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.770
What's your theme for this one?
All right.

246
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:56.770
It's like you're drugged up,
but you really want to fuck this old guy.

247
00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.880
<v 3>Do you remember more went into that book shop and we saw like the books that he</v>

248
00:16:01.891 --> 00:16:05.740
published before he started getting all this fame for like taking a picture of

249
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.190
Jared Leto.
It's literally him with a d,

250
00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:13.050
His dick and some girl's face and him literally coming on a girl.

251
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.210
Like those were his whole books of them.
Those were his photographs at first.

252
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:17.580
<v 1>I,</v>

253
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:22.120
the only reason why I know the guy is the reason why I know who that guy is just

254
00:16:22.121 --> 00:16:26.670
because of you.
Yeah.
This is the peep.
Anybody?
Yeah.

255
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:31.710
Calls himself uncle is either a fucking pervert or they think everything that

256
00:16:32.981 --> 00:16:36.520
they say is fucking amazing.
Like Ted Nugent.

257
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.100
Just another tip from your uncle Ted.

258
00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.200
I got the whole world figured out.

259
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:44.690
<v 3>He's like,</v>

260
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:45.081
<v 1>he like,</v>

261
00:16:45.081 --> 00:16:48.590
he lives in like a tree fort and he shoots bears with arrows and then all of a

262
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:51.920
sudden then all of a sudden he knows how the world should work.

263
00:16:51.921 --> 00:16:54.890
I just don't understand.
You know,
isn't he like,
yeah,
he's like a big

264
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:59.290
<v 3>serving of a gun.
That.
Do you need some water?
What's going on over there?</v>

265
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.360
Now I'm fine.
All right.

266
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.910
<v 1>Clear my throat.
I pulled the fucking thing.
I me clear.
No tenure.</v>

267
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.940
I respect anybody that knows how to fucking hunt.
Anybody knows how to hunt.

268
00:17:10.941 --> 00:17:13.880
Everybody knows like guns and shit.
I think that's a really cool thing.

269
00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:15.023
<v 3>I feel like he's,</v>

270
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:19.320
does he ha he hunts for food or does he kill a bear to put it on his living room

271
00:17:19.321 --> 00:17:21.480
floor?
Both.

272
00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.080
<v 1>I have no idea.
You'd have to ask him why you hunch,</v>

273
00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:28.040
but I know he knows how to do it.
I think that's a cool thing.
And like,

274
00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:29.780
<v 3>uh,
you know,</v>

275
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.580
<v 1>and he's responsible gun owner.
He has a gun.</v>

276
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:36.340
He doesn't go around shooting people.
What'd you go into his house?

277
00:17:36.341 --> 00:17:41.020
She's going to blow your fucking head off.
I mean,
there you go.
Okay.
Yeah,

278
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.850
that's totally makes sense to me.

279
00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:48.060
But just because I agree with that doesn't mean I need to listen to you and your

280
00:17:48.251 --> 00:17:50.220
fucking fuck

281
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:50.980
<v 0>it.
Yeah.
Well,</v>

282
00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.940
honest to your thoughts about our foreign policy with fucking whatever you want

283
00:17:53.941 --> 00:17:56.760
to do,
but you can't deliver it in this fucking way.

284
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.840
That's another tip from your uncle bill.
Uncle.

285
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.810
I Dunno.
So anyways,
so I was,

286
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.230
I was on the Internet last night and I was looking at all this Billy squire

287
00:18:10.231 --> 00:18:12.480
stuff.
Billy Squire live in Detroit.

288
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:18.290
The fucking guy's guitar playing total front man is interaction with the crowd.

289
00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.391
I mean,
the guy was,

290
00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:24.590
she just was fucking murder in it and he had this great band and I ended up

291
00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.950
fucking went down this whole fucking thing.

292
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:32.690
I'm looking at Bobby chewing the ad and there's a book on him and stuff,

293
00:18:32.691 --> 00:18:36.950
which of course I ordered on Amazon.
It's like 20 bucks,
got the hat cover.

294
00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:41.240
And uh,
I remember I used to take drum lessons,

295
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.600
I can't remember the name of it,
but I used to take it in Brockton.

296
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:50.670
And um,
how long have you been taking drum lessons?

297
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:56.390
Well,
I took him for like three or four years in the early nineties.

298
00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.280
And then I didn't take him again,
right until,
uh,

299
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:05.140
last year.
Mm.
Oh No,
wait a little bit.
When I was in New York,
I used to go,

300
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:10.750
I had a couple teachers at a
um,

301
00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.010
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck was it called?

302
00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:20.520
The fuck is that place called when we were dating it?
No,

303
00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.790
before,
right now,
what app was I,

304
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.830
what happened was I started fucking plane and um,

305
00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:29.840
I know I played like three,
four years.

306
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:35.110
Then I started taking some lessons and then right around

307
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:42.640
that time I started doing standup and then stand up was the thing,

308
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:48.930
like it's the thing that stopped me from being a great drummer.

309
00:19:48.931 --> 00:19:51.570
Neil was time.

310
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.100
I didn't have the time and I didn't have the God given.
Right.

311
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.153
<v 4>Have</v>

312
00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:02.590
<v 0>I at the end of the big one,
I did not have the gift and I used to,</v>

313
00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:05.920
I thought if I just kept working,
working,
working at it,

314
00:20:05.921 --> 00:20:10.000
I would somehow work my way into having the gift.
Do you say to yourself,
wait,

315
00:20:10.001 --> 00:20:10.751
can I just ask you,

316
00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:15.751
do you see yourself in your seventies like doing comedy in Vegas somewhere and

317
00:20:17.861 --> 00:20:20.590
kind of doing like a don Rickles type of situation,

318
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:24.490
but then maybe you get behind the drums and sort of do like a musical comedy

319
00:20:24.491 --> 00:20:29.380
thing?
Oh God.
Oh God.
But it's charming because you're old.

320
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.610
It would be so pathetic.

321
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:36.833
<v 4>No,</v>

322
00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.120
<v 0>it will be all in music.
I listened to welcome to the job</v>

323
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.890
<v 4>and you're wearing like,
no,
no.
Let's see.
No,
no.</v>

324
00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.610
<v 0>Then have all the young hotties</v>

325
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:53.230
<v 4>singing going,
right.
Bill's got fun and games and then they'd come over.</v>

326
00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:57.580
Then they'd come over and they'd fucking pat my bald head.

327
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.240
Oh,
he's so adorable.
Um,

328
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:08.240
Nina,
I would kill myself.
I would jump off the welcome to Vegas sign.

329
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.020
I'm saying that now as a 48 year old,
who knows?

330
00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:16.021
I'm like moving into your seventies eighties doing like a month or so residency.

331
00:21:18.191 --> 00:21:22.840
We can move to Vegas for a couple months.
Yeah.
Just like the saddest scenario,

332
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.870
why they would pay you a good amount of money.

333
00:21:25.871 --> 00:21:30.700
Why is that you think going to be going on tour and your seventies you think you

334
00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:32.310
have me on the road like you are now?

335
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.530
I think I'm going to save my fucking money so I don't have to.

336
00:21:35.531 --> 00:21:38.320
I don't like the only reason I'll be on the fucking road in my seventies as it

337
00:21:38.321 --> 00:21:39.820
gets.
I want,
still want to be,

338
00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.510
but I still felt like I had something to say but that might be my fucking age

339
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.353
was like,

340
00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.480
I don't know what's up with these computers.

341
00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.300
I'll still be bitching about the same shit,
but you're going to,

342
00:21:52.301 --> 00:21:54.850
I know you you're going to still want to do comedy,

343
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:58.360
but you liked making people laugh.
I do it on a much smaller scale.

344
00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.321
I'm fine with that,

345
00:21:59.321 --> 00:22:03.410
but I'm not going to make a fucking ass and myself and have some Luau theme

346
00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.910
fucking comedy show.
Oh,

347
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.340
please tell me your drag me off stage.

348
00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:15.670
The day I show up and I'm in drag and I have like the coconuts over my fake

349
00:22:15.671 --> 00:22:18.790
taste,
Caesar's palace presents.

350
00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.780
Oh God,
that would be a nightmare.
No,
we can live in this.

351
00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:30.730
We can live in a suite at Caesar's for like two months.
And you do your,

352
00:22:30.731 --> 00:22:32.380
you know,
classic comedy.

353
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.900
It's telling jokes from 2020.

354
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.850
Well that's the thing.
You can't do classic comedy.
You can't go out.

355
00:22:42.851 --> 00:22:47.430
Like I saw Don Rickles and Tony Orlando opened up and he was playing,
uh,

356
00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.800
you know,
knock three times on this scene.
And I remember that fucking year.

357
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.430
You like psych,
you psych,
but like,

358
00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.850
no one's psyched to hear a joke again that the already hurt.

359
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:03.550
They just go away.
I can't be like,
yeah,
right.
I don't know if you remember this,

360
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.140
but there was a president long time ago,
he stuck a cigar,
the car,

361
00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:11.750
Monica Lewinsky.

362
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:18.810
And then you just start doing all that.
And then,
um,

363
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:23.620
then I do like a medley of styles.
That all influenced me.

364
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:30.700
I do the Eddie Murphy Laugh,
the Sam's Kinison yell the Seinfeld,

365
00:23:30.701 --> 00:23:35.540
Whoa.
You know,
as the band plays underneath it.
Yeah,

366
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:39.640
exactly.
You know,
comedy and music can a lot of similarities.

367
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:41.870
There's a rhythm isn't a journey.

368
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:47.440
Okay,

369
00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.630
<v 0>I'm wearing Hawaiian shirts because I'm crazy.
What's,</v>

370
00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:52.660
what's he going to say next?
Yeah.

371
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:55.710
But you're not going to want to just rest on your laurels.

372
00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:58.170
Even in your seven days,
you're going to still want to go out.

373
00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:02.250
So I'm just thinking about I'm going to rest on my ass.
That's white,

374
00:24:02.251 --> 00:24:06.400
like the moods rail,
but led the moves it out.
I would say rarely.
Um,

375
00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.510
<v 2>no,
I,</v>

376
00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.310
<v 1>I don't get the concept of retiring.
Like if you retire,
you're just,</v>

377
00:24:14.311 --> 00:24:17.460
then you're just,
I would feel useless and I would just be like,

378
00:24:17.461 --> 00:24:20.790
I'm going to die in about 10 days.
I would be one of those people.

379
00:24:20.791 --> 00:24:24.810
If I'm retired I would be dead in a week because I'd just be like,
it's over.

380
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:29.880
I'm useless.
Why am I still here?
And I would go into an unbelievable depression.

381
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.850
<v 7>That's what I mean.
I wouldn't die.</v>

382
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:36.680
But you have to work in a capacity in which someone wants to see a 70 year old

383
00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:37.523
comedian.

384
00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:42.090
<v 4>Okay.</v>

385
00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:45.660
<v 7>And the place where people would want to see and pay to see a 70 year old</v>

386
00:24:45.661 --> 00:24:50.190
comedian is Las Vegas,
let's be real.
Or You could have like,
you know,

387
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:54.180
of a few nights run at a theater in New York.
Maybe.

388
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:57.180
But it's not like you're going to be going to all the comedy clubs like you're

389
00:24:57.181 --> 00:24:58.014
doing now,

390
00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:03.220
<v 0>which is fine.
Um,
yeah,
I don't know.
I don't know.</v>

391
00:25:03.221 --> 00:25:06.970
All of that is really frightening.
I don't mean to frighten.
Yeah.

392
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:13.120
Wow.
It the end.
That's the end of your fucking life.
It's just the end.

393
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.170
Um,
I'll be there with you.
Don't worry.

394
00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:18.560
<v 4>Okay.</v>

395
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.200
<v 0>Yeah.
No,
I,
I picture my seventies and eighties.
Uh,</v>

396
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:28.750
I definitely am wearing slippers.
Potson around the house.

397
00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.980
Yeah.
Yeah.
And God willing,
you know,

398
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.960
the house is paid for.
I still have a nice car.

399
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.410
<v 2>All right,
Holly and I'm going to be like half.</v>

400
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.940
What do you think have does all day?

401
00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:49.220
He probably putters around the house and his slippers.

402
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.713
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

403
00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:52.780
<v 0>Did somebody buy that house?</v>

404
00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:56.080
<v 2>Somebody bought it and then that he was going to turn it,</v>

405
00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:01.140
but he wanted to turn it into something and so the deal didn't work out because

406
00:26:01.541 --> 00:26:04.420
I think the thing is you can buy it,
but have,

407
00:26:04.421 --> 00:26:07.150
has to live there until the end of his life.
Yeah,
that makes sense.

408
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:10.490
<v 0>That's what's going,
I don't know.
Yeah,
I think they did an article on that.</v>

409
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:14.990
You gotta,
you gotta buy his house for $100 million and it's a tear down,

410
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.980
which means he didn't keep it.
How do you not keep it up?
You know what?

411
00:26:18.981 --> 00:26:21.140
Once he was in the fucking magazine business,

412
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.590
he started in the 50s and who would've known that the Internet would come along

413
00:26:24.591 --> 00:26:27.590
and all these kids stop buying magazine,
all this free porn and all that,

414
00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.190
and it just went down the fucking drain.
That's the other thing to Nia.

415
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:36.850
The lucky thing that I have being a comedian is people always want to laugh.

416
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.930
I think that that's the reason why not only is it survived all of these new

417
00:26:41.931 --> 00:26:42.741
technologies,

418
00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:47.741
it actually thrives because you know what I mean?

419
00:26:47.871 --> 00:26:50.310
What's the,
what's the main shift that you watch on,
on the Internet?

420
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.710
You want to fucking laugh or jerk off to something?
Yeah.

421
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:56.470
<v 2>That's the two big things and yeah.</v>

422
00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:01.530
<v 0>Um,
comedy just,
it fits,
you know,
Joe can be really quick.</v>

423
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:06.030
Guy Walks into a bar.
He said,
Mama Blind.
The guy said,
well,
but blue it done.

424
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:10.380
You get the fucking laugh in these kids with their,
their,
their fucking squirrel,

425
00:27:10.381 --> 00:27:14.610
like intention spans.
It works.
So,
um,

426
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.890
I dunno how long ago or how long it works at this fucking level.

427
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:24.430
Uh,
but uh,
I dunno.
Yeah,
I'll,

428
00:27:24.431 --> 00:27:27.850
that shit is fucking scary to me so I just keep,
uh,

429
00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.880
just looking for my next special Nia and I got by the way,
I got it.

430
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.550
I got it worked out.
You do?
Yeah.
I know which ones I'm doing.

431
00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:41.580
I know which ones I'm leaving out anyone's that I feel are like going to even

432
00:27:42.341 --> 00:27:46.410
remotely be like considered,
uh,

433
00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.900
like done before,
you know,

434
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:53.830
as much as I liked the aborted landing bit that I've been doing,

435
00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.950
I'm not doing it because at the end of the day it's fucking airplane material

436
00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.650
and that'll just be one where I'll just like,

437
00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:03.250
I just have that one of my back pocket as far as like,

438
00:28:03.251 --> 00:28:05.830
if I'm just somewhere one night and I'm sick of my act,

439
00:28:05.831 --> 00:28:08.800
I'll just bust that one out again.
Although I feel like I told it and everything.

440
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.620
<v 2>You can bring it back Caesar's when you're 70.
There you go.</v>

441
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:17.720
It's a time with Joe.
Yeah.
Dying in a plane crush.

442
00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.420
<v 0>I've been at that one is just that one,
just a fun one to do.</v>

443
00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.870
And if fucking murderers,
everyone can relate to it and everything.

444
00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:29.200
But I just kept seeing it back of my head.
I just kept going like,

445
00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:34.750
you know,
this is,
this is just airplane material.

446
00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.280
And then one night I went to flappers,

447
00:28:36.281 --> 00:28:41.020
I'm not going to say who I saw him on stage and I was just,

448
00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:42.460
and he had us

449
00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:48.370
joke about an aborted landing and it,

450
00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:53.350
mine was different enough but it just hit the same points,
you know,

451
00:28:53.351 --> 00:28:56.110
the steward is not talking if fucking,
you know,

452
00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:01.510
what's going through your head and all that.
And it just was like,
and um,

453
00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:04.510
I was going to say something,
hey,
I Kinda got something like that.

454
00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:08.200
But that was just like
I said,
you know,

455
00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.810
online going to bother with that.
I'm just not going to do it.

456
00:29:10.811 --> 00:29:14.290
But on this past tour when I went through Europe,
you know,

457
00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:19.320
I broke it out probably 60% in the nights because it kills.

458
00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.450
And I was also trying to get comfortable.

459
00:29:22.451 --> 00:29:25.000
I just have to get a little comfortable over here to forget that I'm not in the

460
00:29:25.001 --> 00:29:27.100
United States.
Um,

461
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.670
<v 2>do you feel like a pretty effective of certain jokes?</v>

462
00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:35.530
Like with that one you were saying if someone had a similar premise that you're

463
00:29:35.531 --> 00:29:37.480
kind of more willing to let it go,

464
00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:41.530
but are there certain jokes that you just feel like,
you know,

465
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:46.680
you absolutely like no,
this is definitely going in the special knock.

466
00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:51.300
<v 0>Not Well,
not if I see somebody else doing something like I'm doing.</v>

467
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:56.790
Um,
no I wouldn't do that because then I'm thinking,

468
00:29:56.791 --> 00:30:01.520
well did they put theirs out yet or are they going to put theirs out?
And um,

469
00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.520
I dropped the joke is what I do.
Um,
yeah.

470
00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:09.450
<v 2>Even if maybe you came up with a for not saying that this is the case with the</v>

471
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:10.343
airplane one,

472
00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:15.740
but if you feel like if you hear somebody do something about Caitlyn Jenner or

473
00:30:15.871 --> 00:30:16.704
something like that.

474
00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.650
<v 0>Yeah.
Like even that one,
like as much as much fun as I've been having with that,</v>

475
00:30:20.651 --> 00:30:24.880
I don't think I'm doing that.
One of the Special,
Oh really?
Yeah.

476
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:25.930
Cause I got,

477
00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:30.370
cause I got this other chunk of shit that I can do that's along the same lines.

478
00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.080
Um,
now also I made fun of Caitlin when I was on Conan,

479
00:30:35.081 --> 00:30:39.220
so that's already out there.
And then I also feel like it's just Kinda,
uh,

480
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.560
it's done.
I just feel like that that subject is,

481
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.800
I just want them up there when I'm up there,
when I'm doing the bit,

482
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.410
as much fun as I'm out.
The Fun that I'm having is,

483
00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:54.250
is the crowd's reaction to what I'm saying.
But you know,
my heart of hearts,

484
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:55.930
I don't have any passion for it anymore.

485
00:30:55.931 --> 00:30:59.680
I don't give a shit and she's not in the news anymore.
Right.
I don't give a fuck.

486
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:03.010
That's true.
It's just that one period when,
you know,

487
00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:07.210
when they made that federal case about her fucking where she should pee and what

488
00:31:07.211 --> 00:31:10.810
building and,
and uh,
that was just,

489
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.590
it was just such a lay up as far as like,
you know,

490
00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.000
this is your fucking problem.
And like,
I don't know,

491
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.120
we'd just come back and Asian Shit.

492
00:31:19.121 --> 00:31:21.430
And just seeing what those people are going through.
And then you come here.

493
00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:26.440
<v 2>Yeah.
And this fucking millionaire Olympic star is,
I dunno,</v>

494
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.080
I know she doesn't have a show anymore.
They can't do the show.

495
00:31:29.081 --> 00:31:30.700
It's kind of like it's done,
you know?

496
00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:35.700
<v 4>Yeah,
that's true.
It's gotta be killing them</v>

497
00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:40.400
<v 2>to not have the show,
which is great for me if you're not interested,</v>

498
00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:44.960
if you're not interesting after you do something like that.
Well,
I mean,

499
00:31:44.961 --> 00:31:49.820
that's like,
it's like it was boring as Bruce and she's boring is like,

500
00:31:49.821 --> 00:31:53.060
it's just not,
there's nothing magical that happened.

501
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:57.890
Now that he's come out as transgender,
like there's nothing,
you know,

502
00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:02.900
she's still a Republican.
He's still living in Malibu.
Still Boring.
It's just not,

503
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:06.110
she looks great,
but that was the best part.

504
00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:11.030
I love the transgendered Republican.
Yeah.
I mean it's everybody getting mad.

505
00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.820
I love,
they thought if you've got some,
he got some titties.

506
00:32:13.821 --> 00:32:17.570
All of a sudden he'd be looking at the world differently.
She's exactly the same.

507
00:32:17.571 --> 00:32:19.450
She just looks different and she's got a three

508
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:25.970
and a great hairstyle and great makeup.
That's it.
But it's the same person.

509
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.060
Nobody watched keeping up with the Kardashians to see Bruce.

510
00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.260
I mean the guys had enough picking like he's obviously suffering here.

511
00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:38.020
I think Caitlin is fine actually.

512
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:39.860
I think he's just fine.

513
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:43.500
<v 0>Oh yeah,
she does just fine.
Yeah.</v>

514
00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:46.570
I think it gets a night.
Yeah.

515
00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.350
<v 1>Before Caitlyn goes to bed,</v>

516
00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:51.260
she puts on the Robert Palmer video and does those dances.

517
00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:56.320
<v 4>You know what I would actually love to see,
oh my God.</v>

518
00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.760
Oh my God.
Mom.
Photoshop and I'm Photoshop.
Please.

519
00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:03.710
Will you please make my God,

520
00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:10.880
please make Bill Robert Palmer and then a whole row of Caitlyn Jenner,

521
00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:17.620
my old,
my old biggest show in the background playing in Sir.

522
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:24.780
<v 1>Wow.
Right now.
Right.
I gotta do this.
I got to do some advertising.
Yeah.</v>

523
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:28.160
<v 0>All right.
Hey Nia,
have you heard,</v>

524
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.190
have you heard about MVMT watches?
No.

525
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:35.240
We'll look when you're in your twenties and thirties.
Money can be tight.

526
00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:40.210
<v 1>The,
if you're not careful,</v>

527
00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.530
dressing well can quickly drain your bank account and we spending four to $500

528
00:33:44.531 --> 00:33:47.430
on a department store watch.
Um,

529
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.320
there's some brands out there charging insane prices.

530
00:33:50.321 --> 00:33:54.400
Can you not make noise in the background of God?

531
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:56.620
This is a professional podcast happening here.

532
00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:01.300
There's some brands out there charging insane prices for watches that aren't

533
00:34:01.301 --> 00:34:04.990
even worth it.
Well,
if you want to look great when you go out,

534
00:34:04.991 --> 00:34:08.770
but still up money to buy him or her a drink,
checkout movement,

535
00:34:08.771 --> 00:34:11.140
watches.com what does that him or her or me,

536
00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:13.683
<v 0>what does that mean?</v>

537
00:34:13.930 --> 00:34:17.620
Cause are they trying to suggest that women actually buy drinks?
Yes,

538
00:34:17.621 --> 00:34:21.830
we do buy drinks.
When you're talking about now for men,
you're welcome.

539
00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.020
Hey sailor,

And it was like,

543

Can you just say that again?
Hey,

546
00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:46.870
Never heard anyone say that that was cheeto juice.
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice hey,

547
00:34:46.871 --> 00:34:47.704

But I do recall in our dating days before</v>

551
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:04.330
<v 1>we sound like a fucking politician.
I do recall an incident.</v>

552
00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.730
Do me a favor.
I love you.
Just walk away.
Fuck you.
There you go.

553
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:14.600
Right there.
Capitulation.
Fuck you had nothing to do with that argument is,

554
00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.730
Hey,
let me get this round.
Oh my God.

555
00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.900
I'm going to fantasize to that tonight.
All right,

556
00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:27.000
let's get back to the watch and syrup.
Checkout movement watches dot Tom.

557
00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:31.210
I'm originally founded by two broke college kids movement watches.

558
00:35:31.211 --> 00:35:35.860
Cut out the middle man and and their big brand retail markups in order to give

559
00:35:35.861 --> 00:35:37.000

568
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:11.670
Jesus.
I hate reading out loud to all his shave club.

Everybody.
Um,

backdoor.

572
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:28.980
If he could get a cool delivery guy and pays attention to the notes that you

573
00:36:28.981 --> 00:36:29.221
leave,

574
00:36:29.221 --> 00:36:33.390
could you leave it in the milk can around back right to your front door for a

575
00:36:33.391 --> 00:36:36.900

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.620
you get a first class shave when you use the executive blade and that's without

580
00:36:49.621 --> 00:36:50.454
hurting your wallet.

581
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:54.780
And when you use the executive with Dr Carver's,

582
00:36:54.781 --> 00:36:56.040
easy shave,

583
00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.930
the blade gently glides for the smoothest shave ever.
Um,

584
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.290
shea butter is in your average shave cream.

585
00:37:04.291 --> 00:37:07.230
It's a unique conditioning formula with high quality natural ingredients,

586
00:37:07.231 --> 00:37:11.130

All right.

594
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.840
Oh [inaudible] me,

595
00:37:39.841 --> 00:37:44.790

Bu Du,
Du,
Du,

596
00:37:44.791 --> 00:37:49.620
me,
undies,
me undies.
Try to show the world you got class.

597
00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:52.290
If you're in Italy and your dicks hanging out,

598
00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:56.250
wouldn't it be nice to not have people shout,
put it away.

599
00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.210
You're scaring the kids.
That's why you need me undies.
Oh yeah.

600
00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:04.230
It's like a bunch of velvet on your taint.
Alright me undies.

601
00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.840
Yeah,
but that fucking guy with the,
the fucking,

602
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.680
not only the Brazilian cut bathing suit,

603
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:18.710
he had the Brazilian flag on his fucking left butt cheek and he was just

604
00:38:18.901 --> 00:38:21.140
straightened back and forth when,

605
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:25.710
when we were in the little fucking claustrophobic fucking fishing village,

606
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:29.700
by the way.
Um,
it's like you just start,

607
00:38:29.701 --> 00:38:33.990
you just walk down this street and it just keeps getting smaller and smaller and

608
00:38:33.991 --> 00:38:38.860
smaller.
And,
uh,
anyway,
she finally opens up when you get down by the ocean.

609
00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:43.090
So we,
we went to,
uh,
this pizza place was sitting there and you know,

610
00:38:43.091 --> 00:38:45.940
people going by on the boardwalk.
How many times did that guy walked by?

611
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:52.420
At least five,
five fucking times back and forth,

612
00:38:52.421 --> 00:38:54.610
back and forth.
Then he found this woman,
I'm like,
oh,

613
00:38:54.611 --> 00:38:58.150
he was looking for her and then he came walking back two seconds later without

614
00:38:58.151 --> 00:38:59.710
her.
It was like,
what is this guy doing?

615
00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:03.940
He was strutting around like a Brazilian peacock because what he was this little

616
00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:05.860
fucking Freddie mercury underwear on,

617
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:11.680
hey,
Brazilian butt cheek.

618
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:16.580
But trying to aid a lot of Speedos,
you know,
we're,
we're in Italy is,

619
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.790
there's a lot of speed of bell that child,
all right,
where are we?
Okay,

620
00:39:21.791 --> 00:39:25.090
we're getting near whether you're wearing his suit or sweats or you have the

621
00:39:25.091 --> 00:39:30.091
Brazilian flag on your man ass spend almost 24 hours a day in your underwear.

622
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.550
But instead of making a statement like Superman's tights under his everyday

623
00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:38.340
closure on the worst probably boring me.
And he says here to change that,
uh,

624
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.900
every pair of undies.
Yeah.
How would you say this word?
[inaudible].

625
00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.560
<v 4>Hmm.
Modelle</v>

626
00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:49.850
<v 1>how else might you say modal?
Exactly.</v>

627
00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.330
That's been my fucking dilemma the entire time.
And then this is,
this is,
they go,

628
00:39:53.331 --> 00:39:56.030
it's,
it's pronounced [inaudible] and it's em,
they put it in quotes,

629
00:39:56.031 --> 00:39:59.360
Moh Dash d a l no doll.

630
00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:01.070
How do you know it's down?

631
00:40:01.071 --> 00:40:04.910
Not In moe dob because he's supposed to have that fucking accent.
Modal,

632
00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:09.620
modal.
What is the context?
I'm so confused.

633
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:13.250
Every pair of me undies is made from sustainable source,
modal,

634
00:40:13.251 --> 00:40:16.260
modal of fabric that's twice as soft as cotton.

635
00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.530
They don't fucking tell you how to pronounce it.

636
00:40:18.531 --> 00:40:21.740
I think they do a poor job of it and then they make this incredible fucking

637
00:40:21.741 --> 00:40:23.330
boast.
And for the life of me,

638
00:40:23.331 --> 00:40:26.540
I've gone on the Internet and I cannot find the studies that say that is twice

639
00:40:26.541 --> 00:40:29.190
the softest cotton.
Cotton's pretty soft.
And you know,

640
00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:33.680
it's like my belly right now.
Every pair of me on these is made of that shit.

641
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:37.100
Nothing can describe the fit and feel of me undies up against your under

642
00:40:37.101 --> 00:40:39.260
carriage.
But once you try mine,

643
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:42.560
you'll understand why they're called the world's most comfortable underwear.

644
00:40:42.561 --> 00:40:45.230
Underwear,
underwear.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

645
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:48.180
And if you don't love the first pair of me undies,
they're free you.

646
00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:51.920
No questions asked me.
And he says dozens of styles and limited edition prints.

647
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:57.080
Ma,
I gotta get this on the way to help make you make a statement with your

648
00:40:57.081 --> 00:40:59.930
underwear.
Uh,
all right,

<v 4>okay.</v>

655
00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:23.100
<v 1>I buy underwear like once every 10 years.
You know,</v>

656
00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:27.300
I don't understand and nobody sees it.
It doesn't wear out.

657
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
I'm not singled,
so I'm not trying to take my underwear off like half does.

658
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:37.700
Excite you.
You like the fireworks around my ball bag area?

659
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:42.590
I just have black,
gray or white.
Are you bored with my underwear?
Nia.

660
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:47.180
Your Lego God.
Same Old Dick wrapped in the same old package.

661
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:54.380
I need to get some me undies.
All right.
Score big Nia.

662
00:41:54.381 --> 00:41:54.771
You know what?

663
00:41:54.771 --> 00:41:58.750
You're paying too much for tickets between all the markups and last minutes.

664
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.850
Convenience charges.
What about those assholes?

665
00:42:01.851 --> 00:42:05.120
Somebody sent me a tweet so they bought tickets and there was like a $7 and they

666
00:42:05.121 --> 00:42:09.230
wrote a bill burr convenience charge.
So they put it on me.
Yeah.

667
00:42:09.231 --> 00:42:13.400
Why is it your fault?
No,
no,
no.
I told my agent they got to take,

668
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:16.850
don't fucking put my name on your fuck.
Overcharge.
I don't get any of that money.

669
00:42:16.851 --> 00:42:20.990
Yeah.
What's in also what's convenient about it?
There's nothing convenient.

670
00:42:20.991 --> 00:42:23.780
It's a fuck over and every fucking place you go to you.

671
00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:27.770
That's like when I was in Saint Louis and they charged me an occupancy tax for

672
00:42:27.771 --> 00:42:30.650
the hotel room I was in.
But don't they do that with every hotel?

673
00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.710
I don't think that's a new thing.
I hate that you just said that.

674
00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:38.900
Why but doesn't every rapist fucking yeah.

675
00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:43.700
KCC without asking for the same thing.
In my world it is all right.

676
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:44.580
Score big.

677
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:47.850
You're paying too much for tickets between all the markups and last minute

678
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:51.000
convenient charges.
Even printed home fees.

679
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:54.090
That was a question mark with an exclamation point.
That's why I went big.

680
00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.480
Then I was like what?
Did they have anything printed home?

681
00:42:59.000 --> 00:42:59.990
It's already in the paper.

682
00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:04.950
You end up paying court side prices for nosebleed seats.

683
00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:07.720
Score big is here to change that.
Did you know they need it?

684
00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:10.510
This is an incredible,
I still don't believe this.
Tell me,

685
00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:14.870
do you know that 40% of all live event tickets go unsold?

686
00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:20.810
40% near so like when Beyonce?
Yeah.
Is it Beyonce?

687
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:25.170
Beyonce,
Beyonce modal.
Hold out.

688
00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:30.080
It's it's fiance but whether it be okay just go easy non yet.

689
00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:33.920
You don't want the beehive coming at Ya fucking nerds.

690
00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:40.670
She would walk by all of you a second.
She'd be like,

691
00:43:40.671 --> 00:43:43.010
who is that bitch?
Why she backstage?

692
00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:47.330
Unless you paid into her fucking thing and then she'll pretend to like it.

693
00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.890
That's my gut instinct.
Um,

694
00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:53.450
did you know that 40% of all life event tickets going sold?

695
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:57.410
And did you know that there's a place to get these seats at huge savings?

696
00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:59.000
It's called ScoreBig.
Yeah.

697
00:43:59.001 --> 00:44:03.890
Like when they had the Superbowl knee of 40% of those tickets go on sale old.

698
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:06.290
Why?
Everybody wants to go.

699
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:11.150
Thank God this ScoreBig ScoreBig works directly with your favorite teams and

700
00:44:11.151 --> 00:44:14.110
artists.
Oh so they hold back 40% of these fucking chicken.

701
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.680
Really never want to have advertisers on this part.

702
00:44:16.681 --> 00:44:18.980

You fucking assholes.
Yeah.

704
00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.770
If you're going to go see the bgs cause there's only,

705
00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:32.010
there's only one left BG and Beyonce of this that

706
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.160
that's like the old dead fucking choke from Larry Sanders.

707
00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:40.260
I was going to say they should just call him BG now cause it's just one left.

708
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.071
And that was like,

709
00:44:41.071 --> 00:44:46.071
remember when Hank said that when Ashley Joe Wynonna Judd came on and he

710
00:44:46.561 --> 00:44:50.520
introduced her as the Judd cause she used to be in the Judds and he's like,

711
00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:55.420
she's had stay with a judge.
She's a judge.

who do you think's better?

732
00:46:10.131 --> 00:46:14.880
And he had lady Gaga.
Beyonce.
Madonna.

733
00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:16.380
<v 8>Okay.</v>

734
00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:19.800
<v 0>Or that,
that check you skilled,
cheeky,
cheeky,
whatever the fuck she do.</v>

735
00:46:19.801 --> 00:46:22.830
And then she played it.
She played the Flamenco Guitar.

736
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:30.450
Uh,
can I rank them as far as the CIO?
Who's Beth?

737
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:32.900
<v 1>Well,
isn't that what you're doing?</v>

738
00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:36.400
<v 0>Yeah.
You're talking about an ally of aspect.</v>

739
00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:40.340
I've only seen two of those four examples live to the CIC plane,

740
00:46:40.341 --> 00:46:43.630
the Flamenco guitarist.
Fucking unbelief.
Gyro is amazing.
All right,

741
00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:45.520
we love Johno Jan.

742
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.470
<v 1>Dot.
Medina please.
Guitar.</v>

743
00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:50.590
She's like wearing driving gloves so she's not even taking it seriously.

744
00:46:50.591 --> 00:46:55.360
So she's all right.
I never seen Madonna lab.

745
00:46:55.361 --> 00:47:00.130
I'd like to know lady Gaga was a meat dress while she's on a horse.

746
00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.110
It's a real horse.
Right.

747
00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:07.060
That's not what happened when people take their tits up now,
Beyonce,

748
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:13.720
Beyonce.
I've never seen him.

749
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:15.660
<v 0>Amazing.
Amazing.</v>

750
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:17.940
<v 1>She's going.</v>

751
00:47:17.941 --> 00:47:22.470
Time I see a live is when she falls down because the clip shows up on my youtube

752
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:27.030
when she's doing that thing,
she's whipping her head around my youtube,

753
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:30.820
whatever.
You go on the homepage and then it's just like,
oh well you watched,

754
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.840
you watched this slap fight is a frog kicking a fly in the face and then you're

755
00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:37.090
like,
oh,
watch that.

756
00:47:37.091 --> 00:47:41.740
And the next thing you know you watch in frog fly videos and then somehow it

757
00:47:41.741 --> 00:47:42.150
comes back.

758
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:45.430
It always ends up coming back around to when Beyonce fell down the stairs.

759
00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:46.420
That's how it works for me.

760
00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:47.753
<v 8>Hmm.</v>

761
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:55.290
<v 1>I haven't seen those other two and I think it'd be honest,</v>

762
00:47:55.291 --> 00:47:56.610
they definitely gave them better

763
00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.750
<v 8>concert then Gaga</v>

764
00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:03.620
<v 1>near Renee Hill.
Throwing shade,
I believe is what they say.</v>

765
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:08.540
That was not throwing shade.
We toss it,
toss the shade.

766
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.850
There is no shame in that statement.

767
00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:15.670
Did you sent put the shade down on the pillow?
Like a mint?
Um,

768
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:17.750
all right.
What else did I want to talk about?
Oh,
you know what?

769
00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:20.150
I'm obsessed with the car over here.
I'm in Italy.

770
00:48:20.151 --> 00:48:24.200
Near what car am I going to be obsessed by the Ferrari?
No,

771
00:48:24.201 --> 00:48:25.490
the Lamborghini now.
Yeah,

772
00:48:25.491 --> 00:48:30.491
that the fee at 500 cc pictures of everyone that you've seen but two cylinder

773
00:48:32.481 --> 00:48:34.970
fucking engine,
motorcycle engine basically.

774
00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:40.570
And a was considered a four passenger back in the day and they're just fucking

775
00:48:40.821 --> 00:48:43.940
most of the door.
I love those little cards.
I love smart cars.
Does it such cool?

776
00:48:43.941 --> 00:48:47.660
That's like when you were a little kid and you had a little fake gold card that

777
00:48:47.661 --> 00:48:49.070
your mom had a push you around and,

778
00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.640
but you know she was too sleepy because she was having a bunch of kids.

779
00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.100
Now here is why a smart,
the only,

780
00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.000
the only reason why is you saying all the obvious things people say about a

781
00:48:59.001 --> 00:48:59.441
smart card.

782
00:48:59.441 --> 00:49:03.770
The only reason I smart car stinks is because there's truck drivers texting.

783
00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:07.910
That's why it stinks because you know the car is already half mushed up.

784
00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:09.410
But as far as just like,

785
00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:10.790
<v 8>okay,</v>

786
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:13.220
<v 1>just a great guy,
just jumped in the fucking car.</v>

787
00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:16.370
You can park it anywhere where,

788
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:23.540
I dunno,
I like it.
I can appreciate a Ferrari.
All we done with smart car,

789
00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:24.260
you just,

790
00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:27.710
I just hate people who look at a smart car and they're just so like they compare

791
00:49:27.711 --> 00:49:32.100
it to like a fucking,
you know,
some sort of race car,
you know what I mean?
It's,

792
00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:33.970
it's like that's not what it's trying to deal.

793
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.240
<v 8>Right.
Okay.
I don't know.
Whatever.</v>

794
00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:42.270
<v 1>I like that car.
So I liked the little fee at 500 cc and what I learned,</v>

795
00:49:42.271 --> 00:49:45.590
I was on the old ones and you have to do this technique is called uh,

796
00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:49.770
a double clutch.
And I was sitting there,
I've never understood that.

797
00:49:49.771 --> 00:49:53.160
And I had to drive a truck one time on breaking bad and when I had to pull up in

798
00:49:53.161 --> 00:49:56.730
the dump truck and the guy was trying to show me how to do the double clutch

799
00:49:56.731 --> 00:49:57.540
thing,

800
00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:01.890
which is weird because when you want to up shift it's like you got to let the

801
00:50:01.891 --> 00:50:03.870
things slow down the,

802
00:50:03.871 --> 00:50:07.500
the rotations of the slow down and when you downshift,

803
00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:09.810
you actually got to hit the gas and have it speed up,

804
00:50:09.811 --> 00:50:13.500
which makes no fucking sense to me.
I would think it would be the opposite.

805
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.070
So it was fucking me up.
Safari go dude.

806
00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:20.390
Why aren't I just fucking leave it in gear?
All right.

807
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.480
I'll give it throttle and I let out the clutch and I'll just go.

808
00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:27.860
You just said finally said yes to that.
But ever since then like I had idea,
but I

809
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.851
<v 0>still have to tell you,</v>

810
00:50:28.851 --> 00:50:32.960
even just driving that dump truck and like first gear for like 10 feet into the

811
00:50:32.961 --> 00:50:35.360
shot was one of the coolest things I ever did.

812
00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:36.813
<v 8>Hmm.</v>

813
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:41.510
<v 0>Yeah.
That's like the little kid shit.
Like you have a big giant Tonka truck.
Um,</v>

814
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.050
didn't you also have to like stand on train tracks?

815
00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:51.430
I'm breaking bad or wait,
are you pretending to be a train conductor?

816
00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:57.520
Oh No,
the train.
Yeah.
No,
we robbed the train.
I had to stop the train.
So the,

817
00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:01.150
the other guys see,
uh,
I almost said Mr Pink,

818
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:06.360
Jesse Pinkman and Mr. White robbed it in the back.
Right,
right,
right.

819
00:51:06.361 --> 00:51:09.580
That's what it,
yes.
So the funniest part of that,

820
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:14.710
my most fun of that scene other than driving it was when they were just shooting

821
00:51:16.031 --> 00:51:19.420
me.
And I had to pretend there was a train coming at me and there was no train

822
00:51:19.421 --> 00:51:22.030
there.
And one of the conductors,

823
00:51:22.031 --> 00:51:25.180
one of the actors was just laughing his ass off because he knew I had to do the

824
00:51:25.181 --> 00:51:25.900
scene.

825
00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:28.420
And that's just one of the things that's going to be an entire crew of people

826
00:51:28.421 --> 00:51:32.290
watching you not saying anything and they go action.

827
00:51:32.291 --> 00:51:34.270
And you have to like in the middle of nowhere,

828
00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:39.180
stand on these train tracks and scream and yell and there's nobody fucking,
yeah.

829
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:40.333
Yeah.

830
00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:47.560
Great acting experience because it prepared me for more shit like that.

831
00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:51.880
Yeah.
Like so good on breaking bad.
You would have been good on breaking bad.

832
00:51:51.881 --> 00:51:52.714
It was the writing.

833
00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:55.690
Anybody would have been great on breaking bad the supposed to man.

834
00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:00.130
I mean like anybody who will be fucking good on it.
Yeah,
but you were like,

835
00:52:00.131 --> 00:52:04.510
you would be great on breaking bad.
I fucking did it.
A two episode

836
00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:07.840
<v 3>show.
One a Netflix series that's premiering next year.</v>

837
00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:13.110
May I point out I was being fucking modest when he told you you were great on

838
00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:17.920
Brinkmann.
Yeah I was wasn't I know you just say thank you.
Is it that hard?

839
00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:21.400
You are the worst thing of a compliments you because you literally just don't

840
00:52:21.401 --> 00:52:25.240
know what to do.
You can't just say thank you.
You're always like,
Hey,

841
00:52:25.241 --> 00:52:29.880
well what are you going to do?
I got lucky.
You get a spot.

842
00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:32.380
But it's the simplest response is thank you.

843
00:52:32.381 --> 00:52:34.960
And you just can't seem to wrap your mind around it.

844
00:52:34.961 --> 00:52:37.840
I've seen it happen so many times of people.
Oh my God,
you're amazing.

845
00:52:37.841 --> 00:52:42.280
You're like,
Hey,
well you know I just showed up to say thank you.

846
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:47.500
What's so hard?
Cause it's fucking weird.
Why is it weird to get a compliment?

847
00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:52.920
Oh,
Boston,
you know,
speaking of what you all fuck,

848
00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:57.150
I forgot who I ran into.
Who I fucking ran into,
right.

849
00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:59.930
<v 1>Oh,
so I fucking,
um,</v>

850
00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:04.360
in Belgium and I'm going up the stairs and of course my fucking,
uh,

851
00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:08.080
key doesn't work and to go on this big,
long fucking stupid fucking technology.

852
00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:11.410
Who the fuck is he speaking?
Fucking easy.
You mean we can see the key?

853
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:13.830
<v 3>Okay.</v>

854
00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:17.250
<v 1>Cell phone touches a key.
The key is to work in.</v>

855
00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:20.250
I was just being such a fucking baby and then it went down there and it turned

856
00:53:20.251 --> 00:53:24.270
out I had the wrong key because this other key was for something else in there.

857
00:53:24.271 --> 00:53:26.370
But then still it's like,
you know what the fuck?
You know,

858
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:30.260
just give me one fucking key assholes.
Right.

859
00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:33.070
So I turn around.

860
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.500
<v 4>Okay.</v>

861
00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:36.120
<v 1>And what man,
this fucking guy,</v>

862
00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:37.500
<v 4>okay.</v>

863
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:42.240
<v 1>Stands up.
He's got the eighties rock star fucking hair.
He's in great shape.</v>

864
00:53:42.241 --> 00:53:45.150
And I just looked at him and I go,
Holy Shit.
I just looked at him.
I go,

865
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:49.410
are you Tommy Aldridge?
And he goes,
yeah.
And I was just like,

866
00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:54.330
and I literally yelled,
I was like,
I had a normal voice.

867
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:58.660
I go,
you told me all do.
And he goes,
yeah.
And then I just go,
no way

868
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:06.850
in the fucking loving.
I don't know when,
dude,

869
00:54:06.851 --> 00:54:09.610
I got all your DVDs.
I was trying to say,
I still have,

870
00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:14.300
I actually have his drum instructional,
uh,
uh,

871
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:18.080
uh,
fucking I have it on VHS tape.
I ever,

872
00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:21.210
I bet for the VC area,
um,

873
00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:25.810
I could see it in his face.
He was just going,
oh no,
this person's crazy.

874
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.900
How am I going to get out of this?
And I just stuck my hand up.
I just say,

875
00:54:29.901 --> 00:54:33.730
hey man,
thanks for [inaudible].
I said,
uh,
just,
I just said,

876
00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:38.230
thanks for all your great drama over the years and as he's walking away and just

877
00:54:38.231 --> 00:54:42.970
said thanks.
That's what just reminded me of that.
Yeah.
Simple.
Thank you.

878
00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:47.290
Give him a moment.
Yeah.
So it was actually,
I want to say,
I mean,

879
00:54:47.291 --> 00:54:51.430
I'm prejudice here.
I think it was a good fan interaction with them.
Yeah.
For him.

880
00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:55.900
I didn't ask him for an autograph.
I just shook his hand.
Right.

881
00:54:56.290 --> 00:55:00.370
Plus who flips out when they see a drummer.
Other drummers.

882
00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:04.240
Right.
Okay.
We'll just get played with fucking Ozzie.

883
00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:06.110
<v 4>Uh Huh.</v>

884
00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:08.730
<v 1>Played and Whitesnake he played like every fucking band that I listened to</v>

885
00:55:08.731 --> 00:55:12.040
coming up.
Whitesnake I always like,
what was their big head?

886
00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:17.590
Are they uh,
everybody liked?
Here I go again.
Yes.
No,

887
00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:19.650
<v 8>no,
haven't,
no.</v>

888
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:25.760
<v 1>Um,
that's how he sings it now.
When you went down,
it's ever no nick,</v>

889
00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:29.080
if he goes never known.
What was that?

890
00:55:29.081 --> 00:55:31.900
What was that song of or watching VH one classic

891
00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:34.013
<v 8>Ben.</v>

892
00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:37.153
<v 1>Keep going.</v>

893
00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:39.573
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

894
00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:45.380
<v 1>You killed a will cause that's the way he does it.
That was</v>

895
00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.820
I,
no,
Oh,

896
00:55:52.821 --> 00:55:55.740
you look so much emotion in that was queens,
right?

897
00:55:57.750 --> 00:56:01.620
Queens,
right.
Queens,
right.
Yeah.
I don't know what,
there wasn't there.

898
00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:05.370
There was like,
right,
like art,
I like the third,
right.

899
00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:09.150
I think more like middle earth,
they were more like,
oh,
I don't know.

900
00:56:09.151 --> 00:56:11.400
I don't fucking know and understand science fiction,

901
00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:15.570
but I do know that it was like two types of heavy metal bands.
There was,

902
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:18.630
there was like the people who were just like,
hey man,

903
00:56:18.631 --> 00:56:22.770
like let's get some booze and fucks some strippers.
Right?
Like Motley Crue,

904
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:24.003
there was

905
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:26.520
<v 0>a poison and all of those guys.
Not saying that,</v>

906
00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:27.580
I'm not lumping them all together.

907
00:56:27.581 --> 00:56:29.850
I'm just saying there was the party fucking bans.

908
00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:35.530
And then there was the,
the ones that were more like in the issues.

909
00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:40.900
Do you know what I mean?
Both.
Like,
you know,
your noble,

910
00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:48.760
Noble.
I was trying to think as,
I'm trying to think of something that,

911
00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:52.830
who saying somebody's
death?

912
00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:58.240
That was def Leppard.
Yeah.
That was def Leppard when they became a pop band.

913
00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:01.630
<v 4>Since she's mad shit.</v>

914
00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:04.700
<v 0>Uh,
that was,
uh,</v>

915
00:57:04.701 --> 00:57:08.150
there wasn't a lot of the white bands that was not white snake.

916
00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:12.540
It was no national.
You mean there wasn't Whitesnake.

917
00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:14.840
It wasn't white blinds.
Oh,
that wasn't,
what,
what the fuck

918
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:17.770
<v 4>was there a name?
She's mad.
She,
Amy.</v>

919
00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:23.680
<v 1>Oh,
it was a w Warren Warren.
Yeah.
But on my belt,</v>

920
00:57:23.681 --> 00:57:26.830
those were the WWE bands.
And then was,
there was Warren that was winger

921
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:29.290
<v 0>and there was a</v>

922
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.110
<v 1>blow.
Those were all the white pants,
white snake,
white lion,
great white.</v>

923
00:57:36.550 --> 00:57:40.030
It always happens.
It's like in the 60s there was the Beatles,
the animals,

924
00:57:40.031 --> 00:57:43.600
the fucking rascals.
Everything became the,
the,
the,
the,
some,

925
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:48.010
the monkeys whose all animal names and then the early two thousands,

926
00:57:48.011 --> 00:57:52.770
it was all numbers,
right?
Late nineties,
matchbox 23.
Mary,

927
00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:54.241
<v 0>wait,</v>

928
00:57:54.241 --> 00:57:59.241
so the monk to have buy land where they are supported by a satirize Beatles.

929
00:57:59.490 --> 00:58:03.310
What was the deal with the monkeys?
They were like a manufactured band.
Right?

930
00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:06.180
But were they meant to be

931
00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:10.110
<v 4>face and I'm a believer.</v>

932
00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:14.450
He's bad man,
man.

933
00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:15.443
<v 0>Amen.</v>

934
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:18.000
<v 4>Ah,</v>

935
00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:23.270
<v 0>all right.
This is becoming like a slumber party when</v>

936
00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:29.270
not everybody's on vacation right now.
So this is not going to be cute for long.

937
00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:32.440
Alright,
here we go.
All right,
let me,
uh,
let's read some questions.

938
00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:36.100
Let's get back to the real world where people ask a,

939
00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:39.950
an illiterate comedian for life advice.
Alright,

940
00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:45.340
Rodriguez.
Hey Bill,
I listened to your podcast and we'd like your opinion,

941
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:48.820
which I assume you will hit anyways regarding him.

942
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:53.740
He's like the cheating husband that happens to make too much for that client to

943
00:58:53.741 --> 00:58:58.660
leave him.
Why if he it.
Um,

944
00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:02.390
and he's just trying to be funny.
Yeah,
it's,
it's an expression.
It's a,

945
00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.530
it's a term of endearment.
It's a term of endearment.
I see.

946
00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:09.550
Not We're not in fucking England or they just,
I don't know if Allison,

947
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:13.450
I don't know if Alex Rodriguez for tired then I just seen his name keep popping

948
00:59:13.451 --> 00:59:16.420
up.
I don't know what happened.
I don't know.
Being a red sox fan,

949
00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:17.830
I'm wondering what your opinion is.

950
00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:21.980
I'm not a big baseball fan so I could give two fucks.
So you don't care.
You just

951
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.280
<v 1>want my opinion.
But Kirby pocket wasn't such a con,</v>

952
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:29.290
aside from supposedly raping some chicken arrested.
What are you doing here?
Ah,

953
00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:32.780
yeah,
he was and still is loved and adored in the twin cities.

954
00:59:32.781 --> 00:59:37.781
Explain the difference and get your ass here as soon as possible so I can bring

955
00:59:37.881 --> 00:59:40.130
someone to see you.
I look forward.
Thank you.
Well,

956
00:59:40.131 --> 00:59:42.410
let me see if Alex Rodrigues retired.

957
00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:44.733
<v 0>What?</v>

958
00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.130
<v 1>I really don't have any opinion on a rock.</v>

959
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:49.940
After 2004 once the red sox won the world series,

960
00:59:49.941 --> 00:59:53.780
I don't give a shit about the Yankees.
So was the end of the movie.

961
00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:57.380
It's the end of the fucking movie.
Whenever they have 27 championships,

962
00:59:57.381 --> 00:59:58.280
we're never going to catch him.

963
00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.550
But they can't rub it in our face that we haven't won one.

964
01:00:00.551 --> 01:00:03.380
We won the fucking three.
It's,
it's,
it's over.
You know what I mean?

965
01:00:03.381 --> 01:00:05.000
It was like back to the future.
They should have stopped.

966
01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:06.530
But the first one they just kept going.

967
01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:10.040
Then all of a sudden was the 18 hundreds they made two and three at the same

968
01:00:10.041 --> 01:00:10.874
time.

969
01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:15.360
<v 3>He and Derek Jeter,
I always get confused.
They're both Yankee is right.</v>

970
01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.660
They're both really handsome and they date famous girls.

971
01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.230
<v 0>MMM,
right.</v>

972
01:00:21.490 --> 01:00:26.310
<v 1>Well,
personally I always like Tina.
Oh,
it's another fucking project.</v>

973
01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.570
Both really handsome.
He,
what are you talking about over?
Yeah.

974
01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:32.580
<v 3>All right,
Alex.
A rod.
Yeah,
he's good looking.
And then Derek Jeter,</v>

975
01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:36.390
they're both like Rodriguez,
obviously like Latino.

976
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:41.010
Derek Jeter is like biracial or something.
They're both like any colored.

977
01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.160
Right.
And you're

978
01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.950
<v 1>ruining both of these people for a lot of men right now.
All right.</v>

979
01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.530
What is my opinion on the guy

980
01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:52.730
<v 3>as one of them dated Mariah?
Or</v>

981
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:55.920
<v 1>let's just move onto the next question.
Oh,
all right.
What?</v>

982
01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:01.270
I don't understand what it lets you parked.
Yes.
And would like your opinion,

983
01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:06.250
which I assume I feel like he's a not comfortable in his own skin and he doesn't

984
01:01:06.251 --> 01:01:09.400
know what to say.
And now that,
that Derek Jeter,

985
01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:13.840
the guy who was totally comfortable in his own skin and never fucked up is gone.

986
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:16.720
I think he could just sort of fucking chill out and I'm happy for him.

987
01:01:16.721 --> 01:01:17.920
You can just kind of fucking,

988
01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.640
<v 0>you know,
just VA right.</v>

989
01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:25.160
<v 1>Whenever.
I hope he has a good season.
Not when he plays the Red Sox,
but you know,</v>

990
01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:29.120
I don't give up.
It's over.
We won the world series.
Go Fuck Yourself.

991
01:01:29.121 --> 01:01:32.950
We ran the tape.
I'm familiar.
I'm a happy sportster.
All right.
Connor Mcgee.

992
01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:37.810
<v 3>I know he's not Scottish.
Stop treating me</v>

993
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.960
<v 1>Billy blood.
Uh,
did you hear Mcgregor talking shit about John [inaudible].</v>

994
01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.270
He went on,
he went on a rant.

995
01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:49.860
About how we respects the old WWF but doesn't give a shit about the new guys

996
01:01:49.861 --> 01:01:53.970
because they're all sissies.
He calls Siena a 40 year old grandmother.

997
01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:58.670
<v 3>What universe is a 40 year old grandmother?
I'm in a 40 year old.</v>

998
01:01:58.671 --> 01:02:01.300
Could be a grandmother,
but Jesus,
how old is coming?

999
01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:05.500
<v 1>Oh,
what's great.
As key.
Such a bad ass.
And he can actually say that about a guy.</v>

1000
01:02:05.501 --> 01:02:08.830
He's big as John Senior who I imagine it has a wrestling background.

1001
01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:13.330
Some of these guys that get into the WWF actually like,

1002
01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:16.840
like Ken per terror I remember was like he won an Olympic gold medal for

1003
01:02:16.841 --> 01:02:21.120
wrestling.
Um,
a of them like at the collegiate level.

1004
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:24.600
Like we're champions so they actually know what the fuck they're doing.

1005
01:02:24.601 --> 01:02:28.410
So their ground game was pretty good,
I would think,
you know.
Anyways,
he says,

1006
01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:32.910
I'm sure Mcgregor could take punches better,
but seeing it as much stronger.

1007
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:38.170
Uh,
who do you think would win and do you think Mcgregor is a Douche bag?

1008
01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:42.090
Have you talked to Joe Rogan about this?
Joe Rogan has a busy man.

1009
01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:47.330
I haven't talked to him about what you think about Johnson.
Go on.

1010
01:02:47.331 --> 01:02:48.164
I'm like,
good guy.

1011
01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:51.500
<v 3>Josie and I was in movies and commercials now anyway.</v>

1012
01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:55.810
He's not even like in reality shows like he's not even like actively fighting.

1013
01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:59.050
<v 1>Please just so say he's,
he's honey colored.
Just just don't say that again.</v>

1014
01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:02.570
<v 3>All right.
He's not so I wouldn't mix</v>

1015
01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.710
<v 1>and it shouldn't you like go down to the pool or something.
Oh,</v>

1016
01:03:08.711 --> 01:03:10.360
now you want to kick me out of the box?
Yeah.

1017
01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.810
Cause you turning everything into like,
uh,

1018
01:03:12.850 --> 01:03:16.330
look what's happening now with the gay guy in the fucking old broads with the

1019
01:03:16.331 --> 01:03:20.000
boat.
Talk to their face.
What's the name of that show?

1020
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:25.420
I don't know.
Hi,
I'm,

1021
01:03:25.421 --> 01:03:29.270
I'm fucking,
I'm trying,

1022
01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:32.680
I'm dressed like I'm from the south and I'm going to make these fucking Jersey

1023
01:03:32.681 --> 01:03:33.990
broads getting mad at each other.

1024
01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:35.290
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1025
01:03:35.290 --> 01:03:39.310
<v 1>Are you talking about Andy Cohen?
They go watch what happens live.
Yeah,
you'd go,</v>

1026
01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:43.000
okay,
look,
look what these bitches are yelling about now.

1027
01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:50.400
He just stirs him up.
He does.
He does.
He's like Captain Lou Albano.

1028
01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:55.770
Um,
he calls seen a 40 year old that the one with the rubber bands on his beard.

1029
01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:59.760
Yeah.
Rest in peace.
But it wasn't the Cindy lopper his video.

1030
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:04.020
He played her dad and the girls just wanna have one video.

1031
01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:09.890
Sorry.
Need a hell everybody.
Hey,
thanks for coming by the podcast.

1032
01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.580
I'll see you all right.
I'm done.
No,
you're not get out,
but isn't that question

1033
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.890
<v 3>I could answer that.
The next one.
I'll be quiet for the rest of the segment.</v>

1034
01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:21.000
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1035
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.400
<v 1>All right.
So what do I think about it?</v>

1036
01:04:22.401 --> 01:04:26.390
I think he's just being Conor McGregor and that's why you fucking love the guy

1037
01:04:26.391 --> 01:04:28.280
who sells fights.
He's fucking hilarious.

1038
01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.270
Colon John's seen a 40 year old grandmothers hilarious that I imagine he'll say

1039
01:04:32.271 --> 01:04:36.680
something funny back and it'll be great.
You know,
I don't know.

1040
01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:40.580
No one,
Conor Mcgregor,
I don't think he plans out.
What the fuck he says.

1041
01:04:40.581 --> 01:04:44.630
I just think he goes up there and he goes off like a comedian that's in the
zone.

1042
01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:49.220
I think he's fucking hilarious.
Um,
now and now I've got to go find that.
Uh,

1043
01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:54.170
I got to go find that clip.
All right.
Can Women go to bachelor parties?
Oh God.

1044
01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:58.790
What?
What is this going to become a thing?

1045
01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:05.400
All right.
Hey Billy blue balls.
I'd like your advice on a disagreement.

1046
01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:06.600
My best friend and I are having,

1047
01:05:06.601 --> 01:05:09.120
he's getting married next fall and we are very close.

1048
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:13.510
We've been great friends since college and we are so close to that.

1049
01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.680
So close that him and his fiance just asked me to officiate their wedding.

1050
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:21.250
The disagreement is about whether I should be able to go to his bachelor party

1051
01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:24.580
in Vegas.
I'm a woman,
but because he's my best friend,

1052
01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:28.810
I think I should be able to go.
He wants to bachelor party to be men only.

1053
01:05:28.811 --> 01:05:32.230
And I understand this to to a point but at the same time,

1054
01:05:32.231 --> 01:05:36.630
but virtue of how close we are,
I think I should be able to go,
uh,

1055
01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.600
my friend and I are big friends of your podcasts and have agreed that if you

1056
01:05:40.601 --> 01:05:43.360
read this on air,
whatever your advice is,
we'll take it.

1057
01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.550
So if you don't think that I,

1058
01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:49.150
the best female friend should be going to the bachelor party.
We agree to it.

1059
01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:54.280
Love the podcast.
Oh,
become to Boston soon.
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
Um,

1060
01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:59.320
no you shouldn't because I thought first I thought this was a guy going to be

1061
01:05:59.321 --> 01:06:04.321
bitching about his male friend that wanted to bring a woman along.

1062
01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.390
And the first thing I was going to say,
it would be like,
I don't agree with that,

1063
01:06:07.391 --> 01:06:11.290
but at the end of the day,
it's this person's bachelor party.
It's their wedding.

1064
01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:15.340
So you just gotta you know,
I would just shut up about it,

1065
01:06:15.341 --> 01:06:18.850
but I would break his balls for the rest of time.
Like this is my best friend.

1066
01:06:18.970 --> 01:06:23.260
He had a woman at his bachelor party.
No,
it wasn't a stripper.

1067
01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:27.680
So I would give the same advice here.
Um,

1068
01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:32.440
this is not your bachelor party and this is not a time for you to throw a hissy

1069
01:06:32.441 --> 01:06:37.300
fit and ruin this thing for him.
He has a bachelor party the way he wants.

1070
01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:41.170
I think it's really cool that you guys are best friends and that you're going to

1071
01:06:41.171 --> 01:06:45.370
see is,
I think it's enough of an honor that he,
he's going to let you speak,

1072
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
you know,
as his best man.
I mean that's pretty fucking amazing.

1073
01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:52.720
Officiate whatever.
Oh,
you're going to do the vials?
Yeah.
Okay.

1074
01:06:52.721 --> 01:06:56.020
She's going to officiate the ones.
Oh,
all right.
Yeah,
there you go.
That's huge.

1075
01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:57.200
And you go,
there you go.
Yeah,

1076
01:06:57.270 --> 01:07:01.310
<v 3>so,
and I,
I was,
do you care what I think only if you agree with me,</v>

1077
01:07:01.490 --> 01:07:03.900
I agree with you and that's why this relationship works.

1078
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:05.440
I totally agree with you.
Okay.

1079
01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.290
My wife and I can understand why she'd want to go because it's like,
Hey,

1080
01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:10.830
I'm your friend.
I want to go.
But like,

1081
01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:14.120
<v 1>just say what you say.
Don't stir her fucking brain up again.
All right.</v>

1082
01:07:14.121 --> 01:07:14.990
You shouldn't go.

1083
01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:17.080
<v 3>Yes.</v>

1084
01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:21.580
Respect your best friend wishes and Naco cause he's going to want to do some

1085
01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.073
shit.

1086
01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:25.780
<v 1>Hey.
Yeah,
you don't,
you don't that you don't get extra credit.</v>

1087
01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:28.350
You don't get extra credit for saying,
I already said,

1088
01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:33.540
all right.
Every once in a while to meet and I just,
all right,

1089
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:37.190
my wife is a Gremlin.
Hey Billy Bongos,

1090
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:42.110
my wife of just over a year.
It was adorable and everybody loves her most days.

1091
01:07:42.111 --> 01:07:44.210
She is a hardworking,
levelheaded human.

1092
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:48.470
I consider myself to have similar characteristics in though and through hard

1093
01:07:48.471 --> 01:07:51.620
work have become quite successful because of this success.

1094
01:07:51.621 --> 01:07:54.710
We have a 40 to become somewhat of a socialite couple.

1095
01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:57.950
We attend several parties and events on a monthly basis.

1096
01:07:58.410 --> 01:08:00.470
This all sounds like the beginning of Boogie Nights,
doesn't it?

1097
01:08:00.471 --> 01:08:03.380
And then she starts doing below next to now she's getting banged in the
driveway.

1098
01:08:03.381 --> 01:08:04.880
He's just sitting there going,
what the fuck's going on?

1099
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:06.860
<v 3>That's nothing like Buddy Matt.
Oh,</v>

1100
01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:15.440
<v 1>I don't know.
That's what I'm picturing because there were a socialite couple,</v>

1101
01:08:15.441 --> 01:08:19.570
then they're going to get into the cocaine couple thing.
Oh,

1102
01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.060
I think I see what you're doing with this.
All right.

1103
01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:25.970
So we attend several parties and events on a monthly basis.

1104
01:08:25.971 --> 01:08:28.700
Normally all goes well and we go to bed happy and peaceful.

1105
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.800
But every now and then my adorable wife turns evil.
Um,

1106
01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.620
I already pictured her,
her catching him,
looking at the fucking hottie.

1107
01:08:37.621 --> 01:08:38.930
So you go to a social light party,

1108
01:08:38.931 --> 01:08:43.550
you're testing the limits of your fucking relationship.
That's when he said he,

1109
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.770
they did a bad,
bad thing,
right?

1110
01:08:45.771 --> 01:08:50.180
You stuck in all those fucking eyes wide shut party.
That's what you're doing.

1111
01:08:50.650 --> 01:08:51.890
Yeah.
All of those fucking people,

1112
01:08:51.891 --> 01:08:55.730
they look at women that like objects and shit and it's just like they give her

1113
01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:58.760
the old flicker,
the eyebrow,
meaning you want to fuck mine and I'll fuck yours.

1114
01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:02.090
I've never been to one of these parties,
but that's,
that's what I think.

1115
01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:06.640
That's what I think goes down.
All right.
You want to fuck man,
I'll fuck yours.

1116
01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.500
Well,

1117
01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:13.040
we both just watch them go down on each other as we discussed stocks.

1118
01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.010
All right.

1119
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:22.670
Normally all goes well and we go to bed happy and peaceful.

1120
01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:25.100
But every now and then my adorable wife turns evil.

1121
01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:28.520
It's a little like the movie gremlins.
I've narrowed it down.

1122
01:09:28.521 --> 01:09:31.340
If she's boozed hungry and tired after midnight,

1123
01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:35.540
she turns into a class a cunt.
She,

1124
01:09:35.541 --> 01:09:39.350
she's mean to me.
But what is it worth is she says,

1125
01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.690
evil thinks about others.
To me,

1126
01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:46.520
the result is I am the only person that gets to see and hear this Gremlin and

1127
01:09:46.521 --> 01:09:48.380
action and it makes me crazy.

1128
01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:53.300
It makes me want to buy her a pair of cement shoes and a boat.
Kidding.
I think.

1129
01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:56.180
Okay.
I'm an m so what do I do?

1130
01:09:56.750 --> 01:10:00.200
We have talked about it several times the next day with level head,

1131
01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:05.330
but Gizmo continues to turn from time to time.
Do I start caring Bruno?

1132
01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:08.810
I was just going to say I don't,
I have a sandwich in my back pocket.

1133
01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:15.800
Do I start carrying granola bars and a five hour energies and my pockets like,

1134
01:10:15.821 --> 01:10:17.210
Eh,
what does that work?

1135
01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:17.990
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1136
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:20.630
<v 1>Like an Epi pen.
Uh,
what is that?</v>

1137
01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:25.850
That's where people who have allergies or nut allergies or do I cut off for

1138
01:10:25.851 --> 01:10:29.330
booze and General?
The lovely Nia you have any,
any input?

1139
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:30.230
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1140
01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:34.040
<v 1>Uh,
bring your a game to gains fill until then go fuck yourself.</v>

1141
01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:39.660
<v 2>Uh,
all right.</v>

1142
01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:44.930
<v 1>Sorry.
It's just reading that last little bit he had there.
Um,
what would I do?</v>

1143
01:10:44.931 --> 01:10:48.470
I Dunno.
I would,
yeah.

1144
01:10:48.471 --> 01:10:52.430
I think I would just start bringing snacks and I would start,

1145
01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:56.900
I would start calling her the Gremlin.
I,
what's the word you use or just,
yeah,

1146
01:10:56.901 --> 01:11:00.200
just,
just when she starts getting into that social,
just being like,

1147
01:11:00.201 --> 01:11:04.580
Hey Gizmo to take it down a notch.
Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.

1148
01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:08.540
I would literally feed her like a rabid dog.

1149
01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.490
You don't if they have a rabid dog ever came running out,
you know,

1150
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:13.900
cause that's what you supposed to do.
He's supposed to throw raw steak at him.

1151
01:11:13.901 --> 01:11:17.190
Right.
Is that we spoke last night as I have a rustic on you at all times.

1152
01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:21.360
That's a black guy.
If you get a black guy,
you put a rustic I,
you said Black Guy

1153
01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:25.060
<v 8>as oh put black guy.</v>

1154
01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:29.620
<v 1>The black guy comes at you.
You just throw a rustic.</v>

1155
01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:38.920
Ah,
wouldn't it be great if everybody,

1156
01:11:38.921 --> 01:11:42.070
if everybody wasn't meat eaters and they liked it rare,

1157
01:11:42.071 --> 01:11:45.040
then you wouldn't have to cook it and you just walk around and I'm going to the

1158
01:11:45.041 --> 01:11:48.970
store and you just had stakes with you.
If there was any fucking problems,

1159
01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:51.880
sir,
would you like to sign up for this cell phone?

1160
01:11:51.881 --> 01:11:55.070
He just fucking throw it out and I found this.
They were just runaway costs.

1161
01:11:55.071 --> 01:11:58.120
You too much money though.
All right.
I thought there was some comedy there.

1162
01:11:58.121 --> 01:11:58.790
There wasn't.

1163
01:11:58.790 --> 01:12:03.130
You can't cut off her booze unless you just decided to not go to these events

1164
01:12:03.131 --> 01:12:07.690
with her and we'll make sure you guys have a nice dinner before you go out.

1165
01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:11.020
I would just break her balls the entire time over there and be like,

1166
01:12:11.021 --> 01:12:14.080
so what do you think?
What do you think when do turned into Gizmo tonight?

1167
01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:18.230
Around 1130 or 1145 absolutely.
Gizmo Gizmo.

1168
01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:21.610
Look at you going crazy.
Your teeth are all pointing now.

1169
01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:24.610
What's going on with you?
All right,
one more.
This is becoming long here.

1170
01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:28.200
How long has it now our 12 here we go.
Alright,

1171
01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:29.860
move back to east coast bill.

1172
01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:34.890
As your success continues and you become even more financially stable and set

1173
01:12:35.141 --> 01:12:38.440
for the longterm,
that is an impossibility.

1174
01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:43.390
I don't understand how you get financially cause at the end of the day,

1175
01:12:43.391 --> 01:12:46.000
even if you just take all your money and you stick it in a bank,

1176
01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:49.910
what those cons do is at some point they play a little fucking fucking,

1177
01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.130
they loan everything out.

1178
01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:54.700
I will never forget just watching people with their life savings in there

1179
01:12:54.701 --> 01:12:57.730
standing outside the bank and that's just a pad lock on it.

1180
01:12:57.731 --> 01:13:01.750
So there's really no place that you can put it.
Every place you put it,

1181
01:13:01.751 --> 01:13:05.350
someone's going to put their fucking hands on it.
You know what I mean?

1182
01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:09.250
You stick it in the stock market,
they start investing it.
They just like,

1183
01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.010
it's so fucked up.
They won't just let you have your money.

1184
01:13:12.011 --> 01:13:16.330
The only way to do it is if you fucking just cashed your check every week and

1185
01:13:16.331 --> 01:13:20.350
you stuck it in the wall and then you got to worry like,
did I leave the iron on?

1186
01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:24.700
Every time you leave or someone gets winded.
That's what you'd do it.

1187
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:28.930
And then you got to have the shotgun bed.
You've ever seen the shotgun bed?
No.

1188
01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:32.830
It's the greatest fucking bed in the world.
If you live alone,

1189
01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:37.390
it's basically,
it's the,
the,
the headboard.

1190
01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:41.170
You bring your hands back like this.
As you touch it,

1191
01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:46.060
the thing flips around like a secret door and a loaded shotgun comes down in

1192
01:13:46.061 --> 01:13:49.720
your hand.
That's a real thing.
Yeah.
That's also made from a movie.

1193
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:53.680
It's the fucking shit.
But it's the thing,
whenever they show the demonstration,

1194
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:57.760
the persons in the bed by themselves.
Okay.
Because when it comes down,

1195
01:13:57.790 --> 01:14:02.650
the fucking barrel is going to be pointing at your wife at her head.
Yeah.

1196
01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:06.420
That sounds dangerous.
Well what she gotta do?
What?

1197
01:14:06.421 --> 01:14:08.500
You got to sleep on the side of the bed.

1198
01:14:09.370 --> 01:14:11.290
If you're a left handed shot her right shot.

1199
01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:14.610
You got to sit on the side of the bed.
Where if in your view panic,

1200
01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:16.973
you know what I mean?

1201
01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.610
Like if you woke up in the middle of the night and you looked over and there was

1202
01:14:20.611 --> 01:14:24.470
just this figure standing there and the door,
like that horror movie,
you know,

1203
01:14:24.471 --> 01:14:24.811
in the late,

1204
01:14:24.811 --> 01:14:28.240
and then she turns the lights on and then she turns it off and then it's there.

1205
01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:29.920
Then she turns it on,

1206
01:14:29.921 --> 01:14:33.160
she turns it off and it moved up like 10 feet and it's like,

1207
01:14:33.161 --> 01:14:37.330
bitch lead the fucking lights on a trailer because that's exactly what I think.

1208
01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:39.910
Why do you keep flicking it on?
Maybe cause you're like,

1209
01:14:39.911 --> 01:14:44.370
am I seeing what I'm really seeing when it moves up though?
That is the ship.

1210
01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:48.730
It's scary,
but I can't,
I can't deal with that.
You know,
something I hate,

1211
01:14:48.731 --> 01:14:51.760
people don't buy into horror movies.
I always buy it.
I'm like,
all right,
I get it.

1212
01:14:51.761 --> 01:14:56.170
Yeah.
She's flipping the lights on.
Never happen.
Real life.
Yeah.

1213
01:14:57.310 --> 01:15:01.890
Um,
anyways,
uh,
the only way I could see that you're,

1214
01:15:01.891 --> 01:15:05.140
you're financially fucking set as you buy a house and you fucking pay it off.

1215
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:08.160
All right.
You know,
the rest of this thing.
Okay.

1216
01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:13.860
You had any thoughts about what point you would have to get to before you move

1217
01:15:15.101 --> 01:15:16.390
back to the east coast?

1218
01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:22.020
I know that Nia may not be fond of this and you may not be thinking about it

1219
01:15:22.021 --> 01:15:24.470
either,
but it seems like you would be happier backing.

1220
01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:28.260
But who the fuck is this idiot?
You don't know me?
Yeah,
you don't know me.

1221
01:15:28.261 --> 01:15:30.750
You don't know why I like Boston new,
et cetera.

1222
01:15:30.751 --> 01:15:33.900
I'm from Pittsburgh originally and lived in Chicago for a few years and now I'm

1223
01:15:33.901 --> 01:15:37.440
in Washington DC area,
so I never lived on the west coast,

1224
01:15:37.441 --> 01:15:40.980
but have visited numerous times.
You can't beat the weather in la,

1225
01:15:40.981 --> 01:15:43.380
but you can't beat the culture of the east coast.

1226
01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:46.710
We'd love to hear your thoughts and thank you for keeping us all entertained.

1227
01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:49.840
No complaining about La a lot.
No,
not at all.

1228
01:15:49.841 --> 01:15:54.841
I love the thing that you'd be happier back in Boston because people,

1229
01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.400
I get one by the time I'd read the rest of it,
I get it.

1230
01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:00.820
He's just looking at the world through his own eyes.
Um,

1231
01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:06.130
I dunno,
I,
I sometimes I think about moving back east,

1232
01:16:06.131 --> 01:16:10.030
but I mean I'm doing f is for family.
The show business is out there.

1233
01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:15.010
Um,
and this fucking great people in La.
This is great food.

1234
01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.800
There's all this great stuff to do out there.
A lot of people,

1235
01:16:17.801 --> 01:16:20.740
shit on La Cause when they move out there,
you know,

1236
01:16:20.741 --> 01:16:23.770
they try to make it in show business and they don't get,

1237
01:16:23.771 --> 01:16:26.380
they don't get anywhere and they'd pack it in and they leave.

1238
01:16:26.770 --> 01:16:29.860
All they really met was a bunch of other desperate people that didn't get

1239
01:16:29.861 --> 01:16:33.820
anywhere.
And it can give you a really bad feeling about La.

1240
01:16:33.821 --> 01:16:38.800
I've had that experience too.
The first time I went out there,
um,
you know,

1241
01:16:38.801 --> 01:16:41.800
I was like full killed.
All the real people are on the east coast.

1242
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:46.510
I started having that eye,
that attitude.
But you know,
when you go out there,

1243
01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:48.010
when you break through,
like,

1244
01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:53.430
and you start meeting people like someone like really most talented,

1245
01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:59.470
generous,
cool fucking people I've met have been when I've been out there.
And,
uh,

1246
01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:04.120
you know,
I mean,
nine times out of 10 if you meet somebody legendary,

1247
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:09.590
you quickly realize why they were fucking legend.
And that's because of,

1248
01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:13.290
uh,
their,
their attitude.
Like they,

1249
01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:18.320
they've made all this money that really super successful and they're still like

1250
01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:22.700
genuinely interested in new things and don't feel it.

1251
01:17:22.701 --> 01:17:26.660
They know everything and that type of shit.
And UHM,
I dunno,

1252
01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:31.560
you can't beat the fucking houses out there are awesome.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Yeah.

1253
01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:35.040
You've never once complained about living in la.
If anything you're like,

1254
01:17:35.041 --> 01:17:39.660
I love it out here.
I love it out here.
And I also love New York.
I love New York,

1255
01:17:39.661 --> 01:17:44.000
but like,
yeah,
uh,
you know,
if I was having to move back to New York,

1256
01:17:44.001 --> 01:17:47.720
I mean at this point I'd have to live in a house.
Like once you live in a house,

1257
01:17:47.721 --> 01:17:49.700
you can't go back to living in a fucking apartment.

1258
01:17:50.110 --> 01:17:54.980
I traipsing up and down the fucking stairs and,
and just living in New York,

1259
01:17:54.981 --> 01:17:55.940
you have no car.

1260
01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:59.840
You just like this prisoner of the neighborhood and you just sitting there dying

1261
01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:03.830
for new restaurants to open up.
Just,
I just remember that.

1262
01:18:03.831 --> 01:18:07.850
And then you've got this little ass fucking kitchen and you're,
you're watching.

1263
01:18:07.851 --> 01:18:11.780
Like I used to watch molto Mario and I'm like,
I'm going to buy one of those.

1264
01:18:11.781 --> 01:18:12.850
I want to buy one of those.
And then I,

1265
01:18:12.851 --> 01:18:17.240
I had no place to put it and all these pots and pans stacked up.
I can't do it.

1266
01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:20.480
New York City's for young people,
you know?
And if you don't believe me,

1267
01:18:20.481 --> 01:18:23.480
look at the older people that live there and look at their postures and shit.

1268
01:18:23.481 --> 01:18:27.200
Like,
I don't know,
I love New York,
but I couldn't go.

1269
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:32.120
I don't know that I'd want to live there again.
Not In the city at least.

1270
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:35.990
Yeah.
I just,
I,
I feel like that part of my life is all,
yeah,

1271
01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:40.180
it was fun in my twenties yeah.
I roller bladed on all those avenues,

1272
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:43.660
but a fear,
if we ever went back,
I would,
I would get up,

1273
01:18:43.690 --> 01:18:48.400
I'd get a house and I just drive into the city.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like in Bitch,

1274
01:18:48.401 --> 01:18:51.860
Moan and complain about the fucking traffic.
Exactly.
I was like,

1275
01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:56.400
you live in the suburbs in Westchester or whatever.
I wouldn't mind that.

1276
01:18:57.770 --> 01:18:59.620
Yeah.
I mean,
it's a possibility by me,
you know,

1277
01:18:59.690 --> 01:19:02.270
I kind of feel like I'm going to do this cartoon and I'm going to be ready to

1278
01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:06.960
just be like,
all right,
if this thing goes like,
you know,
seven,
eight seasons.

1279
01:19:07.530 --> 01:19:11.100
That's it.
What else?
What else more do you need to do?

1280
01:19:11.770 --> 01:19:15.670
I went out to la.
I got a TV show.
We did it for eight seasons.
People liked it.

1281
01:19:15.671 --> 01:19:20.490
I made people laugh and then what I would do the Seinfeld.
Yes.
Do the same.
Yeah.

1282
01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:25.240
Then I do my fucking,
my,
my drum solo.

1283
01:19:25.241 --> 01:19:29.860
A fucking comedy show.
Right.
All right.
Thank you guys for listening.

1284
