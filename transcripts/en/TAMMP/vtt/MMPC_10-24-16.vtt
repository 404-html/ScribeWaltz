00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.100
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.500
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,
October 24

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.820
2016 Oh,
we're getting down to it.
Ah,

4
00:00:12.821 --> 00:00:16.800
those little kids are going to be coming by for the candy,
right?
Oh,

5
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:21.360
those cute little kids see up cute until they're about seven and then they start

6
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:24.480
thinking they know shit.
Right.
And then they fucking start showing up.

7
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:28.470
I swear to God,
you know,
if they're almost eye level,
you know,

8
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:31.160
you ought to be able to just get the fuck outta here.
Go Buy your own guy.

9
00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:35.640
Didn't get enough.
Get a fucking paper route.
You bump right.
The first hour,

10
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:39.120
hour and a half of Halloween is great.
The kids are so fucking cute.

11
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:41.600
The parents are all excited.
It's really what it is.

12
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.780
Like the cutoff for fucking Halloween should be roughly about eight years old

13
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:49.260
and then everybody else should just go fuck off.
Go put your fucking,
you know,

14
00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:53.100
but your virtual reality glasses on and get,
go shoot a bunch of people.

15
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.070
Whatever it is.
These,
these,
these,
these kids do now a days,

16
00:00:56.071 --> 00:01:00.270
I don't pretend to understand.
You know,
I understand they can't go outside.

17
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.320
You can't put,
send them outside because you know there's,

18
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.020
there's a pervert behind every fucking tree evidently.
So don't,

19
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.990
don't have 'em outside.
Have him inside,

20
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.490
put on some virtual reality glasses and let them just walk around in this world,

21
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.850
you know,
just shooting up people where they're nice and safe.

22
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.780
<v 0>Right.
Um,</v>

23
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.710
<v 1>I dunno,
I was just reading this,</v>

24
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:26.070
there was this psychology magazine that I picked up,
um,

25
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.190
during this fucking unbelievable ride back I had from Nashville and it was all

26
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:36.750
about a narcissism and that type of stuff and just how easily that word is

27
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:39.240
thrown around now,
how everybody,
you know,

28
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.270
who isn't a psychologist and myself included somehow that word like hit the

29
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.283
mainstream,

30
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.773
<v 0>I don't know when</v>

31
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.870
<v 1>it's been around my whole life.</v>

32
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:51.770
I think the article said sometime in the early seventies,
and then every bow,

33
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.370
this person's no narcissist,

34
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.540
narcissistic Blahblahblahblahblah and I guess it actually true narcissists,

35
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.950
it only affects a really small portion of the,
of,
uh,
the population.

36
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:04.260
And they would just talking about,
there's different kinds of it.

37
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.360
Like everybody thinks it's the person taking a selfie.

38
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:11.070
It isn't necessarily that person.
Some,
it could be a total fucking narcissist,

39
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:14.190
but like goes the other way.
And uh,

40
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:17.340
it was really like depressed and withdrawn and all that.
And basically,
uh,

41
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.100
their pain and all of that becomes their narcissism.

42
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:21.550
Just fucking sitting around talking about,
oh,

43
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.210
I don't know how miserable they are.
I have no fucking idea.

44
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.010
All I know is I read it and I was just going,
yeah,
I do that.
Oh,
I do that too.

45
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.070
That's what I remember.
I breached shit on fucking Psychos,

46
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.570
narcissist fucking lunatics,
whatever the hell it is.

47
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.720
You know,
it's like,
it's,
you know what it's like,

48
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:42.480
it's like reading a fucking horoscope.
I swear to God.
You know,

49
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.950
when you sit there,
and I've always maintained people who are into astrology.

50
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.380
You always go,
you believe in that shit.
I believe in that shit.

51
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:51.850
And if you've got the fucking paper,
just say,
well,
when you're bored,

52
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.640
I was born on May,
may the sixth.
Oh,
you're a fucking a,
you're a Taurus.

53
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.100
Right?
And then go read the fucking Gemini or

54
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.940
<v 2>the Sagittarius.
Oh,
the fucking Blue Bonnet bowl.</v>

55
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:05.440
Whatever the fuck sign they are.

56
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.650
You just read that one instead and you watched him devoloped all the,
I know it.

57
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.580
I know exactly.
Yeah.

58
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.010
<v 3>Did need the back burner.
Yeah,
that was</v>

59
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.750
<v 2>timber.
So you know it's people like,</v>

60
00:03:17.751 --> 00:03:20.270
why can't you just send me believe what I want to believe.

61
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.320
So I'm actually recording this Sunday night.

62
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.010
I was going to record it tomorrow morning,
but my lovely,
beautiful,

63
00:03:28.011 --> 00:03:30.200
gorgeous wife is upstairs and do you know what she still,

64
00:03:30.201 --> 00:03:34.190
when she's watching the reality fucking shows and I sit there,

65
00:03:34.191 --> 00:03:38.150
I try to hang in there.
I fucking try to hang in there.
I can't fucking do it.

66
00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:41.270
It's,
it's like,
it's so fucking depressing.

67
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.890
I don't understand how she and Michael Rappaport can watch that fucking shit.

68
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.740
It's just,
it's,
it's fucking,
she's watching one right now.

69
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.610
All they do,
they just sit around talking about stuff,

70
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.370
bags and shoes.

71
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.790
And this one wants Teddy's because her sister's got bigger titties.

72
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:04.150
I wish I had tits like you until they get sick.
These are like,

73
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.390
<v 0>yeah,</v>

74
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.920
<v 2>they stay,
don't do anything.</v>

75
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.950
And then there are always going on vacation to clear their head from doing

76
00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:12.830
nothing,

77
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.390
I guess being on the show and haven't been in front of the cameras and stuff.

78
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.820
Yeah,
I guess that would get fucking annoying after awhile.

79
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.800
But they don't fucking do anything.

80
00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:25.580
And then there's this guy with a beard and he comes walking in and he's always

81
00:04:25.581 --> 00:04:27.910
acting like he's fucking got all these businesses going.

82
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.640
He's not fucking doing anything either.
I can,
they do the shelf.

83
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.670
That's what the fuck they do.
And uh,

84
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.730
so I'm hanging in there and I'm trying to watch,

85
00:04:37.731 --> 00:04:39.350
I'm trying to watch and then they do that horror.

86
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.940
Like you watched them talk about the shit and then they cut to the people who

87
00:04:43.941 --> 00:04:46.850
you just saw talking about the shit.
Then they talk about the,

88
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.250
they just talk about what they just did.

89
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.733
<v 0>So</v>

90
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.990
<v 2>the one on one wants to get a fucking boob job.</v>

91
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.400
<v 0>Okay.</v>

92
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.370
<v 2>And they,
they probably just had her do it,
you know,</v>

93
00:04:58.371 --> 00:05:00.170
just so they can get a fucking episode out of it.

94
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.020
All I know is been the end when she goes to talk about it.

95
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.730
This is what I tapped out after listening to these fucking people sitting around

96
00:05:07.731 --> 00:05:11.680
talking about themselves,
you know,

97
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:16.681
and just walking around with these fucking $10,000 worth of clothes to walk into

98
00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:22.330
a fucking living room and sit down and talk about other clothes.
Right?

99
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.020
They cut to the one who was going to get a titties done and she sits down in the

100
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:29.290
first,
soon as she comes out of her mouth,
she just goes for me.

101
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.020
And I was just like,
I'm a,
I get to get the fuck outta here.

102
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.660
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
I can't like,
what do you mean for me?

103
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:39.960
We just listened to you talk about it.
Like they should just want it.

104
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.510
They should just go down to a fucking soup kitchen,
go late,

105
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:45.780
allowed some shit for a while.
I don't know the names,

106
00:05:45.781 --> 00:05:48.010
just talk about how fucking,
um,
we still on

107
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.790
<v 3>making Camino,
all the different people and is it,
they're just like really,</v>

108
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.620
really poor.
And I just,
just,

109
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.040
<v 2>it just,
I just,
for me,</v>

110
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.410
<v 4>it was just so great to connect with you</v>

111
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.810
<v 1>float.</v>

112
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.710
And they would be doing that in full on fucking makeup with love bracelets going

113
00:06:05.711 --> 00:06:09.610
all the way up to their fucking Goddamn neck.

114
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.770
And I don't know,
just after helping people like that,

115
00:06:14.771 --> 00:06:19.771
I just really feel like I need to clear my head and go to San Louis Obispo,

116
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.010
whatever the fuck

117
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.750
<v 2>those goddamn people go.
Jesus Christ.
I just,
uh,</v>

118
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.860
I don't know why she watches it.
Why does she watch it?
She likes grape movies.

119
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:34.730
She's a very smart pride.
I don't know,
I guess,
you know,
for me,

120
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:38.780
I guess I watched fucking football,
you know,
that's just as fucking stupid.

121
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:40.730
I watched people sitting there talking about,
I guess,

122
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.200
I guess that's the female version of it and I have to accept that's the fucking

123
00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:47.870
fact.
And that,
um,

124
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.760
we are staying in this fucking house right now and,
uh,
you know what's,
you know,

125
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:53.571
what's going on with this house.

126
00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:57.170
We thought this fucking creepy ass house was haunted.
All right.

127
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.070
We looked at it during the day,
during the day.
Look great at night.

128
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.700
It feels like there's somebody fucking watching you and you're hearing all these

129
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:08.030
weird sounds and everything.
And uh,
you know,
I kind of figured out,

130
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.950
we kind of figured out what it is.
There's a,

131
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.810
there's rodents in the walls of this place,
like a lot of old houses.

132
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:18.920
If you have an old fucking house,
um,
you know,
there's inroads there like,

133
00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:21.200
you know,
if you lived in buffalo and you bought an old house,

134
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:25.910
would it really surprise you if there was some prohibition error tunnel

135
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.400
underneath your fucking house?
I mean,
you know,

136
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:30.770
the Capone fucking characters were there,
you know,

137
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:32.420
right across the river was Canada.

138
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:36.290
They bring the fucking booze and allowed here you got all these fucking old ass

139
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:39.890
houses,
mine included,
which by the way,

140
00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:42.020
I just went over there to see what the fuck they were

141
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.180
<v 1>and trying to rewire the thing so I won't blow up my house someday.</v>

142
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.290
And they told me they were done with the wiring and I was all excited and I

143
00:07:52.291 --> 00:07:57.240
gloated that there was no more fucking cloth wiring and the Goddamn House.

144
00:07:57.241 --> 00:08:01.050
And I went on and I look at me now,
I'm talking about my stuff.
Um,

145
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:06.870
I go to turn the fucking light on,
turn the light on,

146
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.550
and they go,
what do you call it?
The fucking lights that are on the wall.

147
00:08:11.551 --> 00:08:14.610
They're not under the ceiling,
right.
Whatever the fuck you call it.

148
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:19.590
It's fucking sitting there.
Right.
And I turned on the light and it just go,

149
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:24.650
I see this spark just go like right up the side and landed on the dog bed and I

150
00:08:26.341 --> 00:08:30.960
just shut it off.
I was like,
hi,
I'm going to bring that up tomorrow.
But,
uh,
no.

151
00:08:30.961 --> 00:08:33.720
I got in there and they got the floor and now they're starting to build the

152
00:08:33.721 --> 00:08:38.270
cabinet.
So I'm seeing the fucking light at the end of the tunnel here.
So,
uh,

153
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.770
<v 2>you know,
I'll tell you the cloth wiring never did that,</v>

154
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.570
but once we get this done,
then the fucking houses,
it's done.
It's fucking done.

155
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.080
And I can just live there quietly and just,
you know,

156
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.740
stare at the fucking wall and know that there's no more squirrels there,

157
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.310
like this fucking place.
I don't know what the fuck are in the walls.

158
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:01.590
I told him that story I told you a few weeks ago about,

159
00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:04.890
I was over at a buddy's house and there was a mouse in the house that was this

160
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:07.110
house.
And the reason why I said it was a friend of mine's house,

161
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.730
because I didn't want to tell my wife that there was a fucking rodent in the

162
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:15.780
goddamn house because then she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd have to deal

163
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:18.990
with that shit.
All right.
Um,

164
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.910
but my father in law was over.
It was three leaks.

165
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:27.630
Weeks later we had a couple of beers.
It was a funny story and I just find,

166
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:29.010
just said,
you know,
I,
you know,

167
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.770
my wife brought up that it was haunted and I finally just said,
no,
honey,

168
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.530
it's not on it.
There's fucking rodents.

169
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.800
<v 5>Okay.</v>

170
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.610
<v 2>And,
and in,
in the walls,</v>

171
00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:42.230
I just heard one came walking by and I heard a bunch of shit fall down the

172
00:09:42.231 --> 00:09:45.680
plaster.
And I know that's what it is because when I was a kid,

173
00:09:45.681 --> 00:09:47.300
we had that problem in our house.

174
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.560
And I remember we had these squirrels were in the fucking walls.

175
00:09:51.561 --> 00:09:55.640
I don't know how they got in there,
but they were fucking in there.
And uh,

176
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.190
so we somehow cornered one.

177
00:09:59.390 --> 00:09:59.840
<v 5>Okay.</v>

178
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.920
<v 2>It was behind the cabinets and there was like a whole,
like not buying the kit,</v>

179
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.200
like it was in the wall behind the cabinet.

180
00:10:06.201 --> 00:10:10.760
So all I remember was I had like this mop handle and I'm fucking,
you know,

181
00:10:10.761 --> 00:10:14.660
Randall in it in the hall is my dad had this,

182
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:19.690
do you know the fucking giant butcher knife trying to find this fucking thing

183
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.070
and uh,

184
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:23.330
<v 5>okay,</v>

185
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.970
<v 2>he's fucking jabbing the knife and the whole,</v>

186
00:10:25.971 --> 00:10:28.820
and I got the fucking mob panel go and try to flush this thing out.

187
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.620
All the sudden this fucking thing,

188
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.980
like a rocket runs out of the hole right up to the fucking mop,

189
00:10:36.441 --> 00:10:41.390
handle up my arm,
jumps on my shoulder and just leaps off.

190
00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:44.150
And I do,
I was just like,
dude,
the fucking thing.

191
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.950
And it had nowhere to go and my dad cornered it and he finished the fucking

192
00:10:48.951 --> 00:10:51.860
thing off.
You know,
that's,
it was,
this is before Peter,
you know,

193
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.680
now I guess we would have been,
you know,

194
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.960
accused of some sort of hate crime against a squirrels.

195
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:02.560
I have no idea of when my dad finished the fucking thing off and um,

196
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.400
you know,
we dealt with that.
There was bats in the fucking anything.
You know,

197
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.850
when there was an old house,
the house was older than the house then,

198
00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.930
well I guess it was made earlier.
I don't think it was older.

199
00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:16.780
It was like seven years old.
Mines fucking 90.
Anyways,
these old fucking houses,

200
00:11:16.781 --> 00:11:21.780
it's just,
you're going to have guests.
All right.
I'm not a big ghost guide.

201
00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:24.510
Like I,
I always think it's Rodin's first and I don't know,

202
00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.240
these fucking things are all over the God damn place.
So,
um,

203
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:30.790
I dunno,
I,
you know,

204
00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:34.660
at least I can say that about my fucking piece of shit of a house,
you know,

205
00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.630
at least what I don't have,
I don't have squirrels in the walls,
you know,

206
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.790
I mean you,
you turn the fucking light on.
I mean,

207
00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:44.230
I'm not saying a spark won't come out and singe off half your fucking mustache

208
00:11:44.231 --> 00:11:47.530
at this point,
but you know,
if you know it did.
So it's a process.

209
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:52.810
That's what it is.
All right.
So anyways,
as you guys might,

210
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:57.260
I was taping a standup special,
uh,
on Friday at the Ryman and,
uh,

211
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.160
I did it,
it went great.
Uh,

212
00:12:00.161 --> 00:12:04.360
now I have the horrible thing where I have to go back and look at myself.
Uh,

213
00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:08.740
which is not something I,
I dunno,
it's the weirdest thing.
Like if I,

214
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:12.220
if I just take a set and I'm just going to watch it,
I can look at it,

215
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:17.080
but if I know that this is going to go onto Netflix and that the general public,

216
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:18.670
if they want to,
can look at it,
then just,

217
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.130
then every fucking thing that I hate about myself,

218
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:22.960
it's just like sticking out like a sore thumb.

219
00:12:22.961 --> 00:12:27.340
So I'm going to have to try to plow my way through this as quickly as possible.

220
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:31.870
But,
uh,
the shows went great.
It was such an amazing night.
And,
um,

221
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.120
I got to tell you,
you know,

222
00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:38.290
if I don't sound excited is it's kind of like a let down a couple of days later,

223
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:41.950
cause now I have no fucking act.
And uh,

224
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.150
I had such a good time and it was so weird,
like coming up to that,
I was like,

225
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:49.420
oh my God,
I'm so sick of these fucking jokes.
Um,

226
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.590
I got to record these and move on because I'm past these jokes.

227
00:12:53.591 --> 00:12:56.230
And then that night I was doing and I was having so much fun when the night was

228
00:12:56.231 --> 00:12:59.830
over,
I was like,
oh my God,
I don't get to do this bit anymore.

229
00:12:59.831 --> 00:13:02.060
I don't get to do that bit anymore.
Um,

230
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.440
I guess I can for the next couple of months before the thing comes out.
But,
uh,

231
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.060
now the one in the can and another one in the can't,
Joe Barden and killed,
um,

232
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.660
it's going to be cool.
I think we're going to have a,

233
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:17.830
hopefully have a nice look to it.
Uh,
I dunno,

234
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.220
I already looked at some pictures of it and I,
you know,

235
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.160
I'm already just going like,
oh,
what did I do this?
What did I do that?

236
00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:26.700
But I think,
I think it looks good.
I fucking hate this.
This is the,

237
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.500
this is the worst part of it.
It's the worst part of it.

238
00:13:29.501 --> 00:13:32.680
I wish I could just take a fucking drug that would make me forget that I was

239
00:13:32.681 --> 00:13:34.960
watching myself and I could just sit down and be like,
okay,

240
00:13:34.961 --> 00:13:38.560
this is somebody else's special.
Put this here,
put that day,
Big Bang,
boom,

241
00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:42.070
and it's done.
Then I could fucking walk away from itself.
Um,

242
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.060
I dunno.
That's the only thing I don't like about it.
But other than that,

243
00:13:46.061 --> 00:13:50.320
it went fucking great.
So listen to this shit.
So I,
um,
oh,

244
00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:54.970
and thank you for everybody who came out to,
uh,
it really was an incredible,

245
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:59.530
incredible night.
Um,
yeah,
it was,

246
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:00.430
it was fucking awesome.

247
00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:05.260
And now I'm just sitting in the basement of this fucking rat infested fucking

248
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:09.600
house.
Um,
I,
my,

249
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:14.590
my year was done.
I got nothing to do.
I get comics come home.
Is My last thing.

250
00:14:14.591 --> 00:14:18.820
And then I'm just fucking in town because I've been out of town all year and,
uh,

251
00:14:18.821 --> 00:14:22.960
we got to finish an editing.
F is for family and uh,

252
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.960
you know,
I feel,
I feel like,
hey,
there's the lovely Nia.
What are,
you know,

253
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.730
um,
so I'm going to tell him the story here.
Do you want to jump on

254
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.590
a,
um,
I'm going to tell them the story.
That flight

255
00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.990
that I had,
he wanted me to,
I'll hit pause here if you want to grab a mic.

256
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.930
Okay.
Well,
do people really want to listen to you unwrapping that shit?
All right,

257
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:52.550
I'll tell you story.
So anyways,
so

258
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.340
<v 1>nia was supposed to come out and see me.
Right.</v>

259
00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:02.180
And then for whatever reason,
you weren't able to make it out right.

260
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.930
For whatever reason.
Yeah.
Whatever reason,

261
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:08.330
the doctor said you're not allowed to fly

262
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:14.480
and your current condition.
Yes.
So I'm like,

263
00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:18.800
all right,
I guess I'm out there by myself.

264
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.540
And,
uh,
so I was gonna,
I was gonna hang out with her on Saturday,
you know,

265
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:27.380
go around doing all the dumb shit,
you know?
Yeah.

266
00:15:27.381 --> 00:15:30.020
We were going to get barbecue and then we're going to go to that fucking

267
00:15:30.021 --> 00:15:32.330
restaurant that every fucking person goes to.

268
00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:36.410
That was in that show Nashville that you loved.
All right.

269
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.870
The Bluebird cafe.
We're going to do all of that shit.

270
00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:40.880
And then at night I was either going to go to the penguins,

271
00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.660
a predators game or I was going to go to the Vanderbilt football game.

272
00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:49.220
Um,
but you weren't allowed to go.

273
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.130
So,
uh,
I said,
fuck it.

274
00:15:52.131 --> 00:15:55.160
I'll come back Saturday or as they say in Boston,

275
00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:59.900
say right.
So I had a,
hang on,

276
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:04.710
let me turn your fucking mic on him.
You good?
Yeah.
Okay.

277
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:09.170
Yeah.
So I'm able just to put the thing together like I know how to do it now.

278
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:10.063
Yes,
you do.

279
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:15.440
What I didn't like is that you've been driving that wonderful car that I got you

280
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.380
for a year
and you've never checked the oil or had anybody check it.

281
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.080
I thought you knew to do that too,
at least.
I mean,
I think I knew in,

282
00:16:25.081 --> 00:16:30.081
in like as a general concepts that that's a thing that needs to happen.

283
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:35.990
But,
but yeah,
thank you.
But,
um,

284
00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.390
as a concept,
this is the thing that I didn't know shit about cars or engines.

285
00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:44.150
Really.
I just contact,
I knew that you had to do a,
but I just,

286
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.140
I just went on Youtube.
I went on Youtube.
How does an engine work?

287
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.370
I just started with that and then I,
I got all the way up to like,
you know,

288
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:56.630
I started watching gas monkey.
I started watching Eric,
the car guy,

289
00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.590
Eric the car guys.
Great.
And you just learn Eric,
the car guy,

290
00:17:00.591 --> 00:17:01.850
you'll even learn about electrical.

291
00:17:01.851 --> 00:17:05.930
I mean that guy fucking knows everything and like you can,
uh,

292
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:10.490
you know,
get your head around what's going on underneath the hood.

293
00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.230
It all needs to stay lubricated and it needs to stay cool.

294
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:19.990
Those are the two big things.
Cool.
And lubricate it.
Cool.
It lubricated.

295
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:27.920
If it gets too hot,
the block could crack,
you know?

296
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.170
Oh,
the fucking,
the Pistons and everything,

297
00:17:30.171 --> 00:17:32.600
you literally just seize up the engine.
Okay.

298
00:17:32.601 --> 00:17:36.640
So you haven't put a lot of miles on it.
So here's the thing.
So I,

299
00:17:36.641 --> 00:17:40.850
I go out there and I'm going to show her,
you know,

300
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.180
I'm going to show her how to check the oil,
right.

301
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.970
So I go into the cockpit of this fucking thing and I'm trying,

302
00:17:46.971 --> 00:17:48.460
then it's not even labeled where to do.

303
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.660
And I finally find the piece of plastic because you don't want to tug too hard

304
00:17:51.661 --> 00:17:54.930
on any,
but some of it's just parts that come apart,
you know?

305
00:17:54.931 --> 00:17:57.600
And then there's like the fuses underneath there.
And so I finally find it,

306
00:17:57.601 --> 00:18:01.140
I popped the hood and I clearly see where you put the oil in.

307
00:18:01.141 --> 00:18:05.580
And for the life of me,
I cannot find any dipstick anywhere.
And I'm like,

308
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:08.070
where the fuck does,
is it,
where the fuck is it?
Where the fuck is it?

309
00:18:08.071 --> 00:18:10.050
And I finally googled,
you know,

310
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:14.190
you're making model whereas the dipstick and it's just,

311
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:18.750
it's all on the dashboard now.
Yeah,
it's going to,
if you're low on oil,

312
00:18:18.751 --> 00:18:23.460
it's going to tell you,
which I guess is more convenient or whatever.
But,
um,

313
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:26.670
I dunno,
I get told me that my tire pressure was too low,

314
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.890
but I get nervous as far as like,
if that fucks up,
like,

315
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:36.360
yeah,
the dipstick is great.
You stick it in there.
Well actually you pull it out,

316
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:38.790
your wipe it off first.
That's what I was doing.
And you stick it in,

317
00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:42.120
you pull it out and it'll show you if you need,
you know,

318
00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:44.040
ad it'll say fallen.

319
00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:46.770
And there's this little round thing where you're going too high and you have too

320
00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:50.370
much oil.
Little round us are a little circles.
They st Lou shape the circle.

321
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.300
That was it.
And it's just not fucking there.
So anyways,
let me tell you,

322
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:58.110
so leave a Nashville Seigel right.
You know,
she can't fly out.

323
00:18:58.111 --> 00:19:03.060
So I'm gonna I'll fly back Saturday and I'll hang out with that.
Right.
So,

324
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:08.010
uh,
I go over the year port,
I get there nice and early.
I drop off the car,

325
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.580
the rental car,
Amal Zippity Doo Dah,

326
00:19:10.581 --> 00:19:13.980
because I'm nice and early and I get all the way to the gate long ass fucking

327
00:19:13.981 --> 00:19:16.680
walk.
And I realized that I didn't,
you know,

328
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.640
I didn't give the car keys to the people there at budget and Mike are fuck.

329
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.360
So I had to walk all the way back.
I wasn't on the other side of security.

330
00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:27.900
I just walked all the way back and then I came as an like thinking in my head

331
00:19:27.901 --> 00:19:31.410
seed.
This is why I leave plenty of time.
I'm not losing my temper.

332
00:19:31.411 --> 00:19:34.770
Everything's fucking fine.
This is the new bill,
right?

333
00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.140
I'm not going to be the new bill.
I'm not going to be me.

334
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.040
I'm trying to find the humor in.
Thanks.
Okay.
All right.

335
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:44.160
Like I had my checks from my gigs this week.

336
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.370
I go down to the bank tonight cause I don't want to deal with the cluster fuck

337
00:19:47.371 --> 00:19:51.780
of the bank during the day with a bunch of people who don't understand how to

338
00:19:51.781 --> 00:19:52.501
handle their money.

339
00:19:52.501 --> 00:19:56.580
Their money is fucked up and you're standing behind them in line and it takes

340
00:19:56.581 --> 00:20:00.450
for fucking ever and they're always yelling through the bulletproof glass at the

341
00:20:00.451 --> 00:20:03.990
other person is if that person went out and bought too much shiny shit with

342
00:20:03.991 --> 00:20:07.380
their money.
Basically speaking.
All right,
I'm not talking about that.

343
00:20:07.381 --> 00:20:09.780
Wells Fargo crap with those cuts.

344
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.650
What they did and then they paid off those 5,000 people.
It's like,
all right,

345
00:20:13.651 --> 00:20:16.800
get the fuck outta here.
Here's a little confidentiality agreement.

346
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:20.970
You guys all collectively yet individually came up with this fucking scam.

347
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:23.820
It wasn't me.
Um,
anyways,
plowing ahead.

348
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.180
So I went down and I go down to the bank and,
and it takes,
you know,

349
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.690
I had like three checks.
It takes two,
one a three and it won't take the last one.

350
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.250
And I started to lose it.

351
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:38.030
I distinctly remember slapping the ATM machine and hearing my wedding band ring

352
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:42.420
when I did it.
And I was just like,
I went up to eight,
eight for me,

353
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:46.350
12 for any other normal person,
but it was an aid for me and I was like,
Bill,

354
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.060
just fucking relax.
It's all fine.

355
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.620
And I thought about my flight and what the fuck happens.
And I was just like,

356
00:20:53.621 --> 00:20:56.230
this is really pales in comparison.
So here's what happened,
my flight.

357
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.390
So I get on this fucking flight,
right?

358
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:03.030
Sitting up their first fall can glaze right.

359
00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.250
Very quickly,
but I have distressful for his class seat.

360
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.400
It's the fucking front row.
So you get the bulkhead in front of you,

361
00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:10.480
which means there's,

362
00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.330
I always just have a backpack and I was shove it underneath the seat.

363
00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:15.370
So I get on the plane fucking relaxed.

364
00:21:15.371 --> 00:21:18.760
I don't have to worry about overhead space is somebody shoves 15 coats up there

365
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:23.480
in a child seat,
you know.
But uh,
I had the stress because,
you know,

366
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.350
I didn't have the fucking thing in front of me.

367
00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:29.110
So that was once I got past that stress,
I sat down,

368
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.920
it's all fucking good and we're flying back and all I'm thinking is,
Oh fuck man,

369
00:21:32.921 --> 00:21:37.690
I'm getting back.
It's fucking football Sunday.
Tomorrow I'm going to watch the,

370
00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:42.090
uh,
the fucking,
uh,
the,
the Formula One race.
You know,

371
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.850
I'm going to watch the Patriots game.
I'm going to maybe watch a little buffalo,

372
00:21:45.851 --> 00:21:49.660
Miami,
you know,
I got the whole fucking,
I got my whole thing laid out right?

373
00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.230
Maybe catch a lake college game shit out.
By the time I land,

374
00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:56.860
it's only gonna be like eight o'clock at night.
So we fucking go up in the year,

375
00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:02.320
we're about 45 minutes into the flight and I start smelling what smells like

376
00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:05.710
burnt popcorn.
That's the smell first.

377
00:22:05.711 --> 00:22:08.770
And then it gets a little more fucking intense and I'm kind of looking at the

378
00:22:08.771 --> 00:22:12.820
stewardess is hit,
I'm in the first fucking row gone.
Did one of them burn a meal.

379
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:18.070
Like I'm smelling a burning smell and it's starting to fuck with my eyes a

380
00:22:18.071 --> 00:22:21.970
little bit and I'm not seeing any panic on their faces.
So I go,

381
00:22:21.971 --> 00:22:26.971
it must be food because I know I only have a few hours flying with my license,

382
00:22:27.971 --> 00:22:32.930
but I know,
you know,
smoke in the plane is not,
it's not a good thing right now.

383
00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.300
So everything's going about normally and then all of a sudden I feel as

384
00:22:37.301 --> 00:22:39.760
descending,
you know,

385
00:22:39.761 --> 00:22:44.761
and I feel like the fucking wings are doing little more doing that shit and I'm

386
00:22:44.771 --> 00:22:47.090
like,
Oh wow,
we must be hitting some rough,

387
00:22:47.091 --> 00:22:51.070
fair cause then the smoke wasn't as bad and I was thinking like we must be

388
00:22:51.071 --> 00:22:52.810
hidden.
It wasn't like visible smoke.

389
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.860
You could smell it and I could kind of feel it my eyes a little bit.
Um,

390
00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.520
how old did I just say I could smell it.
I felt it in my eyes.

391
00:23:00.521 --> 00:23:03.520
It was very uncomfortable.
Um,
so the fucking wings,

392
00:23:03.521 --> 00:23:07.150
I like doing that shit and I'm thinking like,
oh he probably got it.

393
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:10.660
They know a report that there was some rough air up and he's going to go

394
00:23:10.661 --> 00:23:12.250
underneath and then we'll go back up again.

395
00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:17.280
And then like all of a sudden my glass with the water started sliding forward.

396
00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.930
Like all of a sudden I was kind of realizing that my chair was kind of,

397
00:23:22.931 --> 00:23:27.670
we were at like a fun,
like not a 45 degree angle,
but we were at a significant,

398
00:23:27.671 --> 00:23:31.840
we would fucking descending rapidly in all of a sudden the stewards just came
up,

399
00:23:31.841 --> 00:23:36.430
she goes,
can I take your glasses?
Were landing.
And then I was just like,
oh fuck,

400
00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:38.050
something's on fire.

401
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.920
And the pilot didn't give any like announcement like no,

402
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:45.800
cause we were like at 30 something thousand feet in the second you smoke.

403
00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:47.380
It's like,
I don't know I there,

404
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:51.590
I guarantee you there were lights lighting up on his little dashboard there and

405
00:23:51.591 --> 00:23:53.240
it wasn't saying check the tire pressure.

406
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.650
I don't know what warning lights they have probably didn't want to make,

407
00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.410
he didn't want anyone to panic.
So he's just like,
you know what,

408
00:24:00.411 --> 00:24:02.390
let me just land this thing.
No,

409
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.560
I think he smelled smoke like there's something on fire and I'm 30,000 feet and

410
00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:08.510
I have to get this thing on the fucking ground immediately.

411
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:13.430
And he didn't say anything because of wasn't they normally tell you like we are

412
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.330
going to like the sand really quickly because of this,
that and the I,

413
00:24:16.331 --> 00:24:21.110
I had nothing to do with scaring us and that he didn't have fucking time.
Okay.

414
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.680
So he just fucking goes down and I'm just like,
Oh shit,
here we go.
Right.

415
00:24:24.681 --> 00:24:26.720
So the late late this stewardess,
you know,

416
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:28.000
I didn't know we were landing cause they had,

417
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:32.510
everybody had the shades pulled down and it wasn't until my glass fucking slid

418
00:24:32.511 --> 00:24:34.850
forward,
I was like,
this guy's like,
sky's really,

419
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.970
he's really dropping down here like what's going on?
And what's,

420
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.850
so when she came over and she said,
hey,
we're,
we're landing now,
right?

421
00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:43.490
We're literally 15 minutes in the flight,
Nashville to La,
right?

422
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:47.480
The woman next to me,
he goes like,
oh my God,
we're here already.

423
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:56.270
And I was like,
I laughed.
And I was like,
no,
no,
no.
I go,

424
00:24:56.271 --> 00:25:00.740
we're landing.
She goes,
where?
And I said,
well,
I looked at my watch and go,

425
00:25:00.741 --> 00:25:04.580
I dunno,
she fucking lifted up to shade.
I saw a river.
I go,

426
00:25:04.581 --> 00:25:07.310
maybe that's the Mississippi,
I'm going to say Saint Louis.

427
00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.140
It turned out it was a little rock,
Arkansas.
And,
uh,
she goes,
well,

428
00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.470
why are we landing?
And I was like,
well,
it probably had to do with that.

429
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.600
Did you smell that burning smell?
She was like,
yeah,
I go,

430
00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:22.250
probably has to do with that.
And uh,
so she's looking around and go,
yeah,

431
00:25:22.251 --> 00:25:25.310
but he really has,
he had total control of the airplane.

432
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:27.920
But my thing that I was worried with about is,
you know,

433
00:25:27.921 --> 00:25:29.930
I don't know about the mechanics on planes and shit,

434
00:25:29.931 --> 00:25:31.730
but like if there was some sort of something,
whatever,

435
00:25:31.731 --> 00:25:34.610
it burned through some wire,
some hydraulic thing,

436
00:25:34.611 --> 00:25:36.800
and all of a sudden he can't control it.
And next thing you know,

437
00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:40.190
we're upside down.
Like in that Denzel movie,
you know?
Yeah.

438
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.110
When you lose the rear stabilizer,

439
00:25:42.111 --> 00:25:46.760
the dumbest shit ever that he's able to flip it back over and land,
you know,

440
00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:50.630
um,
Hollywood movie.
Yeah.
He wants,
it's up like you fucked.

441
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.170
Nobody can land that.
Not even Salie.
Right.

442
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.520
So we start fucking coming in and we're in little rock.
I don't know,

443
00:25:58.521 --> 00:26:01.850
it's little rocket.
All he sees is fucking river.
And you know,
those things,

444
00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:05.150
you can only see out the side.
And I'm just thinking,
get it on the ground,

445
00:26:05.151 --> 00:26:08.720
get it on the ground.
Just get it on the fucking ground.
And,
uh,

446
00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:13.490
all I'm seeing is this fucking,
that's the,
uh,
that's the rodents in the wall.

447
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:18.320
There's one,
there's one like right above your fucking heads or ran by,

448
00:26:18.321 --> 00:26:20.660
I think it's a quarter.
The,
I don't know if you guys can't hear it,

449
00:26:20.661 --> 00:26:21.860
you just hear a plaster falling.

450
00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.950
I think they ate through the air condition duck and they just sort of run back

451
00:26:27.951 --> 00:26:32.250
and forth,
you know?
Okay.
All right.
So anyway,
so I'm,

452
00:26:32.251 --> 00:26:35.510
I'm almost dying in a plane crush in here.
So the fucking thing comes down.

453
00:26:35.511 --> 00:26:38.730
All in,
all I see is the,
uh,
the river and,

454
00:26:38.731 --> 00:26:40.450
and that's what I started thinking of like it,

455
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:45.560
this mother fucker puts this thing in the water.
All right.
All I'm thinking is,

456
00:26:45.561 --> 00:26:50.100
is stay conscious.
You have to fucking stay conscious and a,

457
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:53.310
that fucking doors right around the corner provided,
you know,

458
00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:55.650
he doesn't smash the whole thing up and you can't open the door.

459
00:26:55.651 --> 00:26:57.960
And then I got to fight my way through all these other fuckers and I'm going to

460
00:26:57.961 --> 00:27:02.520
drown.
But then I see the runway,
he lands the thing and then just like,

461
00:27:02.521 --> 00:27:04.790
please reverse engineer reverse engines though,
since kicked in.

462
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.610
Then once we stopped,
I was like,
okay,
all right,
fine.

463
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:13.760
I live right.
So we go over,
we taxi over,
there's a fire engine,

464
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.530
one of those and there's only one,
cause it's little rock,
Arkansas,
right?

465
00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:18.330
It's a little fucking fire engine comes over.

466
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.170
We go to deep plane like do you need tea,
plane?
And there was smoke Baba Bell,

467
00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:27.750
the captain came on and he finally says,
he said,
I had my hands full up,
hear me.

468
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.460
Uh,
sorry,
I didn't make an announcement,

469
00:27:29.461 --> 00:27:34.090
meaning like it was a serious fucking thing.
Um,
so I,

470
00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:38.400
as we got to get off this,
two guys in the giant fucking speced his suits,

471
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:42.000
they look ridiculous.
They look like they were beekeepers.
It is,

472
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.720
they didn't look like firefighters.
And we go to get off and um,

473
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:49.970
as we get off,
you know,
the ticket agent person,
okay,

474
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.690
they're going to check to see if the plane is still fine and blah,
blah blah.

475
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:57.470
And I love thinking in my head is like,
dude,
the fucking thing was on fire fired.

476
00:27:57.471 --> 00:27:58.970
There's no fucking way we're getting back on that.

477
00:27:58.971 --> 00:28:02.150
There's people walking in with the beekeeper super suits.
It's over,
right?

478
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:07.220
So we sit there for about a half an hour and uh,
they finally come on.
They say,

479
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:10.140
hey,
here's the deal.
We need to get a new plane.

480
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.980
The plane they were going to get is two hours away,

481
00:28:13.981 --> 00:28:17.820
but the crew is an hour away from getting to the plane.

482
00:28:17.821 --> 00:28:21.900
So it's going to be about a three hour delay and you people will kind of cool.

483
00:28:21.901 --> 00:28:25.610
But there's all those,
you know,
the 15% wow.
Look,
they're

484
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:33.030
giving them shit.
Yeah.
Okay.
Giving them shit.
It's like,
dude,

485
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.530
the fucking thing,
I dunno what was on fire,
what was smoldering,

486
00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:41.820
but it was smoldering at 30 something thousand feet and the fucking pilot just

487
00:28:41.821 --> 00:28:45.720
got us on the ground and we like a stud and we didn't die and now you're fucking

488
00:28:45.721 --> 00:28:49.020
bitching,
man.
Go Up to the bar and shut the fuck up.
Right.

489
00:28:49.021 --> 00:28:52.410
So there's one guy there with his purple shirt and he's fucking breaking his

490
00:28:52.411 --> 00:28:56.450
neck,
shaking his head like I was fumbling.
And you know the deal,
you know,

491
00:28:56.451 --> 00:28:58.350
you know the deal.
If they say it's going to happen in three hours,

492
00:28:58.351 --> 00:29:00.270
that means about what's going to be about 12 right?

493
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.570
So we go into the bar and I want you Auburn kicking the shit out of the

494
00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:04.483
razorbacks.

495
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:08.700
Then I watched the cubs get into the world series and they just keep going like,

496
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:12.990
well it's not,
now it's looking like nine 30 and then they do that.

497
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.580
It's looking like 10,

498
00:29:14.581 --> 00:29:19.581
10 we're thinking 10 46 and people just eat more,

499
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.770
Ahh,
ahh,
freaking out.

500
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.510
Then they changed the gate and everybody just is gradually more and more like

501
00:29:27.511 --> 00:29:30.360
freaking out.
And then they're vacuuming up the airport.

502
00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.550
It was the Hillary and Bill Clinton airport,

503
00:29:32.551 --> 00:29:36.780
the bill and Hillary Clinton airport,
which was,
you know,
it would basic seats,

504
00:29:36.781 --> 00:29:38.400
you know,
the Clintons,
they stole so much money.

505
00:29:38.401 --> 00:29:42.760
There's only so much left for the airport there.
Right.
So long story short,

506
00:29:42.761 --> 00:29:46.270
we landed about four o'clock,
this are our five o'clock or something like that.

507
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:51.940
The plane,
we didn't get on the fucking plane to get out of there until like,

508
00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:56.140
uh,
like a little bit after 1:00 AM.
And this is the thing,
like the lady,

509
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.050
the person goes,
okay,
so the planes here and then every,
it's like,

510
00:29:59.051 --> 00:30:03.790
so it's going to take us to la now and the person,
the guy just goes like,
ah,

511
00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.000
no,
the plane's going to take you back to Dallas.

512
00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:12.010
<v 6>Yeah.
Everyone's like,
Dallas,
we came from Nashville.
Listen,</v>

513
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:15.390
what kind of ways is to run an airline?
They're like screaming it.

514
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:19.580
<v 1>This Guy Ed.
Uh,
and I wish I sat the whole time.</v>

515
00:30:19.581 --> 00:30:23.660
I just sat there laughing my ass off going like,
who gives a fuck?

516
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:28.380
As long as we were not dead,
right?
Like I just couldn't like that man.

517
00:30:28.381 --> 00:30:29.750
It was fucking scary,
right?

518
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:34.760
So they end up flying us into Dallas and uh,
we'd land and we're like,

519
00:30:34.761 --> 00:30:37.580
this is the plane would take an la,
right?
They're like,
absolutely.

520
00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.220
We land in that in Dallas.
And they go,
okay,

521
00:30:40.221 --> 00:30:42.350
we're going to need everybody to get off the plane.
Right?

522
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:46.540
<v 6>There's one guy here,
this guy,</v>

523
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:51.570
they can't possibly think we're ever going to fly this airline again.
Right.

524
00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:53.680
I'm like,
I'm absolutely gonna fly it again.

525
00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:59.660
<v 1>One of the guys who works for them just flew a plane that was somehow on fire</v>

526
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:03.110
from 30,000 fucking feet down to the ground.
Said great airline.

527
00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.190
It's a great fucking airline.

528
00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:08.810
So we get off the fucking plane and I slept on the fucking floor waiting for the

529
00:31:08.811 --> 00:31:13.190
get back on and we ended up getting back on.
And uh,
we ended up landing at like,

530
00:31:13.191 --> 00:31:15.410
I think like 10 in the morning and actually figured it out.

531
00:31:15.411 --> 00:31:20.411
We took 16 hours for me to get back from Nashville and from here to Sydney.

532
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:25.670
Australia is 14 hours.
So I literally could have flown to Sydney,

533
00:31:25.671 --> 00:31:28.640
got a connecting flight,
got my ass down to Melbourne.
But you know what Nia,

534
00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:33.640
I didn't fucking,
I didn't burn up in a plane.
That's all.
I just kept thinking

535
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:38.190
<v 7>you,
the fact that you did in flip out,
it's still like kind of amazing to me.</v>

536
00:31:38.191 --> 00:31:41.550
But the thing is with you is that when big things like this happen,

537
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.440
you are so calm.

538
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:48.360
Like you are just very like relaxed and you have like a lot of perspective about

539
00:31:48.361 --> 00:31:51.570
it and you're like,
well,
but this and this and this,
so this and this and this.

540
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:56.820
But like,
you know,
God forbid there's a new operating system on your phone.

541
00:31:56.821 --> 00:32:01.821
It's like you have the meltdown of like,

542
00:32:02.131 --> 00:32:02.780
you know,

543
00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.640
<v 1>I would put everybody in your crash.</v>

544
00:32:04.641 --> 00:32:07.280
Everybody who flipped out about all of that airplane shit,

545
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:12.310
I would've put all of them to shame over new operating system on your phone.

546
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:17.450
I can,
I can lose it.
I can sit for 16 hours in an airport.

547
00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:21.170
I had a great time.
I went in and I shut down.
I watched the cubs.

548
00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.230
Like I'm sitting there going like the little cubs literally have not been to a

549
00:32:24.231 --> 00:32:29.120
world series.
They've even Ben,
there is bad as Cleveland is.

550
00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:34.270
They haven't even fucking gotten to the world series in [inaudible] 71 years.

551
00:32:35.151 --> 00:32:39.980
That's,
that's almost impossible.
If it wasn't them,
it is

552
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.460
<v 6>impossible because I don't think anybody else has ever fucking done like just</v>

553
00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:46.790
not been there.
I would've been crying out of frustration.

554
00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:51.820
I would have been so tired and hungry and frustrated and like all these things,

555
00:32:52.311 --> 00:32:56.690
the fucking plane was on fire.
No,
I got it.
I or whatever it was smoldering.

556
00:32:56.691 --> 00:32:59.360
Something was burning and everyone was sitting there going,

557
00:32:59.361 --> 00:33:03.350
who had one of those fucking galaxy seven phones in there?
There,
right,
exactly.

558
00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.080
They Namsa yeah,
that they checked.
That's what I was thinking.

559
00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:07.670
Cause there was that thing with value.

560
00:33:07.671 --> 00:33:11.720
Jet was something caught on fire underneath there and it burned through what it

561
00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:12.111
was,
what,

562
00:33:12.111 --> 00:33:16.550
it's whatever controllers they had and the thing crashed into a fucking swamp.

563
00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.180
Did you and some of the body's got eaten by alligators.
Oh Jesus.

564
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:23.180
Did you say that?
Fuck that.
I'm sleeping on a floor.

565
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:28.670
Did you say like at the airport or somebody asks about that phone,

566
00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:32.630
like they were asking people if anyone had that phone.
Oh,
well we got,

567
00:33:32.631 --> 00:33:37.220
when we got back on the plane the second time they said if anybody has a galaxy

568
00:33:37.221 --> 00:33:41.310
seven phone,
can you notice five?
The stewardess?
Yeah.
Um,

569
00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:45.020
which is hilarious to me.
Like,
okay,
it happened on a plane.

570
00:33:45.021 --> 00:33:49.940
You know that guys phones aren't smoking in his pocket.
He went to turn it off.

571
00:33:49.941 --> 00:33:53.030
He put it in his pocket and then or something like that and started smoking.

572
00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.500
Yeah,
but it's not going to take down a plane if it's in your bag and it starts

573
00:33:57.501 --> 00:34:02.030
smoking and then ignites with the shirt or some shit like that and you have a

574
00:34:02.031 --> 00:34:06.220
really,
I guess a bad canvas suitcase.
Why could not have happened?

575
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.170
It eats its way out then.
Yeah,
I think you're in Trump,
but what's,

576
00:34:09.171 --> 00:34:10.004
what's he going to do?

577
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:13.580
Just stare at his pocket as it slowly catches on fire going,
oh my God,

578
00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:22.170
<v 8>they're all going to die.
Yeah,
I did.
That's exactly</v>

579
00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:23.260
<v 6>what happened.
Dude.</v>

580
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:26.290
There was a guy that literally tried to light his fucking shoes on fire and

581
00:34:26.291 --> 00:34:28.540
everybody just beat the fuck out of him.
Like that's what,

582
00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:33.430
what happened to this guy and he was trying to take the fucking plane down.

583
00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:38.230
Those phones are like fuck.
They always exaggerate.

584
00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:40.750
They always exaggerate like you went through,

585
00:34:40.751 --> 00:34:45.700
if there's anything smoking on a plane,
on a pressurized plucking,
enclosed,

586
00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:50.580
you know,
thing in Vietnam vehicle.
But you know what I'm saying?
Vessel.
Yeah.

587
00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:53.920
Got to get everybody out of there.
Better safe than sorry.
I know,

588
00:34:53.921 --> 00:34:58.370
but it's like you your case so your phone starts catching on fire.
It started,

589
00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:00.670
I mean,
how long are you going to take it out?
Like oh my God,

590
00:35:00.671 --> 00:35:04.630
what the fuck and then take your little complimentary glass of water and dump it

591
00:35:04.631 --> 00:35:09.260
on it and it's over.
You know what?
I don't know what he did after that.
I,

592
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:13.600
I'm sure he took it out and was like,
oh shit,
I know exactly what it did.

593
00:35:13.601 --> 00:35:18.601
He grab somebody else's phone and took a selfie and said Hashtag fuck my life.

594
00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:20.530
And then he got a deal.

595
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:24.220
He got some sort of internet deal and now he makes 400 grand.

596
00:35:24.221 --> 00:35:28.150
He's the fuck my life guy.
And he runs around and he does,

597
00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.120
he does splits in front of people like to do with the blonde hair.

598
00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:36.340
That fucking 60 minutes segment really chapter your ass didn't that

599
00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.000
building?
No,
it didn't.
No,
I,

600
00:35:39.001 --> 00:35:41.760
I'm Kyle and I weighed the low back of bill and I just watched it.

601
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:45.980
<v 7>60 minutes segment,
right about social media influencers.</v>

602
00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.080
And so there's these kids on there,

603
00:35:48.081 --> 00:35:49.850
cause you know they're millennials or whatever,

604
00:35:49.851 --> 00:35:51.410
what the exception of Kim Kardashians.

605
00:35:51.411 --> 00:35:55.520
But the other people on there are these young people that you know,

606
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:59.480
have all these viewed vines and snapchats and everything.

607
00:35:59.481 --> 00:36:03.050
And so companies are paying them and saying the amounts of money to do

608
00:36:03.051 --> 00:36:04.100
advertising before.

609
00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.130
And one of them is this blonde kid whose name I don't remember.

610
00:36:07.131 --> 00:36:10.760
He's fucking hilarious.
And he does these splits in front of people,

611
00:36:10.761 --> 00:36:13.180
random locations.
He's like at the

612
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:17.470
<v 6>wall of China,
Eiffel Tower and everything.</v>

613
00:36:17.471 --> 00:36:21.460
And he has all these views.
So he gets,
no,
no.
I thought all those kids are funny.

614
00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:26.410
What drove me nuts about it was how the reporter just couldn't get his head

615
00:36:26.411 --> 00:36:27.244
around it going like,

616
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:32.670
so then you get 6 million views and people want to advertise in that and it's

617
00:36:34.991 --> 00:36:38.190
like two 16 fuck head.

618
00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:43.690
You're on a TV show,
there's advertising on your TV show.

619
00:36:43.691 --> 00:36:48.220
The amount of viewers that you have is how much you can charge for ad space.

620
00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:52.720
Why would this be?
Just couldn't get his fucking head around it.

621
00:36:52.721 --> 00:36:56.620
He's explaining it to the people that are watching 60 minutes,

622
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:58.780
which are older people generally.

623
00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:02.590
They have older correspondent there explaining it to our parents.

624
00:37:02.591 --> 00:37:05.320
They're not explained to us.
They let them off the hook.

625
00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:07.650
You're letting them off the hook.
They're not,
they're doing,

626
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:12.670
I'm telling you it wasn't doing it for like 60 70 plus year old port porter was

627
00:37:12.971 --> 00:37:15.120
exactly who I am.

628
00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:21.040
I'm telling you there is a reason why they're so like,
all right,

629
00:37:21.041 --> 00:37:25.750
well baby baby Cobra maybe cause I get it maybe cause I get it.
Yeah,

630
00:37:25.751 --> 00:37:28.510
you get like impatient with it.
That's for old people that are like,

631
00:37:28.511 --> 00:37:32.560
you do have a hamburger.
I fucking have a pod,

632
00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:36.340
a podcast.
It's a radio show on the Internet.

633
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:40.690
Enough people listen.
People will like advertise.
I know,

634
00:37:40.691 --> 00:37:42.060
but explain that to like an,

635
00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:45.500
Oh I shouldn't even say six of my dad's 65 and I think he would grasp the

636
00:37:45.501 --> 00:37:49.620
concept but like think about the most older people who are not la,

637
00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.760
New York or just not savvy about that stuff.

638
00:37:51.761 --> 00:37:55.010
Like they don't get it and they probably don't necessarily the kids like that.

639
00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:59.360
Oh,
and then I fucking do this and I wear a Jimmy John's shirt and he's like,
Hey,

640
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:02.110
and day and then,
and then they pay you for that.

641
00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.570
It's like to have to fucking bands.

642
00:38:04.571 --> 00:38:07.900
This guy's going to see like there's advertising at the shows.

643
00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:10.660
The rolling stones have like Bud light in the background.
Right.

644
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:12.290
<v 7>I know.
I just think,</v>

645
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:16.850
I really think that they're explaining it for older people who don't understand

646
00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:20.270
what it means to go viral.
They don't even know what that word means.

647
00:38:20.271 --> 00:38:23.330
It's a new phenomenon for them.
They don't get it.

648
00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:25.220
<v 6>60 minutes is not for people.</v>

649
00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.550
It's a new word for what the fuck they've been doing.
Yeah.

650
00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:33.260
60 minutes went viral in the 60s it was a hit show,
right.

651
00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.000
It just wasn't viral.
It went,

652
00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:39.280
there was no internet TV or wireless or whatever the fuck you call the hit TV

653
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:41.650
show,
but viral.
Do you think there was,

654
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.470
there was people from the 18 hundreds still alive going like,

655
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.200
so you're in that box

656
00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:52.450
and a lot of the more people that watch it,

657
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:58.650
you make more money.
Yes.

658
00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:04.070
Yes.
That's exactly how that works.
Yeah,

659
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:08.060
it was fucking like,
but he sent it to every one of them.

660
00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.890
I know every single thing,
you know,

661
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:15.200
he was explaining it for the older people at home that don't understand these

662
00:39:15.201 --> 00:39:19.940
things and Kim Kardashian couldn't have broke it down any more for him and he

663
00:39:19.941 --> 00:39:24.080
just couldn't get his fucking head.
He's like,

664
00:39:24.081 --> 00:39:28.700
so you don't sing,
you don't dance.
She's like,
no,
I just like,
it's a lifestyle.

665
00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:32.840
I'm a brand
and it's like,
dude,

666
00:39:32.841 --> 00:39:36.630
you're literally interviewing around you taking the fucking time to interview

667
00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.550
her.
She obviously has some sort of fucking clouds.

668
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:46.810
I've never seen a guy so in the eye of the storm and he's out there with like

669
00:39:46.811 --> 00:39:49.840
sunglasses on,
like looking for the sun.

670
00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:57.970
It's windy and a tree could hit me in the head.

671
00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.310
I think he just couldn't get his fucking head around it.

672
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:03.940
It was driving me up the fucking wall,
drive me up the wall.

673
00:40:03.941 --> 00:40:07.780
And then also like people acting like these little things where these high

674
00:40:07.781 --> 00:40:12.220
concept fucking bits,
they're not that quick little fucking things like that.

675
00:40:12.221 --> 00:40:16.370
Dude,
go on,
I can do the whole Batman,
Superman.
What if in four seconds?
Yeah,

676
00:40:16.371 --> 00:40:20.710
of course.
Yes.
Everybody said that.
Yes.
Soup man would just fuck him up.

677
00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:24.430
That was it.
And then the old guy was going like,

678
00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:29.020
so like that's,
that's what you think would happen.

679
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:32.840
Sorry.
That.

680
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:35.710
And when you were watching your reality show,

681
00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:40.890
I tapped out when that girl finally just goes for me after she'd just been

682
00:40:41.021 --> 00:40:44.980
talking about herself and then she's going to talk about herself talking about

683
00:40:44.981 --> 00:40:47.170
herself.
I have no idea.

684
00:40:47.171 --> 00:40:51.580
My mom was that frustrated that it affected her that way.

685
00:40:51.581 --> 00:40:53.980
And I just feel like for me,

686
00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:58.510
I know I really do hate that.
Just for me,

687
00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:01.660
I just feel like for me,

688
00:41:01.661 --> 00:41:05.860
I just feel like is not a great way to start a sentence.

689
00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:09.970
You should just say,
I think I feel for all of that,

690
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:14.920
all of that reality show speak that you watch,
you know,

691
00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:18.640
and that made me feel a certain kind of way,
some type of way.

692
00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.350
It made me feel some type of way.

693
00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:26.520
It's always so fucking vague,
but in some type of way never means happy.

694
00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:30.750
Now why can't you just say it fucking pissed you off.

695
00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:33.350
Maybe because this is a nicer way to say it,
right?

696
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:38.030
Maybe cause you don't want to get into your specific emotions so you're like,

697
00:41:38.031 --> 00:41:40.190
it just had me feeling some type of way.
No,
no,
no,
no.

698
00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:45.280
There's got one woman on any of those shows that does not want to get into how

699
00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:49.580
they're feeling emotionally.
That is what the entire fucking show is.

700
00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:52.670
I don't know.
I think it's just the way young people are speaking now.

701
00:41:52.671 --> 00:41:57.660
They don't say,
that made me frustrated or I was really angry.
No,
that was like,

702
00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:01.130
that was like a,
you just say,
I'm in my feelings.
You said no,

703
00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.870
I'm really in my feelings.
This is,

704
00:42:02.871 --> 00:42:06.470
she was really in her feelings about it or I feel some type of way.

705
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:09.380
That's what people say now instead of saying,
well,
those,

706
00:42:09.381 --> 00:42:11.840
those real housewives would talking like that and they're like,

707
00:42:11.841 --> 00:42:15.140
they get like 20 year old kids.
Well,

708
00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:18.750
because they're trying to be by the time you want.
I'm being right now,

709
00:42:18.751 --> 00:42:20.220
I'm being the old guy in 60 minutes.

710
00:42:20.221 --> 00:42:24.030
I just can't get my head around why anybody.

711
00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.330
I feel some type of way instead of saying I'm up.

712
00:42:27.331 --> 00:42:29.280
So no matter how great their lives are,

713
00:42:29.281 --> 00:42:31.950
they're always going to yell at each other and pull each other's hair.

714
00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:36.990
I'm doing that.
Yes.
Spill.
That's what the fucking show is.
And you enjoy this.
Yes,

715
00:42:36.991 --> 00:42:41.590
Bill.
That's why I watch it.
All right.
Hey near.
You know what?

716
00:42:41.591 --> 00:42:43.930
Fair enough.
Fair enough.

717
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:46.980
You feel some type of way about all this shit?

718
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:52.940
Oh my God,
that guy is 60 minutes.
It was like,
I swear to God

719
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:58.490
I wanted to eat the glass.
I was drinking out of splaining to yours,
dad.

720
00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:04.160
That whole concepts.
Listen,
that's what that man was doing.

721
00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:10.080
Yeah.
My Dad would get it.
You'd have to be like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
sure,

722
00:43:10.081 --> 00:43:14.910
sure,
sure.
Yeah.
He wouldn't listen.
What'd you say?

723
00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:19.770
Okay,
Chris.
Phil,
I'm tired.
Okay.
I don't need to hear this shit.

724
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:29.520
Oh,
I shouldn't tell this story,
but I'm gonna.
Um,
what story?

725
00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:34.450
Okay.
I can't tell.
I can't tell it cause it does,
does,

726
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:36.760
does to many people I have to fucking protect.

727
00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:41.770
All I can tell you is that the authority figure called the house

728
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:48.440
and said,
ah,
Shit.
And he said,
listen,

729
00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:54.650
I can't prove it,
but I know your son did sun.

730
00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:59.390
What's,
you know,
x,
y and Z.
Oh right.
And then dad goes,
what do you mean?

731
00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:03.020
He goes,
what do you mean you can't prove it?
But you know,
he did it and he goes,

732
00:44:03.021 --> 00:44:05.060
oh Christ,
I don't have time for this shit.
And he hung up.

733
00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:12.940
He was the exact opposite of I'm going to get involved with the shit.

734
00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:19.520
Like I really loved that response.
No,
my family,
we're all loners,

735
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.120
big family,
but we all just do our own shit.
And we,

736
00:44:23.121 --> 00:44:25.980
I'd last thing like the same way.
I don't want to like,

737
00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:30.200
like the way I've been paying for three cell phone numbers

738
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:35.760
<v 1>for the labs.
I don't even realize it to do the back story.</v>

739
00:44:35.761 --> 00:44:38.130
One time I was on the fucking road and Nia calls up,
she goes,

740
00:44:38.131 --> 00:44:41.190
why do you have like three different cell phone numbers with the fuck are you

741
00:44:41.191 --> 00:44:45.810
live in a double life?
And I go,
I don't,
I got one.
She goes,
no,
you got three.

742
00:44:45.811 --> 00:44:49.380
I got no I don't.
I got one.
She goes,
I'm looking at the bill right now.

743
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.750
And what it was was

744
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:56.030
<v 7>it was bad and the two thousands I was like,</v>

745
00:44:56.420 --> 00:45:00.200
I was so confused.
Slash angry.

746
00:45:00.201 --> 00:45:02.180
Slash annoyed slash okay,

747
00:45:02.181 --> 00:45:05.750
maybe it's just not what I think it is or whatever.

748
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:08.490
But I'm like paying all the bills and you're on the road.

749
00:45:08.491 --> 00:45:10.220
So I'm like going through everything and I'm like,

750
00:45:10.221 --> 00:45:13.040
this mother fucker has three numbers.
Why,

751
00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:18.200
why on earth would he have three phones,
three numbers?
I'd only seen one phone.

752
00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.200
Does he have a secret phone?
Like a secret?
So I got a little flip.

753
00:45:21.201 --> 00:45:24.830
Cause I know men do that.
Sometimes they have a secret little bat phone.

754
00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:26.160
<v 1>All right.
This is what it was.</v>

755
00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.850
This is what it was back in like 15 fucking years ago.

756
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:35.910
Wasn't that maybe 1212 years ago.
It was when I was with you.

757
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.410
I would go on the road and this is before like smartphones and all of that and

758
00:45:40.411 --> 00:45:42.360
you had to get the internet and you'd,

759
00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:46.050
I go to these hotels and they were charging me like 1299 a day,

760
00:45:46.051 --> 00:45:50.160
1599 a day and I wasn't making shit on the road and would fucking,

761
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:54.240
it would add up and that was still back when you know you'd get sides for your

762
00:45:54.241 --> 00:45:55.440
auditions emailed to you.

763
00:45:55.441 --> 00:45:59.100
Then you had to go down to the fucking the thing in the lobby and isn't a center

764
00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:01.560
and print it out.
So they came up with these little things.

765
00:46:01.561 --> 00:46:02.820
They look like hockey pucks,

766
00:46:02.821 --> 00:46:06.750
these little round things that you you to get your own Internet.

767
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:09.810
I think Bobby Kelly,
dude,
you got to get this dude right?
Yeah.

768
00:46:09.811 --> 00:46:11.030
My Dad had one of the yeah,

769
00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:14.830
and plug it in and it came with like a phone number or something.
Okay.

770
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:19.020
So I got one of those big explain how to do it.

771
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.080
I did at one time it worked.
It didn't work again.

772
00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:26.160
And then I forgot about it to the point I forgot I even had it.

773
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:27.810
And then I got another one.

774
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.393
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

775
00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.960
<v 1>And I met that one.
I just,
you know,</v>

776
00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.350
after awhile I just got a smart phone and I never look at my bill.
I just look,

777
00:46:35.351 --> 00:46:36.400
what does it cost?

778
00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.353
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

779
00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:42.680
<v 1>So then you know,
years later,
so you've been paying for this number.</v>

780
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:46.610
I've been paying extra $50 a month.
There's still on my bill.

781
00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:49.210
<v 7>What are you going to take it off then?</v>

782
00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:50.740
<v 1>Yeah,
I don't want to,</v>

783
00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:54.910
I would rather pay 50 bucks a fucking month and have to sit there and I'm not

784
00:46:54.911 --> 00:46:55.750
going to get said,

785
00:46:56.470 --> 00:47:01.270
I can't fucking deal with calling up and going,

786
00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:06.010
I need to cancel this.
I am no longer using,
that's not how it works.

787
00:47:06.011 --> 00:47:10.900
So you'll go in and they,
and,
and it goes like,
um,
you know what?

788
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.520
It's still robot.
And then it's going like,
you know,
if you want to do this,

789
00:47:15.521 --> 00:47:17.320
press one,
if you want to do that,
press two.

790
00:47:17.321 --> 00:47:20.530
And you always are existing at like one and a half.

791
00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:25.270
It's like a little bit three but a little bit four years,
just like operator,

792
00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:29.980
operator,
operator,
press zero.
I'm sorry that doesn't fucking,
and then

793
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.000
<v 6>the worst thing ever is you get on and you say,
yeah,
who am I speaking with?</v>

794
00:47:34.001 --> 00:47:37.330
To a William Byrd.
Yeah.
Can I get your zip code?
Can I get you?

795
00:47:37.331 --> 00:47:42.160
You're fucking first gold fish's name.
Can I get this?
Can I get that?

796
00:47:42.161 --> 00:47:44.830
Can I get that?
And then you tell them what the problem is and they go,
okay,

797
00:47:44.831 --> 00:47:47.590
I'm gonna have to transfer you to somebody else and my Cologne.
And they go,
okay,

798
00:47:47.591 --> 00:47:51.550
who am I speaking to?
What is your zip code?
What is the name you guys like?

799
00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:55.030
I just fucking told you t here I go.
I fucking told y'all that shit.
Yeah,

800
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:56.810
I don't want to deal with that shit.
See,

801
00:47:56.811 --> 00:48:01.490
you'd rather continue to pay this bill for the rest of your life.
No,

802
00:48:01.491 --> 00:48:04.400
I want to take them off.
Of course I'm going to take them off.
I just,
you know,

803
00:48:04.401 --> 00:48:09.010
that's not my top priority.
Nia is not fucking cool.

804
00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:10.740
You saw when I tried to get the NFL network,

805
00:48:10.741 --> 00:48:14.310
I was on the phone for fucking 90 mother fucking minutes.

806
00:48:14.311 --> 00:48:16.800
You with people in Southeast Asia.

807
00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:20.560
You didn't even know what hot and I was hockey.
Yeah,
you did really good.
Oh,

808
00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:24.860
very proud of you that day.
You were so calm.
You were so polite.

809
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:28.280
You didn't like freak out.
Oh,
you miss part of it when you left.
I was just like,

810
00:48:28.281 --> 00:48:30.200
listen.
Yeah,
I know.
I'm not trying to be a jerk,

811
00:48:30.201 --> 00:48:33.140
but like this is your second language and you don't even know what the sport is.

812
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:37.430
I'm talking,
this would be like if you called me up and I,
you know Rosetta stone,

813
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:41.900
how you speak and you,
you want to watch cricket or is that this is Joe.
Yeah,

814
00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:46.280
and they would just,
she just goes,
I'm sorry,
I'm in Asia.

815
00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:49.150
Is that going to be a problem?
And then I felt bad.
I'm like,
no,
it's not a prom.

816
00:48:49.151 --> 00:48:52.730
You,
you know what I'm saying?
She goes,
no,
I get it.
She was actually great.

817
00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:56.330
The first person was a fucking idiot.
It wasn't a fucking idiot.

818
00:48:56.331 --> 00:48:59.530
He just was not a smart person.
He,

819
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:03.320
he lacked the tools for that situation.
So now I have,
I have to do it.

820
00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:04.400
There's so many fucking,

821
00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:08.660
if you knew the amount of fucking money that I throw away because I don't want

822
00:49:08.661 --> 00:49:10.850
to deal with the infrastructure.
Right.

823
00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:14.480
The amount of times I've bought a plane ticket,
okay,

824
00:49:14.481 --> 00:49:17.780
I buy a fucking plane ticket and then the thing gets canceled and I don't go,

825
00:49:17.781 --> 00:49:20.090
I don't call up.
I just eat the price of the ticket.

826
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:22.340
I do it to all the fucking time.

827
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:27.910
All the fucking time because I am not going to www.delta.org I'm not fucking

828
00:49:29.481 --> 00:49:32.000
dude.
I'm not doing it.
Your travel person do it.

829
00:49:32.001 --> 00:49:35.450
Like when I wasn't able to go to to Nashville,

830
00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:37.640
I emailed her and I said,

831
00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:42.590
I'm not able to go and then I'll get it know it.
I thought,
I hate that ticket.
No,

832
00:49:42.591 --> 00:49:44.180
and she's like,
I'm going to cancel it.

833
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:48.860
And I said I'm going to get a note from my doctor and so maybe we'll be able to

834
00:49:48.861 --> 00:49:51.110
get reimbursed.
And she was like,
yeah,
I just canceled it.

835
00:49:51.111 --> 00:49:55.460
Like let me know and we'll do what we can.
I literally like,
I think I'm paying,

836
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:58.730
I paid for a hotel room Sunday night cause we were going to be there through

837
00:49:58.731 --> 00:49:59.720
Sunday night.
Yeah,

838
00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:05.020
in rather than just stopping at the fucking front desk and just dealing with

839
00:50:05.421 --> 00:50:09.960
that.
I just leave.
You never check out.
I don't check out.

840
00:50:09.961 --> 00:50:13.500
You never do like the hi,
I'm leaving.
How was your stay enjoyable?

841
00:50:13.501 --> 00:50:15.520
You just fuck I leave walk.

842
00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:21.240
I'm just like,
wait,
don't we have to check out?
You're like,
Eh,

843
00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.280
don't send me a bill.
They'll figure it out.

844
00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:26.650
You never take the time to check out.

845
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:31.010
There's only the only person I know that doesn't go down there and it's like,

846
00:50:31.011 --> 00:50:35.120
okay,
goodbye.
I'm leaving.
Here's the key sealand.
Are you just fucking gone?

847
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:38.540
Just leave.
I've done that with like rental cars.

848
00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:44.380
One time I got so shit faced so late into the night and I didn't realize that as

849
00:50:44.681 --> 00:50:48.770
6:00 AM flight,
I got up and I was still drunk and I was like,
I can't fucking,
I,

850
00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:53.210
I tried to drive as I can't drive and my gps wasn't working because I was in

851
00:50:53.211 --> 00:50:58.070
like fucking,
you know,
elk,
deer,
fucking Montana or some shit.

852
00:50:58.071 --> 00:51:02.030
I was up in Canada.
Oh dear.
You know,
yellow knife,
you know,

853
00:51:02.031 --> 00:51:05.480
they have all that shit.
They're like,
they're like us.
You know,

854
00:51:05.481 --> 00:51:08.420
they wiped out the Indians and then they just named shit after him to make

855
00:51:08.421 --> 00:51:11.360
themselves feel better.
Right.
No,

856
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:15.740
we didn't do it like us Canadians.
Well,
like white people,
right?
Yeah.

857
00:51:15.741 --> 00:51:19.550
You're not included watching Trump rally.
You're not a part of that.

858
00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:24.080
So anyways,
like,
yeah,
I remember one time was,
and I just,

859
00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:26.930
I gave the keys to the guy at the hotel.
I go,
Hey,

860
00:51:26.931 --> 00:51:30.230
can you take that back from me up to drug gay?
I'll fucking worry about it.

861
00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:32.510
I was so fucking shit faced

862
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:38.510
that liked when two weeks later they called me up going,
yeah,

863
00:51:38.511 --> 00:51:43.490
where's the car?
I was sitting there and I always give a fake number,
right.

864
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.020
So I'm like,
what do you mean why I brought it back.

865
00:51:45.021 --> 00:51:49.670
How the fuck do you get this number?
Leave me alone.
They're like,
sir,
it,

866
00:51:49.671 --> 00:51:53.000
it hasn't come back yet.
I go,
I fucking,
I dropped it off.

867
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:56.140
I just kept hanging up on him and I don't know,
it was,

868
00:51:56.141 --> 00:51:57.920
there was something like the third time they called,

869
00:51:57.921 --> 00:52:00.980
I finally was just like started thinking.
I was just like,
wait a minute,

870
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:05.920
did I bring that back?
And I called up Versie and I was like,
firstly,

871
00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:09.440
do we bring that car back?
And he was just like,
aw dude,
I don't know.

872
00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:11.750
I don't remember.
Cause you know,
cause he was,
you know,

873
00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:16.610
we were all pretty fucking,
we were out there and a barn and couldn't remember.

874
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:19.070
And then I was just like,
wait a minute dude.

875
00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.760
There was a Gig I did and I gave the keys to someone at the hotel.

876
00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.280
Who is that?
That gig?

877
00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:29.000
And then we figured out that there was that Gig and then they drove down and it

878
00:52:29.001 --> 00:52:31.970
was sitting there.
That costs me like 1200 bucks.

879
00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:42.450
Do you realize the house we could be living in Dick,
you as no,
I do.

880
00:52:42.451 --> 00:52:43.920
It is so I do.

881
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:47.880
It calls the fucking time because I don't give a shit.

882
00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:49.980
I don't keep t to money.

883
00:52:49.981 --> 00:52:54.070
To me is just you just writing a number on a piece of paper and it's just like,

884
00:52:54.071 --> 00:52:57.390
it's just,
if you just get past the fact that it actually has value,

885
00:52:57.510 --> 00:53:01.620
do you know what?
If you just listen,
you're in to be even to be saying that.

886
00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:02.670
I've always been that way.

887
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:06.810
He dollars a month is a lot to a lot of people to just be throwing away,

888
00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:11.760
you know what I mean?
Like that's the don't kill me because Nia,
I fucked timeout,

889
00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:16.290
timeout it.
Oh fuck that Nigga.
Fuck that.
I didn't know anybody in this business.

890
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:20.120
I didn't take the safe fucking route.
Okay,
and go for the fucking,

891
00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:22.440
I'm going to go do something else.
I've fought the riots.

892
00:53:22.441 --> 00:53:25.980
If blow $50 a month on a number of the,
it's my fucking money.

893
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.780
<v 1>I fight.
I don't want to fucking deal with that shit.</v>

894
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:32.100
I tried to be in the office area.
I wore a fucking tie.

895
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:35.910
I tried to do it.
I sat in on meetings and I literally just,

896
00:53:35.911 --> 00:53:38.370
all I would think about,
it's like the,
whoever was talking,

897
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:40.260
I wanted to run right at them,

898
00:53:40.261 --> 00:53:43.340
dive over their shoulder right through the fucking window and nose,

899
00:53:43.341 --> 00:53:46.590
dive into the fucking parking lot.
I can't live in that fucking world.

900
00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:51.330
So I picked this shit.
We're 99.9% of people fail.

901
00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:54.210
All right?
So I took all of my chips.

902
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:58.740
I put it on the fucking Zillion to one shot and in fucking came in and one of

903
00:53:58.741 --> 00:54:00.150
the parks of my fucking business,

904
00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:03.280
<v 6>I don't check out.
I walk out,</v>

905
00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:08.730
I walk out.
I don't want to talk to you.
I fucking hate when I get into it.

906
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:10.170
<v 7>Fucking just leave me alone.</v>

907
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:15.930
Just leave me the fuck the anybody who's like,

911

<v 1>No,

912
00:54:28.671 --> 00:54:32.570
I hate when I check into a hotel and then there's a phone call and you pick up.

913
00:54:32.571 --> 00:54:33.360
Hello.
Oh Hey.
Hi,

914
00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.910
Mr. Just checking to make sure everything was all right and no wrong.

915
00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:40.630
<v 7>This is like mud.
You Ain't room.
You hate the housekeeping service.</v>

916
00:54:40.631 --> 00:54:43.720
Turn Down Service.
You hate all of that.

917
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:48.080
<v 6>Oh my God.
When I,
my last one,
like the lady was coming in,
I'm like,</v>

918
00:54:48.081 --> 00:54:51.170
she's not going to die.
Jai Ram showing I'm like,
I'm all right.
I'm a ride.

919
00:54:51.171 --> 00:54:56.050
She just kept coming up
like get high here.

920
00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:59.070
I feel like I paid for that fucking room.

921
00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:01.480
I got the sign hanging out on the other,
swept up by,

922
00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:04.470
have to have a guard out there.
He wants to be left alone

923
00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:08.180
with the fuck.
What the fuck does that mean?
Is,

924
00:55:08.181 --> 00:55:11.490
is everything all right with the rum?
First of all,
I'm an adult.
If there was,

925
00:55:11.491 --> 00:55:14.940
yeah,
there's fun.
I'm glad you called.
There's water pouring in.

926
00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:20.190
I didn't know what to do.
The fucking room is fine.

927
00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:21.600
The bed is on the ground.

928
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:27.390
There's a mattress and I lie on it.
I know how to use everything in here.

929
00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:28.943
That's it.

930
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:32.940
<v 7>Oh,
that's it.
Whenever we go to hotels,</v>

931
00:55:32.941 --> 00:55:36.720
if we're on vacation or anything,
and I'm like,
Bill,
can you,

932
00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:41.770
especially if in a foreign country,
I might bill,
can you call down and you know,

933
00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:44.220
ask them if they can make reservations or whatever.

934
00:55:44.221 --> 00:55:46.890
If it's like a different language bill,
always Gus,
not enough.

935
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:49.160
You're better at that stuff than I am.
I'm like,

936
00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:54.000
all you have to do is ask them to do something.
And he's like,

937
00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:58.110
no,
no,
no,
I can't.
I can't.
You have to do,
I'm not good with it.
I'm not good at

938
00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:03.170
<v 1>it was funny.
I actually,
well,
I got to Nashville so early,
right?
Um,</v>

939
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:07.250
and I,
I went into like the sky lounge thing.
Am I going to say the airline?

940
00:56:07.251 --> 00:56:10.400
I always fly,
right?
But I,
I've,
you know,
I finally,

941
00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:14.870
somebody convinced me to fucking,
you know,
go into the Sky Lounge area.
Right?

942
00:56:14.871 --> 00:56:17.080
So I guy and I'll fucking do that.
But then the stupid,

943
00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:20.510
but that thing is fucking stupid because then you have to get to the airport

944
00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:24.100
early to make it worth it.
It's like I don't want to be here.

945
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.500
I want to get here as late as possible.

946
00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:30.370
Immediately get on the plane and get the fuck Outta here.
Right.
So anyways,

947
00:56:30.371 --> 00:56:32.590
I got really,
they're really early to Nashville.

948
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:34.750
Didn't know that my fucking plane was going to catch on fire.

949
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:38.380
So I go in there and they'd go,
uh,
I go,
yeah,
I got,
you know,

950
00:56:38.381 --> 00:56:41.860
I don't have my card on me.
And then they go,
you know,
what's your name?

951
00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:45.370
What was the name of your goldfish?
And all of that fucking shit.

952
00:56:45.371 --> 00:56:48.640
And I go through all of that and then she,
she looks up,
she goes,
oh,
here you are.

953
00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:54.010
And um,
I never use miles either.
That's another thing.
I always get miles,

954
00:56:54.011 --> 00:56:55.600
but I've never used them.
Yeah.

955
00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:58.600
Cause I don't want to go on the fucking website and deal with all the,
I just,

956
00:56:58.601 --> 00:57:03.580
well how much does it cost?
I'll write it on this piece of paper and fuck off.

957
00:57:03.581 --> 00:57:08.230
Right.
So she looks in and their eyes just go like,
like biggest sausage.

958
00:57:08.231 --> 00:57:10.510
She goes,
you have 824,000

959
00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:11.443
<v 6>freaking</v>

960
00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:19.730
gold.
I thought you haven't used your water.

961
00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:24.650
I ain't going on the fucking website that you use miles.

962
00:57:24.651 --> 00:57:28.730
In the past when I first started flying with you two gigs,

963
00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:29.690
then you use them.

964
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:31.340
<v 1>When I was making no money,</v>

965
00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:35.780
when I made no fucking money and then we were going to go on vacation and I

966
00:57:35.781 --> 00:57:39.740
wanted to fly first class I would use up.
They would use up all of my miles,

967
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:44.390
but then once I started making money it's like I don't have to fucking deal with

968
00:57:44.391 --> 00:57:47.900
that anymore.
I hated doing that because I call my travel agents like,
oh,

969
00:57:47.901 --> 00:57:52.230
I'm sorry I can't do that.
You have to log on juice,
go to fucking content.

970
00:57:52.231 --> 00:57:56.090
Nice to fly continental how to Newark all the time.
You'd have to go to apnea.
I,

971
00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.940
I'm not good at it.
I fucking hate it.
I would rather,

972
00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:03.040
I would rather just just just

973
00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:06.270
<v 6>give,
give you the money.
You have to ask our travel person to do it.</v>

974
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:09.930
Do you know that when I went to meet,
you know when I went to Chicago,

975
00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:11.310
I get over a million to the pilots,

976
00:58:11.311 --> 00:58:13.990
come back and say hello like a they did with George Clooney in that moment.

977
00:58:13.991 --> 00:58:18.780
Maybe I'm getting up there,
you getting up there,
but um,
I got,

978
00:58:18.781 --> 00:58:23.740
I got bumped or something like that.
And so they give a,

979
00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:28.110
they give you the voucher,
like it's a $300 voucher and whenever,
whatever it is,

980
00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:31.290
$300 voucher.
Do you know I took that,

981
00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:35.700
I scanned it and I emailed it to her and I said,
by the way,

982
00:58:35.701 --> 00:58:40.580
I got this voucher so if you can use it towards bills next flight.

983
00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:43.380
And she was like,
oh great.
Actually I can,
I'm like,

984
00:58:43.381 --> 00:58:47.700
so on top of that shit you would have been like,
and it's fucking van.

985
00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:50.910
How many times I got a voucher and a track.
I've never,
no,
I lose it.

986
00:58:50.911 --> 00:58:55.020
I don't even know where it is.
Yeah,
no,
I held my,
some old lady and cat food.

987
00:58:56.070 --> 00:59:00.090
Once again,
this is something that like most people would be like,
oh good,

988
00:59:00.091 --> 00:59:04.190
I can use this.
Towards the next thing and you're just like,
why no ass with it?

989
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:07.590
I don't know.
Wiping my ass with it and yet,
look how I dress like I live,

990
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:11.040
but get quarter one dress like Malcolm young on the powerage tour.

991
00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:16.490
Some old white dudes get that reference I just,
I live with within

992
00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:21.420
<v 1>my fucking means and it affords me an ability to not have to sit.
There you go.</v>

993
00:59:22.170 --> 00:59:23.003
<v 7>Sure.</v>

994
00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:30.430
<v 6>All right.
Sorry.
The batteries just died there.
I had to cut this up.
First of all,</v>

995
00:59:30.431 --> 00:59:35.050
you,
you're making it seem like I'm this spoiled rich kid who goes around burning

996
00:59:35.051 --> 00:59:37.330
hunt like lighting $100 bills on fire.

997
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:41.510
I've always fucking been that way.
I've never,
like when I,

998
00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:45.760
when I wasn't making any fucking money and I was staying at the old show della

999
00:59:45.761 --> 00:59:48.310
super way back in the day,
right?

1000
00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:51.130
And they'd always have like the continental breakfast and you've got to get down

1001
00:59:51.131 --> 00:59:54.850
here by 10:00 AM and I did it like one time and I'm standing in line with all

1002
00:59:54.851 --> 00:59:58.570
these people with these fucking old loafers hoping they're not going to run out

1003
00:59:58.571 --> 01:00:02.780
of batter for the welcome waffles.
I'm just sitting there going like,

1004
01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:06.940
I can go to Denny's like a gentleman and just sit down and order a fucking

1005
01:00:06.941 --> 01:00:10.540
waffle.
I don't need a free fucking waffle.
You know what I mean?

1006
01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:15.280
That's like miserly shit to me and get a voucher.
All of that shit.

1007
01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:19.570
I'm not,
I'm like on one time I was so fucking mad,

1008
01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:23.350
they fucked me over so bad on this plane that I actually did that Old Lady Shit.

1009
01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.510
And I,
and I walked in and I was like,

1010
01:00:25.511 --> 01:00:27.720
I had been waiting and I paid for this and Blah,

1011
01:00:27.721 --> 01:00:31.750
Blah Blah and my bag took all this fucking time.
And then they would just like,

1012
01:00:31.751 --> 01:00:34.570
all right,
all right.
You know,
you've got to go on the website.
And I was like,

1013
01:00:34.571 --> 01:00:36.750
I know what she cause you don't think I'm going to do it.
You know,

1014
01:00:36.751 --> 01:00:37.541
I think I'm going to do it.

1015
01:00:37.541 --> 01:00:41.600
It went home and I fucking did it and I took all of that time and then there
was,

1016
01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:42.970
you know,
they just kept calling,
you know,

1017
01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:46.800
emailing me back and I kept having a confirmed shit and then I find just set
off,

1018
01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:50.980
fuck it.
I just,
I don't have the,
I don't have that fight in me.

1019
01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.211
You know what I mean?

1020
01:00:52.211 --> 01:00:57.211
Like I don't wait for sales or any of that shit if I need it,

1021
01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.060
I go in and I fucking buy it and whatever it costs me.

1022
01:01:01.061 --> 01:01:03.970
If that means I can't do something else in my life,
I just won't do that.

1023
01:01:03.971 --> 01:01:05.590
But like you for me,

1024
01:01:05.591 --> 01:01:10.020
you cannot put a price on getting that over with as quick as fuck

1025
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:13.510
<v 7>possible.
Yeah.
No,
I'm giving you a hard time,</v>

1026
01:01:13.511 --> 01:01:16.630
but you do have a very healthy attitude about money.

1027
01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:17.980
You're really good with money.

1028
01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:21.700
You've taught me a lot about being responsible about money,

1029
01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:27.030
but I think I have definitely that mentality of taking advantage of little stuff

1030
01:01:30.021 --> 01:01:33.650
like that and like,
oh my God,
this costs extra.
Like I have to cut it out.

1031
01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.120
Even if it does inconvenience me in some way.
Like I just have that,

1032
01:01:38.121 --> 01:01:42.740
I am a coupon person,
I am a sale person.
I'm always like,
but it was on sale.

1033
01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:44.510
It's discounted.
Like that's,

1034
01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.840
<v 6>I love that shit.
Yeah,
it was on sale.
Yeah it was still 700 bucks.</v>

1035
01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:53.960
So you go the other way but it was on sale.
I'll leave you your,

1036
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:56.070
your fucking shoes and shit.
All this shit.

1037
01:01:56.071 --> 01:01:59.850
That's everything that I buy for the most part is on sale.

1038
01:01:59.851 --> 01:02:04.170
I use so many discounted website but it's still expensive as shit.
Yeah,

1039
01:02:04.171 --> 01:02:06.740
but it's not as expensive.
Jesus Christ know.

1040
01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:10.080
I walk around and like American Airlines is going to give you a free peanut

1041
01:02:10.081 --> 01:02:13.230
butter and jelly sandwich cause the fucking pill was 20 minutes late and I'm

1042
01:02:13.231 --> 01:02:15.570
like,
hey dude,
you know what?
Keep your fucking sandwich,
uh,

1043
01:02:15.571 --> 01:02:18.600
by my own sandwich and you're making me act like I'm a fucking,
you know,

1044
01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:23.070
Trump or some shit and you're over there buying like a thousand dollar pair of

1045
01:02:23.071 --> 01:02:28.070
shoes.
Do we don't fucking sale
driving nuts with that shit.
All right.

1046
01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.630
I got to read some of the,
I haven't done any of the advertising.

1047
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.620
Let me see something.
And even doing down here this whole time,
Huh?

1048
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.680
Listening to the rats and the fucking wall.
Um,

1049
01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:43.920
for me,
I just feel like for me,

1050
01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:51.150
all right,
was he advertising here?
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.

1051
01:02:51.151 --> 01:02:55.570
I will tell you like,
I dunno,
like you know something,
uh,

1052
01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.570
there,
there's people that I grew up with that were really miserly like that,

1053
01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:01.531
you know,
and they didn't,

1054
01:03:01.531 --> 01:03:04.680
they didn't leave good tips and they just blahblahblahblahblah and she'd say,

1055
01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:06.690
she's fucking paper.
Just give it to them,

1056
01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:11.970
make them happy and let's get the fuck out.
But when you don't

1057
01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:18.030
have a lot of it,
you have to be miserly.

1058
01:03:18.031 --> 01:03:21.850
You have to find a way to like,
sir.
I mean,

1059
01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.620
you want to have some [inaudible] I moved to New York City,

1060
01:03:25.621 --> 01:03:30.360
I ate spaghetti every night.
I had a chair that became a fucking table.
I ate.

1061
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:35.160
I did that all the fucking time.
I can live on fucking nothing.
I did it,

1062
01:03:35.161 --> 01:03:35.994
but you know something.

1063
01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:40.770
I still had money in the bank as I saved up for my day jobs cause I knew New

1064
01:03:40.770 --> 01:03:43.740
York was going to be expensive and I wasn't going to be that fucking guy going,

1065
01:03:43.741 --> 01:03:46.830
Oh God,
you know I've done in my last 20 bucks.

1066
01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:48.840
How are you down to your last 20 bucks?

1067
01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:53.850
How did you get yourself into that fucking situation?
Okay,

1068
01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.220
I'm talking about white male,
heterosexual.

1069
01:03:56.221 --> 01:03:59.010
How to fuck did you get yourself in that situation?
You fucked up.

1070
01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:03.120
You fucked up your money.
You're an adult,
right?
So

1071
01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.740
you know how much money you make and you know what you fucking bills are,

1072
01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:11.750
but you know you start making money in for the first half of the month.
You,

1073
01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:12.000
you're,

1074
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.820
you're walking around acting like you make three times as much and then the end

1075
01:04:14.821 --> 01:04:18.960
of the fucking month you're going to come to me and act like a fucking pound

1076
01:04:18.961 --> 01:04:23.100
puppy.
Like you're,
you know,
like the world did you wrong?
It's like,
no,

1077
01:04:23.101 --> 01:04:27.990
you fucked yourself over.
I believe you guys say you played yourself.

1078
01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:32.070
He flinches.
Yeah.

1079
01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:36.030
That's why I hate going to the bank at the beginning of the month.
I hate it.

1080
01:04:36.031 --> 01:04:39.090
It's a bunch of people whose money is fucked up.
Okay.

1081
01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:43.080
And it's depressing to see because they should have been educated on how fucking

1082
01:04:43.081 --> 01:04:47.490
money works the first of the month when people get paid and their paydays.

1083
01:04:47.491 --> 01:04:51.270
Saturday's the day when the general fucking public goes in there.

1084
01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:56.490
Every fucking fifth Carson is in there yelling through that bulletproof glass

1085
01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:00.960
and can understand it's,
it's,
it's basic fucking math.

1086
01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:06.080
You put 200 in there,
you withdrew 200 so you don't,

1087
01:05:06.081 --> 01:05:07.440
you don't have any money left.

1088
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:14.760
I Dunno.
It's very rare that I fucking stick up for the banks,

1089
01:05:14.761 --> 01:05:18.370
but when there's fucking people in there,
I mean,
there's all information online.

1090
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:22.950
You know what I mean?
There's all this,
I dunno,
I dunno.

1091
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.290
I always had a job.
I have,
I had a paper route since I was in third grade.

1092
01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:30.640
And then I had money from my football cards and my candy bars.
I,
I had,

1093
01:05:30.641 --> 01:05:34.240
my overhead was fine.
And I remember my friends were always like,
oh,
I'm broke.

1094
01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:37.030
Oh fuck a broke.
I'd be like,
get a fucking paper route.
Oh,

1095
01:05:37.031 --> 01:05:39.190
I don't want to get up when they go fuck yourself.

1096
01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:43.360
It's supposed to feel bad for you because you can't get doubles at lunch.

1097
01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.250
You got to go to your mother.
How old are you?
Oh,
I mean,
are we ate?

1098
01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:50.560
We ate your thought.
Oh,

1099
01:05:50.561 --> 01:05:54.400
I'm on my fucking soapbox.
Right.
Everybody should live the way I do.

1100
01:05:54.730 --> 01:05:58.120
Enterprising bebe.
I wasn't enterprising.

1101
01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:01.750
I just fucking make money and then I always had it and I didn't blow it off.

1102
01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:04.270
The idea of you with a paper,

1103
01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:08.050
see you had money with for football cards and candies.

1104
01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:10.720
The cutest thing I've ever had was the greatest thing.

1105
01:06:10.721 --> 01:06:13.510
I love football cards and I used to go down,

1106
01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:17.590
I used to ride my bike up to the corner store and I would be,

1107
01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.660
I would sit there a little freckle faced me going to to two tops.

1108
01:06:20.661 --> 01:06:24.370
Football cards come out yet and they'd be like,
no,
I'm sorry.

1109
01:06:24.371 --> 01:06:28.330
I would check every single day.
When they came out.

1110
01:06:28.331 --> 01:06:30.300
Cue when I came out,

1111
01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:33.350
me and all my friends would buy him and then we'd sit there and train them and

1112
01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:38.140
stick in the big fucking piece of shit gum that they had that always fucked up

1113
01:06:38.141 --> 01:06:38.980
the football card,

1114
01:06:38.981 --> 01:06:42.400
usually your best one in the pack and you'd sit there and cut the roof of your

1115
01:06:42.401 --> 01:06:47.401
mouth is you're trying to chew it down and we would just sit there and root beer

1116
01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:52.420
candy.
Just all fucking sugar.
Yeah.
Just going through.
I got Bob Greasy,

1117
01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:57.100
I got Oj Simpson,
I,
Walter Payton,
all these guys were back then.
Randy White,

1118
01:06:57.610 --> 01:07:00.490
Jack Lambert,
I still remember all their names.
It was fucking great.

1119
01:07:00.491 --> 01:07:02.740
Robert Newhouse,
rest his soul.
Yes.

1120
01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:08.690
I used to make like $6 a fucking week.
I was loaded.
Oh,
that's online.

1121
01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:13.480
I was fucking loaded.
How old were you when you stare at the paper?

1122
01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.690
Third Grade.
Third Grade.
Third Grade,

1123
01:07:17.050 --> 01:07:21.010
and I kept it all the way to like freshmen in high school to the point of like,

1124
01:07:21.011 --> 01:07:23.590
you know when the child star,
it's just not cute anymore.

1125
01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:31.900
No one wants a six foot paper.
Boy,
I wasn't.
I'm not six feet tall,

1126
01:07:31.901 --> 01:07:34.870
but that's just a funny number.
Um,
yeah.
So then,
then I,

1127
01:07:34.871 --> 01:07:38.510
then I immediately went from that to then I just had like a,

1128
01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:40.300
there was this weird time.
I just didn't,

1129
01:07:40.301 --> 01:07:45.070
I didn't have a job cause I was too old to be a paper boy felt.
And then I was,

1130
01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:49.090
but I was too young to have a job.
Yeah.
Did you have a job in high school?

1131
01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:51.130
Well then there's,
so when I quit my paper route,

1132
01:07:51.131 --> 01:07:54.640
I didn't have any fucking money coming in and I was not used to that.

1133
01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.030
I hadn't dealt with that since I was way back in the second grade.

1134
01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:02.560
This was a crisis.
This is my first 2008 that I went through.

1135
01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:04.510
So I actually went down,

1136
01:08:04.810 --> 01:08:09.040
I think it was to the principal's office and I got a worker's permit that

1137
01:08:09.041 --> 01:08:11.420
allowed me to work under rage.

1138
01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:16.190
Is that what I did?
Yeah.
To get this job that I wanted.

1139
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.420
<v 1>And during the summertime I used to caddy.</v>

1140
01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:22.400
I used to caddy and I used to try to get doubles,

1141
01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.820
which is two bags and you know,

1142
01:08:25.821 --> 01:08:28.480
you'd just be running from one guy to another guy and hopefully,
you know,

1143
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:31.010
it was always really bad but one guy really fucking suck.

1144
01:08:31.011 --> 01:08:32.570
But if they both sucked it was brutal.

1145
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:36.050
If one guy slice the other guy hooked and they both were fucking righties that

1146
01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:39.290
that was going to be a long afternoon for you.
And um,

1147
01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:41.810
yeah I used to do that,
you know,

1148
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:45.200
and it was a couple of live of hearing and the like your childhood stuff that

1149
01:08:45.201 --> 01:08:48.530
you did.
I just like,
it's just so funny to me because now I'm pitching.

1150
01:08:48.531 --> 01:08:53.531
At first I pictured you little cutie freckle faith with your cards and your

1151
01:08:53.781 --> 01:08:56.930
bubble gum and year my orange hair,

1152
01:08:57.830 --> 01:09:02.180
I looked like a little fucking,
there's no such thing as an adorable scare crow.

1153
01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:03.380
That's what the fuck I look like.

1154
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:10.010
And now you're like a high school kid running around the golf course at two golf

1155
01:09:10.011 --> 01:09:13.760
bags on you.
So you literally have worked your entire life.

1156
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.730
Then I got this job at this place called more shoe and we were doing the tissue

1157
01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:19.800
and it was like,

1158
01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.740
will I just meant this was the worst fucking job I ever had as far as just like

1159
01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:26.660
mind numbingly fucking,
it felt like 20 hours.

1160
01:09:26.661 --> 01:09:28.850
It was like a to two hours at the end of every school day.

1161
01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:33.140
I take the bus over and then I would fucking walk home like two miles or some

1162
01:09:33.141 --> 01:09:35.360
shit like that.
Back when you used to do that as a kid,

1163
01:09:35.361 --> 01:09:39.410
just walk along a fucking highway and nobody gave a fuck.
Right.
And uh,

1164
01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:43.490
they had like these little cards,
these computer cards with numbers on them.

1165
01:09:43.491 --> 01:09:46.460
And you had these order forms and you had these little Manila envelopes.

1166
01:09:46.461 --> 01:09:47.840
I still don't know what the fuck it was.

1167
01:09:47.841 --> 01:09:50.870
It was something for them to then feed into this computer.

1168
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:55.670
This is like 1984 or some shit.
I hated that job.

1169
01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:58.120
Um,
then I,

1170
01:09:58.121 --> 01:10:01.840
then I got into warehousing and when I got into warehousing,

1171
01:10:01.841 --> 01:10:03.430
then I got my first loan.

1172
01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:08.410
My Dad cosigned the loan and I in the car for the car.
Yeah.

1173
01:10:08.411 --> 01:10:10.960
But I put all the down payment.
He didn't pay a dime of it.

1174
01:10:10.961 --> 01:10:12.010
I bought the whole fuck.

1175
01:10:12.011 --> 01:10:16.600
I got a three year loan from Danvers Savings Bank,

1176
01:10:16.810 --> 01:10:19.780
one cone and street.
I still remember writing the thing.

1177
01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.810
It was one 38 63 a month still.

1178
01:10:22.811 --> 01:10:26.830
Remember that shit paid that whole fucking thing off.
Uh,

1179
01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:30.280
ended up getting another paper route with the truck where I would,

1180
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:33.290
I would drive in the morning and just went back to the paper route.

1181
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:36.040
But I think your foot,
I did the warehousing during the day.
No.

1182
01:10:36.041 --> 01:10:39.760
Then I had two jobs and I was also a,

1183
01:10:39.761 --> 01:10:43.300
then I got rid of that thing just cause my friends tease me,
Oh,

1184
01:10:43.301 --> 01:10:45.400
what are you a fucking paper boy.
And it felt stupid.

1185
01:10:45.401 --> 01:10:49.690
It was wait a second extra hundred bucks a week.
Four,
it's huge.
Right?

1186
01:10:49.691 --> 01:10:51.940
So I ended up quitting that and um,

1187
01:10:53.610 --> 01:10:57.870
the fuck did I go from there?
I tried selling newspaper subscriptions.

1188
01:10:58.570 --> 01:11:02.610
What?
Telemarketing type of job.
Yeah,
I had that.
But when I went to college,

1189
01:11:02.611 --> 01:11:07.050
I went to college part time and I paid for my education and uh,

1190
01:11:07.051 --> 01:11:10.440
all the way to like buy my last year,
uh,

1191
01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:14.460
my parents helped me out with that and I also got a loan from another family

1192
01:11:14.461 --> 01:11:16.590
friend,
but,
and I paid all of them back.

1193
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:21.580
I paid all of them back before I moved down to New York now.
Then I start,
once I,

1194
01:11:21.581 --> 01:11:23.880
when I started doing standup,
I also had a day job

1195
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:25.640
<v 0>and uh,</v>

1196
01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:29.790
<v 1>and I was still living at home and I was still driving that piece of shit truck</v>

1197
01:11:29.791 --> 01:11:32.310
that I bought an 85 red truck.
Right,
right.

1198
01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:34.110
And I drove that thing for 10 fucking years.

1199
01:11:34.111 --> 01:11:38.310
And I remember when the engine died and I was at work and somebody was going

1200
01:11:38.311 --> 01:11:40.230
like,
so now what are you going to do,
Yo,
what are you going to buy?

1201
01:11:40.231 --> 01:11:42.720
And I was thinking of buying and I was going to buy like a Toyota Corolla,

1202
01:11:42.721 --> 01:11:45.840
just something like a comic car that could,
you know,
go like 200,000 miles.

1203
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:49.590
And I find it was just like,
fuck this man.
I know I want to move to New York.

1204
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:53.310
I could spend like,
you know,
like a new car,
like a Corolla back then was like,

1205
01:11:53.311 --> 01:11:55.710
this is early nineties.
It was like,
it was like 12,
11,
12 grand,

1206
01:11:55.711 --> 01:12:00.030
which was a ton of fucking money,
especially for me at that time.
And uh,

1207
01:12:01.730 --> 01:12:05.210
or I could just spend 1500 bucks and have them rip the engine out and put a new

1208
01:12:05.211 --> 01:12:08.330
one in.
So that's what I did.
And I just remember this woman at work,

1209
01:12:08.331 --> 01:12:10.820
I've told this story before,
she just said,
she goes,
where's the new car?

1210
01:12:10.821 --> 01:12:12.800
They'll be a new car.
Said,
ah,
you know what?
I just,

1211
01:12:12.801 --> 01:12:15.380
I just had a new one just putting my truck and sten she just made this face.

1212
01:12:15.381 --> 01:12:19.430
He was just like,
that was stupid.
Fucking walked away.

1213
01:12:19.431 --> 01:12:21.920
And she was really beautiful too.
And I was just like,
you know what,

1214
01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:25.850
it probably was stupid because I guess if I got the new car,
could've bagged you.

1215
01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:29.790
I Dunno.
So,
um,
so I had that truck and that,

1216
01:12:29.791 --> 01:12:32.510
that was the one like the last,
my first three years of comedy,

1217
01:12:32.511 --> 01:12:35.120
I drove around doing that thing.
Uh,
that's when I met Patrice.

1218
01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.580
He wrote everybody that I knew from back then rode around in that thing.

1219
01:12:37.581 --> 01:12:39.590
And then a long story short,

1220
01:12:39.591 --> 01:12:42.200
there was an electrical fire and it burned down right before I moved to New
York,

1221
01:12:42.201 --> 01:12:45.080
which was fine,
cause having a car in New York is a pain in the ass.

1222
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:49.880
So when I moved down in New York,
I had no debt.
I paid off my student loans.

1223
01:12:49.881 --> 01:12:54.060
I had no credit card debt.
I had,
I had got myself out by like 700,

1224
01:12:54.061 --> 01:12:56.990
the evolving 700 bucks with the credit card debt.

1225
01:12:57.170 --> 01:13:01.670
I just got myself out of it and I didn't buy anything.
I was like,
Jimmy,
the Gent,

1226
01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:04.580
take it back.
Don't buy anything.
Don't fucking,

1227
01:13:04.581 --> 01:13:09.170
if I could seek any advice to any young person out there,
okay.

1228
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:12.440
When you're young is when they give you those credit cards,
man,

1229
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:16.510
do not fucking rack those.
And if you have,
you've got to knock those,

1230
01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:21.380
knock those fucking things down.
Yeah.
Okay.
You know,

1231
01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:25.460
figure out what the fuck you want to do before you were involved in some sort of

1232
01:13:25.461 --> 01:13:29.450
serious relationship,
which is going to be like,
what?
I want to live here.

1233
01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:32.750
Fuck all of that.
Get on the path.
You want to get on.

1234
01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:36.910
Eat Your fucking spaghetti in the morning.
You know,
whatever you got.

1235
01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.900
Whatever you got to fucking do.

1236
01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:42.110
If you've got to deliver papers in the fucking morning and all this other shit

1237
01:13:42.111 --> 01:13:44.580
to do it,
I don't know.

1238
01:13:44.581 --> 01:13:47.570
It's maybe then you too can have fucking nine cell phone numbers.

1239
01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:51.950
They may not want to get on the phone.
Can you help me with that?
Can you,

1240
01:13:51.951 --> 01:13:53.910
seriously,
you helped me with that.
Can you just can use it?

1241
01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:58.160
Can you just like do that for me?
Yes.
I mean,
um,
I can,

1242
01:13:58.190 --> 01:14:00.980
I can get through half of it for you,

1243
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:04.150
but then eventually you're just being in the background and when,

1244
01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:07.100
when they asked the questions,
yeah,
I will help you do that.

1245
01:14:07.101 --> 01:14:09.710
Cause it's ridiculous that you're continuing to pay for that.
That's,

1246
01:14:09.730 --> 01:14:12.160
that's what I also thought too because I thought

1247
01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:16.690
<v 6>I signed a contract well on them so I'm worried that they can't get out.</v>

1248
01:14:17.230 --> 01:14:20.510
There's always ways to negotiate your ways out of that.
Like I'm,

1249
01:14:20.511 --> 01:14:24.390
I'm good at that stuff.
Yeah.
Tell him that I died.
No,
I'm not going to do,

1250
01:14:24.810 --> 01:14:26.700
you're taking over the thing because then they'll feel bad.

1251
01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:32.170
What can we'll figure it out without telling anybody that you die.
Well,

1252
01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:35.920
I'm done for the fucking year as far as gigs.
She want to do that.
Let's,
let's,

1253
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:40.270
let's get rid of those other two.
Yeah.
I want to see what my bill's going to do.

1254
01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:44.830
Any like extra shit.
You're paying for it because you don't want to deal.
Yeah,

1255
01:14:44.831 --> 01:14:48.010
let's,
let's take care of that place though.
I have a lot of shit like that.

1256
01:14:48.130 --> 01:14:52.150
There's other things that I'm in.
When I bought,
when I bought this laptop,

1257
01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:53.560
I was just,
they were like,

1258
01:14:53.561 --> 01:14:56.490
do you want to take any classes or anything like that and blah blah,

1259
01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:59.110
and I signed up for all of them too.
What do you mean?

1260
01:14:59.350 --> 01:15:01.660
Like the apple store classes.

1261
01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:04.810
So like teach you how to fucking get better at this shit.
God.

1262
01:15:04.811 --> 01:15:09.580
Like you were ever actually going to do that?
Nope.
Never even went once.
Oh,

1263
01:15:09.581 --> 01:15:10.301
did you tell,

1264
01:15:10.301 --> 01:15:14.710
did you tell the listeners how you ordered like 20 of those adapters for your

1265
01:15:14.711 --> 01:15:19.711
new iPhone seven know what I did was I was so mad that I ordered five of them

1266
01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:25.330
and then they were just like,
yeah,
it's going to be 10 business days.

1267
01:15:25.331 --> 01:15:28.060
And I was like,
fuck,
I can't listen to my music for 10 days.

1268
01:15:28.061 --> 01:15:30.970
How am I going to get through my workout?
And then the next day I went,

1269
01:15:30.971 --> 01:15:34.270
I drove down to the apple store and then they had a bunch of them.
So I said,

1270
01:15:34.271 --> 01:15:35.104
fuck it.

1271
01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:39.280
And I bought five there and now when I came back I got another five.

1272
01:15:39.281 --> 01:15:40.114
So now I've got tenable.

1273
01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:46.870
Is what you're married near?
Leave waste of money again,

1274
01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:49.480
not a complete waste of money.
All right,
well good.

1275
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:52.270
Well it's a good thing I got advertising here so I can fucking blow it on all my

1276
01:15:52.271 --> 01:15:56.320
cell phone numbers and adapters.
All right,
blue apron,
everybody.

1277
01:15:56.350 --> 01:16:00.400
Oh Jesus.
Do you ever get hungry?
Sure.
We all do.

1278
01:16:00.401 --> 01:16:02.440

What does our Tizzano mean?
You know what,
I'm not sure mining.

1285
01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:26.020
That means you work for yourself.
Family run farms,
fisheries and ranchers.

1286
01:16:26.021 --> 01:16:30.250
You're an artist with food,
right?
Whether it's Japanese ramen noodles,

1287
01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:35.350
wildcard,

1290
01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:44.050
Well,
if I can skip this shit,
I will.
I was going to say,

1291
01:16:44.051 --> 01:16:46.970
I don't think he's supposed to read that part.
Um,

1292
01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:50.470
new recipes are created weekly and are not repeated within a year.

1293
01:16:50.471 --> 01:16:51.304
I think that's cool.

1294
01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:55.150
Choose your meals from a variety of recipes or let blue apron culinary team

1299
01:17:15.081 --> 01:17:19.910
The foot fit your needs.
Put it in my,
sorry.
There's no weekly commitment.

1300
01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:24.830
There's people out there near,
that's how they want their pork shop delivered.

1301
01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:28.190
So you only get deliveries when you want them.

1302
01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.410
Each meal comes with a step by step,

1304
01:17:34.911 --> 01:17:39.470
minutes or less.
Um,
all right.
They wait.
That's like Rachel Ray.

1305
01:17:39.471 --> 01:17:42.230
I make 20 minute meals.
Yeah,
I'm just,
I'm sure yet though,

1306
01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:45.380
it's all fucking worked out.
You've got 12 ovens in the background.

1307
01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.430
You fucking asshole.

1308
01:17:47.190 --> 01:17:49.940
They always tell you always takes at least an hour to do a Rachel Ray may have,

1309
01:17:49.941 --> 01:17:54.650
doesn't it?
Eboo extra virgin olive oil.
She would do that every fucking time.

1310
01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:57.080
Why abbreviated?
If you're just going to say it,
Rachel,

1311
01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:00.920
I think some of your highlighters leaked in your brain there.

1312
01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:03.980
Why are you dragging me into range?
What does she have her do?
Dude,

1313
01:18:03.981 --> 01:18:07.740
I said that she was fucking hot way before everybody.
Before she,
she,

1314
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:12.110
she did the j Lo Makeover.
She did the white girl version of it,
you know?
Well,

1315
01:18:12.111 --> 01:18:15.260
you know,
j Lo kind of looked like Selena in real life,
right?

1316
01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:18.650
Was it just when she was on,
she was one of the fly girls,
right?
Yeah.

1317
01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:22.070
And then when,
then when she was going to go mainstream,

1318
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:26.930
they said they lightened her all up.
Right?
Well,
she did the same thing.

1319
01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:28.933
What are you talking?

1320
01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:32.180
I'm saying she was all Brunette and she was just kind of walking around the

1321
01:18:32.181 --> 01:18:36.520
kitchen and no one was paying attention.
And then she,
she,
she liked it.

1322
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:39.170
You got to have the little bit that you've got up the blonde streak in your
hair.

1323
01:18:39.171 --> 01:18:42.260
You can't look the same as when you started out as,
when you get famous.

1324
01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:47.090
That's why Aerosmith made it because Joe Perry had that little blonde streak in

1325
01:18:47.091 --> 01:18:51.140
his hair.
They were looking right past Steven Tyler,
the like,
who is that guy?

1326
01:18:51.710 --> 01:18:55.040
We got to sign this band.
That's a true story.

All right,
seat Geek.
Oh,
we've got another seating people here.

1333
01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:19.190
Last one didn't work out so well.
Let's see how long these people last.
Oh my God,

1334
01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.720
we're the last people.
I think the Fed's rated them or something.

1335
01:19:22.721 --> 01:19:25.700
Something happened.
I don't know.
I can't even tell Siki.
Oh,

1336
01:19:25.701 --> 01:19:28.370
these guys are actually not a predatory thing.
These guys are cool.

1337
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:29.180
From what I heard,

1338
01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:33.410
buying tickets online for sports and concerts has been a confusing process for a

1339
01:19:33.411 --> 01:19:34.244
long time.

1340
01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:38.540
It's always been hard to find the best deal for that game or show you want to go

1341
01:19:38.541 --> 01:19:42.380
to and none of those older tickets sites want to change that.

1342
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:43.940
But seek geek is different.

1343

1344

1345
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:55.370

I just realized this thing's really long.

1413
01:24:13.690 --> 01:24:16.300
This podcast has been really long and you sitting there reminiscing.
I was like,

1414
01:24:16.301 --> 01:24:20.110
Yep.
I enjoyed that.
That was a wonderful moment that I had with you moving on.

1415
01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:23.370
It was in those moments that I knew I wanted to marry you.
All right.

1416
01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:28.630
Is that true?
Not,

some shit.
I don't tell the listeners.

1417
01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:31.400
I know when I was going to decide to marry you.
All right.
Yeah.

1418
01:24:31.410 --> 01:24:35.440
And they're not going to hear when that one's for us.
Alright.
Websites,

1419
01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:37.270
suggestions.
Oh,
I said,
you know,

1420
01:24:37.330 --> 01:24:40.660
I'm always go to the same fucking five websites and now that had been kicked off

1421
01:24:40.661 --> 01:24:44.010
Facebook unless I give him my fucking passport number.
That's the thing.

1422
01:24:44.650 --> 01:24:49.270
This is the thing I'm telling you here.
You always go walk,
you fucking walk.

1423
01:24:49.330 --> 01:24:53.500
Did you talk about the whole,
uh,
fingerprint thing?
Oh,
when I bought the car,
yeah.

1424
01:24:53.501 --> 01:24:56.900
When I bought my but my Jaguar,
they ask me for that for a thumbprint,

1425
01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:58.170
<v 7>like a fingerprint.</v>

1426
01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:02.410
Why the fuck I almost laughed dealership ever.

1427
01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:04.240
He was so,

1428
01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:09.040
I really wish you guys could have seen this guys face when bill told him now he

1429
01:25:09.041 --> 01:25:11.560
was,
he didn't know what to do.
Like he was really,

1430
01:25:11.561 --> 01:25:14.590
his brain kind of broke for a minute cause he was just like,

1431
01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:17.000
Oh and you're like the,
I'm not giving it to,

1432
01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:19.470
what are they not going to sell me the car cause I'm going,
yeah,
no,

1433
01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:22.390
of course they're going to take it.
But he was just so used to people being like,

1434
01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:25.960
oh okay,
well that's weird.
Okay,
whatever.
And just getting it over with.

1435
01:25:25.961 --> 01:25:28.400
And you would just kept being like,
no,
no,
I'm not doing it.

1436
01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:32.410
I'm not giving my fingerprints to a car dealership.
And he's like,
no,
no,
no.

1437
01:25:32.411 --> 01:25:35.410
It's for your security and this and that and you're just like,
I'm not doing it.

1438
01:25:35.770 --> 01:25:38.800
And you were right.
There was like,
there's no reason,

1439
01:25:39.190 --> 01:25:42.800
no matter what they say about security,
someone coming in pretending to be,

1440
01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:45.250
you know,
when I have fun with them,
I go,
look,
if you could give me,

1441
01:25:45.251 --> 01:25:47.920
if you could justify why I'm going to give you my thumbprint,
I'll do it.

1442
01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:50.660
And then they sit down,
they say dumb shit like well,
can,

1443
01:25:50.661 --> 01:25:55.510
if someone tries to impersonate you and buys the car,
no,

1444
01:25:55.810 --> 01:25:57.100
that's not going to fucking happen.

1445
01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:59.770
You dealt with like five different people at that dealership.

1446
01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:03.500
They know who you are or they're not gonna like it.
No,
it's,
it's,

1447
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:06.860
<v 1>it's insane zone.
Even if I didn't do what I did for a fucking living,</v>

1448
01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:08.000
I still wouldn't worry about that.
I'm not,

1449
01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:10.820
you don't give you a fucking fingerprints to a car dealership.

1450
01:26:11.150 --> 01:26:14.650
These people lie for a living.
What are they going to do with that?

1451
01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:18.170
<v 7>And then we met a woman who was like,
Oh yeah,
they ask you that too.</v>

1452
01:26:18.171 --> 01:26:21.260
And she just did it because it was just like,
okay,
there it is.

1453
01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:24.810
That's what they asked me.
Now it's out there and he lives up there.
It was like,

1454
01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:29.240
I've never had anybody say no to this.
And what did you say?

1455
01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:32.560
<v 1>Oh,
I see.
Yeah.
You'd never met anybody like me before.</v>

1456
01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:35.740
I was just talking shit to make you laugh though.
I saw you smile.

1457
01:26:35.741 --> 01:26:39.100
It's very hard to get.
You would have though.
I was just talking shit,
I love that.

1458
01:26:39.850 --> 01:26:40.960
<v 7>I was actually very much,</v>

1459
01:26:40.961 --> 01:26:45.961
and usually when you get into like difficult BB mode and you aren't just like

1460
01:26:46.361 --> 01:26:50.140
giving the other person like the hardest time.
I prefer to say I'm informed,

1461
01:26:50.170 --> 01:26:51.310
but go ahead.
Yeah.

1462
01:26:51.311 --> 01:26:55.150
Well when you're like unnecessarily giving somebody a hard time who's just

1463
01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:59.500
trying to do their job and they're already tired.
Take my fingerprints.
No.

1464
01:26:59.501 --> 01:27:03.100
Like when you call up the time life people to order the,

1465
01:27:03.101 --> 01:27:06.820
the easy listening set and you're so short and rude to them when they're just

1466
01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:11.430
trying to like do their job.
I know,
I know that fucking asshole.

1467
01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:16.060
I forget what he asked me for.
They're always trying to upsell.
Yeah,

1468
01:27:16.590 --> 01:27:18.690
<v 1>no,
he was trying to get all this information out of me.</v>

1469
01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:23.530
Like all this extra information like you don't like just said to him.
Yeah,

1470
01:27:23.531 --> 01:27:25.440
just send me the CDS and the guy goes,

1471
01:27:25.441 --> 01:27:28.440
well I can't send you the cds unless you fucking,

1472
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:31.770
there was like some ridiculous thing like my salsa security them that they're

1473
01:27:31.771 --> 01:27:36.000
all doing this because they stay sharing the information and information.

1474
01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:42.360
Yeah.
And they don't give a fuck what they expose me to as far as identity theft.

1475
01:27:42.361 --> 01:27:45.600
So I go,
I'm not fucking do.
And then the guy goes,
this conversation's over.
I go,

1476
01:27:45.601 --> 01:27:49.880
yeah,
well then it's over.
Go Fuck Yourself.
I hung up.
I was totally within you.

1477
01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:53.310
Always paint me out as a bad guy.
Nia,
my world.
I'm always the victim.

1478
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:57.210
Always the victim that's there.
All right.
Websites,

1479
01:27:57.630 --> 01:27:59.970
Cause I was always saying I always go to the exact same website.
All right.

1480
01:27:59.971 --> 01:28:03.000
Read it out to God.
Now they've,
uh,

1481
01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:08.060
they've also mentioned that you have a reddit sub page and we'd love for you to

1482
01:28:08.251 --> 01:28:12.990
do a Ama some death.
No,
they've asked you to do that.

1483
01:28:13.230 --> 01:28:15.750
Yeah.
I'm not fucking doing that.
You can't ask me anything.

1484
01:28:16.650 --> 01:28:19.130
I'm not fucking sitting there.
Hey Boys,

1485
01:28:19.470 --> 01:28:22.290
I'm going to fucking sit through that for two hours waiting for like one

1486
01:28:22.291 --> 01:28:26.350
legitimate question and uh,

Yeah,

1487
01:28:26.370 --> 01:28:30.030
Never going to do an ask me anything I want.
I'm not saying,
never say never.

1488
01:28:30.031 --> 01:28:34.020
If I got,
if I got maybe an f is for family,
asked me anything,
I'll do that.

1489
01:28:34.021 --> 01:28:35.240
I just don't understand.

<v 7>I,
they can just go very [inaudible].
You just have to know.</v>

1491
01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:47.010
I mean,
or maybe you just have to ignore a lot of like bullshit.
But that's again,

1492
01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:51.230
India,
I'm walking by the front desk.
You're not checking or not checking out.

1493
01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:53.990
I'm just fucking,

1494
01:28:53.991 --> 01:28:58.180

Sarah.

1495
01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:00.710
Those are few and far between

1496
01:29:03.230 --> 01:29:08.190
<v 1>the world.
The world has a sweaty hand and a really hot armpit.</v>

1497
01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:09.653
Right.

1498
01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:13.590
I'd be very surprised they gonna put their hand around you when they go to take

1499
01:29:13.591 --> 01:29:18.120
the picture and you're going to fill their hand drying off into your shirt and

1500
01:29:18.121 --> 01:29:21.450
your other shoulder heating up.
That's what you're going to run into.

1501
01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:25.290
And then all the cool people that you really want to talk to are going to be

1502
01:29:25.291 --> 01:29:27.720
like,
oh,
I don't want to bother.
I don't want to bother this person.

1503
01:29:27.721 --> 01:29:31.210
And they leave.
Those are the people that you want to talk to,
but if not,

1504
01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:36.060
let's ask you to do,
what did you do it doing an Ama?
Yeah.
I mean,

1505
01:29:36.061 --> 01:29:38.190
I'm in business with them.
If they think it's going to sell the show,

1506
01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:42.240
you can't be a dense,
a jerk off move to get in business with somebody.

1507
01:29:42.241 --> 01:29:44.110
And then that fucking promoted.
I mean,
look,

1508
01:29:44.111 --> 01:29:47.700
if they wanted me to sit on like a Dunkin Stool,
oh,
if I,

1509
01:29:47.701 --> 01:29:50.130
if you know what if I could do like that guy drown the clown.

1510
01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:52.740
That guy saw years ago on the opiate Anthony Show,

1511
01:29:52.741 --> 01:29:56.310
we went to one of those metal fucking festivals and they had this guy who was

1512
01:29:56.311 --> 01:29:57.360
called drown the clown.

1513
01:29:57.361 --> 01:30:02.300
And this dude just sat there given people shit and he'd make him so mad.

1514
01:30:02.301 --> 01:30:04.470
It's like Bull Durham and they couldn't,
he fucking hit it.

1515
01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:10.150
And he just had like that Krusty the clown doing that laugh.
I remember.

1516
01:30:10.151 --> 01:30:11.310
No,
he would do the laugh.

1517
01:30:11.670 --> 01:30:15.360
He would give him shit and make fun of how stupid they are and then they would

1518
01:30:15.361 --> 01:30:16.400
miss and he'd be like,

1519
01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:22.070
like fucking grabbing three.
He just kept going.

1520
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:29.470
Oh my God.
It was so fucking obnoxious.
And

1521
01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:35.700
you just really walking by as,
and I'm going to fat guy,
fat guy.
Hey Fatty,

1522
01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:37.920
you ever going to work out you in the purple shirt?

1523
01:30:38.010 --> 01:30:38.843
<v 10>Yeah,</v>

1524
01:30:40.670 --> 01:30:42.380
<v 1>doing that.
And he would just piss them off.</v>

1525
01:30:42.530 --> 01:30:46.430
I forget who I was with Donya I'm telling you I'm doing a bad impression of it

1526
01:30:46.431 --> 01:30:50.810
cause it was so long ago,
dude,
I was fucking,
I was the combination of crying,

1527
01:30:50.811 --> 01:30:54.140
laughing and,
and then also setting,
going like,

1528
01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:57.110
is this the greatest street performer I've ever seen in my life?

1529
01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:00.890
He was fucking amazing.
Fucking amazing.
I was actually,

1530
01:31:00.891 --> 01:31:05.120
I was kind of jealous of the job.
Like I was like,
that's a fucking great job.

1531
01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:12.230
Oh my God.
Rest his soul.
[inaudible] magic Patrice in that job.
Oh my God.

1532
01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:16.010
People wouldn't want to drown them just so they can hear what the fuck he was

1533
01:31:16.011 --> 01:31:20.090
going to say.
And then say he beats you good at it.
Hey,
here we go.
Uh,

1534
01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:24.890
barstool sports.
Well barstool sports.
I go to that one.
Uh,
here's one.

1535
01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:25.340
Uh,

1536
01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:30.340
www.slashfilm.com and easy to read non snarky movie website.

1537
01:31:31.131 --> 01:31:34.790
Okay.
Tumbler.
Hey bill search.

1538
01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:39.830
I thought that was a dating site.
Tinder.
Oh,

1539
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:41.900
I'll just say I don't need that with all my cell phone numbers.

1540
01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:46.030
If you're into antique cars,
you can uh,

1541
01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:50.780
follow accounts that post pictures of classics.
Uh,
use this to follow music,

1542
01:31:50.781 --> 01:31:53.450
photography and arts.
It's endless.

1543
01:31:53.451 --> 01:31:57.110
And having the APP on your phone is a more stimulating way of killing time

1544
01:31:57.111 --> 01:32:01.960
instead of Twitter.
Tumbler is a,
is a good one.
I liked tumbler.
Okay,
cool.

1545
01:32:02.050 --> 01:32:03.710
Uh,
yeah by the way,
um,

1546
01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:07.000
I'm not the only one who is sick of the same 10 websites to go into.

1547
01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:11.420
So if anybody,
you know,
in the future,
if you guys,
uh,
you guys know,

1548
01:32:11.421 --> 01:32:14.150
so find some cool websites or whatever,
let me know.
Be Budget,

1549
01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:19.000
self promotion here,
Eh,
um,
oh,
well it was the Kardashians.
Thank

1550
01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:26.140
you know for me,
for me,
for me.
Dot Com.
I just feel like,
all right,
uh,

1551
01:32:26.190 --> 01:32:28.360
last I was saying I was getting into punk rock,

1552
01:32:28.361 --> 01:32:31.300
how I kind of miss that and I've always wanted to get into it,

1553
01:32:31.301 --> 01:32:34.930
but I just don't know where to go and who's good or whatever.
And,
um,

1554
01:32:35.970 --> 01:32:39.420
I doubt I just was watching this rancid video that led me to watch one of the

1555
01:32:39.421 --> 01:32:43.110
guitars,
gave an interview and he talked about this one band,

1556
01:32:43.111 --> 01:32:46.440
which I already forget the name of something,
something 69.
And they were,

1557
01:32:46.650 --> 01:32:51.060
the front man blew me away and I just don't know shit about punk rock.

1558
01:32:51.061 --> 01:32:53.880
It always sound to me like I was joking.
Sounds like angry karaoke,

1559
01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:57.120
you know what I mean?
Where they weren't quite in tune singing and shit.

1560
01:32:57.121 --> 01:33:01.980
And I just read up on all of this stuff and uh,
it just interests me and,
uh,

1561
01:33:01.981 --> 01:33:05.400
so people won't tell me bans.
Okay.
Um,
all right.
Punk rock punk rock bands,

1562
01:33:05.401 --> 01:33:09.810
obviously the clash of heard of them.
Operation Ivy,
dinosaur junior dead,

1563
01:33:09.811 --> 01:33:14.280
Kennedy kings have nothing leftover.
Crack the media,

1564
01:33:14.281 --> 01:33:16.500
yours.
Um,

1565
01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.820
all right,
well,
you know something of the dead Kennedys I listened to.

1566
01:33:22.710 --> 01:33:23.230
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1567
01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:25.950
<v 1>I left a checkout,
you know,
black flag and all these bands like my,</v>

1568
01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:28.600
my brothers and my brothers used to listen to the shit and I just couldn't get

1569
01:33:28.601 --> 01:33:31.420
into it.
And now I'm,
I'm really finding that I'm liking it,

1570
01:33:31.421 --> 01:33:32.770
so I'm definitely gonna check them out.

1571
01:33:32.771 --> 01:33:36.100
I'll definitely check out the kings have nothing leftover crack and the media

1572
01:33:36.101 --> 01:33:37.210
was because I'd never heard of any of them.

1573
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:39.850
I've heard of dinosaur jr I heard of them too.

1574
01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:44.190
I thought that they were more like a,
uh,
like a college man.
Me Too.
Alright.

1575
01:33:44.290 --> 01:33:47.380
Nashville,
maybe somebody is fucking with me.
Maybe that's this,

1576
01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:52.000
that'd be funny too by the way.
Don,
Donny and Marie.
All right.
Nashville.

1577
01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:53.260
Hey there Billy benchmark.

1578
01:33:53.261 --> 01:33:55.930
I was at your nine 30 Nashville taping and it was amazing.

1579
01:33:55.931 --> 01:33:58.260
I remember every minute of it.
Like it was a Superbowl.

1580
01:33:58.270 --> 01:34:00.640
Can't wait till it comes out.
When does it come out?

1581
01:34:00.670 --> 01:34:04.510
Are you watching South Park this season?
Go Fuck yourself buddy.
Ah,
thank you.

1582
01:34:04.511 --> 01:34:08.920
Yeah,
the nine 30 show,
uh,
was fucking crazy and uh,

1583
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:10.510
I just hope it all comes together.
Well,

1584
01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:14.290
I've already looked at some of the pictures and shit and I'm,
I just,
I fucking,

1585
01:34:14.291 --> 01:34:17.940
I hate going through the editing process.
You gotta do,
I gotta do it.
All right.

1586
01:34:18.010 --> 01:34:20.320
Applause or laughs are you watching South Park?

1587
01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:25.180
They ass a brothers said it's,
it's been excellent this season.

1588
01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:27.970
I know why you always take the Simpsons.
I love the Simpsons.

1589
01:34:27.971 --> 01:34:29.350
Can we tape South Park too?

1590
01:34:29.470 --> 01:34:33.980
It's like the best social commentary from his 20 years in a row.
Yeah.
Um,
uh,

1591
01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:38.680
yeah.
Yeah.
No,
I mean I shouldn't be Washington too.
I completely,

1592
01:34:38.681 --> 01:34:42.520
I forget about it.
Okay.
Alright.
Applause or laughs.
Hey Bill,

1593
01:34:43.090 --> 01:34:46.720
I was watching one of your older specials because I fucked up and forgot to get

1594
01:34:46.721 --> 01:34:51.670
tickets to the one you filmed on Friday.
Uh,
by the way,
congratulations.

1595
01:34:51.671 --> 01:34:53.500
I can't wait to see it.
Thank you.
Um,

1596
01:34:53.530 --> 01:34:56.860
why is my stomach grumbling the I bought all this fucking night cause we eat.

1597
01:34:57.230 --> 01:35:00.920
See?
Yeah.
Which she should not have.
No.
Um,

1598
01:35:01.190 --> 01:35:04.370
well I ate so well up to the special,
I kind of went off the rails this weekend,

1599
01:35:04.371 --> 01:35:06.860
but starting them off.
I'm getting back into,
all right,

1600
01:35:06.861 --> 01:35:09.110
on this particular special,
why do I do this?

1601
01:35:09.111 --> 01:35:12.590
I notice a lot of people in the crowd cheering verse laughing.

1602
01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:15.260
So here's a simple question while on stage,

1603
01:35:15.261 --> 01:35:19.070
what gives you a greater sense of accomplishment?
Laughs or applause.

1604
01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:22.770
That's a really good question.
Thanks and fuck those people.

1605
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:24.980
Tell you to fuck yourself.
Um

1606
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:27.833
<v 0>Huh.</v>

1607
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:31.130
<v 1>Well laughs usually lab to choose a really interesting question.</v>

1608
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:35.000
Well the applause is an applause break.
He usually got laugh,

1609
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:39.320
goes into an applause.
It's never like you just say something.

1610
01:35:40.130 --> 01:35:43.100
If you just say something and nobody laughs and they just applaud,

1611
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:46.520
then you kind of made a statement and that that's like the deuce chill moment.

1612
01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:48.870
Like let me,

1613
01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:52.830
what they really need to be doing is spending more money on education.
Right?

1614
01:35:53.890 --> 01:35:57.590
Yeah.
If you're doing that during a comedy show,
hell tell you that's a rough one.

1615
01:35:57.591 --> 01:36:02.290
You know?
Um,
so you'd rather laughter.
Yeah,
I'm,
I'm much,

1616
01:36:03.530 --> 01:36:07.300
yeah,
I like,
I like when they're laughing.
I will say that,
uh,

1617
01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:11.950
applause
is great too,

1618
01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:15.460
but sometimes during like a taping,
then that's when it just,

1619
01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:18.370
you'll F as a rookie,
you'll feel weird.
Like,
oh my God,

1620
01:36:18.371 --> 01:36:21.880
they're clapping and they're all overly amped up cause they know they want you

1621
01:36:21.881 --> 01:36:24.490
to have a good special,
so they're clapping and then you don't know what to do.

1622
01:36:24.491 --> 01:36:27.070
But they'll always edit around it because they can make it shorter.

1623
01:36:27.071 --> 01:36:31.090
So for the comics out there,
don't worry about those moments.
They can also,

1624
01:36:31.091 --> 01:36:32.320
if you have a dumb look on your face,

1625
01:36:32.321 --> 01:36:35.260
like please stop clapping so I can get to my next show.

1626
01:36:35.470 --> 01:36:38.500
They'll just go to a fucking the master shot and they won't see that look on

1627
01:36:38.501 --> 01:36:43.270
your face and you'll be fine,
you'll be fine.
Um,
but yeah,
I definitely like,

1628
01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:46.000
I like making people laugh to the point that they can't clap.

1629
01:36:46.810 --> 01:36:50.980
That's what I would prefer.
Um,
you know,

1630
01:36:51.610 --> 01:36:53.860
I of course don't always do that,
but uh,

1631
01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:55.960
there are guys out there that I've seen like,

1632
01:36:55.990 --> 01:37:00.220
like it's hard for like a Brian Regan level,
funny guy.

1633
01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:03.760
When I would watch him live to a,

1634
01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:08.590
for the crowd to even be able to applaud because they're laughing so hard.

1635
01:37:09.130 --> 01:37:11.860
He's the first guy I ever saw made somebody slumped over.

1636
01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:14.590
Like there was an empty chair next to this lady.

1637
01:37:14.591 --> 01:37:18.040
I think the other person fucking went,
ran to the back of the room.

1638
01:37:18.041 --> 01:37:22.000
He was killing so hard and the woman,
the woman was just fucking,

1639
01:37:22.150 --> 01:37:24.550
I like that kind of laugh way you like,

1640
01:37:25.150 --> 01:37:28.510
you see when I laugh really hard and if I'm sitting down I get up and I like

1641
01:37:28.511 --> 01:37:33.010
runaway because I'm laughing so hard.
I love that kind of law.

1642
01:37:33.370 --> 01:37:38.080
That's like,
yeah,
that Apollo laughter.
Cause you know how like black people,

1643
01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:41.410
the Apollo,
if they're laughing really hard,
they're like

1644
01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:43.040
<v 6>freaky.
Yes.</v>

1645
01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:47.840
Getting out of this seat and just like waving towels and shit.
Like,
yeah,

1646
01:37:47.841 --> 01:37:49.340
the whole like hitting each other.

1647
01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:50.803
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1648
01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:56.220
<v 6>Like,
well we think it's money.
We think it's really fucking.
Yeah.</v>

1649
01:37:56.940 --> 01:38:00.240
And when you don't think it's funny,
you really don't think it's funny.
Yeah.

1650
01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:01.650
That's what I learned during those rooms.

1651
01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:05.550
Black crowds going to have fun with or without you.
So you,
you bet

1652
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:10.290
everything a laugh with you or they're going to laugh at you.
There's no pity.

1653
01:38:10.291 --> 01:38:13.380
Laughter.
There's no book he applies now.
We don't do that.

1654
01:38:20.710 --> 01:38:22.690
<v 1>Oh,
some of the fucking hackles I got in those rooms.</v>

1655
01:38:24.730 --> 01:38:27.760
The worst is when they would just be talking to each other about how not funny

1656
01:38:27.761 --> 01:38:32.020
you work and I forget.
Just go on stage,
just bombing.

1657
01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:36.410
It was just dead silence and I just heard this woman in the middle of crowd,

1658
01:38:36.411 --> 01:38:38.470
she just goes,
she just looked around and there was,
she just goes,

1659
01:38:38.890 --> 01:38:39.830
<v 6>I left yet.</v>

1660
01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:50.200
And there was no,
there was no,
Oh God,
I love black audiences.

1661
01:38:50.201 --> 01:38:54.940
There was no magic button because yeah,
there's no pa if you're in the crowd,

1662
01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:59.950
in the crowd on stage.
But it's so,

1663
01:38:59.951 --> 01:39:04.951
it's so helpful to be a part of it because nobody cares about your feeling.

1664
01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:10.780
Oh,
not at all.
Not even.
Not even fucking remotely.

1665
01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:15.440
When am I did a black show?
No,
just so like

1666
01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:20.470
she was dead.
No,
she was right though.

1667
01:39:24.810 --> 01:39:27.430
<v 1>Whenever I did those shows.
Yeah.
I always felt like in the end,
I,</v>

1668
01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:30.810
whenever I did the uptown rooms,
as they call it,

1669
01:39:30.811 --> 01:39:35.190
you'd get off stage and you,
you asked yourself one of two questions.
One,

1670
01:39:35.191 --> 01:39:39.870
why am I not world famous yet or two,
what the fuck did I ever,

1671
01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:43.170
why the fuck did I ever think I shouldn't even be in this business?

1672
01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:44.970
Cause it went one way or the other.

1673
01:39:44.971 --> 01:39:48.390
You either murdered or you wanted to crawl out of their

1674
01:39:51.150 --> 01:39:51.541
talent.

1675
01:39:51.541 --> 01:39:56.400
You said this room labar bet on the fucking upper west side.

1676
01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:58.980
It was after work,
uh,
black crowd and,

1677
01:39:58.981 --> 01:40:01.890
and it was every other fucking time.

1678
01:40:01.891 --> 01:40:06.770
Every other time I killed every other time I fucking ate it.
Aw Man.
I,

1679
01:40:06.771 --> 01:40:10.260
I saw them fucking,
uh,
Jimmy Mack,

1680
01:40:10.290 --> 01:40:15.240
uncle Jimmy Mack rest his soul.
I saw him one time.
He was having a tough team,

1681
01:40:15.241 --> 01:40:19.260
was having a tough set.
I think I bombed.
It was just one of those fucking crowds.

1682
01:40:19.261 --> 01:40:20.370
They just weren't laughing that week.

1683
01:40:20.371 --> 01:40:22.380
Every other week they'd laugh every other week they weren't,

1684
01:40:22.381 --> 01:40:27.030
and he was having a tough set.
And I just remember he,
he was bombing so bad.

1685
01:40:27.031 --> 01:40:29.580
And this woman was heckled him so bad he had to bring up his career.

1686
01:40:30.090 --> 01:40:32.910
He started talking about his imdbs.
Yeah,
I have to,
and he goes,
uh,

1687
01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:35.910
front of how he did comic view or something like that.
And like,
he goes,

1688
01:40:35.911 --> 01:40:38.970
I don't give a shit.
He's like,
bitch,
I don't give a fuck.
You don't think I'm 40.

1689
01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:43.950
You know,
I got a career.
And She just went late.
Uh,
I can't remember how she said,

1690
01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:45.810
she said,
Edward,
what career

1691
01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:51.380
<v 6>dressed him down.
I remember I had to go on after it.</v>

1692
01:40:51.381 --> 01:40:53.980
And like,
Jimmy was the right,
he was

1693
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.430
<v 1>the fucking man.
I'm just like,
this guy's got 10 years on me.</v>

1694
01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:01.030
If he can't handle this fucking crowd,
what's going to happen to me?

1695
01:41:01.031 --> 01:41:04.300
And they were just like,
he got off and then I went up.

1696
01:41:04.301 --> 01:41:08.840
Talent went up and talent had this,
this tag,
uh,

1697
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:09.551
what he would do,

1698
01:41:09.551 --> 01:41:13.740
the worst tag that talent could say after your set was when he would go up.

1699
01:41:13.741 --> 01:41:17.770
You'd be like,
come on y'all comedy and easy.
When he said that you were,

1700
01:41:17.771 --> 01:41:21.940
the Gao bond was just like,
oh,
fuck.
Right.
So,
uh,

1701
01:41:22.190 --> 01:41:27.070
he already did for Jimmy.
Come on y'all comedy eight.

1702
01:41:27.170 --> 01:41:30.440
He right.
The only time I ever saw him have to do it for Jimmy because,
uh,

1703
01:41:31.090 --> 01:41:35.770
he always killed and then he brought me up to it.
Oh God.
Oh.
Oh.

1704
01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:39.430
I thought about that fucking show for like a month.

1705
01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:40.630
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1706
01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:44.020
<v 1>I would just think of the shit that people said to me.</v>

1707
01:41:44.050 --> 01:41:45.750
I'd be in the shower thinking of it and just,

1708
01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:49.510
it would pop into my head and I do that thing.
Ah,
like trying to shout it out.

1709
01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:53.650
<v 7>My head is that they know bill because you always talk about how Heckerling like</v>

1710
01:41:53.670 --> 01:41:57.190
is a part of standup comedy right now.
Like Luli it is,

1711
01:41:57.270 --> 01:42:00.780
but the thing is though,
I don't know,

1712
01:42:00.781 --> 01:42:03.510
maybe I just don't get it,
but I,

1713
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:07.560
I just feel like you don't do that.

1714
01:42:07.770 --> 01:42:11.490
You don't fucking heckle.
You let people go up and do their thing and then like,

1715
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:14.800
that's it.
Like you don't heckle people at a play.
You don't,

1716
01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:19.220
well I guess people do hackle people at concerts and shit like that sorta,

1717
01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:22.500
but for the most part you don't.
Why is it that stand up?

1718
01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:24.210
That's what makes stand up awesome.

1719
01:42:24.211 --> 01:42:28.140
If this environment where people really feel like they need to interact with you

1720
01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.750
to that level,
what does your standing there and you're,

1721
01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:35.370
you're not given a speech,
you're talking to them.
Okay.
So like,

1722
01:42:35.371 --> 01:42:38.890
I think it's that like don't bands get heckled and all that.
I love that.

1723
01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:42.480
I bet that to me like,
but you're not,

1724
01:42:42.481 --> 01:42:47.160
but you don't want to encourage people to be haggling to a point of disruption.

1725
01:42:47.810 --> 01:42:50.190
No,
no.
Like not,
not to that level,
but like,

1726
01:42:52.450 --> 01:42:56.960
<v 1>like those are those,
I don't know.
It's,
it's,</v>

1727
01:42:56.990 --> 01:43:00.470
I always thought it was,
it was the most terrifying thing when I started out.

1728
01:43:00.471 --> 01:43:03.320
Like,
what am I going to do?
Because you knew it was going to happen.

1729
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:08.330
What am I going to do when I get heckled?
What am I going to say it?
Blah,
blah,

1730
01:43:08.331 --> 01:43:11.660
blah,
blah,
blah.
Like what the fuck is going to happen?
And um,

1731
01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:16.610
but watching seasoned vets,
handling it,

1732
01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:20.300
handling hecklers was,
uh,

1733
01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:21.980
<v 5>okay.</v>

1734
01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:25.160
<v 7>Was like this art form.
It was an art form within the art form.</v>

1735
01:43:25.490 --> 01:43:28.440
So and you're real,
you're really good at handling hecklers.

1736
01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:33.520
But I can see why some standups wooden would want those people tossed from the

1737
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:37.940
the place cause they're disrupted and this shit and what you're going to spend.

1738
01:43:37.970 --> 01:43:41.630
Yeah,
but that's what it's always been at.
What cereal that you're working on?

1739
01:43:41.631 --> 01:43:44.990
So hard cry going to heckle bucked up by somebody in their child

1740
01:43:46.130 --> 01:43:49.010
<v 1>in his own standup special.
Okay.</v>

1741
01:43:49.011 --> 01:43:53.500
If he didn't whine about it like I don't think else should be okay if,

1742
01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:54.970
<v 9>okay.</v>

1743
01:43:54.970 --> 01:43:57.790
<v 1>The crowd's going to heckle him.
Like what are you,
what are you fucking special?</v>

1744
01:43:57.791 --> 01:43:59.290
Like I look every,

1745
01:43:59.291 --> 01:44:02.590
every comedian can run this shit the way that they want to run this shit.

1746
01:44:03.190 --> 01:44:04.450
But like I look at it,

1747
01:44:04.451 --> 01:44:09.340
like I say a lot of fucked up things on stage that are going to make,
you know,

1748
01:44:09.341 --> 01:44:11.230
I always fucking give women shit.

1749
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:14.100
Like don't tell they really supposed to just sit there and not say anything.

1750
01:44:15.710 --> 01:44:17.740
<v 6>You know when I go down south I'm always talking.</v>

1751
01:44:17.741 --> 01:44:21.370
I'm always fucking around going,
you know when you guys came here,

1752
01:44:21.371 --> 01:44:22.990
you took a shit and you're out house.

1753
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:27.070
You came down here and at some point somebody,
somebody getting overnight,

1754
01:44:27.630 --> 01:44:31.540
like you lie,
you definitely like to push people's buttons that way.

1755
01:44:32.590 --> 01:44:33.520
That's for sure.

1756
01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:34.810
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1757
01:44:34.810 --> 01:44:39.070
<v 1>Yeah cause it's fun.
It's what people did.
You're a provocate tour.
No I'm not.</v>

1758
01:44:39.071 --> 01:44:39.490
It's just,

1759
01:44:39.490 --> 01:44:42.520
it's breaking balls and then they bust your balls back and then it's funny.

1760
01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:47.600
<v 6>Okay.
Yeah,
I guess I understand that.</v>

1761
01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:54.400
I Dunno.
I,
I don't,
I do get annoyed when a,
some people like they'll say like,

1762
01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:58.210
do they heckle at a Broadway play?
It's like,
dude,
you're not doing this.

1763
01:44:58.211 --> 01:45:01.450
Isn't Broadway that right.
Alright.

1764
01:45:01.570 --> 01:45:05.710
Twinkle toes go fucking put on your tap shoes and,
and in a cat suit.

1765
01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:10.690
Go do look at it though.
You wouldn't,
you wouldn't heckle a Broadway show.

1766
01:45:10.691 --> 01:45:13.550
Why you heckle and a comedian.
But you guys,
you know,

1767
01:45:13.551 --> 01:45:16.720
go to a Broadway show and somebody Gwalia is fucking jerk off.

1768
01:45:16.721 --> 01:45:20.440
What do you do for a living?
That's a good point.
Yeah.
They don't do that either.

1769
01:45:20.441 --> 01:45:24.550
Right?
How long is this park has?
I don't want to be torturing people with,

1770
01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:27.620

1773
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:40.460
<v 6>punk rock bands.
I actually found a,</v>

1774
01:45:40.461 --> 01:45:43.690
a band that I thought was pretty cool cause I was watching youtube video.

1775
01:45:43.691 --> 01:45:46.140
Let me see if I can remember this.
This is,
what do you call it?

1776
01:45:46.141 --> 01:45:49.990
What'd you call this kind of music?
Nia.
Trick hop,
trip.
Hop,

1777
01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:53.740
trip hop.
I don't know what the fuck the late nineties,

1778
01:45:53.770 --> 01:45:58.770
early 2000 [inaudible] this is my college years is all about trip hop BN and

1779
01:46:01.780 --> 01:46:05.970

1780
01:46:05.971 --> 01:46:09.070

Wait,

What?
Did you just finish that?

1781
01:46:09.071 --> 01:46:11.380
Like you knew who the fuck they were.
Now I downloaded this.

1782
01:46:11.381 --> 01:46:14.590
It was one of the few times you didn't know who they were and then you just
know,

1783
01:46:14.591 --> 01:46:19.020

Or you know,
massive attack though,

1785
01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:27.580
No.
You know,
Porter said,

Yes.

1786
01:46:28.150 --> 01:46:31.810
What about sneaker pimps?
Yup.
Yeah.

1787
01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:33.760
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1788
01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:36.180
<v 6>Was there a reason for any of that?
I was assigned.</v>

1789
01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:39.490
Were they all sort of like lived in that same,
oh,

1790
01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.870
Trip hoppy Electronica.

1791
01:46:42.810 --> 01:46:44.700
<v 1>Let's see what I've downloaded recently.</v>

1792
01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:48.210
Supreme Beings of leisure leisure.

1793
01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:51.930
Oh I preordered the the pretenders.
New One alone.
Scott,

1794
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:55.470
Jim Kela on drums.
Fucking album.
Sounds crazy man.

1795
01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:59.040
Leonard Cohen has a new album and I was listening to some of the songs and I

1796
01:46:59.041 --> 01:47:02.850
really,
I love Leonard Cohen though.
Well if you're at two years old,

1797
01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:05.910
if you're a pretenders fan,
this is a fucking great album.

1798
01:47:06.090 --> 01:47:07.770
I was listening to that shit when I was getting your chicken.

1799
01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:12.230
I downloaded Rans Ranson,

1800
01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:18.000
<v 7>I pretenders sing the theme song to Fred Green Day.
Is that them?</v>

1801
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:20.470
<v 1>I thought I download it.
Didn't fucking transfer.</v>

1802
01:47:20.471 --> 01:47:23.050
And then I downloaded that fucking punk band.
Wait Bill,

1803
01:47:23.110 --> 01:47:26.490
you know what I downloaded,
cause I was working with t rex,
Todd rex.

1804
01:47:27.330 --> 01:47:31.170
We were laughing about that song dream weaver and we were singing it.

1805
01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:34.020
So no,
that's dream on,
oh

1806
01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:35.340
<v 7>okay.</v>

1807
01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:37.590
<v 1>You know this song,
right?
Am I got to pay for this?</v>

1808
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:42.580
<v 6>No.
It's close</v>

1809
01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:50.770
this fucking song.
After you did the shit,

1810
01:47:50.771 --> 01:47:52.210
like after your day's done,

1811
01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:56.890
the thing he didn't want to do when you finally fucking got true,
right?

1812
01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:02.200
You take your drug of choice,
you get behind the wheel,
your car,
a job.

1813
01:48:02.690 --> 01:48:07.390
You don't do that.
This is,
he's so intense here.
Jesus fucking Christ.

1814
01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:09.733
<v 1>Jessica.</v>

1815
01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:18.170
I've heard this song a million times.
I don't know the words.
It's is it?

1816
01:48:18.171 --> 01:48:21.140
You know the deal and then it,
then it kicks the fucking drums.
Can we come in?

1817
01:48:21.141 --> 01:48:22.580
Right?
Wait,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

1818
01:48:23.090 --> 01:48:23.923
<v 6>Dre.</v>

1819
01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:29.330
<v 7>Did the pretenders sing the theme to theme song to friends?
Was that them?</v>

1820
01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:35.050
Who was that?
What?
Who was it wasn't a kind of a,
no.
All right.

1821
01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:37.070
I don't pretend to Chrissy high this week.

1822
01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:42.680
If [inaudible] wasn't chick never minds.

1823
01:48:43.110 --> 01:48:47.360
How dare you?
Chrissy lives in her own lane though.
I mean,

1824
01:48:47.361 --> 01:48:50.270
she did model herself after like rock stars of course,

1825
01:48:50.271 --> 01:48:52.850
but like she exists in her own space.

1826
01:48:53.570 --> 01:48:54.930
<v 1>That's,
that was a nice recovery.</v>

1827
01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:57.360
If you suggested that she did the fucking friends,

1828
01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:03.810
<v 7>didn't she do like third rock from the side and the real as if she meant that</v>

1829
01:49:03.811 --> 01:49:04.900
was her big all.

1830
01:49:06.010 --> 01:49:08.160
<v 1>Oh,
you're a,
you're almost a millennial.
That's like,</v>

1831
01:49:08.161 --> 01:49:11.380
that's the new excuse for old people.
I'm fucking with you.
All right,

1832
01:49:12.810 --> 01:49:16.830
let's get through here.
Getting off heroin.
Oh,
here's a good one.
Um,

1833
01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:19.350
hi bill.
Just wanted to say thank you.

1834
01:49:19.410 --> 01:49:24.330
Your podcast is a big reason that I am finally having some success in getting

1835
01:49:24.331 --> 01:49:26.460
off the dope.
Thanks.
Ps.

1836
01:49:26.461 --> 01:49:30.990
Brotherhood slash TV series equals fantastic.
Uh,
well that's great man.

1837
01:49:30.991 --> 01:49:33.390
I don't know what I'm doing to help you get off dope,
but uh,

1838
01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:37.320
if you listened to this helps you please keep doing it.

1839
01:49:37.380 --> 01:49:38.780
I told you I met American.

1840
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:41.580
You know what it is because he now he doesn't have to take dope cause he listens

1841
01:49:41.581 --> 01:49:42.250
to one.

1842
01:49:42.250 --> 01:49:43.960
<v 7>Hey,
I'll be here all week.</v>

1843
01:49:43.961 --> 01:49:48.160
They told you I met the scare that told me that he was in a recovery

1844
01:49:48.610 --> 01:49:51.880
<v 6>and that you lessen your comedy and stuff really helped him get him through</v>

1845
01:49:51.881 --> 01:49:53.470
because he was having really dark days.

1846
01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:57.250
And so it'd be able to laugh is really helpful.
I thought that was amazing.

1847
01:49:57.710 --> 01:50:02.690
It is not necessarily funny,
but we'll continue on you.

1848
01:50:02.710 --> 01:50:05.260
I've got like three more years.
You're going to fucking read.
Well,

1849
01:50:05.261 --> 01:50:07.120

1850
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:09.150

All Great.</v>

1851
01:50:09.151 --> 01:50:13.090
The Great Tea's great that you brought that up.
Fucking um,

1852
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:18.220
<v 6>a guess who I'm having to as a guest.
Oh,
Joe Rogan.
Oh,</v>

1853
01:50:18.221 --> 01:50:20.320
is he going to bring some elk burgers?

1854
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:24.490
Helped me finally it making his first appearance or first appearance.

1855
01:50:24.930 --> 01:50:26.790
You'll be on the Thursday afternoon.
Okay.

1856
01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:30.940
<v 1>Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
All right,
lady in law school.</v>

1857
01:50:30.941 --> 01:50:35.350
All right.
Maybe,
maybe this is for you.
What's up Billy butterballs balls?
Uh,

1858
01:50:35.351 --> 01:50:39.660
I'm 27 and a fellow,
a Haka Mark Alum.

1859
01:50:39.970 --> 01:50:43.780
I just moved down to a CT from Connecticut.
Okay.

1860
01:50:43.781 --> 01:50:48.370
From Boston for law school.
There's this girl who I hit it off with right away.

1861
01:50:48.430 --> 01:50:52.620
She's beautiful and we really click,
I find out she had a boyfriend about,

1862
01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:54.150
<v 6>okay.</v>

1863
01:50:54.150 --> 01:50:58.590
<v 1>Uh,
two weeks into school.
Oh,
about two weeks into school and backed off.</v>

1864
01:50:58.770 --> 01:51:02.160
But there was little,
still a little subtle hints that she was in to me.

1865
01:51:02.161 --> 01:51:04.920
Fast forward to our school Halloween party mid October,

1866
01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:08.400
she gets hammered and tells me to man up and make a move.

1867
01:51:08.670 --> 01:51:12.060
Me being the sober guy that I am denied her advances because she's still in a

1868
01:51:12.061 --> 01:51:12.894
relationship.

1869
01:51:13.110 --> 01:51:18.110
The following day she breaks up with a boyfriend and we ended up making out a

1870
01:51:18.330 --> 01:51:18.570
couple of days later,

1871
01:51:18.570 --> 01:51:23.070
she soberly consider first as her feelings for me to which I affirm my own.

1872
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:26.370
This is going good,
right?
This is all quality.
Everything was above board.

1873
01:51:26.610 --> 01:51:30.390
Literally two days later she tells me she doesn't want anything romantically and

1874
01:51:30.391 --> 01:51:34.260
needs to focus on herself.
Uh,
no ridge disrespect to the ladies,

1875
01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:36.510
but I've been through this shit before.

1876
01:51:36.690 --> 01:51:39.630
We're a newly single girl flip flops with their feelings.

1877
01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:42.870
I think everybody flip flops when they're newly single.
My question is,

1878
01:51:42.871 --> 01:51:45.720
what should I do?
I feel like an idiot for telling her I feel.

1879
01:51:45.930 --> 01:51:49.350
And then getting rejected.
You shouldn't.
You shouldn't feel,
yeah,
you are,
man.

1880
01:51:49.351 --> 01:51:50.190
You said how you felt

1881
01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:55.120
<v 6>and you were very respectful of those relationship boundaries.</v>

1882
01:51:55.210 --> 01:51:57.280
So I don't think you've done anything wrong here.

1883
01:51:57.340 --> 01:52:00.460
<v 1>He said,
on the one hand,
I want to say fuck her,
but on the other hand,</v>

1884
01:52:00.490 --> 01:52:04.660
I want to remain friends.
I also literally can't avoid her.
Um,

1885
01:52:04.661 --> 01:52:06.520
if you're ever in new haven,
check out the owl.

1886
01:52:06.521 --> 01:52:09.880
It's a solid cigar bar looking forward to all your new material coming out.

1887
01:52:09.881 --> 01:52:14.590
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
Um,
I liked the sky.
Yeah.
Here's the deal,
dude.

1888
01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:15.241
It's getting,

1889
01:52:15.241 --> 01:52:19.960
it's going to take way too much energy to fucking sit there and try and not to

1890
01:52:19.961 --> 01:52:23.530
look at her and all of that shit.
So just,
uh,
you know,

1891
01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:27.910
you said what she's fucking felt about her.
She's not in that place in her life.

1892
01:52:27.911 --> 01:52:31.300
So,
you know,
that's where she's at.
You were both honest.

1893
01:52:31.570 --> 01:52:32.920
Just leave it at dad when you see it.

1894
01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:36.040
<v 6>Hey,
how are you?
How are you doing?
I mean,
just keeping it dad.</v>

1895
01:52:36.050 --> 01:52:37.430
How was your weekend?
I'll,
that's great.

1896
01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:41.880
Just keep it like that and uh,
keep alive,

1897
01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:46.070
but don't get sucked into the cause.
Who knows?
She might try to suck you

1898
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:49.520
<v 7>into the horse.
She's going to,
she feels lonely this weekend.</v>

1899
01:52:49.670 --> 01:52:52.580
Course she's going to let them make out.
Oh my God.

1900
01:52:52.581 --> 01:52:55.850
Too much back and forth like you,
it's a,
it's a slippery slope,

1901
01:52:56.030 --> 01:53:00.020
so don't get sucked back into it.
So be cool.
Don't like ignore her.

1902
01:53:00.021 --> 01:53:02.000
Don't be weird but don't.

1903
01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:03.830
<v 1>Yeah,
but you know how women are going to be,</v>

1904
01:53:04.100 --> 01:53:07.700
don't try to be friends with this girl and the more he fucking stays though,

1905
01:53:07.701 --> 01:53:09.980
don't try to be friends with her.
The more friendly,

1906
01:53:10.130 --> 01:53:13.610
the more he fucking does that though.
The more she's gonna fucking one on the,

1907
01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:17.480
that's how it works.
If he's just,
if he's just like,
look,

1908
01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:19.880
I respect to what you said the other day.

1909
01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:23.150
I feel like you're in a very highly emotional state where are going to be flip

1910
01:53:23.170 --> 01:53:27.020
flopping and I have to protect myself.
So No,
I'm busy.
You know,

1911
01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:30.270
I definitely to be friends with people,
let's just just leave it at that,
that,

1912
01:53:30.290 --> 01:53:34.490
that will fucking drive her nuts of course.
And when he,

1913
01:53:34.491 --> 01:53:35.630
and she keeps saying no,

1914
01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:40.280
she'll end up blowing somebody else in that class just to get back at it.
Well,

1915
01:53:40.281 --> 01:53:42.020
that's what I'm saying.
Her spiral,

1916
01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:46.420
you know I probably shouldn't have said that last shit.
I'm just fucking,

1917
01:53:46.430 --> 01:53:49.660
I was trying to be funny but no dude,
you,
Kay,
you went in and look,
I will go out,

1918
01:53:49.661 --> 01:53:52.070
wear it.
You got two seconds into knowing that chick.

1919
01:53:52.071 --> 01:53:54.500
You want to fucking know her for four seconds.
She want to keep coming back.

1920
01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:57.290
I wouldn't.
I would just stay friendly with her and I would leave it at that

1921
01:53:58.890 --> 01:54:01.830
<v 7>but not friends.
There's a difference.</v>

1922
01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:07.110
You don't need to be a sounds like an Oprah book friendly but not friends who I

1923
01:54:07.111 --> 01:54:10.170
like that.
That's how you get yourself friend zoned as a,

1924
01:54:10.171 --> 01:54:14.370
as a male or female doing that thing or like,
oh but we're still friends now.

1925
01:54:14.371 --> 01:54:17.520
We're really good friends and we're actually like really good friends and it's

1926
01:54:17.521 --> 01:54:18.060
like,
no.

1927
01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:21.270
If someone has feelings and someone doesn't or someone has to be linked with

1928
01:54:21.271 --> 01:54:22.200
someone's flip flopping,

1929
01:54:22.410 --> 01:54:26.370
you can't be friends only with that person because it's uneven.

1930
01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:30.840
A friendship is when two people have mutual respect for each other and you're on

1931
01:54:30.841 --> 01:54:31.800
the same wavelength.

1932
01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:36.180
You can't fully be friends if one is always pining for the other at shit just

1933
01:54:36.181 --> 01:54:39.860
doesn't work.
So like at this time in her life,
she,

1934
01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:43.490
he can't be friends with her friendly.
What's up?
How you doing?

1935
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:46.740
How's your weekend?
Great.
Boom.
Moving on.
That's it.

1936
01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:51.480
He wants to fuck cars.
That's the problem.

1937
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:54.970
<v 1>Yeah.
We'll let him deal with all of that shit.</v>

1938
01:54:55.540 --> 01:54:56.890
We just give out information.

1939
01:54:56.891 --> 01:54:59.800
Neither one of course to professionals who want to listen to it.
Not at all.

1940
01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:02.750
All right.
Killing it at warehouse job.
Hey Bill.
A while back,

1941
01:55:02.751 --> 01:55:05.710
he talked about working at your old warehouse job and going in every day and

1942
01:55:05.711 --> 01:55:06.400
killing it.

1943
01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:09.940
Well inspired me to seek out one of those jobs and I've been at this job for

1944
01:55:09.941 --> 01:55:12.250
about a month and a half.
Let me tell you,
I fucking love it.

1945
01:55:12.251 --> 01:55:13.390
The physical work is great.

1946
01:55:13.391 --> 01:55:16.780
Unloading trucks and taking big pallets of products to stock with them in the

1947
01:55:16.781 --> 01:55:18.760
backroom.
I fucking love that job,
man.

1948
01:55:18.850 --> 01:55:23.080
I loved that job I had been doing so in the truck drivers of fucking hilarious.

1949
01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:26.020
There's so many like artists and shit that work in warehouses.

1950
01:55:26.050 --> 01:55:28.870
Like there's so many people that played in bands and we're just funny.

1951
01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:33.160
It was fucking great.
All the suits and the carpet area,
it was terrible.
Um,

1952
01:55:33.161 --> 01:55:34.330
anyways,
he says,
uh,

1953
01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:37.810
I've been doing so well that one of the leaders told me that my boss was

1954
01:55:37.811 --> 01:55:40.600
bragging about me in a meeting with the corporate headquarters.

1955
01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:45.150
They even support me in my music and concert photography career as well.

1956
01:55:45.151 --> 01:55:47.310
I told you it's always artists out there.
He said,

1957
01:55:47.311 --> 01:55:51.540
I photographed Metallica up close and personal here in Minneapolis in August.

1958
01:55:51.541 --> 01:55:55.440
I worked my way up to getting 40 hours a week and I'm loving the progress.

1959
01:55:55.441 --> 01:55:59.910
Now my question is when you think it's an appropriate time to ask for a raise or

1960
01:55:59.970 --> 01:56:03.420
ask about benefits,
uh,
I've only been there a short time,

1961
01:56:03.421 --> 01:56:07.710
but I think I proved myself valuable to the company and want to move forward as

1962
01:56:07.711 --> 01:56:11.820
quick as I can.
Uh,
we'd like to hear your thoughts.
Thank you for the inspiration.

1963
01:56:11.821 --> 01:56:12.031
Well,

1964
01:56:12.031 --> 01:56:14.730
it seems to me that you've got this other fucking thing that seems like a way

1965
01:56:14.731 --> 01:56:18.000
better job.
If you're taking pictures of Metallica,

1966
01:56:18.001 --> 01:56:20.430
isn't that the direction you want to go in?
I mean,

1967
01:56:20.431 --> 01:56:24.270
I would use this day job is a way to,
uh,

1968
01:56:24.330 --> 01:56:29.220
keep yourself afloat financially until you get your photography business to a

1969
01:56:29.221 --> 01:56:33.180
level where you can do that full time and not need to worry about anything else.

1970
01:56:33.181 --> 01:56:35.850
But,
uh,
either way,
no matter what she want to do with you life,

1971
01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:38.940
you don't kill it for a month and then be like,
hey,
all right,
they,

1972
01:56:38.941 --> 01:56:41.060
I did something for you.
Can I do something

1973
01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:44.120
<v 6>for me?
It was going to say I'm in the,
not to be cynical,</v>

1974
01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:48.890
but I'm sure they love you now,
but as soon as you asked for more money,

1975
01:56:49.070 --> 01:56:51.650
I think that's just going to flip on you real quick.

1976
01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:54.710
You gotta be careful they're not your friends.
Wait,

1977
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:58.880
<v 1>what it is is do you know,
you got to figure out when the review is.
Yeah.</v>

1978
01:56:58.990 --> 01:57:01.820
Some places have a six months,
some have a year.
That's when you asked.

1979
01:57:01.821 --> 01:57:03.590
You don't dictate your own.

1980
01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:07.700
Like this guy's acting like he was like a fucking one month free agent.

1981
01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:13.030
<v 6>Yeah,
don't,
don't mistake.
They're like encouragement for them,</v>

1982
01:57:13.031 --> 01:57:16.450
wanting you to now like and while we're at it,

1983
01:57:16.451 --> 01:57:20.110
let's give this kid like 10 more dollars an hour like Eh.
Yep.

1984
01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:22.230
<v 1>That is going to,
they'll probably be like,</v>

1985
01:57:22.231 --> 01:57:24.870
maybe we can move this guy up for a position or something like that.

1986
01:57:24.871 --> 01:57:27.900
So it's all good that they're saying that stuff but yeah.
Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah.

1987
01:57:27.901 --> 01:57:31.280
I wouldn't play positive but just,
I dunno know,

1988
01:57:31.650 --> 01:57:34.470
I breastfeed breastfeeding in public.

1989
01:57:35.180 --> 01:57:37.450
<v 6>Hi.
Yes,
you're Billy Crimson tits.</v>

1990
01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:42.400
Let me see the is why I don't do ask me anything cause this is all it's going to

1991
01:57:42.401 --> 01:57:46.000
be.
There are so many Billy.
Like when you were on the Simpson,

1992
01:57:46.010 --> 01:57:48.650
someone wrote all Billy yellow nips is going to be,
yeah.

1993
01:57:49.250 --> 01:57:52.430
<v 1>Yup.
Let me say.
Cool.
I like it.
I think it's funny.</v>

1994
01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:56.480
Let me say congrats on the paths.
Having early season success.

1995
01:57:56.510 --> 01:58:00.710
I am from the bay area and we were hoping the giants get into the playoffs again

1996
01:58:00.711 --> 01:58:05.540
to when their forth even year world series in a row.

1997
01:58:07.540 --> 01:58:11.960
The Bay.
Oh the giant sea a.
Okay.
I see the baseball.
Um,

1998
01:58:12.650 --> 01:58:14.930
well this is an old one then knocked down to the plans.

1999
01:58:15.230 --> 01:58:18.020
Recently I was traveling through Columbia with my girlfriend.

2000
01:58:18.021 --> 01:58:21.890
We were in the airport when we randomly saw a woman breastfeeding her baby just

2001
01:58:21.891 --> 01:58:26.060
out in the open and one of the terminal waiting areas.
Uh,

2002
01:58:26.061 --> 01:58:28.970
what was weird is as she was doing it,
she was looking around,

2003
01:58:28.971 --> 01:58:33.230
making eye contact with everyone who was walking.
By the way,

2004
01:58:33.231 --> 01:58:35.790
a dog looks around a park while it unloads a dumped,

2005
01:58:38.300 --> 01:58:43.170
my initial reaction was saying to my girlfriend,
Oh man,
that's gross.
She's,

2006
01:58:43.171 --> 01:58:46.900
she is breastfeeding.
Apparently this opened the flood gates of feminism.

2007
01:58:46.901 --> 01:58:51.610
My girlfriend responded,
why is that gross?
That's hypocritical.

2008
01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:55.630
You men love to see boobs.
Uh,
but when it's for you,

2009
01:58:55.690 --> 01:59:00.100
when it's for nature's purpose,
you complain.
I then responded,
well,

2010
01:59:00.130 --> 01:59:05.130
the ass purposes to shit and men are turned on by a nice ass.

2011
01:59:05.410 --> 01:59:09.220
Are Women now going to start taking dumps publicly since that is the buds

2012
01:59:09.221 --> 01:59:13.990
primary purpose.
That's a great fucking point.
No,
it isn't.
Yeah,
it is.
She

2013
01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:15.500
<v 6>the same at all.</v>

2014
01:59:16.370 --> 01:59:21.370
We were talking about shitting in public cannot be compared to breastfeeding in

2015
01:59:22.221 --> 01:59:25.610
public.
They are not the same thing at all.

2016
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:29.930
That is what's called a false equivalency.
Yeah,
I dunno.

2017
01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:32.510
<v 1>It's both.
It's both your,
your,</v>

2018
01:59:32.511 --> 01:59:36.380
your ex screening something from your body and people don't want to look at it.

2019
01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:43.080
Um,
she responded that there was an obvious difference.

2020
01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:44.450
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

2021
01:59:44.700 --> 01:59:44.900
<v 1>Uh,</v>

2022
01:59:44.900 --> 01:59:48.770
since then my girlfriend has been sending me all these pro public breastfeeding

2023
01:59:48.771 --> 01:59:51.380
videos of mom's defending the action.
It,

2024
01:59:51.710 --> 01:59:55.070
I find it amusing how women all defended and encourage it,

2025
01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:57.230
but they know how creepy it is.

2026
01:59:57.560 --> 02:00:02.270
So most of them won't actually publicly breastfeed with their own kids.

2027
02:00:02.540 --> 02:00:07.010
I explained to my girlfriend that it isn't the rack citing that annoys us

2028
02:00:07.011 --> 02:00:10.400
obviously since most of us guys enjoy a nice set.

2029
02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:14.240
It's more just the public nature of witnessing a baby drink.

2030
02:00:14.241 --> 02:00:18.170
It's dinner off its mother's utters.
Yeah.
He goes,

2031
02:00:18.171 --> 02:00:23.171
I felt like a chump because I was having trouble explaining why it's not okay to

2032
02:00:23.331 --> 02:00:25.400
publicly breastfeed.
No,
it's okay to do it,

2033
02:00:25.401 --> 02:00:28.820
but like you have the right to look at it and be grossed out.
Um,

2034
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:32.080
could you some ammo in this argument and I'm interested in hearing

2035
02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:32.953
<v 7>my favorite</v>

2036
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:36.480
<v 1>comedian rant about this subject I ever,
the</v>

2037
02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:39.170
<v 7>feeling you just can't mean by difference of opinion.</v>

2038
02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:42.200
Can you be an adult being an adult and let me finish reading this.

2039
02:00:42.201 --> 02:00:44.570
He's got to put it like he needs ammo in this thing.

2040
02:00:44.571 --> 02:00:48.290
Like you just fucking disagree.
It's fine.
Are you done?
Can I use them?

2041
02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:52.640
Ammos where can slap my girlfriend upside the head with some facts,
man.

2042
02:00:52.730 --> 02:00:57.290
She's a mail fax.
I,
oh you as opposed to what?
Female facts.
Yeah,

2043
02:00:57.350 --> 02:01:01.340
we're the ones doing it.
And let me just,
I'm just now I'm just going to,

2044
02:01:01.341 --> 02:01:05.170
can I just finish the fucking thing?
No.
Okay.
I'm going to say right now.
Okay.

2045
02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:10.600
Just because you have found that their most women who wouldn't just whip it out

2046
02:01:10.761 --> 02:01:14.300
and breastfeed in public and it's the same a lot of women I know wouldn't feel

2047
02:01:14.301 --> 02:01:16.570
comfortable doing,
I wouldn't feel comfortable doing it.

2048
02:01:16.580 --> 02:01:20.360
I would want to cover myself up.
But if a woman is not covered up,

2049
02:01:20.570 --> 02:01:22.670
I support her right.
And doing that.

2050
02:01:22.671 --> 02:01:26.630
So just because we wouldn't do it ourselves personally doesn't mean that we're

2051
02:01:26.631 --> 02:01:30.140
not going to want it for other people.
Shit happens that kid's hungry.

2052
02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:33.350
You don't always have your scarf or your cover up or whatever.

2053
02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:37.730
And this kid is screaming and crying and you're stressed out here,

2054
02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:42.110
put a tit and its mouth and it will,
it'll be quiet and be fed and move on.

2055
02:01:42.410 --> 02:01:46.340
It's not that big of a deal.
You can avert your eyes and keep it moving.

2056
02:01:47.210 --> 02:01:48.350
What is the problem?

2057
02:01:48.670 --> 02:01:50.770
<v 1>No,
I'm just saying it's fucking,
it's weird to look at.</v>

2058
02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:54.770
<v 7>It is a little off putting to be like,
oh shit,</v>

2059
02:01:54.771 --> 02:01:57.740
she's breastfeeding but like move on,
get over it.

2060
02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:03.060
It's literally a second of your life.
That's what he does.

2061
02:02:03.090 --> 02:02:07.950
It need ammo.
So then why is this right?
Hey,
take a voicemail India,

2062
02:02:08.090 --> 02:02:10.700
take your voice down and don't act like me

2063
02:02:12.580 --> 02:02:16.810
in order to come back to his girlfriend with you know these well these pearls.

2064
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:18.090
<v 1>No,</v>

2065
02:02:18.090 --> 02:02:22.040
cause he's young and he thinks he's actually going to change your fucking mind.

2066
02:02:22.041 --> 02:02:26.810
Like cause he should have just said,
hey,
fair enough.
Agree to disagree.
Look at,

2067
02:02:26.811 --> 02:02:29.380
all he did was he fucking looked at it and he had the natural,

2068
02:02:29.470 --> 02:02:33.590
he's natural fucking reaction,
which of course feminist is going to say no man,

2069
02:02:33.710 --> 02:02:37.820
that's not the natural reaction that was put into you by the fucking males that

2070
02:02:37.821 --> 02:02:39.180
runs to say Dean but Booboo,

2071
02:02:39.181 --> 02:02:43.280
booboo and all that fucking shit like this shit the guys do in public.

2072
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:47.180
I am sure that is totally fucking legal.
That is disgusting.

2073
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:50.350
<v 7>Like when you're adjusting your balls.
Yeah.</v>

2074
02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:53.330
Do men even realize when they're doing it,

2075
02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:56.640
like sometimes they're just having a conversation with you and they say it's

2076
02:02:56.660 --> 02:03:00.940
like tug on their ball.
Some men no more than others.
Some don't.

2077
02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:04.700
<v 1>Some,
you know more than us.
But like here's my thing,
you know,</v>

2078
02:03:04.701 --> 02:03:08.330
if they're going to sit there and talk about man spreading like the way we sit

2079
02:03:08.331 --> 02:03:11.570
on trains,
but you can fucking whip your titty out and we're supposed to be like,

2080
02:03:11.571 --> 02:03:13.610
hey,
you know blah blah and we can't have a comment on that.

2081
02:03:13.790 --> 02:03:16.790
You guys is just so fucking,
when I say you guys,

2082
02:03:16.791 --> 02:03:20.690
I mean feminists like you guys are just so fucking like looking at shit.

2083
02:03:20.691 --> 02:03:24.860
Just one fucking way that it's,
it's,
I dunno like it,

2084
02:03:24.861 --> 02:03:28.910
it gets you,
you're doing that classic fucking thing where it starts off,

2085
02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:32.210
it's a good cause and then by the end of it you come out the other side.

2086
02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:34.550
You're not 100% what the fuck you were fighting,

2087
02:03:34.551 --> 02:03:39.551
but you have all like a lot of the same elements of shouting people down,

2088
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:43.820
not wanting to hear the rest of the fucking guys stuff you know you want to be

2089
02:03:43.821 --> 02:03:44.361
listened to.

2090
02:03:44.361 --> 02:03:48.080
But this guy here is just being honest to how he feels and it makes you feel a

2091
02:03:48.081 --> 02:03:52.130
certain type of way over the fuck you say it and then you fucking shout it down.

2092
02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:55.590
<v 7>All right,
fair enough.
Fair enough.
You're right.</v>

2093
02:03:55.600 --> 02:04:00.040
I did shut it down and I did like cut it off because I was annoyed by it.

2094
02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:03.630
But I think what it is is that there's just this,

2095
02:04:03.670 --> 02:04:08.020
this feeling of such like,
I don't know.

2096
02:04:08.021 --> 02:04:13.021
I feel like the reaction is disproportionate to what they are reacting to.

2097
02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:17.740
I feel like a child,
you know,

2098
02:04:17.860 --> 02:04:19.600
being fed from its mother,

2099
02:04:19.601 --> 02:04:24.601
which is a very natural thing and the reaction that that some men have to it is

2100
02:04:25.301 --> 02:04:28.960
so disproportionate.
It's like it's ridiculous.

2101
02:04:29.110 --> 02:04:34.110
What is the reaction to the reaction is that he's comparing it to shitting in

2102
02:04:34.151 --> 02:04:38.280
public.
That to me is disproportionate to a child

2103
02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:42.230
<v 6>feeding off its mother.
Really think it's like shitty the potluck.</v>

2104
02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:44.730
Really?
No,
he doesn't think of it.

2105
02:04:44.731 --> 02:04:47.220
That was a clever fucking come back to what she said.

2106
02:04:49.190 --> 02:04:52.730
That collaborator.
It's fucking hilarious.
It's dumb.

2107
02:04:53.810 --> 02:04:56.810
That just means you don't have a good comeback for,
come on.
You guys play.

2108
02:04:56.811 --> 02:04:57.644
You know what?

2109
02:04:59.030 --> 02:05:02.810
I'll tell you not to like a fucking feminist to come along and take the suck the

2110
02:05:02.811 --> 02:05:03.860
laughter out of the room.

2111
02:05:04.420 --> 02:05:09.420
The one asking for ammo about how to deal with this fact that like I enlisted

2112
02:05:09.710 --> 02:05:12.670
his,
yeah,
his girlfriend probably when she,
she says spicy.

2113
02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:15.130
We did another hour since I turned this fucking thing on.

2114
02:05:15.150 --> 02:05:18.710
This is like a fucking two hour podcasts.
It's like the longest one ever.
Oh no,

2115
02:05:18.711 --> 02:05:20.600
that's,
that's not good.
That's too long,
right?

2116
02:05:20.660 --> 02:05:25.350
People don't want it to be that long.
Yeah,
it's probably too long.
Um,
anyways,
Nia,

2117
02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:27.770
Nia,
the end of the day.
Okay.

2118
02:05:30.430 --> 02:05:34.740
Know people have a right to fucking react.
They certainly do.
They do.

2119
02:05:34.741 --> 02:05:37.980
Like they look at something that like,
okay,
the same fucking like,

2120
02:05:37.981 --> 02:05:40.080
you're not allowed,
you know,
with,

2121
02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:45.040
with all of that type of shit that falls on the other side of the fence,

2122
02:05:45.340 --> 02:05:47.890
you're not allowed to have your natural reaction to it.

2123
02:05:47.891 --> 02:05:51.180
It's automatically considered that there's something fucking wrong with you and

2124
02:05:51.181 --> 02:05:54.580
something like that.
There's a lot of fucking like,
here's another thing too.

2125
02:05:54.581 --> 02:05:56.470
Like there's those,
there's also light,

2126
02:05:56.471 --> 02:06:00.790
but there's also like teenage shades walking around and all of that type of shit

2127
02:06:00.910 --> 02:06:04.540
and you're whipping your fucking titty young.
You can't walk around topless.

2128
02:06:05.170 --> 02:06:09.250
It's considered indecent exposure in this fucking country.
Right?
Okay.

2129
02:06:09.251 --> 02:06:11.330
There's kids walking around,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

2130
02:06:11.470 --> 02:06:14.790
You're pulling out a fucking teddy and then you take a little mini mia,

2131
02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:17.140
you and you stick it on the end of it.
But I mean,
yeah,

2132
02:06:17.141 --> 02:06:21.040
this is something like very alien about it,
but I'm not the guys.
It's just weird.

2133
02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:23.470
I know.
But the thing is we have a right to feel that way.

2134
02:06:23.470 --> 02:06:27.370
I'm not saying we're right in what we're thinking shit on Bourbon Street during

2135
02:06:27.371 --> 02:06:32.200
Mardi gras and that's not as natural as it is to feed a child.
Not to me,

2136
02:06:32.250 --> 02:06:34.490
letting me know.
He says,
Shit,
nobody's a shit on,

2137
02:06:34.491 --> 02:06:35.860
on Bourbon Street and Mardi Gras.

2138
02:06:35.861 --> 02:06:39.040
When girls are flashing their tits or something like two sem plastic beads made

2139
02:06:39.041 --> 02:06:42.910
in China and then it's all good,
then it's like shots for everybody.
No,

2140
02:06:42.911 --> 02:06:44.960
but that's what it's like someone's speeding.
They're cheaper.

2141
02:06:45.010 --> 02:06:48.640
That's not legal damn airport.
It's not illegal.
But you don't see men being like,

2142
02:06:48.641 --> 02:06:51.700
can you believe the way she just led light?
They're,
they're into it,

2143
02:06:51.850 --> 02:06:54.880
but a woman is feeding her child at the airport and all of a sudden it's like

2144
02:06:54.881 --> 02:06:58.860
shit and public.
No,
because of oppression.
Just,

2145
02:06:58.900 --> 02:07:01.300
I can't even fucking give,
I'll get such a great example,

2146
02:07:01.301 --> 02:07:04.940
but I can't fucking say it.
Why not?
Yeah.

2147
02:07:05.010 --> 02:07:07.780
You're looking at the breasts and the one that just shaking their tits or

2148
02:07:07.781 --> 02:07:09.160
whatever.
It's like,
yeah,
okay.

2149
02:07:09.190 --> 02:07:13.810
And then all of a sudden there's a baby mom eating off of it.
It's like,
Whoa,

2150
02:07:13.811 --> 02:07:17.230
what the fuck to people who don't have babies,

2151
02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:22.460
it's weird.
It freaks you out.
Like,
Oh yeah,
that's right.
They also do that.

2152
02:07:22.970 --> 02:07:24.350
And it's also kind of fucking weird.

2153
02:07:24.351 --> 02:07:27.440
You just sitting there eating a sandwich and then you look down the thing.

2154
02:07:27.470 --> 02:07:31.910
I know Nia,
I know the whole fucking world needs to just be like,
oh,
okay,

2155
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.070
fuck all our feelings like that.
That's how this,
this shit is going

2156
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:40.270
<v 1>where it's just you.
Your guys' side is 100% right?</v>

2157
02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:43.630
The way you see shit is 100% right.
And a lot of times,

2158
02:07:43.690 --> 02:07:47.450
most of the shit you're bitching about,
guys had wrong.
And I agree with it,
but,

2159
02:07:47.451 --> 02:07:50.410
but this whole fucking thing that men cannot have fucking opinions.

2160
02:07:50.530 --> 02:07:53.260
You guys can tell us how to sit down on a fucking subway.

2161
02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:58.150
But we can't have a fucking reaction to look.
I don't give a fuck of a woman.

2162
02:07:58.390 --> 02:08:02.140
Breastfeeds I don't.
But like when I see some guy who,

2163
02:08:02.141 --> 02:08:05.460
who has a reaction to it and then he gets yelled at like he,

2164
02:08:05.470 --> 02:08:07.600
he wants women not to be able to vote anymore.

2165
02:08:07.601 --> 02:08:10.590
I just think it's a bit of a fucking overreaction.
Yeah.

2166
02:08:10.770 --> 02:08:15.660
<v 7>I just think that it's interesting that there are certain men who are more</v>

2167
02:08:15.661 --> 02:08:19.740
comfortable with seeing breasts sexualized than they are for what they are

2168
02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:24.510
sexualized.
Like they're being exploited.
They are more,

2169
02:08:25.260 --> 02:08:30.260
they are more accepting of seeing a woman's breasts being use in a sexual manner

2170
02:08:30.750 --> 02:08:34.260
than they are for the purpose of what breasts are four,

2171
02:08:34.261 --> 02:08:38.580
which is like basically to feed children.
It's not all there or otherwise.

2172
02:08:38.581 --> 02:08:42.420
There's not all there for fats like the fat deposit.
No,
that's not all that for,

2173
02:08:42.630 --> 02:08:43.510
what do you mean?
That's not all there.

2174
02:08:43.620 --> 02:08:44.453
<v 1>That's for the,</v>

2175
02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:49.410
the survival of mankind in that Nice Arac attracted a fucking mail and he comes

2176
02:08:49.411 --> 02:08:52.680
over and he bangs Ya.
And then when you guys die,
there's still other people.

2177
02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:55.680
<v 7>There's also that.</v>

2178
02:08:57.210 --> 02:08:57.450
<v 9>Okay.</v>

2179
02:08:57.450 --> 02:08:59.940
<v 7>So in other words for like procreation</v>

2180
02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:00.400
<v 1>does,</v>

2181
02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:04.990
there's no way to win this fucking argument because women want to be attractive.

2182
02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:08.770
You want attention.
Yeah.
But you want it when you want it.

2183
02:09:08.771 --> 02:09:12.910
You want it how you want it.
And you guys have to know exactly when that is or,

2184
02:09:12.911 --> 02:09:15.970
and when it isn't.
And if they don't,
if they don't fucking guess,
right.

2185
02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:19.030
It's like the end of a Tom cruise movie when he's trying to clip which fucking

2186
02:09:19.031 --> 02:09:23.440
wire one's going to blow it up.
The other isn't.
And if you don't 100% no,

2187
02:09:23.441 --> 02:09:27.850
when that fucking thing is,
then you are like,
uh,
I don't know what you,

2188
02:09:27.851 --> 02:09:29.680
you're the worst fucking person on the planet.

2189
02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:31.120
<v 9>Okay.</v>

2190
02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:35.440
<v 7>So what are you saying?
Just shut up and take it however you get it.</v>

2191
02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:40.660
No,
that's not what I'm saying.
Why do you have to go to that level of extreme,

2192
02:09:40.930 --> 02:09:45.190
but,
and,
and you're,
you're Tom cruise analogy,

2193
02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:48.250
like the rail on the stream.

2194
02:09:48.450 --> 02:09:52.200
<v 1>No,
I'm saying it's just like,
no matter what the fuck we do,</v>

2195
02:09:53.310 --> 02:09:54.270
we're wrong.

2196
02:09:55.110 --> 02:09:58.950
It's like you want to fucking put on a fucking pushup Bra and have your tits and

2197
02:09:58.951 --> 02:10:01.560
everybody's fucking face a wow.
[inaudible] ladies,

2198
02:10:01.561 --> 02:10:03.600
we're not paying for drinks tonight.
Right.

2199
02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:08.850
You fucking little skirt and barely covering your fucking hoo ha.
Okay.

2200
02:10:08.910 --> 02:10:12.300
And then all of a sudden in a blink of a fucking I is,

2201
02:10:12.301 --> 02:10:14.010
what the fuck are you looking at?

2202
02:10:14.100 --> 02:10:17.850
I'm talking about Dad Shit and you know that shit.
You know what I'm saying?

2203
02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:18.820
<v 7>I know what you're saying,</v>

2204
02:10:18.821 --> 02:10:21.430
but I don't know what that has to do with breastfeeding and any of that kind of

2205
02:10:21.431 --> 02:10:25.160
stuff.
Cause that's not what we're talking about.

2206
02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:28.540
<v 1>Well you let it into the whole thing like you know,
you,
you'll,</v>

2207
02:10:28.570 --> 02:10:31.330
you'll look at like sexualize breasts were off.

2208
02:10:31.331 --> 02:10:34.280
It always comes steering around the,
somehow men

2209
02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:35.330
<v 7>are acceptable,</v>

2210
02:10:35.331 --> 02:10:39.260
but somehow child being fed off of leg of the breath and I don't understand why

2211
02:10:39.261 --> 02:10:42.460
that is.
Why that's more comfortable.
She's not a man's,

2212
02:10:42.461 --> 02:10:45.980
it'd be to be like not a man.
Well then fine.
Maybe that's what it is.

2213
02:10:45.981 --> 02:10:50.330
But like that's something that I feel like people need to get over.

2214
02:10:50.570 --> 02:10:53.270
I would not breastfeed in public without being covered.

2215
02:10:53.420 --> 02:10:56.660
But if a woman needs to do it,
I get it.
And it shouldn't.

2216
02:10:56.661 --> 02:10:58.390
I think people could just submit what they think.

2217
02:10:58.430 --> 02:11:01.030
I think people could just think what they think.
I think he,

2218
02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:05.050
I don't feel that the way I look at the way that they think and progress a

2219
02:11:05.060 --> 02:11:05.780
little bit.

2220
02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:09.680
That's how we get to find a little bit more understanding between the sexist.

2221
02:11:09.681 --> 02:11:12.140
So we don't have the yeah,
but you know how that works.

2222
02:11:12.150 --> 02:11:16.190
So every year argument like we're not getting anywhere.
I don't understand.

2223
02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:19.940
<v 1>Cause you know how that works,
that progressing thing works.</v>

2224
02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:24.530
The only way this progression in it is if men see the world the way women want

2225
02:11:24.531 --> 02:11:25.400
them to see the world.

2226
02:11:25.740 --> 02:11:29.810
That that is the so called progression between the sexist right now that's

2227
02:11:29.811 --> 02:11:34.700
what's fucking annoying because all of my shit is just considered ignorant and

2228
02:11:34.701 --> 02:11:39.260
not valid.
And I'm a caveman and all of your shit is applause.
Break,
talk,

2229
02:11:39.261 --> 02:11:44.261
show shit 100% and women can literally do exactly to men what the fuck they

2230
02:11:45.801 --> 02:11:49.070
don't want done to them in different ways.

2231
02:11:49.790 --> 02:11:51.880
And it's just,
and it always,
if a,
if,

2232
02:11:51.881 --> 02:11:56.150
if a guy gets completely fucked over by a woman,
what do they say?
Well,

2233
02:11:56.151 --> 02:11:59.900
he picked her shouldn't have married her,
you know what I mean?

2234
02:12:00.350 --> 02:12:04.520
Do you guys aren't necessarily held accountable for your actions when you picked

2235
02:12:04.521 --> 02:12:08.420
a bad dude?
If you pick a bad guy and he's a fucking piece of shit,

2236
02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:12.380
then it's,
you know,
not only not your fault,

2237
02:12:12.381 --> 02:12:14.540
it's the guy's fault and it's all men's.

2238
02:12:14.810 --> 02:12:18.980
Then all men have to sit down and listen to a fucking lecture or read a sign on

2239
02:12:18.981 --> 02:12:20.090
a fucking subway.

2240
02:12:20.570 --> 02:12:24.440
Like we're all walking around dragging women down the street by the fucking
hair.

2241
02:12:24.830 --> 02:12:29.830
But there's no signs on the subway or anywhere else about the fucked up behavior

2242
02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:34.460
that a lot of women display with men.
Okay.

2243
02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:38.930
So that I can accept that.
Okay,
so that's all I'm saying.

2244
02:12:38.931 --> 02:12:43.910
So this is another fucking thing where it's like your guys' reaction literally

2245
02:12:43.911 --> 02:12:48.590
to how men sit on the fucking subway is 100% validated.
I can't be like,
listen,

2246
02:12:48.591 --> 02:12:51.950
I got balls.
I don't want to smash him between my thighs.

2247
02:12:52.130 --> 02:12:53.660
Fucking get over it.

2248
02:12:55.530 --> 02:12:56.880
<v 7>I don't,
I don't have that option.</v>

2249
02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:00.160
<v 1>You can be like,
well fuck you,
I got to breastfeed my kid.</v>

2250
02:13:00.190 --> 02:13:03.910
Get over it the way you look at it as fucked up,
but our whole shit is,

2251
02:13:03.911 --> 02:13:07.360
we have to be like,
oh really?
Is this,
is this,
is this issue?

2252
02:13:07.450 --> 02:13:11.590
9,863 of this fucking month that bothered you.

2253
02:13:11.810 --> 02:13:15.330
You guys are these faultless fucking human beings.
Like I said,

2254
02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:18.160
near most of that feminist shit.
I fucking agree with it,

2255
02:13:18.161 --> 02:13:21.130
but like it's just every fucking day now.

2256
02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:25.060
Every day now there's some new fucking thing.
It's a fucking lecture.

2257
02:13:25.061 --> 02:13:28.930
It's seeped into the comedy clubs,
everything.
It's just so fucking precious now.

2258
02:13:29.580 --> 02:13:32.100
<v 7>Stupid.
Well,
I know correctness is</v>

2259
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:35.250
<v 6>like across the board is like can be,</v>

2260
02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:39.370
I'm going to start it out like nine hours of the shift.

2261
02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:43.440
The enemy of like creativity and stuff like that.
I definitely agree with that.

2262
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:47.130
It's childish,
but I just feel like when it comes,
I just

2263
02:13:51.690 --> 02:13:54.270
yet another thing.
It's heart was in the right place,

2264
02:13:54.271 --> 02:13:58.050
but it's solves absolutely nothing.
No,
I understand that.

2265
02:13:58.051 --> 02:13:59.190
But all you did was you gave,

2266
02:13:59.220 --> 02:14:04.220
you gave truly horrible people a roadmap of words where they can navigate from

2267
02:14:05.341 --> 02:14:08.400
one side of the river to the other and still have their fucking job.

2268
02:14:08.401 --> 02:14:10.530
But what's in their heart is still in their fucking heart,

2269
02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:15.360
but they can say native American,
African American,
uh,
um,
whatever,

2270
02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:20.150
whatever the fuck you supposed to say.
Post post person,
melt person it shit.

2271
02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:22.440
It's just fucking annoying to be like,

2272
02:14:22.441 --> 02:14:27.441
hey gimme some ammo so I can tell my girlfriend why women shouldn't breastfeed

2273
02:14:27.601 --> 02:14:31.200
in public.
Like that just sounds like some ignorant shit to me.

2274
02:14:31.290 --> 02:14:34.980
It sounds to me like he's losing the argument and she's probably affecting the

2275
02:14:34.981 --> 02:14:39.090
mood of the fucking,
he's too dumb to just let it go cause he's young.

2276
02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:43.800
That's what he's doing and I imagine right now that she's probably using sex is

2277
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:48.450
the lack of sex or whatever to now punish him and now he's walking around like a

2278
02:14:48.451 --> 02:14:52.410
fucking little puppy that gets slapped on the snout with a fucking newspaper.

2279
02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:54.630
Like a lot of guys in relationships,

2280
02:14:54.631 --> 02:14:57.720
people that are just modest about that kind of stuff.

2281
02:14:57.900 --> 02:15:02.310
I had a friend over not too long ago and she brought her six month old with her

2282
02:15:02.311 --> 02:15:05.460
and she had to breastfeed him and when he was off the thing,

2283
02:15:05.461 --> 02:15:08.490
you know when he would drink some and then he'd be sort of like looking around,

2284
02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:12.480
she was like covering her boob and it was just her and I in there and there was

2285
02:15:12.481 --> 02:15:13.530
a part of me that wanted to be like,

2286
02:15:13.531 --> 02:15:16.950
you don't have to like cover your breasts in front of me.
But that was a natural,

2287
02:15:17.250 --> 02:15:20.670
I'm not arguing his thing.
I don't give a shit of women breastfeed in public.

2288
02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:24.420
I don't give a shit.
I'm just saying that there are women who are,

2289
02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:27.090
and I'm sure the reason why she was looking around like,

2290
02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:30.420
you know a dog taking a shit is because she's thinking,
Oh God,

2291
02:15:30.421 --> 02:15:34.170
who's going to judge me?
Who's going to judge me when she should?
In an ideal,

2292
02:15:34.171 --> 02:15:35.070
perfect world,

2293
02:15:35.250 --> 02:15:39.180
just be there with her baby if she gets off on a beating and then just why she

2294
02:15:39.181 --> 02:15:41.910
is saying the ca you just said that.
Oh my God.
Oh my God is gonna Judge me.

2295
02:15:41.911 --> 02:15:43.260
She lives.
Oh cause she was saying he was,

2296
02:15:43.290 --> 02:15:45.970
he was saying that she was looking around when she was on Columbia.

2297
02:15:46.290 --> 02:15:49.380
She lives in Colombia.
Who knows what the culture is down there,

2298
02:15:49.381 --> 02:15:52.470
what the opinion is.
I don't know shit about Columbia.
Do you know,

2299
02:15:53.050 --> 02:15:55.320
why would you watch narcos and all of a sudden you know what these fucking

2300
02:15:55.321 --> 02:15:57.890
people are thinking now.
I would never try to speak for Columbia.

2301
02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.020
I have no fucking idea what they think they might.
It just might not be.

2302
02:16:01.021 --> 02:16:03.660
That might be totally fucking normal.

2303
02:16:03.780 --> 02:16:08.100
And she was just people watching or she might've been a freak and she was trying

2304
02:16:08.101 --> 02:16:10.140
to see if any,
but you know she's Alexa submission is,

2305
02:16:10.141 --> 02:16:13.620
who knows what the fuck she was thinking.
She was probably like,

2306
02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:17.850
oh Jesus Christ per people looking at me like I'm crazy because I'm

2307
02:16:17.851 --> 02:16:19.200
breastfeeding without a cover.

2308
02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:23.150
She's probably really like having some sort of anxiety about it.

2309
02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:26.850
I bet it's probably socially acceptable.
So that's what I would guess.

2310
02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:29.980
So she's just fucking looking around.
Okay.
Yeah.

2311
02:16:31.730 --> 02:16:36.400
She just looking around
near we got to end this fucking thing.

2312
02:16:36.401 --> 02:16:40.540
This is like Tupac.
Just,
all right.
Sorry guys.
I know this was really long,
but,
uh,

2313
02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:43.100
we hadn't seen each other for a while.
We like to talk.
