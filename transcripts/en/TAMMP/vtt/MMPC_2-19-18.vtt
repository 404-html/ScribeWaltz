As opposed

9
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.890
she gave us the keys as opposed to live in back east where I guess it's really

10
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:39.650
fucking cold,
which is where I'm about ready to go.

11
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.823
Boop.

12
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.070
I'm about ready to go to a Becky's cause we're doing the sixth annual Patrice

O'neil comedy benefit.
All right.

14
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.040
Raising money and raising awareness for the greatest comedian that I ever saw

15
00:00:57.261 --> 00:01:01.820
live.
Um,
the sixth annual,
it's going to be a great one.
I can't wait.

16
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.840
I fly out to Myra.
I'm already packed.

17
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.710

I got a nice mid day flight.

19
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.750
I'm going to have a good time.
And then I'm going to,
uh,

20
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.420
I'm going to do a late night set of some shit at the west side comedy club,

21
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.490
shake a little bit of the rust off.

22
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.020
He'd go on and try not to embarrass myself,
um,

23
00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:30.140
with the level of talent that we have going on there.
Oh,
of course.
And you know,

24
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:32.330
who has an added addition this year?

25
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.690
The teen idols sensation from the late great opie and Anthony Show,

26
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.570
Mr Joe Derosa.
Joe To Rosa.

27
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.270
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

100%.
Can't,
can't wait to see them.</v>

29
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.450
Um,
so anyways,
so I'm doing this,
I'm doing this podcast in the afternoon.

30
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.820
I hung out with my,
uh,
my family all weekend.

31
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.740
I had a great time except for the big fight I had with my wife.
Other than that,

32
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.890
it was a great time.
You know what I mean?
Uh,
and I,
I made,
uh,
I,

33
00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:05.560
I,
you know,

34
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.770
it was ash Wednesday the other day and I went to church for the first time in a

35
00:02:08.771 --> 00:02:11.350
long time just to see the band.
They had that Dixie land band.

36
00:02:11.351 --> 00:02:14.500
And I don't know why they don't have that every week.
You know what I mean?

37
00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:16.000
I would go every week if they went in the back.

38
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.940
<v 2>Wow.</v>

39
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.923
<v 1>What do</v>

40
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.010
they do that as opposed to coming in with that haunting fucking Oregon

41
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.570
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

42
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.443
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

43
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.223
<v 2>right.</v>

44
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.370
<v 1>Shit.
You know the original,
the original support,</v>

45
00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:52.960
the troops first responders,
the original guilt trip,

46
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.150
the Catholic religion.

47
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.880
If Jesus was alive today,

48
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:03.700
can you imagine the standing ovation he would get as he walked through the

49
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:06.540
fucking airport if people weren't staring at their phones,
if they saw,

50
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.070
you know what I mean?
Anyways,
plowing ahead.
Uh,

51
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:15.640
so it's Ash Wednesday and I've given up argument with my wife for lent.

52
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.830
I'm just not going to do it.
I'm just going to experiment.
Just completely,
just,

53
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.480
I'm good.
Just going to fucking,
I'm just going to agree with everything.

54
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.310
Hey,

55
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.260
you want to do this horrific time eater that you'll deal?

56
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.740
You'll experience absolute no joy in a you absolutely.
Only if that sounds great.

57
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.260
You know I'm already been doing it.
It's weird and her out.
You know,
cause we,

58
00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:44.530
we went to the mall today,
right?
Who the fuck goes to the mall on a Sunday?

59
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.790
Guess what?
This guy,
because I'm not arguing with my wife anymore.
Let's go.

60
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.700
Go to the mile.
Fucking absolutely.

61
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.470
Let's go when everybody else has the day off to go.
Right.
So we go down there.

62
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.130
It's a,
I mean,
it was like,
it was Christmas.

63
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.760
There was so many fucking people down or,
well,
the weeks leading up to Christmas,

64
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:08.500
I should say just a zillion fucking people.
We still had a good time,

65
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:13.150
right?
Don't get me wrong.
I love my wife.
I love my kid.
I loved my role as,
as,

66
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:16.660
as being a father,
but Jesus fucking Christ.
You know what I mean?

67
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.890
It just gets to the appointment.
There's just too many fucking people.

68
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:24.670
I started getting like claustrophobic.
So,
um,

69
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.900
we'd go down to this place right with fucking hanging out and everything and I'm

70
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:29.920
just looking around.
I have,

71
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:34.360
she glad I went because I haven't been to a gathering of people in a long time.

72
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.900
I mean,
I know people come out to my shows,
but the lights are in my eyes,

73
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:39.400
so I can't see you.
And,
uh,

74
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:44.401
I cannot fucking believe the influence of social media on just people walking

75
00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:48.820
around.
It was,
it was,
it was a shit show.

76
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.740
I've never seen so much side boob underneath boob on top Boob,

77
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.020
but my wife's call,
he stopped staring all these titties.

78
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:03.100
It's just like how they're fucking out.

79
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.880
Everybody looked like they were trying to do,
you know,
the,
the,

80
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.780
there was dressed like they were going to a photo shoot to get their fucking,

81
00:05:10.781 --> 00:05:13.240
whatever your,
your,
your main picture on Instagram.

82
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.830
All the guys Gq it up or look alike j crew doses.

83
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.330
I saw this one word woman walking by and it was just like,

84
00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:27.331
she looked like she was on her way to the club and she was pushing a baby and I

85
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:30.250
accidentally in front of me,
I just can't,
that's not a mom.

86
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.040
Moms don't look like that.
So Nias look coming.
She goes,
why not?

87
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.620
That's what I want to look like.
I want to,

88
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:42.790
I want to be the height mom.
What's wrong with that?

89
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.030
And I was just like,
well,
I gave it up for lent.
I was like,
ah,
nothing.
Nothing.

90
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:51.340
Yeah,
you're right.
You're right.
And she goes down.

91
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.470
I want to hear what you're thinking.
I said,
no.
Well,
you know,

92
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:57.020
I gave up arguing with you for a lens.
So I,
you know,

93
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.860
she goes,
did we don't have to argue.
You could just tell me what you think.

94
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.560
It's right off the bat.

95
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.440
I'm loving this new power that I have that I'm not going to argue with her.

96
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:08.120
And then,
you know,
because I'm not arguing with her,

97
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:11.480
she's not going to know what I'm thinking.
Right?
And that's freaking her out.

98
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:13.940
And all I want to say is,
hey,
welcome to my fucking world.

99
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.150
I never know what you're thinking guys.
Some time right now,
it's not too late.

100
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.260
It's not too late.
Give up arguing with your woman full length.
And this is the,

101
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.660
tell him that that's what you're doing.
I'm not going to argue with you.

102
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:27.080
And they're all excited.
They think it's going to be great.
But then is you,

103
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.530
you're,
you're like taking away one of their major powers,

104
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.080
which is their ability to piss you off.
And then you spill the beans.
You know,

105
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.990
they get y'all fucking

106
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.490
<v 3>man.
I'd be like,
all right,
all right.
How was it?
I was like,</v>

107
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.750
cause I had another trick of my friends.
You know what?

108
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.570
Cause I don't fucking break my balls.
I can go.
Then she can be like,
wow,

109
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.260
<v 1>all that shit.
Right.</v>

110
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.430
So if you just sit down and you just sit in the fucking pocket,

111
00:06:53.431 --> 00:06:55.800
like what was that movie?
Uh,
John Turturro did,

112
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.850
we played that mobster and he just did that great thing where he just was

113
00:06:59.851 --> 00:07:03.530
sitting there like barely audible in front of it.
That whatever,

114
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.610
some fucking Senate committee,
God,

115
00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:08.190
I can't answer that in the grounds it might incriminate myself.

116
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.740
I can't answer that on the grounds that might incriminate myself.

117
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.060
I answer that might incriminate yourself.
He says it like over and over again.

118
00:07:15.061 --> 00:07:19.290
This gravelly fucking voice that is so fucking unbelieved right there.

119
00:07:19.291 --> 00:07:20.460
They should have just given them an award.

120
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.380
Just him saying that line over and over again was better than 90% of the fucking

121
00:07:25.381 --> 00:07:29.700
act.
And that I see.
Right.
So
anyways,

122
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.430
she's trying to get me to fucking say why.

123
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.000
<v 0>Okay.</v>

124
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.833
<v 1>You know,</v>

125
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.910
a woman shouldn't be like fucking high heels with her ass fucking jacked up in

126
00:07:39.911 --> 00:07:43.480
the air and it tits hanging out,
you know,
makeup,
all done,
hair all done,

127
00:07:43.481 --> 00:07:46.300
all of that shit pushed around a kid.
Now,
you know,

128
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.840
there really is no reason why she can't be like that.
Uh,

129
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.400
I just selfishly was just sitting there like I wouldn't want my mom to look like

130
00:07:54.401 --> 00:07:57.070
that cause then all my friends would want to fuck my mom.

131
00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.430
<v 0>Okay.</v>

132
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.263
<v 1>You know,</v>

133
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.920
so much of what I think makes sense until I say it out loud.

134
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:11.350
And then I realized how fucking stupid I am.
But um,
it was a,

135
00:08:11.351 --> 00:08:13.340
I mean granted I was in la,

136
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:18.020
we went right to the fucking the grove here in Hollywood where it's just like,

137
00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:22.610
you know,
I,
there was some of the best looking fucking fifth 40,

138
00:08:22.611 --> 00:08:25.010
50 and 60 year old people I've ever seen in my life.

139
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.340
And then you had the young people,
Jesus Christ,

140
00:08:29.341 --> 00:08:31.680
it was all star weekend.
You thought all the whores,

141
00:08:31.681 --> 00:08:35.430
we're down at the staple center in the fucking hotels in the surrounding area

142
00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:39.180
now.
They were over at the grove,
the regular ones.

143
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.050
Everybody there looked like they were trying to fucking NBA all star and none of

144
00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:46.490
them work.
They would just shop it.

145
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.750
And I caught myself in the mirror and I was just like,
wow man.

146
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.080
I literally looked like I came here in a fucking time machine.

147
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.980
I had my old Archie bunker hat on and everybody keeps breaking my balls because

148
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:00.090
they made fun of Rogan's hat.

149
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:03.510
That one time when he said he had a little rascals haircut on had on him.

150
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:05.280
It's going to say I love that hat.

151
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.860
I just gave him shit because I thought he was going to come at me.

152
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:10.170
It was just a comedian thing.
Make Fun of his fucking hat.

153
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.380
He'll be self conscious.
He can't see it.
It's on top of his head.

154
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:14.310
It's going to fuck with them.

155
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:18.600
And then I won't have to deal with Joe Rogan unleashing his genius on my big

156
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:22.260
bald head.
Right.
That's the only reason why.
Other than that,
I liked the hat.
So,

157
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.000
um,
I've got a couple of those.
I've got a little pork pie hat,
you know,

158
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.900
I've got my own little fucking Mr. White from fucking breaking bad going on.

159
00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:33.000
You Shave your head is a white dude.
I mean you got to cover it up.

160
00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:36.060
Especially if you're a fucking shit.
All right.

161
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:38.850
I'm not trying to spontaneously combust.
I live in a desert out here.

162
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.120
I got to keep the sun off.
Um,

163
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.220
anyways,
I need to like paint the top of my,
you know,

164
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.420
paint the top of my head like,
you know,
in World War II,

165
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.810
while they would paint the headlights and they'd just be like a little slit

166
00:09:50.811 --> 00:09:51.290
there.

167
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.370
I should paint the entire my whole fucking head and just have a slip right in my

168
00:09:55.371 --> 00:09:56.204
eyes.

169
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.800
So I don't blind anybody trying to land at lax.
Um,

170
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.200
anyways,
but there was a lie.

171
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.260
And then in the middle of all of that Instagram shit show,
which,
who's kidding,

172
00:10:08.261 --> 00:10:12.670
who most of this is just me dealing with the fact that things are changing and

173
00:10:12.671 --> 00:10:16.330
nobody cares about my views,
which is part of becoming old.

174
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.023
It just said,

175
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.710
<v 4>you're me.
I shop where you could buy pay dots.
Right?</v>

176
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.220
<v 1>Nobody cares.
Nobody cares.
Old Man,
you had your time,</v>

177
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:27.270
it's fucking over.
Right.

178
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.870
So I'm just kind of getting to that realization that I am that guy.

179
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.300
I probably been that guy for 15 years,
but I'm just,
you know,

180
00:10:33.301 --> 00:10:37.860
my fucking [inaudible] I dunno.
So full of myself.

181
00:10:37.861 --> 00:10:42.030
I finally just realized it.
So,
uh,
I dunno,

182
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.840
that's something I,
I mean,
and I,
I've,
man,

183
00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:50.640
I must have looked like a creep.
I must look like a creep.
I'm 49 years old.
Okay.

184
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:55.140
And I like to think I try to be a gentleman.
You know,
Jesus.

185
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.050
I try.
Okay.
But here's the thing,

186
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.290
if you're going to walk by with your fucking titties out,
I mean,

187
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.210
what am I supposed to do?
That's my new fucking,
uh,
you know,

188
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:08.040
when I get a text one,

189
00:11:08.041 --> 00:11:10.890
I'm like some gum shoe shit and it drives me nuts and I love it.

190
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.030
I'm fucking winning meant I'm not arguing with her.

191
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.540
It's driving her nuts in a little way.
You know?
Cause she said,
well,

192
00:11:18.541 --> 00:11:23.160
we don't have to argue,
but I still like debating.
So He's,
you know,

193
00:11:23.161 --> 00:11:27.450
what's going on with you as always.
My wife doesn't talk like that.

194
00:11:27.451 --> 00:11:30.630
That's just how I hear it my head.
Um,

195
00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.670
so anyways,
we went over there and,
uh,

196
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.200
I went into the Nike store and that they actually have the balls,

197
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.720
they're selling tee shirts that say a quality.

198
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.820
And I'm thinking like,
isn't this the people that,

199
00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.500
was it them or apple that had the sweatshop where people would jump into their

200
00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:54.760
deaths?
I can't remember.

201
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.720
But then I looked it up and it says that Nike has made big strides,

202
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.070
no pun intended,

203
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:04.360
and their fucking a sweatshop environment.

204
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:05.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

205
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.610
<v 1>Which I mean,
I mean,
what do you,
what do you have to fuck it?
Do</v>

206
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:09.883
<v 0>Okay?</v>

207
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:10.730
<v 1>You know,</v>

208
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.270
give one person a sandwich and then you get a higher rating than last quarter.

209
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.133
I don't know.

210
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.560
Top 10 ways to improve a sweatshop number one,

211
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.820
uh,

212
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:27.190
by a fly swatter one fly swatter for all 10,000 employees.

213
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.020
Uh,
number two,
what else could you do?
Um,

214
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.480
have a door where people can go home.
At some point.

215
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.680
Um,
a working bathroom.

216
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.010
I Dunno.
I Dunno if they're all fucking Ms. Well why did they have,

217
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.100
you know what I mean?
It's so fucking dumb.
When I was a kid,

218
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:51.070
they made shirts in this country and it didn't cause she a zillion dollars,

219
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.100
but now they just like you wasn't a,
you're juggling

220
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.980
because that's not because it costs so fucking much to make a shirt.

221
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.420
It's because they're not going to drop their profits.
So it's like,
all right,

222
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.820
if we can't pay this guy 30 cents an hour,

223
00:13:06.821 --> 00:13:10.420
we got to pay an American fucking 10 bucks an hour,

224
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.510
then you're going to eat the cost and the sharp.
Okay,

225
00:13:13.511 --> 00:13:18.190
cause I'm not having a smaller yacht.
You got dead fuck.
Oh by the way,

226
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:22.300
I gave to the president's campaign.
You didn't.
So what I say goes,

227
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:24.243
that's how I think.

228
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.850
That's how I think it works without ever having researched how much it costs to

229
00:13:27.851 --> 00:13:28.684
make a shirt.

230
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:31.343
<v 0>Okay.</v>

231
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.240
<v 1>That's how I formulate my opinions.
You know,
I look at a couple of things,</v>

232
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:40.010
then I get paranoid and then I just start running my freckled fucking Yap.

233
00:13:40.011 --> 00:13:40.970
And for whatever reason,

234
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.720
enough people listened to this podcast that I continue doing it twice a week.

235
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.170
All right.
Did you ever think about that as you sit in your cubicle,

236
00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:51.260
giggling and laughing to yourself,
that you're just enabling,

237
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.250
you're just enabling the,
the,
the,
the just the disease.

238
00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:57.813
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

239
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.230
<v 1>Of a sick man.
Maybe not.
No,
I think I'm sick.
I Dunno.</v>

240
00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:03.250
I Dunno what the fuck I am.

241
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:07.990
All I know was the titties were out at the fucking mall and I was walking around

242
00:14:07.991 --> 00:14:11.350
looking like a skinny Archie bunker,
Archie bunker.
And I don't give a fuck.

243
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:16.850
You know,
my wife goes,
well,
don't be fucking do this.

244
00:14:16.851 --> 00:14:20.690
One girl walked by,
right?
Giant ass,

245
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.200
giant round fucking ass.
And she was,

246
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.490
I think she bought Salami from the white shadow salami,

247
00:14:28.491 --> 00:14:31.700
short shorts off of the white shadow.

248
00:14:31.701 --> 00:14:36.080
And that's what the fuck she had on her fucking ass was out.
I was like,
me,

249
00:14:36.081 --> 00:14:38.860
I look at that,
turn around and look at that.
She goes,
look at lunch turnaround.

250
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:40.910
She goes,
Jesus Christ.

251
00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.373
<v 0>Yeah</v>

252
00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:49.370
<v 1>guys,
you gotta stick around and raise your daughters.
Okay,</v>

253
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.163
I'll tell you right.

254
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:57.910
If that woman that barely a woman wearing those fucking shorts,

255
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:04.640
if her dad stuck around for her entire Charlie childhood,
I swear to God,

256
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.760
I'll have a gun in my mouth.
She can be a good dad.

257
00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:12.590
And your daughter's still goes to the mall with half her fucking ass hanging

258
00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:13.424
out.

259
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.190
<v 0>Okay.</v>

260
00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:19.260
<v 1>I Dunno.
Maybe that's this is this part of the fucking the me too thing.</v>

261
00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.790
The empowerment of women.

262
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.250
<v 5>If a woman was to walk around with all of her ass hanging out,</v>

263
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.120
<v 1>all that stupid shit now where it's like basically women can now do whatever the</v>

264
00:15:32.131 --> 00:15:35.130
fuck they want without consequence.

265
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:37.403
<v 0>You know,</v>

266
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.740
<v 1>ignoring the number one fucking rule of nature,</v>

267
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:47.741
which is you have the way you wish the world is and the way the world really is,

268
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:52.640
and you have to act accordingly.
You could walk around with your ass hanging out.

269
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.930
I wouldn't do it.
That's not something I would dope.
But you know,

270
00:15:56.931 --> 00:15:59.180
it is your ass and if you want to have it out,

271
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.370
George Carlin book that he did,
he goes,
you haven't noticed 90% of women.

272
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:08.940
<v 0>Okay,</v>

273
00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.530
<v 1>whoever,
uh,
where I,
uh,
against abortion,</v>

274
00:16:11.531 --> 00:16:13.050
you wouldn't want to fuck in the first place.

275
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:14.610
<v 0>Okay.</v>

276
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.970
<v 1>It's one of my favorite flats.
Just fucking hilarious.
You know?</v>

277
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.670
That's a lot of times when you sit there and you did,
you know,

278
00:16:19.671 --> 00:16:23.090
women are bitching about being catcalled some of the fucking women who's fucking

279
00:16:23.091 --> 00:16:25.190
complain about that Shit.
You just looking at them going,

280
00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:26.300
are you fucking kidding me?

281
00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:27.570
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

282
00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.900
<v 1>Are you kidding me?
I swear to God,
you walked by a construction site,
you'll hear,</v>

283
00:16:30.901 --> 00:16:33.510
you're going to hear is the sound of people hammer and nails,
you know,

284
00:16:33.511 --> 00:16:36.030
if you fucking high horse,
you know,

285
00:16:36.031 --> 00:16:38.880
maybe that's because I'm not exactly a good look at person and I don't have

286
00:16:38.881 --> 00:16:42.330
sympathy for people who get like a standing ovation when they walk by a fucking

287
00:16:42.331 --> 00:16:46.470
job site.
Am I really supposed to feel bad for you?
Whoo.

288
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:52.800
I understand.
It's scary.
I always look,
did it like,

289
00:16:52.801 --> 00:16:53.071
you know,

290
00:16:53.071 --> 00:16:56.490
like whenever as a guy you watch like the beginning of Shawshank redemption and

291
00:16:56.491 --> 00:17:00.720
everyone's chanting fresh fish.
That's much to be what like,
you know,
a certain,

292
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.110
you don't level of good looking woman feels like when she walks by a

293
00:17:04.111 --> 00:17:08.430
construction site.
However,
in 2018 all women seem to be acting like they're,
yeah,

294
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.800
that good looking and the reality is you're not okay.

295
00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.900
Which brings me to Olympic figure skating.

296
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.300
<v 0>Okay.</v>

297
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.133
<v 1>All right.</v>

298
00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:20.730
If I hear one more fucking figure skater talking about how they had to starve

299
00:17:20.731 --> 00:17:24.840
themselves because they weren't the right body type to fucking twirl around in

300
00:17:24.841 --> 00:17:29.690
the fucking ice.
I mean,
am I really supposed to feel bad for you?
Okay.
You're,

301
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.150
you're,
you're,
you've entered a fucking beauty contest.

302
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:34.733
<v 0>All right.</v>

303
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.960
<v 1>I swear to God,
it'd be like,
you know,
listen to some of these people complain.</v>

304
00:17:38.961 --> 00:17:43.580
It's like me bitching that I can't book a shampoo commercial or how come I can't

305
00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:48.581
be the spokesperson for Coppertone tanning because you're a bald pasty freckled

306
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.130
no one wants to look at,
we're in business here.
We're trying to make money,

307
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:54.923
<v 0>right.</v>

308
00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:00.350
<v 1>So I don't,
I that they'd fucking,
uh,
what,
what the fuck is or you know,</v>

309
00:18:00.351 --> 00:18:03.710
I loved that.
I don't even know what her ne Oh no.
Tonya Harding,
I guess.

310
00:18:03.711 --> 00:18:06.650
I don't know the other one's name.
Nancy Kerrigan.
I know both.

311
00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:08.540
You know what I mean?

312
00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:13.540
That was just all about a little fucking runt of the litter chick.

313
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.063
All right.

314
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.340
Who should have been like a power lifter or something and she decided that she

315
00:18:19.341 --> 00:18:23.810
was going to figure skate.
I mean,
they have figure right in the fucking job.

316
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.550
You gotta be all long and fucking sinewy.
Everybody knows that.

317
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:32.200
<v 0>Okay.</v>

318
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.720
<v 1>I don't know if I don't fucking get it and I haven't had,</v>

319
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.150
you got to like fucking,
you got to like dumb it down.

320
00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.140
There's not a weird shit going on right now or at sports illustrated use nothing

321
00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:45.520
but women photographers this year is some sort of sign of strength of women.

322
00:18:45.521 --> 00:18:48.340
It's just like,
well wait a minute.
So all those guys who use to hire,

323
00:18:48.341 --> 00:18:52.540
did any of them get busted for doing anything wrong or did they just all get

324
00:18:52.541 --> 00:18:56.050
kicked to the curb?
I'm not buying any of this either.

325
00:18:56.051 --> 00:18:57.820
Now everybody has to like do something.

326
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.740
This is like the vagina version of like the fucking ice bucket challenge.

327
00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:06.430
It's like,
why can't I just give you money?

328
00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.510
What am I going to like dump shit over my fucking head?
What's the cause?

329
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.530
Is it worthy?
Is the money actually go into the victim's final?
Give it to you.

330
00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.990
Stupid shows a strike.
I Dunno.
God,
I'm going to fucking mood.

331
00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:25.170
So Friday night and me and my wife went down to go see black pants.

332
00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:32.790
All right.
And,
uh,
I enjoyed the movie.
Nia loved the movie.

333
00:19:32.791 --> 00:19:34.950
I enjoyed it.
Uh,
but you know,

334
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.260
I had a little sippy sip before I went in there and then,
uh,

335
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.120
I had two hits a week and it's just the weed that they make nowadays,
it's just,

336
00:19:42.121 --> 00:19:44.280
you know,
I'm trying not to drink,
I don't want the calories.
Right.

337
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:47.790
So I had a couple of hits a week.
I was just,
I was like tripping.

338
00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.510
So I'm sitting in that fucking movie,
right.
And you know,
deal,

339
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.320
it's a fucking superhero movie,
right?
And everybody's just like,

340
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.350
there's always this big drama with your family and all that shit.

341
00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:01.950
And at one point I fell asleep.
Nothing that because of the movie.

342
00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:05.790
It was because I was fucking flying and I fell asleep.

343
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:07.820
I don't know how long.
And uh,

344
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:12.860
all of a sudden something big and metal got thrown or crashed and it hit the

345
00:20:13.021 --> 00:20:16.530
ground.
It was like,
it was like scraping and shit.

346
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.910
And in my brain I was flying a helicopter in my skids,

347
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.630
hit the fucking runway when I was trying to taxi and I thought I was going to

348
00:20:24.631 --> 00:20:26.850
flip the fucking thing and do and I tell you,

349
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:29.780
I fucking jumped fucking like

350
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.640
woke myself up and he is looking at me like,
Jesus Christ.

351
00:20:35.641 --> 00:20:38.220
It wasn't that scary.
Um,

352
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.640
but anyways,
uh,

353
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.310
Nia is going to go back and she's going to go see the one where you put the

354
00:20:44.311 --> 00:20:49.300
glasses on and it's this whole other level and I can't handle that shit.

355
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.560
You know what I mean?
I don't,

356
00:20:50.561 --> 00:20:54.190
I don't want somebody fucking hand in my face and those women with the fucking

357
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.130
disappears there.
I don't,
I,
you know,

358
00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:01.870
it's enough for me as it's fucking unreal that people needed to jump off the

359
00:21:01.871 --> 00:21:05.880
screen.
It's like,
this is an incredible enough,
I don't want to ruin the mood.

360
00:21:05.881 --> 00:21:07.060
There's one fight scene,

361
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:08.463
<v 0>you know,</v>

362
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:11.130
<v 1>between a couple of fans.</v>

363
00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.800
It's always family members is that we some shit going on.
You know what I mean?

364
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.120
I'm,

365
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.750
somebody's dad did something or somebody pissed at their sister or they didn't

366
00:21:18.751 --> 00:21:22.260
realize,
you know,
Oh hey,
I didn't even know you were my cousin.

367
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.971
Oh Fuck,

368
00:21:23.971 --> 00:21:28.350
let's join forces and go fucking try to take the mountain and get the glow and

369
00:21:28.351 --> 00:21:31.650
thing and put it back in its rightful place so everybody can live in peace.

370
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:36.800
It's basically the boob blueprint of a mall.
Right.
Um,

371
00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:41.370
my beef with superhero movies is like after they made,
made up like six of them.

372
00:21:41.371 --> 00:21:45.320
Kind of like all the really good ideas but gone.
It's like the Dunkin contests.

373
00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.030
There's only so many ways to fucking Dunkin and the next thing you know,

374
00:21:48.031 --> 00:21:52.200
you know,
they bring it out.
You know,
some guy like staples is sitting at a desk,

375
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.750
right?
And somebody's got to fucking jump over him.

376
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.740
Use The stapler is like a fucking spring board is somebody that's just it.

377
00:21:58.741 --> 00:22:00.880
At that point,
you're just like,
dude,
you're out of ideas.
Okay,
we've,

378
00:22:00.881 --> 00:22:03.690
we've exhausted what human beings can do.

379
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.100
Let's wait till nerds continued to develop these fucking robots and let's see

380
00:22:08.101 --> 00:22:08.934
what they can do,

381
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.333
<v 0>right?</v>

382
00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.420
<v 1>No,
you don't think so?
I Dunno.
What do you guys think of those?</v>

383
00:22:15.421 --> 00:22:18.110
So when you go to an NBA game and those people come out with a trampoline and

384
00:22:18.111 --> 00:22:21.680
they're all flipping around and fucking slamming the ball and everything,

385
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:25.980
that was interesting for like two weeks.

386
00:22:25.981 --> 00:22:28.500
And then I just started realizing that most of them were white and I just

387
00:22:28.501 --> 00:22:30.510
started feeling bad about myself going,
Jesus Christ,

388
00:22:30.511 --> 00:22:33.120
we can't even do a black people do unless we have like a fucking trampoline.

389
00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:44.440
And I hate whatever form of entertainment dead is dead fucking excitement that

390
00:22:47.031 --> 00:22:51.440
you're trying to pass on to you.
I'm just too much of a jaded con,
you know,

391
00:22:51.441 --> 00:22:53.930
when they fucking have their eyebrows up,
you know,

392
00:22:53.931 --> 00:22:57.350
and they fucking nod in as they come up.
You know,

393
00:22:57.351 --> 00:23:00.410
like all of a sudden we're all in band camp or something.
Oh God,

394
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:03.740
why am I such a cunt?
Why can't I just sit and fucking enjoy things?

395
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.750
I try.
I don't try it.
This is just naturally who the fuck I am.

396
00:23:10.751 --> 00:23:14.710
You know what I mean?
Um,
anyways,

397
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:21.160
so Saturday night I had a great weekend.
Saturday night I went to the fucking,
uh,

398
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:27.310
I went to Queens of the Stone Age at the La Forum with royal blood opening up.

399
00:23:27.311 --> 00:23:30.890
Jesus Christ.
What a fucking shelf.

400
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:35.110
You have to go see it.
You got to go see it.
It's been,
I have a bitter,

401
00:23:35.111 --> 00:23:39.130
nothing but great things on this,
about this tour coming up.

402
00:23:39.131 --> 00:23:42.550
So I was really excited and every fucking time those dead band was in town.

403
00:23:42.551 --> 00:23:46.880
I've been out of town every fucking time they played the Wiltern.

404
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.910
I was out of town.
Where the hell did they pull?
Then they played a,

405
00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:52.580
then the next album came out and I think we'll at staples,

406
00:23:52.581 --> 00:23:55.970
I don't know where they were at.
Not this album,
the album before.

407
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.150
I forget where I wasn't in town,
so I missed that one.
And uh,

408
00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.550
then I thought it was going to miss this one.
It didn't.
The last second,
you know,

409
00:24:04.551 --> 00:24:06.200
my daughter got sick,
so,
uh,

410
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:10.620
I kind of pushed back my trip to New York and um,

411
00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.850
I was able to go down and see the holy shit where a fucking good,

412
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.520
it was ridiculous.
Um,

413
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:22.540
and John Theater like this fucking red vista like kit now that just sounded

414
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:26.300
incredible and two times he took a drum solo.

415
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:28.810
I don't want to ruin the show if they do the same thing every night.
I,

416
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.740
they don't strike me as that kind of bad,
but like

417
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.553
<v 3>yeah,</v>

418
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.690
<v 1>it just,
it was just,
it was fucking unreal.</v>

419
00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.000
<v 3>Okay.</v>

420
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.690
<v 1>It was just unreal.
Near Bass player was a bad total fucking rockstar.</v>

421
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:42.450
And then I got to see royal blood to a,

422
00:24:42.451 --> 00:24:47.150
well I'm a big fan of and a mean Delray got there,

423
00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.920
got there a little bit late but we caught like half of this sentence just to

424
00:24:49.921 --> 00:24:54.510
fucking people,
Bass player and drums killing it.
Everybody going nuts.

425
00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:57.710
And,
um,
I always love seeing shows it the uh,
did the,

426
00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:03.050
the forum too cause I can't believe like how small that places compared to like

427
00:25:04.691 --> 00:25:06.670
the staple center,
which is like gigantic.

428
00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:11.170
And I probably the forum holds just as many people who's just not so many bells

429
00:25:11.171 --> 00:25:12.040
and whistles in there.

430
00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.670
And every time I go in there I just looked down with the floor,

431
00:25:15.671 --> 00:25:20.320
used to be being like this is where magic or the Kareem.
That's what Mikael,

432
00:25:20.321 --> 00:25:24.310
somewhere on one of these corners close line Kurt Rambis.

433
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.030
Um,
this is where the,
uh,

434
00:25:29.031 --> 00:25:33.540
the fucking 70 sixers came in and kicked the shit out of the Lakers and 83.
Okay.

435
00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:35.940
<v 3>Okay.</v>

436
00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.510
<v 1>This is where that piston team beat the Lakers.
I think like so many.</v>

437
00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.660
I mean the Lakers were basically in the finals almost every year.

438
00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.520
They were in the finals and 80,

439
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:49.950
(828) 038-0480 five I might be wrong about that.

440
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:54.450
86 [inaudible] 87 and 88.

441
00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:55.860
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

442
00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.750
<v 1>So what does that,
that was like seven or eight.</v>

443
00:25:57.751 --> 00:26:00.150
It was like six out of eight years or seven out of eight years.

444
00:26:00.151 --> 00:26:03.210
They were in the finals every fucking year.

445
00:26:03.211 --> 00:26:07.980
So I just think of all the wars that I saw on that court.
And um,

446
00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:12.750
and I actually saw the Lakers and the La kings play there back in the 90s.

447
00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:17.670
I saw the kings when they played the penguins against Mario Lemieux.

448
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.070
And then I saw a young,
young,

449
00:26:20.071 --> 00:26:22.680
young Kobe Bryant when he was still wearing number eight.

450
00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.460
Del Harris was the coach and I think Dennis Rodman was on that team.

451
00:26:26.461 --> 00:26:30.600
And Shaq had just got there.
Hey ladies.
Hi.
Hey.

452
00:26:30.601 --> 00:26:31.740
You want to talk about that?

453
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.370
You know all of the Instagram people I saw at the mall,

454
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.960
I didn't tell you I was so frigging claustrophobic with the how many people

455
00:26:39.961 --> 00:26:42.810
there that was bananas,
right?
Yeah.

456
00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:48.510
But I was telling the listeners step for lent.
I gave up arguing with you all.

457
00:26:48.511 --> 00:26:52.710
Is that what that's about?
It's Lens.
Why doesn't have to be linked?
But why not?

458
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:57.120
Isn't it 40 days?
40 days?
I'm not going to argue with you.

459
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:01.120
So right now if you want to,
you know,
if you want it,
you can get it.
You know any,

460
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:05.010
any of any like shit that you know that,
oops.
Any stuff?
Sorry sweetheart.

461
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:10.540
<v 2>Sorry.
Hi.
Hi.</v>

462
00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:17.100
<v 1>My daughter got her ears pierced.
I was so against it.
Oh,
when she looks so cute.</v>

463
00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:20.280
Yeah,
she does.
I know,
but she's just [inaudible].

464
00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.620
Why I W I was wondering why you want to see something cute once you put it on my

465
00:27:23.621 --> 00:27:28.190
little pork pie hat.
This is the most adorable thing ever.
Watch this.
Oh,

466
00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.860
you're going to start crewing and for us,

467
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.270
you like daddies and then a Barbara Streisand song.
Oh,
he's all,

468
00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:40.240
and he's saying that too.
Then he scad sang in the end.

469
00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:44.410
She keeps kissing the microphone.
Dooby dooby do.

470
00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:46.090
There were no crush my head

471
00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.880
<v 2>problem with hot moms at the mall.
What's wrong with that?</v>

472
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.330
I don't have a problem with it.
You're right.
Okay.

473
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.980
<v 1>Oh,
okay.
So this,
this is a no are going,
I don't know what to,</v>

474
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.070
I don't know what it was.
It was fuck ass if you're not going.
I know.
I just,

475
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.100
I wonder,
I guess,
I guess you know,
it was what you were saying.

476
00:28:05.101 --> 00:28:09.360
I was just wondering like how committed like are you,

477
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.900
it just seems really self-involved.
Like I like,
I mean I can't get a tablet.

478
00:28:12.901 --> 00:28:17.160
Say I could get a 10.
Right.
All right.
Oh,
you almost fell.
They cue.
Yeah.

479
00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:20.880
Backup here.
So like,
say like I'm a dad and I'm walking around.

480
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:25.280
I got a p 90 x body all tanned up.
I got my teeth all,

481
00:28:25.281 --> 00:28:27.930
uh,
all white.
Yeah.
All White and,

482
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:32.280
but you share plugs and all that face all yanked back when we did.

483
00:28:32.281 --> 00:28:34.470
Let me just say,
okay,
and I'm walking around now.

484
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.680
How much do you think I'm paying attention to my kids?
Less.

485
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:41.130
And I think the better you feel about yourself,

486
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:45.630
the better you are as a parent.
That was like,

487
00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:49.020
that would have crushed on Oprah.
Um,
whew.

488
00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.140
<v 2>What happened to you?
Clavin for Mommy?
Cause I'm right.</v>

489
00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:57.150
You clever for mommy.
Yay.

490
00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:02.580
I love how our instinct is to take the microphone.
This is,
this is definitely,

491
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:07.310
she's a ham.
Um,
cheese,
a ham.
But no,
I think that's,
it's,

492
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.020
it's fine.
I mean,
obviously it is,

493
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:15.810
it is putting on,
oh,
did I,
I didn't stop the recorder.
Did I?
Uh,

494
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:21.000
no,
obviously if you are choosing from like,

495
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:25.780
you know,
do your makeup or what?
He's talking to the mic.
I'm watching her.
Okay,

496
00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:30.480
good.
Hi.
Hi.
Um,
if you were like,
you know,

497
00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:34.770
I would play with my child for five more minutes,
but I have to do my,

498
00:29:34.771 --> 00:29:36.750
I don't know,
I don't like to judge people,

499
00:29:36.751 --> 00:29:41.751
but I think it's cool that you can like have yourself together and look amazing

500
00:29:42.461 --> 00:29:45.610
and still go out with the kid and like do your thing.
I think that's great.

501
00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.460
Do you realize that if I didn't judge people,
we'd both be homeless?

502
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:51.403
It's all I do.

503
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:56.090
<v 1>Um,
I get about,
I told him how I,</v>

504
00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:00.620
I passed out in a black panther and I thought it was in a helicopter crash.

505
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:02.810
<v 2>You did pass out.
But to be fair,</v>

506
00:30:02.811 --> 00:30:05.750
you started booze and before we went and I had one glass,

507
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:10.790
it was a big glass.
It's a big boy glass.
It's a goal.
Would you will

508
00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:17.630
have a little shippy before the movie?
Oh boy.

509
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.770
Yeah.
Anyway,
you had a,
you had a big last and then you know,

510
00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.490
we did the other thing.
So I'll tell you right now,

511
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.890
I've worked a lot of that thing.

512
00:30:24.891 --> 00:30:28.070
I were pretty faded so I wasn't even buzzed off of that.

513
00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.660
You were the walking down the street,
you were psycho weed.

514
00:30:32.661 --> 00:30:37.280
I always forget to just take a hit and a half.
I don't have cycle.
We,

515
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:39.950
yeah,
yeah,
I am.

516
00:30:39.951 --> 00:30:43.790
And I went in there and all of a sudden digits my brother and I was just

517
00:30:43.791 --> 00:30:48.380
tripping.
Yeah.
And then I passed out in that,
that spaceship or something crashed.

518
00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.760
Did you feel when I

519
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.710
do bad,
you passed out?
Cause it was a really good movie.

520
00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:00.140
I thought it was a growing.
When I saw,
I saw,
I really enjoyed the ACA was great.

521
00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:03.800
I liked the envelope brother.
I'm going to see it.

522
00:31:03.801 --> 00:31:05.740
And evil brother in the evil white dude were great.

523
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:09.440
So I like the evil brother too.
Actually.
I don't feel like,

524
00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.830
I don't want to spoil it for those who,
yeah,
let's stop talking about it.

525
00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.730
All right.
I guess it only just came out,
but um,

526
00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:20.240
I'm going to go see it again tomorrow and four dx.
Have you ever heard of this?

527
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:21.520
What are they going to do?
They're going to get,

528
00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:26.540
it's like a universal ride where the seats move and maybe they miss it with a

529
00:31:26.631 --> 00:31:29.540
garden hose.
I don't really feel like it's necessary for all that.

530
00:31:29.541 --> 00:31:33.960
So I'm glad we saw the record.
Look at this chair.
I'm just,

531
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:38.510
I'm glad we saw the regular version cause so I could really concentrate on the

532
00:31:38.511 --> 00:31:39.344
story.

533
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.400
<v 1>Okay,
so what are they gonna do if they're gonna like throw stuff at you?
I,</v>

534
00:31:44.401 --> 00:31:49.160
I have no idea.
We'll see.
It's like Gallagher if meat's going to the movies.

535
00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:50.540
Yeah.
God,
I hope not.

536
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:55.120
That's Calgary's got great material though and nobody understood that.

537
00:31:55.121 --> 00:31:58.250
I'm telling you that that sled dramatic was ironic.

538
00:31:58.251 --> 00:32:01.600
He was making fun of advertising and then everybody took it at face value.
Like,

539
00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:01.810
okay,

540
00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:03.660
<v 2>oh I hope he change the big thing.</v>

541
00:32:03.661 --> 00:32:07.920
A cottage cheese and I get hit in the face with it.
Yeah.
They didn't get it.

542
00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:12.510
What's that?
What are you giving me anyways?
Yeah.
Let me do it.

543
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.000
I got to read a little bit of the,
uh,
the advertising,
right.
Well,

544
00:32:15.001 --> 00:32:17.820
we came in to say,
oh,
just say good night,

545
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:22.350
sleep tight then plasms rooms.
Do you,

546
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.410
<v 1>it was a wish and a prayer we saw.</v>

547
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.560
Is that what's you every day I was in the Lawrence Welk show will come true.

Vito Zane.

550
00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.910
Good night.
And then they'd come in with,

551
00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.220
is that the end of the Lawrence Welk show?

552
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:47.680
<v 2>Is he the guy,
the front arm?
That was basically our soul train.</v>

553
00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:53.250
Black people stole soul train from that was the results right now.

554
00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:58.930
Bobby and Susie or nap time.
Hey.
Oh good.
It was boring.

555
00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:02.680
Is that the um,
sorry.
Uh,

556
00:33:02.681 --> 00:33:07.450

we'll do an invitation of on um,

557
00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:08.920
on SNL?

558
00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:10.470

Bruh.

712
00:42:47.241 --> 00:42:47.510
You know what?

713
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:50.090
Now I feel bad that I made fun of figure skaters because I remember seeing this

714
00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:54.590
African American woman and she was out there killing it,

715
00:42:54.591 --> 00:42:55.790
doing back flips and shit,

716
00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:59.660
and they couldn't deal with how fucking strong she was.
And they're like,

717
00:42:59.661 --> 00:43:02.630
that's not what a woman looks like.
So I felt bad for her.

718
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.160
I guess I just don't feel bad for Tonya Harding.
You know what I mean?

719
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:09.440
And I don't buy that.
She didn't know it.
You know what I mean?

720
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:10.760
If somebody is going to go out of their way,

721
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:14.630
one of those guys was going to go out of their way to smash somebody's knee.

722
00:43:14.631 --> 00:43:15.464
So you would win.

723
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:18.500
They're going to let you know because they're obviously trying to fuck you.

724
00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:21.110
Right.
That would have been my argument if I was a prosecution.

725
00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:26.330
What kind of guy goes out and breaks the knee of another woman for another woman

726
00:43:26.331 --> 00:43:30.710
without telling her.
I mean he's a guy.
All right.
He's a heterosexual guy.

727
00:43:30.711 --> 00:43:34.340
I mean it's somewhere there has to be a blow job at the end of the rainbow or

728
00:43:34.341 --> 00:43:38.750
reason not getting out of bed in the morning.
No further questions.
All right.

729
00:43:38.751 --> 00:43:39.584
Gun Control.

730
00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:42.160
<v 0>Ah,</v>

731
00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.030
<v 1>Jay Jay's.
I stepped into it with this one.</v>

732
00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.400
I'm trying to see if we can just,
somebody can just explain to me.

733
00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:56.040
Uh,
I'm open minded about it cause I don't know shit about guns.

734
00:43:56.041 --> 00:43:59.430
Why you need an Ar 15 to fucking defend your house?

735
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.710
Do people break into your house in packs of 40 that's all I'm asking.

736
00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.830
Or is it,
is it better in a tight spot?
You know,

737
00:44:07.831 --> 00:44:11.880
my big thing with any gun is how loud is it?
You know,

738
00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:15.390
how loud is it?
Like,
cause I don't want,
if my ears I've already fucked up.

739
00:44:15.391 --> 00:44:18.900
You know what I mean?
I can't even use a cap gun.
Um,

740
00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:24.070
I think I'm going to go with just like bear Mace,
you know.

741
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:27.540
All right.
Gun Control.
I love it.

742
00:44:27.541 --> 00:44:30.480
He's spraying mace and then the guys still coming at you and then you got to run

743
00:44:30.481 --> 00:44:31.230
through the,

744
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:35.700
that you just fucking spray now you're both fucking can't see shit like gun

745
00:44:35.701 --> 00:44:40.110
control.
Here we go.
Billy.
Red Balls of fire.
A huge fan and love your work.

746
00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.720
Much respect and enjoy your success.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

747
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.430
I'm a lifetime NRA member and I believe in the second amendment out.

748
00:44:47.431 --> 00:44:49.650
Jesus fucking Christ.
We get it.

749
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:56.010
I'm a Metallica fan and I like to rock.
Well,
can we not be so fucking redundant?

750
00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:01.740
Jesus fucking Christ Kate.
But,
but being that it is an amendment,

751
00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:06.300
we could change it to correct it for today's of everyday events and happenings.

752
00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:07.261
All right.

753
00:45:07.261 --> 00:45:11.610
These school shootings could be narrowed down if we would do a way with assault

754
00:45:11.611 --> 00:45:15.360
rifles.
Now.
I know there's a lot of gun people right now going,

755
00:45:15.361 --> 00:45:19.500
this isn't a real gun person.
This is somebody,
some liberal fuck and he hippie.

756
00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.170
He glued a bear to his face.

757
00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:26.520
He rented a bass boat and then he sanded this and font to act like he speaks for

758
00:45:26.521 --> 00:45:28.290
me.
He does not.
All right.

759
00:45:28.291 --> 00:45:31.350
These school shootings could be narrowed down if we would do away with assault

760
00:45:31.351 --> 00:45:34.080
rifles.
Yes,
there would still be violence in schools,

761
00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:39.380
but a 20 or 12 gauge shotgun is a lot harder to hide than a nine millimeter

762
00:45:39.721 --> 00:45:43.670
glock.
I also have a good idea right now you can go to a,

763
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:48.120
to a bass pro shop,
Walmart and half a dozen other stores to buy ammo.

764
00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.720
Since here in New York we have to register our guns annually.

765
00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:56.400
We could also make a state run ammo only store.

766
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:59.400
State run.
Okay.
A state run ammo only store,

767
00:45:59.401 --> 00:46:03.510
kind of like Canada's beer liquor store by your guns,
wherever.

768
00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:07.710
Register them with the state annually and by your ammo through the state.

769
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:13.070
That way any large or odd ammo purchases would be tracked along with your

770
00:46:13.411 --> 00:46:17.430
background check.
It's really the best idea I can come up with.
As always.

771
00:46:17.431 --> 00:46:21.900
Hello to the lovely Nia and thank you for putting up with his ginger ass and

772
00:46:21.901 --> 00:46:26.550
bill.
Go Fuck Yourself.
That's hilarious.
Um,
all right,

773
00:46:26.551 --> 00:46:31.020
so there's some ideas.
There's some ideas.
Uh,
all right,

774
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:35.310
it's okay.
Mass shooting proposals.

775
00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.290
Hey there,
willingness to bills.
Um,

776
00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:44.550
here's my proposal to reduce mass shootings,
get communities to come together.

777
00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:47.400
It seems like a simple idea,
but here's my logic.

778
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:50.430
How many people interact with or even know their neighbors?

779
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:54.690
My parents divorced when I was four years old and during my alternating custody

780
00:46:54.691 --> 00:46:59.010
I noticed a few major differences in their individual happiness.
And one of the,

781
00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:04.030
my minor Dietz and one of the minor details period was my mother always made it

782
00:47:05.011 --> 00:47:09.480
a point to say hi to her neighbors and hand out cards on the holidays where my

783
00:47:09.481 --> 00:47:12.390
father avoided neighbors at all costs.
It sounds like me.

784
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:17.850
And also was talking shit and saying negative things also sounds like me as an

785
00:47:17.851 --> 00:47:19.680
adult,
I don't dole out kiss,

786
00:47:19.681 --> 00:47:23.250
but I do make it a point to say hi and shoot the shit with all my neighbors.

787
00:47:23.251 --> 00:47:27.180
I believe of communities regularly interacted or even held monthly or seasonal

788
00:47:27.181 --> 00:47:28.440
events like block parties.

789
00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:32.440
They could build a trust and dependence for each other and if you notice a

790
00:47:32.441 --> 00:47:34.870
neighbor kid acting shady,

791
00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.500
it could be noted in the kid could get the help they needed without feeling

792
00:47:38.501 --> 00:47:42.040
disconnected in abandoned.
As I said,
it's a simple solution.

793
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:45.910
As much as I'm a simple man,
may one or more gods or fewer,

794
00:47:45.911 --> 00:47:48.360
bless you and your family and go fuck yourself.
Ps,

795
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:51.730
I was raised around people of the LDS faith,

796
00:47:51.731 --> 00:47:55.360
Mormons and I see these interactions between them regularly.

797
00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:59.170
Anecdotal evidence or not.
It's an idea.
All right.

798
00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:06.160
Okay.
Uh,
gun response.
I just want to hear what people have to say.

799
00:48:06.161 --> 00:48:08.620
I usually comment on the shit.
I just haven't really,

800
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:11.890
I don't need it cause I don't know shit about this.
I guess that's what it is.

801
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:17.960
No one has been able to tell me why you need,
yeah,

802
00:48:17.961 --> 00:48:21.410
it's just a gun owner would be fucking honest.
When it comes to assault rifles,

803
00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:25.430
why do you want to know?
Why?
What do you need an assault rifle for?
And it's like,

804
00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.390
I don't need one.

805
00:48:26.391 --> 00:48:30.560
It's just fucking awesome to just go down to the gun range to go.
Yeah,

806
00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:33.350
I did tech,
tech,
tech,
Tech Tech.
Right.
And just fucking have a good time with it.

807
00:48:33.351 --> 00:48:35.420
It's like,
who needs a fucking Ferrari?
Nobody.

808
00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:36.843
<v 3>Right.</v>

809
00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:40.230
<v 1>Nobody needs a fucking Ferrari.
All you need is a god.</v>

810
00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:44.880
You'd have fucking a Prius to get to work,
but who doesn't want a Ferrari?

811
00:48:44.881 --> 00:48:48.810
They're awesome,
but in the wrong hands.
All right,
gun response.

812
00:48:48.811 --> 00:48:53.760
Billy band bullets.
I never said to Ben Bullets.
Love the podcast like that.

813
00:48:53.761 --> 00:48:56.370
You're a very humble guy.
I'm completely full of myself,
sir.

814
00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:58.140
Doing stand up at night is not enough.

815
00:48:58.141 --> 00:49:00.960
I have to still have a microphone in my hands,
even in my house.

816
00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:02.360
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

817
00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.490
<v 1>Um,
okay.
I love,</v>

818
00:49:03.491 --> 00:49:08.491
I grew up in South Alabama and I'm just getting out of the Marine Corp offers a

819
00:49:08.591 --> 00:49:13.000
training.
Stereotypically,
I'm a conservative with a moderate knowledge of guns.

820
00:49:13.001 --> 00:49:14.140
So to answer your question,

821
00:49:14.141 --> 00:49:17.890
the second amendment is to protect yourself and others from tyranny.
Exactly.

822
00:49:17.891 --> 00:49:20.710
That's why the what that other guy saying that only the state should give out

823
00:49:20.711 --> 00:49:25.360
the bullets that dad I didn't like because I don't trust,

824
00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:29.290
I'm not like,
I don't touch the Gobi me man.

825
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:32.100
Just the way that it's set up right now.

826
00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:33.953
<v 3>MMM.</v>

827
00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:38.450
<v 1>It's just,
I dunno,
it's just,
it's not a,</v>

828
00:49:38.451 --> 00:49:43.450
it's not a good thing if only the people who are in control have the weapons.

829
00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:45.563
<v 3>MMM.</v>

830
00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:50.090
<v 1>Yeah.
I,
I just don't think that,
you know,
we already see what it's like if the,</v>

831
00:49:50.091 --> 00:49:53.880
if only the people in control own basically all the major news sources.

832
00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:57.540
You see what it's done to this fucking country.
If you fucking paying attention,

833
00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:01.020
um,
how few things you can talk about,

834
00:50:01.021 --> 00:50:05.070
which is why everybody is sitting around talking and calling everybody heroes

835
00:50:05.071 --> 00:50:09.330
and this and that and fucking this person's brave and this person's a bad person

836
00:50:09.331 --> 00:50:10.950
and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
It's like,
well,

837
00:50:10.951 --> 00:50:13.110
they just take turns solid until like,
we all went back to school.

838
00:50:13.111 --> 00:50:16.740
Like we're sitting on a fucking playground and we have major goddamn problems

839
00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:21.780
that nobody's talking about,
you know?
Um,
I'm off my high horse.
Okay.

840
00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:23.960
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

841
00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:27.550
<v 1>A stereotypically I'm considering,
okay.
Seems farfetched.</v>

842
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:31.310
But look up deaths from government tyranny in the last century.

843
00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:36.140
Semiautomatic rifles like the armalite 15,

844
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:39.020
I guess that's the Ar 15 Aka the ar 15.
Yep.

845
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:44.030
Are the minimum needed firepower for a guerrilla militia to fight organized

846
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:45.050
militaries.

847
00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:50.590
Ar 15 is not a military grade weapon or assault rifle by official standards.

848
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:55.100
The main reason being effective firing range,
uh,

849
00:50:55.101 --> 00:50:57.650
pistols are almost as effective at close range.

850
00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:02.300
So a ban on ars won't do much if anything for most of these horrible events.

851
00:51:02.301 --> 00:51:07.130
And we'll eliminate purpose of second amendment.
Well,
I mean,

852
00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:11.480
when our,
wait a minute,
dude,
wait a minute.
The how much,

853
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:14.630
how fast you can shoot and how many people you can fucking hit.
I mean,

854
00:51:14.631 --> 00:51:18.770
if you walk into a crowded area,
how good his shot they have to be.

855
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:23.070
Um,
I just wish one of these gun people would just be able to say,

856
00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.710
I don't want him to ban an ar 15 cause I'm not fucking crazy.

857
00:51:25.711 --> 00:51:28.470
And I enjoy shooting the fucking woods up with this thing.

858
00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.790
<v 3>It's fun.
Um,</v>

859
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:35.880
<v 1>I just,
there has to be a way,</v>

860
00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.900
it just can't be that fucking easy

861
00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.930
for a fucking lunatic to get their hands on it.
Because the bottom line is,

862
00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:48.980
there's nothing wrong with guns as long as you're not a fucking lunatic.

863
00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:50.131
But the problem is,

864
00:51:50.131 --> 00:51:54.770
is it's obviously too easy as a lunatic to get one.

865
00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:59.640
Does that make sense to gun people?
Noncom there?
I mean,

866
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:01.740
guns are fucking great.

867
00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:06.120
Like I can guarantee I have a baseball bat under my bed and I can guaran fucking

868
00:52:06.121 --> 00:52:08.100
tee.
If anybody came in my house,

869
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:12.000
what's the one fucking thing I would wish that I had?
I wish I had a fucking gun.

870
00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:14.880
You know,
my,
my wife doesn't like him.
She's afraid of him,

871
00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:18.450
which I get now we got a kid,
so I'm not,
you know,
not going to fucking do that.

872
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:20.233
<v 3>MMM.</v>

873
00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:25.730
<v 1>You know,
I,
you know,
and I also don't think,
you know,
if you get a turn,</v>

874
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:27.330
everybody turned in their fucking guns.

875
00:52:27.331 --> 00:52:30.670
The only people that can do that are honest people.
What a bad people.

876
00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:32.850
They'd be like,
well,
I guess we've got to turn it up fucking guns.

877
00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:34.653
<v 3>MMM.</v>

878
00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:37.030
<v 1>I just,
it has to be some sort of,</v>

879
00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.380
<v 3>uh,
okay.</v>

880
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.550
<v 1>I don't know how to fuck.
Do you figure out who's fucking nuts or not?</v>

881
00:52:42.551 --> 00:52:45.400
That's the problem.
Anyways,
subsequent,
subsequently,

882
00:52:45.401 --> 00:52:49.000
almost all gun deaths are from pistols.
Solution increase,

883
00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:53.440
increase the age of legal purchase to 21 for anything except pump action,

884
00:52:53.441 --> 00:52:57.790
shotguns and black powder rifles,
pistols.

885
00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:02.650
You already have to be 21.
Okay.
Also armed security at schools,

886
00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:07.630
not a cure.
Uh,
all but better than nothing.
Yeah.

887
00:53:07.631 --> 00:53:09.700
Why don't they have armed people in schools?
You know,

888
00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:11.980
I wouldn't have a problem with that.
By the way,

889
00:53:11.981 --> 00:53:16.240
founding fathers had a concept of machine guns and certainly of semiautomatic.

890
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:21.100
They weren't using micro aggressions.
Aggressions,
you,
Cali Lib.

891
00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:26.310
What do you mean they had a concept?
I have a concept of a flying fucking car.

892
00:53:26.311 --> 00:53:28.300
Do I know what that's gonna do to the world?

893
00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:30.150
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

894
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:33.570
<v 1>Um,
Hope Paul,
that clarifies a point of view without being too in depth.</v>

895
00:53:33.571 --> 00:53:37.800
Thanks for question.
You're questioning your stance on the issue.

896
00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:42.240
Um,
what was their,

897
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:45.510
what was their concept and how do you know they had a concept?

898
00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:48.360
Did new evidence show that they had this,

899
00:53:48.361 --> 00:53:49.750
what did they have beyond what that will,

900
00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:53.880
that first one that came up with what it had to be like pushed by nine people

901
00:53:53.881 --> 00:53:56.950
and then he had your little crank and get,
get,
dig,
dig,
dig,
dig,
dig,
dig,
dig,
dig,

902
00:53:56.951 --> 00:53:59.160
dig,
dig,
dig.
You know.

903
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.610
Then the guy who came up with the machine gun,

904
00:54:02.611 --> 00:54:06.480
he wanted to do that to lower depths are heard some other bullshit I heard like

905
00:54:06.481 --> 00:54:07.021
he was just like,

906
00:54:07.021 --> 00:54:11.910
well this thing can shoot as much as an entire platoon so you won't have to have

907
00:54:11.911 --> 00:54:12.480
a platoon.

908
00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.880
Then you can have less people in the army because this person's going to be

909
00:54:14.881 --> 00:54:18.150
shooting just as much.
And then all the Sickos at the top are like dead.

910
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:20.940
We will have a platoon,
a platoon with all machine guns.

911
00:54:20.941 --> 00:54:23.370
And it just keeps a grass.
That's war.

912
00:54:23.371 --> 00:54:26.250
That's a completely different fucking thing.
Um,

913
00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:30.420
I'm going to go out on a limb and I don't think the founding fathers had a

914
00:54:30.421 --> 00:54:34.110
concept of what the fuck of,
of the,
the level of population.

915
00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:35.671
I mean,

916
00:54:35.671 --> 00:54:40.350
there's just so much was fucking different back then that they had the concept

917
00:54:40.351 --> 00:54:45.180
of an ar 15 and a fucking food court in the 17 hundreds.
I,
you know,

918
00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:49.770
maybe they did.
I mean,
they weren't,
they were pretty,
you know,
I dunno.

919
00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:53.120
Flying Kites with keys on him.
I'm a guest that makes you a smart guy.
I Dunno.

920
00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:57.120
All right.
Um,
all right.
Gun.
Yeah,

921
00:54:57.121 --> 00:55:00.150
but I liked this because nobody's telling me to go fuck myself or anything like

922
00:55:00.151 --> 00:55:03.000
that.
You notice people when you just sort of ask what you'd thinking,

923
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:07.650
people will then act civilized and as opposed to all you idiots.
Don't fucking,

924
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:08.840
I shouldn't say it,
folks.
You,

925
00:55:08.841 --> 00:55:12.810
all of you individuals who all have a right to your opinion,

926
00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:16.830
the way you guys address each other on social media is,
you know,

927
00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.950
I don't know.
It's just the quickest way to have an a vein.

928
00:55:19.951 --> 00:55:23.880
Pop it out of your forehead.
All right.
Gun,
ESPN,
Billy Muskett Mug.

929
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:26.220
I don't know what that means is funny.

930
00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:29.760
You write about the media turning the shootings into ESPN for killers.

931
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:33.300
The number they keep throwing around is 18 this year.

932
00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:37.320
They're counting suicide's a time where a gun went off in a car.

933
00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.890
Another was a kid who pulled the police officer's triggering class.

934
00:55:40.891 --> 00:55:43.860
Here's an article about it.
Uh,
no,

935
00:55:43.861 --> 00:55:47.070
I was saying that when the mass shootings,
the way,

936
00:55:47.071 --> 00:55:50.880
the way they say like this is the deadliest,
this is the third deadliest,

937
00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.550
this is the most blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

938
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.940
And then they splattered a person's face all over the fucking news.

939
00:55:56.941 --> 00:56:00.270
And I just don't think that they should show the person they should die

940
00:56:00.271 --> 00:56:03.420
anonymously.
Uh,
and that's it.

941
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:06.300
I wouldn't even like not even cover the fucking story.

942
00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:08.570
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

943
00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:10.220
<v 1>I mean,
the people that need to know,</v>

944
00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:15.230
no people that lost people or add people affected by it.
I okay.

945
00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:18.890
And I dunno to go beyond that.

946
00:56:18.891 --> 00:56:20.870
Then what am I sitting there watching it for a second?

947
00:56:20.871 --> 00:56:24.160
Watch people cry and see people with the worst day of their fucking life.

948
00:56:24.161 --> 00:56:28.840
Why do I need to know that,
that that happened?
Okay.

949
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.930
Law enforcement is going to get the person,

950
00:56:31.931 --> 00:56:34.540
they're going to fucking prosecute him and all of that type of shit.

951
00:56:34.541 --> 00:56:37.270
Why do I need to know that that is going on?

952
00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:42.160
I can't defend myself against it.
I'm not going to go do it.

953
00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:47.500
Right.
However,
if you some Sicko and you're watching that shit,

954
00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:48.873
you know,

955
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:53.110
I think Sickos watched those stories the way you know,

956
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:57.530
I used to watch rock bands and it made me want to play drums.
Um,
all right.

957
00:56:57.550 --> 00:57:01.560
Non Americans view on guns.
Uh,

958
00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:05.200
I'm of the opinion that the occasional mass killing in the u s is the price you

959
00:57:05.201 --> 00:57:10.090
pay for your government not turning in and do Hitler's Germany or Stalin's

960
00:57:10.091 --> 00:57:10.924
Russia.

961
00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:16.030
It might be the only thing keeping your government from going full retard.

962
00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:17.880
My country,
New Zealand,

963
00:57:17.881 --> 00:57:22.881
the New Zealand might be protected in turn by the stability of the USA.

964
00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:24.723
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

965
00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:27.780
<v 1>Uh,
I'm deck guy must be way smarter than I am.</v>

966
00:57:27.781 --> 00:57:29.070
I don't know what the fuck any of that means.

967
00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:34.180
I'm of the opinion that the casual mass killings is the EU USA in the USA is the

968
00:57:34.981 --> 00:57:38.160
price you pay for government not turning into Hitler's Jeremy of Stalin's
Russia.

969
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:43.140
So because we're,
we're allowed to be freer than them,
the price we pay.
Is that,

970
00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:44.593
is that what you're saying?

971
00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:49.600
And it might be the only thing keeping your government from going full retard.

972
00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:54.670
Uh,
which if you look at the economics of the war that we're fighting,

973
00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:58.540
it has because I don't know how we keep doing this

974
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.650
or why we're throwing this much money.

975
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:04.400
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

976
00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:08.490
<v 1>Uh,
you know,
I dunno.
You know,
why the fuck we're doing it.</v>

977
00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:12.240
Everybody does.
Alright.
Lifting weights.
Hey Bill,

978
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:13.680
I'm a longtime fan of the podcast.

979
00:58:13.681 --> 00:58:16.740
Just wanted to respond to your comment about not lifting weights.

980
00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:19.950
While it's a great that you recognize the negatives of lifting weights as a

981
00:58:19.951 --> 00:58:20.940
primary routine,

982
00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:24.690
I would not count out curling a few dumbbells every now and then.

983
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.150
They spent a lot of research about the cardiovascular benefits to basic

984
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:32.760
weightlifting.
I suggest low weight,
high reps at least once a week.
Thank you.

985
00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:35.430
I 100% agree with that.
All right.

986
00:58:35.431 --> 00:58:39.060
But the problem is is I came up in the 80s so it's all about doing what are you

987
00:58:39.061 --> 00:58:44.061
benching and how I got hurt was a one time in my life I was able to put up to 25

988
00:58:44.310 --> 00:58:47.760
which is two 45 is on both sides.
I finally felt like a big boy in the gym.

989
00:58:48.090 --> 00:58:52.880
So like an asshole whenever I first hurt myself,
which will,

990
00:58:52.881 --> 00:58:56.490
I think I was a 48 you know,
I already,

991
00:58:56.550 --> 00:59:00.870
I a year ago this past October,
so that would be 20 in October,

992
00:59:00.871 --> 00:59:02.940
2016 a fucking Jim put in.

993
00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:06.270
I was all excited and I fucking,

994
00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:10.050
the first day fucked up my shoulder and I had never done it before so I just

995
00:59:10.051 --> 00:59:13.830
tried to push through it and I kept lifting and now it's just completely,

996
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:17.310
it's completely fucked up.
And every time,

997
00:59:17.311 --> 00:59:20.760
I think I'm getting towards the end of it.
Like I have,
you know,

998
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:23.600
I now have this strength back where I can like,
you know,

999
00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:28.550
pick up shit and everything,
but my mobility is really fucked up.
So,
uh,

1000
00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:34.220
I haven't been to the physical therapy in a minute.
I gotta get back to that,

1001
00:59:34.221 --> 00:59:36.140
but I just spend it,
got a little busy here.
But um,

1002
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:38.780
I agree with that 100% use it or lose it.
But you know,

1003
00:59:38.781 --> 00:59:42.680
don't try to fucking lift what you lifted when you were 20.
All right.

1004
00:59:42.681 --> 00:59:45.020
My wife is nuts.
Hey guys,

1005
00:59:45.021 --> 00:59:48.220
keep us sending shit in about the gun control stuff because I think it's,

1006
00:59:48.221 --> 00:59:50.690
it's really interesting as far as like a,

1007
00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:53.443
<v 3>you know,</v>

1008
00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:58.240
<v 1>to just hear people's opinions and where they're from and why they view stuff</v>

1009
00:59:58.241 --> 01:00:01.930
the way they do without fucking screaming at each other.

1010
01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:04.570
And hopefully,
you know,
I dunno,

1011
01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:08.740
I just can somebody way in how,
okay,

1012
01:00:08.741 --> 01:00:13.390
whether you're pro gun or not pro gun.
All right.

1013
01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:17.410
How,
uh,
you know,
cause psychos do a lot of shit.

1014
01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:22.840
PSYCHOS getting cars and they drive into fucking people.
And all of that shit.

1015
01:00:22.841 --> 01:00:24.820
You know what I mean?
They don't try to fucking make,

1016
01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.180
take cars away from everybody.
I know that's overly simplifying it,

1017
01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:33.750
<v 3>but,
um,
you know,
I think it's,</v>

1018
01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.333
I don't know.

1019
01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:37.860
<v 1>I just don't,
I don't even know.
I'm not into guns.</v>

1020
01:00:37.861 --> 01:00:39.180
I just don't look at them like they're these,

1021
01:00:39.181 --> 01:00:42.690
these fucking like they were alive and they have the devil in him.

1022
01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.160
Um,
I do find them scary.
You know,

1023
01:00:47.161 --> 01:00:50.210
I have gone to gun ranges and I shoot and it's fun.
Once she kind of,

1024
01:00:50.211 --> 01:00:53.880
it's like anything first started flying a helicopter,
I was like,

1025
01:00:53.881 --> 01:00:55.680
is this thing going to chop my fucking head off?

1026
01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:58.710
And then once you get into the physics and how the whole thing works,

1027
01:00:58.711 --> 01:01:02.520
it becomes absolutely fascinating.
So,
uh,
you know,

1028
01:01:02.521 --> 01:01:05.190
I think those people go skeet shooting.
I think that's the shit.

1029
01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:08.520
And I think people that hunt this is fucking amazing,

1030
01:01:08.521 --> 01:01:11.310
that they know how to do that and build a fire and survive outside.

1031
01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.700
It's probably an important thing that you need to know how to do.

1032
01:01:14.701 --> 01:01:18.370
I respect all of that shit.
It's just a how to,

1033
01:01:18.371 --> 01:01:21.150
so in those people should be allowed to continue doing that.

1034
01:01:21.151 --> 01:01:24.990
I just wished there was a fucking way that you could figure out when somebody

1035
01:01:24.991 --> 01:01:28.910
came up to be like,
may maybe that's dead.

1036
01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:33.140
Something good for Alexa is everybody bugs their house.
Right?

1037
01:01:33.141 --> 01:01:37.400
Maybe one of those fucking lunatics will be muttering to themselves,
you know,

1038
01:01:37.401 --> 01:01:38.910
God knows I have a little camera in there.

1039
01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:41.510
They'll see the person fucking bringing all this fucking ammo.

1040
01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:46.410
<v 3>Um,
I dunno.</v>

1041
01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:51.310
<v 1>Even then,
it's just even if he'd be limited,
the amount of ammunition,</v>

1042
01:01:51.311 --> 01:01:55.120
the amount of fucking damage that you can do just by,

1043
01:01:55.121 --> 01:01:57.790
I would think just buying a box of bullets.
It's fucking nuts.

1044
01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:01.350
I didn't like talking about it.
It's so fucking creepy.
All right.
Wife is not,

1045
01:02:01.351 --> 01:02:05.770
but I appreciate everybody commonly discussing this and I respect all the

1046
01:02:05.771 --> 01:02:10.480
opinions.
All right.
Wife has nuts.
Bill,
longtime listener of the podcast.
Do,

1047
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:15.510
can you shed a light on why my wife is unable to have a real conversation about

1048
01:02:15.581 --> 01:02:20.400
anything tangible politics,
current events,
music,
sports,
et Cetera.

1049
01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:21.990
Uh,

1050
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:26.990
I swear she has no interest outside of her work and trashy TV,

1051
01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:32.520
teen mom,
TLC shows,
et cetera.
It's kind of sad.
She used to be so interesting,

1052
01:02:32.521 --> 01:02:37.260
but now that she's a mom,
she's a boar.
Well,
she's tired,

1053
01:02:37.261 --> 01:02:41.040
man.
Life is just not fun to her.
I love being a father,

1054
01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:45.300
but I just sense she can't handle the life side of her life.

1055
01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.940
What gives?
She's a fantastic mother to a son,

1056
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.910
but his mailing it in as a wife.

1057
01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:51.863
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1058
01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:57.900
<v 1>All right.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I've run into these kinds of problems.</v>

1059
01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:02.150
All right.
Um,
you know,

1060
01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:06.790
shit changes obviously when you have a kid,
but with a woman,
like,

1061
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.610
I don't even know what the fuck's going on.

1062
01:03:08.611 --> 01:03:11.270
They have like thunder and lightning going on in between their fucking ears,

1063
01:03:11.271 --> 01:03:14.270
like all hormones and all this crap and they get a c section.

1064
01:03:14.271 --> 01:03:16.400
They got to recover from a major abdominal surgery.

1065
01:03:16.401 --> 01:03:20.240
They go through a lot of stuff.
Plus,
you know,
their body literally changes.

1066
01:03:20.241 --> 01:03:23.780
They put on weight and shit and it's like so easy to fall into a depression,

1067
01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:27.410
get overwhelmed and all of that type of shit.
So I would say

1068
01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.053
<v 3>mmm,</v>

1069
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:31.300
<v 1>you know,</v>

1070
01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:35.050
you're doing the guy thing where you just bare bones talking about it going,

1071
01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.110
she unable to have a real conversation about anything tangible.

1072
01:03:38.111 --> 01:03:40.600
I can tell you why my wife watches trashy TV.

1073
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:44.170
She sometimes just doesn't want to think.
Okay.

1074
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:48.940
And you know the level of worry that they have,

1075
01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:51.310
you know about what's going to happen.
The Kid,

1076
01:03:51.311 --> 01:03:53.770
am I doing a good job and all that type of shit.
What you need to do.

1077
01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:57.490
You need to have a date night,
once a week,
once every two weeks,

1078
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000
get a sitter and go out and kind of get that going again.

1079
01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:06.520
All right.
And uh,
I think your wife will enjoy it.

1080
01:04:06.521 --> 01:04:09.340
You guys will enjoy each other's company.
You got to have,
you know,

1081
01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:11.140
most of your life is going to be about the kid,

1082
01:04:11.141 --> 01:04:14.320
but you got to have that one little thing,
right.
That's what I would do.

1083
01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:17.020
And all the shit that you said to me,
I would not say to her.

1084
01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:24.790
So,
um,
anyways,
that is the,
uh,

1085
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:27.310
that is a park.
Oh,
did anybody see when the,
uh,

1086
01:04:27.311 --> 01:04:31.870
the Bruins played the Calgary flames at home and they had the reunion of the,

1087
01:04:31.871 --> 01:04:32.650
uh,

1088
01:04:32.650 --> 01:04:37.650
1977 78 Boston Bruins set set a record even though they lost back to back years.

1089
01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:42.910
What's the Canadians or the finals?
Fucking heartbreaking losses.
But um,

1090
01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:48.900
that team had like the most 20 or more goals scores on it and all of these guys

1091
01:04:49.481 --> 01:04:53.860
I hadn't seen in a wreck right when I started watching hockey.

1092
01:04:54.730 --> 01:04:58.630
Uh,
these guys were what the Bruins?
It was Wayne Cashman.
Terry O'reilly,

1093
01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:03.460
Stan,
Jonathan,
uh,
Peter McNabb.

1094
01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:06.143
Uh,

1095
01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.360
<v 3>okay.</v>

1096
01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:12.360
<v 1>Deborah Jean metallic genre tell he was gone by the time I started watching John</v>

1097
01:05:13.571 --> 01:05:16.250
went sick was gone.
But I'll be just talking about the 20 goal scores.
Yeah.

1098
01:05:16.251 --> 01:05:20.560
Rick Middleton,
he was one of my favorites.
Um,

1099
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:23.980
they did this great thing where they had a,

1100
01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.150
they just brought him back and they've shown all the highlights and they had don

1101
01:05:28.151 --> 01:05:32.050
cherry come out.
He was the coach at the time.
And um,

1102
01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:35.260
I,
it was so fucking great to see those guys.

1103
01:05:35.261 --> 01:05:37.870
And he did all these interviews and laugh and they're all fucking young hockey

1104
01:05:37.871 --> 01:05:41.050
plays of the shit that was just for the most part,

1105
01:05:41.051 --> 01:05:43.780
just humble and that type of thing.
And they will laugh and I'm like,

1106
01:05:43.781 --> 01:05:46.000
stand your honor.
The Hey,
you are known as a tough customer.

1107
01:05:46.001 --> 01:05:49.500
It's like one of the toughest fucking guys that ever played.
And he's like,
Hey,

1108
01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:52.120
I had a couple of scraps of whatever,
just yeah,
whatever.

1109
01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.610
It doesn't need to prove anything.
And um,

1110
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.090
I actually only watched the first period and we played horrible defense in that

1111
01:05:58.091 --> 01:06:01.060
game.
I hope we fucking ended up winning that.
But,
uh,

1112
01:06:01.061 --> 01:06:03.340
I'm trying to hang in there with the Bruins and the Celtics.

1113
01:06:03.341 --> 01:06:05.650
I know I haven't been talking about as much this year,
but,
uh,

1114
01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.450
my kid became mobile,

1115
01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:12.550
so I spend most of my life running around after her and uh,

1116
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:16.390
when she goes to sleep,
I sleep.
You know what I mean?

1117
01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:21.200
It's like that ludicrous song,
right when you move,
when I move you move.

1118
01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:24.550
I'd see other way when she sleeps,
you sleep just like that.

1119
01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.230
Will you see whatever the fucking song is?

1120
01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:29.650
That's what I always sing when I put her down.
While you sleep,

1121
01:06:29.651 --> 01:06:31.540
I sleep just like dad.
She goes,
he,

1122
01:06:31.541 --> 01:06:34.570
he and she fucking laughs at falls asleep and then I shut my eyes,

1123
01:06:34.571 --> 01:06:38.560
which feels like five seconds.
Then I have to wake back up again,

1124
01:06:39.070 --> 01:06:42.780
which is probably why I fell asleep during the phenomenal black pant that go
out,

1125
01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:45.430
check it out.
Uh,
really enjoyed that movie.

1126
01:06:45.431 --> 01:06:47.980
Even though I fell asleep and thought I was in a helicopter crash.

1127
01:06:50.370 --> 01:06:54.220
All right.
That's it in my apology to figure skaters.
You know what I mean?

1128
01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:57.820
Why do you have to be skating around all fucking emaciated?
You don't say?

1129
01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:01.690
I think it's about time.
They got some thickies out there.
All right.

1130
01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:06.220
God knows maybe they can do some new tricks.
Okay.
That's it.
That's the podcast.

1131
01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:07.280
Uh,

1132
01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:11.920

1135
01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:25.990

1138
