1
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.760
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:07.020
It's bill burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.550
November 14th,
2016 what's going on?
I wow.
Yeah.

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.760
Uh,
my voice is a little messed up here because,
uh,
you know,

5
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:19.470
I've been traveling,
traveling,
traveling.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.500
I've been taking my vitamins and cc over in Europe or a Gyno Dinniman's

7
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.790
tomatoes,
um,
Basel.

8
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.200
I don't understand why with ingredients,
you know,
everything else,

9
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:38.190
we pretty much pronounced,
pronounced the same as fucking Great Britain.

10
00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:41.610
But when it comes to spices,
everything is different.
We say Reagan,

11
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:45.120
or we say Bazell they say,
or a Gyno,
Basel,
whatever the fuck they say,

12
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:48.840
tomato vitamins.
Um,

13
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.320
the only time I really experienced that in the United States,
as we say,

14
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:56.730
Carnegie in Pittsburgh says,
Carnegie Bill,
what are you talking about?

15
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.160
I don't fucking know.
I just got off a Goddamn plane and I,
uh,

16
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.820
watched all the football and the way out.
Oh my God.

17
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.910
Underrated flying on football fucking Sunday when it was too fucking games back

18
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:14.410
to back with seven fucking lead changes.
Um,

19
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.030
the boring NFL with their ratings down.
How great was Sunday.

20
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.200
Fucking amazing fucking amazing man.
Um,

21
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.090
that Dallas Pittsburgh game was incredible.
Um,

22
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.070
and the Pittsburgh Seattle game was great and uh,

23
00:01:31.071 --> 00:01:32.520
I know a lot of people would think like the thing,

24
00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:36.300
you know what the thing I was most upset about,
it wasn't the final score.

25
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.610
It wasn't the,
the lack of a call on the last play with Gronk.

26
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.380
It was the Tom Brady picture.

27
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.110
What the fuck was that with his hand on his hip and his other hand up underneath

28
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:53.400
this jar.
What in the fuck was that?

29
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.340
That's what happens when your data's supermodel.
She's in his God damn me.

30
00:01:57.341 --> 00:02:00.780
Or just be like,
Tom,
you're just standing there like everybody else.

31
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.100
You need to establish your brand,
have fun with it.
Be a little Sassy.

32
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.320
Um,
yes,
you're probably not gonna hear this from a lot of patriots fans,

33
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:13.260
but I love the no call at the end of the fucking game.

34
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.180
I am forever sticking up for quarterbacks in the NFL when it comes to their

35
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:22.140
right to be there to try and prevent a score.

36
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.330
You know,

37
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.570
you know how this all started old gym or say out there in Indianapolis couldn't

38
00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:31.800
beat the Patriots defense.
So he's the one that created the whole,
hey,

39
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.630
the cornerback can't even look at the receiver pass five fucking yards,
you know.

40
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.540
So I loved the no call.

41
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.510
I thought Gronk did that thing where he ran right into him.

42
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.060
He didn't quite push off,

43
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.500
but it was one of those gray area thinks you usually get a call on that.

44
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.700
I feel like 70% of the time I'll just throw that stand out there.
You know,

45
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:57.570
I don't read right.
Um,
I love the no call.

46
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.110
I wish that they would do that more.
Um,
but other than that,

47
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:04.810
it was just a great fucking game.
And I liked it too because Seattle,

48
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:07.930
it's kind of just played the game rather than doing all that peacock and around

49
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:10.840
every time they do something,
there was one guy,
that fat guy,

50
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.700
that nose tackle for Seattle.

51
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:16.480
I was fucking dying laughing on the plate that first drive the Patriots had,

52
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:19.900
where they just went right down the field and gave him the old right there.

53
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.250
Fred every fucking play was positive yardage except for one.

54
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.140
So we had like six,
seven plays in a row or just crushing it,
15 yards,

55
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:32.350
10 yards,
eight yards,
20 yards right down the field.

56
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.100
If you judge the game on that first fucking drive,
you'd be like,
oh my God,

57
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:39.790
this is going to be be a fucking landslide.
Right.
And then one plate,

58
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.210
I think they handed it off to Legler Garrett Blunt,

59
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.030
and he just runs in to the offensive line for no gain in that fat dude stands up

60
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.350
and he wags a finger like my tumble over at Bella check and the Patriots bench.

61
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.700
Hey,
all those other players are going to work,
but not that one.

62
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.200
Don't try that one.
It's the funniest shit out of it to me.
But,
um,

63
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.091
you know,

64
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:09.880
it was an amazing game and I actually liked the fact that we lost to them,

65
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:11.170
even though they didn't have Bennett.
You know,

66
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:14.290
they were kind of hurt and we still lost to him and it was in our house,

67
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:18.280
you know,
then I just see our house,
I'm sorry it was in our stadium.
Um,

68
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.360
it didn't bug me because if we meet them again in the playoffs,

69
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.690
I'd rather have last regular season game.
Um,
you know,
they,

70
00:04:26.691 --> 00:04:31.150
we see that shit like,
you know,
you gotta you always learn more during a loss.

71
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.510
I liked way better losing,
you know,

72
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.110
I think the biggest thing that fucked the 2007 Patriots undefeated regular

73
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:43.450
season pages was the fact that we were undefeated also.

74
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.400
Spygate everyone was just rooting against us.

75
00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:50.401
They would've loved it so much more if we went into the playoffs 14 and two or

76
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:54.320
15 and one just to,
you know,
so everybody would,
it didn't like,

77
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.270
it didn't have such a chip on their shoulder,
the fucking player.
Um,

78
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.330
I can't even,
why the fuck I just made that point?
Oh,

79
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.030
I know why because I've seen so many times.

80
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:07.840
Like it's like you beat them in the regular season and then they see your month

81
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:11.080
or two later and then they come back and beat you.
Jane's did that to us.

82
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.730
The jets did it to us.
We beat them first.
No,
they beat us first.

83
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.140
Then we destroy them at home and then a month later they'd beat us in the

84
00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:25.110
playoffs.
And it's just kinda how it goes.
So,
uh,
am I right with that?
Um,

85
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.790
I'm still not too thrilled with our defense and uh,

86
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.010
can somebody,
by the way,

87
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.860
for the love of fucking guide,

88
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.810
and I don't want to hear this from a fan I needed from a football coach.

89
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.070
Can somebody explain to me the prevent defense?

90
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.190
I know I've asked this before,
but for the love of God,

91
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.400
can somebody please explain to me at the half the Patriot score a touchdown

92
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.220
we're playing with these guys were covering them.
They're not getting any

93
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.160
<v 1>big plays.
We completely abandoned that.</v>

94
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.890
This 59 seconds to go in the half,

95
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.530
we completely fucking abandoned that.

96
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.730
We start playing a zone defense or maybe we playing zone.
Up until then,

97
00:06:11.731 --> 00:06:13.320
I don't know.
Whatever the fuck we were doing was working.

98
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.380
We were in a zone defense,
giving them a 20 yard cushion.

99
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.910
Basically you can see a field goal.

100
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.670
Okay?
And we just,
in 59 seconds,

101
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.690
these fucking guys,
seven plays,

102
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.070
seven 75 yards in 59 fucking seconds

103
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.750
and the last plate for the touchdown watching that wide receiver going from one

104
00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:44.370
zone to the defense to another.
You know what he looked like?

105
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.450
You haven't seen when a fan just runs out on the field and he's just running by

106
00:06:48.451 --> 00:06:51.680
players and they're just looking at them.
You know what I mean?
Cause it's cell.

107
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.610
That's a fan security.
We'll handle that.

108
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.790
This fucking guy because of the prevent defense was standing by himself like a

109
00:07:00.631 --> 00:07:05.430
yard out from the end zone if not on the end zone line waving his fucking arms.

110
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.940
I mean he might as well have been dressed in street clothes.

111
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.880
The level of like nine coverages that is,

112
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:17.030
and I understand the concept behind the prevent defense is basically we'll give,

113
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.270
we'll give up the middle of the field will protect the sideline and they'll make

114
00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:24.150
completions.

115
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.290
We'll tackle them and then they're going to somehow eat up this 59 fucking

116
00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:33.000
seconds.
It never happens.
I swear to God,
I think it's a conspiracy.

117
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.190
It's a business move by the NFL.

118
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.940
It's to increase scoring slash add to the drama.

119
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.540
If another team is only up by one fucking score and the other team goes into a

120
00:07:45.541 --> 00:07:50.130
prevent,
the game is going to end with three or four shots at the end zone,

121
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:55.160
or they're going to kick a field goal to try and win it.
It just,
it,

122
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.090
it just doesn't fucking work.
And you know what's funny?

123
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.930
So we go into the fucking prevent and they go right down the field.

124
00:08:00.931 --> 00:08:05.730
Give us the old right there,
Fred.
Score a fucking touchdown.
All right,

125
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.680
very deflating.
No Pun intended for the patriots as we go into the locker room.

126
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.550
All right,
now we've got to kick off to Seattle.
We kick off to Seattle.

127
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.600
We played defense.
They go three and out.
It's like,

128
00:08:18.601 --> 00:08:21.750
why the fuck didn't we do that before the half?
Sorry.

129
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.620
Half of this is emotionally half as I smoked two cigars two nights in a row,

130
00:08:25.621 --> 00:08:26.580
which I can't fucking do.

131
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.270
I don't understand that on any fucking level.
I also don't understand

132
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.320
when the end of the game,
Seattle's scores a touchdown.

133
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.750
They go up by seven points,
why wouldn't you just kick an extra point,

134
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.250
go up by eight,

135
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.480
you're acting like a two point conversion is a done deal,
which is isn't,

136
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:55.120
which we saw when Seattle went to go for it and didn't get it right.
Am I nuts?

137
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.010
Cause I kind of looked

138
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.750
<v 0>away from the screen.
Um,
they went for two there,
right.</v>

139
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.090
And they didn't get it and then they were only up by one.
Maybe I'm,

140
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.610
maybe I'm wrong here.
I might be wrong if that's what happened.

141
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:08.340
Could somebody explain that move that they went to go up by two,

142
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:11.540
so they'd be up by a touchdown in a field goal rather than just go on,

143
00:09:11.541 --> 00:09:15.570
let's go with the fucking 90 something percent thing and kick a fuck an extra

144
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:16.404
point.

145
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.410
Go up by eight and make the Patriots and they only have to score a touchdown but

146
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:22.050
then convert a fucking two point conversion

147
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:28.050
if that is in fact what happened.
Like I said,
I was on a plane and uh,
you know,

148
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:32.490
there is shit to fucking look around that.
Um,
and also kind of like,

149
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:34.330
what I like to do is I like to a,

150
00:09:34.331 --> 00:09:37.410
I like to listen to like ACDC and shit like that when I'm on a plane.

151
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:41.760
So I listened to like the whole flick of the switch album while I was watching

152
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:44.430
the game.
It's actually pretty fucking cool.
Um,

153
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.110
and also you can actually just sort of watch the game and not getting nearly as

154
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:52.710
emotional,
you know,
because when your team is losing,

155
00:09:52.711 --> 00:09:55.800
you start thinking that the announcers are against your team and vice versa and

156
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:59.990
all that type of shit.
So I,
um,
I dunno,

157
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.680
but I thoroughly enjoyed that game.

158
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:05.190
I'm not one of those fucking fans that fucking his team loses and then thinks,

159
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.090
oh,
we got fucked and blah,
blah,
Blah and all that bullshit.
Okay.
I don't,
uh,

160
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.910
I don't think that it was a fucking great game and I know you guys didn't have

161
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:16.860
Bennet and,
uh,
you know,
and it was great to see two of the most fucking,

162
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.700
uh,
the two biggest cheaters facing off with one another,

163
00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:22.530
one guy who gets all the press,
the other guy does it.

164
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.600
Do you know Seattle since like 2010?
Um,

165
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.740
I think they recently got passed by the Redskins.
They were the most,

166
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:33.330
they had the most,
um,
people busted for taking roids.

167
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.440
You'd never know that they're in Seattle,
man.
They made coffee.

168
00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:38.490
Nobody gives a fuck.

169
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.880
You do that where there's a little bit of foliage and all of a sudden it's a

170
00:10:41.881 --> 00:10:46.790
fucking national story for fucking year and a half,
cause you'll let her cuts.

171
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.040
Here is what?
The air out of a fucking ball.
It's hilarious.
It's amazing to me.

172
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.290
Anyways,
so let's plow ahead here.
A,
uh,

173
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.770
I also got to do one of my favorite charitable events,
um,

174
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.770
other than the Patrice O'Neal company benefit.
Um,
tickets are on sale.

175
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.350
They are on sale.
They will tweet out the link again today.

176
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:08.340
It's going to be at the New York City Theater,
I believe February 21st.

177
00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:10.410
They think it's a Tuesday bell.

178
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:13.140
It be Kinda nice if he had the actual fucking information,
wouldn't it?

179
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.210
Clicking on the camera.
Camera coupling on the calendar.
All right,

180
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.920
going in.
It's,
yes.
February 24 is Bam.
Um,

181
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.330
I got to do the,
uh,
the comics come home event and,
uh,

182
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.400
this is a really special event for me because I got to do,
I did it 20 years ago.

183
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.630
It was the first time they did it and think it was at the Orpheum and I got to

184
00:11:36.631 --> 00:11:39.900
meet Cam Neely.
Chris Neyland was there.

185
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.890
I got to meet Dennis leary and I mean,

186
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.780
I was literally three and a half years into my career.
And,
um,

187
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.890
it was such an unbelievable event to be a part of.

188
00:11:49.891 --> 00:11:52.620
And I went out and thank God I had a good set.

189
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.870
And I remember Larry called me and left a message.

190
00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:58.630
I was so bummed I wasn't home when he called me.
This is like 20 years ago.

191
00:11:58.631 --> 00:12:01.850
So I didn't have a cell phone,
had an answer machine.
And I,
you know,
I,

192
00:12:01.851 --> 00:12:04.330
I actually remember listening to the message like over and over again,

193
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.350
and he was like,
uh,
a bill.
It's a Dennis.
Uh,
I just wanna say thank you.
Uh,

194
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.700
you really fucking funny and,
uh,
you fucking killed.
This is,
thank you for,
uh,

195
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.440
for doing it right.
I fuck up.

196
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.340
And he just hung up and I listened to it like fucking 20 times in a row was so

197
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:22.960
fucking cool.
And um,
and I was also in a panic like,

198
00:12:22.961 --> 00:12:26.380
oh fuck,
I didn't pick up the phone when he called.
Was that my big break?

199
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:31.180
We would have talked to it.
It became friends.
He would open all the doors for me.

200
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:32.014
You know,
that those,

201
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.710
those over the top panic moments that you have when you're trying to make it in

202
00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:38.740
this business that you think you every,
every little thing you think you blew it.

203
00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:43.270
Um,
and you actually,
what you ended up realizing is this,
this is not one thing.

204
00:12:43.271 --> 00:12:47.710
It's a series of things all just building this fucking snowball that rolls down

205
00:12:47.711 --> 00:12:51.520
the hill before you finally get there.
Um,
so anyway,
so I got to do it.

206
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:57.580
And a,
it was Jay last and it was his first one.
He did great.
Wendy Liebman,

207
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.740
uh,
Lenny clock with his fucking lime green pants.
Uh,

208
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.820
probably gonna forget some people,
Wanda Sykes.
Nick Depaulo than me,

209
00:13:06.821 --> 00:13:08.650
than Bobby Kelly.
And,
uh,

210
00:13:08.651 --> 00:13:12.290
that was cool cause me and Bobby will close in and out and he's part of my stand

211
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:17.060
up graduation class.
And I remember when we both first got to do what we would,

212
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:20.230
we were in the Jay Larson spot,
the first guy out,
the new guy,

213
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:25.530
which is really hard because nobody knows who you are enough and you got to go

214
00:13:25.541 --> 00:13:26.680
up.
And that was just the Orpheum.

215
00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:30.340
And Larson went up at the fucking TD banknorth garden where the Bruins and

216
00:13:30.341 --> 00:13:33.640
Celtics play and he fucking killed,
look,
totally relaxed.

217
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:34.840
And I remember watching him going like,

218
00:13:34.841 --> 00:13:38.050
I wasn't that relaxed the first time I did it and was just in a,
in a theater.

219
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.460
And,
um,
you know,
it was cool.
I had some friends in there too though.

220
00:13:42.461 --> 00:13:46.060
That was their first a comedy show they'd ever been to when,
let me,

221
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:50.410
let's just say they saw the gamut of everything that can possibly happen when

222
00:13:50.411 --> 00:13:53.710
you go onstage.
Man,
it was a fucking a,
it was a fun night.

223
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.630
It was a fun fucking night.
And uh,

224
00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.350
you know,
and then afterwards everybody hung out.
And,
uh,

225
00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.790
and I had these cigars that I brought and I was going,

226
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.010
I was saying to the people and say,
hey man,

227
00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:10.780
we was there any place we can smoke these.

228
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.080
And one of the guys connected with the Bruins is like,
okay,
this is a room,

229
00:14:14.081 --> 00:14:17.080
we can go to Sweden.
I'm going to this like halfass locker room.

230
00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.360
It wasn't a visitor locker room.
I don't know what the fuck it was.

231
00:14:19.361 --> 00:14:22.390
And we went in there and we just let these things up and just told stories for

232
00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:23.710
like fucking two hours.

233
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.910
The entire reason I love smoking cigars and we were in there so long,

234
00:14:27.911 --> 00:14:31.540
by the time we got out,
like,
uh,

235
00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.900
they had broken down the stage and everything and they were setting it up,

236
00:14:34.901 --> 00:14:37.870
I think for a Bruins game.
I couldn't tell if it was gonna be Bruins,
Celtics,

237
00:14:37.871 --> 00:14:41.260
so sort of midway and just watching the bull gang or whatever they could,

238
00:14:41.261 --> 00:14:45.070
they're called.
Just setting it up was so fucking cool.
Our,
uh,

239
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:46.900
our little Uber fucking,

240
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:51.620
our little car service back to the hotel had left and we were like,
yeah,
fuck it.

241
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:54.890
We were staying at the liberty so we just fucking walked around the corner and

242
00:14:54.891 --> 00:14:55.720
uh,

243
00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.870
it was fucking hilarious just walking down the streets of Boston if fucking two

244
00:14:59.871 --> 00:15:04.190
in the morning on a Saturday night and every these fucking people hammered

245
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.200
almost a fight,
hear people screaming and yelling and shit.
And it's just like,

246
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.000
I dunno.
It's like God,

247
00:15:11.001 --> 00:15:16.001
I remember this shit fucking the energy of Boston.

248
00:15:16.341 --> 00:15:20.660
It's just,
it's so fucking unique.
It's really just like a,
I,

249
00:15:20.661 --> 00:15:24.020
it took me a long time to pick up on it cause I was just in it.

250
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.883
You know what I mean?

251
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.130
It's kind of like if you car stinks when they see the commercial where they say

252
00:15:28.131 --> 00:15:31.520
you go nose blind,
you don't see it.
I kind of was like,
I dunno,

253
00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.960
I couldn't see how fucking nuts Boston is.
But I've said it before.

254
00:15:35.961 --> 00:15:40.340
Boston is like the sucker punch like capitol of the fucking world.

255
00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:41.540
Like when you go into a Var,

256
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.720
you just add at past a certain hour is this anger that settles it in the bar and

257
00:15:47.291 --> 00:15:50.490
you just feel it.
Somebody getting fucking,
something's going to happen.
Right.

258
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.620
You always hear that dog hair about ob,
a dod guide,

259
00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:58.280
fucking sack it in a bar last night.
Um,

260
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.420
some kids soccer dummy,
he was wearing a fucking clattering kit.

261
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.830
I'm not saying it's all like that,
but there's just this,

262
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.900
that at two in the morning that vibe exist.
I mean,

263
00:16:09.901 --> 00:16:12.410
what time walking back from the Wilbur theater,

264
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.040
I can't remember where the fuck I was standing.
I was walking with two rows.

265
00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:17.530
I was like,
man,
I man,
I just want to walk,
you know,

266
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.300
just walked the city a little bit,
man.
I miss it.
And all the memories,
you know,

267
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.020
back in the day going to Emerson College and commuting and taking the train in

268
00:16:24.021 --> 00:16:27.850
to go to fucking Bruins,
Celtics red sox games and shit.
And uh,

269
00:16:27.851 --> 00:16:31.280
I was walking and like there was two of the angriest fucking kids I've ever seen

270
00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:31.650
him and length.

271
00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:35.450
It was like these homeless people laying over the subway greets and they will

272
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:39.740
fucking walking by.
And they were,
they were just screaming,
wake up,

273
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.390
get a fucking job.
Like re they were like so angry.

274
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.340
They were like 30 yards in front of me.

275
00:16:46.341 --> 00:16:48.740
And I was continuing to slow down cause I was like,

276
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:53.090
if I'm even anywhere near this guy's orbit,
he's going to want to fight me.

277
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.130
He was like that level of angry.

278
00:16:55.730 --> 00:17:00.260
And of course it's got his girlfriend who's trying to calm him down.
Oh my God,

279
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:04.630
stop it.
Just,
just go to the car.
What are you doing?

280
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.490
He's fucking screaming and he's all fucking angry.

281
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.790
She's trying to fucking hold him and he's pulling away and shit.

282
00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:15.290
So of course eventually he fucking sits down and he's just mean muggin everybody

283
00:17:15.291 --> 00:17:19.760
come and buy and you know,
I remember he yelled at me and Derosa I'm just like,

284
00:17:19.761 --> 00:17:21.270
just keep walking.
Just keep walking.

285
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.400
I don't know what it is.
I don't know if it's in the water.

286
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:32.270
I don't know what that is.
But we felt that vibe and uh,

287
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.380
and it was funny.
So we were actually walking back was me,

288
00:17:36.381 --> 00:17:41.381
Bobby and a couple of his buddies and I'm connected with the show,

289
00:17:41.451 --> 00:17:45.790
right?
And we fucking walking back and uh,
we did that thing,
you know,

290
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.470
it said don't walk.
And we were kind of standing in the street a little bit.

291
00:17:48.471 --> 00:17:51.570
And these kids come around the corner in this car,

292
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:53.910
the kid and the jam packed with kids.
You know,

293
00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:57.660
like everybody fucking piled in this kids fuck it in the back seat.

294
00:17:57.661 --> 00:18:02.580
He's got this awful fucking mustache.
It comes,
if you drive by,
he's like,

295
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:06.030
hey,
you're standing in this straight as he went by

296
00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:11.610
and I could tell me Bobby hadn't lived there in a long time and I just looked at

297
00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:15.090
Bobby and I was just like,
you know,
we were standing in the street and he's like,

298
00:18:15.091 --> 00:18:20.040
yeah,
he was right
now back in the day,

299
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.400
that would have been,
fuck you,
you fucking mustachioed whatever.

300
00:18:23.401 --> 00:18:26.580
And then they would have pulled over and the,
you want to go,
oh,

301
00:18:26.581 --> 00:18:29.490
you were fucking go.
And everybody's taking their gold chains off.

302
00:18:29.491 --> 00:18:31.920
That was the eighties,
the eighties when he had gold chains.

303
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:35.610
And right before the fight,
everybody is like taking that gold shade off it,

304
00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.930
handed it to your girlfriend,

305
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:45.370
keep your ranks are,
take the chains off,
dude.
Um,

306
00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.690
yeah,
so it was always great to be back there.
And,
uh,
I didn't get to,

307
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.070
I came up to us so quickly,

308
00:18:51.071 --> 00:18:53.290
I didn't get a chance to go to some of the old food haunts,

309
00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.920
but my mother made some beef stew before I left,
so that was great.

310
00:18:56.921 --> 00:18:58.680
A hung around for like a day,
like an asshole.

311
00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.180
I hung around til like six at night thinking I didn't look that up.

312
00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:04.390
The Patriots game was a,
was an afternoon game,
but I got,
like I said,

313
00:19:04.391 --> 00:19:08.140
I got to watch it on the,
uh,
on the um,

314
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:09.660
<v 3>okay.</v>

315
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:14.380
<v 0>On the fucking,
uh,
on the plane,
on the airplane there.
Um,</v>

316
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.690
so anyways.
All right,
let's get into,
let's read a little bit of advertising here.

317
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.310
Um,
I have not watched the fucking Formula One race yet.

318
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.030
I know Lewis Hamilton won and he's closing the gap.
So you,

319
00:19:27.031 --> 00:19:29.850
people who have not watched fucking Formula One all year.

320
00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:32.820
I think the last one's in Abu Dhabi or some shit or Dubai.

321
00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:34.860
I don't know where the fuck it is.
All right.

322
00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:40.610
But this one is going to determine the fucking window.

323
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:45.390
I think Nico,
all he's gotta do is just come in third place.

324
00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.740
If he just does that,
he's going to win it.
And uh,

325
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.900
Louis obviously needs to win the fucking race,

326
00:19:51.901 --> 00:19:55.830
but it's kind of cool that it's coming down to the last one.
Um,
anyways,

327
00:19:55.831 --> 00:20:00.150
let me get to the fucking advertising.
I have to hug my pipe,

328
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.570
my password,
or else I won't be able to talk and fucking,

329
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:08.640
there we go.
All right,
here we go.
All right.
Oh,

332
00:20:14.101 --> 00:20:18.180

336
00:20:31.051 --> 00:20:35.520
flavors,
coconut,
Vanilla,

That's,
that's my DNA makeup.

337
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:36.750
Tell you this.
Every week.

338
00:20:36.751 --> 00:20:40.510
Oh my coconut hit my vanilla scanning my strawberry pubes.

339
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.320
I'm also fight MCT oil like a mix.

340
00:20:44.321 --> 00:20:48.100
It's like a cream easily in your morning coffee without the need for

get a chance to fucking race was in Brazil.
I got a tape at home.

414
00:25:22.761 --> 00:25:25.460
I can't wait to see it cause it was raining.
And uh,

415
00:25:25.461 --> 00:25:28.820
that's one of the coolest things I find about a formula one racing is that it's

416
00:25:28.821 --> 00:25:32.000
like football.
They don't give a shit,
you know,
if it's raining or not,

417
00:25:32.001 --> 00:25:35.280
they're going to keep,
they're going to keep racing.
And uh,
I think that's cool.

418
00:25:35.281 --> 00:25:39.860
Then adds all this extra elements to the race.
And um,
you know,

419
00:25:39.861 --> 00:25:40.671
it's like when two teams,

420
00:25:40.671 --> 00:25:43.580
like my team's favored by 14 and all of a sudden it starts fucking rain and I

421
00:25:43.581 --> 00:25:44.450
don't,
everybody starts to slip,

422
00:25:44.451 --> 00:25:46.580
sliding around and you've got yourself a good game.

423
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.150
I thought that this was going to be a landslide one way or the other.

424
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.470
Like Hillary Clinton.
I still can't believe Donald Trump won.

425
00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.690
I still cannot fucking believe that.
Um,

426
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:05.060
he reality show TV star gun fucking elected.

427
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.770
Oh Geez.
Um,

428
00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:14.450
two of the worst fucking candidates ever to fucking face each others in my uncle

429
00:26:14.631 --> 00:26:16.280
fucking opinion.
Boy.
What the fuck do I know?

430
00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:20.270
Every dentally I know a lot considering a lot of the fucking emails I got and

431
00:26:20.271 --> 00:26:25.070
all this shit on Twitter.
I got a lot of shit from my parents on a Conant,

432
00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.610
which I gotta be honest with you guys,
was not a fucking easy one to do.

433
00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:32.060
It was the day after the election.
Everyone was in shock,

434
00:26:32.061 --> 00:26:35.690
I think including Trump supporters because I went back east and I talked to a

435
00:26:35.691 --> 00:26:37.970
couple friends of mine and they voted for Trump.
And I was like,
dude,

436
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:39.440
I can't believe that guy wanted,
and they were like,
yeah,

437
00:26:39.441 --> 00:26:43.440
I can't fucking believe it either.
So I don't know.

438
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.380
Maybe this is like when the Patriots beat the rams,
I have no fucking idea.

439
00:26:46.381 --> 00:26:50.230
But anyways,
that was not an easy,
uh,

440
00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:55.000
an easy spot to be in.
You know,
and I stayed true to who I was.

441
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:57.940
And uninformed jackass who can't fucking read out loud,

442
00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.650
who's in the conspiracy theory.

443
00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:04.120
I talked about Hillary dressing up like a Yak and fucking people under a

444
00:27:04.121 --> 00:27:04.954
mountain.

445
00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:10.270
I talked about Trump being a dope and that whole ridiculous shit about building

446
00:27:10.271 --> 00:27:14.560
a fucking wall.
I trashed.
And both equally,
but you know,

447
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:18.520
people who vote for colors,
right?
You got a blue tie,

448
00:27:18.521 --> 00:27:22.480
you can say nothing wrong.
You got a red tie.
You can't do anything wrong.
Right?

449
00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:27.220
I got so much fucking shit.
It's so amazing how people Paul here things.

450
00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.120
I actually,
my point in all of that was like,
you know,

451
00:27:31.121 --> 00:27:34.660
it'd be kind of cool if we all just stop yelling at each other.
All right.

452
00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.410
All right.
If you guys,
if,
if you want to hear my fucking theories,

453
00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:41.470
this is my theory.
Okay.

454
00:27:41.471 --> 00:27:46.471
I think Trump got in because of eight years of Obama and the progressive left.

455
00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:51.010
And I think they got in because of eight years of George Bush and I think,

456
00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:54.790
and Bush and Cheney.
And I think they got in because of eight years of Clinton.

457
00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:57.850
And I think Clinton got in because of 12 years of Reagan and Bush.

458
00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:00.610
It just,
it just keeps,

459
00:28:00.611 --> 00:28:05.611
it goes like way conservative and then it goes way fucking liberal and then it

460
00:28:05.651 --> 00:28:10.180
goes way conservative.
You know what I mean?
I mean,
think about where America was,

461
00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:13.540
right?
Where when Bush and Cheney were there,

462
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:15.280
all right.

463
00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:20.280
And then six years later or so during Obama's presidency,

464
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:25.020
like Bruce Jenner transitioned,

465
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.870
got her own show.
It was named woman of the year.
Okay.

466
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:35.760
Now that is not something that you would think could happen in oh seven six

467
00:28:35.761 --> 00:28:39.970
years later bump.
That's where the Fuck Zach and I dunno.
And what I,
the,

468
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:45.200
my problem with both sides is the way they ran their ideology down your fucking

469
00:28:45.611 --> 00:28:46.444
throat.

470
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:50.890
And that if you have a difference of an opinion,

471
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:55.570
you know,
on the right,
it's usually,
it means you're against America.

472
00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.610
You don't support the troops and a,
you're a socialist.

473
00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:05.620
And on the left,
if you don't agree with them,
you're a cave man.

474
00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.710
You're a fucking sexist.
You're a racist,

475
00:29:08.711 --> 00:29:11.710
you're a homophobia or any of those fucking things.
Um,

476
00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:17.080
but both sides equally try to get you to lose your job and they try to destroy

477
00:29:17.721 --> 00:29:22.721
your ability to earn a living because of your beliefs and full of life of me.

478
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.290
As confusing as the prevent defense is.

479
00:29:27.291 --> 00:29:32.291
Can somebody please explain to me how if somebody says something politically or

480
00:29:32.661 --> 00:29:35.900
socially that you don't agree with,
um,

481
00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:40.370
spawning a movement to get them to lose their fucking job.

482
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.010
How that that person,

483
00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:47.170
<v 0>I'm more supportive of the troops.
America,</v>

484
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.190
less of a socialist,

485
00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:52.450
whatever the fuck it is you think they are or how that makes them less racist,

486
00:29:52.451 --> 00:29:52.900
less time.

487
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:57.840
<v 1>Biphobic like,
um,
I dunno,</v>

488
00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:01.740
I,
I,
that doesn't work.
Yelling at people,
taking away their jobs.

489
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:02.881
You know what I mean?

490
00:30:02.881 --> 00:30:07.830
It's like a way back when the Dixie chicks criticized George Bush the fucking

491
00:30:07.831 --> 00:30:08.101
right.

492
00:30:08.101 --> 00:30:13.080
All of a sudden that there they pressured radio stations to not play their

493
00:30:13.081 --> 00:30:13.831
music.
They will,

494
00:30:13.831 --> 00:30:18.831
they will fucking running over this cds with steam rollers and you know,

495
00:30:19.711 --> 00:30:22.140
people like to,
what the fuck you going a little far?
It's like,
no,

496
00:30:22.141 --> 00:30:25.380
they had a right to say that and we had a right to respond.
It's tit for tat.

497
00:30:25.381 --> 00:30:28.980
It's like,
that's not tit for tat.
You know,

498
00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:32.700
tit for tat is they trashed George Bush.
You defend

499
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.510
<v 0>George Bush and you trashed them.</v>

500
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:38.920
Trying to systematically destroy their career and their ability to make a living

501
00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.600
is not tit for tat.

502
00:30:40.601 --> 00:30:44.380
That's like somebody flipped your fucking ear and then you took out of a fucking

503
00:30:44.381 --> 00:30:46.660
knife and cut.
They're trying to cut that juggler.

504
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.350
<v 1>So,
and personally speaking,</v>

505
00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:55.390
I think both sides are,
uh,
are really guilty of that.

506
00:30:55.391 --> 00:30:59.770
They're really guilty when you get really far left and you get really far left

507
00:30:59.771 --> 00:31:02.830
right there.
Really guilty of just a bully people.

508
00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:06.400
And there's so fucking wrapped up in that.

509
00:31:06.401 --> 00:31:11.290
They're so God damn right about everything that they really become condescending

510
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:14.680
in sufferable assholes.
And um,

511
00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:17.870
I dunno.
So I tried to,

512
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.010
I try to stay in the middle cause I would never tell you who the fuck to vote

513
00:31:21.011 --> 00:31:22.630
for,
nor did I ever

514
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:28.490
<v 0>on this thing unlike what most people saw.
Dude,
I got people on fucking Twitter.</v>

515
00:31:28.491 --> 00:31:31.430
It's hilarious.
Like they sit in there,
first of all,

516
00:31:31.431 --> 00:31:34.820
they think they know me cause they watched me on a talk show and then they think

517
00:31:34.821 --> 00:31:39.200
they know how I voted.
Like the amount of people that thought I voted for Trump.

518
00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.630
And then the amount of people that thought I voted for Hillary,

519
00:31:41.631 --> 00:31:45.350
all the Trump people think I voted for fucking Hillary and all the Trump,

520
00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:48.170
all the Hillary people think I voted for Trump.

521
00:31:48.171 --> 00:31:50.690
I didn't vote for either one of them.
I told you guys right along,

522
00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.160
Bernie Sanders was my fucking guy.
That was my fucking guy.

523
00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:02.720
And watching him getting boxed out by the media because they felt Hillary had

524
00:32:03.921 --> 00:32:08.921
more of a chance and they didn't give a shit that they would just voting just

525
00:32:08.991 --> 00:32:10.820
more of the same,
more of the same.

526
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.823
<v 4>MMM.</v>

527
00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.290
<v 0>The only thing I will commend with the right as they got their Bernie Sanders
in,</v>

528
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:19.140
I mean,
the guy's a fucking shit show.

529
00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:20.850
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

530
00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:24.300
<v 0>But at least,
you know,
at least they stuck by their rebel.</v>

531
00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:25.410
I wish that they had done that.

532
00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:28.170
I would've loved to Saint Bernie against fucking Donald Trump.

533
00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.390
I think Bernie would have had a better shot.

534
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.890
I just think the Clintons had too much fucking,
yeah.
Can

535
00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:37.450
<v 1>baggage,
you know,
and even as a Clinton supporter,
you know,</v>

536
00:32:37.451 --> 00:32:38.500
that's fucking true.

537
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.620
How little did Bill Clinton talk during that whole fucking time?

538
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.690
He didn't talk at all.

539
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:49.100
This is a former fucking president who had a successful presidency.
I mean,

540
00:32:49.101 --> 00:32:52.460
even though he got impeached for stickiness and go lion about,
you know,

541
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:56.930
Monica Lewinsky,
he didn't talk like Al Gore lost to George Bush.

542
00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.250
You know,
he didn't use Bill Clinton.
He goes,
I got to get the fuck away from you.

543
00:33:01.251 --> 00:33:05.300
Dude,
you're a fucking nightmare.
You're a fucking nightmare.

544
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.160
You're a political fucking nightmare.

545
00:33:07.161 --> 00:33:11.200
And the dude's on Wayfair had to do the exact same fucking thing.

546
00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.293
<v 4>I Dunno,</v>

547
00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:16.900
<v 1>they had a ton of fucking baggage,
you know,</v>

548
00:33:16.901 --> 00:33:21.130
and Hillary supporters won't fucking look at it objectively at the same way

549
00:33:21.131 --> 00:33:23.200
Trump supporters won't look at that.
I mean,

550
00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.310
<v 4>um,
I dunno.</v>

551
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.180
<v 1>It's just,
it's a fucked up time.
But I will tell you this though,</v>

552
00:33:29.181 --> 00:33:33.860
at the time for screaming and yelling at each other is over.
I feel,

553
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:38.890
and it would be nice is if those people who aren't crazy fucking left and crazy,

554
00:33:40.371 --> 00:33:45.230
right,
could kind of maybe a break bread a little bit,
um,

555
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:47.930
which I don't think it's going to happen because,
um,

556
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:52.070
of eight years of Obama in eight years of progressive,

557
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:56.930
the progressive left becoming word police and,
uh,

558
00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:58.790
and,
and,
um,

559
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:06.030
I get social police and an idea police and all of this stuff telling you what

560
00:34:06.031 --> 00:34:10.950
the fuck you supposed to think about everything and what you're supposed to say

561
00:34:10.951 --> 00:34:14.310
and what were you supposed to use.
And I really think it's overly simplifying,

562
00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:19.700
saying that the right voted the way they did because they want to say homophobic

563
00:34:20.131 --> 00:34:24.570
in racial slurs.
Just turning people into it.
That's his,
like both of them,

564
00:34:24.571 --> 00:34:27.000
they always turn each other and do like a cartoon.
Like he ever even noticed.

565
00:34:27.001 --> 00:34:29.520
Like whenever like a Democrat gets in the right,

566
00:34:29.521 --> 00:34:32.310
totally overreacts and like it's going to be socialism.

567
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:34.970
It's going to be like cognitives Russia,

568
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.660
there's going to be terrorist running down the fucking street,
you know?

569
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:45.630
And then whenever anybody in the right [inaudible],
it's always like,

570
00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:50.900
this is like Germany in 1935 every fucking time they say that every fucking

571
00:34:53.911 --> 00:34:57.690
time.
I'm not saying that one of those times it won't be fucking true,

572
00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:02.810
but they say it every fucking time and they completely freak the fuck out.

573
00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:06.540
And um,
I dunno.
And then when they get in,

574
00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:09.090
they ran their ideologies down the other person's throat.

575
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:14.320
They have zero empathy for somebody else.
They have zero empathy for how,
uh,

576
00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:18.870
people want to raise their kids and they just,
both sides.
They just like,

577
00:35:18.871 --> 00:35:22.950
we're 100% right and now you're going to fucking take this write down the throat

578
00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.710
and a,
I dunno,
the,
each election,

579
00:35:25.711 --> 00:35:29.040
I think the pendulum keeps swinging farther and farther,

580
00:35:29.041 --> 00:35:30.750
but even if you're not fucking Democrat,

581
00:35:30.751 --> 00:35:34.200
you get calf to be proud of the last eight fucking years.
I mean,

582
00:35:34.201 --> 00:35:38.640
at least there was no cigars and pussies.
There was no,
uh,

583
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:42.480
they have weapons of mass destruction.
Oops,
we can't find any.
Oh,

584
00:35:42.481 --> 00:35:46.260
now it's a liberation.
There was none of that shit.
Right?

585
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:51.900
Who knows who the fuck.
I don't know what's going to happen,
but uh,
you know,

586
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.450
I'm not comfortable with this result than anybody else.

587
00:35:54.451 --> 00:35:59.340
But you wouldn't know that from all these fucking things.
These emails,

588
00:35:59.341 --> 00:36:00.151
these,
I'll read you two.

589
00:36:00.151 --> 00:36:03.810
I'll try and get through these next two emails that I got.
This is classic

590
00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:10.080
like political shit.
How people like,
they just hear what they want to hear,
right?

591
00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:15.380
So this guy writes me and this guy is basically I think a blaming me in a round

592
00:36:16.651 --> 00:36:20.710
about way for Donald Trump getting in because God knows that's the kind of power

593
00:36:20.711 --> 00:36:22.620
of the Monday morning podcast has,
you know,

594
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:27.420
a couple of hundred thousand downloads.
I mean that's it dude.
That's it.

595
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:32.160
I can't believe I don't have secret service security right outside my door as I

596
00:36:32.161 --> 00:36:32.994
do this.

597
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.230
I'm literally a podcast where I talk about fucking sports.

598
00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.830
90% of the time I talk about conspiracy theory.
I say I'm an idiot.

599
00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:43.770
I can't read out loud.
You know,

600
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.560
this guy for some reason is choosing to ignore all of this.

601
00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:49.950
I'm going to say because the person he wanted it didn't get in.
So here we go.

602
00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.890
Dear freckles,
I'm no rocket scientist.
All right.

603
00:36:52.891 --> 00:36:56.660
Immediately going self deprecating.
Neither are you okay.
Agreed.

604
00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.380
And I think it's assumed it's safe to assume the large majority of your

605
00:37:01.381 --> 00:37:05.520
listeners aren't either.
Um,
unlike you.

606
00:37:05.521 --> 00:37:09.750
I would never speak for them.
I don't know.
I don't know who they are.
Okay.

607
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.250
But you know,
if you want to assume that to continue on with your point,

608
00:37:14.251 --> 00:37:16.740
I'll go along with it.
Most are like me,

609
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:20.670
average middle of this person has not done one fucking ounce of research for

610
00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:22.950
this.
But this is,
this is,
this is how we build points.

611
00:37:22.951 --> 00:37:25.350
This is how I build a point.
Most are like me,

612
00:37:25.351 --> 00:37:30.270
average middle class folk who laugh like a laugh twice a week from our favorite

613
00:37:30.271 --> 00:37:35.160
comedian.
See this,
this is laying the groundwork.
I feel an overhand right coming.

614
00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:39.930
Um,
you have swayed my opinion on several things over the years.
Old Jesus,

615
00:37:39.931 --> 00:37:40.920
most notably,

616
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:45.270
I went from a Patriot hater to someone who supports them in,

617
00:37:45.271 --> 00:37:49.590
agrees they are unfairly scrutinized by the league and other teams.

618
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:51.540
Well,
isn't that amazing?

619
00:37:51.541 --> 00:37:55.890
So I guess if I could sway you on the amount of air that should be in a
football,

620
00:37:55.891 --> 00:37:59.430
I could sway you on who you're going to pick for the leader of the free world.

621
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:04.560
Yeah,
I guess that's the same.
You know,
I,
I I get totally see that point.

622
00:38:04.561 --> 00:38:08.250
I don't think there's any sort of giant body of water that you're leaping over

623
00:38:08.251 --> 00:38:11.010
there.
I don't know.
Okay,
here we go.
When I realized,

624
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.550
when I realized how much your opinions influenced me,

625
00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:19.890
I realized how much they might influence others.
Okay,

626
00:38:19.891 --> 00:38:23.130
here's,
here's the big failure here buddy.
Okay?

627
00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:26.550
You didn't agree with me on the Patriots.
I brought you around.

628
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.720
You didn't agree with me with my,

629
00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:34.020
my political opinion on Hillary Clinton.
You didn't change.

630
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.190
You know,

631
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:39.690
I think that I can bring your fucking opinion around about using those savy

632
00:38:39.691 --> 00:38:43.240
saved.
Fuck you fuck cards and your everyday bullshit life.

633
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:47.830
But when I think it comes down to electing the leader of the free world,

634
00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.630
I think you go a little bit beyond the Monday morning podcast

635
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:56.860
or the Thursday afternoon just before Friday.

636
00:38:56.861 --> 00:38:58.780
Monday morning podcast where I scream,

637
00:38:58.781 --> 00:39:02.440
I'm just checking in on you like a fucking idiot for half a minute.

638
00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:08.470
All right,
so here we hear he goes with his Z.
He's laid.
See,
he came out.

639
00:39:08.471 --> 00:39:13.090
I'm no rocket scientist.
Self deprecating.
Okay,
Danny.
He goes,

640
00:39:13.091 --> 00:39:14.740
uh hey.
Now he just goes,
well,

641
00:39:14.741 --> 00:39:19.120
I'm going to assume that this is what your listeners are without doing any sort

642
00:39:19.121 --> 00:39:21.130
of research.
And then I'm going to go,
Oh,

643
00:39:21.131 --> 00:39:25.510
you swayed me on this fucking basic bullshit horse shit.

644
00:39:25.511 --> 00:39:26.950
That means actually literally nothing.

645
00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:30.040
Therefore you could sway me on something that means you know,

646
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:32.800
Jesus Christ.
Dude,

647
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.380
you walked through the mall and there's somebody sitting there going,
hey buddy,

648
00:39:35.381 --> 00:39:38.580
can I talk to you for a second?
This is a self fair.
Look at this.

649
00:39:38.581 --> 00:39:40.240
You can spray some spritzer in and blah,
blah blah,

650
00:39:40.241 --> 00:39:44.640
and all of a sudden you buy some little impulse buy thing then then with your

651
00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:44.981
theory,

652
00:39:44.981 --> 00:39:48.490
that guy could also get you to vote for who the fuck he wants you to vote for.

653
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:53.320
Anyways,
continuing on,
when I realized how much your opinion influenced me,

654
00:39:53.321 --> 00:39:57.520
I realized how much they might influence others and how these influences might

655
00:39:57.521 --> 00:40:01.090
have much larger inc implications than the NFL.

656
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:06.230
Call me crazy.
But it seems like you're going into paranoia now.
Um,

657
00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:10.120
after your polls said that you're a person was going to win and now you're

658
00:40:10.121 --> 00:40:14.110
sitting there with your jaw on the ground and now you're looking for a scapegoat

659
00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:18.220
in the air.
I am a 48 year old bald,

660
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:22.900
pasty fucking redhead.
There's an easy target.
Let's go after him.
I love it buddy.

661
00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:26.290
But still it fucking tar and feather me.
Here we go.

662
00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:31.300
You have consistently and foolishly bass bashed Hillary so much more.

663
00:40:31.301 --> 00:40:36.280
So much more than you have Trump.
Hilarious,
right?
So much more than Trump.

664
00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.000
I have an entire chunk of material.
Uh,

665
00:40:38.001 --> 00:40:42.490
Donald Trump and Trump was so fucking easy.
I felt guilty when I was on stage.

666
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:46.000
I did it when I was on Conan about building the fucking wall.

667
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:50.410
How ridiculous and idea that is,
how much money that was going to be.

668
00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:53.800
I did all of that.
I always called them a dope.

669
00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.430
I always called him a reality TV show.

670
00:40:57.431 --> 00:41:02.200
Star didn't even remotely respect him as a businessman.
I said,

671
00:41:02.201 --> 00:41:04.390
I didn't believe that he was a billionaire.
I said,

672
00:41:04.391 --> 00:41:07.960
I don't think that he could get you six grand in cash if he gave him six or

673
00:41:07.961 --> 00:41:11.290
seven weeks.
I thought he was completely leveraged out.

674
00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:17.410
I made fun of his hair.
I made fun out.
We didn't say anything to anybody.

675
00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:21.460
He never said anything.
It was the most fascinating thing I've ever seen.

676
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:25.330
He would go like,
fucking a,
I'm gonna do this.
I'm going to do,

677
00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.840
and some would be like,
how are you going to do that?
And He'd be like,
Oh,

678
00:41:28.841 --> 00:41:31.180
you'll see.
You'll see.

679
00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.280
I was doing a bit in my echo and want to use that with my wife.

680
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:38.420
Just make all these outrageous claims about what a great husband I'm going to
be.

681
00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.170
And then when she gives me shit I,
well,

682
00:41:40.171 --> 00:41:43.340
what are you going to do to improve yourself?
I'll,
you'll say,
you'll say,
no,

683
00:41:43.341 --> 00:41:45.860
you need to tell me,
well,
I'm not going to give away my strategies,

684
00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:50.730
then you'll steal them.
I did all of that.
Right.

685
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:53.840
And then Hillary,
I said that she was part of the Bilderberg group.

686
00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.990
I talked about the Hillary Foundation and how they fucking been living off of

687
00:41:56.991 --> 00:41:59.930
that shit.
They threw a $3 million wedding for their daughter.

688
00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.920
All of that type of Shit,
all over fucking felony charges and everything,

689
00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:06.590
which of course,
all Hillary supporters are like,
those were unfounded.

690
00:42:06.591 --> 00:42:09.560
They were not proven yet with fucking Donald Trump.

691
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:12.230
Six or seven people say that he sexually assaulted them,

692
00:42:12.231 --> 00:42:17.231
which I fucking believe I believe that to that girl when she went get real,

693
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:20.450
which I also said on the podcast,
and I was like,
dude,

694
00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:24.080
he definitely did that shit.
You didn't hear all any of this shit,
did you sir?

695
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:25.790
You know why?
Because,

696
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:30.170
because you got fucking blue tie stuck in your fucking ears.

697
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:36.200
All right,
let's go.
Continuing to blame me.
All right.
Um,
I evidently,

698
00:42:36.201 --> 00:42:39.650
it's so much more.
I trashed Hillary,
uh,
the entire election.

699
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:44.780
You have unfairly focused hate on her and at the end of your tirade,
you tack on,

700
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:46.820
Oh,
and he's a cunt to,
uh,

701
00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.750
you don't seem to realize the influence you have on people who listened to you

702
00:42:50.751 --> 00:42:55.580
twice a week,
every week.
Sir.
You've done nothing to prove that I have influence.

703
00:42:57.610 --> 00:42:58.060
This is,

704
00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:02.260
this is all something that you built in your head when you are hyperventilating

705
00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:06.370
that this fucking monster got into the office,
all right?

706
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:11.170
And Hillary's a month's to two.
Okay?

707
00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.870
And that right there was my all when she's a cunt too.

708
00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.550
I didn't like either one of these people.

709
00:43:15.551 --> 00:43:18.190
And that was my message throughout all of this.
Okay?

710
00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:22.630
And that's just my fucking opinion.
What's I'm allowed to have our night.

711
00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:25.690
Alright?
You most likely,

712
00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:30.130
you most likely influenced at least one voter to vote for Donald Trump.

713
00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:32.460
And for that you should be fucking ashamed,
dude.

714
00:43:32.461 --> 00:43:36.970
This is all fucking conspiracy theory
because you chose,

715
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.830
you got somebody to cast one vote for the person that I didn't vote for.

716
00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:46.920
You should be fucking ashamed because I only see the faults of the guy with the

717
00:43:47.531 --> 00:43:51.730
red tie and I don't see any faults with the person with the Blue Blouse.

718
00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:57.040
All right,
you are a,
you are so stupid.
Here we go.

719
00:43:57.041 --> 00:44:00.460
This is all great to get somebody,
somebody to listen to your opinion.

720
00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:04.960
Usually what she should do.
You usually should end with the insult.

721
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:06.430
Say your point,

722
00:44:06.431 --> 00:44:10.030
and then you tag on your fucking ass hole because then they'll at least hear

723
00:44:10.031 --> 00:44:14.260
your point.
But if you start to see if you've front end load,
all right,

724
00:44:14.261 --> 00:44:18.820
you are so stupid that in one sentence you go from saying how they never talk

725
00:44:18.821 --> 00:44:22.300
about this issue or that issue.
Then conclude by saying,

726
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:26.530
but I haven't watched any of the debates are kept up on this at all.

727
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:31.650
You fucking idiot.
Yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.

728
00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:36.180
You don't think that Trump supporters didn't say the same thing they did buddy.

729
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:39.810
Cause I got,
I have the exact same fucking email from the other side.

730
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:41.563
All right.

731
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:46.530
Which with my theory that I'll now use that also has no research behind it.

732
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.530
I would say that you guys all sort of canceled each other out.

733
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:53.580
So whatever influence I had,
I influenced somebody the other way too.

734
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:58.080
So I am completely exonerated here.
And if you look at the popular vote,

735
00:44:58.081 --> 00:45:03.010
it was almost right down the fucking middle.
So there you go.
So you,

736
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:05.600
he calls me a fucking idiot.
All right?
Uh,

737
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:10.170
they never talk about climate change is something you've said on Monday.
Uh,

738
00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:14.130
the day before the election,
you have no clue what you're talking about.
Well,

739
00:45:14.131 --> 00:45:18.360
first of all,
I said they never do.
I didn't say that one or the other.

740
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:21.050
So that was an evenhanded one,
right?
She goes,
clunk.

741
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:25.260
Clinton has made it a major point and supports the Paris agreement.
Uh,

742
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:29.400
nothing I ever saw.
She made it a major point.
She's commented on it.

743
00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:32.940
It goes to the Paris agreement.
Not that you even know what the fuck that is.

744
00:45:32.941 --> 00:45:37.560
You freckled fuck.
Of course.
See this guy once again,
making assumptions.

745
00:45:37.561 --> 00:45:40.380
I know what the Paris agreement is.
I've seen it on the daily show.

746
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:42.180
I saw when they all talked about it.

747
00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:45.120
I saw when they went there and the right finally said,

748
00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:48.990
and I actually talked about this on the podcast,
sir.

749
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:54.750
When the rate went there,
then they finally said,
okay.
After denying it,

750
00:45:54.751 --> 00:45:57.180
they finally said,
global warming does exist,

751
00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:01.620
but it's too late to do anything about it now.
All right.

752
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:05.160
I believe I compared that to when Pete rose finally admitted that he been on

753
00:46:05.161 --> 00:46:08.190
baseball and said,
now can you let me in the hall of fame.

754
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:11.490
I distinctly remember saying that,
not that you remember that sir,

755
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:15.360
cause you got your blue bonnets stuffed in your fucking ear.
Right.

756
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:21.030
I also actually looked up weeks ago,

757
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:24.780
like when did people first start talking about climate change?

758
00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:27.450
As I was driving down the street and I was listening and he was saying,

759
00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:29.910
you know I would drove,
drove down the street that morning.

760
00:46:29.911 --> 00:46:34.911
I heard that on NPR they see scientists say the Great Barrier Reef is now dead.

761
00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:40.380
And then they went on to talk about the cubs,
which is course struck me is funny.

762
00:46:40.381 --> 00:46:44.630
Then the whole rest of the report should have been about that or that swirl of

763
00:46:44.631 --> 00:46:46.500
trash and the Pacific Ocean and all that shit,

764
00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:50.160
which none of these guys really talk about.
They do a little bit of lip service,

765
00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:53.970
that's about it.
But they're not going to fucking do anything about it.

766
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:58.350
And even if they tried to,
they can't because he's corporations own them.

767
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:03.870
Which is why I like the fucking
the lunatic guys.

768
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:08.010
I never vote for the fucking main people.
I don't know,
whatever,
what happened,

769
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.330
let's just plow ahead.
So anyways,
yeah,

770
00:47:09.331 --> 00:47:13.680
I actually looked it up and the first time climate change was brought up,

771
00:47:13.681 --> 00:47:16.980
somebody had like a theory,
it was before it was even happening,

772
00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:21.350
was projecting that the population kept growing,
that it was,

773
00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.990
the theory was that we would heat up the planet and he did that in the early 18

774
00:47:24.991 --> 00:47:28.950
hundreds I couldn't believe it.
And then there was a few more things about,

775
00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:30.220
I can't remember,
it was weeks ago,

776
00:47:30.221 --> 00:47:34.330
but like in the late fifties was the first definitive papers saying since the

777
00:47:34.331 --> 00:47:39.331
1950s scientists has been telling people that the pollutions and shit that we've

778
00:47:39.431 --> 00:47:42.280
been putting in the air or whatever.
Like I'm not a scientist.
Okay,

779
00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:44.260
I am just a regular guy,
but I read,

780
00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:48.880
they have known about it or it had the attention called to it since the late

781
00:47:48.881 --> 00:47:53.650
1950 [inaudible] okay.
So I'm not as,
I am a moron,

782
00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:58.680
but I'm not as dumb
as you think I am,
sir.

783
00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:02.520
And one of the reasons why I underplay myself is because I don't want to be

784
00:48:02.521 --> 00:48:06.880
another fucking jerk off
who's just fucking,
you know,

785
00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:10.840
getting in your fucking ear like some people in my business.

786
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:15.010
Okay.
So anyways,
he goes,
uh,

787
00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:19.690
Trump has said repeatedly that climate change is a hoax that was created by the

788
00:48:19.691 --> 00:48:23.680
Chinese.
He said,
he said it repeatedly.
Um,
I'm going to look up the Internet.

789
00:48:23.681 --> 00:48:26.220
See how many times he repeatedly said that.
Um,

790
00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.880
usually when people say repeatedly,

791
00:48:27.881 --> 00:48:32.620
it means it's a quote that somebody said like seven years ago,
uh,
one time.

792
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:37.390
All right.
And yet you blindly,
ignorantly spew your unfounded bullshit.
Dude,

793
00:48:37.391 --> 00:48:39.160
you just define this podcast.

794
00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:45.660
Why are you acting like this is meet the press?
He goes,
I'm not a genius.

795
00:48:45.661 --> 00:48:47.250
I always back to being humble again.

796
00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:51.190
I'm not a genius as you call me a fucking idiot.
All right?

797
00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:55.500
I'm not a political scientist now.
He's doing a humble pie.
He's got his hands up.

798
00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:00.300
But I took just a few hours out of my life to research both of their positions

799
00:49:00.301 --> 00:49:04.410
on crucial issues and get an understanding of them.
Oh yeah.
I never did that.

800
00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.520
I didn't do that at all.

801
00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:11.580
And I'm not the one speaking to thousands of people twice a week.

802
00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:16.170
You should truly be horrified at the thought you had anything to do with this

803
00:49:16.171 --> 00:49:18.460
fucking train wreck.
I love how you would your,

804
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:21.570
do you think that Hillary has any responsibility

805
00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.000
for the campaign that she ran?

806
00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:31.860
I mean from day one her campaign could not use an unbelievable asset,

807
00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.700
which was former president Bill Clinton

808
00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:43.430
because of all of the shit show that that guy was both professionally and in his

809
00:49:44.521 --> 00:49:46.800
personal life.
Her husband,

810
00:49:46.801 --> 00:49:49.770
it was a former president that was wildly popular.

811
00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:54.800
She couldn't even use the guy because of all the fucking skeletons in his

812
00:49:55.111 --> 00:49:59.880
fucking closet,
you know?
And together they both had skeletons.
You know,

813
00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:04.650
it's a very polarizing candidate that should pick.

814
00:50:04.651 --> 00:50:07.830
And I thought in key moments,
you know,

815
00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:11.880
where she really couldn't come up with something clever to say she didn't have

816
00:50:11.881 --> 00:50:16.830
it.
Look sir,
be honest with me.
What really gets you into office,

817
00:50:16.831 --> 00:50:21.330
your policy or playing the saxophone on fucking Arsenio Hall

818
00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:27.010
or not sticking your head out of a tank and looking like a fucking dope or

819
00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:28.350
getting too excited and going.

820
00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:33.350
I mean that's the kind of shit that brings people down more so than anything

821
00:50:33.351 --> 00:50:36.500
else.
And that's not my fault.
If you want to fucking blame me for that,

822
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:39.320
but that is the truth.
So you can actually win an election.

823
00:50:39.321 --> 00:50:43.380
Like he just saw that fucking dope Trump do without saying a fucking thing.
But,

824
00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.250
but being good at trash and somebody fucking shirt,

825
00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:50.720
which is basically how he got in promising a bunch of shit,

826
00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:53.720
not saying what he was going to do and then go look at that guy down there.

827
00:50:53.721 --> 00:50:55.820
He's fucking clueless.
And everybody just laughing.

828
00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:01.570
Hillary didn't have any of that.
She had no fucking swagger.
She just do it.

829
00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:06.240
I remember when she did that hot sauce moment on that fucking radio show and uh,

830
00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:10.370
the host was going,
everybody that was African American and she goes,

831
00:51:10.371 --> 00:51:12.530
what's your favorite?
You know,
once you go to thing,

832
00:51:12.531 --> 00:51:15.110
what do you always carry around with you?
And she said hot sauce,

833
00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:18.200
whichever evidently was true.
Okay.

834
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:21.230
But immediately looked like she was pandering and the guy said,

835
00:51:21.231 --> 00:51:22.550
are you just trying to pander?

836
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:27.200
Sounds to me like you're just trying to pander to black people and rather than

837
00:51:27.201 --> 00:51:30.500
just saying like,
Nah man,
I like it.
I've been blah blah blah blah.
She goes,

838
00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:35.260
isn't working
well that right there,

839
00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:40.180
why the fuck would you say that?
Why would you say it?

840
00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:44.050
And when I saw her say that I immediately as soon as that she's,

841
00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:48.240
she is pandering and then people will go in like,
oh actually it's true.

842
00:51:48.241 --> 00:51:50.860
And then I looked it up and I go,
oh it is fucking true.
But still,

843
00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:52.143
this is the thing,

844
00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:56.200
if I was really in the fucking hot sauce and I was fucking running and I was on

845
00:51:56.201 --> 00:51:57.220
an all black radio station,

846
00:51:57.250 --> 00:52:00.970
I wouldn't have brought it up cause it would've looked like pandering.

847
00:52:00.971 --> 00:52:03.160
And then if I did bring it up,
sorry about my voice,
I sound like,

848
00:52:03.161 --> 00:52:04.000
well through puberty here.

849
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:07.300
Even if I did brought it up then I would have been honest about it.
But like,
no,

850
00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:10.930
I know it sounds like I'm pandering,
but there are some crossover things.

851
00:52:10.931 --> 00:52:12.460
I actually really enjoy it.

852
00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:14.733
<v 3>So</v>

853
00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:20.430
<v 1>do you mean you got,
she has to take some sort of the responsibility that,</v>

854
00:52:20.431 --> 00:52:23.640
you know,
she couldn't beat this fucking nitwit.
Um,
all right.

855
00:52:23.641 --> 00:52:28.580
Over 300 of the top economists,
I'm not saying that she's not an evil to

856
00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:32.400
over 300 the top economists,

857
00:52:32.401 --> 00:52:36.390
including eight Nobel laureates came together to see,

858
00:52:36.391 --> 00:52:37.380
I didn't know if they said that right,

859
00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:42.680
that a Trump presidency would mean turmoil in the American and as a result,

860
00:52:42.931 --> 00:52:44.040
the world's economy,

861
00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:48.960
over 350 of the best scientists in the world came together to say his presidency

862
00:52:48.961 --> 00:52:52.230
would be a disaster for the entire planet because of his dangerous stance on

863
00:52:52.231 --> 00:52:53.064
climate change.

864
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:57.720
Not to mention Russia literally threw a party in the parliament building as soon

865
00:52:57.721 --> 00:52:59.820
as Trump was elected.
That actually,

866
00:52:59.821 --> 00:53:04.140
I'm happy a lake when Russia in the United States are unfriendly fucking terms.

867
00:53:04.141 --> 00:53:08.460
It would be nice that we're not going in a direction to fucking keep pointing

868
00:53:08.461 --> 00:53:09.450
missiles at one another.

869
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:11.463
<v 3>MMM.</v>

870
00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:17.470
<v 1>And you know,
for as much as,
uh,
Al Gore Al Gore,</v>

871
00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:21.610
I loved his stance on climate change.
He wasn't able to get a fucking thing done.

872
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.520
He wasn't able to stop it.
He wanted to fucking,
uh,
get a few policies in there.

873
00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:29.610
They just ignore it.
And these guys are only in there for 48 years.

874
00:53:29.611 --> 00:53:31.140
They just wait him out.
I remember when Al Gore,

875
00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:34.470
when they have a car that got a hundred miles to a gallon,
I was excited.

876
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:37.050
I was in my twenties.
I wanted to buy the car.

877
00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.600
They just kept delaying it and delaying it,
delaying it,

878
00:53:39.601 --> 00:53:40.680
and then they got out of office.

879
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:44.460
Al Didn't beat Bush and then they just scrapped it and it was fucking over.

880
00:53:44.461 --> 00:53:47.760
And that's what they do because they don't give a shit.
They don't give a shit.

881
00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:51.990
You honestly think Hillary Clinton would have stopped global warming if you

882
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.280
taught Alba's 350 scientists that are all experts.
You know what else they said?

883
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:57.990
They said it's too late.

884
00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:02.870
It was too late by the 1980s it was [inaudible] or something on the 90s.
It's,

885
00:54:02.871 --> 00:54:05.310
it's Ben too late.
It's fuck.

886
00:54:05.311 --> 00:54:09.930
And it's almost like not even a fucking issue anymore.
Um,
I mean it is an issue,

887
00:54:09.931 --> 00:54:11.340
but the only way to do it,
it was we would,

888
00:54:11.341 --> 00:54:15.150
we would all have to fucking go back to live in like cavemen and on 90% of us

889
00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:19.260
would have to die and just kind of sit there and not do jumping jacks to add to

890
00:54:19.261 --> 00:54:23.040
the fucking heat and helped us think could heal itself.
Other than that,

891
00:54:23.041 --> 00:54:24.450
I don't know.
What the fuck are you going to do?

892
00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:29.250
Is everybody's running around just having to get a flat screen TV and every

893
00:54:29.251 --> 00:54:30.870
fucking room.
You know,

894
00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:34.030
I love how it's like the political candidates are responsible for it.

895
00:54:34.031 --> 00:54:37.870
It's like we're just as responsible as anybody else,
aren't we?
I Dunno.

896
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:40.100
Jesus Christ.
This is like meet the press here.
Anyways,

897
00:54:40.101 --> 00:54:43.980
so the next time you open that stupid fucking freckle crusted mouth,

898
00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:46.590
this guy like more enlightened than me.
By the way,

899
00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.840
remember your words have power.

900
00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:52.620
You are an influential person whether you want to believe it or not.

901
00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:55.500
I don't expect you to read this tirade on the podcast,

902
00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:58.950
but I hope you read it and realize what a fool you've been.
Why?

903
00:54:58.951 --> 00:55:03.000
Cause I don't agree with you because you have all of this.

904
00:55:03.001 --> 00:55:05.700
Admittedly that is,

905
00:55:05.701 --> 00:55:10.680
none of this was researched if he just did 45 minutes or research.

906
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:14.040
Oh,
earlier you told me a couple hours you could see that.
Yes.

907
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:18.870
Hillary made mistakes with the email and Ben [inaudible].
Yeah,
she made mistakes.

908
00:55:18.871 --> 00:55:22.500
Okay.
But nothing she ever did was criminal.

909
00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:26.790
Exactly.
All right.
Well,
Trump,
he made some mistakes with women,

910
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:30.870
but none of it was ever criminal or he would have been fucking in jail.
Right.

911
00:55:30.871 --> 00:55:35.310
He would have been brought up on charges.
Right.
The charges would have stuck.

912
00:55:35.311 --> 00:55:38.790
You can do the same thing.
You're going to completely and okay.

913
00:55:38.791 --> 00:55:41.420
You don't bring up the fucking Hillary Foundation or any of that type of shit

914
00:55:41.421 --> 00:55:44.790
either or any of the other fucking,
all that other,
whatever,

915
00:55:44.791 --> 00:55:46.920
the fucking Whitewater,
all of that fucking crap.

916
00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:48.750
You don't bring up any of that shit.

917
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:51.720
You don't bring up the fact that they're both worth hundreds of millions of

918
00:55:51.721 --> 00:55:54.480
fucking dollars.
And that's not a red flag to you.

919
00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:59.310
These down to Earth Democrats.
What were men of the people?

920
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:01.560
They're worth a couple hundred million dollars.

921
00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:03.990
The president's seat ps 500 grand a year.

922
00:56:03.991 --> 00:56:06.630
How do they do it and don't give me that horse shit about,

923
00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.550
they give political speeches,

924
00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:14.070
fucking political speeches that they give.
Okay,

925
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.980
can you at least agree with me on this or that is just,

926
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:19.530
that's just those people washing their bribe money.

927
00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:22.620
Those are the people that put them in office and then they go back and they give

928
00:56:22.621 --> 00:56:24.430
a speech and they give him 300

929
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:27.610
<v 0>grand,
250 grand to fucking speak there for it and give me a fucking break.</v>

930
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:32.410
All right.
All right,
so there,
that's his fucking thing.

931
00:56:32.411 --> 00:56:36.160
So he thinks I'm a moron and I got Trump to be fucking elected.
Okay.

932
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:39.280
Now here's something,
the exact opposite a bill.

933
00:56:39.281 --> 00:56:41.840
You really are uneducated on Trump bill.

934
00:56:41.841 --> 00:56:43.720
You need to run away from the progressive's.

935
00:56:43.721 --> 00:56:47.860
This person thinks I'm a progressive liberal.
Listen to the exact same podcast,

936
00:56:47.861 --> 00:56:52.780
sir.
Move the fuck out of California or whatever liberal spot you're living in.

937
00:56:53.050 --> 00:56:53.231
Now,

938
00:56:53.231 --> 00:56:56.770
this is what I can tell you immediately is the last person who wrote this email

939
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:59.620
is not listening to this at all.
It's just,

940
00:56:59.621 --> 00:57:03.120
it's already yelling at his fucking windshield about what a dope this guys,

941
00:57:03.130 --> 00:57:07.120
he goes,
I just heard your podcast about the tearful Democrats.

942
00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:09.280
He listened to my podcast and he said,

943
00:57:09.281 --> 00:57:12.760
he thinks that I'm a progressive liberal and for instance,

944
00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:17.710
you had no clue who is going to pay for the wall.
Dude,
I've said all along,

945
00:57:17.711 --> 00:57:18.580
I have no clue.

946
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:24.150
I don't know shit about football.
I watch fucking Patriot Seattle.

947
00:57:24.151 --> 00:57:28.920
I can't name half the fucking people.
All right,
here we go.
Uh,
you have no true.

948
00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:31.520
This is the funniest thing I've ever,
one of the funny things I've read,

949
00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:33.510
you have no clue who's gonna pay for the wall.

950
00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:37.440
Trump had a hundred rallies where he,
he asked the audience,

951
00:57:37.441 --> 00:57:40.560
who's going to pay for the wall and everyone would shout Mexico,

952
00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:51.690
do you realize that all you were doing was just repeating what he said was going

953
00:57:51.691 --> 00:57:56.340
to happen,
but he never said how we would get Mexico,
sir.

954
00:57:56.350 --> 00:58:00.160
Just imagine you didn't like your next door neighbor.

955
00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:01.901
Okay.

956
00:58:01.901 --> 00:58:05.650
And you was sick of him cutting across your lawn or whatever the fuck he was

957
00:58:05.651 --> 00:58:07.990
doing.
You know,
cutting across the corner,

958
00:58:07.991 --> 00:58:11.360
your lawn in making the grass go flat and you were fucking sick of it.

959
00:58:11.361 --> 00:58:12.430
And now let me ask you this.

960
00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:18.370
Let's say you decided to build a wall and you decided that he was going to pay

961
00:58:18.371 --> 00:58:20.830
for it.
How would you go about doing that?

962
00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:25.160
Exactly?

963
00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:29.780
Now let's move it up to a fucking country level.

964
00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:33.260
So we're going to build this wall and we're going to,
how are we,

965
00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:35.660
how is he going to make Mexico pay for it?

966
00:58:35.661 --> 00:58:38.900
And if you tell me it's only a guest because as far as I watched,

967
00:58:38.901 --> 00:58:39.980
he never said how

968
00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:47.100
economic sanctions you're going to pressure them into fucking doing it.

969
00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:52.110
Okay.
Anyways,
and here we go.
How is it that those mobs mobs,

970
00:58:52.111 --> 00:58:54.810
great word Dude are more educated than you.

971
00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:58.890
Who the fuck is saying that the benefit of the walls will be jobs?

972
00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:03.150
Who are you listening to and who said Trump doesn't want health care?

973
00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:07.350
He's been really left on healthcare saying people with no insurance should be

974
00:59:07.351 --> 00:59:10.860
able to get treatment and care from way back when he was running in the

975
00:59:10.861 --> 00:59:15.450
primaries seating.
Then this guy thinks Trump is left on this seat.
This is why.

976
00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:20.100
This is why sir,
the first person that you think I had influenced.

977
00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:22.130
It's like people just

978
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:23.330
<v 1>hear the podcast.</v>

979
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:27.500
You guys already have your fucking minds made up and then you listen to the

980
00:59:27.501 --> 00:59:29.810
podcast.
Okay,
and you,

981
00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:33.770
it's like watching a football game and you're listening to Chris Collins Worth.

982
00:59:33.771 --> 00:59:37.280
I met him one time when I did inside the NFL.
Chris Collins worth goes,

983
00:59:37.281 --> 00:59:42.281
everybody thinks I hate their fucking team and like the other team better and

984
00:59:42.741 --> 00:59:45.290
this,
well,
that's what you guys are doing with this podcast.
All right?

985
00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:48.590
You guys are listening to this shit.
You lean left or you lean right?

986
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:51.800
And when I trashed your guy,
you think I'm only trashing your,

987
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:55.430
your man or woman and I'm trashing it more than the other people.

988
00:59:56.300 --> 01:00:00.800
And then if and when your person loses,
you then blame my podcast.

989
01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:02.893
All right?

990
01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:06.980
You guys went out and you voted for who the fuck you wanted to vote for and you

991
01:00:06.981 --> 01:00:10.220
listen to the information that you wanted to listen to and you listen to

992
01:00:10.221 --> 01:00:13.280
whatever the fuck you were receptive to that vibe in your life,

993
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:15.620
which is the exact reason why when I,

994
01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.650
I was doing this bit on stage talking about Trump's support is going,

995
01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:21.920
how can you support this guy?
He's got people openly yelling the n word

996
01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.380
at his rallies.
There's video of that.
Doesn't that bother you?

997
01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.530
And this is what they would say.
Well,
you know,
I'm not,
I'd said this on Conan.

998
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:32.980
There'll be like,
we know I'm not.
I'm,
no,
I'm not into that.
I'm not doing that.

999
01:00:32.981 --> 01:00:35.620
But,
but Hillary and what it is,

1000
01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:40.660
is what tracks for people is what's going to affect their fucking life.

1001
01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:44.650
And unfortunately,
when it comes to fucking racism,

1002
01:00:44.890 --> 01:00:48.820
it doesn't track with white people because it's not a factor in their life.

1003
01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:55.560
White people are not victims of racism despite the fact they say that they are,

1004
01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.750
when they talk about like affirmative action,

1005
01:00:58.170 --> 01:01:01.290
that that's racist because they don't understand that the reason why affirmative

1006
01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:05.190
action came about was because racist white people would not hire people who are

1007
01:01:05.191 --> 01:01:06.024
not white.

1008
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:10.410
So they literally had to come up with the law to force white people to give

1009
01:01:10.411 --> 01:01:15.390
other people a chance.
And then what people do is they just look at that moment.

1010
01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:18.930
They don't look at the history of it.
They just look right then and there.

1011
01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:24.900
So I dunno,
I think that,
look,
I understand that right now.

1012
01:01:24.901 --> 01:01:25.440
Believe me,

1013
01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:28.680
do I understand going to comedy shows and seeing the way the fucking crowd is

1014
01:01:28.681 --> 01:01:32.880
reacting,
that this is a very volatile fucking time.
Um,

1015
01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:35.170
this guy goes on to talk about how fucking,
uh,

1016
01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:40.050
people thought Republicans were being dramatic when they said no to world war

1017
01:01:40.051 --> 01:01:44.250
three vote Trump,
but the democratic national,
a DNC,
fuck,

1018
01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:47.810
I don't know what the fuck it stands for.
Force Russia to,
uh,

1019
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:53.700
why is it a DNP Democratic National Party?
Uh,
make my life easier.

1020
01:01:53.701 --> 01:01:57.420
Force Russia did dump tons of money into hypersonic nuclear missiles.

1021
01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:01.420
They have these fucking hypersonic characters that can hold 16 nuclear warheads

1022
01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:04.370
that they can penetrate our missile shields,
uh,

1023
01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.120
Blahblahblahblahblah and all this type of shit.

1024
01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.780
A reputable scholars were saying that moving towards,

1025
01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:12.780
we're moving towards world war three.
If you elect Hillary now,

1026
01:02:12.781 --> 01:02:15.510
they're all changing their tune.
Thanks to president Trump,

1027
01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:18.900
former host of the apprentice.
Get on board with Trump.
You are annoying.

1028
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.070
Should be on our side.

1029
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:24.570
<v 0>See,
he doesn't think I'm fucking on his side.
You don't think I'm on your side?</v>

1030
01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:29.220
Both of you have scholars in scientists that say your point of view was right

1031
01:02:29.221 --> 01:02:33.030
because what you guys do is you go to [inaudible] dot com and you memorize a

1032
01:02:33.031 --> 01:02:36.110
bunch of horse shit.
And then when your person does it,

1033
01:02:36.111 --> 01:02:39.660
when you then fucking blame a podcast.
So there you go.

1034
01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:43.380
I don't know what to tell you guys.
I respect both of your opinions.

1035
01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.060
I don't agree on either one of them.

1036
01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:48.270
I usually don't say who I vote for because I think it's a private matter.

1037
01:02:48.271 --> 01:02:52.290
But I did not vote for either one of them.
I vote for,
I voted for somebody else.

1038
01:02:52.291 --> 01:02:53.460
Bernie wasn't on the ballot.

1039
01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:57.150
I voted for somebody else that I thought was the best candidate,

1040
01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.520
not who the fuck I thought was going to win.

1041
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:02.820
And I think that's a major problem is that people don't want what's right.

1042
01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:04.590
They want to win,
you know,

1043
01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:09.860
so they will go with a candidate that is a warmonger or a fucking racist or a,

1044
01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:12.120
or a corrupt piece of shit.

1045
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:16.920
And they don't give a fuck as long as they're wearing the right fucking color

1046
01:03:16.921 --> 01:03:21.630
tie.
All right.
And I want it done.
All right,
let's be some advertising everybody.

1047
01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:27.060
Um,
but I do have to say,
this is,
let's just say whatever Trump is going to do,

1048
01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:31.770
um,
all it's doing for me.
You know,

1049
01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:35.970
he appoints this guy and he's got this fucking past where he allegedly said

1050
01:03:35.971 --> 01:03:38.760
something about Jews,
you know,

1051
01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:43.440
wasn't proven or whatever,
but,
uh,
he's got this fucking background.

1052
01:03:43.441 --> 01:03:44.670
Like all that does to me,

1053
01:03:44.671 --> 01:03:49.140
it's just inspires me to become more of a fuck an understanding person and try

1054
01:03:49.141 --> 01:03:52.830
to listen to people.
And as long as you just take that,
like,

1055
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:56.780
that attitude,
you know,
I,

1056
01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:00.450
I don't really don't think a president should,
um,

1057
01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:03.510
make up your mind on who you should be afraid of

1058
01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:08.580
in what we need to do and what these people are going to do to us.

1059
01:04:08.581 --> 01:04:11.840
So what they're not going to do to us.
Just cause they fucking said it.
I don't,

1060
01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:13.610
I don't listen to that.

1061
01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:17.570
What I like to do was I listened to what the President says and then I go to the

1062
01:04:17.571 --> 01:04:21.950
country and I go to their fucking thing and I try to find some English story

1063
01:04:21.951 --> 01:04:23.510
about what the fuck they're saying about us.

1064
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:28.190
And then I tried to figure out what the middle is.
All right.

1065
01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:33.410
I don't know.
I don't give a shit.
What color?
Your fucking tires.
All right,

1066
01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:40.250
so white people,
if you're nervous,
okay.

1067
01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:43.670
Liberal whites,
if you're really a fucking good liberal white,

1068
01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:48.350
you'll become even more fucking understanding of people that aren't white and,

1069
01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:51.440
and,
and debt are going to,
you know,

1070
01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:52.413
<v 3>hm.</v>

1071
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:55.370
<v 0>Bear the brunt of what this guy might fucking do.</v>

1072
01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:00.050
I think it's your responsibility to become even more understanding.

1073
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:01.790
You know what I mean?

1074
01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:06.790
And stop making everything about yourself in your fucking world because the

1075
01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:11.630
mainstream is already about that.
All right?
They go,

1076
01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:12.590
I'm off my gaining,

1077
01:05:12.591 --> 01:05:16.250
checked out a ticket or don't you know it's up to fucking you.
All right,

1078
01:05:16.251 --> 01:05:20.020
but I don't want you,
I don't to hear you crying about frumpy.

1079
01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:21.640
Somebody taking your fucking,
I can't stand.

1080
01:05:21.641 --> 01:05:24.160
Listen to white people talking about other,
taking the country away from us.

1081
01:05:24.161 --> 01:05:28.390
It's like if he looked at a fucking census,
you idiot.
You know,
you're fine.
Okay.

1082
01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:30.100
Are the water parks they're made for you?

1083
01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.320
Don't give us a second look when you show up,
like what's,

1084
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:35.560
what's his element doing here?
They're excited.
You're there.

1085
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:38.860
And within two seconds to someone in a mascot outfit,
fucking hug in.
Yeah,

1086
01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.320
there you go.
All right.
You're going to be fine.
All right.

1087
01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.360
Driving your four wheeler on your property.

1103
01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:40.480
this watch has a really clean design.
I always hate this part.

1104
01:06:40.481 --> 01:06:42.670
It's like you already sold.
Are you going to come back around again?

1105
01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:47.060
It's watch has a really clean design.
Seriously.
Um,

1106
01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:51.160
evidently had been of been getting compliments ever since they put it on.

1107
01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.100
And not only am I not wearing it,
I actually lost my other watch.

1108
01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:57.700
It's a nice fucking watch.
Okay.
I didn't wear it cause I have other watches,

1109
01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:02.080
you know,
because I'm in my forties and I can afford a nice watch.

1110
01:07:02.081 --> 01:07:04.990
So I bought that one.
Know if I was in my twenties,
they'd fucking by this one.

1111
01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:06.873
All right.

1112
01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:11.050
And got to Mvt MVMT watches.com/bro join the movement.

1113
01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.760
But I didn't buy an overly expensive one.

1114
01:07:12.761 --> 01:07:15.910
I do not understand buying a super expensive fucking watch.
I just don't get it.

1115
01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:20.170
All right.
I don't understand it.
They'll just end up telling the time,
right?

1116
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:23.440
I mean,
this isn't going to gay.
Drove a Prius for nine years.

1117
01:07:23.890 --> 01:07:26.650
I should have a movement.
Watch.
All right.
stamps.com everybody,

1118
01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:31.210

cool.
All right.
Anyways,</v>

1135
01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:29.540
that's sort of the podcast.
Here's another thing,
like,
um,
you know,

1136
01:08:29.541 --> 01:08:33.230
I traveled a lot,
so I get to talk to all of these fucking people out there and,

1137
01:08:33.231 --> 01:08:36.650
uh,
I know somebody that voted for Trump and it was like,
I think it's exciting.

1138
01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:40.190
I think it's exciting that he's going to be present.
Obviously he's a white dude.

1139
01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:41.270
He's excited,
right?

1140
01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:48.500
And this is the same guy.
He said Obama's a fucking idiot.

1141
01:08:49.190 --> 01:08:51.980
All right?
Which you're free to say that you think he's a fucking idiot,

1142
01:08:51.981 --> 01:08:56.420
but you can watch fucking Donald Trump.
I got to do it.
It just,

1143
01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:57.710
it just,
I don't know.

1144
01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:00.140
That's what I learned traveling this country is just people here.

1145
01:09:00.141 --> 01:09:03.740
What the fuck they want to hear?
Um,
alright.
Lingerie.
Let's,

1146
01:09:03.741 --> 01:09:07.520
let's get off politics.
I'll give you guys a breather here.
All right?
But,
uh,

1147
01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:10.730
please guys,
just stop fucking yelling at each other.
All right?

1148
01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:14.780
It's just stop blaming everybody and just fucking be human beings here.

1149
01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:15.980
All right.
Let's be honest with you.

1150
01:09:15.981 --> 01:09:19.400
Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton or not out for you or for me.

1151
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:23.180
They're out there for themselves and that's why there weren't hundreds of

1152
01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.280
billions of dollars.
Make no mistake.
All right.

1153
01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:30.530
Fucking sharp and a radio station with your height size for Dwight just during

1154
01:09:30.531 --> 01:09:33.140
the campaign and where the fuck are you going to be the rest of the time you're

1155
01:09:33.141 --> 01:09:36.500
going to be the White House.
Spain up fucking land on aqua first.
All Right,

1156
01:09:37.190 --> 01:09:38.360
eight Billy nipple slip.

1157
01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:42.350
I recently started dating this girl and we've been messing around for a few

1158
01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:43.220
months now.
Congratulations.

1159
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:46.360
She's pretty cool and a really sweet girl and sex is great with her and all

1160
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:48.050
right,
Trifecta,
however,

1161
01:09:48.051 --> 01:09:52.640
she's been doing a lot of lingerie shopping and wants me to go with her one day

1162
01:09:52.641 --> 01:09:55.600
so we can show up for her lingerie together.
Uh,

1163
01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:59.420
personally I never got the point of lingerie nor am am I a big fan of it.

1164
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:04.460
I'm really just like,

1165
01:10:04.461 --> 01:10:06.090
when they just show up with like your fucking old

1166
01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:08.060
<v 1>basketball shorts on you,
one of those guys,</v>

1167
01:10:08.061 --> 01:10:11.570
as long as there's a pussy underneath it,
I don't give a bug.
All right.

1168
01:10:11.571 --> 01:10:12.404
Personally,

1169
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:15.950
I never got the book and it didn't see the point of buying something that was

1170
01:10:15.951 --> 01:10:19.580
meant for you to take off almost immediately after you put it on.

1171
01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:24.120
All right sir.
This is the thing about,
all right,
so you're a,

1172
01:10:24.121 --> 01:10:28.100
you're a year one of those.
No foreplay guys.
All right.

1173
01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:31.950
If you really want to take it to the next level too,
like you ever have,

1174
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:36.970
you ever make a meal for somebody and you sat it down and you turn your back to

1175
01:10:37.131 --> 01:10:40.040
the stove to set the panel back down.
And when you look back,

1176
01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:41.840
they were already halfway done with it and you're like,

1177
01:10:41.841 --> 01:10:46.250
what the fuck did I do all that work for?
Um,
I would let her buy that.

1178
01:10:46.251 --> 01:10:50.720
It makes her feel sexy.
Right?
And then,
you know,

1179
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:54.860
get Sarah even into the,
you know,
the mood a little bit more telling you do it.

1180
01:10:54.861 --> 01:10:57.410
Yeah.
You're striking me as somebody who never takes the downtown sex,

1181
01:10:57.411 --> 01:10:58.244
if you know what I mean.

1182
01:11:00.650 --> 01:11:05.040
<v 0>It just fucking ripped the clothes off,
puts her on her back,</v>

1183
01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:06.140
fucking rolls off

1184
01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:10.190
<v 1>fan and it,
then it turns on the fucking TV.
All right?
Also,</v>

1185
01:11:10.191 --> 01:11:12.980
I'm not that great at faking my,

1186
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:19.250
when her or a girls have broke out this sexy lingerie and I'm unenthused by it.

1187
01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:24.990
You know what dude?
Uh,
you're an asshole.

1188
01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:29.550
You really are an asshole.
Um,
and that can be a good thing.
You can,

1189
01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:30.780
you're going to get what you want in life,

1190
01:11:30.781 --> 01:11:34.410
but you're going to miss out on a lot in life.
Um,

1191
01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:39.390
it's even give got me in a great,
got me in trouble a couple of times.

1192
01:11:39.391 --> 01:11:42.180
The girls I had been dating for the most part have been pretty sexy,

1193
01:11:42.181 --> 01:11:45.510
but when it comes to lingerie,
I just think it makes things awkward.

1194
01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:48.420
That is the most overused word on the planet.

1195
01:11:48.450 --> 01:11:53.190
It's the default emotion of these,
this entire fucking world.

1196
01:11:53.191 --> 01:11:55.650
Now,
I don't even know what the word means anymore.

1197
01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:57.960
It's been applied to everything.
Everything's awkward.

1198
01:11:57.961 --> 01:12:01.500
I don't know what that means.
Same goes for things like sexting,

1199
01:12:01.501 --> 01:12:06.501
roleplaying badge and Ted picks and anything else that's kind of puts you on the

1200
01:12:07.531 --> 01:12:10.170
spot for things involving sex.

1201
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.500
Is it weird that that stuff does nothing for me?
No,
it isn't,

1202
01:12:13.501 --> 01:12:17.790
but it shouldn't make the other person feeling an asshole.
Uh,

1203
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:21.720
should I try to do my best?
I,
you know what I preempt,

1204
01:12:21.721 --> 01:12:24.120
I shouldn't have called you an asshole this early cause now you're asking

1205
01:12:24.121 --> 01:12:27.270
questions.
Sorry.
I apologize.
I'm wrong.
All right.
I should,

1206
01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:31.260
should I try my best to continue pretending that my wiener isn't shriveling up

1207
01:12:31.261 --> 01:12:35.040
like a sock when you pull the strings up,

1208
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:39.090
the strings out of it?
Oh,
the,
uh,

1209
01:12:39.091 --> 01:12:43.800
the loans are a huge fan of the podcast.
I haven't,
if you haven't yet,

1210
01:12:43.801 --> 01:12:44.430
please come out.

1211
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:46.860
I'm not going to say where he's from just in case his fucking girlfriend

1212
01:12:46.861 --> 01:12:49.560
recognizes this.
Um,

1213
01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.990
you know,
dude,
you could just kinda go along with that a little bit and like,

1214
01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:58.440
look,
I think like just saying,

1215
01:12:58.441 --> 01:13:02.250
you're not into sexting and in,
in,
in role playing and shit,

1216
01:13:02.251 --> 01:13:06.150
that's like next level shit.
If you're not into that,
that's fine.
Okay.

1217
01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:11.190
Um,
the larger ray,
I think as a simple thing you could put a happy face on.

1218
01:13:11.490 --> 01:13:14.700
I mean,
as much as guys think the luxuries for them,

1219
01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:19.510
and for the most part,
the way women dress,
like guys,

1220
01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:23.280
I look at it and she was hired.
She wants to dress it for themselves.

1221
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:27.360
They like to look pretty.
All right.
That makes them feel good.

1222
01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:29.640
So I think the lake near,
can you come in for a second?

1223
01:13:29.641 --> 01:13:33.450
She's given me a look here.
Come here.
Oh Jesus.

1224
01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:37.260
She literally walked by,
stopped and look at me.
All right.
So this guy,

1225
01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:43.260
this guy is a,
Oh my God,
it's 10 36.
I've got to get off my fucking day.

1226
01:13:43.261 --> 01:13:47.040
So this guy,
could you look less enthused?

1227
01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:52.770
Yeah,
you shot me a look.
I thought that meant you wanted to come in,
but go on.

1228
01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:58.150
What do you Henry Hill.
I'm just listening
anyway.
Anyway,

1229
01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:02.620
to say.
Then they wave two towns.
Me.
All right,
so this guy,

1230
01:14:02.621 --> 01:14:06.120
he's got this great girl.
She's fucking cool.
She's sexy.
Sax Is Great,

1231
01:14:06.121 --> 01:14:09.390
but she's into wearing sexy lingerie.
It does nothing for him.

1232
01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:12.100
She wants to fucking him to go along on

1233
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.290
<v 0>it and like he thinks it's just stupid,</v>

1234
01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:19.530
so she puts it on and she fucking pulls the strings like biodata.

1235
01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:20.440
Bu when he said,

1236
01:14:20.441 --> 01:14:23.440
I'm supposed to sit there and act like my direct deck is not shriveling up like

1237
01:14:23.441 --> 01:14:26.860
a sock.
What should I do?
He don't think,

1238
01:14:26.861 --> 01:14:29.800
he doesn't think lingerie a sexy.
He's just done it.
He goes,

1239
01:14:29.801 --> 01:14:31.530
I don't understand the point of just buying that.

1240
01:14:31.531 --> 01:14:34.480
None of it's going to take it off like two seconds later.
Okay.

1241
01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:40.000
It makes her feel good.
Just go along with it.
It's not going to kill you.

1242
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:43.930
That's my advice.
Yeah,
it's fine.
It's just,
just go along with it.

1243
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:47.680
It's now he said,
what about like sexting Vage and titty pics?
He goes,

1244
01:14:47.681 --> 01:14:50.920
I'm not into any of that or role playing.
You are so boring.

1245
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:52.030
Whoever wrote this in,

1246
01:14:56.020 --> 01:15:00.580
I use really just,
it's like a job fucking prude and you're so boring.

1247
01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:05.110
Like loosen up a little bit.
Send a dick pic to your girlfriend.
No,

1248
01:15:05.111 --> 01:15:08.160
that's a bad idea.
Yeah.
I mean you probably should.
Yeah.
You never see.
You don't,

1249
01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:11.160
you never send any of that shit because it exists forever.
Yeah.

1250
01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:14.290
He'd be the one person,
it would come back to haunt him somehow.

1251
01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:17.560
So maybe don't do that,
but just open your mind a little bit.

1252
01:15:17.561 --> 01:15:21.220
It sounds like you're on a little sexual box and maybe you need to,

1253
01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:25.660
no pun intended,
no pun intended,
you need to break out of this box.
But yeah,

1254
01:15:25.661 --> 01:15:28.510
here's the thing.
Explore something different and you know,

1255
01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:31.990
here's the thing on the Dick Pic,
Nia.
Okay.
People think,
okay,

1256
01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:35.110
I'm going to send a dick pic to you from my phone to your phone.

1257
01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:40.530
Just think of the journey that think takes my dick goes to outer space.

1258
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:43.630
Yup.
Goes off a satellite,
it comes back down.

1259
01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:46.870
God knows how much shit is between that and that.
I mean,

1260
01:15:46.871 --> 01:15:48.670
how many miles that think just travel.

1261
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.490
And to think that that's just going to go there.

1262
01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:54.550
And then if you're on like Twitter or do they say like,

1263
01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:59.020
can we want permission to have access to your photos?
And I never say yes.

1264
01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:00.970
It's like you can have access to this photo

1265
01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:04.010
<v 5>know.
Yeah.</v>

1266
01:16:04.370 --> 01:16:06.940
<v 0>All of a sudden somebody,
you know,
you have to see your avatars,</v>

1267
01:16:06.941 --> 01:16:10.160
your dick pic to somebody else's Avatar should tech pick?
Yeah.

1268
01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:14.750
<v 5>Deck peg,
delete the deck,
peck and then NASA person to delete the deck.</v>

1269
01:16:14.751 --> 01:16:17.920
Peck to no,
you'd never sent pics.
I gets down San bins.

1270
01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.910
<v 0>What you do is say,
where are you?
I'll show it to you.</v>

1271
01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:28.420
<v 5>Like in the old days.
In color.
Yeah.
Like the old satellite Dick Pics.
Yeah.</v>

1272
01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:30.550
Um,
but yeah,
in terms of this guy,

1273
01:16:30.551 --> 01:16:33.700
I think he should just kind of opened his mind a little bit.
Like I said,

1274
01:16:33.701 --> 01:16:36.610
it seems a little low prudish and it's fine.

1275
01:16:36.611 --> 01:16:38.710
You don't have to like lingerie and all that,

1276
01:16:38.711 --> 01:16:42.460
but I mean if your girls into it and you like her and she likes lingerie,

1277
01:16:42.461 --> 01:16:46.250
like hey,
what's the problem?
You know,
just like I said,
it's not right.

1278
01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:50.140
I don't see any problem with how do you not like lingerie?
I Dunno.

1279
01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.880
That's what I'm saying is boring as fuck.

1280
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:55.050
<v 0>You're saying he wants you to show up wearing his basketball shorts.</v>

1281
01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:58.890
He just like,
just be naked.
That's what I was saying.
You know,

1282
01:16:58.891 --> 01:17:01.000
it was comparing it to like,
you know when you cook somebody a meal,

1283
01:17:01.001 --> 01:17:04.920
then they eat it in two seconds.
She just like,
dude,
what the fuck?
Like you do?

1284
01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.950
Huh?
But not in the bedroom.
Oh,

1285
01:17:11.150 --> 01:17:16.130
<v 5>I do wolf down food.
You do?
Huh?
But that's not the only thing.</v>

1286
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.530
<v 0>Jesus Christ Chase is Christ Nia.</v>

1287
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:26.690
Why would you say that?
No,
that's disgusting.
You take your time,
a woman in your,

1288
01:17:26.691 --> 01:17:30.860
in your condition.
My condition,
condition.
Speaking this way.
That's terrible.

1289
01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:36.860
What if other people were to hear it?
I know.
Let me think.
What would they think?

1290
01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:40.970
All right,
that's the podcast here.
That's it.
That's it.
Oh,

1291
01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:44.750
oh no.
Well you got me here now.

1292
01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:47.900
Well I got to go edit my special.
I got to see how my,

1293
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:53.050
especially at [inaudible] where I trashed both Hillary and Trump and still get

1294
01:17:53.121 --> 01:17:57.470
shit for it.
Yeah,
no and then Trump can't win.
Now you can't win.

1295
01:17:57.471 --> 01:18:00.620
And that's why I never,
I don't tell people who to vote for and I,
but I mean it,

1296
01:18:00.621 --> 01:18:03.740
it is like,
you know,
it's going on,

1297
01:18:03.741 --> 01:18:07.270
so I'm going to fucking talk about it because it's fun.
It's fun to shit on them.

1298
01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:10.310
Yeah.
But like,
I think this one,
people are so upset that they,

1299
01:18:10.311 --> 01:18:13.490
that their person didn't get in that now they're looking to blame.

1300
01:18:13.491 --> 01:18:18.350
So evidently the Monday morning podcast has the ability to sway a presidential

1301
01:18:18.351 --> 01:18:19.080
election

1302
01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.380
<v 5>rent.
Well,
you know,</v>

1303
01:18:20.410 --> 01:18:24.400
you do have a platform and you have to use it responsibly.

1304
01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:27.770
<v 0>I'm going to start using this platform.</v>

1305
01:18:27.771 --> 01:18:30.890
I think it's time everybody buys me a new car.

1306
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:33.890
<v 5>This will be good for America.</v>

1307
01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:40.700
It's completely ridiculous.
People know who the fuck they gonna vote for.
Yeah.

1308
01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:45.950
And then it just needs to just need some time to,

1309
01:18:46.190 --> 01:18:46.790
I dunno,

1310
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:51.560
I dunno if anyone's ever going to be fully okay with what just happened,
but,

1311
01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:56.400
well,
Trump supporters are totally,
yeah,
they're great.
Totally okay with it.

1312
01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:59.270
Good right now.
Yeah.
But,
oh well,

1313
01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:03.060
<v 0>I'm glad she's fucking gone,
but I'm,
I'm not happy that he's here.
There was an,</v>

1314
01:19:03.090 --> 01:19:04.470
there was a lose lose

1315
01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:08.970
<v 5>situation.
Definitely depressing.
No matter how you slice it,</v>

1316
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:13.490
it's fucking depressing.
But life goes on.
It has to.
Yeah.

1317
01:19:13.491 --> 01:19:14.251
And you know something.

1318
01:19:14.251 --> 01:19:18.760
I don't think people should just fucking like it says it doesn't change who you

1319
01:19:18.761 --> 01:19:22.450
are going to be as a person.
Yeah.
I think if anything,

1320
01:19:22.451 --> 01:19:24.550
you just do what people are saying.

1321
01:19:24.551 --> 01:19:28.870
You stay here and you'd pay attention to what's going on and you support the

1322
01:19:28.871 --> 01:19:32.860
causes that mean a lot to you and just put all your effort behind that.

1323
01:19:32.861 --> 01:19:35.260
I feel like that's the way to like really make change.

1324
01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:38.660
<v 0>Should you not move to Canada and no,
they don't want us.</v>

1325
01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:43.850
I,
that was not funny thing too where they all acted like that they were going to

1326
01:19:43.851 --> 01:19:44.684
be so accepting.
Yeah.

1327
01:19:44.710 --> 01:19:47.260
<v 5>Well yeah.
Okay.
That doesn't fucking want us like,</v>

1328
01:19:47.261 --> 01:19:50.320
and I like how I feel like it's really arrogant to just be like,
oh,

1329
01:19:50.321 --> 01:19:53.890
I'm just going to move to Canada.
Canada is like,
okay,
do I have any say on this?

1330
01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:57.910
Like why do I become the place that you come to after your country made a
horror?

1331
01:19:58.090 --> 01:19:59.430
<v 0>I know,
but the,
these are,</v>

1332
01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:04.440
these are some of the great artistic minds on the planet would be gracing their

1333
01:20:04.631 --> 01:20:08.730
country with their songs and their standup comedy.
They should be happy.

1334
01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:13.950
They should welcome them with open arms.
Wow.
The ones I like,

1335
01:20:13.951 --> 01:20:14.910
the celebrities were like,

1336
01:20:14.911 --> 01:20:19.911
today my heart has tonight my heart cries but tomorrow I fight and they get the

1337
01:20:20.611 --> 01:20:22.200
little fucking muscle thing there.

1338
01:20:22.201 --> 01:20:24.450
It's like you probably go to your personal trainer first,
I would think.

1339
01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.930
Maybe have your personal chef make you guilty of that.

1340
01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:32.940
I put on Twitter that I cried,
but I felt hopeful because I did.

1341
01:20:33.090 --> 01:20:36.810
I've never cried after an election before and I did,
but I'm done crying,

1342
01:20:37.530 --> 01:20:41.370
I'm over crying and uh,
I'm ready to move forward and you know,

1343
01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:43.613
you can

1344
01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:49.650
just picture somebody's crying with their fucking downtown to ocean views.

1345
01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:52.110
What's going to happen to me?

1346
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:56.920
Um,
yeah,

1347
01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:59.910
isn't it like mid term elections or something come up and like a year and a half

1348
01:20:59.911 --> 01:21:02.220
or something like that.
Then it was going to go the other way.

1349
01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:05.130
Now we'll see what happens in four years.

1350
01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.100
If he gets reelected or somebody else comes in.
I don't even know how,

1351
01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.750
I didn't even understand how the process works.

1352
01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:11.610
I'm going to keep throwing that out there cause I didn't know.

1353
01:21:11.611 --> 01:21:16.170
He said fucking clean support.
Can Bernie ran again and four years do you think?

1354
01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:17.611
No,

1355
01:21:17.611 --> 01:21:22.611
Bernie cannot win because he's not owned by the same seven corporations that you

1356
01:21:23.191 --> 01:21:25.940
need to be owned by.
I'm just throwing seven up.

1357
01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.530
He comes back and he runs in four years against Trump.

1358
01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:33.060
I would say the media will,
the left media,
we'll fucking take them out again.

1359
01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:37.350
They'll take,
but can he win?
Can you really win?
That's what they did.

1360
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:38.310
They fucked him over.

1361
01:21:38.370 --> 01:21:42.600
They fucked him over and they left us with this polarizing person and then she

1362
01:21:42.601 --> 01:21:46.800
fucking lost and now people are all going,
what the fuck happened?

1363
01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:51.720
And they're blaming podcasts.
It's my fault.
It's my fault.

1364
01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:55.800
Trump got in also.
It's also my flats.
Have you done this?

1365
01:21:55.801 --> 01:21:59.010
This fucking Trump supporter guy goes like you sitting there talking about the

1366
01:21:59.011 --> 01:22:02.640
cost of the wall.
How can you be so ignorant about the costs of the wall?

1367
01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:05.610
He goes to mobs of people that show yet there must have been.

1368
01:22:06.250 --> 01:22:09.150
It's so fucking dumb.
I actually think somebody,
uh,

1369
01:22:10.110 --> 01:22:13.240
democratic supporters sent it and he said every time he said,

1370
01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:17.880
who's going to pay for the wall,
the whole mob would yell Mexico.
Like,

1371
01:22:17.881 --> 01:22:19.650
how can you be so dumb that you didn't realize that?

1372
01:22:19.651 --> 01:22:21.150
Now that I'm saying that again,
I think that that,

1373
01:22:21.151 --> 01:22:24.240
I think someone was trolling me there.
I can't believe someone was that well,

1374
01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:27.210
but Trump's sad that he was like,

1375
01:22:27.211 --> 01:22:29.850
we're going to build a wall and Mexico's going to pay for it.

1376
01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:32.940
I know who would be dumb enough to think that you can make another country pay

1377
01:22:32.941 --> 01:22:33.774
for your shit.

1378
01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:37.890
We're going to build a wall to keep you out and you're going to pay for it.

1379
01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:39.660
I was saying that would be like if your neck,

1380
01:22:39.661 --> 01:22:41.640
if you didn't like your next door neighbor and you built a wall,

1381
01:22:41.641 --> 01:22:44.350
then you sent them a bill and it would be like,
ah,

1382
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:46.620
make a paper airplane and just throw it back over.

1383
01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:51.060
I have no idea how he plans on enforcing that against,
so we'll see.

1384
01:22:51.450 --> 01:22:55.260
You know what I do love is that the first lady has fake tits.

1385
01:22:58.770 --> 01:23:01.200
I thought they weren't.
It was just to round.
How would we,

1386
01:23:01.201 --> 01:23:03.900
how would you possibly know that?
I don't know that and yeah,

1387
01:23:03.901 --> 01:23:08.380
I don't know anything.
I don't know anything.
I mean,

1388
01:23:08.381 --> 01:23:11.170
I've said that for fucking years.
That's true.

1389
01:23:11.770 --> 01:23:13.480
He has put it out there that he's got it.

1390
01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:17.830
He's got the president as a trophy wife.
It's fucking hilarious.

1391
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:23.470
He's on his third one.
If you fucking act up,
don't even think you're going to be,

1392
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:26.740
you're going to be sitting here picking up plates during my second term lady.

1393
01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:28.740
He has a wife like it doesn't even,
I don't know.

1394
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:33.300
She doesn't even like register for me.
I mean,
yeah,
she's beautiful and all that,

1395
01:23:33.301 --> 01:23:38.300
but I don't really care.
I liked that she plagiarized Michelle Obama's speech,

1396
01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:42.710
which I think is really related to the millennials,
the way they cure rate,

1397
01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:43.220
you know,

1398
01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:47.600
Shit that they didn't do onto their Facebook pages and youtube pages and fucking

1399
01:23:47.601 --> 01:23:49.970
make all this money off of stuff that they didn't really do.

1400
01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:53.180
Oh you mean like sharing of memes and things,

1401
01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:57.140
sharing of standup specials and music and videos,

1402
01:23:57.141 --> 01:23:59.030
shit that they didn't do and they just take it.

1403
01:23:59.370 --> 01:24:03.570
Well I thought that was very millennial of our grandpa was that what the young

1404
01:24:03.571 --> 01:24:08.290
people do that is what they do.
Oh I fucking hate.

1405
01:24:08.291 --> 01:24:10.770
Or You just exonerated all of them from stealing all that shit.

1406
01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:14.310
Those specials costs me a bunch of fucking money and everybody just takes,

1407
01:24:14.311 --> 01:24:18.090
everyone should steal your special and are downloaded illegally.
Of course.

1408
01:24:18.091 --> 01:24:19.680
I don't believe that they should do that.
Yeah.

1409
01:24:19.681 --> 01:24:24.681
You have to understand that you have a platform on this podcast and all of those

1410
01:24:26.401 --> 01:24:28.500
people that were already doing it anyways.

1411
01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:32.430
There's now a bunch of others that are now going to do it cause you said it was

1412
01:24:32.431 --> 01:24:35.430
okay.
Hey,
you know what's weird is the wind screen is red.

1413
01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:37.410
Maybe I am a Trump supporter.
Oh,

1414
01:24:37.411 --> 01:24:40.800
maybe so maybe that was a subconscious decision on your part.

1415
01:24:41.190 --> 01:24:42.980
I liked the orange one,
but cleo ate it.

1416
01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:47.460
It reminded me of fucking ABC's wide world of sports with Jim Mckay,

1417
01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:50.910
who I knew you were an elephant.
You seem like a jackass to me.

1418
01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:56.700
Nothing.
Oh,
I didn't get it.
Oh,
I didn't get all that.

1419
01:24:56.701 --> 01:25:00.810
Those are the animals,
right?
Jesus Democrats are really donkeys.

1420
01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:05.520
Why would they pick that?
I don't know it a reason behind it.
We just haven't.

1421
01:25:05.521 --> 01:25:09.960
Wicca,
PD googled it,
whatever.
Well,
I'm sure someone will tell me why.

1422
01:25:10.290 --> 01:25:15.090
Preempting it.
Hey,
you fucking moron.
I'm all right.
That's the podcast.

1423
01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:17.970
Uh,
I'm sorry for Donald Trump.
Uh,

1424
01:25:19.170 --> 01:25:21.080
next time I will try to,
uh,

1425
01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:26.090
I haven't made up my mind who I want to be president yet.
Uh,

1426
01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:30.750
the next time I think I'm already over Trump and a I will,

1427
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:35.400
I'll figure it out.
Yeah,
I hope so.
So this doesn't happen again.

1428
01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:40.500
You fucking election rigor.
You can regular you all right?

1429
01:25:40.501 --> 01:25:43.680
That's it.
I gotta I gotta fucking upload this shit and I got to go edit.

1430
01:25:43.681 --> 01:25:46.620
My goddamn specialist is going to be the worst fucking thing ever.
All right.

1431
01:25:46.621 --> 01:25:48.260
Go for it.
He sells,
we'll talk to you on Thursday.
