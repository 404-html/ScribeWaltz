1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.740
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:02.741 --> 00:00:04.890
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:09.600
December 12th,
2016 what's going on?

4
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:12.690
How I yeah.
Uh,
I've gotta be a little quiet man.

5
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:14.670
It's only like six 30 in the morning out here.

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.810
My lovely wife is still sleeping and uh,

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.470
so I'm trying not to wake her up.
I'm upstairs.
Can try to be a good boy.

8
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:26.310
These four can we go right?
I'm still gonna say all the fucked up shit.

9
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:28.710
I always say,
I'm just going to say it at a volume.
And so,
you know,

10
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:32.490
a little more palatable for [inaudible].
You know,

11
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:34.260
I woke up this morning by Dubai do boop,

12
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.980
I heard this big fucking booming noise and a,

13
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:40.070
you ever get that feeling like you liked it?

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.490
I just dreamed that or somebody in the house.
Right?

15
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.380
And then you immediately start thinking like,
all right,
I got kitchen knives,

16
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.050
I got to fucking softball bat right next to my bed.
And,
uh,

17
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.180
but the reality is,
you know,

18
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.930
as much as people are want gun control and all of that shit,

19
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.890
I mean that's the first thing you think of.
You know,
the real,

20
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:12.570
you know,
this should be a fucking thing,
right.
Where if he,
if he,

21
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.490
if they can fucking test you one goddamn time.
Yeah.

22
00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:21.390
So like five fucking questions and then all of a sudden you never have to go

23
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:25.560
through any sort of fucking,
you know,
major security at the airport.

24
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:29.790
Cause one time you didn't act like a fucking lunatic and then I guess you're

25
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:31.200
good for the rest of your life.

26
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.580
Why can't just like one time Kay can't come up with the same type of a test,

27
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:37.440
whatever the fuck they seen down at the airport.

28
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.360
They can't come up with that for fucking regular people.
You know,

29
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.800
you know,
it'd be perfect.

30
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.090
Just have a fucking 38 and they let you have a silencer now.
Fuck that.

31
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:51.180
A Glock with the silencer cause you don't want to ruin your ears.

32
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:54.240
You just want to kill the person that comes in your house.
Right.
It'd be great.

33
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:57.660
Be Right there next to your table and the person comes walking in,

34
00:01:57.661 --> 00:02:00.830
you know faggy man,
how your fucking money just reach over to do,

35
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.370
do they fucking hit the ground?
You put the gun back down,

36
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:08.600
you just go back to sleep and you know,
couple hours,
wake back up again.

37
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.200
You're like,
oh,
I your brother look him up.
Oh.
Oh,

38
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:16.440
that's right.
That's right.
Yeah.

39
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:20.430
While you were sleeping in some guy broken.
Yeah,
she's dead.
Um,

40
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.390
you want to where you want to call the cops?
I'll get some,
uh,
you know,

41
00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:28.380
get the coffee going.
You know,

42
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.400
everybody,
you know,
they tell you don't have a knife or anything like that.

43
00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:35.130
You want bat,
we'll give you distance.
But at the end of the day,

44
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.770
you know what I mean?
There has to be some sort of test.

45
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.300
They look at you fucking driving record,
right?
How you did in high school.
Jesus,

46
00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:44.910
I'd be out the window.
I don't know what the fuck.
However the fuck they do it.

47
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.780
Okay.
And you know,
you just get,
you get,

48
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.340
you get a glock with a fucking silencer.
You don't hurt your ears,
you know,

49
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.050
aim center mass or whatever be,
it would be a great fucking thing.

50
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.230
I really think it would be a great thing.
You know,

51
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.180
as long as you knew what everybody's feet sounded like on the floor in your

52
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:07.330
house,
as long as you know what you knew what their walked sounded like,

53
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:11.350
that would be the test right there.
All your loved ones in your house,

54
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:16.210
they would from bare feet to fucking snow shoes.
You just had to be like,

55
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.330
all right,
that's my son Mikey.
Okay.

56
00:03:20.331 --> 00:03:23.990
That's my wife and she's wearing uggs.
Right.
And you get it all down.

57
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.710
All right,
so then you know what the fucking sound is?

58
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.190
I don't know.
I'm just saying I had a little fucking,
I heard a noise.

59
00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:33.950
I get a little nervous.
So it was just like,

60
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.430
what am I Jason Fucking born over here?
I'm not,
you know,

61
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.050
my wife's been snoring to beat the fucking band now that she's in the third

62
00:03:42.051 --> 00:03:46.440
trimester,
which is understandable.
The kids laying on her fucking lungs.
So,
uh,

63
00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:50.270
I have to go upstairs to sleep and I had all of this shit went through my

64
00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:53.220
fucking head.
Right?

65
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.460
Like what if somebody came and downstairs took out my wife and left with no

66
00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:01.620
fucking fingerprints?
They're gonna fucking blame me.

67
00:04:01.621 --> 00:04:03.840
That's the first thing I thought.
Not,
oh my God,

68
00:04:03.841 --> 00:04:05.580
my pregnant wife was going to be dead.

69
00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:08.970
First thing I thought is I'm going to go to jail for that shit.
That's what,

70
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:11.970
you know,
I'm really selfish when I'm in the middle of the night,

71
00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:16.260
I'm really groggy.
Like,
like right now I'm awake.
And I'd be like,
well,
I don't,

72
00:04:16.261 --> 00:04:19.170
I would be too.
I wouldn't give a fuck what they did to me at that point.

73
00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:20.970
I would be so upset that I lost my wife.

74
00:04:20.971 --> 00:04:23.880
But when I'm laying here nice and toasty under the sheets,

75
00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:27.030
that's the first thing I thought of.
Like,
Oh man,
I love this bed.
That man,

76
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.260
I wouldn't have this bed in jail

77
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.020
anyways.
Um,
we're getting down to a people.

78
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.080
There's only another fucking a 19 days left in this year to fuck Christmas,

79
00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:47.400
by the way.
Fuck Christmas right up the old fucking Yahoo.
All right.

80
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.630
Fuck that stupid ass fucking holiday.
It's for fucking kids.

81
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.040
The level of fucking pressure I have to run around and buy fucking adults.

82
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.410
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.210
<v 0>Fucking presence.
What do you want a Choo Choo train?
Your fucking can't.</v>

84
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.920
I don't have time for this shit.
I got too much other stuff to do.

85
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.860
He had been a dead dead dead day,
you know,
it's fucking brutal,

86
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:15.120
man.
I had one of the worst,
one of the worst.
Fuck,
I wasn't gonna talk about this.

87
00:05:15.121 --> 00:05:18.060
I had one of the worst fucking weeks in my life and this Christmas music in the

88
00:05:18.061 --> 00:05:19.620
background is fucking driving me nuts.

89
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:23.090
I'm going to gloss over all of this shit because,
um,

90
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.510
I've never gotten an emotional on the podcast.
I do not want to do it now.
Uh,

91
00:05:27.511 --> 00:05:27.781
you know,

92
00:05:27.781 --> 00:05:31.170
I told you one of my good friends died and went to the memorial service in

93
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.700
is too,
you know,
he's got two kids,
10 years old.
Went up and spoke at,

94
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:41.050
it was the most heart wrenching thing I ever saw.
And then Thursday,

95
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.920
I know this is going to be probably devastating to a lot of you guys.

96
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.310
I had to give my dog away.
Yes.
Oh,

97
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.430
cleo.
I had to do it.
I got a baby coming.
And um,

98
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.240
the Cleo that you hear on the podcast is not the Cleo thet.
Um,

99
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.430
unfortunately when anybody else comes to the door and uh,
you know,

100
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.270
she tried to attack my parents,
my brother in law,
my father in law,

101
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.650
all of my friends,
she bit,

102
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:14.170
one of my friends nipped him and was just like,
uh,
it,

103
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.193
you know,

104
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.750
it was a ticking fucking time bond for seven years with the dog.

105
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.900
I love the dog to death.
My wife loves the dog.

106
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.370
I was fucking devastated.

107
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.590
Most devastating thing I've had to do was just one of those adult decisions

108
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:34.850
where it was like my brain was like,

109
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:39.380
there's no fucking way you can have a baby crawling around that then becomes a

110
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:42.680
toddler and they don't know how to fucking pet a dog.

111
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.820
And then she gets a little older and then has friends over and their parents

112
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:51.500
come over.
It was just a,
it was a ticking time bomb.

113
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:56.501
She does not do well adjusting to new things and something horrible is gonna

114
00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:57.021
Happen.

115
00:06:57.021 --> 00:07:02.021
And then she was going to get put down so I had to do the responsible thing and

116
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:04.570
a founder,
a great home.
Eh,

117
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.900
this is what kills me is she's totally adjusted now and his fucking happy as

118
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:13.000
shit and I'm fucking devastated cause she's a fucking dog and within four days,

119
00:07:13.001 --> 00:07:16.720
so like,
oh is this the new deal?
You're the guide now.
All right.

120
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.240
Um,
so um,

121
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.450
I'll tell you a quick story dude.

122
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.250
Fucking I had to hand the dog off to my trainer,
right?
So the whole morning,

123
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.400
I don't want to act emotional cause I don't want the dog to be nervous and uh,

124
00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:38.720
so I took her on one last hike is fucking brutal and um,

125
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.180
<v 2>okay</v>

126
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.130
<v 0>then I was gathering up all her stuff.</v>

127
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.820
I give it all to the trainer and I go to hand off the fucking dog and it's like

128
00:07:47.951 --> 00:07:50.590
I didn't want it to be nervous so I barely even said goodbye.

129
00:07:50.591 --> 00:07:52.360
I was like all right buddy.
Okay.
See you later.

130
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.500
Cause I didn't want it to be nervous cause I love it so much.
And then I fucking,

131
00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.083
you know,

132
00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:58.820
<v 2>okay.</v>

133
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.270
<v 0>You know,
the trainer takes it and then I went back in the house,</v>

134
00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:04.820
went to the bathroom and then fucking cried like a little boy.

135
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.750
It was fucking brutal.
Brutal.
You know,

136
00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:15.740
it's fucking hilarious.
My,
the way women handle this fucking emotion,
like

137
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:22.220
my wife like sobbed like five or six fucking times,

138
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.330
including the night before.
And then they,

139
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:30.350
their ability to fucking move ahead is his fucking astounding.

140
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.570
Like they can,

141
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.600
they can know it's sad deal with it being sad.

142
00:08:38.701 --> 00:08:40.620
They fucking cry it out of them.

143
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.510
And then I'm not saying she's not heartbroken,
she's fucking devastated.

144
00:08:45.511 --> 00:08:47.820
But like their ability,

145
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:53.150
their fucking ability to handle shit like that versus a guy guys fucking denied,

146
00:08:53.311 --> 00:08:56.910
denied,
denied and then they hold onto the shit.
You know what I mean?

147
00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.640
Everybody's got that fucking buddy of theirs,
you know what I mean?

148
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.570
They're married,
they got a couple of kids,
but you get like two,

149
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:05.010
three scotches and um,
they talk,

150
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.750
start talking about some broad from fucking 25 years ago.
It's like,
dude,

151
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:12.810
what are you going to let it go?
We,
cause you know,
we were not allowed.

152
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

153
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.350
<v 0>Like when I cried over my dog the whole time I was fighting it,</v>

154
00:09:17.351 --> 00:09:21.860
so it was like an eight second cry.
Punahou done.
All right.

155
00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:24.680
Fight it off.
[inaudible] just keep it right there in your chest.

156
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.840
Keep it fucking right there and then,
you know,

157
00:09:26.841 --> 00:09:28.900
I'm telling you fucking like nine years from now,

158
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:33.910
be the fucking Christmas party and have a couple too many fucking zinfandels and

159
00:09:33.951 --> 00:09:35.690
I'll lash out at somebody and they'd be like,
dude,

160
00:09:35.691 --> 00:09:37.250
where the fuck did that come from?
And it's,

161
00:09:37.251 --> 00:09:40.850
and I'm not even going to know it's going to be because I didn't hug my dog

162
00:09:40.851 --> 00:09:42.350
before.
I mean,
I definitely,
you know,

163
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.380
I did with the day's coming up in that type of shit,

164
00:09:45.381 --> 00:09:48.110
but I should've given it one last fucking hug,
but I knew I couldn't do it,

165
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.840
you know?
Um,
so,

166
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.010
<v 1>okay.</v>

167
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.050
<v 0>All right,
let's pass that.
Let's get past that.
Anyways,</v>

168
00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.870
so I went to the rams game yesterday,
by the way.

169
00:10:01.871 --> 00:10:05.560
I did hit pause to regroup.
Brutal,

170
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.450
brutal fucking week.

171
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.660
And the whole fucking time I got to sit and listen to fucking Christmas music

172
00:10:10.661 --> 00:10:14.980
everywhere I go.
You know,

173
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.670
if I had a hammer hammer,
is that a fucking Christmas song?

174
00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:24.400
It's kind of a fucking psycho song,
right?
Second adults is if I had a hammer,

175
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.810
we all know what a hammer is for two.
All right?
I don't know.

176
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.690
I always get nervous when I hit that four sentence,
if I had a hammer.
Um,
anyways,

177
00:10:32.691 --> 00:10:35.310
so I went to the rams for us.
Um,

178
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:36.540
<v 1>okay.</v>

179
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.640
<v 0>The Atlanta Falcons game yesterday,
um,</v>

180
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:44.460
a buddy of mine had tickets and uh,
I was like,
dude,
I gotta go.

181
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:49.461
Cause I really wanted to see the Los Angeles Rams playing in the La Memorial

182
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:55.020
Coliseum.
I mean,
that's where all the greats played from the rams history.

183
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:55.854
Right.

184
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:56.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

185
00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.190
<v 0>I believe Eric Dickerson played there before he went to a,</v>

186
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.020
before they moved down to Anaheim,
probably the last of the greats to play there.

187
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:08.070
Uh,
the fearsome foursome,
right?
Lamar,

188
00:11:08.071 --> 00:11:12.690
Lamar,
Lundy,
Merlin Olsen,
Rosey Greer,

189
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:17.280
Deacon Jones.
Well that was Roman Gabriel.

190
00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:18.630
That was all before my time.

191
00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:22.300
Then I came in when it was the fucking quarterback controversy of Pat Haden,

192
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.490
Vince Ferragamo,
Wendell Tyler,

193
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.590
right?
Jim and Jack Young blood.
What was crazy about them as back then,

194
00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:34.680
if somebody had the same always,
if somebody has the same last name as you,

195
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.600
they put just your first initial and then a period.
But it was jack and Jim,

196
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.530
so they had to write their whole names and said Jack Young blood on the back.

197
00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:47.100
It never looked right.
It looked fucking weird.
Um,

198
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.660
but anyways,
uh,
I went there and uh,

199
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:56.310
it was the typical la a sporting experience that you,

200
00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:01.270
a lot of times where there's just as many fans,
if not more fans,

201
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:05.200
because it's a transient city.
It really has nothing to do with La fans.

202
00:12:05.201 --> 00:12:09.700
There's just so many people like myself that moved out here,
you know,

203
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:15.460
chasing the old Hollywood dream or have people that just fucking sick of,
um,

204
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.100
you know,
just bad weather.
People are just always fucking moving it,
by the way,

205
00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:24.790
dude,
I'm telling you right now,
dude,
this fucking real estate bubble out here.

206
00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:28.480
I've them building all of these fucking luxury apartment buildings.

207
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.990
You know why I fucking go over and play hockey that they got this thing that the

208
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:36.430
Pickwick,
a hockey thing that's also a bowling alley and a function room.

209
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.860
They fucking knock in that whole thing down,

210
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.920
knocking that whole fucking thing down because they're going to

211
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.260
have luxury apartments.
It says there's going to be no place to skate out here.

212
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.340
The one that was over and fucking was at century city or some shadows get

213
00:12:51.341 --> 00:12:54.640
confused over there.
Begins with this scene.
Ain't cut.
I don't know what it is.

214
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.990
They fucking,
that one's done.
Now this one's gone.
The only one,
the ones I know,

215
00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:02.920
there's one down by the airport and there's one over near and like a near

216
00:13:02.921 --> 00:13:06.570
Sherman Oaks Valley Ice Center.
And other than that,
uh,

217
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.240
I dunno,
I left the fucking go buy some roller blades.
Right?

218
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.260
So little fucking short shorts do that stupid thing.
You know,

219
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:18.220
we set up the cones and you'd come up to him and turn around backwards,
right?

220
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:28.540
Um,
anyways.
Uh,
yeah dude.

221
00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:32.200
So they have a,
so they had this distinct put up,
this fucking one building,
right?

222
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:36.550
And a really impressive building.
It's over near Beverly Hills,

223
00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:38.920
so I was just like,
Oh,
you know,
let's see what that build is about it.

224
00:13:38.921 --> 00:13:43.060
I go on the Internet,
right?
It's called the 10,000 I'm like,
all right,

225
00:13:43.061 --> 00:13:47.500
why is it called the 10th that it's called the 10,000 because that's the amount

226
00:13:47.501 --> 00:13:51.700
of money you have to pay a month to live there because bare minimum,

227
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.930
how fucking tacky.
It's like,
how many times are we going to fucking do this?

228
00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.550
You know what I mean?
It's like we always act.

229
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.640
There's always like some sort of like crash and everybody fucking loses

230
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:08.590
everything and by everybody I mean the fucking lower 99% gets to fucking asses

231
00:14:08.591 --> 00:14:10.750
kicked and then you know,

232
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.420
give it a couple of years and all of a sudden it just comes right back out

233
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.690
around again to the bud.
Fox greed is good dude.

234
00:14:16.691 --> 00:14:18.850
How fucking tacky is that?

235
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.390
The name of the building is the minimal.

236
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.530
This is how much you pay in and rent Jesus Christ.

237
00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:30.430
Have a little bit of fucking class.
Um,

238
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:35.320
yeah,
they're just everywhere.
They're putting up luxury apartments.

239
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.200
I don't know where the fuck they gonna find all these people to,
to uh,

240
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.860
to fill these things.
But I guarantee you they're not going to do it.

241
00:14:41.861 --> 00:14:44.350
Like I was thinking of buying a small apartment building out here,

242
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.910
but everybody's fucking buying them up.

243
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:50.230
I can't even afford to fucking get in one or,
you know,
just cause it's stupid.

244
00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:54.690
It's like at the height of the fucking market,
you know,

245
00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.940
I was thinking to buy like a parking garage or some shit.
Just a parking lot,

246
00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.580
you know.
Fuck.
Are All these people going to park?

247
00:15:00.581 --> 00:15:03.740
It's said building parking underneath the goddamn thinks.
Ah,

248
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.710
they got it all figured out.

249
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:06.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

250
00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.760
<v 0>You know,
I guess I'll be telling jokes for the rest of my fucking life.</v>

251
00:15:08.761 --> 00:15:10.560
I'm trying to have some sort of something,

252
00:15:10.561 --> 00:15:14.760
a lemonade stand or something where I get into my older fucking years.

253
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.720
I got some sort of loop coming in that doesn't have to do with me fucking

254
00:15:18.721 --> 00:15:22.930
putting on my tap dancing shoes.
I don't know.
So anyways,
I went to the,
uh,

255
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:25.080
the,
uh,

256
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.220
Los Angeles Rams game yesterday and it was so great to see them play there even

257
00:15:29.221 --> 00:15:30.750
though they had a fucking brutal game.

258
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:35.300
They were down 42 to nothing to Matty ice and fucking,
uh,

259
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.540
uh,
fucking the rams.
And I,
I mean the,
the,

260
00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:43.770
the Falcons and evidently they're best receiver,
whoever the fuck that is,

261
00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:48.030
Julio Jones or some shit.
I think I heard that name.
I,
is that a baseball player?

262
00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:48.391
I don't know.

263
00:15:48.391 --> 00:15:51.510
I don't play fantasy sports and I'm too fucking busy to really pay attention as

264
00:15:51.511 --> 00:15:52.344
much as I used to.

265
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.140
He wasn't even playing and they just kicked the shit out of him.
You know,

266
00:15:55.141 --> 00:15:57.510
it was funny.
The rams finally scored a touchdown,

267
00:15:57.511 --> 00:16:00.720
right to make it 42 to seven and they lit the Olympic torch.

268
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.060
I'm sure they just light it late at night,

269
00:16:06.061 --> 00:16:08.820
but it seemed like that's when I first noticed that it was odd.

270
00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:13.290
And then they also had a fumble recovery for a touchdown.

271
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.290
The crowd's going nuts.
So whenever that happens live,

272
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.500
the first thing I do is try to pick up a referee to see if I see,

273
00:16:19.501 --> 00:16:22.980
you know him going,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
it's,
it's a dead ball.

274
00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:26.580
Or if he say and touchdown,
and as the guy was crossing the goal line,

275
00:16:26.581 --> 00:16:28.800
you could see the ref was already going.
No,
no,

276
00:16:28.801 --> 00:16:30.780
no pointing at the ground saying it was,
you know,

277
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.910
neither the guy was down or whatever.
Right.
And the fucking fireworks guy,

278
00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:41.360
the fucking fireworks guy shoots the fireworks off on a touchdown that got

279
00:16:41.461 --> 00:16:46.320
called back.
It's fucking hilarious cause they're not selling out games.
You know,

280
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.350
it probably,
I bet that guy got chewed out.

281
00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.250
Fucking owner probably came down his camel hair coat.
You know,

282
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.410
where the fuck is it God to have fireworks go.

283
00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:01.040
Sorry Mister Mister fucking owner.
I have to shut the fuck up,
right?

284
00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.930
It's coming out of your pay down their fucking crying.
Um,

285
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.240
but it was just such a great stadium.
It holds 90,000 people for the life of me.

286
00:17:09.241 --> 00:17:11.100
Can somebody explain to me

287
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:16.790
why the Los Angeles Rams need a new football stadium?

288
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:18.950
There's a football stadium.

289
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:19.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

290
00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:20.760
<v 0>There's two of them.</v>

291
00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:24.990
There's the rose bowl and there's the fucking La Memorial Coliseum.

292
00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:29.880
Why do we have to take more fucking natural resources out of the fucking earth

293
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.100
to build another one of these stupid ass fucking stadiums and that's it.

294
00:17:34.101 --> 00:17:37.680
They get to have luxury boxes and put all the bells and whistles on it.

295
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

296
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:39.101
<v 0>You know,</v>

297
00:17:39.101 --> 00:17:43.300
so they can attract people who aren't into sports to go to the fucking event.

298
00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:47.290
I love that fucking stadium.
I had a great time.
I love that.

299
00:17:47.291 --> 00:17:50.490
It's a so called shit hole.
I think it's great.

300
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:56.360
Do you know that was 62 steps to get from fucking where I was seeding sitting

301
00:17:57.241 --> 00:18:00.900
back up to the main concourse to fucking walk out of the stadium.

302
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:05.610
It's fucking tremendous.
62 steps,
you know,

303
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:10.590
it makes you drink less.
You're burning a bunch of calories,
does less fat fucks,

304
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.290
but now what do they say?
Oh,
that's a fire hazard.

305
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:14.640
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

306
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.470
<v 0>The inclines to Stape and I will get with fucking were so soft in this fucking</v>

307
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:20.010
country.

308
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:23.130
That's why like everybody's trying to get me all freaked out about having a kid

309
00:18:23.131 --> 00:18:24.780
about how difficult it's going to be.

310
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.660
And I'm not saying it's not going to be difficult,
but it's like people,

311
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.200
women used to have kids and then they'd fucking die.

312
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:35.490
And then the fucking guy had to go out,
Barry,

313
00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:38.920
his wife and get behind a team of oxen,
plows,

314
00:18:38.921 --> 00:18:42.750
some rocky God damn field and then fucking,
I don't know,
feed the kid.

315
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.200
I don't go smoke at that point.
I have no idea.
And somehow we did it.

316
00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:48.693
<v 2>You know,</v>

317
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.510
<v 0>people who have survived plagues,</v>

318
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:56.660
I can't fucking be in a house with central air conditioning and heat and all of

319
00:18:57.091 --> 00:19:00.140
this shit.
I,
I,
you know,
I mean,
how much fucking harder is,

320
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:02.221
Oh God,

321
00:19:02.221 --> 00:19:06.270
I wish parents from fucking in the past could come in and listen to the way

322
00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:11.070
people fucking wine and go on and on about themselves,
you know,

323
00:19:11.071 --> 00:19:14.940
and the way they lecture people who don't have kids do you have no idea?

324
00:19:14.941 --> 00:19:17.700
Oh my God,
it's so,
shut the fuck up.

325
00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:23.690
These fucking people coming over,
you know,
compatible it over from Cuba.

326
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:28.640
On a fucking refrigerator door fighting off sharks,
you know,
and you can't hit,

327
00:19:28.641 --> 00:19:32.430
you can't change a couple of diapers.
I'm telling you,
people are fucking pussies.

328
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.690
The fucking soft people are fucking soft.
They,
if they fucking bitch,

329
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:40.620
Moan and complain.
Yes,
yes.
There's things in life,
you know,

330
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.710
I say at this point with all the modern gadgets,

331
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:44.940
<v 2>okay,</v>

332
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.020
<v 0>all right.
If you have a job,</v>

333
00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.920
if you're not worried about money as far as you have enough fucking money to

334
00:19:50.921 --> 00:19:52.810
make your rent in all that stuff,
I mean,

335
00:19:52.811 --> 00:19:57.730
a kid shouldn't be any more difficult considering the love back that you're

336
00:19:57.731 --> 00:19:59.770
going to get other than,
you know,

337
00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:04.630
a major fucking adjustment and something that's inconvenient.
But I mean,
come on.

338
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:09.370
It's difficult.
Yeah.
Compared to the rest of you compared to what?

339
00:20:09.371 --> 00:20:13.380
Sitting down and playing playstation at fucking 38 years of age.
Uh,

340
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.810
I might eat these words,
but I mean,
I'm just comparing it to the fact that,

341
00:20:16.811 --> 00:20:20.930
you know,
people used to live in the fucking middle of nowhere.

342
00:20:20.931 --> 00:20:22.580
They'd have like 14 fucking kids.

343
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.030
I can't handle one.

344
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:27.360
<v 2>Okay.</v>

345
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.600
<v 0>I got all the sports packages.
Right.
I mean what?
Well,</v>

346
00:20:29.601 --> 00:20:31.620
I mean how my fucking life's a joke.
Literally.

347
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.023
<v 2>MMM.</v>

348
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.750
<v 0>Anyways,
I,
I don't know.
Well let's,
let's try to stay on top of it.</v>

349
00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:42.490
I have no fucking idea.
Um,
why they need a new stadium.

350
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.290
It's,
it's uh,
you know,
I can't talk and type in my password.

351
00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:53.720
Amman steak with the pill focus Dow and he does it.
Um,

352
00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.340
anyway,
so we went to the game and uh,

353
00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:01.300
I had a great time and a fucking it Lana fans will like shit,

354
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:04.660
the amount of shit talking dude,
there was this one guy,

355
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.720
this one fucking guy,

356
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.970
he bought those fucking wide receiver gloves,
you know,

357
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.600
where they had the logo with the team and then they cross the hands and they put

358
00:21:16.601 --> 00:21:17.920
their hands up over their heads.
You know,

359
00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:20.770
like when like the fucking franchise player scores a touchdown.

360
00:21:20.771 --> 00:21:24.850
He does that and it looks cool.
He was doing that at the end of the game,

361
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.130
just holding his hands up facing

362
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:33.460
facing the fucking rams fed.
I'm telling you,
dude,

363
00:21:33.461 --> 00:21:37.960
this guy was like 50,
I,
you know,

364
00:21:37.961 --> 00:21:42.550
all wire thin,
you know,
street dude,
right?
50 years old.

365
00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:46.990
And he walked out and he was making,
doing a selfie video is he walked out,

366
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:52.120
you know,
talk it,
all this shit.
It's like,
dude,
you beat the fucking ramps.
I mean,

367
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:57.040
it's fucking relaxed.
You're not beating the giants in at Pete and Seattle.

368
00:21:57.041 --> 00:21:59.980
You're not beating the cowboys,
you know doin shit this year.

369
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.550
Fucking guy running out.
Like they just want to play a game.

370
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:04.660
I don't know what it is about me,

371
00:22:04.661 --> 00:22:09.250
but I fucking hate when the fans from the visiting team take over a stadium.

372
00:22:09.251 --> 00:22:12.290
Even if I don't give a fuck about the team,
I respect the ramp.

373
00:22:12.291 --> 00:22:15.310
So next thing you know,
I'm talking all this shit to rams fan.

374
00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.880
I mean it's a falcons fans in the back of my head.
I'm like,

375
00:22:18.881 --> 00:22:20.650
why are you doing this bill?
You don't give a fuck.

376
00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:26.410
He's just rams fans and inhibiting dig.
They weren't coming with the shit.

377
00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:30.120
Talk back.
They couldn't.
They were down 40 to seven right?

378
00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.760
42 14 I think was the final.
So at one point,
you know,

379
00:22:33.761 --> 00:22:38.350
when they went up 42 to nothing,
all these Falcon fans,
they start chanting a t,

380
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:41.860
l a t,
e l,
a,
t,
l,

381
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:46.240
and I just started yelling,
you're a hub city.

382
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.390
No one goes to Atlanta.

383
00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.820
We pass through your city onto our final destination.

384
00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.430
Started yelling all this shit about Delta Airlines.

385
00:23:00.431 --> 00:23:03.020
I believe that that's the hub there.
Uh,

386
00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.790
and afterwards I just started thinking,
why do I care?
Oh.

387
00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:10.060
And then I also screamed at the fucking Atlanta is punter.

388
00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:14.250
He fucking punted the ball and this guy had a nice run back and he'd get,

389
00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.150
comes off the field.
Now,
granted,

390
00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.820
he could have been mad that he kicked it to the wrong guy,

391
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.320
or he's supposed to kick it away.

392
00:23:20.321 --> 00:23:24.490
But he came off the field and he did the double fucking pulling the Chin straps

393
00:23:24.491 --> 00:23:28.480
off.
And he was like,
fuck.
He screaming all this shit.

394
00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:32.800
He was all upset.
I fucking went off on him.

395
00:23:32.801 --> 00:23:34.420
I don't even remember what the fuck I said.

396
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:38.680
I was just so beside myself that a punter would talk.
That level is just,

397
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:40.210
they just sit the fuck down.

398
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:45.770
Have they watched your uniform once this year?
Fucking dope.

399
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.780
You closer to sitting in the stands,
then you are actually being on that fucking,

400
00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:52.190
do you know what I mean?
You don't,
it'd be like,

401
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.560
it'd be like if this guy was in the army and he's,

402
00:23:54.561 --> 00:23:58.520
he like peels potatoes and he's talking shit cause he cut his finger or

403
00:23:58.521 --> 00:23:59.360
something like that.

404
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.210
And meanwhile he's sitting around a bunch of people that just came back from the

405
00:24:02.211 --> 00:24:05.660
front lines.
That's how I look at it.
I mean,
I might be a content,
I have no idea.

406
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.240
So anyways,
when I was sitting there watching the rams game,
um,

407
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:14.830
I mentioned to my buddy that,
uh,
how they used to be a,
uh,

408
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.540
a football stadium.
I couldn't remember the name of it.

409
00:24:17.541 --> 00:24:20.600
I first I said the bigger bowl and I was like,
I think that might be in Philly.

410
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.310
Um,
but there was a,
there was a stadium for anybody who lives out here in la.

411
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:29.120
A lot of people,
you know,
La is really bad about their history.

412
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.370
And,
um,
they had a stadium,
uh,

413
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:39.530
that was down where the farmers market is on Fairfax and Beverly.

414
00:24:39.531 --> 00:24:42.770
It was actually a baseball stadium there too.
I don't know anything about that.

415
00:24:42.771 --> 00:24:47.240
But they had a stadium called the Gilmore Stadium called Gilmore Stadium.

416
00:24:47.241 --> 00:24:50.030
And they had a couple of NFL,
like all star Games there.

417
00:24:50.031 --> 00:24:52.040
And then they had like some defunct football lead,

418
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:56.150
like the La bulldogs or some shit played there.
I look,
looked it up on Wikipedia,

419
00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:01.460
um,
early this morning and I couldn't,
uh,
couldn't sleep that well.

420
00:25:01.461 --> 00:25:02.300
A little heartbroken.

421
00:25:02.301 --> 00:25:07.301
Billy here couldn't sleep last night and I'm doing the baseball field that was

422
00:25:07.521 --> 00:25:10.670
next to it.
If you ever watched those classic,
um,

423
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:16.510
home run derbies well they have like Al Kayline versus like Mickey Mantle and

424
00:25:16.731 --> 00:25:20.150
Shit and you know,
they're in La and you're like,
where the fuck is that stadium?

425
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.690
Um,
they filmed a lot of it at the stadium right next to it.

426
00:25:23.691 --> 00:25:26.940
And right now there's like the cvs lot there where they film like the prices

427
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.080
right and shit.
And as I was looking that up,
I didn't know this.

428
00:25:30.081 --> 00:25:34.670
They actually had a Wrigley field in La that looks like from the map,

429
00:25:34.671 --> 00:25:38.060
it was near or north of Watts,
la,

430
00:25:38.061 --> 00:25:42.920
which is south of the 10 in east of the one 10 and it was built by the same guy

431
00:25:42.921 --> 00:25:47.300
that made Wrigley Field in Chicago and Kaminski field.
I'm a fucking nerd.

432
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.870
I like looking up that shit.
I looked up shit about the rams.

433
00:25:50.871 --> 00:25:53.660
They've won one Superbowl.
They want it in Saint Louis,

434
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.930
obviously 1999 people will remember that.

435
00:25:56.931 --> 00:26:01.931
And they want an NFL title in 1945 when they were still in Cleveland,

436
00:26:02.481 --> 00:26:05.150
which is where they started.
So,
um,

437
00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.720
they've never won an NFL title or a fucking Superbowl here in la.

438
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.370
And I got to tell you,
I have to watch him yesterday.

439
00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:15.010
They don't seem like they're that much closer.

440
00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.960
Fucking Jeff Fischer taken all kinds of shit,

441
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.320
all kinds of shit.
Um,

442
00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.180
they need to fire and they need to fire his ass.
All right,
well who do you think?

443
00:26:26.181 --> 00:26:29.510
Who else has we're going to replace them with?
You've got to have a replacement.

444
00:26:29.511 --> 00:26:31.460
I mean,
this guy has been in the fucking league forever.

445
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.750
Did take a team to the Superbowl.
However,
it was fucking 17 years ago.

446
00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:40.280
He did well with Vince Young,
you know,
but in defense of him,

447
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:42.560
you know,
if you look at the last,

448
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.890
since the Patriot started going to the Superbowl,
okay,

449
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:51.450
the Patriots have gone to six fucking super bowls.
All right.

450
00:26:51.451 --> 00:26:55.770
And then as far as winning patriots have one four Steelers won,

451
00:26:55.771 --> 00:26:59.990
two giants want to
packers?
One.
Why?

452
00:26:59.991 --> 00:27:02.250
I mean it's like literally like every fucking decade.

453
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.910
There's like two or three teams that just fucking run the table and the fucking

454
00:27:05.911 --> 00:27:09.840
nineties it was a cowboys won three Broncos,
one,
two.

455
00:27:09.841 --> 00:27:12.450
There's half the super bowl's a fucking gone right there.

456
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:17.570
And he knew the 49 is we're going to get one and they want for the previous

457
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:23.150
decade,
there's just always that Steelers won four in.
Um,

458
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:28.520
let's look at the eighties the eighties it was a 49 is one for the Raiders.

459
00:27:28.651 --> 00:27:31.380
One,
two,
that's six gone right there.

460
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.760
Giants won one.
Redskins won one

461
00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:42.300
Redskins,
one,
two.
All right,
so that's four,
two and two.

462
00:27:42.301 --> 00:27:44.280
You got three teams that won eight of the 10,

463
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.970
and then it was the bears and whoever the fuck else I just said,

464
00:27:47.971 --> 00:27:52.770
I can't remember.
Um,
one,
the other one.
Uh,

465
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.030
wait a minute.
Where does it go?

466
00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:59.690
It goes Raiders 40 niners Redskins,

467
00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:03.960
Raiders 40 niners bears,

468
00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.140
giants Redskins 49.
It's 49 oh giant together.
One's giants and bears want one?

469
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:14.590
All right.
I'm sorry,
I'm getting all fucking nerded out here with the,
uh,

470
00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.660
with the fucking sports talk here.
Um,

471
00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.660
which I'll probably do a little bit more of,
but,
um,

472
00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.250
I probably should do some advertising here,

473
00:28:21.251 --> 00:28:24.880
but I wanted to talk to you guys about some shit where I'm,

474
00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.780
I told you I've been starting to get my phone someone,
you know,

475
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:33.030
when I fucked up my backlash or this year with the side nerd thing,
say,
hey,

476
00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:34.180
right,

477
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.420
I went through all of that shit through that I find a great crack chiropractor

478
00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:39.040
and then a great misuse,

479
00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.400
which has led me to this other person that I just went to ooze.
Um,

480
00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:48.050
you know,
a former like mister universe,
bodybuilder and all that,

481
00:28:48.051 --> 00:28:50.280
and he's a fucking genius.
And everything.
And uh,

482
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.300
I went to go see this guy because,
uh,

483
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:55.970
I fucked up my rotator cuff up like years ago.

484
00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:59.060
I've been trying to just fight through it and all that type of shit.

485
00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:04.090
And I finally went to go see this guy and like I came walking in and you know,

486
00:29:04.161 --> 00:29:07.940
those bodybuilders,
they spend their lives just looking in the mirror,
you know,

487
00:29:07.941 --> 00:29:12.590
with fucking clothes on.
He just saw all of my shit.
It was it.
He just went like,

488
00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:16.640
I,
you shoulders a rotated forward.
You left.

489
00:29:16.641 --> 00:29:19.670
One is actually closer to your neck than your right one is.

490
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.270
And then he goes and he goes,
stand in the mirror.
You see that?

491
00:29:23.271 --> 00:29:26.030
Did I brush my teeth every fucking twice a day,
right?
Two,

492
00:29:26.031 --> 00:29:30.080
three times a fucking day.
I've never noticed that.
My Holy Shit,
he's right.

493
00:29:30.081 --> 00:29:34.550
Cause it's rotated in and turned just ever so slightly.

494
00:29:34.551 --> 00:29:36.410
It's not like it's like a fucking three inches,

495
00:29:36.411 --> 00:29:41.150
but you really have to look at it.
And then he goes,
all right,
do me a favor,

496
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.360
turn your head to the left and turn it to the right.

497
00:29:43.361 --> 00:29:47.920
And then he just started smiling cause he knew what my fucking issue was.
Um,

498
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:51.070
whatever your net neck muscle is,

499
00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:56.850
my chest in my trap muscles are too fucking tight and you trap easy muscle,

500
00:29:57.791 --> 00:30:00.010
whatever it is,
it goes all the way down to the middle of your back.

501
00:30:00.011 --> 00:30:04.360
But mine is super tight up top and my chest is tight.

502
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:08.680
So it's pulling everything forward and it's making my shoulders go up.

503
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.240
Like my shoulder's always go up like so he gave me this fucking stretch.

504
00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.990
Um,
even if you don't have this fucking problem,
I got to tell,

505
00:30:16.991 --> 00:30:20.560
hopefully I can describe it over the podcast here.

506
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:22.780
It's just stand up straight,
right?

507
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:27.460
And then just lift your chest up,
put your shoulders back,

508
00:30:27.461 --> 00:30:30.040
put your fucking shoulders back,
lift your chest up,

509
00:30:30.041 --> 00:30:31.990
like to like you feel like you're trying to make it.

510
00:30:31.991 --> 00:30:36.280
Go to the ceiling and then have your hands,
your arms.

511
00:30:36.281 --> 00:30:41.260
Bring your arms back behind you,
palms up and stretch back as far as you can.

512
00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:42.070
All right,

513
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:45.280
like it totally opened up the chest as you bring your arms back and try to hold

514
00:30:45.281 --> 00:30:50.140
that for a minute.
Um,
it's been a complete game changer now.

515
00:30:50.141 --> 00:30:52.560
So like my shoulders have come down cause I didn't want to my suits,

516
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:57.690
she beat the fuck out of my neck and my shoulders are fucking down a little bit

517
00:30:58.241 --> 00:31:02.950
more.
But like,
I swear to God when I used to do like a yoga stretches,

518
00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.460
like on one side I could totally like,
you know,

519
00:31:06.461 --> 00:31:09.220
they always make reach around and grab your arm or whatever that Yoga Shit,

520
00:31:09.221 --> 00:31:12.820
I can totally do it on one side,
could not do it on the other side.

521
00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:16.060
And I'm for my whole life,
like I've had this fucking problem,

522
00:31:16.061 --> 00:31:19.000
like one shoulder being higher than the other forever,
you know,

523
00:31:19.001 --> 00:31:21.010
in some nurse when I was at high school goes,

524
00:31:21.011 --> 00:31:22.750
oh you got a little bit of scoliosis.
Yeah,

525
00:31:22.751 --> 00:31:27.751
your spines a little curved and Blahblahblahblahblah and like this fucking who

526
00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.970
and I know that the fuck she was.
I was just like,
yeah,
that's the problem.

527
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:35.950
And it wasn't.
So I talked to this guy who was just going like,
oh yeah,
he goes,

528
00:31:35.951 --> 00:31:40.660
I'll have you fucking straightened out in like a month or something.
And,
uh,

529
00:31:40.661 --> 00:31:45.280
so he gave me these exercises to strengthen up the lower part of the trap,
easy,

530
00:31:45.281 --> 00:31:47.110
whatever.
And for the first time in my life,

531
00:31:47.111 --> 00:31:51.660
I'm going to be actually be able to sit up straight just naturally.
And um,

532
00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:54.130
it,
the amount of shit that it is affected,

533
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.610
it's given me back problems like playing drums and stuff.

534
00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:02.610
Like I forever having to like adjust shit and wondering why when like I sit down

535
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.460
like why I have to bring the snare higher than I should have to bring it,

536
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:11.350
you know?
And everybody else would just sit down and be,

537
00:32:11.351 --> 00:32:12.460
now it seems pretty normal to me.

538
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:17.320
I had no fucking idea what the deal was that evidently I was all crooked up top.

539
00:32:17.321 --> 00:32:21.050
So,
um,
I got to tell you,
that's something that I've learned this year.
We're in.

540
00:32:21.051 --> 00:32:24.190
The biggest things I've learned this year,
um,

541
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.920
is
like how medicine,

542
00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.860
if you go to a shoulder doctor,
he's just going to fucking look at your shoulder.

543
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.140
You know what I mean?
You got to get back doc.

544
00:32:35.141 --> 00:32:37.380
He's just looking at you fucking back.
But you got to these,

545
00:32:37.381 --> 00:32:38.890
these decent susis and people like that.

546
00:32:38.891 --> 00:32:42.740
They understand how the whole fucking body works and they understand like,
oh,

547
00:32:42.741 --> 00:32:44.120
this is pulled out of alignment.

548
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:50.590
It always comes down to balance where it's like these muscles are too tight and

549
00:32:51.081 --> 00:32:52.970
the muscles on the other side a two weeks.

550
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:55.520
So this is either pulling this forward or pulling this back,

551
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.730
which is causing you to compensate when you walk.
And that's like,

552
00:32:58.731 --> 00:33:01.730
you literally have a problem with you if you left foot because of your right

553
00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:06.020
shoulder.
It's fucking amazing.
If you get a good one.
All right,

554
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.740
you go to some rug,
Robin tug place.
She's still going to have a crooked back,

555
00:33:09.741 --> 00:33:13.640
but oh,
you're going to walk out with a smile on your face.
Sorry.

556
00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.080
Um,
all right.
I know.
I haven't been this too funny.
All right,

557
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:21.430
I'm going through a lot of shit here.
All right,
let me,
uh,
let me read the,
um,

558
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.920
let me read the,
uh,
the advertising here for this week.
Okay.

00:33:46.671 --> 00:33:50.090
You know what the reality is?
All you need is shampoo.
Shampoo's still soap.

565
00:33:50.091 --> 00:33:53.360
If you want,
show self a shampoo,
all of these different types of fucking,

566
00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:55.370
you know,
why did you try,

567
00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:59.600
did you pay it back in the day you sat in a fucking tub?
You know,

568
00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.770
they didn't have any soap that they,

569
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.250
and like kill a fucking go to some shit and I don't know.

570
00:34:07.251 --> 00:34:09.620
I don't know how to turn the grease and just a power soap.

571
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:14.610
How often would you do?
I don't fucking know.
You jumped in a river.
Uh,

572
00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:18.560
they just came out with a new line of shower products,
shampoo and body wash,

573
00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:22.460
shampoo and body wash called the wanderer.

574
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:25.010
I love this shampoo and body wash and one perfect.

575
00:34:25.011 --> 00:34:27.230
The fragrances are unlike anything on the market.

576
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:31.220
There's subtle and actually smell like real natural ingredients.

577
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:36.210
There are a lot of body washes out there.
They make you smell like a teenager.
Um,

578
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.990
why don't know what a teenager smells like.
And I think that's a good thing.

579
00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:42.820
It keeps me off.
A lot of watch lists,
lists,
lists.
Uh,

580
00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:47.180
this mint and Cedar Wood bodywash is amazing and makes you smell incredible.

581
00:34:47.181 --> 00:34:51.830
Evidently that is all one flavor.
Somebody sent it to me.

582
00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:55.130
Uh,
you got to give it a try.

if you're wondering why you have to buy another full grown fucking adult,

Maybe they'll even fuck you.

595
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.670
Who knows what they're thinking?
I don't pretend to know.
All right.

<v 0>everybody.
You know what?</v>

627
00:37:31.221 --> 00:37:35.750
I saw some middle aged white lady with the Wu Tang clan Christmas sweater.

628
00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:38.180
I think that sets the bar.

629
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:43.190
It was the classic Christmas sweater pattern with the Wu Tang Wu on the front,

630
00:37:43.191 --> 00:37:44.840
and it was black and yellow,
right?

631
00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:49.220
Didn't they use to say killer bees or some shit like that?
I Dunno.
All right.

632
00:37:49.221 --> 00:37:52.700
Tipsy elves.
Everyone needs an ugly Christmas sweater this time of year.

636
00:38:02.481 --> 00:38:04.360
Well,

I didn't look at him.
You know what?
You know what?

637
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:08.240
I'm going to do that this week.
I'll do that this week.
What the fuck?
Here we go.

638
00:38:08.241 --> 00:38:12.710
Tipsy elves.
So I can talk about your fucking sweaters.

639
00:38:12.711 --> 00:38:15.830
Tipsy elves.
Here we go.
What do they got?

640
00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.573
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

641
00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.940
<v 0>Oh,
Jesus Christ.
Those things are fucking hideous.</v>

642
00:38:19.941 --> 00:38:23.540
They got Jesus Christ like it's a baby,

643
00:38:23.541 --> 00:38:28.450
but he still has the beard in one of those things.
One of those things,
you know,

644
00:38:28.451 --> 00:38:31.570
you carry a baby and around front a Satchel,

645
00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:36.010
you know they got Santa Claus on a Unicorn.
Yeah,

646
00:38:36.011 --> 00:38:38.740
this is ugly as shit.
Men's Christmas suits.

647
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:42.700
I guess that's if you want to get on TV at a sporting event,

648
00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:47.550
um,
oh my God,
dude,

649
00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:52.240
I can't even fucking read.
What does it say?

650
00:38:52.241 --> 00:38:57.240
Belt digger.
I thought it said the n word.

651
00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:00.330
That's when I first saw it,
saw it,
and then I thought I'd said Gold digger.

652
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:04.140
And you know what?
Why don't I get off this site?
Uh,
you miss,

653
00:39:04.141 --> 00:39:07.680
you drink birthday boy,
and it's got Jesus Christ.

654
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:10.440
All right.
You know what these people went.

655
00:39:10.441 --> 00:39:13.800
They got the most fucked up looking shit I've ever seen.
Um,

656
00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.920
everyone needs whatever.
Tipsy elves has hundreds of Christmas sweaty.

657
00:39:16.921 --> 00:39:21.540
I just talked about this shit.
You get what they are.
You know what they are?

658
00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:22.680

668
00:39:58.651 --> 00:40:02.190
No one's going to get upset.
Right.
Anyways,

669
00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.280
I've been hanging with my wife.
You don't barely doing any standup,

670
00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:08.580
just sitting there waiting for the kid to come and a poor thing.

671
00:40:08.581 --> 00:40:11.850
She's all really uncomfortable.
She's at the point,
she's been such a trooper.

672
00:40:11.851 --> 00:40:14.820
She's at the point now she's just like,
let's get this kid out of me.
Right.

673
00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:20.310
And a last name.
It was the first time I saw him kick through this fucking kick,

674
00:40:20.311 --> 00:40:23.990
like a,
I do these exercises.
You know what?

675
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000
I have to help me and do these exercises that she can try to stay limber and I

676
00:40:29.461 --> 00:40:31.350
just saw it like it was literally like,

677
00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:35.970
it was like a foot just fucking kicked aside.
It was just like,
it's insane.

678
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.640
It's insane that there's a God damn kid near.

679
00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:40.590
It's the most amazing fucking thing.
And also like,
yeah,

680
00:40:40.591 --> 00:40:43.680
just say to your wife like I,
there's no way for them to convey it to you.

681
00:40:43.681 --> 00:40:47.160
It's like,
what is it like to have a person in you

682
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.760
living inside of you?
It's like,
can you watch alien now and just be like,

683
00:40:53.761 --> 00:40:55.920
I get it.
I totally fucking get it.

684
00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:01.530
So anyways,
uh,
I hung up with her one night,

685
00:41:01.531 --> 00:41:05.520
right?
And we watch Rudolph the red nose reindeer.

686
00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:11.430
Then we watched a frosty the snowman as much as I could watch,

687
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.310
you know,
I don't get into frosty the snowman.

688
00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:18.450
It's too fucking it.
That one just gives me anxiety.

689
00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:22.890
You watch Rudolph the red nose reindeer and it's slightly about racism and

690
00:41:22.891 --> 00:41:24.510
acceptance,
you know what I mean?

691
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.320
His own dad is ashamed of him and then he tells him to fuck off.

692
00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.850
And then there's all the misfit toys.

693
00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:33.120
There's something going on there that's like this theme,

694
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:36.290
racism and special needs kids.
I don't really,

695
00:41:36.291 --> 00:41:40.610
there's just so many fucking other things going on that it's really fucking sad.

696
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:44.810
And you watch it and it's 50 years old and you realize so much hasn't changed.

697
00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:48.880
And then if you go right into frosty the fucking snowman and then his,

698
00:41:48.881 --> 00:41:52.250
this adult that's going to get on a fucking Choo Choo train with some little

699
00:41:52.251 --> 00:41:52.621
girl,

700
00:41:52.621 --> 00:41:56.210
she doesn't tell her parents she's fucking leave leaving and then there's the

701
00:41:56.211 --> 00:41:59.750
fucking stress that it's going to melt.
I was just like,
you know what?

702
00:41:59.751 --> 00:42:01.490
You got to shut that.
I can't handle this.
Right.

703
00:42:01.491 --> 00:42:05.330
I can't fucking handle this is giving me too much anxiety.
Right?
And uh,

704
00:42:05.331 --> 00:42:08.360
so then we switched over and we watched a little bit of Mary Poppins,

705
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:13.280
which I haven't seen in a long time,
but I get all of those movies confused.

706
00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:14.451
You know,

707
00:42:14.451 --> 00:42:19.451
the supercalifragilisticexpialidocious at that one Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

708
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:22.490
It's always some fucking old guy,

709
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:27.290
rich guy whose wife died and now the new hot piece of ass comes in and she shows

710
00:42:27.291 --> 00:42:29.270
them how to fucking loosen up.
You know what I mean?

711
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:33.830
That role has now been taken over by African Americans,
right?

712
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:37.220
They come in and they teach the uptight white dude how to fucking,
I dunno,

713
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:40.970
do the electric slide.
I never watched those fucking movies,
you know?

714
00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.350
But back in the day,
it was a,
it was a new fucking like chicken the guy's life,

715
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.280
but this one,
he was like married,
but it was Dick Van Dyke.

716
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:53.510
You know I saying it,
Jim.
Jim.
Hm Hm hm hm.

717
00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:57.830
Joe Rowe,
they'll lifer of,
of a fucking sweet bird.

718
00:42:57.831 --> 00:43:01.640
That's what I want to do.
Right.
They need,
they're all fucking happy as hell,

719
00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:05.420
you know,
completely romancing blue collar work.

720
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.210
Like rich people are all fucking miserable and these people who are just going

721
00:43:08.211 --> 00:43:13.211
to die at 39 fucking miner's lung or somehow dancing around up on the roofs,

722
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.300
you know,
covered in fucking sought.

723
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:20.720
And I got through as much as that as I could get through.
And uh,
you know,

724
00:43:20.721 --> 00:43:23.510
I bought a Christmas tree and I did all the dishes.

725
00:43:23.511 --> 00:43:27.430
I watched all of that shit and like,
you know what,

726
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.510
the next morning I was going to the rams game.

727
00:43:29.511 --> 00:43:33.350
So everything that I did in the last 24 hours,

728
00:43:33.351 --> 00:43:37.070
it's just completely wiped out.
It's fucking unbelievable.

729
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:41.960
But that's how it works,
man.
That's how it fucking works.
Um,

730
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:46.490
so anyways,
um,
oh,
here's something that I did not mention as,

731
00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.730
uh,
this is something you have to do as a man,

732
00:43:49.731 --> 00:43:51.830
especially if you have a wife and a family.

733
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:55.490
You got to get life insurance and I'm doing it this fucking week.
I just,

734
00:43:55.491 --> 00:43:59.930
you know,
lost another friend who didn't fucking have it.
And,
uh,
you just,

735
00:43:59.931 --> 00:44:03.650
you have to fucking do it guys.
We don't like dealing with our fucking mortality.

736
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:08.180
I know you've watched enough of the first 48 that you're literally giving your

737
00:44:08.181 --> 00:44:12.470
wife a motivation to fucking take you out.
You know what I mean?
Um,

738
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:16.550
but she got to do it.
You got to fucking do it.
So I'm doing that.

739
00:44:16.551 --> 00:44:21.380
This week has been a brutal fucking week.
This week I learned about loss,

740
00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:24.780
you know,
like I didn't already have enough fucking examples.

741
00:44:24.781 --> 00:44:29.150
I got the old fucking right there,
Fred,
this week.
Um,
anyways,

742
00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:33.270
plowing ahead.
Um,
how about the fucking giants?

743
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:37.470
How fucking amazing or the New York football giants every fucking year I've been

744
00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:38.310
saying it all year.

745
00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:43.200
Eli Manning his board in September and October and then,
oh wait,

746
00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:45.090
we got to fucking win some games here.
He just,

747
00:44:45.091 --> 00:44:48.540
the guy just comes to fucking life.
They beat the fucking cowboys again.

748
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:52.980
They got this amazing fucking defense.
This is,

749
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.230
this is what I'm so jealous of as a patriots fan.

750
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:59.820
I don't fucking get how I was first we're going like,

751
00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:04.890
why do we always have to get rid of our guys that are getting becoming stars

752
00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.090
this year?
Chandler Jones,
we got rid of and a,

753
00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:11.720
what's his face we sent over to the fucking browns,
you know,

754
00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:16.280
always for the same shit.
A fucking second round draft pick.
You know,

755
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:17.940
we got rid of Chandler Jones and a,

756
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.600
what was he gonna fucking guys name from fucking Florida University and
whatever.

757
00:45:21.601 --> 00:45:25.020
I,
I'm [inaudible] guys,
I'm so fucking busy with my wife right now.

758
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:27.500
You know who the fuck shoe right now,
but it's just like,

759
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:32.540
what I hate about the fucking patriots speaking of balance is we have all our

760
00:45:32.701 --> 00:45:34.830
money on the offensive side of the ball.

761
00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:39.810
All our stars are on the offensive fucking side and we're forever getting rid of

762
00:45:39.811 --> 00:45:41.250
these fucking cornerbacks.

763
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:45.540
Why won't we pay a fucking corner back all the way back to Thai law lawyer

764
00:45:45.541 --> 00:45:49.290
Malloy.
We just constantly get rid of those fucking guys.

765
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:51.910
You know,
you watch,
we've got,

766
00:45:51.911 --> 00:45:56.010
we'll get rid of that fucking kid who pygmy that pick in the fucking super bowl

767
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:58.540
in Seattle.
We'll fucking get rid of him when he wants a contract.

768
00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:00.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

769
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:04.360
<v 0>I don't,
I don't fucking get it.
Bronx paid.</v>

770
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:06.550
Brady's paid.
I mad.

771
00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:11.200
Imagine Adelman is going to get paid if he's not paid already and then nobody on

772
00:46:11.201 --> 00:46:15.460
the other side of the fucking ball.
It seems like whenever that,
whenever they do,

773
00:46:15.461 --> 00:46:16.330
whenever they're fucked,

774
00:46:16.331 --> 00:46:20.470
defense wins fucking championships and we fucking a forever doing this.

775
00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:21.730
You watched tonight.

776
00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:26.140
How many points is Tom Brady going to have to put up on the fucking scoreboard

777
00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.220
to beat the ravens who always have a good defense?
I fucking love the ravens.

778
00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:34.570
I love the giants.
I love the Steelers.
I love those fucking teams that just,

779
00:46:34.571 --> 00:46:36.670
they always have a great fucking defense.

780
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:42.520
What kills me about the giants as they got this fucking killer defense and they

781
00:46:42.521 --> 00:46:47.320
still have Eli.
They got fucking,
what's his face there?
Who you know,

782
00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.320
Jesus Christ,
what a fucking diva he is.
Even when he's not on the field,

783
00:46:50.321 --> 00:46:52.990
he's got to be like,
you know,
trying to get the crowd going.

784
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:57.160
Like they're not into the game.
I fucking hate that shit.
You know Dell,
Becca,

785
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:59.950
it's like we get it.
We get it.
You're a superstar.

786
00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:03.370
It's not enough that you'd had a one headed 90 yard fucking catch.

787
00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:07.750
Now you gotta be sitting there fucking up on the Goddamn say it stands doing the

788
00:47:07.751 --> 00:47:09.970
Ymc a dance with the fucking crowd.

789
00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:15.460
Literally like the defense is out there shutting down the Dallas cowboys and the

790
00:47:15.461 --> 00:47:16.780
fucking cameras on you.

791
00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:20.140
Cause you're fucking do with Christmas carols with the fucking front section.

792
00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:23.170
That drives me up the wall.
Right?
They got him,
they got,

793
00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:27.550
they still have enough money for that fucking do crews.
It's,
it's,

794
00:47:27.551 --> 00:47:28.384
it's amazing.

795
00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:33.540
But somehow bill Bellacheck trades these fucking guys and gets like three or

796
00:47:35.051 --> 00:47:39.940
four second round draft picks,
then eventually mature into these stars.

797
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.940
And then we went and title and then it's like,

798
00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.940
then they want their money and then we fucking get rid of him again.

799
00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:50.980
So believe in it.
Not as much as the Patriots are

800
00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:56.400
looked upon as a number one or number two seed maybe behind the Raiders.
I Dunno,

801
00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:00.250
I haven't watched the last couple of weeks.
I know the Broncos lost,

802
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:02.950
um,
I dunno how it fucking works,

803
00:48:02.951 --> 00:48:07.120
but you got to think that we're one of the favorites right to go to yet another

804
00:48:07.121 --> 00:48:11.740
fucking Superbowl.
But,
um,
this is actually a rebuilding year for us.

805
00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.800
That's how great bill Belicheck is.
But,
um,

806
00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:17.830
I think we're patriots lose tonight unless we split.
We got to put up like,

807
00:48:17.831 --> 00:48:22.360
I would say like 38 points cause Joe Flacco is no fucking slouch.

808
00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:27.340
Um,
I dunno,
I just don't have any fucking faith in it.

809
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.610
And I don't think that the Patriots' defense stinks.

810
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.390
I just think every fucking year they're good guys.
You know,
one or two guys,

811
00:48:34.391 --> 00:48:38.130
it seems,
get seal fucking heave Ho.
Um,

812
00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.760
you know what the Patriots are really good at.

813
00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:44.440
We're really good at finding that fucking white dude who for no fucking reason

814
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:49.090
is fucking really fast.
The Westworld Chris,
right?

815
00:48:49.091 --> 00:48:52.630
The elements,
the M and dollars,
we,
that's what the fuck we are good at.

816
00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:54.300
And um,

817
00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:59.500
the giants are great at finding fucking those guys that are built like our,

818
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.930
as fast as a linebacker,
but just for some,

819
00:49:01.931 --> 00:49:05.080
some somehow or the size of a defensive end,

820
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.480
they get all of those fucking guys,

821
00:49:07.481 --> 00:49:11.650
they spot them a mile away somehow we can't find them,
you know,

822
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:17.630
and I think the Ravens in the,
uh,
Steelers,
they,

823
00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:22.180
they're really good at just getting those hall of fame fucking defensive backs

824
00:49:22.181 --> 00:49:26.980
in linebackers.
Ed reads,
Ray Lewis,
fucking Steelers,

825
00:49:26.981 --> 00:49:30.790
you can name like 50 Goddamn fucking people right from the fucking steel curtain

826
00:49:30.791 --> 00:49:34.870
all the way up to a Paulo Malo.
They just stayed that enough.
They took,

827
00:49:34.871 --> 00:49:39.190
they just fucking good at it.
So,
um,
having said that,

828
00:49:39.191 --> 00:49:41.650
I've been also watching my Bruins.
Um,

829
00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:46.360
I'm still trying to see where,
where we're working towards.

830
00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:51.670
When we sent the entire Stanley Cup winning team,
gave,
you know,

831
00:49:51.671 --> 00:49:56.671
over the course of two and a half seasons sent every significant player from

832
00:49:57.461 --> 00:50:00.440
those teams out the door except for Chara and a

833
00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:05.140
Marshawn and Burgi.
I don't know.

834
00:50:05.141 --> 00:50:07.900
I don't see where a year and a half end of this shit.
I don't,

835
00:50:07.901 --> 00:50:09.540
we're still a fucking eighth seed.

836
00:50:09.541 --> 00:50:12.310
This is ray where we were last year and I swear to God,

837
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:16.390
if they make our coach take the fall for this.
All right,

838
00:50:16.391 --> 00:50:20.350
we better keep him and at the end we feel if we think that this doesn't work
out.

839
00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:25.420
All right.
You definitely keep a close Julian.
You definitely keep cam Neely.

840
00:50:25.421 --> 00:50:30.230
But uh,
Michael carnals got fucking go cause he's the guy on me.
As far as I know.

841
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:33.260
He's the guy that fucking did all this.
I don't know.
You know what?

842
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:38.120
The fucking Bruins never want to pay anybody.
Unfucking believable

843
00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:42.020
to pass in our case,
18 fucking goals,
right?

844
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:45.470
I watched some of the Toronto game yesterday.
I know we lost three to one.

845
00:50:45.471 --> 00:50:50.360
I don't know who scored.
I missed that part.
And,
uh,
he's got 18 fucking goals.

846
00:50:50.361 --> 00:50:53.620
Can imagine if Sagan was there,
we would have,
we'd have to fucking lines.

847
00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:57.560
At least we admit we fucked up when we got rid of sake and,
but whatever.

848
00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:58.401
But you know,
something,

849
00:50:58.401 --> 00:51:01.430
the Celtics and look and go to Al Horford is the fucking real deal.

850
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:04.700
And I think he's a fucking leader.
I think he's got,
he,

851
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:09.230
he's like a fucking superstar and he's not a fucking headcase.

852
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:13.340
I'm loving that guy.
You know,
we got Isaiah Thomas,
we got to a point guard.

853
00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:16.670
We got a guy down low.
We actually can fucking pass the ball,

854
00:51:16.671 --> 00:51:19.880
but he's brought the ball up the court as much as everybody's freaking out about

855
00:51:19.881 --> 00:51:22.570
what the Greek freak there,
the bucks is a bunch of guys.

856
00:51:22.571 --> 00:51:25.100
Six foot 11 could do that.
I'm a fucking Lebron James.

857
00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:28.160
He's been doing everything that that guy does just because he doesn't play the

858
00:51:28.161 --> 00:51:31.760
point guard position.
Everybody's fucking freaking out.
But that guy is amazing.

859
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:35.630
All right.
But,
uh,
I dunno.

860
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:41.030
I'm loving what Danny agents is doing.
And,
uh,
I think what we're one guy away,

861
00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:42.580
I don't know much about who,

862
00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:46.490
whoever that middle guy is between your number one and your number five,

863
00:51:46.491 --> 00:51:49.040
the power forward.
I don't know what the fuck we need a tow or three.

864
00:51:49.041 --> 00:51:52.670
I don't know what the fuck it is,
but uh,
if we could just have another guy,

865
00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:56.360
a bench,
we play great fucking defense.
I don't know.

866
00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:01.310
I benches a little suspect of right Kelly Olynyk comes in and out of the fucking

867
00:52:01.311 --> 00:52:02.720
guy who can't,
I swear to God,

868
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:06.590
I think I could literally beat this guy taking foul shots.

869
00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.260
Just one of them.
He's the one to like,
was it smart?

870
00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:12.740
The guy with the fucking blonde hair?
Um,
anyway,
so let's,
uh,

871
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:15.230
let's get to some of the questions here for this fucking week here.

872
00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:20.090
I've got to wrap this up too,
because the people putting the punch list,

873
00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:23.480
guys are coming back to put the finishing touches on the kitchen.
Oh,
by the way,

874
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:26.060
you know,
this is free advertising

875
00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:31.850
and a Campfire Cook trop top grill.
You gotta get one dude.

876
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:36.290
I got one in my backyard.
My wife was fighting me on that thing.
I finally,

877
00:52:36.291 --> 00:52:38.090
I shut her the F up.

878
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:43.070
I went out and I made she steak and cheese is one of her favorite fucking

879
00:52:43.071 --> 00:52:45.800
sandwiches.
I went out there,
I went on the Internet.

880
00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:47.390
I looked for a simple fucking recipe.

881
00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:51.950
All I did to season the meat was a little wishy washy or sauce and some salt.

882
00:52:51.951 --> 00:52:56.450
That was it,
right?
I had white American cheese.
My wife,

883
00:52:56.451 --> 00:52:58.580
isn't it a peppers and onions.
I was like,
fine.

884
00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:00.200
I sauteed a little bit of mushrooms.

885
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:05.360
I had these fresh French rolls do fucking game over,

886
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:11.530
game over.
She ate that thing.
She didn't have time to say how great it was.

887
00:53:11.531 --> 00:53:15.800
She just fucking Wolf that thing down and I was least sitting there like,

888
00:53:15.801 --> 00:53:18.620
you know,
I need the approval of Mike.
Was it good and enjoy it?
She's like,

889
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:23.890
how about the fact that I ate it in a minute and I couldn't even talk because my

890
00:53:24.111 --> 00:53:28.560
mouth was full.
So that's how good it was.
I was fucking site.
I haven't even done,

891
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:32.490
I haven't even,
you can do Reuben's on that fucking thing.

892
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.710
You can make the whole grand samp slam breakfast.
Hashbrowns pancakes,
Bacon,

893
00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:40.920
the whole thing.
Get the Bacon going,
slide the bacon over.

894
00:53:40.921 --> 00:53:44.670
You put the Hash browns in that fucking Greece.
Go Fuck Yourself.

895
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:49.950
Jason Law had already gave it the nickname because I'm bringing it to the Rome

896
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:53.040
Rosebowl.
He calls it the game changer and uh,

897
00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:57.340
he's going to be making Reuben's that day.
Like he's literally j law head is,

898
00:53:57.341 --> 00:54:02.100
is a fucking ridiculous cook.
He's unbelievable,
right?

899
00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.350
He's so excited about that thing.

900
00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:07.620
He like dropped his voice like three octaves.

901
00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:11.160
I sent him a picture.
He was saying,
here,

902
00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:14.400
I got to do you guys see what I got for the tailgate tailgate to year.
He goes,

903
00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:17.430
I really do what you get.
What'd you get?
And I show it to him.
He was just like,

904
00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:20.580
ah,
dude,
dude,
you gotta Cook top

905
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.830
that's fucking limitless.
Hey,
you can do [inaudible] Reuben.

906
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:29.910
She new breakfast or he just fucking rattle and I just started laughing.
He goes,

907
00:54:29.911 --> 00:54:33.180
I think at that thing is a game changer.
It's literally a fucking game changer.

908
00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:37.380
Um,
he was,
uh,
I can't even tell you the ideas that he,

909
00:54:37.381 --> 00:54:39.030
cause he told me I should put out my own one.

910
00:54:39.031 --> 00:54:41.550
He and all these fucking great ideas,
but I don't want anybody to steal it.

911
00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:45.750
I probably won't put it out anyways,
but,
um,
so,
um,

912
00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:50.870
steak and cheese is on,
forget about on the Diet,
by the way.

913
00:54:50.871 --> 00:54:55.130
I've done a cardio every day this month.
All right.
11 days in,

914
00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:57.020
I got day 12 here.
I'm telling you,

915
00:54:57.530 --> 00:55:01.190
go through the holidays just to a fuck and a half hour cardio every fucking day.

916
00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:04.800
All right.
And you pick your spots.

917
00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:07.530
We eat like a fucking moron aid like a moron yesterday.

918
00:55:07.531 --> 00:55:11.340
And then today you get right back on it,
you know?
Um,

919
00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.340
and that way you start the year,
you know,
you're not a fat fuck.

920
00:55:14.341 --> 00:55:15.870
You don't get that extra 10 to 15.

921
00:55:15.871 --> 00:55:18.600
You don't want to deal with that shit or you know,
or whatever.

922
00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:21.510
Don't listen to me all.
Listen to me.
Okay,
here we go.

923
00:55:21.511 --> 00:55:25.170
Let's get to the emails for this week.
Um,
all right,
mom,

924
00:55:25.171 --> 00:55:29.550
worried about me traveling a dear Billy scrotum head.

925
00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.360
I know what that's just fucking mean for mean sec.
Uh,

926
00:55:33.361 --> 00:55:37.110
my girlfriend and I had been dating for five years now and finally decided to

927
00:55:37.111 --> 00:55:40.890
travel abroad together.
You'd taking your broad a broad,

928
00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:44.160
um,
she is a seasoned traveler,

929
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:47.460
but I have yet to have traveled internationally.
Well,
that's great.

930
00:55:47.461 --> 00:55:50.370
She knows what she's doing.
Just follow her lead.
Uh,

931
00:55:50.371 --> 00:55:55.220
we recently person's purchase tickets to Greece to pop my cherry,
uh,

932
00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:59.040
cell slash celebrate her birthday.
Um,

933
00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:01.620
well that's great.
Uh,

934
00:56:01.621 --> 00:56:05.220
I just told my mom about the trip and a few days later received a text from her

935
00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:09.090
very worried about traveling to Greece slash out of the country.

936
00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:14.350
I'm 27 years old,
uh,
mom and scared of me getting a,

937
00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:15.810
you left out some words here,
buddy.

938
00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.760
My mom is scared of me getting killed due to the country's current state and

939
00:56:20.761 --> 00:56:25.420
terrorists.
My mom took a few days to all the negative things,
unemployment,

940
00:56:25.421 --> 00:56:29.620
bankruptcy,
et Cetera,
about Greece to try to dissuade me from going,
well,

941
00:56:29.621 --> 00:56:31.060
if she looked up the fucking,

942
00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:36.190
is it Santa Maria Santa Rally for the Fiats Frank Center really is a comedian.

943
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:39.770
What's that fucking beautiful place you stay?
It's all,
every,

944
00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:42.490
all the buildings are white.
It's right on the Mediterranean Sea.

945
00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:46.390
If she looked that up,
she'd be fine.
Listen,

946
00:56:46.391 --> 00:56:48.970
if you live in America and you just set it in your,
in your,

947
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:51.310
if you're going to listen to the international news,

948
00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:53.560
they're not going to talk to you about great shit.

949
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:57.220
You got to watch the travel channel.
If they're going to show the news,

950
00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:00.100
are you going to hear is bad shit that's like,

951
00:57:00.101 --> 00:57:03.910
oh everybody in for everybody in England thinks everybody like over here weighs

952
00:57:03.911 --> 00:57:08.680
400 pounds and owns 15 guns and you walk down the street or put them on your

953
00:57:08.681 --> 00:57:11.980
hip.
You know what I mean?
I see just as many fat fucks in,

954
00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:14.320
in fucking Great Britain.
Maybe not as much,

955
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:18.280
but there's a lot of fish and chip eating.
Fucking write teeth,

956
00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:24.500
dirty,
dirty white people out there.
Um,
but that's all.

957
00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:27.190
That's all you're going to know.
Tell her to put on the travel channel.

958
00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:31.030
Send her a couple of fucking links.
All right.
Anyways,
he goes,

959
00:57:31.031 --> 00:57:32.860
I understand that she's worried about her son,

960
00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:38.130
but I'm also aware that she lives in a shell and she's never traveled abroad.
Um,

961
00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:41.200
after hearing on the podcasts that you have been to Greece recently.
No,

962
00:57:41.201 --> 00:57:44.860
I haven't.
I want to go there.
I went to Italy recently by questions for you.
Is,

963
00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:48.760
do you think an average Joe first time parenthesis,

964
00:57:48.761 --> 00:57:53.200
nervous traveler like myself will feel safe?
Any words to put me at ease?

965
00:57:53.201 --> 00:57:55.180
I would love to hear what you have to say.

966
00:57:55.181 --> 00:57:58.120
Good or bad as this will help in my decision to,

967
00:57:58.121 --> 00:58:00.730
the greatest fucking thing is you're going,
um,

968
00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:03.370
with your girlfriend and she's a seasoned traveler.

969
00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:07.060
She'll know what the fuck to do.
So just follow her lead.

970
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:12.220
But I would encourage you to step out of your shell.
Learn a couple of phrases.

971
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:17.560
The locals love when you make an attempt to speak their language,
even in Paris,

972
00:58:17.561 --> 00:58:18.580
as much as they get shit,

973
00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:23.760
if you're really fucking trying and you're showing respect for their culture and

974
00:58:24.881 --> 00:58:28.330
you're on your best behavior.
That's another thing too.
When you travel abroad,

975
00:58:28.331 --> 00:58:31.940
you're on your best behavior.
Unlike all these fucking Europeans.

976
00:58:31.941 --> 00:58:33.310
So many of them that come over here,

977
00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:37.570
they literally start trashing America to you in the United States of America.

978
00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:42.730
It's like Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You know what I mean?

979
00:58:42.731 --> 00:58:45.070
Like as much as I was just teasing,
when I go over there,

980
00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:48.490
I'm on my best fucking behavior.
All right?
I go on stage,

981
00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.110
I'll tease them a little bit,
but in general,

982
00:58:50.111 --> 00:58:52.150
I talk about what a great fucking time I'm having it.

983
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:57.340
You can easily pick apart any fucking place that you go to.
Um,

984
00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:03.700
so anyways,
I would learn a couple of phrases.
Um,
two you're going to eat,

985
00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:06.520
you're going to have food over there like you've never had here before.

986
00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:08.290
You're going to see things you'd never had.

987
00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:12.430
You have to swim in the Mediterranean Sea.
It is fucking life changing.

988
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:16.540
And Dude,
I'm telling you right now,
if you have any sort of stress in your life,

989
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:21.190
if you stay along the Mediterranean from Spain all the way over to Greece,

990
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:24.830
you can't fucking Miss,
you know,

991
00:59:24.831 --> 00:59:29.831
just all I would say is just watch out for pickpockets.

992
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:32.060
Okay?
Those gypsies are,

993
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:36.740
are the fucking bill Belichick and Tom Brady's of pickpocketing.
I mean they,

994
00:59:36.741 --> 00:59:40.880
it is a fucking art form.
They're so good at it.
You almost won't be mad.
Like,

995
00:59:40.881 --> 00:59:42.890
how the fuck did they do that?
All right.

996
00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:46.310
So that's the biggest thing that I would worry about.

997
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:51.370
And especially watch your wife with their big stupid fucking purses and they're

998
00:59:51.441 --> 00:59:56.240
all excited and they're fucking looking around.
This is what you do.
All right?

999
00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.050
You make a copy of the passport.
Okay.

1000
01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:05.300
Copy you fucking passport and you fucking keep your,
you know,

1001
01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:10.100
having in the safe at the fucking hotel.
All right,
keep it at the hotel.

1002
01:00:10.101 --> 01:00:13.160
I'd take my chances with some cleaning lady taking your passport.

1003
01:00:13.161 --> 01:00:17.180
She ain't going to fucking do that.
Right.
You have a copy of that.
All right.

1004
01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:18.380
Um,

1005
01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:23.380
I would definitely wear some sort of fucking like pants that have zippers on

1006
01:00:24.501 --> 01:00:29.330
them that you can zip that shit shut and when a bunch of people start coming up

1007
01:00:29.331 --> 01:00:33.350
to you crowding you,
be it on the subway or anything like that,

1008
01:00:33.351 --> 01:00:37.370
you put your hand on your fucking wallet,
you have it right there.

1009
01:00:37.371 --> 01:00:41.180
I wouldn't have,
don't have any fucking thing of value whatsoever.

1010
01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.230
And I'm telling you right now,

1011
01:00:42.231 --> 01:00:47.060
this probably making you fucking nervous or whatever.
This is just,
this is just,

1012
01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:49.850
you know,
misdemeanor steel and ship.

1013
01:00:49.851 --> 01:00:52.570
But we will make your life fucking miserable because you're going to have your

1014
01:00:52.571 --> 01:00:56.960
credit cards and all that type of shit and you money and all of that.
It's just,

1015
01:00:56.961 --> 01:00:57.794
you know,

1016
01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:00.950
pick pockets is the only fucking thing that I ran into when I was over there.

1017
01:01:00.951 --> 01:01:03.920
That's the only thing you have to worry about and just really,

1018
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:08.950
really be super fucking hyper fucking aware when you're walking up to um,

1019
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:13.820
whatever the fuck tours,
teeth and what are they going over there?

1020
01:01:13.821 --> 01:01:16.310
They have the ruins,
all of that shit.
You know,

1021
01:01:16.311 --> 01:01:18.800
you're going to go any to any of that type of stuff.
Like in Paris,

1022
01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.310
if you go up to the Eiffel Tower,
you have your hands on your shit.

1023
01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:27.890
And when people come walking up to you,
um,
speaking in English,

1024
01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:32.510
just literally just fucking go.
No Oblong,
no are blown.
Just fucking,

1025
01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:35.570
and if they keep coming out,
you'd just say,
get the fuck away from me.

1026
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:39.080
I'm telling you right now,
if you just tell him to get the fuck away from you,

1027
01:01:39.081 --> 01:01:42.020
any of those fucking broads coming up to you,
they want to,
you know,

1028
01:01:42.021 --> 01:01:44.840
you're at the Eiffel Tower,
the Eiffel Tower.
What are you going to stand in line?

1029
01:01:44.841 --> 01:01:46.760
You go on the Eiffel Tower,
get the fuck away from me.

1030
01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:50.540
That coming up there to steal from you and watch out for their kids.

1031
01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:55.550
That's the only fucking thing.
Cause they are fucking tremendous added.
Um,

1032
01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:58.520
that's all the,
anytime you walk out of there.
And I would also,

1033
01:01:58.521 --> 01:02:01.370
the next advice I'd give you is,
um,

1034
01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.910
like just bring,
carry on.

1035
01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.360
I didn't even say that to your wife to just bring your girlfriend.
Just bring,

1036
01:02:09.361 --> 01:02:12.470
carry on.
You're going to wear the same fucking tee shirt and shorts.

1037
01:02:12.471 --> 01:02:16.160
Basically every God damn day,
no one's gonna give a fuck.
You're on vacation,

1038
01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:21.270
flip flops and all of that type of shit.
Okay?
All I can say is just like,

1039
01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:25.830
you know,
under pack and if you want to buy,
um,

1040
01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:31.360
if you want to buy like some touristy shit,
you know what I love?
I love magnets.

1041
01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:32.500
I loved those patches,

1042
01:02:32.501 --> 01:02:35.980
those flags that you're going to sew onto a code or some shit.
You know,

1043
01:02:35.981 --> 01:02:38.400
you have the memories,
you have the pictures.
You would,

1044
01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:41.350
what are you gonna you don't need to go out and buy some wooden shoes and a big

1045
01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:45.790
Beerstein.
If you want to buy some shit like that,
ship it back.
Do that.

1046
01:02:45.791 --> 01:02:47.140
Just go there.
Have a good time.

1047
01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:50.590
Watch your fucking valuables when you're around fucking if you're on the subway

1048
01:02:50.591 --> 01:02:54.370
or if you're near anything touristy other than that,
have a great fucking time.

1049
01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.473
Chill out.

1050
01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:00.130
Eat the best fucking food you ever going to fucking have and swim in the

1051
01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:02.740
Mediterranean Sea and you'll have those memories for your whole fucking life.

1052
01:03:02.741 --> 01:03:05.920
It's the greatest fucking thing.
And I feel bad for you mom,

1053
01:03:05.921 --> 01:03:08.560
that she's never traveled outside of the country because it's a great thing.

1054
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:13.840
All right.
Clingy,
girlfriend,
clingy girlfriend,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,

1055
01:03:13.841 --> 01:03:18.130
bump.
Hey Bill,
as you may have read from the title of this email,

1056
01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:20.500
I am dealing with a clingy girlfriend.

1057
01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:24.460
We've been dating for three months now and pretty much have only known each

1058
01:03:24.461 --> 01:03:25.294
other,

1059
01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:29.110
but we'd been dating for three months now and pretty much have only known each

1060
01:03:29.111 --> 01:03:32.390
other for three months now.
So it's a pretty new relationship.
Okay.
So I get it.

1061
01:03:32.391 --> 01:03:36.460
He didn't work with her,
gradually work up the balls you saw and you said,
bitch,

1062
01:03:36.461 --> 01:03:40.390
you come in with me.
And she was like,
oh my God,
you so direct.
Anyways,

1063
01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:42.220
as I've gotten deeper in the relationship,

1064
01:03:42.221 --> 01:03:46.240
I've started to notice more and more red flags.
I'll tell you this right now.

1065
01:03:46.241 --> 01:03:50.410
If you start noticing more and more red flags,
three months in,
um,
our,

1066
01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:53.680
I already have my finger on the fucking eject button personally,

1067
01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:58.510
does farm into your email,
okay.
For,
for example,

1068
01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.240
uh,
she gets mad and starts crying.

1069
01:04:01.241 --> 01:04:05.550
If I want to go to the gym by myself and not bring her up,
fuck this,
uh,

1070
01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:09.400
over,
over,
over,
over,

1071
01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:10.840
<v 1>okay.</v>

1072
01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:15.100
<v 0>Fucking over.
Or if I don't reply to her texts,
within five minutes,</v>

1073
01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:19.210
she calls me and asks me why I haven't answered.
She's even already said,

1074
01:04:19.211 --> 01:04:23.020
I love you to me.
And I actually set it back when we were having sex,

1075
01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:26.230
accidentally said,
I love you.
Only a guy can say that.

1076
01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:29.500
And now she says it back to me all the time and I haven't,

1077
01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:34.180
and I have to say it back because I don't want to break her heart and tell her

1078
01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:39.430
that I don't feel the same way.
Well,
you already have.
You already have.
All right,

1079
01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:43.570
just give her a three month broken heart.
Get out to get out.

1080
01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:48.290
I've even tried to break up with her like a week ago.
Get Out,
get out.

1081
01:04:49.030 --> 01:04:52.480
And she started to have a breakdown saying how much she needed me and how she

1082
01:04:52.481 --> 01:04:54.580
can't live with that.
Get Out,

1083
01:04:56.890 --> 01:05:01.760
get out,
get out of here.
So I told her,
yeah,

1084
01:05:01.761 --> 01:05:04.600
we could just stay together because I felt bad.
All right dude.

1085
01:05:04.601 --> 01:05:07.600
You've basically already broken up with her.
She goes,

1086
01:05:07.601 --> 01:05:12.490
she also just randomly flat out said that she can see us together forever.

1087
01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:16.900
I don't know why I'm noticing all these things now,
but I'm only 19 years of age.

1088
01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:19.930
Well,
there you go dude.
To be honest,
I still,

1089
01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:26.970
sorry the fuck is going on with my throat here.
Screen too much to say.

1090
01:05:26.971 --> 01:05:27.611
And to be honest,

1091
01:05:27.611 --> 01:05:30.400
I still want to live the bachelor lifestyle and not be in a relationship.

1092
01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:32.110
Do you know all the answers to your question?

1093
01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:36.940
Try all the different fish in the sea.
Sorry if I sound Douchey,

1094
01:05:36.941 --> 01:05:40.810
but I just really need help here,
but I don't know what to do.
Thanks bill.

1095
01:05:40.811 --> 01:05:42.880
And come back to,
I'm not even to say the name of the state.

1096
01:05:42.881 --> 01:05:46.720
This chick's such a psycho.
Um,
yeah dude,
this is what I would do.

1097
01:05:48.330 --> 01:05:49.163
<v 2>MMM.</v>

1098
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:51.770
<v 0>And I'm taking this from Al Madrigal,</v>

1099
01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:56.930
the Great Al Madrigal who no one knows honey to end shit like him.

1100
01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:02.120
Um,
if you listen to any of our live ATC podcast,

1101
01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:06.620
he worked in his family business and at your age 19,
he was already,

1102
01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:11.960
he was the hatchet man.
He fired adults and he told me one time,

1103
01:06:11.961 --> 01:06:15.760
the best way to get out of a relationship,
okay,
if this is for everybody,
do this.

1104
01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:19.250
You have a woman in your life and you have to break up with it.

1105
01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:22.640
There are going to drag you through the shit.
Okay?

1106
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:27.020
If you want to expedite the deep planning process,

1107
01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:28.663
<v 2>mmm.</v>

1108
01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:34.360
<v 0>If she has anything over your apartment,
get it all together.
Put it in a box.</v>

1109
01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:39.970
Call her.
Say we need to talk.
You show up with the box.
You handed the box.

1110
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:42.180
You tell her it's fucking over,

1111
01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:43.650
<v 2>okay.</v>

1112
01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:47.040
<v 0>Right?
You let her cry.
You fucking leave.
Now,</v>

1113
01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:48.990
if she has keys to your place,

1114
01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:54.750
you don't even need to ask from back.
You already have changed the locks.

1115
01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:58.710
If she offers to give you the keys back,
you take them,

1116
01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:03.600
but you never offer the information that you have changed the fucking locks.

1117
01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:07.740
It's out.
It's over.
It's done.
Dude.
Rip This bandaid off.

1118
01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:11.760
That's your fucking Christmas gift and anybody out there right now,

1119
01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:13.290
male or female,
if you're in a relationship,

1120
01:07:13.291 --> 01:07:16.650
you don't want to be in fucking do it.
Do It fucking tonight.

1121
01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:20.820
Get your box together.
Change your fucking locks and the shit.

1122
01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:26.370
Your Christmas gift.
Don't go to another fucking family events,

1123
01:07:26.371 --> 01:07:29.370
someone else's family that you don't want to fucking be with your OT self.

1124
01:07:29.371 --> 01:07:34.060
Get the fuck out of it.
All right,
messy girlfriend.
Uh,
hey Billy.

1125
01:07:34.061 --> 01:07:38.730
Oh,
I live with my girlfriend for the past few years in a tried and failed

1126
01:07:38.731 --> 01:07:43.170
repeatedly,
repeatedly to get her to tidy up after herself.

1127
01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:47.310
She lives like a borderline slob with piles of shit everywhere,

1128
01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.680
on most available surfaces.

1129
01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:53.850
Instead of putting stuff away after herself should just leave it out for days.

1130
01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:57.960
Most days I'll come back from work and the bed will be piled high with clothes

1131
01:07:58.410 --> 01:08:02.640
and the dump contents of handbags,
et cetera.
In the end,

1132
01:08:02.641 --> 01:08:06.480
the evening,
very underrated Zeppelin song.
By the way,

1133
01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:09.500
this will be off.
This will often,
uh,

1134
01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:13.680
just get moved to the Sofa and then in the morning,
move back to the bed.

1135
01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:16.610
Every cover in drawer is piled full of shit.

1136
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:19.400
I have a couple of small spaces for my belongings.

1137
01:08:19.401 --> 01:08:23.750
Everywhere else is full of clothes she hasn't worn for months.
Parentheses,

1138
01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:28.170
question mark years dozens of handbags purchase.
She doesn't practice,

1139
01:08:28.190 --> 01:08:31.160
she doesn't use bits of paper cards.
She keeps,

1140
01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:35.240
she's keeping for who knows what dozens of beauty products she get the picture.

1141
01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:39.470
I do try to keep things tidy at best I can for my own sanity.

1142
01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.330
But it'd be nice to have,
not,

1143
01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:45.770
not to have to nag or every so often to just tidy up after s after self.

1144
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:46.950
I keep,

1145
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:51.650
if I kept pissing on the toilet seat and she kept telling me how annoying it

1146
01:08:51.651 --> 01:08:54.590
was,
I think she be right in thinking what the,

1147
01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:56.090
what the Hell is wrong with this dude?

1148
01:08:56.330 --> 01:09:00.530
Surely tiding up after yourself is about respect for the other person or people

1149
01:09:00.531 --> 01:09:04.160
you live with.
I know the whole accept me for who I am.

1150
01:09:04.161 --> 01:09:06.980
Bullshit and all then all of that.
But come on.

1151
01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:09.180
I was wondering what your,

1152
01:09:09.790 --> 01:09:13.940
you worthy of the lovely Nias um,
Leno's thoughts on this are,

1153
01:09:14.770 --> 01:09:18.830
um,
um,
well,
I'll tell you this dude,
uh,

1154
01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:20.420
that's not going to get any better.

1155
01:09:20.530 --> 01:09:24.110
She sound like you've got a small time hoarder on your,
on your hands here.

1156
01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:28.290
Forget about it.
If you get married and have kids,
um,
so you gotta,

1157
01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:30.530
you gotta ask yourself right now,
are you going to marry this person?

1158
01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:31.760
If you're not,

1159
01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:36.680
pack up your own box and get the fuck out of there and already have an apartment

1160
01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:39.920
ready to go.
By the way,
you pack up your box,

1161
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:43.970
you bring this shit over to the fucking apartment while she's at work.

1162
01:09:43.971 --> 01:09:46.520
Then you call her,
you say,
listen,
we need to talk.

1163
01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:51.280
And then you get the fuck out of there.
You say,

1164
01:09:51.281 --> 01:09:54.370
I'm going for a drive and you drive over to the new apartment and then you call

1165
01:09:54.371 --> 01:09:57.040
her up from a pay phone and you say,
by the way,

1166
01:09:57.490 --> 01:10:00.160
when I said I was going for a drive,
what I really should have said was,

1167
01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:04.240
I just moved out.
Uh,
good luck to you.
And,
uh,

1168
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:07.510
you know,
let's,
let's try and win in Chicago and you hang up,

1169
01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:11.050
you go a little Robert Kennedy there,
right?
It's fucking over.
Um,

1170
01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:13.660
I can tell you right now,
dude,
I couldn't tolerate that.

1171
01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:17.770
I couldn't tolerate living with the fucking slob.
There's no,

1172
01:10:17.771 --> 01:10:22.510
I fucking hated that when I lived,
when I had guy roommates,
I was,

1173
01:10:22.511 --> 01:10:23.620
I never understood that.

1174
01:10:23.621 --> 01:10:27.490
Like how guys thought it was funny to have like fucking pizza boxes and all this

1175
01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:30.250
like live in like a fucking animal.
It's like guys,
we live here,

1176
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:32.830
it's fucking gross.
Um,

1177
01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:37.860
so you have to decide if you love this person enough to accept this part of them

1178
01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:42.670
or you have to,
or maybe you throw down an ultimatum.

1179
01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:47.050
Like if there's no fucking way I'm living my life like this.

1180
01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:50.380
This is completely unacceptable.
You have way too much shit.

1181
01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:55.510
You need to throw out at least 70% of your shit.
Okay.

1182
01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:56.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1183
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:58.660
<v 0>And if she gives you a rough time and just say,
listen,</v>

1184
01:10:58.990 --> 01:11:02.290
you eat either that shit is going out the door or I am,

1185
01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:09.490
are you saying that you're choosing that over me?
Yes.

1186
01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:12.820
Yes.
Cause I'm telling you right now,
I am not going to be happy.

1187
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:18.120
Are you telling me that you love your fucking bags more than you love me?

1188
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.560
Just turn that stupid psych psychology shit right back on them.

1189
01:11:22.170 --> 01:11:24.570
Get it the fuck Outta here.

1190
01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:27.630
It gets the fuck out or I get the fuck out.

1191
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:32.550
And then you put on some Christmas music.
Have a Holly jolly Christmas.

1192
01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:36.370
Right.
All right,
here we go.
Next one,
three stooges.
Hello Mr. Berger.

1193
01:11:36.371 --> 01:11:39.060
I was wondering who your favorite,
who's your favorite stooge?

1194
01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:42.930
I know most people are curly fans,
but I've always been a Schempp fan.

1195
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.510
Any who have a good day.
Um,

1196
01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.510
SCHEMPP is unbelievably underrated.

1197
01:11:48.511 --> 01:11:53.070
The fact that he had to follow Curley and Curley was in bad health slash I think

1198
01:11:53.071 --> 01:11:55.950
might've died during his tenure.
Um,

1199
01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:01.290
I loved shrimp,
but curly curly is the best.

1200
01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:06.290
But Larry Larry's under fucking rated to Larry's fucking hilarious.

1201
01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:07.620
And Mo is the bully.

1202
01:12:07.621 --> 01:12:10.960
I can never get into mode cause I had an older brother and I was just like that

1203
01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:11.850
fucking asshole.

1204
01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:15.960
I used to love it every once in a while when mo with loose one of those little

1205
01:12:15.961 --> 01:12:19.770
slap battles.
But,
um,
I loved all of them.
And people always say,
you know,

1206
01:12:19.771 --> 01:12:22.740
you're either a stooges fan or you like the Marx brothers.

1207
01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:25.770
I fucking hated the Marx brothers.
I thought they were boring as shit.

1208
01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:31.010
I bet if I got a phone now that I'm older,
maybe I'd enjoy it more.
But,
um,

1209
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:35.190
I dunno.
I just thought it was clever shit.

1210
01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.700
We're three stooges was just fucking,
it was hilarious.

1211
01:12:38.701 --> 01:12:42.690
They were just beating the fuck out of each other.
And,
uh,
I dunno,

1212
01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:44.400
it's clever as a joke is,

1213
01:12:44.401 --> 01:12:48.390
is there anything funnier than seeing somebody walking into a fucking window of

1214
01:12:48.391 --> 01:12:49.920
fallen down a flight of stairs?

1215
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:54.060
There's nothing funnier than watching somebody hurt themselves.
Um,

1216
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:59.310
I dunno.
Maybe I'm just,
maybe I'm just not smart enough.
You know what?

1217
01:12:59.311 --> 01:13:01.200
I should look at the Marx brothers before he trashed them.

1218
01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.680
I will tell you that one guy could fucking play the harp like nobody.
Huh?

1219
01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:07.800
Alright.
Mvt and they'll get read a little advertising.

1220
01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:11.070

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:26.830
I'm very happy that we were able to find a new home for my dog.

1259
01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:31.270
They've already sent this text and pictures and she's totally fine and it's,

1260
01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:35.860
you know,
I'm glad that we didn't have to,
you know,
I was,

1261
01:15:35.861 --> 01:15:40.600
there was no fucking way any that that dog was not going to continue on living

1262
01:15:40.690 --> 01:15:42.550
a,
she's had an amazing life.

1263
01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.500
She's lived like three different books and,
um,
me and my wife,

1264
01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:51.820
we're happy to be where we do seven and a half years with her.
And,
um,

1265
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:56.650
I love her to death.
I'm going to miss her like hell.
But I had to do it because,

1266
01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:58.713
you know,

1267
01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:02.230
the alternative was going to be something horrible and I did not want to have to

1268
01:16:02.231 --> 01:16:06.550
fucking live through that.
Um,
but I am devastated and,
um,

1269
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:10.870
I would appreciate it if you don't send me any fucking insensitive tweets about

1270
01:16:10.871 --> 01:16:15.070
it because I'm really on the ropes right here.
All right.
That's the podcast.

1271
01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:20.071
Go fuck yourselves and a law check in on you on Thursday.
