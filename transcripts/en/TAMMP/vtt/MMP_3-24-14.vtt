00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.210
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.720
March 24th,

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.290
2014 what's going on?
How are Ya?
Um,
uh,
back in the United States.

4
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.000
<v 1>Oh.
Say can you</v>

5
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.300
<v 2>dad fuck is fat chick with the pockets?</v>

6
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.070
<v 0>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.210
<v 2>Buying a hot dog and set up on</v>

8
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.150
<v 0>right is I get off the tarmac.</v>

9
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.490
She puts some frost is our,
um,

10
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.410
I didn't see that for some reason.

11
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:49.650
I was picturing a fat woman with the pockets that are at least a foot apart.

12
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.450
You know what I mean?
I don't know why I was thinking that.
I don't know.
I'm,

13
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:56.670
but I'm back.
I'm in my house.

14
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.380
It's nice to be sleeping in my own bed after a,
you know,
three weeks being away.

15
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.800
<v 1>It's nice to see the White House was still here and that the people I love are</v>

16
00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:08.620
still,
uh,
in fact not in detention camps.

17
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.700
<v 0>Um,
it's weird being away that long and then come back.
I'm still,
uh,</v>

18
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.330
still a little more,
a little out of it,
man.
You know,
I'm not a young guy anymore.

19
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.460
It takes me a couple of days to settle back into my routine,

20
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.900
you know,
uh,

21
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.310
Gaman my way through some fucking grape nuts that I let it soak in the FEC and

22
00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:32.750
milk,
you know,
toss a little banana on top of it.

23
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.210
You know,
it's funny,
every time I go to get a banana,

24
00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:38.480
I deliberately don't take the one with the sticker on it.

25
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.820
I take that one last because I worked with the comic who had a bit about it and

26
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.510
every fucking night I had to listen to do this bit about how and which one do we

27
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:49.820
take the one with the sticker and then what would you do?

28
00:01:49.821 --> 00:01:52.870
You'd stick it on your forehead and he kept fucking opening with the joke of

29
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.220
closing with the,
I just started six times.

30
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.300
I'm talking like 15 fucking years ago to this day.

31
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:03.230
I will not take a banana first.
That as a staff.
Occasionally I do,

32
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.730
you know,
and somewhere I hear him we won't see.
I told you and I'll be be,

33
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.160
what do you mean you fucking told me?
I,

34
00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:15.050
that's like once in a blue moon and then here's the ghost of his voice is going.

35
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.360
Yeah,
but you're doing it on purpose.
If you didn't hear my bet,

36
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:19.760
you would have done it every time.
So my jokes,
right?
It's like,
you know,
I'm like,

37
00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:23.300
go fuck yourself.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Well what,
what are you doing?

38
00:02:23.301 --> 00:02:27.260
Talking in my head.
Okay.
This you just be me and all my friends.
Not You.

39
00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:29.810
You're not invited.
All right to fuck you and your,
your,

40
00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:34.220
your theories about the fruit that I consume.
All right.

41
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.430
All right.
Everybody is fucking March 24th okay.

42
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.810
And if you live in a colder climate in the northern hemisphere,
you gotta start,

43
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.370
you gotta be getting excited,
right?
Day light savings.
The snow starting to thaw,

44
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.953
right?

45
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.430
The ladies are starting to hit the gym.

46
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.360
You're going to hit the gym.
Every body's going to hit the gym.

47
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.130
You know,
he had comes may

48
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.950
<v 3>Mae's right around the corner and everybody,
you know,</v>

49
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:07.390
the guy's got to get out the guns.
The ladies got to show off their thighs.

50
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:11.860
Everybody has to look desirable.
So somehow they meet that certain,

51
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:15.190
someone that's just going to hold them at night and tell them that everything's

52
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:17.980
gonna be okay,
but that's not going to happen.
Right.

53
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.620
Unless you're in shape by make.

54
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.200
So put down those winter cookies.
Everybody may is coming.

55
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.390
April is a fucking wash.

56
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.660
Nobody gives a fuck about April except neo Nazis because Hitler's birthday is

57
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:36.130
sometime in there.
Right.

58
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.750
And they all get together with their awful haircuts in this stupid mustaches,

59
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.260
you know,
cause they just want to be a part of something.

60
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.290
And they had awful parents who just didn't get them into scouting.

61
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.460
So what did they do instead?
They join the Hitler youth.
You know why?

62
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:53.500
Because they're weak fucking people.

63
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.650
<v 4>Okay.</v>

64
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.120
<v 3>All right.
If you have to go out and join a fucking group,</v>

65
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.990
you know,
at any God damn age,
you know,

66
00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:08.590
unless it's something just fun.
I guess being a Neo Nazi,

67
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.530
it's got to have its upsides.
Right.

68
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.400
<v 4>Okay.</v>

69
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.240
<v 3>The boots,</v>

70
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.560
you know,
getting a borrow.
Yeah.

71
00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:26.561
The fucking Nazi friends clippers when you share off the side of your skull,

72
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.790
whatever the fuck you do.

73
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.540
<v 4>Okay.</v>

74
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.660
<v 3>I know fucking,
I don't want it to fucking talking about,
you know,
fuck groups.</v>

75
00:04:33.661 --> 00:04:37.770
My groups can be all right.
You know,
I guess they can be okay.

76
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.140
I'm trying to think of a good group.
What's a good group?

77
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.750
Like just a group of people that get together in a group and somehow they're not

78
00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:46.590
fucking annoying.

79
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.580
I mean there's even people out there or I agree with what they're doing,

80
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.720
but the second thing,

81
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.370
the group gets the commercial on TV and they just start going,
you know,

82
00:04:56.371 --> 00:05:01.371
every day over 8,000 poodles get their hair straightened against their will.

83
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.480
I mean they start showing the sad 40 I stopped fucking hate and the poodle

84
00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:08.730
people,
I don't hate poodles.
I don't like him.

85
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.030
<v 4>Okay.</v>

86
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.870
<v 3>You know,
but I feel like they should wear their hair the way they want to have.</v>

87
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:18.260
Definitely for that.
But I don't need some fucking former shit.

88
00:05:18.261 --> 00:05:21.930
Calm Star who's put on some God damn booze,

89
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:25.570
a baby weight coming up the fucking screen in the middle of the Goddamn game

90
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:28.660
telling me why I got to care about a fucking Pekinese.

91
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.020
Whatever the fuck kind of dog it is.
One of those God damn dogs.

92
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.190
You see fucking walking around in a purse,
right?

93
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.410
He's fucking women walking around.
Never had a babysitter or want to babysit.

94
00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:43.630
Now they've got to have this fucking little primate in there.

95
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.060
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

96
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.330
<v 5>you may help me.
Me,
me,
me,
me,
me,</v>

97
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.323
baby.

98
00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.810
<v 3>Do it at the back of the head.
No trial in my world.</v>

99
00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.770
If I was running shit.
You know
that probably seems harsh,

100
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:05.771
but did I say I'd feed my naked uncle to a bunch of dogs like old fat face over

101
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:09.890
there?
Huh?
How soft as heck.

102
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:12.730
I look on that fat fuck over there and fucking uh,

103
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.720
what do you call it now in North Korea.

104
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.950
So we're calling it nowadays the all end k,
he looks soft.

105
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.490
<v 0>You can take that guy down,
you know,</v>

106
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.200
<v 3>call his number,
little pitch out.
Run the old Packard sweep,</v>

107
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.430
your job's to force it to the inside and I come in,
I fill the fucking lane.

108
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:35.150
You don't think I'm going to drill in white between his fucking hairless man

109
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:35.984
tits.

110
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.260
<v 4>Okay.</v>

111
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.380
<v 3>And knocked some of his non heard metals right off his fucking uniform.</v>

112
00:06:40.381 --> 00:06:43.380
When you think about that,
I'll do that 45 I'm calling it right now.

113
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.730
<v 0>Call it right now.</v>

114
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.120
<v 3>All right.
Red gets the age gap.</v>

115
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

116
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.970
<v 3>Oh Shit.
Um,
anyway.
Yeah.</v>

117
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:02.950
So I'm back in town.
I feel like I should have started a song.
Right.

118
00:07:02.951 --> 00:07:04.780
There were like one of those fucking Beatles songs.

119
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.440
Roller Women's starts screaming and yelling,
you know,
in pregnant me.

120
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.510
That's what they say and where are they saying I'll suck it.

121
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.710
I don't know what they're saying,

122
00:07:14.711 --> 00:07:19.150
but all of them are well into their fucking sixties at this point.

123
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.690
All those fucking young women that you hear screaming on that Ed Sullivan show,

124
00:07:22.691 --> 00:07:25.990
he figures to say to me made was like,
what?
13 years old?

125
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.200
That was 50 fucking years ago there.
63 years ago.

126
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.590
<v 0>63 years old at this point.
You know,</v>

127
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:38.230
that's how quick it fucking goes.
So that's my message to you this week,

128
00:07:38.231 --> 00:07:41.830
everybody.
All right.
I don't want my,
I have no fucking message.

129
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.960
I'm just happy to be home.
My fucking brains all over the goddamn place,
you know?

130
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.390
It's just all over the fucking place
as it always is.

131
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.640
I don't have any fucking desire to do standup for a while.

132
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.223
I got to tell you,

133
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.590
I got my fill of it and that tour 22 fucking shows doing about an hour and a

134
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.400
half a night.
In 20 days.
I've had enough.
I've had enough of the,
uh,

135
00:08:09.401 --> 00:08:12.520
what's up with the fucking lamp over there?
Okay.

136
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.550
I'm going to take at least 10 days off.
I'm not doing shit.

137
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.910
You guys know,
I came home.
I'm barely left the fucking house.

138
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.540
My Wife's looking at me like I'm a psycho because I'm usually like,

139
00:08:25.541 --> 00:08:27.130
I get home for two seconds,

140
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.990
I throw my bags down and then I walk out the door and she,
she'll just be like,

141
00:08:31.991 --> 00:08:35.640
where are you going?
I'm going.
I'm just like,
I'm like,

142
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.550
I know I'm all fucking wound up.
I just feel like I have to go out and I just,

143
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.690
I dunno where it go.
Drive around and go fucking play drums.

144
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.570
I don't want to do the fuck do I do
drink?

145
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.340
I have no fucking idea.
I can tell you right now though.
Um,

146
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.210
I'm all in with cigar shit though.
After my,
uh,
my,

147
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.030
my second stop in Calgary,
um,

148
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:08.520
we met like this,
we went to the cigar bar out there for the second time,

149
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.200
me and Versie and uh,

150
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.780
met this character and a half that ran the cigar bar.
Fucking great guy.

151
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.190
And he just,
all he has is Cubans in his,

152
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:23.310
uh,
in his shop.
And Dude,

153
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:27.840
he broke down the whole fucking thing,
how they're wrapped,

154
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.260
how to cut the thing and we just go and right.
It'd be like,
you know,

155
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:32.400
if you played,
I dunno,

156
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.330
a sport and then like a fucking pro came in and just broke your game down to the

157
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:39.660
basics.
That's what this guy did.
And um,

158
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.100
we smoked these things.
A home going to say it right.

159
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.860
A part of this,
the number twos.
And,

160
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:53.100
um,
at this point,

161
00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:55.590
that's the only reason why I would get on a fucking plane this week would

162
00:09:55.591 --> 00:10:00.330
literally to be to fly back to Calgary to get a box of those things,
you know,

163
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.700
and then rent like a fucking,
you know,

164
00:10:02.701 --> 00:10:07.701
dodge stratus one way the Boise and then jump on a plane and come back.

165
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:13.540
That's the only fucking reason I do that shit.
I know I'm babbling.
I'm,

166
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.390
I'm all in.
I'm all in.
I'm fucking done.

167
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.750
That habit got its hooks in me and uh,
I'm not complaining,

168
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.820
but the great thing is I live in the United States,

169
00:10:22.821 --> 00:10:25.940
so I can't get any fucking Cuban's other than,
than the counterfeit ones.

170
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.930
You know,

171
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.810
all they'll get you give you one that's hard as a fucking rock and it doesn't

172
00:10:29.811 --> 00:10:31.970
have a good draw and you'd just sit sitting there like I might as well as be

173
00:10:31.971 --> 00:10:36.080
smoking it,
Dutch masters.
So,
um,
whatever.
What are you going to,

174
00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:38.090
this will be something I'm going to do when I leave the country.

175
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.700
I'm just going to smoke fucking Cubans and then when I come back,

176
00:10:40.701 --> 00:10:44.240
I'm going to act like it never happened.
You know,
like a sex offender,
right?

177
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.560
It goes to Thailand,

178
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.530
does whatever the fuck he does and then comes back and then you know,

179
00:10:48.531 --> 00:10:51.230
that Shit's not available here and then you just go about your business.

180
00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.350
I'll just do that in,
in a,
in a,

181
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.220
in a fucking cigar kind of way.
Um,

182
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:04.910
anyway,
so what the fuck did I want to talk about here?
Um,
but all in,

183
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.130
in,
in,
once again,
I know both thanking everybody for the last few weeks.
Uh,

184
00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.880
thank you to everybody who came out to the shows.

185
00:11:09.881 --> 00:11:13.330
That was really a life changing tour and uh,

186
00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:18.140
Canada is now in the loop.
And um,
you know,

187
00:11:18.141 --> 00:11:22.220
when I write my next hour,
I'm going to do the usual toward the states,

188
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.670
usual tour,
Europe,
usual tour of

189
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.860
Australia.
And now Canada is,
I'm added.
I'm adding that.

190
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.450
So that's the deal.

191
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.600
I'm just going to keep expanding the fucking circle and uh,

192
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.680
you know,
fuck else mean.
It's perfect.
I get on a fucking plane.

193
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.220
I sit there,
I read a dumb magazine,
I get off,

194
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.350
there's somebody standing there going,

195
00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:53.110
I you the freckled con that's going to dance like a monkey.
And I say,
I,
I,

196
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:57.310
I am your huckleberry.
And they see how many bags do you have?
When I say,
well,

197
00:11:57.311 --> 00:12:01.130
I got one
and that goes at your bag right there.
And I say,

198
00:12:01.131 --> 00:12:05.120
you know what it is that it is my bag.
And then when I,
I say,

199
00:12:05.121 --> 00:12:08.510
you don't need to pick it up,
it's got wheels on it.
It's not the fucking 70.

200
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.050
So we gotta be a God damn man,

201
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.330
have some sort of fucking forearm strike that can just carry this like a golf

202
00:12:14.331 --> 00:12:18.890
bag on one of those little wheely things.
We walked to the car,
I go to the hotel,

203
00:12:18.891 --> 00:12:22.280
I get a fucking burger,
go to sleep.
I get up in the morning,

204
00:12:22.281 --> 00:12:24.680
I do the fucking radio when that night to do the show and then I leave.

205
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:26.130
<v 4>Okay.</v>

206
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.150
<v 0>No boss,
no fucking inventory,</v>

207
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.610
no nothing.
I just got a dance like a monkey for a fucking hour.

208
00:12:35.611 --> 00:12:36.630
That's all I got to get my,

209
00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:41.220
I got to get my fucking monkey ass there and then I just do my thing and then I

210
00:12:41.221 --> 00:12:45.270
leave no bullshit,
no conference calls.

211
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:47.570
<v 4>Okay.</v>

212
00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.190
<v 0>No support system.</v>

213
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:51.543
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

214
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:54.800
<v 6>No friends,
no anybody else.
It's just me.</v>

215
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.850
It's not perfect.
Um,

216
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:07.110
<v 0>hey.
You know what?
I actually do have to fucking believe it or not,</v>

217
00:13:07.111 --> 00:13:09.670
I do have to take another flight this week.
I can't fucking believe it.
Uh,

218
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.310
because um,
uh,
yours truly as getting ready to,
uh,

219
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:19.340
pick a theater to a shoot is next special may Juneish I'm ready to go.

220
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.150
This hour is ready to go.
Ready to be recorded.

221
00:13:24.151 --> 00:13:27.150
Raised to be put the fucking bed to move on to the next one.

222
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.910
And um,
I'm not excited about going to the airport in I fucking lady,

223
00:13:32.911 --> 00:13:35.610
but I am excited to just fucking land and pick one.

224
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:40.830
I'm going to try to pick a theater that has a combination of the vibe where I

225
00:13:40.831 --> 00:13:45.831
feel like I'm going to kill in the room and the least Conti Union guys,

226
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.250
you know,
that's basically how I'm going to do it.
You know,

227
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.430
there's fucking union guys.
I'm so pro union,
it's ridiculous.

228
00:13:53.431 --> 00:13:55.110
And then you get around union guys and you're like,
oh,

229
00:13:55.111 --> 00:13:57.750
this is why people don't like you.
And yet,
you know.

230
00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.533
<v 4>Okay.</v>

231
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.910
<v 0>One of the times,
I can't remember which fucking special it was.</v>

232
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.860
I take the displace right.

233
00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:09.480
And they were acquired to have four guys working the stage.

234
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.600
Cause usually bands play there and I get it.
Okay.

235
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.140
So I gotta pay three guys who weren't going to do fucking shit.
But it's like,

236
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.600
can you at least have the decency to fuck off?

237
00:14:18.601 --> 00:14:22.140
Then go to a back room and play cards rather than just sitting there in the

238
00:14:22.141 --> 00:14:26.280
chair right out in the open.
Like,
look,
yeah.
Yay.

239
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.310
Are you doing shit and you're paying me,
you know,

240
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:34.290
just have a little fucking tact.
I get it.
It's your house,
your rules.

241
00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:36.300
I'm in your world,
but you know.

242
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:37.800
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

243
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.210
<v 0>Fucking unbelievable.
You've literally become what you were fighting.
I feel,</v>

244
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:47.010
you know,
maybe I'm just being a Dosha.
Oh,
now,
see now maybe I am,

245
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.980
I don't fucking know.
But uh,
that's what I'm doing this week.

246
00:14:49.981 --> 00:14:53.110
I'm going to pick out a venue and um,

247
00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.630
has always been the game plans that get the

248
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:03.050
figure out roughly what jokes I'm going to try and do and uh,

249
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.610
see what happens that night.

250
00:15:04.611 --> 00:15:08.390
And hopefully I'll do my last special because you know,

251
00:15:08.391 --> 00:15:11.660
you just compete against yourself.
That's all you could do.

252
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.790
Um,
all right.
This is the Monday morning podcast.
I,
uh,

253
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.720
I do one of these every single week and uh,

254
00:15:19.721 --> 00:15:22.810
I'm actually recording this Sunday night,
which is why,
um,

255
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.750
it came out a little bit earlier.
I usually record it Monday mornings,

256
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.470
wherever I'm at,
which is why it's called the Monday morning podcast.

257
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.690
Despite the fact that most people consider it,
well,

258
00:15:32.691 --> 00:15:37.670
it should be during mine one day.
You know,
the typical Internet cuts,

259
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.130
the demanding cuts,

260
00:15:39.131 --> 00:15:43.850
who then have turn around and have the nerve to look at celebrities and be like,

261
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.100
oh,
look at,
look at their diva ish behavior.

262
00:15:46.101 --> 00:15:50.690
And they don't see the seed of it in themselves.
You know what I mean?

263
00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:56.240
They don't see that,
you know,
if they actually had their own show,
that may be,

264
00:15:56.241 --> 00:16:00.920
they would be the content.
They never see it.
These internet comments never.

265
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.560
They never fucking see it.

266
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.810
They're the same fucking people that bitch about how there's no original movies

267
00:16:08.811 --> 00:16:13.811
coming out while they go to pirate bay and steal all the movies and nobody can

268
00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:15.620
make any fucking money.

269
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:19.460
So basically they're either gonna make like a low budget movie at this point.

270
00:16:19.461 --> 00:16:22.580
Are they gonna make a transformers?
Because even if you steal it,

271
00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:23.720
it's not going to be as cool.

272
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.410
I guess if you went down to the Imax and you saw the blue people trying to fuck

273
00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:30.170
each other with the umbilical cords,
whatever the fuck that movie was,

274
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.000
what was that called?
The Argo.
It began with an a action for,

275
00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.990
what the fuck was that movie called?
God dammit.

276
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.930
I used that as a reference for like two years.
Apocalypto

277
00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:45.130
<v 4>yeah,</v>

278
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.380
<v 0>whatever it was.
It was a fucking chick flick.</v>

279
00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:51.400
It was like if you took the smurfs and you're stretched them out,
you know,

280
00:16:51.401 --> 00:16:54.880
like that good times are that JJ allegedly was painting.

281
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:58.570
You remember that except you did that with the smarts and then they,

282
00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:02.860
they fucked each other and wrote a dragon.
I think somewhere in there,

283
00:17:02.861 --> 00:17:05.560
there was criticism about America's foreign policy.

284

You know,

312
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:47.990
that's like the afternoon hockey game,
right?
The team never fucking shows up.
Uh,

313
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.970
speaking of hockey,
how about those Bruins?
Huh?
Good Lord.

314
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:55.350
I knew that they were on a little run there when I was up in Canada and I saw a

315
00:18:55.351 --> 00:18:56.940
little bit of it,
but I was so damn busy,

316
00:18:56.941 --> 00:18:58.530
I didn't get to watch too many of the games,

317
00:18:58.531 --> 00:19:03.120
although I watched him kick the fucking habs asked for it and not in their own

318
00:19:03.121 --> 00:19:07.900
building.
Um,
yeah,
I believe they've won a,

319
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:11.010
like 13 in a row.
I watched the last two.

320
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.990
Wait,
look,
a,
they look at how many of they played Phoenix.
It gives a fuck,
right?

321
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.210
Phoenix.
And for the life of me,

322
00:19:18.211 --> 00:19:22.050
I can't remember who they played before that us after it's over,

323
00:19:22.051 --> 00:19:26.910
I don't fucking remember it anymore.
Um,
but either way,

324
00:19:26.911 --> 00:19:30.660
you know what I watched today and I actually,
if the bro,
you know,

325
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.430
if the Bruins don't get to the finals or whatever,
the,

326
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.260
the team that I'm going to root for this year to win the Stanley Cup is a,

327
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.040
is the Saint Louis Blues,
you know,

328
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.490
they've never want a cup.
Okay.

329
00:19:44.491 --> 00:19:48.060
And they've had a lot of bad years and they have great fans and they made a lot

330
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:51.090
of great moves and the,
you know,
they got Ryan Mellow,

331
00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.400
which was a strong move.
And uh,

332
00:19:54.401 --> 00:19:58.060
although I got to tell you if the way they played today against the penguins,

333
00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.670
if they're going to start doing that shit,

334
00:20:00.671 --> 00:20:02.770
it's going to be hard to fucking route for him.
You know,

335
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.540
why did they just open up the damn game again and everybody stopped fucking with

336
00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:12.460
this insane goddamn defense and block and the shots are ready.
You know,

337
00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.940
I actually looked up some stats this week,
believe it or not.

338
00:20:15.941 --> 00:20:18.490
I'm not just going to just make up shit.
I actually looked it up.

339
00:20:18.491 --> 00:20:22.570
Do you realize Sidney Crosby for all the fucking Goddamn glory they give that

340
00:20:22.571 --> 00:20:23.020
guy,

341
00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:28.020
he's only scored 50 goals in a season once Patrick Kane has never done it.

342
00:20:28.661 --> 00:20:33.370
A can,
I think has done it like twice.
It's a fucking disgrace.

343
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:35.560
<v 4>Okay.</v>

344
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.860
<v 3>I'm not saying it's on them,
just the way the game's played back in the day.</v>

345
00:20:38.861 --> 00:20:39.610
They'd be like four,

346
00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:43.210
five guys who get 50 goals a year for like four seasons in a row.

347
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:48.070
That was the height.
Fucking Gretzky was getting like 90 60

348
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.450
<v 0>it was fucking insane.
Guy scored like 300 goals and about five years.</v>

349
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:55.640
I always one of the greatest,
but I mean there was all those other guy.

350
00:20:55.641 --> 00:20:59.140
Mike Bossy was good for 50 a year for about three,
four years.

351
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.790
You just never see it anymore.
Oh,
fucking get it.

352
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.030
Fucking cock suckers,
man.

353
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:10.180
Bring in one of the phones back with a defense and it just gets boring after a

354
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:14.050
while.
Let them
score some goddamn goals.
All right.

355
00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.000
The train right there.
Trying to make the pads a little smaller.

356
00:21:19.001 --> 00:21:21.610
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Um,

357
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.430
<v 4>okay.</v>

358
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.130
<v 0>You know what's funny?
I really have nothing to talk about this week.</v>

359
00:21:26.131 --> 00:21:30.000
I just realized that Shit because I'm not doing anything.
I'm not doing anything.

360
00:21:30.001 --> 00:21:31.650
You know,
they finally started the construction,

361
00:21:31.651 --> 00:21:36.651
the rebuild downstairs after all the fucking bullshit,

362
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.930
the back and forth,
the back and forth,
the back in the fall.

363
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.110
It's literally a year later and now they're finally,
uh,
you know,

364
00:21:43.111 --> 00:21:46.110
they finished the upstairs room and then downstairs it was a bunch of crap,

365
00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:48.210
you know,
back and forth with that shit.

366
00:21:48.211 --> 00:21:52.470
So I finally got my insurance money back from my,
uh,
mortgage company.

367
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.730
I got all of it back.
And um,
for those of you in the banking system,

368
00:21:56.731 --> 00:22:01.290
you know what that means.
Um,
so they're actually,

369
00:22:01.291 --> 00:22:04.860
they're finally,
uh,
got to rebuild down there,
which is nice.

370
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.473
I'm excited.

371
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:12.110
But what sucks is everything from downstairs had to fucking come upstairs and

372
00:22:12.391 --> 00:22:15.960
it's an absolute shit show and it's depressing.
It's depressing,
you know?

373
00:22:15.961 --> 00:22:18.480
It's really depressing.
Not that that,
that they're doing this stuff,

374
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:23.510
it's so I just realized how much fucking shit and the key word is shit that I've

375
00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:29.730
saved over the years that I wish I never saved because now I can't throw it out.

376
00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.900
I had this thing where I would fucking any standup show I did if there was a

377
00:22:33.901 --> 00:22:35.250
comedy tee shirt,

378
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.930
I just folded it and I stuck it in a fucking plastic container.

379
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.490
And you know,
I've been doing it for 22 years now.
I have everything back

380
00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.680
from the first one I did.

381
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:49.510
<v 4>Okay.</v>

382
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:50.470
<v 0>Right on through.</v>

383
00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:51.900
<v 4>Okay.</v>

384
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:56.590
<v 0>I'm ain't got everything.
I got to Jim Norton down and dirty with Jim Norton,</v>

385
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.870
Hoodie,
zip up.
I mean,
I wouldn't throw that one out,

386
00:22:58.871 --> 00:23:00.940
but like some of the other ones,

387
00:23:00.941 --> 00:23:05.650
I have a bunch of comedy central shit and I can't throw it out because I'm

388
00:23:05.651 --> 00:23:07.810
sentimental and it,
but I'm never going to wear any of it.

389
00:23:07.811 --> 00:23:10.300
It's just going to sit in a fucking container until I die.

390
00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:20.490
Um,
so I got rid of all my cassette tapes,

391
00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:25.110
which was a big fucking move from me.
I'm a bit of a pack wreck,
pat rat,

392
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.610
like sentimental kind of thing.

393
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:31.050
My next move is I'm getting rid of all my fucking cds.
I'm just going to do it.

394
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.090
It's weird.
I get sad when I go to do it and then after I do it,

395
00:23:36.091 --> 00:23:39.330
I feel like this weight off of my chest like is a fucked up thing for you.

396
00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:43.210
When I did a,
uh,
long time ago,

397
00:23:43.211 --> 00:23:46.010
I did a Gig on TV and you know,

398
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.800
it's one of those deals when they had like a hundred comics did it.

399
00:23:48.801 --> 00:23:51.070
And one of the things they did was they give you a,

400
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.630
they gave you a nice piece of luggage,
which I always thought was funny.
Like,

401
00:23:56.631 --> 00:23:59.280
you know,
hey,
did the show,
great job.
Thanks for burning the material.

402
00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:02.930
I get back on the road,
you fucking hack because we own that material now.

403
00:24:02.931 --> 00:24:04.940
You know.
So,
um,

404
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.210
that was back in 2005 and the bag they gave me,

405
00:24:08.211 --> 00:24:13.211
it finally gave out where it was gradually repick oh fuck of Yardi care,

406
00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.010
who is gradually ripping.
And then finally my last flight from Newark,

407
00:24:19.011 --> 00:24:22.400
when it was coming down the belt,
I could literally see my clothes in it.

408
00:24:22.401 --> 00:24:24.940
So it was like,
all right,
it's time to get rid of this fucking thing.
Um,

409
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.230
of course I was going to try and get it repaired and get it sewed up.

410
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.980
And my wife was like,
don't,
why don't you just fucking buy a new one?
All right.

411
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:32.443
So I said,
fine.

412
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.040
So I actually took the bag over to goodwill today with some of the bullshit that

413
00:24:37.041 --> 00:24:42.041
I throw in there and I had to set it down quickly and walk away so I wouldn't be

414
00:24:42.081 --> 00:24:43.600
thinking of like,
but I

415
00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:48.420
<v 3>got that from that TV Gig.
I did a half hour.</v>

416
00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.580
It was important to me and that bag with the gift from it.

417
00:24:51.581 --> 00:24:52.960
Like I'm a fucking idiot.
Like that.

418
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:56.800
I literally walked up my set it down and the guy at goodwill goes,
thank you sir.

419
00:24:56.801 --> 00:24:59.740
You want a receipt and I was like,
no,
it's all good and I fucking,

420
00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.060
that'll run back to the car.

421
00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:07.600
I need to get over that.
I got to kick some shit out of the nest.

422
00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.040
I was in my garage.

423
00:25:09.041 --> 00:25:12.580
I've got a bunch of shit in there too that used to be in the place where that

424
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:17.560
flooded and I'm just looking at all of it,
all of the Games.
I went to,

425
00:25:17.561 --> 00:25:22.561
all of the programs and the hats and all that fucking crap that I got and I was

426
00:25:22.661 --> 00:25:24.250
just like from here on out.

427
00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:25.520
<v 0>Okay,</v>

428
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.640
<v 3>I go to a sporting event.
I just keep the ticket stub.</v>

429
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.670
I'm not getting anything else.
No more fucking programs,

430
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.970
no more hats than more hankies towels,

431
00:25:34.971 --> 00:25:39.590
any of that fucking shit because I just save it and I never look at it.

432
00:25:39.591 --> 00:25:40.500
I'm not going to lie.
I got up,

433
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:45.200
I have a fucking football program from a giant playoff game at the Meadowlands

434
00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:49.640
in 2002 played the vikings or some shit.
I don't know who the hell they play out.

435
00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.550
I never read it.
I didn't read it the day I got it.

436
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.810
Jim Fossils on the cover or something to fast [inaudible] fuck you say his name.

437
00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.310
He's on the cover.
I have never read the thing.
I'm never gunna read the thing.

438
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:02.750
<v 4>Okay.</v>

439
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:05.330
<v 3>If I actually took it and put it on fucking Ebay,</v>

440
00:26:05.331 --> 00:26:08.270
I could maybe get 40 cents for it.
What am I doing with it?

441
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:13.670
And for the rest of my life,
every time I move I'll get water damage.

442
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:18.170
I that's yet another thing I have to fucking pick up.
So if you're young,

443
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:19.953
<v 0>all right.</v>

444
00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:24.750
<v 3>And you just moved out of your parents' house and he got a little closet full of</v>

445
00:26:24.751 --> 00:26:27.150
shit.
Try to keep it at that.

446
00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:32.330
Sorry for the long pause on Yani here.

447
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.070
<v 0>Try to keep it at that.</v>

448
00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.400
<v 3>All right.
Because uh,
it's just,
it's just a bunch of shit.</v>

449
00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:44.640
I get old cell phones,
old flip phones.
Oh,
old fucking

450
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:48.390
<v 0>video recording things.
And I used,</v>

451
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:52.560
I got all these VHS tapes from when I first did stand up.

452
00:26:52.561 --> 00:26:56.000
Now I got to try and convert those to DVD and then what DVDs running out.

453
00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:58.650
I don't fucking know what to do with all of it.
Um,

454
00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:03.300
so I'm going to get rid of a bunch of shit is what I'm telling you.

455
00:27:03.301 --> 00:27:07.890
And then I'm going to,
I already,
I already fixed my tee shirt game where,

456
00:27:07.891 --> 00:27:09.600
because I'm a sentimental fool.

457
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.110
I don't buy tee shirts that say anything on them anymore.

458
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:18.120
I just bite plain gray,
black,
red,
white.
That's it.

459
00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.250
And when they were out there all pilly looking,

460
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.320
I just fucking toss 'em out and that's it.

461
00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:27.030
I don't remember where I wore them to what and then I'm good.
And uh,

462
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:28.790
<v 4>okay.</v>

463
00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:32.630
<v 0>That's it.
Why,
why am I going through all of this fucking shit?
I also think too,</v>

464
00:27:32.631 --> 00:27:37.630
you know,
the back of my head,
just as a married man now,

465
00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:40.510
you know,
the marriage is going great and everything,
but I'm just saying,

466
00:27:40.511 --> 00:27:44.240
you know,
if you have a good fucking divorced,
right,

467
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.460
get all your shit and get the fuck out.

468
00:27:46.461 --> 00:27:49.940
If you just walk in with like one army bag and just throw like five things in

469
00:27:49.941 --> 00:27:50.774
there and then you

470
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.010
just let her keep the rest of it.
Who gives a fuck?
Right.

471
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.110
You want all those knickknacks up before she just knick knacks.

472
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.740
Those knickknacks?
Is that what you want?
You want the drapes?

473
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:09.690
<v 4>Okay.</v>

474
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:14.510
<v 0>The throw pillows and all those fucking egg beaters and shit.
Fuck you want,</v>

475
00:28:14.511 --> 00:28:15.570
I can't go to Ikea.

476
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:20.850
Go buy a bastardized version of the fucking ridiculously nice shit that we had

477
00:28:20.851 --> 00:28:24.900
to buy for some stupid reason.
The dish out eggs and don't give a fuck.

478
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.140
I don't give a fuck.
Although I will tell you,

479
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:33.190
I don't think I could ever go back to apartment living.
You know,

480
00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:37.330
once you get out from fucking living under and over people and smelling their

481
00:28:37.331 --> 00:28:39.200
food and,

482
00:28:39.201 --> 00:28:42.370
and hearing their arguments and listen to their fucking music.

483
00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.510
Well why am I yawning so much?
Mary?

484
00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:50.530
Can you guys tonsils you waking you guys up for the work week?

485
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:52.040
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

486
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.650
<v 0>right?
You want to hear some petty shit and a fucking death level.</v>

487
00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.400
Did you guys see that Turkey shutdown when a serious jets

488
00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:04.870
serious basically in the middle of a civil war right now.
Right?

489
00:29:04.871 --> 00:29:07.780
So then they have an a battle right along the Turkish border.

490
00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:13.320
So they're in the middle of fighting a fight is Syrian jet pilot is fucking

491
00:29:13.481 --> 00:29:17.740
fighting rebels.
I'm not taking sides here.
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

492
00:29:17.741 --> 00:29:22.600
I know our countries with the fucking rebels and Russia's with the fucking,

493
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:24.280
uh,
powers that be,

494
00:29:24.281 --> 00:29:27.280
but I know both sides don't give a fuck about the Syrian people.

495
00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.410
They don't give a shit.
They don't give a fuck about me.

496
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.740
Why the fuck would they give a shit about CMV?
They gave a fuck about the money.

497
00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.260
That's what they give a shit about this district,

498
00:29:35.261 --> 00:29:39.940
the strategic bullshit of the fucking wherever the land is or whatever.

499
00:29:39.941 --> 00:29:41.920
That's what they give a fuck about.
So anyways,

500
00:29:41.921 --> 00:29:46.150
this pilot is fighting the good fight.
Okay?
And he's looking for rebels.

501
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.200
And then out of nowhere,

502
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:51.910
these two Turkish Jetson one comes in and fucking shoots a missile and,

503
00:29:51.911 --> 00:29:56.050
and whatever the fuck it shot at it.
And that shoots the damn plane down.

504
00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.850
That's like in hockey,
third man in as a 10 minute misconduct.

505
00:30:01.851 --> 00:30:03.050
That's a game misconduct.

506
00:30:03.051 --> 00:30:06.830
And that's probably a 10 game suspension or is that coming over the boards
first?

507
00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:10.230
I can't remember which,
but whatever.

508
00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.310
Turkey with third man in on Syria.
And I was like,
wow,

509
00:30:14.311 --> 00:30:16.020
what the fuck did they do that foreign series?

510
00:30:16.021 --> 00:30:19.920
Like how the fuck could you do that to us?
And then you know what Turkey said,

511
00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:24.300
hang on.
I got it.
There was actually some good shit.
Talk here by Turkey.

512
00:30:24.301 --> 00:30:27.570
I gotta I gotta give it up to Turkey this week.
Shit talker that week.

513
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:33.610
This is what they said.
Send a Syrian plane,

514
00:30:33.611 --> 00:30:38.530
violated our airspace or f sixteens took off and hit the plane.

515
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:41.800
Why?
Because if you violate my airspace,

516
00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.630
airspace are slap after.
This will be hard.

517
00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.750
I know something was lost in translation there.

518
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.490
<v 4>Okay.</v>

519
00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:58.970
<v 0>Um,
I liked that though.
I like the way the dude was going.</v>

520
00:30:58.971 --> 00:31:01.900
If you violate my air space,
you know,

521
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:07.820
like when they have like the,
the fucking grizzled vet cop,
you know,

522
00:31:07.821 --> 00:31:12.380
what is that?
What are those drugs do?
One on my street.
This is my street.

523
00:31:12.381 --> 00:31:16.910
You know that bullshit because if you violate my airspace are slap after.

524
00:31:16.911 --> 00:31:20.540
This will be hard now,
you know,
we didn't say it like that.

525
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.740
Some got lost in translation.
What were you really saying?

526
00:31:24.741 --> 00:31:26.490
Because if you violate my airspace,

527
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.550
I'm going to slap you right in your fucking Syrian face.
I know.

528
00:31:30.551 --> 00:31:33.870
What the fuck he said,
man,
that's too harsh.
So anyways,
that's what they said.

529
00:31:33.871 --> 00:31:36.360
So I read a little bit more and it turns out,
you know what?

530
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.650
Syria did this to Turkey like two fucking years ago.

531
00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:46.750
Turkey said we were just flying some fucking,
you know,
some,

532
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:52.300
uh,
learn how to fly a jet missions with our guys near the Turkey and Syria and

533
00:31:52.301 --> 00:31:56.230
border and series.
Like ow fuck you.
No you weren't.
You were spying on us.

534
00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:02.210
And they gave him the old right there,
Fred.
They gave him the old right,
right.

535
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:06.400
Have Fred,
they shut down their fucking jet.

536
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.260
So this is what they're doing over there.

537
00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:10.930
<v 4>Okay.</v>

538
00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:15.930
<v 0>That's like literally two children in the back seat talking about who touched</v>

539
00:32:17.081 --> 00:32:21.190
who first and there's shooting down people in jets.
Just fucking unreal.

540
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.810
You don't,
back in the day,

541
00:32:22.811 --> 00:32:26.140
I used to think people who ran countries and we're in a higher power,

542
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:30.620
there was just something at the core of them,
they will,
they would just,
uh,

543
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.823
<v 4>yeah,</v>

544
00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:35.460
<v 0>I dunno,
they will,
there was something wrong with them and that they will,</v>

545
00:32:35.461 --> 00:32:37.360
these evil people in all that type of shit.

546
00:32:37.361 --> 00:32:40.730
And if they just let regular people go doing their fucking thing and everything

547
00:32:40.731 --> 00:32:44.660
would be fine if they weren't so fucking greedy and start rumors about
everybody.

548
00:32:44.661 --> 00:32:48.380
And I don't believe it anymore.
I don't,

549
00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.610
I just think it's,
uh,
it's just human nature.

550
00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.350
The higher up you go,
the more power you get,
the more of a client you become.

551
00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:02.150
And eventually you get to the point where you have so much power that you want

552
00:33:02.151 --> 00:33:07.151
to fucking make the order to shoot something down as you're standing there and

553
00:33:07.461 --> 00:33:09.020
you fucking rope,
right.

554
00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:14.360
Open robe of course balls hanging out.
He got that red phone.

555
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.520
You just feeling the power coursing through your fucking veins.

556
00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:24.470
You know,
you smoke in a Cohiba.
Oh,
is that what they did?
Well,

557
00:33:24.471 --> 00:33:27.890
we're going to slap them bay.
You get to talk shit,
right?

558
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.770
You get to turn the world into your own fucking video game.

559
00:33:30.771 --> 00:33:31.820
That's what they're doing there.
You know,

560
00:33:31.821 --> 00:33:35.600
like those fucking Weirdos that play video games online and they weigh like

561
00:33:35.601 --> 00:33:39.650
those Mcdonald's headsets and they talk shit and they call each other bitches.

562
00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.340
You know,
as they play these war games,
these guys are doing that for real.

563
00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.650
I don't know what my fucking point is and all that.
I just think that,
uh,

564
00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.920
I know it's not an original theory.

565
00:33:51.921 --> 00:33:56.921
I really believe that we are designed to destroy ourselves eventually and it's

566
00:33:58.281 --> 00:33:59.900
going to happen.
All right.

567
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:05.110
And what you have to do as a selfish person like me is just pray that it doesn't

568
00:34:05.181 --> 00:34:08.750
happen during your lifetime or at least during the quality years.

569
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:10.363
<v 4>You know,</v>

570
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.860
<v 0>when he gets to those older years,
when you really start slowing down,</v>

571
00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:18.540
you're shuffling years before it becomes the sit down years.
Right.

572
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:23.580
And then the lay down years and then like the are right already years and then

573
00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:27.000
the fucking,
you know,
whatever.
Then the end,

574
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.250
I just hope it doesn't happen.
You know,

575
00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:35.040
I know the polar ice caps are gonna melt completely.

576
00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.940
I know we're not going to do anything about it.
I know New York City,

577
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:40.200
Miami and all them are going to be underwater.
I know it is.

578
00:34:40.201 --> 00:34:43.620
I just hope it's not during my lifetime.

579
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:48.440
I mean,
I recycle.
I bring back the cans and the bottles.

580
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:54.350
I do what I can.
I forget my little fucking recyclable bags.
I go with the paper,

581
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.190
the papers,
the papers,
right?
The fuck else am I going to do,

582
00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.333
<v 4>you know,</v>

583
00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.560
<v 0>I don't fucking know.
What do you guys think?
Do you guys think we're doomed?</v>

584
00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:08.490
Some people believe that we're going to,
we gotta do something fucking horrific,

585
00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.180
right?
And then when we come out of it,

586
00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:17.430
we're where somehow all collectively going to learn a lesson from it.

587
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:22.440
And then we're going to live in this utopia
and then Jesus comes back.

588
00:35:22.441 --> 00:35:24.840
I can't remember,
but there's so many fucking theories out there.

589
00:35:24.841 --> 00:35:27.660
But I just loved that whole theory that after we fuck it,

590
00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:33.080
have some sort of nuclear holocaust and we somehow survive it and we're sitting

591
00:35:33.721 --> 00:35:36.390
there eating glowing pairs that were somehow

592
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:41.870
<v 3>that the,
uh,
basically the,</v>

593
00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.580
you know,
what we are,
we're were defective.

594
00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.430
That somehow the defect was just going to repair itself.

595
00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:49.410
That we're not going to be petty.
We're not going to be jealous.

596
00:35:49.411 --> 00:35:53.090
I'm not gonna be lustful,
you know,
all the seven deadly sins,

597
00:35:53.091 --> 00:35:57.470
whatever the fuck they are,
you know,
like that cures that.

598
00:35:57.490 --> 00:35:59.740
I don't think it does.
I don't think it does.

599
00:35:59.741 --> 00:36:02.390
And that's my gloom and doom for this week.
Everybody,
I think we're,

600
00:36:02.391 --> 00:36:06.410
I think we're fucked.
We don't have a goddamn prayer.
But going back,

601
00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:09.770
I am a rooting for the Saint Louis Blues in the West.
I'm rooting for him.

602
00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.600
I like Chicago.
I like Saint Louis.

603
00:36:11.601 --> 00:36:15.980
I like the fucking West for some reason I'm liking the ducks.
I don't know why.

604
00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:19.280
I know why.
TEEMU Salani I just liked that guy.

605
00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:22.460
I liked the fact that he weighs less than he did when he fucking was a rookie.

606
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:25.340
Something to aspire to.
Um,

607
00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:31.670
who else do I like out there?
I never got into San Jose,

608
00:36:31.671 --> 00:36:34.640
although I respect if fans,
I went to a home game,
the fucking rabid.

609
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:38.510
Um,
I like the kings.

610
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:44.380
Um,
I,
I kind of liked Vancouver until we played him in the finals,

611
00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:48.190
that little jerk off the bite and what's his face on his finger?

612
00:36:48.191 --> 00:36:53.050
And I was kind of weird.
Um,
yeah,
I just liked the west.

613
00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:56.170
The West was cool when I was growing up.
They were good.
Admin team was good.

614
00:36:56.171 --> 00:36:59.560
Calgary was good.
Uh,
I was,

615
00:36:59.561 --> 00:37:04.150
can't do the king sucked until Gretzky got there.
They had their moments though,

616
00:37:04.151 --> 00:37:06.400
right?
I know what the fuck I'm talking about.
But the blues,

617
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:11.320
the blues were always,
you know,
expansion six,
just never caught a break.

618
00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:13.580
Avocado fuck a break.
So that do,

619
00:37:13.581 --> 00:37:16.840
so that's the team that I'm going to fucking route four.
All right.
And with that,

620
00:37:16.841 --> 00:37:18.550
let's get to some questions.
Mercifully,

621
00:37:18.551 --> 00:37:21.820
let's get to fucking some goddamn questions this week.

622
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:25.660
Let's see if I can try and make an hour.
I've already looked at it like 10 times.

623
00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.770
All right,
37 minutes.

624
00:37:26.771 --> 00:37:31.180
Can I do 23 minutes a bullshit through all of these,
uh,

625
00:37:31.181 --> 00:37:34.120
these questions here.
All right.
Match madness.

626
00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:39.160
Dear Billy brackets.
I'm not a huge college sports fan.

627
00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.710
I love sports so I can enjoy a good game,

628
00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.980
but I'm not interested in following a season.

629
00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.340
March madness is fun for anyone because of the brackets.

630
00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:53.110
If there was another game on a national level with bracket talk and exposure,

631
00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:57.250
you could have a chat.
You could have chest be interesting to watch on TV.

632
00:37:57.251 --> 00:37:59.860
Agree or disagree.
100% agree.

633
00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.450
100% agree.
If that's like a great idea.

634
00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.050
If they actually had whatever,
I don't even know when the,
the,

635
00:38:08.051 --> 00:38:10.660
the international chess championship is,

636
00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:15.820
but if they set up brackets and they had like,
you know,
four regions,

637
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:19.430
you know,
you broke up,
uh,
the,

638
00:38:19.431 --> 00:38:24.430
the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere and the sides of the world.

639
00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.970
And he had number one seeds and all that type of Shit Apps,

640
00:38:27.971 --> 00:38:31.480
a Fuckin lutely if he had brackets,
you know,

641
00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:36.490
I went a hundred percent agree with that.
And,
um,
I haven't really watched shit.

642
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:41.020
I watch a little bit of a tar heel game today and then I fell asleep because,
uh,

643
00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:46.030
I'm fucking old man.
Um,
but I,

644
00:38:46.031 --> 00:38:49.870
I haven't been following any of it,
any of it,
you know,

645
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:54.550
download the suite six day,
the grade eight,
the final four.
I mean,

646
00:38:54.551 --> 00:38:58.090
I know it's amazing.
I just don't,
uh,
I don't have time.

647
00:38:58.091 --> 00:39:00.430
I have too much fucking invested in the,
uh,

648
00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.510
watching hockey and it's coming down to it.
And I,
uh,

649
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.370
I like watching you don't,
so we don't set,
number one,
a big criticism,

650
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:12.260
especially if people who don't watch hockey.
And on.

651
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.180
Another way I'm going to defend the fucking sport is people say that the regular

652
00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:17.500
season doesn't mean shit.

653
00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:21.430
It's one of the biggest criticisms that gets a regular season judging me.
Jet.

654
00:39:21.431 --> 00:39:26.080
Everybody makes the fucking playoffs.
Yeah.
Kind of like in basketball.

655
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:27.430
<v 4>Okay.</v>

656
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:28.570
<v 3>How about baseball?</v>

657
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:33.600
Do you really need to play 162 fucking games to figure out a Windsor Division?

658
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:37.960
You know,
and then after all that bull shit,

659
00:39:37.961 --> 00:39:39.730
someone's still going to get a wild card.

660
00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:41.660
<v 4>Okay.</v>

661
00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:42.493
<v 3>We come on</v>

662
00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.140
the only regular season of the four major sports.
That means anything.

663
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:51.590
It's football.
That's why it's so fucking exciting.
It even,

664
00:39:51.591 --> 00:39:56.420
they are going to fuck that up.
They should have just left it on Sunday.

665
00:39:56.450 --> 00:40:00.980
The Monday night game fine,
but Sunday you play every fucking Sunday.

666
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:05.750
You don't get a day off.
You play every fucking Sunday.
You don't get a week off.

667
00:40:05.751 --> 00:40:08.370
I mean they just did that to prolong the fucking season.

668
00:40:08.371 --> 00:40:12.170
So they get advertised more now they're going to start working in Thursday
night.

669
00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:15.200
They're going to try to somehow,
if they can figure it out,

670
00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:19.100
they're going to fucking try and do it at least four to five times a God damn

671
00:40:19.101 --> 00:40:23.330
week,
and it's going to ruin the sport.
Just going to ruin it.

672
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:28.820
All right?
And it's because millionaires can't be happy being millionaires.

673
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.620
They have to try to be billionaires.

674
00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:33.800
And then they got treated to try to be multibillionaires and then they got to

675
00:40:33.801 --> 00:40:37.730
try to go global and they just can't just fucking,
just be like,
Hey,

676
00:40:37.731 --> 00:40:41.960
you know what?
I have enough.
You know,
look at my car,

677
00:40:41.961 --> 00:40:46.820
look at my house,
look at that fucking,
ah,
look at my wife.
Look at her.

678
00:40:46.821 --> 00:40:50.660
She's bending over.
Look at her.
It's my wife.
She had three kids with a good,

679
00:40:50.661 --> 00:40:55.520
she looks,
you know,
that's not enough.
You just got to keep fucking going.

680
00:40:56.350 --> 00:41:00.790
Um,
but yeah,
but that's one of the major things.
Will they say that the,
uh,

681
00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:05.460
the regular season doesn't mean shit?
Um,
I disagree.

682
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:10.350
I know what you mean.
We're fucking a ton of teams make it,
but uh,
you know,

683
00:41:10.351 --> 00:41:12.570
have to take after league.
Doesn't fucking make it.

684
00:41:12.571 --> 00:41:14.730
I don't want to tell you that's the same way at basketball,

685
00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.290
but they don't say that about basketball.

686
00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:23.850
Basketball is the exact same fucking thing.
And the end of the gay,

687
00:41:23.851 --> 00:41:28.380
what it's most,
the,
the most exciting part of the game.
Two minutes to go.

688
00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:33.260
You're up by three.
They stopped the clock like 58 fucking times.

689
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:37.930
<v 6>File file,
file timeout,
file,
TV timeout,</v>

690
00:41:37.931 --> 00:41:39.550
technical foul

691
00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.180
<v 3>kicked the ball,
went off his foot.</v>

692
00:41:43.181 --> 00:41:47.800
It just fucking the final two minutes of an NBA game.
I swear to God,

693
00:41:47.801 --> 00:41:51.160
it takes like fucking 18 minutes to play and it destroys.

694
00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:53.650
It's even funny at all the drama.

695
00:41:53.651 --> 00:41:56.920
It's even funnier when you go to a fucking NBA game.

696
00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:02.470
It'll be a gay with playoff implications in anytime there's a stoppage of play,

697
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.150
all hell breaks loose and these fucking shit heads go out and start doing,

698
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.233
uh,

699
00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:12.850
jump a Jackson shooting tee shirts and then they start playing like music way

700
00:42:12.851 --> 00:42:17.320
too fucking loud and it completely takes you out of,
uh,

701
00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:22.150
the drama,
the game.
So I dunno,

702
00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:26.030
whatever,
whatever.
I don't even know why I'm fucking bringing this shit up.

703
00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:29.360
You know why?
Because people who don't watch hockey don't even understand it,

704
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.080
shit all over it.
Whether they have to have times,

705
00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.110
have you ever played first of all and it mathematically it doesn't fucking make

706
00:42:36.111 --> 00:42:39.560
sense,
says not to halftime's.
Okay,
there's two 33rd and a third times.

707
00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:40.791
That's what you want to say.

708
00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:44.540
33rd a third time and then it's a fucking 66 and two thirds time.

709
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:49.190
That's what you want to say.
Um,
if you have a plate your fuck after one shift,

710
00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:54.150
your heart is fucking about ready to come out of your chest.
That's why.
Um,

711
00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:58.970
all right.
Boring.
Here we go.
I'm probably talking about the podcast here.

712
00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:04.010
A dare billion of 25 years old and graduated college a few years ago and had

713
00:43:04.401 --> 00:43:09.320
been living in Chicago since.
I hate it.
Matty h Chicago man.

714
00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.820
He goes,
it's not that Chicago,
is it a great city,
but what,
what it is,

715
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:19.280
but,
but what is it that happens to people when they get in their twenties and

716
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.350
thirties they enjoy the dumbest shit.

717
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.790
I don't want to go to the same bar and taxi around and get food.

718
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:29.300
No one seems to be interested in anything fun anymore.

719
00:43:29.301 --> 00:43:32.330
The only exercise my friends get is that the gym,

720
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.720
and they don't do anything fun like basketball and none of them are in good

721
00:43:35.721 --> 00:43:38.120
shape because they're on their asses all day.

722
00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:41.600
Everyone is a boring Cielo.
Uh,

723
00:43:41.601 --> 00:43:46.040
there was no spice in their life,
in their lives.
Am I an asshole or are they,

724
00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.580
um,
neither.

725
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.850
It's all about what makes you happy.

726
00:43:52.851 --> 00:43:55.820
The people you're hanging out with aren't doing the things that you want to do,

727
00:43:55.821 --> 00:43:57.440
so you're not happy hanging out with them,

728
00:43:57.441 --> 00:44:02.270
but they sound happy as hell to go to the gym and then sit on their ass and he'd

729
00:44:02.271 --> 00:44:06.560
have a beer and eat some fucking Nachos.
And if that's what makes them happy,

730
00:44:06.561 --> 00:44:10.100
they're entitled to it.
What you need to do,
sir or ma'am,

731
00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.530
is you need to go find yourself some new French.

732
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:16.100
You got to go find some active people.
I mean,
there's plenty of,

733
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:19.610
you're telling me there's nobody in there.
I'll in Chicago,
there's no,

734
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:24.970
there's not 19,000 fucking pick pickup leaves a hoop hockey flag,

735
00:44:25.461 --> 00:44:29.630
football,
walleyball water polo,
rugby.

736
00:44:29.631 --> 00:44:31.470
There's all kinds of shit you could be doing.

737
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.040
<v 0>And,
uh,
if I was 25 years old,</v>

738
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:39.120
I would get into a coed league,
coed fucking league.

739
00:44:39.121 --> 00:44:43.860
You find yourself a pretty girl that likes sports.
You like sports,

740
00:44:43.861 --> 00:44:47.850
she's active,
your active,
you know,
you got a Dick,

741
00:44:47.851 --> 00:44:52.800
she got a vagina.
Yeah.
That way you go,
what more do you need?

742
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:58.590
Right.
Fuck,
if I go back and be 25 years old again,

743
00:44:58.591 --> 00:45:03.510
I take up field hockey.
The chicks always had fucking beautiful legs,

744
00:45:03.511 --> 00:45:07.850
right?
The TANF fucking thighs,
you know,
short haircuts.

745
00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.670
You gotta be like,
all right,
he's still into me.
Are you a Canadian?

746
00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:15.060
To while the same check I'm staring at it,
I'll be your wing man.

747
00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:17.330
Fucking can I watch,
um,

748
00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:23.370
yeah,
dude,
you're not an asshole.
What it is,

749
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:28.400
is you've decided to continue living an active life at 25 years old as opposed

750
00:45:29.971 --> 00:45:34.890
to just settling in.
You know,
certain people out there,

751
00:45:34.891 --> 00:45:39.740
they get a,
they get old.
They just get fucking,
I mean,

752
00:45:39.741 --> 00:45:43.920
there's a party that you,
you know,
getting old,
you can kind of accept it.
Um,

753
00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.460
like I view,
uh,
I love living like an old man.

754
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:51.900
If it means being smart,
like a,

755
00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:53.750
<v 4>okay.</v>

756
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:57.380
<v 0>Like take it like,
you know,
like if I want to get shit faced.</v>

757
00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:01.010
All right.
Which I do.

758
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:03.800
I don't know if you guys listened to his podcast every week,

759
00:46:03.801 --> 00:46:08.130
but I like to go out and get,
I like to get fucking hammered.
Um,

760
00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:13.990
I just do it at my house.
Your house is the greatest fucking bar.

761
00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.650
You could have a Ba if you're an eight,
if you're in your fucking house.

762
00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:20.230
I don't have upstairs,
downstairs neighbors.
Nothing.
Okay.

763
00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:24.850
I got a wife and a dog and I'm stronger than both of them.
All right.

764
00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:27.400
Well my dog could fuck me up,
but it doesn't realize it.

765
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:31.410
It loves me so much that it would never turn his pit bull power zone.

766
00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:34.770
But as far as my wife,
I mean,
I'll take it down to the mat.
Right.

767
00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.000
And you can tell her I said that.
Um,

768
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:39.580
so if I want to get fucked up in my own house,
I'm going to do it.

769
00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:43.780
I can fucking put it on the music.
I want to put on,
I can pop in a DVD,

770
00:46:43.781 --> 00:46:46.450
watch a little bit.
Good fellas.
I don't have to deal.

771
00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:48.203
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

772
00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:52.130
<v 0>I didn't know what the fuck I'm talking about right now.
I mean,</v>

773
00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:57.340
to me like the way to get shit faced now is for me to be hanging with one other

774
00:46:57.411 --> 00:46:59.510
friend on my front porch,

775
00:46:59.511 --> 00:47:04.511
smoking a cigar and drinking some scotch and listen to some fucking music and

776
00:47:04.521 --> 00:47:08.210
just shooting the shit.
It's quiet,
you know?

777
00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:09.680
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

778
00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.170
<v 0>When you're younger,
I guess you want the Shit Louder and that type of thing,</v>

779
00:47:12.171 --> 00:47:15.770
but whatever.
But like to me,
I don't feel like an old man doing that.

780
00:47:15.771 --> 00:47:18.920
I just feel like I'm smarter.
Like back in the day,
I used to go into a club,

781
00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:23.450
damaging my hearing in the fucking music was loud and all that type of shit.

782
00:47:23.451 --> 00:47:27.050
But that worked for me back then because I did not as talked to the lady,

783
00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.450
by all means drown

784
00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:33.480
<v 3>out the horrible shit that's coming out of my mouth.
Oh.</v>

785
00:47:33.481 --> 00:47:37.280
With my Zeke have a reaches.
What was I doing?
Uh,

786
00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:42.400
but uh,
yeah.
Don't you know what?
25 is a,

787
00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:43.880
<v 4>okay,</v>

788
00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:48.380
<v 3>that's a great age.
And uh,
it's a critical age.</v>

789
00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:49.041
Well,

790
00:47:49.041 --> 00:47:52.910
you're starting to surround yourself with the people that you're really going to

791
00:47:52.911 --> 00:47:54.530
be hanging out with for the rest of your life.

792
00:47:54.531 --> 00:47:58.940
You kind of left most of your high school friends behind.
I'm not in a bad way.

793
00:47:58.941 --> 00:48:01.040
He just,
your paths don't cross anymore,

794
00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:04.310
so you're going to get some new friends and a,
yeah.

795
00:48:04.311 --> 00:48:06.560
Get friends who want to fucking live life.

796
00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:10.370
We want to go do some shit other than,
you know,
hey,

797
00:48:10.371 --> 00:48:14.510
let's go to fucking whatever the fuck they,
what do people go?

798
00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:18.860
What do they go?
Cabos,
St Lucas,
whatever the foil would,
those hacky places.

799
00:48:18.861 --> 00:48:19.221
Everybody.

800
00:48:19.221 --> 00:48:23.000
Let's go into a robot that places everybody goes and then they go there.

801
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:27.050
They jump off a bar stool in Chicago and then they jump on a bar stool in a,

802
00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:28.520
in a fucking bar pool.

803
00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:29.850
<v 4>Okay.</v>

804
00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:31.680
<v 3>It's sit there,
right?
Isn't that great?</v>

805
00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:36.740
It's not as cold and I can piss myself without going to the fucking bathroom.

806
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:39.240
But we live in a what it's like now,

807
00:48:39.241 --> 00:48:41.550
what kind of doing the same thing in better weather,

808
00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:43.200
better scenery and that type of thing.

809
00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:45.750
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

810
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:46.200
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

811
00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:49.560
If you go to Ruby's should get outside the fucking place and walk around and

812
00:48:49.561 --> 00:48:51.570
hopefully not get murdered like that check,
you know,

813
00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:56.250
and then I'll go find a waterfall and jerk off in it.
You don't enjoy the planet.

814
00:48:57.230 --> 00:49:01.500
All right.
Prince Harry,
Prince Harry,
uh,

815
00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:05.010
not sure if you heard this recently,
but Prince Harry came out,

816
00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:07.350
I think we say came out of the closet.
I was like,
Jesus Christ.

817
00:49:07.351 --> 00:49:11.340
I got to start watching the news.
He came out and said something to his brother,

818
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:13.980
the future king that he's not going to be king,

819
00:49:13.981 --> 00:49:18.540
so he doesn't need to be on his best behavior.
Dude,
that's fucking great.

820
00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:21.080
<v 4>Okay.</v>

821
00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:24.920
<v 3>You know,
other than his fucking dressing up like a fucking ss officer,</v>

822
00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:28.670
I don't have a problem with that kid.
Uh,
my question to you is,

823
00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.940
it's kind of a major other than that time he dressed like Hitler and I,

824
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:35.720
these bad guy.
Uh,
my question to you is,

825
00:49:35.721 --> 00:49:40.310
what happened if he began to speak out against a trust cities in the world,

826
00:49:40.311 --> 00:49:44.570
like his mother or call out bankers and evil bastards running the world's

827
00:49:44.571 --> 00:49:48.920
resources,
would they bump him off?
Uh,
yeah.
Apps a fucking Lilly.

828
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:53.610
Oh,
it did.
I call it fucking bit coin thing.

829
00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:57.790
People telling me to get on that.
You've got to invest in this bit coin thing.

830
00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:00.650
They're going to take that thing down there.

831
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:04.240
They're going to ignore it and laugh at it first.
Just like Gandhi,
you know,

832
00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:10.120
first they ignore you,
then they laugh at you.
Then they fight you,
then you win.

833
00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.010
Right.
Isn't that wow?
It goes something like that.

834
00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:16.510
I don't know where to fucking go sport,
whatever.
That bitcoin's shit.
You know?

835
00:50:16.511 --> 00:50:17.590
I'm sure the banks are like that.

836
00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.930
I don't think that it's going to be a viable career.
Me,
I won't,
you know,
Jared,

837
00:50:21.931 --> 00:50:26.500
they did all that shit,
right?
Then they started,
you know,
going,
Oh shit.
Oh Shit.

838
00:50:26.501 --> 00:50:27.590
They get a little bit of traction.

839
00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:31.550
People were talking about this stuff and then what happens?
What happens?

840
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:34.100
Somebody commits suicide.

841
00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:35.220
<v 6>Okay.</v>

842
00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:38.640
<v 0>Conveniently,
conveniently,
and everybody rounds going,
hey,</v>

843
00:50:38.641 --> 00:50:40.840
it doesn't seem like that person commit suicide.
What?
Yeah,

844
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:43.230
that's what happens when you try to start a new currency.

845
00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:44.430
<v 4>Okay.</v>

846
00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:45.540
<v 3>You don't,
what do you think's going to happen?</v>

847
00:50:45.541 --> 00:50:49.470
Do you think these fucking Fuddy duddies I'm gonna fucking Fuddy duddy.

848
00:50:49.471 --> 00:50:53.280
So whatever you say is going to sit around and tolerate that.
The kid,

849
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:59.540
their whole live lives are,
are,
are invested in the lie of their currency.

850
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.270
You can't come along with a new lie.

851
00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:04.270
<v 4>Okay?</v>

852
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:08.310
<v 3>Then they got to start all over again.
It's like a red sox fan,</v>

853
00:51:08.311 --> 00:51:10.830
but come on a Yankee Fan.
It's not going to happen.
It's not even a Yankee Fan.

854
00:51:10.831 --> 00:51:12.510
It's going to be,
give me a whole new fucking league,

855
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:17.640
like the XFL eight happening.
Go Fuck Yourself.
The NFL was the,

856
00:51:17.641 --> 00:51:21.270
was where we got our money.
Fuck your league.

857
00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.390
Uh,
so anyways,
yeah.

858
00:51:24.391 --> 00:51:27.960
Do I think if he started speaking out against the atrocities a notch,

859
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:32.740
if he just started speaking out against atrocities,
I don't think,
uh,

860
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:37.700
what they do is they join it like Kennedy with the civil rights.

861
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:40.940
We can't control a million African Americans coming into Washington.

862
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:44.270
What do we do?
We join it and then we'd take control of it.

863
00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.910
And then you give you permits and the next thing you know,

864
00:51:46.911 --> 00:51:49.970
they control the fucking thing,
right?
That's what they would do.

865
00:51:49.971 --> 00:51:53.780
They would just join,
you know,
prince,
Prince,
uh,
whatever the fuck his name is.

866
00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:59.060
Dale was his brother's name.
George.
That's a good king name.

867
00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:05.860
<v 0>The fuck is his name.
Christopher Harry.
And uh,</v>

868
00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:10.390
all right.
If I'm lady die,
if I,
if I was dumb enough to name my,
my second kid,

869
00:52:10.391 --> 00:52:15.080
Harry,
I guess the other one had to be a little bit better,

870
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:20.030
Larry.
Nah,
there's no way you're going to have to get kids names.
Orion.

871
00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:25.090
What the fuck would his name be?
It's gotta be some English,

872
00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:31.620
some fucking proper.
Not Louie.

873
00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:36.000
That's French.
Is that Henry?

874
00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:41.190
Was Henry.
Is Harry a nickname for Henry out?
Fucking know George.

875
00:52:41.191 --> 00:52:43.800
I'm gonna go with George,
not Jesus.

876
00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:47.100
I feel like the the number five in the line of the family feud.

877
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:51.570
You know when the first person one,
whatever category it is,

878
00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:54.100
and he said the obvious one.
And then somebody,

879
00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:56.190
the second person said what I was thinking of,

880
00:52:56.670 --> 00:53:00.450
and then three and four somehow didn't get strikes and now it's down to me and

881
00:53:00.451 --> 00:53:02.040
there's like no fucking answer left.

882
00:53:02.041 --> 00:53:05.910
I'm going with George and everybody just looks at me and go,
hey,
good answer.

883
00:53:05.911 --> 00:53:10.770
Good answer.
Right.
Survey says big fucking x.

884
00:53:10.771 --> 00:53:12.330
And then the other team fucking steals it.

885
00:53:12.331 --> 00:53:13.920
And then nobody talks to me at Christmas.

886
00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:15.123
<v 6>MMM.</v>

887
00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:20.570
<v 3>Yeah.
The only way that he would actually get whacked is it Philip?</v>

888
00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:25.560
<v 6>Yeah,
yeah,</v>

889
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:32.260
<v 0>yeah,
yeah.</v>

890
00:53:32.261 --> 00:53:35.920
Geez.
What the fuck is she?
Good.
I tell you,
you know the,
the,

891
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:37.130
they're never around when you need them.

892
00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:40.660
<v 3>Fuck up by talking about,
got the Internet right here.</v>

893
00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:45.910
Is it Charlie Charles?
Is he named after his dad?

894
00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:52.690
<v 0>The fuck is his name.
Prince.
I'm just gonna look in Prince.</v>

895
00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:58.040
Prince
Harry.

896
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:04.580
No possess,
no,
not possessive.
Harry's brother.

897
00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:11.600
I don't know.
His fucking name is Prince Harry's brother

898
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:18.070
<v 3>William.
It's my fucking day.
What an asshole.
Oh,</v>

899
00:54:18.071 --> 00:54:22.360
Billy Prince William Doak of Cambridge.
Go Fuck Yourself.

900
00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:26.550
You're name's Billy.
A belly.
Oh,

901
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:29.290
what are you going to go ride a horse today with your little fucking stick

902
00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:31.870
leaning over,
you know,

903
00:54:31.871 --> 00:54:35.080
be careful too dangerous God damn game.

904
00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:39.610
Prince William.
Uh,
yeah,
they'd whack them either.

905
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:41.920
The only way they would whack them as if he was effective,

906
00:54:42.790 --> 00:54:47.560
if when they went to join them,
join his,
yeah,
we're sick of that shit too.

907
00:54:47.561 --> 00:54:47.980
That we're,

908
00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:52.450
but we've created or what it was already created and now we have positions,

909
00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:56.680
they pass the baton to us and we're continuing to oppress people.

910
00:54:56.681 --> 00:54:59.830
But that's how we make money.
So we can have a BMW seven series,

911
00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.920
right with the bulletproof fucking glass.
Um,

912
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:06.730
they would join with him and if he said,
no,
you're part of the fucking problem.

913
00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:10.510
And then try,
do it.
Literally attack the sectors that those people were in,

914
00:55:10.511 --> 00:55:14.140
he would definitely get whacked a,
he would die mysteriously.

915
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:18.670
He'd probably commit suicide air quote.
Um,

916
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.130
<v 4>okay.</v>

917
00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:23.360
<v 0>He would have some sort of,
I dunno,
they,
you know,
they,
you know what they do?</v>

918
00:55:23.361 --> 00:55:24.530
What they spray the mist at?
Yeah.

919
00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:27.290
And then you have some sort of fucking they talk about.
Yeah.

920
00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:31.040
He had a hole in his heart that they had never diagnosed before in the head or

921
00:55:31.041 --> 00:55:35.700
rhythmia.
He had a cardiac episode II,

922
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:38.561
I don't know.
Then the,

923
00:55:38.561 --> 00:55:42.610
then the conspiracy theory would come out and then all the other fucking moron

924
00:55:42.611 --> 00:55:45.070
mouth breathing,
conspiracy theories would muddy up.

925
00:55:45.071 --> 00:55:47.870
The real conspiracy theory in the whole fucking thing would go away.
That,

926
00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:52.360
that's my guess.
There you go.
That's my guess.
Jesus Christ.

927
00:55:52.361 --> 00:55:56.500
I almost did it.
55 fucking minutes.
55 minutes.

928
00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.990
How are you guys doing?
Hey,
you listen to this early.
What is it?

929
00:55:58.991 --> 00:56:02.800
10 30 in the morning getting ready for your break.
It's a roach coach.
Pullin up.

930
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:06.700
You got to go get some Drake's cakes.
No,
fucking sausage king.

931
00:56:06.701 --> 00:56:07.580
Is that what you're going to do?

932
00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.240
<v 3>All right.
Live forever.
Forever.
Forever.
Forever.</v>

933
00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:17.660
Live forever.
Billy infinity.
I hate when people,

934
00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:22.040
I hear people say,
who would want to live that long?
Uh,

935
00:56:22.041 --> 00:56:24.850
I guess he's referring,
she's referring to when someone is like,

936
00:56:24.851 --> 00:56:27.340
just they just turn 102 who,
who'd want to live a look?

937
00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:32.410
A this guy says give me a pulse as long as possible to people who say they

938
00:56:32.411 --> 00:56:36.820
wouldn't want to live forever.
What do you say to that?
Uh,
well,

939
00:56:36.821 --> 00:56:39.550
I mean it comes down to quality of life.
I mean,

940
00:56:39.551 --> 00:56:42.970
the human body is designed to live for 150 years.

941
00:56:42.971 --> 00:56:46.090
And then after all the abuse that we do to what you usually drop it above

942
00:56:46.091 --> 00:56:49.900
fucking I guess 75.
Um,

943
00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:53.653
I mean,

944
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:58.990
I wouldn't want to live forever if like I was just sitting there like looking

945
00:56:59.331 --> 00:57:00.020
like Yoda,

946
00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:03.690
but without his fucking ability to flip around the room with a light saber.

947
00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:07.730
Um,
what I want to live forever.

948
00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:11.650
MMM.

949
00:57:15.590 --> 00:57:19.820
Yeah.
If there's nothing after this,
fuck yeah.
But I mean,
you know,

950
00:57:19.850 --> 00:57:21.740
but then what you do is you,
you would,

951
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:26.300
you would watch a slowly kill ourselves and then we would become extinct and

952
00:57:26.301 --> 00:57:30.950
then you'd be the only one left and then they'd be the next people.
Right.

953
00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.950
Like I've told you guys my theory,
right,
that I,

954
00:57:33.951 --> 00:57:38.951
I feel like water is the toxic waste from the last people that fucked up this

955
00:57:39.111 --> 00:57:44.090
planet.
And that is absolutely poisonous and toxic to them.
But we,
we,

956
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:46.910
we came out of it,
you know,

957
00:57:46.911 --> 00:57:48.650
and we're walking around thinking of what good looking,

958
00:57:48.651 --> 00:57:52.040
but we're all a bunch of fucking mutants compared to the last people when we

959
00:57:52.041 --> 00:57:54.770
don't know any better because we can't look at them,
right?

960
00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:59.960
So when we're done fucking up this planet,
the next people will come out of the,

961
00:57:59.961 --> 00:58:04.730
out of the soup that we leave,
which will have plastics and fucking,
uh,
you know,

962
00:58:04.731 --> 00:58:08.900
old computers and all that shit.
God knows what the fuck they going to look like.

963
00:58:08.901 --> 00:58:12.750
You know,
like,
I don't even know.

964
00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:16.440
But you know,
if you live forever,
you'd be around for them.

965
00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:17.920
<v 4>Okay.</v>

966
00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:19.480
<v 3>No,
I wouldn't want to live forever.</v>

967
00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:24.330
I wouldn't want to live forever because I think eventually as planned,

968
00:58:24.331 --> 00:58:29.070
it's going to look like Mars and then you would just be sitting there.
Well,

969
00:58:29.071 --> 00:58:33.360
what would you do?
Shit.
And they're kicking fucking moon rocks around forever.

970
00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:38.400
That's fucking scary.
Do you just couldn't die.

971
00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:47.660
I Dunno what I do.
You know what I do is I would try to wait.

972
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:50.010
There's no,
there's no technology to do it.

973
00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:53.100
I would get a fucking spaceship and fly to the next earth

974
00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:58.080
and I had land there and hope that they kind of looked like me.

975
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:02.080
It wasn't the dinosaur period or whatever.
And you know,
this is it.

976
00:59:02.081 --> 00:59:06.050
Like some of them was saying there's like a,
you know,

977
00:59:06.051 --> 00:59:07.730
there's a bunch of earth's out there,

978
00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:12.050
tens of thousands of them throughout the fucking space.

979
00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:16.610
Solar system.
I know what the fuck the word is.
Oh Jesus.
I'm tired.

980
00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:20.180
You know guys,
sometimes these fucking questions they did

981
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:25.900
<v 0>like,
do you guys realize that the level of thought that how dumb I am,</v>

982
00:59:25.901 --> 00:59:27.220
that you got to fucking sit there in March.

983
00:59:27.221 --> 00:59:31.900
Madness bracket sits right in the fucking wheel house.
I guess two or easy.
My,

984
00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:34.900
well,
my wheelhouse,
you know Prince Harry,

985
00:59:35.590 --> 00:59:38.680
you don't even give me his brother's name and then I got to find out is my own

986
00:59:38.681 --> 00:59:43.420
fucking name.
And you even said bill in it.
So the answer was there.
It was a Clo.

987
00:59:44.530 --> 00:59:45.100
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

988
00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:49.140
<v 0>Then what I,
what I want to live forever.
I have to tell you,</v>

989
00:59:49.141 --> 00:59:53.310
I do want to see the seventies again.
I was born in 1968.

990
00:59:53.311 --> 00:59:56.220
I'd love to like to live to about 2072,

991
00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:01.410
you know,
provided New York and Miami on underwater.

992
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:04.660
That changes the whole deal.
Um,

993
01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:08.320
once that shit starts happening and then out and then I don't give a fuck,

994
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:13.690
you know,
Oh,
I'm bandwagon humanity.

995
01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:17.020
I'm here for the good times.
Once it starts going the other fucking direction,

996
01:00:17.021 --> 01:00:18.370
you know,
I'm,
I'm tapping out.

997
01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:19.640
<v 4>Okay.</v>

998
01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.230
<v 0>I you this,
there's,
I don't have any red dawn in me.</v>

999
01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:23.450
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1000
01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:24.283
<v 0>You know,</v>

1001
01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:28.370
I mean I would go up in a tower and just start fucking shooting at the powers

1002
01:00:28.371 --> 01:00:31.910
that be,
I would do that.
Ah,
I was kidding me.
I'd be a pussy.

1003
01:00:31.911 --> 01:00:34.220
I couldn't do that cause I'd be like,
Oh that guy coming at me.

1004
01:00:34.221 --> 01:00:35.480
It's just in his choice.

1005
01:00:35.481 --> 01:00:39.140
He's just taking orders so I just shoot over their heads.

1006
01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.160
I commit suicide that way.
You don't only do the people death by cop.

1007
01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:47.780
I do it that way.
I think
that'll fucking know.

1008
01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:52.900
All I know is I'm back home and I had a great tour up in Canada,

1009
01:00:53.271 --> 01:00:55.460
underrated.
Remember that I used to that overrated,

1010
01:00:55.461 --> 01:00:57.590
underrated for the fucking week.
Uh,

1011
01:00:58.070 --> 01:01:03.020
underrated Canada man,
Canada,
Canada,

1012
01:01:03.021 --> 01:01:07.070
Canada.
You got to fucking get up there dude.
It's fucking,
it's unreal.

1013
01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:11.690
And the maritime,
uh,
specifically,
I would definitely hit up there.
Uh,

1014
01:01:11.691 --> 01:01:16.040
if you're a cigar smoker,
you're out of your mind.
You've got to get up there.

1015
01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.900
Uh,
you know,
I was watching the single,

1016
01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:22.010
the Bruins and they've got this great segment that they do where they interview

1017
01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:26.000
the Bruins and it's just like they talked to him for three minutes where no

1018
01:01:26.001 --> 01:01:28.700
hockey questions.
It's really great in every,

1019
01:01:28.701 --> 01:01:30.410
you can see every player they so sick,

1020
01:01:30.411 --> 01:01:34.460
it's answering questions about playing hockey that all of them it seems when

1021
01:01:34.461 --> 01:01:37.070
they're interviewing them,
they're already having a good time just to,

1022
01:01:37.071 --> 01:01:39.230
he'd be here in new questions and,
uh,

1023
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:44.300
Brad Marchand who then said he can call a Marshawn,
he doesn't give a fuck.

1024
01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:49.301
So I'm going back to Marshawn is actually an avid hunter and I believe he's from

1025
01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:52.610
Halifax or somewhere around there.
And um,

1026
01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:54.030
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1027
01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:59.030
<v 0>he shot big shit like bear and he's going to go after elk and a next,</v>

1028
01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:04.010
and I honestly,
I,
that's,
I couldn't do that.
I don't think I could do that.

1029
01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.290
I could shoot a chicken,
right?

1030
01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:13.190
I could shoot a cow,
but if I didn't kill it on the first shot,

1031
01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:17.150
I would hear that awful mooing for the rest of my fucking life.

1032
01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:18.950
Why wouldn't you to cow and she would,
uh,
steer

1033
01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.280
<v 8>man,</v>

1034
01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:27.880
<v 3>that's a gun's jam.
Ugh.</v>

1035
01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:31.510
Oh my God.
It'd be fucking horrible.
But I gotta be honest with you.

1036
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:35.440
If everybody listened to this podcast,
if you are hungry enough,
you would,

1037
01:02:35.441 --> 01:02:37.000
you would fucking eat a puppy.

1038
01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:40.820
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1039
01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:43.230
<v 3>Sad reality.
Just the,
your,</v>

1040
01:02:43.231 --> 01:02:47.610
your love of cute things versus I'm going to fucking die if I don't eat you.

1041
01:02:47.611 --> 01:02:51.030
It just goes right out the goddamn window.
You know,

1042
01:02:51.031 --> 01:02:52.830
what's the biggest animal you think you could kill?

1043
01:02:55.620 --> 01:03:00.050
Biggest animal I could kill.
Be Jonah.
Rosa.
He's a fucking animal.

1044
01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:04.430
Um,
actually what do we got here?
Am I over an hour?

1045
01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.560
Did I make it all right?
Now we're in three minutes.
Okay.

1046
01:03:06.561 --> 01:03:09.320
That's a podcast for this week.
Everybody.
This was sort of my hung over.

1047
01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:14.480

1052
01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:30.050
And I'm actually going to be hosting that one and a,

1053
01:03:30.051 --> 01:03:31.520
and kicking off the tour.

1054
01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:36.980
All these guys and the past of open for me and now they're a spreading their

1055
01:03:36.981 --> 01:03:41.510
wings,
doing their own fucking towards.
I'm so proud of,
um,

1056
01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:45.680
and I'm going to be hosting the first one down at Largo.
It's already sold out.

1057
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:49.850
And uh,
we're going to be kicking that one off.
And then these guys,

1058
01:03:49.851 --> 01:03:53.810
I'm telling you,
I don't bring cupcakes out on the road.

1059
01:03:53.811 --> 01:03:57.980
These guys are all killers.
So if you want to see three guys,
guys,
guys,

1060
01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:04.100
alright,
no fucking,
none of that awkward.
You know,

1061
01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:09.380
they don't say apparently before every fucking punchline.
All right.

1062
01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:14.110
Not saying that's bad,
but I'm just saying it's not that fucking style.
All right.

1063
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:17.570
Uh,
if you want to listen to three guys,
fucking hilarious,

1064
01:04:17.571 --> 01:04:20.210
who you probably would sit next to win a bar.
These are the guys,

1065
01:04:20.211 --> 01:04:23.720
the all end tour.
We're going to be getting the dates up soon.
Uh,

1066
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:27.290
they're going to have a fucking cool last poster.
I've already heard the concept.

1067
01:04:27.291 --> 01:04:29.420
I fucking love it.
And uh,

1068
01:04:29.421 --> 01:04:32.180
I'm proud of these guys and it's going to be a great tour.
So,
uh,

1069
01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:36.110
definitely be looking for that and uh,

1070
01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.870
oh fucking freckled face here is done.

1071
01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:43.880
I am done with standup comedy until the end of April.
I'm not doing shit.

1072
01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:48.940
I am a relaxing and,
um,
I think the song,
I'm gonna,

1073
01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:51.650
I'm gonna do my,
my standup from here on out.

1074
01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:55.640
I'm just going to fucking go out and go psycho for fucking 20 days and then take

1075
01:04:55.641 --> 01:04:59.360
like a month and a half off and then do another cycle fucking tour.

1076
01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:03.290
And I sort of got to do all in nothing,
just the same way I drink,

1077
01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:07.730
just fucking pounding.
And then just,

1078
01:05:07.731 --> 01:05:12.020
I take a fucking year off for 70 days off and then I pound for another 70 days.

1079
01:05:12.021 --> 01:05:15.660
That's it.
All enough to,
that's how I'm going to do it.
All right.
Uh,

1080
01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.270
that's the podcast for this.
As always.
Thank you for everybody for listening.

1081
01:05:19.271 --> 01:05:23.480
I hope you have a wonderful week.
Don't take any shit.
All right.

1082
01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:27.920
Go fuck yourselves.
And a,
any predictions,

1083
01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:33.420
any predictions mean VRC is still talking about that fucking horrific flight

1084
01:05:33.421 --> 01:05:36.690
that they can't find and he thinks it's on the ground.

1085
01:05:36.691 --> 01:05:40.840
I think it's unfortunately a,
you know,

1086
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:44.380
I think it's unfair.
I actually,
that,
that review that I,

1087
01:05:44.381 --> 01:05:46.930
that prediction that that pilot made the,

1088
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:49.390
he thought there was some sort of fire on board or something.
Man,

1089
01:05:49.391 --> 01:05:54.391
it seems like it's that fucking that is anything just hanging in the air.

1090
01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:59.580
You just want the answer to.
It's gotta be that man.
It was fucking poor families.

1091
01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:01.960
Why do I bring,
it was awful last week when we brought it up.

1092
01:06:01.961 --> 01:06:05.980
Why would I end the podcast bringing that up?
Stupid stupid fucking move.

1093
01:06:05.981 --> 01:06:09.430
But you know what?
You don't listen to this thing cuts.
I'm smart.
That's it.

1094
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:13.960
All right.
I got nothing to predict.

1095
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:17.650
I got something projected on macro do shit between here and next week.

1096
01:06:17.651 --> 01:06:20.890
I better get a fucking guest.
I actually got a call,
Don.
