00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.770
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
March 30th March 30th to everybody in like a lamb out like a lion.

3
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.870
Remember I told you guys that I was going to go to the fucking gym?

4
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:19.330
You remember I said that?
What?
I say?
Fuck you called it.

5
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.570
Remember that you remember?
Oh my God.
Stacy,
your members.

6
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.530
<v 2>MMM,</v>

7
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.650
<v 0>well Billy freckles fucked up this week.
I went back to New York City.</v>

8
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.710
New York City is fucking an evil,

9
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.300
twisted place for me as far as I just have too many friends,

10
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.200
too many comrades,
too many Booz bag drinking buddies.

11
00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:50.201
I fucking drank like Dean fucking Martin all fucking week.

12
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.260
I went to the gym once,
I played pickup hockey twice.

13
00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:57.740
So that's kind of like doing some audio.
Uh,

14
00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:02.000
I guess I walked to the subway,
went up and down the stairs.
Other than that,

15
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.740
other than that,

16
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.450
<v 2>it was an absolute,
it was a shit show I put on display.</v>

17
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.020
I put on a display,
a fucking drinking this past week.
Um,

18
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.320
I'm surprised that like,
you know,

19
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.610
maker's mark is not sending me like some sort of trophy with their bottle on top

20
00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:23.410
of it.
All right.
Oh Jesus.
Oh,
what did I,

21
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.860
what the fuck was I doing?
You know what?
You know what New York,
it's weird.

22
00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:30.850
It's like you walk around so it's good you know about staying in shape.

23
00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:34.930
But like the shit's open all fucking night.
Not Everything by the way.

24
00:01:34.931 --> 00:01:38.020
Cause I remember back in the day when I was a kid and they were like,

25
00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:41.530
it's the city that never sleeps.
It's open 24 hours.

26
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.490
I used to think that meant like banks,
hardware stores,
like everything was open.

27
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.110
It isn't all right.
Everything closes at a normal fucking time.

28
00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:54.100
Like everything else except for the places where you can really get in trouble,

29
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.180
like bars,
um,
and fucking late night places to eat.

30
00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:03.181
Just every fucking dumb ass thing that you could possibly do to wake up the next

31
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.090
morning looking like you're in your first trimester.
Um,

32
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.110
that's what I did coming home.
Fucking hammered.
Right.

33
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.020
That's another thing too,
because his taxis all over the place.

34
00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:18.130
You don't have to even consider,
hey,
wait a minute,
I have to drive.
You know,

35
00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:20.650
I don't have to drive.
I don't have to do anything.

36
00:02:20.651 --> 00:02:24.280
I have like fucking 100,000 designated drivers out there.
My friend,

37
00:02:24.281 --> 00:02:26.620
my friend waiting to take me home

38
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.780
<v 0>and because I'm a white man,
even if I'm just going to walk home,</v>

39
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:33.330
they're still pulling over.
Hey my friend,
my friend.

40
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.803
<v 1>Right?</v>

41
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.420
<v 0>So kind of privilege.
I have you in the blue eyed devil,
right?</v>

42
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.430
I can't even walk off the fucking pumps.

43
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.090
That's a form of terrorism right there.

44
00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:50.930
When you see a white guy that you know needs to walk off the booze and you

45
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:54.380
fucking pull over and I'm not even asking for a ride and you still try to get me

46
00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:57.920
to get new cab because you hate my country's foreign policy right there.

47
00:02:57.921 --> 00:03:01.110
You're like my friend my did to my cup.

48
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.480
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

49
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.370
<v 0>you have a heart attack when you're 50.</v>

50
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

51
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.840
<v 0>God is great.
Right?
How fucking hack he was that,</v>

52
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:15.250
that was me doing a version of every standup comics.

53
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.590
Um,
I guess Indian accent.
Well,
what do you expect?

54
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:24.460
I got to do one of these every fucking week.
I've got a workshop.
Some shit.

55
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.070
Give me some hacky shit on here.
What the fuck are you doing?
Oh,

56
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.140
sit in your desk with your little pen and pencil set that your mom and dad got

57
00:03:31.141 --> 00:03:35.200
you.
Cause he was so proud of you.
Oh,
we're still proud of you.

58
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.250
He's a penitential sitting this stapler.
You know what?

59
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:41.380
Fuck your office supplies.
What do you think about that?

60
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:44.410
Fuck you look at your desk.
Tell me right now.

61
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:48.070
You're not sitting at your desk and you just don't have the urge to fucking put

62
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:51.620
your fucking arm down on one side of it.
Yes.

63
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.800
Just clear it right off like Denzel Washington when he's in a movie and the

64
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:59.710
dialogue isn't up to his acting level,

65
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:03.220
so he's got to start slapping cups of water out of people's hands just to make

66
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:04.600
it seem compelling.

67
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.793
<v 1>Huh?</v>

68
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.290
<v 0>You know what's fucked up about Denzel in Samuel Jackson could shop though two</v>

69
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:15.250
of the great fucking actors of of whatever.
What did you say last 2030 years?

70
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.620
Right.
They keep sticking him in those like the blank movies,

71
00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:24.670
right?
The negotiator,
the fucking freelancer,

72
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.730
the architect,
whatever the fuck.
It's always the something.

73
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.850
<v 1>Okay,</v>

74
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.040
<v 0>Geez,
can you get him a fucking script?
Well,
you know what,</v>

75
00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:36.510
can you guys stop stealing movies?
So the $50 million budget movie comes back,

76
00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:40.380
you conch instead of everything being $100 million robots,

77
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.030
you know,
with umbilical cords,
the aliens,
whatever the fuck goes on in there,

78
00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:49.140
right?
It's either that or talk in apes or what do you have?

79
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.310
You got it.
You got an independent movie for fucking 800 grand,

80
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.740
which you know is going to be a bunch of awkward fucking nerds,
you know,

81
00:04:58.741 --> 00:05:00.300
with their fucking glasses.

82
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.390
They've fucking hoodies.
Anyways.

83
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

84
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.750
<v 0>Anyway,
so what do you,
what are you going to do?
What do you let,
let's,</v>

85
00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:11.460
let's just plow it.
I didn't know what the fuck I'm saying here.

86
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.080
All I'm telling you is that,
you know,

87
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:16.020
last week you have to me talking all this shit that I should go,
you know,

88
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:19.800
go step on the scale and see what the damages I have to do that after this

89
00:05:19.801 --> 00:05:24.780
podcast.
I swear to God,
if I'm back up over one 80,
um,
you might,

90
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.590
you might,
you know,
if you listen,
if you listen intently,
you might hear me.

91
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.030
You might hear me weeping.
Oh Man,
I'm fucking off the rails.

92
00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:36.690
But it starts today.
No,
it doesn't start today.
It doesn't start today.
You know,

93
00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:40.350
cause I was out of town and uh,
you know,

94
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.970
my wife's been super busy and uh,
you know,
there's nothing in the fridge.

95
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.660
My truck is getting fixed.
I don't have a vehicle.

96
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.210
And you know what I got up so you don't have upstairs in the fridge.

97
00:05:51.211 --> 00:05:56.211
I have a weak old lunch meat and I have some fucking guacamole because my wife

98
00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:58.110
saves takeout.

99
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.100
<v 2>She just sticks it in there and she,
I mean,
every fucking little thing,</v>

100
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.360
it's insane.

101
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

102
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.470
<v 2>She's like a hoarder of,
of of leftovers.</v>

103
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.770
Like little fucking every packet of sauce.

104
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.390
Anytime we ordered Sushi,
she sticks all those fucking packets and they like got,

105
00:06:15.391 --> 00:06:19.740
you know,
God forbid some day of fucking macro falls through our ceiling.

106
00:06:19.741 --> 00:06:24.060
We got to eat the whole thing.
We'll have enough soy sauce.
Right.
Those things.

107
00:06:24.061 --> 00:06:27.690
Old Chopsticks,
little tins of sour cream,

108
00:06:27.691 --> 00:06:29.270
you know all those little things that are,
or

109
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.000
<v 1>okay,</v>

110
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.290
<v 2>fucking Balsamic vinaigrette.
And then once every,
every three months,</v>

111
00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:39.190
I gotta be the bad guy.
I got to be the guy that goes in there.
Yeah.
Listen,

112
00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:40.450
everybody,
you know,

113
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.290
like I'm kicking some bum out that was supposed to get an apartment.

114
00:06:44.291 --> 00:06:47.560
Come on guys.
You gotta go.
All right.
Get up off the couch.

115
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.770
You tell Guacamole you're out.

116
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.400
I feel as though you can turn our shit

117
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:55.603
<v 1>right.</v>

118
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.140
<v 2>That's what I have upstairs.
I have a container of Brown guacamole.</v>

119
00:06:59.141 --> 00:07:03.370
I already threw it out.
You know what I mean?
I'm fucked.

120
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.720
I got one can of dog food.
I don't know what she did this weekend.
You know?

121
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.180
What do you mean?
But you can't give him shit.
You give them shit and then what?

122
00:07:10.181 --> 00:07:12.520
They get mad at you.
They get mad at you.

123
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.640
They get mad at you when they didn't do the broad job of keeping the fucking

124
00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:22.930
refrigerator stocked.
That is a woman's job.

125
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.280
Go Fuck Yourself.
I don't care if you have hair under your armpits or not.

126
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.140
That's a fucking woman's job.
The same way.
My job is,

127
00:07:32.141 --> 00:07:34.750
I got to take the fucking trash out to the curb.

128
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:40.050
There's certain things that were and always will be a man or a woman job around

129
00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:42.940
the fucking house,
and I just feel,
you know,

130
00:07:42.941 --> 00:07:46.090
keeping the fucking refrigerator stocked.
You know,

131
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.870
your hero for your inspiration,

132
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.420
for the man in your life.
I don't think that that's asking too fucking much,

133
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.480
is it?
I don't think it is

134
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.290
Jesus Christ.
Whatever.
I hit a fucking bowl of cinnamon likes this morning.

135
00:08:05.291 --> 00:08:08.650
What am I fucking eight years old?
Those are my options.
You know,

136
00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:10.210
I would have had the oatmeal,
but there's no banana.

137
00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:12.910
I've got to have a banana with the fucking oatmeal.
You know,

138
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.750
you know this about me.
Oh Jesus Christ.
I mean,
why?
Why,

139
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.240
why even?
Why even get involved in the fucking argument?
Bill,

140
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:24.770
how long have you been with,
you know,
better don't take the bait.

141
00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:28.640
Just fucking sit there and be like,
oh,
always say nothing in the fridge.
Oh,

142
00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:33.590
that's great.
Thank you sweetheart.
You have a good day.
Bye Bye.

143
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.930
Hey Cleo,
you want us?
You want to split a fucking kid,
a dog food.

144
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:45.440
You must remember this.
A kiss is just a case.

145
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.130
Um,
I came home anyways.
I want to,
first of all,

146
00:08:49.131 --> 00:08:52.460
before I do any more babbling here,

147
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.650
it'll in the podcast.

148
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:59.651
I want to everybody over at Madison Square Garden this week for asking me to

149
00:08:59.961 --> 00:09:03.410
come over and do the garden of dreams,
the garden of dreams,

150
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.480
um,
benefit this week.
I could not have had a better time.

151
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.530
I went to a rangers game.
I went to a Celtics game.
You know,

152
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.470
we played pickup hockey.
I've listened to the Thursday podcast.

153
00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:19.130
He played pickup hockey at Madison Square Garden.
You know,

154
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.680
unbelievable.
The hardest thing I had when I was there at Madison Square Garden,

155
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:25.880
skating on the ice,

156
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.300
the only thing harder than trying to keep my heart rate my heart,

157
00:09:29.301 --> 00:09:30.770
literally from jumping out of my chest.

158
00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:34.640
The only thing harder was trying to find a championship banner hanging from the

159
00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:35.474
rafters.

160
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.630
They got all kinds of banners up there.

161
00:09:41.631 --> 00:09:44.690
They've got banners up there for like division championships.
I mean,

162
00:09:44.691 --> 00:09:49.130
it's a sad thing.
It's such a wonderful arena.
Uh,
come on as a Boston fan.

163
00:09:49.131 --> 00:09:52.040
You know,
I had to break a little bit of balls,
but it was,
uh,

164
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.690
it was tremendous and,
um,

165
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:59.110
we couldn't have had a better time and I have the puffy booze face to,

166
00:09:59.931 --> 00:10:02.340
uh,
to prove it.
I had a,

167
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.130
I had a great fucking time.
Um,

168
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:11.060
and now I'm back and I believe me when I told you this morning that I rolled out

169
00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:13.190
of bed,
hey,
let me tell you,
I rolled out of bed,
you know,

170
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.530
I'll tell you last week I had a rough one.
Um,
anyways,

171
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:24.410
so like I,
uh,
I come home last night and,
uh,

172
00:10:24.411 --> 00:10:28.250
I got home late and a back out here in La and uh,

173
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:33.290
me and the wife watched that Scientology movie on,
um,

174
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:39.200
on Hbo and you definitely should check it out.
All right.
But if you,

175
00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:43.430
if you don't sit down before you even watch the first second of it,

176
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:45.980
and Sadie is self,

177
00:10:45.981 --> 00:10:50.330
that they could literally do the exact same documentary on every fucking

178
00:10:50.331 --> 00:10:53.360
religion on this planet,
um,

179
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.340
then you probably shouldn't watch it.

180
00:10:55.341 --> 00:10:58.460
Cause you're going to be one of those people that watches the Scientology video

181
00:10:58.461 --> 00:11:02.900
and be like,
dude,
these people fucked.
It's all fucked.

182
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:08.630
It's everything that they're doing was,
I can't speak for our religion.

183
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:13.650
My religion did.
Time's a zillion as far as I know,

184
00:11:13.651 --> 00:11:18.180
Scientology for as abusive as they're,
they're claiming that they've been,

185
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.890
they never killed anybody.

186
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.033
<v 3>You know,</v>

187
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.100
<v 2>they didn't go around fucking children.</v>

188
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.580
Like my fucking organization.

189
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:35.310
I don't have one rock to rock.
I don't have one rock to throw.

190
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:40.230
But,
um,
I will tell you,
man,
they,
uh,
it was,

191
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.670
it was just more of the same.

192
00:11:41.671 --> 00:11:45.090
I watched it more like not just looking at it like this is Scientology.

193
00:11:45.091 --> 00:11:48.570
This is what the fuck it is.
I looked at it more like a,

194
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.120
just like human beings,

195
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.600
and this is what happens when somebody is allowed to slide into the Jesus'

196
00:11:57.271 --> 00:12:01.800
position.
Mohammed,
whatever you want to call it.
When they slide in there,

197
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.790
who's twos?
The Jewish guy.
Who's that?
Who's that?

198
00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:08.910
Jesus was there some guy named,
I can't test to hack.

199
00:12:08.911 --> 00:12:12.450
You have see some guy named Marie Abraham.

200
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.910
<v 0>Is that,
that guy?
I don't fucking know.
I have no idea.</v>

201
00:12:14.911 --> 00:12:18.820
They all sound the same to me.
There was nothing,

202
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:22.030
nothing was going on.
And then this guy showed up,

203
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:27.030
he did a bunch of grade shit and now he's the guy.

204
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:32.210
Give us your money but boo booboo and is it okay if uh,

205
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:37.090
she blows me.
Um,
anyways,
plowing ahead here.
Um,

206
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.850
you should definitely a highly record

207
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:43.210
<v 2>meant
that you check that out and um,</v>

208
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.830
I dunno,
I felt bad for Tom Cruise.
They made him look like a soccer,

209
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.880
you know what I mean?
Especially,
you know,
anytime,
you know,

210
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:55.870
you slow down the video and you put Weirdo music in there,

211
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.680
you're going to make somebody look bad.
And um,

212
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.160
yeah,
I don't know the fuck.

213
00:13:03.161 --> 00:13:05.440
I mean when I sit there and think of the shit that I bought into,

214
00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.620
donate it to a Goddamn booth until some fucking Weirdo.

215
00:13:10.621 --> 00:13:15.570
All the bad things I did that week.
What is that all about?
Huh?

216
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:16.750
<v 0>Bless me.
Flatly.</v>

217
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:21.100
Five CNG and he had engaging my last fucking confession.

218
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.960
I jerked off.
I beat up my brother,
I fucking stoles.
It's just like,

219
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:27.470
<v 1>okay</v>

220
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.350
<v 0>in,
this guy's just sitting in there.
What the fuck are you doing in there?</v>

221
00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:31.470
Your Weirdo?
Yeah.

222
00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:32.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

223
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.400
<v 0>Listen to it through all this shit.
I got to go there and confess to you.</v>

224
00:13:36.401 --> 00:13:39.880
You can't.
Why can't I just go right,
go direct route.

225
00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:42.430
What am I going to connect and fucking Dallas talking to you?

226
00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:46.210
Why can't I just fucking go straight there?
No direct flight to God,
their buddy.

227
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.340
What are you doing in there?
Hey,

228
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:53.380
what's going on in the other side of the wall there?
What are you doing?

229
00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:58.230
Your Weirdo.
Ah,
you filming this shit case.
I want to run for office someday.

230
00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.400
I'll fucking call you off for banging a kid.

231
00:14:00.401 --> 00:14:04.630
You've got all this weird footage on me.
I don't know.
All of it is fucking weird.

232
00:14:04.631 --> 00:14:07.650
I think everyone,
I think everybody should just walk away from all of,

233
00:14:07.651 --> 00:14:10.030
that's what I,
that would be my suggestion.
You don't have to,

234
00:14:10.031 --> 00:14:13.630
but if it works for you,
fine.
Um,
unless you become a country.

235
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:19.920
Oh Jesus.
But why do you try to make points?
Why did they never go anywhere?

236
00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.560
Did they go anywhere?
I don't think they do.

237
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:27.140
<v 2>Um,
so anyways,
so what did I do this week?
Jesus</v>

238
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.990
<v 0>running out of shit to say already.
It's already 15 minutes in.</v>

239
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:34.840
I think I got to fucking read some ads just to keep it going.
So I,
uh,

240
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:40.340
<v 2>my,
I told you guys my truck,
uh,
um,
I dunno,
I cooked the valves on it,
man.</v>

241
00:14:40.341 --> 00:14:44.690
I fucking so pissed at myself.
So they're uh,
they're rebuilding the whole thing.

242
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.980
The whole engine brand new.
I can reuse unleaded gas at,
won't fuck the thing up.

243
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:53.710
And uh,
it should be done sometime this week.
I actually,

244
00:14:53.711 --> 00:14:54.310
uh,

245
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:58.780
adding air conditioning and I'm getting the power steering and um,

246
00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.760
that's just going to be my fucking daily driver.

247
00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.760
And I kept the three on the tree because it was just too fucking cool.

248
00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.310
Skye was building is going to like do it.
We can fuck it.

249
00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.050
Fuck you can get this thing cruising at about a hundred miles an hour.

250
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.350
It's just like,
I don't want to do that.

251
00:15:11.351 --> 00:15:14.320
It's too fucking cold shifted on the column.
You know,

252
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.720
I think it's too fucking cool to,
uh,
to get rid of that.
So,
um,

253
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:24.760
basically
I'm going to have a bad ass fucking truck here in a couple of days,

254
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.120
which would be nice.
Cause then maybe I could fucking,
you know,

255
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.450
so clear when that I could go down the street and I can maybe put something in

256
00:15:31.451 --> 00:15:36.170
the refrigerator and maybe I could eat something.
Oh,
let me tell you,
my wife,

257
00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:39.090
she get off.
She doesn't,
I've got a wife,
you know,
she does have,

258
00:15:39.091 --> 00:15:43.590
she does a stock the frigerator.
Why just the other day?
Um,

259
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.990
anyways,
uh,
let's,
uh,
let's,

260
00:15:45.991 --> 00:15:50.190
let's read a little bit of a advertising for the week.
I swear to God,

261
00:15:50.191 --> 00:15:52.600
I know I must've saw something ahead of them.
It's,
you know what,

262
00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:56.340
I just had a fucking tremendous week.
I don't know what to tell you.

263
00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.780
I enjoyed myself all week.
I did the,
um,

264
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.350
I did the benefit for a first,

265
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.710
he's brother-in-law and I actually had a great time up there,
levity live,

266
00:16:07.711 --> 00:16:09.990
which is a fucking unbelievable comedy club by the way.

267
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.750
I had always heard that it was one of the best in the country and it definitely

268
00:16:12.751 --> 00:16:16.200
lived up to it.
And um,
I'm trying to,
uh,

269
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.560
figure out a way where I can get back there at some point.

270
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:24.540
Terry town played the Tarrytown musical,
which was the last second gig.

271
00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:29.580
And um,
it was fun,
man.
I'm back.

272
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.910
You know,
we got the,
we got the cartoons all recorded,

273
00:16:32.911 --> 00:16:35.760
we got all the records it done and uh,

274
00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:39.150
now the drawing the shit and we just,
I don't know,

275
00:16:39.151 --> 00:16:42.870
my schedule is totally opened up now and I can get back to being a standup comic

276
00:16:42.871 --> 00:16:43.920
and I can't fucking wait.

277
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:48.330
I can't wait for the southern tour and I'll build these fucking cigar face still

278
00:16:48.331 --> 00:16:50.230
is not at a cigar.
All right.

279
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.370
A mob coming up on like five weeks from everyone.

280
00:16:53.371 --> 00:16:56.070
I told you guys I was gonna be that guy who smoked a cigar once a week.

281
00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.150
That's what I was trying to do.

282
00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:01.860
I was trying to cut down my cigar smoking to a near 52 cigars a year,

283
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.600
which is still way too much.

284
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.950
So have to fucking January and February I was already up to 12 cigars,

285
00:17:07.951 --> 00:17:11.100
eight weeks,
12 cigars.
I'm off the fucking rails already.

286
00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:16.090
So I didn't smoke anything in March.
Um,
we're already up to the 12th week,

287
00:17:16.091 --> 00:17:18.980
so now I feel like I'm even,
but um,

288
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.140
<v 1>okay.</v>

289
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:23.200
<v 2>No,
I told version and those guys that I wasn't going to,
um,</v>

290
00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:29.290
I wasn't going to uh,
smoke until the,
uh,

291
00:17:29.291 --> 00:17:32.830
the bus tour and then I was going to smoke,
but I gotta be honest with you,

292
00:17:32.831 --> 00:17:34.360
I might not even smoke on that one.

293
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:38.500
I might just wait until my birthday because I figured my birthday's in June and

294
00:17:38.501 --> 00:17:41.920
then what if I'm still on 12 cigars now I'm down to like two a month,

295
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:46.270
which seems way more fucking acceptable then.
Uh,

296
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.080
I dunno,
I had my fun with,

297
00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.690
if it didn't give you a mouse throat and fucking God knows what else,

298
00:17:53.691 --> 00:17:56.720
other kind of tongue cancer,
I would,
uh,

299
00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:01.220
I would probably smoke for a week.
That's how much I enjoy it.

300
00:18:01.221 --> 00:18:04.660
But I just,
I dunno,
I dunno.

301
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:09.420
Seen Leonard Nimoy die and saying he regretted smoking and he was like 83,

302
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:09.831
84,

303
00:18:09.831 --> 00:18:14.780
85 years old and yet didn't you still think of fuck if I didn't do that with

304
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.620
Keith?
He knows people,
young people.
You look at,

305
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.920
you look 82 rod be fucking happy with 80.
Yeah.

306
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:24.840
Until you fucking 80 and you're staring death in the face and you're like,
fuck,

307
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.733
you know,

308
00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.730
I wish I just drank waters and fucking was a vegetarian or whatever the fuck you

309
00:18:30.731 --> 00:18:32.920
thinking.
So the fact that he was still thinking,

310
00:18:32.921 --> 00:18:36.040
he would think if you smoked and you still made it to 83,
84,
85,

311
00:18:36.041 --> 00:18:40.690
whatever the fuck it was,
8,345,
um,
you'd be like,
yeah,
whatever.

312
00:18:40.691 --> 00:18:45.100
I had a good run.
That's what you think until you,
that person laying in the bed,

313
00:18:45.101 --> 00:18:48.250
right where in that smock with your ass hanging out of it and you're like,
wow,

314
00:18:48.251 --> 00:18:52.690
this is it.
This is it.
I'm not going to get to watch anymore hoop anymore hockey.

315
00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.670
I'm not going to get to walk down the street,

316
00:18:54.671 --> 00:18:57.940
listen to the birds Chirp and this is fucking it.
It's over.

317
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.590
And it's over sooner than it should have been because they fucking said I can't

318
00:19:02.591 --> 00:19:05.680
get it out in my head.
So I don't know.
I think I'm done.

319
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.180
<v 1>Okay.</v>

320
00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:11.290
<v 2>No,
who's kidding?
Who?
I'm not done,
but I mean,
I am a</v>

321
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:12.550
<v 1>okay.</v>

322
00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:15.740
<v 2>I,
I dunno.
I don't want to pick it back up again because I,
I,
I,</v>

323
00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.830
you know what the fuck happens,
right?
You're trying to eat right just like I was.

324
00:19:18.831 --> 00:19:21.590
I go to New York and I have one slice of pizza and all of a sudden I'm meeting

325
00:19:21.591 --> 00:19:22.424
like some fucking

326
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.250
<v 1>okay</v>

327
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.580
<v 2>fat guy on prom night who didn't have a date because it was pathetic.</v>

328
00:19:27.581 --> 00:19:31.920
I'm ashamed of myself.
You guys want any fat shamed myself?

329
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.990
Go walking to the bathroom mirror.
Huh?
You want to hear this?

330
00:19:33.991 --> 00:19:34.711
I'm going to do it right now.

331
00:19:34.711 --> 00:19:37.560
I'm going to show you what fat shaming is all about right here.

332
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:42.260
This is what it is,
right?
All right,
let's see if,
let's see the tears.

333
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:49.650
You're up crazy shit.
Oh,

334
00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.340
we'll do it.
I gotta stop.
You know,

335
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:56.350
I just realized I have to stop because my neighbors will think I'm actually

336
00:19:57.491 --> 00:19:58.390
yelling at my wife.

337
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.073
So that's it.

338
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.560
Fortunately I got my pull up by my dip station out in the garage.

339
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.400
I'll do that.
Oh,
my body literally just reacted when I said down.

340
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.830
You don't want to kill it will move the pizza.

341
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.340
So you that I got the grease in me right now.
I've got the crack.

342
00:20:20.341 --> 00:20:24.750
I'm on the crack right now.
That's what I did in a food way.
You know,

343
00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:29.610
I was craving salads.
I was crazy.
Fucking healthy food.

344
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.750
One slice of pizza and a couple of fucking boot.
You know,

345
00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:35.130
we went off the rails was right after we skated.
Right?
Yeah.

346
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:36.913
<v 1>MMM.</v>

347
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:41.040
<v 2>You know,
fucking exhausted.
Totally wiped out.
And uh,</v>

348
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.560
we were gonna we were going to the US,
right?

349
00:20:43.561 --> 00:20:45.420
We were going to the rangers kings game that night.

350
00:20:45.421 --> 00:20:50.421
So we went to a bar and ordered an appetizer and I ordered this fucking beer.

351
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.360
There's nothing better after you played hockey and you really feel like you

352
00:20:55.361 --> 00:20:57.940
earned the fact that you could actually sit down and have a beer because you

353
00:20:57.941 --> 00:21:02.941
burn so many calories and I'm easily the best beer I've had in like six months

354
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:05.980
was fucking delicious.

355
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.390
And I remember sitting there and I was eating shit already that wasn't healthy

356
00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:15.610
and this switch just went
like in my body.
I literally felt it like,

357
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.610
oh well are we doing this?
Huh?
Is it like,
you know,

358
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:22.210
it was like substitute teacher like is is the Douche gone now we can go back to

359
00:21:22.211 --> 00:21:27.040
Busan and eating greasy fucking food.
I bought ice cream this week.

360
00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:29.650
I haven't had fucking ice cracking and wants that.
We even fucking had ice cream,

361
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:34.390
stupid ass fucking New York walking home,
hammered stumble into a deli.

362
00:21:34.391 --> 00:21:39.310
Oh they get a bacon,
egg and cheese on a roll.
How are you doing?
Hey,

363
00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.820
I ain't fucking,
next thing you know,
I got that.
I bought Fritos.

364
00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:47.710
And then I bought a pint of fucking cookies and cream ice cream.
Right.

365
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:51.500
What am I on my period fucking go back to the thing.

366
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:56.110
Wolf it down.
I went easy on the ice cream,
but it had just was fucking over.

367
00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:57.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

368
00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:01.730
<v 2>Sitting there reading like I'm at fucking seventh grade and cafeteria.
All right,</v>

369
00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.630
let's,
um,

370
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.250
<v 1>okay,</v>

371
00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:07.850
<v 2>let's get on with the,
Oh,
by the way,
somebody gave me something when,
uh,</v>

372
00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:12.880
when I was playing hockey one day I've never heard of this is called junk bomb.

373
00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:15.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

374
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:20.040
<v 2>Bomb like,
like a roll on.
And it's literally deodorant for your balls.</v>

375
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.140
Is that not the funniest fucking thing ever?

376
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.650
And the guy's giving it to me and it's going well,
you know,
he's like,

377
00:22:25.651 --> 00:22:28.260
if you know,
if you played hockey,
you don't have time to take a shower.

378
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:32.940
You just put this on.
Your boss
was like,

379
00:22:32.941 --> 00:22:37.320
what the fuck?
Are you serious?
I swear to God the is a real thing.

380
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.880
So I'm laughing and I'm like,
well shit,

381
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:46.130
if you got Sherry's berries,
you know,

382
00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:50.150
if we got fucking one wipe Charlies,
how do you not have junk?

383
00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.570
Biomeds I got to have junk bomb on on the podcasts.
There's little,

384
00:22:53.571 --> 00:22:56.630
if any of those guys that listening,
it would fit right in.

385
00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:01.460
Hey guys,
don't have time to take a shower.

386
00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.020
<v 1>Okay,</v>

387
00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.340
<v 2>Jesus.
Judah,

388
00:23:04.341 --> 00:23:07.610

389
00:23:07.611 --> 00:23:11.810
I mean Jesus and you don't have fucking time to take a shower.
I gotta make time.

390
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.210
Hey honey,
I'm going to be a little late.
Trust me,
you're gonna thank me later.

391
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:23.350
All right,
here we go.
Bob has everybody help him say it.

392
00:23:23.351 --> 00:23:27.860
Our Bond Bombas B o m.

Bravo,
Oscar,
Mike Bravo,

393
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:31.220
Alpha Sierra.
Chances are if you have feet,

394
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:35.750
you wear socks and face it.
Socks haven't changed since they were invented.

395
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.000
They fall down,
they were out.

396
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:42.440
And there's always that toe scene that never seems in the right place.

397
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:47.710
Our new sponsor Bombas Bombas a book on buzz has changed all that,

398
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:55.160
but ambos dedicated two years to engineering socks.
Two years.

399
00:23:55.790 --> 00:24:00.620
Some nerds sat in a fucking factory trying to make a better sock.
Okay.

400
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.590
Can you give him the decency of listening to this whole advertisement here?

401
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.920
Walked in the Goddamn closet,
right?

402
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.920
They spent two years in these stinks.

403
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:14.720
Engineering socks that stay up lasts forever and feel amazing on your feet.

404
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:19.070
They last forever.
I have a pair of Bombus.
No,

405
00:24:19.071 --> 00:24:23.540
I don't personalize your experience with Bombus example.

406
00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.890
I find myself watching them over and over so I can wear them again.

407
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.230
I need to get more.
All this is what I'm supposed to say.
Uh,

408
00:24:31.231 --> 00:24:34.760
to know what I'm talking about.
You really need to try a pair for yourself,

409
00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.090
but listen,
but on buzz,

410
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:41.780

Bomba sells.

411
00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:45.590
A pair is donated to someone in need because socks is,

412
00:24:45.591 --> 00:24:48.710
it turns out are the number one requested item at a homeless shelter.

413
00:24:48.711 --> 00:24:52.130
Isn't that nice?
That's actually really nice.
Oh,

414
00:24:52.131 --> 00:24:55.420

00:25:20.691 --> 00:25:23.330
you know what?
They did send me a pair.
I was just on the road.

422
00:25:23.331 --> 00:25:24.164
I haven't gotten them yet,

423
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:28.340
so I can't wait to put them on and wiggle my toes in them and I'll let you know

424
00:25:28.341 --> 00:25:31.670
how great they are.
And I'll tell you if they feel as good as me.

You Ain't come down to your fucking ankles.

427
00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.790
Next thing you know what?
Gay Senator Blows Ya.

428
00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:48.400
You gotta get some fucking me on these.
Your balls will feel really good.

429
00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:52.600

430
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.193
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

431
00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:57.760

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.640
<v 2>so fucking me on these.
All right,

433
00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:05.680
90% 90% that's the percent of your life that you're in your underwear,

434
00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:11.090
right?
What's your a Gigolo was some napalm went off.

435
00:26:11.091 --> 00:26:14.420
You're running down the street naked with your skin hanging off your back and

436
00:26:14.421 --> 00:26:16.370
underwear.
It gets old fast.

437
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.970
You know that feeling of putting on old saggy underwear,

438
00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:23.270
you know that feeling right?
Hang it down.
It's not even touching your balls.

439
00:26:23.271 --> 00:26:25.130
And every once in a while,
you know,

440
00:26:25.131 --> 00:26:28.430
you jump up to see what's on top of the fridge and you saggy underway,

441
00:26:28.431 --> 00:26:30.650
hits your balls and it's so weird.

442
00:26:30.651 --> 00:26:34.190
You feel like someone slapped your nuts from behind.
You turn around,

443
00:26:34.191 --> 00:26:38.470
there's no one there.
You don't want to do that.
You get all paranoid Nixon,

444
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.980
you know,
he start talking to yourself.

445
00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:45.130
You lose your job and then you know what happens next.
You lose your underwear's.

446
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.520
All right?

447
00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:50.270
You need to know the feeling of great fitting underwear that is two times softer

448
00:26:50.271 --> 00:26:52.400
than cotton.
Some poor bastard.

449
00:26:52.401 --> 00:26:54.890
It had to sit in a lab is they rubbed fucking underwear.

450
00:26:54.891 --> 00:26:59.480
And one of his face cheeks in the cotton on the other,
you know,

451
00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.090
and they kept slapping them into the face till he said,
all right,

452
00:27:02.091 --> 00:27:06.260
it's two times softer.
I thought if I just said,
yeah,
it is softer.

453
00:27:06.261 --> 00:27:08.690
I thought that that would be enough for you guys to release me.

454
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.660
<v 0>Um,
you need to know about me on these.com.</v>

455
00:27:11.661 --> 00:27:15.880
Me undies is the most comfortable underwear you will ever wear.

456
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:21.370
And it's insane how good they make you feel when you're walking around with half

457
00:27:21.381 --> 00:27:22.460
a fucking stiffy.

458
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:26.420
They fit perfectly.

459
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:31.630
They don't ride up on you and they literally pull moisture gross.

460
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:34.490
Oh,
away from your skin.
See a stay.
Cool.

461
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:39.340
I have mine on right now and I'm floating.
No I don't.
Um,

462
00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:43.520
they have cool styles for both men and the fucking lady.

463
00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.810
No more sweaty twats and all.
And they all look great.

464
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:50.630
Check out the photos for yourself than me.
UNDIES dotcom.

465
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:54.920
This quality would typically retail for two times the me undies price,

466
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.920
but for some reason they want to make less money.

467
00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.970
No retail middlemen means more savings to you.

468

Two and two.</v>

474
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:28.970
This week everybody will get to draft kings and a legal zoom lays it legal zoom.

475
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.260
Yeah,
we'll get to that later.

476
00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.990
[inaudible] to good.
The bad at pepper pepper.
Oh,

477
00:28:36.991 --> 00:28:41.790

Hang on a second.
Last week.
Here's,

478
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.170
here's something for bombers.
The sock advertiser,

479
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:48.010

the uh,

480
00:28:48.011 --> 00:28:49.840
the man behind the curtain on this podcast.

481
00:28:49.841 --> 00:28:52.750
He said last week you said maybe you should send me a pair.
Well,

482
00:28:52.751 --> 00:28:56.710
they actually sent you a pair of bill and I put my review with them at the top

483
00:28:56.711 --> 00:29:00.890
of the emails last week.
They're great socks.

484
00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:04.880
They had no problem with the read,
but they ask that you relay my experience.

485
00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:08.750
If you're not going to try them.
Well,
where the fuck is it?

486
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:10.190
<v 1>Okay,</v>

487
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:12.930
<v 0>I'll wear them.
You know what?
You know what?
Send me a fucking</v>

488
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.800
<v 2>pair.
I'll wear,
uh,
wear the fucking things.
This is what my life is.</v>

489
00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:23.180
I am a sock tester.
20 something years in comedy.
You know,

490
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.740
you think people

491
00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:29.080
<v 0>fuck with my job.
They didn't want to use my feet.
Um,</v>

492
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.290
anyways,
we're at 29 minutes in.
I'll tell you a couple more bullshit stories.

493
00:29:34.291 --> 00:29:37.680
Then we'll get into the questions for the week when that be nice.

494
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:42.080
Wouldn't that be a nice thing?
And what's on in the world?

495
00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:46.790
What about that fucking jerk off that flies the fucking plane into the Alps.

496
00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:51.190
I mean,
I mean,
Jake,
I you kit,

497
00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:57.910
you're depressed to that fucking level.
It's one of the worst God damn things.

498
00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.460
I,
I've,
what the fuck would I bring that up?
You know what I mean?

499
00:30:02.461 --> 00:30:06.690
Fuck that one.
That was a couple of,
there was a couple of eight hotel.

500
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:10.800
It was a couple of aviation thinks this week.
You know,
I'm up in Canada.

501
00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:11.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

502
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:14.150
<v 0>They came into fucking low I guess.
And they,
they,</v>

503
00:30:14.151 --> 00:30:17.120
they don't really have some sort of tower Assam Shit.

504
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:22.190
Jesus Christ,
I fly all the fucking time.
Man.

505
00:30:22.191 --> 00:30:24.860
That shit is absolutely terrifying.
Um,

506
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.770
I just can't imagine what kind of level of fucking depression you have.

507
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:35.800
I get it.
You know,
it's bad enough you'd go out and to harm yourself.

508
00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:36.790
You'd never want to see them.

509
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.280
You go and you take out all those other goddamn people,
man.

510
00:30:39.281 --> 00:30:43.060
It's just the worst fucking story ever.
And there's,
you know what?

511
00:30:43.061 --> 00:30:47.800
And there's absolutely no comedy in it.
And now here we sit.

512
00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:51.850
I'll tell you what,
there was no comedy in.
Oh is it segue?

513
00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:56.440
Somebody sent me this picture.
This is the saddest fucking pictures I ever seen.

514
00:30:56.530 --> 00:31:01.530
It was of a seal that was born like a redhead in all the entire seal community

515
00:31:03.781 --> 00:31:05.460
just rejected this seal.

516
00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:10.730
And they take this fucking picture of this seal and it's all by itself and

517
00:31:11.581 --> 00:31:15.480
looking way off in the distance or all the other seals said it just wants to

518
00:31:15.481 --> 00:31:17.580
hang out and play with,
you know,

519
00:31:17.581 --> 00:31:20.820
and learn how to fucking fish and not get eaten by a shark or whatever.

520
00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:26.110
And they just totally leave it alone.
It's unbelievable.

521
00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.750
This is just like we're fucking animals.
Same thing.
Same fucking treatment.

522
00:31:31.751 --> 00:31:35.020
I got on the God damn playground.
It's happening to a fucking seal.

523
00:31:35.021 --> 00:31:36.530
I saw that seal and you,

524
00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:40.360
what kills me is the people that like take pictures of it and don't interfere in

525
00:31:40.361 --> 00:31:44.320
nature.
It's like,
would it kill you to take that thing home with you?

526
00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.270
Just get one of those above ground pools.

527
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:54.420
You know what the fucking thing hang up a couple times a year.

528
00:31:54.421 --> 00:31:57.240
It comes in for the Superbowl.
You know,
come up on the couch there.

529
00:31:57.241 --> 00:32:01.350
Redheaded seal.
I feel your pain.
I have empathy.

530
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:06.090
Who Do your gut?
Don't fucking say Seattle.
You've got to be back outside.

531
00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:11.250
Um,
one of the satisfying pictures I've ever seen,

532
00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:15.660
I can't get it out of my eye.
It just,
it fucking killed me.
Fucking kill me.

533
00:32:15.661 --> 00:32:16.494
It's unreal.

534
00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:18.090
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

535
00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:20.340
<v 0>It's unreal.
The human things that I can laugh at,</v>

536
00:32:20.341 --> 00:32:23.880
but you show me a fucking sad animal and it crushes me.

537
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:28.020
It's why I stopped watching the discovery channel like a decade ago.

538
00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.950
I don't watch any fucking nature shows because I know how it's going to start.

539
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.850
It's going to start with me being all wide eyed and excited and enjoying the

540
00:32:35.851 --> 00:32:36.660
program.

541
00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:41.220
And then there's the inevitable and then man and fucked everything up.

542
00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:48.790
I'll tell you right now,
if you work for a fucking corporation,
I mean can you,

543
00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:51.670
can you slowly work your way out of not working for one?

544
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:57.280
Is it even possible?
I was watching.
Did you guys see that clip?
I retweeted it.

545
00:32:57.281 --> 00:32:59.080
Somebody sent it to me of a,
you know,

546
00:32:59.081 --> 00:33:02.560
they're doing that fracking out in a Nebraska.

547
00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:04.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

548
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.410
<v 0>Horizontal drilling,
whatever the fuck it is.</v>

549
00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.250
And however they go about it,
people are claiming,

550
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.750
<v 1>okay,</v>

551
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:15.450
<v 0>that it,
that it pollutes the fucking drinking water.</v>

552
00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:18.250
So this farmer comes in,

553
00:33:18.251 --> 00:33:21.590
he talks about all the great drinking water that they have in Nebraska,

554
00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.780
and then he pours in the goop.

555
00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.710
He's sitting there at this town meeting and he's allowed to talk.

556
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.460
So we asked these constant work for the fracking companies today,
would you,

557
00:33:31.461 --> 00:33:33.920
would you drink this water?
I just want you to ask me that.

558
00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:38.630
Would you drink this water?
And then the fucking chairman of the board goes,

559
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:41.060
you're not allowed to ask them questions.

560
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:42.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

561
00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.940
<v 0>Oh,
you're allowed to do was come up and make comments.</v>

562
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.200
It's like when the,
what the fuck are we doing here?

563
00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.380
<v 1>Okay,</v>

564
00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:51.761
<v 0>well does this,</v>

565
00:33:51.761 --> 00:33:55.610
you supposed to let me just say what I have to say and then I run along and then

566
00:33:55.611 --> 00:33:59.390
you fucking let these guys destroy the drinking water in this state because you

567
00:33:59.391 --> 00:34:04.380
don't make any fucking money as a politician.
Unfuck it just,

568
00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.530
I dunno,
I watched that thing and

569
00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:13.080
I got to commend that that that Nebraska guy for fucking not flipping out.

570
00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.270
Oh you're not.
I'm just allowed to make comments where here's my comment.

571
00:34:17.271 --> 00:34:19.370
At least go and dump it over their fucking heads.

572
00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:24.700
What kind of fucking people are involved in a goddamn business like that then

573
00:34:24.701 --> 00:34:28.930
ends up polluting the fucking drinking water and you,

574
00:34:28.931 --> 00:34:32.830
so thinking about all you give a fuck is your next quarter profits,

575
00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:36.820
like where is that all going to go?
Like where,
where does,

576
00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:40.330
what's the end game in that you just keep having a more profitable thing then

577
00:34:40.331 --> 00:34:43.120
there's no more clean drinking water and then what?

578
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:47.880
You've made enough money to have the machine to fucking have.

579
00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:51.300
Make sure you have clean drinking water and everybody else fucking dies and you

580
00:34:51.301 --> 00:34:55.290
somehow justify it is you lie in your giant fucking bed.

581
00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:57.123
<v 4>Oh,</v>

582
00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:03.170
<v 0>right here.
It's so fucking depressing.
I mean,
that's why I sit around.</v>

583
00:35:03.171 --> 00:35:06.020
I watch sports,
I watch people build cars.

584
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:11.150
Those are like the two fucking areas that I can kind of stay in where I can kind

585
00:35:11.151 --> 00:35:12.170
of a,
I dunno.

586
00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:13.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

587
00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.840
<v 0>Nobody says anything racist.</v>

588
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:18.620
Nobody pollutes drinking water and it's not a redheaded seal who just wants to

589
00:35:18.621 --> 00:35:22.460
be part of the fucking group.
Just sitting there looking all sad.

590
00:35:22.461 --> 00:35:27.450
The thing was a fucking baby.
She had a baby man and they just sit.
They fight.

591
00:35:27.451 --> 00:35:31.370
You know what?
Fuck seals.
But you know what?
Fuck all those fucking seals.

592
00:35:31.371 --> 00:35:33.380
I'm glad they get eaten by those God damn sharks.

593
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.890
I used to give a shit about seals.
Now they know that they're fucking racist.

594
00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:38.020
Bunch

595
00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.180
<v 2>of cons.
You know what it is too.</v>

596
00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.910
I bet there was some seals down there that didn't give a fuck.

597
00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:46.780
They just went along with the group and sat there silently.
Right?

598
00:35:46.781 --> 00:35:50.050
Is the one bully seal a Jesus bill?
Is this what the seals are?

599
00:35:50.051 --> 00:35:54.640
Your fucking childhood.
All right.
All right,

600
00:35:54.641 --> 00:35:57.610
let's get to the,
uh,
let's get to the goddamn questions for the week.

601
00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.730
That always kills me when they tell you they can do that.

602
00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.700
Just don't interfere with nature and you're just going to sit there and look at

603
00:36:03.701 --> 00:36:06.820
that sad shit.
All right.
If you are,
by the way,

604
00:36:06.821 --> 00:36:10.370
if you want to follow us on Twitter here,
um,

605
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:15.390
the podcasts Twitter handle is at the Mlm podcast and the yawning here and the

606
00:36:18.491 --> 00:36:22.930
podcast email is bill at the [inaudible] podcast.com.

607
00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:24.161
Once again,

608
00:36:24.161 --> 00:36:28.940
that number is bill@themmpodcast.com.

609
00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.800
All right.
That's if you want to send an email.
You know,

610
00:36:32.801 --> 00:36:35.620
I just realized too is my internet sucks in this house.

611
00:36:35.621 --> 00:36:36.850
I don't have a car right now.

612
00:36:36.851 --> 00:36:41.140
I got my crazy pit bull so I can't even drive down to the local fucking coffee

613
00:36:41.141 --> 00:36:45.550
shop to use their Internet to upload this fucking thing.
So hopefully,

614
00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:50.310
uh,
what,
what the fuck are you going to do?
What if it's fucking way?
It's like,

615
00:36:50.311 --> 00:36:55.140
what am I going to do?
All right.
Oh,
by the way,
um,
I got a big guest this week.

616
00:36:55.141 --> 00:36:58.290
Hold.
Let me tell you.
Got a big guest for the Thursday.
Uh,

617
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.170
just checking in with your fucking podcast,
whatever the hell I'm calling it,

618
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:05.490
but it's actually going to go down on Friday,
but you'll be happy.

619
00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.120
You will be happy when you hear the guests.
They got a big guest.

620
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:12.600
He is the star of my favorite new show.

621
00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:14.730
Do you know what the show is?

622
00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:19.440
A post apocalyptic show.

623
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:24.990
Former SNL cast member.
Action Hero.

624
00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:30.540
You know who he is?
He's going to be on this Friday.
All right,
here we go.

625
00:37:30.541 --> 00:37:35.460
That's called a teaser.
Um,
warehouse listeners.

626
00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:39.230
Bill.
I'm 19 and I work in a warehouse part time.
Oh my God.

627
00:37:39.231 --> 00:37:41.130
And the most fun job you'll ever fucking have.

628
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:45.240
I was 19 when I worked in a warehouse and I worked there part time,

629
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.680
fucking greatest.
He said,

630
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:50.100
I've introduced your podcast to the guys there and we listen to it regularly.

631
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.080
You've come full circle.

632
00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:53.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

633
00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.360
<v 2>Oh is that,
oh,
that was just the thing.
Well that's cool.</v>

634
00:37:56.361 --> 00:37:57.500
What are you guys been doing?
Huh?

635
00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.140
Fucking off there in the warehouse and all of a sudden somebody with a tie comes

636
00:38:03.141 --> 00:38:04.250
on,
you're like,
well,
who's that?

637
00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.740
He started acting like you're fucking moving boxes around.

638
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.983
<v 1>Okay.</v>

639
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.410
<v 2>I haven't really missed that fucking job.</v>

640
00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

641
00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:13.770
<v 2>You know,
the way I traveled,
you know,</v>

642
00:38:13.771 --> 00:38:15.960
back in the day when I worked in a warehouse,

643
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.960
my commute to work was a little over a mile.

644
00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:23.130
Like we lived in like the last neighborhood before there was this industrial

645
00:38:23.131 --> 00:38:27.390
park.
Um,
like if I wrote a bike's bicycle to work,

646
00:38:27.391 --> 00:38:29.040
it probably take me 15 minutes.

647
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:34.020
And there was weeks where I would put like,
you know,

648
00:38:34.021 --> 00:38:39.021
I'd go to work and then I would drive home and then I would work out,

649
00:38:39.081 --> 00:38:40.850
listen to appetite for destruction.

650
00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:44.990
I'd lift weights throughout that whole fucking album.
And then I jump on a bike,

651
00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:49.760
uh,
by my bicycle and I do like a fucking 10 mile bike ride.

652
00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.930
And then by then,
you know,
it was like seven o'clock or so,

653
00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.140
and the Bruins and Celtics or wherever it had a game,

654
00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:02.150
and I was in for the night and I would do that right up until Friday.

655
00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.240
So Monday,
Tuesday,
Wednesday,
Thursday,

656
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:09.080
I probably put like 12 miles on my truck.

657
00:39:09.081 --> 00:39:12.770
I had this 83 Ford ranger that I bought them and we had 19,000,

658
00:39:12.771 --> 00:39:17.570
317 miles.
And I remember I own that fucking thing for forever.

659
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:22.010
I drove that truck for fucking 10 years,
um,

660
00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.830
even after it started rusting out from all the new England winters,

661
00:39:24.831 --> 00:39:27.530
but I remember like I put on so few,

662
00:39:27.531 --> 00:39:31.520
few miles until I became a comedian and then it went through the roof.

663
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:36.770
And then I remember,
um,
the engine shit,
the bed.
And,

664
00:39:36.771 --> 00:39:39.920
um,
there was a critical moment in my life.

665
00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:44.450
I had a day job and everyone was saying I should go out and go buy a new car.

666
00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:50.290
And I'm,
uh,
I just kept thinking,

667
00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:53.230
if I buy a new car,
then I got payments,
then I need to have a job.

668
00:39:53.231 --> 00:39:55.510
So I said fuck it.
And I just hadn't put a new engine in it.

669
00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:58.930
I told you this story.
I remember that girl.
A woman at work was like,

670
00:39:58.931 --> 00:40:02.530
that was stupid.
That was stupid.
Really?

671
00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.470
I don't have a fucking car payment.
Hey,
guess what?

672
00:40:05.471 --> 00:40:09.610
I'm quitting my day job to move to New York City.
See Ya.
You know,

673
00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:14.800
have fun with your Ultima.
Um,
anyways.
Sorry.

674
00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:19.030
All right.
Fat Shaming.
Counter argument.

675
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:23.950
Uh,
alright,
dear Billy ginger balls.

676
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.400
This guy's going to count a fat shaming by fucking trashing me.
Okay?

677
00:40:27.401 --> 00:40:28.660
He sounds like an open guy.
All right.

678
00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.420
<v 0>I love your podcast and I listen each week.</v>

679
00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:35.800
I'm a Chubby guy who was working hard to lose some of my ex excess weight.

680
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.790
I'm down from two 40 to two 15.
There you go.

681
00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:41.533
<v 2>Woo.</v>

682
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:46.620
<v 0>Dude,
that's a big change to 40 to two 15.
That is fucking,
come on bill.</v>

683
00:40:46.621 --> 00:40:48.690
Do the math.
That's 25 pounds.

684
00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.150
<v 1>Okay?</v>

685
00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:55.080
<v 0>It's 125 miles of capillaries out the fucking window.
However,</v>

686
00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:58.770
I would argue that despite the name you've given to your discussions,

687
00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:01.680
you aren't fat shaming anyone and that's a good thing.

688
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:05.130
You are more of a coach than a true fat shamer.
Dude,
I know what I'm doing.

689
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:09.000
I'm not going to depress you.
I'm going to get you in that mindset,

690
00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:10.060
<v 1>okay?</v>

691
00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.830
<v 0>You know you're better than that.</v>

692
00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:18.340
<v 2>When you were a kid,
you weighed that crap,
you to that dream.
Okay,</v>

693
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.330
<v 0>I know how to do it.
I know how to give you shit while I fuck it up.
Lift you.</v>

694
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:24.150
I'm a fat.
Shamer is a person who looks at an old way.

695
00:41:24.151 --> 00:41:25.800
Person says you're worthless.

696
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.510
You are of a f u r a failed person and you can't do anything to fix yourself.

697
00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:32.550
Who the fuck says that?

698
00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.230
You said I like that dude in that drum and movie.

699
00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:37.990
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

700
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:42.790
<v 0>you fucking piece of shit.
So why I couldn't,
I couldn't get into whiplash.</v>

701
00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:44.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

702
00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:47.980
<v 0>After like the first 20 minutes of that guy getting screamed at the fact that he</v>

703
00:41:47.981 --> 00:41:52.240
didn't have the self esteem to get up and walk out.
It's just loud.
It's like,

704
00:41:52.241 --> 00:41:55.330
all right now I don't give a fuck.
It was like gone girl.

705
00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:57.853
<v 1>You know,</v>

706
00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:03.390
<v 0>if you haven't seen it yet,
block your ears for the next fucking 15 seconds.
Okay,</v>

707
00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.300
I'm going to talk about it in three,
two,

708
00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:10.350
one the fact that after he found out what the fuck she did and then she comes

709
00:42:10.351 --> 00:42:11.970
back and then Tyler Perry's like,

710
00:42:11.971 --> 00:42:16.971
you motherfuckers are crazy and walks out and like he stays with her at that

711
00:42:17.401 --> 00:42:19.140
point.
It's like,
Hey,
you know,
I don't give a shit.

712
00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:23.070
I don't give a shit if she fucking kills the Ben Affleck character right now

713
00:42:23.071 --> 00:42:26.520
because that Ben Affleck character does not seem to give a fuck.

714
00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.910
That's how I felt with like whiplash.
It's like,
all right.
You know,

715
00:42:29.911 --> 00:42:34.230
if you don't have to get yelled at to play drums,
well,

716
00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:37.110
but if you feel that you do when you want to sit there,
then yeah,

717
00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:40.980
then you're a fucking jackass.
See,
that's what I do.

718
00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:46.050
I'm empowering you,
Huh?
To get off the couch and you know,

719
00:42:46.051 --> 00:42:48.180
he'd get off the couch,
you know,
just don't get off the couch.

720
00:42:48.181 --> 00:42:51.490
You gotta lift your fucking legs.
Do a little role lead back into the couch.

721
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:55.740
Adapt we Gowe right.
That should be your next goal.

722
00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:59.460
When you get up off the couch,
you just get up off the couch.
That's a milestone.

723
00:42:59.461 --> 00:43:01.680
That's a marker right there.
Well,

724
00:43:01.681 --> 00:43:06.540
you don't have to do the one g two g and then fucking get all the way up.

725
00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:08.493
<v 1>Literally</v>

726
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.070
<v 0>sounding like you're doing a squat like that last one of the set.
Hey,</v>

727
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:17.870
when you get up off the couch waking the babies scare in the family dog,

728
00:43:17.871 --> 00:43:20.510
you can't be like that.
He said anyways.
To me,

729
00:43:20.511 --> 00:43:24.110
you're a coach who says you're healthy.
You can fix this,
but it won't be easy,

730
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:26.120
but it's worth it.
Absolutely.

731
00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:31.960
Abso-Fucking-Lutely I really think that so much of a staying in shape is,

732
00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.390
um,
is being conscious

733
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:40.420
of craving something that you know is going to make you feel like shit

734
00:43:40.421 --> 00:43:44.080
afterwards and hate yourself in the morning when your belly sticking out.

735
00:43:44.081 --> 00:43:44.711
Even more.

736
00:43:44.711 --> 00:43:48.790
Like last night I'm coming home from the airport and I am on the crack.

737
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:53.770
All right.
Pizza,
ice cream,
potato chips,
beer,
whiskey.

738
00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:57.190
The whole fucking week and I'm coming home.
What do you think I'm craving?

739
00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:00.460
You think I'm craving a fucking salad?
No.

740
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.980
What is the thing I need the most of fucking giant salad that will go into me.

741
00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:11.050
It'll be nutrition with a bunch of fucking cancer is poison on every leaf that I

742
00:44:11.051 --> 00:44:14.840
try to rinse off,
but I'm doing the best I can or whatever.
But what we'll do,

743
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:19.840
we'll level me off chemically and I don't even have a fucking science
background,

744
00:44:19.841 --> 00:44:22.810
but I know it's going to,
it's like,
you know,

745
00:44:22.811 --> 00:44:26.290
it's like you're in a ship that's rocking.
You're getting into to,
to,

746
00:44:26.291 --> 00:44:31.290
to stable water,
calm seas,
and you can make an intelligent choice.

747
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:35.100
All right,
so last night what I should have done is I knew it,
I was saying,

748
00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:37.230
you should order.
I literally have heartburn.
I should go.

749
00:44:37.231 --> 00:44:40.170
You should order a fucking salad.
That's what you should do.

750
00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:42.540
And it was conscious enough to think that.

751
00:44:42.541 --> 00:44:45.960
And I still went inside and I went and I made myself walk waffles with fucking

752
00:44:45.961 --> 00:44:48.870
butter and Syrup and all that.
And you know,

753
00:44:48.871 --> 00:44:51.870
and this morning I wake up and you know,
because they ate that last night,

754
00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:55.470
I'm looking at oatmeal and then I'm looking at cinnamon life and what do I do?

755
00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.130
More heroin,
more heroin,
and I go with that.
So,
um,

756
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:02.340
um,
um,

757
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:07.820
but at least I'm aware of it's the right now I have to critically right now,

758
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:12.910
like what I decide to eat right now for lunch can literally informed the next

759
00:45:13.251 --> 00:45:14.570
three months of decisions if,

760
00:45:14.571 --> 00:45:19.571
if I'm not careful and I can put on 10 to 15 pounds just because last night I

761
00:45:20.661 --> 00:45:22.130
didn't order a fucking salad.

762
00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:26.420
And then where are you then you fucking back at the gym because you not because

763
00:45:26.421 --> 00:45:28.370
you want to be,
because you have to be,

764
00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:31.070
and you've got that big fucking lump of shit.
You gotta,

765
00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:32.660
you gotta take off from your middle,

766
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:36.920
like you eat your way in and eat your way out of the gym.

767
00:45:36.921 --> 00:45:39.860
So I have to today make a fucking smart choice.

768
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:41.703
<v 3>MMM.</v>

769
00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.850
<v 0>And I gotta get,
I gotta get back on the stick.</v>

770
00:45:44.851 --> 00:45:49.310
So a congratulations to you going from to 40 down to two 15 whatever you're

771
00:45:49.311 --> 00:45:50.144
doing.

772
00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:51.243
<v 3>MMM.</v>

773
00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:52.881
<v 0>Hope it works.</v>

774
00:45:52.881 --> 00:45:55.400
And it hope you're reading up on nutrition and I hope you're not doing one of

775
00:45:55.401 --> 00:45:59.960
those fad diets,
you know,
any of those beach diets or any of those,
you know,

776
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:03.500
young catnap carbs.
I've never haven't bred again.
You know,
that type of shit.

777
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:07.280
Cause you know,
eventually one day you just going to sit down with an entire,

778
00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.970
you can have one loaf of bread in one hand and a stick of butter and the other

779
00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:15.400
with some ice cream waiting in the fridge if you fucking do that to yourself.
Um,

780
00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:21.330
I don't know.
I've actually,
I've actually thought about just writing down
like,

781
00:46:21.331 --> 00:46:23.190
cause everybody,
oh this is my cheat day.

782
00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:26.520
You like your cheat day can literally like,
that'd be like a drug addict.

783
00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:30.300
Like all right,
I'm not going to do drugs,
but on Sunday I'm going to do heroin.

784
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:33.480
And then the next day it's right back to clean living.

785
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:34.973
<v 3>MMM.</v>

786
00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:38.570
<v 0>Like your cheat day can literally throw you off chemically to the point.</v>

787
00:46:38.571 --> 00:46:42.470
The next day you're eating fucking waffles like an asshole.
Um,

788
00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:46.990
but maybe if you write it down,
you know that this is what you're going to have.

789
00:46:46.991 --> 00:46:51.390
And then you write a short paragraph,
hey,
you know,
hey cunt face,
listen,

790
00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:56.650
why don't you eat this for breakfast rather than fucking up for the next three

791
00:46:56.651 --> 00:46:59.320
weeks and putting on 20 pounds.
You know,

792
00:46:59.321 --> 00:47:01.420
once you listening to when you order something healthy,

793
00:47:01.421 --> 00:47:05.650
we two three bites into it.
Like this calm comes over you like,
ah,

794
00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:07.630
like nutrition.
You know what I mean?

795
00:47:07.631 --> 00:47:11.170
I read this great thing one time of why you can eat so much Chinese food or why

796
00:47:11.171 --> 00:47:13.030
he can eat a whole fucking bag of Doritos,

797
00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.100
even though you've eaten enough to be full,

798
00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:19.330
but your body is still craving nutrition and there's not an ounce of nutrition

799
00:47:19.331 --> 00:47:19.961
in that shit.

800
00:47:19.961 --> 00:47:23.580
So despite the fact that you took a whole fucking bag of it and threw it down,

801
00:47:23.581 --> 00:47:26.440
you God damn pie hall,
your body's immediately,

802
00:47:26.441 --> 00:47:30.370
it's still crate craving nutrients or whatever the fuck it is.

803
00:47:30.371 --> 00:47:32.290
Whatever the proper terminology is for it.

804
00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:33.803
<v 3>MMM.</v>

805
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:37.990
<v 0>Which is also why if you eat actually,
you know,</v>

806
00:47:37.991 --> 00:47:42.000
fruits and vegetables you get,
you get full.

807
00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:43.693
<v 3>MMM.</v>

808
00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.930
<v 0>Arts.
You know what I get?
I get up.
I have to make sure I eat well.
I really do.</v>

809
00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.290
This isn't even about you guys fucking about me.
I'm being selfish right now.

810
00:47:52.291 --> 00:47:57.030
Let's get back to more a skip back to more fucking emails here for the week.
Uh,

811
00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:01.350
naming food places.
All right.
Hey Bill,

812
00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:07.230
you recently asked about places to eat as your tour of the great lower half of

813
00:48:07.231 --> 00:48:10.870
this country is about to begin.
I've been a longtime listener

814
00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:16.050
and I get you to no name policy when it comes to telling stories that may be

815
00:48:16.051 --> 00:48:17.760
incriminating or name dropping.

816
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:21.120
But you said you didn't want to say the names of the restaurants out of fear

817
00:48:21.121 --> 00:48:24.150
that it would ruin the place by creating some type of mom scene.

818
00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:28.770
And the food will go down hill and it'll get franchises,
something bill.

819
00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:33.630
Come on now.
You're basically repaying them for their hard work.

820
00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:38.670
Possibly generations of hard work by walking out,

821
00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:41.730
by walking out in disavowing all knowledge of the place,

822
00:48:41.731 --> 00:48:44.490
the way the u s government handled Vietnam.

823
00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:49.520
Jesus or more specifically John Rambo and Rambo to on behalf of all these

824
00:48:50.341 --> 00:48:55.090
establishments.
I like to thank you for being
uh,

825
00:48:55.120 --> 00:49:00.010
for helping protect them from increased revenue and supporting a healthy,

826
00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:03.310
healthy sense of pride in a life's work.
Also,

827
00:49:03.311 --> 00:49:07.750
I'd like to thank you on behalf of people like myself who occasionally travel,

828
00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:12.610
who would much rather just walk around and play guessing games about where to

829
00:49:12.611 --> 00:49:17.340
eat.
It's much more fun playing.
We'll this suck roulette we'd read.

830
00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:22.360
We'd much rather trust Yelp reviews that are probably real people and not paid

831
00:49:23.621 --> 00:49:26.800
reviewers or family members hyping some shit.

832
00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:29.500
Establishment circuit 2011.

833
00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.140
A real man of the people,
this bill burr get a Makita.

834
00:49:34.141 --> 00:49:38.370
All the cities Saifai Billy Skywalker.

835
00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:43.170
You know what dude?
You had me until you fucking glorified all the cuts on Yelp.

836
00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:44.520
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

837
00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:44.941
<v 0>Yelp,</v>

838
00:49:44.941 --> 00:49:49.200
I swear to God is like if you want to see what happens to somebody when they get

839
00:49:49.201 --> 00:49:53.880
their own TV show and how most people's egos go through the fucking roof,

840
00:49:53.881 --> 00:49:57.480
all you have to do was just looking at,
look at the common man on Yelp.

841
00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:01.800
No,
everything was good in aiding late to sugar packets.

842
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:03.870
These fucking animals,

843
00:50:03.871 --> 00:50:08.040
they'd be seen the average jerk off that walks down the fucking street breathing

844
00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:11.080
through their mouth wearing socks and fucking flip flops.

845
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:15.600
Those fucking assholes who obviously have no power in their life.

846
00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:19.080
They go on Yelp and they're fucking ego goes off the fucking rails.

847
00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:20.123
Here's something.

848
00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:24.480
What do you think happened back in the day when people went to town before Yelp,

849
00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:29.960
and I don't mean the 1950s I'm about the fucking 1980s the 1990s you know what?

850
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:35.330
You struck up a conversation with the locals.
He said,
hey,
I'm in town.

851
00:50:35.331 --> 00:50:38.030
I'm having a really good time.
I'd like to get some food.

852
00:50:38.031 --> 00:50:39.170
You know of a good place.

853
00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:43.460
There's nothing to local wants to do more than the point you to the place that

854
00:50:43.461 --> 00:50:45.800
is the shit in their town.

855
00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:50.300
And you go in there and you sit down and you have a fucking unbelievable meal.

856
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:53.600
And then you go back and you tell your friends,
hey,
if you ever go there,

857
00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.370
you gotta go to this spot.

858
00:50:55.550 --> 00:51:00.550
The fact that it has to blow up like some fucking boy band and now nobody can

859
00:51:00.951 --> 00:51:05.690
get a goddamn seat.
Nick,
give me a fucking break.
I stand by what I'm doing.

860
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:10.930
And you know why I get applause when I say that I went to a country recently.

861
00:51:11.121 --> 00:51:14.750
I said,
this place is so fucking beautiful that when I go back to my country,

862
00:51:14.751 --> 00:51:18.800
I'm not going to talk about it.
So you know,
I'll keep your secret.

863
00:51:18.801 --> 00:51:19.730
You know what they all did?

864
00:51:19.731 --> 00:51:23.900
They I got a farmer's got borderline standing ovation.
All right?

865
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:27.500
Everything doesn't need to blow up,
all right?

866
00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:31.700
I don't need to turn every fucking restaurant into fucking Kim Kardashians

867
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:34.920
greased up ass yo with bloke to in a day

868
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:38.720
dumbest fucking thing ever broke the internet.

869
00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:42.650
And then every fucking Douche that's out there taking selfies has to somehow

870
00:51:42.651 --> 00:51:46.340
squeeze,
broke the Internet into their fucking conversation.

871
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:50.390
I fucking hate that.
I Hate Internet,
uh,
terminology.

872
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:53.060
I hate the joke structure.

873
00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:58.130
You know the said no one ever or the uh,
you know,

874
00:51:58.250 --> 00:52:01.760
now it's like you have like a picture and you're like,
Dad,

875
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:05.570
look on your face when your boss says you don't have to come in Friday.

876
00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:09.170
That fucking,
you know,
insert picture here.

877
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:12.560
So you don't even have to be like a joke writer.
So dude,

878
00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:17.510
with all due respect with your waving of the fucking American flag,

879
00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:22.070
all right,
here's the deal.
If you'd get in the fucking job done,

880
00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:23.973
all right,

881
00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:28.010
if you get in the fucking job done and everybody in the local town knows you the

882
00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:30.050
shit,
you got to stay in business,

883
00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:34.340
you don't need me to fucking hypey thing and then ruin it like the food network

884
00:52:34.341 --> 00:52:38.330
does.
And speaking of which to,
they'd fucking guy there with his bleach.

885
00:52:38.331 --> 00:52:42.680
Blonde hair is sunburned face guy Fieri driving all around.

886
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:47.620
I'm telling you that fucking guy,
I,
I've gone to some of the places he's,

887
00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:50.690
they hit or miss.
They hit a miss.

888
00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:54.560
That guy's been on the air for like 10 years.
He's out of places to go to.

889
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:57.090
Not to mention he never goes to drive ins.

890
00:52:58.140 --> 00:52:58.710
<v 1>Okay.</v>

891
00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:00.410
<v 0>He occasionally goes into diners.</v>

892
00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:03.720
He never goes into a dive that basically diners,

893
00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:08.700
but he needed the magic of three.
Um,
anyways,

894
00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:13.560
so no,
I'm not doing that.
Okay.
If you know how to make a fucking brisket,

895
00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:17.850
the Goddamn word is going to be out.
All right.
The word's going to get out.

896
00:53:17.851 --> 00:53:20.850
You don't need me to do it.
And uh,
ruined,

897
00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.300
ruined the fucking place.
Jesus Christ.

898
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:30.270
Yelp.
What kind of a fucking moron goes on to Yelp?

899
00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:34.190
It just takes the,
all these fucking people.

900
00:53:34.191 --> 00:53:36.740
You have no idea what they're fucking axes to grind.

901
00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:40.910
I think that there's like a certain level of client that you have to be to even

902
00:53:40.911 --> 00:53:42.560
post a review on Yelp.

903
00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:48.450
Not to mention there's so many cuts on Yelp that this restaurants that have sat

904
00:53:48.451 --> 00:53:49.284
in.

905
00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:49.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

906
00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:52.830
<v 0>And I said,
hey,
I really enjoyed that.
That was delicious.
And they go,
thank you.</v>

907
00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:55.260
Can you please go on Yelp and write a good review?

908
00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:57.700
Cause there's just so many feelings.

909
00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:06.830
They have a little bit of power now and I'm going to fucking furrow my brow.

910
00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.330
Have you noticed that ship?

911
00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:15.700
All you need to know about Yelp is just looking at actual critics that get paid

912
00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:21.270
to be critics.
When was the last time you saw him review any fucking movie?

913
00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:26.220
Any fucking movie at all?
In wire to wire.
They said that they enjoyed it.

914
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.590
They never do.
They always have to be country.

915
00:54:28.591 --> 00:54:31.620
They always have to pick out something that they didn't fucking like.

916
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:32.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

917
00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:34.060
<v 0>All right.
And then what else?</v>

918
00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:38.020
Then you'll see the worst fucking movie ever and they have quotes going.

919
00:54:38.021 --> 00:54:40.000
Outrageous,
hilarious,

920
00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:45.010
a laugh riot and all that is his critics that want to get paid.

921
00:54:45.011 --> 00:54:46.540
So they got to get their name out there,

922
00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:49.360
so then they'll fucking lie to you and say there's some piece of shit is

923
00:54:49.361 --> 00:54:54.250
actually good.
So fuck you.
Fuck Yelp in Fuck Rambo two.

924
00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:59.630
All right.
I'm not,
I'm not out in those places.
All right,
there we go.

925
00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:04.550
I don't know about Fuck Rambo two.
Okay.
Checkout dark city.
Oh,

926
00:55:04.551 --> 00:55:06.830
hey Billy Scifi.
Billy Skywalker.
All right,

927
00:55:06.831 --> 00:55:09.050
I thought that was somebody signing that.
Um,

928
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:11.420
<v 1>okay.</v>

929
00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:15.400
<v 0>The fuck is with all these goddamn Jesus.
[inaudible] here we go.
It's starting.</v>

930
00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:22.070
It's starting.
Um,
oh well shit,
I ain't,
did you see my email?

931
00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:25.750
Did you kick out the hotel options side five,

932
00:55:25.751 --> 00:55:30.630
Billy Skywalker checkout dark city.
I asked last week,

933
00:55:30.631 --> 00:55:33.330
uh,
you know,
I really enjoyed,
um,

934
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:39.230
a moon with Sam Rockwell and I didn't realize the director was David Bowie's

935
00:55:39.271 --> 00:55:42.540
son,
which of course I don't have his fucking name here right now.
I'm the worst.

936
00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:47.610
Um,
so I said,
what is some other Scifi movies?
I'd love to check them out.

937
00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:51.780
And somebody says,
uh,
Billy Skywalker checkout dark city.

938
00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:55.050
It's not action packed,
but like moon,
you got to see it.

939
00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:59.160
It's shot beautifully intense is fuck,
it's on Hbo Right now.

940
00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:03.840
Don't delay.
Also,
if you haven't seen blade runner recently,
give it a rewatch.
Um,

941
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:08.220
your fellow pilot,
Harrison Ford,
delivers a really underrated performance.

942
00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:12.690
Make sure you watch the director's cut.
It's the only way it'll make sense.

943
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:18.480
Oh Wow.
I got fucking,
Nah,
I gotta check that out.
Um,

944
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:22.800
oh my God.
What is this?
This seems like a disaster waiting to happen.

945
00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:28.380
<v 2>Listen to this one kitten for Cleo.
Bill,</v>

946
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:31.740
have you ever thought of getting a kitten to help calm cleo down?

947
00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:37.470
I can't imagine cleo having a problem with it.
Oh,
I can't.
Oh,
I can't.

948
00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:42.180
I imagine it'd be possible for Cleo to eventually become protective of the

949
00:56:42.181 --> 00:56:43.830
kitten,
which would,

950
00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:47.630
could turn into making things worse.

951
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

952
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:52.090
<v 2>So why would I do that?
I'll let you do the research,</v>

953
00:56:52.091 --> 00:56:55.930
but if you had to imagine how it played out,
what do you think would happen?

954
00:56:57.010 --> 00:57:00.160
Um,
I think my dog would eat the cat.

955
00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:06.140
I think she would view it as a threat because she's possessive and I think I

956
00:57:06.141 --> 00:57:10.160
would come home and the dog would be wagging its tail with for around its mouth

957
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:14.050
and blood on its chin.
And um,

958
00:57:14.090 --> 00:57:17.270
I would find maybe or kitten,
they probably be swallowed whole,

959
00:57:17.271 --> 00:57:20.230
but they might be a fucking pause in my kitchen or something else.

960
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:23.090
Horrific that I'd have to try and block out.

961
00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:27.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>

962
00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:29.740
<v 2>I remember when they taught that grill out how to do sign language.
They get,</v>

963
00:57:29.741 --> 00:57:33.310
they got that thing a pet cat.
I Dunno.

964
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:38.710
A kitten.
I'm not,
I'm not a big fan of cats.

965
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:40.630
I totally respect him.

966
00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:45.430
How they live their lives and their anti authority and like,
you know,

967
00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:48.730
the same way you couldn't put me in a leash.
She can't put them on Alicia,

968
00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:50.380
although I know a few people have done it.
But whatever.

969
00:57:50.381 --> 00:57:53.290
I'm just saying generally speaking.
Um,

970
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:58.540
the only thing I like about cats,
I like watching them sleep in the sun.

971
00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:01.390
Reminds me to take an old man nap every day.

972
00:58:01.391 --> 00:58:05.550
And then I also like how easy it is to discipline him.
You know,

973
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.270
all you do is just give it a nice little smack on that little fucking nose and

974
00:58:09.271 --> 00:58:11.700
then they get it,
you know?
No kidding.

975
00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:15.630
All you have to do is just have to spray water bottle.
Right?

976
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:18.300
And they're still going to go up on a couch,

977
00:58:18.301 --> 00:58:21.870
but it's just fun to fucking shoot something that doesn't die and you get to

978
00:58:21.871 --> 00:58:25.980
feel that cool feel on a shooting.
Something,
you know,
I dunno.
Is that evil?

979
00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:31.370
Oh,
go fuck yourself.
What do you want from me?
Um,
all right,
let me,

980
00:58:31.410 --> 00:58:34.080
let me read the last little bit of advertising and I'll tell you a cute story

981
00:58:34.081 --> 00:58:36.150
and then that's going to be a fucking week.
What do you think about that?

982
00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:37.003
All right.

983
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:42.500
Draftkings everybody spring training is underway and that schmuck training and

984
00:58:42.511 --> 00:58:44.160
all.
Anyway,
let me get,
let me get in.
