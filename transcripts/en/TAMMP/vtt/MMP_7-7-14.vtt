1
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.310
Okay.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.240
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:07.020
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,
July 7th.

4
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.350
[inaudible] hey,
how's it going?

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.750
How are you driving to work?

6
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.050
Or you're already at work in your cubicle or your fucking off.

7
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.090
Are you bringing this country down by not doing your share of the workload
today?

8
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.160
Well,
who gives a shit if you work for somebody else?
The fuck?
Do you care?
I mean,

9
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:29.940
who's dream is it really?
Is it yours?
I don't think it is.
It's not your dream.

10
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:32.280
It's their dream.
You know?

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.200
What kind of office did you dream about as a child?
You had a fucking door.

12
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.520
The walls went all the way up to the ceiling.
You know,

13
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.150
you went in the middle of a fucking room,
you know,

14
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:49.410
with a four foot wall surrounding you on three sides,

15
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:53.430
completely vulnerable.
Anybody who went to West Point can tell you right now,

16
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.850
the debt is not a safe position and that you need to move.

17
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.680
You mean you need to move to higher ground.
Um,

18
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.840
I don't want to get involved in all of that crap.
It's a wonderful weekend.

19
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:08.790
The July 4th weekend,
the celebration of the independence of a,
this,

20
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:13.080
this wonderful nation.
Do you guys go to a parade?
What did you do?

21
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.860
Did you get hammered and watch some fireworks?
I actually,

22
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:19.320
one of my favorite things to do out here in,
uh,

23
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.170
in Los Angeles is on July 4th how everybody just shoots fireworks wherever the

24
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:26.040
fuck they want to.

25
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.210
And me and my wife and some friends every year we just go up onto the roof of my

26
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:32.520
house and we just sit there and we watch.

27
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.310
And fortunately none of my neighbors shoot any off.

28
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.080
It's always a couple blocks away.

29
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:40.860
And then just all the way across Dell a and we just just watch it.

30
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:44.220
I always tried to take a video,
but the cell phone just doesn't,

31
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.360
it doesn't do it justice.
And um,
then there's,

32
00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:51.300
there's like a mall,
I don't know how far away it is.

33
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.750
<v 0>Okay.</v>

34
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.410
<v 1>Say like,
I don't know,
three to five miles away.
They actually have one.</v>

35
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.240
So right as we're getting on the roof,

36
00:01:58.241 --> 00:02:00.070
they usually get into their finale cause you know,

37
00:02:00.071 --> 00:02:01.630
people bring their kids to the mall.

38
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.120
You know one of those fucking malls that has like a trolley that drives around

39
00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:12.121
it and they play like Tony Bennett Sinatra and everybody feels like,

40
00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:16.270
you know,
like they're a winner is you're walking in and out of the gap.

41
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.080
Luck be a lady two night,

42
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.580
never let her out of my sight is overall so good at me.

43
00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:32.290
He'll lab,
why don't you put them on you fucking Tba Shit.

44
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.450
Who is over law if you're not growing food,
if you're wearing overalls,

45
00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:39.640
if you not in an early nineties R and B band,

46
00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:43.330
you're basically wearing it because that's what your stomach feels comfortable

47
00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:45.970
and you know,
it's like,

48
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.550
it's like you're pregnant as a guy.
Did he have one of those,

49
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.010
you know those satchels that people were,

50
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.340
you know where the one of those little swath fucking whatever it is,

51
00:02:57.341 --> 00:03:00.640
it's like a blanket and it's like a paper route bag.

52
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.340
At the same time when there's like a baby in there,

53
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.590
all the baby in this case is your big fucking round stomach.
You know,

54
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:10.780
I want to try to fetch the shame.
Some people come on,

55
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:13.990
people make a keen was salad.

56
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.650
I guess Keno Wa even though it's spelled oh a is not the way to say it.

57
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:21.580
Some fucking asshole on Twitter's giving me shit.
You driving me crazy.

58
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.990
It's pronounced.
Woah.

59
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.230
What kind of a man knows how keenwah Okinawa is even fucking pronounced.

60
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.273
Okay.

61
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.170
You know what kind of man knows something like that besides an h and f is a

62
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:38.860
fucking somebody who's comfortable with themselves.

63
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.730
Somebody who realizes that meat is a lie.

64
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.710
Now I'm fucking with you.
I'm actually,

65
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:52.180
I've really cut down with my meat intake just out of pure vanity.
I love it.

66
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.460
You don't eat meat.
Your fucking stomach goes away.

67
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.050
The fat has nowhere to hide.
Or as they say in long island,

68
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.650
high tide,
it has no way to hide.

69
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.570
Um,
if,
um,
yeah,

70
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.190
it's got nowhere to fucking go.

71
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.610
I cooked this weekend like a,

72
00:04:16.611 --> 00:04:20.290
a yoga instructor slash of fat.
Fuck.

73
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.390
You know,
I made,

74
00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:27.391
my key was salad Kinawa however the fuck you saying,

75
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.590
I made that thing,
which is great.

76
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:33.640
Fills you up like pancake batter and you just pour it down your gullet and

77
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:37.480
you're like,
I'm good.
You know it's funny as they say,
it's a complete protein,

78
00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:41.200
but you can add chicken to it.
In other words,
it's not a complete protein.

79
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.540
All right.
All right.

80
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:46.420
There you with your fucking stretchy pants in your bare feet.

81
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:50.650
Stop fucking saying it's a complete protein.
I know it isn't.
Okay.

82
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.930
And I made that and then,
uh,

83
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.000
and made this peaches and beach salad with goat cheese.
I said,

84
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.420
I don't give a fuck what you guys say.

85
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.710
You can call me a fucking Douche all day long.
A fucking twinkle toes.

86
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:04.810
I don't care.
It's great.

87
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.470
Fills me up and I wake up the next morning and my fucking white stomach's a

88
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:11.770
little smaller.
You have to try it.

89
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.460
I actually went to the grocery store and I bought organic beets where it had

90
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:20.830
like the fucking leaves,
like some asshole Asshole,

91
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.560
some migrant worker,
you know,

92
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.510
<v 3>because America's though worth those jobs.
Lee grue beats of those goods.
We,</v>

93
00:05:27.511 --> 00:05:29.190
they'd be fluidly Lowe's beat.

94
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.733
<v 2>MMM.</v>

95
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.650
<v 1>We actually had to pay people and we still kept our yards.</v>

96
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.100
It would be $40 a beat.
Um,

97
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.980
can everybody explained to me the economics of that?

98
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:47.470
Why everything has to be done outside of this country?

99
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:51.370
Or it would be nine zillion dollars and don't even fucking just say it's because

100
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:54.280
of the unions.
I know it's partly because of that,

101
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.250
but the other part is those people with those fucking yachts that I saw in

102
00:05:58.251 --> 00:05:59.120
Sandro pay,

103
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.460
in order for somebody to get a boat that fucking big legally without being a

104
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:09.110
fucking pirate,
there's gotta be somebody crying in a field and El Salvador,

105
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:11.270
Poland,
organic beets out of the fucking ground,

106
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.560
or allegedly organic beets out of the ground to the tune of about eight pesos a

107
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:16.394
fucking month.

108
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:17.783
<v 0>Right?</v>

109
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.050
<v 1>Isn't that how it works?
Isn't that how it works?
I don't fucking know.</v>

110
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.010
All I know is,
is something going on with all these gated communities?

111
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.940
We live in a gated community.
What the fuck are you doing?

112
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.670
Or what do you know that's going to happen?
And right there.
You're,
you're,
you're,

113
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.700
you're fucking,
uh,
what do you call those guys at not a build shit

114
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.403
Freemason.

115
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.340
I'd like how people get mad at free masons cause they know how to make shit and

116
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:50.960
they don't want to tell you about it.
You know,

117
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.670
don't you have a secret recipe with your barbecued ribs there?
You know,

118
00:06:55.671 --> 00:06:58.060
where your fucking cream pie or whatever the hell you make.
Don't,

119
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.920
isn't that a secret family recipe?
Well,

120
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.820
the secret family recipe with the free masons is they understand how the

121
00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:09.110
universe works and if they went and told you how the universe works,

122
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:13.810
next thing you know you're off the grid.
You know,
growing apples in your toaster,

123
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.530
you don't have to pay for electric power.

124
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:19.070
Why would you go to that cubicle with your four foot walls?
You wouldn't do it.

125
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.180
And then what would they be?
Where would their joy be

126
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.790
if they couldn't see you walking into a fucking building every day that you

127
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:31.020
didn't want to go to?
Where would their joy be?

128
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.410
What would fill up the dark souls?
What misery could they look at?

129
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.750
They were left to be tortured.

130
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.380
Like guess like torturing squirrels on their property.

131
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:44.783
<v 0>Right.</v>

132
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.070
<v 1>You don't want to do out here.
I want to fucking go up to that.</v>

133
00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:48.630
I want to go up to that Hearst mansion.

134
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:50.613
<v 0>MMM.</v>

135
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.560
<v 1>William Randolph Hearst,
whatever the fuck his name was.</v>

136
00:07:53.561 --> 00:07:57.760
He's like the original Rupert Murdoch and he fucking,

137
00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.380
he owned all of this shit.

138
00:07:59.381 --> 00:08:03.460
Why does Versie always call when I'm doing the podcast?
Um,

139
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.200
he's like the original,
uh,
what the fuck.

140
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:11.900
We're out Rupert Murdoch and he owned fucking everything.

141
00:08:11.901 --> 00:08:16.430
Allegedly a citizen.
Kane was about him,
but he has,

142
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.550
he has the Hearst castle somewhere between here and San Francisco.

143
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.220
And uh,
it takes you like three days to get through it.

144
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:30.530
This was the guy's fucking house.
And I actually shot a,
a a scene one time,

145
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.660
not one time about,
um,
the last month who's getting home.
Uh,
also,
uh,

146
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.820
did a sketch for Kroll show.
I might as well hype dad.

147
00:08:37.821 --> 00:08:40.880
I think Nicole is a fucking genius.
So I hope you guys watch the next season.

148
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.970
I got to do a little bit of acting work on that.
And,
uh,

149
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:49.300
we shot in a building that used to be owned by a William Randolph Hearst and

150
00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:54.560
allegedly big word,
allegedly,

151
00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:00.120
there was a secret elevator in there that old,

152
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:04.410
uh,
or Billy,
a not red face,
used to bring up his,

153
00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:08.790
uh,
extra curricular sin,
you know,

154
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.260
with their fucking Louis really little buttons and whatever the fuck is fucking

155
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:17.130
horse.
He had a whore elevator.
That's when you know,
you got money,

156
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.650
you know,
I of all those MTV cribs and shack with this giant fucking bed,

157
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.240
right.
And fucking Redman with people sleeping on the floor of his fucking place.

158
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:31.650
You never saw anybody with a whore elevator to this day.

159
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.130
You know,
it's fucking brilliant.

160
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.770
The whore elevator,

161
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.260
when the fuck was the elevator invented?
That seems like some early 19 hundreds,

162
00:09:45.261 --> 00:09:49.940
possibly late 18 hundreds type of shit,
you know,

163
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.450
and you know,
in the late 18 hundreds when they first came up with it,

164
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.080
they probably had like fucking six year olds pulling people up in it.

165
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.020
And it was completely legal.
Um,

166
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.860
but anyways,
this guy had a whore elevators.
So,
I mean,

167
00:10:06.861 --> 00:10:10.730
if he had a whore elevator at fucking work,
I'm not going to look at his house.

168
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.360
I got to do it.
Um,
so anyways,

169
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.650
I've been off since I did my special and uh,
I actually got,

170
00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:21.300
I'm finally gonna sit down and watch it tonight.

171
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.320
I made the lovely Nia promise me that you sit down and watch with me cause you

172
00:10:25.321 --> 00:10:28.740
know,
it's not,
it's,
it's a fucking outer body experience.
All right?

173
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.830
It's one thing to take a video and look at it and we'll,

174
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.220
you know of yourself doing something dumb.
That's one thing.

175
00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:38.010
But to know that a bunch of people are going to fucking see the thing that

176
00:10:38.011 --> 00:10:41.880
really makes you,
it makes you a little bit nuts,
you know?

177
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.640
So I got all my other busy work out of the fucking way.

178
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:48.390
It's why I'm doing the podcast here Sunday night.
And um,

179
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.930
cause I know I got to get this fucking 800 pound gorilla off my shoulders.

180
00:10:51.931 --> 00:10:55.750
I got to sit down and watch,
I gotta watch the fucking thing,

181
00:10:55.751 --> 00:10:58.600
which I don't want to do.
Um,

182
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.250
Oh God,
I'm dreading that.
Anyways.
Uh,

183
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.840
the fuck was I talking about?
So I'm really enjoying just,
you know,

184
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:12.070
last since I got back from Vegas,
just not doing shit.

185
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:17.130
I didn't do shit all week other than a make my fucking twinkle toe stuff.

186
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.460
Oh.
And then I,
I also,
I made this fucking dessert.

187
00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.300
I just love when you guys trash me for whatever I do.
Uh,

188
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:31.230
I made this chocolate chip cheesecake with a chocolate crust and I can't even

189
00:11:31.451 --> 00:11:36.451
tell you guys how ridiculously excited I was to make my first like look like a

190
00:11:36.791 --> 00:11:40.300
Brownie crust.
And I was always wondering how the fuck do you make the crust?

191
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.810
Why do you get the chocolate in there?
It's just like this cocoa powder.

192
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.310
You put a little bit in there,
then you sift the fucking thing down,
right?

193
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.480
You put in your fucking shortening.
I overcooked it.

194
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.000
How do you tell getting golden brown when it's chocolate?

195
00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.283
<v 2>You know?</v>

196
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:03.500
<v 1>Oh,
fucking get it.
Anyways,
so I ate one of those things today and I feel sick.</v>

197
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.290
It was too much,
you know?

198
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:07.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

199
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.400
<v 1>Fucking too much.
What am I talking about?
I don't know what I'm talking about.</v>

200
00:12:10.401 --> 00:12:15.320
I'm on fucking vacation.
I'm living in my own goddamn world out here.
So,

201
00:12:15.321 --> 00:12:19.610
uh,
other than that,
yeah,
I was,
I was hiking with my dog all this week.

202
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.990
We're still getting the work done in the house.
And I had the dog,
uh,

203
00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:27.020
she stays at the vet during the day cause she gets freaked out when the workers

204
00:12:27.021 --> 00:12:28.640
are making all that God damn noise.

205
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.220
<v 2>And um,</v>

206
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:31.721
<v 1>so,
you know,</v>

207
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:34.390
I was on the road getting ready to do the special and I hadn't seen her in like

208
00:12:34.391 --> 00:12:39.130
a week and I came back and she was fucking fat.
Eight a fat people.

209
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.860
They love her over the vet and she loves them.

210
00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:44.380
My dog loves anybody that takes care of him first.
She's like,

211
00:12:44.381 --> 00:12:47.470
who the fuck are you within the second you take care of her,

212
00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:51.490
she turns into a little lap dog and a,
so they love her to death.

213
00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:53.730
So they're always giving her treats and I fucking see her.

214
00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:57.200
I almost didn't recognize her.
You know what I mean?
You're like,

215
00:12:57.201 --> 00:12:59.760
when you go to your high school reunion after 20 years and you really got to,

216
00:12:59.761 --> 00:13:00.730
you got to kind of look,

217
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.960
does like a little part of the forehead and the eyes is where you can still see

218
00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:07.990
the person that you used to know.
And um,

219
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.450
<v 0>okay,</v>

220
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.330
<v 1>that's what I was doing.
So I went on a bunch of long hikes with my dog.</v>

221
00:13:12.331 --> 00:13:13.350
Fortunate,
she's a pit bull,

222
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.710
she's all my muscles and she's back in shape after like three,
four days.

223
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.600
And that was basically my weekend.
And um,
oh,

224
00:13:21.601 --> 00:13:26.100
I forgot to mention.
So we ended up going up on the roof
to,

225
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.300
to watch the fucking fire works.

226
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:31.420
<v 2>And uh,</v>

227
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:35.400
<v 1>so we go up there and everybody's shooting them off and everything.</v>

228
00:13:35.401 --> 00:13:37.110
And every year I sat and I go,
you know,

229
00:13:37.111 --> 00:13:42.090
it's fucking amazing that all these people just randomly,
and this,

230
00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.280
there's some people this shooting off some real shit,

231
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.650
not just like bottle rockets.

232
00:13:47.651 --> 00:13:52.180
This shoot enough stuff that blows up and shoots out until like a ball,

233
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:57.580
you know.
And it usually happens,
you know,
I dunno,
two,

234
00:13:57.581 --> 00:13:59.020
300 feet up off the ground.

235
00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:03.010
They shoot him up and it goes off at like 75 feet off the fucking ground in

236
00:14:03.011 --> 00:14:06.040
between these apartment buildings.
So I'm standing on the roof.

237
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:07.550
<v 0>Okay.</v>

238
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:10.970
<v 1>And I'm literally saying to my wife,
I go,
you know,</v>

239
00:14:10.971 --> 00:14:15.620
it's unbelievable every year how all of these things get shut off and nobody

240
00:14:15.621 --> 00:14:20.150
likes their high house on fire.
And within fucking two minutes to me saying that,

241
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:22.263
<v 2>mmm,</v>

242
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:27.420
<v 1>I look in the distance and I'm thinking like,
wow,
that that firework is,</v>

243
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:29.130
is lasting pretty long.

244
00:14:29.131 --> 00:14:34.131
And I look at it and it has that undeniable orange glow slash dancing of fire.

245
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:39.870
And I'm like,
that's a fire.
Somebody let that fucking ass on fire.
Right?

246
00:14:39.871 --> 00:14:44.220
And I look into them.
Sure enough,
I couldn't believe how fast it spread.

247
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.940
And next thing you know,
there's a helicopter flying around it.
And then you know,

248
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.660
off to the left,
we hear the fire engine starting come down.

249
00:14:51.661 --> 00:14:55.910
And as fast as that thing lit ignited,

250
00:14:55.911 --> 00:15:00.500
and as fast as it spread,
they fucking put that thing out.
I'm sure they,

251
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:05.600
you know,
drowned everything that anybody owned in the building,
but a,

252
00:15:05.601 --> 00:15:10.430
they put it out pretty God damn quick.
And,
uh,
so I got video of it.

253
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.500
I don't know.
I mean maybe I'll put it up there.

254
00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:15.060
I was actually talking to Virginia when I was on the phone.
I think I would,

255
00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.230
it was him that I said,
maybe I'll,
I'll,
I'll post the video.

256
00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:20.463
<v 0>MMM.</v>

257
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:22.360
<v 1>It's not it,
but I,
you know,</v>

258
00:15:22.361 --> 00:15:24.220
I'm not going to post it because this is not a good video.
You know,

259
00:15:24.221 --> 00:15:27.280
his fucking cell phone at night and this happened like in a,

260
00:15:27.281 --> 00:15:28.840
probably a good mile and a half away,

261
00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.053
<v 0>whatever,</v>

262
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:36.010
<v 1>whatever.
So somebody looked at house on fire.
So that was,
that was interesting.</v>

263
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.470
You know,
it was funny.
My mother in law was hilarious.

264
00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:43.530
What she was just like saying something to the effect that the,

265
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.880
she'd wished the person did that later on during the fireworks show because none

266
00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:51.280
of the fireworks could,
could follow.

267
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.990
Basically somebody lighting their house on fire.

268
00:15:53.991 --> 00:15:56.710
If there was like way more exciting than then you went back to the fireworks.

269
00:15:56.711 --> 00:15:57.790
It's just like,
Eh,
you know,

270
00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.330
it's kind of like doing your closing joke in the middle of your act.

271
00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.720
You know what I mean?
It's kind of like gang,

272
00:16:04.721 --> 00:16:07.930
I don't know what the fuck else it's like.
So anyways,
um,

273
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.580
<v 0>okay.</v>

274
00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.860
<v 1>Do you think would have been rude of me if I,</v>

275
00:16:10.861 --> 00:16:15.820
I live right next to him and I put on ACDC houses on fire.
This house is on fire,

276
00:16:15.821 --> 00:16:17.650
you know,
is their house was on fire.

277
00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.760
No talking heads burning down the house with that.
But that big noxious,

278
00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:26.670
I think it would be,
what is the proper music to play when you're,

279
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.640
when you fucking neighbors like their house on fire.

280
00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:34.220
What is the respectful thing to do?
Is there,

281
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.590
is there some country song saying,
I'm sorry,
your trailers on final fucking,

282
00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.580
I don't know.
This is the Monday morning podcast everybody.
And I'm like I said,

283
00:16:41.581 --> 00:16:45.950
I'm doing it Sunday night and I don't have my,
um,

284
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.390
I don't have any advertising yet,

285
00:16:48.391 --> 00:16:50.910
so I'm just gonna have to pause here cause I'm not the drop this shit.

286
00:16:50.911 --> 00:16:55.860
And after I,
uh,
after I record shit.
So with that,

Hey Ya.
About those reads.
Was I going to what?

315
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:48.390
Eh,
fuck you.
I suck every week,
but whatever.
I'm trying.

316
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.760
<v 0>Okay,</v>

317
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.550
<v 1>so let's get down to brass tacks.
Let's talk about what went well.</v>

318
00:18:52.551 --> 00:18:56.600
What went on this week.
I was in our Las Vegas.
Um,

319
00:18:56.601 --> 00:18:57.830
I boosted it up.

320
00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:58.720
<v 0>Okay.</v>

321
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.290
<v 1>And then I immediately went back on the wagon and I've been able to hold out.</v>

322
00:19:02.291 --> 00:19:06.720
I had one beer,
I had one beer last night.
That was it.
And,
um,

323
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.170
but I'm definitely going to stay back on the wagon because I don't want to

324
00:19:10.171 --> 00:19:14.400
fucking,
uh,
you know,
I don't want to have a big booze head again.

325
00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.280
They'd have to go through all that bullshit trying to lose the fucking way you

326
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:20.880
gotta.
You gotta fucking,
you've got to keep it in check.
You know,

327
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:24.740
I'm want to tell them this story on stage and his kind of bombing,
so maybe it's,

328
00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:29.730
it's better for the podcast.
Do you know I was fucking driving right.

329
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.450
And I stopped at a red light,
you know,
four way stop.

330
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.570
So the person to the right of me,
you know,

331
00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:40.860
he's got the green light and he makes a left in front of me and he was so

332
00:19:40.861 --> 00:19:41.880
fucking fat.

333
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:46.910
He like leaned his head right down to his man boob and his arm out the window,

334
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.630
kind of holding on to the car as he was picking terror.

335
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.150
So basically he wouldn't roll over and fucking crushes passenger.

336
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:00.470
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

337
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.900
<v 1>I mean at what point do you just say,
all right,</v>

338
00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:04.320
<v 0>okay.</v>

339
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.360
<v 1>I guess it really is like a drug addict.
I mean,</v>

340
00:20:06.361 --> 00:20:10.580
you see a fucking drug addict laying in the God damn street going over and

341
00:20:10.581 --> 00:20:14.600
taking a dump on a fucking,
I dunno what Shrub.

342
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.610
At what point do you like,
like,
dude,
I,

343
00:20:17.611 --> 00:20:21.590
I sleep on a sidewalk and I shit outside before you like,
hey,
you know what,

344
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.810
maybe I,
uh,
you know,
kind of knocked down the whole fucking heroin use.

345
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.180
Maybe ought to take it down a few notches.

346
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:31.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

347
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.400
<v 1>I don't,
there's only a few things I've seen like that.</v>

348
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.120
I saw this fat guy in Seattle one time.

349
00:20:38.121 --> 00:20:42.440
He walked by me and he was gradually picking up speed with the momentum of his

350
00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:47.000
fucking weight and he went by me and I felt this wind,
it was unreal.

351
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:51.040
Really is like,
I really is a fucking drug.
Um,

352
00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.550
I really believe that I didn't before,
but I can tell you,
uh,

353
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.430
just go veggie for two days,
man.

354
00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.160
<v 0>Okay.</v>

355
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.620
<v 1>That's like the shit that what's said Shit.</v>

356
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.860
They get Methadone or something to get you off the heroin.
They'll listen to me.

357
00:21:04.861 --> 00:21:09.180
I don't what the fuck I'm talking about.
Um,
so anyways,
back to Vegas.

358
00:21:09.181 --> 00:21:13.280
So we had the Monday off me,
Bart,
nick,

359
00:21:13.281 --> 00:21:15.540
law head and [inaudible] and uh,

360
00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:20.160
so we want to bet on something we're bored shitless,
does nothing to bet on.

361
00:21:20.161 --> 00:21:21.460
So we ended up betting on me.

362
00:21:21.461 --> 00:21:25.870
But Nick and Versie bet on Albania to beat the,

363
00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.160
the Germans,
I think they'll play in Germany.
I don't fucking know.

364
00:21:29.161 --> 00:21:33.840
And we sat there,
we put money on Albanian a,
when I put 100 bucks on them,

365
00:21:33.841 --> 00:21:37.320
the win.
And then I put 25 bucks down on a tie.

366
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:42.600
It was basically one,
one,
two,
two zero,
zero are nil nil.
As they say.

367
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.680
After 90 minutes I'd went.

368
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.840
So I don't think I've ever been that interested in a fucking soccer game in my

369
00:21:48.841 --> 00:21:51.330
life.
And I'm telling you,

370
00:21:51.331 --> 00:21:55.530
I learned the secret to all Americans who don't give a fuck about world cup

371
00:21:55.531 --> 00:21:59.430
soccer.
If you want to give a shit but 100 bucks on the,
on the underdog,

372
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.010
you will find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat.

373
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:07.040
I got a picture of us sitting there in the casino and we our eyes,

374
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.250
you would think we were watching the final two minutes of a fucking super bowl

375
00:22:11.251 --> 00:22:14.130
and Joe Montana's got the ball.
That's how much we were watching this shit.

376
00:22:14.131 --> 00:22:18.960
And in the beginning when Albania is,
we thought scored,
we thought they scored,

377
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:23.850
we lost our fucking minds.
We jumped up,
right?

378
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.730
And there was all these other people who are from Albania and they've got such a

379
00:22:26.731 --> 00:22:30.150
kick out of the fact that these three white dudes were absolutely losing their

380
00:22:30.151 --> 00:22:35.090
shit.
You know that Albania scored
well.

381
00:22:35.091 --> 00:22:37.060
Yeah.
Now clearly we would.
They would think,
wow.

382
00:22:37.061 --> 00:22:41.070
Well how come they're not for the though the whities there in Germany.
Um,

383
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.880
but of course this unbelievable pass this guy at an unbelievable,

384
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.140
and the fucking ball goes into the net.
We lose our mind,
right?

385
00:22:52.141 --> 00:22:56.580
The guy did a one timer with his head.
We go fucking nuts.
Like,
well,

386
00:22:56.581 --> 00:22:59.250
watch the Stanley Cup playoffs.
And guess what?

387
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:04.620
Guess what it was offsides.
Can you believe it?

388
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:08.520
I can't fucking believe it.
It was fucking off sides.

389
00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.780
It's always off sides.
It's always fun.
I tweeted that.

390
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:18.340
So one thing I learned about world cup soccer,
anytime it gets exciting,

391
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.040
that means it's off sides.

392
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:25.320
The amount of fucking times and how the defensive line could just stop and then

393
00:23:26.891 --> 00:23:29.440
make you offline.
Start running your pussy.

394
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:35.860
I have to slow down cause you slowed down.
I swear to God.

395
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:37.480
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

396
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.420
<v 1>I swear to God,
man.
If I had enough money to start a soccer league,</v>

397
00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:44.230
I would teach the world how to play that fucking game and I would get just the

398
00:23:44.231 --> 00:23:48.350
same way the NHL rid of the fucking red line,
that bullshit.

399
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:53.930
I put a fucking blue line out there just like in hockey.
All right,

400
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.380
and once a year in the fucking zone.
That's it.

401
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.050
If somebody can run faster than you,
then guess what?

402
00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.940
He's going to take a nice fucking shot at that Goddamn goal that's as big as a

403
00:24:04.941 --> 00:24:08.600
fucking house and we're going to start having some nine to eight games.

404
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:10.130
<v 0>Okay.</v>

405
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.410
<v 1>Poor bastards running around for eight miles</v>

406
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.170
to have a game be nothing to nothing.
Sure.
I want 105 bucks.

407
00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.260
That was something like that.
I think I ended up being up 20.

408
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.240
I lost a hundred on Albania to win,
but I,

409
00:24:24.241 --> 00:24:29.241
I got the tie and this is how fucking dumb we were when it went into extra time

410
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.400
and Germany scored the goal,
we were like,
ah,
Shit.

411
00:24:34.401 --> 00:24:38.810
And we got up and we walked out and everybody else was sitting there and I'm

412
00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:41.120
thinking like,
oh,
they must be waiting to watch the next game.

413
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:45.920
And then we go up to the pool,
took a steam,
went out to the fucking pool,

414
00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.230
just acting like idiots.

415
00:24:48.231 --> 00:24:51.770
I kept introducing Paul Versey every woman that would walk by and be like,

416
00:24:51.771 --> 00:24:54.200
excuse me Ma'am Ma'am Ma'am Ma'am,

417
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.080
just want to let you know New Jersey Zone.

418
00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:01.820
Paul Versey I just thought you should know that he is in your presence right
now.

419
00:25:01.821 --> 00:25:05.210
And I swear to God for some reason that was working.
Um,

420
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:10.910
but anyways,
so we end up having a drink in like fucking Pina coladas.

421
00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.920
I don't think I've ever had a peanut out of my life,
but it just made sense.

422
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:19.880
It was like 108 degrees out and it's like that drink is mostly ice.

423
00:25:19.881 --> 00:25:20.990
And it has an umbrella.

424
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.680
Maybe I can hold it over my nose and try not to get a sunburn there,

425
00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.260
so I'm drinking that shit and afterwards,

426
00:25:27.261 --> 00:25:30.890
later on that night we're getting hammered at some bar and we start watching the

427
00:25:30.891 --> 00:25:35.810
highlights of Albania waiting to see that goal that didn't count and then see

428
00:25:35.811 --> 00:25:40.100
the German goal in the extra time that we thought ended it and we're sitting

429
00:25:40.101 --> 00:25:40.800
there watching it.

430
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:45.800
Germany scores and then Albania scores and then Germany scores ends up being two

431
00:25:46.701 --> 00:25:50.960
to one.
We like,
wait a minute,
what the fuck happened here?
This is still the same.

432
00:25:50.961 --> 00:25:54.860
This is a game from earlier,
earlier this,
this season.
What the fuck is this?

433
00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.340
I guess with extended time it just kept,
keeps going.

434
00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.930
We thought it was like sudden death.
The first guy who scores wins.

435
00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:06.260
So we fucking walked out.
I mean it didn't change our our bed at all,

436
00:26:06.261 --> 00:26:10.040
but now the looks on the people's faces.
When we got up and walked out,

437
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:14.450
it made a lot more sense to sort of look of confusion like where are they going?

438
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:18.620
Where are those fun loving Americans?
That flipped out more than we did.

439
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.310
Where the fuck are they going?
So,
so I learned that.

440
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.300
I still think it's a great game.
I know I've shit all over it,
but it's just fun.

441
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:30.980
It's fun.
And knowing people from other countries,
you know,
I enjoy the game.

442
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.340
All right.
Uh,
I do find it extremely confusing.

443
00:26:34.341 --> 00:26:38.860
I find the uniforms unbelievably fucking confusing.
Okay.

444
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.240
Like I was sitting there,
uh,

445
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:46.340
I don't know where the fuck I was in the Netherlands versus Costa Rica Zone.

446
00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:52.830
All right.
I've been to both places.
I got treated great in both places.

447
00:26:52.831 --> 00:26:54.540
So I'm like,
well,
who the fuck do I root for?

448
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.830
And then I find out that Costa Rica is the under dog.
So I'm like,
all right,

449
00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:01.710
I'll go with the underdog.
The Costa Rican is right.
And then I'm sitting there,

450
00:27:01.711 --> 00:27:06.240
I'm trying to figure out which team is which.
Okay.

451
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.420
Because they both have like red,

452
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.790
white and blue flags as far as I know.

453
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:15.720
But like one team is wearing fucking orange,
all orange.

454
00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.260
And I'm like,
I don't know who the fuck is who I'm looking at the uniforms.

455
00:27:20.261 --> 00:27:21.430
I'm trying to find a flag.

456
00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:25.450
And finally what you gotta do is you've got to racially profile him to figure

457
00:27:25.451 --> 00:27:29.230
out who the fuck is,
you know,
and then you know,

458
00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:32.350
there's always going to be a couple of black dudes or something like that.

459
00:27:32.351 --> 00:27:37.180
Somebody with a Tan.
So it's gonna throw you off when you go on.
Like,
okay,

460
00:27:37.181 --> 00:27:39.250
he looks like he looks like he's from the Netherlands.

461
00:27:39.251 --> 00:27:41.800
He looks like he's from no law.
That guy looks like he's from Africa.

462
00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:44.260
I don't fucking know.

463
00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.760
You ain't got to sit there for 90 minutes and wait til somebody scores and see

464
00:27:48.761 --> 00:27:53.060
what the fuck number goes to figure out who the hell's hill wasn't that bad.

465
00:27:53.061 --> 00:27:55.510
It took me,
but it honestly took me a good,
like a minute and a half,

466
00:27:55.511 --> 00:27:59.290
two minutes to figure out who the fuck was,
who.
I don't think that's right.

467
00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.320
And I don't like that creepy moment too where they hold hands with children and

468
00:28:02.321 --> 00:28:06.880
walk out.
All right.
There's been too much coverage of fucking,

469
00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:10.570
uh,
pedophiles and that type of stuff as an American in my country,

470
00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.290
they got everything.
They,
they've made kids weird.
You don't,
you don't touch them.

471
00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.980
You don't go near him.
You don't hold their fucking hands.
Okay.

472
00:28:17.981 --> 00:28:21.550
I guess it makes it safe because everybody's looking,
but it's just,

473
00:28:21.551 --> 00:28:24.130
it's really fucking creepy.
You know,

474
00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.470
taking their hands and you're walking them out onto the pitch.

475
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.500
That's like when you're in a titty bar and you're dumb enough to go get the

476
00:28:31.501 --> 00:28:34.170
private dance.
She takes you by your hand and she walks out in the back.

477
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.380
It's just,
it's fucking creepy.
You don't do that.
All right?

478
00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:43.810
You don't have them run through fountains in public either with no shirt on.

479
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:48.190
Okay.
They want to do that shit.
You do it in the backyard.
Okay.
That's your kid.

480
00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:52.090
Okay.
Fucking turn on that little fucking sprinkler in the back.

481
00:28:52.091 --> 00:28:53.350
Have the kid run through that shit.

482
00:28:53.351 --> 00:28:56.950
You don't bring him down to the God damn mall like they do in Columbus,
Ohio.

483
00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:58.870
Whenever I do the funny bone out there,

484
00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:03.670
it's a bunch of fucking little kids doing a fucking wet t shirt concert,
um,

485
00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.370
contest.
Right.
I swear to God,
if I was,
if I were,

486
00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:10.270
if I worked for the special victims unit,

487
00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.680
that's where I would park my ass on a slow week and I would just look for

488
00:29:14.681 --> 00:29:17.080
somebody and join that shit a little bit too much.

489
00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.870
Um,
so anyways,
so that was the deal.

490
00:29:26.871 --> 00:29:31.640
I made money on roulette.
I made money twice.
I made money,
uh,

491
00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:36.020
throwing dice.
I made money on the tie of Albania.

492
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.920
I wasn't Benton big,
but I would just,
I would,

493
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.100
I would lose a little early and then I would win.

494
00:29:42.101 --> 00:29:44.140
And then I just walked away and I was fucking done.

495
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:50.220
So I think in the end I probably made somewhere between two and 300 bucks and

496
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:56.590
that was about it.
That was about it.
All right.
And,
uh,
other than that,

497
00:29:56.591 --> 00:30:00.730
I haven't been doing shit all week.
I'm trying to forget my last hour,

498
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.430
hour and a half of material,
uh,
went out last night.

499
00:30:03.431 --> 00:30:06.490
I did a little bit of stand up.
I got a,

500
00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:11.760
I got one new fucking five minute block starting over again.

501
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:18.550
I Dunno,
I got nothing.
I got nothing.
I don't know what the fuck to tell you.
Um,

502
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.830
what else did anybody,
uh,
anybody watched the,
uh,

503
00:30:23.831 --> 00:30:25.360
the UFC last night?

504
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:26.820
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

505
00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:31.620
<v 1>that Erickson Guy,
whatever the fuck his name is.
Fonte Benicio Del Toro.</v>

506
00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.750
What was it?
Benicio del Toro head with Brad Pitt's torso from fight club.

507
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:38.683
<v 2>MMM.</v>

508
00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.990
<v 1>First three rounds were kind of boring and then it got,
and it got good.</v>

509
00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.020
I got really fucking good.
And Ronda Rousey,

510
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:51.430
Ronda Rousey over the fuck you say her name?
She fucking a dude.

511
00:30:51.431 --> 00:30:54.400
She beat up the check that she was fighting the way my older brother used to

512
00:30:54.401 --> 00:30:58.840
beat me up.
You know,
I'd get a couple in and then he just put me in a headlock,

513
00:30:58.841 --> 00:31:03.190
throw me over his hip and then just give me a bunch of nuggies except there was

514
00:31:03.191 --> 00:31:05.350
no,
there was no ref to break it up.

515
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:10.210
I was actually upset when the referee broke it up and I didn't realize that her

516
00:31:10.211 --> 00:31:13.810
arm had gone limp.
Jesus Christ,

517
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.240
she took like seven punches right to the forehead.

518
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.440
You know what's funny about the UFC?
Like,
you just can't fucking,

519
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:23.200
you can never get over there quick enough.

520
00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:27.670
At least in boxing when you get fucking knocked out,

521
00:31:27.671 --> 00:31:30.940
you'd go down and the guy goes to the other corner and that sport,

522
00:31:30.941 --> 00:31:34.930
they rush you when they fucking wet desert with digit with daddy banging and

523
00:31:34.931 --> 00:31:39.490
banging and banging and the fucking ref is coming over like you always take like

524
00:31:39.491 --> 00:31:43.290
another three,
four.
I Dunno,

525
00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:47.890
have it said that I still love the sport and a verse,
he always gives me shit.

526
00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.960
He fucking texted me last night.
He goes,
uh,
I texted him,
I said,
hey,

527
00:31:52.961 --> 00:31:55.120
I'm watching that sport yet you'll love,

528
00:31:55.210 --> 00:32:00.040
cause he's always shitting on it and watching the UFC.
And he said,
uh,

529
00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:04.390
he goes,
I'm watching it too.
And he goes,
uh,
he goes,
I like the UFC.

530
00:32:04.391 --> 00:32:07.990
I just think boxing is better.
And I texted him back.
I was like,
yeah,

531
00:32:07.991 --> 00:32:12.220
I kind of guessed that the first 18 times you told me that he's one of those

532
00:32:12.221 --> 00:32:15.250
guys who always hypes up.
Boxing is like the sweet science.

533
00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.340
We have a called it the sweet science first.

534
00:32:18.341 --> 00:32:20.050
I don't think ever got fucking knocked out.

535
00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:29.440
You know what we called it the sweet science never talked to a boxer that's in

536
00:32:29.441 --> 00:32:33.700
his fifties and sixties and is dealing with the fucking brain trauma.

537
00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.000
I mean I totally respect boxing.
You have sick,
I think,

538
00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.160
you know they're fucking warriors.
But um,

539
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.050
I just hate people who attack the UFC and they just go,

540
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:48.130
they have to fucking rolling around the ground and it looks like two guys about

541
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.820
ready to fuck each other.
It's just like,

542
00:32:49.821 --> 00:32:53.710
I understand a little bit who's getting new?

543
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:58.310
The guard is basically missionary position except somebody who's trying to

544
00:32:58.311 --> 00:33:02.390
fucking,
you know,
knock your fucking block off.

545
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:03.650
Other than that,

546
00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:05.240
<v 2>okay.</v>

547
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.380
<v 1>I guess it's a,
I guess it is a sexual position,</v>

548
00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:11.723
<v 2>but um,</v>

549
00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:15.780
<v 1>I will say this,
people who just always say that,
you know,
do it.</v>

550
00:33:15.781 --> 00:33:18.840
If they went up against the box,
there were a box,
it would blow blah,
blah,
blah,

551
00:33:18.841 --> 00:33:23.790
blah.
I don't think so.
I think it's like 50,
50.
Cause I remember when,

552
00:33:23.791 --> 00:33:27.680
uh,
what was it?
Tim Von Maniac.

553
00:33:27.681 --> 00:33:30.420
Sylvia fought that,
what the fuck was that guy's name?

554
00:33:30.421 --> 00:33:35.400
He had like the hardest head ever and he tried to grab him by the back of his

555
00:33:35.401 --> 00:33:38.790
neck and pull him down and fucking give him a knee to the head and the guy just

556
00:33:38.791 --> 00:33:43.140
threw an uppercut and knocked out Tim Silvia.
I think it would be about 50 50

557
00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.030
but I would have to get after a while,

558
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:52.090
I would think the UFC guys would learn to deal with the danger of a boxer's

559
00:33:53.001 --> 00:33:57.830
hands because I don't think anybody in the UFC can box is good as a professional

560
00:33:57.831 --> 00:34:01.040
boxer cause that's all they fucking do.
You know what I mean?

561
00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.430
Like I'm sure this is some quarterbacks in the NFL that can kick the ball,

562
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.020
you know,
can actually do a halfway decent punt,

563
00:34:09.021 --> 00:34:11.540
but they're not going to be better than the punter who sits there stretch in his

564
00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:13.970
fucking leg until he can do a total split.

565
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:16.340
Then never going to kick it farther than that guy.
Cause that's all he does.

566
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:20.060
So I would think even Muhammad Ali and his fucking prime

567
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:27.200
would have a hard time going 50 50 if all he knew was boxing because I would

568
00:34:27.291 --> 00:34:32.291
think that 50% of the time maybe he could catch the person as they came in and

569
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.020
tried to shoot his legs and I know,

570
00:34:36.021 --> 00:34:38.770
I don't know shit about this all you fight fans fucking relax.
All right,

571
00:34:38.771 --> 00:34:41.510
I got an hour here to kill.
This is me just,
you know,

572
00:34:41.511 --> 00:34:46.490
I took a couple of fucking Jujitsu classes and that was it before I was on to

573
00:34:46.491 --> 00:34:50.390
something else.
I was just like,
ah,
this,
this isn't for me.
You know what I mean?

574
00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:54.740
By the time I,
by the time Jiu Jitsu became,
people were doing it,

575
00:34:54.741 --> 00:34:57.860
I was already in my thirties and I was just like,
I'm too fucking old.

576
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.570
If we fucking rolling around on the ground,
you know,
I'm giving up my wallet.

577
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:05.690
Okay,
I'm at that age and I'm going to pray you don't kill me.

578
00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:14.240
Just tell you what man,
I don't want trouble.
I got a black belt in that.

579
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:16.670
So anyway,
just just fucking entertain me here.

580
00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:20.610
I would think that if,
uh,
you,
uh,
you,
uh,

581
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:24.230
mixed martial artists instead of a UFC guy or a woman,

582
00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:29.180
if they were to fucking fight a professional boxer,
obviously,

583
00:35:29.181 --> 00:35:34.010
you know,
they're throwing hands.
So all I would do,

584
00:35:34.011 --> 00:35:38.100
I would stay outside.
If I had an person's skill,

585
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:42.840
I would stay outside of their hands and I would just do what Joe Rogan loves the

586
00:35:42.841 --> 00:35:47.841
best the fucking leg kicks and just keep smacking him in the fucking thigh over

587
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:52.650
and over and over again.
Chop them down.

588
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.280
And then when you shoot the legs the second you get them on their back,

589
00:35:56.281 --> 00:36:00.060
they're fucked.
You have no,
if you have no fucking defense

590
00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.770
against somebody that knows how to grapple and ground and pound on the ground,

591
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.680
dude,
you're fucking done.
It's over.

592
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:09.190
<v 0>Okay.</v>

593
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:12.370
<v 1>Maybe I'm nuts.
Maybe I'm fucking crazy.
I don't know anything about this,</v>

594
00:36:12.371 --> 00:36:16.060
but I'll tell you this right now.
I was actually those,
those,
uh,

595
00:36:16.061 --> 00:36:19.140
the women of the your shoe.
Um,

596
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:20.980
<v 0>okay.</v>

597
00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:24.040
<v 1>Like what's her face?
Ronda Rousey,
what she did to that woman she could do to me.</v>

598
00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:29.110
I mean it will be all she fucking throw my pasty.
Yes,
right over a goddamn hip.

599
00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:38.130
Well I fucking powder of white legs would slam on the ground

600
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:40.620
and I would,

601
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:44.130
I dunno what I want and that would just be taking them to the fucking head.

602
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:48.720
I'd probably be making some really embarrassing like emasculating fucking noise

603
00:36:48.721 --> 00:36:53.250
in or I'm feeling like woo.
And that way I would lose consciousness.

604
00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.480
I think if I ever dated somebody,

605
00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:02.520
I was married to a woman that was as good a fighter as Rhonda is.

606
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:07.530
I would literally the amount of times
how would be like,
okay,
okay.
You know,

607
00:37:07.531 --> 00:37:10.560
just,
let's just talk this out.
All right.

608
00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:15.180
Just because you could,
she would literally be beating the shit out of me.

609
00:37:15.181 --> 00:37:18.660
What am I going to do?
Am I going to report it?
I couldn't.

610
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.970
That one I'd have to do is on the side.

611
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.590
I would have to start taking some classes just as a man,

612
00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.390
I can't fucking report this shit.

613
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:32.430
I'd have to start taking some classes to somehow get some sort of defense

614
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:35.520
against her,
throwing me across the fucking living room.

615
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:41.660
And then once the first time she ever saw any sort of beyond what the fuck I

616
00:37:43.111 --> 00:37:47.040
knew,
you know,
or what are you taking classes behind my back.

617
00:37:47.041 --> 00:37:48.960
And then she kicked the shit out of me.
Even worse.

618
00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:51.340
<v 0>Okay.</v>

619
00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:54.280
<v 1>Oh my God.
See,
this is why I wish the Chappelle show was still on.</v>

620
00:37:54.281 --> 00:37:58.210
How funny would fucking Dave Chappelle B and a God damn sketch

621
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:59.543
<v 0>yeah.</v>

622
00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:04.810
<v 1>About dating the UFC female champion and pissing her off,</v>

623
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:08.960
remembering the Rick James Sketch when he gets kicked in the air and he landed

624
00:38:08.961 --> 00:38:09.620
on that dresser,

625
00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:14.350
just imagine them using the same special effects of him getting thrown over that

626
00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.140
one of those judo throws.
Jesus Christ.

627
00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:25.280
That reminded me of,
of when I w I remember when in the late eighties,

628
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:30.890
um,
when you use the fucking like her fight her,
her title defense,

629
00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:35.920
that reminded me of Tyson in his prime as far how quickly it was over.

630
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:38.650
Do you remember that shit?

631
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:43.510
Anybody else of age that they remember ordering the Tyson fight?
Guys,

632
00:38:43.511 --> 00:38:48.490
come on over.
I got to Tyson fight and like
Tyson,

633
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:53.520
the fight ended before the pizza got there and everyone was just standing around

634
00:38:53.821 --> 00:38:57.670
and fucking eating a pizza that was too hot to bite into just going through

635
00:38:57.671 --> 00:39:01.120
those fucking bullshit cause like 45 bucks.

636
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.950
I still remember where I was winning and uh,
when he beat Michael Spinks,

637
00:39:05.951 --> 00:39:09.600
a buddy of mine,
we were in his newly finished basement.
Um,

638
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:13.600
the same basement I watched when Larry Bird stole the ball from Isaiah Thomas

639
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:16.210
and had a nice low ceiling.
I remember that.

640
00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:20.350
I jumped up and scrape my knuckles like raising Arizona.
Um,

641
00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:26.560
I remember we were,
we were there watching the fight and uh,

642
00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.560
we were beside ourselves,

643
00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:33.310
couldn't fucking believe it cause we didn't understand back then,
you know,

644
00:39:33.311 --> 00:39:36.010
the whole fucking liver punch and all that shit.
We just didn't get it.

645
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.220
We were like,
how the fuck is this guy?
Why should,

646
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:39.790
I think he took one to the head at that point.

647
00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.740
It took a shot to the side and then in the last,

648
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:46.000
you'd already gone down like fucking three times over and like 90,
91 seconds.

649
00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:47.860
And we were pissed.
He was funny.

650
00:39:47.861 --> 00:39:49.900
His house was the house that always ordered the fight.

651
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:55.180
I watched like the first wrestle mania over there.
God Damn it.

652
00:39:55.181 --> 00:39:58.630
Those were good times.
Good fucking time.
So anyways,
um,

653
00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:01.960
I still totally respect a boxing.
I respect all of that Shit,
man.

654
00:40:01.961 --> 00:40:03.250
I wish I knew how to do that stuff.

655
00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:07.300
I wish I could learn that shit without getting a brain damage,
you know?

656
00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:12.970
Um,
so anyways,
what do you guys think if Floyd Mayweather,

657
00:40:12.971 --> 00:40:17.170
cause that's the thing versus he always brings up,
oh did we had a fucking,

658
00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:23.960
we had a fucking epic argument where we're Versie was trying to say,

659
00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:27.960
I'm going to get him in trouble here because everyone's gonna fucking right into

660
00:40:27.961 --> 00:40:28.681
his podcast.

661
00:40:28.681 --> 00:40:33.681
He was trying to say that may weather would have beaten Hagler Hearns Duran and

662
00:40:35.701 --> 00:40:39.660
sugar ray Leonard.
And I was trying to say,
look,
you know,

663
00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:42.360
at best he goes two and two.
Okay.

664
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:46.950
I'm not trying to disrespect him and I'm not trying to disrespect them in verse,

665
00:40:46.951 --> 00:40:51.270
he just kept going.
He still fastest fighter ever.
That's what they said.

666
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:56.030
He has the fastest hands ever.
It's like,
okay,
okay.
Yeah.
The,

667
00:40:56.031 --> 00:40:58.590
the guys calling the fight who are selling the fight,

668
00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:02.820
who are trying to convince you that you are not wasting your money by ordering

669
00:41:02.821 --> 00:41:05.430
the paper view.
Yes.
They're hyping him up is the greatest,

670
00:41:05.431 --> 00:41:10.350
fastest and all that fucking shit.
But,
uh,
you know,
I dunno.

671
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:13.230
So me lie had in him gotten this screaming matches.

672
00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:16.560
Barnett sat there laughing as we were in this great steakhouse at the Mirage.

673
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:19.740
Unbelievable fucking stakes.

674
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.580
Unbelievable fucking stakes we had.
And uh,

675
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:28.420
we would like to what was us and there was one other family that was like across

676
00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.273
the restaurant.

677
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.280
We basically closed the place down and we got into such a fucking match about

678
00:41:35.811 --> 00:41:39.740
whether or not Hagler Hearns or whatever could beat Floyd Mayweather.

679
00:41:39.741 --> 00:41:43.250
I remember looking over and there was two waiters at the other side of the

680
00:41:43.251 --> 00:41:44.870
restaurant just laughing at us,

681
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:49.400
but Ivers he was convinced that,
uh,

682
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.320
may,
I don't know.
I gotta be honest with you.
I don't watch it much.

683
00:41:54.321 --> 00:41:57.560
Boxing didn't know.
I mean,
I don't,
I don't see Mayweather knocking anybody out.

684
00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:01.790
Uh,
I dunno.
I always thought Hagler was the best out of all of them,

685
00:42:01.791 --> 00:42:04.040
even though he lost to sugar ray Leonard.
I thought that was bullshit.

686
00:42:04.041 --> 00:42:07.040
I thought he won that fight and uh,
I gotta hand it to him.

687
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:11.450
He fucking lost that fight.
Said this is bullshit.
He left,
he moved to Italy,

688
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:16.460
became an action hero.
Right.
And I never heard of him since.

689
00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.960
I bet his brain is pretty much intact.
So good on him.
You know,
Bart,

690
00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:24.380
nick is convinced that he fucking threw the fight and that's why he immediately

691
00:42:24.381 --> 00:42:27.020
went to Italy afterwards.
It became an action hero story.

692
00:42:27.021 --> 00:42:29.990
So that didn't make any fucking sense.
Um,

693
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.860
I don't know if what he looked visibly upset at the end of the fight.

694
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.950
He's saying like,
this is why you don't fight Vegas and Yada,
Yada,

695
00:42:36.951 --> 00:42:40.970
Yada and all this other fucking bullshit.
So many ways.
Um,
all right.
How far,
oh,

696
00:42:40.971 --> 00:42:45.900
41 minutes in
Jesus Christ.
Uh,
I got a hype,

697
00:42:45.901 --> 00:42:50.330
a couple of things here for this week.
Um,
I got a,

698
00:42:50.331 --> 00:42:53.930
I'm doing a benefit for hungry children,

699
00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:56.390
children who are hungry in Brooklyn.

700
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:59.800
Next week we'll have the link up on my Twitter page,

701
00:42:59.801 --> 00:43:04.801
a at the m m podcast and a Monday and Tuesday I will be out there doing a set,

702
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.530
um,
and uh,

703
00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.740
I guess out in Brooklyn,
so I'll be back in New York with that heat,

704
00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:19.640
humidity and all of that fucking horse shit.
And uh,

705
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:24.740
then I'm immediately flying right back here cause um,
yeah,
I'm on vacation.

706
00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.770
I'm a fucking vacation over year.
I'm also,

707
00:43:28.771 --> 00:43:30.410
I've got to ask some people if you already don't,

708
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:33.680
don't know shit about a fighting it on and I'll type of stuff obviously from the

709
00:43:33.681 --> 00:43:35.150
last five minutes of this podcast.

710
00:43:35.151 --> 00:43:38.570
But I got to ask you my dog sometimes when we're hiking,

711
00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.630
I don't know if it's cause she's hot or what,

712
00:43:41.631 --> 00:43:45.860
but all of a sudden she just wants to eat every piece of grass on the hike and

713
00:43:45.861 --> 00:43:50.550
she eats it until she pukes.
I don't understand what the fuck that is.
Um,

714
00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.490
I bring water,
I offer her water,

715
00:43:52.491 --> 00:43:56.030
she doesn't want it and she keeps eating the grass,

716
00:43:56.031 --> 00:43:57.730
then she puked and then she's to hydrated.

717
00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.180
Then she drinks the shit out of the water.

718
00:43:59.181 --> 00:44:01.910
So basically what I've been doing is I've been,
you know,

719
00:44:01.911 --> 00:44:02.990
cause he's the hotter months,

720
00:44:02.991 --> 00:44:06.900
I just decided I'm going to take a run shorter hikes,
uh,

721
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:09.920
earlier in the morning.
And I noticed,
you know,

722
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:13.760
she wasn't doing a lot of that trying to eat grass shit.
So I can't tell if she,

723
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:17.540
you know,
just as a sensitive stomach,
I don't know what's going on.

724
00:44:17.541 --> 00:44:18.650
So if I figure,

725
00:44:18.651 --> 00:44:23.651
if I gave my 2 cents about a fighting and I don't know shit,

726
00:44:24.201 --> 00:44:27.760
I might as well listen to you fucking,
we can worry.

727
00:44:27.761 --> 00:44:31.320
A dog whisperer is what the fuck you think it is?
I guess I could Google it,

728
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.050
right?
I don't fucking know.

729
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.910
So anyways,
what else the fuck did I want to talk about?

730
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.240
I think that that was it.
All right,
let me do a,

731
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:47.220
let me do my last bit of reeds here on the podcast here for the,
uh,

732
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:49.530
for the advertising for this week before I get into a juice.

733
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:50.940
Remind everybody once again,

734
00:44:50.941 --> 00:44:53.670

739
00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:08.490

Uh,

740
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.430
thanks for sending traffic here.
It doesn't cost you extra money.

741
00:45:11.431 --> 00:45:13.680
It is an extra step if you don't want to do what I get it.

742
00:45:13.681 --> 00:45:16.500
But I'd appreciate it if you would.
Um,
and with that,

743
00:45:16.501 --> 00:45:19.530
here's some more wonderful reads from bill.
Burn the future.

744
00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:25.680
Well,
Hey,
guess what?
There was only one ad read this week.
Um,

745
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.440
so back to the podcast.

746
00:45:28.441 --> 00:45:31.500
You fucking cause he says Christ,

747
00:45:31.501 --> 00:45:36.240
did I butcher those or did I not?
I have no fucking idea.

748
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.640
Um,
last but not least,

749
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:43.080
all of a sudden everybody's getting a drone and I'm calling it right now.

750
00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:45.660
Somebody with a drone is going to kill somebody.

751
00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:49.890
They're going to take down a fucking helicopter or a small fucking plane.

752
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:54.030
I did to have just anybody in the world be able to buy those things and fly them

753
00:45:54.031 --> 00:45:57.330
around.
I cannot fucking believe that that is legal.

754
00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:03.550
Okay.
No flight plan,
no radio contact,

755
00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:07.540
no pilot,
no nothing.
Does drone flying around up there?

756
00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:09.820
Do you know when you ride in a helicopter,

757
00:46:09.821 --> 00:46:11.860
you're not allowed to have anything in your pockets,

758
00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:15.460
especially if the fucking doors are off.
Is anything a cell phone?

759
00:46:15.461 --> 00:46:18.250
Anything goes into that fucking railroader.

760
00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:22.030
You immediately have to put that fucker neutral and auto rotate down to the

761
00:46:22.031 --> 00:46:24.610
ground.
Okay.
Can you imagine

762
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:29.430
what's going to happen?
I'm one of these fucking drones.
I swear to God.

763
00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.200
Where the fuck is the FAA?

764
00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:32.700
<v 0>Okay.</v>

765
00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:33.533
<v 1>On this one,</v>

766
00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:39.300
I really hope they don't allow people to get these things to the level that

767
00:46:39.301 --> 00:46:40.134
they're going to get them.

768
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:45.140
What's funny already as perverts or seeing the advantage of them,
and I've,

769
00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:48.360
I've watched a couple youtube videos and there's women that have accused,

770
00:46:48.361 --> 00:46:52.710
they've taken pictures of these guys that are bringing these cameras up and

771
00:46:52.711 --> 00:46:56.280
they're hovering outside of like a,
you know,

772
00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:01.250
these high rise apartments trying to look into people's,
well,

773
00:47:01.251 --> 00:47:04.630
this is just going to be like,
I swear to God in the future,

774
00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:07.510
I literally think everything is going to be filmed.

775
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:11.080
You're going to have no fucking privacy whatsoever.

776
00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:16.470
You're going to have to stay in your house with the God damn shades drawn.

777
00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.350
And then someone will come up with some technology,

778
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:24.710
some infrared seed through the shades fucking app that people can use for the

779
00:47:26.551 --> 00:47:30.370
love of God.
Get a fucking life.
If you want to get a pile,
you want to fly,

780
00:47:30.371 --> 00:47:33.160
get the balls to get a fucking pilot's license,

781
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:38.610
fucking asshole.
You're going to fly that thing around up there and on almost,

782
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:42.700
you know,
potentially kill somebody while you're safe on the goddamn ground.

783
00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:47.760
I dunno,
ain't right,
man.
Hey,
right.
Bill Burns says it ain't right a little.

784
00:47:47.761 --> 00:47:49.100
We're back.
Um,

785
00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:50.860
<v 0>okay.</v>

786
00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:54.070
<v 1>All right.
He's got it here.

788
00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:03.400

Um,

We had our first live part,

789
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:06.850
uh,
uh,
first live podcast last week where we did an auction and all that.

790
00:48:06.851 --> 00:48:08.470
I want to thank everybody who called in,

791
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:13.660
people who gave me shit and all that type of stuff.
We had a great fucking time.

792
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:15.280
Um,

793
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:17.170
<v 0>yeah</v>

794
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:18.220
<v 1>and uh,
we're definitely going to,</v>

795
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:20.230
we're going to start doing one of those once a month,
bring it on.

796
00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:23.760
Some of the sties are the all things comedy network.
Uh,

797
00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:27.370
we're having a great time.
We're,
I'm this network and it's a slow burn,

798
00:48:27.371 --> 00:48:32.230
but slowly but surely it is building momentum and uh,

799
00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.530
thanks you guys for listening to all the great podcasts that are out there on

800
00:48:35.531 --> 00:48:39.520
the network.
So,
uh,
keep listening.
All right,
and here we go.
Yo,

801
00:48:39.521 --> 00:48:43.930
Yoko ono added again multiple emails from people sending the following link of

802
00:48:43.931 --> 00:48:48.820
Yoko Ono at the Glastonbury festival this summer.
Oh yeah.

803
00:48:48.821 --> 00:48:51.580
I made fun of Yoko in a long time ago.
I gotta be honest.

804
00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:55.450
You'll go on and when the plastic band,
whatever,
plastic ono band or whatever,

805
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:57.400
the band is fucking great.

806
00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:58.860
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

807
00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:01.920
<v 1>And I gotta tell you as far as this video for Yoko Ono,</v>

808
00:49:01.921 --> 00:49:05.790
her singing isn't that bad.
She'd actually be pretty decent at a,
uh,

809
00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:07.590
<v 0>okay.</v>

810
00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:10.240
<v 1>And a fucking Karaoke.
A thing of a g there.</v>

811
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:14.200
I Dunno if you want to seem some more bad Yoko ono or actually good Yoko

812
00:49:14.201 --> 00:49:18.840
warnings.
Oh No.
Singing,
which is sort of just bad singing.
Um,
all right,

813
00:49:18.841 --> 00:49:22.890
let's get to the questions for this week here.
Uh,
summertime blue.

814
00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:27.610
Hey there,
Billy weed whacker.
Uh,

815
00:49:27.611 --> 00:49:31.270
I'm sitting in my cubicle and I'm hating my life.
It's summertime.

816
00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:34.960
My kids are hanging by the pool with my wife and I have friends who have cooler

817
00:49:34.961 --> 00:49:39.550
jobs that allow them more time off to travel and hang out this right.

818
00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:40.780
Well,
first of all,
dude,

819
00:49:40.781 --> 00:49:43.840
the fact that you have a wife and kids at home and you've got a cubicle job,

820
00:49:43.841 --> 00:49:46.890
you're,
you're crushing it.
You know,

821
00:49:46.891 --> 00:49:50.250
I always thought those cubicle job they gave you the little skinny Michael J.

822
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.430
Fox tie and that's all you got.
Um,
anyways,

823
00:49:53.431 --> 00:49:57.270
this Rut has me thinking about the good times I used to have riding my bike,

824
00:49:57.271 --> 00:50:01.050
playing baseball and hanging out with friends all day till it got dark and then

825
00:50:01.051 --> 00:50:03.870
playing some video games once the mosquitoes got too bad.

826
00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:08.910
What are your favorite summertime memories?
What do you miss the most?
Um,

827
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:14.400
what do I miss the most?
Oh yeah.
You know what it is,
is you just,

828
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:19.800
I just,
I just wish there was a way they conveyed to a kid a mortgage,

829
00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:25.690
you know,
being in a relationship,
uh,

830
00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:29.210
property tax,
you know,

831
00:50:29.211 --> 00:50:32.060
nine to five job term papers,

832
00:50:32.061 --> 00:50:35.900
all of this shit that you have to do,

833
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:41.030
counting calories,
all of that fucking crap.
I just wish there was a way that,

834
00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:41.923
you know what I miss.

835
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:47.200
I miss my problems that I had as a kid that I thought were huge.

836
00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.460
That's what I miss.
You know,

837
00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:54.170
as someone was picking on me at school that there was some girl I liked and I

838
00:50:54.171 --> 00:50:57.080
didn't know what to say.
You know,

839
00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:00.560
oh that the Sunday papers are coming and they're going to be really heavy

840
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:05.360
when I go to deliver him.
Those were my problems.
Oh,

841
00:51:05.361 --> 00:51:09.500
it's raining today on my paper route,
dude.
I had,
I had the fucking,

842
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:15.350
I had the best childhood when I really go back and think about it,

843
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:20.540
you know,
I had a paper route so I always from third grade on,
I had a paper.

844
00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:24.880
I always had a fucking job.
So I always had money.
I used to make like,

845
00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:28.550
like 18 bucks a week.
Okay.
When you don't have a car payment,

846
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:31.130
you don't have a mortgage.
We don't have to pay for food.

847
00:51:31.131 --> 00:51:36.131
When you have zero fucking expenses and all your into his fucking candy bars and

848
00:51:38.091 --> 00:51:40.340
football cards,
$18

849
00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:47.270
in a pack of football cards was 35 cents a pack and it came with a piece of gum.

850
00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:53.120
Oh,
it was unbelievable.
We had this,
we used to live in this old house.

851
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:58.610
It was a,
uh,
we lived in the front and these other people lived in the back of,

852
00:51:58.611 --> 00:52:02.510
it was this beautiful.
I mean it was run down,
but I mean,
you could,
you could.

853
00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:05.000
It's the reason why I bought this old house that I have,

854
00:52:05.001 --> 00:52:08.690
I have the appreciation for the woodwork and stuff.
And um,

855
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:12.920
when I always thought was cool was that it had two stairways,

856
00:52:12.921 --> 00:52:16.280
like a lot of old houses have a stairway in the front and the stairway in the

857
00:52:16.281 --> 00:52:18.290
back.
And I always thought that that was cool as shit.

858
00:52:18.291 --> 00:52:22.130
But what they did was they put dividers up in the middle and built another

859
00:52:22.131 --> 00:52:26.030
kitchen in the back and the back stairway was a smaller place.

860
00:52:26.031 --> 00:52:28.220
And then the front,
we have the bigger one because we have a bigger family.

861
00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:29.660
And uh,

862
00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:34.660
this fucking place had unfinished Blair witch basement,

863
00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:40.010
like one of those turn of this century,
last century,
I should say.
Uh,

864
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:45.040
foundations that always had the smell of dampness and all of that shit that was

865
00:52:45.561 --> 00:52:48.350
downstairs.
We had a ping pong table,

866
00:52:48.351 --> 00:52:52.130
which was just an unfinished piece of plywood with a net on it.

867
00:52:52.131 --> 00:52:56.660
And the in the paddles,
right.
A bunch of other shit down there and spiders.

868
00:52:56.661 --> 00:52:59.210
We play that down there.
And you had the Washer and dryer down there,

869
00:52:59.211 --> 00:53:03.560
which we had up on two by fours because every time it fucking rained it flooded

870
00:53:03.561 --> 00:53:07.280
down there.
Um,
and the pump never worked.

871
00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:10.130
Like he had to go down there and put on your big fucking rain boots and turn on

872
00:53:10.131 --> 00:53:12.110
the pump.
And

873
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:16.940
then on the next floor up there was a dining room,

874
00:53:16.941 --> 00:53:19.610
a living room and a kitchen.

875
00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:23.240
And then you went up the stairs and the woodwork,

876
00:53:23.241 --> 00:53:27.090
the banister and all that was fucking incredible.
Like I said,

877
00:53:27.091 --> 00:53:28.410
it needed a little Tlc,

878
00:53:28.411 --> 00:53:32.640
but then you went upstairs and to the right was a bedroom and to the left was

879
00:53:32.641 --> 00:53:35.520
two other bedrooms.
And then there was another bathroom.

880
00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:40.270
And um,
and then yeah,
when you went to the bathroom,

881
00:53:40.271 --> 00:53:44.050
there was another door that led up to a third floor that had two more rooms up

882
00:53:44.051 --> 00:53:47.680
there.
Like,
you didn't have to crouch down.
It was this old fucking house.

883
00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:50.740
But up there,
you know,
we didn't have any AC in that house.

884
00:53:50.741 --> 00:53:53.280
In the second floor was bad enough and you got up on the third floor and you'd

885
00:53:53.281 --> 00:53:56.260
like literally risked fucking heat stroke.

886
00:53:56.890 --> 00:54:00.910
And that was this incredible old house that we rented for the majority of my

887
00:54:00.911 --> 00:54:04.420
childhood and next to it had this giant field.

888
00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:08.930
And um,
we used to go out there all summer.

889
00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:12.920
We played baseball during baseball season.

890
00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:17.050
During the winter we played football.
Uh,

891
00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:20.150
my dad put up a basketball rim and it was funny,

892
00:54:20.151 --> 00:54:23.240
he wasn't a sports guy and he thought on regulation room was nine feet.

893
00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:28.540
So we had a nine foot fucking basketball rim on a slanted fucking driveway.

894
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:36.000
The one that I sucked at that sport.
Uh,
yeah,

895
00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:38.860
we used to ride bikes,

896
00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:42.430
all of that shit before video games or the Internet and all that.

897
00:54:42.431 --> 00:54:46.150
You just went outside climb trees.
We used to climb up this fucking tree.

898
00:54:46.151 --> 00:54:49.450
I lived at like 2015 minutes south of Boston.

899
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:51.030
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

900
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:52.920
<v 1>I don't know what it was.
I don't know.
So we probably like 10,</v>

901
00:54:52.921 --> 00:54:54.860
12 miles outside the city.

902
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:57.540
And we used to climb up a tree that was high enough that we could see the

903
00:54:57.541 --> 00:55:01.470
potential building and the John Hancock building two biggest buildings in,
uh,

904
00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:05.040
in Boston.
You know,
both insurance companies go figure,
right?

905
00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:07.440
They never fucking pay anybody.
Um,

906
00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:12.850
we used to climb all the way up those fucking things.
We will,

907
00:55:12.851 --> 00:55:17.620
we will that will member of this,
this fucking a town pool.

908
00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.020
We'd ride our bikes down there.

909
00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:23.740
We just stayed down at the pool from one to seven every fucking day.

910
00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:27.880
Swimming all day.
Just had no fucking war zone.
You're,

911
00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:32.020
you'll life was a vacation was fucking ridiculous.

912
00:55:32.021 --> 00:55:36.490
And all you had was just bullshit homework.
And I was such a pussy.

913
00:55:36.491 --> 00:55:41.140
I couldn't even get through doing homework.
It might,
life was a fucking joke.

914
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:46.050
My life has never been better was it was never better.

915
00:55:46.051 --> 00:55:48.830
And you just don't even realize it when you didn't have rent yet.

916
00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:50.340
No fucking worries.

917
00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:55.770
Sitting around eating fucking candy bars,
you don't even get fat.

918
00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:59.640
Fucking hilarious.
So that's what I miss.

919
00:55:59.641 --> 00:56:03.300
I miss all of that.
All of that Shit,

920
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:09.810
those fucking,
uh,
elementary school days right into like junior high.

921
00:56:09.811 --> 00:56:11.670
And once you started getting into junior high,

922
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.760
then that's when people really started to break off into cliques.

923
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:18.990
People started their first fucking drinking and drug abuse and then all the

924
00:56:18.991 --> 00:56:21.150
bullshit starts and all that fucking crap.

925
00:56:21.151 --> 00:56:25.930
That's what kind of where it went off the rails for me.
Um,
but um,

926
00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.290
yeah man,
I miss all of that shit.

927
00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:33.140
It's fucking perfect dude.

928
00:56:33.141 --> 00:56:37.340
When you don't have any expenses and you make an $18 a week and your hobby cost

929
00:56:37.341 --> 00:56:41.240
you 35 cents a whack,
I mean it's,
you're the king of the world.
So yeah,

930
00:56:41.241 --> 00:56:44.580
I miss all of that.
I miss all of that shit.
That's what I would say.
Um,

931
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:46.550
let me get it.
The question is,
Jesus Christ.
Oh,

932
00:56:46.551 --> 00:56:50.210
I guess that was a question I got so involved in that.
I forgot it was all right.

933
00:56:50.211 --> 00:56:54.860
My friend is now a woman.
Oh,
JJ too.

934
00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:58.580
He whose hair is red and whose balls or blue?

935
00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:04.040
I am a 25 year old man and one of my close friends from high school who I still

936
00:57:04.041 --> 00:57:08.270
see somewhat regularly,
recently told me that he's,
he is transgender.

937
00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:13.100
You know,
I don't know what that means.
Let me look that up.

938
00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.550
I always get trans transvestite means you just wear women's clothes.

939
00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:21.830
Let me get this right.
Trans Gender.
Here we go.

940
00:57:21.831 --> 00:57:26.831
Transgender according to Wikipedia is the state of one's gender identity.

941
00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:32.660
Self identification as woman,
man,
neither or both.
Or gender expression,

942
00:57:32.661 --> 00:57:36.350
not matching.
One's assigned sex.
Also.

943
00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:41.300
You don't have to get a,
so a transsexual then as if you had the sex change.

944
00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:44.140
You know what this is like.

945
00:57:44.141 --> 00:57:49.130
This is like trying to spell like psycho psychology,
psychosis,

946
00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:55.030
psychosis,
psychotic.
I don't fucking know all those.
P,
Ph,
p,
y,
s,
c,
h,

947
00:57:55.031 --> 00:57:58.330
all his fucking things.
I could never keep them straight.
Um,

948
00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:02.500
identification by other,
by others as male,

949
00:58:02.501 --> 00:58:06.940
female or Intersex based on physical.
Slash.
Genetics.
Sex.

950
00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:11.800
This is already over my head.
Transgender is independent of sexual orientation.

951
00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:16.870
Sexual orientation.
What does that,
what does sexual orientation,
what you're into.

952
00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:18.870
Now I gotta look on this,
right?

953
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:21.410
Sexual orientation is an enduring personal quality,

954
00:58:21.411 --> 00:58:25.570
and then clients you people to feel romantic or sexual attraction to persons of

955
00:58:25.571 --> 00:58:29.350
the opposite,
sex or gender,
the same sex.
All right,
so basically gay,

956
00:58:29.351 --> 00:58:33.580
straight bi.
Okay,
so that mystery,

957
00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:37.360
oh my God,
this is like quicksand.
It just keeps going further.

958
00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:42.610
Transgender is independent of who you want to fuck.

959
00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:45.220
Let's put this in layman's term.

960
00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:50.760
Transgender people may identify as heterosexual,

961
00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:55.180
homosexual,
bisexual,
pansexual.

962
00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:56.960
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

963
00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:01.550
<v 1>Pansexual.
Paulie,
sexual or asexual.
I know what asexual is.</v>

964
00:59:01.551 --> 00:59:04.760
I know a bisexual.
What is pansexual?

965
00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:10.220
Why would you have a globe?
Uh,
pants.
Sexual or sexuality

966
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:14.180
is sexual attraction,
sexual desire,

967
00:59:14.181 --> 00:59:19.181
romantic love or emotional attraction toward people of any sex or gender

968
00:59:19.731 --> 00:59:20.630
identity.

969
00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:21.830
<v 0>Okay.</v>

970
00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:24.800
<v 1>Oh,
so that's not bisexual.
We like you into men and women.</v>

971
00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:30.230
This goes to the next level where you're also went to transsexuals.

972
00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:33.910
Jesus.
You know what?
This,
this seems like,

973
00:59:33.911 --> 00:59:38.840
you know when those word problems in math,
oh my God,
look at this.

974
00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:43.760
You know this fucking,
okay.
Polysexual it looks polysexual.
You know,

975
00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:45.650
you know the male signing the female sign,

976
00:59:45.651 --> 00:59:50.180
the sign for polysexual looks like that sign that prince changed himself to

977
00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:54.530
Paulie.
Sexuality is the attraction to multiple genders.

978
00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:55.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

979
00:59:55.920 --> 01:00:00.660
<v 1>And or sexist,
what do they mean?
Multiple genders?</v>

980
01:00:00.661 --> 01:00:03.300
There's does two genders.
You,
they're a man or a woman,
right?

981
01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:06.310
Or is a transsexual,

982
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.360
<v 0>okay,</v>

983
01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:11.160
<v 1>I'm already lost.
Is that considered a gender?
A polysexual PR.</v>

984
01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:14.380
If you run for office,
do you have to know this shit so you don't fuck this up?

985
01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:21.230
President borough,
how much is this dozen eggs costs?
I don't fucking know.

986
01:00:21.231 --> 01:00:23.330
I got a private chef.
Uh,

987
01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:28.331
polysexual person is one encompassing or characterizing characterized by many

988
01:00:29.391 --> 01:00:31.070
different kinds of sexuality.

989
01:00:31.071 --> 01:00:36.071
Poly Sexuality is sexual identity used by people who recognize that the term

990
01:00:36.111 --> 01:00:39.170
bisexual,
and I can't even read this word.

991
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:46.300
R.
E.
I.
F.
L.
E.

992
01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:51.300
S the gender dichotomy that underlines the distinction between heterosexuality

993
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.340
and homosexuality.
Was that what it is?
I have no,
I don't fucking,

994
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:56.950
I don't even know.
All right,
so

995
01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:01.110
Jesus fucking Christ you.

996
01:01:01.111 --> 01:01:04.090
It's funny the amount of people that could read that and totally get it.
I just,

997
01:01:04.091 --> 01:01:06.250
it just all becomes fucking Mumbo jumbo to me.

998
01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:11.230
All right.
I can't even remember what transgender

999
01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:17.300
did.
Okay.
He actually said this means that even though he's a physically a man,

1000
01:01:17.301 --> 01:01:19.040
he identifies as a woman.
Okay.

1001
01:01:19.310 --> 01:01:22.610
He told me that he isn't thinking about getting surgery or anything major like

1002
01:01:22.611 --> 01:01:27.110
that,
but wants to try living as a woman from now on.
Oh,

1003
01:01:27.111 --> 01:01:29.520
he just became way more difficult to buy four,
didn't he?

1004
01:01:35.310 --> 01:01:35.510
<v 0>Okay,</v>

1005
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:36.920
<v 1>guys are easy to buy now.</v>

1006
01:01:36.921 --> 01:01:41.921
What do you buy the guy who identifies as a woman that has everything,

1007
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:42.680
you know,

1008
01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.680
what do you get them some Chanel scarf that's out of print.

1009
01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.230
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,
he has always been a little peculiar,

1010
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:55.070
so this didn't exactly come out of left field,
but since telling me this,

1011
01:01:55.071 --> 01:01:59.300
he slash she has begun wearing unflattering women's clothing.
That to be blunt,

1012
01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:03.980
look fucking gross.
Well,
I bet.
Did he know how to dress when he was a guy?

1013
01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.560
I mean,
can you give them a little bit of a learning curve?

1014
01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:09.320
How would you put together an outfit?

1015
01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:14.740
I would go with Yoga Pants and flats.
I would just start like,
you know,

1016
01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:18.430
I would dress like a woman online,
very date.
I would ease myself into it,

1017
01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:21.810
you know,
before I tried to pull off anything a little more risky,

1018
01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.660
<v 0>you know,
like</v>

1019
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:28.900
<v 1>what would I change my name to whatever he Wilma,
Wilma clubbing tonight.</v>

1020
01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.970
And then what I do,
you know,
you know,

1021
01:02:31.971 --> 01:02:35.530
I'd have to do some sort of theme like dress like a housewife in the 1950s,

1022
01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:38.620
like Rosie the riveter meets fucking a,

1023
01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:40.120
<v 0>okay.</v>

1024
01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:44.380
<v 1>That chicken was bang and Desi Arnaz um,
Lucy,</v>

1025
01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:46.501
whatever.

1026
01:02:46.501 --> 01:02:51.120
If I don't imagine David Cross prancing around in a skimpy miniskirt anyways,

1027
01:02:51.121 --> 01:02:54.330
I want to be supported.
Oh,
he went,
he went,
oh,
he dove straight in.

1028
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.050
He's dressing like a fucking scag.
Anyways,

1029
01:02:58.051 --> 01:03:01.380
I want to be supportive of my friend in this time in their life and don't want

1030
01:03:01.381 --> 01:03:02.340
to turn my back on them,

1031
01:03:02.341 --> 01:03:05.670
but I don't know how much more I can handle seeing them dress like this and his

1032
01:03:05.671 --> 01:03:10.620
slash her new interest in cutesy girly stuff seems contrived.

1033
01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.430
I've,
I don't think you can really contrive something like that.

1034
01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:17.970
You know,
it takes a lot of fucking balls,

1035
01:03:17.971 --> 01:03:20.400
which I'm sure you can see hanging out of that small skirt

1036
01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:26.100
to walk around.
And that shit he says,

1037
01:03:26.101 --> 01:03:30.930
I've thought about suggesting for him slash her to wear more conservative female

1038
01:03:30.931 --> 01:03:34.380
clothing,
but don't know how to begin to bring up a subject like that.

1039
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:38.830
Uh,
I would just bring a Barbara Bush,
just see where the conversation goes.

1040
01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:41.193
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1041
01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.680
<v 1>Uh,
I dunno what the fuck to tell you here for making suggestion.</v>

1042
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:51.300
Now this is a question.
Do you have to call her her?
I think that's fucking weird.

1043
01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.790
It's like you clearly a dude.
You still have a Dick,
right?

1044
01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:57.930
You know,
and I don't want,
I guess

1045
01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.140
that's the one of those things where you go like,
yeah,
he's,

1046
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:06.500
he's right over there and then suddenly be like,
she,
she's over there.

1047
01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:10.730
People patting themselves on the back.
How politically correct they are.
Oh,

1048
01:04:10.731 --> 01:04:13.700
you mean that hairy leg check with the Dick and balls.

1049
01:04:14.690 --> 01:04:15.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1050
01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:19.890
<v 1>Is that where she is?
Jesus fucking Christ.
Two plus two is five now.</v>

1051
01:04:21.610 --> 01:04:21.950
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1052
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:25.250
<v 1>I'm accepting what,
what the with his Jean Skirt.
Isn't that enough?</v>

1053
01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:29.330
You're going to come at me about pronouns anyways.
Overall,

1054
01:04:29.331 --> 01:04:33.110
this friendship has just proven to be exhausting because I feel like I've lost a

1055
01:04:33.111 --> 01:04:38.111
friend I once had and they've become a new person that I don't get along with.

1056
01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:39.260
Am I an asshole?

1057
01:04:39.261 --> 01:04:44.000
If I stop agreeing to hang out with him slash her and slowly cut them out of my

1058
01:04:44.001 --> 01:04:46.610
life?
What would you do?
In my situation,

1059
01:04:46.611 --> 01:04:50.270
he slash she has always had a strong personality and many other friends,

1060
01:04:50.271 --> 01:04:53.510
so it isn't like I'd be leaving them to be alone,

1061
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:57.410
but am I a bad person if I can't handle being their friend anymore?
Thanks.

1062
01:04:57.411 --> 01:05:01.430
Love the podcast and go fuck yourself.
Now if somebody is being irritating,

1063
01:05:01.431 --> 01:05:05.120
they're fucking irritating.
All right.
You've accepted their choice,

1064
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:11.760
you know?
I Dunno.
If they're annoying the shit out of you,
then yeah,

1065
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:18.070
you seem like you've accepted the fact like you can't go so liberal even though

1066
01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:19.660
they've become a Douche,

1067
01:05:19.661 --> 01:05:23.530
that you're going to completely ignore that because you feel like you're now not

1068
01:05:23.531 --> 01:05:26.260
accepting.
The fact that he now dresses like is she?

1069
01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:29.890
So if you don't have a problem with that,
which you don't seem too,

1070
01:05:29.891 --> 01:05:33.190
but the person is still is annoying,
then you know,
don't,

1071
01:05:33.191 --> 01:05:36.310
you can't just fucking hang out with them because now they're wearing a dress.

1072
01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:38.030
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1073
01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:38.390
<v 1>You know,</v>

1074
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:41.000
treat them like a regular person if they're fucking irritate and you've got to

1075
01:05:41.001 --> 01:05:45.140
cut them out of their life,
out of your life.
That's it.
All right.
Corporations,

1076
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:46.370
Billy CEO,

1077
01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.330
you're always trashing corporations and rightfully so.

1078
01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:55.010
But are there any companies you do,
like if you are a NASCAR driver,

1079
01:05:55.011 --> 01:05:58.430
who would you want to be your sponsor or if he did a commercial,

1080
01:05:58.431 --> 01:06:02.750
what would it be for?
Go Fuck yourself and come back to Baltimore.
Um,

1081
01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:08.670
yeah,
that's a great fucking question.
Um,

1082
01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:10.080
I dunno,

1083
01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:13.770
I guess a beer company cause I like beer and he sort of booze I would be fine

1084
01:06:13.771 --> 01:06:18.120
with.
Other than that,
I would like to try to get somebody,
uh,

1085
01:06:19.650 --> 01:06:23.310
I dunno.
So we didn't makes furniture in this country country or somebody who,
uh,

1086
01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:30.330
I dunno
fucking re does cars or some,

1087
01:06:30.331 --> 01:06:32.250
some that I thought was cool,
but they weren't like,

1088
01:06:32.251 --> 01:06:33.780
I certainly wouldn't want a Walmart.

1089
01:06:33.781 --> 01:06:37.560
Jesus Cleo the fucking dog collar.

1090
01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:41.190
Who would I want?
I Dunno.
I probably be like,

1091
01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.000
<v 0>okay.</v>

1092
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.180
<v 1>Some of the beers,
some of the obscure beer companies that I've,
I've found,</v>

1093
01:06:46.181 --> 01:06:48.840
you know,
like when I was in Australia,
that little creatures beer that I liked.

1094
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:50.710
<v 2>MMM.</v>

1095
01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:55.360
<v 1>I would say some shit like that,
I guess.</v>

1096
01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:02.710
I Dunno the Nhl just ship that I was into,
maybe a drum company,

1097
01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.860
but then I could have wasted time putting that shit on the side of a car.

1098
01:07:05.861 --> 01:07:10.010
Would they?
Oh the fuck would I have.

1099
01:07:10.011 --> 01:07:12.590
That's a great fucking question.
Something unique.

1100
01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:16.620
I don't know.

1101
01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:21.400
I just like to go out there independent and just have a fucking Badass car with

1102
01:07:21.401 --> 01:07:25.240
no sponsor name on it.
Right.
And just to sickest fucking paint job.

1103
01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:29.350
Make all those other guys look fucking stupid.
Right.
Then if you actually win.

1104
01:07:30.310 --> 01:07:31.143
<v 2>Yeah.
No.</v>

1105
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:35.300
<v 1>Shove a fucking,
I don't know what the fuck you'd put on it.</v>

1106
01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:40.040
Some of that shit you see on all those cool car shows.
The gas monkey shit.

1107
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:42.023
<v 2>MMM.</v>

1108
01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:44.520
<v 1>I guess something like that.
Oh God damn it.</v>

1109
01:07:44.521 --> 01:07:47.160
This is like when he's back in the day when you'd still had record stores.

1110
01:07:47.161 --> 01:07:47.994
I mean,

1111
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:51.990
I mean what makes CD stores when it was virgin and all that shit and you was,

1112
01:07:51.991 --> 01:07:53.040
you're walking around during the week.

1113
01:07:53.041 --> 01:07:55.410
I'm going to buy this CD and I buy that CD and my Ba.

1114
01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:57.900
Then you walk in the store and you couldn't fucking remember anything.

1115
01:07:58.410 --> 01:07:59.940
I might have to answer this one next week.

1116
01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.033
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1117
01:08:03.530 --> 01:08:08.150
<v 1>All right.
All right.
Or Enough?
No fucking idea.
All right.
Engagement Ring,</v>

1118
01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:12.390
Dare Bill Matrimony and buying my girlfriend and engagement ring.

1119
01:08:12.391 --> 01:08:14.120
So when I want to get something simple,

1120
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:18.380
I feel like giving something fancy will stress the importance of luxury and

1121
01:08:18.381 --> 01:08:22.610
that's not how I want to start our lives together.
Jesus Christ,

1122
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:25.040
I do well and money is not the issue.

1123
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:29.450
I think that if I tied a string around her finger,
that should be enough.

1124
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:33.470
It's assembled,
not a collector's item.
How do I convey this to her?
Also,

1125
01:08:33.471 --> 01:08:37.730
please don't act like a chicken.
Tell me how and why it's important to her.
Well,

1126
01:08:37.731 --> 01:08:41.660
I mean,
you've basically walled off everything except your opinion.

1127
01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:45.830
You sound very fucking controlling and you sound like a cheap fuck.

1128
01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:51.050
All right?
So go get her a fucking little piece of string and the,

1129
01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:54.350
and conveyed to her the importance of the dollar.

1130
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:57.530
Do that for her.
Everybody loves that.

1131
01:08:57.531 --> 01:09:01.160
You know when you throw in a keg party for someone to come around and go,
hey,

1132
01:09:01.161 --> 01:09:04.040
let's get it cheap beer.
Okay,

1133
01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:06.230
let's only get a quarter keg.

1134
01:09:06.231 --> 01:09:11.000
Everybody get as small sippy cup here on this big day of celebration.

1135
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:14.750
This is the biggest day of her fucking young life.

1136
01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:19.100
The only day bigger than this is going to be when she gives birth to children.

1137
01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:21.393
<v 0>Okay,</v>

1138
01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:25.830
<v 1>so go ahead with your little strength.
Tie it around her fucking finger.
Ah,</v>

1139
01:09:25.831 --> 01:09:27.360
how do you,
how do you say that to her?

1140
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:33.540
Jesus fucking Christ.
How would you like it,

1141
01:09:33.541 --> 01:09:34.374
sir?

1142
01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:38.790
If once you guys got married and you were going down and you wanted to go down

1143
01:09:38.791 --> 01:09:41.820
and you wanted to go buy this new corvette that's coming out the new fucking

1144
01:09:41.821 --> 01:09:43.200
zero six,
whatever it is,

1145
01:09:43.201 --> 01:09:46.530
it's going to go 200 fucking miles an hour and you were in the God damn money.

1146
01:09:46.770 --> 01:09:48.060
And she says no,

1147
01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:52.250
and she stresses to you the importance of that fucking shit.
Oh,

1148
01:09:52.251 --> 01:09:54.710
I guess you're going to say,
well,
it's my money.
I can do what the fuck I want.

1149
01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:56.653
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1150
01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:01.450
<v 1>I don't know how to give an example.
Um,
all I can say is that I,</v>

1151
01:10:01.451 --> 01:10:04.600
I feel bad for this woman cause,
uh,

1152
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.903
<v 0>I dunno.</v>

1153
01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.440
<v 1>I don't know.
I feel like if you're with the right woman,
you want to fucking,</v>

1154
01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:11.520
yeah.

1155
01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.560
<v 0>Buyer.
You know?</v>

1156
01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:17.820
<v 1>I feel like if,
if you fucking</v>

1157
01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:19.460
<v 0>okay,</v>

1158
01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:20.990
<v 1>love your wife.</v>

1159
01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:22.270
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1160
01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:24.340
<v 1>Okay.
And if you have the funds,</v>

1161
01:10:25.530 --> 01:10:28.830
don't you want her to have like a closet full of all the shoe she ever wanted?

1162
01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:29.950
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1163
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:32.980
<v 1>You know,
that's like,
that's like her sports package or whatever.</v>

1164
01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.380
I had going to have all your fucking shoes dress up.

1165
01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:38.410
I know you're under the shit.
I know that makes you happy.

1166
01:10:38.411 --> 01:10:40.390
Why would I want to deny you that?

1167
01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:41.730
<v 0>Okay,</v>

1168
01:10:41.730 --> 01:10:43.920
<v 1>go get all the fucking shoes you want.
You know,</v>

1169
01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:48.990
I don't personally speaking,
I would buy her a a uh,

1170
01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:52.770
<v 0>I dunno.</v>

1171
01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:54.390
<v 1>I would buy,
this is what I would do,
sir.</v>

1172
01:10:54.391 --> 01:10:58.620
I would buy a ring that conveys your feelings towards her rather than your

1173
01:10:58.621 --> 01:11:02.460
feelings towards your wallet and your concern that she's going to be spending

1174
01:11:02.461 --> 01:11:06.030
all of your money.
And if that really is a concern of yours,

1175
01:11:06.370 --> 01:11:07.920
that's a major fucking concern.

1176
01:11:07.921 --> 01:11:10.950
Cause that's one of the number one things that drives people apart is money.

1177
01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:14.010
And if you guys are not on the same page monetarily,

1178
01:11:14.011 --> 01:11:17.210
I would really reconsider what the fuck it is.
You're about rugged though.

1179
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:20.190
All right.
They're all right.
They're a control freak.

1180
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:24.450
Fucking cutting all the goddamned Jesus Christ.

1181
01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:26.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1182
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:30.040
<v 1>All right.
This is my impression of this guy on one of his kids birthdays.</v>

1183
01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:34.540
All right?
They're all in the other room he's in,
he's in the other room.

1184
01:11:34.541 --> 01:11:38.710
Count is fucking money and there and the other ongoing happy.
Yay.

1185
01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:44.680
Hey Caitlin.
Tao.
Don't say too loud.
Don't be too happy.

1186
01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:45.723
I don't want,

1187
01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:50.560
I don't want to set a precedent with that baby's first birthday that,
you know,

1188
01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:55.600
this is the how happened.
We got to be even more happy in the next one.
Give her,

1189
01:11:55.601 --> 01:11:59.500
give us some place to go.
Quit your crying.

1190
01:12:00.970 --> 01:12:05.140
Um,
all right.
And that is the podcast for this week.
Everybody.

1191
01:12:05.141 --> 01:12:10.000
Thank you so much for listening.
I,
uh,
I appreciate it,

1192
01:12:10.001 --> 01:12:12.790
but he's listening and all that type of shit.
Don't take any crap.

1193
01:12:12.791 --> 01:12:17.290
Go fuck yourselves.
I will talk to you next week.
And,

1194
01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:18.124
um,

1195
01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:19.970
<v 0>okay.</v>

1196
01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:22.460
<v 1>I think that's it.
Yeah,
that is it.
All right.
Go Fuck Yourself.</v>
