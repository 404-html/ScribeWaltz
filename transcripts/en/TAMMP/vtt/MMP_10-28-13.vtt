1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.610
Yeah.

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.840
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.800
October 28th,

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.160
2013 three days before Halloween.
Everybody Ah,

5
00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:18.161
the little bastards to come and you know they're all going to come walking up to

6
00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:23.030
the door.
Do you know the lovely Nia has canceled Halloween for this year.

7
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.510
She was so fucking mad after last year we went all out and I got the full size

8
00:00:29.661 --> 00:00:33.350
candy bars.
Right.
Cause I wanted to be that house.

9
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.610
The fucking good shit house door.
You got to go up the hill.

10
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.000
I got the full size once,
you know,
like people would actually say anything.

11
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.000
The good people would,
the future banker kids,
they wouldn't say shit.

12
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.073
You know,

13
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.770
they'd sit there with their little fucking Fisher price pocket watch and say

14
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:59.000
nothing to see here.
And they'd probably try to go back for seconds.
But anyways,

15
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.300
yeah,
I'm behind.
I got to go get up pumpkin.

16
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.840
I gotta make my traditional Pumpkin bread and you can laugh all you want it to

17
00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:07.490
shit.
And if you ever had it,

18
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.760
you'd fucking apologize to me both verbally and in writing.

19
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.860
That's how fucking good my pumpkin bread is.

20
00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:17.660
I'll put it up against any of you fucking ladies and you fucking women out
there.

21
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.540
Huh?
You want to go head to head with my pumpkin bread?
You know what I say?

22
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.540
You know what I say?
I say fucking pregnant
now.
No,
I'm joking.
It's,
it's,

23
00:01:28.541 --> 00:01:29.600
it's pretty fucking good though.

24
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.450
Should be no goddamn vegetable oil in it and be fucking moisture February.

25
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.780
Um,
but anyways,
yeah.
Last year that was just a like a bunch of uh,

26
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.000
like high school kids walking up with barely a costume on.

27
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.570
They have that shit eating grin on their face,
you know,
that fucking age.

28
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:53.960
When kids get into high school and they think they're smarter than adults and

29
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:57.710
they think adults are morons because uh,
you know,

30
00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.350
<v 0>okay,</v>

31
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.183
<v 1>well you know,</v>

32
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.150
we're not listening to their fucking music or whatever the hell it is because

33
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:07.880
they're starting to shave.
They get that fucker look on their face,

34
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.810
which is hilarious.

35
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.130
I don't get mad at it because I did the same thing.

36
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.940
It's really fucking funny when you think about it that you would think that,

37
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.810
I guess because when you look at adults,
we've got wrinkles,
wrinkles on our face.

38
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:26.930
We got the pot belly.
They forget about the experience,

39
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.900
the life experience that we have.

40
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.100
Like we're not fucking trying to do chin ups here.
Sure.
Young man.
Okay.

41
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:38.030
We're talking about a little business transaction here with your dumb fucking

42
00:02:38.031 --> 00:02:40.310
fake mustache on.
I know what the fuck you're doing.

43
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.570
You think I didn't do that at your age?
Your little fucking three whiskered cunt.

44
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.350
Get the fuck off my porch.
I see.
That's what I think we should do.

45
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.250
I think we should still hand out the candy because knee has done,

46
00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:54.980
but the whole fucking thing.
Um,

47
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.590
I don't know if you guys listen to my podcast from last year.

48
00:02:57.591 --> 00:03:01.060
There was some fucking guy,
I don't,
I dunno where,
uh,

49
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.250
what his accent was.

50
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.700
<v 2>Okay.</v>

51
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.380
<v 1>But he wanted some candy with his kids and this guy was like,</v>

52
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.810
like three years younger than me.
And I just was like,
really?
Really?

53
00:03:14.811 --> 00:03:18.170
And he was just like,
yes.
Like really?
He's like,
yes.

54
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.310
I didn't know what to do.
I've fucking choked in the moment.
I gave him candy.

55
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.560
I should have been like,
get the fuck Outta here.

56
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.430
<v 2>Okay,</v>

57
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.480
<v 1>well what is your costume?
Go on as a fucking immigrant.
That's what you are.</v>

58
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.300
That's like me being a redheaded Douche.
Why don't you give me some,

59
00:03:35.301 --> 00:03:39.560
for some of you have fucking baklava whatever.
Fuck you make.
So anyways,

60
00:03:39.561 --> 00:03:41.300
but you know,
I don't want to fuck over the kids.

61
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.040
Kids are adorable and you know,
I,
they're going to get cavities.

62
00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:48.480
I'd like it to come from this house.
They're going to be future,

63
00:03:48.481 --> 00:03:51.980
a little fat fucks.
I'd like to start it right here on my front porch.

64
00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:55.520
So I think she's coming around.
I think she's come around.

65
00:03:55.521 --> 00:03:59.240
We went to the movies last night and we saw a gravity.

66
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.620
We gotta find ourselves a new kind of [inaudible].

67
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:05.783
<v 3>MMM.</v>

68
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.880
<v 1>And that was fucking amazing.</v>

69
00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:13.860
But you know what sucks last fucking like the last five times I've gone to go

70
00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:18.240
see a movie in Imax,
you know,
neo,
he sets it up and I always say,
look,

71
00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:23.240
this is Imax,
right?
This is imax.
Yeah.
See that's the time acts inside me.

72
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.380
There's like imax and then there's imax light where it's the smallest screen.

73
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.650
The only fucking time I've ever gone to a movie and I really saw it in Imax,

74
00:04:31.651 --> 00:04:34.470
is when I saw the Heath Ledger Batman.

75
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.340
And that was one of those deals where I couldn't see the conch head in front of

76
00:04:38.341 --> 00:04:42.420
me and I felt like I was going to fall off the edge of the earth.
All right,

77
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.550
that's Imax.
What I saw last night was not imax.
That was the,

78
00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:51.420
uh,
that was the bud light of imax where it's,

79
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.550
it is a giant screen,
but like to me I,

80
00:04:56.551 --> 00:05:01.020
Emax is all you can see is the screen in front of you.
So fucking annoying.

81
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.460
Those douche bags down there and universal citywalk,
they got like three Imax.

82
00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:08.370
Once they got the real one,
you know,

83
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.430
the Alec Baldwin won and then they got the Billy Baldwin and the fucking Stephen

84
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.020
Baldwin won.
And if you're not careful when you go down there,

85
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:19.140
they fucking pass you off.
You know,

86
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.350
not saying that it's not still a good experience.

87
00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:26.420
Not saying that those aren't two fine actors,
but it's not an Alec patriated.

88
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.870
It's not him.
All right,
so last,
so I was a little disappointed with that,

89
00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:35.190
but other than that,
that was fucking great.
Sandra Bullock killed it and um,

90
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.130
Jesus Christ.
Um,
and I was just,

91
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.030
just the thought of it.
I think I could actually,
uh,

92
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.540
<v 2>okay.</v>

93
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.220
<v 1>I could be at peace floating away from a station in dying that way and solely</v>

94
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:53.640
just having the oxygen go out is lonely,

95
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.130
is that would seem
just the

96
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.970
<v 0>fucking,</v>

97
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.390
<v 1>as long as I wasn't just twirling through the air doing somersaults and there's</v>

98
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:09.640
a,
there's a side and there's this base and this is [inaudible].
I,

99
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.010
I couldn't fucking handle that if I was just sitting there floating,

100
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.580
looking back at earth and just sort of drifting away.

101
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.120
I think that that would be a pretty fucking cool way to die.

102
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.270
<v 0>Okay.</v>

103
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.960
<v 1>What did you just gradually go to sleep?
I don't know.</v>

104
00:06:22.961 --> 00:06:26.020
If you breathe in and only carbon dioxide,
you get like a headache.

105
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.210
I mean that,
that way.
It's such a fucking peaceful way to go.

106
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.970
If you're going to die before your time.
Okay?
Okay.

107
00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:40.540
What do you have fallen off a building fall flat.

108
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.923
<v 0>Right?</v>

109
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.700
<v 1>Fucking fucking wind in your ears.
You're going down.</v>

110
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.900
Make him no fucking whatever noise you'd make on the way down.

111
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:51.770
Fuck that.

112
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:53.390
<v 0>Okay.</v>

113
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.350
<v 1>Getting eaten like I think beyond.
What would you do?</v>

114
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.740
Would you rather get burned to death?
Burned alive.

115
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.760
Oh,
get eaten by a shark.
Amit.
And alive is fucking brutal.

116
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:11.960
Like if I had to get eaten alive,
I'm going with a big cat,
big cat in Africa.

117
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.770
It's fucking over after seeing the lion tamer there.
Um,

118
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.000
which really,
that's,
that's really just a title.

119
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.620
Nobody teams a fucking lion.
You basically,
you had a good day.
You're,

120
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.550
you're on a good run,
but you know what's going to happen eventually.

121
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.310
You know what I mean?

122
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.600
That's like getting an honorary doctorate from a fucking school.

123
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.990
I have an honorary doctorate from Harvard.
Great.
Well,

124
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:40.310
you're not smarter than anybody or you don't even as smart as anybody who went

125
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:44.060
to this school,
you just wrote the mock or Reyna or your fucking head,

126
00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:48.500
your own sitkoff,
you know,
and they knew that all those egg heads,

127
00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:51.590
we're going to be boring as hell when they were giving speeches on graduation

128
00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:52.610
day.
So they brought you in,

129
00:07:52.611 --> 00:07:55.730
you're a fucking clown and they give you a piece of paper.

130
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.700
That's the same thing with lion tamer.

131
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.910
<v 0>All right?
You're</v>

132
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.600
<v 1>not taming them.
Okay?
You're trying to break their spirit,</v>

133
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:06.470
but at the end of the day,

134
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:09.560
they're a fucking lion and they're the king of the beast.
Okay.

135
00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:13.610
Although some would say that the Bengal tiger could kick the shit out of a lion.

136
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:19.100
I don't know about kick the shit out of him,
but uh,
I dunno.
But anyways,

137
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.860
just watching that,
uh,
that Lion Tamer in Vegas,
like when,

138
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.880
when that thing grabbed him by the throat,

139
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.110
that dude went limp and like fucking two seconds.
It was like,

140
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.580
when you watch the UFC,
you know,
when someone gets choked out,

141
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:37.520
you get choked out real fucking quick.
So I don't have,
I wouldn't,

142
00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:41.450
I wouldn't want to get mauled,
like I wouldn't want to get attacked by a bear.

143
00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:43.700
They're very sloppy,
you know what I mean?

144
00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:47.580
They're very like rip your face off and uh,
you know,
eat a little buddy.
Yeah.

145
00:08:47.581 --> 00:08:50.390
And then come back later after they took a nap kind of shit.

146
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.620
I like the Lions Tigers.
They just get right to it.

147
00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:58.650
They grab by your fucking throat in two seconds,
sets it,
you're out.

148
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.130
It dead sober.
And then they,
you know,

149
00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:03.860
<v 3>yeah.</v>

150
00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.730
<v 0>And they have a meal.</v>

151
00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.440
<v 1>I wonder if any of us tastes better than the others.
Like if you ate healthy,</v>

152
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.300
if you're like a,
if you eat like a macrobiotic diet,

153
00:09:19.301 --> 00:09:20.410
if you're like a grass,

154
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.970
like grass fed cattle as opposed to what has sold like me smoking cigars,

155
00:09:24.971 --> 00:09:28.570
drinking booze,
occasionally going to Mcdonald's.
Do I do I taste more like,

156
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.130
you know,
Drake's cakes,
some dried out shit.
I Dunno.

157
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.870
But anyways,
when you look at all those,

158
00:09:34.871 --> 00:09:39.871
and then the worst of all the getting eaten alive other than a fucking Komodo

159
00:09:39.911 --> 00:09:40.630
Dragon,

160
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:45.630
which would basically bite ya and then slowly follow you around for the next

161
00:09:46.121 --> 00:09:49.540
three days is the poison takes over.
You know,

162
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:55.030
as you're laying there and the things like two feet away,
you know,

163
00:09:55.031 --> 00:09:56.020
just staring at you.

164
00:09:56.021 --> 00:10:00.580
It's Lizard Tongue flicking at the side of your face but not eaten yet.
You know,

165
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.860
that's fucking horrific.

166
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:03.733
<v 3>MMM.</v>

167
00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.640
<v 1>Plus,
you know,
wrap wrap towels.
They just don't,
they just don't have any.</v>

168
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.470
<v 3>Okay.</v>

169
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.170
<v 1>There's,
there's no emotion.
The heartless,</v>

170
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.900
they don't give a fuck mammals and even like a lion or something,

171
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.690
they have some sort of understanding what the fuck it is that doing.
Just like,

172
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.050
you know,
reptiles.
I like the terminator.

173
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:27.790
<v 3>Okay.</v>

174
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:31.300
<v 1>Not even terminate.
It could talk.
I don't know what the fuck they are,</v>

175
00:10:31.301 --> 00:10:34.150
but they freak me out.
I don't lie.
I don't like him.
I really don't.

176
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.770
I respect mammals.
I have,
I,
I don't like reptiles there.

177
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.520
I made that statement and I'm sure I'm going to get some backlash on that and

178
00:10:42.521 --> 00:10:46.450
I'm prepared to go on CNN and defend myself when I go on split screen with some

179
00:10:46.451 --> 00:10:49.060
fucking lizard lover.
But anyways,

180
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.210
so if you're floating through space like I could,
I could die like that.

181
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.050
I definitely could,
as long as it wasn't cold,

182
00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.870
as long as that's suit held up and I was just sort of floating,

183
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.210
that would kind of be the most,
uh,

184
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:09.160
that would be the ultimate premature death.
You're going to die in your 30s,

185
00:11:09.161 --> 00:11:13.900
forties or whatever.
God is still at half my life ahead of me or whatever.
Um,

186
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.620
as long as I wasn't Tumblin if I was just sitting there floating,

187
00:11:18.621 --> 00:11:22.880
looking back at the planet for the last 20 years of my life,

188
00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:25.770
and that's pretty fucking awesome.
You know,

189
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.430
me and lance bass up there just hanging out.

190
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.990
I don't fucking know.
I have no idea.
So anyways,
um,

191
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.550
I am a seven days in,
no,
six days in,
no boobs.

192
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:46.590
Shut it down.
I'm getting the glow back.
All right.

193
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.750
I've been Jewson.
Um,

194
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.650
although yesterday was a bad day exercise day for me,

195
00:11:52.651 --> 00:11:56.890
I just sat on the couch all fucking day and gave a fuck,

196
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.060
you know,
just watch sports all day and gave a shit.

197
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.380
It was the worst.

198
00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:08.240
I watched that Patriots Dolphin's game with a right heart right out of I ran out

199
00:12:08.241 --> 00:12:12.410
of the gate.
Uh,
my thanks to the officiating crew,
uh,
that,

200
00:12:12.411 --> 00:12:13.430
that worked at game.

201
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:18.470
I am trying to remember the last time I've watched a game where my team got so

202
00:12:20.571 --> 00:12:23.750
many fucking huge calls to keep the drive going,

203
00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:29.180
that pass interference call on,
uh,
on that defensive back against Gronk.

204
00:12:29.181 --> 00:12:33.740
Koski was criminal criminal,
I believe that gave us,
kept the drive alive.

205
00:12:33.741 --> 00:12:35.120
We've got three points on that one.

206
00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:40.220
And then they had the phantom hands to the face,
flag thrown three,

207
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:44.470
like three,
four seconds after the play ended.
Travesty.

208
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:50.470
And then there was the fumble and they said the dolphin slapped it forward or

209
00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:53.420
what?
I mean,
that's one of those borderline,
was he reaching forward or whatever.

210
00:12:53.421 --> 00:12:56.840
But after those other two fucking,
once we get the benefit of the doubt again,

211
00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.220
Brady got sacked.

212
00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:02.810
He fumbled the ball and the ball went 10 yards back in the other direction.

213
00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.800
We got the ball back and it was first down,
lost 15 yards is still,

214
00:13:06.801 --> 00:13:10.220
somehow it was first down.
And uh,
we were able to come back and beat him.

215
00:13:10.221 --> 00:13:14.170
And I got to say,
um,
the Patriots are,

216
00:13:14.171 --> 00:13:15.770
are overachieving this year.

217
00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:17.893
<v 3>MMM.</v>

218
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.170
<v 1>It's really an unreal,
I can't believe the record that,
what are we six and two?</v>

219
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:27.210
Is that what it is?
We've lost to the jets and we lost to the bangles.
But uh,

220
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:31.380
you know,
I'm,
I'm not like I'm a realist.
I know what's going to happen.

221
00:13:31.381 --> 00:13:34.540
We play the Broncos.
I know what's going to happen if we played the Seahawks.

222
00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:37.530
So if he played the colts or even the 40 niners look,

223
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.430
I know Bella check is a fucking genius and that we can somehow,

224
00:13:41.431 --> 00:13:44.820
I don't know what,
but at this point,
you know,

225
00:13:44.821 --> 00:13:49.821
that was what was driving me fucking nuts yesterday is they start the God damn

226
00:13:50.131 --> 00:13:55.131
game and they talk about how the Patriots have injuries at all three levels on

227
00:13:55.921 --> 00:14:00.270
the defense.
We're,
we're missing our best guy,
Vince Wilfork are defensive line.

228
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.920
Best Guy Plus Kelly,
our best linebacker,
Mayo is out for the season.

229
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.850
Our best corner,
a key to leap.
They're all out.

230
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.170
They're all fucking out.
Hernandez went to fucking jail.

231
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.830
Gronk just got back am and Dole is fucking [inaudible] we got,

232
00:14:16.831 --> 00:14:19.890
we got nothing going on,
you know,

233
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.640
so they address that.
And then the end of the game,

234
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:25.530
I'm watching hall of fame,

235
00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:30.390
fucking players talking about Brady's numbers and how his numbers are down and

236
00:14:30.391 --> 00:14:34.270
go.
This is an atypical,
I mean a top radio with 125 God.

237
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.710
[inaudible] it's like you just fucking said.

238
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.260
How about Tom Brady?

239
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.430
If somehow we're fucking six [inaudible] two with nobody.

240
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.750
Fucking no buddy.
We got nobody.
We got Gronk back,

241
00:14:48.751 --> 00:14:53.390
but we got fucking nobody and was when it Goddamn Games.
And um,

242
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.150
I dunno.
So I am a realist.
So despite the fact that we're six and two,
you know,

243
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.110
I know,
I know.
The Hammer's coming down.
I know it is.
Even if we win the division,

244
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:06.800
all that,
I mean,
I'm not delusional at all.

245
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.010
And then after I'm dealing with that shit,

246
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.900
I actually call up version to talk about these more on fucking analysts and

247
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.090
fuzzy,
I'm going to start,

248
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.760
it's just sprinkling his fairy dust on the New York giants like every fucking

249
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.260
week.
Right?
They all went one all went to,
and he's just going like,
dude,
you know,

250
00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.100
I think we're gonna win next week.
Oh,
in three days,

251
00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:32.460
I think where you went next week.
I went for it,
Eh,
all we'd six.
Right.

252
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.500
And he starts going like,
dude.
Yeah.

253
00:15:34.501 --> 00:15:37.500
And I think we can go on a fucking run here at Blah Blah Blah.
Right.

254
00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:41.950
So now they want two weeks in a row.
Okay.
And I know they're not,

255
00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.050
they're nowhere as near as bad as their fucking record,

256
00:15:44.051 --> 00:15:49.051
but first he fucking yesterday did the classic Paul Versey.

257
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.230
Okay.
I remember in,

258
00:15:53.231 --> 00:15:56.140
in when the Patriots play the giants the first time in the Superbowl,

259
00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:59.020
right before the Superbowl starts.
He goes,
dude,
I'm telling you,
I and I,

260
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.330
I think the giants could surprise some people today.
That's what he said.

261
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:07.380
I think they could surprise some people day.
He wasn't saying they are,

262
00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.560
he wasn't putting any money on it.
He just threw it out there,

263
00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:14.700
which is perfect because if they do,
he gets to be like,
don't what I say.

264
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.090
And then if they didn't,
he goes,
well,
I just said,
you know,

265
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:21.840
I just had a feeling fucking that noncommittal shit.
So now he goes,

266
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:27.210
the AFC,
NFC fucking east is so fucking pathetic this year.

267
00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.710
The giant started Oh and six they're now two and six and there are only two

268
00:16:31.711 --> 00:16:36.600
games out of first.
They could actually win their division.
All right,

269
00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:41.460
which is,
which is classic giants the last like seven years.

270
00:16:41.461 --> 00:16:45.270
It's just like the planets aligned for these guys.
It is their fucking time.

271
00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:48.630
So what is verse he say yesterday?
He goes,
dude,
I'm telling you,
I,

272
00:16:48.631 --> 00:16:52.140
I think they could go on a run.
They get in the plants and then they,
they,
they,

273
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:56.460
they could,
they could win the Superbowl.
Perfect.
Perfect.

274
00:16:56.461 --> 00:16:57.300
Fucking prediction

275
00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.900
didn't say that God didn't put any money down.
He throws it out there.

276
00:17:03.901 --> 00:17:08.250
So I'm guaranteeing you if,
if,
if the giants win the fucking soup bowl,

277
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:11.970
he's going to go,
dude,
I called it because he threw it out there.
I swear to God,

278
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.460
it's listening to that guy predict shit.

279
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:19.320
It's like watching a guy play roulette who just comes up with chips and just

280
00:17:19.321 --> 00:17:23.460
fucking dumps some on a bunch of different numbers.
That fucking,

281
00:17:23.461 --> 00:17:27.210
it drives me insane.
And please send this clip to him.

282
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:31.340
You don't even need to because I'm going to give him shit about it today.
Um,

283
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.420
and I actually liked the giants and that type of thing.

284
00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:35.160
And I think that they could go on a fucking run.

285
00:17:35.161 --> 00:17:38.540
And who knows if they get healthy.
I mean,
who knows.
But I mean,
I don't know.

286
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:39.660
I don't see them.

287
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.353
<v 0>Uh,</v>

288
00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.150
<v 1>I dunno the saints,
the fucking Seahawks is a lot of guys to get through.</v>

289
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.700
You know what mean?
But I mean,
if
the way,
the why,

290
00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.140
the reason why the NFL is great is everybody does have a fucking shot,

291
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:58.580
especially if you play in the fucking NFC east.
But,
um,

292
00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.810
I don't,
I'm going to give him some shit.
I'm going to tell him right now.

293
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.130
I'm going to call it fucker today.
All right?
And I'm going to say,
listen,

294
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.280
I want you to put money on it right now that the giants are going to win the

295
00:18:10.281 --> 00:18:13.610
fucking super bowl.
All right?
And if you don't put money down on it,

296
00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.650
then I don't want to hear a fucking word out of you.
Strive,
you know,

297
00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.410
you know what's a classic Paul Versey pick a Zander.
Bogarts

298
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.250
uh,
I was watching that shit.
You know,
just watching the guy.

299
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.960
I hear it a little hyper bottom.

300
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.110
I read a little bit about them and then I watched like two at bats and I'm

301
00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:36.111
watching this 21 year old kid work in the count in the fucking world series and

302
00:18:36.181 --> 00:18:39.690
a,
I'm like,
this is a verse he pick right here.
He would jump on the bandwagon.

303
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.260
Dan,
I'll tell you,
I think this kid get doe shopped it.

304
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.990
Oh,
is he going to be pissed at me?

305
00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.390
I'm just fucking with you Paul.
But for the love of God,

306
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:55.050
just say some Shit's going to happen.
It puts some fucking money on it.

307
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:59.670
Stop with the fucking,
uh,
I'll tell you,
you know,
I think it could rain this week.

308
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.450
Um,
alright.
Plowing ahead here.

309
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.690
A lot of sports is fucking week as always.

310
00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.600
I feel really bad because I've been neglecting my Bruins.

311
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.480
I know we lost to the devils and I know we beat,

312
00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.990
think we beat San Jose crazy and a last second shot.

313
00:19:15.991 --> 00:19:20.991
I've just been wrapped up watching baseball and uh,

314
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.790
I got to tell you,
dude,
I did not miss it.

315
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:26.580
Watching playoff baseball when your team is in,

316
00:19:26.581 --> 00:19:29.790
it will take fucking 30 years off your life per game.

317
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:31.500
<v 0>Okay.</v>

318
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:35.890
<v 1>And um,
and I know that's not a unique experience.</v>

319
00:19:35.891 --> 00:19:38.950
I know tigers fans have gone through it and I know cardinals fans have gone

320
00:19:38.951 --> 00:19:43.630
through.
It's certainly with us being to two games apiece and,
um,

321
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.540
I gotta tell you it's been exciting,
but I fucking hate baseball.

322
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:53.280
I can't handle watching the shit.
I hate that there's no fucking clock.

323
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.103
It just,

324
00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.690
I hate that you just can't fucking win a game easily.

325
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:05.100
You can't just be up a bunch of fucking runs and everything's good.

326
00:20:05.101 --> 00:20:07.320
You can't just be up four to one and it's all good.
You know,

327
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.890
it's some point between the sixth and the eighth inning.

328
00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:15.590
The other team is some arguer walks the front of the first guy on base and then

329
00:20:15.591 --> 00:20:18.660
it's just going to be this fucking nightmare and then they're going to take the

330
00:20:18.661 --> 00:20:23.430
guy out.
Some other fucking stiff is going to come in and it's just,

331
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:28.140
I have Tourette's when I watch it,
I have to walk away.

332
00:20:28.141 --> 00:20:29.280
I have to go in the other room.

333
00:20:29.281 --> 00:20:33.870
I have to put the thing on mute because I'm convinced Tim McCarver not hates the

334
00:20:33.871 --> 00:20:35.340
red sox and the Yankees.

335
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.670
I learned that he hates the Yankees through Versie and uh,
you know,

336
00:20:38.671 --> 00:20:41.700
he's a former cardinal.
I just think he just fucking,

337
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.840
and I really trying to listen objectively going is this guy criticizing the

338
00:20:45.841 --> 00:20:50.841
cardinals the way he's criticizing it's slash predicting possible bad shit for

339
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:52.810
the red sox.

340
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:58.360
Fucking guy drives me up the Goddamn wall.
Um,

341
00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:00.970
and he,

342
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:05.970
he says positive shit about Ortiz and positive shit about Zander bogarts.

343
00:21:06.041 --> 00:21:09.730
And other than that,
it's just gloom and doom with that guy.

344
00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:11.830
Drives me up the fucking wall,
but,
um,

345
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.320
I have no idea who's going to win this series.
And a,

346
00:21:14.321 --> 00:21:17.830
it's been a great series so far in two of the most bizarre endings to games,

347
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:22.000
games out three and four and that,
uh,
that obstruction thing,

348
00:21:22.001 --> 00:21:24.700
I'm not going to be a bitch and complain about it.
Um,

349
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.850
I don't know what the rule is.
Like most baseball fans,

350
00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.900
the first time I saw the definition of it was that night.
And uh,

351
00:21:31.901 --> 00:21:32.860
I don't fuck it though.

352
00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:37.890
I mean I think it's more positive way of looking at is probably we shouldn't

353
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:42.130
have thrown the ball down the third base slash we probably should have caught

354
00:21:42.131 --> 00:21:44.630
the ball and uh,
I don't,

355
00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.250
I don't know how you call obstruction when you miss the first,

356
00:21:48.251 --> 00:21:51.280
the first half of the collision.
That wouldn't be my only part of it,

357
00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.770
but it seemed like everybody,
including our own managers said they got it right.

358
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.920
So,
uh,
so they got it right.
The fuck you going to do.
Um,

359
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.560
whatever.
It's tied up to anybody's fucking gay man.
I hope we're going to win.

360
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:08.620
Obviously I'm what the Red Sox to win.

361
00:22:08.621 --> 00:22:13.621
But I really want us to win because I can tell how much Versie wants us not to

362
00:22:13.841 --> 00:22:14.674
win.

363
00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:19.740
How much he fucking hates the red sox in their fucking beards and their anti

364
00:22:20.051 --> 00:22:21.970
anti Yankee dress code.

365
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
It's driving him like the level that he gives a fuck makes me laugh because it

366
00:22:27.851 --> 00:22:32.220
reminds me of the ridiculousness of why do I care?
It's like,
look,

367
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.950
especially at first he was like,
what the fuck,
Dude,
you got 27 championships.

368
00:22:35.951 --> 00:22:39.430
If we win this one,
it's our eighth.
What is the problem?

369
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.320
But he for some reason,
fucking hates the Red Sox,

370
00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.440
you know,
for the most part,

371
00:22:47.441 --> 00:22:51.580
other than oh four and the last fucking nine years we've done nothing but

372
00:22:51.581 --> 00:22:53.920
wonderful things for the Yankees.
And you know,

373
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.630
you'd think if Chicago could find it into the,
in their hearts to,
to thank us.

374
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.010
You know,
you'd think that a Yankee fan like virgin could say something nice,

375
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:07.660
you know,
but I don't think he has it in him.
Um,
I'm just fucking with them.

376
00:23:07.661 --> 00:23:10.840
All right,
let's,
let's do a little advertising here for this week.
Uh,

377
00:23:10.841 --> 00:23:14.230
what did we get here?
What do we got?
The Usual,
oh,
this,
this is,

378
00:23:14.231 --> 00:23:16.720
this is the one that's been blowing up and I've been getting nothing but

379
00:23:16.721 --> 00:23:19.300
positive reviews.
Everybody are you a man?

380
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.480
That probably means you got to shave,
right?

381
00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.530
Unless you got that fucking kid disease.
Well,

382
00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:28.690
you never get any whiskers cause your parents smoked too much weed or whatever

383
00:23:28.691 --> 00:23:31.780
the fuck.
However you get that disease.
Is that a technical disease?

384
00:23:31.781 --> 00:23:34.690
I don't know what it is.
Um,
dollar shave club,
everybody,

385
00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:40.030
there's so many things in the world that irritate me.
Um,

386
00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:45.060
people who had no idea what the obstruction rule was and then watched it on ESPN

387
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:49.580
and then start breaking it down like they went to law school.
That irritates me.

388
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:54.080
Uh,
what else irritates me?
I don't fucking know.

389
00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:55.590
<v 2>Okay.</v>

390
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:59.220
<v 1>The fact that I've been eating so well and doing great and then I went to the</v>

391
00:23:59.221 --> 00:24:00.090
movies last night,

392
00:24:00.091 --> 00:24:04.290
got a kit Kat and peanut fucking m and m's like that wasn't enough sugar.

393
00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.120
Daddy irritates me out a bunch of stuff.
Irritates me anyways,

394
00:24:10.121 --> 00:24:14.440
when so many things can irritate you.
Why would you add razors to that list?

433
00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:35.710
Anybody watched fast and loud this week?
I taped a bunch of episodes and a,

434
00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.240
I have a new favorite car.

435
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:42.630
I've always been a Ford guy and I'm the Dude Casey on the show,

436
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.630
the cars,
which I think is so fucking bad ass.

437
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:49.230
I was never really into the bodywork at first.
I was into watching them,
you know,

438
00:26:49.231 --> 00:26:53.740
do the suspensions and dropping motors in,
in that type of thing.
But over the,
uh,

439
00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:54.643
you know,

440
00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.610
years of watching the shit on youtube and watching people redoing cars and
stuff,

441
00:26:59.611 --> 00:27:03.540
I'm really starting to get into the,
you know,
no one had a paint the car just,

442
00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:04.890
and it looked so fucking easy,

443
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.770
but I watched Richard do it one week and he sucked at it.

444
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.680
So I really see that there's an art to it.
But anyways,

445
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.650
that Dude Casey on the show had this,
uh,

446
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:18.300
55 Ford custom line and a,
I think it was what?

447
00:27:18.301 --> 00:27:20.520
Custom line or custom liner?
I'd never heard of it.

448
00:27:20.521 --> 00:27:24.540
I was always sweat in the fucking bell airs thinking that Chevy was doing it

449
00:27:24.541 --> 00:27:27.300
right.
And uh,
let me look this up here.

450
00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.910
Yeah,
a custom line.

451
00:27:30.911 --> 00:27:33.910
And they redid that one and they painted it fucking all white.

452
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.330
They took the chrome off of it.
That car was the shit.

453
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:42.870
And then they ended up selling it to a mark Cuban of the Dallas Mavericks.

454
00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:47.440
And uh,
I swear to God,
if you ever get sick of that car,
I'd buy it.

455
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.860
I buy it off of,
I don't know if I pay what the fuck he paid for it.

456
00:27:50.861 --> 00:27:55.060
I don't have that kind of money,
but Jesus such a bad ass fucking car.

457
00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:59.710
So anyways,
um,
I'm in town after,
you know,

458
00:27:59.711 --> 00:28:03.910
I've been on the road this hope basically this entire year and a,

459
00:28:03.911 --> 00:28:07.060
I got a two week break here and I've been really enjoying myself just hanging

460
00:28:07.061 --> 00:28:10.180
around the house finally.
Um,

461
00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.970
I got back into playing drums a little bit.

462
00:28:12.971 --> 00:28:16.330
I'm doing that Mike Johnston 10 days to faster hands workout.

463
00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.780
I highly recommend it.
I'm six days in as of today,

464
00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.510
I'm finally able to stick with it just because,
you know,

465
00:28:22.511 --> 00:28:25.810
when I travel I kind of barnstorm around where it's like a different city every

466
00:28:25.811 --> 00:28:28.270
night and it's really hard.
You know,

467
00:28:28.271 --> 00:28:31.810
you bring a practice pad and your drum sticks and trying to find a table high

468
00:28:31.811 --> 00:28:33.880
enough,
it's a big pain in the ass.

469
00:28:33.881 --> 00:28:37.030
So I'm making sure that I'm doing it this time.
I'm sticking with it.

470
00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.070
And um,
anyways,
I'm getting back into all my,

471
00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:46.990
all my hobbies.
Uh,
believe it or not this week,

472
00:28:46.991 --> 00:28:49.210
I'm actually going to try to make homemade Ravioli.

473
00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:51.660
<v 2>Okay.</v>

474
00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.500
<v 1>I Dunno.
I'm all over the fucking map.
Nia said that to me the other day.
She goes,</v>

475
00:28:55.501 --> 00:29:00.480
you're all over the map.
You have a d d you can't fault.
You play drums,

476
00:29:00.481 --> 00:29:04.200
you play guitar,
you make Pumpkin bread.
You know,

477
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:08.670
you can fix cars a little bit.
The outskirts basically.

478
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.580
I can't really fix cars.
I can do little bullshit on it.

479
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:14.160
I could have fucked up my seat belt.
I gotta put that in.

480
00:29:14.161 --> 00:29:17.040
That's a couple of bolts can handle that shit.
Whatever.

481
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.820
You ride motorcycles a little bit.
You're all over the fucking map.

482
00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.410
And I was like,
wait a minute.
But I stuck with stand up comedy.

483
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.780
I've been doing that almost 22 years straight.
And she goes,
yeah,
well,
you know.

484
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:30.960
Yeah.
Well you know,
that's the fucking thing I do.

485
00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:33.270
Everything else is the other shit I do.

486
00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:38.400
Is that right?
Cleo liquor over there,

487
00:29:38.401 --> 00:29:42.940
she got a two beds stacked up on each other like a fucking double cheeseburger.

488
00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:47.560
Never seen anything sleep more.
And it's life and that dog,
oh,
by the way,

489
00:29:47.561 --> 00:29:51.820
I'm doing a,
I'm doing a benefit this Sunday,
Sunday,
Sunday,
Sunday,

490
00:29:51.821 --> 00:29:54.910
I'm doing a benefit,
um,
for a,

491
00:29:54.911 --> 00:29:57.640
for pit bulls rescue pit bulls in,

492
00:29:57.641 --> 00:30:00.670
it's going to be down at Largo theater this Sunday.

493
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.470
That would be November,
but blah,
blah,
blah.
Second or third November 3rd,

494
00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.890
I'm going to be down there,
um,
with a bunch of other Comedians,

495
00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.570
a bunch of dog lovers.
Who the hell else is on it?
I can't remember me,

496
00:30:13.571 --> 00:30:16.060
Whitney Cummings,
couple of other people.
And uh,

497
00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:21.130
I did this benefit last year and it's a great cause and what's even it's even

498
00:30:21.131 --> 00:30:25.120
better is they bring a bunch of pit bulls down there and uh,

499
00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:28.420
it's really is my favorite fucking dog.
And she's just the best.

500
00:30:28.421 --> 00:30:33.400
They get the best heads.
They're fucking jacked.
You know,

501
00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:37.060
you should see my dogs,
my dog's legs.
It's ridiculous.

502
00:30:37.061 --> 00:30:40.360
Her back legs when she goes to stretch,
I'm telling,
I've said this before,

503
00:30:40.361 --> 00:30:45.040
you remember that road runner,
um,
episode.
We'll wildly,

504
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:48.550
coyote took that shit to make him run really fast and he's running and he had,

505
00:30:48.551 --> 00:30:51.160
the flames were that he took,
it was like roids for his thighs.

506
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.820
That's what a fucking legs look like.
Um,

507
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:59.800
in every morning she wakes up and I squeezed him like Shannon.
Um,

508
00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:00.611
all right.
Hey,

509
00:31:00.611 --> 00:31:05.611
last week I talked about the Greenpeace 30 and now they got arrested for piracy

510
00:31:05.651 --> 00:31:09.750
and just like,
was there any sort of thought behind,
you know,

511
00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:15.670
but you're boarding a goddamn Russian,
I don't know,
drilling platform me.

512
00:31:15.671 --> 00:31:17.290
What the fuck did you think was gonna Happen?

513
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:21.760
So they got arrested for piracy and I'm going to really follow this.
Uh,

514
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:27.460
um,
I'm really going to follow this story to see what happens.
It's just insane.

515
00:31:27.461 --> 00:31:31.660
Like right now they are,
first of all,
it got dropped down.

516
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.690
Let's see here.
Green Greenpeace,

517
00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:38.130
Arctic Arctic thirties plight highlights the inhumanity of Russian jails.

518
00:31:38.131 --> 00:31:40.390
All right,
that's a different one.
Um,

519
00:31:40.391 --> 00:31:45.391
it's now a month now since the 30 green peace activists arrested for attempting

520
00:31:45.761 --> 00:31:49.810
to board the,
I'm not even gonna try to say it.
Why not?
I'll give you a laugh.

521
00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:51.800
Prior Zam Olana,
Yammer,

522
00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:56.850
fucking oil platform were transferred from police lockups to remand prisons in

523
00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:02.890
Murmansk,
the Merman.
It's region in the Arctic circle.

524
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:05.350
That really scared the shit out of me.

525
00:32:05.351 --> 00:32:07.180
Like I literally thought that they were on just,

526
00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:09.400
they built these jails on the ice,

527
00:32:09.401 --> 00:32:13.560
but it's sort of the one of the most northwest,

528
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:18.520
I think it's the most northwest city in Russia,
basically,
uh,

529
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:23.140
uh,
butts up against like Finland,
Sweden,
Norway,
like the top of those countries.

530
00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:27.550
So they're kind of all the way up there in these goddamned jails.

531
00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:32.590
And um,
where the hell is it here?
They actually were able to,

532
00:32:32.591 --> 00:32:33.424
uh,

533
00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:39.380
they reduced the charges so they're now Russia drops,
piracy charges,

534
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:40.071
cuts,

535
00:32:40.071 --> 00:32:45.071
maximum jail term and half acts of his face up to seven years in prison if

536
00:32:45.411 --> 00:32:49.670
convicted.
Basically they,
they,
I think they knocked it down to a,

537
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.890
I don't know,

538
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:56.660
almost like hooligan behavior says Russia on Wednesday dropped a piracy charges

539
00:32:56.661 --> 00:32:58.850
against 30 people involved in a Greenpeace pro.

540
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:05.930
No,
sorry about that.
The battery's cut out on me.
I'm speaking of green peace.

541
00:33:05.931 --> 00:33:08.840
So it was trying to make sure I used up all my other batteries before I fucking

542
00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:12.980
throw him out cause I don't know where the fuck to recycle them.
Um,

543
00:33:12.981 --> 00:33:17.540
where the hell was I?
Um,
I'll just start it over again.

544
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:22.280
They dropped a piracy charges but Blahblahblahblahblah they face up to seven

545
00:33:22.281 --> 00:33:24.860
years down from 15 years.

546
00:33:24.861 --> 00:33:29.620
The charges against the activists who protested the platform,
um,

547
00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:32.960
the last months have been changed from piracy to hooliganism.

548
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:35.840
The Federal Investigative Committee said,

549
00:33:35.841 --> 00:33:38.450
and there's a whole green peace thing if you guys want to get involved and try

550
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:42.080
to help to get these knuckleheads out of jail.
Uh,

551
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:47.900
I dunno,
like protesting,
this is a really sad truth.

552
00:33:47.901 --> 00:33:50.960
Protesting is difficult enough in your own country,

553
00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:55.640
even if you have a democracy,
because you know the cops are gonna show up,

554
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.480
you know what the deal is.
And as much as you tell everybody,

555
00:33:59.481 --> 00:34:02.450
just remain peaceful and then they won't club is down.

556
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:07.630
Somebody eventually ends up throwing a rock or doing something or some

557
00:34:08.091 --> 00:34:09.710
conspiracy theorists say that,

558
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.760
that the government hires somebody to go in with the protesters and throw

559
00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:18.290
something.
So then the cops can then beat him down and tear gas.

560
00:34:18.291 --> 00:34:22.190
And I don't know if that's fucking true,
but I'd love to think it is.
Um,

561
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:25.360
it's hard enough to fucking do it in your own country.

562
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:30.320
I got to give it up the fucking balls.
Those people had to try and do that.
Um,

563
00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:32.720
and just the situation that they're in,

564
00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:36.320
it reminds me of that documentary I saw on that.
Yeah.
The Ganja Queen.

565
00:34:36.321 --> 00:34:41.321
Did you guys ever see that was basically this lady that went to a Bali and I'm,

566
00:34:44.121 --> 00:34:48.490
according to her,
she loaded a boogie board with a Boogie,
you know,

567
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:53.710
she checked that and that was you're carrying on.
And then when she got off the,

568
00:34:53.711 --> 00:34:54.740
uh,
the plane,

569
00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:00.290
the Bali state fucking troopers came over and said,
hey,

570
00:35:00.291 --> 00:35:05.150
is that your boogie board?
Fucking Satchel?
And she goes,
yeah,
it is.

571
00:35:05.151 --> 00:35:07.260
And then they opened it up and there was all this Wieden,

572
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:12.280
there was all these wee man and they don't in Indonesia,

573
00:35:12.801 --> 00:35:16.490
they don't fuck around.
When it comes to a drugs,

574
00:35:16.491 --> 00:35:19.130
they have a zero tolerance,
zero tolerance for it.

575
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:21.260
And if you get busted with the shit,

576
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:25.790
I think they put you to death is what they usually do.
And they say that,

577
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:28.610
I just did Tom Rhodes podcast and we will,

578
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:33.670
we kind of a towards started to talk about this and they basically,

579
00:35:34.731 --> 00:35:38.760
uh,
he's,
he's been to Bali.
And I was like,
dude,
don't you get scared?

580
00:35:38.761 --> 00:35:39.840
And you just sort of laughed.
He goes,
no,

581
00:35:39.841 --> 00:35:41.910
I just don't bring any drugs into the country.

582
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.050
And I'm just kind of like,
well,

583
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:51.510
what if just something happens?
What if somebody next to you has,
I'm a,

584
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:55.410
just shoves him in your pocket.
I know that's written a ridiculous fear,
but like,

585
00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:00.370
you know what I mean?
Look,
I'll go to another country and I,

586
00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:04.650
and the countries that if you kill somebody,
it's punishable by death.

587
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:10.080
And I can,
I can live within that because I just can be like,
well,
you know,

588
00:36:10.081 --> 00:36:14.130
I'm not going to kill anybody.
I think it's because over here,

589
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:16.830
if you get busted with weed and a lot of states,

590
00:36:16.831 --> 00:36:20.640
now it's legal and then,
um,

591
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.850
they didn't,
if you get busted,
it's like no big deal.

592
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:26.670
Unless of course you have a bunch of it and you get,

593
00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:29.700
you get busted for trafficking,
that's a whole other deal.
But I mean,

594
00:36:29.701 --> 00:36:33.870
it's not like somebody can just drop a bunch of kilos of weed on you,

595
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.840
plant that on,
you,
stick them in your fucking backpack,

596
00:36:36.841 --> 00:36:37.860
you're going to know they're there.

597
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:42.720
But just the fact that you have one God damn join on you.

598
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.670
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

599
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:46.920
<v 1>Like dude,
I would walk into that country</v>

600
00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:52.540
naked.
I come in with a fucking speedo.

601
00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:57.190
I get a colonic the week before I would juice for a fucking month.

602
00:36:58.210 --> 00:36:58.760
<v 0>Okay.</v>

603
00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.940
<v 1>And,
uh,</v>

604
00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:04.390
I would have a cattle prod and keep all other passengers away from me and I

605
00:37:04.391 --> 00:37:07.090
would walk into,
they're wearing a goddamn thong.

606
00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:09.580
And that's the only way I even then I would be scared.

607
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:11.520
<v 0>Okay.</v>

608
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:16.170
<v 1>Punishable by fucking death.
Jesus Christ.
So anyways,
if you,</v>

609
00:37:16.171 --> 00:37:20.890
if you,
if you want to watch something really disturbing,
um,

610
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.560
watch this gun.

611
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.980
Ganja Queen was what she was called in the papers over there and they opened up

612
00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.670
or Boogie board a Satchel or whatever the fuck you call it,

613
00:37:29.671 --> 00:37:33.000
carry on case and there was a bunch of weed in there and uh,

614
00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.900
she,
they,
they were like,

615
00:37:36.901 --> 00:37:39.810
we're going to put you to death in the Australian,

616
00:37:39.811 --> 00:37:42.090
whatever the fucking syndicate,
whatever you call it.

617
00:37:42.091 --> 00:37:46.410
The embassy tried to get this woman out of it and uh,

618
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:50.820
just watched that documentary,
this,
this,
I mean obviously the Greenpeace 30,

619
00:37:50.821 --> 00:37:52.560
then I got to get put to death,

620
00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:57.561
but I'm sitting here scrolling across the maps here looking at this shit where

621
00:37:57.901 --> 00:38:02.370
Bali is over an inch and there's Murmansk.
There it is right there.
Jesus Christ.

622
00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:06.120
I just fuck that.
How the fuck is anybody going to help you?

623
00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:09.883
Oh my God.

624
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:13.760
That's why I always do that Amnesty International because that is a fucking fear

625
00:38:13.761 --> 00:38:17.890
of mine just being thrown in a Goddamn jail.
Do you ever watch,

626
00:38:17.891 --> 00:38:20.480
you remember that show arrested abroad?
Did you ever see that thing?

627
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:23.330
I watched that with Neil one time and Neil loves traveling.

628
00:38:23.331 --> 00:38:28.331
She goes that that made me never want to fucking go anywhere again in my life.

629
00:38:29.931 --> 00:38:31.250
But it's just,
what was one of those things?

630
00:38:31.251 --> 00:38:36.251
It was always like these fucking people were trying to smuggle drugs out of the

631
00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:39.820
country.
I mean,
I'm trying to think of something that takes more balls than that.

632
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:41.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

633
00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:45.510
<v 1>I'm sure that you guys can come up with something,
but you know,</v>

634
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:48.420
just being in a country where if you get caught,

635
00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.880
you're going to go into their God damn.
Okay.

636
00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:52.613
<v 0>Okay.</v>

637
00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:56.450
<v 1>Gulag.
And you're not going to be able to speak the language.</v>

638
00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.260
You talk about a man without a fucking country and you're going to have to go in

639
00:39:00.261 --> 00:39:04.000
there.
I mean,
John Club van Damme is,

640
00:39:04.001 --> 00:39:08.740
he's gaze at the height of his powers is getting fucking ass rate in that

641
00:39:08.741 --> 00:39:11.320
situation.
That's just,
you're done.
You're fucking finished.

642
00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:17.430
Jesus Christ.
I mean,
I get not walking in a cubicle.

643
00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:20.770
They wanted to make you fucking money.
But I,
there's a,

644
00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:23.460
there's gotta be some other talent that God gave you will,

645
00:39:23.461 --> 00:39:24.890
you can make money that doesn't evolve.

646
00:39:24.891 --> 00:39:28.350
Shoving a Kia coke up your fucking ass trying to get out of Columbia.

647
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.810
There's gotta be another way to do it.
Right,
right.

648
00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:36.510
And you're fucking moped to the airport on unpaved roads.

649
00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.000
This distressed after there has to be a better way.

650
00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:44.560
It's gotta be a better way to do it.
Um,
anyways,

651
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.710
let's fucking move on here.
Let's,
let's,

652
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.220
are we far enough into the podcast here and now that the thing cut out?

653
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.600
I've got to do the math here and was at 35.
Uh,
Jesus,
I don't fucking know.
Let's,

654
00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:57.050
uh,
let's read a,
um,

655
00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:58.920
<v 0>okay.</v>

656
00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:02.970
<v 1>I think I went through everything that I wanted to talk about,
didn't I?
Oh yeah.</v>

657
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:03.990
I'm a little out of it here.

658
00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:07.130
I haven't eaten yet today because last night I ate late,
late at night,

659
00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:11.100
ate it like a,
like one in the morning,
I think is when I finally stopped eating.

660
00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.280
Um,
came home,

661
00:40:14.281 --> 00:40:18.180
I had one of those fucking name Antipasto plates and,
uh,

662
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.320
like fucking one in the morning.

663
00:40:19.321 --> 00:40:23.670
And I adhere by that rule that you go 12 hours after your last meal.

664
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:26.610
Like if eda o'clock at night,
eat the next day,
eight in the morning.

665
00:40:26.611 --> 00:40:27.720
I stayed up till one in the morning,

666
00:40:27.721 --> 00:40:30.060
so I'm not eating until one in the afternoon.
All right?

667
00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:33.540
That's how you become a top of shit,
right?
You go to bed at one,
you wake up,

668
00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:36.270
it's seven 30 in the morning.
You have to go to work and then eat a bacon,

669
00:40:36.271 --> 00:40:40.950
egg and cheese or a fucking doughnut.
And so it's fucking over.
So,
uh,

670
00:40:40.951 --> 00:40:44.430
that's it.
I tell you,
I got down to like fucking a buck 70.

671
00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:50.150
I told you I was going to get into a
sitting down.

672
00:40:50.151 --> 00:40:53.330
No showed on shape.
That's what I want to get back to.

673
00:40:53.331 --> 00:40:58.130
Just one more fucking time in my life.
You know,
they always making these movies,

674
00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.340
you know,
they're gonna do it one more time.

675
00:41:01.341 --> 00:41:06.200
They got one coming out that I'm going to go see that.
That one with Deniro,
uh,

676
00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:11.120
Michael Douglas and fucking,
uh,
Morgan Freeman.

677
00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:15.350
Alan Arkin.
Oh,
I think he's in that too.
I don't know if they're all in that,

678
00:41:15.351 --> 00:41:18.080
but like,
I'm going to go see,
you know,
they're doing it one more time.
Right.

679
00:41:18.081 --> 00:41:21.080
That's what the fuck I'm doing with my stomach.
And it's,

680
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:24.350
I'm having a hell of a time because if you just stop eating,

681
00:41:24.351 --> 00:41:26.680
you end up losing muscle.
All of a sudden it looked down at my right,

682
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:30.200
the arms of a seventh grader,
and I still had my little fucking beer belly,

683
00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:35.630
you know,
looking like a God damn turtle.
Right?
So I got to do something.
I gotta,

684
00:41:35.631 --> 00:41:38.330
I gotta fucking eat more meat and fucking do a mark.

685
00:41:38.331 --> 00:41:40.790
I don't know what I got to do.
Probably have to get a personal trainer.

686
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.160
I don't want to do that.
If somebody holding my ankles and I'm doing sit ups,

687
00:41:46.161 --> 00:41:47.330
I can't fucking do that shit.

688
00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:52.710
Oh,
speaking of Michael Douglas,
you know,

689
00:41:52.711 --> 00:41:56.160
I finally sat down and I watch behind the candelabra,

690
00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:01.320
you know,
I am.
Um,
I,
I'm too homophobic.

691
00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:05.730
I was too homophobic to watch it.
And,
uh,
you know,

692
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:09.060
this is the thing about being home,
being homophobic.

693
00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:13.590
There's all different levels of it.
Like that word,
oh,
he's homophobic.

694
00:42:13.591 --> 00:42:14.341
And then he'd get it.
Like,

695
00:42:14.341 --> 00:42:17.910
you think gays are going to hell and they shouldn't be married and what they're

696
00:42:17.911 --> 00:42:21.960
doing is unnatural.
And I'm not homophobic like that.
Uh,

697
00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:26.220
I think,
you know,
being gay is just how you're naturally wired,

698
00:42:26.221 --> 00:42:30.480
so it's completely natural and go out and fucking have at it,

699
00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:36.060
you know,
fuck as many as you can.
Don't you think?

700
00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:41.370
Don't give a fuck,
get married,
have a hell of a fucking time,

701
00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:46.990
you know,
God bless you.
But,
uh,
I,
I get like a,

702
00:42:46.991 --> 00:42:51.160
I don't know what it is in movies when there's guys kissing each other and

703
00:42:51.161 --> 00:42:54.640
caressing each other.
I egg makes me fucking uncomfortable.

704
00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:58.810
And then there was something about watching Michael Douglas and Matt Damon

705
00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:01.940
playing footsie with each other.
Like that fucking,

706
00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.430
I didn't want to see him in a hot tub together.
I,

707
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:09.990
I couldn't fucking watch it,
comfortable talking about it,

708
00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:14.160
but whatever,
I'm being honest.
So anyways,
that was on the road or something.

709
00:43:14.161 --> 00:43:15.330
I don't know where the fuck I was at.

710
00:43:15.331 --> 00:43:20.331
I was back in Boston and it came on and I watched the second half of it and I

711
00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:25.130
gotta tell you something that was,
it was absolutely fucking phenomenal.

712
00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.560
Was fucking hilarious.

713
00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:30.680
I'm going to have neon here at some point and do her Michael Douglas impression

714
00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:36.380
going Scad,
Scad.
I can't,

715
00:43:36.381 --> 00:43:40.340
I can't do it as well as she can.
Um,
they will.
They work.

716
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:44.870
Michael Douglas and Matt Damon killed it and that fucking movie.
And uh,

717
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:50.180
and I was actually rooting for Matt Damon's character.
I felt bad for him.

718
00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:54.500
It's like,
dude,
you got to get out of this relationship.
You fucking up your face.

719
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:57.920
You got to get off the drugs.
You know,

720
00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.600
he's bringing in some younger guy,
unique.
The writing's on the wall.

721
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:05.130
You gotta get Outta here,
man.
Go take some night classes,
you know,

722
00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:08.490
do something else to fuck he doing with this old man.

723
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:13.760
Lose sparkly fucking coach and his damn to pay kick G.
Okay.

724
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.130
You know what I mean?
He's using Yah,
I got into it like that.

725
00:44:17.131 --> 00:44:19.270
That's how well it was done.
Um,

726
00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:22.650
highly recommend that two thumbs up behind the candelabra.
Oh,

727
00:44:22.651 --> 00:44:27.650
fucking homophobe Billy.
He liked it.
I'm not 100% homophobe.
Well,

728
00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:30.060
20% homophobe

729
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.030
is that a standard offensive to say?
Homophobe am I suppose to say homophobic?

730
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.000
There's something about abbreviating shit that makes people annoyed.

731
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:44.130
Like you're not supposed to say trainee anymore.
And you know what's funny?

732
00:44:44.131 --> 00:44:47.640
I don't even know if that's short for transvestite or transsexual.

733
00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:51.330
I don't understand why that's bad.

734
00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:52.740
<v 2>Okay.</v>

735
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.320
<v 1>That's like if you name's Mike and some of the gay Mikey</v>

736
00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:00.330
is that bad?
You know,
that's really offensive.
My name is Michael.

737
00:45:00.331 --> 00:45:03.790
Thank you very much.
Transvestite.

738
00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:11.160
What do you say,
Dick and address.
Why are you doing there buddy?
Sweet at,

739
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.000
you know,
you can't fucking say that evidently.

740
00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:17.110
Even despite if in your heart you don't think there's anything wrong,

741
00:45:17.111 --> 00:45:20.140
I don't give a fuck if that's what you want to do.
God bless you.
You know,

742
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:23.090
God bless you.
Put on some fucking heels,

743
00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:26.800
walked down the street and let people know what you're doing.
Um,

744
00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:31.510
I don't give a shit.
I really don't.
I really don't.

745
00:45:31.511 --> 00:45:33.880
Just fucking don't play your music too loud.

746
00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:39.340
Don't trick or treat past a certain age.
And uh,

747
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:42.250
I don't know what else if you're drunk,

748
00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.710
I don't mind if you talk to me when you're drunk.
Just,
you know,

749
00:45:44.711 --> 00:45:47.530
keep your distance.
Does anything worse than what somebody said.

750
00:45:47.531 --> 00:45:48.850
I had somebody over the weekend,

751
00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:53.320
I was down at the comedy store and just somebody was fucking wasted and they

752
00:45:53.321 --> 00:45:56.500
just,
you know,
somebody is wasted due and they just come up to you.

753
00:45:56.890 --> 00:46:01.300
You're in the middle of a conversation,
is it,
can bard,

754
00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:05.780
they become like,
you know,
like toddlers don't give a fuck.
They,

755
00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:07.930
they have no concept of two people talking.

756
00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:11.530
They'll just barge in on the conversation and they'll,
they'll just,

757
00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:13.000
I just think he used to do a bit on this.

758
00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:16.400
I don't even know if I ever put it on a special ice to talk about how they look

759
00:46:16.401 --> 00:46:19.690
like they were like drunks and they would just start in the middle of the

760
00:46:19.691 --> 00:46:23.800
conversation,
middle of a story,
let you try and figure it out.
Um,

761
00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.910
I don't even want to talk to him about let,
let's,
let's,
let's read it.

762
00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:32.230
Let's read some of this shit here.
Um,
all right.
Is 29 two old.

763
00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:36.910
Hey,
they Billy bandwagon.
For those of you who don't follow me on Twitter,
I uh,

764
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:41.560
been going by bill bandwagon watching the red sox and uh,

765
00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:42.760
I got to tell you right now,

766
00:46:42.761 --> 00:46:47.110
I am not built bandwagon anymore after fucking aging 30 years watching all of

767
00:46:47.111 --> 00:46:51.070
these goddamn games,
I am back to die hard.
I'm not die hard.
Maybe I am.

768
00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.580
Maybe I'll,
maybe I'll come back to watching a baseball.

769
00:46:54.581 --> 00:46:56.830
We'll see the jury is out,
but uh,

770
00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:02.470
Bill Bandwagon left after we lost two games in a row and there was the

771
00:47:02.471 --> 00:47:06.820
obstruction call he took off and die hard bill fucking hung around.
All right.

772
00:47:06.821 --> 00:47:08.320
Anyways,
first he says,

773
00:47:08.321 --> 00:47:10.400
I just want to say love the podcast and your comedy special,

774
00:47:10.401 --> 00:47:12.880
so thank you very much.
Uh,
he goes,
my question,

775
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:18.220
do you think 29 is too old to start doing standup?

776
00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:19.300
Um,

777
00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:24.300
I have a decent fulltime job as a paralegal and consider myself lucky to be

778
00:47:24.371 --> 00:47:29.020
gainfully employed.
However,
life in an office is miserable and it gets worse.

779
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.320
The years pylon.
I'm not quitting anytime soon.

780
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:37.300
But if thought about starting to try open mikes to see if I'm any good and

781
00:47:37.301 --> 00:47:38.170
maybe,

782
00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:43.780
and maybe what maybe helped me be a little more outgoing,
what do you think?

783
00:47:43.781 --> 00:47:47.560
Is it still possible when you damn near third 30.
Thanks.

784
00:47:47.561 --> 00:47:48.640
And Go fuck yourself dude.

785
00:47:48.641 --> 00:47:52.690
Apps of fucking lutely absolutely.

786
00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:57.660
And this is the thing.
Yeah,
don't quit your day job.
That's what I did.
I,

787
00:47:57.661 --> 00:48:02.140
I had a day job and I was like,
let me try this stand up thing.

788
00:48:02.141 --> 00:48:06.880
And I started doing it and I immediately loved it and I just kept working on it

789
00:48:06.881 --> 00:48:11.280
and working on it,
working on it.
But I didn't leave my day job until,

790
00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:14.380
um,
I actually kept my day job when I could have left it.

791
00:48:14.381 --> 00:48:16.300
I was making enough money where I could live,

792
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:21.040
but I kept my day job because I knew I was moving down in New York and I wanted

793
00:48:21.041 --> 00:48:24.940
to save up some money so I could,
um,

794
00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:27.880
because I knew that I,
you know,

795
00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:30.190
I wasn't going to show up in New York and they all great.

796
00:48:30.191 --> 00:48:32.830
This fucking guy we don't know is here.
Let's give him a bunch of stage time.

797
00:48:32.831 --> 00:48:34.510
I knew I was going to have to struggle,

798
00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:38.260
so I would absolutely 100%.

799
00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:41.580
If you're thinking about trying it,
definitely try.

800
00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:46.480
Even if you just do it one time you did it.
You did it.
I went skydiving one time.

801
00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:50.110
I have to tell you guys that story.
I went skydiving one time.

802
00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:55.180
If I did a static line jump in Pepperell Massachusetts back in the day and uh,

803
00:48:57.150 --> 00:49:01.770
I almost had a problem.
They said,
sit in the door.
It sit in the door,

804
00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:06.060
get out,
go.
So you sit in the door,
they opened the door to the plane,

805
00:49:06.061 --> 00:49:09.900
you sit in the door.
And then when I say get out,
you put your feet,

806
00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:12.540
you put one foot,
your left foot on,

807
00:49:12.541 --> 00:49:16.110
this almost looks like an engine mount that's above one of the wheels of this

808
00:49:16.111 --> 00:49:16.950
fucking plane.

809
00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:18.540
<v 0>Okay.</v>

810
00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:23.540
<v 1>And then you're hanging on to the support for the wing that is above the fucking</v>

811
00:49:23.671 --> 00:49:26.310
plane.
You're basically like a God damn wing Walker.

812
00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:31.410
And then I'd be basically,
if you'll,
if you leaned up against the bar,

813
00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:36.120
If you put your body in a 45 degree angle and you leaned up against the bar in

814
00:49:36.121 --> 00:49:40.350
the upright push up position and then you went down like you were coming down to

815
00:49:40.351 --> 00:49:43.740
the floor,
that's basically the position you're in.
Like you're down to the floor,

816
00:49:43.741 --> 00:49:47.850
except it's the support to the wing.
And then you have one foot on the engine,

817
00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.170
what it looks like an engine mount,

818
00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:52.530
and then you have another foot pointed straight out behind you.

819
00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:56.430
Because what you're going to do,
it says skin,
you know,
sit in the door,

820
00:49:56.431 --> 00:49:58.770
get out and go.
When he slaps your shoulder,

821
00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:03.060
you let go of the fuck plane,

822
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:05.100
which makes no fucking sense.

823
00:50:05.850 --> 00:50:09.000
And then you bring that other leg up parallel to where your other one was

824
00:50:09.001 --> 00:50:12.000
setting out and then you arc.
All right.

825
00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:15.300
And what I did was a static line jumps so I don't have to pull the shoot,

826
00:50:15.301 --> 00:50:19.410
but I don't have anybody with me to static line jump.
And as you let go,

827
00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:24.560
it pulls your shoot and you and you go arc 1002 1003 1000 look,

828
00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.850
if nothing look reached,
pull.

829
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:30.080
I still remember that shit like it was yesterday.

830
00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:31.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

831
00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:34.290
<v 1>Two,
1003 1000 and it's look,</v>

832
00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:39.320
you turn to see your parachute to see if it's opened,

833
00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.120
if it's open property properly,
what it look,
if nothing,
look,

834
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:46.190
you look down to where your reserve is.
Cause if he,

835
00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:49.670
if he don't look where it is for some reason you might not be able to grab it.

836
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.670
So look,
if nothing,
look,
reach,
pull.

837
00:50:52.671 --> 00:50:55.310
And then you pull your reserve chute and hopefully that thing fucking opens.

838
00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.530
Are you going to bounce?
So

839
00:50:58.530 --> 00:50:59.150
<v 0>okay,</v>

840
00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:01.780
<v 1>he said he was going to sit in the door and I was like,
what?</v>

841
00:51:01.781 --> 00:51:04.270
He's going sit in the door.
I thought he said,
close the door.

842
00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:07.390
He's going to sit in then I file.
Okay,
so sit there though.

843
00:51:07.391 --> 00:51:11.350
So I sit in the door and then he goes,
get out.

844
00:51:11.351 --> 00:51:16.150
I got out and then he said go.
And when I let go,
I didn't arc.

845
00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:21.610
I tried to grab for something and I started doing front flips as my shoot was

846
00:51:21.611 --> 00:51:26.611
coming out and I felt it going by the inside of my right leg.

847
00:51:26.741 --> 00:51:31.690
I felt this something touch my right thigh and I was going,
Oh my God,

848
00:51:31.691 --> 00:51:36.040
I'm going to pee.
I'm going to get wound up in this fucking thing.
And uh,

849
00:51:36.041 --> 00:51:39.010
I don't know who packed that shoot,
but thank God it fucking came out.

850
00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:43.180
And then you had like a little transistor radio or some shit on your shoulder

851
00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:47.560
and then they just talked you down,
you know?
Right.
Toggle left toggle.

852
00:51:47.561 --> 00:51:48.970
You had to pull it all the way down to your knee.

853
00:51:48.971 --> 00:51:51.550
And I remember there was this fat chick in the class and she couldn't get it

854
00:51:51.551 --> 00:51:55.060
around her ass and she ended up landing across the street and a pile of loom and

855
00:51:55.061 --> 00:51:59.470
she dislocated her knee.
Uh,
fortunately that did not happen for me and it was a,

856
00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:02.800
it was pretty awesome.
But I did it that one time.
Never needed to do it again.

857
00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:07.030
And,
uh,
I have the story,
I have the experience.
So maybe stand up.

858
00:52:07.031 --> 00:52:09.510
We'll just be that for you.
Um,

859
00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:14.550
or you could have the experience that I had were the first time I walked to the

860
00:52:14.711 --> 00:52:17.620
microphone,
I felt like I was like an out of body experience.

861
00:52:17.621 --> 00:52:21.400
Like I was watching myself do it.
And um,

862
00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:22.930
<v 0>okay.</v>

863
00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:25.810
<v 1>It was a,
I found my calling in life,</v>

864
00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:30.580
which is probably one of the most exciting things other than finding the person

865
00:52:30.581 --> 00:52:35.140
you're supposed to be within life.
So I got to tell you this dude,

866
00:52:35.141 --> 00:52:39.670
if you're in your office every day and it,
it is a miserable thing,

867
00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:41.980
that could mean that you're not,

868
00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:45.610
you don't have the right job or you need some sort of outlet.

869
00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:49.390
Maybe you're working too hard and maybe just going out and doing this one night

870
00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:55.050
and kind of remembering to try that going out and try new things is a fun thing

871
00:52:55.331 --> 00:53:00.280
to do.
Yeah.
You don't have to just be 100% about your career.
That's all.

872
00:53:00.281 --> 00:53:05.281
I think that's the thing a lot of fucking adults forget to do after a while.

873
00:53:05.591 --> 00:53:09.280
And you have like that thing.
Once you get your life down,
you know,

874
00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:13.810
I get up at this hour,
I drive down this street and I go to work.

875
00:53:13.811 --> 00:53:17.080
I do the same thing every day.
I'm comfortable.
I know everybody.

876
00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:21.430
There's no new challenges and then no one's gonna make fun of me like they did

877
00:53:21.431 --> 00:53:24.490
on the playground and punched me in the face for having freckles.
Right.

878
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.750
You can really get caught in that.
And then you get in a Rut.

879
00:53:27.751 --> 00:53:31.050
So I don't know if you just in a Rut with work or whatever,

880
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:35.640
but I would definitely recommend trying,
uh,
going out and try and stand up.

881
00:53:35.641 --> 00:53:37.950
Believe me,
dude,
it's a,

882
00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:42.780
I'm having more fun with it than I ever had an up 22 years in and I've,

883
00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:47.760
I never feel like,
wow,
I've had some struggles,
you know,
but you do with anything.

884
00:53:47.761 --> 00:53:51.670
But when I'm on stage doing it,
I never feel like,

885
00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:54.203
<v 0>mmm,</v>

886
00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:56.590
<v 1>I don't feel like how you feel in the office,</v>

887
00:53:56.591 --> 00:53:59.560
but I'm not going to lie to you before I started selling tickets,

888
00:53:59.561 --> 00:54:00.620
you would when you would.

889
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:04.900
It's just a fucking awful show and there was no security and everything,

890
00:54:04.901 --> 00:54:09.460
but you know,
anything worth having,
you know,
fish was fucking easy.

891
00:54:09.461 --> 00:54:11.650
Everybody would do it.
So anyways,
I'm getting too long winded here.

892
00:54:11.651 --> 00:54:16.030
Go out and try it.
All right,
next one.
A dear bill.

893
00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:19.570
You ruined the hobbit.
Um,

894
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:22.840
he said I'm a big fan of the podcast and your comedy.
Unfortunately,

895
00:54:22.841 --> 00:54:27.841
I made the mistake of looking up your comedy on Youtube and came across the clip

896
00:54:27.851 --> 00:54:31.270
where you took a shit on Lord of the rings.
You know what's funny?

897
00:54:31.271 --> 00:54:34.420
I don't even remember doing half of this shit.
I,

898
00:54:34.421 --> 00:54:38.470
you said it was the scene where the Gandalf stumbles,

899
00:54:39.310 --> 00:54:44.200
summons shadow facts,
the Lord of all horses.
Oh Jesus.

900
00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:49.180
And you pointed out how ridiculous that was.
Oh,

901
00:54:49.181 --> 00:54:50.020
I remember that.

902
00:54:50.021 --> 00:54:54.490
I am the Lord of all horses just so fucking over the top.

903
00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:59.440
He goes,
I don't consider myself to be a big nerd,
but I do love Star Wars,

904
00:54:59.441 --> 00:55:02.260
Lord of the rings and all that nerd stuff.
I like all of that shit.

905
00:55:02.261 --> 00:55:06.010
I watched the Hobbit for the first time yesterday and every time they said

906
00:55:06.011 --> 00:55:10.960
something ridiculous,
I pictured your ginger mug going,
oh Jeez.

907
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:14.470
That was literally laughing every 30 seconds.
Well,
there you go.

908
00:55:14.471 --> 00:55:18.100
Then I turned lord of the rings into a comedy for you.
Um,

909
00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:24.070
you know,
I saw a clip of one of those things with a guy just looks like,

910
00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:27.820
and he has elf ears and he talks to the,
to the,

911
00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:32.740
I am assuming a wizard,
you know,
why don't wizards ever get a haircut?
You know,

912
00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:35.080
why don't they ever have a take,
you know,
take it shave.

913
00:55:35.081 --> 00:55:38.230
Why don't you know why white?
Why can't you be a clean cut wizard?

914
00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:43.650
Are you so busy moving fucking mountains,
you know,

915
00:55:43.651 --> 00:55:48.060
somebody gets,
you know,
get them a little of those little toiletry bags,

916
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:52.590
the straight razor.
Um,
I was watching one of those things in,

917
00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:54.470
<v 0>okay,</v>

918
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:58.340
<v 1>I remember where the fuck I was at.
So I got on a plane.
It was I watching TV.</v>

919
00:55:58.341 --> 00:56:01.580
It's all running together at this point.
My age days fly by so quick,

920
00:56:01.581 --> 00:56:05.360
he can't even remember.
Did I dream that or did my neighbors say it?

921
00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:06.380
I can't even fucking remember.

922
00:56:06.381 --> 00:56:10.700
But I was watching one of those Elf movies and,

923
00:56:10.701 --> 00:56:11.600
uh,

924
00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:16.730
the fucking lead dude with the Karl Malden knows in the Spock ears.

925
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:22.650
He,
he found,
he found a ring.
Now for some reason I thought the ring,

926
00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:25.690
the Lord of the rings,
like if you had the rings,
I thought the rings will like,

927
00:56:25.691 --> 00:56:28.480
you know,
those magic rings that hacky magicians pull apart.

928
00:56:28.481 --> 00:56:31.210
I thought that they were that big.
It looked like he found a wedding ring.

929
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:37.600
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,
so he said he was laughing every 30 seconds.

930
00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:38.620
I'm am I,
he said,

931
00:56:38.621 --> 00:56:43.621
I hope you're happy that my enjoyment of the hobbit was a casualty on your war

932
00:56:44.261 --> 00:56:48.670
on nerds.
I don't have a war on nerds.
I just call them out on this shit.

933
00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:53.290
How arrogant is that?
I just try to keep them off the list.

934
00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:57.820
I do think that they should teach nerds out of fight rather than trying to stop

935
00:56:57.821 --> 00:57:00.910
bullying because you're not going to end bullying.
You know,

936
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:02.980
it's like I started watching the,
uh,

937
00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.100
the ultimate fighter where they have these,

938
00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:11.280
the women fighters now and I'm telling what I watched when I watched those women

939
00:57:11.351 --> 00:57:16.330
fight.
I get like,
like site for going.

940
00:57:16.331 --> 00:57:19.270
Like I hope some pervert tries to grab her ass.

941
00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:23.500
Like I hope a rapist.
Like I would never wish that on any of them.

942
00:57:23.501 --> 00:57:27.970
But for the love of God,
the next time a rapist tries to rape a woman,
a women,

943
00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:32.440
a woman,
like if she has the fucking skills that the women on the,

944
00:57:32.441 --> 00:57:35.680
on the ultimate fighter,
I mean,
it's just going to be,

945
00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:40.450
it's just going to be a great day for,
for humanity.
Um,

946
00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:44.850
you got to see that show,
dude,
these,
these women,
like for the most part,
they,

947
00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:47.920
they spar with men because I don't think there's enough women in the sport or

948
00:57:47.921 --> 00:57:51.620
whatever.
So these guys are kind of half ass in it and the women are going like,

949
00:57:51.621 --> 00:57:53.620
it's,
it's,
you know,
it's okay to hit me in the face.

950
00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:58.420
I'm just sitting there like watching the guy fighter still pulling his punches

951
00:57:58.421 --> 00:58:03.421
because it just goes against everything that you were taught and everything that

952
00:58:03.911 --> 00:58:08.911
is just right in the world to ball your fists up and actually swing in,

953
00:58:09.491 --> 00:58:11.800
in punch a woman is just like,

954
00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:16.290
I just don't think Christmas would ever be the same after that.
Like it just,

955
00:58:16.291 --> 00:58:20.700
it would just be something
you just,
you just would lose something.

956
00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:23.740
Um,
but anyways,
I mean they,

957
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:27.630
like I can tell you without a doubt,

958
00:58:28.050 --> 00:58:33.050
every woman on that show would beat the living shit out of me.

959
00:58:33.271 --> 00:58:34.380
I wouldn't have a prayer.

960
00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:37.560
There's nothing you can do once the that mixed martial arts,
you know,

961
00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:39.570
if a woman look like a woman boxer,

962
00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:44.690
you have a chance you could outwear and you can just fucking just shoot her legs

963
00:58:45.091 --> 00:58:48.120
and fucking put her on her back and just smother her with a pillow from the

964
00:58:48.121 --> 00:58:51.300
couch.
Right?
You got a shot.
But that UFC shit,

965
00:58:51.330 --> 00:58:52.890
you take him to the ground and then what?

966
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:55.110
Then they're going to fucking put you in an arm bar.

967
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:56.970
They're going to choke you out.
It's going to be over.

968
00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:01.800
So of course me being a guy,
being a fucking pig,

969
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:05.280
I of course got to look at them in a sexual way and I'm like going like,

970
00:59:05.281 --> 00:59:10.110
all right,
how do you rock that girl's world in the fucking bedroom?

971
00:59:10.111 --> 00:59:11.400
And I don't mean the girly ones.

972
00:59:11.401 --> 00:59:14.320
I mean the fucking ones that are like the one who would loan,

973
00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:17.870
who's a champion I the the,
the heavyweight champion or whatever.
Like I don't,

974
00:59:17.871 --> 00:59:19.230
I don't know what her,
what her name is,

975
00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:21.980
but that one I was just sitting there going,
all right,

976
00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:23.960
what would she like in bed?

977
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:25.510
<v 0>Okay,</v>

978
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:28.780
<v 1>that's going to go.
She is going to go one way or the other.</v>

979
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:32.020
She is either exactly

980
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:36.930
what you think she is.
You know,

981
00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:41.200
like the fucking Chicago bears are exactly what they were.
We,

982
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:45.120
she's easy to exactly what you think she's going to be.
Well,

983
00:59:45.121 --> 00:59:50.121
she's going to be dominant and fucking holding you down slash scaring the shit

984
00:59:51.061 --> 00:59:54.210
out of you.
Wondering if she's going to rip your Dick off or,

985
00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:55.620
<v 0>okay.</v>

986
00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:58.860
<v 1>I,
I would actually bet.
I don't know.</v>

987
01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.350
Do you want the other way?

988
01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:02.760
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

989
01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.470
<v 1>That she would actually be submissive.</v>

990
01:00:04.471 --> 01:00:08.970
She'd be so sick of beating the shit out of guys down in the octagon that she

991
01:00:08.971 --> 01:00:11.580
would actually almost like one of those fucking,
uh,

992
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:17.150
Wall Street guys that's calling all the shots and then it just gets so fucking

993
01:00:17.461 --> 01:00:22.461
sick of dominating the entire fucking planet that late at night goes to one of

994
01:00:22.501 --> 01:00:25.710
those acid and m things and gets on a swing with one of those orange balls in

995
01:00:25.711 --> 01:00:26.544
his mouth.

996
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:34.470
I don't fucking know,
but that's the shit I think of what I watched that show.

997
01:00:34.471 --> 01:00:39.150
You should definitely watch the ultimate fighter.
Uh,
do they had this woman,

998
01:00:39.151 --> 01:00:43.140
she looked like a fucking librarian or you know,

999
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:47.190
there's nerves she lost.
But I just thought it was fucking awesome.

1000
01:00:47.191 --> 01:00:50.280
Just looking at it going like,
look at that won't make,
you would have no clue.

1001
01:00:50.490 --> 01:00:52.620
You'd have no clue that,
you know,

1002
01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:57.030
if you talk some shit to her that she would just start raining elbows down on

1003
01:00:57.031 --> 01:01:00.420
you.
I just think it's fun.
I think it's amazing.
It's really fucking amazing.

1004
01:01:00.421 --> 01:01:02.370
Anyway,
so let's,
let's get on with the,
uh,

1005
01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.220
so I guess I ruined the podcast for this guy.

1006
01:01:05.221 --> 01:01:09.900
I got to read the last paragraph here.
He says,
uh,
also it might,

1007
01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:14.730
it might be a good idea to watch the movie and record your reactions.
I'll do it.

1008
01:01:14.731 --> 01:01:16.080
I can't sit through that shit.

1009
01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:16.930
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1010
01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:20.560
<v 1>Like it's too fucking lie.
He goes,
there's a scene where a wizard called</v>

1011
01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.270
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1012
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:23.200
<v 1>rat aghast.</v>

1013
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.770
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1014
01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:29.770
<v 1>Rat against the brown is being chased by Warburg's big wolves riding a sleigh</v>

1015
01:01:30.531 --> 01:01:34.970
pulled by bunny rabbits.
Do this movie.
Like I would,

1016
01:01:35.110 --> 01:01:39.770
I would think that more like people who were into like hallucinogens would

1017
01:01:39.771 --> 01:01:42.950
actually watch this movie because that actually sounds fucking pretty amazing.

1018
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:47.130
He says,
Gandalf goes,
you can't outrun these wars.

1019
01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:53.300
They are vermilion war.
The other wizard actually responds.

1020
01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:58.990
There are,
oh,
these are,

1021
01:01:58.991 --> 01:02:02.500
and then he says in parentheses,
some corny fantasy place rabbits.

1022
01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:06.520
I'd like to see them try.
Oh,
so he goes,

1023
01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:10.720
you can't outrun the the war.
These wars there.
Vermilion works.
And he said,
well,

1024
01:02:10.721 --> 01:02:13.720
these are Lilliputian rabbits.
I'd like to see them try.

1025
01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:18.230
That's actual fucking dialogue.
He goes,

1026
01:02:18.231 --> 01:02:22.980
and then they actually in on his face with a look of pseudo pseudo bad ass

1027
01:02:22.981 --> 01:02:26.550
determination.
You know what,
dude?
I think I'm going to watch that movie.

1028
01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:32.370
I think I'll eat up like a fucking pot cookie.
Maybe I'll watch it.

1029
01:02:32.371 --> 01:02:33.210
I don't want to do that though.

1030
01:02:33.211 --> 01:02:37.440
I don't want to put that on youtube and me fucking high giggling like a fucking

1031
01:02:37.441 --> 01:02:40.020
school girl watching some wizard on.
Oh,
fucking rabbit.

1032
01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:44.280
I don't want to do that publicly.
I don't want to do that publicly.
All right.

1033
01:02:44.281 --> 01:02:49.170
Carrie Underwood.
He said she's a singer,
right?
He said,

1034
01:02:49.171 --> 01:02:50.970
I recently listened to your podcast,

1035
01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:55.380
or is that one of those guys with a woman name?
You know,

1036
01:02:55.381 --> 01:02:57.690
like that Shamar guy would have the fuck his name is,

1037
01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:03.270
does the hair products and also acts in movies,
doesn't he?
I came,

1038
01:03:03.271 --> 01:03:04.650
it was a fucking name is he goes,

1039
01:03:04.651 --> 01:03:08.520
I recently listened to your podcast concerning the song before he cheats by

1040
01:03:08.521 --> 01:03:11.380
Carrie Underwood.
Very funny.
By the way.
Uh,

1041
01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.100
you might be interested to know how she has a new song.

1042
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:18.210
She has a new song out that takes that theme to a completely new level in the

1043
01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:22.980
song to Black Cadillac's.
A woman discovers their husband is cheating on her.

1044
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:27.180
Apparently the mistress didn't realize he was married because she and the wife

1045
01:03:27.181 --> 01:03:29.370
collaborate on murdering the guy.

1046
01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:31.510
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1047
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:35.500
<v 1>Not just destroying his truck and humiliating him in front of a new girl.</v>

1048
01:03:35.530 --> 01:03:39.520
They end the guy's life.
Here are a few lines from the end of the song.

1049
01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:42.060
All right.
It says,
yeah,
they,

1050
01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:47.080
they took turns laying a rose down through a handful of dirt deep into the

1051
01:03:47.921 --> 01:03:52.630
ground.
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide.

1052
01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:56.080
So I'm thinking about writing my own country song.

1053
01:03:56.110 --> 01:04:00.250
The title might be something like cold dinner,
raw knuckles.

1054
01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:04.690
Yeah.
Well,
you know,

1055
01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:09.220
that's one of those double standards that you understand why it exists.

1056
01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.050
You know,

1057
01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:13.860
it's not like women go around killing guys all the fucking time when we're

1058
01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.230
really comes to violence.
Guys do it more to women than the other way around.

1059
01:04:17.290 --> 01:04:18.123
And uh,

1060
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:24.300
it's one of the things that makes it being a guy funny because if a woman

1061
01:04:24.301 --> 01:04:27.900
actually like right to the point of like cut and get your dick cut off by a

1062
01:04:27.901 --> 01:04:30.230
woman,
like it's just considered funny.
Like,
well dude,

1063
01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.210
she cut your dick off like other guys.
Just think it's hilarious.

1064
01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:36.000
We're not going to wear pink,
you know,

1065
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:39.630
for all the guys who got their dicks fucking sliced off and thrown in the

1066
01:04:39.631 --> 01:04:41.700
garbage disposal.
Well not,
we're just going to laugh at you.

1067
01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:43.493
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1068
01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.570
<v 1>What happened?
You know what?
I really hear that.</v>

1069
01:04:46.571 --> 01:04:48.700
I really don't hear that as an anti man thing.

1070
01:04:48.701 --> 01:04:52.510
I hear somebody who's struggling to find a followup hit and is going back to the

1071
01:04:52.511 --> 01:04:54.880
wealth possibly one too many times,

1072
01:04:54.881 --> 01:04:59.110
but then again I listened to ACDC and they had like three or four themes that

1073
01:04:59.111 --> 01:05:03.190
they have been doing for 40 years and I think they sound better.

1074
01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:07.300
Better than ever,
right?
They sing about their balls,
the devil,

1075
01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:11.650
women in electricity and it's worked for them.

1076
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:16.750
So good for her.
Good far.
Uh,
maybe next one will be like a,

1077
01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:21.610
the comes back like a Zombie and she has a relationship with a Zombie and then

1078
01:05:21.611 --> 01:05:25.300
he cheats on her
and then I don't know what she does,

1079
01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:28.930
however you kill a fucking Zombie and have to watch lord of the rings to figure

1080
01:05:28.931 --> 01:05:31.870
that one out.
Um,
advice on having a baby.

1081
01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:36.190
She had a baby marriage advice on having a baby.
Hey Bill,

1082
01:05:36.191 --> 01:05:39.970
I need some advice.
You're talking to me.
I what the fuck?

1083
01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.050
I'm nowhere near this.
He said,
my wife and I are both 27 years old.

1084
01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.240
She's a graduate from college and working.

1085
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:50.410
I'm getting a master's degree and will not be done for another two and a half

1086
01:05:50.411 --> 01:05:54.070
years.
The issue is she is getting to the point where she wants to have a baby.

1087
01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:55.780
Not now but some,

1088
01:05:56.410 --> 01:06:01.410
but sometime right after I graduate I on the other hand and not wanting a baby

1089
01:06:01.751 --> 01:06:04.450
anytime soon,
but oh,

1090
01:06:04.451 --> 01:06:08.770
but by the time I graduate I will have been in college for nearly eight years

1091
01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.330
after I graduated.

1092
01:06:10.331 --> 01:06:14.050
My wife and I will have a dual income of well over a hundred grand a year.

1093
01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:17.080
I grew up in a family,
in a fairly poor family.

1094
01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.710
I worked hard to get my schooling so I want to enjoy the rewards.

1095
01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:24.670
I want a nice apartment,
nice things,
and to travel the world.

1096
01:06:24.671 --> 01:06:25.990
If we just started having kids,

1097
01:06:25.991 --> 01:06:30.730
we won't be able to travel and if we just have kids right after I graduate,

1098
01:06:30.731 --> 01:06:34.450
I'll go from a life of stress from school to a life of stress from parenthood.

1099
01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:36.370
By understand my wife's concern.

1100
01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.180
If we wait until we are 33 or 34 to start having kids,

1101
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:44.710
we could have some trouble conceiving.
And if it takes us too long,

1102
01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:49.810
she could give birth to mentally challenged child,
which does run in my family,

1103
01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:52.510
Jesus Christ to this is one of the more serious ones.

1104
01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:57.010
I love my wife and plan on being with her the rest of my life.

1105
01:06:57.130 --> 01:07:00.970
It's just a shame that my goals are to travel and have nice things in her goals

1106
01:07:00.971 --> 01:07:04.660
are to start a family.
So what do you think,
Bill?
Any advice?
Uh,

1107
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:06.640
that's some pretty heavy shit there.
Um,

1108
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:12.430
well I don't understand why when you're,
you're,
um,

1109
01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:18.600
going to school right now that you guys can't save up a little bit of money and

1110
01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:23.130
go to Aruba for a few days.
You could do little mini ones you don't want,
I mean,

1111
01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:28.470
I think there's a way to kind of do both.
And um,

1112
01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:33.330
I think if you express all your concerns to your wife and just say,
look,

1113
01:07:33.331 --> 01:07:36.270
I don't want to be that couple that just goes from school to having kids.

1114
01:07:36.271 --> 01:07:40.710
And then once we have kids,
all we do is just do the kid thing.

1115
01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:43.800
Um,
I dunno dude,

1116
01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:47.650
I don't know what to tell you here.
Um,

1117
01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:54.090
fuck.
I definitely understand.
I mean,

1118
01:07:54.091 --> 01:07:55.410
you went from a life of poverty,

1119
01:07:55.411 --> 01:07:58.170
it's right to a life of school and then you're going to go right to a life of

1120
01:07:58.171 --> 01:07:58.891
being a parent.

1121
01:07:58.891 --> 01:08:02.970
When do you actually get to sit back and enjoy a nice flat screen TV,

1122
01:08:02.971 --> 01:08:07.440
watches some sports or maybe go travel in Europe or something like that.

1123
01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:11.880
Um,
look to it.
You could do this.
You could have a kid,

1124
01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:16.520
I don't know how close you are with,
you know,
the on either side.

1125
01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:19.640
Um,
I think you can have your cake and eat it.

1126
01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:25.120
Why don't you just have a fucking kid and then also save up for a fucking epic

1127
01:08:25.851 --> 01:08:29.900
10 day trip somewhere through,
um,

1128
01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:34.910
through Europe and then just,
just make a pact with your wife and just say,

1129
01:08:34.911 --> 01:08:39.410
listen,
once every two years or once every whatever,

1130
01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:41.390
I want to,
uh,

1131
01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:45.920
I want to go on a trip and we'll leave the kid behind or the kids behind.

1132
01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:50.540
My parents did that.
They went to Vegas and my grandparents parents came to time.

1133
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:54.140
It was great.
We ended up developing a relationship with our grandparents.

1134
01:08:54.141 --> 01:08:58.010
It was a good thing and it was also good socially.

1135
01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:02.690
It was good for us as kids to have a different sort of disciplinary dynamic.

1136
01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:03.981
Jesus Christ.

1137
01:09:03.981 --> 01:09:06.980
I remember I tested my grandmother too when she broke a fucking wooden spoon

1138
01:09:06.981 --> 01:09:09.800
would have been over my head,
but I got my arm up and I blocked it.

1139
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:13.760
I kept messing up.
I saw her the way we will rent in this.

1140
01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:17.890
We lived in a duplex when I was a kid for a certain,

1141
01:09:17.891 --> 01:09:22.730
a number of years in the way we had it set up was,

1142
01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:27.300
uh,
it went kitchen living room.
And then dining rooms.

1143
01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:28.580
He had to walk through the living room.

1144
01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:32.270
We kind of altered the living room and kitchen a couple of times trying to

1145
01:09:32.271 --> 01:09:34.970
figure out which was best.
And uh,

1146
01:09:34.971 --> 01:09:37.370
this was just a period where there was a,

1147
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:42.430
it went kitchen and then we had the living room and then we're using the other

1148
01:09:42.891 --> 01:09:44.360
room was a dining room.
So anyways,

1149
01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:48.530
there was this old shitty rug and it was a hole in it.
So my mother had put up,

1150
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:50.720
throw rug over the hole on the floor.

1151
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:55.160
So I saw my grandmother walked by through the living room and she was setting

1152
01:09:55.161 --> 01:09:57.980
the table and she saw the,
uh,

1153
01:09:57.981 --> 01:10:01.970
the throw rug was messed up and I just heard her mumble to herself.
She said,

1154
01:10:01.971 --> 01:10:03.890
now why does this keep getting messed up?

1155
01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:09.600
So she walked into the kitchen,
that was literally my cue.

1156
01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:12.150
She'd straighten out,
walk to the kitchen.
So I said,
all right,
fine.

1157
01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:14.820
So I got off the couch and I messed it up and went over and I went back and I

1158
01:10:14.821 --> 01:10:19.500
sat down.
So then she comes walking out with the dishes or the food.

1159
01:10:19.501 --> 01:10:22.260
She sees it again.
She goes,
now what just happened?
It was Jack,

1160
01:10:22.261 --> 01:10:27.090
just straighten this out.
So she straightens it out.
It goes into the dining room,

1161
01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.940
walks back into the kitchen,
and then I got up and I messed it up again.

1162
01:10:29.941 --> 01:10:33.870
She came third time,
sees it again and she doesn't fucking say anything,

1163
01:10:33.871 --> 01:10:35.310
what should have been a warning to me.

1164
01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:40.450
So she straightened it out and then she walked into the kitchen and turned the

1165
01:10:40.451 --> 01:10:45.451
corner and I got back up again to go mess it up and right as I'm grabbing it to

1166
01:10:45.651 --> 01:10:47.360
mess it up,
I hear,

1167
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:52.010
I hear this stomp and she took a quick step back and look back out and right in

1168
01:10:52.011 --> 01:10:56.690
the middle of it saw me messing it up and she just kept this wooden spoon in her

1169
01:10:56.691 --> 01:11:00.560
hand and just came fucking flying at me.

1170
01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:04.040
Like if it was an ax,
I wouldn't be here.
Right?
Was a hatchet.

1171
01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:06.800
I would have been dead.
She gave me like Billy Bob when she fucking,

1172
01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:09.900
when he kills that country singer,
right.
Came flying out.

1173
01:11:09.901 --> 01:11:13.600
And I just remember crouching down and put my arm up and it

1174
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.590
<v 3>did fucking snapped in half off on my forearm.</v>

1175
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:21.150
She had this look of anger on a face,
slammed it down,
snapped it over my arm,

1176
01:11:21.151 --> 01:11:24.330
and then she just,
after it snapchat,
she just went,
wow,

1177
01:11:24.331 --> 01:11:25.290
that's the end of that spoon.

1178
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:28.950
And then she just walked back out into the kitchen and uh,
that was it.

1179
01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.520
So I think that's a good thing if they stay,

1180
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:34.380
if they stay with their grandparents,
I think you can do both.

1181
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:38.580
I think as a couple,
if you really sit down and you say,
what's important to you?

1182
01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:39.903
MMM.

1183
01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:42.670
<v 1>You know,
and this is very easy for me to say,</v>

1184
01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:47.700
not having a child and having it completely consume your life.

1185
01:11:47.771 --> 01:11:50.710
You who knows your priorities might change or whatever.

1186
01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:54.550
But there's also something to say too,
that if you start early,
I mean,

1187
01:11:54.551 --> 01:11:55.331
if you start it now,

1188
01:11:55.331 --> 01:11:59.230
you're 27 you kid would be 18 when you're 45 my age right now.

1189
01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:00.690
And then you can travel.

1190
01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:02.660
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1191
01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:06.350
<v 1>You know,
45 kids out of college by the time you're 49,</v>

1192
01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:09.650
then you have your golden years,
50,
60,
seventies,
eighties,
depending on how,

1193
01:12:09.770 --> 01:12:11.620
if you eat right,
you Joe's,

1194
01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:15.230
you can live right up to fucking 90 and you can go see the God damn world.

1195
01:12:15.231 --> 01:12:17.990
But there's no reason why you can't do that right now,

1196
01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:20.360
even though that you're in school.

1197
01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.660
There's no reason why he can't go to Puerto Rico or go to Hawaii.

1198
01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.300
There's some beautiful cities up in Canada.
You know,
Vancouver,
Toronto,

1199
01:12:29.301 --> 01:12:31.340
Montreal is fucking tremendous.

1200
01:12:32.050 --> 01:12:32.883
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1201
01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:37.140
<v 1>There's all beautiful,
uh,
cities here in the states.</v>

1202
01:12:37.141 --> 01:12:41.040
There's all kinds of things that you can do and you can do them really cheaply

1203
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:44.940
when you don't have any kids to literally just backpack it.

1204
01:12:44.941 --> 01:12:48.810
Just put a backpack on,
staying fucking hostels.
Who gives a fuck?

1205
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:54.420
You know,
just go.
I would just say,
go and do it.
I would just,

1206
01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:59.970
yeah,
do it now.
Do it now.
Uh,
but I think that you can do both.
And,
um,

1207
01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:04.290
I also say everybody I know who's ever had a kid has never regretted it.
Never,

1208
01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:06.470
never,
ever regretted it.
So,
um,

1209
01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:07.870
<v 3>yeah,</v>

1210
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:08.900
<v 1>you know,
I,
I,
but I,</v>

1211
01:13:08.901 --> 01:13:11.740
I think it's also important that if you do something like that to,
to,

1212
01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:15.670
to not lose yourself in all of it.
All right there.
I've said my peace.
All right.

1213
01:13:15.671 --> 01:13:19.900
Continuing on here.
Alcohol problem.

1214
01:13:19.901 --> 01:13:23.640
Love the podcast watching a stand up right now on Netflix and has me crying
left.

I'm 25.

1216
01:13:25.871 --> 01:13:29.710
I'm a 25 year old male and I'm starting to come to terms with the fact I have an

1217
01:13:29.711 --> 01:13:33.640
alcohol.
Oh wait,

1259
01:16:06.851 --> 01:16:11.410
alcohol problem.
I drink six days a week and blackout at least once a week.

1260
01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:16.150
All right,
well the only saving grace you have is your 25,

1261
01:16:16.151 --> 01:16:19.210
so you might just be a little immature.

1262
01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:22.150
I don't know if you're an actual alcoholic,
but let me read the rest of this.

1263
01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:25.070
He says,
I drink six days a week blanket at least once a day.

1264
01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.250
The nights I get really drunk,

1265
01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:31.660
I really regret doing it and regret my actions.
Nothing serious,

1266
01:16:31.690 --> 01:16:36.640
just phone or text conversations I have with people I've considered going to Aa

1267
01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.310
but never have gone through with it.
Um,

1268
01:16:39.311 --> 01:16:43.210
I finally quit smoking two months ago and I'm worried if I tried to quit

1269
01:16:43.211 --> 01:16:45.370
drinking now I will start going crazy.

1270
01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:48.280
I know you have always mentioned you are stupid,

1271
01:16:48.281 --> 01:16:52.130
but I honestly agree with most of the advice you give up.
Well thank you.
He said,

1272
01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:52.901
my question is,

1273
01:16:52.901 --> 01:16:57.901
do you think I should try and quit cold Turkey or are there any other options I

1274
01:16:58.031 --> 01:16:58.601
can take?

1275
01:16:58.601 --> 01:17:02.950
One of my concerns with quitting completely is that most of my friends drink and

1276
01:17:02.951 --> 01:17:05.200
go out on weekends.
Um,

1277
01:17:05.201 --> 01:17:10.201
and I don't want to list risk losing all of my social life and seeing and seeing

1278
01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:16.520
me friends got all Irish.
Sarah's seeing me friends appreciate the advice.

1279
01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:19.760
Um,
all right dude,

1280
01:17:19.761 --> 01:17:24.410
all I can do is just tell you what has worked for me when I'm not drinking.

1281
01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:25.273
And

1282
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.920
<v 3>MMM,</v>

1283
01:17:28.150 --> 01:17:32.440
<v 1>the first two,
three days are brutal because all you've gone is two,</v>

1284
01:17:32.441 --> 01:17:35.170
three days and there's definitely that feeling of,
well,
if I drink now,

1285
01:17:35.171 --> 01:17:37.180
I can start over again.
It's just trying to make up three days.

1286
01:17:37.181 --> 01:17:38.950
But if he can get through the first two,
three days,

1287
01:17:38.951 --> 01:17:41.660
once you get to the fourth day,
it's like,
all right,

1288
01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.360
I got a nice little streak going here.

1289
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:47.080
Like I'm up to six days right now and I'm,

1290
01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:52.750
one of the hardest things to do is when you go out socially with people.

1291
01:17:53.530 --> 01:17:58.390
But I found that all you have to do,
all I have to do,

1292
01:17:58.420 --> 01:17:59.330
cause I don't know how dude,

1293
01:17:59.350 --> 01:18:03.640
if you're a full on alcoholic and you have the disease that might be harder for

1294
01:18:03.641 --> 01:18:07.840
you and you really should probably,
I would say talk to a recovered alcoholic.

1295
01:18:08.290 --> 01:18:09.460
But if you're like me,

1296
01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:14.620
all it takes is going out to the bar that first time when everybody's drinking

1297
01:18:15.970 --> 01:18:17.590
and you just order a,

1298
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:21.700
I try to stay away from Soda and club Soda because then I mean that shit's not

1299
01:18:21.701 --> 01:18:25.570
good for either and I usually just order the cranberry juice and deal with the

1300
01:18:25.571 --> 01:18:28.660
departed.
Well what do you on your period jokes that everybody does?

1301
01:18:28.690 --> 01:18:31.300
I usually just go,
I don't even do cranberry and soda.

1302
01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:36.430
I just to cranberry juice straight up with lime and I just sorta nurse that

1303
01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.460
<v 3>and then um,</v>

1304
01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:43.490
<v 1>I just kind of drink waters and you're actually,
you're fine.</v>

1305
01:18:43.530 --> 01:18:47.910
You just got to do that that one night and then you've kind of set up a new

1306
01:18:47.911 --> 01:18:52.911
social experience that you're comfortable with and you can still go out and I

1307
01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:53.851
got to tell you,
yeah,

1308
01:18:53.851 --> 01:18:58.080
you get a distinct advantage when you're sober and everybody else's basically

1309
01:18:58.081 --> 01:19:02.460
getting fucked up because they're kind of,
first of all,
it's,

1310
01:19:02.490 --> 01:19:07.490
it's really entertaining to watch people just sort of roof roofie themselves and

1311
01:19:07.621 --> 01:19:09.900
you get through watching their behavior.

1312
01:19:09.901 --> 01:19:14.820
You get to see all the dumb things that you've done.
Um,
so you get to,
um,

1313
01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:18.240
without judging your friends,
you just sort of get to be like,
wow,

1314
01:19:18.241 --> 01:19:21.360
I was doing that.
I was doing that.
Especially with alcohol.

1315
01:19:21.361 --> 01:19:26.330
I always say judgments the first thing to go.
And,
um,
I dunno.

1316
01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:29.790
I think you also have a better chance of meeting,
um,

1317
01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:32.490
a really nice woman if you're the sober one,

1318
01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:34.920
cause you're going to come off as responsible.

1319
01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:39.540
And also if your friends are also hitting on her and they're all sloppy drunk,

1320
01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:44.810
you're going to look even better yourself.
So I would,
you know,
if you,

1321
01:19:44.811 --> 01:19:47.100
if you're not feeling Aa,
which I understand,

1322
01:19:47.101 --> 01:19:52.080
if you just try you,
you what it is.

1323
01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:54.600
I don't know.
I have to replace the activity.

1324
01:19:55.740 --> 01:20:00.540
Like this week I decided,
you know,
that I was going to stop drinking.

1325
01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:05.840
So then what I did was I dove into playing drums and I'm doing that,

1326
01:20:05.970 --> 01:20:09.720
that Mike Johnston 10 days to faster hands workout.

1327
01:20:10.050 --> 01:20:14.940
So I just sort of replace,
you know,

1328
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:20.010
like at night I just sorta like,
okay,
I'll go downstairs and I'll work,

1329
01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:24.120
I'll do the practice pad thing.
And uh,
you know,

1330
01:20:24.121 --> 01:20:28.470
I started working out.
He just,
you know what it is,
dude,

1331
01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:34.590
I feel you gotta replace the time that you're drinking and doing dumb shit with

1332
01:20:35.041 --> 01:20:39.870
shit that's also fun.
But you're sober doing it.
Because for me,

1333
01:20:39.871 --> 01:20:44.190
it's like if I just don't drink and I'm just sitting around doing nothing,

1334
01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:46.580
that's gonna make me want to drink because it's just like,
well,

1335
01:20:46.581 --> 01:20:48.390
I usually go out and drink and have fun right now,

1336
01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:52.320
but if I'm actually doing something else,
um,

1337
01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:55.530
like went out and I saw a movie last night,
he just,

1338
01:20:55.531 --> 01:21:00.240
you fill up the time to learn how to cook.
There's all kinds of key learnings.

1339
01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.420
Fucking second language.
There's all kinds of things do that.
Like,
you know,

1340
01:21:03.421 --> 01:21:07.140
basically you're in your twenties right now and uh,
you know,

1341
01:21:07.141 --> 01:21:10.320
you're trying to appeal to the opposite sex here.
So you know,

1342
01:21:10.321 --> 01:21:13.140
if you can add some shitty a game,
you're going to move up in the draft.

1343
01:21:13.141 --> 01:21:15.630
You're going to get a better woman here.
If you're fucking bilingual.

1344
01:21:15.631 --> 01:21:19.650
What woman doesn't like that is sober and responsible.
She's going to like that.

1345
01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:22.880
Who knows?
You learn to play a couple of songs on a Flamenco Guitar,

1346
01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:26.550
take around on a fucking row boat.
You're in there,
bunch of grit.

1347
01:21:26.551 --> 01:21:30.350
Nothing bad comes from becoming sober other than your,

1348
01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:32.460
you are bored shitless but you,

1349
01:21:32.530 --> 01:21:35.940
you've head gets smaller because you drop all that booze way.
I'm telling you,

1350
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:40.450
you,
you won't regret it.
You definitely won't regret it.
Um,
but like I said,

1351
01:21:40.451 --> 01:21:42.160
if he got the disease and that thing,
you might,

1352
01:21:42.190 --> 01:21:43.720
you're going to need more professional help.

1353
01:21:43.721 --> 01:21:48.520
And I would actually seek out a fellow alcoholic.
Um,

1354
01:21:49.690 --> 01:21:53.650
and then I would use AA and all of that shit.
You,
Eh,
you know,

1355
01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:58.470
I dunno.
I'm just a control freak and I don't like people telling me what to do.

1356
01:21:58.471 --> 01:22:03.180
So I would have to use it in a way that worked for me.
You know,

1357
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:06.150
I'm not going to be standing down there smoking cigarettes,
eating donuts,

1358
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:10.700
you know,
talking to those people with their yellow fingers and shit.
Like I,

1359
01:22:10.701 --> 01:22:13.140
I couldn't do it that way.
I got buddies of mine,

1360
01:22:13.141 --> 01:22:16.470
they go every once in a while to go to a meeting,
you know,

1361
01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:19.770
like the way I go to church every once in a while with fucking once a year

1362
01:22:19.771 --> 01:22:21.770
they'll do a boy,
whatever works for you.
But I'm not,

1363
01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:26.430
nothing bad ever comes from a cleaning up your act.
So,
uh,

1364
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:32.880
I hope that helps you.
All right.
Okay.

1390
01:24:19.181 --> 01:24:22.750
if you haven't watched the world series yet,
uh,
it's a dandy.
Two Games.

1391
01:24:22.751 --> 01:24:26.320
That piece.
One more game in St Louis.
Oh,
you know what I didn't talk about.

1392
01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:30.880
I know that the,
the world series has always been to three too.

1393
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:35.590
I always feel like I always just feel like the three in the middle.

1394
01:24:35.710 --> 01:24:40.500
What would you rather have if you were managing the team?
Would you rather,

1395
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:43.720
I just feel like the advantage goes to the team with the lesser record with

1396
01:24:43.721 --> 01:24:44.710
those three in the middle,

1397
01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:50.040
even though overall four to seven games you're going to be on the road.

1398
01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:54.160
I just feel like the way it's broken up,

1399
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:58.720
you just sort of spend a weekend in Boston and then you host a home stand,

1400
01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:03.820
right?
You got three straight games.
We could sleep in your own bed,

1401
01:25:03.821 --> 01:25:07.570
eat your own food,
fucking chill out.
And then if need be,

1402
01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:10.250
you go back and you're getting how you deal with another weekend.
They,

1403
01:25:10.251 --> 01:25:13.280
they break it up nicely.
Um,

1404
01:25:14.710 --> 01:25:16.120
and I feel like the two,
three,
two,

1405
01:25:16.121 --> 01:25:18.940
it just gives the team with the lesser record home field advantage.

1406
01:25:18.941 --> 01:25:22.540
So the first five games that makes games one and two a must win for the team

1407
01:25:22.541 --> 01:25:27.430
with the better record.
But,
uh,
I dunno.
Maybe that's just me.

1408
01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:31.090
My anxiety is a fan and maybe professional athletes could,

1409
01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:35.590
they don't give a shit.
But I've always found that weird.
Like I,

1410
01:25:35.591 --> 01:25:39.820
I liked when the NBA used to do two,
two,
one,
one,
one.
Um,

1411
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:43.920
it seemed fair,
but I think the athletes didn't like to travel.
You know,

1412
01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:46.540
they got to lug all that TV equipment.
I don't know.
They just,

1413
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:50.020
that's just one to think about.
All right,
so that's the deal.
Everybody,

1414
01:25:50.021 --> 01:25:52.690
that's the podcast far for this week.
Go fuck yourselves.

1415
01:25:52.691 --> 01:25:54.010
We'll talk to you next week.
Goodbye.
