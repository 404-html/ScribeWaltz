00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.030
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.460
It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:08.990
September 28th,

4
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.660
2015 what's going on in Iowa?
Yeah.
How's it going?

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.670
Oh yeah.
Fucking burned out.
Uh,

6
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:22.170
just got back from the road.
Ah,
what a tour I had.
What a lovely,

7
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:25.020
wonderful time I had going all the way through Texas.

8
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:28.480
I want to thank everybody who came out to the shows this week.
Uh,

9
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.400
we had an awesome time.
Probably too much fun,
if you know what I mean.
Um,

10
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.940
and when I say that,
I mean I'm on my way back.

11
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:39.960
The pendulum's swinging back the other way for me to become a fat pasty titty

12
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:44.760
jackass again.
However,
I am a,
I'm going to nip it in the A,
is it in the bud?

13
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.740
Is it in the bud?
You know,

14
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.310
nipping something in the button like a dog bite somebody in the ass.
So you are,

15
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:53.310
you're pruning a fucking flower.
I have no idea.

16
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:57.720
But what I do know is that I'll get a hundred emails telling me how fucking dumb

17
00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:01.140
I am.
Um,
but getting a bunch of those lately.

18
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.890
Jesus Christ to fucking critics out there.
Yeah,

19
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.290
mother fuckers.
It just,
I'm just taking it,

20
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.770
just taking my God damn knees out lately,
you know?

21
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.970
Did I ever say I was smart?
I don't think I did.

22
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.280
I don't know.
I don't know what their problem is.
Oh,
I know what their problem is.

23
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:20.491
Yeah.

24
00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:23.550
They probably didn't go after what they wanted in life and now they're fucking

25
00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:28.280
miserable.
So they just sit around on me,
Eh,
dino,

26
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.940
some jerk off,
send me an email.

27
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:33.210
He actually counted how many times me and Paul verse.
He said,
dude,

28
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.970
it was one of the saddest things I ever heard.

29
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.560
Why the fuck would you like counted over a hundred times?
That's what she did.

30
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.760
That's what she did with a half hour.
Your Life.
You fucking dope.

31
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.550
Some people,
you just want to fucking shaken by this shoulders.
Good Lord.

32
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:56.580
Turn it off then I do an apologize for the levels,
man.
I know.

33
00:01:56.581 --> 00:01:58.500
I fucked it up last time.
Uh,
you know,

34
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.980
it's this weird thing where the levels can be completely way too high,

35
00:02:01.981 --> 00:02:04.500
but if in the headphones you don't hear it,
you know,

36
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:07.380
that's what you have in mixer for.
It's actually what you have a sound guy for.

37
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:11.850
And I don't have one.
Um,
so I apologize for that.
Um,

38
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.490
but I think it was very fitting that the podcast on Thursday in an audio sense

39
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:21.420
was completely fucked up.
And for some of you in a verbal sense,

40
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.400
um,
anyways,
I think,
uh,
you know,

41
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.540
if you saw the fucking abuse that we did last week to our bodies,

42
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.300
I don't know what my fucking problem is that we,
I couldn't fucking stop,

43
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.080
couldn't stop.
Like every night I would be dragging ass,

44
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:39.870
getting ready to go do my show,
going through what the fuck am I doing?

45
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.550
Then the second he'd go out on stage,

46
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:45.270
the adrenaline starts going and you get a couple laughs,
you feel fucking great,

47
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.840
right?
And then literally the first show,
halfway through it,

48
00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:51.750
I'll just be thinking like,
Hey,
I can have a beer tonight.
I have one,

49
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.580
I'll have one.
Then I'll go to bed.
And it'll be fine.
And next thing you know,

50
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.360
you walk in the streets of San Antonio and the fucking security guard at the

51
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:04.600
Alamo tells you to get the fuck out of there.
You know,

52
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.060
it's versus running around.

53
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.380
Mercy goes,
take a picture of me in front of the Alamo,
right?
And I,

54
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.380
you got to know that right now.

55
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:18.670
How fucking drunk we are walking around like a couple of dopes with smoking

56
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:20.260
cigars of course.
Right?
And let's go,

57
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:23.920
let's go home and smoke a cigar in front of the fucking Alamo.
You know,

58
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.020
why not do that?
Why,
why learn about the history?
Um,

59
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.530
we actually ended up learning about the history cause for,

60
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.020
he went over and he goes,
don't take a picture of me in front of the Alamo.

61
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.050
And for some reason as this security guard working late night,
he goes,
hey,

62
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.540
you can't do that.
You can't do that.
Silversea goes,

63
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:44.920
take the picture and he rips his shirt off and makes this absolutely psycho look

64
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:48.350
on his face just to get the fucking security guard going.
Say,

65
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.300
what do you mean we can't do that?

66
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.190
Why can't we can't take a picture of the fucking Alamo,

67
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.550
is it after hours?

68
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.540
So then he comes up when he thinks we're a couple of drunk assholes,

69
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.260
which we are right?
You got to see the picture of Rosie.
I sent it to him.

70
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.860
Maybe he'll put it online.
I'm going to leave it up to him.
But dude,

71
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.610
I have to tell you,
Paul versus these,

72
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:09.580
one of the most happiest go lucky people I've ever seen in my life.

73
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.850
And he looks like a fucking serial killer.

74
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.060
Like I saw the photo and I said to him,
I was like,
dude,

75
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.720
if this picture was was the poster of a movie,

76
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.150
I would go see it immediately.
You look like a fucking lunatic.

77
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.970
Um,
so anyways,

78
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:31.120
the guy comes over and he starts talking to us and immediately we just started

79
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:35.020
asking them questions about the alimony.
He couldn't resist,
he couldn't resist.

80
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:37.960
And he started telling us all this information and I was sitting there going,

81
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:40.930
well,
like,
well,
no wonder all the guys died.
Look how small the Wallace,

82
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.340
that's like even smaller than that thing that people have to run up on.

83
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:48.610
And a at the end of the American Ninja Warrior,
you know,

84
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.930
if anything would fuck me over on that show,

85
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.300
as long as you had a decent halfway decent thing,
you could figure,

86
00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:58.470
you could work the grip strength up.
Right,
right.

87
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.480
If they had like a approaching 50 years old American Ninja Warrior obstacle

88
00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:06.760
course,
I feel like I could work my way up to get through it,

89
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.590
but there's nothing helping.
There's nothing helping my phone.

90
00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:13.000
I got white guy disease.
You know what I mean?
White guys,

91
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:16.780
we got those meaty calves.
They weigh us down.
You know what I mean?

92
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.150
We need those fucking deer legs.

93
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.410
We just don't have,
we got big dumb meaty calves.

94
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.190
Our calves are like fucking like ankle weights.
I don't know what it is,

95
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.410
but there's no fucking way I could ever get over that.

96
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.320
So I'm sitting there looking at the wall at the Alamo going like,
dude,

97
00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:36.190
I swear to God.

98
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.220
I feel like I could do a run plant one foot midway up the wall and I think I got

99
00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:46.130
a shot.
I got a shot,
man.
I could go right up and over.
What's up.
They had Dan,

100
00:05:46.131 --> 00:05:51.130
you'll bone.
What do you say to his Sam Houston was Davy Crockett.

101
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.740
Huh?
What about that guy who settled Virginia and Bang,

102
00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:59.570
the Indian woman and then they shaved his head and they made him one of them,

103
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.950
right?
Then they murdered everybody but him.
What was his name?
What was it?
Eddie.

104
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:08.690
Virginia.
I know it has something to do with Virginia.
Tim Richmond,

105
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.180
the fuck was his name.
Michael West Virginia.

106
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.170
Um,
Jones town.

107
00:06:19.171 --> 00:06:20.460
What the fuck was that guy's day?

108
00:06:20.461 --> 00:06:22.920
But we'll do the first settlement down there in Virginia.

109
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.580
I know there's the city of,
there's a street named after him,
isn't there?

110
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.760
That guy fucking did it.
Right?
Right.
He landed there and immediately interacted.

111
00:06:32.761 --> 00:06:36.960
Fucking started bagging one of the natives.
That's what you do.
You simulate.

112
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.950
It was like,
oh yeah.
Is that how you make corn?
And that's fantastic.

113
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.950
Show up with a belt.
Buckle on your hat.
I mean,

114
00:06:43.951 --> 00:06:47.820
you think you're not going to get scalped you fucking dope standing there with

115
00:06:47.821 --> 00:06:48.720
your white sox.

116
00:06:48.721 --> 00:06:51.900
Like you're going to do the Billie Jean moonwalk across the fucking plane.

117
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.510
You know,
it's funny.
Did they even dress like that?
Okay.
You know,

118
00:06:56.511 --> 00:07:01.511
how much of of what you think is actual history is actually just what the first

119
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:05.900
people in Hollywood did when they made movies.
You know what I mean?

120
00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:09.740
And then that just became like,
oh,
this is,
this is what it was.
You know,

121
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.510
like I always do the classic when they talk about the,
uh,

122
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.250
native Americans and playing drums and they always do that.

123
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.020
Danna dunt dunt dunt dunt dunt dunt dunt dunt dunt that was completely made up

124
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:24.680
by a white guy.
There is no,
there's not one shred of evidence.

125
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.540
In fact,
one of my brothers one time took a tour someplace,
I dunno,

126
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:34.160
when Arizona and the guy was talking about Indians and native Americans,
sorry,

127
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:39.130
in percussion,
right.
And uh,
and he was going,

128
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.350
he was showing some of the ways that they would play the drums.
He goes,

129
00:07:41.351 --> 00:07:44.110
they would do it this way.
They do it this way.
They do it that way,
Yada,
Yada,

130
00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:44.711
Yada.
He goes,

131
00:07:44.711 --> 00:07:49.711
but at no point did they ever go banner [inaudible] killed though.

132
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.190
He crushed.
Got An applause break.

133
00:07:51.191 --> 00:07:54.100
The whole place started laughing because it was a bunch of white people,

134
00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:57.610
I imagine going,
Oh yeah,
that's what we,
it's what we thought they ted.

135
00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.920
So anyways,
we've got,
wait,

136
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.200
let me get back to what the fuck I was at solar at the god Damn Alamo,
right.

137
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.810
And,
um,
we started talking to this guy.

138
00:08:08.811 --> 00:08:13.310
He tells the whole fucking story,
man.
Jesus Christ.
It was brutal.

139
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.410
Oh really?
Bill was the massacre there.
Bra.
You know,

140
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.000
you good until you're actually there and you're looking at it and you're

141
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:21.500
standing on the grounds of it.

142
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.550
Cause what killed me was what they've left of the fort was the inner perimeter.

143
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.060
So where we were standing disrespectfully,

144
00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:31.880
taking silly photos was where a lot of people died.

145
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.670
They just took down the wall that was around the fort.

146
00:08:34.671 --> 00:08:37.160
So what we were looking at was this inner area,
you know,

147
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:39.710
we're probably the officer's,
yeah.

148
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.170
Took advantage of the women that were there.

149
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.390
Whatever the fuck happened back in the 18 hundreds,
I don't know.

150
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.940
And basically what happens when they showed up was they,
um,

151
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.990
they just fucking killed every guy there.
Even if you gave up,

152
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:54.590
they just lined you up and shot ya and it's fucked up as that was,

153
00:08:55.250 --> 00:09:00.170
I always think back
to whoever lost the war,

154
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:05.270
you know,
which I'm going on a limb here saying it was Mexico is,

155
00:09:05.271 --> 00:09:07.050
I have no idea cause they never talked to anyway,

156
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.510
the name of it talked about the fucking,

157
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.810
I don't even know when it happened to be honest with you.
I didn't take the tour.

158
00:09:11.811 --> 00:09:15.410
Like I said,
I was drunk with the cigar.
So,
um,

159
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.110
I mean it wasn't like the Spanish American war.

160
00:09:18.111 --> 00:09:22.010
Did that take place in like the Philippines,
something fucked up.

161
00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:23.870
Like I don't even know what this is fucking hilarious.

162
00:09:23.871 --> 00:09:25.640
Cause every history class I took when I was

163
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.080
just laughing now thinking of you guys rolling your eyes home barriers used to

164
00:09:30.081 --> 00:09:32.690
be embarrassed as an American that yet again,

165
00:09:32.691 --> 00:09:37.610
I'm doing this and this could go out to anybody outside of our borders.
Um,

166
00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:40.320
I should get audited right now for not knowing this shit.
Um,

167
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.760
they would always start with 1492.

168
00:09:43.761 --> 00:09:46.850
Columbus sailed the ocean blue and then the pilgrims,

169
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.460
and then they get to the revolutionary war.

170
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:54.140
Maybe the war of 1812 you'd get up to that and then they stopped and they just

171
00:09:54.141 --> 00:09:56.390
kept going back to it every fucking year.

172
00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.520
Just hammering that Shit and ta head Thomas Jefferson,
I could not tell a lie,

173
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.270
completely ignored the genocide of the native Americans.

174
00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.690
Completely ignored slavery.
Just ignore it.
All of it.

175
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:11.810
It's just every fucking year going back to the goddamn powdered wigs,

176
00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:15.200
I fucking hated it.
And then when I finally got to a,

177
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.310
I finally got to high school,

178
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.610
I took this honors history class because I actually liked history and then we

179
00:10:21.611 --> 00:10:24.880
did ancient medieval history.
Holy Shit.

180
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.390
That might have been the most boring stuff.

181
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:33.250
I just remember the cover of the book had this ancient medieval broken plate on

182
00:10:33.251 --> 00:10:35.260
it.
It almost looks like that stupid,

183
00:10:35.261 --> 00:10:38.350
that dead dish they give women when they win Wimbledon,

184
00:10:38.351 --> 00:10:40.870
which always cracked me up.
You know what I mean?

185
00:10:40.871 --> 00:10:44.020
They give a guy a chalice to drink fucking wine out of,

186
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.080
cause he gets blown by a hooker and a woman wins.

187
00:10:47.081 --> 00:10:49.900
Wimbleton they give her a plate.
Yeah.
Once you go make some biscuits.

188
00:10:49.901 --> 00:10:50.734
This sweetheart,

189
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:58.540
I'm surprised feminist groups haven't complained.
Like why don't we get a trophy?

190
00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.290
Why do we get that deviled egg fucking plate?
You know what I mean?

191
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:08.050
I Dunno.
Maybe it's considered a plaque.
The fuck do I know?

192
00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.780
I thought the Spanish American war happened in the Philippines.

193
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.800
I know we went over to the Philippines at some point we did some sort of damage.

194
00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.920
Um,
but could I find it on a map?

195
00:11:17.921 --> 00:11:21.800
Actually I could because I'd been to Singapore.
All right.

196
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.250
It was east of it.
It was east of Singapore.
Um,
if I remember correctly.

197
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.350
Oh yes.
I've,
I've spread my ignorance around the globe.
So anyways,
for there,

198
00:11:32.351 --> 00:11:34.750
and the guy was talking about,
you know how they,
they,

199
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.330
they let the women and children live,

200
00:11:37.331 --> 00:11:41.470
but they completely just killed every guy there.
Even if you surrendered,

201
00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.930
even as you were running away from the fourth.

202
00:11:43.931 --> 00:11:48.190
They just shot me in the back and I just was thinking like,
yeah,
man.

203
00:11:48.191 --> 00:11:52.670
I mean that's what she gotta do.
Like whoever that commander was,

204
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:56.700
Santa Monica,
whatever the fuck his name was,
Santa something or the Santa Cruz,

205
00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.950
San Jose.
I think it was a city,

206
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.530
but it was actually a guy who was like his last name.

207
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.140
I think even California had to give it up being like,
you know what?

208
00:12:04.141 --> 00:12:05.460
That mother fucker was going hard.

209
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.630
I know that's not his name and I don't have time to look it up because that

210
00:12:09.631 --> 00:12:11.380
would involve research.
All right,

211
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.980
so you just fucking sit there and your cubicle and you with to this.

212
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.670
How dare you judge me in my ignorance.

213
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.170
It's just sitting there at your job making money,
not doing your fucking job.

214
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.890
How dare you?
Uh,
maybe listening to it in your car.

215
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.280
I don't know what you're doing.
So anyways,
I always think that like,

216
00:12:29.281 --> 00:12:32.070
that's how hard,
like I have an hour.
I think about,
you know,

217
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:37.050
if I was a native American and I knew,
forget that if you knew,
if they knew,

218
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.230
there we go,
there's the fucking right thrown out.
Right set of pronouns.

219
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.220
Or is it an adverb?
Um,

220
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:47.730
if they knew what the fuck was going to go down,
can you imagined

221
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:54.480
that'd be a great series of films just called if they knew right.

222
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.220
And it all about history,

223
00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.990
about horrific wrongs that were done about one group of people to another,

224
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:02.280
you know.

225
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.810
But you know how each one of them would start every little clip of if they knew,

226
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.170
which,
start with a bunch of white people come pulling up in a boat.

227
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.350
Oh,
are these people everybody,
next thing you know,

228
00:13:18.351 --> 00:13:22.070
you were enslaved or you're fucking,
you know,
just getting murdered.

229
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.910
I always thought about if they knew like the native Americans,

230
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.300
what the fuck they were,
they would have,
I swear to God,

231
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:35.310
they would have all joined forces like in the warriors care.
You right.

232
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:40.730
And what day would have to do okay is they would have to let everybody come

233
00:13:41.701 --> 00:13:46.020
ashore,
right?
And this is what you do at night.

234
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:51.090
You slip onto the boats and you'd,
you kill everybody who was on the boat.

235
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.600
So now there's no escape.
All right?

236
00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:59.640
And then you'd have to murder everybody,
men,
women,
children,
all of them.

237
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:04.770
You'd have to murder all of them.
All right?
Then once all of that was done,

238
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.850
one group of people,
okay,
he's in charge.

239
00:14:08.851 --> 00:14:13.260
You've got to take those bodies and you have to drag those motherfuckers

240
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.920
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles inland,

241
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.330
and you've got to bury them when no one's ever going to find them.
All right?

242
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:22.590
And then meanwhile,

243
00:14:22.591 --> 00:14:27.591
another group of people has to systematically begin dismantling those ships.

244
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:30.743
All right?

245
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.790
So that the belief would be that they never made it to the shores of America,

246
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.690
right?
No,

247
00:14:39.691 --> 00:14:42.660
that wouldn't work because they just keep sending more in the boats would get

248
00:14:42.661 --> 00:14:43.494
better.

249
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:44.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

250
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.760
<v 0>I'm just trying to think like how could or the native Americans stopped?</v>

251
00:14:47.761 --> 00:14:52.620
What happened?
It's some point,
well,
I know what you're doing.

252
00:14:52.621 --> 00:14:54.890
You fucking,
you'd have to keep the weapons.

253
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.240
Why would you take apart the boat bill?
You fucking dope.
No,
keep the boat.

254
00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.220
All right.
Fuck down.
Let's,
let's back up here.
Still kill everybody on land.

255
00:15:05.221 --> 00:15:09.030
Still drag.
I'm a fucking couple hundred miles inland.
Still Barium.

256
00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.890
All right.
Kill everybody on the boat except for like five,
six people.

257
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.910
And then you go,
listen motherfucker,

258
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.770
if you don't teach us how to drive this God damn thing,
all right,

259
00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:21.540
we're going to fucking,
I dunno.

260
00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.020
We're going to do something to you that's going to be really painful.
All right?

261
00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:28.110
I know he's somehow you get get them to teach you how to drive the boat.

262
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:31.350
And once you get the boat right,
you start breaking down.
Uh,

263
00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.360
I dunno if a cannon balls and shit.
I don't know how you'd do it.

264
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.730
You just have to keep killing these motherfuckers.
Know.

265
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.080
Maybe the best way to do it is that they don't know.
You know what?

266
00:15:43.081 --> 00:15:47.280
I don't have a fucking solution.
God dammit.
White people are fucking evil.
Huh?

267
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.490
Even me as a white person,
you thinking I could figure out how to stop us.

268
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.410
You know what,
I got to get back to here.

269
00:15:55.411 --> 00:15:59.220
You could if you guys got any suggestions how you could have stopped her,

270
00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:03.120
but it is,
you have to do what they're doing to you,

271
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.150
what they're gonna do to you first.
That's the only way to do it.

272
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.960
You know what I mean?
People come over,
right?

273
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.930
They got a better pistol than you do,
right?

274
00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:14.520
And they think that God thinks what's said,

275
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:19.020
what they're doing is right and it's fucking over.
There's not going to be,

276
00:16:19.021 --> 00:16:20.640
the only time I have his fucking saw,

277
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:26.540
the indigenous people survived when a boatload of white people showed up was in

278
00:16:26.581 --> 00:16:31.530
New Zealand.
All right.
And if you saw the,

279
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:36.000
the,
the,
the people who are indigenous in New Zealand,
every one of them,

280
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:40.770
I swear to God,
is built like a hall of fame linebacker.
Like,

281
00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:43.920
and I'm not just talking about sa and they look like,
listen,

282
00:16:43.921 --> 00:16:47.580
this dude could change the fucking game and white people pulled up and were just

283
00:16:47.581 --> 00:16:51.090
like,
I,
uh,
you know what?
Let's,

284
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.500
we're going to be here with you and we're going to kind of like share this area.

285
00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.960
I mean,
I was only in New Zealand for like three fucking days,

286
00:16:57.961 --> 00:17:02.160
but that's what I was told a while,
drinking in a bar.

287
00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:07.590
I might be wrong,
it might be right.
You know,
hopefully it's wrong because a,

288
00:17:07.591 --> 00:17:10.890
you know,
somebody can count how many words I fucking used incorrectly.

289
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.770
Ah,
Shit.
What if I,
I don't think I've ever done that.
If I haven't counted words,

290
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.820
I don't know,
maybe,
maybe bill or that bill.
You know,

291
00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:28.860
why does everybody have to do what you do get to show,
right?
Go Fuck you.
So

292
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.760
trying to find this,
oh my God,
what the fucking notification thing.

293
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.820
You know something apple with this whole shit where they just have this new

294
00:17:36.821 --> 00:17:40.330
thing where they sync everything and you can't delete the APP and go fuck

295
00:17:40.331 --> 00:17:41.830
yourself.
This is how it's going to be.

296
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.900
Do you guys realize myself included that we are allowing the fucking nerds at

297
00:17:46.901 --> 00:17:51.840
apple to grab us by the back of the neck and shoved her face into dog shit and

298
00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:55.770
just,
we basically gave up some freedoms on this,
this new round with the,

299
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:58.260
with the,
the iPhone six and they're new.

300
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:03.030
They're a new Mac book air thing that I bought here.
You know,
as I sit there,

301
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.050
pay in the fucking person who's probably looking at me through that little video

302
00:18:07.051 --> 00:18:11.990
camera.
Right.
I just gave him the finger.
Oh,
you liked that.
I'm a rebel.
You know,

303
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:16.250
I'm stopping what's going on?
Um,

304
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.890
I don't know.
I just,
I resent the whole thing through my,
my,

305
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.160
my level of being a maniac with control,
being in control freak.

306
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.430
Do you know when I was in San Antonio,
um,

307
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.800
I believe we were at Trinity College.

308
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.180
Like every fucking Gig was just like wake up,
drive four hours,

309
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.810
get in the hotel,
shower,
put your clothes on,
go down,

310
00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.750
do the Gig and leave and have to fucking places.

311
00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:44.010
I didn't even know where the hell was that,
but uh,
but the shows are all shows,

312
00:18:44.011 --> 00:18:44.761
Ross.
And I'll tell you right now,

313
00:18:44.761 --> 00:18:47.910
I fucking love Texas and fuck everybody who says all the bad shit about it.

314
00:18:47.911 --> 00:18:51.690
I love those people down there,
man.
Fucking good time.
Um,

315
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.940
and I only had one fucking guy,

316
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:59.990
only one maniac that really just said something really ugly,

317
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:03.570
uh,
when I was on stage,
which was,
I thought it was pretty good.

318
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.740
I was doing this thing about Caitlyn Jenner and this guy in the upper deck just

319
00:19:07.741 --> 00:19:08.670
goes,
fuck that.

320
00:19:08.671 --> 00:19:13.530
Fuck it's science experiment or something like that.
I was just like,

321
00:19:13.531 --> 00:19:16.290
wow.
Right.
But you know,
it was great.

322
00:19:16.291 --> 00:19:19.290
I got like 20 emails from people from Houston that we're going,

323
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:24.210
how embarrassed they were and hoping that I wasn't going to judge Houston like

324
00:19:24.211 --> 00:19:25.080
that.
You know what I mean?

325
00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:29.100
Of course they didn't yell out while that was going on because uh,

326
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.220
when people are dumb to that level,
it's really loud.

327
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.130
I don't know why.
Look at me,
I'm dumb.
I'm really loud,
you know?

328
00:19:38.131 --> 00:19:41.190
But the dumber you get,
the louder you get.
Right.

329
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.760
And then people who know it's bullshit,
they just kind of sit through them.

330
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.340
That's embarrassing.
And I was just going to send an email,
a few people yelled,

331
00:19:47.341 --> 00:19:49.470
shut the fuck up.
I don't know what happened then when I was,

332
00:19:49.471 --> 00:19:51.540
the only thing other than that,
you know,
the way people,

333
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:53.450
especially out in Hollywood,
they way they look at,
you know,

334
00:19:53.451 --> 00:19:56.430
at the fucking elitists,
goddamn attitudes out of here.
I swear to God,

335
00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.890
I swear to God,
I thought I was liberal until I came out here.

336
00:19:58.891 --> 00:20:03.000
I cannot fucking stand the politics that are out here.
They are so fuck.

337
00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:05.040
It's literally Fox News to the left.

338
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:10.190
They areF as fucking ridiculous as anybody you've ever seen on who's that

339
00:20:11.521 --> 00:20:16.470
fucking chick who looks like she needs some iron in her system.
Whatever it is.

340
00:20:16.471 --> 00:20:20.670
She's got like gray skin mean to Rosie's.
Always talk about her.

341
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.390
She sounds like she manages wrestlers.
Like what she says is so over the top,

342
00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:26.550
whatever.
Obviously it's all the way to the right.

343
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.690
But out here in Hollywood you get that to the left.

344
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:35.040
It's as fucking ridiculous.
And um,
they think that just,

345
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:40.000
just as right.
Um,
I dunno,
I,
I just,

346
00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:45.060
I do not enjoy political conversation out here is not a fun thing to be involved

347
00:20:45.061 --> 00:20:47.220
in.
You know what I mean?
Don't we just put it that way.
So anyways,

348
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.120
the fuck was I talking about?
Oh,
there you go again,
Bill.
You know,

349
00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:54.670
you go on these fucking tangents and you forget what the hell you're talking

350
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:57.150
about.
Backing up here,
up here,
where the fuck you were at the Alamo.

351
00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:01.820
Then he did that,
that run through Texas,
Trinity College.
Some about Trinity Coll.

352
00:21:01.821 --> 00:21:03.190
Yeah.
I got a control freak thing.
Right.

353
00:21:03.191 --> 00:21:06.610
So coming out of fucking Trinity College and is what coming out.

354
00:21:06.611 --> 00:21:10.000
It's one of these old school venues where they used to build these venues and

355
00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:13.540
then there was just it,
there was one way in and one way out.

356
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.450
So it was going to be horrific.
Just,
you know,

357
00:21:16.451 --> 00:21:19.390
it reminds me way back in the day when they,
they uh,

358
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.590
when they first made great wards in Mansfield,
Massachusetts,

359
00:21:23.591 --> 00:21:24.670
I don't know what it's called now.

360
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.640
I saw Eddie Murphy there on the raw tour by the way,
had lawn seats.

361
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.960
The weather girls opened up.
It's one of my great,
I saw Stevie Ray Vaughan there.

362
00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:35.830
I saw so many fucking amazing shows there.
I saw Rodney Dangerfield.

363
00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.700
Jesus,
I'm old.
Um,
anyways,

364
00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:45.490
I saw Burt Lancaster.
Um,
what was I saying here?

365
00:21:45.491 --> 00:21:49.540
So the big thing about that venue is everybody's excited that they built it

366
00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:51.490
because all these great bands were going there,
but the,

367
00:21:51.491 --> 00:21:55.480
for some fucking reason there,
they had like,
it was like a driveway,
you know.

368
00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:57.340
So over the course of the day,

369
00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:02.140
like 20,000 fucking people would show up driving through this one entrance and

370
00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:05.500
there was already traffic,
but at the end,
all 20,000 tried to get out.

371
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.701
At the same time.

372
00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:10.660
I remember the local radio stations would do these hilarious bits about people,

373
00:22:10.661 --> 00:22:14.730
uh,
still there and not being able to get to work,
you know.
So anyways,

374
00:22:14.731 --> 00:22:19.030
so this was one of these types of venues,
uh,
accepted,
only held like 300 people.

375
00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.070
Fuck you.
But still,
you know what I mean?

376
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.990
It was going to be brought to try to get out of this.

377
00:22:25.991 --> 00:22:27.310
So we're running out of there.

378
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.670
I jumped in the car with Z and there's already people,
you know,

379
00:22:30.671 --> 00:22:33.640
running out to try to do what I'm doing.
So it was was sitting there,

380
00:22:33.641 --> 00:22:37.720
I want to bang a right when I get out of the driveway to go exactly where I came

381
00:22:37.721 --> 00:22:42.040
from.
And the cops telling me he sees my directional and he wants me to,

382
00:22:42.041 --> 00:22:44.350
he wants me to go left.
So I'm trying to go right.

383
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.510
And he blows the whistle points right at me and then points to the direction he

384
00:22:49.511 --> 00:22:53.980
wants me to go to.
And I fucking,
what got so mad.
I fucking pointed right at him.

385
00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.720
I pointed right back at him and I was like,
fuck you.
You do Shas I yelled at him,

386
00:22:58.721 --> 00:23:01.480
pointing at him.
Fortunately my headlights were on,

387
00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:05.920
it was dark out so he couldn't see it.
And I turned to the left and you know,

388
00:23:05.921 --> 00:23:09.130
it was funny.
It was,
it ended up being the proper way to go out.
It was,

389
00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:13.900
it was like a dream.
It was like melted butter.
He was actually doing me a favor,

390
00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:18.070
um,
and not steering me into trouble.
I swear to God,

391
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.800
if you saw the look on his face,
just looking at me like,
dude,

392
00:23:20.801 --> 00:23:24.820
what the fuck is wrong with you?
And the only,
I think redeemable,

393
00:23:24.821 --> 00:23:28.750
quality that I have about my personality is,
uh,

394
00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.240
when I do shit like that and somebody looks at me,

395
00:23:31.241 --> 00:23:34.150
I can I at least am a mature enough to be like,
yeah,
I know dude.

396
00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:38.740
High know a fucking moody psychopath.
I know.

397
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.750
You don't even have to say anything.
I see it on your face.
Sino you're right.

398
00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:48.720
Fucking can't get me off.
You got to fucking point and the whistle,
you know.

399
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.100
All right,
so I was wrong.
I'll fuck you guys.
All right,

400
00:23:53.101 --> 00:23:56.640
let's do some advertising for this week,
right?
Oh,
here we go.

401
00:23:56.641 --> 00:23:59.400
I don't know if I've got to send me,
I'm so fucking jet lag.

402
00:23:59.401 --> 00:24:03.420
Demato boat boat beyond Esbe.
I mean,
can I do this in a different,

403
00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.010
no,
I can't.
I don't have any musical telling me undies.
Me undies.

404
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:12.680
No more sweaty balls.
But due to,
to beyond these may or the,
she got a,

405
00:24:12.681 --> 00:24:17.080
by him in the fall,
it's going to get cold your balls or pull up in.

406
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.420
You got your check.
We'll laugh.
Where are your balls?
You got an empty bag.

407
00:24:21.421 --> 00:24:26.010
You're like,
I dunno.
A empty pillow case all.

408
00:24:26.011 --> 00:24:30.970
Yeah,
so get yourself so warm.
Fucking nuts with fucking be on days.
Alright.

409
00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.010
Uh,
me undies.

410
00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:38.310
We all know how sexy confidence can be and that confidence comes from being

411
00:24:38.311 --> 00:24:39.144
comfortable.

412
00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.390
But how great can you feel your underwear is wrinkling and riding up?

413
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:43.920
Be on these,
gets it.

414
00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:48.030
And that's why they've created the world's most comfortable underwear,
underwear,

415
00:24:48.031 --> 00:24:51.420
underwear for a daily dose of confidence.

416
00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.450
You wear your underwear,
you wear underwear every day.

417
00:24:54.451 --> 00:24:58.980
Unless you Matthew mcconaughey,
that's 365 days a year.
Rain or shine.

418
00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:03.120
You need it to be extraordinary without an insane price.
Tag me on these,

419
00:25:03.121 --> 00:25:04.500
understands this.

420
00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:08.970
They have compassion for your nuts and your wallet simultaneously.

421
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:10.420
That'd be a great day.

422
00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.410
Imagine they'd made underwear on at the same thing you made your wallet out of.

423
00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.170
You know what I mean?
Like a nice you.
We get a nice wallet,
you know,

424
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:17.850
sliding into your back pocket.

425
00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.160
Can you imagine that feeling every time you put your underwear on?

426
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:22.530
It felt the same as a nice quality wallet.

427
00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:26.940
Just slide right into your back pocket.
You know what I mean?

428
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.910
Like you getting ghost by some broad and you turn around,
hey,
how you doing?

429
00:25:29.911 --> 00:25:31.550
She goes,
hey,
you know,
dig.

430
00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.490
Maybe you want to come back in a stickier all prick between my tits.
You know,

431
00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:38.130
you know what?
I got to buy more wallets.
That's what's going to,

432
00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:45.490
when you look good,
you feel great.
People.
That's what I'm trying to say here.

433
00:25:45.491 --> 00:25:49.750
It's a cliche because it's true.
Um,
does that make sense?

434
00:25:49.751 --> 00:25:51.070
Technically me.

435
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.550
Andy's understands this and that's why they've designed underwear that makes you

436
00:25:54.551 --> 00:25:58.660
look and feel fantastic.
Please include all of the following points too.

437
00:25:58.661 --> 00:26:01.990
I'm Gunna,
if you wrote it down,
I'm going to fucking say it.
You assholes.

438
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.750
Me undies is made from modal.

439
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.200
It's a fabric that's twice as soft as cotton.

440
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.590
That's twice as soft as whatever underwear you're wearing right now.

441
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:16.090
Unless you wearing me undies,
me on these soft has a new wallet.

442
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:20.590
Biondi says tons of colors and styles and the only place to get matching pairs

443
00:26:20.591 --> 00:26:23.320
for men and women.
All right,
that's fucking weird.

444
00:26:23.321 --> 00:26:27.600
And then what are you going to walk down the street doing a tumbling act?
Um,

445
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.490
they even released a new design every month.

446
00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:35.860
I were fill in the blank design,
black stripes,
tied I,
et Cetera.

447
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.570
I wear whatever free ones.
Just send me me undies.
And you know what?
God Damn it.

448
00:26:40.571 --> 00:26:41.950
They feel good about that.

449
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.490
Is that enough of a personal story to keep you guys happy?

450
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.940
Plus we all know that it's a shit way too long.
They get it.

451
00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:51.050
It's comfortable underwear.
Let's get to the end here.
Uh,

452
00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.560
plus we all know that paying for shipping sucks.
So me,
and he says,

453
00:26:53.561 --> 00:26:56.820
remove all that from the equation by rolling it into the overall price of the

454
00:26:56.821 --> 00:26:58.830
underwear.
All underwear,

455
00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:03.150
the U S and Canada shipped for free me undies even has a money back guarantee.

456
00:27:03.151 --> 00:27:05.670
If you don't love your first pair,
you get to keep it for free.

457
00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:10.940
If you don't love it,
you'd throw it out.
You're literally has nothing to lose.
Um,

458
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:11.791

00:27:33.781 --> 00:27:35.370
Everybody shopping is awful.

466
00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:40.371
Who has the patience for crowded stores or the time to try on 10 pairs of pants

467
00:27:40.681 --> 00:27:44.970
that don't even fit well?
Um,
well it helps if you knew your size,

468
00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:47.940
these randomly grabbing them.

469
00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.960

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.670

Alright.
Legalism.

493
00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:16.950
He shouldn't have to choose a random lawyer who charges expensive,

494
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:21.120
expensive hourly rates.
When you need legal help,
you shouldn't have to do that.

495
00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:23.340
People,
that's all I'm trying to say in that long sentence.

496
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.240

Hey,
and,
uh,

520
00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.440
what they really should just be talking about is if you die unexpectedly and you

521
00:30:53.441 --> 00:30:56.890
don't have any sort of a will,
like the misery that you're adding to people,

522
00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:01.210
you know,
people start suing each other and all that type of shit,
or you know,

523
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:03.520
you can get sued because you didn't incorporate yourself.

524
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.130
It's a great way to fucking do it.
Right?
There's the layman terms.

525
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:11.140
I hope that made sense.
Um,
all right,
let's plow ahead here.
Uh,
I was,

526
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.580
oh,
you know what we went to,

527
00:31:12.581 --> 00:31:17.410
we went to Texas Osu on a Saturday and um,

528
00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:21.880
I gotta tell you,
man,
I,
I've been such a huge fan of the longhorns my whole life,

529
00:31:21.881 --> 00:31:26.260
man.
I just loved,
I just was fucking,
it was a great mascot,

530
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:31.510
great colors.
I started watching it back when like Jerry Gray was,
um,

531
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.500
one of their big,
um,
all Americans.
I remember you went with the rams.
If I,

532
00:31:35.501 --> 00:31:36.940
if I was correct,
it was just a fan.

533
00:31:36.941 --> 00:31:41.620
And then I thought he was fucking great player.
I missed Earl Campbell,
but,

534
00:31:41.621 --> 00:31:45.700
um,
they were always good.
Texas football was always his shit.

535
00:31:45.701 --> 00:31:48.370
So I always wanted to go and as I mentioned before,

536
00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:51.340
I think I told this last time I will always wanted to go.

537
00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:54.670
And I booked myself with the cap city comedy club when they were playing

538
00:31:54.671 --> 00:31:55.780
Missouri in the afternoon.

539
00:31:55.781 --> 00:32:00.100
I was going to do the show at night and then I was all excited.
I bought tickets,

540
00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:01.150
I was ready to go.

541
00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:05.530
And then when ended up happening was a Texas and Missouri were both for no,

542
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.010
and the flex scheduled moved the game to like eight o'clock at night or seven

543
00:32:09.011 --> 00:32:12.760
o'clock at night.
So not only did I not get to go to the game,
nobody showed up,

544
00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:18.000
nobody showed up to my fucking show.
And I'm so I finally got to go.
And,
um,

545
00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:23.260
I'd like to thank a Dudley from the Dudley and Bob show who hooked me up with,

546
00:32:23.261 --> 00:32:28.120
uh,
with some tickets and south by southwest festival.
They also a,

547
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:29.950
no,
sorry,
the Moontower festival.

548
00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:32.470
The Moontower festival also hooked me up with tickets.

549
00:32:32.471 --> 00:32:35.710
I ended up with more tickets than I needed and I was actually able to hook up

550
00:32:35.711 --> 00:32:40.190
with some,
some other friends that I've made in Austin.
And uh,

551
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:41.930
Oh man,
it was great dude.

552
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:46.850
And I got to thank Luke and all his friends for reaching out to me on Twitter

553
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:51.980
and I'm,
me and Versie showed up.
We drove up from San Antonio.
Right.

554
00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:56.750
Um,
oh do we have the best fucking time?
Drove up,

555
00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:00.500
got a small breakfast cause we knew this kid Luke was going to be smoking

556
00:33:00.501 --> 00:33:03.350
whatever the fuck he was going to be smoking.
And uh,

557
00:33:03.351 --> 00:33:07.570
we showed up at the tailgate,
you know,
threw some money in.

558
00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.110
We've brought some shit that we brought some biscuits in from uh,

559
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:14.520
the Czech Bakery,
um,
that I,

560
00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:17.540
it's somewhere,
it's near Waco,
Texas.
Whenever you go from the,

561
00:33:17.541 --> 00:33:20.810
if you have a drive Dallas to Austin or vice versa,
when you're on the,

562
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:24.020
I think it's,
is it the 35 of the 45,

563
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.400
whatever the one that's further left.
Do you looking at a map?
A,

564
00:33:29.401 --> 00:33:32.860
there's a place out there called the,
uh,
the check bakery and just,
I'm,

565
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:33.800
I'm going to describe it.

566
00:33:33.801 --> 00:33:37.070
Just fucking go in there and get yourself one of the breakfast sandwiches.

567
00:33:37.071 --> 00:33:40.460
It's fucking insane.
It's fucking insane.
Every time I'd drive down,

568
00:33:40.461 --> 00:33:42.470
then you walk in there and you're like,
I'm just going to get one.

569
00:33:42.471 --> 00:33:45.660
And then you walk in and next thing you know you're getting three and splitting

570
00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:49.730
a fourth one with whoever the fuck you're with and you hate yourself afterwards,

571
00:33:49.731 --> 00:33:53.900
but it's delicious.
So I bought a bunch of shit from there,
you know,

572
00:33:53.901 --> 00:33:56.390
some sauerkraut and biscuits and stuff to add to it.

573
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:59.710
And we showed up and there's two.
Luke was making,
uh,

574
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.830
he was smoking sausage wrapped and chicken wrapped in Bacon.

575
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:08.960
All right.
And then his side,
he had sweet potatoes with this,

576
00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:13.430
uh,
this butter that he made that had bourbon in it.

577
00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.940
And like brown sugar for the sweet potato studio.

578
00:34:17.941 --> 00:34:21.830
It was that butter on the potato.
I was joking when I was eating it,
I was like,

579
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.480
I feel like I'm like getting buzzed and I'm going to have a heart attack at the

580
00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:30.860
same time.
It's one of the greatest things I've ever tasted.

581
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:33.310
Death.
He actually had a hardy Coleslaw,

582
00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:35.600
has anything worse than the fucking Milky Shit.

583
00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.710
It's all water and down spilling into all the good food.
He had,

584
00:34:39.711 --> 00:34:41.870
the hardy kind fucking delicious.

585
00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:46.430
And then they had a peach cobbler that had a peach and cherry in it.
And um,

586
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:50.870
that it was fucking outstanding.
And I tried to pick a,
you know,

587
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:55.040
a couple of tips up on smoking meat and everything,
but he actually had a smoker.

588
00:34:55.041 --> 00:34:57.500
So that's completely different than the big green egg.

589
00:34:57.501 --> 00:35:01.570
My problem has been keeping the fire going.
So I actually had a,

590
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.880
a podcast listener reach out who has a big green egg,

591
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:08.720
was nice enough to send me a long email about some stuff.

592
00:35:08.721 --> 00:35:11.660
So I'm going to try to smoke some ribs on Wednesday,
you know,

593
00:35:11.661 --> 00:35:13.880
I'm just gonna keep doing it until I fucking get it down.
But anyway,

594
00:35:13.881 --> 00:35:18.090
so we met a bunch of people there and first he said the funniest fucking thing

595
00:35:18.091 --> 00:35:20.840
where he was standing there is we're as we're eating the food,

596
00:35:20.841 --> 00:35:23.060
it's like so good where like whisper and going,
oh my God,
dude,

597
00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:26.060
this is fucking unreal.
And verse,
he goes like,
he goes,
dude,

598
00:35:26.061 --> 00:35:30.800
I think people in the south are just inherently better at cookouts or barbecues,

599
00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:32.300
whatever you want.
And we would,

600
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.310
I was joking with one of the guys there was saying like,

601
00:35:34.311 --> 00:35:36.710
because of the fucking we'd grown up in the northeast,

602
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:41.260
we can only cook out for likes,
you know,
whatever,
five months,

603
00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.300
five and a half months out of the year.

604
00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:46.180
And then the rest of the time it's just too Goddamn,
uh,

605
00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:50.680
it's just too goddamn cold or the weather is just too fucking bad.

606
00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.460
So every year the south,
the people in the warmer clients just,

607
00:35:54.461 --> 00:35:57.280
they just increased the gap.
Um,

608
00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:01.750
but it was just fucking delicious.
Right.
And,

609
00:36:01.751 --> 00:36:05.980
uh,
so we ended up going to the game and,
uh,

610
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.840
I'm rooting for Texas of course.
And uh,
I got to tell you something,

611
00:36:10.841 --> 00:36:12.880
man.
I think I'm a fucking jinx.

612
00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:18.960
I just realized that since I started going to these big college games every

613
00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:21.440
year,
the home team has never won.

614
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:23.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

615
00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:26.400
<v 0>All right.
The last time it happened,
I went to a game.</v>

616
00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:30.900
I want you to a Georgia bulldog g game in like September with some cupcake game

617
00:36:30.901 --> 00:36:34.830
new,
I can't even remember who the fuck they played.
All right.
But since then,

618
00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:40.050
all right.
This year it was Texas.
Osu texted them,

619
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.380
I'll just name all the teams who they played the first teams.
The whole team.

620
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:47.220
All right.
Texas,
Osu,
fucking Osu Woods.

621
00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:52.290
All right.
Last year I went to Miami,
Florida state,

622
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:57.210
Florida state one.
The year before I went to Lsu.
Al?
No,
Lsu.

623
00:36:57.211 --> 00:37:00.240
Uh,
no,
no.
Texas a and M.
Alabama.

624
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:04.050
Alabama won the year before that I went to Lsu,
Alabama.

625
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.270
And how one again.

626
00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:11.350
And then the year before that I went to the cotton bowl,

627
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:16.150
which is neutral ground for the longhorns in Oklahoma.

628
00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:17.980
They played the Red River game there.

629
00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:23.730
I went to that game rooted for Texas bed on Texas and Oklahoma smoked him.

630
00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:30.380
So that is one,
two,
three,
four fives at five games.
I'm like,

631
00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:31.230
oh,
in five.

632
00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:32.573
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

633
00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.750
<v 0>So I got to break the streak.</v>

634
00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:38.050
I'm almost not going to say who the fuck I'm going to next year because,
oh,

635
00:37:38.051 --> 00:37:41.020
I got it.
No,
in a couple of weeks I'm going to Notre Dame,
USC,

636
00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:45.880
Notre Dame's the home team and I am rooting for Notre Dame.
All right,

637
00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:48.580
me and Voz with joking cause verse,
he's been to all those games with me.

638
00:37:48.581 --> 00:37:51.970
I was saying we're like that guy in the mush in a Bronx tale.

639
00:37:51.971 --> 00:37:56.971
So my apology to a all longhorn fans for going to that game and rooting for you

640
00:37:57.221 --> 00:38:02.020
guys.
And uh,
I'd like to some thank you letters from some cowboy fans.

641
00:38:02.021 --> 00:38:03.820
There would always shoe,
dude,
I gotta tell you,
man,

642
00:38:03.821 --> 00:38:06.400
that was such a brutal game to fucking watch and you could feel it.

643
00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:09.250
You could feel it was going to happen to Texas,

644
00:38:09.251 --> 00:38:12.610
won that game like six fucking times.
And then they lost it.

645
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:16.450
It was unreal,
man.
Every time they,
they,
they could put them away,

646
00:38:16.451 --> 00:38:19.960
they just let them back into the game and that final fucking play.

647
00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:23.250
I don't like making fun of college kids when they don't,
uh,

648
00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.200
when they fuck up cause they're not professionals yet.

649
00:38:26.201 --> 00:38:30.790
So I'm not gonna name any names,
but uh,
that last offensive play,

650
00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.480
I guess special teams play,

651
00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.740
they're literally should have been like Benny Hill music playing.
I,
it just,

652
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:40.180
all they had to do was kicked the ball away.
They still add to hold him.

653
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:42.880
You can't break it down to one fucking play.

654
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:47.440
I mean God knows that pass underneath was there for him all fucking day and they

655
00:38:47.441 --> 00:38:51.570
had no answer for it.
Um,
I don't know.

656
00:38:51.571 --> 00:38:54.430
You'd think if you score too defensive,
touchdowns in a game,

657
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.460
you're defense gave you 14 points,
you think you could win the fucking game.

658
00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.920
And they somehow,
in the end they hiked the ball,

659
00:38:59.921 --> 00:39:02.650
the punter dropped the ball and then he's running with the ball.

660
00:39:02.651 --> 00:39:05.830
He goes to kick it,
you know,
goes a mile in the air.

661
00:39:05.831 --> 00:39:09.280
But it only went like two yards before it went out of bounds.

662
00:39:09.281 --> 00:39:12.790
And at that point it looked like it was going to go into overtime.

663
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.811
And I was like,
well,

664
00:39:13.811 --> 00:39:16.810
at least maybe they still have a chance to at least win this game that they

665
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:20.590
already won six times in overtime.
And then that play happens.

666
00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:23.620
And Lsu got the ball.

667
00:39:23.621 --> 00:39:27.130
And I think they ran it like one time just to position it and then they just

668
00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:30.910
kick the fucking ball.
And,
uh,
I think that was it.

669
00:39:30.911 --> 00:39:33.370
Or maybe they kicked it off with one second left and it was over and it was

670
00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:37.090
fucking brutal.
But,
um,
but like I say,
Longhorn fans are great man.

671
00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:39.910
They weren't like,
uh,
you know,

672
00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:43.600
college fans at different man when Shit's not going well,
they're not as,

673
00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:47.620
at least at the stadium,
they act like class acts.
I didn't hear a lot of,
uh,

674
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.310
screaming about the coach or anything.
So anyway,

675
00:39:50.311 --> 00:39:55.240
so we ended up going back to the tailgate and,
uh,

676
00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.350
I forgot to tell you guys,
we had version,

677
00:39:57.390 --> 00:40:01.900
like just out of sheer boredom of driving four hours every fucking day.

678
00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:05.360
Uh,
we were,
uh,

679
00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:10.000
driving down from Dallas to San Antonio,
I think that day.

680
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:12.520
That was like a four and a half hour drive with the traffic and shit.

681
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.720
And we were trying to write a country song and uh,

682
00:40:16.721 --> 00:40:20.430
we came up with this country song,
uh,
we just say,
all right,
so what do you know,

683
00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.300
cause we are the car,
there was a bunch of country station,

684
00:40:22.301 --> 00:40:23.590
so we kept shutting off the radio.

685
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:27.310
We turn it or we turn the station and which had the sound down go to a new

686
00:40:27.311 --> 00:40:29.650
country station would be like,
all right,
what's this song about?

687
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:35.110
Is it about her heartache?
A country road or America?

688
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:37.810
And we just,
that was what we,
that's how we were killing time.

689
00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:40.150
So then just using that formula,

690
00:40:40.151 --> 00:40:44.110
we started writing this country song and we came up with,

691
00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:50.140
we came up with the chorus anyways,
have a country hit country song.

692
00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:54.430
Now granted we can't sink,
but if we got like Travis Tread or somebody,
you know,

693
00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:59.440
like uh,
you know,
with some sort of skills,
we think this could be a hit.

694
00:40:59.441 --> 00:41:03.680
So we came up with the sub,
basically went a man,
Rick,
of first,

695
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:08.130
every other places,
the worst,
ran a B in a foreign

696
00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:14.830
land to live in another,
a country that was basically the chorus.

697
00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.800
And we were writing it.
I know it's terrible,

698
00:41:20.801 --> 00:41:23.410
but we'll fuck you were driving four hours in the middle of the Texas.

699
00:41:23.411 --> 00:41:26.740
What are we going to do?
There's nothing to say.
He just walking,

700
00:41:26.741 --> 00:41:30.420
driving endlessly,
right?
So we were coming up,
well guy,

701
00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.670
now we could come up with the verses and we just like,
wait,

702
00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:37.490
she's been Paris and he's been to Rome and you been to London.

703
00:41:37.491 --> 00:41:41.780
But that ain't home to me.
I can't remember where we somehow get it.

704
00:41:41.781 --> 00:41:44.420
That's why I say a Marika first.

705
00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:48.500
Every other places worse.
That's where everyone plays his worst,

706
00:41:48.501 --> 00:41:51.650
not the worst first.
He kept getting on it.
So anyways,
so we,

707
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:55.700
we come out of the game and you know,
we're drunk right as you do.

708
00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:59.060
And uh,
we show back up at the tailgate,

709
00:41:59.061 --> 00:42:02.090
we say goodbye to Luke and all those guys.
And,
uh,
we get our,

710
00:42:02.091 --> 00:42:04.730
of our cigars and we couple of drinks.

711
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:08.030
So now we're standing there and we don't have a ride back cause we kept it over

712
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.380
and we're both old men.

713
00:42:09.381 --> 00:42:14.090
So neither one of us has the fucking Uber App on our,

714
00:42:14.091 --> 00:42:18.500
uh,
on our phones.
And there's like no taxis left.

715
00:42:18.501 --> 00:42:22.280
So it just sort of stranded at the ut campus,

716
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.940
just laughing,
smoking cigars in his people will walk in,

717
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:29.510
buy versus starts telling them,
hey,
hey,
excuse me,
excuse me.
Uh,

718
00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:33.320
me and my buddy here,
we've got a number one country song on iTunes.

719
00:42:33.321 --> 00:42:34.430
We're really excited about it.

720
00:42:34.431 --> 00:42:36.950
We're just trying to get a little word of mouth going because the numbers are

721
00:42:36.951 --> 00:42:41.330
going down.
Would it be okay if we sing the chorus to you?
Right?
And I'm thinking,

722
00:42:41.331 --> 00:42:44.090
what the fuck is he doing?
But he did it.
So my God,
we got to do it.

723
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.930
So it'd be like groups of like,
you know,
four or five people.
He's ut girls.

724
00:42:47.931 --> 00:42:50.000
Then we were sitting there,
hammered with cigars,

725
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:55.750
totally committed going Eric the first and immediately they'd have a worried

726
00:42:56.451 --> 00:42:57.530
look on their face heavy.

727
00:42:57.531 --> 00:43:01.760
I love plays is worst rather being a fuck and hers.

728
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:06.800
And then we get to the end to live in another country and we'd go country.

729
00:43:06.801 --> 00:43:10.550
You had to bring your chin down to your chest and then you brought it up.

730
00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:16.460
That was,
it was either that part would make us laugh or the FEC and hers.
Um,

731
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:21.140
and we bombed with it,
man.
These girls would just walking away,

732
00:43:21.141 --> 00:43:24.860
shaking their heads or just laughing.
And uh,

733
00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:29.480
then there was this one dude walked by men.
This guy was fucking hilarious.

734
00:43:29.481 --> 00:43:34.100
He came walking by,
he's by himself,
he's Latino too,
right?

735
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.530
Big Guy.
And he's like,
ah,
man.
He goes,
don't listen to that.

736
00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:39.890
And he takes his headphones off and we start singing it and he immediately gets

737
00:43:39.891 --> 00:43:44.570
a smirk on his face and then we start laughing.
And then all three,

738
00:43:44.571 --> 00:43:46.520
it was just great.
All three of us for laughing.

739
00:43:46.521 --> 00:43:50.930
And he couldn't tell if he was serious.
He just knew it was fucking stupid.
Um,

740
00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:53.570
I was probably one of my favorite times of the trip.

741
00:43:53.571 --> 00:43:58.571
And then finally this absolute fucking sweetheart stopped and she was so nice

742
00:43:58.611 --> 00:44:01.340
and we sang the whole thing.
I actually felt bad about cursing.

743
00:44:01.341 --> 00:44:04.880
That's how nice she was.
And then like as we were singing it,

744
00:44:04.881 --> 00:44:09.270
like three times she went,
oh,
oh.

745
00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:14.270
Like it was nice.
She was so nice.

746
00:44:14.271 --> 00:44:18.170
And the other thing she just goes like,
oh no,
that was good.
It was good.
You know,

747
00:44:18.171 --> 00:44:20.250
we found out,
I go,
what do you do for a living?
You know it,

748
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:25.120
I swear to God she was a social worker,
so he just was a big hearted,

749
00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:30.080
encouraging person.
She was so like fucking such as sweetheart.

750
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:32.920
We were like standing on the other side of like this little stone wall.

751
00:44:32.921 --> 00:44:33.900
So we wouldn't freak out.
You know,

752
00:44:33.901 --> 00:44:37.530
a couple of guys standing in a wooded area going,
hey ladies,

753
00:44:37.531 --> 00:44:39.660
ladies is kind of creepy at night.

754
00:44:39.661 --> 00:44:42.570
So we were on the other side of a wall to get a little bit of a barrier so we

755
00:44:42.571 --> 00:44:45.570
could get people to actually stop versus he actually walked around and she was

756
00:44:45.571 --> 00:44:48.390
such a sweetheart.
He walked around to the other side of the wall.

757
00:44:48.391 --> 00:44:52.650
And gave her a hug.
Um,
anyway,
so,

758
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:54.360
so that's what we did,

759
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:58.590
you know that was Texas and then I went on to a Marika first.

760
00:44:58.591 --> 00:44:59.400
It's going to be in your head.

761
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.130
I'm telling you somebody out there with some talent,
man.

762
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.640
Trying to think of some of the other lyrics we came up with.

763
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:07.160
<v 1>Okay.</v>

764
00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.260
<v 0>Or something like I like,</v>

765
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:09.910
<v 1>okay.</v>

766
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:14.430
<v 0>Pickup trucks in pony tails,
shooting fuzzy queries.</v>

767
00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:18.490
No shooting.
Little Curtis with fuzzy tails

768
00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:24.540
sitting in a tree for covering in day or your run.

769
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:28.760
I can't remember how it goes.
We read every thing we would come up with.
Uh,

770
00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:31.970
whatever we were killing a fucking drive.
What do you want from it?

771
00:45:31.971 --> 00:45:35.040
But if you don't,
if you guys want to flush that thing out,
I don't keep up.

772
00:45:35.041 --> 00:45:36.960
I what?
I know what I'm talking about anymore.
Um,

773
00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:42.360
can you tell him also reading right now so easily.
I get fucking distracted.

774
00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.400
So have I talked to NFL football yet?

775
00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.460
But did you do to do the bad at that?

776
00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:51.423
<v 2>Good.</v>

777
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:56.870
<v 0>Where did I take the day?
Shocking.
Shocking,
shocking.</v>

778
00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.320
New England patriots.
I caught the end of the game.
Uh,

779
00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:04.000
miss the entire fucking game.
As always.
I miss the whole fucking gay.

780
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.960
I was flying up to Toronto,
so,
uh,

781
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:11.970
I was hilarious when I landed.
I get my,
uh,
the guy picking me up,
right.

782
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:16.070
I jump in,
I'm going to go on.
I can't go,
hey man,
I didn't realize it was sun ago.

783
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.440
Did you guys get an NFL football up here?
And he was like,
what?

784
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:24.630
I go NFL football,
you know,
like patriots,
cowboys,

785
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:25.471
Steelers,

786
00:46:25.471 --> 00:46:29.160
you get American football up here and he's looking at me in a rear view mirror

787
00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:31.110
and he just goes,
no,

788
00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:37.940
I just start laughing.
I'm like,
God man,
I forget it.

789
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:41.000
But when I got to my hotel room,
they had it on.

790
00:46:41.001 --> 00:46:43.940
I actually had the buffalo bills network cause I was in Toronto,

791
00:46:43.941 --> 00:46:47.870
which was really cool seeing that local shows and that type of thing and seeing

792
00:46:47.871 --> 00:46:52.730
them all wanting to,
you know,
rebound from the heartache and loss to,
uh,

793
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.540
to the Patriots and Jesus Christ.
Did they ever,

794
00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:59.000
oh my God,

795
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:05.130
they absolutely fucking raped the dolphins yesterday and,

796
00:47:05.131 --> 00:47:08.970
um,
as did the patriots with the Jaguars.

797
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:14.040
So,
uh,
like I said,
man,
we play them again.

798
00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:17.400
I'm still calling it man.
I still think that that could go a,

799
00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:19.890
I dunno for some reason,
I just think if,

800
00:47:19.891 --> 00:47:23.490
if you have a good defense and then if you play a team two times in a year,

801
00:47:23.491 --> 00:47:27.780
you usually split.
It would really be great to beat Rex Ryan twice.

802
00:47:27.781 --> 00:47:29.740
So then you don't have to listen to them talk shit again.

803
00:47:29.741 --> 00:47:31.060
But that's what makes some great though.

804
00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.460
The fact that even though he has a mediocre team,

805
00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:35.650
I'm still worried about beating him as like,

806
00:47:35.651 --> 00:47:39.650
we gotta beat this guy so he doesn't talk a bunch of Shit.
Um,

807
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:45.160
he's fucking great.
He's like a one man,
a promotional team there.

808
00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:50.130
But,
um,
I didn't watch many other games.
I,
uh,
by then I had to go out and,
um,

809
00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:55.910
go do my show.
I caught a little bit of the late game,
uh,

810
00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:59.650
the Sunday night game,
or did I,
I can't even fucking remember,

811
00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:03.520
but I wish I had watched the cowboy's game that looked like that was a hell of a

812
00:48:03.521 --> 00:48:06.280
game.
Uh,
but I pretty much missed everything.
So,
uh,

813
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:09.080
I think I got to go in the NFL network and try to watch him shit.

814
00:48:09.081 --> 00:48:11.480
But I'm definitely going to be watching,
um,

815
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:15.880
the Monday night game tonight and I ain't going out.
I'm not doing shit.

816
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:17.260
I'm wiped out.

817
00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:21.790
ACDC is playing tonight at Dodger Stadium and,
uh,

818
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.130
if I get a second wind,

819
00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:26.440
I'm going to go out there and I know what you guys are think bill,

820
00:48:26.441 --> 00:48:30.160
how the fuck can you not go at least go get some nosebleed seats for that.

821
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:33.760
And I've just been on the road for 15 fucking days,
drinking,

822
00:48:33.761 --> 00:48:36.130
smoking cigars and all that Shit and uh,

823
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:38.920
I'm completely fucking white out.

824
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:43.990
I've seen them a bunch of times and I know that this isn't the last fucking
tour.

825
00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:47.110
You know what it is,
dude,
I fucked up.

826
00:48:47.111 --> 00:48:50.770
I didn't get tickets and I hate myself right now because I'm not going and it's

827
00:48:50.771 --> 00:48:53.620
going to crush me that they're going to play and I'm going to miss.

828
00:48:53.621 --> 00:48:56.020
And I'm terrified that this is the last time they're going to go.

829
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:57.940
And I know that I'm going to regret that.

830
00:48:57.941 --> 00:49:01.360
I'm not going to go tonight cause I'm fucking wiped out there.
That's the truth.

831
00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:06.120
All right.
Before you jump all over me.
All right,
let's get into some of the,
uh,

832
00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:11.410
questions here for this week.
Uh,
rugby World Cup.
You know,

833
00:49:11.411 --> 00:49:13.810
everybody keeps talking to me about this in Japan winning.

834
00:49:13.811 --> 00:49:18.220
I really feel like I missed out on something,
man.
It sounded amazing.
Bay Bill,

835
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:21.490
a deer billion burn person.
How they hell are you?

836
00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:26.050
I'm good cause he wrote me to uh,
anyway,
uh,

837
00:49:26.051 --> 00:49:31.051
I don't know if it's getting a much time on sports center,

838
00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.540
but the Rugby World Cup is on in England at the moment.

839
00:49:34.541 --> 00:49:37.870
The USA are playing Scotland as I write this and winning,

840
00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:43.060
although probably not for long.
Uh,
just Jesus Christ.
What do they make per game

841
00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:48.520
to fucking knock their brains out though?
You,
I've talked about the USA team.

842
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.680
Um,
I'm a huge fucking fan of rugby and uh,

843
00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.170
I got to tell you two sports that I kind of make fun of,

844
00:49:56.171 --> 00:50:00.190
that I'm actually starting to get into.
I find myself trying to fight it,

845
00:50:00.191 --> 00:50:03.760
but if it comes on TV,
I'm watching it.
Soccer and golf,

846
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:09.550
they sucking me in.
Uh,
just wondering what you know and,
or think about the game.

847
00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:10.960
I think it'd be right up your alley.

848
00:50:10.961 --> 00:50:14.500
Big Guys beating the hell out of each other to move a ball to the other end of

849
00:50:14.501 --> 00:50:18.220
the pitch.
There are rules,
but that,
uh,
that's the guts of it.

850
00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:22.090
I like to hear your thoughts.
Thanks for doing your job.
Uh,
I benefit from it.
Oh,

851
00:50:22.091 --> 00:50:24.580
thank you.
Um,
any rates to go fuck yourself.
Um,

852
00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:28.860
I absolutely love watching rugby when I'm in Europe or if I'm in a country that

853
00:50:28.861 --> 00:50:32.280
supports it.
The,
I don't know what it is.
Just the announcers.

854
00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:35.850
You can hear it in their voice.
It means something.
You hear the crowd.
It's just,

855
00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:40.630
um,
it's just something about being over there.
I mean,
I,

856
00:50:40.631 --> 00:50:42.540
I would become the biggest fucking,

857
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:46.050
I'm going to keep calling it soccer so American listeners don't get confused

858
00:50:46.051 --> 00:50:47.830
with the football thing.
Um,

859
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:51.450
and please can somebody for the love of God not ask me again why American

860
00:50:51.451 --> 00:50:54.120
football is called football.
You barely kick it with your foot.

861
00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:59.450
I've told you why a long time ago we figured out that your football is fucking

862
00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.170
excrutiatingly boring.

863
00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:04.620
And then if you picked it up and added some violence to it,
you know what I mean?

864
00:51:04.621 --> 00:51:05.830
We do everything on 10

865
00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:07.373
<v 2>you know,</v>

866
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:12.900
<v 0>just fucking with you.
No.
When I'm over in England,</v>

867
00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:16.350
like in those premier league games,
come on,
I really get into it.

868
00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:19.860
It's fucking great.
How can you not?

869
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:20.770
<v 2>Okay.</v>

870
00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:24.280
<v 0>From in England,
it's fucking cold out.
I'm in a pub,</v>

871
00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:27.700
I'm drinking a beer and everybody's going nuts and they were riveted watching

872
00:51:27.701 --> 00:51:31.390
the shit.
It is impossible not to get sucked into it.
And I have to tell you,

873
00:51:31.391 --> 00:51:35.740
I am fascinated by people who don't give a fuck about sports.

874
00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:40.150
Fascinated and envious of like,
God,
what do you do with all that free time?

875
00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:41.370
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

876
00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:46.320
<v 0>I'll kill a whole fucking Sunday,
but it up,
but at that
right,</v>

877
00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:47.910
but the end of the fucking day,

878
00:51:47.911 --> 00:51:50.670
I'm sitting there like Eddie Murphy in the clumps.
Remember the outtake,
what?

879
00:51:50.671 --> 00:51:52.380
He had the ice cream porn out of his fucking,

880
00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:55.740
at least what are you going to coming out of his bottom lip?

881
00:51:55.741 --> 00:51:57.870
That's what the fuck I look like by the end of the day.

882
00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:01.780
And I do it again the next Sunday if I'm not flying to Toronto.
Um,

883
00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:05.550
I think rugby is the shit.
I think Australian rules,
football is the shit.

884
00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:09.570
And I think soccer,
football,
let me be respectful to the rest of the world.

885
00:52:09.571 --> 00:52:13.170
I think all of it's the shit.
All of it's great man.
Sports are awesome.

886
00:52:13.171 --> 00:52:16.170
I don't have a problem with any of it.
And if it's violent,

887
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:18.690
it's fucking maniacs running around.

888
00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:24.240
My only real complaint because I really do think soccer is a beautiful sport.

889
00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:26.610
Uh,
my complaint is,
is the diving,

890
00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:31.080
and I actually at this point prefer women's soccer because they go down and they

891
00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:33.960
get right back up.
You know that fucking men about it.

892
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:39.210
<v 2>All right friend fucking up.
Dear Bill,</v>

893
00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:44.780
<v 0>my 26 year old friend in my opinion,
is in deep with a lady.</v>

894
00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:48.880
Uh,
she's around 30 with three kids.
Oh Jesus.

895
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:53.320
And is recently divorced.
Good Lord Dude.

896
00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:55.140
<v 2>Okay.</v>

897
00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:58.860
<v 0>Is he wearing like a weighted vest just walking around too to add even more</v>

898
00:52:58.861 --> 00:53:03.300
difficulty to his fucking day.
Ah,
they've only been together for a few months,

899
00:53:03.301 --> 00:53:07.410
but he's already got car seats and shit in his cars to tote these heathens

900
00:53:07.411 --> 00:53:10.920
around.
He's not what I would call a ladies man.

901
00:53:10.921 --> 00:53:12.810
So anytime he gets into a relationship,

902
00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.440
he falls in love quick and you know what the world needs dopes too.

903
00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.600
You can't help him.
He said,

904
00:53:18.601 --> 00:53:22.320
my concern is that he's going to end up playing daddy to three kids that aren't

905
00:53:22.321 --> 00:53:26.790
his for the rest of his life,
which in my opinion,
like a God damn nightmare.

906
00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:30.930
While those kids also need a father,
he's doing something really admirable.

907
00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:34.620
But if he's doing it for the right fucking reason,
it's admirable.

908
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:38.370
If he's just a fucking dope with low self esteem,

909
00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.320
you got to pull him out of this man.

910
00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:42.363
<v 2>You know,</v>

911
00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:48.670
<v 0>you got to walk up to those fuck his fucking car and punch out the side windows</v>

912
00:53:48.671 --> 00:53:52.360
like the terminator did to the windshield and you throw those car seats over the

913
00:53:52.361 --> 00:53:56.680
fucking guardrail.
All right.
No,
I'm not saying to do that.
All right.

914
00:53:57.430 --> 00:54:02.250
Anyways,
um,
my question is do I talk to the kid and let them know that the,

915
00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:05.800
that all of his friends think he's going down the wrong path here.

916
00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.040
He's the kind of guy who doesn't handle those talks very well.

917
00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:11.110
So I could see him going ballistic.

918
00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:15.640
Should I let them know or should I let him crash and burn one way or the other

919
00:54:15.641 --> 00:54:16.031
with this?

920
00:54:16.031 --> 00:54:21.031
I realized watching this train work for the foreseeable future makes me a shitty

921
00:54:21.611 --> 00:54:26.230
friend,
but as a,
but as guys,
these conversations suck Dick,
uh,

922
00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:29.440
listen to,
you know,
he needs to grow up,
man.

923
00:54:29.441 --> 00:54:32.170
If he can't handle constructive criticism,
if you just say,
look,

924
00:54:32.171 --> 00:54:34.720
I'm just looking out for you.
All right,

925
00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:40.440
you're going to go from being a single man with all the options in the world to

926
00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:45.790
a,
a committed man with three kids instantly.

927
00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:47.953
<v 2>MMM,</v>

928
00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:52.940
<v 0>it's,
this is what you want to,
I dunno.
Maybe that'll drive them further into it.</v>

929
00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:55.760
I mean,
I,
and I also think that a lot of reasons why,

930
00:54:55.820 --> 00:55:00.320
like he doesn't do well with those conversations is because if he is somebody

931
00:55:00.321 --> 00:55:04.730
that just kind of gets into something and gets trapped in something and doesn't

932
00:55:04.731 --> 00:55:07.850
know how to express himself,
that usually adds to a lot of anger.

933
00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:12.710
How do I know this?
Because I've been that guy.
Um,
I was

934
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.220
<v 2>okay,</v>

935
00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:18.570
<v 0>very like,
uh,
withdrawn.
If anybody said hello to me,</v>

936
00:55:18.571 --> 00:55:22.110
then I was friends with them and I,
there was no asking what I wanted,

937
00:55:22.111 --> 00:55:23.640
what I needed,
what I was looking for.

938
00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:26.220
I didn't figure that out to very late in life,

939
00:55:26.221 --> 00:55:28.320
which is probably why I didn't get married till I was 45,

940
00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:30.390
but at least I wasn't dumb enough to get a

941
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:31.900
<v 2>yeah.</v>

942
00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:35.890
<v 0>To,
to,
uh,
get married to someone that I,
I wasn't,
I always knew enough to be like,</v>

943
00:55:35.891 --> 00:55:39.070
all right,
I got to get out of this.
But I,
I was not good at that at all.

944
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:40.510
And that was a very angry guy.

945
00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:42.490
<v 2>Um,
I dunno,</v>

946
00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:47.320
<v 0>I don't know what his deal is or his psychological fucking backgrounds.</v>

947
00:55:47.321 --> 00:55:49.600
You've got an overbearing father.
I have no fucking idea.

948
00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:52.680
I'm not doctor Phil or Johnny Weissmuller here.

949
00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:55.750
Wherever the fuck I'm supposed to use as the rest of the reference.
But um,

950
00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:57.270
<v 2>okay.</v>

951
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:59.910
<v 0>You know,
why does Johnny Weissmuller sound like a doctor?</v>

952
00:55:59.911 --> 00:56:04.650
He's the actor who played Tarzan,
by the way.
Um,
anyways.
All right,
asking.

953
00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:08.040
So I would just say,
uh,
you know what dude,
dude,
fuck his moodiness.

954
00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:11.160
Fucking baby.
Just tell him what you think.

955
00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:13.483
<v 2>You know,</v>

956
00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:16.690
<v 0>just sit down and just say,
listen man,
as a friend,</v>

957
00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:19.660
I have to say my piece on this thing.
All right?

958
00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:21.710
<v 2>Uh,</v>

959
00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:23.670
<v 0>I just want to make sure that you,</v>

960
00:56:23.671 --> 00:56:27.010
you know what you're doing here because you are taking on an unbelievable

961
00:56:27.011 --> 00:56:32.011
responsibility and you are effectively ending your youth immediately dealing

962
00:56:32.291 --> 00:56:36.250
with this woman and these three fucking kids then mean it's one thing to get

963
00:56:36.251 --> 00:56:40.060
married,
have a kid,
you know,
fall in love,
get married,
right?

964
00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:43.900
And then have a kid and you deal with that.
Then you have another kid,

965
00:56:43.901 --> 00:56:48.340
you deal with that you're just going,
Bam,
married kids.

966
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:52.660
Three kids got to pick them up to daycare and whatever.
It's like,
yeah,

967
00:56:52.661 --> 00:56:53.650
you don't need to do that.

968
00:56:53.651 --> 00:56:55.760
And I know there's a lot of people out there with divorced,
with kids.

969
00:56:55.761 --> 00:56:58.240
That probably annoys me right now.
But you know what?
I don't give a fuck.

970
00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:03.430
This isn't about you.
This is about a man.
It was 26 years old who?

971
00:57:03.431 --> 00:57:07.270
He's got the world at his fucking feet,
all right?

972
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:10.780
If this is what he wants,
it fits what he wants.
She got to support it.

973
00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:15.700
But if he's being a fucking dope,
say your piece so you don't have to feel bad.

974
00:57:15.930 --> 00:57:16.750
All right?

975
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:19.210
And then later when he talks to you about it and he's going to have to say like,

976
00:57:19.211 --> 00:57:21.700
you know what dude,
you are right.
And He'd be like,
you know what?
It's alright.

977
00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:26.860
It's alright.
You can crash on my couch.
All right.

978
00:57:26.861 --> 00:57:31.840
Asking older girl out.
Hey Billy,
fat,
tits.
Hey,
fuck you man.

979
00:57:31.841 --> 00:57:36.370
I'm in shape now.
I just wanted to say a,
you've encouraged me to lose 30 times,

980
00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:39.760
30 pounds now since you began,
uh,
I did as well,

981
00:57:39.761 --> 00:57:43.900
but still have a few months ago to this fucking great.
It's great,
man.

982
00:57:43.901 --> 00:57:48.880
Good for you.
Keep it going.
Uh,
anyway.
Anyway,
to the question,

983
00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:53.170
I'm 23 and the girl I'm thinking about asking out is 34.

984
00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:54.820
I feel like this may be one,

985
00:57:55.180 --> 00:58:00.180
maybe the one if she's perhaps said yes because we clicked so perfectly when we

986
00:58:00.821 --> 00:58:05.710
are together and when does age become a factor?
Well,

987
00:58:05.711 --> 00:58:07.690
she's 34.
If she wants to have kids,

988
00:58:07.691 --> 00:58:11.410
I would think that age is going to be affected pretty soon.
Uh,

989
00:58:11.411 --> 00:58:15.340
or should I just move on and try to find someone around my age?
By the way,

990
00:58:15.341 --> 00:58:18.580
a great drama did checkout is Marco Miniman.
Uh,
yeah,

991
00:58:18.581 --> 00:58:21.340
I've definitely seen all his stuff.
That guy is insane.
He goes,

992
00:58:21.341 --> 00:58:22.510
I saw him a while back at it.

993
00:58:22.511 --> 00:58:26.050
Joe Satriani concent and thought it was the greatest drumming I've ever seen.

994
00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:28.870
Anyway,
keep up the podcast and go fuck yourself.
Yeah,

995
00:58:28.871 --> 00:58:32.530
that's the kind of guy he can like do a drum solo to like,
you can give a,

996
00:58:32.531 --> 00:58:35.950
an excerpt of this paragraph and the way my voice goes up and down.

997
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:38.560
He would voice it on the drums.
He's one of those guys,
man.
He's like,

998
00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:43.510
he's like from another planet.
Um,
quick call,
by the way.
Ah,

999
00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:47.470
you're 23 and she's 34.
Uh,
my gut says,
yeah,
don't do it.

1000
00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:52.750
Don't do it.
23,
dude,
you're in the prime of your fucking life.

1001
00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:56.810
I would get a woman who was my fucking,
if somebody 34,

1002
00:58:57.130 --> 00:58:59.440
we're probably going to get married pretty soon.
You're 23.

1003
00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:01.450
You don't need that Shit,
right?

1004
00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:06.110
Get yourself a fucking Philly 23 years old,
dude,

1005
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:09.940
you're drafted in the first round and you're going to trade down to the six

1006
00:59:09.941 --> 00:59:11.140
round.
Fuck that.

1007
00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:13.750
And I know there's a lot of women that are going to listen to me and say that

1008
00:59:13.751 --> 00:59:17.050
that's bullshit,
but fuck you.
Because women do that to other women.

1009
00:59:17.051 --> 00:59:19.940
You guys give each other advice like that on your show.
So,
well,

1010
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:22.000
when am I going to do,
because women's issues,

1011
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:25.240
I'm going to give a 23 year old guy,
bad advice,
dude.
Fuck that.

1012
00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:27.940
She's 11 fucking years old and then you,

1013
00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:30.370
she's going to be in a completely different place.

1014
00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:34.510
Women are way more mature than guys.
Are you going to be like a fucking kid?

1015
00:59:34.850 --> 00:59:39.670
All right.
And she's going to be so fucking advanced as far as you know,

1016
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:42.670
haven't been in relationships too.

1017
00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:44.830
You're going to give up so much goddamn territory.

1018
00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:48.700
My Gut says don't fucking do it.
They'll fucking do that,
dude.

1019
00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:50.973
<v 1>Don't do that.</v>

1020
00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:52.930
<v 0>All right.</v>

1021
00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:56.560
When you're 43 and you still P90x and she's going to be 54 going through

1022
00:59:56.561 --> 01:00:00.280
menopause.
All right.
I'm just saying this is harsh,
but you know what?

1023
01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.060
I wouldn't be a fucking,
uh,
I wouldn't be honest if I wouldn't be,

1024
01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:08.680
if I wasn't saying this all right now if you keep,
but I'm not saying it's wrong.

1025
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:13.090
I'm just saying.
All right.
My Gut says,
when I look at those numbers,
you know,

1026
01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:18.880
we don't have a deal here.
This isn't a good fucking trade.
Um,

1027
01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:21.130
but having said that,
good luck to you.

1028
01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:29.440
All right.
Uh,
shit jokes.
All right.
What's up?

1029
01:00:29.441 --> 01:00:32.020
Their sizzle Nutso.
Ah,
yeah.
Uh,

1030
01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:36.700
been listening to your podcast around four years now and you often make a

1031
01:00:36.701 --> 01:00:40.420
negative reference reference to shit jokes.
As a kid,

1032
01:00:40.421 --> 01:00:42.490
I always laughed at Shit and fart jokes.

1033
01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:46.710
And now in my thirties I still think they are funny.
Uh,

1034
01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.170
why are they frowned upon?
And do you have any good ones?

1035
01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:55.530
Is it just you or does the entire industry not take the jokes as being credible?

1036
01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.630
Also,
you suck at the Internet.

1037
01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:03.460
Last week you gave your mom podcast email address when telling people where to

1038
01:01:03.461 --> 01:01:08.461
send their questions and you said it's bill@thecapitalmcapitalmpodcast.com email

1039
01:01:10.211 --> 01:01:15.211
addresses in web website addresses are not case sensitive chief,

1040
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:19.680
thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
Okay.
You,
you know,

1041
01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:23.020
it's fucking hilarious how young people think that computers are cool.

1042
01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:27.610
I just don't understand what,
what is so awesome about these fucking things?

1043
01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:29.800
It just,
what?
You know what it is,

1044
01:01:29.801 --> 01:01:34.801
what you give up in your free time and in money and that this a fucking camera

1045
01:01:34.871 --> 01:01:38.050
and God knows who's on the other end of it and you have to like put a piece of

1046
01:01:38.051 --> 01:01:40.480
tape over it.
You know what I mean?
Who knows?

1047
01:01:40.481 --> 01:01:43.750
If you fucking laptops open and you're their fucking,
you're a woman.

1048
01:01:43.751 --> 01:01:47.670
And there's some Guy Watch it,
you know,
Eh,

1049
01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:50.590
jerking off somewhere,
another part of the country.
It's just,

1050
01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:55.090
it's fucking bizarre.
That's the forest.

1051
01:01:55.091 --> 01:01:55.811
One of the funniest thing,

1052
01:01:55.811 --> 01:01:59.950
email addresses and website address or not case sensitive chief.

1053
01:02:00.310 --> 01:02:04.930
Did you flip you little fucking hair after you type that you cunt?
Um,
all right.

1054
01:02:04.931 --> 01:02:08.530
Shit jokes and fart jokes.
Uh,
they're considered sophomores,

1055
01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:12.370
bodily fluid jokes and that type of thing.
I don't completely write them off.

1056
01:02:12.371 --> 01:02:15.340
It's just me just being self deprecating,
just joking around.
Oh,

1057
01:02:15.341 --> 01:02:18.370
what you look at that,
would you look at that?
And I got a text message.

1058
01:02:18.371 --> 01:02:22.140
I really needed know that while I'm doing a podcast,
you fucking apple conch,

1059
01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:27.100
um,
put the mute button on at least.
Um,
anyways,

1060
01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:29.980
uh,
so that's what it looked at.
I have to be honest with you,
man.

1061
01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:33.580
I love this shit joke.
I love a Fart joke.
If it's a good one,
you know,

1062
01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:39.100
if somebody is just up there,
so I'm fucking wiping my ass and club,
you know,

1063
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:40.750
not saying anything.
Then like,

1064
01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:45.460
I think what happened was with the oversaturation of comics during the eighties

1065
01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:47.710
comedy boom.
Um,

1066
01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:49.870
<v 2>okay.</v>

1067
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:53.470
<v 0>You know,
there was,
there was material that just everybody was doing.</v>

1068
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.470
It was just easy.
Laughs cause I think maybe that's what it is,

1069
01:02:57.070 --> 01:03:00.280
is if you do a shit joke,
it's gone.
It's going to get a laugh.
There's no way.

1070
01:03:00.281 --> 01:03:00.881
There's just,

1071
01:03:00.881 --> 01:03:04.740
it's practically impossible to do with shit joke and not get a laugh to get us

1072
01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:08.740
to do a fart joke and not get a laugh.
So,
um,

1073
01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:12.040
it's considered like low hanging fruit.
Having said that,

1074
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:17.080
I don't think there's anything wrong with low hanging fruit.
Like,
you know,

1075
01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:21.490
I'm a big fan of fucking movies and I love a movie that's trying to do something

1076
01:03:21.491 --> 01:03:23.770
different.
But if there's one that's just,
you know,

1077
01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:27.460
one of those tough guy movies and just write down the pike,
nothing fucking new,

1078
01:03:27.461 --> 01:03:28.480
but it's done well.

1079
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:32.500
And their attitude is not that we're doing something different here that just

1080
01:03:32.501 --> 01:03:34.000
like,
we're just going to make one of these movies.

1081
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.980
I don't have a fucking problem with it.
So,
um,
you know,

1082
01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:41.530
if a comics on stage doing a shit joke,
if it's funny,

1083
01:03:41.531 --> 01:03:45.520
I don't give a fuck if it's easy.
I don't give a shit if it's fucking funny.

1084
01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:49.060
It's funny.
So,
uh,
but the reason why I use it as a reference like shit,

1085
01:03:49.061 --> 01:03:52.240
Dick Jokes is a,
it's just sort of,
um,

1086
01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:56.080
just a self deprecating thing.
That's all.
That's all I'm trying to do.
All right,

1087
01:03:56.081 --> 01:03:59.620
gang spill.
If you were in a gang,
what would your surrounding theme,

1088
01:03:59.621 --> 01:04:03.430
B I e motorcycles,
gangs involve writing.

1089
01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:08.050
Would you be in a comedy gang?
Uh,
New England sports fan gang?
Uh,

1090
01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.460
definitely more like the latter.

1091
01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:14.030
It would definitely be more like fantasy football,
nerd gang.
I'm,
I'm,

1092
01:04:14.031 --> 01:04:18.370
I'm all right if you,
on one end of the spectrum is absolute,

1093
01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:23.170
a total rebels,
motorcycle gangs.

1094
01:04:23.171 --> 01:04:25.420
And then the other side is fantasy football.

1095
01:04:26.170 --> 01:04:30.790
I am somewhere between those way more towards the fantasy football thing.

1096
01:04:30.850 --> 01:04:35.470
I am a,
I ain't no tough guy,
right?
I'm not trying to go to jail.

1097
01:04:35.770 --> 01:04:38.260
I don't need any of that shit.
And you know what,
I don't want to do anything.

1098
01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:41.570
You know,
I don't be involved in violence.

1099
01:04:42.830 --> 01:04:43.860
I just don't,

1100
01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:48.470
they want to explore that part of me and I don't want it done to me.
Um,

1101
01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:53.820
to fuck gang.
Would I be good?
I Dunno.

1102
01:04:53.830 --> 01:04:57.670
I don't think I could be in a gang that actually called itself a gang unless it

1103
01:04:57.671 --> 01:05:02.260
was making fun of itself.
How about enthusiast?

1104
01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:09.350
Oh God,
they all of that is too hard.
How about I go to a hobby?
Hobby town places.

1105
01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:11.810
You know what this whole question is giving me Deuce chills.

1106
01:05:11.811 --> 01:05:13.340
Congratulations to your dues shells.

1107
01:05:13.341 --> 01:05:16.240
I always give credit to the opiate Anthony show.
Uh,

1108
01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:18.670
the late great opion Anthony show.
Um,

1109
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.790
when I fucking say that cause that's where I learned the term.

1110
01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:25.180
I never heard anybody else say it.
Was it.
Oop.
Who came up with that?

1111
01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:30.460
I have no idea.
I got a call or an opiate.
Jimmy.
Oh cheats.
You see a stamps.com.

1112
01:05:30.461 --> 01:05:35.461
Everybody your to do list can seem out of control so much to do.

1113
01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:38.470
So little time,
but there's only one thing you can,

1114
01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:42.220

if you'd like to donate,

She'd like to donate to this podcast.
Uh,

1135
01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:53.830
click on the march page,

That'll take you there.

1136
01:06:53.831 --> 01:06:58.060
I get credit for driving traffic there and whatever,
uh,
anything you buy there,

1137
01:06:58.061 --> 01:07:02.450
they kicked me a little dough for,
uh,
you know,

1138
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:06.790
for driving traffic there.
And then,
um,
then I send my,
you know,

1139
01:07:06.791 --> 01:07:11.200
I sent 10% of that to a charity that seems like it's on the level right now.

1140
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:14.260
I'm doing the Saint Jude Hospital.
I always say what charities,

1141
01:07:14.261 --> 01:07:16.720
just to make sure if they are a scam,

1142
01:07:16.721 --> 01:07:19.960
people can let me know cause I don't know how to figure out whether they are or

1143
01:07:19.961 --> 01:07:21.520
not.
I know people said,
Oh,

1144
01:07:21.521 --> 01:07:25.390
here's a website and this says whether they are or not.
And I,
I,
you know,

1145
01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:29.080
is this guy I mentioned,
I'm not good at the Internet and I'll fucking lose it.

1146
01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.530
So,
uh,
I've been doing that.
And then I also want to donate to,
if I,

1147
01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:37.190
if it's possible to donate to a Andre Agassi's,
uh,

1148
01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:41.140
school in Vegas after reading this book.
It just seemed like a,

1149
01:07:41.141 --> 01:07:43.210
that's pretty much an air tight thing over there.

1150
01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:45.760
Just seems like an amazing thing that he's doing and everybody else over there.

1151
01:07:45.761 --> 01:07:49.090
So anyways,
that is the podcast here for this week.

1152
01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:52.930
I hope you guys enjoyed it.
Uh,
thank you from the bottom,
my heart,

1153
01:07:52.931 --> 01:07:56.440
everybody that came out,
uh,
all the way to Texas.
Thank you.

1154
01:07:56.441 --> 01:08:00.040
Everybody who listened to,
uh,
me and Paul Versey sing our country,

1155
01:08:00.041 --> 01:08:01.890
hit America first

1156
01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:08.680
and then everybody who came out and Toronto man,
unbelievable shows up there.

1157
01:08:08.681 --> 01:08:09.514
And uh,

1158
01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:14.850
it made me sad to only be in all of those cities only for one night because,

1159
01:08:16.131 --> 01:08:17.120
uh,
you know,

1160
01:08:17.121 --> 01:08:21.440
I used to play the clubs before I did the one nighters and it was always fun.

1161
01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:22.880
There was all these,
there's all these places,

1162
01:08:22.881 --> 01:08:25.880
food places and all these places that I like to go.
So,
um,

1163
01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:29.390
I definitely got to get back to Toronto during hockey season.
You know,

1164
01:08:29.391 --> 01:08:33.710
the hotel where I stayed at,
we went by Jesus.
What Day is it?

1165
01:08:33.711 --> 01:08:34.461
The most and center.

1166
01:08:34.461 --> 01:08:37.520
I can't fuck members of where the habs play on a piss off maple leaf fence.

1167
01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:41.790
But I went by and I was immediately remembered this story of me and Versie when

1168
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.390
we went to a game there.
It had the best time.

1169
01:08:44.391 --> 01:08:46.550
It was so cool to bring versus either,
cause he's not a hockey guy.

1170
01:08:46.551 --> 01:08:49.280
And then you know,
anytime you bring somebody to see hockey live,

1171
01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:54.590
they freak the fuck out.
And to actually see it in Canada,
an original six team,

1172
01:08:54.591 --> 01:08:58.070
what that ridiculous fucking fan base.
All right.

1173
01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:01.690
There's no way Canadian fans would be showing up like hab fence.
It will,

1174
01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:04.430
you know,
in the drought that the Toronto has the effect that,

1175
01:09:04.431 --> 01:09:08.930
that that's the hardest fucking ticket to get fucking practically impossible to

1176
01:09:08.931 --> 01:09:11.270
get a maple leaf ticket.
Right.
Um,

1177
01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.300
even when I compliment the fucking may police,

1178
01:09:14.301 --> 01:09:16.810
I still have to trash the Canadians.
I just have to do it.
It's,

1179
01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:19.340
it's fucking habitual with me.
So anyways,
we would,

1180
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:21.380
we'd gone to the game when we came out.
It was just,

1181
01:09:21.381 --> 01:09:23.960
it was absolutely fucking like,
you know,

1182
01:09:23.961 --> 01:09:27.830
minus 10 degrees and there was wind and we were trying to get a cab and

1183
01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:31.040
everybody was,
any cabinet became available,
people were jumping in.

1184
01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:36.460
And I remember standing out with there with Versie and it was so fucking cold.

1185
01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.510
I remember we just,
we're just laughing.
At first we were Carson our brains out.

1186
01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:45.650
And then at one point we just did the wind blew again and it was just so cold.

1187
01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:49.010
We just,
it was like,
I think we're just going to fucking die out here.
Um,

1188
01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:52.910
but I just,
I have so many great fucking memories of,
uh,

1189
01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:56.180
that Canadian tour that we did.
So,
um,

1190
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:58.970
as much fun as it wants to do those two shows,

1191
01:09:58.971 --> 01:10:03.770
it's suck to only be there for one night.
So I definitely got to get back.
And,

1192
01:10:03.771 --> 01:10:04.604
um,

1193
01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.870
I did get to spend quite a lot of time in Austin.

1194
01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:13.490
I had one day off that I spent in Austin,
and then the next day,
uh,
we also,

1195
01:10:13.491 --> 01:10:17.420
we went to the ut game.
We had a great fucking time.

1196
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:22.640
And,
um,
what do we do?
Dallas?
And Houston,

1197
01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:24.440
the Houston.
I mean,
I went to Houston so quick,

1198
01:10:24.441 --> 01:10:28.730
I didn't get to go to south pug guitars.
That's how fast,
uh,
we went through town.

1199
01:10:28.731 --> 01:10:33.500
But,
uh,
hopefully the next time through a law,
spread it out a little bit more.

1200
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:35.960
And,
um,
once again,
thank you to everybody,

1201
01:10:35.961 --> 01:10:40.310
came out to my shows and see all you guys in the Midwest,
um,

1202
01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:44.180
later on this month.
And once again,
I'll put the links up for the,
um,

1203
01:10:44.690 --> 01:10:48.440
for the benefit shows I'm doing this weekend in Washington DC.
All right,

1204
01:10:48.441 --> 01:10:51.020
that's the podcast for this week.
I'll check it.
Oh,

1205
01:10:51.021 --> 01:10:54.950

If not,
I'll talk to you next Monday.
