00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.570
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burr and a,
this is the Monday morning POC has no,

2
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:07.650
you know what it isn't.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.450
It actually is and this is a very special episode of the Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:15.930
Ever since we got the wonderful all things comedy studios over here in the

5
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:18.090
middle of fucking nowhere.
Uh,

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.350
every once in a while I like to have a high powered Hollywood celebrity.

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.570
I started off with uh,

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.310
the always lovely Dave Kepner and I'm hitting it hitting in the two spot.

9
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:31.650
We got a the one and only Jay Moss.

10
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.800
<v 1>Hey Moses.
Lucky generals.
He's a dude.</v>

11
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.770
Do I actually was going to try to do your uh,

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.790
your Tracy Morgan bill whose middle name is Frederick cause you got pregnant.

13
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.860
That's why I named him William Frederick murder cause he won't be president.

14
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.860
Goddammit
man pregnant.

15
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.850
Do you know I listened to your radio show all the time?
I hope so.
It's fine.

16
00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:56.390
I have a lag.
It pains you just to do that intro.

17
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.210
It's great to watch bill burr just saying all things like just to have a semite

18
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.070
corporate now I had to weed through.
I was trying to do,

19
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:06.860
I bring up Dave character's name and then say what your name will that piss you

20
00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:09.980
off toy pipe this fuck it up with that.

21
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.790
But she sent me to Glendale.
I'm supposed to have a red ass when I come in here.

22
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.940
What do I care?
Not Glendale.
I don't know where this is and I know,

23
00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:20.360
but the directions said Glendale and the iPhone took me there.

24
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.900
This is right here.
You're,
you're the last,
this says right here.
Oh terrific.

25
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.850
45 minutes of your life.

26
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:28.640
Where you pretending like he didn't scream at the windshield and call me every

27
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:32.930
name in the book.
The way he looked away when you said no,
I understand.
Look,

28
00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:37.540
you're not,
what are you the closer now
I don't really care.
I don't,

29
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.640
do you swear on this?
I'm just saying that this like,

30
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.880
this is why I try not to have guests because it just becomes a fucking
nightmare.

31
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.790
It's fun though.
I like talking to you and you know,

32
00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:49.250
we always have a good time when we sit and talk and war stories.

33
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.880
We have a great time.
We have a good time.
Even belt bar.

34
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.100
We went debating doing this whole thing in a,
in a,

35
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:59.990
in a very annoying Boston accent the entire time.
You and Jay Ma?
Yeah.

36
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:04.190
Dude leaves at for four o'clock.

37
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.240
Bruins versus and leaves.
I got to move my car.

38
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:10.610
It's downstairs on Chester in Sydney street and it fucking pussies coming back

39
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:14.150
that we traded.
Fuck him.
Fuck him skates like a fucking ref.

40
00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:17.090
Jj Go in the cornice.
Yo,
he won't go.

41
00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:19.580
He won't go in the corner and he's afraid he's going to get fucking bought.

42
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:21.740
It had a flood.
You get out of their junior hockey league.

43
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:24.860
If you're afraid you're gonna get bored and you fucking,
why Erf?

44
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.850
Cause his fucking father owns the team.
Oh his father.
Shanty Irish.

45
00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:31.760
Always putting on hands at fathers too on fucking beacon street.

46
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:35.210
I remember that cock sock and he was face down in front of the hopper.
You know,

47
00:02:35.211 --> 00:02:36.950
it's funny is I can't even remember who the fuck I'm too.

48
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.130
I've been on the road so much that like I,
I can't remember anybody's name.

49
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.030
We traded the guy.
We had him,
he was crest Kessel.
He's good.
He,
I like him.

50
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.020
He's great.
I liked the Bruins a lot too.
It's a solid team.
Yeah,
it is.
Unless a,

51
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.500
you come on,

52
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.870
you watch them on the west coast trip when they come down here and they go out

53
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:53.570
and they party.
It's tough.
Tough.
Come West.

54
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.230
You Go Vancouver and then you scoot down.
You just keep scooting a little lower.

55
00:02:57.231 --> 00:03:01.270
San Jose keep getting hotter as you're going down
route.

56
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.530
It is hot.
Vancouver,
San Jose's a bit of a wash.
Yeah,
but the thing about,

57
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:09.250
and they come to la in Anaheim,
you're like,
Whoa,
hockey what?
Hockey.
Who?

58
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.580
That's right.
But even like Vancouver,
you know,
you walk out in the rink,

59
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.130
you're all sweaty.
You gotta keep your head covered.

60
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.890
It doesn't keep me in the end I want to go fuck somebody mood.

61
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.270
You know what I mean?
You get down here,
you walk out of the Rincon,

62
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.630
like a tank top,
it halfway full out.
I was like,

63
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:24.700
we should be doing this in a park some place.
Yeah.

64
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.470
It is a thought being an east coast guy like myself that I would actually love

65
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:29.861
it out here.

66
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:34.340
And I know that you are from the Greater New Jersey area right by uh,

67
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.900
the metal lands giant stadium right in the shadows of that and the leafy suburb.

68
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:40.180
If it was like a murderer show,
if I got murdered in the,

69
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.820
in the leafy suburbs of New Jersey,
a town,
uh,

70
00:03:43.821 --> 00:03:45.700
Tony town called Verona.

71
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.120
But this was no gentlemen and people never locked their doors in those towns.

72
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.040
Never.
And they say I do a whole bit about it.

73
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:52.960
Like why they must save so much time.

74
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:55.720
Like everyday there's one guy early for work cause he doesn't lock his fucking

75
00:03:55.721 --> 00:04:00.010
door.
And I also say,
and then after the murder,
yeah,
you write a book,

76
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.090
everybody,
everybody murdered every march.
Everybody locks the doors and it,
yeah.

77
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.370
And if you get,
if you want people to say nice things about you,

78
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:10.300
you really need to get murdered because they always say the same thing for
women.

79
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.280
White women.
For those of you scoring at home when you scorecards,

80
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.680
he school white women lead the league in getting murdered.

81
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.450
Like it's not even close.
They're the fucking Ted Williams is again,

82
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.280
I've never seen a black lady in those shows have never seen a Latina.

83
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:28.270
I've never seen the first 48 Eskimo.
I'm talking about like dateline,

84
00:04:28.271 --> 00:04:31.820
like in a small town.
Oh yeah.
Something was brewing at the waffle house.

85
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.930
Wasn't that onfi thick debt going for ad money?
Well,

86
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:38.400
he's a white lady named Pam and when you die they,

87
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.260
they always get interviewed and they go,
she really lit up a room.

88
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.580
That's when you die.
Since Pam,
before she even was in the room,

89
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:49.900
she never had no,
I like this one.
No one had anything bad to say about her.

90
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:53.650
And I'm at home going rarely cause by my math there's one guy that it's

91
00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:57.880
something so bad to say about Pam words.
Did it work?
He needed a fucking shovel,

92
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.610
a tent,
and you need a long drive to act out those words.
Uh,

93
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.280
she swiped,
sent me a text about this podcast by the way.
Oh No.
What did she say?

94
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.160
Uh,
you'll like it.
She,
you know,
she's the funny one.

95
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.850
[inaudible] what time we'd be home,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.
Remember,
uh,

96
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.610
don't fuck up.
And remember if you were having fun,

97
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:19.030
the audience can see you or some shit like that.

98
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.480
Be Lightening in a bottle and fill the podcast with levels of showmanship and

99
00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:25.930
sparkle that will take you to the atmosphere and beyond.
It's very,
yeah,

100
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.440
she a yoga teacher.
Oh,
she's fucking,
she's like a pothead comic.
Like,
oh,

101
00:05:30.441 --> 00:05:35.170
she's just funny.
Oh,
she's being sarcastic.
You didn't think I married a bat.

102
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:38.110
Shit crazy.
I did.
Dude.
I ain't lying.
You haven't met your wife.

103
00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:40.360
You had like a flash of panic and your,
I was like,
oh my God.

104
00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:43.180
Jay Morris married to Shelby Chong.
Yes.
I can't make fun of that tech.

105
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.930
If she was being completely funnel,
be lightening in a bottle,

106
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.500
take your career in the podcast to the atmosphere.
And beyond.
Okay.

107
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.810
If you could see the audience,
they're having a good time.
Yeah.

108
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.500
I'm not the quickest guy.
Check.
You are quick.
You did that Midwest tour though.

109
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.900
The red state flyover taught.
The Republican's are,
this is,

110
00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:01.760
this is going to be about the is I got to try and make this about you though.

111
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.630
[inaudible] stories podcast on iTunes.
Get the APP.
Do you have an APP built bar?

112
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.450
No.
Monday morning podcast should have its own APP helper.
I don't know it shit.

113
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.230
Fuck that.
Whereas with friends,

114
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.270
because then what happens is then it breaks down and then you need something

115
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:16.220
else and then it's another fucking conference call.

116
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.870
I am very happy to be in the bottom third of everything.

117
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:23.720
Just drafting behind all you guys that you're ahead of me.

118
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.640
You're way ahead of me.
I'm like,
because I statted before.
Yeah.

119
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.720
Oh no sir.
No Sir.
What date you got coming up bill?

120
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.830
Wait a second though.

121
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:38.831
I wanted to get back to New Jersey because I actually love New Jersey.

122
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.100
I do too.
I love it.

123
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:43.220
The food's great and there's all these unbelievable neighborhoods.

124
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:44.900
Every fucking Douche who moves to New York.

125
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.230
They go to Newark Airport and they look at all those chemical plants and then

126
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:50.500
they go,
this is New Jersey,
you know,

127
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.160
and they might give it up to yen and just above the bridge,
uh,

128
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.860
meaning the George Washington Bridge.
It's nice up there and uh,

129
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.900
but they just blow off the rest of the state.

130
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.320
Where I grew up was a super like foresty and like little league all at where

131
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:09.590
they filmed the sopranos.
Essentially.
My town for owner Nutley Caldwell,

132
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.780
like northern New Jersey and they shoot big out there.

133
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.110
The bicycle scenes when he's riding up the street,
I don't know,

134
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.980
but like Montclair is really beautiful.
It is gorgeous and it's great.

135
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:23.120
And Jersey shore is fun.
I know like the show like made it ruined.
It did.

136
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:26.720
But when people say like the Jersey shore was a bad representation of Italian

137
00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:29.960
Americans in Jersey,
I'm like,
ah,
I went to Jersey public school,

138
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:33.950
that's what my ass every day the situation was waiting for me and him for no

139
00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:35.870
reason.
Like,
it's not because I was running my mouth,

140
00:07:35.871 --> 00:07:37.250
which is what the listener would assume.

141
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.140
It just something you probably went to public school in Boston sometime suburbs,

142
00:07:41.141 --> 00:07:43.970
safe suffer safe suburbs.
Yep.
Sometimes you go to school,

143
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:46.400
it's just for no reason in your understanding.

144
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.670
It's just your turn in the barrel that that you show up and they go,

145
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.190
hey Matt even is looking for you man.
You're like,
what the fuck did I do?

146
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.840
I'm like,
I don't know man.

147
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.160
I think you looked at and when you're in the hallway then you got to fake like

148
00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:01.510
you have to take a shit 10 minutes before school ends and then you just joggled.

149
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.690
Yeah,
yeah.
I always tried to avoid,

150
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.810
I fought up until like junior high and then everybody like hit that growth
spurt.

151
00:08:08.811 --> 00:08:10.730
You know the kid who has the mustache in eighth grade,

152
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:15.160
so all of a sudden I was like a full six inches shorter than the bigger kids who

153
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:18.320
are running shit and they had me by like 40 pounds.

154
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.290
Like I didn't break a hundred pounds to like my freshman year of high school.

155
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:25.550
I was really like a wrestled 105 pounds and I,
I didn't have to make weight.

156
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:28.800
I had to go eat just so I didn't have to wrestle 98,
uh,

157
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.920
the smallest small lakes and all that crap.

158
00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:32.780
The peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
Yeah.

159
00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:35.930
So I imagine now what you know about nutrition wrestling at three and a fucking

160
00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:38.360
peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
No wonder I sucked.

161
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.260
You're out there just glob and do peanut butter and burning glucose.

162
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.770
The other day when they,
uh,

163
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.810
when they had that whole thing on 60 minutes about a rod and blah,
blah,
blah,

164
00:08:47.811 --> 00:08:49.460
he did this,
he did that and all that crap.

165
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:54.500
What really fascinated me about that was when the guy who was ratting him out,

166
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:59.280
now of course his name Tony,
I don't give a fuck what,
what,

167
00:08:59.281 --> 00:09:04.260
what industry it is.
You got enough or not.
Then with Tony,
the Gail rolls over.

168
00:09:04.261 --> 00:09:06.780
It's somehow Tony,
Tony,
Tony.
It could be like,

169
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:08.440
and I like what he said and I said this a rice,

170
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.290
these children's book and it Gay Tony.

171
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.840
Tony is going to roll over on everybody.
Hey,
not for nothing president,
but the,

172
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.410
you know,

173
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.280
Spiro Agnew has been talking to Tony I think when up to go with a different

174
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:22.740
running mate next time around now for nothing.

175
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.500
If you want to end the Vietnam war,
you got to,
you got to cut ties with Tony.

176
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:28.230
That's all there is though.
It Tony Bosch and I like what he says.

177
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.530
The first thing Alex would rig has said to me is,

178
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.400
I want you to give me what you gave Manny Ramirez.
And I'm like,
really?

179
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.890
He didn't fucking say hello.
You idiot.
Yeah,
you're on 60 minutes.
You're out.

180
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.980
If I wish I was a lawyer and his ass,
don't you wish you were like,

181
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:46.440
just could cross examinate people like on the spot.

182
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:49.560
Like you could just transform yourself.
Like when he's on 60 minutes,
Tony Bosch,

183
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.920
you could just be in the courtroom and go.
He didn't say hello really?

184
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.440
He just walked in the door in a strip mall in Miami.

185
00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:59.880
It said gimme what Manny had in 2008 he walked in,
he said,
attention,
please.

186
00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:04.380
I would like to do a legal PE,
Ds,
and the minute the guy goes,
well,

187
00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:06.990
he did say hello,
you go,
so then you're not even being truthful right now.

188
00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:08.160
And then boom,
Tony's out,

189
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.520
which will be the way I take you saying hello is they talked probably quite a

190
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:18.090
while before he finally looked over his shoulder on the park bench or wherever

191
00:10:18.091 --> 00:10:21.370
the fuck they were at to be like,
hey,
you know,
how did you hook up man?
All right.

192
00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:24.480
I,
I would actually bring it up like this.
Hey that Manny.
Yeah,

193
00:10:24.481 --> 00:10:28.620
he's really been playing great for a while,
Huh?
Yeah.
Wink,
wink.
Nudge.
Nudge.
Yeah.

194
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.180
It's not like you accidentally walk into a steroid lab in a mini mall next to a

195
00:10:33.181 --> 00:10:35.890
fucking nail salon.
Happy now.
Hello.
No,
that's not,

196
00:10:35.891 --> 00:10:39.210
and that's next door square or round.
No,

197
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:41.830
I want HGH on that snack stall.

198
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.660
It's not like you accidentally stumble into the guide then biogenesis clinic,

199
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.590
I'm pretty sure there's some phone calls like me,
you and I on the way here.

200
00:10:49.591 --> 00:10:51.450
I had to call you like,
where do I turn all that?

201
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.880
I'll be there in about 10 minutes.
Little exchange.

202
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.460
I want to go holidays profusely.
First thing he said was,

203
00:10:56.461 --> 00:11:00.180
I got a text from my wife.
You know what I mean?

204
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.940
You know the first thing you said,
hey that Joe Rogan,
he's got a good podcast.

205
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.580
Dan,
how do I,
uh,
Joe Rogan yet right of the bat.

206
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:09.120
I'm saying you don't like the Manny Ramirez thing.
How,
how does he go that long?

207
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.870
Rogan's podcast?
It's like some of them are.
Most of them are over two.

208
00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:15.830
I did like a three hour podcasts with him one time and it,

209
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.910
it's like a Scorsese movie flies by.

210
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.610
I was going to say it's never walk in its light out.
You walk out,

211
00:11:20.611 --> 00:11:24.270
it's dark and it's,
it's great.
It's like daylight savings times a podcast.
His,

212
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.530
his,
his great.
It's never like doll.
It's always,
it's,

213
00:11:26.531 --> 00:11:27.930
it's very impressive that you,

214
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.460
some go for like three hours and he and he fact checks everything as opposed to

215
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:35.220
mine,
which is just completely,
it's just horse shit.

216
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.610
My fact checks is his other people corrected me on Twitter.

217
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.990
But Twitter and you was one of the best lines ever about Twitter on my podcast.

218
00:11:42.991 --> 00:11:45.810
When people go,
hey bill,
what are you thoughts about the drones this year?

219
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:50.430
It's like,
I'm not your personal press conference.
Get more friends.

220
00:11:50.431 --> 00:11:54.070
Get you said get more summary.
Said be funnier on Twitter.
And I just,

221
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.960
I said I was,
I'm not on the writing staff of your life.
Yeah,
I'm funny.

222
00:11:57.961 --> 00:12:00.820
Or friends or something.
And you won't block anybody you told me.

223
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.410
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean I w I have,</v>

224
00:12:04.411 --> 00:12:08.400
but like you gotta be like ridiculous if you just being like ridiculous.

225
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.070
Um,
you know,

226
00:12:11.071 --> 00:12:14.820
I don't over the top racist or just just being a dick for it.

227
00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:18.090
Like right now someone's going to do it just to do it.
Cause you said it.
Yeah.

228
00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.650
And uh,
but no,
I,
I don't,
I don't really challenge you to make us block,

229
00:12:22.651 --> 00:12:25.910
you know,
Jesus,
they,
I don't,
don't do that.
No,
it's too late.

230
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:30.660
Hashtag challenge Hashtag block challenge people are going to be so don't do

231
00:12:30.661 --> 00:12:33.090
that.
I was trying to get to that Tony thing where he said,
oh,
go ahead.

232
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.850
The most amazing thing in to that interview because I know you're psycho into

233
00:12:35.851 --> 00:12:39.360
sports like me,
is that,
you know,
a rod sent him a text,
hey,

234
00:12:39.361 --> 00:12:42.220
I got a big game coming up,
blah blah blah blah blah.
Uh,

235
00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:45.840
and the guy gives him the little package,

236
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.870
little spa package of roids and then a rod goes out,

237
00:12:48.871 --> 00:12:52.440
hits a couple of doubles and a single has a great game.
And they asked him,

238
00:12:52.441 --> 00:12:54.630
what did you think after you saw that game?
And the guy said,

239
00:12:54.631 --> 00:12:58.810
this is like shooting fish in a barrel.
And it's literally like how much they've,

240
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.080
when you,
it was,
I'm going back to what you were talking about,

241
00:13:01.081 --> 00:13:02.640
the peanut butter sandwich before wrestling.

242
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.930
How much they've figured out like steroids since we were kids,

243
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.620
when like those guys in the 70s it was like horse tranquilizer,
excuse me.

244
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.820
And to what they do now,
it's just like this perfect balance.
And I have a theory,

245
00:13:14.821 --> 00:13:17.370
I keep saying this is my pocket.
We're all going to be on them.

246
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.970
They're going to become safe,
eventually safer and safer,

247
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.780
like the weed breathalyzer kind of trajectory.

248
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.360
And we're all going to be on them full heads of hair,

249
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:32.010
fucking jacked at 80 pulling people out of cars when they cut you off.

250
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.120
I'm in that,
that's,

251
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:36.700
<v 1>I'm look,
I don't understand.
You know,
the,</v>

252
00:13:36.701 --> 00:13:40.700
the definition of performance enhancing drug antibiotic is a performance

253
00:13:40.701 --> 00:13:41.534
enhancing drug.

254
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.830
If you tear your elbow out and you're a pitcher like Andy Pettitte and then they

255
00:13:45.831 --> 00:13:48.320
go,
well it's going to take you a year to recover.

256
00:13:48.321 --> 00:13:51.680
Or if you take HGH and shoot it into your elbow socket,

257
00:13:51.681 --> 00:13:53.500
you'll be back in eight months in time for the playoffs.

258
00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:57.860
Like you have to be a fucking idiot not to take that chance because you want to

259
00:13:57.861 --> 00:13:59.780
pitch in the playoffs cause you're gonna get another contract.

260
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.750
So like what about antibiotics?
Like,
well,
you've got strep throat,

261
00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.420
you can let it run its course or you could take this,

262
00:14:05.421 --> 00:14:08.960
you arithromycin you'll probably be banging it out in about 10 days

263
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:09.830
<v 0>right now,</v>

264
00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.770
which would enhance your performance because you wouldn't be fucking sick.

265
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:17.360
Connect.
Exactly.
Why don't I just have a night?
Can I hear a little,
uh,
uh,

266
00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.790
Joe to Rosa requested a little Harvey Keitel.
Can I hear?

267
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.730
<v 2>What the fuck was Tony Busche thinking?
Yeah.</v>

268
00:14:22.731 --> 00:14:25.230
I want to give steroids to amend.

269
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:29.910
I guess Alex Rodriguez.
He's not from this coach.

270
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.350
Rizzy what the fuck?
Everything was fine.

271
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.880
Manny Ramirez,
there was no paper trail.
None.

272
00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:43.310
They busted him.
I'm fucking female hormones.
Then you give it to a rod.

273
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.070
There's no jobs in his town over there.

274
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.740
<v 1>Dude.
You're fucking impressions.</v>

275
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.010
They couldn't look you in the eye because I know you're at my face cause you go

276
00:14:52.011 --> 00:14:54.380
eat.
Cause when I did call on a mine,
you're like you're doing the face.

277
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.160
Do not actually staring at a brick wall over your shoulder doing Cattell.

278
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.060
Oh you know what's great like somewhere around here was where they shot a

279
00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:06.200
reservoir.
Dogs.
It doesn't exist anymore.
Like the uh,
the whole,
basically the,

280
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:09.710
what the fuck do you call it when your drain the bodies and all that and they

281
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.820
get thrown in a box because that's that word.
Not Cadavers.

282
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.340
The fucking place where you processed dead bodies.

283
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.880
A mark that you're going to go,
they were always hearing duck.

284
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.070
It was somewhere in here and it doesn't exist anymore.

285
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:27.470
We closed the loading dock down.
We did so much acting.

286
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:32.150
What the fuck was jus thinking?
You shut the good,

287
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:36.110
but you don't die from your wounds.
You're gonna wish you were dead,

288
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.010
but it takes days.
Dude.
How do you do that?
I don't know.

289
00:15:40.011 --> 00:15:42.380
There's only selling like and what do you pick up on?

290
00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:46.700
Because Harvey Keitel his it guy.
It's really just Collin at a different pitch.

291
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.960
What the fuck was what?
You know Collins down here now.

292
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:54.830
What the fuck was Joe thinking
that got an animal,
you know HR,

293
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.270
the whole place into a shooting gallery.
Bang,
Bang,
Bang.
If we look,

294
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.570
if we could just get in touch with Joe,
everything's going to be all right.

295
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.510
If we could just get in touch with Joe,
everything will be alright.
No,

296
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:07.790
but there's something the way you do Kai,

297
00:16:07.791 --> 00:16:12.110
tell does that chopping off of the word?
I like how you were doctor.

298
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.830
How you picked that up?
I don't know.
I don't,
I have no idea how,

299
00:16:15.831 --> 00:16:19.310
and I get asked a lot.
A lot of times when I put my baby to bed,

300
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.450
I'll just say he wants me to sit on the couch across from his crib and I'm like,

301
00:16:23.451 --> 00:16:24.440
cool.
And I'll just say,
okay,

302
00:16:24.441 --> 00:16:27.500
I'm answering questions on Twitter now go and everyone's like,

303
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.450
how'd he do impressions that of your impressions.
Then it's like,

304
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.790
I can either do them or no,
I'll get asked like,

305
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.400
what's an impression you're working on?
And I'm like,
no,

306
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:35.600
it's never happened in my life.

307
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:40.610
I can either do it the first time I opened my mouth or I can never ever,
ever,

308
00:16:40.611 --> 00:16:45.440
ever do it now Dillon blew me away.
You did Louis C k all that was,
yeah,

309
00:16:45.441 --> 00:16:47.330
but I don't know if I'm doing the voice.

310
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:52.810
I'm just for fucking guy and I'm sitting here with Shit and fucking shit in my

311
00:16:53.391 --> 00:16:58.280
hand and fucking asshole kids with fucking nut allergies.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.680

314
00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:09.191

315
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.830
I'm just a fucking human being.
Shit.
Eat Person.

316
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:16.190
Men that we'll see that wasn't like,
well,
whatever.

317
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.370
I'm going to hang out with you long enough and eventually you don't want to do

318
00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:23.510
Louis now I want you,
you're going end up doing me at some point.
I'll do you.

319
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.240
Okay.
Okay.

320
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.820
I'll tell you that much new studios.
I think they're good,
you know.

321
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.320
Okay.
Just got back from the studios.
Big Tour.

322
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:41.780
Appreciate all you guys coming out and okay.
All right.
Go Fuck Yourself.

323
00:17:41.781 --> 00:17:45.090
I just try.
I wish I could do it.
I wish you wish you could.
Do you,

324
00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.490
you wish you could do,
you know,

325
00:17:46.491 --> 00:17:50.250
I wish you got to let the fuck not just do the that everybody else does because

326
00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:51.960
all I'm doing is,
and this is why my,

327
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.490
I think you're the best because you do like so many people do impressions of

328
00:17:56.491 --> 00:17:59.700
people's impressions and the ones that you do,
nobody else does.

329
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.230
There's a guy too,
I'm really bad with the names.
The guy who was on that,
um,
uh,

330
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.680
oh Jesus Christ.
A fucking nerd show.
Big Bang theory he used,

331
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.900
he used to be on the other show that wasn't 30 rock that the guy from friends

332
00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:17.610
did.
Matthew Perry did a show called the studio or studio h or something.

333
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.980
Yeah,
I know what you mean.
But it's not this show,
isn't it?
Yeah.
And,

334
00:18:20.981 --> 00:18:24.870
and this dude who's on the,
uh,
the fucking planet show there,

335
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:29.590
I had a show about like Asperger's.
I see.

336
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.160
I don't watch that show.
Big Bang theory.
I saw him,
he,

337
00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.190
that he did a Ben Stiller and he did a Tom cruise that we're fucking

338
00:18:35.191 --> 00:18:36.000
unbelievable.

339
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.390
Ben Stiller does a great Tom Cruise to Ben Stiller is one of the best

340
00:18:39.391 --> 00:18:43.460
impressionists ever.
When he used to do the Ben Stiller show before Fox,

341
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.830
when Sinead gras pillow and Andy Dick and everybody was on it when it was just

342
00:18:46.831 --> 00:18:49.710
Ben Stiller in this guy,
Jeff Khan,
uh,

343
00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.010
just those two or the Ben Stiller show and they would do mashups.

344
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:57.620
They would do like rain man on Star Trek.
Oh,
that's awesome.
She's like,

345
00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.970
who?
Who,
who took you to space ray?
Yeah.

346
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:06.540
With the big smile hood and the Jeff Commandant of the Spock years ago.
Yeah,

347
00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:09.420
you took me in a space and you just do like they all the movies,

348
00:19:09.421 --> 00:19:11.670
they would just mash to movies together is amazing.

349
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.650
That's very underrated sketch show too.

350
00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:16.380
I feel like when people will go into the greatest of all time,

351
00:19:16.381 --> 00:19:20.910
they'll go like Chapelle,
they'll go mr show.
Then they jump over.

352
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.420
The Ben Stiller show goes straight to a in living color.

353
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.870
Then obviously SNL and some of the things in the hall,

354
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.660
some of them age poorly and some of them don't.

355
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:35.200
There's some that I watch now and I'm like,
I don't,
this must've been like,
uh,

356
00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.770
like clothing.
When you watch old sitcoms and you're like,
well,

357
00:19:37.771 --> 00:19:40.950
what the fuck was everybody wearing?
I feel that way about comedy sometimes.

358
00:19:40.951 --> 00:19:44.280
Like old sitcoms.
My wife said this to me once,
she said all sitcoms,

359
00:19:44.281 --> 00:19:45.091
no matter how good they are,

360
00:19:45.091 --> 00:19:49.170
they're all orange and reruns throw like yellowy and weird looking Larry.

361
00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:51.780
I was wearing like fucking mom jeans and you're like,
what?

362
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.430
Like you look at Seinfeld and you're like,

363
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.200
this was the greatest show in the history of television.
He's got mom jeans,

364
00:19:58.201 --> 00:20:02.010
white sneakers and a mullet and like a Christmas sweater.
Like oh my God.

365
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.790
And you of course know funny show.
You know what kills me is that shows already,

366
00:20:05.791 --> 00:20:09.570
like some of those early episodes are already like 23 years ago,
24 years ago.

367
00:20:09.571 --> 00:20:11.250
He fucking believe and it's weird.

368
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.590
And you're in La and that's saying the comedies bad.

369
00:20:13.591 --> 00:20:15.990
I'm saying it just age is so weird.
And,
but,

370
00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:21.030
but my point was I look at comedy sketch shows and stand up when I look at old

371
00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.990
standup clips and if I listen to old albums I'm like wow,

372
00:20:24.991 --> 00:20:27.960
this must have been like in 1970s thing.
Cause this isn't funny at all.

373
00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:29.760
Like it was jack was such a so what do you think,

374
00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:33.930
who do you think holds up or Carl and and prior hold up obviously Cosby.

375
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.333
Cosby.
Yeah.
I have,

376
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.640
my first record comedy record I bought was to my brother Russell.

377
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.940
And that whole second side was just him and his brother in the bed talking and

378
00:20:41.941 --> 00:20:46.800
like trying to freak each other out.
Like that's,
that's hysterical.
And uh,

379
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.840
but a lot of it just doesn't,
it's weird you watch like old,

380
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.390
well even like old Red Fox is that you go,
oh,

381
00:20:52.391 --> 00:20:55.150
he's just like telling jokes like actual like he's like Jackie,

382
00:20:55.151 --> 00:20:57.820
the joke man before Jackie,
the joke man,

383
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.090
I got one at him to get wash it away.
Well he just,

384
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:04.020
he's like just telling jokes like he's not doing it.

385
00:21:04.021 --> 00:21:07.800
He doesn't have any material that like,
like that he about,

386
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.220
do you know what I mean?
I haven't,
I haven't old Red Fox one.

387
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.820
It's him basically bombing,
doing a late show,

388
00:21:12.821 --> 00:21:16.420
not wanting to basically beyond.
I don't know why.

389
00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:18.880
I'm sure I was just going to say,
I don't know why he put it out.

390
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.040
I know what happened.
He died and then,

391
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.700
and then the people who are making money off of them,
you know that shit,

392
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.030
they just keep putting up.
They put out everything,

393
00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.820
they put out all this shit that I'm always worried after.

394
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:35.590
After somebody passes away,
be any,
any sort of artists or whatever where like,

395
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:39.150
look,
I understand a couple of years after,
you know what I mean?
But when,

396
00:21:39.151 --> 00:21:43.600
when it starts to get like 15,
yeah,
I hidden gem reliefs.

397
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.700
Hendrix didn't think that this was good enough to,

398
00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:50.290
he didn't realize how great this was.
The law of Bill Burr at the,
uh,

399
00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.700
Albany chuckle hut.

400
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:55.210
These are the latest somebody's camera phone and it just keeps getting earlier

401
00:21:55.211 --> 00:21:57.130
and earlier into the artist's career.
Yeah.

402
00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:01.330
Just you bombing on like a evening at Caroline's or even at the Improv.

403
00:22:01.331 --> 00:22:05.070
Roger Paul Gig in like Vermont.
Roger,
but flying,

404
00:22:05.071 --> 00:22:08.200
they were stars before they were stars.
This is bill burrows.

405
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.290
Millard Fillmore's bowling alley in Staten Island.

406
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.590
Check 'em out the jobs on his guy.
Hey,
when you,
uh,

407
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.010
let's talk about your radio show.
They listen to,
I got,
I,
I got,

408
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.400
I got an old truck that I drive and it has a am radio,
right.

409
00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:23.980
So I'm always listening to,
plus I always listen to the sports anyway,

410
00:22:23.981 --> 00:22:27.550
so I'm always listening to your shit.
Right.
Do you laugh?
Yeah,
I love it.

411
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.370
The only thing is sometimes I get up too late.

412
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.490
And when all the listeners call in,
uh,
I,

413
00:22:33.491 --> 00:22:36.910
that took me a while to figure out what was going on.
Rapid fire at the,
yes.

414
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:40.780
I just had people call up and talk nonsense the last four minutes of the show

415
00:22:40.781 --> 00:22:43.480
that worked because I was sitting there.
I go,
I,
I was,
it took me like,

416
00:22:43.481 --> 00:22:46.330
I'd like three days in a row I woke up at the same time and it had some acting

417
00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:50.300
gigs so I'd get my truck and I put it on.
And you'd be like add from Oskaloosa.

418
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:55.420
Well shoot it.
Yeah.
What do you got?
Where can um,
people around the country?
Um,

419
00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:56.980
if you want to list of affiliates,

420
00:22:56.981 --> 00:23:01.660
go to Jay more sports.com and just click affiliates was 150 affiliates.

421
00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:04.540
It's all over the place where a few of iHeart radio APP on your phone.

422
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:06.820
You can just type in Jim or sports on the IHEART radio APP.

423
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.450
You guys had a great gig of what it's best.
I work 15 hours a week.

424
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:14.410
I have pass movie pass movie sets.
Like on my drive home and I'm like,
Ugh,

425
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.680
just sitting in a fucking trailer eating donuts,

426
00:23:17.681 --> 00:23:20.230
watching Jerry Springer or are they going to get to me yet?

427
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.840
But you were good in the heat.
I like watching the heat,

428
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.040
but I imagine how much time you sat in your trailer because you know you can't

429
00:23:27.041 --> 00:23:30.150
lie.
That was a good one that we really quick.
I,

430
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.780
I've only had one.
I'm not gonna,
you know,
I'm not going to name the name.
God,

431
00:23:34.781 --> 00:23:38.710
I can't,
I can't burn bridges where I'm at.
But I had one where it was just like,

432
00:23:38.711 --> 00:23:41.230
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
And it was be like,

433
00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:45.970
we need you on set by 10:00 AM and 10:00 PM you've,

434
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.440
you've eaten breakfast,
lunch,

435
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.140
and then the crew dinner and you're still sitting there.
I'm sorry.

436
00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:54.600
I kept pushed again,
had a,
and by the end,
like the,

437
00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:57.170
the big challenge is when you finally get pulled out of there.

438
00:23:57.171 --> 00:24:00.650
And then just the whole fucking irony of it is hilarious where you're like,
oh,

439
00:24:00.651 --> 00:24:02.330
I'm going to go out to of the Hollywood,

440
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.420
get out of my little Shit House and become a staff.

441
00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.190
And then you go out there and you're sitting in a fucking trailer.

442
00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.190
It's an outhouse.
Yeah.
You're sitting in the,
yeah,

443
00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:14.240
you're sitting in those like a framed photo of a teepee or like a squall holding

444
00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:16.550
a baby and like a little blanket and every,
and everybody goes,

445
00:24:16.551 --> 00:24:18.500
don't drink the water.
Don't brush your teeth.

446
00:24:18.501 --> 00:24:21.800
Bring bottled water to brush your teeth with basically means somehow people take

447
00:24:21.801 --> 00:24:25.580
it pisses and shit and they filter that fucking water back.
Oh yeah.

448
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.390
And the poopooed truck comes,
that's somebody's,
my son calls it.
Sorry.
Yeah.

449
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.420
Shit truck comes.

450
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.760
That's always nice when you're taking a nap and a trailer and all the sudden

451
00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:33.800
you're like,
did I shit my pants?

452
00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:37.670
Because there's just a truck the rest of the country,
it probably has no idea.

453
00:24:37.671 --> 00:24:39.890
Like,
thinking about every port a potty you've ever seen.

454
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.500
They have the empty and somehow you don't pick them up and dump them out into

455
00:24:42.501 --> 00:24:43.310
the sink.

456
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:46.890
There's just a truck with a hose that just suctions out all the piss and shit.

457
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.640
And when that guy uh,
hooks up to your trailer,
it's great.

458
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:53.870
But the thing is to a movie or even like a TV show that's like a one hour,

459
00:24:53.871 --> 00:24:56.300
like when I was on ghost whisperer.
In hindsight,
you're like,

460
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.060
if ever there was a time in my life,
I just should've,

461
00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:01.610
I should've just done diamond pushups and crunches.

462
00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:06.330
It's the 40 fucking hours I just sat alone.
Yeah.

463
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:07.101
I could have just sat there,

464
00:25:07.101 --> 00:25:09.860
Rosetta stone and I don't hear the knock on the door and they're waving.

465
00:25:09.861 --> 00:25:14.540
I'm like [inaudible] like I would have spoke fluent French.

466
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:17.600
Right.
And it said you just keep eating and eating.
You know why?

467
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.600
Because somebody just keeps walking around with food like you're at the goddamn

468
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.790
playboy mansion.
Like I think they know now primal,
we are like,

469
00:25:25.791 --> 00:25:28.040
if they don't hand out free to Ketos,
you're like,
fuck it.

470
00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.080
I don't want to be in showbiz anymore.
This is bullshit.

471
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:33.290
I've been here since 5:00 AM I'm wearing a prosthetic phase where it looks like

472
00:25:33.291 --> 00:25:37.130
half my face is melted off.
I'm allergic to it.
My skin.
Oh,

473
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:40.760
popovers and he'd just eat and then that makes you half basically.

474
00:25:40.761 --> 00:25:43.840
It's like going to the DMV with famous people.
Yeah.

475
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.810
Is he just sitting there and when they call you a fucking name,

476
00:25:47.811 --> 00:25:51.510
it's the same level of excitement.
Like,
oh my God,
I only take the pill.

477
00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.050
You're exactly right because they take the picture and you're like,
that's it.

478
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.540
Yeah.
Then you're like,
oh my God,
I hope I have all the right stuff.

479
00:25:56.541 --> 00:25:58.930
I don't get sent back to the back of the line.
There's not,

480
00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:03.680
it's worth the wait once they finally get going.
But fortunately I,
I've,
I've had,

481
00:26:03.681 --> 00:26:06.800
I've been really lucky with the little bit of acting work that I've done that

482
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:11.390
it's been on time,
like do breaking bad was ridiculous.
I just like,
you landed,

483
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:16.580
you went to wardrobe,
they got you,
you think you slept,
you woke up the next day,

484
00:26:16.581 --> 00:26:18.830
bing,
Bang,
boom.
And before you knew what happened,

485
00:26:18.831 --> 00:26:22.500
you were on that southwest flight like Dennis Farina and a and a,

486
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.480
what does that fucking movie?
Remember something.
Ah,
Jesus,

487
00:26:26.481 --> 00:26:30.870
I can't I Shrek.
What the fuck was it called?
Smackdown.

488
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:33.380
Being able to ask.
That would have been funny.
But instead so aggressively.

489
00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:35.900
If I just want to truck,
yeah,
I would've sounded like Ron Bennington.

490
00:26:35.901 --> 00:26:39.060
I would have been cool.
Shrek.
Fuck was it called?
I just wait.

491
00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:42.020
What's that movie where they will what?
Brad Pitt.

492
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:46.230
Brad Pitt speaks in the fucking pikey accent.

493
00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:52.020
That is Breena wasn't in snatch.
Jay was Dennis for Oh yeah,
Dennis Farina.

494
00:26:52.021 --> 00:26:54.950
I was taking Dennis' friends.
Yeah,
it Dennis Farina.
Oh,

495
00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.390
looking at the references already gone because they kept having to meet,

496
00:26:57.391 --> 00:26:59.970
slam the shot and you're gone.
Like that's what it was like to do that one.

497
00:26:59.971 --> 00:27:04.280
But Dennis' friends cause he know more PD blue.

498
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.010
I was like,
what the fuck is bill talking about?

499
00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.120
I have nicknames.
We,

500
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.920
me and my wife have a bunch of restaurants we like and I just have nicknames for

501
00:27:13.921 --> 00:27:17.460
all of them cause I can't remember the names.
Why is your memory's so bad?

502
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:18.960
You're not like a big pothead.
You just,

503
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:23.100
every once in a while you have a couple loggers and that's it.
I uh,

504
00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:25.200
I don't know what it is.
I have been talking on cell phones.

505
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.330
I don't know what it is to say that to me now.

506
00:27:27.331 --> 00:27:29.940
You can freak me out and I'll be on speaker.
The rest of my,
my,

507
00:27:29.941 --> 00:27:34.140
I can remember like rushing yards from 1978,

508
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:38.930
but I can't remember the name of the place that I,
or the name of the TV show,

509
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:40.990
the fucking movie I just saw.
Uh,

510
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.820
you ever watch like Big Bang theory or friends on Youtube when they take the

511
00:27:44.821 --> 00:27:49.650
sound the last out on youtube you can watch like Big Bang theory where they take

512
00:27:49.651 --> 00:27:53.580
the left track out.
Oh No,
it's like a Wes Anderson movie.
It's amazing.

513
00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.580
Who's Les Anderson?
He's a director.
Oh,
sorry.

514
00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.500
You're in the business you want to do over.
Go Love Wes Anderson.
I,

515
00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:03.600
I'm dying to work with that guy.
Well,

516
00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:06.360
you watch friends without the laugh track and you're like,
oh,

517
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.430
I know this is really the best because that's what you get asked.
I'm sure too.

518
00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:13.560
Like if you do radio,
they're like,
hey,
now you're in movies.

519
00:28:13.561 --> 00:28:18.360
What do you like doing more standup movies?
TV.
You're like,

520
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.370
what do you want me to say?
I'm here to promote,
stand up.

521
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.340
Of course I want to do fucking movies.
The rest of my life is forever.
But yeah,

522
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:28.290
find them out.
There are,
there are fun.
But the uh,
the uh,

523
00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.180
there's no residual check for standup.

524
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.600
But the great thing about stand up is it's in real time.
Like the other night,

525
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.520
I don't know,
flipping through,
whenever I see like those one camera shoot shows,

526
00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:41.430
like I hate that that's in the back of my head now.
I just give start thinking.

527
00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:45.120
That's probably two in the morning when the shooting that brutal.
Those shows,

528
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.200
they all earned their fucking money,
man.
Yeah,
they do.
And it's just the waiting.

529
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.870
And the thing is those shows,

530
00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:56.040
I've been a guest on a bunch like West Wing,
CSI Miami.
I've been on goals,

531
00:28:56.041 --> 00:28:58.240
which Webinar on like a lot of mostly I guess,

532
00:28:58.241 --> 00:29:02.100
but it really is a show where like you don't care if you see your family or not,

533
00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:05.820
and the radio show was the best because I'm done at noon every day.

534
00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:10.050
My kid gets out of Preschool at 1230 and I'm there waiting for him.
He runs,

535
00:29:10.051 --> 00:29:14.160
I pick him up.
I'm a home in the Palisades at one he takes,

536
00:29:14.161 --> 00:29:18.750
he's asleep by one 15 I'm asleep by one 20 it's ridiculous.

537
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.890
You're getting away with murder.

538
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:23.400
I don't care if I ever get my picture taken again in a,
in a camera ever.

539
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:27.180
I don't care if it's one frame or a thousand if you know fucking Clint Eastwood

540
00:29:27.181 --> 00:29:28.080
calls or something,

541
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.020
obviously I'm not going to turn anything down because we all want to live

542
00:29:31.021 --> 00:29:33.660
forever and new Bordeaux and the only way to do that is to actually be in film.

543
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.860
That is the way to live forever.
That is eternal life in Christ is one way.

544
00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:43.220
The blood of Christ and the word capital w and a movies because 10 years from

545
00:29:43.241 --> 00:29:46.660
now,
50 years from now,
you get a DVD and you watch the godfather and you're like,

546
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:50.410
oh,
that's right Jimmy.
What about a standup special stand?
Those special too,

547
00:29:50.411 --> 00:29:52.600
but you're going to go look what the fuck I was wearing.

548
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.940
Why was I wearing a shirt with the plates on?

549
00:29:54.941 --> 00:29:59.020
It is not going to think that in the movie.
No,

550
00:29:59.021 --> 00:30:01.660
cause it's up the time.
Like when you watch movies from the,

551
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:04.480
if you watch like dog day afternoon,
you're not like look at these assholes.

552
00:30:04.481 --> 00:30:08.070
You're like whoa.
It was 1977 hours here.
That Saturday dreads movie and every,

553
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:12.790
and the cars are from 1977 the license plates,
the police uniforms,
everything,

554
00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.700
every extra is dressed like that.
When you watch mad men,
you're not like,

555
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.480
what are these people?
They don't know.
It's 2014 with the fucking skinny ties,

556
00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:23.020
right?
Like it's just of the time.
It's completely eternal.

557
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.950
That's what makes movies.
That's why the specialty of the time,

558
00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.630
because you're alone and that's what makes us unique.
And what you said was true.

559
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:36.700
Stand up is the best for guys like you and me because,
and this is going to,

560
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.010
if this sounds like you know,
Hokey,

561
00:30:39.011 --> 00:30:41.320
I don't give a shit because you know I'm telling the truth.
It's,

562
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.730
it is actually who we are.

563
00:30:42.731 --> 00:30:46.330
And when you travel and you go someplace and you had a town and you go on stage

564
00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:48.760
in the first 18 minutes,

565
00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:51.970
you're just bullshitting and riffing about your hotel and like some weird

566
00:30:51.971 --> 00:30:55.630
turnaround in the freeway in that town.
And they're like,
Holy Shit.

567
00:30:55.631 --> 00:30:58.600
He knows about that.
And like you haven't,
you haven't even done an ad.

568
00:30:58.780 --> 00:30:59.980
You've been on stage many,

569
00:30:59.981 --> 00:31:03.370
many times when you've gone like 15 minutes and you're like,

570
00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.950
well I should probably get started in your mind.
Right.

571
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.210
I mean like that's the best.
I mean that's crazy.
That is the weirdest.
No,

572
00:31:10.211 --> 00:31:15.211
that is the best because especially if you're sick of your act it cause it's

573
00:31:15.221 --> 00:31:18.310
really like what that would be the equivalent to somebody who actually has a

574
00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:21.220
real job unlike us.
That would be like somehow your,

575
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:25.480
you show up for an hour late for work and your boss doesn't notice and you still

576
00:31:25.481 --> 00:31:29.140
get paid.
Anybody listening with your right,
anybody listening with a real job.

577
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:30.850
When you go to work one day and they're like,

578
00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:35.920
hey there's wings in the conference room today and you're like Holy Shit and you

579
00:31:37.361 --> 00:31:40.420
just go to the conference room and eat wings and have a diet coke and like,
no,

580
00:31:40.421 --> 00:31:44.080
we're all just going to take like 15 minutes.
Eat Wings has not awesome.

581
00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.080
It's like that's like your job and like,
oh my God,

582
00:31:47.081 --> 00:31:48.730
down the hall there's just some free shit.

583
00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.490
That's how I ended up in this business because it was nothing better.

584
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.070
Like when school,
when there was a fucking snow day,

585
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:59.230
that feeling of fucking euphoria that Ah,
I don't have to live my life today.

586
00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.120
You know,
it was just fucking great.

587
00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:04.360
I don't have to do any homework cause no goddamn stress.
You know,
my dad,

588
00:32:04.361 --> 00:32:06.240
one time we had a,
uh,

589
00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:10.810
we had one of those random day offs a Wednesday.
Yeah.

590
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.660
There was some sort of teacher conference or fucking thing and like to,

591
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.510
to have them show up.
God bless him,
God bless him for showing up to restaurant,

592
00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:21.190
went fucking scan.
Um,
we had this random Wednesday off,

593
00:32:21.191 --> 00:32:24.970
so he comes home,
we were all jumping around and stuff.
My Dad and I said,
he said,

594
00:32:24.971 --> 00:32:27.520
well,
what's going on?
What's going on?
And were like,
Oh,
you know,

595
00:32:27.521 --> 00:32:29.980
we've got tomorrow off from school and I'll do the hallway,
blah blah.

596
00:32:29.981 --> 00:32:34.420
And he goes,
he has not,
he has,
that's not true.
That's a true like,
yeah,

597
00:32:34.421 --> 00:32:35.950
we know that teachers said,
he goes,
no,
I just,

598
00:32:35.951 --> 00:32:39.170
I just heard on the radio on the way back that on the way home they said,

599
00:32:39.171 --> 00:32:43.280
you guys have school.
He'll be like,
no,
no,
no.
They have they ever,
uh,

600
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.910
parents teacher.
And he just stayed with it and just kept going.
Now,

601
00:32:46.911 --> 00:32:51.590
now I heard it,
we were like,
oh,
I want to rip our homes.
So I dad,
we believe him.

602
00:32:51.591 --> 00:32:54.830
So we went upstairs,
we did our fucking homework.
He didn't say shit.
We go to bed,

603
00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:59.620
wake up the next morning to our paper routes.
Doesn't say shit.
Okay,

604
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.570
get up at like six and more.
Do these fucking papers.
We come in,

605
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.170
we're eating breakfast.
All right,
we got all our books were showered,

606
00:33:06.171 --> 00:33:11.030
we're ready to go to school.
We fucking walk out the door.
He doesn't say shit.

607
00:33:11.031 --> 00:33:14.270
We go down and stand in front of the whole fucking neighborhood who all knows

608
00:33:14.271 --> 00:33:17.690
his day off,
10 under this tree waiting for the bus.

609
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.710
He finally gets in his car to go to work,
drives down the under the driveway,

610
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:26.630
rolls down the window,
waves at us and drives the work and left us there.

611
00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:27.560
And when,

612
00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.890
how long did you wait for the bus till a fucking neighbor drove by with their

613
00:33:30.891 --> 00:33:34.300
kids.
Like the buzzers are going to a waterpark.
They,

614
00:33:34.301 --> 00:33:36.560
I don't know where they were going,
but they were going like,
you know,

615
00:33:36.561 --> 00:33:38.840
there's no school.
And then were like,
Oh,

616
00:33:38.841 --> 00:33:41.990
our dad said there was school submit is all look like idiots.

617
00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:46.430
I remember calling up my dad's the first time I used the f word and he didn't

618
00:33:46.431 --> 00:33:48.440
care.
He was laughing so hard.

619
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:53.840
He had this lovely like die and fucking laughing as we were co.
Wow Man.

620
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.130
I can't believe he didn't fucking,
that is the funniest shit ever.

621
00:33:58.131 --> 00:34:00.890
That's such such a stand up.
That's what I'm telling you.

622
00:34:00.891 --> 00:34:04.700
That's how I ended up being a comedian because right there like any other parent

623
00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.580
would just have to look at there can be like,
all right man,

624
00:34:07.581 --> 00:34:08.720
get back to the fucking house.

625
00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:12.890
But a comedian drives away and leaves you there.

626
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:17.930
Like as the years go by,
the genius of it,
it just,

627
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:22.420
it pissed me off when he did it.
But that's the funniest shit.
He was like,

628
00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.670
Andy Cole made his own kids looked like we had something wrong with us.

629
00:34:25.671 --> 00:34:29.030
Like we'd go more through going to school,
there's the,

630
00:34:29.031 --> 00:34:34.031
and then they put you in the position of like someone saying there's no school

631
00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:37.460
and now you gotta like on the fly go,

632
00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.700
well my is my dad lying whereas my dad wrong.

633
00:34:40.701 --> 00:34:43.790
So you've got to defend your dad's honor,
but hope he's wrong.
At the same time,

634
00:34:43.791 --> 00:34:46.580
like you're already mentioned,
the neighbors just going like,

635
00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:51.670
how the fuck did they not know Mr Berra saw your son on the bus stop with all

636
00:34:52.611 --> 00:34:55.670
his books.
Your Dad just left and that's great and you're right.

637
00:34:55.671 --> 00:34:57.290
That's what separates it.

638
00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:00.080
But that's why you wanted to be a comic because of snow days.
My Damn,

639
00:35:00.081 --> 00:35:04.490
you don't want to live your life and that's what you just said is everything

640
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.840
that comedy in one sentence.

641
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:09.500
I wanted to be comic cause I didn't want to do real life.
I didn't want to work.

642
00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.200
It's the best.
I don't,
I have no desire.

643
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.980
That's why I haven't had guests on my fucking podcast because I just looked at

644
00:35:15.981 --> 00:35:18.620
it like,
man,
that's going to be work.
I got to give them the right directions.

645
00:35:18.621 --> 00:35:21.070
If they get the wrong fucking do all that bullshit that just happened there and

646
00:35:21.071 --> 00:35:24.020
you have to give me the right directions.
I was in fucking Chino.

647
00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.360
Who Does your fucking mess?

648
00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:33.030
We do go Google maps.
Told me I was at the location.
Good God,

649
00:35:33.031 --> 00:35:37.980
the last hospital is another is another classic.
One of my dad.
My brother was,
uh,

650
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.050
<v 0>it was some hot chick down the street and she had this fucking,
uh,</v>

651
00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:44.700
she had this house party,
like one of those risky ones.
Wait,
hey,

652
00:35:44.701 --> 00:35:45.930
well the parents are like,
yeah,

653
00:35:45.931 --> 00:35:49.080
we'll leave and we'll be back in an hour and fucking 10 minutes.

654
00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:52.590
And they try to have a party.
It was more like,
you know,
three hours,
whatever.

655
00:35:52.591 --> 00:35:56.790
They come home early and somehow on my brothers looked upon as the ring leader

656
00:35:56.791 --> 00:36:00.090
and he's running out of the house and the guy knows who he is.

657
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:02.970
My brother's drunk tells him to fuck off and I'll let shit.
So he knows.

658
00:36:02.971 --> 00:36:06.900
So my brother runs home first grade,
he runs all night.
He's,

659
00:36:06.901 --> 00:36:07.950
he's like in high school at this point.

660
00:36:07.951 --> 00:36:11.100
He runs home and as he's coming up to house,
these two shit faced,

661
00:36:11.101 --> 00:36:13.770
he sees my parents,
you know,
the lights are on,
I can't go in the house.

662
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:14.700
So he's so drunk.

663
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:18.840
He literally just fucking face plants in the shrubs behind our house,

664
00:36:18.841 --> 00:36:19.720
right by the side door.

665
00:36:19.721 --> 00:36:23.040
And here's the phone ring and he knows who it is and it's the fucking dad down

666
00:36:23.041 --> 00:36:27.420
the street calling up about my drunk brother and my dad picks up the phone and

667
00:36:27.421 --> 00:36:31.950
he just goes,
hello.
And he hits the guy talking about what are you talking about?

668
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:37.110
And my dad just says hi.
Is that true?
Has that Jay?
I just talked to him.

669
00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:41.430
He's just starts covering for my brother.
He was sober.
Hey,

670
00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:42.870
why's said no sir?

671
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:47.430
He gets in this big argument with the guy and my brother's laying on his back in

672
00:36:47.431 --> 00:36:48.264
the Mulch,

673
00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:51.960
laughing his ass off and then just go on like what a fucking great guy,

674
00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:56.220
like totally covered for my brother.
What was your dad's name?
Huh?
I don't,

675
00:36:56.221 --> 00:37:00.360
I don't put all that shit.
This guy's a legend.
Yeah,
he just doesn't,
he does.

676
00:37:00.361 --> 00:37:02.570
He just spoke to him.
How dare.
Yeah.

677
00:37:02.571 --> 00:37:07.050
And so that became a catchphrase between all the kids whenever we would disagree

678
00:37:07.051 --> 00:37:09.590
with you,
you just go,
no sir,
no set.

679
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.400
That's what he was doing as this guy was saying like,

680
00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:16.050
brothers still get in trouble over from your dad or would your dad just like

681
00:37:16.051 --> 00:37:20.040
boys will be boys?
No,
I think he then just sat down.

682
00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:25.260
Do I got a bunch of classic once there was one time,
uh,
uh,
God,
how do I say this?

683
00:37:25.261 --> 00:37:29.820
I'll get getting my brother in trouble.
I'll get the statue of limitations.
He,
uh,

684
00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:34.410
my brother maybe or maybe not.
It's already great.

685
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:38.790
Vantiff vandalized.
This is another brother vandalized part of the school.

686
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:44.280
So other you're to go into like rape.
They got all the statute of limitations,

687
00:37:44.281 --> 00:37:46.570
man.
Nah,
Nah.
They may not have

688
00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.800
come from this family tree.
You keep your fucking mouth shut no matter what you.

689
00:37:50.801 --> 00:37:54.450
So anyways,
he so don't talk to Tony,
don't talk to Tony.

690
00:37:54.451 --> 00:37:55.710
Tony's got a big fucking mouth.

691
00:37:55.711 --> 00:37:58.860
We're going to handle that problem down in Florida.
So,
uh,

692
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:03.600
whatever they knew he did it and the him and his friends somehow intimidated

693
00:38:03.601 --> 00:38:06.480
this entire grade to not rat them out.

694
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:10.670
So they went down to the principal's office and the,

695
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:11.700
and the principal's office to go.

696
00:38:11.701 --> 00:38:13.710
And I know you did it and he's trying to yell at and Blah Blah Blah.

697
00:38:13.711 --> 00:38:16.350
And they just sat there.
Stone faced going now we didn't do it,
we didn't do it.

698
00:38:16.351 --> 00:38:17.041
Then they did the old,

699
00:38:17.041 --> 00:38:19.980
they separated and then these young and my brother you did it.

700
00:38:19.981 --> 00:38:21.420
And my brother's like,
I didn't do it.
Oh yeah.

701
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:24.690
Well you have friend in there just drop dime on.
Yeah,

702
00:38:24.691 --> 00:38:28.650
my brother didn't fall for it or anything.
So finally the last ditch effort,

703
00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:32.820
the next day my brother gets up,
he's going to school and the principal,

704
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.600
the principal calls dad.
My Dad picks up the phone.
He's like,
hello.

705
00:38:37.601 --> 00:38:39.670
And it's funny cause he liked old stuff.
So we had this old,

706
00:38:39.671 --> 00:38:41.960
like it was a new phone inside and the outside,
it's a little,

707
00:38:41.961 --> 00:38:43.530
you hold the thing up to here.
My Dad.
Yeah,

708
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.240
<v 1>something like that that's on the phone.
Picks it up.
It's like hello.</v>

709
00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:53.470
<v 0>It goes,
this is hey.
Okay.
All right.
He goes,</v>

710
00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.460
what do you mean?
You know he did it but you can't prove it.

711
00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:59.580
And then you hear the guy talking to my desk because I can,

712
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:00.730
I said I don't have time for this shit.

713
00:39:00.731 --> 00:39:05.050
And he just fucking hung up on the guy and my brother drove out and went to
work.

714
00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:06.670
My brother said he got on the bus,

715
00:39:06.671 --> 00:39:09.580
he was in junior high and when he pulled up to the school,

716
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:13.480
that principal is standing outside of the school like rubbing his forehead

717
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:17.870
<v 1>cause he was beaten.
We uh,
we,</v>

718
00:39:17.871 --> 00:39:20.420
I had no such a willpower whatsoever.

719
00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.610
I'll never do time cause I'll roll on the whole neighborhood.

720
00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.980
First Time they ask me I'll be like,
it was bill Burr,
Bill bird that we were at.

721
00:39:26.981 --> 00:39:30.710
Um,
we were at a bar in New Jersey when we were kids.

722
00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.110
We would have rolled on each other.
And then as you get older,

723
00:39:33.111 --> 00:39:35.270
like when I moved to Manhattan,
I lived on 43rd west,

724
00:39:35.271 --> 00:39:37.460
43rd street and it was all like westies in all.

725
00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:41.990
Like the fire station you realize is an only a fire station.
Oh yeah.

726
00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.780
It's like a Jj,
you're going down a,

727
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:46.100
what are you going to the manager's office when you dropped this package off for

728
00:39:46.101 --> 00:39:50.240
me?
I don't know why they have Boston accents on West 43rd street.
And I'm like,

729
00:39:50.241 --> 00:39:53.020
sure.
And then you come back like two hours later and they're like,
Jed,

730
00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.130
you'd do that thing and went to package.
You're like,
yeah.
And they're like,

731
00:39:55.131 --> 00:39:56.900
what was in it?
And you're like,
oh,
I don't know.
I didn't know.

732
00:39:56.901 --> 00:39:59.540
But then you're like,
ah,
I a,
yeah,
good job.
Good job.

733
00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.650
So I go back to Jersey and I remember,
um,

734
00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:08.840
actually I was in high,
I was a senior in high school when we realized like,
oh,

735
00:40:08.841 --> 00:40:11.540
like don't you don't tell like it took it,
we were idiots.

736
00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:12.760
Nobody want to get in trouble because we were,

737
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.510
we were really like fucking pussies.

738
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:19.160
And then I played baseball in high school and the baseball coach was,

739
00:40:19.161 --> 00:40:22.280
was the lieutenant from,
there's one lieutenant,
uh,
excuse me,
detective.

740
00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:24.590
There's one detective in my town.
It's such a small town.

741
00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.650
It's like a thousand people in my town,
Doug Huber.

742
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:31.910
And he was a detective and he's a great guy and he coached our baseball team in

743
00:40:31.911 --> 00:40:36.911
high school and then we all would go to the Verona in and drink and we were all

744
00:40:37.041 --> 00:40:39.920
underage and some guy came from like Cedar Grove,

745
00:40:39.921 --> 00:40:43.670
which is like the archrival and they just fucking beat the shit out of him.

746
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:46.730
Someone stabbed and with like a pocket knife in his legs and duck.

747
00:40:46.731 --> 00:40:48.770
Huber came in and goes,
what happened here?

748
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.470
And everybody said everybody like the bar owner,

749
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:56.260
the grownups and like the teenagers all said I was in the bathroom and I

750
00:40:56.270 --> 00:41:01.270
remember like going Holy Shit and like the revelation at that moment to realize

751
00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:05.060
this will actually work if we all just hold the company line.

752
00:41:05.061 --> 00:41:08.460
Like it was the first and I'm like a senior in high school and I then Doug Huber

753
00:41:08.461 --> 00:41:11.630
gets me alone.
He goes,
I know in your long time Jj,
just tell me what I go.

754
00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.720
I was in the bathroom dog and he goes,
who was in the bathroom with you?

755
00:41:14.721 --> 00:41:16.490
And I said,
I was in the bathroom.

756
00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:19.940
And then he literally like broke it down like person to person to person goes

757
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:23.060
when,
how long were you in the bathroom and you go,
I don't know.

758
00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.080
I was in the bathroom.
Like this shit went on for,

759
00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:29.870
we were there until like the sun came up in this bar and then six months go by,

760
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:32.180
we're playing tournament baseball and uh,

761
00:41:32.181 --> 00:41:35.210
I think we were West Essex school playing baseball and I'm only hitting lead off

762
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.240
and it hit a lead off double.
And the dug Huber,

763
00:41:39.241 --> 00:41:42.440
the detective who was also the coach of the baseball team goes time,
time,

764
00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:45.290
and he just starts jogging off towards like the third base line.

765
00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:47.720
We're in the visitor's dugout and he goes,
JJ.
And I'm like,
all right,

766
00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:49.760
I guess we're switching the sides up because when you go have a seat,

767
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:53.070
and he's like,
I don't know why Joe Morton Gold,
you know,
he,

768
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.760
he switches out and there's a new guy at second base and I'd be sitting on the

769
00:41:55.761 --> 00:41:58.370
bench,
like,
I'm 90,
I don't even know what the fuck just happened.

770
00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:03.560
It's like three innings go by.
I go,
coach.
And he goes,
yeah,
how you doing?
I go,

771
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.350
why'd you pull me?
He goes,
I dunno.
I was in the bathroom

772
00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:13.010
<v 0>six months that I sat on that shit and I was the only way he can laugh.</v>

773
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:14.511
No,

774
00:42:14.511 --> 00:42:18.140
cause I got real I because by then I'd forgotten the whole thing happened and I

775
00:42:18.141 --> 00:42:22.400
thought like,
oh,
like I thought damn scared.
Yeah.
I was a scared kid.

776
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:27.680
I was alone a lot.
Nobody ever told me Shit.
You had brothers at least to go like,

777
00:42:27.681 --> 00:42:29.510
no,
that's not what you do.
You go up to the guy and tell him,

778
00:42:29.511 --> 00:42:32.270
watch your fucking mouth when you were on my sister or whatever like that.
No,

779
00:42:32.271 --> 00:42:34.320
I was just alone on my bike and you know what I was doing.

780
00:42:34.321 --> 00:42:37.910
I take my bike two towns over because nobody knew who I was and I could just

781
00:42:37.911 --> 00:42:42.680
recreate a new identity like,
hi,
I'm Mike Majors.
I just moved and you're like,

782
00:42:42.681 --> 00:42:45.100
which house?
And I'd be like,
all right,
all right.
That'd be like Deniro,

783
00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:48.230
good palace now,
right in there.
That's my ass right in there.

784
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.470
And I would just make up like some new identity for the day and play with new

785
00:42:51.471 --> 00:42:56.330
kids.
Mike Majors,
my fake name,
believe it,
dude.
I,
I,

786
00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.820
I,
like I said,
I stopped,
I stopped fighting,
uh,

787
00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:02.240
getting into fights like somewhere six,
sixth grade,
maybe seventh grade,

788
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:06.380
the kids who were just way too big and I totally got psyched out and intimidated

789
00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.560
right quickly after elementary school.
And I went more to the [inaudible].

790
00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.150
<v 1>The funny thing,
uh,</v>

791
00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:15.830
I wish I fought more like my dad never taught me to fight or always said tell

792
00:43:15.831 --> 00:43:20.100
you tell the teacher and he didn't realize like tells the teacher you out of

793
00:43:20.101 --> 00:43:24.670
your fucking mind,
which is the responsible as far as like,
uh,

794
00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:26.770
and you know,
to tell a kid,

795
00:43:26.771 --> 00:43:28.830
you don't want to tell a kid that beat the shit out of another kid.

796
00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.960
Tell a four year old,
tell the teacher,
you tell a 12 year old,

797
00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:33.280
let's go down in the basement.

798
00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:36.730
You lead with the Jab circle away from the power hand and then the cross,
right?

799
00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.480
You just got to end this because it's never going to end.
But what they,

800
00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:44.440
<v 0>they,
they always forget like how much,
how that's going to reflect on you.</v>

801
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:45.251
And then they always just said,
well,

802
00:43:45.251 --> 00:43:48.700
you shouldn't care what people think about you.
And they know,
well,

803
00:43:48.701 --> 00:43:52.150
if it's not true,
it shouldn't bother you then he's not a real friend of yours.

804
00:43:52.151 --> 00:43:54.870
And then they just send you into this fucking gauntlet.
And even,

805
00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.760
and even if it's not that bad and ass kicking the,

806
00:43:57.761 --> 00:44:00.730
it's the fact that it's your entire life than shame,

807
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:05.580
that it's your existence that,
you know,
it's like,
it's like,
yeah,
mom though.

808
00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:05.971
How would you,

809
00:44:05.971 --> 00:44:08.230
I give you went to work and get the shit kicked out of here every day.

810
00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:12.460
Well that just not your real friends,
mom,
take a different way to your cubicle.

811
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:12.970
You know,

812
00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:16.930
<v 1>none of us knew we could fight.
When I was a junior in high school,</v>

813
00:44:16.931 --> 00:44:19.810
we were in the wrestling room and there was this kid,
Pete Bush,

814
00:44:19.811 --> 00:44:23.830
who was pretty much an albino.
Like,
I'm not,
I don't have the,

815
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:26.730
I don't have the card that anybody signed off on it.
Right?

816
00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.940
But he's pretty much an albino.
And he had like Dick Thick,
thick,
thick,

817
00:44:29.941 --> 00:44:33.890
thick glasses all day long.
Put on the map bastard.

818
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:36.720
The guy was a fucking savage animal and you know,
you know what,

819
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:37.900
he couldn't have been an albino cause.

820
00:44:37.901 --> 00:44:41.480
He got accepted to West Point and pretty sure all bono would not accept an
album.

821
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:46.350
I'm pretty sure it west point has a no albinos policy.
Sorry,

822
00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.300
I blame,
I've never seen one.
I've never seen an alpine.

823
00:44:49.301 --> 00:44:53.370
I think you can be out when the president shows up.
He's not part of that line.

824
00:44:53.371 --> 00:44:56.280
That standing at attention slipping the guns around.
Never.
No,

825
00:44:56.281 --> 00:44:57.960
I don't think you can be an albino at west point.

826
00:44:57.961 --> 00:45:01.090
So I got him up in the tower but he leaves look like,
yeah,
that's where he,

827
00:45:01.091 --> 00:45:03.420
that's where it needs to be shaded.

828
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:06.480
He looked like an albino and he was like a weird guy.
I didn't really talk.

829
00:45:06.481 --> 00:45:07.740
He was like,
he was a genius.

830
00:45:07.741 --> 00:45:12.741
He got accepted to west point and then one day like this big fucking football

831
00:45:13.021 --> 00:45:14.730
guy was just hand peck in the shit out of him.

832
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.920
And Pete Bush wrestled like 118 pounds.

833
00:45:16.921 --> 00:45:20.030
And this other kid was like two 20 and Pete Bush turned around,

834
00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:21.390
shot a double egg,

835
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.440
took the guy's legs out from under them and then just sat on his chest like that

836
00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.020
just punched the shit out of him.
And we were all like laughing like,

837
00:45:28.021 --> 00:45:31.590
did you fucking see what Pete Bush didn't like?
How lucky he got?
How funny what?

838
00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:34.470
And we thought it was funny.
And our wrestling coach,
Jim Sour goes,

839
00:45:34.471 --> 00:45:35.430
you guys think that's funny.

840
00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.430
You guys don't even know what you've been doing and here your whole lives learn

841
00:45:38.431 --> 00:45:40.170
how to fight it.
You fucking idiots.

842
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.710
What do you think some fucking big fat offensive tackle is going to take out?

843
00:45:43.711 --> 00:45:46.740
A guy that's been practicing take downs for the last eight years,

844
00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.940
get your heads out of your ass is like,
he screamed at us.
He goes,
of course,

845
00:45:50.941 --> 00:45:53.400
you know,
is that a fight?
He's a fucking wrestler.
He's,

846
00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.770
and he was like cursing like that for them.
And we're all like,

847
00:45:55.771 --> 00:45:58.440
at that moment were all like,
Holy Shit.

848
00:45:58.441 --> 00:46:00.960
Like you can use these takedowns like out there.

849
00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:04.890
Others just on a mat and they're like,
oh,
the whole thing as a queer singlet.

850
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:07.370
Yeah,
you meet some guy in a mall wants to go at it.

851
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:09.960
You punk out and give me your wallet.
But if there was a mat you'd be like,

852
00:46:09.961 --> 00:46:12.420
all right and you have your little ear muffs things on so you don't give it all

853
00:46:12.421 --> 00:46:15.630
fights.
I know what you're saying is true,
but all fights in MMA,

854
00:46:15.631 --> 00:46:17.520
like it all winds up on the ground.
If you're in a fight,

855
00:46:17.521 --> 00:46:21.120
the parking lot between two parked cars.
I'm sorry if I get you to a need,

856
00:46:21.121 --> 00:46:25.030
that shit is over under how fucking big yard.
Unless you wrestled to get me out.

857
00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:28.020
That's why I have no,
I have just fury.

858
00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.200
I go for about 18 seconds and then you got me.
Then I'm wheezing.

859
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:34.920
Give him everything theory though you think.
When do you let it go?
Let it go.

860
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.190
Okay.
When do you let it,

861
00:46:37.191 --> 00:46:41.760
like why do you like you were assuming that I was screaming at my windshield.

862
00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.010
Could you gave me directions to a separate town?

863
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.880
I was literally under that.
You would slip.

864
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:51.480
Dib come over in the middle of fucking day.
If he fucking podcast,

865
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:54.330
he carried all the way to where the fuck your addresses gives us.

866
00:46:54.331 --> 00:46:58.170
We already knew,
cares you're time isn't valuable.
Yeah,

867
00:46:58.171 --> 00:47:01.320
but I'll be out of here in fucking 10 minutes and I'll drive home and I'll be

868
00:47:01.321 --> 00:47:05.910
with my kids.
I don't know why,
but that's how people responded to adversity.

869
00:47:05.911 --> 00:47:08.670
When I was a kid.
You basically,
you lost your shit.

870
00:47:08.671 --> 00:47:11.970
You called people in and you realize they're alcoholics screamed and inanimate

871
00:47:11.971 --> 00:47:14.550
objects,
but then you realize there's people who are alcoholics.

872
00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:18.870
We all works in progress.
Yes man is God and ruin.

873
00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:24.590
I Dunno.
Maybe my fucking slap those headphones off your fucking head.

874
00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:29.470
I can come over to table smart guy.
You know what?
I'm going both knees.

875
00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:33.440
I'll start on my fucking back.
Your fucking stutter and techie.
Yeah.

876
00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:38.070
Bill actually sent me to another town.
Here's the address.
Jay Glendale.

877
00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:41.520
Turns out it's not Glenn Dale.
Yeah,
it turns out it's a,

878
00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:45.510
it's Glendale at all there.
You know,
I don't know where.

879
00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:48.790
I don't even know what town that says.
No,
come on.
Keep doing more normal.
I,
yeah,

880
00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:54.060
yeah.
The Chicago cubs area,

881
00:47:54.061 --> 00:47:57.720
they got a new mass gat.
Have you heard about this new mascot?
They got there?

882
00:47:58.410 --> 00:48:01.320
You heard about that?
Maskat they gotta know what about him?

883
00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:05.910
His name is Clark is a true,
you know,
and uh,

884
00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:07.160
it's a,

885
00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:12.160
a baby cub with his head on backwards and EA greets fans when they come in.

886
00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:16.650
You know,
a baby cub,
eh,

887
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:18.630
those cubs got a new mascot.
Yeah.

888
00:48:18.631 --> 00:48:22.920
As you get to like a bear tamer when it was lion guys,
you know,

889
00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:26.910
like take care of those cubs there.
I know.
What a baby cub.

890
00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.310
How good a mascot that would be.
You know,

891
00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:34.900
I don't know who the other mass can I maybe a lion tamer.
The Cherry.

892
00:48:34.901 --> 00:48:38.970
Huh?
Can I hear?
Can I hear some Harvey Keitel doing bad.

893
00:48:38.971 --> 00:48:43.840
80 s stand up.
All right.
Um,
I don't mean to put you on the,
no,

894
00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:48.770
I like,
I just know you can find game.
I,
you can do it.
Okay.

895
00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:51.720
I'm just rifling through,

896
00:48:51.721 --> 00:48:54.110
but got to make sure I don't do someone's actual material.

897
00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:58.880
That's the farthest because we all have like fucking 18 minutes of David
Brenner.

898
00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:03.320
You only,
isn't it weird when the vending machine takes up so much noise?
No,

899
00:49:03.321 --> 00:49:06.140
it's not fucking vending machine.
All right.

900
00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:12.960
<v 2>Don't get me started on the girls.
What are you supposed to do?</v>

901
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:16.680
You go and ask her out.
You look your best.

902
00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:22.200
You shaved,
you've come to hear you presented yourself.
She Says No.

903
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:26.940
Then all of a sudden you have to act like you ain't trying to act her out.

904
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.120
Escrow out in the first place.
You Go.
I'm sorry.

905
00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:35.550
There was a clock over your head.
I was trying to find out what time it was.

906
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:39.600
Would you think I wanted a goddamn gates?
You're not that important.

907
00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.330
Get over yourself right now.

908
00:49:42.331 --> 00:49:46.080
I'm wearing mom jeans and a suit jacket with the sleeves rolled up.

909
00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:52.050
What the fuck is the airline thinking?
Why don't you tell me?

910
00:49:52.051 --> 00:49:53.590
The local came

911
00:49:57.810 --> 00:50:02.580
flight attendant comes out.
She's willing occurred.
I have to stay in my seatbelt.

912
00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:04.320
Meanwhile,
his buttons of Gin,

913
00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.670
<v 1>sorry,
I slipped into the colon.
You know,</v>

914
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:11.810
I have to say seatbelt it in,

915
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:15.200
but meanwhile she has a rolling cart with bottles of Gin flying all over the

916
00:50:15.201 --> 00:50:19.160
place.
It loose ice.
I don't know.
That seemed a little in Congress to me.

917
00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:23.910
All right.
There was bill Burke when,
all right.
All right.

918
00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:28.050
All right to my face.
Let's do more.
Fewer.
That's always good to pay

919
00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:31.550
<v 2>off when you do that on a podcast.
That's why I subscribed to build birder.</v>

920
00:50:31.551 --> 00:50:35.270
He would.
Other people want to think it's the bill bird podcast.

921
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:39.950
Who cares what Jesse in Fontana is emailing you about?
Who Cares?

922
00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:42.710
<v 1>Took my face is literally killing me for fucking mine does too.</v>

923
00:50:42.711 --> 00:50:46.190
Or you have to contort to do that stupid cartel voice.
All right,

924
00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:48.770
well what do you got coming up here that we can,
we can hide.

925
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:52.340
When will this be out,
honey?
I'm going to Monday.

926
00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:56.970
I know Monday morning I do Amar.

927
00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:58.780
These ones that just put them out.
Oh,

928
00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:04.790
<v 2>both.
Only one impression I've ever learned.
It wasn't Pachino.</v>

929
00:51:04.791 --> 00:51:08.030
Let me hear that.
Never could do it.
Never could do it.
And then uh,

930
00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:11.030
cause there's two different Pachino Chinos and my mind was all fucked up.

931
00:51:11.031 --> 00:51:15.800
Which one?
Cause Young Pachino sounds like Tyne Daly from Cagney and Lacey.
No,

932
00:51:15.801 --> 00:51:20.060
Sa what?
Vietnam veterans killing don't mean nothing to us.
Attica.
Right.

933
00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.690
Put The gun down new.

934
00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:25.400
We play all their heads when he answered the phone and fucking dog day.

935
00:51:25.401 --> 00:51:28.340
Afternoon.
I can't promise you that.
And I got to talk to my book.

936
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:30.590
If you have a boss,
why am I talking to Yo hi.

937
00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:35.060
And then I dunno when it was somewhere around heat.
Oh,

938
00:51:35.061 --> 00:51:40.061
everything got real heavy on my back and my eyes got real big bell.

939
00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:47.510
You worked with fucking believable.
See I don't even take,
this one's not good,

940
00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:53.060
but I worked with owl on a movie that no one's saw,

941
00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:58.220
but we still did the work.
You already said to me,
I'll tell you,

942
00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:02.450
we were outside and he looked at the sky.
It's just true story.

943
00:52:02.451 --> 00:52:07.451
But I'm to do it as him because it was a break while we were shooting and he

944
00:52:10.221 --> 00:52:13.370
looked up at the moon and he put his arm around me.

945
00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.840
Put his arm around me and he looked at this guy and he said,

946
00:52:17.841 --> 00:52:20.450
that's our moon babe.
That's what he said.

947
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:26.170
Now I say that to my kids and if you and I left here in the moon was out,

948
00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:28.980
I'd say to you,
Bill Byrd,

949
00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:33.740
and I love you fucking,
you're a good man.

950
00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:36.440
Al.
I think we just trying to say,

951
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:41.500
is Jay Moore Edit an interesting experience with you who the fork taught you to

952
00:52:42.051 --> 00:52:43.250
act?
You can't,

953
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:50.000
I don't even know.
Everybody's heard about,
you know,

954
00:52:50.001 --> 00:52:52.910
I didn't like four movies going on at once too.

955
00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:56.420
I think everybody should make love and make one big acting pregnant baby.

956
00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:01.820
That's full circle.
Bill Berg.
Uh,
I'm not the Irvine Improv this weekend,
