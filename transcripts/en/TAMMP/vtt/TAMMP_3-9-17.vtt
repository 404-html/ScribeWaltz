12
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:46.680
I'm taking a cab because I'm old.
I don't do fucking Uber.
I don't do Lyft.

13
00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:49.590
I don't do any of that bullshit.
All right.

14
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.880
Fucking calling somebody and they just pull up in their car.

So pull up to my house and this is fucking

17
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.250
<v 0>okay.</v>

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.600
<v 1>Whatever state truck there for.
These fucking guys are in my yard.</v>

19
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.170
The gates open and one of the guys got a ladder up to the side of my house.

20
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

21
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.250
<v 1>So I just walk in.
I'm like,
ah.
Yeah.
Hey,
what are you guys doing?</v>

22
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.910
And he goes,
Oh God,
some finally somebody is home.

23
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.180
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.510
<v 1>I'm like,
what do you mean my wife didn't let you in?
He was like,
no,</v>

25
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:29.190
there was no answer.
And I'm like,
then what are you doing here?
He goes,
well,

26
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:31.950
you know,
I keep coming by.
There's nobody here.
I got to check the meter.
You know?

27
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:36.240
They said,
you put a new electrical box.
You know,

28
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:39.390
you guys didn't have a home.
I mean,
what was I supposed to do?
I was like,

29
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:43.890
I dunno not coming to my fucking yard.
What did he,
what was I supposed to do?

30
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:46.650
Every time I go to the bank,
the bank's closed.
I mean,
what was I supposed to do?

31
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.510
Come back when they're fucking,
they're yet can't.
He just kept saying,

32
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:55.650
what was I supposed to do?
You're trespassing.
You asshole

33
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.990
fucking.
He just kept saying what and be,
you know something.

34
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:04.620
I actually kept my cooler.
I just calmly said,

35
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:07.200
I dunno not coming to my yard.
I go off my,

36
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:09.150
if I keep going over my neighbor's house and he's not there,

37
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:12.660
that doesn't mean give me a right to go in there.
And he goes,
well,

38
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:15.420
I got to go over.
I've got to get to the pole.
I mean,
you know,

39
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:18.750
when they changed the box,
the only put temporary whatever,

40
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.090
fucking things on there.
I got to put the right things on there.

41
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:25.960
I don't have your phone number.
I'm like,
well,
whose fault is that?
Some I fault.

42
00:02:25.961 --> 00:02:29.140
Nobody asked me if you guys never called me,
or I guess you couldn't call me,

43
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.720
but you should have got from the,
from the electrician.
He goes,
yeah,

44
00:02:31.721 --> 00:02:36.500
the electrician did give it to me.
Like,
oh,
there you go.
So the guy,

45
00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:37.940
the guy is grabbing the ladder,

46
00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:40.130
he takes it down and he's fucking walking out and go,
you know what do you,

47
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:44.700
what do you need to do here?
He goes,
no,
no.
You know,
go get out here.

48
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:47.330
It's just like,
dude,
you don't gotta fucking pout now.

49
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.610
You know what I'm saying is right
fucking walking.

50
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.520
You just open the gate.
You just fucking walk in.
Unbelievable.

51
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.010
I liked the guy.
The other guy immediately was fucking,
you know,

52
00:03:01.011 --> 00:03:03.560
he's looking down.
He knew he was feeling lose.
The guy was wrong.

53
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.220
<v 0>Okay.</v>

54
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.590
<v 1>The guy was basically like,
this is like the third time I come over here,</v>

55
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.410
nobody ever answers the door.
I'm getting sick of this and he just fucking,

56
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.610
I don't know,
climbed over the wall.
I don't know what the gate's locked.

57
00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.680
I don't know how they did it.
Me had a ladder.

58
00:03:16.681 --> 00:03:18.600
I guess you just fucking went right up and over it.

59
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.190
I mean,
what was I supposed to do?
Fuck you made well.
Yes.

60
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.420
What were you supposed to do?

61
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.330
That's the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard.
So then I go,

62
00:03:32.331 --> 00:03:35.240
what do you need to do?
He told me when he did do I go,
all right,

63
00:03:35.241 --> 00:03:36.230
you want to go down and do it?

64
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.450
<v 0>Okay,</v>

65
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.580
<v 1>good to fight.
I mean,
he still did way too much.
Don't,
I don't know.</v>

66
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:47.360
It was the weirdest fucking response ever.
Well,
you know what?

67
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.740
What was I supposed to do?
So,
but I was actually happy that I,

68
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:54.250
I mean I lost my shit on it now thinking about it on the podcast way more than I

69
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:58.690
did in the moment.
And um,
you know,

70
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.910
I said to the guy said,
I'm not trying to be difficult,
but you know,

71
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:05.890
that's what you're doing here is it's not right.
You know,
it's not,

72
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:08.620
I should have said,
oh,
I should've said that.
And you know,
it's not right.

73
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.610
You got impatient and he just said to hell with it.

74
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:15.100
I'm just going to do this anyways and you're trespassing.
You know,

75
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:19.270
you trespassing.
I don't care that your worked for the state.
That doesn't mean,

76
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.410
you know,
I guess you know,
if,
if my fucking house was on fire or they,

77
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.200
the pole or some shit,
there was a live wire hanging from it thing.
Yeah,

78
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:28.210
I guess you have the authority to go up and over.

79
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.680
I don't think you can do that just because you're fucking tired and knocking on

80
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:33.820
the door.
Nobody answers.

81
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.980
<v 0>Okay.</v>

82
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.100
<v 1>Anyway,
sorry.
So I just got back from Phoenix,
Arizona.
I had a,</v>

83
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.170
the best fucking time when I was out there,
ate a bunch of great food,

84
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.560
but all basically I kind of aid mainly down near,
um,
um,

85
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.400
wherever,
wherever the fucking Phoenix Suns play the,
uh,

86
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.940
traveling Riverside resort arena,
whatever the hell they call it.
Um,

87
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.990
had a couple of really cool,
um,
meals when I was down there.

88
00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:06.580
Went to this really good pizza joint.
Um,
good for southwest pizza.

89
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.320
You know what I mean?
Let's not get crazy here.
Right.
And,
uh,

90
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.870
got a good burrito down there.
I didn't work out at all.

91
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.680
I was driving over to see my dog.
I was starving.

92
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.710
I got to fucking whopper with cheese and fucking burger king and all freckles is

93
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.190
a,
that's it.
I'm done.
Um,
I'm officially,

94
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.060
I'm on the wagon for the first time in a year,
like really hardcore on the wagon.

95
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.080
Like I'm fucking done.

96
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.540
There's no drink in insight other than water for me.
Um,

97
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.800
I dunno.
I was,
I was,
uh,
I don't want to happen to me.

98
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:44.410
The last two times I went on the road,
I just spent under a fucking,

99
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:47.350
a lot of stress.
You know,
not sleeping with the kid.

100
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.870
And then I got to put this new hour together and,
uh,

101
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.320
my fucking shoulder is still messed up,

102
00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:58.210
although I finally turned the corner with it.
And,
um,
but you know,

103
00:05:58.211 --> 00:05:59.021
so I'm just,
you know,

104
00:05:59.021 --> 00:06:01.990
I just haven't been able to work out the way I want to and I swear to God,
dude,

105
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.620
I am starting to get dad bod and I have to stop this immediately.

106
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.440
I am too God damn vein.
You know,

107
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.360
you don't want you to just look bad in a tee shirt.

108
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.400
I have a pothead body right now and I do not fucking like it.
Oh,

109
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:21.740
I forgot to tell you still have to deal with that guy.
Hey,
you know,

110
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:23.000
what the fuck was I supposed to do?

111
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.690
I come into my house and there's this strange odor,
like,
what is that?

112
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.290
Is that some hippie candle?
What's going on?

113
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:34.990
And I come downstairs and Nia tells me that a fucking pipe or some shit burst

114
00:06:34.991 --> 00:06:38.840
the night before and all this water came out.
I go,
you gotta be shitting me.

115
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.600
You gotta be shitting me.
And I go,
okay.
Did you,

116
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.660
did you go to the front of the house like I showed you and turned off all the

117
00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:48.464
water?

118
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.393
<v 2>Okay.</v>

119
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.610
<v 1>No,
I turned it off under the sink.
I'm like,
Oh God,
okay.</v>

120
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.860
I'm smelling water.

121
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.460
And then I look at my bedroom ceiling and there's a brown stain just ever so

122
00:07:05.461 --> 00:07:09.870
small,
this little fucking crack.
And I was just like,
oh my God,

123
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.530
not again.
Please tell me not against.
So I run upstairs.

124
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.970
I shut off the main fucking thing.
You know,

125
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.190
this is this thing about these feminists.

126
00:07:20.191 --> 00:07:22.210
They don't want to do fucking housework anymore,
but they,

127
00:07:22.211 --> 00:07:23.790
they're not going to do the guy shit either.

128
00:07:23.791 --> 00:07:27.420
Like no one had a shut the fucking water off.
It's like,

129
00:07:27.421 --> 00:07:30.990
so what exactly are you going to do?
Well,

130
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.990
can watch Mary Tyler Moore reruns.
So it's,
I'm sorry,
whatever.
I'm flying,
uh,

131
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.480
run upstairs of flying out the fucking door.
I shut it off.
And then I,
you know,

132
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.970
now I got my stupid,
can I iPhone flashlight.
You know,

133
00:07:45.971 --> 00:07:49.810
because the fucking guys outside checking the box and cut off the electricity,

134
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:50.980
the water's off.

135
00:07:50.981 --> 00:07:55.720
Now this is just basically a glorified fucking log cabin and I'm going through

136
00:07:55.721 --> 00:07:59.270
the crawl spaces and all this shit and I'm trying to find out where this water

137
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:03.430
is coming from.
Has It collected?
Is the ceiling going to collapse?

138
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:08.500
What is going on?
And um,
fortunately I think,
I think we're all right.

139
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.130
Um,
and it was also fresh water.

140
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.400
So I don't think you need guys like you don't have to deal with mold,

141
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.790
which I don't know if that makes sense to me.
I mean,

142
00:08:18.791 --> 00:08:22.030
it doesn't also depend on what the fuck's in the inside the pipe.
I have no idea.

143
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.480
I'm sure there's going to be a bunch of people tweeting at me make scaring the

144
00:08:25.481 --> 00:08:29.980
shit out of me.
So that's basically what I came home too.
But the plumber came by,

145
00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:32.020
change the fucking thing that needed to be changed.

146
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.230
Hopefully everything's gonna be all right.
But I once again,

147
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.003
<v 2>you know,</v>

148
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.430
<v 1>everybody in your house,</v>

149
00:08:39.431 --> 00:08:43.150
I'm telling you right now needs to know how to shut off the fucking water.

150
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:46.973
<v 2>Everybody.</v>

151
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.431
<v 1>In fact,</v>

152
00:08:48.431 --> 00:08:51.760
that's the first thing I'm going to teach my daughter when she starts walking

153
00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:53.530
around.
You know what I mean?

154
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.090
When she understands concept of water and what it can do to your house.

155
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.050
All right.
And I'm just going to be like,
look,
the next time a fucking,

156
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.250
I swear the next I'm going to get rid of this house.
I'm done with it.

157
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.620
Fuck this house.
I've had it.

158
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:11.210
<v 0>Okay.</v>

159
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.300
<v 1>I've just had it with his fucking house.
You know,</v>

160
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.630
it's my old Goddam faults would have when you buy a 100 year old fucking house

161
00:09:17.631 --> 00:09:20.240
that has a lot of character,
you know,

162
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.340
<v 0>okay,</v>

163
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.600
<v 1>I'm going to sell this fucking house and I am going to buy some brand new home</v>

164
00:09:26.601 --> 00:09:30.260
depot doubt.
No character whatsoever.
I mean,

165
00:09:30.261 --> 00:09:32.030
I want it to look like a fucking food corn.

166
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.410
I don't give a shit as long as everything's brand new in it.
No,

167
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.610
don't mind like the people won't put it together.
Right.

168
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:41.210
And I'll still have the problems,
but um,

169
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.510
I was literally when I was in the crawl space.
Right.

170
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:47.750
<v 0>Okay.</v>

171
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:51.730
<v 1>Tell these fucking cobwebs and all that.
I just,
it just,
it was it.</v>

172
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.380
I officially fell out of love with this house and I was like,
you know what?

173
00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:01.480
Fuck this house.
You know why?
You know you went house,
you fucking win.

174
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.570
You probably down.
Cool Hand Luke.

175
00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:10.190
You finally fucking did it.
What's your dirt do?
Doing the boss man's hole.

176
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.710
That's what this house has been doing me the entire fucking time I've lived
here.

177
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.860
I Dunno boss.
We got to get it out of there.

178
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.590
What's your dirt doing?
The boss man's yard.
I don't know boss.

179
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:29.973
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

180
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.530
<v 1>Ah Fuck.
Anyways,
homeownership,</v>

181
00:10:35.531 --> 00:10:37.900
you know they always show all the young couple on TV,

182
00:10:37.901 --> 00:10:42.100
fucking smiling and all that shit.
They had a fucking show me my fucking

183
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.880
whopper with cheese.
Fucking body crawling around a goddamn crawl space.

184
00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:50.050
Well of course.
What you're going to walk around across space bill.

185
00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.060
<v 0>Okay,</v>

186
00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:56.480
<v 1>so then I fucking
thank God.
It's all right.</v>

187
00:10:56.481 --> 00:10:59.750
So then I leave,
I go down to take care of all the bills and all of this shit.

188
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.620
So why the podcasts late is late and I'm like,
all right,

189
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.690
I gotta I gotta pick up a salad or something.

190
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.130
I gotta start on the right foot here and uh,
you know,

191
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:15.320
typical la thing.
Oh,
this is a place I want to be.
Um,
that's a restaurant that,

192
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.790
you know,
40 people can eat at and there's four parking spots,

193
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:24.740
two of which are taken by the cook in the manager and the other two are taken by

194
00:11:24.741 --> 00:11:28.580
the fucking wait staff.
So as always,
there's no fucking place to park.

195
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:34.220
And I turned the corner.
Lo and behold,
there's a fucking spot.
And um,

196
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.480
I went down and turned around like a gentleman and of course someone else said,

197
00:11:38.481 --> 00:11:41.780
fuck that.
And they made the three point turn into the God damn parking spot.

198
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.730
Took my fucking pocket spot.

199
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.570
<v 0>Okay.</v>

200
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.520
<v 1>And uh,
that,
and then I,
then that was it.
That was enough.
All my meditation,</v>

201
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:53.400
everything went out the fucking window.
And uh,
you know,

202
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.950
so I had my first fucking meltdown in a while and weeks,

203
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.790
my first meltdown in weeks.
And then I basically,

204
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:05.470
I went from yelling at the guy who fucking took my,
took my parking spot.

205
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:10.030
It was my parking spot,
right?
He got there first.
I,
I saw it first,

206
00:12:10.031 --> 00:12:13.120
but he fucking made a better move and he gave,
he boxed me up like,
you know,

207
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:13.954
he got the rebound.

208
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:15.770
<v 0>Okay.</v>

209
00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:20.770
<v 1>I went from yelling at bout him in the car to myself to yelling even louder</v>

210
00:12:21.141 --> 00:12:25.640
about the electrician to yelling even louder about shutting the fucking water

211
00:12:25.641 --> 00:12:28.910
off.
The second is of God damn problem.
Um,

212
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:30.930
<v 0>yeah.</v>

213
00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.960
<v 1>And then I found a pocket squad and I got out</v>

214
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.250
and I think I was yelling so loudly like somebody walking by was looking at me

215
00:12:40.251 --> 00:12:44.570
all fucking weird and I,
I dunno,
whatever.
I had a little bit of a setback.
But uh,

216
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:48.920
anybody out there if you'd like to buy a house with a lot of character,
oh,

217
00:12:48.921 --> 00:12:51.560
this is how this house is a character.
I'll tell you,

218
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.060
it'll have you scratching your head.
Um,

219
00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.130
maybe I'll sell this.
I mean,
talk to me about this.

220
00:12:59.131 --> 00:13:02.320
Maybe I'll sell this fucking house and we'll just do the,
do the,
uh,

221
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:08.190
moving is one of those soulless fucking high rises.
You know,

222
00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.190
you know those things that people do.
The empty nesters do well,

223
00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:13.110
they just don't want to deal with the fucking house anymore,

224
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:15.480
which I never understood.
It's like,
why the fuck would you want to?

225
00:13:15.481 --> 00:13:18.390
We'd live in your house.
All the kids are out of there,
you know,

226
00:13:18.391 --> 00:13:20.660
you know you've got all these spaces.
It's going to be great now.

227
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.940
Right now I know why.
Now I know why.

228
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:24.760
<v 0>Okay.</v>

229
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.660
<v 1>Oh,
do I know why?
Cause this shit's going to happen.</v>

230
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

231
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.440
<v 1>Yeah,
I,
I completely fucking get it now.</v>

232
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:38.140
Like I don't give a fuck about a view.
I don't give a fuck about,
you know,

233
00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:40.540
old school shit.
I don't give a fuck about anything.

234
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.860
All I give a fuck about is if something breaks,
it's not on me.
How,

235
00:13:44.861 --> 00:13:47.940
where can I live like that?
I might go back to renting

236
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.000
this house is just,
it's just a fucking,
it's a motherfucker.
I'm never again,

237
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.870
I'm telling you right now,

238
00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.260
don't have a buy a fucking old house unless you are handy.
You know,

239
00:14:00.261 --> 00:14:04.100
or unless you just like making your life fucking difficult.
I'm telling you,

240
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.290
this is the classic,

241
00:14:06.291 --> 00:14:10.490
this is what means versus you were laughing about all week was how he makes his

242
00:14:10.491 --> 00:14:15.250
life easy.
I make my life difficult.
He buys a fucking house,
the last fucking guy,

243
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:19.700
three dead,
the whole thing he gets,
he turnkey.
I need to be more Versie.

244
00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:24.050
I gotta I gotta I gotta I gotta fucking do that.
My next fucking place.

245
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.490
I don't give a shit what it is.
I'll buy a fucking Winnebago brand new though.

246
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.850
Just live in that right where bill,

247
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:34.530
you just don't fucking parking spots out here.

248
00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:36.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

249
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.810
<v 1>I Dunno.
I'm sorry.
Anyways,
so I'm going to be Billy elliptical head,</v>

250
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.760
Billy fucking no booze bag and we've eaten salads and all this fucking shit and

251
00:14:44.761 --> 00:14:47.610
I,
you know,
I got to get this under control,

252
00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:50.370
disgusted with myself,
you know,

253
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.860
it's time to walk and the fucking bathroom mirror and just trashed myself,

254
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.620
you know,
take the shirt off.
Let's see what it is.
You know?

255
00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.200
<v 0>Okay.</v>

256
00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.660
<v 1>It looked like Tom Brady.
I just first way in,
you know,</v>

257
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.370
when he was a college student,

258
00:15:02.371 --> 00:15:05.440
just eating Cheetos and he was like a third string quarterback or some shit.

259
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:06.720
<v 0>Okay,</v>

260
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.000
<v 1>well I know it was like his face.
I look like his stomach.</v>

261
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.150
<v 2>Okay.</v>

262
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:18.340
<v 1>Just no muscle tone whatsoever.
I'm exaggerating,
but in me,
I don't know.</v>

263
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.360
It's not a,
it's not what I want.
It's not what I want to say.

264
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:26.310
You know what I mean?
It's Christ.

265
00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.070
It's like my belly is to the point is going to be like,

266
00:15:29.071 --> 00:15:31.320
when I stand in the shower,
my knees aren't going to get it.
Wet

267
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:36.780
feet are totally dry,
you know?
Um,
but you know something,
I'm not that bad,

268
00:15:36.781 --> 00:15:38.030
but that's the road I'm heading on.

269
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.880
And I was sitting on a plane today watching all these fucking people who just

270
00:15:41.881 --> 00:15:45.810
destroy their bodies.
Just getting on the plane,
just getting on a fucking plane.

271
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:49.020
They're like winded from walking down that movable hallway,

272
00:15:49.021 --> 00:15:52.230
whatever you call that.
It's not the tarmac.
When did,
what did they call that?

273
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.910
The jet way
people.

274
00:15:55.911 --> 00:16:00.911
Could you put your coats under the seat in the overhead compartment so we can

275
00:16:01.551 --> 00:16:03.530
expedite the boarding process.

276
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.900
We still have a lot of peoples standing.
I'm on the jetway.

277
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.960
We want to have an on time departure.
Um,

278
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:15.020

<v 0>you know,</v>

280

There's gotta be something amazing though</v>

281
00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.550

282
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.340

285

you want a devil dog?
Yeah.

286
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.780
Do,
do you want to get a Burrito?
Sure.
Absolutely.

287
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:49.240
What do you feel like having a cheeseburger,
French fries and a chocolate malt.

288
00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:50.290
<v 0>Okay.</v>

289
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.550
<v 1>You know,
it's like you basically,</v>

290
00:16:51.551 --> 00:16:54.580
you're eating like a fucking eight year old whose parents aren't home your

291
00:16:54.581 --> 00:16:58.330
entire life.
You don't,
you know,
when your parents took off,
that was it.

292
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.290
You went to the enemy,
you're eating a fucking Entenmann's cake.

293
00:17:01.291 --> 00:17:04.480
Cause some donuts of those store bought fucking donuts.

294
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.400
Those ones where it was like,
it was like four plane for powdered for cinnamon.

295
00:17:09.401 --> 00:17:12.730
Do they still make those things?
We had those things all the time.

296
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.850
I used to eat a goddamn at IAA,
absolute shit when I was growing up.

297
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:19.160
<v 0>Okay.</v>

298
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.030
<v 1>Then you went outside,
you ran around and just burned it off.</v>

299
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:28.830
You have a fucking blew out.
Your rotator cuff is a fucking seven,

300
00:17:28.831 --> 00:17:32.340
eight year old you injury free brand new fucking car.
You know what?

301
00:17:32.341 --> 00:17:36.840
My Body's like,
my body's like this house just fucking old as shit.

302
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:38.810
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

303
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:39.291
<v 1>I can't wait.</v>

304
00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:42.890
You know how they can like grow an ear and I'd fucking petri dish now I swear to

305
00:17:42.891 --> 00:17:45.320
God,
Ay,
I,
you know they got to do that.
Like

306
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:48.580
it's going to happen man.

307
00:17:48.581 --> 00:17:51.650
When they stick they can borrow all the organs and they can grow all your

308
00:17:51.651 --> 00:17:54.350
fucking body parts up over again.
I'm telling you right now,

309
00:17:54.351 --> 00:17:57.590
it's going to be like,
your body's going to be like a a

310
00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.990
I will,
you know it,
but they probably still would look old,

311
00:18:01.991 --> 00:18:04.030
but it looks like one of those Resto Mod.
Thanks.

312
00:18:04.031 --> 00:18:07.580
You know which brand new underneath.
But on top it looks at,
you know,

313
00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:12.310
like in 1960 whatever is any of this fucking make it sense?

314
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.340
I mean,
what was I supposed to do?
I mean,

315
00:18:15.341 --> 00:18:17.800
I knocked on your door three times and there was nobody here,

316
00:18:17.801 --> 00:18:20.100
so I just figured I'd walk in your fucking yard,

317
00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.940
put a ladder up next to your house.

318
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

319
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:25.440
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
You know what I mean?</v>

320
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.620
Can you imagine if somebody did that at Ted Nugent's house?

321
00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.440
How many fucking bows and arrows would that guy have?

322
00:18:32.441 --> 00:18:34.350
And there's stupid construction hat.

323
00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:35.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

324
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.970
<v 1>What do you get the hardhat on?
Fourth?
This is like,
like that's going to help.</v>

325
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.140
Like when you fall off the ladder,
that thing doesn't fall off with you.

326
00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.970
Maybe that's why he did it.
He had his hat so fucking tidy wasn't even thinking.

327
00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:50.383
Um,

328
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.450
<v 0>okay.</v>

329
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.300
<v 1>Anyway,
so I was on the road and last night,
um,</v>

330
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:57.270
I missed a Celtics beat the Golden State Warriors.
Holy Shit.

331
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.820
I got that game tape.
They've got to watch that.

332
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:04.230
And the Bruins beat the fuck out of the Detroit red where they beat him up,

333
00:19:04.231 --> 00:19:09.210
but they scored six goals.
Man.
Um,
that's to try weird Redwing so you know,

334
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:13.470
one of the original six,
they,
I mean they did,
they play in hockey town.
Everybody,

335
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.130
there's a town out there where you play hockey.
There's a town,

336
00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:22.080
I know where the hipsters go.
Gold bedrock,
walnut,
twitch,
twitch.

337
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:23.460
Let me read some.
Um,

338
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.890
how many goaltenders by the way did Z,
cause I've watched the highlights.

339
00:19:28.891 --> 00:19:33.270
It was every one of them was a bad goal or your defense just gave it away.

340
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.840
You know,
my condolences to the,
uh,

341
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.460
all the players on the red wings today.

342
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:42.280
I can't imagine how fucking horrific your practices.
All right.

343
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.270
Uh,
the Black Tux.
Oh,
you know,

344
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.460
I saw when I was in Phoenix I saw Reggie fucking mail.

345
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.260
It's fucking amazing.

346
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.760
You walked right by me and I just watched a waiting for an elevator.

347
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.940
I just kept thinking like that guy lit up the garden

348
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.650
turn around is spike Lee and made the choke sign.
And they just look,

349
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:08.990
he's just standing there waiting for an elevator.
Totally relaxed.
Totally.

350
00:20:08.991 --> 00:20:11.300
She does need to talk shit,
right?

351
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:16.510
He's the shit that's Reggie fucking Miller hits at three steals the inbound pass

352
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.760
runs behind the three wasn't good enough to get them for two fucking hits

353
00:20:22.761 --> 00:20:26.990
another three point or turns around and looks at fucking spike Lee does the

354
00:20:26.991 --> 00:20:31.890
church in the garden?
I mean that's the,
it's fucking

355
00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:33.040
<v 0>okay.</v>

356
00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.701
<v 1>Do you ever have to,</v>

357
00:20:33.701 --> 00:20:36.730
do any of you ever got to have to accomplish anything else after that?

358
00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:43.450
If I ever did some shit like that.
Oh for God sakes,

359
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:48.810
if I ever did some shit that,
you know what?
I got to take this.
Hang on a second.

360
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.940
All right.
I'm back.

361
00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:55.330
I swear to God it didn't have a fucking sense and have a fucking ads.

362
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:56.650
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

363
00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.940
<v 1>You know,
you don't say,
Gee Gee,
I just wish you could just for one day,</v>

364
00:21:00.941 --> 00:21:03.760
save one day of being a kid.
You know what I mean?

365
00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:08.761
Just to go back for 24 fucking hours and not have to deal with this fucking shit

366
00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:10.390
of being an adult.

367
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:12.610
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

368
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.110
<v 1>Good fucking Lord.</v>

369
00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.980
You want that fucking phone call was about about some sort of fucking tax

370
00:21:17.981 --> 00:21:20.080
abatement for some bullshit.

371
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.210
I don't even know what the fuck they're talking about.

372
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.470
You need to go onto the website and didn't give a fuck you,
I don't want to.

373
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.040
It's an abatement.
You'll get money back.
You know what?
Just fuck.

374
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.460
How about you just keep it.
If you just keep it,

375
00:21:33.461 --> 00:21:38.140
can I just not fucking waste those precious second one a big fucking get.

376
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.700
What if a tree falls on me tomorrow?

377
00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.130
<v 0>Okay.</v>

378
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:46.130
<v 1>This is one of my last fucking days and I went to www.fuckingabatement.to</v>

379
00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:51.990
whatever the fuck.
I just don't care.
Sorry.

380
00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:55.560
I'm in such a country mood.
I had such a great fucking three days.

381
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.530
You know what it is coming home and there's somebody on a fucking ladder you

382
00:21:58.531 --> 00:22:02.520
don't even know.
Just walked into your goddamn house or your,
you're,
you're,

383
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:03.460
you're on your,

384
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:08.580
on your proper tie and then a pipe burst and yell and the powers that be don't

385
00:22:09.421 --> 00:22:12.180
go fucking shit off the goddamn water and you've got a brown spot.

386
00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.040
You know when you're sealing it up.
Actually a little salty.

387
00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:22.500
What I'm saying?
I was talking about Reggie Miller,
right?
I was just saying,

388
00:22:22.501 --> 00:22:26.520
if I fucking,
if I did,
what the fuck that guy did,
I would,
I would have that

389
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.260
playing on a loop on my phone.

390
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.880
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

391
00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:32.510
<v 1>right.</v>

392
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:35.930
The video and I would just walk around holding it up as I walked towards other

393
00:22:35.931 --> 00:22:39.750
human beings.
The be it,
you know,

394
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:42.000
to credible.
What the fuck that guy did.

395
00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.970
Just standing there waiting for an elevator.
All right.
Let me read a little bit.

396
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.640
Do you get here for a little advertising it?

Everybody.

397
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.570

Uh,

I,

410
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.090
I'd rather jump out the fucking window.

411
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.680

They were building my fucking house.

435
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.700
You know,
I tweeted about this,
um,

436
00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.450
does anybody know where people in the NBA get their tattoos?

437
00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.150
Were 90% of them go to get their tattoos.

438
00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:32.500
They did the highest paid of the four sports,
I believe at this point.
And it,

439
00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.510
you wouldn't know it by looking at the tattoos,

440
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:39.880
Jesus Christ with the area codes and the hole,
the fucking highway signs,

441
00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:44.770
you know,
I guess those could be cool if,

442
00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:49.330
if you actually took the time to like,
I dunno where they get them done.

443
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:54.280
They,
they're,
they look horrible.
Um,

444
00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.620
I don't have anything funny to say about it.

445
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:59.020
I'm just always watching NBA hoop and they just,
they're all,

446
00:25:59.021 --> 00:26:00.780
everybody's scribbled all over.

447
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:07.010
You can't make out anything of what anything is.

448
00:26:07.011 --> 00:26:08.560
It's just a bunch of fucking shit.

449
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.860
Like for an NBA guy,
we'll get a fucking tattoo of his baby's face on his neck.

450
00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:17.853
<v 0>Okay.</v>

451
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:20.390
<v 1>Then you got to look at that for the rest of his fucking career.</v>

452
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:21.770
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

453
00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.480
<v 1>Open.
He's like that guy in the globe trotters.</v>

454
00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:26.090
It also wore fucking headband around his neck.
I remember that guy.

455
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.300
Whatever his fucking name was.
Anyways,
blue apron,
everyone,

456
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:35.150
blue apron.
Not all ingredients are created equal,
fresh,

457
00:26:35.151 --> 00:26:37.580
high quality ingredients.
Make a real difference.

458
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.160
So it's important to know where your food comes from.

459
00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:43.360
I would not want to know where that fucking whopper with cheese came from.

460
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.590
Talk about your personal experience with Blue Apron.
I've never fucking used it,

461
00:26:47.591 --> 00:26:51.880
but I've got to use it now.
That's maybe that's how I'll get in shape.
You know?

462
00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:56.380
I'll be like Oprah.
I love it Bro.
You know,

463
00:26:56.381 --> 00:26:58.770
do one of those things and maybe I can have a giant fucking house.

464
00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:02.280
It doesn't fall apart.
You know what?

465
00:27:02.281 --> 00:27:04.530
I lie like potato chips.

466
00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.760
Can anybody pinpoint the year?
She officially went insane.

467
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:18.620
She's just been famous too fucking long.

468
00:27:18.621 --> 00:27:21.230
I think it just makes you go crazy after.
Well,

469
00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:26.840
everybody's always excited to meet you.
They're always given you a fucking award.

470
00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.290
There's no way to keep your feet on the ground and then you just think

471
00:27:30.291 --> 00:27:34.400
everything you're saying is interesting or exciting to the fucking point.

472
00:27:34.401 --> 00:27:36.900
You'll just scream something like,
I love

473
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:46.070
sitting in a giant fucking yard.
Every time I see her,
I'm just like,

474
00:27:46.071 --> 00:27:49.460
what is she doing?
Chase is Christ Oprah.

475
00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.530
Just go to a fucking hot dog stand.
You know?
Stand in line.
Wait,

476
00:27:54.531 --> 00:27:57.970
you fucking turn and eat the thing.
Just do that every once in awhile.

477
00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:03.320
Just fucking
who likes God case.

478
00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.520
And he goes,
fucking

479
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.840
know her cult of women that just hanging on our every word,

480
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.350
just hoping maybe this complete stranger on TV.

481
00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:20.110
She's the one that's going to make me happy.
I mean that,

482
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.100
that's the saddest part of watching one of those Oprah shows and even know she

483
00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:23.701
does it anymore.

484
00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:26.940
I'm just gonna pretend the show still on the fucking air was all those women

485
00:28:26.941 --> 00:28:31.110
that sat in the crowd,
the fucking look of hope on their face.

486
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:33.163
<v 0>You know,</v>

487
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.200
<v 1>I always wanted to see,
you know,</v>

488
00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:39.420
what they should have had next door was the sea of men that all those fucking

489
00:28:39.421 --> 00:28:42.060
poor women were married to.
You know,

490
00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.610
that fucking motley crew of insensitive,

491
00:28:44.611 --> 00:28:47.730
constant never told them they were pretty or whatever the fuck they needed.

492
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.530
Whatever they needed,
they weren't getting there.

493
00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.290
They would go down to the studio audience.

494
00:28:52.291 --> 00:28:54.540
So just fucking sit there with that fucking

495
00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:00.280
thank you ever watch one of those shows with is like 10 whores and they're all

496
00:29:00.281 --> 00:29:03.730
fucking fighting over some nerdy guy and that look of hope they have,

497
00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:07.330
if they're going to get the fucking,
you know,
get handed a slipper,

498
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.490
which means they're going to be there for another week,
whatever the fuck,

499
00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:14.490
whatever it is they do,
they all had that look on their face.
Um,

500
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.250
do you know what,
as much as I'm making fun of Oprah,
I also like bread.

501
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.970
But no matter how fresh it is,
no matter how much I like it,

502
00:29:21.971 --> 00:29:26.590
if someone was standing in a big yard yelling that it would make me

503
00:29:26.591 --> 00:29:28.930
uncomfortable and it would take away from the experience.

504
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.943
<v 0>You know,</v>

505
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.710
<v 1>it's gotta be weird to be part of her fucking staff.</v>

506
00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:36.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

507
00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:41.000
<v 1>Just every once in a while,
just hear yelling random things cost dumb.</v>

508
00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:44.443
<v 0>Okay.</v>

509
00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:49.600
Yeah,

510
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.730
<v 1>I bet Steadman knows that a block that out,
Huh?</v>

511
00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.210
That's what she has those giant fucking houses.

512
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:58.120
She probably likes to sound the Echo,
you know,

513
00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.470
she's like Rosebud level famous citizen Kane.

514
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.770
What the fuck was I to all blue apron,
everybody for less than $10 per month?

515
00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:13.660
No per person per meal.

oh my God.
So my,

525
00:30:48.301 --> 00:30:51.610
I made a reference to Whitney Houston drowning in a bathtub like that.

You don't.

565
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.470
Once they said a hundred percent satisfaction guarantee,

566
00:33:19.471 --> 00:33:23.460
I immediately started thinking of fast times at Ridgemont high.
You know,

567
00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:28.740
it's 700 a hundred percent satisfied.
I don't want to,
I want to read front Brad.

568
00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.890
Mostly if you don't shut up when you kick 100% of your ass,

569
00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:36.090
I'm sorry.
If you make a mistake,

570
00:33:36.091 --> 00:33:40.470

571
00:33:40.471 --> 00:33:45.060
order,
they'll remake the blinds for you for free.
You want samples?
They're free.

572
00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:49.770
You like shipping,
it's free.
It's all built into the price somewhere.

573
00:33:49.771 --> 00:33:53.040
There's a crying child putting all this shit together in a third world country,

574
00:33:53.041 --> 00:33:56.610
but you don't need to think about that.
You just close those blinds.

575
00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:59.370
He closed those blinds and you never hear him crying.

576

00:34:08.701 --> 00:34:09.540

581
00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:20.970

588
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:37.900
<v 0>Okay.</v>

589
00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:41.200
<v 1>Well.
Okay,
then.
Then you want to turn it the other way?
Yeah.</v>

590
00:34:41.201 --> 00:34:44.260
Turn it the other way and then yes,
they'll close.
Are they closing?

591
00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:48.790
You are seeing less of the outside.
Okay.
Okay.
Do you have any more questions?

592
00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:53.290

you know,

00:38:32.351 --> 00:38:35.450
it was just some things that needed to be said.
All right.

650
00:38:35.451 --> 00:38:38.660
I don't know what to talk about next.
Sorry.

Oh Hey,
by the way,
you know what?

652
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:44.630
I heard that uh,

653
00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.860
that sneaker shit that I was saying actually ended up on some big sneaker

654
00:38:48.861 --> 00:38:53.110
websites,
so I must be getting fucking trashed on that one.
You know,

655
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.340
I had no idea that,
you know,
I knew people were just sneakers.

656
00:38:55.341 --> 00:38:58.730
I didn't realize I went and told him that much.
You know,

657
00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:01.430
I actually bought a new pair of sneakers this week when I was out in Phoenix.

658
00:39:01.431 --> 00:39:05.570
I got the classic fucking shell toes.
That's what I got.
You know,

659
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:08.930
cause a lot of people were suggesting that I wore those fucking,
you know,

660
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:15.050
you know those giant Chunky fucking sneakers that people with feet problem use.

661
00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:18.950
You know,
I don't wear those.
Although I do have the Steve Jobs,
new balance,

662
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:24.020
you know,
if you look at it,
it's the Daytona 500 texture I believe I'm wearing,

663
00:39:24.021 --> 00:39:26.330
I'm there.
I did have a nice pair of sneakers,

664
00:39:26.331 --> 00:39:28.610
but I was not going to wear them to the Daytona 500.

665
00:39:28.611 --> 00:39:32.750
So maybe I have a little sneaker head make,
right?
Maybe,
I don't know.

666
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.780
I wear the shittiest pair of sneakers.
I had to go to Alan,

667
00:39:35.781 --> 00:39:40.140
that fucking track with all the God damn oil and shit all over the place.
Um,

668
00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:44.360

I want to thank everybody that came out to stand up live.

670
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:53.180

Paul brosy crushed it and all week and uh,
I just had it,

671
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:55.010

677
00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:02.283
<v 3>No.</v>

678
00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.110
<v 4>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

679
00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:25.111
It's still burn Monday morning podcast 20 past nine on Monday morning and cloudy

680
00:41:27.281 --> 00:41:31.930
day out here in La as it is the rainy season and a,

681
00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.640
I actually have some guests over here,
so this is kind of be quiet,

682
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:38.270
kind of a quiet podcast.
Um,

683
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:42.080
cause I also have to do the,
uh,
I have some friends in town from out of town,

684
00:41:42.081 --> 00:41:47.060
so we have to do all the La Shit.
Um,
and I gotta be honest with you,

685
00:41:47.061 --> 00:41:50.210
I'm trying to think what the La should is because I'm still new out here.

686
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.620
You know,
when I lived in New York,
I knew what that meant.
You know,

687
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:57.920
that meant they wanted to go to the top of the empire state building.

688
00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:03.080
They wanted to go to the Statue of Liberty,
uh,

689
00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.540
Times Square.
Basically.

690
00:42:05.541 --> 00:42:09.110
They wanted to go every place that a new Yorker never goes.

691
00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:14.870
And,
uh,
so what my mission always was whenever I had,
um,
you know,

692
00:42:14.871 --> 00:42:17.510
friends coming down to visit New York City was,

693
00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:23.090
I immediately tried to convince them that all the things that they wanted to

694
00:42:23.091 --> 00:42:27.050
see,
they didn't really want to see.
And,
um,

695
00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:31.730
I like to think I was doing them a favor,
but,
uh,
you know,

696
00:42:31.731 --> 00:42:33.110
part of it was selfish cause you know,

697
00:42:33.111 --> 00:42:37.020
I'm not fucking getting on a boat to climb up into a statue that's looking out

698
00:42:37.021 --> 00:42:41.630
into the ocean.
You know what I mean?
It's like,

699
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:45.770
you know,
I dunno,
he wanted to talk about underrated.
Overrated.
Okay.

700
00:42:45.771 --> 00:42:48.590
Overrated climbing up into the statue of Liberty.

701
00:42:48.591 --> 00:42:51.950
If you can even still do it with the whole nine,
11

702
00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:55.280
America or whatever that we live in now.

703
00:42:55.281 --> 00:42:57.350
I don't even know if you're allowed to fucking do it anymore.

704
00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.350
I'm sure they'll let you if they like,
you know,

705
00:43:00.351 --> 00:43:04.100
if you let them fingerprint you and scan your fucking retinas.
But,
um,

706
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:10.070
anyways,
um,
I don't,
I always feel like when you go to a city,
like personally,
I,

707
00:43:10.071 --> 00:43:14.060
you know,
I want to do a few tours the things,
but,
uh,

708
00:43:14.061 --> 00:43:17.210
I want to hang out with the locals because they always know the good bars and

709
00:43:17.211 --> 00:43:21.950
the restaurants and that type of shit.
Um,
so that's what I used to try to,

710
00:43:21.951 --> 00:43:25.280
you know,
convince people like,
but it's hard sometimes.

711
00:43:25.281 --> 00:43:26.510
Sometimes you just got to give him,

712
00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:31.540
like when my parents came down and they wanted to eat at Mickey Mantle's on 57th

713
00:43:32.961 --> 00:43:36.770
street,
59th Street and uh,
you know,

714
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.650
you just can't stop people from doing shit like that.
You know,

715
00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.370
there's a great burger.
No,
no it isn't.

716
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:48.170
It's a gray is a touristy burger and it's fucking $18 more than it needs to be

717
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:51.770
because when you look out the window,
you can see central park.

718
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:55.460
What is wrong with you Mickey?
Mantle's yeah,
it's great.
Let's then,

719
00:43:55.461 --> 00:43:57.620
let's go get a hot dog at Wade Boggs.

720
00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.930
The fuck does Mickey Mantle know about making a burger?
Okay.

721
00:44:02.931 --> 00:44:04.880
If you want to go boozing and Mickey Mouse.
Oh,

722
00:44:04.881 --> 00:44:08.690
that's a low blow fucking dead legend.
What the fuck is wrong with me?

723
00:44:08.691 --> 00:44:10.820
I apologize.
The Yankee fans over that when I shouldn't.

724
00:44:10.821 --> 00:44:15.240
And sports fans in general,
you know,
making man,

725
00:44:15.241 --> 00:44:17.420
I'll never did steroids.
Diddy,

726
00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:21.490
granted they didn't exist back then and uh,
I got to tell you something.

727
00:44:21.491 --> 00:44:24.620
It's too bad he didn't and it's too bad they didn't exist back then because we

728
00:44:24.621 --> 00:44:28.400
would have got to watch that guy,
uh,
you know,

729
00:44:28.401 --> 00:44:32.670
have the body of a 22 year old until he was 42.
And uh,

730
00:44:32.671 --> 00:44:36.690
I got to tell you something man.
Um,
after,
you know,

731
00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.800
just watching some of these guys get busted and you know,

732
00:44:40.801 --> 00:44:44.910
getting busted for being on juice,
uh,
you know,
they always have that question,

733
00:44:44.911 --> 00:44:49.320
you know,
should people who do steroids be allowed into the hall of fame?

734
00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:54.150
And uh,
I think after the a rock thing,
I'm finally thinking,

735
00:44:54.151 --> 00:44:55.590
no,
they shouldn't.

736
00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:00.270
And just big for the simple fact that,

737
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.720
like I just said,
it's like it doesn't help you get better.

738
00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:08.970
It just keeps your body in mint condition until you like 40,

739
00:45:08.971 --> 00:45:12.600
42.
And all these guys who get busted the second they get off of them,

740
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.720
they have their numbers go right through the floor.

741
00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.380
And I don't think it has anything to do with their skill.
It's just like a,

742
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:22.920
you do roids it's like you become one of the Eczema.

743
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.730
I'm not really big on those action movies and shipping and all those movies

744
00:45:26.731 --> 00:45:27.241
where you know,

745
00:45:27.241 --> 00:45:32.241
somebody get superhuman healing abilities and somebody slices into his arm and

746
00:45:33.061 --> 00:45:34.560
it immediately heals up.

747
00:45:34.561 --> 00:45:37.770
It's like you're literally doing the real life version of that.

748
00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:42.180
And uh,
I don't think it's fair to guys like Ken Griffey Jr.

749
00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:47.820
It really isn't like,
uh,
that guy quietly hit 600 fucking home runs and I,

750
00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:48.683
you know,

751
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:53.900
kind of stop noticing 10 years ago when all these fucking gorillas will coming

752
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:58.320
up to the plate.
I Dunno,
I've said this before,

753
00:45:58.321 --> 00:46:00.390
maybe they should have a special wing,
you know,

754
00:46:00.391 --> 00:46:04.170
the roid rage weighing of the hall of fame.
I have no idea,
but I got to admit,

755
00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:05.640
I think we're all hypocritical,

756
00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:09.120
forgiven those guys shit because no one gave a fuck about baseball.

757
00:46:09.121 --> 00:46:11.520
And then all of a sudden we're McGuire and Sosa came around.

758
00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.540
I was one of the best years of baseball ever and uh,

759
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:20.630
everybody made a ton of fucking money and everybody had a great time and now

760
00:46:21.151 --> 00:46:25.530
we're all acting like our feelings got hurt because we got to watch people hit

761
00:46:25.531 --> 00:46:30.360
600 foot home runs.
You know,
that make any sense.

762
00:46:30.361 --> 00:46:35.130
I'm half a fucking sleep out here.
Um,
here's something that I,

763
00:46:35.131 --> 00:46:37.980
uh,
I actually read a quote from one of these magazines.

764
00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:43.010
I guess evidently a Clint Eastwood was hyping that movie Grand Grand Torino.

765
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.470
I don't know if you guys have seen that movie.

766
00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:48.480
I'm sure you've seen the ads for it.

767
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:53.070
Where he basically has I get out of might align you fucking person of another

768
00:46:53.071 --> 00:46:53.904
race.

769
00:46:55.380 --> 00:47:00.380
I'm a white man and I represented my car represents back when America was good

770
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:03.930
in the early seventies.
Um,

771
00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:08.610
I guess when he was,
uh,
doing the interview for that movie,
uh,

772
00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:12.150
he called I guess the current generation,
the pussy generation.

773
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:16.410
And at first it made me laugh and I'm thinking like,
yeah,

774
00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:20.670
Clint Eastwood obviously has earned the right to call people pussies.

775
00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:26.100
And I'm thinking,
wait a minute,
clinics,
where is an actor?

776
00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:32.650
Okay,
who plays tough guys who never loses a fight?

777
00:47:32.651 --> 00:47:37.240
Rarely any of it.
If he does lose a fight in a movie,
it's a fake fight.

778
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:43.530
So at the risk of making my second sack religious comment first trash in the

779
00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:47.290
Great Mickey Mantle and now I'm going to go after Clint Eastwood.

780
00:47:47.291 --> 00:47:50.350
Unlike where has Clint Eastwood I want,

781
00:47:50.351 --> 00:47:51.940
this is my question for you guys this week.

782
00:47:51.941 --> 00:47:56.941
Where's clinics would got off like where's he earned the right that he's this

783
00:47:58.301 --> 00:48:02.110
tough guy cause like he plays a tough guy.

784
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:06.040
I remember understand that with like actors.
Like I remember like after nine,
11,

785
00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:07.383
like um,

786
00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:12.010
for some reason they wheeled out Tom Hanks and like that was supposed to make me

787
00:48:12.011 --> 00:48:13.840
feel relaxed as an American.

788
00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:17.860
And I remember during that time I was doing a joke on stage going and talking

789
00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:22.450
about Tom Hanks saying he's done so many army movies.
He thinks he's a veteran.

790
00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.300
You know what I mean?
It's not like you did army movies,

791
00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:29.020
but he played an astronaut.
He was in saving private Ryan.

792
00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:33.580
You know what I mean?
And like all of a sudden,
like,
he becomes like a,

793
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:37.870
all these guys,
like I said,
you know,
here's,
here's one 40.
I got fucking,

794
00:48:37.871 --> 00:48:39.130
but you know,
friends out here.

795
00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:43.360
So we're doing the touristy shit out here in La and I take them down to Mann's

796
00:48:43.361 --> 00:48:46.600
Chinese theater or grooming's,
whatever the fuck they're calling it now.

797
00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:48.490
And they got those,
uh,

798
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.180
they got the hand prints and the feet prints and the,
uh,

799
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:55.540
footprints there and the,
uh,
the cement.

800
00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:59.590
And I found John Wayne.
I swear to God,

801
00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:03.550
John Wayne had the smallest fucking feet I've ever seen.
I couldn't believe it.

802
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.600
This is the Duke John Wayne.
This is the guy.
Everyone was one.

803
00:49:07.601 --> 00:49:12.100
Just thought if he even breathed on you,
he'd fucking knock you in the next week.

804
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:17.550
This guy had like,
I think he went to fucking lady gap to buy his cowboy boots.

805
00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:21.900
He's like fucking
the smallest fucker things.

806
00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.780
He could have fit both his boots and his cowboy hat.

807
00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:29.060
That's how small his fucking Fida.
If you ever go to La and you,

808
00:49:29.061 --> 00:49:32.050
you go to Mann's Chinese theater,
it's on the right hand side.

809
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:36.430
He had tiny little ass feet,
you know,

810
00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.340
actors are fucking annoying.
You know what I mean?

811
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:44.350
So then they put on fucking leather jackets and they play these bad asses and

812
00:49:44.351 --> 00:49:46.600
it's just like,
dude,
you're a fucking,
you're an actor.

813
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:50.690
Have you had any real fights,
Clint?
Ah,

814
00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:53.620
somebody of a fucking rear engine.

815
00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.860
The drive through at Burger King and he got out and you settled.

816
00:49:56.861 --> 00:50:00.320
The score maybe has,
I don't know what,
but you know,

817
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:06.040
I don't know.
I don't know.
Fucking,
it just fucking annoyed me.

818
00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.510
And moving on from that,

819
00:50:07.511 --> 00:50:11.290
somebody actually sent me an email that kind of ties into this,
right?

820
00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:14.620
I'm not saying clinics and a tough guy,
that guy is fucking ridiculous.

821
00:50:14.621 --> 00:50:18.130
He's 80 years old.
He still lifting weights,
you know,

822
00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:22.060
the way his eyes are squinted.
He definitely seems like a bad ass.
But you know,

823
00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:26.380
I want to see his fight card.
I want to see his arrest record.
You know,

824
00:50:26.381 --> 00:50:30.350
maybe he was a juvenile delinquent before he came up.
I don't know.

825
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:32.600
I haven't Wikipedia'd him yet.

826
00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:38.890
I have no idea.
But this is just,
you know,
it's just an,

827
00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:42.050
I don't even know why I'm defending this generation of people because I'm 40

828
00:50:42.051 --> 00:50:42.531
years old.

829
00:50:42.531 --> 00:50:47.120
So technically the only generation that pop culture gives a fuck about is the

830
00:50:47.121 --> 00:50:51.160
young kids,
you know,
which is basically,
I don't know what,

831
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:55.670
whatever it starts to is basically once you're over the age of 24,

832
00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:59.260
nobody gives a fuck about you anymore as far as like a what music you're

833
00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:03.130
listening to.
Um,
anyways,
so this,

834
00:51:03.131 --> 00:51:07.640
this woman wrote me this,
uh,
she wrote me this email and it said,
uh,

835
00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:10.930
when it let me get down to the blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

836
00:51:10.931 --> 00:51:13.610
all this type of stuff saying really nice stuff to me,
which,
um,

837
00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.490
I'm going to blow through here even though I totally appreciate it.

838
00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:19.760
And she was commenting on the guy last week,
you know,
the guy last week,

839
00:51:19.761 --> 00:51:22.900
I was reading the story where,
uh,
he was hanging with this girl,

840
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:24.410
most beautiful girl he's ever seen,

841
00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:28.760
but she's dumb as a brick and as a fucking pothead and he can't figure out how

842
00:51:28.761 --> 00:51:33.020
to close the deal with her.
Um,
so this is what she said.
She said,
Oh,

843
00:51:33.021 --> 00:51:37.400
and about the guy who asked about what he should do with the,

844
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:39.140
with the pretty pothead girl,

845
00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:44.450
ask them if you tried to get physical with her.
Um,

846
00:51:44.451 --> 00:51:47.900
wouldn't he know whether or not she was interested in a physical relationship if

847
00:51:47.901 --> 00:51:52.340
he had made a move on her,
which is a great point because maybe he didn't.

848
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:57.670
And she said he's probably one of those hesitant guys that want the check to

849
00:51:58.431 --> 00:52:01.880
make the first move.
So typical of today.

850
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:04.940
So I guess that's kind of backend.

851
00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:09.080
Clint Eastwood saying that this is like the pussy generation.

852
00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:14.330
Um,
I don't want to be a dick here,
but I think a lot of that has to do with,
uh,

853
00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:19.910
the oversaturation of a date rate movies.
And,
uh,

854
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:25.030
these 100% chick tone shows like fucking Oprah and all.

855
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:31.630
I mean,
they got you so fucking,
I dunno,
I dunno what it is.
They're Gunna,

856
00:52:31.631 --> 00:52:36.631
everybody's so convinced that women aren't the same lying sacks of shit that

857
00:52:38.181 --> 00:52:42.620
guys are with just different genitalia that I think a lot of guys are

858
00:52:42.621 --> 00:52:43.960
approaching,
um,

859
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:49.820
stupid pothead shakes like they're these princesses that need to be rescued.

860
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.630
In other words,
what I'm saying is he,
she had just fucking bender over,

861
00:52:53.631 --> 00:52:58.100
he should just stick her bag of weed on the floor in front of our ankles and

862
00:52:58.101 --> 00:52:59.540
when she bends down to get it,

863
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:04.940
he should handle this business.
All right.
That was ignorant.
There you go.

864
00:53:04.941 --> 00:53:09.470
That's the first a straight up fucking ignorant statement of the week.
Um,

865
00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:12.770
what's going on with it here?
This is the out of the Monday morning podcast.

866
00:53:12.771 --> 00:53:14.740
If you're wondering what this babbling is,
um,

867
00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:16.580
I do one of these every single week.

868
00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:20.690
It's like fucking cal Ripkin on the cal Ripken a fucking podcast.

869
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:23.510
I can't remember the last time I missed one.
Even when I fucking miss one,

870
00:53:23.511 --> 00:53:26.100
I call up and I apologize,
you know,

871
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:30.540
does that count if cal Ripkin missed a baseball game in the middle of his
streak?

872
00:53:30.541 --> 00:53:34.130
And he just kind of called in the Orioles and said,
yeah,
sorry about that.
Yeah.

873
00:53:34.131 --> 00:53:36.990
But he called up.
He called up before the sixth inning,
so that counts.

874
00:53:36.991 --> 00:53:41.300
It's him showing up.
Anyways,
I do one of these every week.
People send me a,

875
00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:45.770
they send me questions,
they send me their list of underrated,
overrated.
Um,

876
00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:47.610
sometimes they ask me for advice.

877
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:51.120
Sometimes somebody sends me a country email and a,

878
00:53:51.121 --> 00:53:54.830
they earn the right of a Douche bag of the week.
If it's bad,
if it's bad,

879
00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:59.410
a criticism of I deserve it,
I'll take one on the chin.
Um,

880
00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:03.270
and also why hyped the stuff that I have going on in my career.

881
00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:07.290
Okay.
Bill,
what do you have going on in your career this week?
Well,

882
00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.890
I will tell you on,
uh,
next Monday,

883
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:13.100
Monday the,
uh,

884
00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:18.120
the fuck is today and Dan this phone once the nine plus seven,
the 16th,

885
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:23.160
March 16th,
I am going to be doing,
um,
a couple of shows.

886
00:54:23.161 --> 00:54:26.730
I believe they added a second show at the punchline in San Francisco.

887
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:31.050
First one sold really well.
And last I heard we were going to add a second show.

888
00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:36.300
Um,
you can go to a punchline comedy club.com.
I have all the information.

889
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:39.150
I probably don't even have that up on my website.
Do I?
What a moron.

890
00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:41.670
I'm going to do that at the end of this podcast.
By the time you hear this,

891
00:54:41.671 --> 00:54:44.190
it's going to be up there hopefully.
Um,

892
00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:47.710
I'm going to be at the punchline San Francisco next Monday night with Joe
Barton.

893
00:54:47.711 --> 00:54:49.920
Nick,
um,

894
00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:54.150
and the shows are at seven o'clock and I believe they just added a nine or a

895
00:54:54.151 --> 00:54:56.580
nine 30.
And that's what I like to do.

896
00:54:56.581 --> 00:55:00.300
I'd like to hype Shit where I have three quarters of the information and later

897
00:55:00.301 --> 00:55:05.160
on this month,
the final weekend of March,
whatever the hell those dates are,

898
00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:08.820
I'm going to be at the house of comedy and East St Louis White people.

899
00:55:08.821 --> 00:55:12.390
Don't be scared.
It's going to be a nice mixed crowd,
you know,

900
00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:16.750
and you know,
just like our president nice and mixed,
you know,
they'd go,

901
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:21.690
let me bring in America together.
Um,
and then I got up after that I got,

902
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:23.280
uh,
the Trump marina.

903
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:28.410
What do I get on my fucking website here and figure out that most of you

904
00:55:28.411 --> 00:55:31.560
listening to this,
by the way on my website,

905
00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:35.460
cause I gotta I gotta admit I'm starting to find my space,
my space.

906
00:55:35.461 --> 00:55:39.360
I'm starting to feel like the survivor of a nuclear holocaust,
you know,

907
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:44.390
kind of like will Smith's character in I am legend every day.

908
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.860
Every Monday I will be doing a podcast.

909
00:55:46.861 --> 00:55:50.460
It's the pier down at the bottom of Manhattan,
you know,

910
00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:51.990
and wants to saber tooth tiger.

911
00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:54.750
I never understood those fucking lions in that movie.

912
00:55:54.751 --> 00:55:56.040
Where the fuck did they come from?

913
00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:59.730
You know the only lions in Manhattan or in the zoo.
So if everybody,

914
00:55:59.731 --> 00:56:02.850
the zookeepers all died of whatever fucking disease it was,

915
00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:07.890
was that some animal lover who came up with the end of the world?
Rabies,

916
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:12.570
I have to let these lions go and get mauled to death just like you fucking

917
00:56:12.571 --> 00:56:17.340
deserved.
Um,
okay.
Here we go.
Sorry.
I had to do that until I got to my website.

918
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.530
Um,
April 4th,
2009,

919
00:56:19.531 --> 00:56:22.960
I will be at the Trump marina with uninformed Joda,

920
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:27.310
Rosa comedy central presents Joe de Rosa,

921
00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:32.170
every local bar and Manhattans Joe to for rose.

922
00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:35.050
Sorry Joe,
if he listened to this,
like,
you know,

923
00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:38.770
good things come in three and you only have two good things in your life.

924
00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:41.050
All right?
And I'm one of them.
Don't ever forget that.

925
00:56:41.051 --> 00:56:44.660
You fucking half Egyptian jackass.
Alright,

926
00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:48.790
I'm getting a little louder for the more angrier.
Um,

927
00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:50.170
what else do I got?

928
00:56:50.171 --> 00:56:55.171
I got the funny bone in Columbus and my Caroline's date got moved from the

929
00:56:55.211 --> 00:56:59.470
middle of May to the last week of April slash first weekend.

930
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:02.410
I guess it's the first weekend in May.
All right.

931
00:57:02.411 --> 00:57:04.690
I'm sure I'm going to emails on that.
Oh my God,

932
00:57:04.691 --> 00:57:08.530
I was coming in from Chattanooga just through your show.

933
00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:12.160
Send me a free DVD.
I will,

934
00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:15.400
as long as you open your mouth and let the mailman jam it down your fucking

935
00:57:15.401 --> 00:57:18.290
throat.
I

936
00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:23.720
really getting me here.
Um,
oh,

937
00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:25.660
we're going to be getting less than the girlfriend over there.

938
00:57:25.661 --> 00:57:29.170
She puts a fucking makeup on.
Okay.
Audience of one.

939
00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:35.140
Um,
anyways,
uh,
oh,
here we go.
You know,

940
00:57:35.141 --> 00:57:38.890
it's uh,
something that really annoys the shit out of me.
Uh,
parents,

941
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.410
I don't like former Fred Boyd,

942
00:57:41.411 --> 00:57:44.920
date rapists to then have kids and then sit there and,
and you know,

943
00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:48.340
now because they have a kid,
I have to be respectful around them.

944
00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:50.080
I think I talked about this last week,

945
00:57:50.081 --> 00:57:52.480
but I'm going to talk about it again because it's happened again.

946
00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:55.420
I'm sick of you form a fucking loud douche bags,

947
00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.920
you know who just ruined people's flights.

948
00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:04.090
You ruined baseball games basically.
You like me?
Okay,
you're an asshole.

949
00:58:04.091 --> 00:58:05.140
And now that you have a kid,

950
00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:08.890
everyone else has to be on their best behavior because you ended your life.

951
00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:12.730
And the fun in your life.
Everyone else has to be on your schedule,
all right?

952
00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:15.400
Fuck you and your fucking kid,
all right?

953
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:18.160
If you don't want them to be around a fucking animal like myself,

954
00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:22.780
don't take him out in public,
okay?
That's what they have board games for.

955
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.650
So why don't you sit there with your board game and you dip in re your

956
00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:31.210
turtleneck sweater that you don't want to wear as the rage for the person that

957
00:58:31.211 --> 00:58:34.360
you knocked up,
builds up inside of you want.
Don't you keep that all right.

958
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:37.810
Walk out your back yard and scream into a bush.
Okay?

959
00:58:37.811 --> 00:58:41.770
But leave your fucking kids at all because I'm still single.

960
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:44.860
I don't have any kids and I'm having a good time and I'm not having you be a

961
00:58:44.861 --> 00:58:48.820
fucking wet blanket because you have this little creature that only half looks

962
00:58:48.821 --> 00:58:52.960
like you.
All right?
Okay.

963
00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:58.370
Coming up swinging.
Um,

964
00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:00.970
all right.
I'm plated a crowd right now.

965
00:59:00.971 --> 00:59:03.420
I'm getting laughs on just fucking deliberately being an ass hole.

966
00:59:03.421 --> 00:59:05.050
I'm really not in that bad of a mood.

967
00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:11.050
I'm not singling,
you know what I mean?
I'm not married either.
All right.

968
00:59:11.051 --> 00:59:15.950
So watch your p's and q's over there sweetheart.
Um,

969
00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:19.870
let ever tell you I got my girlfriend,
they gay,
his little fucking,

970
00:59:19.871 --> 00:59:22.850
I want to put my makeup on.
I'm a little eight year old princess.

971
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:25.400
Women love that Shit and you know,

972
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:28.550
and you'd think it would keep them from heckling you during a podcast,

973
00:59:28.551 --> 00:59:33.350
but it doesn't.
The fucking happiness only lasts for a few days.

974
00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:39.200
All right,
question number one.
Okay,
so if you new to my podcast,
I do a,

975
00:59:39.201 --> 00:59:41.690
and this one is going to be a little short this week.
I know,
I always say that.

976
00:59:41.691 --> 00:59:45.560
And then I ended up doing 50 minutes,
but uh,
I'm already up to 18 minutes.

977
00:59:45.561 --> 00:59:47.140
I'm going to try to keep this,
uh,

978
00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:51.950
can I try to keep this about 30 minutes?
Oh,
by the way,

979
00:59:51.951 --> 00:59:55.520
I went down to Irvine last night and I watched a,

980
00:59:56.210 --> 01:00:00.190
my old friend from the Chappelle show,
Charlie Murphy to a,

981
01:00:00.191 --> 01:00:03.950
a nice hour's worth of killer material that I haven't seen before.
Um,

982
01:00:03.951 --> 01:00:08.560
if you get a chance,
definitely check out Charlie.
I think he really has a,
a

983
01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:14.030
just a totally original,
original fucking style.
That's great.

984
01:00:14.031 --> 01:00:17.780
He just goes up there and he tells these fucked up stories either that happened

985
01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:22.280
that he invented hybrid stories that are partially true.

986
01:00:22.281 --> 01:00:24.470
I don't even know what the fuck he is.
It was great.

987
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:29.450
I sat there in the crowd like a God damn fan and had a great time.
Um,

988
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:32.600
and that is it.
So look at me hyping up,
click the live,
whatever.

989
01:00:32.601 --> 01:00:35.170
Fucking great guy.
I am.
Granted,

990
01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:39.770
I already hype my shows and buried his hype fucking 20 minutes into a podcast

991
01:00:39.771 --> 01:00:44.210
and I'm patting myself on the back.
Um,
all right,

992
01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:47.930
I do questions.
I answer questions every week here on the podcast.

993
01:00:47.931 --> 01:00:50.480
So here are some questions.
Hey Bill,

994
01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:53.700
I was wondering if you ever had a slow,
slow,

995
01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:56.240
a slow spot and comedy,

996
01:00:56.270 --> 01:01:00.950
like if you ever had a period of time when you didn't come up with any material,

997
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:02.630
any material for awhile.
Oh yeah.

998
01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:07.320
That happens all the time then it happens like every six weeks,
you know,

999
01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:11.220
or whatever.
Oh,
we'll have for a six week period.
But,
um,

1000
01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:14.780
I've learned how to get,
I've learned what works for me,

1001
01:01:14.781 --> 01:01:18.680
how to get me out of those.
And I think I've answered this before,

1002
01:01:18.681 --> 01:01:21.950
but I know I have a Zillion podcast so I will answer it again in the name of

1003
01:01:21.951 --> 01:01:25.520
comedy.
Um,
what I do to get myself out of those,

1004
01:01:25.521 --> 01:01:29.300
I take all rules of,
of being a hack.

1005
01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:32.720
I just throw those out the window and um,

1006
01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:36.080
I'm really setting myself up to get trashed.
Like really,
Bill,

1007
01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:38.120
I never noticed that you ever,
uh,

1008
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:43.130
didn't take the rules of hack off with your awful specials.
Um,

1009
01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:47.750
no,
I just,
basically I do two things when I'm in writer's block.
A,

1010
01:01:47.751 --> 01:01:51.770
I will talk about current events like that dumb,
broad,

1011
01:01:51.771 --> 01:01:56.771
but the eight fucking kids and just basically shit that bike every comic is

1012
01:01:57.651 --> 01:01:59.120
jumping on,
you know,

1013
01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:02.240
like you ever see when an animal dies and the discovery channel is a bunch of

1014
01:02:02.241 --> 01:02:05.300
vultures sitting around it.
That's kind of like hack materials.
Like,

1015
01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.440
and I'll fucking fly right down with my ugly buzzard head and I'll take a big

1016
01:02:09.441 --> 01:02:10.274
chunk out of it.

1017
01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:15.880
I basically just basically if you're in writer's block just to Hacky shit about

1018
01:02:16.281 --> 01:02:17.570
topical new stuff.

1019
01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:22.860
And also I try to ask my self what's bugging me right now?

1020
01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:27.300
Anything from,
um,
my girlfriend.

1021
01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:32.550
It's got a bad look there.
My girlfriend too.
Uh,

1022
01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:38.220
like,
um,
the fact that I can't come up with any new material,

1023
01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:42.960
anything that's bothering me.
And um,
I just,

1024
01:02:42.961 --> 01:02:46.350
you just kind of use that as an exercise just to go on stage and just to be

1025
01:02:46.351 --> 01:02:47.400
saying something new,

1026
01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:51.150
even though you know it's hacky shit that you're never going to keep it,

1027
01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:55.140
it's still feels good to not be doing all the jokes that he is sick of.

1028
01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:59.940
And usually they'll end up spinning into something else hopefully.

1029
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:04.410
And you kind of pull yourself out of the mud and uh,

1030
01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:08.820
and if all else fails,
just pick on some fat guy in the crowd.
All right,

1031
01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:11.830
now don't do that.
Don't do that.
Okay.

1032
01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:15.100
It didn't we learn anything from Eddie Murphy in,
uh,

1033
01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:18.270
the clumps whenever the fuck that more than,
what was that movie called?

1034
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:21.630
The night professor.
You know what?
I fucked up.

1035
01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.960
I thought I had all the questions right in a row.
Now I've got to scroll down.

1036
01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:27.060
Hey,
how did you guys enjoy the music last week?

1037
01:03:27.061 --> 01:03:28.530
Cause you don't like the old school music.

1038
01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:33.540
I'm going to play some more and we play you a Ted Heath elks parade next week.

1039
01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:36.780
This is slowly just going to become like fucking pirate radio.

1040
01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.060
I bought two more records this week.

1041
01:03:39.061 --> 01:03:42.930
I actually bought a clash record cause I felt really bad about trashing them,

1042
01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.720
not trashing them,
just saying I didn't understand that music.

1043
01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:51.260
So I deliberately went out and I bought a bunch of music that I never fucked

1044
01:03:51.901 --> 01:03:54.150
with when I was a kid cause I uh,

1045
01:03:54.151 --> 01:03:57.690
I got into ACDC which led me into Motley Crue,

1046
01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:02.580
which led me then down to a really bad road of Glam hair metal

1047
01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:06.690
that I want to say and it would Britny Fox.

1048
01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:10.140
But somewhere in there though I did,
I did.

1049
01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.010
I found Stevie Ray Vaughan when he did the video for,
couldn't stand the weather.

1050
01:04:14.011 --> 01:04:17.550
So I always had one foot in decent music.
But uh,

1051
01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:21.990
basically I totally shut out the Ramones or the clash.

1052
01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:25.620
And lets you know other than their radio shit,
Elvis Costello,

1053
01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:27.180
this is all shit I bought this week.

1054
01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:31.260
I finally downloaded a David Bowie that uh,

1055
01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:35.760
Ziggy stardust album and I was like,
you know,

1056
01:04:35.761 --> 01:04:40.410
this is like one of these great concept albums that people listen to in the 70s.

1057
01:04:40.411 --> 01:04:41.310
And I was like,
fuck this,

1058
01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:45.120
I'm doing it the way they did it in the 70s minus the drugs.

1059
01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.050
So I got my headphones that I have,
I do have headphones,

1060
01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:51.090
I have the big fucking,
you know,

1061
01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.840
but actually for drums they kind of protect the ears from the drums.

1062
01:04:54.841 --> 01:04:57.780
And he also couldn't listen to your iPod,
which I don't have my dismay.

1063
01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:03.350
And I plugged it in my laptop and I listened to the album and I fucked up was

1064
01:05:03.421 --> 01:05:06.300
cause rather than listening to it in the track order,

1065
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:10.920
I guess on my iTunes,
I had it in last downloaded.

1066
01:05:10.921 --> 01:05:12.900
So it kind of jumped all around the album.

1067
01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:16.440
I kind of realized when Ziggy Stardust fucking killed himself or whatever,

1068
01:05:16.441 --> 01:05:18.580
by the third song,
I'm like,
wow,

1069
01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:21.160
how's David Bowlby going to pull itself out of this fucking thing?

1070
01:05:21.161 --> 01:05:23.830
And then I realized,
you know,

1071
01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:29.940
once again I fucked up with technology but the fucking killer album and uh,

1072
01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:34.570
I don't know if anybody has any suggestions of,
of music from that era.

1073
01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:38.830
You know,
all the shit that I thought sucked,
like talking heads,

1074
01:05:38.831 --> 01:05:40.450
I kind of liked a couple of their songs,

1075
01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.870
but like some David Burns Solo Shit I've found is amazing.

1076
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.320
And to think that I was in a,
in a warehouse

1077
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:52.540
just trashing him during that period of my life,

1078
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:55.990
thinking that he sucked as I was listening to Cinderella

1079
01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:00.880
and poison and all this,
uh,
Tesla,

1080
01:06:01.450 --> 01:06:02.740
I'm not saying they were bad,

1081
01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:07.100
but that was definitely the smooth jazz of heavy metal.
It was John.
I,

1082
01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:11.260
it's just fucking
embarrassing.

1083
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:12.550
Really embarrassing.

1084
01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:16.410
I think eighties music really gets a bad rap when you start listening to,
uh,

1085
01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:19.750
I dunno.
I Dunno what the fuck.

1086
01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:23.620
I just literally asked you for advice then and then I bought a couple albums.

1087
01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.710
All right.
I actually literally still by him too,
by the way,

1088
01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.400
bought a couple of cds and didn't even listen to them yet.

1089
01:06:30.401 --> 01:06:35.160
And now I'm already trying to tell you guys what's good music from the eighties

1090
01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:38.020
TDC,
the fucking the Moose.
The inner Mussolini

1091
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:42.850
fucking in me.
I Dunno.
I'm not.
All right.
Um,

1092
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:45.460
let's get to underrated overrated here or what?

1093
01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:47.290
You guys want to hear a story about revenge?
Uh Huh.

1094
01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.320
I like I asked you guys questions.
You know,
it's like you actually have to say,

1095
01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:54.280
and as you sit there and nod your head and your cubicle,
yeah,
yeah.
You know,

1096
01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:58.900
or pump your fist on your fucking treadmill.
You know,

1097
01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:01.570
or just say yes out loud,
loud,

1098
01:07:01.571 --> 01:07:06.571
loud in your middle seat on that Delta Airlines flight you on Delta Airlines

1099
01:07:07.001 --> 01:07:10.880
right now.
Is there somebody with bad breath eating pistachios next to you?

1100
01:07:10.881 --> 01:07:11.800
If ever,

1101
01:07:11.801 --> 01:07:15.970
tell you that fucking story and real and he's eating the red ones too.

1102
01:07:15.971 --> 01:07:20.440
That made his lips all fucking pink by the end of her Rick.
Horrific flight.

1103
01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:25.060
All right,
let's get to the revenge.
When the fuck is it?
Pussy generation.

1104
01:07:25.061 --> 01:07:28.480
I'm really disorganized this week.
Okay.
Because I have guests.
I have,

1105
01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:32.290
I'm entertaining this week,
Erin,
than wearing a Tuxedo for three days.

1106
01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.980
Underrated.
Overrated.
Underrated.
Overrated

1107
01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:39.250
with fuck is the revenge story.

1108
01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:48.040
God dammit.
This is embarrassing.
I don't want to just read it.

1109
01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:49.660
I'm just going to start.
I'm just going to jump around.

1110
01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:55.000
I'm just going to jump around.
Who's at House of pain?
Uh,
no.
Well the fuck.

1111
01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:58.050
Oh fuck you.
I don't know who it was.
I tapped out during that period too.

1112
01:07:58.051 --> 01:08:02.230
All Movie Review Bill.
I just got back from the midnight showing of the watchman.

1113
01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.730
I really don't know how to review it.
Untold,

1114
01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:09.100
it sticks pretty close to the graphic novel and had cool special effects,

1115
01:08:09.101 --> 01:08:12.670
great story and good acting.
But I kind of felt eh after it,

1116
01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:15.760
after leaving the dark night.
I remember,
I so amazed.

1117
01:08:15.761 --> 01:08:18.820
I didn't have a single thought run through my head for at least five minutes

1118
01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:22.090
after ironman and hulk.
I left feeling satisfaction.

1119
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:25.870
But with this movie it's something just kind of left me feeling depressed after

1120
01:08:25.871 --> 01:08:26.470
watching it.

1121
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:30.850
I think it was the overall message of the movie was serious told in a totally

1122
01:08:30.851 --> 01:08:34.990
ridiculous way.
Anyway.
Anyway,
I would recommend it.
But go with caution.

1123
01:08:34.991 --> 01:08:38.740
If you don't like comic books and have trouble following fragmented,

1124
01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:42.880
fragmented storylines like Tarantino movies,
I wouldn't go.

1125
01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:45.220
And I said,
God damn good review.

1126
01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:49.090
Got Right to the fucking meat and potatoes of it.
Oh,
and by the way,

1127
01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:53.860
he says it was directed by the guy who did the 300 story,
300 movies.

1128
01:08:53.861 --> 01:08:58.810
So there's as a lot of man ass in it.
Yeah.
I find that funny.

1129
01:08:58.811 --> 01:09:03.550
That guys really liked that.
Uh,
that movie 300.
I mean,

1130
01:09:03.551 --> 01:09:05.530
I thought it was pretty ridiculous,
but um,

1131
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:10.060
the amount of guys that get pumped after they see that,
I mean,

1132
01:09:10.061 --> 01:09:14.650
that literally was playgirl the movie.
I thought,
um,

1133
01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:20.020
I just thought the whole thing was stupid.
They sparked us.

1134
01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:24.430
I mean,
good luck with that.
Um,
you know what that's like.

1135
01:09:24.431 --> 01:09:28.270
That's like Beyonce and girlfriend downloaded that fucking album.

1136
01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:33.790
The name of the album is I am dot,
dot,
dot,
dot.

1137
01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:38.770
Sasha fierce.
All right,
Beyonce.
Well,

1138
01:09:38.771 --> 01:09:43.150
good luck with that character.
He kind of still sound like Beyonce.
If you ask me.

1139
01:09:44.170 --> 01:09:48.460
Beautiful,
gorgeous woman,
woman.
Really condensed.
But her voice,
oof,

1140
01:09:49.690 --> 01:09:50.560
Jesus Christ,

1141
01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:59.530
horrible,
punishing you,

1142
01:10:00.670 --> 01:10:03.520
just fucking Polish into her.

1143
01:10:03.521 --> 01:10:06.280
Best thing was when she whipped her head around and fell down on the stage.

1144
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:09.370
That was probably one of the greatest things I think I've ever seen.

1145
01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:12.790
And a lot of it's just bitterness.
She's just absolutely gorgeous.
You know,

1146
01:10:12.791 --> 01:10:14.020
she's totally out of your league.

1147
01:10:14.021 --> 01:10:17.440
And is there anything funnier than seeing a beautiful girl just fucking fall

1148
01:10:17.441 --> 01:10:21.670
right on her ass?
You know,
this is ridiculous.

1149
01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:25.210
I'm sure she's a nice fucking person,
but you know,
I should really,
reality is,

1150
01:10:25.211 --> 01:10:28.300
I'm kind of thinking like,
this is Jay z's fucking wife.
And uh,

1151
01:10:28.301 --> 01:10:30.610
then he stabbed somebody one time for something,

1152
01:10:32.410 --> 01:10:35.680
although he did it in a hacky way.
He walked up and he used the godfather line.

1153
01:10:35.681 --> 01:10:38.630
He said,
you broke my heart and then stab them.
That's all alleged.

1154
01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:42.970
Why don't I shut the fuck up?
Okay.
I will.
All right,
here's the revenge story.

1155
01:10:42.971 --> 01:10:44.380
Bill.
I'm not really into revenge,

1156
01:10:44.381 --> 01:10:47.920
but if someone fucks with me to the point where I think about pushing them off a

1157
01:10:47.921 --> 01:10:52.450
cliff,
then yeah,
I kind of feel like I have to do something.
So here's my story.

1158
01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:57.310
Oh,
this is a good one.
Settle in for this one.
If you're at home,

1159
01:10:57.311 --> 01:11:01.060
get underneath your Afghan and rose some fucking marshmallows because this is

1160
01:11:01.061 --> 01:11:05.420
like a,
this is the closest thing to a ghost story.
Um,

1161
01:11:05.950 --> 01:11:08.230
this is just has that evil fucking,
uh,

1162
01:11:09.490 --> 01:11:13.150
last house on the left Vibe,
um,
which I love that they're making.
Again,

1163
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:17.130
that reference will finally make sense to people.
If you don't know what that is.

1164
01:11:17.131 --> 01:11:21.300
There was a genre of films in the 70s,
which were basically rate movies.

1165
01:11:21.450 --> 01:11:25.680
Last house in the left,
gator bait.
Fucking,
uh,

1166
01:11:25.710 --> 01:11:28.530
I spit on your grave and evidently they're going to make a comeback,

1167
01:11:28.531 --> 01:11:32.290
which I think is fucking hilarious,
you know,
you know,

1168
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:36.390
we haven't had a good rate movie in awhile.
All right.
Um,

1169
01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:38.910
let's remake last house on the left.

1170
01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:46.620
I think that that needs to be updated.
All right.
Anyways,
Bill,

1171
01:11:46.621 --> 01:11:50.130
I had a girlfriend for about three years.
This is the revenge story.
Bill.

1172
01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:53.850
I had a girlfriend for about three years who ended up cheating on me when I

1173
01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:55.860
found,
and when I found out about it,

1174
01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:01.770
I called her out on it and she got defensive and turned on me,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1175
01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:06.270
While do I,
that's,
that's some pretty,
uh,
she's got skills.

1176
01:12:06.271 --> 01:12:11.220
If she was able to do that,
uh,
you cheated on me.
You fucking bitch.

1177
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:15.510
Yeah.
Well you never do the dishes.
Okay.
I'm sorry.

1178
01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:21.470
I guess you made a good point.
How the fuck could she turn on you unless you,

1179
01:12:21.490 --> 01:12:24.270
all right bill,
just shut up and read the story.
Okay.
I will.
So anyway,

1180
01:12:24.271 --> 01:12:26.970
she turned on me,
um,
and he goes,

1181
01:12:26.971 --> 01:12:31.050
I made the poor decision and took her back about a year later,

1182
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:31.951
about a year later,

1183
01:12:31.951 --> 01:12:36.951
she cheated on me again and I told her to go fuck herself prior to the second

1184
01:12:36.961 --> 01:12:37.794
cheating,

1185
01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:42.890
I bought a trip to Disney world for us about eight months after we broke up,

1186
01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.150
it was time for the,
for the Disney world trip.

1187
01:12:46.150 --> 01:12:50.310
So I asked her if she wanted to go see,
she said yes,

1188
01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:54.990
and off we went.
Now my revenge kicks in.
See,

1189
01:12:54.991 --> 01:12:57.960
this is just like one of those movies starts off all nice and sunny.

1190
01:12:58.410 --> 01:12:59.370
We go into the camp,

1191
01:12:59.371 --> 01:13:03.570
we're going to Disney land and here comes fucking Jason on a crystal lake.

1192
01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:05.880
Um,
so now my revenge kicks in.

1193
01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:10.920
All of the degrading things I've ever wanted to do.
This chick I did to this one.

1194
01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:15.510
Okay.
And I have guests,
so I get a mumbled his shit.
I busted on our face.

1195
01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:20.730
I pounded her into the ass until she puked Jesus Christ.

1196
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:25.260
Women are just literally ripping their headsets off right now.
Anyways,
he goes,

1197
01:13:25.261 --> 01:13:29.820
it was fantastic.
On the fourth night we had an argument,

1198
01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:35.060
she told me that she wanted to go on this trip to try and win the back cause she

1199
01:13:36.181 --> 01:13:38.400
felt bad for all the things she had done to me.

1200
01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:43.970
Basically she was apologizing for cheating when I told her that there was no

1201
01:13:44.521 --> 01:13:46.620
chance of us getting back together.

1202
01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:50.940
And the older only reason why I fucked her was to make her feel like a

1203
01:13:50.941 --> 01:13:51.774
prostitute.

1204
01:13:56.580 --> 01:14:00.270
She bought a plane ticket home and I felt wonderful.

1205
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:04.980
I guess what I'm trying to say is some people deserve what they get.

1206
01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:10.860
Oh God,
what a great,
great story.
Um,
there's so many levels to,

1207
01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:15.070
okay,
first of all,
just the fucking,

1208
01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:17.890
the fact that she cheated on you and you took her back.

1209
01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:22.240
He just liked de Niro's character and casino,
you know what I mean?

1210
01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:23.620
You didn't know how to handle it.

1211
01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:28.750
And then she cheats on his second time and then you just become jaded and you

1212
01:14:28.751 --> 01:14:33.620
just go into like a,
it was like,
you know those movies where the guy,
you know,

1213
01:14:33.621 --> 01:14:33.771
the,

1214
01:14:33.771 --> 01:14:37.390
the week person's just getting the shit kicked out of them and then finally they

1215
01:14:37.391 --> 01:14:39.250
just can't fucking take it anymore.

1216
01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:42.610
And then all of a sudden they turn into like fucking like Clint Eastwood

1217
01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:45.280
character.
You actually did that with this girl.

1218
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:49.210
And then the whole other level that I love.
Okay.

1219
01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:54.600
Is that now that you've finally found in this skank in bed the way she always

1220
01:14:54.941 --> 01:14:59.020
wanted to,
probably the reason she cheated on you.
You know,

1221
01:14:59.021 --> 01:15:01.870
cause you probably would do in the,
I love you kind of sex now.

1222
01:15:01.871 --> 01:15:06.490
You actually fucking do what you were supposed to be doing with this girl.

1223
01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:09.430
Now she wants to get back with you.
Fuck that.

1224
01:15:09.431 --> 01:15:12.010
She didn't go to Disneyland because she wanted to get back with you.

1225
01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:16.990
She went to Disney land because she's a fucking cunt who saw a free tip to

1226
01:15:16.991 --> 01:15:21.070
fucking Florida and she thought she was going to play you again and get more

1227
01:15:21.071 --> 01:15:21.880
shit out of you.

1228
01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:25.240
Then all of a sudden you come in there and you throw down like Johnny fucking

1229
01:15:25.241 --> 01:15:28.150
Wad and now all of a sudden meant then.

1230
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:32.350
Then she wanted to get back with you and then you told him to go fuck herself.

1231
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:35.980
Which was perfect because I thought you were going to crumble in that moment and

1232
01:15:35.981 --> 01:15:40.570
you didn't,
you know,
and then she fucking left and then that's great.

1233
01:15:40.571 --> 01:15:45.100
And then you laughed your ass off and jumped on the tea cups listening to,

1234
01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:49.630
it's a small world after all,
you know,
that's fucking great.

1235
01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:54.100
Four stars.
If you fucking film that,
I would,
not only would I go see it,

1236
01:15:54.370 --> 01:15:58.120
I would buy it on DVD,
Kuwait fucking story.
Revenge.

1237
01:15:59.270 --> 01:16:04.240
Um,
all right.
And we go,
oh,
he had a lot of passion in it,
Huh?

1238
01:16:04.330 --> 01:16:07.240
Oh,
we're all we up to 34 minutes.
All right,
let's hustle through this.
Alright.

1239
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:10.830
Overrated.
Overrated.
Underrated lists for the week.
Overrated.

1240
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:14.710
High priced Mexican food.
You can get the same shit for half the price.

1241
01:16:14.711 --> 01:16:19.360
Cross the street.
You know,
some shit is written so perfectly,

1242
01:16:19.361 --> 01:16:22.750
I don't even need to add to what exactly 100% correct.

1243
01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:27.760
I still had to add to it are underrated.
Fake boobs.
Fucking awesome.

1244
01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:33.280
Um,
I like how that's written so short and it's just up to me to draw my own

1245
01:16:33.281 --> 01:16:38.220
collusion,
my own conclusions.
Fake boobs.
Fucking awesome.
Um,

1246
01:16:38.230 --> 01:16:42.880
have you ever touched them?
The fucking horrific.
Um,
personally,
I,
you guys,

1247
01:16:42.881 --> 01:16:46.540
I fake boobs are the worst.
Uh,
don't ever do that.

1248
01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:50.710
Don't ever do that.
Then all of a sudden in a matter of how good they are,

1249
01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:55.360
it's like you're having sex with a fucking cyborg.
I,

1250
01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:59.410
one of those awful Bruce Willis movies,
remember those,
uh,
or judge dread,

1251
01:16:59.890 --> 01:17:01.780
you know,
those movies where,
you know,
they,

1252
01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:05.290
they always end up hooking up with some half person,
half robot.

1253
01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:07.450
That's what I feel about that stuff.

1254
01:17:07.451 --> 01:17:10.730
And I really don't understand why people get face lifts and stuff,
you know,

1255
01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:12.771
first of all,

1256
01:17:12.771 --> 01:17:17.771
it doesn't look good and everybody noticed even if even if you didn't notice for

1257
01:17:17.841 --> 01:17:21.410
some reason when you get your face lift,
it also becomes really shiny.

1258
01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:25.280
Can anybody explain what that is?
Is that the botox,

1259
01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:30.880
what is it about getting faceless that makes you face so fucking shiny and it

1260
01:17:31.071 --> 01:17:34.930
literally looks like laminated?
Um,

1261
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.981
now,
you know,

1262
01:17:36.981 --> 01:17:40.970
it looks like it looks like the apples and the grocery store that they spray to

1263
01:17:40.971 --> 01:17:44.330
make them really,
really shiny.
Speaking of which you ever get an organic apple?

1264
01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:48.650
I mean it's like so natural.
There's like a fucking warm in it.
I like the,

1265
01:17:48.651 --> 01:17:53.010
I think I like the old shiny wants.
Um,
all right.
They'll love your podcast.

1266
01:17:53.011 --> 01:17:57.800
Just wanting to say,
I think using,
I like this one to a bill.
I just want to say,

1267
01:17:57.801 --> 01:18:00.080
I think using big words is overrated.

1268
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:04.910
If you can express something by saying a simple,
normal word,

1269
01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:06.740
why use a big word?

1270
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:11.870
I just broke up with my girlfriend today and earlier she had called me anthro,

1271
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:16.490
anthro phobic because I don't even know what the fuck that means because I don't

1272
01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:17.980
like,
cause I don't like her friends.

1273
01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:21.500
So she called me anthro phobic cause I don't like her friends.
Um,

1274
01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:23.360
I just don't like most of her friends.

1275
01:18:23.361 --> 01:18:26.960
It doesn't mean I hate people in general or even hate or friends.

1276
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:29.870
I honestly didn't know what it meant.
So I looked it up.

1277
01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:34.670
It means a fear of people,
which isn't even what she said.

1278
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:36.950
You're right.
She didn't even use it correctly,

1279
01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:41.960
are actually what she or she has a delusional view of her friends that her

1280
01:18:41.961 --> 01:18:45.860
friends represent everybody or that her friends are so great that if you don't

1281
01:18:45.861 --> 01:18:46.610
like them,

1282
01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:51.230
then you just hate all people because her friends represent humanity.

1283
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.400
Jesus.
Good movement.
Dumping that fucking stuck up to what?

1284
01:18:56.330 --> 01:19:00.200
Um,
anyways,
I definitely do not like a lot of people,

1285
01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.340
but I don't hate people unlike that call last week.

1286
01:19:04.341 --> 01:19:09.080
Who Mess with that guy's mom?
Mom's car.
Yeah.
That guy was fucking nuts.
Anyways,

1287
01:19:09.081 --> 01:19:11.150
it seems like a,
you're kind of the same way.

1288
01:19:11.151 --> 01:19:15.230
I just don't see the point of using big words other than trying to sound smart.

1289
01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:20.160
It's like if something can be said more easily and in a way that's easy,

1290
01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:22.520
more easily understood by using smaller wood,

1291
01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:25.490
words can't even fucking read.

1292
01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:29.090
Especially if you have an idiot like me reading it.
Keep the word small.

1293
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:33.170
Would you say something like that?
Seriously killer was,
I can't even see,

1294
01:19:33.171 --> 01:19:35.630
I didn't know what this word is.
Dak gnome.

1295
01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:39.830
ADAC no maniac or that serially was obsessed with killing.

1296
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:43.460
I don't think you'd say either.
I think you just say that guy's a serial killer.

1297
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:47.240
I mean,
I think we know what serial killers do.
I know what you mean.

1298
01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:52.190
Do I know what you mean by this is what I think.
I think,
I think big words,
uh,

1299
01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:55.820
they're,
they're much better in print.
You know what I mean?

1300
01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.350
Cause you don't want to read a great novel and it just have someone like,
dude,

1301
01:20:00.351 --> 01:20:05.030
shit was fucked up.
You know,
I was like,

1302
01:20:05.031 --> 01:20:09.870
damn,
I mean I wouldn't want to read.
Like I don't,
I don't mind.

1303
01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.780
I don't mind big words,
but I mean

1304
01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:18.090
they have to be coming out of the right person's mouth.
In fact,

1305
01:20:18.091 --> 01:20:21.900
I kind of liked them on some level when,
um,
you know,

1306
01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:25.650
but person use a big word and it makes me want to read and they're actually

1307
01:20:25.651 --> 01:20:29.100
using it in an obnoxious way and they've earned the right to use it that way

1308
01:20:29.101 --> 01:20:32.100
because they actually do read and don't watch TV.
But yeah,

1309
01:20:32.101 --> 01:20:36.570
if it's just some chick you were dating who has cunty friends and they watch the

1310
01:20:36.571 --> 01:20:41.270
Osi every Thursday night and then she pulls out a word like that,
um,

1311
01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:44.970
that sounds like that there was a breakup word.
She was like,

1312
01:20:44.971 --> 01:20:48.360
I'm going to use a big word here so I can feel like I'm above this guy who's

1313
01:20:48.361 --> 01:20:51.500
dumping me because my low self esteem is,
is,

1314
01:20:51.550 --> 01:20:54.030
is gonna fucking flow right over the side.

1315
01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:57.240
And I'm going to break down and I'm going to start crying and I'm going to have

1316
01:20:57.241 --> 01:21:01.020
a snot bubble and I'm going to feel horrible and I know in six months I'm going

1317
01:21:01.021 --> 01:21:03.030
to realize this person isn't worth crying about.

1318
01:21:03.031 --> 01:21:07.260
So I'm going to use a fucking big word here to try to save myself.

1319
01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:12.670
I really forgot what I was saying halfway through that.
That's weird.

1320
01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:15.890
I actually agreed with that guy and then in that scenario just sorta trashed him

1321
01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:20.780
like saying he wasn't worth,
he was,
wasn't what's crying over you know what?

1322
01:21:20.781 --> 01:21:22.890
I don't know shit about either one of you,
but uh,

1323
01:21:22.891 --> 01:21:25.410
you wrote me the letter so I'm going to fucking side with you.

1324
01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:30.150
I'm trying to be more balanced because I've trashed chicks twice in this.
Uh,

1325
01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:32.800
all right.
Hey Bill,
I've been a big fan of yours since I saw you.

1326
01:21:32.801 --> 01:21:35.310
I just feel it's funny.
I was wondering,

1327
01:21:35.311 --> 01:21:39.150
when are you going to come to the punchline in Atlanta?
Well,

1328
01:21:39.151 --> 01:21:44.151
why don't you go on my fucking website and scroll down and look for punchline in

1329
01:21:44.311 --> 01:21:47.430
Atlanta?
That's usually a good way to find out.

1330
01:21:47.431 --> 01:21:50.880
When I'm at the punchline in Atlanta,
I'm there in June.

1331
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:54.330
Why do I put my dates up?
You know,
you know why?

1332
01:21:54.331 --> 01:21:57.990
Because 90% of you actually read the calendar and this fucking guy is not going

1333
01:21:57.991 --> 01:22:01.650
to listen to this podcast and he's going to email me again this week and you

1334
01:22:01.651 --> 01:22:04.050
know what?
I'm actually going to send them an email because I'm a whore.

1335
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:07.320
I'll tell him the exact dates and put a link on it so I'm just going to shut up.

1336
01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:12.970
Um,
anyways.
Um,
all your shit is lit up man.
So,

1337
01:22:13.650 --> 01:22:18.630
um,
anyway,
overrated,
underrated,
overrated.

1338
01:22:18.631 --> 01:22:22.530
Having kids.
Marriage is bad enough,
but for the life of me,

1339
01:22:22.531 --> 01:22:25.620
I can't understand why the fuck anyone would ever want to have kids.

1340
01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:28.080
Your life effectively ends when you have kids.

1341
01:22:28.081 --> 01:22:30.090
Everything you do has to be for them.

1342
01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:35.040
How fucking pathetic is your life that you have,
um,
that you decide,
you know,

1343
01:22:35.041 --> 01:22:37.650
what would be fun?
Never having any fun anymore.

1344
01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:42.570
I can't wait to clean shit out of some douchebag.
Infants,
Asshole,
Jesus Christ.

1345
01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:45.930
Only get four hours of sleep a night.

1346
01:22:45.931 --> 01:22:49.830
If I'm lucky it never have any fucking fun with my friends ever again.
I mean,

1347
01:22:49.831 --> 01:22:54.630
Jesus fucking Christ.
Are you kidding me?
Um,
underrated.

1348
01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:57.270
This is the same guy maker's mark whiskey.

1349
01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:06.400
Let me guess what you talk about after you've had a couple of belts from that.

1350
01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:11.980
Anyways,
he says,
this shit is all I drink and it's fucking spectacular.

1351
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:16.180
Under 40 bucks a handle,
80 proof and smoother than James fucking bond.

1352
01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:21.610
Ah,
this guy's great.
This guy is like the guy's guy and he's the guy.

1353
01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:23.050
You know what I love about this dude?

1354
01:23:23.051 --> 01:23:26.560
This is the kind of guy when you're in a bar and you know you're fucking up your

1355
01:23:26.561 --> 01:23:27.130
life,

1356
01:23:27.130 --> 01:23:30.670
which is why you go to the bar and you start drinking and this is the guy who's

1357
01:23:30.671 --> 01:23:34.780
going to tell you when your shit face that everything you're doing is exactly

1358
01:23:34.781 --> 01:23:39.190
right.
He's the guy who comes up.
What's the matter man?
Ah,
I don't know man.

1359
01:23:39.191 --> 01:23:42.790
I blew with this chick and he's the guy that you put her with this chick.

1360
01:23:43.450 --> 01:23:44.590
What the fuck is wrong?

1361
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:47.450
You don't want to be with some fucking broad when you already have fuck fucking,

1362
01:23:47.451 --> 01:23:50.290
they just build you up and then you get hammered.

1363
01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:54.760
You get a Dui and then they take your shoe laces and then you curl up on that

1364
01:23:54.761 --> 01:23:58.270
burlap sack they use for a blanket and you wait for your dad to come down and

1365
01:23:58.271 --> 01:24:02.110
pick you up.
You know?
But in that moment,

1366
01:24:02.890 --> 01:24:07.810
before all that shit happens,
it's,
this guy's the shit dude.
You know what it is.

1367
01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:10.090
I think as you get older,
like me,

1368
01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:13.120
I'm starting to really feel like I want to have a kid now because it gets

1369
01:24:13.121 --> 01:24:18.090
pathetic after awhile,
you know?
I Dunno.
I Dunno if it's the,

1370
01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:22.720
the magnetic pole of the herd,
you know what I mean?

1371
01:24:22.721 --> 01:24:24.250
Everything has like a gravity to it.

1372
01:24:24.251 --> 01:24:28.600
And I think that as much as you tried to fucking escape the orbit of the fucking

1373
01:24:28.601 --> 01:24:33.280
heard,
you get pulled back into it.
And,
uh,
I don't know.

1374
01:24:33.281 --> 01:24:35.230
Sometimes I feel like I'm having too much fun,

1375
01:24:35.290 --> 01:24:39.040
like as a 40 year old guy and I'm sitting there,
you know,

1376
01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:41.380
learning how to play good times,
bad times.

1377
01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:46.810
And I got the NHL package and when I'm not watching TV,

1378
01:24:46.811 --> 01:24:49.630
I'm learning how to play ACDC songs.
So when I'm not doing that,

1379
01:24:49.631 --> 01:24:51.880
I'm fucking telling jokes on stage.

1380
01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:57.160
It just gets to the point you like going,
like you said,
you start feeling guilty,

1381
01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:01.510
you know I ain't guilty,
but you just start looking like,
you know what,

1382
01:25:01.511 --> 01:25:05.650
I need to fucking teach someone else how to do their life like this.

1383
01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:10.870
You know,
I got to admit I am a miserable motherfucker,
but I am having,

1384
01:25:10.930 --> 01:25:15.880
I'm having a great time and you can have it too if you learn how to talk about

1385
01:25:15.881 --> 01:25:18.550
your Dick onstage.
All right,
last thing,
Bill,

1386
01:25:18.730 --> 01:25:22.120
you started talking about the police last week and it got me thinking about
them.

1387
01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:25.690
Uh,
the band,
the police,
all this summer I was talking about all the,
uh,

1388
01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:30.040
all the music that I missed out on the police are one of the few that I listened

1389
01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:34.600
to.
Um,
anyway,
you started talking about them.
And so it pulled me out,

1390
01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:39.430
made me pull out some of my old records and I started listening to them.
Um,

1391
01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:41.410
and his underrated for the week,
as he said,

1392
01:25:41.411 --> 01:25:43.660
staying is a very underrated bass player.

1393
01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:46.960
Most of the baselines he plays are amazing.

1394
01:25:47.170 --> 01:25:50.740
I know most people think of him for his solo work and all the crappy new age

1395
01:25:50.741 --> 01:25:54.550
stuff he does,
but when he was with the police,
um,

1396
01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:58.880
he could rock a base like no other.
Uh,
yeah,
I got to met.

1397
01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:02.230
He's fucking,
um,
I would definitely,

1398
01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:05.700
I don't know if he is underrated and that with musicians he isn't.

1399
01:26:05.701 --> 01:26:08.730
But I think with people he's underrated because a lot of people feel that,
yeah,

1400
01:26:08.731 --> 01:26:10.500
a lot of his solo stuff is cheesy.

1401
01:26:11.010 --> 01:26:15.000
And meanwhile he's playing with some of the bet like Vinny Uda and all these

1402
01:26:15.001 --> 01:26:19.650
fucking guys.
And then I make a HUD that sounds like really lane that,

1403
01:26:19.651 --> 01:26:21.270
that field,
the gold song,

1404
01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:25.770
whichever it was like people think is like elevator music has him on base.

1405
01:26:25.771 --> 01:26:29.790
And I think Vinny call you to actually playing on drums.
Um,

1406
01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:35.370
all right.
I'm a music nerd.
All right.
And,
uh,
and that's it.

1407
01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:39.990
It's 10 o'clock out here and I have to go,
uh,
I gotta go do some touristy shit.

1408
01:26:39.991 --> 01:26:40.830
So,
uh,
you guys,

1409
01:26:40.831 --> 01:26:44.070
I really want to thank you for continuing to write in the questions to the end

1410
01:26:44.071 --> 01:26:45.600
of the age old red.
You guys.
You know,
it's funny,

1411
01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:48.270
you guys are getting so good at the shit that,
uh,

1412
01:26:48.570 --> 01:26:50.340
the podcast I think of becoming better.

1413
01:26:50.670 --> 01:26:53.460
I'm actually reading out loud and much better way you guys actually using

1414
01:26:53.461 --> 01:26:56.760
punctuation and,
uh,
you telling me some great stories.

1415
01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:00.210
I'm loving the stories about revenge.
Um,

1416
01:27:01.290 --> 01:27:06.180
and if you just want to comment on revenge and general,
cause,
um,
I,
you know,

1417
01:27:06.630 --> 01:27:10.450
I dunno.
Revenge really.
Uh,
that's a line that I,
I,

1418
01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:15.030
I've never,
I just don't,
I just don't cross that.
I just,

1419
01:27:15.031 --> 01:27:17.040
I feel like that is the deepest,

1420
01:27:17.041 --> 01:27:21.390
darkest part of your soul that you can go into.
You know,

1421
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:26.100
you're fucking,
uh,
you know,
you like,
you like Jimmy Smits on Dexter.

1422
01:27:26.150 --> 01:27:27.890
Do you guys watch desks,
Dexter this season?

1423
01:27:27.891 --> 01:27:31.830
I'm gonna recommend a couple of shows Dexter I liked,
but,
uh,

1424
01:27:31.890 --> 01:27:35.730
you gotta watch brotherhood,
showtime on demand.

1425
01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:38.910
You have to watch that fucking show.
And uh,

1426
01:27:39.210 --> 01:27:43.290
it's just an unbelievable show and is actually,
there's a,

1427
01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:46.490
there's a couple of guys,
the first season comedian Tony Vee that,

1428
01:27:46.510 --> 01:27:50.760
that I learned so much from.
And another guy actually started out with,

1429
01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:54.930
uh,
Kevin Chapman who plays Freddy Cork,

1430
01:27:54.931 --> 01:27:58.770
who's one of my favorite characters on that,
on television right now.

1431
01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:03.690
Um,
I don't know if you just did the Gangsta fucking shows.
It's,
it's the shit.

1432
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:06.510
It's a great fucking show brotherhood.
Um,

1433
01:28:06.511 --> 01:28:11.150
I'm sure you can rent the first DVD some even if you,
even if you buy it,
no,

1434
01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:13.400
don't buy it because then if you don't like it,
then you stuck with it.

1435
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:17.970
Then I got to listen to,
you'd be a country but fucking,
uh,
go rented somewhere.

1436
01:28:17.971 --> 01:28:21.150
I'm telling you to great.
Show animals and winter break breaking bad.

1437
01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:26.790
Those are my three shows.
Other than that,
I just watched sports and,

1438
01:28:26.791 --> 01:28:29.790
uh,
and that is it.
All right.
This really tapered off in the end.

1439
01:28:30.210 --> 01:28:33.800
I hope you guys enjoyed it.
