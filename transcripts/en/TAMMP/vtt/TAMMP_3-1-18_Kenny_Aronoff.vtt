00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.650
Hey,

2
00:00:01.651 --> 00:00:05.670
It's time for a very special edition of the Monday morning podcasts and the

3
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:08.040
Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday podcast,

4
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:11.190
whatever the hell you want to call it.
I have a very special guest here.

5
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:15.660
This is a guy I've been a fan of since,
I dunno,
like the first time I saw him.

6
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:18.330
82 or 83 please welcome drumming.

7
00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:22.620
Legend Mr Kenny Aronoff.
Yeah man.
What's going on dude?

8
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.820
It's so cool.

9
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.120
<v 1>See you.</v>

10
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.860
Cause the first time I saw he was a buddy of mine in Chicago said you gotta see

11
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:31.320
this guy and went,
can I swear on this show?

12
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.370
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Oh she goes yes.
Said,
oh my God,
this is fucking fun.</v>

13
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.880
Massachusetts or something.
Yeah.
I didn't know.

14
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:41.250
I always thought you were in New York.
I didn't know you were Milwaukee.

15
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.170
<v 1>So my mom grew up in the Bronx because I lived,
grew up in exit to which you,</v>

16
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.360
we were talking about,
uh,
in Stockbridge.

17
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.460
I for some reason I adapted that New York thing.
Yeah.

18
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.980
It was not that pocket card and apple,
it was like motherfucker,

19
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.250
you know like the,

20
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.310
<v 0>but that's a weird part of Massachusetts he's talking to exit to on the mass</v>

21
00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:04.000
pike where I was telling you I have one of the worst gigs and Lee Massachusetts

22
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:09.001
starting out but you know leaving there people throw in that time they will

23
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:09.660
just,
they will,

24
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.850
they will board is what I thought and they just want to look and for someone to

25
00:01:12.851 --> 00:01:13.661
beat the shit out of.

26
00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:16.540
And I looked like Ron Howard so that was going to be an easy night for them.

27
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.840
You show them that you know I did.
I didn't,

28
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.120
I just remember standing up there and so bad wanted to say something.

29
00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:28.690
I know all they wanted me to do was just say that one thing and they were like,

30
00:01:28.691 --> 00:01:31.990
cause they had this look on their face like come on,
come on,
freckles say it.

31
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.440
And I was just like I am going to get like curb stomped.

32
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.420
So I didn't say shit and I got paid and they were like following me around like

33
00:01:40.421 --> 00:01:45.160
this group and they like,
they threw this dinner roll at me,
they missed and a,

34
00:01:45.161 --> 00:01:47.260
it was weird.
It was like this weird,
I've told this story before.
It was like,

35
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.070
it was like this function room and next door to it was another function when was

36
00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:51.821
part of this restaurant.

37
00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:55.300
And then the other room was like a bachelor party and there was no closed door

38
00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:58.600
and they just saw me standing there bombing in this restaurant and I just became

39
00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:01.900
this entertainment thing.
And uh,
we sit down currently.

40
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.700
Is there a downtown?
Yeah.
I don't even remember the one stop.
No,
it was,
it was,

41
00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:07.510
I remember it was like,

42
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.730
I remember pulling out of there and it was just like this,

43
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.150
it might be that that bar that they went to in Porky's remember that there was

44
00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:15.100
just in the middle of the fucking woods.
It's like that.

45
00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:16.240
I'm sure it's all developed now.

46
00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:19.930
But I remember when I finally pulled out my little piece of Shit Ranger,

47
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.290
I had my head out the window like ace Ventura going,
fuck yeah,

48
00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:27.190
you fucking kidding.
They were just laughing.
Um,
yeah,

49
00:02:27.191 --> 00:02:30.670
I probably took five years off my life that night.
So anyways,

50
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.250
but that's a weird point in Massachusetts where there's like,

51
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.530
there's patriots fans and giants fans.

52
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.250
You start to get into that because it's 20 minutes from the border,

53
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.990
from the border.
Yeah.
So there's Yankee fans and red sox sense.

54
00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:42.300
It's kind of like Connecticut,
like you know,

55
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.090
sort of halfway through you start getting out that way.
Like who do you root for?

56
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.740
So I guess,
I dunno,
but you're paying parents,

57
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.000
you said your mom was from the Bronx

58
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.970
<v 1>juice from the box.
And my dad was from Patterson,</v>

59
00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:56.140
New Jersey and then they all kind of lived in New York for awhile and then they,

60
00:02:56.141 --> 00:03:00.700
uh,
my dad got he studying paper and chemistry.

61
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:02.940
So in the lead there was a mill there,

62
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.710
there all these little meals up there in new England on the river.

63
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:09.970
And he worked for a division of Kimberly Clark in the drinking water out there

64
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.360
after that Gig.
I'm kidding.
We used to say,
man,

65
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:19.520
if you're in a boat and you fall into that river,
it's acid.

66
00:03:19.521 --> 00:03:24.040
It'll burn you alive and you know,
stunk.
In the summer.
It was so bad.

67
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.570
They just dump chemicals in there to squash it up.

68
00:03:27.571 --> 00:03:28.860
They don't do shit like that anymore.

69
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.230
<v 0>I know.
No,
not at all.
Not at all.
It's all good water.
That's why we got the uh,</v>

70
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.480
water,
the earth and the air.
I know.

71
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.660
That's what's so fucked up about all this shit that people always talking about

72
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:43.150
on social media.
Like it's this big goddamn deal.

73
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:46.550
Like fat shaming and all of this shit.
It's like,
dude,
if those are prompt,

74
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.040
those problems are so down the fucking black.

75
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.250
As far as like what is going on right now.
Yeah.
Well water,

76
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:55.660
all of that.
Yeah.
All this shit.
You know,

77
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:58.780
some place in Africa in one month they're going to run out of water,
period.

78
00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.643
I can't,
I can't,

79
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.800
I can't listen to him because it just cause there's no fucking solution.

80
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:05.320
No one pays attention and then if you try to address it,

81
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.340
conservatives claim liberals and levels bring conservatives and then they just

82
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:10.790
keep plowing ahead and I have fun.

83
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.100
<v 1>I want to hear what I'm going to say.
What are you gonna say?
Well,</v>

84
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.680
let's,
let's stop pretty strong about like,
you know,
people,

85
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.360
people are fucking students.
They're like little kindergarteners still.

86
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.740
I don't care how old you are.
I don't think the world is evolving at all.

87
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.720
Maybe with technology it's the same shit.
I cannot believe.

88
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.930
Like who gives a fuck about that?
And who gives a fuck about that?
Oh really?

89
00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:41.800
You really that uptight about that?
Holy Shit.
Or like,
you know,

90
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.510
some big issues was there won't mention whether it's squabbling,
dude,

91
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.550
just make a little bit.

92
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.690
<v 0>Just this is the thing,
you know,</v>

93
00:04:47.691 --> 00:04:50.030
you have to dance around because you had some big issues that I'm not gonna

94
00:04:50.031 --> 00:04:52.720
remember.
You're upset about this and I know every issue that you fucked.

95
00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:53.530
You're talking about it,

96
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.340
but you can't bring it up because then you have like 80 soccer moms and this

97
00:04:58.341 --> 00:05:02.390
thing 80 soccer moms will actually make the news because they're going to talk

98
00:05:02.391 --> 00:05:05.340
about that.
Okay.
You are whatever fucking reason.
So you gotta,

99
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.090
you gotta kind of make the news that you've got to dance between the raindrops.

100
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.180
I'm to get my ass dude,

101
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.930
we gotta get some padding on this table and he's sort of shifting of weight.

102
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.640
That's right.
Yeah.

103
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.390
<v 1>So anyway,
check.
So,
Oh man,
I'm going to get my ass kicked right now,</v>

104
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:20.290
but I call it,
I grew up western mass,
super liberal,

105
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.360
super democratic,
you know,
uh,
you know,
just everybody's just,

106
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:28.660
when they vote democratic all the way down,
doesn't matter if it was Hitler,

107
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.760
if he's a Democrat,
Democrat side,

108
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.010
I'm just blown away.
I call him vicious liberals.

109
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.620
<v 0>No,
that was been out here.
It's</v>

110
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.250
<v 1>crazy.
Like people are so,
like a real true liberal was my dad,
uh,
liberal.
My Dad,</v>

111
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.780
you know,
we grew up Jewish,

112
00:05:44.781 --> 00:05:49.781
but my dad would listen to Hitler talk just to see what he had to say to,

113
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.950
wouldn't yell at him.

114
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.880
He would talk and then he'd tell Hitler that he was fucked and so many words,

115
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.450
but he would at least taught me.
He like knew the guy or he's watching the tapes,

116
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.270
he's talking to the TV.
He's a true liberal.

117
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.410
I was just thinking like that was the ultimate like fucking odd couple movie

118
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.620
when they like roommates in college is some shit.
No,

119
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:13.460
actually my dad was bombing Hitler was,
he was in a bomb.

120
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:17.420
Was it just leveled Hitler?
But my point is my dad was a true liberal.

121
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:20.060
He would listen to anybody.
Didn't matter what it is,

122
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:23.780
but nowadays it's like a calm,
vicious slippers.
They're like,

123
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.720
they're more conservative and radical.
They totally,

124
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:29.930
a true liberal is somebody who listens and,

125
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.920
and will at least accept somebody else's opinion.

126
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:36.890
No matter how radical it is.
Liberal is,

127
00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:39.260
you're open minded at the fact that you have that opinion.

128
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:43.280
You'll listen to it and everything.
Right,
but you this vicious.
This is like,

129
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.230
it's like,
no,
there's destroying careers.
They will just,

130
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.330
if you had like it's basically we're liberal think what we think but if you

131
00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:52.280
don't we're going to go after your career and it's like,

132
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:55.130
it's no different than I remember what the happened to the Dixie chicks when

133
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:59.390
they just express your opinion about the current president and I remember like

134
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:00.680
Fox News was saying like,

135
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:03.710
well they have a right to state their opinion and we have a right to have,

136
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.350
you know,
state our opinion.
It's like you didn't state your opinion,

137
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.600
you state your opinion,

138
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.180
then you systematically tried to destroy their fucking ability to earn a living

139
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.540
that's not tit for tat.
No.
You know what I mean?
So that's what I'm saying,

140
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:17.600
that sandbox stuff.
I said,
well it's still a bunch of little kids still.

141
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.800
How'd we get on that?

142
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.590
I don't know what I wanted to talk because I know everybody always talks to you

143
00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:23.480
about drumming and all that type of shit.
What?

144
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.350
Nobody doesn't talk to you about to you.
How,
I don't want to say how old you are,

145
00:07:27.351 --> 00:07:29.420
but I'm old.
Okay.
Your all,

146
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.420
how do you stay in the fucking shape you're in your shredded?
Well,
you know,

147
00:07:33.421 --> 00:07:37.970
and this is me kind of out of shape because uh,
uh,
so busy right now,

148
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:39.380
but um,
you know,

149
00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:42.800
what happened was at a certain point in my life and it was early,

150
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:47.801
it was like when I was with Mellencamp and I might have been 27 coming out of a

151
00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:52.540
pretty wild time party wise,
you know,
and suddenly went,
this ain't right.

152
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.230
I think clicked in my head.

153
00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.560
Now I'm not saying I remember what party you are at and what you are looking at

154
00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:58.910
to be like,
I'm a part of this.

155
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.850
I can't judge this five year period,
dude,

156
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.480
the party
kind of

157
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.660
something to 19 something that party,

158
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:15.190
you mean it was like I was open for business.
It was,
was it,

159
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.610
was it something that it was a feeling that was gradually working at you or just

160
00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:23.060
just one night just boogie nights.
Shit happen.
You were just like,
all right,

161
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.540
I got to stop this.
Well,
first of all,
the environment I was in was just,

162
00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:30.050
it was just who was just a bunch of kids in rock bands is partying and shit was

163
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:31.110
available,
you know,
and,

164
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:36.310
and you're drinking and you and I had abundance of energy.
So,
you know,
I,

165
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:40.100
I just,
if I drank too much,
I wake up next,
aw,
that sucks.

166
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.760
And then just go right.
But what happened was,
so they,
I just started,

167
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:49.580
I said my stomach started feeling like I couldn't,
when I was eating,
I was like,

168
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.540
it was a,
wasn't digesting food wheel good.
I was just beating myself up.

169
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:58.380
I wasn't taking care of myself.
And during that time I was,
I was always a jock.

170
00:08:58.381 --> 00:09:01.960
I was a three letter men jock in high school Lacrosse,

171
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:07.140
a ski team and a soccer east coast shit,
you know.
And uh,

172
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:11.550
I ended up going to Umass for music and my freshman year I was on the Lacrosse

173
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.310
team.
That was the number one,
Lacrosse,
number nine,

174
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.570
the cost team in the countries that or Boston Amhurst.

175
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.290
And I went there as a party school.
I used to have like when I was growing up,

176
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:26.160
once a year,
somebody died at southwest that jump off the building or something?

177
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.530
<v 0>No,
they would ride the elevators.</v>

178
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.520
They would ride the elevators surfing and somebody every year would fall down

179
00:09:31.521 --> 00:09:36.290
the fucking shaft.
Oh,
did you go?
Did you go there?
I went to Umass.

180
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.910
I went everywhere.
I went,
every dude I fucking,
I,
whenever I went to Umass Boston,

181
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.470
uh,

182
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.500
NC state Emerson and it was accepted at northeastern,

183
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.920
I think.
I can't remember.
I just,
I just sort of bounced around and,
uh,

184
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.760
I hated school.
I hated it.
I just wasn't in your thing.

185
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.240
I didn't,
yeah,
I just didn't give a F.
I just want to get the fuck out of it.

186
00:09:59.241 --> 00:10:01.580
And I wanted to do,
have fun.
I wanted to play drums.

187
00:10:01.581 --> 00:10:05.630
I wanted to joke around and wanted to drink.
No Kid.
Really.
Yeah.

188
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.200
That's what I wanted to do.
And there was a few subjects that I would,

189
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.960
I would like some history,
but I can't fucking,
yeah.
Old,

190
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.560
<v 1>old,
old shit.
And I'm saying,
yeah,
I,</v>

191
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.870
I had a purpose in college so it worked out.
But Oh,
you went,

192
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.270
like I was hardcore classical.
I know there was no school of rock.

193
00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:28.080
Berkeley was still mostly a jazz school,
seeing my family,

194
00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:31.140
everybody went to college.
So,
you know,
but at that time it's like you do.

195
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.860
So I'm a,
I'll be a music major and I was self taught drummer,
you know,

196
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:39.530
and there was this one kid in stock,
but it was getting better.
And uh,
it's like,

197
00:10:39.531 --> 00:10:40.380
can,
what are you doing?
Well,

198
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:43.440
I'm taking lessons from this percussions from the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

199
00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:48.410
Art depressed lived in,
uh,
you'll know,
uh,
not,
not yet.

200
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.780
No,
no,
no.
He lived in Newton,
Newton.
So,
um,

201
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.960
it's the first time.
So I went,
okay,

202
00:10:54.961 --> 00:10:57.180
I'm going to take a lesson with this guy because I was real competitive,

203
00:10:57.181 --> 00:11:01.380
you know,
just being a jock and all.
And I had long hair down my shoulders.

204
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:04.860
So it was a hippy jock,
you know,
so,
and I was always playing in the band.

205
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:06.300
I was always,

206
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.720
I was really popular in high school and I have identical twin brother,

207
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.400
so we both were in the bands.
Both on sports teams had long hair.
Yeah.

208
00:11:14.401 --> 00:11:18.330
Heckle and Jeckle and we were like,
did you start in lethal weapon at any point?

209
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:23.190
That's how I'm thinking you guys with the long blonde hair.
So

210
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.060
I go down there,
I'll never forget when I go down to Newton on a bus,

211
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.090
Greyhound bus from Lee,
that's it from me.

212
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.200
But I was hung over because I had been hanging out with the varsity football

213
00:11:37.201 --> 00:11:38.010
team,

214
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:42.150
varsity soccer team and the cheerleaders the night before drinking vodka on a

215
00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:43.360
mountain.
You know what that is?

216
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:48.540
Fire drinking vodka that night and didn't get laid,

217
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.990
but you know,
I was hanging with those old,
you know,
two years in high school.

218
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.100
That's old chick.
Right.
You know what I mean?

219
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:58.330
That's like big time it bigger tits again,
get everything is more developed,

220
00:11:58.331 --> 00:12:00.170
you know.
So anyway,
yeah,

221
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.130
I get to Newton,
I'm like,
whoa.
I bought,
was in the back,

222
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.520
probably puking in the bus and I get there and this is Arthur press,

223
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:13.750
his old school.
He goes,
what's your name?
He says,
Kenny Kenny what?

224
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.220
Uh,
Kenny Aronoff.
He says,
what have you prepared for me today?

225
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.590
Oh No.
You know what?
If you put what?
Um,
uh,

226
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.270
we'll do you play malates I'm like,
what's malice?
He said,

227
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:32.080
Marimba vibes.
I said,
no,
I'm getting smaller and smaller.

228
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.320
This is old school guy,
man.
This guy is hardcore.
Then he goes,

229
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:40.330
would you prepare a Timpani pieces?
I don't play Timpani.
What do you play?

230
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:44.520
This is what played drum set.
Well,
come on down here,
let's say,
see play.

231
00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.340
Some concept puts on spinning wheels by blood,
sweat and tears.

232
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.430
And I actually been jamming to that and my barn,

233
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:55.280
I had a barn and western mass and that's where we had all our rock bands.

234
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.540
My parents lived every,
we always had the rock bands were rehearsing at my place.

235
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.200
It's got a barn.
And my parents loved it because they,
the kids were at home.

236
00:13:02.201 --> 00:13:05.800
Even when we were smoking pot and drinking,
they just,
there we were,
you know,

237
00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.100
so I sit down in 30 minutes,

238
00:13:09.101 --> 00:13:14.101
he ripped me off the off the drum set and points to a rubber black pad.

239
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.060
<v 0>Well,
how did you feel you were applying?
You?
Look,
I always spinning.</v>

240
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.150
I'm going to nail this.

241
00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.170
<v 1>I was feeling it.
I thought I was good,
but he didn't think so.</v>

242
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:26.300
So he puts it on the pad that basically he kicked my ass.

243
00:13:26.301 --> 00:13:28.250
And that was a pivotal point in my life.
I'm like,

244
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.290
a lot of kids would have gone fuck this man.
I don't,
I don't need you.

245
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.580
I'm playing in a rock band.
I'm getting laid,
I'm having fun.
What do I need?

246
00:13:37.581 --> 00:13:38.540
This fucking shit.

247
00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:43.280
But something clicked and I have to say it's in my DNA that this is good for me.

248
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:44.503
And I,

249
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:50.350
my dad bought me a old set of vibes for $300 from Carol's music in New York.

250
00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.510
And now I had that and I,

251
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.790
<v 0>she was sports background,
um,
gave you that,</v>

252
00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.250
that you,
that made you not afraid of like,
oh,
new information.
This guy,

253
00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.760
this guy's been hard on me because this guy seems like a coach to me.

254
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.180
He was totally cool.
Yeah,
you're walking in like the blue chip prospect a,

255
00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:10.400
I've got this all down and then he just goes,
you don't know shit.

256
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.210
<v 1>Yeah.
It wasn't,
no.
Did the cause back then.</v>

257
00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:16.960
You don't mean the coaches back then were like marine sergeants.
There was,

258
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.310
back then it was no handholding,
there's no cartilage,
there was no internet,

259
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:22.443
there was none of this.

260
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.130
<v 0>She should,</v>

261
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:26.120
they look at athletes now like they're all a bunch of date rapists and all this.

262
00:14:26.121 --> 00:14:27.380
They with Frat boys and all that.

263
00:14:27.381 --> 00:14:31.640
And they totally lose like the confidence that you get from playing sports,

264
00:14:31.641 --> 00:14:33.590
the a,
the ability to work with a group,

265
00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.430
the ability to get your fucking ass kicked and lose and shake it off like links

266
00:14:37.431 --> 00:14:39.410
to a couple of water and when the next quarter,
because yeah,

267
00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:42.950
you learn all this great stuff,
but now it's just Kinda,
you know,

268
00:14:42.951 --> 00:14:44.510
it's sort of like the nerd time.

269
00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.780
So like their perspective and they don't fucking play sports.

270
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.960
So their perspective of it is as is as fucked up,

271
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.170
be fair is the jocks perspective of them,
you know?

272
00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.070
<v 1>Well,
you know what,
while they're sitting there being entitled,</v>

273
00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.130
waiting for Shit to happen and,
and,
and pussyfooting around,

274
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.810
I'm going to go over them and take what they're waiting for and I'm sorry I am

275
00:15:04.811 --> 00:15:08.690
not let it back down on it.
That's how,
that's how it works.
So I mean,
back then,

276
00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:09.221
you know,

277
00:15:09.221 --> 00:15:14.221
it's like my parents were really sensitive and cool but bad dude get you ass up.

278
00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.200
There was no,
no,
no handholding or titled.

279
00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.130
I'm grateful that

280
00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:24.240
<v 0>I decided with the teacher,
the teacher said,
your kids acting like an asshole.</v>

281
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.750
They would look at you and bill,
what's your problem?
Like an asshole instead of

282
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.020
take out their cell phone,

283
00:15:31.021 --> 00:15:35.100
video and then the teacher has to apologize because you're not raising your kid,

284
00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:35.990
right?
I,

285
00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:39.930
you're dumping this douche offered school and they have to deal with your bad

286
00:15:39.931 --> 00:15:43.170
parenting for six hours,
eight hours a fucking week.

287
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.940
I mean teachers are grossly,
grossly underpaid.
Oh too closely.
And to pay those,

288
00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:49.950
why would you want to be a teacher?

289
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.280
It's like you've got not only you got everybody against you or not.

290
00:15:53.281 --> 00:15:55.640
Now with all these little fucking kids there and,
and you,

291
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:59.520
you do anything it seems they take out a camera and then they're automatically,

292
00:15:59.521 --> 00:16:02.250
right.
Dude,
it's brutal man.
I Dunno,
I'll tell you,

293
00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.220
we do sound like a bunch of old guys going,
oh my God,
he's catch today.

294
00:16:05.221 --> 00:16:08.520
But there is an element of like,
Geez,
you know what?
Fuck him.

295
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:12.630
You know what I missed.
I'm writing it off.
Shake it off.
Okay,
so check this out.

296
00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:13.530
I really do

297
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:17.760
<v 1>believe that people should embrace the fear,
the anger,</v>

298
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:22.560
embarrassment,
failure,
all that negative stuff.
I believe you should squeeze it,

299
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:26.460
hug it,
throw it away and get your fucking ass in gear and move forward.

300
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.090
<v 0>What is some of your top like five or whatever,
three,
four,</v>

301
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:35.020
five most embarrassing moments that you had on your way up to become an hotel?

302
00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.650
<v 1>The worst was so I,
I this,</v>

303
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.710
I know we keep getting all I find she studied classical music.

304
00:16:40.711 --> 00:16:45.420
I got to go to school choice.
I get into umass barely again into umass,

305
00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:49.930
barely.
But the guy he put up like some Marimba music,
I'd never played Marimba.

306
00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.860
I'd played five,
puts it up on the site and meeting it and I suck.

307
00:16:52.861 --> 00:16:55.010
I miss every note.
He takes it away.
Wait,
no,

308
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:56.960
<v 0>give it back.
It's a Marimba.</v>

309
00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.220
That's not the Lionel Hampton thing is that's the vibe

310
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.441
<v 1>members wouldn't,</v>

311
00:17:00.441 --> 00:17:05.260
it's long and you learn classical like violin music on it so that you can learn,

312
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:08.630
you know about harmony and scales and you become not just a drummer,

313
00:17:08.631 --> 00:17:12.350
but you come a well rounded musician.
So I didn't realize this,

314
00:17:12.351 --> 00:17:15.050
but when I go read,
wrote my books next to him,
jog log,
it does.

315
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:18.380
I really am a fighter fight guy,
not a fight or flight guy.

316
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.480
That's DNA,
you know.
So anyway,
he,

317
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:24.780
I demanded that music back and I just wouldn't give up and that's,

318
00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.700
he went along and I love teaching this guy.
This guy wants to work.

319
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.710
So bottom line is,
who's this chick there?

320
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.910
You bombed on that thing and he was just like,
this isn't right for you.
And you,

321
00:17:33.911 --> 00:17:37.190
you know,
he,
I,
you know,
part of your,

322
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.600
when you auditioned for school in classical music,

323
00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:42.110
you have to perform on snare drum.
You have a piece,

324
00:17:42.111 --> 00:17:45.890
you prepare it and then he's going to want to ask you rudiments technique and

325
00:17:45.891 --> 00:17:50.570
then sight read music.
Same with mallets.
You prepare a pieces.
You say,
well,

326
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:55.430
give me a c major scale.
Give me a d minor scale,
give me a play an Arpeggio,

327
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.040
give me an augmented chord.
And then,
uh,

328
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.210
and they give you a sheet what they're going to test you on.

329
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.420
But then they put that music up that,
you know,
you've never seen.

330
00:18:03.421 --> 00:18:08.190
You got to play in rhythm and,
and hit all the notes.
And I always sucked at that.

331
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.630
And
by the time I graduated Indiana University,

332
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:17.400
I want a concerto competition where I was,
um,
I can play it.

333
00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:18.210
I got it.
It's,

334
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:23.210
it's a violin concerto that I saw Itzhak Perlman play as his encore virtuosic

335
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.713
beautiful piece.

336
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:28.770
And I knew in my senior year I was going to have to play a virtuosic violin

337
00:18:28.771 --> 00:18:32.700
concerto or a violin piece on Marimba to pass Indiana.

338
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.990
I went from Umass to four years of Indiana,
which was the number one school.

339
00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:40.350
That school,
my teacher was like a navy seal commander.

340
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.800
It's like he would try to wash you out because the school was number one.

341
00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:48.930
It had to keep that status,
so anybody who's not capable,
they would wash you out.

342
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.260
He would just,
I'm going to get the embarrassing moment,

343
00:18:52.261 --> 00:18:56.490
this guide walk in and he'd be like,
look,
taking notes on the last student,

344
00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.450
and he'd be,
he'd hit the desk,
which meant give me your lesson book.

345
00:19:00.451 --> 00:19:03.750
He'd open it up if he's still taking notes.
She looked at it and go,
Oh,

346
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.740
F sharp harmonic minor two octaves,
don't you?
Right.
Hands three,

347
00:19:07.741 --> 00:19:12.360
four and I'm still standing there with my book bag.
He looks at me goes,

348
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:18.000
are you happy here at Indiana University?
Kenny,
do you want to stay here?

349
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:22.230
I'm like,
Holy Shit.
Jesus.
When you walk in,

350
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.530
you get your ass in front of the instrument and be ready to play.

351
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.070
You never know when a conductor is going to walk and say three,
four,
let's go.

352
00:19:29.071 --> 00:19:34.020
You have to be ready.
He was training you to be a marine.
And this stuff carried,

353
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:39.390
carried forward into my entire life.
So anyway,
I met,
I met at,
at,

354
00:19:39.391 --> 00:19:43.530
at,
at Umass,
and this is hot jr just chicks talking about,

355
00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.530
tell us it's as hot as you can be in classical music.

356
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.450
It's not like rock and roll.
But then when she was the hottest shoes,

357
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.180
classical hot,
classical,
hot,

358
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.090
I hear a powdered wig.
Nice tents in a potter wick.

359
00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:01.630
It's funny I hear that she's going to go to this place called Aspen School of

360
00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:06.180
music.
It's one by Julliard.
So all I'm thinking is chick,

361
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.910
you know,
and I'm like,
oh I'm going to go,
I've got a coat.

362
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.470
I don't realize it's one by Julio,

363
00:20:10.471 --> 00:20:13.820
which is the number two school in the country and it's,

364
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.540
I'm not going to get in.
So,
but the sheet they tell you,

365
00:20:18.541 --> 00:20:22.980
you got to prepare in the audition from four to three out of the four different

366
00:20:22.981 --> 00:20:26.820
areas,
snare drum,
Timpani,
Malik's and multiple percussion.

367
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.800
So I audition on a four cause I'm not that great yet.
So the pieces are,

368
00:20:31.801 --> 00:20:34.830
you know,
kind of like beginner,
intermediate.

369
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:39.450
I send the tape and I don't hear it from them.
Last Day of school,

370
00:20:39.451 --> 00:20:43.140
I got my dad's station wagon.
I'm going to leave a umass.

371
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.620
So my summer was a study with Arthur press had this cool band,

372
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:49.600
Allman brothers band.
And I had this girlfriend

373
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.770
that didn't know about the cellist.
But anyway,
I,
uh,
I'm,

374
00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:59.770
I'm leaving Amhurst and I went,
Oh shit,
I forgot to check my mail and go back.

375
00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:03.150
And they told the male I had some mail and it looks like you've got to check and

376
00:21:03.151 --> 00:21:03.984
went,
oh shit,

377
00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.500
what's this open up excepted to aspen two weeks before.

378
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:09.730
So it must have been,

379
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:14.650
somebody must've canceled because you don't tell somebody two weeks before.

380
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:19.750
So two weeks later I go to aspen.
By the way,
the trick didn't show up.

381
00:21:19.751 --> 00:21:23.890
She didn't go,
oh,
the classical,
she did not go.
So I'm there,
dude.

382
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.390
I was,
they went to the doers.
Worst percussionists there.

383
00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:32.080
All these kids with Julliard prep had been playing Timpani Marimba when they

384
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:36.700
were in diapers.
You know,
I'm doing scales,
Doo,
Doo,
Doo,
Doo,
Doo,
Doo,

385
00:21:36.701 --> 00:21:39.910
Doo Doo.
And they're going playing these Bach partitas.

386
00:21:39.911 --> 00:21:42.190
And virtuosic shit.

387
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:46.750
And I have a picture of me with all those people.

388
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.310
And the funny thing is it's kind of like your story.
Worst guy there.

389
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.960
I became the most,
I mean as far as famous visual guy,

390
00:21:55.961 --> 00:22:00.160
out of all of them a lot.
Some went became lawyers,
some became,

391
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.840
this came that one guy did get a Timpani job in San Francisco Orchestra,

392
00:22:04.841 --> 00:22:09.250
which is big,
but nobody became visible and a rock star like me.

393
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.580
I'm not saying I'm better,
I'm just saying it's just ironic.
I thought,
okay.

394
00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.250
I thought when I was there as a piece of shit cause okay,

395
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:19.900
one day I'm in rehearsal,
orchestra rehearsal.

396
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.160
We're playing a Tchaikovsky symphony or something or Romeo and Juliet and the

397
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:28.890
orchestra is going [inaudible] and then they stop and assembles gold.

398
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.890
It's a whole for me.
Well I'm counting,

399
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:37.390
I didn't know what I should have done is studied the music and just pretty much

400
00:22:37.391 --> 00:22:40.870
memorize eight measures before you come in.
She's going to have to count.

401
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:46.170
You don't have to worry about counting the Firelands do [inaudible] not me.

402
00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:51.331
I'm going 100 100 to 103 104 why don't wait,

403
00:22:52.901 --> 00:22:56.620
what is it?
Wait,
100 101 two,

404
00:22:56.621 --> 00:23:01.621
341013102 I'm up to 300 and what's that one oh one oh,

405
00:23:02.411 --> 00:23:07.090
was that what?
Oh,
to come.
Fuck.
I'd come in in the wrong place.

406
00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:11.020
This motherfucker,
he didn't just go,
excuse me.

407
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:15.670
He wasn't playing cymbals,
the hallmarks or turns around.

408
00:23:15.671 --> 00:23:16.900
I'm peeing in my pants,

409
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.280
so me embarrassed and he says,

410
00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:27.550
guilt.
You know when to come in,
count from me.
Uh,
okay.
So I stopped counting.

411
00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.810
I kind of like 200 measures.
He's just trying to ridicule me.

412
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:36.870
Who's an asshole and I get to the point where I'm supposed to come in and I

413
00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:40.870
don't play.
What did you play?
I said,

414
00:23:40.871 --> 00:23:44.560
you said count his say place Jesus to sunrise.
Me.

415
00:23:44.561 --> 00:23:46.010
That fucking was that movie with a

416
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.680
<v 0>guy was playing the drum slash yeah,
the guy kept yelling.
I couldn't,</v>

417
00:23:48.681 --> 00:23:51.830
I couldn't watch the movie.
Yeah.
I was just like,
just join a different band.

418
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.400
Why would you sit here and let somebody,
if I've had a kid,

419
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:58.550
let somebody talk to them to that level.

420
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.670
It's like one thing of just trying to make you better,

421
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.050
but like when it gets to the point,

422
00:24:03.051 --> 00:24:07.130
somebody was like taking their life out on you,
you know?
Or at least push back.

423
00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:11.060
You know,
why don't you,
why don't you go fuck yourself.
Get one of those.
Yeah.

424
00:24:11.061 --> 00:24:14.420
I know it was Spencer more instead of sitting there.
I don't know.

425
00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.280
That kind of goes against what we've been talking about earlier where we were

426
00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.460
saying like,
you know,
you've got to take his little bit.
It's both.

427
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.130
There's this bullet.

428
00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:23.580
<v 1>Yeah,
it's a skill.
It's always a skill.
What weighs heavier?</v>

429
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.600
Me Punching him in the face or verbally telling them and get my ass kicked and

430
00:24:27.601 --> 00:24:31.890
fired.
Is that more important than hanging in here and just getting better?

431
00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:35.310
You make a decisions.
Always a scale to me.
You know,

432
00:24:35.311 --> 00:24:40.311
it's like the coach that's up your ass or the teacher in many cases or some of

433
00:24:40.861 --> 00:24:45.600
the people I've worked for and you go,
you know,
I remember people telling me,

434
00:24:45.601 --> 00:24:48.240
I won't mention names,
just say I can't believe you put up with that shit.

435
00:24:48.241 --> 00:24:53.170
And I'm like,
well number one hit single on the radio right now.
I know.

436
00:24:53.171 --> 00:24:54.004
I mean it's like

437
00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:56.450
<v 0>you didn't go on the road with them.
It was just a studio gig.
No,</v>

438
00:24:56.451 --> 00:24:59.490
it was full blown.
Oh,
on the road.
Yeah.
You know,

439
00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:02.950
I've been so fucking lucky in this business and I also think it's because when I

440
00:25:02.951 --> 00:25:06.700
finally started doing shit in this business where like it used to be back in the

441
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.100
day,
there was like 20 giant slices of Pie.

442
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:13.480
And so there was always sort of like 20 people at any moment who just could snap

443
00:25:13.481 --> 00:25:15.130
their fingers in.
The whole world had to move.

444
00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:19.330
And now it just seems like each one of those 20 slices has been chopped up a

445
00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:23.050
million times.
So it's like you,
you can't be an asshole anymore.

446
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.580
You know what I mean?
Did you call it sorta like,
can't be that,
uh,
you know,

447
00:25:27.581 --> 00:25:31.640
tipping over the craft service table and I refuse to come out of my trailer and

448
00:25:31.641 --> 00:25:34.910
said,
are you telling me that my career is over since we've been caulking

449
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.680
let me band?
No,
I've,
I've definitely like,
I've never on,

450
00:25:41.681 --> 00:25:45.130
on any,
like on any acting Gig,
everybody I've ever worked with,

451
00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:49.960
they always showed up on time and you hear all these stories.
I've never had,

452
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.790
I've only been a course doing that stuff for like the last few years,
but I've,

453
00:25:53.791 --> 00:25:57.100
I've never run into that.
But then you always heard these stories,
you know,

454
00:25:57.101 --> 00:25:58.960
I first got into this business about,
you know,

455
00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:02.560
people would get like a sitcom and then all of a sudden the creators of the show

456
00:26:02.561 --> 00:26:07.060
are banned from the set and uh,
they refused to do the lines.

457
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:10.300
They're tank and table reads because they're mad at the writers,

458
00:26:10.301 --> 00:26:12.220
all of that Shit.
I never saw any of that.

459
00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.520
<v 1>That's because now there's somebody sitting eight,</v>

460
00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.670
there's a hundred people behind you.

461
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.470
What did it take you gig for a third of the pay in rock and roll?

462
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.710
Well,
I hear you want to go on tour,
I won't mention names.

463
00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:30.690
Some chick's doing stadiums and they're paying the musicians that I'm like,

464
00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:36.540
are you kidding me?
I said,
that's,
I used to make that in a day recording.

465
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:42.100
They used to and the thing is is that there's kids who go out and do it for half

466
00:26:42.361 --> 00:26:43.980
as much in a room asleep

467
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.750
<v 0>on the floor just to do it.
I said unbelievable run of mine.
Tell me about that.</v>

468
00:26:48.751 --> 00:26:52.630
Doing like some giant like stay like where the Falcons a plant.
Yeah.

469
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.910
And he was just going through it.
If you knew the money that he will make an,

470
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.940
it's just like the,
the artists gets all of it.
Yeah.
And then you know,
yeah,

471
00:26:59.941 --> 00:27:01.890
we're going back,
I'm sleeping in the bathtub,

472
00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:04.050
this other guy sleeping in the bed and blah,
blah blah.
And it's just,

473
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.950
what happened was the accountants got control of the business accounts and the

474
00:27:07.951 --> 00:27:12.951
business people and where the artists thought and they suck up to the artists.

475
00:27:13.141 --> 00:27:15.990
You know,
artists are happy because you're saving money.

476
00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.490
<v 1>Saving.
Well,
I'm saying you this amount of money,</v>

477
00:27:18.491 --> 00:27:21.640
if you put these people there and you paid them this and you're this and you're

478
00:27:21.641 --> 00:27:24.190
that and you know,
that'll give anybody a hard on you.

479
00:27:24.191 --> 00:27:25.810
Especially if you were a struggling musician.

480
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:29.800
This is a point in the fork in the road where I think a struggling musician

481
00:27:29.801 --> 00:27:33.850
either becomes the person that was kind of keeping them down

482
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.590
<v 0>or they go,
that's not the way that treat people.
Right.
And they,</v>

483
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:40.700
most of them don't.
They become just like that or worse.

484
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.270
I've worked with these guys where,
you know,
they kind of like,
they got screwed.

485
00:27:44.271 --> 00:27:48.250
Yeah.
They got screwed by the label.
They got screwed like by managers.
It good.

486
00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:53.150
Yeah,
but that doesn't mean you screw your band.
I saw a guy saw guy recently,

487
00:27:53.151 --> 00:27:55.600
I was watching one of these is called side man.
Yeah.

488
00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:59.480
That was something that I think or did something and that there's a guy in that

489
00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:04.790
and he's the black blues guys.
No,
no,
no.
This is just talking about hired gun,

490
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:08.090
like a hired gun.
So this guy,

491
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:13.260
basically this guy was a in the on,
what's the story?
All right,
it was,

492
00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.490
it was the nine inch nails.
Oh,
I know all those guys.
I know both sides.

493
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:18.740
So there was a guy I know and he,

494
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:23.540
he becomes the guy that was treating him a certain way.
He went and became,

495
00:28:23.541 --> 00:28:27.710
that guy goes,
hey man,
hey man,
cause you're going onto to a giant house.

496
00:28:27.711 --> 00:28:30.380
The end of this tour,
I'm going back to live with my parents.
He goes a basement.

497
00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:33.140
Yeah.
He goes,
you want to make some money,
right.
A record.

498
00:28:33.141 --> 00:28:37.460
So he went out and he wrote a record and then he turned around and he did the

499
00:28:37.461 --> 00:28:39.020
exact same thing to all those people.

500
00:28:39.021 --> 00:28:41.700
I thought he would have eased off the gas a little bit.
You know what I mean?
He,

501
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.810
I like,
no,
fuck you man.
That's,
this is the game.
This is the game.

502
00:28:44.811 --> 00:28:47.690
So I s I watched it.
I didn't know how to feel about it.

503
00:28:47.691 --> 00:28:49.940
Like I was sitting there going like,
well I wouldn't do that shit.

504
00:28:49.941 --> 00:28:52.190
But it's easy for me as a comedian because you know,

505
00:28:52.191 --> 00:28:55.470
we don't have to split the money as far as with like other bands.
Yes.
You know,

506
00:28:55.471 --> 00:28:57.140
it's just all the other shit taxes.
Yeah.

507
00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.270
<v 1>Well I mean,
but the,
but the,
you know,</v>

508
00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.110
not to defend him or that position is that,

509
00:29:03.111 --> 00:29:07.160
that's the business makes could make you feel like,
you know,

510
00:29:07.161 --> 00:29:11.240
I got just beat up so much that now it's my turn to be on top and fuck everybody

511
00:29:11.241 --> 00:29:13.940
else.
That kind of thing.
It can do that.
But

512
00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:16.990
<v 0>there was that,
that was a time like that and stand up.</v>

513
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.640
It was a certain comedy club and uh,

514
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:25.510
it was just a really bad time for it.
And it just had this really negative vibe.

515
00:29:25.511 --> 00:29:29.890
And there was all of these guys that at the time had TV shows and movie careers

516
00:29:29.891 --> 00:29:34.891
and they would come down to the club and they would do like an hour and a half,

517
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:40.080
two hours,
not worked out any material,
just leaning on the mic stand guy ass.

518
00:29:40.081 --> 00:29:44.020
So what else is going and just showing off that they could burn the light and

519
00:29:44.021 --> 00:29:47.830
meanwhile would bump like 20 comics.

520
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.600
And like people just start saying,
you know,

521
00:29:49.601 --> 00:29:52.720
and then you couldn't say I'm going home because then the club would get mad at

522
00:29:52.721 --> 00:29:53.110
you.

523
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:57.610
So you would literally go from having like an 11 o'clock spot to waiting around

524
00:29:57.611 --> 00:29:59.830
to like two 30 in the morning.
There would be nobody there.

525
00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:02.170
And this was every fucking night.

526
00:30:02.171 --> 00:30:06.670
And you felt that energy in the back of the club of certain comics being like,

527
00:30:06.671 --> 00:30:08.580
man,
I can't wait til I get a fucking Sitcom.

528
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.840
I'm going up there and I'm going to fucking burn the light.

529
00:30:10.841 --> 00:30:15.490
I'm gonna make everybody else way.
And fortunately,
right around that time,

530
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.620
uh,
uh,

531
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:20.620
the Seinfeld show was ending and I would never forget it was down in the Improv

532
00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:25.000
on Melrose.
And Jerry Seinfeld came in to do a set end.

533
00:30:25.001 --> 00:30:29.710
He had to do 20 minutes and he did 20 minutes.
He came up with shit that worked.

534
00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.430
And then in the middle he tried out some new stuff,
had a big closer,

535
00:30:33.431 --> 00:30:36.310
and then he just went around,
hey,
any questions,
bing,
Bang,
boom,

536
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:41.090
and done and walked off that same club that you would know this was a the,

537
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:44.080
that sets a great example.
That's what I was sitting in it.
And I remember.

538
00:30:44.081 --> 00:30:46.600
And then wanting them,
oh,
don't leave,
you know,
leave them wanting more,

539
00:30:46.601 --> 00:30:51.220
all of that shit.
And I was just like,
he was Tro,
tro,
total fucking pro.

540
00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:54.600
And I just remember thinking like,
that's how you do it.
That's how you do it.
And,

541
00:30:54.601 --> 00:30:59.601
and the thing you were there and every comic like who watched left excited that

542
00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:03.940
they got to see him work and do his thing and then you don't give a shit if you

543
00:31:03.941 --> 00:31:06.310
get bumped 20 minutes to see Seinfeld.
Yeah.
But you know,

544
00:31:06.311 --> 00:31:09.250
if he went up there and for fucking two hours,
yeah.
Torture.

545
00:31:09.251 --> 00:31:13.600
There was a meandering,
you know,
had a little fucking piece of,
you know,

546
00:31:13.601 --> 00:31:15.910
just going up there,
being famous just to be famous.

547
00:31:15.911 --> 00:31:18.460
And the fact that he didn't do it,
I meant that always stuck with me.
I'm like,

548
00:31:18.461 --> 00:31:22.510
all right,
that's,

the sunset Marquis member,
the whiskey bar,

644
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:29.990
the whiskey bourbon whiskey bar in the sunset Marquis hotel hotels,

645
00:37:29.991 --> 00:37:33.540
the bar in the sunset marquee,
you know that,
that said the hotel,

646
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:38.220
it's a kind of a boutique hotel.
All the WHO's go a few on Alta Loma,

647
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:43.230
uh,
go down the hill off of sunset in there.
Okay.
It was,
I mean,
every,

648
00:37:43.231 --> 00:37:47.130
I mean,
you walk in there and be Jeff back,
it'd be you two.
It'd be the stones.

649
00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.400
It was and only could hold 75 people is really intimate.

650
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.440
All the rock bands would stay there.

651
00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:57.030
So I'm standing there and I'm doing a record with the Tony Iommi and Billy

652
00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:01.980
Corgan from the Pam,
uh,
Tony Iommi from Sabbath.
So doing a solo record and those,

653
00:38:01.981 --> 00:38:05.660
that was a 13 hours session that one day,
uh,

654
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:09.490
with 45 minute break,
you do cheese,
this is,

655
00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:13.080
this is to be real bad as such.
But,
and you know,

656
00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.070
you know,
no,
no vocals listened to.
It was just,

657
00:38:17.071 --> 00:38:20.290
we were writing the song right there,
three movements and bill,

658
00:38:20.291 --> 00:38:23.490
it doesn't fuck around.
It's not a party time.
It's fucking all work.

659
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:28.880
So that night I'm sitting in there having a drink with Tony and a whole bunch of

660
00:38:29.251 --> 00:38:32.490
shit happened at night.
I think it,
that might be in the book,
but I also know,

661
00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:33.480
she told me Myers,

662
00:38:33.481 --> 00:38:36.850
I just left the Mellencamp band two years prior and I've been in that band for

663
00:38:36.851 --> 00:38:38.860
17 years.
So it was like a divorce.

664
00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:42.130
All of a sudden I see the bass player come running out of the bar.
I'm in the,

665
00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:45.820
in the lobby because it was,
it was two filled and he's like,
fuck this.

666
00:38:45.821 --> 00:38:49.610
And he's pissed.
I'm like,
Toby,
what's going on man?
He says,
AH,
fuck it.

667
00:38:49.611 --> 00:38:52.780
He gets the elevator takes off.
I'm like,
wow,
what's going on?

668
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:57.280
I walk in there and there's the Mellencamp band.
So it was kind of a,
an emotional

669
00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:03.790
tug,
a divorce and seeing your ex wife suddenly and the new drummer,
you know,

670
00:39:03.791 --> 00:39:05.890
and he's,
it's awkward,
you know,

671
00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:10.830
but then I look over out in the courtyard and there was the tour manager for,
uh,

672
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:14.890
uh,
the Pumpkin's about six,
eight and he brings me over the bottom line.

673
00:39:14.891 --> 00:39:18.610
Is he smiling?
He just wanted to see what it'd be like.

674
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.390
I saw Cameron Diaz says she just doesn't that big first movie.

675
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:26.680
Something about Mary and some guys talking to her.
And the bottom line is,

676
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:30.580
it was Jimmy Chamberlain Dorma from the Pumpkin's.
He wanted to see us connect,

677
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.410
you know,
me,
what would happen.
Anyway,
he,

678
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:37.120
he said some drinks and stuff and he's just talking to her and I,

679
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.110
I was just so uptight from everything going on that day.

680
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:44.020
And then the Mellencamp band and like,
ah,
you know,

681
00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:47.770
bottom line is Jimmy and I,
he tapped and Jimmy,

682
00:39:47.771 --> 00:39:50.650
Jimmy and I just can't top what it was,
didn't work out the way I wanted to.

683
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.850
So I stood there and I'm like,
that's not how I wanted meet Jimmy Chamberlain.

684
00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.600
I cool down when I tapped him on the shoulder and said,
Jimmy,
listen.
Ah Man,
I uh,

685
00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:03.220
I respect you so much.
You are one of my favorite dramas.

686
00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.630
Banis I feel so honored to be playing in your band too.

687
00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.600
It's just,
God damn,
I didn't,
I'm sorry.

688
00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.340
I've met you like this and I would love to just tell you how much I appreciate

689
00:40:15.341 --> 00:40:20.020
you.
And then I walked off,
it's about two in the morning.

690
00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:23.350
The bar closes up comes comedy is lands in my lap,

691
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.980
put your arms around me,
lands in my lap.

692
00:40:26.981 --> 00:40:31.180
Now I'm 1998 so I was like,

693
00:40:31.181 --> 00:40:35.440
just a ball testosterone.
And my normal game of play was like,

694
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.470
if a chick lands on your lab at two in the morning,

695
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:43.390
what do you think you could say or do?
Right.
So,
but this is Cameron Diaz,

696
00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.360
gorgeous hot.
And she whispers,
you know,

697
00:40:46.361 --> 00:40:50.230
with that smile on those lips and she whispers in my ear,

698
00:40:50.231 --> 00:40:52.480
it's somebody would have probably thought she was kissing me.

699
00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:56.230
Listen was Maya says,
you know,
I heard what you said to Jimmy.
That was really,

700
00:40:56.231 --> 00:41:00.820
really cool.
And I look at our smile and that's usually when I go,
hey,

701
00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:05.500
I got a room upstairs.
I can get some liquor,
but you want to eat,
you want some?

702
00:41:05.501 --> 00:41:09.220
Uh,
what,
what are you want?
You know,
and I'd put my move.

703
00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:12.900
I didn't put that in a book.
They said,
well,
you didn't have sex with him.

704
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:16.840
Like the part,
the reason why I should have put that in my book is this,

705
00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.910
the freeze when I didn't say anything to her,

706
00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:23.320
which was not normal for me was I have fucking session the next day,

707
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:27.640
13 hours would Billy Corgan and Tony Iommi though.

708
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:32.530
And the point of this book is work came over everything.
Well,

709
00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:33.364
she had

710
00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.800
<v 0>turned down the potential of that.
Uh,
yeah,</v>

711
00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:39.020
you're definitely a workaholic who just wanted to send this.

712
00:41:39.021 --> 00:41:43.280
I'm hoping Cambodia is like come finds me someday while I'm giving him one of my

713
00:41:43.281 --> 00:41:46.770
speeches on stage and says I'm here to collect.
Yeah,

714
00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:52.250
we'll probably be wheelchairs and Bab colostomy bags and I'll be,
yeah,

715
00:41:52.251 --> 00:41:56.940
not so much now.
Hey you a name,
you were talking about working out.
Yeah.

716
00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.250
What about Diet and all that?

717
00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:02.360
I'd still in the book that came up was with the eight things.
First thing.

718
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:05.420
Number one,
lifting weights.
The reason why lifting weights,
it's important.

719
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:07.940
I just swore off it cause I fucked up my rotator cuff.

720
00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:10.940
So he's telling me there's lots of other types of weight lifting weight cause

721
00:42:10.941 --> 00:42:13.910
you can do the pink ones for the one ponders I can,

722
00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:18.920
I think I can handle those at this point.
300 reps.
Three reps.
Okay.

723
00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:21.590
300 reps at that.
Why restrict?
There's all kinds of things.

724
00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:24.460
<v 1>Bands where they go on the road to take it in my hotel,</v>

725
00:42:24.461 --> 00:42:26.650
I can do everything in my hotel room.
So anyway,

726
00:42:26.651 --> 00:42:30.190
I just lifting weights besides being strong.

727
00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:34.090
It keeps your hormone levels up.
And when your hormone levels up,

728
00:42:34.091 --> 00:42:37.630
you fighting the big three diseases,
cancer,
diabetes and heart disease.

729
00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:39.183
It's proven.

730
00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:44.520
So our hormone levels go down real quick before you're definitely near 20 shit

731
00:42:45.921 --> 00:42:50.410
starts changing.
Testosterone levels start going down after 18 or 17 or so.
It,

732
00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.660
it's crazy.
But anyway,
it keeps your hormone levels up,

733
00:42:52.661 --> 00:42:57.240
which makes you younger to everything about it makes you youthful.
Alright,

734
00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:01.270
so lifting weights does that.
It also,
the more muscle mass you build,

735
00:43:01.271 --> 00:43:05.470
the more it chews on fat.
Eat your fat.
Uh,
okay,

736
00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.670
so you know,
and I know how to carve my body.
I know that,
you know,
you do,

737
00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.590
you know,
bench press for your chest.
You Do,
you know,
you do pull,
you know,

738
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:19.230
pull downs to get to create that v you do,
uh,
you know,
uh,
you know,

739
00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.600
I do bench also to build your chest flied.
You flies in bench.

740
00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:24.310
I know how to carve my body.

741
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:27.510
<v 0>All right.
The second thing is a cardiac surgeon.
Jim,</v>

742
00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:30.300
do you have like that shit from like the eighties that old,

743
00:43:30.301 --> 00:43:35.301
was it the Weeder Gi Joe Wieder things and all of that out in this old thing,

744
00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:39.300
the gray on gray member,
the ground gray sweats.
I used to work in gyms like that.

745
00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:42.740
<v 1>Yeah,
there was old school gym with Olympians would work in those.</v>

746
00:43:42.741 --> 00:43:45.910
I called the iron pit.
Yeah.
No,
nothing pretty about it.

747
00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.840
These are guys that want to work out,
you know.

748
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:50.930
But I had a trainer for a long time so I did that for 14 years.

749
00:43:50.931 --> 00:43:55.580
So I learned how to do it right and I need to get a new one cause I'd need to
be,

750
00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.610
you know,
get the latest techniques,
you know,
it's all about technique.

751
00:43:58.611 --> 00:44:01.790
As you all know.
Rotator cuff,
you know,
people don't want,
you know,

752
00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.580
<v 0>I can help you with bad technique.
Yeah.
If you want to get hurt,
I can fucking,</v>

753
00:44:05.581 --> 00:44:09.060
I've been,
I went,
I've gone three injuries in a row and I think I'm fun.
You know,

754
00:44:09.061 --> 00:44:10.530
when you,
when you bench pressed,

755
00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:12.940
<v 1>did you or do you,</v>

756
00:44:12.941 --> 00:44:16.270
when you did any of the ways you used to probably raise your shoulders,
right.

757
00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:20.740
<v 0>My shoulders were already up.
Okay.
The thing about lifting weights,</v>

758
00:44:20.741 --> 00:44:24.200
as you say,
trauma,
I was in a protective posture

759
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.590
too much.
I had orange hair,
heroin.
I was growing up.
I mean,

760
00:44:29.591 --> 00:44:32.640
I was just God damn bull's eye by how you are both like,
yeah,

761
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:37.050
you know a fuck this white shit you might between brothers is shrink.

762
00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:40.960
You go see him,
he'll help you out.
I'm done talking to those fucking fee.

763
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:44.440
I know you always gonna have problems and then they always get to sit there and

764
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:48.270
then you start doing it to other people.
Oh,
you know what that is?

765
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:49.710
That's because when you were a kid,

766
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.800
ice cream fell off you fucking cone and then you just become this,

767
00:44:52.801 --> 00:44:54.540
this person trying to connect everything.

768
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:58.860
So I know I've just sort of accepted who I am.

769
00:44:58.861 --> 00:45:03.700
I try to work on being less of,
uh,
an angry asshole is what I'm,
I'm,

770
00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:08.530
I'm,
I'm trying to do,
uh,
I've gotten way better.
Um,
I failed.

771
00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:13.250
You're married,
right?
Yeah.
How's she dealing with it?
The angry asshole.

772
00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:17.880
Nah,
she's a,
uh,
angry asshole too.
Nah,
she's a saint man.

773
00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:20.940
I did.
Kids know if she ever just said,
look,

774
00:45:20.941 --> 00:45:23.160
I just can't fucking deal with you anymore.
I would,

775
00:45:23.161 --> 00:45:27.960
I would be hard probably back.
Get it.
I get it.
Yeah.
I get it,
you know?
But I mean,

776
00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:30.690
you know,
then there's the other part of me,
it's just like,
well,
you know,

777
00:45:30.691 --> 00:45:34.850
we're living nice here and I'm out here be fucking God damn every other weekend

778
00:45:34.851 --> 00:45:37.140
and I suck at Madigan.
You know,
I'm out here fucking Dayton,

779
00:45:37.141 --> 00:45:40.560
Ohio and when shit and Dick Jokes like,
hey,

780
00:45:40.561 --> 00:45:44.160
you're watching every episode of the office.
I think I just don't get like that.

781
00:45:44.161 --> 00:45:47.820
Which doesn't get you anywhere.
It feels good for a sec.
I gave up,

782
00:45:47.821 --> 00:45:52.290
I gave up arguing with my wife for lent and I said,
I'm just,

783
00:45:52.291 --> 00:45:55.560
I'm not going to just,
I'm not going to,
I'm finding the genius.

784
00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:59.370
I used to think those guys would just like,
like they,
they just quit.
We just,

785
00:45:59.371 --> 00:46:03.150
and it was those guys that's not worth it.
It's not worth it.
It's is actually,

786
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:08.010
there's the game within the game when you do that is because man,
that's heavy.

787
00:46:08.011 --> 00:46:10.560
If you can do that because your emotions are raging,

788
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:14.340
you brain isn't as powerful as your emotions.
Like their thing is,

789
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:16.710
is how they get you.
Okay.

790
00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:20.360
Oh well it's because they can physically beat the show.
Generally speaking,

791
00:46:20.361 --> 00:46:23.180
English at Dayton,
some UFC chick,
they can't beat the fuck out.

792
00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:26.530
So they have to go cerebral.
And what happens is,

793
00:46:26.531 --> 00:46:30.220
is you give up all your information when you're wrong,
and when you,
I mean,

794
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:34.200
when you're mad and then they collect that.
Oh yeah.
So the thing is,

795
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.340
is when you don't lose your shit anymore,
all of a sudden they're there.

796
00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:41.640
They're the inflammation trail that the court has been cut.

797
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:44.910
Now they don't know what the fuck you thinking.
And there's this like this,

798
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.630
all this shit.
I think I finally got some power back in this.
This is incredible.

799
00:46:48.631 --> 00:46:52.200
So the big thing is you recognize that.
Yeah.
That's the big thing.

800
00:46:52.201 --> 00:46:56.220
Because what I'm doing now,
it's like it's the execution that,
oh,

801
00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:00.540
don't say that.
Don't say anything.
Yeah.
You still get smart.
You Go,

802
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:04.660
you start to learn how to be tactical like them freaks him out.
Oh Dude.

803
00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:07.800
Because all of a sudden respect you though yet what they don't like.

804
00:47:07.801 --> 00:47:11.590
But then what they do is then what all you did was catch up to one of this

805
00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:14.670
skillset and then what happens is then,
you know,

806
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:19.050
they immediately started adjusting.
Nick,
it becomes a different that it's a tall,

807
00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:23.100
it's evolving through professional at what they do and we're just learning how

808
00:47:23.101 --> 00:47:26.700
to do it the better.
It's like getting the wing with Muhammad Ali.
I mean,

809
00:47:26.701 --> 00:47:29.580
you might get one punch in,
then it's lights out.
Yeah.

810
00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:33.430
<v 1>What do you want?
My big thing is now that is my experience.</v>

811
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:39.300
My big thing now is try this as I know there's that point where I can feel the

812
00:47:40.211 --> 00:47:44.950
fucking testosterone blowing in through me and my muscles swelling and she's had

813
00:47:44.951 --> 00:47:49.480
a couple glasses of wine.
She's like completely out of control and I'm perfect.

814
00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:54.330
And she uh,
I just go this at one moment I just go,

815
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:57.970
she,
I shut the computer or the book or what am I'm doing?
I said,
see Ya.

816
00:47:57.971 --> 00:48:02.620
And I leave.
I get,
I pull myself out of the room.
Oh,
you can walk.
Oh,

817
00:48:02.621 --> 00:48:06.250
I got to walk.
Because if I don't,
I've always wanted to do the walk.
I've never,

818
00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:10.450
I've never been able to do.
Just say,
you know what?
I'll see it.

819
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:14.470
I'm going or just leave.
So I'm done.
That's what I say.
I'm done.
I'm done.

820
00:48:14.471 --> 00:48:19.120
I leave because if I don't,
I got to do the clap.
The clap.
I'm done.

821
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.840
I'm done.
Seen that at least.

822
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.610
But that's good for both of us because what happens if,

823
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.860
see I'll be up all night stewing about it,
not her.

824
00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:35.240
She goes to sleep,
wakes up.
Oh,

825
00:48:35.241 --> 00:48:39.160
and that's why I hate honey and I'm like still raging.

826
00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:41.530
I can't get past that.
I just,

827
00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:46.630
I wish I could just start going in Jesus Christ.
Oh fuck.

828
00:48:46.631 --> 00:48:48.280
What am I doing here?
What?
This

829
00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.340
<v 0>talk to myself.
I will.</v>

830
00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:54.350
I walked down the street one time and I didn't even give a shit who heard me?

831
00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.560
And I know there was people looking at me.
I didn't care.
I was just like,

832
00:48:57.590 --> 00:49:01.400
just practicing.
It was just like,
I will never do this again.
Yeah.
Okay.

833
00:49:01.401 --> 00:49:03.440
I understand people getting married the first time,

834
00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:06.560
you didn't know what you were getting into,
but people who get the second time,

835
00:49:06.561 --> 00:49:10.010
it's like you,
you got three.
Oh my God,
check this.
Hey,

836
00:49:10.011 --> 00:49:13.100
I'm fucking one and done.
If this shit doesn't work,

837
00:49:13.101 --> 00:49:16.040
I'm not saying we're in a bad place,
but if,
if she ever just said,
fuck this,

838
00:49:16.041 --> 00:49:20.600
I'm out.
I would totally get it and I would just,
I would give her everything.

839
00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:24.620
Yeah.
And I would,
I would have somebody build me this,
the eye.
The drum room.
No,

840
00:49:24.621 --> 00:49:26.810
the dream divorce.
See House for a guy,

841
00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:31.010
which is just a garage with the fucking room above it.
Yeah.
It's a big studio.

842
00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.460
My on an electronic drum kits.
I don't piss anybody off.

843
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:36.590
I'll have all the fucking sports packages,

844
00:49:36.591 --> 00:49:40.100
little keg rate of slowly drink myself to death and a nice car.
Nice.

845
00:49:40.101 --> 00:49:44.120
It's my old fucking 68 f 100 and you,
you want it every fucking thing else.

846
00:49:44.121 --> 00:49:45.400
Take it.
I don't give a shit.

847
00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:50.810
<v 1>Well,
you know what?
I feel the same way if I don't,
if I don't,
if,
if,</v>

848
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:55.320
if you know,
my wife,
she's 21 years younger,
she's hot as hell.
Gina,

849
00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:58.050
if she left me,
I just say,

850
00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:01.590
I tell you have to worry about me cheating on you because if you leave me,

851
00:50:01.591 --> 00:50:06.120
I'm done.
Oh,
never fucking live with another woman again.
And you know,

852
00:50:06.121 --> 00:50:09.090
and rightfully so.
A strike three you're out.
I mean I'd be like,
no,

853
00:50:09.091 --> 00:50:13.350
I'm not saying that the date and do what guys do,
but I would live alone.

854
00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:16.980
You don't deserve to live with anybody.
It's,
you know,
I'll take half the blame.

855
00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:21.240
I don't,
I'm not,
I'm not,
I'm not good enough.
I'm not equipped for this next life.

856
00:50:21.241 --> 00:50:24.900
I'll do it right now.
Cause you know,
my career has always been first.
I mean,

857
00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:28.850
is that when it messed up most everything always been,
it's always been,

858
00:50:28.851 --> 00:50:33.140
my career has been first and we can attach that to all kinds of 40 and shit.

859
00:50:33.141 --> 00:50:35.540
I don't give a fuck.
Career's always been first.

860
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:40.840
And that's what got me where I am and now I'm,
I'm,
I'm,

861
00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:44.620
<v 0>that's what I love about my wife is she gets that because uh,</v>

862
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:48.530
I've seen other guys deal with that where it's just like they get with somebody

863
00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:52.160
and they love the lifestyle of what you do,

864
00:50:52.161 --> 00:50:55.690
but then they want that nine to five guy who's going to be like,
Hey,

865
00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:59.360
I'm home every night.
He the one state after a while they just get tired of that.

866
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:04.700
And then that's what fucking makes me paranoid about women is because then they

867
00:51:04.701 --> 00:51:05.181
leave you,

868
00:51:05.181 --> 00:51:09.770
but they take the lifestyle with them and you're the guy that earned it and now

869
00:51:09.771 --> 00:51:12.920
you have to continue going out doing what the fuck it is you do while you give

870
00:51:12.921 --> 00:51:16.310
all the lifestyle money to them and then they meet this other fucking nine to

871
00:51:16.311 --> 00:51:20.330
five asshole and they get to live this rockstar shit and,
and you know,

872
00:51:20.331 --> 00:51:24.350
cake and eat it.
Yeah.
Kate Gideon.
That's the reality.
That's,
that's a definite,

873
00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.870
that is a definite reality is that you bring that up.

874
00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:30.630
It's considered like a misogynistic and all that type of shit though too,

875
00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:32.060
which is,
that's the thing,

876
00:51:32.061 --> 00:51:34.860
that's that all of this me too shit that's going on right now where they're,

877
00:51:34.861 --> 00:51:38.450
they're examining the male female dynamic,
which obviously needs to be done.

878
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:41.410
It's obviously a good thing to,
to,
to,
I mean,
I,

879
00:51:41.411 --> 00:51:44.540
I had no idea all this fucking shit was going on,
so that's all good.

880
00:51:44.541 --> 00:51:46.730
But what I love about this,

881
00:51:46.731 --> 00:51:49.240
it's like we're gonna examine the male female dynamic,
but it's,

882
00:51:49.241 --> 00:51:52.640
it's only going to critique what guys do when the relationship.

883
00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:55.310
So at that point you kind of suggested that women are like,

884
00:51:55.311 --> 00:51:59.660
these completed works and meanwhile they're fucking killing us.

885
00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:04.010
Every guy dies before their wife.
They always outlive us.
They blame us.
Say,

886
00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:07.850
you know,
go to the fucking doctor.
You know,
I'm going to the doctor,
I'm going,

887
00:52:07.851 --> 00:52:10.080
I'm getting everything fucking checked out.
I'm going to just,

888
00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:12.440
just to fucking prove them wrong.
My wife is still going to kill me.

889
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:16.390
I swear to God she has.
I have all my shots.

890
00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:20.180
<v 1>I tell everyone I'm going to live long and all you fuckers,
I got that old man,</v>

891
00:52:20.181 --> 00:52:22.220
she's got to do that.
I'm going to fucking live.
I'm just,

892
00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:26.800
I'll be hanging on stubbornness.
Hang on.
You know.
Hey you,
you know,

893
00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.960
I'll be paralyzed on one side.
I mean,

894
00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.870
you can tell me communicate and three a little bell like that dude and breaking

895
00:52:32.871 --> 00:52:37.220
bad.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I know.
It's pretty crazy.
I mean,
you know,

896
00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:39.290
it's just typical of anything like this.

897
00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.760
It swings way over to the other side and it,
and there's definitely some,

898
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.760
definitely some issues and things to be addressed.
I mean,

899
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:51.350
without mentioning names,
bad behavior is bad behavior.

900
00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:55.420
I agree.
Bad behavior is bad behavior,
but this,

901
00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:59.390
it's gets to the point where then you've got so many gray areas and so many

902
00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.740
things to consider that aren't just what's going on in the news,

903
00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:07.750
that it's not just,
there's something else going on in,
in,
in,

904
00:53:07.751 --> 00:53:11.840
and they're trying to like just put it all into one little cubicle.

905
00:53:11.841 --> 00:53:14.120
I'm gonna get my ass kicked for this.
But you know,

906
00:53:14.121 --> 00:53:16.580
it's not a one year to get in trouble here.
I don't want you,

907
00:53:16.581 --> 00:53:20.070
I don't want you to go,
no,
you're not.
You're not getting me in trouble.
What

908
00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:21.750
<v 0>do you think,
uh,
music today?</v>

909
00:53:21.751 --> 00:53:24.290
What are some of the bands like everyone's always tracking on my God,

910
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.000
what happened to and blah,
blah,
blah.
[inaudible] what do you,
what do you,

911
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:30.600
are you liking music this day?
Is,
does take this,
I take mediocrities in.

912
00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:33.650
And what do you do you think part of that was because all,

913
00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:37.440
all the studios they used to have like the fucking guy you wanted to produce

914
00:53:37.441 --> 00:53:40.650
your record and now it's like,
it's just fucking people at home.

915
00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:43.040
<v 1>No,
it's real simple.
Well,
you're right.
But the reason,</v>

916
00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:48.140
the reason behind all the change or one of the big reasons behind the change,
uh,

917
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:52.580
is that,
uh,
you don't buy cds.
There's no income coming in.

918
00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:57.640
I'm on three cds that sold 40 million a piece to Celine Dion records in a

919
00:53:58.641 --> 00:54:02.690
meatloaf bad on a hill too.
He's sold over 40 million,
not including downloads.

920
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:07.490
Think about now,
if the artist is making 18 cents on the dollar,

921
00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:11.630
that's 82 cents.
The labeled times 40 Mil,
that's going to pay some bills.

922
00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:15.500
The business model was it allows with Mellencamp.
They,

923
00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:20.420
if you could spend,
we could spend a year making a record,
you know,

924
00:54:20.421 --> 00:54:22.010
cause we were doing an Indiana,
which is cheaper,

925
00:54:22.011 --> 00:54:23.570
but actually we did it and other places,

926
00:54:23.571 --> 00:54:25.730
but we could spend a year working on a record.

927
00:54:25.850 --> 00:54:29.960
If we made a record and music suck,
you throw it away and start again.
And also,

928
00:54:29.961 --> 00:54:32.420
by the way,
back then,
if you didn't have a good course,

929
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:35.990
a good hook line to a unique sound,
unique,
this unique,

930
00:54:35.991 --> 00:54:39.470
that unique that you wouldn't even get played on the radio because everybody

931
00:54:39.471 --> 00:54:40.304
else was doing that.

932
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:43.850
You will competing against the greatest records that have come out in a long

933
00:54:43.851 --> 00:54:47.120
time.
Right?
And so,
but there was money.
That's my point.

934
00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:49.460
And when the record came out,
it was $1 million.

935
00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:53.570
You could invest if they want it to $1 million to get that record played on the

936
00:54:53.571 --> 00:54:54.830
radio cost,
the United States.

937
00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:58.820
Not to mention the marketing plan for the Europe and in Asia and England and

938
00:54:58.821 --> 00:55:02.210
Australia.
Then when you went on tour,
there was tour support.

939
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:07.690
There was money to invest in a band to build a career and the way it is,

940
00:55:08.661 --> 00:55:12.140
nothing more powerful than a bunch of guys working together.
Let's see.

941
00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:15.340
Beatles stones,
you to,
you know,
um,

942
00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:19.140
the who of these bands?

943
00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:22.490
It's the hope led Zeppelin.
I mean,

944
00:55:22.491 --> 00:55:26.720
these bands work together.
Didn't even matter if they got along.

945
00:55:26.721 --> 00:55:31.721
The point is all the talent in one room created this incredible team that

946
00:55:32.391 --> 00:55:34.910
created incredible epic product.

947
00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:37.640
One guy can't do what for guys.

948
00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:41.570
That's like Michael Jordan was the most dangerous basketball player in the
world.

949
00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:44.570
Why?
He figured it out.
It wasn't about him.

950
00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:47.850
It was about the team and that's what scared the other people.

951
00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:51.100
<v 0>Yeah.
That's not a coach of the piston saying that one year when Mike showed up,</v>

952
00:55:51.101 --> 00:55:52.270
the first game they played them,

953
00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:56.440
they collapsed the d on Him and he passed the ball and he went,
oh shit.

954
00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:59.140
Of course he's still dominated and took over the game.

955
00:55:59.141 --> 00:56:00.820
But once he started doing that,

956
00:56:00.821 --> 00:56:03.160
he added that whole dynamic to his game and it was over.

957
00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:04.920
<v 1>The point is you look at him,</v>

958
00:56:04.921 --> 00:56:08.040
you know he's going to do the right thing for the team.

959
00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:12.690
That's scary man.
Because I mean he's,
he's a coach and a player.

960
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:16.750
So I mean the teams are greater than individual.

961
00:56:16.751 --> 00:56:20.310
One guy thinks that he can do as much as five.
That's crazy.

962
00:56:20.311 --> 00:56:23.800
But because of the budgets,
we've been forced into those cubicles,

963
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.830
we've been forced to.
People have to,
there is no budget.

964
00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:29.960
I have a studio right up the road there and people come over and they,
and they,

965
00:56:29.961 --> 00:56:32.050
they,
they want me to record drums,
have an engineer.

966
00:56:32.051 --> 00:56:35.560
I was a control room in a dorm moon and I've done like Sammy Hagar,

967
00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:37.480
Billy Gibbons,
Steve Lucas or all kinds of,

968
00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:41.050
but most of the work I get is people sending me files from all over the world

969
00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:44.320
when they save up their little money and they have,
you know,

970
00:56:44.321 --> 00:56:48.550
44 decades of experience and my style,
literally write a song and be like,

971
00:56:48.551 --> 00:56:51.460
I want to get Kenny Aaron.
Oh yeah,
I send you a little bit of Zip,

972
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:55.630
whatever the fuck they called,
zip five of them.
RECIPROC,
reciprocator,

973
00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:59.740
whatever the fuck they call,
they send you that.
I load it into my pro tools.

974
00:56:59.741 --> 00:57:04.630
So I asked this,
I asked for the click they used on the session because man,

975
00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:06.910
the times I haven't gotten a click,
it's a disaster.

976
00:57:06.911 --> 00:57:10.630
If they didn't play to a click track.
Oh for fuck.

977
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.400
And it takes me longer.
So because of the budget I want,

978
00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:18.430
I would love to see you and your drum room.
Jesus fucking Christ,

979
00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:22.360
you slow it down again.
Something like that.
Wow.

980
00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:25.900
I get to click,
I want the click.
They used the session,

981
00:57:25.901 --> 00:57:29.320
I put that into pro tools on one track and I can control the volume.

982
00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:33.970
Then I sell him to send me the demo with the drum sequences,

983
00:57:33.971 --> 00:57:36.670
stuff that they use because nine out of 10 times,

984
00:57:36.671 --> 00:57:37.630
that's what they're in love with.

985
00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:41.950
Then send me the song without the drums because that's what I'm going to play
do.

986
00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:45.250
I'm gonna play the song without the drum sequence and the click.

987
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:49.150
Do you do you before?
Uh,
you know,

988
00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:52.930
you play what they already put down.
Oh yeah.
Do you play what you would play?

989
00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:56.020
They don't have their shit in your head.
No.
I play,

990
00:57:56.590 --> 00:57:59.500
first I do is I play exactly what they program.

991
00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:02.860
Then I started making adjustments like instead of open high and I might go to

992
00:58:02.861 --> 00:58:06.940
the crash cymbal or go to the ride cymbal or the first take,

993
00:58:06.941 --> 00:58:10.450
I give them three tanks.
First take is pretty much what they had,

994
00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.190
but it's with my feel.

995
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:17.200
And then I started doing more fills that are me.
Uh,

996
00:58:17.201 --> 00:58:19.840
I do different things and I'm thinking they could pick from this.

997
00:58:19.841 --> 00:58:24.220
And the third take I go even further.
And that's,
that's,
that's my really,

998
00:58:24.221 --> 00:58:28.180
my definition of creativity is to start with the foundation and then build off

999
00:58:28.181 --> 00:58:33.010
of that.
And,
um,
sometimes I'll give four takes if I think you know what.
And um,

1000
00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:37.120
and then I send it back to them and they typically go for take two,

1001
00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:41.800
three is I've gone too far or they might grab like he was doing the song for

1002
00:58:41.801 --> 00:58:44.890
Sammy Hagar and I said,
you know,
I really think the song,

1003
00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:48.820
he just sent me a guitar and vocal and a click,
he can still sing.

1004
00:58:48.821 --> 00:58:53.770
It sounds ridiculous and just easy.
Just put it here in ridiculous.

1005
00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.770
He said one of them,
let me know next time you guys are playing.
Oh Dude.

1006
00:58:56.771 --> 00:59:00.880
This was like,
I was playing with him,
the guys from Stone Temple pilots,
uh,

1007
00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:04.600
some guys from the cult,
some guys Foma,
Matt Sorum and I were playing together.

1008
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:11.140
Steve Stevens,
I mean somebody from the stones.
It was great.

1009
00:59:11.170 --> 00:59:15.490
It was a music thing to get kids,
uh,
you know,

1010
00:59:15.491 --> 00:59:16.570
instruments in schools.

1011
00:59:16.571 --> 00:59:19.780
But I thought you were describing when all you guys are doing it was a music

1012
00:59:19.781 --> 00:59:21.890
thing.
Oh yeah.
I didn't think you guys are playing basketball

1013
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:26.570
<v 0>too.
I had to clarify that.
Yeah.
So anyways,
so I got it.</v>

1014
00:59:26.571 --> 00:59:30.230
That was really interesting.
So they usually end up taking like take two,

1015
00:59:30.231 --> 00:59:33.250
which makes sense because they're not dramas and then you,
you,

1016
00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:34.610
but they know what they want.

1017
00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:36.300
<v 1>And then you should see,
I gotta show you what my,</v>

1018
00:59:36.301 --> 00:59:40.380
what my charts and those anal chart writer in the planet.
Uh,

1019
00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.060
this is his cause.
I'm,

1020
00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:44.310
<v 0>hey,
why you look for that?</v>

1021
00:59:44.311 --> 00:59:48.590
And I want to ask a question then I drum for the longest fucking time.

1022
00:59:48.591 --> 00:59:50.580
I've always wanted to ask a drama with your setup.

1023
00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:54.050
I don't know if you still do this.
Do you versed?
Yeah.
Why do you,

1024
00:59:54.051 --> 00:59:57.560
for people at home listening,
he would have like what have you,
12,

1025
00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:59.120
12 inch to 10 inch,

1026
00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:03.110
10 inch going and you are right handed drummer going left to right.
Wow.

1027
01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:06.730
<v 1>Minutes takes me to it and then they'll read it and make it sound like I'm not</v>

1028
01:00:06.731 --> 01:00:09.310
reading.
Make it feel like I'm not reading.

1029
01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:12.940
<v 0>That's you're looking at as Trump shot.
Oh,
that is so fucking cool.</v>

1030
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.980
It's like Chinese.
Yeah.
So,
so how do you usually,

1031
01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:22.430
for people who don't play drums listening to this,
you go,
hello.
Low Height alone.

1032
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:28.090
So you eight 10 12 1416 going down and you go like 21016181618

1033
01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:32.000
<v 1>what happened was I got Mellencamp band and I,
I,</v>

1034
01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:36.480
when I auditioned I showed up with a car with leaky oil and I had this big ass,

1035
01:00:36.481 --> 01:00:41.220
you know Neil Peart from rush to I'm set.
John looks at me,
looks at the car,

1036
01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:43.350
it looks at the drums,
shakes my hand.

1037
01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:47.310
John Mellencamp turns around and walks the other direction like,
wow,

1038
01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.770
he will not happy.
I didn't look cool.

1039
01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:55.120
The car's leaking on his driveway and I got a drum set that's like not cool.

1040
01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:59.010
He says,
this guy's not going work out.
I crushed it though.
I just beat the shit,

1041
01:00:59.011 --> 01:01:03.820
broke everything.
He was this close to me.
His mouth was open like Holy Shit,
who?

1042
01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:08.330
This guy is into it.
Anyway,
I get in the band but immediately said,
ah,

1043
01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:13.240
<v 0>another time when someone is just looking at you like,
no,
and you just,
yeah,
go,</v>

1044
01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:14.093
went over the top.

1045
01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:15.330
<v 1>Well if you did that book,</v>

1046
01:01:15.331 --> 01:01:19.290
you'll see where he cut me from the first record five weeks later and you told

1047
01:01:19.291 --> 01:01:22.860
him to go home.
I said,
no,
I ain't going home.
I'm not fucking going home.

1048
01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:26.760
It's no way I was going to be mortified.
I'd rather go to Mars.

1049
01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.040
There's no way we're going because I didn't have enough.

1050
01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.830
I didn't know how to serve a song.
You know what?

1051
01:01:31.831 --> 01:01:35.150
I'd tell a drummer and we'll get back to the tenants.
Dom.
I say,

1052
01:01:35.151 --> 01:01:37.380
do you know what the purpose of a drone was when you're making a record?

1053
01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.980
Nobody ever gets it.
They're going to get it now cause I've said it enough,

1054
01:01:40.981 --> 01:01:44.370
but the go beat time.
I says,
no,

1055
01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:46.950
get the fucking song on the radio to be number one.

1056
01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.380
That's your job because when you do that,

1057
01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:51.600
you just made the company millions of dollars.

1058
01:01:51.810 --> 01:01:55.950
You just made the record label or you made the artist or the band millions of

1059
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:58.610
dollars.
If Microsoft hired us,
they don't give a fuck about us.

1060
01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.860
They just want us to make money and they smile.
And when we make money for them,

1061
01:02:01.861 --> 01:02:04.290
they give us some money.
We take care of our family.
It's that simple.

1062
01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:06.510
And then nobody ever tells you that shit.

1063
01:02:06.511 --> 01:02:10.380
But that's why I didn't get on the first record.
I played with Leonard Bernstein.

1064
01:02:10.381 --> 01:02:12.840
I was at Tanglewood,
I got the juice and symphony orchestra.

1065
01:02:13.110 --> 01:02:16.020
What the fuck does that have to do with getting a song on the radio to be number

1066
01:02:16.021 --> 01:02:17.010
one?
I didn't know.

1067
01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:20.990
I was looking through a telescope and that is looking through a microscope where

1068
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.110
you so different direction,
isn't it?
And I didn't understand that.

1069
01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:30.090
And I eventually did obviously,
but I,
when I'm a fighter fight guy,

1070
01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:33.180
I didn't know that.
So I wrote this book.
I thought it was just this nice,

1071
01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.170
I can't wait to read this.
I can't wait to go left.

1072
01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:42.820
So John said he'd like Charlie was,
he wanted the Charlie watts one rack.

1073
01:02:42.821 --> 01:02:47.130
Tom One floor tone,
one ride cymbal when crashing a Hyatt.
That's it.

1074
01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:50.520
So that was really tough cause you know drummers are really particular about

1075
01:02:50.521 --> 01:02:55.170
their setups.
I went,
all right,
that's really pissed about that.
But okay.
I did it.

1076
01:02:55.530 --> 01:02:59.820
And um,
and then we went on tour.

1077
01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.340
Uh,
let's see,

1078
01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:06.510
maybe I did the first tour with one retcon but then Jack and Diane,

1079
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:10.290
which was the next record,
which I vowed I'd be on the next record,
which I was,

1080
01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:14.330
because it has that big drum solo boom,
black students do better with Jews.

1081
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:19.110
Did you do to do to do better to boob and it was four times so iconic to hear

1082
01:03:19.111 --> 01:03:19.944
you sing.

1083
01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:26.760
So I'm playing or maybe this is what happened before Jack.

1084
01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:31.590
And then I had a 12 inch direct come,
a 16 inch floor,

1085
01:03:31.591 --> 01:03:35.690
Tom and an 18 didn't even have hardware on the bottom.
I just didn't have,

1086
01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.730
I didn't even have a deal yet,
didn't even hardware.

1087
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:42.300
And I had the Evan's hydraulic heads.
You remember those fat,

1088
01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.540
the kids didn't have the oil in the middle of the,

1089
01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:49.980
and this was like,
and so the engineer comes up to me and we're playing,

1090
01:03:49.981 --> 01:03:53.970
woven up to 18 is like a concert time.
Like there's no bottom head.
No problem.

1091
01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:58.500
Hey Buddy,
we're opening up for the kinks.

1092
01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.030
So we planned a big venues and the engineer comes up to me,
he goes,
Kenny,

1093
01:04:03.031 --> 01:04:07.950
you Thomas,
I can't get enough definition out of those drums.
Um,

1094
01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:11.820
do you kind of smaller Tom.
And I went,
well I do,
but John doesn't want it.

1095
01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:15.650
And this is when I had this direct come on,
a snare stand.
I didn't mount it,

1096
01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:19.980
I didn't want it was old school.
So,
uh,
I said,
well,

1097
01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:23.220
I got a smaller town but John's not going to like it.
And then I went,
hey,

1098
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:27.060
tell John his vocal will sound way better if I have that 10 inch time up there.

1099
01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:30.780
I was just joking and I dunno if he told them that,

1100
01:04:30.781 --> 01:04:34.710
but the bottom line is he says,
put the other Tom up.
So,

1101
01:04:34.711 --> 01:04:37.720
but I didn't have a hold of foresight to put on a snare stands.

1102
01:04:37.721 --> 01:04:40.690
So I've got a 24 inch.
She kicked her on Mondays.

1103
01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:44.370
Tom's or like you could drive a freight train through it,
but why?

1104
01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:45.870
Why wouldn't you just put the 10?

1105
01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:50.900
Because at this point I realized the value and the perfection of snare 1216 is

1106
01:04:54.691 --> 01:04:58.890
the sound like a jazz drummer and now you go back to they weren't dummies.

1107
01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:02.730
They were all into like not what looks good,
but what sounds good.

1108
01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:06.540
Putting a 10 inch right there with a 12 inch.
I wasn't gonna go for it.

1109
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:11.220
I wouldn't know how you go 10 I guess I could have put the high hat outs farther

1110
01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:15.390
and then squeezed the 10 inch even far left and leave the 12 word is,

1111
01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:17.200
but I decided to reverse it.
Yeah,

1112
01:05:17.970 --> 01:05:19.260
<v 0>probably avoided hip problems too.</v>

1113
01:05:19.261 --> 01:05:22.950
Cause then you like just being just another two inches after 40 years all of a

1114
01:05:22.951 --> 01:05:24.090
sudden as fuck.

1115
01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.830
<v 1>Well yeah.
So yeah,
that became my thing.</v>

1116
01:05:26.831 --> 01:05:31.831
And then think about if you put your hand out 10 then lefthand 12 right hand 16

1117
01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:37.630
dude does that.
But I'm sure that some of the fields I did was so out there.

1118
01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:42.700
Some guy in Japan was trying to try to analyze the shit gone.
How do you do that?

1119
01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:45.930
<v 0>You right.
You try to figure out the sticking.
Yeah.
I hate that.</v>

1120
01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:49.320
I hate when that happens.
Then you'll have like,
like all the,
you know,
the whole,

1121
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:52.920
the bottom,
the kick right left and they went kick left,
right.

1122
01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.510
Everybody in England would kick left.
Right.

1123
01:05:54.511 --> 01:05:57.470
So it had that descending sound that way.
I do it like Barnum.

1124
01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:01.510
<v 1>I'd go left hand on the Rackham went to go get,
get to get the together.</v>

1125
01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:05.740
I go left hand,
right hand,
left foot.
That's what bonded.
And you know that,
that,

1126
01:06:05.741 --> 01:06:10.400
that fill that he does in a um,
uh,
black black dog goes,

1127
01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:16.040
<v 2>uh,
uh,</v>

1128
01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:21.360
<v 1>that's cause he leads with his left hand so he can go left to the rack.</v>

1129
01:06:21.591 --> 01:06:22.810
Tom Left,

1130
01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:28.050
which is debt to get to that [inaudible] that snare Tom Snare foot,

1131
01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:32.890
but then he can move his snare foot.
Yeah,
I think it's like no fucking

1132
01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:40.900
snare.
Snare Tom.
So

1133
01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:48.700
he doesn't like that because he's so talented.
He just thought,

1134
01:06:48.701 --> 01:06:53.701
well why crossover my hands and why he just made his hands do what?

1135
01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:58.520
Execute a thing to get the sound he wanted.
So want to go duck,
duck,
duck,

1136
01:06:58.530 --> 01:06:59.363
go to God.

1137
01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:04.770
So he do lefthanded that good dude that as opposed to most people go to the drug

1138
01:07:05.861 --> 01:07:08.950
so they don't want to,
that's one of the leading with the right hand,

1139
01:07:08.951 --> 01:07:13.330
the right hand and second of all it's easier.
So,

1140
01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:16.340
but not bottom.
No,
no.
He says duck.
Duck.

1141
01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:19.360
<v 0>Why did you ever see those guys live far?</v>

1142
01:07:19.530 --> 01:07:22.700
I saw lots of first time you haven't been sitting up straight.

1143
01:07:23.030 --> 01:07:26.210
You just [inaudible] I know.
I saw a dude,
that guy,

1144
01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:28.230
<v 1>I mean to me</v>

1145
01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:32.450
<v 0>do you have it's like death Royal Albert Hall that just the way that that</v>

1146
01:07:32.451 --> 01:07:36.050
concert looks.
So you don't have that DVD that released about 15 years ago.
Um,

1147
01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:39.950
and his drum sound,
it's just,
I,
you know what's funny about that guy,

1148
01:07:39.951 --> 01:07:42.650
I was talking to a song about this,
there's like this whole like,

1149
01:07:43.310 --> 01:07:47.380
I think it's a myth that he played like these to be giant tree trunk stick.

1150
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:49.130
It'd be looking at is things like he's playing like a five.

1151
01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:53.030
<v 1>May I ask you something?
Do you remember what heads he's using in that?
That,
that,</v>

1152
01:07:53.031 --> 01:07:56.240
that,
that,
is that how the West was won?
That thing that does,

1153
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:57.740
that all came up back then.
Okay.

1154
01:07:57.741 --> 01:08:02.180
Do you know what to him has he had on the Royal Albert Hall any of that time?

1155
01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.930
<v 0>Well,
he,
you still have the black dot.
Like Tony.
Okay.
That's what he did have.</v>

1156
01:08:05.931 --> 01:08:08.190
That southern remains the same he had though

1157
01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:12.710
<v 1>on the,
well and the how the West is one coated ambassador.</v>

1158
01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:17.180
Not only did he have coated ambassador,
he had on his,
kicked him too dude.

1159
01:08:17.181 --> 01:08:19.250
I'd blow through that shit and like three songs,

1160
01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:24.020
coating ambassador and he had um oh and the snare drum.

1161
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:26.840
You remember when you were a little kid,
you play snare to them and get,

1162
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:29.060
you don't change the head cause you don't play that hard.

1163
01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:33.600
You had to stare at them and it turns black and then the inside of that black

1164
01:08:33.601 --> 01:08:36.350
gets beat out.
Clear and you could see through the,
that means you,

1165
01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:39.350
that drum heads been on there for 80 years.

1166
01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:45.100
He had snared them live with that look on that.

1167
01:08:46.601 --> 01:08:49.030
Started studying his muscles and his,

1168
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:52.310
the way he wasn't hitting that hard hit an incredible foot.

1169
01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:56.690
But he wasn't hitting that hard because you cannot play a coated ambassador

1170
01:08:56.691 --> 01:09:01.691
heads and and make it and have it last in a live show like they were doing.

1171
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:05.600
He couldn't hit him that hard.
It's hair was flying around.

1172
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:09.140
It looked like he was just a beast and he's big,

1173
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:12.860
but I wasn't his muscles and his everyday way he moves.

1174
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.010
It's all wrists and fingers.
I played for my belly button.

1175
01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:21.040
I'm like martial arts player started off with mallets when Stub Marimba you had

1176
01:09:21.231 --> 01:09:26.231
to lift with your risk because to get the yarn off of the wooden bar.

1177
01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.940
So I developed this technique,
Timpani,

1178
01:09:28.941 --> 01:09:32.360
I use fingers to get the stick to just bounce off the Timpani,

1179
01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:36.260
use your fingers and then we're still going to do both because when you do

1180
01:09:36.261 --> 01:09:40.280
double stroke low,
you go wrist down and then fingers to get the rebound.

1181
01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.890
And then when I started playing rock and roll,

1182
01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:48.160
I started to use that wrist thing and I started to go into my forearm,

1183
01:09:48.321 --> 01:09:51.890
then into my upper arm and then I started going with my back and I start to

1184
01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:56.210
realize,
well shit,
I'm going to do the Bruce Lee thing.
Start playing from my gut.

1185
01:09:56.810 --> 01:09:58.610
And you know,

1186
01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:03.350
<v 0>that's how just what little I know obviously I just think he just knew Bonham</v>

1187
01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:04.630
just knew how to hit a drum.

1188
01:10:04.631 --> 01:10:07.750
You know how to hit it and get the fuck out of the way of it and let it.
Yup.

1189
01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:11.190
Cause I remember what my generation coming up in the 80s all like all his

1190
01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.080
teenager.
We would,
that's,
that was the thing when people just,
you know,

1191
01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:18.520
you'd hit the bass drum and leave the beat on it and you try to like just,

1192
01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:22.480
just bash because his sound was so big.
It was also too,

1193
01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:24.580
I mean there was production value to it and everything.

1194
01:10:24.581 --> 01:10:28.210
So we were sitting there trying to find a 26 inch base to him,
you know,

1195
01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:33.420
trying to get that sound.
Yeah.
You had to hit hard.

1196
01:10:33.421 --> 01:10:36.100
And number of buying these big stupid like the marching band,

1197
01:10:36.101 --> 01:10:39.430
Styx thinking and had just sounded like absolute shit.

1198
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:42.910
I would just sound like I was hitting a wet piece of notebook paper when I would

1199
01:10:42.911 --> 01:10:44.320
hit it and it just would never work.
But

1200
01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:48.140
<v 1>it was it.
That's the whole point of this thing is that,
look,</v>

1201
01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:50.450
what you hear is,

1202
01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:55.460
isn't what you doesn't add up to what you actually do to get that sound.

1203
01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.480
There's so many variables.
Let me ask you a few more before,
before we

1204
01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.530
<v 0>gotta wrap this up,</v>

1205
01:11:00.531 --> 01:11:04.430
because I could literally talk to you about who's a most underrated drummer.

1206
01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:09.120
<v 1>Oh,
there's a lot of underrated drummer.
Phil Rudd for ACDC.
Unbelievable.</v>

1207
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:14.160
Unbelievable.
It's what?
More like what?
He doesn't do a,
okay.

1208
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:14.791
I just saw,

1209
01:11:14.791 --> 01:11:19.340
I just did music cares in New York where don was a musical director.

1210
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:23.340
Producer hires me to do these big,
huge things while play with 20 artists,

1211
01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:27.120
all kinds of styles.
Meryl Haggard recently,

1212
01:11:27.121 --> 01:11:29.970
Greg Home and doctor John Fleetwood Mac.

1213
01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:33.360
That's my whole point for MusiCares and I watched Fleetwood Mac Rehearse at the,

1214
01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:37.020
we've done rehearsing.
I played with eight artists.
I want to watch them.

1215
01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:42.820
<v 0>Then Mick Fleetwood fucker,
he was another guy.</v>

1216
01:11:42.821 --> 01:11:46.520
He switched the Tom's right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then he had like,
he had to have that,

1217
01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:49.960
the extension on his high heck,
cause he was like ninth,
just like nine feet tall.

1218
01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.000
But the thing is is that

1219
01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.270
<v 1>these drummers were guys,</v>

1220
01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:56.300
I became the drummer I used to make fun of when I was in college.

1221
01:11:56.301 --> 01:11:59.310
Like fuck that Nigel also shit,

1222
01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:04.220
this Guy Charlie Watts,
you know,
even Ringo who I thought it was my idol.
He is.

1223
01:12:04.221 --> 01:12:06.830
My idol was,
but then I went on like,
you know me,

1224
01:12:06.831 --> 01:12:09.810
Billy come pretty much fucked up my career because I was trying to

1225
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:14.740
<v 0>play like him.
You know what I'm saying?
No,
that's a young guy.</v>

1226
01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:17.090
That's a young person's thought.
Like if I gotta go,

1227
01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:21.320
I gotta go play as many notes as I can and showing off and doing all that.

1228
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:22.980
I knocked,
obviously not trash.

1229
01:12:22.981 --> 01:12:26.240
And Billy Conn told Billy comments as humans fucked up my career in my book.

1230
01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:29.450
I said,
but you know,
and we're friends.
I,

1231
01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:33.410
there's no way I was ever going to be like Billy come and I learned a lot by

1232
01:12:33.411 --> 01:12:36.060
trying.
My point is,
is that,
um,

1233
01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:40.070
I had to learn to appreciate how brilliant a guy like Charlie watts who were

1234
01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:44.280
windows stars and Phil Rudd and uh,
Oh,

1235
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:45.320
there's a whole slew of them.

1236
01:12:45.321 --> 01:12:49.760
My favorite thing about Phil Rudd is when they're coming out of like the versus

1237
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:51.770
or something like that,
it's just always that point.
You,

1238
01:12:51.771 --> 01:12:54.920
you think that he's going to hit the crash and he goes,
I know was playing.

1239
01:12:55.330 --> 01:12:56.840
And then when he finally does,

1240
01:12:56.841 --> 01:13:00.650
he's just built up so much tension and then the song just like,

1241
01:13:00.651 --> 01:13:05.050
it just fucking takes off.
It took me,
I used to,
I used to.
Uh,

1242
01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:08.410
yeah.
I mean obviously I became a comedian so I made a lot of,

1243
01:13:09.230 --> 01:13:12.500
well you didn't make that mistake.
Uh,
no,
but I didn't learn.

1244
01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:16.730
I didn't learn that until,
uh,
you know,
I was probably a comedian for 15 years.

1245
01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:18.170
You know,

1246
01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:22.980
there's that initial thing we played ACDC cause you think it's easy and you

1247
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.910
think you're playing it but you're not playing the physically you're doing it.

1248
01:13:25.911 --> 01:13:30.230
And it took the longest times until I saw guys like Steve Jordan and even Steve

1249
01:13:30.230 --> 01:13:33.200
Gadd one time would just play the most simple beat and I just would watch those

1250
01:13:33.201 --> 01:13:37.670
guys.
An example right there being like I can physically play that,

1251
01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:42.620
but I could never even remotely make it sound.
It all comes from your head first.

1252
01:13:42.621 --> 01:13:43.490
You got to hear it.
Yeah.

1253
01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:46.120
<v 1>Somebody saw me doing,
I did another music cares.</v>

1254
01:13:46.121 --> 01:13:48.070
I was a honor and Dylan here in La,

1255
01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:52.990
some drummers I decided in between the rehearsal and the filming and recording,

1256
01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:56.290
it just shows by the way,
16 cameras shoot,
they're going to record it.

1257
01:13:56.291 --> 01:13:57.220
You can't fuck up.

1258
01:13:57.430 --> 01:14:00.750
And you just finished her harassing with three artists and how you got,

1259
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.170
that's why I write everything out,
you know?
So anyway,
this guy,
I decided,

1260
01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.460
I talked to the engineer and said,

1261
01:14:07.150 --> 01:14:09.340
I just feel like in this room my symbols with Blake,

1262
01:14:09.341 --> 01:14:12.960
I'm going to put up some case symbols.
Do you me?
So I'm playing the simple glue,

1263
01:14:12.961 --> 01:14:14.050
just laying it down,

1264
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:18.940
being doing what I do in some drummer for this other band is looking at me,

1265
01:14:18.941 --> 01:14:21.700
shaking his head.
Then he comes over and I said,

1266
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:25.480
it's something wrong with the symbols.
He goes,
no,

1267
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:30.310
how the fuck do you make those drum sound like that?
How do you get that sound?

1268
01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:31.810
You're not doing any fancy.

1269
01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:36.470
So he was telling me what I'm in awe of other drums like,
oh,
you know,

1270
01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:40.750
and I said,
you know,
how do I do that?

1271
01:14:40.751 --> 01:14:43.750
Says Cause I hear something,
I imagined something in my head,

1272
01:14:44.050 --> 01:14:47.650
maybe it's John Bonham and I imagined something in my heart.

1273
01:14:47.690 --> 01:14:51.640
I'm just chasing after it,
chasing after every hit,

1274
01:14:51.641 --> 01:14:52.780
everything I'm always going.

1275
01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:56.440
Does that sound like I want it to sound and feel the way I want the feel.

1276
01:14:56.530 --> 01:15:00.760
So it doesn't matter what notes I'm playing him.
Cheat on directing myself,

1277
01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:04.210
making adjustments with my right hand,
my left hand,
my right foot,
my left foot,

1278
01:15:04.450 --> 01:15:08.020
everything,
my posture,
everything to get that kind of sound.

1279
01:15:08.021 --> 01:15:11.850
Am I getting that sound that I'm feeling and imagine it.

1280
01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:15.550
So I haven't been just doing just doing it.
Yeah.
Well,
you know,

1281
01:15:15.551 --> 01:15:18.550
it was a pet peeve of mine and still is to this day when you're watching a music

1282
01:15:18.551 --> 01:15:18.821
video,

1283
01:15:18.821 --> 01:15:22.900
but you don't see a lot of them the amount of fucking times where they never had

1284
01:15:22.901 --> 01:15:24.510
the drummer sinked incorrectly.

1285
01:15:24.690 --> 01:15:27.520
He said the snare and he's always hitting a kick and vice versa,

1286
01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:29.230
and it's just the fucking worse.

1287
01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:33.460
Or you hear him playing the high hat and he's fucking crashed and assemble date

1288
01:15:33.461 --> 01:15:35.780
this,
they never have any fucking respect for a drummer.

1289
01:15:35.781 --> 01:15:36.800
And I gotta tell you something,
dude,

1290
01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:40.150
the amount of respect I I already had for you.
And just listen to them,
you know,

1291
01:15:40.151 --> 01:15:43.240
the whole background and how all this stuff you've overcome in your whole

1292
01:15:43.241 --> 01:15:47.270
attitude towards it is that you're an inspirational guy.
And,
uh,
and,

1293
01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:51.150
and you sang the Jack and Diane Filomeno.
I'm fucking completed it.
This,

1294
01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:54.160
this is fantastic.
And he's got a new book out called sex,

1295
01:15:54.161 --> 01:15:56.500
drugs and rock and roll.
Uh,
Kenny Aronoff,

1296
01:15:56.501 --> 01:16:00.280
thank you so much for coming on the podcast that I should say that,
you know,

1297
01:16:00.281 --> 01:16:03.520
you say speaking inspirational.
I've been doing a lot of,
uh,

1298
01:16:03.690 --> 01:16:07.540
his article in Forbes.
I sent you that.
Uh,
I don't know if he got it.
I said,

1299
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:10.890
have a look at emails.
I'll look for it.
Not Email.
Is this text you put it,

1300
01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.790
but the point is up.
Didn't do a lot of speaking.

1301
01:16:12.791 --> 01:16:16.150
That book gave me the inspiration to go out and I have a whole show.

1302
01:16:16.151 --> 01:16:18.430
I'm going to do marathon oil in two days.
Well,

1303
01:16:18.431 --> 01:16:21.970
I have a whole hour and 15 minute show was as Christ.

1304
01:16:21.971 --> 01:16:26.200
I'm going to be opening for you,
so let me know.
Anyway,
let me do 20 minutes.

1305
01:16:26.201 --> 01:16:28.200
Katie,
I can't believe I forgot who I was.

1306
01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:32.720
I was joking and telling you I have the VHS copies that I bought like the,

1307
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:35.300
I don't know how many I bought them in the 90s where it was like a,

1308
01:16:35.301 --> 01:16:38.860
you'll be a power house until I fucking,

1309
01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:41.590
I gotta we gotta hang it some fun cause I got to,
I want to do this.

1310
01:16:41.591 --> 01:16:46.240
I never do autographs.
I just want to,
I know things.
I do.
Thank you so much.

1311
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:48.400
Awesome.
All right guys.
Thank you for listening.
