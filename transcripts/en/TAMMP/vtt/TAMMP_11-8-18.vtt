1
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.590
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.591 --> 00:00:08.110
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.860
And I am just checking in our home.

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.730
<v 2>Ooh,</v>

5
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.760
<v 1>what's going on?
How are you?
I'm in Chicago.</v>

6
00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:21.820
My kind of town.

7
00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:26.050
Chicago is my kind of town.

8
00:00:26.051 --> 00:00:31.020
Chicago is eating harder attack foods.

9
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:36.021
Your cargo is a great place to put on 40 pounds.

10
00:00:37.511 --> 00:00:42.440
It's my kind of town.
Yeah.
Oh,

11
00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:45.160
they got steaks,
chops,
deep dish pizza.

12
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.533
<v 0>You know,</v>

13
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.290
<v 1>I remember that old SNL sketch when they all dress like my dick care and they</v>

14
00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:53.450
all have in fucking heart attacks and stuff.
Yeah.
Uh,

15
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.340
this ends my sixth straight weekends on the road and I gotta tell you

16
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.800
I was in such great shape at the beginning of it and now I'm starting to go in

17
00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:05.730
the wrong direction.
So it starts tonight.
Uh,

18
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.860
just ordered a little bit of room service,
something healthy,

19
00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:13.390
something not so healthy.
But uh,
I'm fucking,
I got two shows tonight.

20
00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:16.000
I'm just going to go home and you can tell him fighting off a fucking cold.

21
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.630
That almost ruined my show last night at Madison Square Garden.

22
00:01:19.631 --> 00:01:24.250
Thank you to everybody who showed up.
I had a great God damn town time.

23
00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:28.790
The sound was incredible.
And um,

24
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.900
I had a bunch of friends came out and saw it and they all were like,
oh my God,

25
00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:37.310
we,
we really enjoyed it,
which made me feel good.
Thank you to the people,

26
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.340
you know,
some people gave me some gifts,
you know,
I got some cigars this week.

27
00:01:40.341 --> 00:01:44.090
Thank you to everybody.
Came out to theF is for family.
Um,

28
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.110
thingamajig there that I did at the uh,

29
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.100
Paley Center with Mike Price and Peter Billingsley.

30
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:55.190
We actually aired the first episode for the people that were there.

31
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.620
We actually got a great review from Forbes magazine about our third season

32
00:01:59.621 --> 00:02:03.300
saying it's her best fucking season and,
and,

33
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.810
and one of the top half hours on Netflix.
I mean,

34
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.670
I am having a hell of a week.
I really am.

35
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.090
I'm enjoying myself,
but I'm eating like a fucking idiot.

36
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.120
So drinking his stupid ass fucking vitamin C Shit.

37
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.800
You know,
don't just keep drinking those packets.
Psych.
Well,

38
00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:25.230
it's a thousand milligrams.
What does drink two of them?

39
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:27.540
That's why I really went to thousand of anything in me.

40
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:28.803
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

41
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.250
<v 1>that's,
it seems a like,
like a lot.
Can you o d on vitamin C,</v>

42
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.293
<v 0>you know</v>

43
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.010
<v 1>how many times can the cold virus kick vitamin C's ass before we realized that</v>

44
00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:44.190
it really doesn't do anything.

45
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.380
Vitamin C over dose,

46
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.350
you know,
somebody did this.
Okay.
Four adults,

47
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:57.700
the recommended daily amount for vitamin C's.

48
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.730
65 to 90 milligrams.
Now what do I got?

49
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.640
I got a thousand milligrams.
Uh,

50
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.360
and the upper limit is 2000 milligrams a day.

51
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.560
Although too much dietary vitamin C is unlikely to be harmful.

52
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.840
Mega doses of vitamin C supplements might cause diarrhea or nausea.

53
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.481
Okay.
And we can't,

54
00:03:20.481 --> 00:03:24.780
Oh d on it be fucking hilarious if you get so into health that you fucking

55
00:03:24.781 --> 00:03:27.580
overdosed the ugly truth behind the vitamin,

56
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.740
vitamin C overdose according to Spoon University,

57
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.330
uh,
that they'd like to snuggle when they learn things.
Spoon University.

58
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.180
I hate being sick and I'm guessing you do too,
says the article,
uh,

59
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.830
up up above Shamo.
See,

60
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.020
you've heard someone that you can never take too much vitamin C.

61
00:03:46.021 --> 00:03:50.070
Is that really to trope or is it a myth?
Can we overdose environment and say,

62
00:03:50.071 --> 00:03:54.870
I don't care.
I don't care.
I'm fucking,
if I'm reading,
just say the answer.

63
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.520
<v 0>Okay.</v>

64
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.840
<v 1>Don't want to read an episode of a fuck a television show that doesn't exist.</v>

65
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.253
<v 0>Okay.</v>

66
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.790
<v 1>It's an old person reading a book.
The other day at the airport I was just like,</v>

67
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:10.210
wow,
that's fucking amazing.
You know,

68
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:11.170
they just didn't give in,

69
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.920
wasn't staring at a fucking smart phone like everybody else.
Clued myself,

70
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.460
you know,
I actually use my smartphone to help me with my stress.

71
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.880
Whenever I'm stressing out,
I just play fucking solitaire.

72
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.800
<v 0>You know?</v>

73
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.740
<v 1>It's got a nice fucking mellow guitar thing.
Wayne,
Wayne,
Wayne.</v>

74
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:31.890
Where when a barrel,
this fucking song,

75
00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:35.070
it plays in the background and I just don't give a shit and try to beat my top

76
00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:38.880
score and own.
I look up,
I was still in at the airport.

77
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.480
I don't give a fuck.
I really don't.
You know what I hate?

78
00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:46.530
I hate when these fucking near the fucking security line at the airport and some

79
00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:48.480
fucking asshole behind you goes.

80
00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:51.720
It was so can I just get through them so by my flight's already boarding,

81
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.630
it's just like,
okay,
well you fucking going to miss it then

82
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.080
now because you're late because you're late,

83
00:04:59.081 --> 00:05:02.860
you get rewarded for being late by not having to wait in the fucking line.

84
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:05.920
Like the rest of us.
Fuck you.
Fuck you and fuck your flight.

85
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.200
You know,
I'm sorry.
Can I just end in this stupid body language?

86
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.990
They're trying to be all like uh,

87
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.830
submissive as they walked past you.
I mean,

88
00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:23.220
what's to stop somebody from just saying my flight leaves in fucking 10 minutes.

89
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.660
I mean,
that's the move.

90
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.310
If you don't have TSA precheck or a global or a,
you know,

91
00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:30.680
if you didn't have your taint mapped,

92
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.720
whatever the fuck they doing now to get you on the plane sooner.

93
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.120
I mean that's the move I think.

94
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:37.510
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

95
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.810
<v 1>You're conspiracy theorist and you don't want them to have any more information</v>

96
00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:43.300
about you,
but you don't like waiting in lines.
I would just show up to,
yeah,

97
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.490
sorry.
It might make my flight leaves in 10 minutes.
Can I just,
can I get,

98
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.310
go age had a stairway cages.
Yeah.

99
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.430
Some of these to give those people the old right there,
Fred.
Oh God,

100
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.750
I'm fucking miserable.
If I can do these two shows tonight and not get sick,

101
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.970
if I can just fight it off.

102
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.023
<v 3>MMM.</v>

103
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.420
<v 1>But anyways,
I had the greatest fucking night ever last night.
Just wire to wire.</v>

104
00:06:09.421 --> 00:06:11.040
I just had a fucking awesome set.

105
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.163
<v 3>MMM.</v>

106
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.730
<v 1>Then the after party was at Gotham comedy club with the Mozillas who I've known</v>

107
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:19.790
forever and uh,
they made this some credible cake.

108
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.063
<v 3>MMM.</v>

109
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.860
<v 1>I believe they've got the cake boss to make it.
We took pictures.</v>

110
00:06:25.861 --> 00:06:29.070
I uploaded a shit,
but it was,
uh,
it was,

111
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.720
the cake was not only Madison Square Garden.
It also looked like a snare drum.

112
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.760
Cause you know,
obviously I played drums.

113
00:06:35.761 --> 00:06:40.761
There was a helicopter on it and then they had this big figurine of me wearing

114
00:06:41.641 --> 00:06:44.880
that fucking shirt.
I wore my last special with the stars on it.

115
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.400
And then,
uh,

116
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.840
they had the John Bonham screen sparkle 1971 Ludwig kit.

117
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.840
You know what,
this little Zeplin for insignia on it.
It was incredible.

118
00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.390
Fucking cake was incredible.
And they let us,

119
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.390
well I can't see what they let us do cause I don't want to get them in fucking

120
00:07:03.391 --> 00:07:06.540
trouble.
But you know something they usually make you do outside.

121
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.520
They allowed us to do insight,
which was fucking tremendous.
Um,

122
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.400
then that was it.
I didn't fucking went home.
And now I'm,
now I'm in Chicago,

123
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.530
I'm in fucking Chicago.

124
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.070
I got four shows here and uh,

125
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.620
the Chicago theater,

126
00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:29.420
which arguably has the greatest marquis and the country,

127
00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:33.080
I feel,
um,
speaking of the greatest,
uh,

128
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.720
Paul Versey special thanks to you guys

129
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.330
is a,
it's one of the highest rates specials,
comedy central sat in a long time.

130
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.580
It's fucking crushing.
It has over like a million views.
Um,

131
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.880
so thank you to everybody who went out and watched it.

132
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:52.490
It's still streaming on comedy central.
You can check it out.

133
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.850
It's great for Paul's.
Great for me.
Cause he did it with my company.

134
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:59.300
All things comedy by an Al Magicals,
you know,
it's fucking tremendous.

135
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:01.160
That's the first one.
And you know what?

136
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:05.120
We got three more common you'd take Paul offers.

137
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.680
He was was was the high watermark and we're going to dip.
Nope.

138
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.870
Everybody's is going to be at the same fucking level.

139
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.470
It's all going to be quality.
Um,
do I sound like Trump right now?

140
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.880
I actually watched a little bit of that news conference,
by the way.
You know,

141
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.420
that childish fucking affair,
Jesus Christ.
Everybody has a yelling at each other

142
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.810
report,
a continuing to ask questions.

143
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.880
It's Trump's saying I'm done with you.

144
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.550
Then he walked away from the microphone to that whole fucking thing on both

145
00:08:36.551 --> 00:08:40.600
sides was like embarrassing.
Um,
and I'm not a fan of Trump,

146
00:08:40.601 --> 00:08:45.601
but for people to sit there and act like the media does not fucking absolutely

147
00:08:45.911 --> 00:08:49.510
hate that fucking guy.
I've never seen,
I mean,

148
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.260
I've never seen a guy get fucking attacked the way this fucking dude gets

149
00:08:53.261 --> 00:08:56.340
attacked.
It's like a comic play a hell room.

150
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.310
He's just up there getting fucking heckled and he's like,

151
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:02.730
I'm not going to do my fucking act that I go do my act.
Ah,
you fucking suck.

152
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.410
Um,
I dunno.

153
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.270
It's the worst job on the fucking plant.

154
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:13.830
And you could literally get blamed for everything.
You know,
why not?

155
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:16.590
Why don't they fucking have a press conference with some of these fucking piece

156
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:21.000
of shit?
Corporations polluting the waters,
stealing from people,

157
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.940
blowing up the economy and then ripping the rug out from everyone.

158
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:28.080
What the fuck about them?
You become president.
You just,
you just,

159
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:31.290
they're fucking stooge and you go out there and you stand there and you just get

160
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:35.160
yelled at by these fucking nerds who think they're in the paper.

161
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:37.260
Chase is some shit.
Um,

162
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:44.190
I have no idea.
Another fucking bad story.
It's just a bad,
you know,

163
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.570
I just put it on the TV and I saw that whole thing about the fucking one of

164
00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:50.670
those mass shootings.
Thanks.
And uh,

165
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.240
it just makes no sense that those things happen all the time.

166
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.660
Other than the fact that that's all they fucking show on TV.

167
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.890
And there has to be some sort of connection to that because there's always been

168
00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:06.140
a shit of guns
and a shitload of people that had them.

169
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.780
And I,
I literally think like,

170
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.570
it's like the ice bucket challenge for Psychos and they just fucked me over that

171
00:10:14.571 --> 00:10:16.490
everybody's so very during the ice bucket challenge.

172
00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:20.060
So then everybody had to start dumping fucking water over their heads instead of

173
00:10:20.061 --> 00:10:24.860
just giving money.
I never understood that.
It's like,
what is the cause?
Okay.

174
00:10:24.861 --> 00:10:28.030
That's a good cause.
I mean,
I don't have to ruin my shirt for delay.

175
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.370
Would you like some money?
I'm willing to give you some.

176
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.310
So
I would love to see if they could experiment,

177
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:40.110
just not giving it any coverage

178
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.060
and then it would just fade away like an old pop star,
I think.

179
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:46.690
<v 3>Okay.</v>

180
00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.270
<v 1>You know,
I dunno.
That's my too,
because other than that,</v>

181
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.420
I don't have any fucking solution for it.

182
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.593
<v 3>MMM.</v>

183
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.320
<v 1>Just fucking horrific.
Oh,
anybody could fucking do something like that.</v>

184
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.240
Um,
but anyways,
back to the comedy.
Back to the comedy.
Um,

185
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:11.320
oh my God.
This is one of these fucking day.
Some days doing a podcast is easy.

186
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.220
You know,
it's like falling out of bed.
Well that's not a fucking,

187
00:11:15.221 --> 00:11:17.530
it's the one thing,
isn't it?
It's like getting out of bed,
rolling out of bed.

188
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:24.380
It's like taking a nap.
Is that an easy thing?
We asked people,

189
00:11:24.381 --> 00:11:27.500
a hundred people did a survey said name the top five things are easy.
Yeah.

190
00:11:27.501 --> 00:11:29.690
You know bad.
I would suck on fucking the family feud.

191
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.500
I keep saying the name of the shelter.
Family feud.
James.

192
00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:39.400
Something that's easy to do.
Uh,
Mr. Byrd,
a fall out of bed,

193
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.070
show me fall out of bed,
back.

194
00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.610
Sullivan family with a chance to steal.
I'd be that last family member.

195
00:11:48.611 --> 00:11:51.640
You know what I mean?
Fucking dude all the way down the end.

196
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.910
You know,

197
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.390
families only have so many smart people and it seems what you watched a family

198
00:11:59.391 --> 00:12:01.550
feud.
It stops around three.

199
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:06.450
Is there five people on a show was always the last to you know,
some,

200
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.950
we always just said something that sucks.
Well you should really do.
I think,

201
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.150
well how would you do that?

202
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.920
It's almost like a batting lineup with intelligence.
Okay.

203
00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.610
Cause you got to have,
you lead off hitter.
You know,

204
00:12:20.611 --> 00:12:22.800
you've got to have somebody bat and clean up and then he'd get,
you know,

205
00:12:22.801 --> 00:12:27.110
you got your pitcher,
bat and knife.
If we're,

206
00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.470
if we're going by national league rules here,
right?
What do you do?

207
00:12:31.471 --> 00:12:35.400
Do you put the dummy up front when all the answers are still on the board?

208
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:43.130
Name a word that begins with a apple being number one answer,

209
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.890
right?
Or do you just leave that guy down the end

210
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.750
and hope that everybody else,
you know,
does a good job?

211
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:56.760
I wonder if there's fights.
You know when somebody finds out.

212
00:12:56.761 --> 00:12:59.040
Yeah.
Hey,
we're going to have you all the way down to the end.

213
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.940
Basically the right field of intelligence.

214
00:13:02.941 --> 00:13:05.760
We're going to have you all the way down the fucking end now as the person too

215
00:13:05.761 --> 00:13:09.840
stupid to realize that that's where the dumbest person is.
You know,

216
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:11.370
everybody needs to get a hit.

217
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.430
Everybody needs to get ahead because this motherfucker's going to get a strike.

218
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.450
All right?
Just put him all the fuck way down.

219
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.670
He's going to get the least at bats.

220
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.983
<v 0>In theory,</v>

221
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.850
<v 1>the APP,
they should have a fucking a week of,</v>

222
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.540
of all those fucking people down the ends.
You know,

223
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.140
you just makes super families out of that last person.

224
00:13:37.141 --> 00:13:38.970
Just the dumbest mother fuckers ever.

225
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.140
Oh,
where'd you call it?

226
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.750
Family feud of fucking dope week.

227
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.650
Who else that shows it's still Steve Harvey.

228
00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.990
He would probably run on a looks to give the crowd.
Um,

229
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:01.901
anyway,

230
00:14:01.901 --> 00:14:06.010
so I'm hearing in Chicago this buckets and I gotta I gotta I gotta get back on

231
00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:08.650
my God damn diet.
You know,

232
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.030
I was looking good before I did this six week run.

233
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.980
I had my whole fucking future ahead of me.
You know,
it's fucking hilarious.

234
00:14:17.981 --> 00:14:22.570
I'm going to the heart doctor next week.
If you get my ticker checked out,
uh,

235
00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.600
six weeks ago,
that gang or in phenomenal shape for your age,

236
00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.150
and I was going to be like,
hey,
you probably want to lose seven pounds.

237
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.140
I can do it though.
I'm going to be that.
You know what I'm going to be,

238
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:37.180
I'm going to be that fucking guy that loses weight during the holidays.
You know,

239
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.120
he was only one way to do that.
You gotta be homeless.
Nobody loves you

240
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.030
because I don't care how much of an asshole you are.
When it's the holidays,

241
00:14:48.031 --> 00:14:49.240
somebody is going to make cookies,

242
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.113
<v 0>right?</v>

243
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.060
<v 1>Those stupid little tins.
You walk over and you open it up,
you know,</v>

244
00:14:56.061 --> 00:15:00.380
is that voice in the back of your head?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

245
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.470
And then you shout it down with,
you know,
I'm going to go to the gym in January.

246
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.000
I'm going to start the year with a giant fucking

247
00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.920
steamship round for a fucking torso.
I can't do it,
man.

248
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.433
<v 3>MMM.</v>

249
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.680
<v 1>I'm disgusted with myself.
Look what you dead,
Bill.</v>

250
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.250
You had a good thing going.
You fucking ruined it.
Um,

251
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.470
I haven't watched any sports.
I don't even know what's going on anymore.
Right?

252
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:32.520
Red Sox won the world series and I just been fucking flying high.

253
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.360
I haven't watched anything.
I know the late.
What about fucking Duke?

254
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:40.050
Just absolutely kicking the fucking shit out of Kentucky.

255
00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:44.640
It once again.
Once again,
they,
they,
they got it.
They got another guy.

256
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.400
How do they fucking do it?

257
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.750
Duke Verse Kentucky.

258
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.821
Now,

259
00:15:53.821 --> 00:15:57.270
how does that work to do they just have this shit just to like for the ratings

260
00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:02.220
so they can figure out who's,
uh,
who's the best team?
Does this actually count?

261
00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:07.670
Is it like soccer where they have a friendly chat up?
You know,

262
00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.770
soccer's is like that.
You know,
we're playing but it doesn't,

263
00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:10.700
it doesn't mean anything.

264
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.053
<v 3>MMM.</v>

265
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:19.880
<v 1>That's 75,
47 with 14 minutes to go.
Are you fucking kidding me?</v>

266
00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.540
They scored 75 points and a half.
I think.
You just can't be

267
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:25.690
<v 3>okay.</v>

268
00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:30.380
<v 1>It can't be
one 18 to 84.</v>

269
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.350
That's like a fucking NBA score.

270
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:33.440
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

271
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.330
<v 1>They still let up 84 points,
so</v>

272
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.090
I dunno.
I Dunno how to fuck that works,
but it did somehow.

273
00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.330
I'll tell you what.
They have Duke Blue Devils.

274
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:54.170
They put a weapon on that fucking wild cats from Kentucky.
All right,

275
00:16:54.171 --> 00:16:56.940
let me do a couple of reads here.

wine or liquor delivered while someone filing decided to do something about it.

278
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.860
Introducing Staffie,

Now,
if he'll now,

281
00:17:17.211 --> 00:17:21.110
if you live in Los Angeles,

00:17:33.041 --> 00:17:36.010
San Diego,
Sacramento,

286
00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.520
This is how long I've been on the tour.
I'm like,

<v 1>Cause it's kind of weird to be an adult wearing a fucking onesy.</v>

331

those adult babies,

332
00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:32.180
sit in a fucking crib cause you can't deal with reality.

333
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.460
Well I guess,
you know,

334
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:38.180

Oh,

343
00:21:03.281 --> 00:21:07.690
butcher box,
right?
Butcher box.

344
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.240
That reminds me,
I looked up battleaxe today since the fucking funny thing,
Eh,

345
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.140
I tried to tucked in that fucking battle ax over there.
You know,

346
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.240
I always thought that meant an ugly woman.

347
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.990
It just means a woman who doesn't take any shit and she's difficult.

348
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.083
<v 0>Right.</v>

349
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.730
<v 1>You know,
I dunno.
I always thought like a battle ax.
It looked bad.</v>

350
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.250
It was all fucked up looking cause she went to battle on it.

351
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:40.990
So you've seen her face look like a battle ax?
I guess it wasn't though.

352
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:45.050
They determined.
Let's look up the definition of bad actually.

353
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:47.660
<v 0>Like God,</v>

354
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.410
<v 1>call your wife that and see what the fuck happens,
eh?
Yeah.</v>

355
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:56.650
Fucking battle ax.
All right.

356
00:21:56.651 --> 00:22:01.600
Battleaxe meaning is a term generally considered a pejorative?

357
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.850
Do you know?
Many times I've looked up pejorative.

358
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.580
That's like when they said the Democrats won the house.
I was like,
oh my God,

359
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.880
what does that mean?
Every election I have to look up.

360
00:22:12.881 --> 00:22:15.500
What does the fucking house do versus what does the Senate though?

361
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.610
I thought they were all,

362
00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:21.640
I don't think all is at the Capitol is one side of the house.

363
00:22:21.641 --> 00:22:26.390
The other side's the Senate.
I Dunno.

364
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:26.830
Whenever you,

365
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:30.350
I just picture you go in there and all you hear is the sound of loafers walking

366
00:22:30.351 --> 00:22:34.700
on marble.
Alright.
Expressing contempt or disapproval.

367
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:39.890
Pejorative.
Can you use it and explore in a sentence please?

368
00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.330
Oh,
it gives a fuck.
I don't even care anymore.
Right.

369
00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.860
A battleax you fucking battle ax whenever.
I see.

370
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:54.550
Okay.
So it's,
well,
what just happened?
Oh,
there it is.
All right.

371
00:22:54.551 --> 00:22:59.150
A battle ax is a term generally considered pejorative for an aggressive,

372
00:22:59.151 --> 00:23:02.870
domineering,
and forceful woman.
Oh,

373
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.580
this is the female word for cock sucker guys.
Dick.
Uh,

374
00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.370
she's a fucking battleaxe and he's a fucking Dick.

375
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:15.490
Battleaxe it's just funnier.

376
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.900
The battleax is one of several stereotypes found in nursing,

377
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:21.161
a tyrannical,

378
00:23:21.161 --> 00:23:26.161
fierce matron exemplified by nurse ratchet or Haiti's shock and popular medical

379
00:23:27.521 --> 00:23:31.790
dramas and comedies.
Why the fuck?

380
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:36.200
Why is everybody picking on nurses?
I Dunno.

381
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.340
It's kind of my goal this week.
I'm going to call somebody a battleax.

382
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:44.900
I would never call my wife that she's too fucking.

383
00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:49.160
What's the worst thing?
I have a call with my wife.

384
00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:56.360
I don't call.
I don't,
I don't do the name.
Call it thick most.

385
00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:00.430
How do we stop being such a fucking asshole?
Leave me alone.

386
00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:06.820
Just leave me alone.
All right.
All right.
What's your box?
Everybody?

387
00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:13.290
Butcher box delivers healthy 100% grass fed and grass finished beef free range,

388
00:24:14.231 --> 00:24:18.820
organic chicken and Ah,
heritage bread.

389
00:24:18.821 --> 00:24:23.770
Pork.
Oh,
do you owe it to yourself to eat one of those fucking pigs?

390
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.260
The incredible quality of butcher box meets,

391
00:24:26.261 --> 00:24:30.610
start with the commitment to raising animals humanely free of antibiotics and

392
00:24:30.611 --> 00:24:32.320
hormones before they murdered them.

393
00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:35.890
Each box comes with at least eight to 11 pounds of meat,

394
00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:41.100
which is enough for 24 individual size meals or one and a half meals for a binge

395
00:24:41.861 --> 00:24:44.490
eater when those little skinny Asian guys,

396
00:24:44.491 --> 00:24:48.790
if for some reason when the hot dog eating contest right and the big fat dude

397
00:24:48.791 --> 00:24:53.470
kid can't get it done,
you can choose from five different box types,
all beef,

398
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.550
beef and chicken,
beef and pork,
mixed box or custom box

399
00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:02.950
which lets you choose your own cuts.
All right.
Personal experience.

400
00:25:02.951 --> 00:25:07.000
I already told you guys told you many times that heritage bread pork mean it's

401
00:25:07.001 --> 00:25:08.260
pure bred.

402
00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:12.880
It's like it's the original pigs from Europe for whatever reason they taste

403
00:25:12.881 --> 00:25:15.580
better than the ones we got over here.
You know,

404
00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.420
probably because our pigs around eat fucking Mcdonald's,
you know,

405
00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.790
grew up on peanut butter and fluff it out or some shit.

406
00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:23.890
I don't know what the hell these fucking

407
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.910
uppity goddamn heritage breed pork with doing,
but whatever they did it,
they did.

408
00:25:29.911 --> 00:25:31.770
It tastes fucking delicious.
Anyways,

409
00:25:31.771 --> 00:25:36.660
for $20 off your first box in two pounds of free ground beef in every box for

410
00:25:36.661 --> 00:25:38.100
the life of your subscription.

411
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.330
That's $20 off your first box in two pounds of free meat a month.

412
00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.460
That's a lot of fucking meat quarter pounder,
right?

413
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:52.920
That'd be eight quarter pounders.
How many days?
And we're not month.

414
00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.100
Well built,
depends on the month.
All right,

let's get back to this fucking bullshit over here.
Let me see.

422
00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.310
You know,

423
00:26:23.311 --> 00:26:24.960

I just popped up.
All right,
let's see what we got here.</v>

427
00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:42.780
But up up,
up as,
let's play the feud.
Alright,
let's see.

428
00:26:42.781 --> 00:26:47.130
My 10 number one would be content.
Number two would be bitch

429
00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.900
a horse gotta be in their slot.
Battle ax.

430
00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:55.323
<v 0>Haffer</v>

431
00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:01.410
<v 1>uh,
Jesus Christ.
That's all I got.</v>

432
00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:06.610
That's going to be something else.
What else can I call you fucking,
uh,

433
00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:09.780
that was kind of covers it,
right?

434
00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.673
<v 0>Bimbo,</v>

435
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.700
<v 1>dumb,
dumb.
I'm just run.
Just becoming a fucking second grader.
All right.</v>

436
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:21.830
The 10 worst things you can call a female who may see this list.
What,

437
00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:23.830
how did I end up looking this up?
What the fuck is wrong?

438
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:28.780
The 10 worst things you can call a woman.
Number 10,
bitch,

439
00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.150
this is probably the most common term.

440
00:27:31.151 --> 00:27:35.200
You straight into the point yet not as degrading because of its immense

441
00:27:35.201 --> 00:27:39.400
popularity in common use.
Well,
it depends on,
on,
yeah.
Like

442
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.850
I think if black women,

443
00:27:42.851 --> 00:27:47.560
if you call him a bitch at me and it's means more white women for some reason

444
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.190
why we've been really don't like content.

445
00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.050
And I think white people say cunt a lot.

446
00:27:53.051 --> 00:27:56.560
I don't know that black people say content,
which would be fucking hilarious.

447
00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.960
Um,
at least American black people.
I haven't seen it,
you know,

448
00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:04.000
not like I'm out here doing a cut survey,

449
00:28:04.001 --> 00:28:08.110
but I'm just generally speaking the people that I talked to,
uh,

450
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.170
anyways,
I find black people will add,
you know,

451
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.800
add to bitch stank bitch or something like that.

452
00:28:16.801 --> 00:28:18.690
But they never seem to make the leap to cut

453
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:26.040
white people like bitches.
Just sad.
She's a bitch.
You know what?

454
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:30.410
She's really being a bitch.
She's a cut and that's how it works.
Everybody.

455
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:34.380
All right,
number nine cow.
Speaking of butcher box cow,

456
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.340
the only reason this is so low on the list is because it never comes as a

457
00:28:38.341 --> 00:28:42.300
surprise of fat.
Chick knows she's a fetch Jesus Christ.

458
00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.380
She knows she's a fat chick.
In fact,
sometimes they even embrace it.

459
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:52.020
So in rare cases,
this going actually backfire.
Now I don't think,

460
00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:56.250
I don't think this works.
I don't,
I don't,
I don't believe in that.

461
00:28:56.251 --> 00:28:59.700
And who wants to be called a fucking cow?
That is funny though.

462
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.260
If fucking cow
cows funny than pig.

463
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:09.120
When you say you fat pig,
you're fat cow.
There's something about cow.

464
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:14.190
Maybe it's the sound.
It's is out.
You know,
this hours in there,
it hurts.

465
00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:18.840
It's a hurtful thing.
Slut
number seven,

466
00:29:18.841 --> 00:29:23.790
horse slash po number six is slob.

467
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.960
Wait a second.
I didn't mind when you called me a whore,

468
00:29:29.961 --> 00:29:34.550
but when you said I was a Slob,
that was it.
Skank pig.

469
00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:39.170
Bimbo,
slut smut bag.
Oh,

470
00:29:39.171 --> 00:29:42.860
this is worse than my list and it can't.
Yup.

471
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:47.620
You knew camp was going to be number one.
All right.

472
00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:50.320
Now let's now let's be fair.
Let's be fair to the ladies here.

473
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:52.923
<v 0>All right.</v>

474
00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.430
<v 1>Top 10 worst things you can call your boyfriend.</v>

475
00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:02.390
This is how you killed time on the road as a comedian,
by the way.

476
00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:09.830
Uh,
all right.
This is hilarious.
Women have 25 things that they call guys.

477
00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.570
They really do talk more,
don't they?
25 wars.

478
00:30:12.571 --> 00:30:16.100
Pet names for your lover thinks you don't want to call your lover.

479
00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:20.780
50 horrible nicknames for your significant other.
13 was pet names.

480
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:22.060

All right,

482
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.880
I would imagine when he takes his dick out,
they go.
Is that it?

483
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.700
It tickles.
Um,
all right.
Number one,

484
00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.590
you're so much better than all the other jerks I dated.
Yeah.

485
00:30:42.591 --> 00:30:47.390
Cause that makes them a meal to think,
well,
how much cock has been in you?
Uh,

486
00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.910
can you really afford that?

487
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:51.620
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

488
00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:55.130
<v 1>This is just one of these classic things.
It's like today,
even ask guys,</v>

489
00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:59.570
can you really afford that?
Can you really afford that?
Uh,
yeah,
I can.
Or No,

490
00:30:59.571 --> 00:31:02.420
I can't.
Thank you for stopping me from making this bad purchase.

491
00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.460
That seems like a concern,
girlfriend.

492
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:11.050
So we're running a little late.
Relax.
All right,

493
00:31:11.051 --> 00:31:13.960
so we're running a little late.
Comes with the territory.

494
00:31:13.961 --> 00:31:17.530
But if there's a preemptive relaxed before I flipped out,
that would bug me.

495
00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:23.240
Although I don't know if this makes my top 10.
He's a great guy.

496
00:31:23.241 --> 00:31:26.600
You should be friends with him.
Yeah.
That means you guys used to fuck.

497
00:31:26.601 --> 00:31:31.580
Are you about ready to number five?
She made me promise not to tell,

498
00:31:31.581 --> 00:31:35.330
but uh,
it's not surprising then that you can keep your fucking mouth shut.

499

No matter what you are asking.
Would you like some cereal?

506
00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:05.870
Don't be silly.

He had a face mask,

569
00:36:51.991 --> 00:36:56.991
his face mask look like the front of a dodge ram pickup truck looked like the

570
00:36:57.271 --> 00:37:00.300
grill of that dodge ram pickup truck.

571
00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:03.990
The second you see his face mask,
you know what he's doing?

572
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:07.710
He's getting the ball.
He's going right up the fucking middle.

573
00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:12.660
He's out running around the side like some fairy fucking running back.

574
00:37:12.661 --> 00:37:14.520
He's coming right up to fucking gut.

575
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:17.460
And that's exactly what that guy did all God.
Damn Day long.

576
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:21.000
He was stiff arming a defensive ends,

577
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.570
like they were cornerbacks just sort of throwing them aside.
It was,

578
00:37:24.571 --> 00:37:29.340
it was one of the most dominating performances that I've seen in a while.

579
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:31.051
And,
uh,

580
00:37:31.051 --> 00:37:36.051
so that was a little inspirational speech for my team because next week we play

581
00:37:37.231 --> 00:37:41.840
in the Pittsburgh.
And,
uh,

582
00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:44.310
I was already worried about that game.
But,
uh,

583
00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:47.370
this is the interesting thing about how football works is if the Patriots went

584
00:37:47.371 --> 00:37:50.640
in and actually beat the browns.
Um,

585
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:56.640
I was thinking that,
okay,
if we beat the browns and then we'd go up seven in one,

586
00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:00.210
we are going to get at what happened in Cleveland was going to happen in

587
00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:02.610
Pittsburgh.
But now for some fucking reason,

588
00:38:02.611 --> 00:38:04.950
this is how it seems to work that we lost in Cleveland.

589
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.920
We'll actually be way more competitive.

590
00:38:07.921 --> 00:38:12.000
I still think we're going to lose in Pittsburgh.
Our defense is fucking horrific.

591
00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:14.160
It's horrific.
You know,

592
00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:18.690
it's fucking frustrating to be going through.
You know,
it's actually not bad.

593
00:38:18.691 --> 00:38:23.100
We go through a fucking,
uh,
a a a rebuilding year,

594
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.120
you know,
and I know a lot of you guys out there just cause it's the patriots.

595
00:38:27.121 --> 00:38:29.220
You still think it's the fucking championship team.

596
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:33.150
Go get yourself a little team roster thing and look who's left.
You know,

597
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:36.460
our whole offense is built around,
thrown to rookie fucking tight ends.

598
00:38:36.461 --> 00:38:40.950
And Brady was off yesterday,
kept throwing everything through the fucking roof,

599
00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.113
right?

600
00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:45.020
I'm sitting there talking to these people in this sports bar actually found a

601
00:38:45.021 --> 00:38:49.620
cool one where it was kind of mellow and there wasn't really a,
you know,

602
00:38:49.621 --> 00:38:54.550
there's like this insane one around the corner where people,
it's just like,

603
00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.810
you can't even go in there with your team colors on because if your team is

604
00:38:57.811 --> 00:38:59.940
losing that day,
you're going to want to fight somebody.

605
00:38:59.941 --> 00:39:02.790
It's one of those places and it's just not an enjoyable experience.

606
00:39:02.791 --> 00:39:06.120
So I found this other one where they have like nice,
like,
you know,

607
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.240
it's just nice.
The decor is nice.
It doesn't have that fucking date rape vibe,

608
00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.840
like a lot of sports bars.
Do,
you know,
that fucking awful vibe.

609
00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:19.400
The pent up just fucking the,
the amount of fucking,
uh,

610
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:23.750
pent up,
you know,
and then they got the,

611
00:39:23.751 --> 00:39:27.790
those fucking girls always got to dress like runaways.
The waitresses,

612
00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:32.350
it's just creepy.
The whole fucking vibe is creepy.
I don't like it.
And it's just,

613
00:39:32.351 --> 00:39:35.110
yeah,
this is awful.
So I found this other sports bar that was,
you know,

614
00:39:35.111 --> 00:39:39.260
actually way more mellow.
And I'm sitting there,
right.
And I come walking in it.

615
00:39:39.261 --> 00:39:40.310
By the time I get there,

616
00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:45.720
it's already tend enough and Cleveland and I sit down as this dude next to me

617
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:46.950
already drinking beers.

618
00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.950
The game comes on at like fucking 10 in the morning and he's clearly on like his

619
00:39:49.951 --> 00:39:53.280
third beer.
I didn't realize that it would shift face.
I go,
Jesus Christ,

620
00:39:53.281 --> 00:39:57.510
they go 10 to nothing.
I go,
I go,
I go,
what happened?
And he looks at me,
he's like,

621
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.650
Cleveland is up 10 nothing.
I was just like,

622
00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.740
all right man.
Thank you.
Thank you for fucking a

623
00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:11.050
thank you for clearing that up.
You know,
um,

624
00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:16.790
and Jesus Christ and they just start.
It was awful.

625
00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:19.350
We just got the living shit kicked out of.

626
00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:22.550
And you know what was funny was last week,
this week I got,

627
00:40:22.551 --> 00:40:24.210
I got a ton of emails from jets fan.

628
00:40:24.211 --> 00:40:28.380
So it was very surprising because last week I didn't get any from him.
You know,

629
00:40:28.381 --> 00:40:31.560
last week when they lost to the packers,
nine to nothing at home.

630
00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:35.430
I got like two emails from jets fans and then this week it was weird,

631
00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:40.310
you know,
cause I was like,
wow,
I did do the jets fans not exist anymore.

632
00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:45.220
Then this week all of a sudden I get this whole avalanche.
Okay,
well look,

633
00:40:45.221 --> 00:40:48.310
I know all jet fans and all sports fans aren't like that because a lot of you

634
00:40:48.311 --> 00:40:50.890
didn't send me emails either fucking way.
But those,

635
00:40:50.891 --> 00:40:55.180
those fucking sports pussies who fucking lay in the weeds until that team wins

636
00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.200
and then they get out and start talking shit.
You know,

637
00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.260
let me ask you guys is because I've been just sitting here trashing the jets all

638
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:04.140
year.
It does.
Let me ask you this real honestly,
honestly,

639
00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:07.650
do you really think you're going to win the super bowl at that team?
You know,

640
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:12.160
because I have such blind hatred for the fucking jets after the shit talk and

641
00:41:12.161 --> 00:41:14.200
that they did at the beginning of the year.
Honestly.

642
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:19.020
Do you really think that that team has,
what the fuck it takes?

643
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:20.590
All right,

644
00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:25.590
set aside your ha seriously eking out a victory against the lions.

645
00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:30.890
You eked out a victory against the dolphins and you eat one out against the

646
00:41:30.891 --> 00:41:31.461
Broncos.

647
00:41:31.461 --> 00:41:35.810
Two out of three of those games were not for a bonehead fucking penalty by the

648
00:41:35.811 --> 00:41:39.110
other God damn team.
You know,

649
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:44.180
you could have lost one or maybe both of those to add to your two fucking
losses.

650
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:48.740
Now,
if I'm a jet fan,
I gotta be thinking no,
if I'm a jet fan,

651
00:41:48.741 --> 00:41:51.230
I got to be thinking,
the one thing I got going for myself

652
00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:57.080
is that nobody is dominating in the AFC.

653
00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:01.820
Nobody is,
you know,
that's the one thing that I would take.

654
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:06.440
I would take pride in the fact because the jets have not really dominated

655
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:08.720
anybody.
Have they?

656
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.650
They kicked the shit out of the Patriots,
but that wasn't until the sec,

657
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.320
oh actually we'll is this second half,

658
00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.680
second half after the second quarter they did.
But other than that,

659
00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.740
I dunno,
I'm not too impressed.

660
00:42:21.741 --> 00:42:25.250
I think that they're fucking offensive line might be the best in the league and

661
00:42:25.251 --> 00:42:27.980
Sanchez just sits back there in a fucking launch here.

662
00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.650
But I think if they actually go up against,
I dunno

663
00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:37.130
the giants,
I,
yeah,
I just,

664
00:42:37.131 --> 00:42:38.240
I don't fucking see it.

665
00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:43.460
You know what I'm basically saying is that when Joe Nemeth finally dies,

666
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.050
I hate to say it,

667
00:42:45.051 --> 00:42:48.920
I think you guys going to have to get them stuffed and mounted so you can still

668
00:42:48.921 --> 00:42:53.840
wheel them out into the field to get you to get that.

669
00:42:53.841 --> 00:42:54.231
He's like,

670
00:42:54.231 --> 00:42:57.890
you're newt Rockne and then he can stick one of those things in the side of his

671
00:42:57.891 --> 00:42:59.090
neck where you,
uh,

672
00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:03.080
will you just pull the fucking you Paul it and the string and he starts talking.

673
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:08.120
I think the Jetson going to make a great play.
I want to kiss you.

674
00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:12.200
You just have it sorta half fucking shit faced.
Half inspirational speech.

675
00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:17.990
Oh,
Jesus.
So next week we play the fucking Steelers and uh,
I dunno,

676
00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:19.070
I dunno what's going to happen.

677
00:43:19.071 --> 00:43:21.800
I think we're actually going to have a nice competitive fucking game with them

678
00:43:21.801 --> 00:43:23.570
somehow.
It makes no sense,

679
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:28.700
which is why I have to stop fucking gambling because I got to admit as much.

680
00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:32.930
Um,
I can't even say it really hurt because I don't give a fuck about Cleveland.

681
00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:37.790
Um,
and I also,
you know,
it's no surprise that our defense sucks.

682
00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.553
Um,

683
00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.820
the game that pissed me off the most yesterday was the fucking Kansas City

684
00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:47.300
chiefs game.
The,
this,
these were my pics yesterday.
Okay.

685
00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.450
I got this thing going on,
Paul Versey,
right?
Um,

686
00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.580
you've got to pick four games a fucking week.
The end of the year,

687
00:43:52.581 --> 00:43:56.490
the guy takes the pot,
right?
So I got the cheat,
I got the,

688
00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:00.740
I got the bears against buffalo bears given three.
I tied that game,

689
00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:02.143
right?

690
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:06.500
Then I picked Tampa and Tampa against Atlanta.

691
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.350
Get an eight and a half.
I fucking won that game.

692
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:12.590
I had green bay given seven,

693
00:44:12.591 --> 00:44:17.270
whatever the fuck against the hapless fucking cowboys,
right to oh in one.

694
00:44:17.271 --> 00:44:20.690
Nobody's gone undefeated.
I had the fucking Kansas City chiefs,

695
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:25.400
those fucking assholes.
One that Goddamn game and just decided to give it away.

696
00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:31.560
Uh,
I really want to blame the fucking refs,

697
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:36.000
but it at that fucking Matt Cassel,
he just,
he just drove me fucking nuts.

698
00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:40.230
Those fucking receivers not catching the ball.
I'll do kip.

699
00:44:40.231 --> 00:44:44.590
Fuck the Kansas City chiefs.
Fucking God damn asshole.

700
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:46.660
Do you see that fucking call chiefs fans?
You see,

701
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:50.760
you see that pass interference call the end of the fucking game when the Raiders

702
00:44:50.761 --> 00:44:51.511
were down by two.

703
00:44:51.511 --> 00:44:55.460
I can see this is why I think it's fixed and this is why I think I'm good.

704
00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:00.630
I would never gamble other than just with a buddy.
Like I don't,
I honestly,

705
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:04.320
I don't know how you fucking gamblers do it because the level of fucking

706
00:45:04.321 --> 00:45:08.550
emotions that you go through when you have money on the game is nothing.

707
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:12.930
Nothing compared to you.
Just love and your hometown teen,

708
00:45:12.931 --> 00:45:16.170
all those fucking douchebags Lou go out to the Raiders games.

709
00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:20.940
Then they fucking dress like Spock or whatever the fuck it is.

710
00:45:20.941 --> 00:45:23.310
Spock with like spikes coming out of his shoulders.

711
00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:27.750
As much as they think that they give a fuck.
You know,

712
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:32.100
you don't give a fuck as much as some guy who's not even from Oakland,

713
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.080
who's got money on that fucking game.

714
00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:38.640
I'm telling you why the fucking levels.
So God damn low,

715
00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.830
think it's time to get a new,
uh,
recorded here.

716
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.600
People have been bitching a little bit saying the levels are a little bit quiet

717
00:45:45.601 --> 00:45:49.680
here.
You gotta make sure I got this shit going here.
Hello?
Test one.
There we go.

718
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:50.910
All right.
So anyways,

719
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.340
when that fucking ref called that pass interference and then they show the

720
00:45:56.341 --> 00:46:00.530
replay and the announcers are just like,
oh,
let's see what's going on here.
Uh,

721
00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.110
doesn't seem to be any contact.
Well Jay,
Mike,

722
00:46:04.111 --> 00:46:08.430
I'll tell you I didn't see anything and then they just continue on.

723
00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.250
Nobody starts going,
well,
why the fuck?

724
00:46:11.251 --> 00:46:14.910
How the fuck do you call something that didn't even happen,
you know?

725
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:19.320
I mean,
I can see missing some shit that happened.

726
00:46:19.321 --> 00:46:23.070
It's like fucking 22 God damn people out there running around out of fuck.

727
00:46:23.071 --> 00:46:24.210
He supposed to see everything.

728
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:27.540
But how do you call some shit that didn't even fucking happen.

729
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:34.740
I swear to God,
I think it's fucking fixed on some level.

730
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:38.370
Something fucked up is going on.
And I challenged my listeners.
I right,

731
00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:42.870
you fuckers defend that.
How is,
you know,

732
00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.950
I don't like to sound like such an asshole who lost money on a fucking game.

733
00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.820
How do you call some shift?
It didn't happen.
I get at 22 fucking people.

734
00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:54.930
I get how you can miss something.
It's like standing in grand central station.

735
00:46:54.931 --> 00:46:59.010
Everybody's going every which way.
So I'm like,
oh my God.
Do you see that?

736
00:46:59.011 --> 00:47:01.410
Then homeless guy just took a shit on the floor.
Did you see that?

737
00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:04.920
Actually I didn't.
I was staring at that checks.
Ticks.
I missed it.

738
00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.630
I get that.
But how do you call die?
Death.

739
00:47:09.631 --> 00:47:12.320
Fucking 15 yards for shitting on the floor and there's no shit on the,

740
00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:15.960
on the floor.
That's such a stupid fucking example.

741
00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:21.530
This is how mad I was so fucking mad when the rest miss that God damn call and

742
00:47:22.291 --> 00:47:25.770
gave in fuck it.
And I didn't miss the call.
Just invented that fucking call.

743
00:47:25.771 --> 00:47:27.750
Get the fucking Raiders are first down.

744
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:33.870
And I see that that fat fuck dude who got caught with the date rape drug warming

745
00:47:34.271 --> 00:47:37.690
up his leg and I know he can kick it from fucking Siberia.

746
00:47:37.691 --> 00:47:39.340
So items like this game's fucking over.

747
00:47:39.341 --> 00:47:42.370
It's going to go into OT and I shut the game off and I just,
I,

748
00:47:42.371 --> 00:47:45.940
I picked up the remote control and I just started fucking just,
just,

749
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:50.620
just slamming it methodically.

750
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:53.920
Like that fucking Slingblade guy.

751
00:47:53.921 --> 00:47:57.710
I'll write it down on Dwight Yoakam's fucking head.
Just,
just,

752
00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.650
I actually,
I got so fucking mad at a,

753
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:07.600
at a just courtesy to my girl.
I just,
I walked,

754
00:48:07.601 --> 00:48:11.200
I grabbed my phone,
I have fucking Hoodie and I just started walking,

755
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:15.280
started walking up the street like,
fuck,
I didn't know where I was going.

756
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:20.740
Rex fucking cock get fucking piece of shit.
Fucking vets.
No fucking way.

757
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:23.740
I'm gonna fuck you fucking call something.
That didn't even fucking happen.

758
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:29.170
I should be three Erwin fucking book people walking by with their pugs just

759
00:48:29.171 --> 00:48:32.110
staring at me.
I'm trying to act like I'm talking on my cell phone.

760
00:48:32.111 --> 00:48:35.740
I'm not talking to myself.
I'm talking to that fucking ref,

761
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:39.070
that piece.
Shit Ref.
I swear to God,

762
00:48:39.071 --> 00:48:41.680
if I was running the fucking league and at the end of the game,

763
00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:46.740
some fucking ref made a God damn call that that overtly affected the point

764
00:48:47.351 --> 00:48:50.740
spread and he made a call.
It didn't even fucking happen.

765
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:54.010
That son of a bitch would be in my office Monday fucking morning,

766
00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:58.600
I'd have his phone bill laying on the table,
his visa,
mastercard bills,

767
00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:01.180
his fucking passport,
all of his shit.

768
00:49:01.181 --> 00:49:03.940
And I would be looking at his life and I would figure out who the fuck this guy

769
00:49:03.941 --> 00:49:08.140
owes money to that you can make a a horseshit call like that.

770
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:12.970
All right,
I'm back.
And that's what happened to me.

771
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.990
I fucking walked up the hill is so God damn pissed.

772
00:49:14.991 --> 00:49:19.700
I started walking into the Goddamn hills,
walking up to the street and it took,

773
00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:22.390
the sun's going down,
right?

774
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:26.170
I get to the top of the Goddamn hill and I realize I'm right at the foot of this

775
00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:30.850
fucking park that has a bunch of God damn coyotes,
you know,

776
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.270
and I'm,
I'm not there.
I'm not there with my fucking pit bull.

777
00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.190
I don't have my security with me.

778
00:49:36.191 --> 00:49:38.410
And I'm just walking up there and then I was thinking like,
Jesus Christ,

779
00:49:38.411 --> 00:49:43.150
what if I get mauled to death
by a pack of coyotes?

780
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:47.810
That would be the dumbest death ever comedian,
Malta,

781
00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:52.120
death by coyotes because the chiefs didn't cover against the Raiders.

782
00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:57.370
And right there I was just like,
you know what?

783
00:49:57.371 --> 00:50:01.780
This gambling shit is the dumbest shit you can ever do to yourself.

784
00:50:01.781 --> 00:50:06.160
If you've never gambled,
don't do it.
Don't put money on a game.

785
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:10.720
It literally,
it ruins your football Sunday.

786
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:13.690
It fucking ruins it.
It's losing money on a game.

787
00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:18.100
I'm telling you is so much worse than just watching your team loose.

788
00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:21.340
You know,
your team loses,
they fucking lose,
but you still,

789
00:50:21.341 --> 00:50:25.900
you can still go out and go buy yourself a slice of pizza.
Right.
You know,

790
00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:30.110
maybe that key chain you had your eye on.
All right,
that's enough.

791
00:50:30.111 --> 00:50:34.780
That's enough with the sports this fucking week,
I believe.
Um,

792
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:38.390
so congratulations to the Co,
AH,
the Cleveland browns fans.

793
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:42.380
I'm actually in some weird way.
It's kind of hard cause you beat my team.

794
00:50:42.381 --> 00:50:47.180
I'm actually excited that you guys look like maybe you finally pick the right

795
00:50:47.181 --> 00:50:50.540
quarterback after years of,
you know,

796
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:55.250
the Cleveland browns assault,
kind of like the Chicago bears or the East,

797
00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:57.850
you know,
where they just,
I don't know,

798
00:50:57.851 --> 00:51:02.851
they always get that Cade mcdowney Tim couch or whatever the fuck his name or

799
00:51:03.091 --> 00:51:04.100
the always get that guy,

800
00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:09.830
that guy who was the fifth runner up Heisman trophy guy,
you know,

801
00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:13.580
and they did it again this year with Colt Mccoy and he,
he looked great.

802
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:18.980
He fucking look great.
Stepping up into the pocket,
ran one for a touchdown.

803
00:51:18.981 --> 00:51:21.380
He was fucking rolling out throwing the ball on the run.

804
00:51:21.381 --> 00:51:25.910
Like fucking Doug Flutie.
I Dunno,
whatever.

805
00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:29.600
What the fuck are you going to do?
God dammit,
we've got raped.

806
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:34.760
She got raped and Cleveland,
uh,
right next to the rock and roll hall of fame.

807
00:51:34.761 --> 00:51:36.770
Just to add insult to injury.

808
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:41.000
And then I got to get all these emails from these jets fans.
You know,

809
00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:46.190
they were all laying in the fucking weeds,
just waiting for the Patriots to lose.

810
00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:48.410
You know,

811
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:51.770
I was amazed at how quickly I got the emails from them considering they had to

812
00:51:51.771 --> 00:51:55.820
clean four quarters in one OT of shit out of their pants.

813
00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:03.200
Um,
if you are going to,
if you are going to gamble,
I got to tell you,

814
00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:07.130
I met the cat might be out of the bag,
but there's a,

815
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:12.140
I love teams right now like Cleveland,
the lions.

816
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:17.750
Um,
who else?
There's was one other one.
The rams.

817
00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:22.940
If those teams are on the road and they're getting any sort of sizeable points,

818
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:24.171
uh,

819
00:52:24.171 --> 00:52:29.171
I would go with those guys just because they have competitive fucking teams.

820
00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.420
Like,
uh,
they just,

821
00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:36.120
Brian's had a great fucking draft and they keep,

822
00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:39.140
they keep being like fucking five point underdogs and that type of shit.

823
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:44.000
I don't know.
Then they blow it in the fucking,
and that's the only thing.

824
00:52:44.001 --> 00:52:46.910
Cause if they let up a touchdown,
then you loo ads all fucking fixed.

825
00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:51.110
How could it not be fixed?
How do you know?
How do they pick the,
the,

826
00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:54.830
the perfect fucking number,
every God damn week.
How do they do that?

827
00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:57.860
You know,
if it's so fucking hard for me,

828
00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:00.890
I don't get it.

829
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:05.150
Like literally be like if I picked one game a week,

830
00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:08.870
I should have a 50 50 chance of winning it.
Right.
And after 16,

831
00:53:08.871 --> 00:53:11.690
17 weeks with the buy,
I should be,
you know,

832
00:53:11.691 --> 00:53:14.540
501 game I'll over one game under,
right.

833
00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:17.090
I should be nine and eight or eight and nine and it never works out that way.

834
00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:21.600
Somehow you,
you lose like 60% of the fucking time.
I don't get it there.

835
00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:23.990
Any mathematicians out there that can fucking help me out.

836
00:53:23.991 --> 00:53:26.970
I'm all God damn years.
That piece of Shit fucking rough.

837
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:28.860
This is what happens too.
When you gamble,

838
00:53:28.861 --> 00:53:32.700
then you start fucking no in the names of referees and that's when you have a

839
00:53:32.701 --> 00:53:36.420
fucking problem.
You start knowing the names of backup punters.

840
00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.240
I guess some people know that shit nowadays.

841
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:43.680
Those fantasy football playing people did that got him on my fantasy team.

842
00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:48.330
Um,
what the fuck are my questions for the week?
All right.

843
00:53:48.331 --> 00:53:51.960
That was 20 minutes of sports.
I really good.
Let's,
let's talk politan.
Let's talk,

844
00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:56.850
let's talk politics.
The elections where this past week,

845
00:53:56.851 --> 00:53:58.110
where are you guys excited?

846
00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:02.130
Are you excited that we took the country back?

847
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:09.540
How many times are we going to do that in these elections?
You know,

848
00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:10.890
like two years ago,

849
00:54:10.891 --> 00:54:15.060
I remember everything was the Republican's fault and then they vote in all

850
00:54:15.061 --> 00:54:19.830
democrats and people like,
yeah,
we took the country back,
right?

851
00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.250
Two years,
fucking later,

852
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:26.400
they vote in all Republicans and they say the exact same fucking thing.

853
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:30.330
This is the theme this week is that everything is fucking rigged.

854
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:34.200
You can't tell me you,
you can't.
You don't notice

855
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:39.480
that no matter who you put in now it doesn't really make a difference at this

856
00:54:39.481 --> 00:54:42.600
sort of,
this,
this common,
the tone,
this,
the same line.

857
00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:46.890
Anybody,
anybody noticed that?

858
00:54:46.891 --> 00:54:49.890
None of them are talking about bankers and how they took $1 trillion.

859
00:54:49.891 --> 00:54:53.280
No one's talking about that and just kept the shit.
No one's talking about that.

860
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.210
No one's talking about,
uh,

861
00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:58.560
how all these companies have fucking taken all the manufacturing out of this

862
00:54:58.561 --> 00:55:00.480
country.
We probably need to reverse NAFTA.

863
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:02.280
They'd probably be a good fucking idea.

864
00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:05.810
No one's talking about that Democrat or Republican,
the Algebra,

865
00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:08.490
I think it's time to get this God fee back to work.

866
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:13.560
Everybody starts screaming like something's going to fucking happen.
You know,

867
00:55:13.561 --> 00:55:17.300
Federal Reserve just printed another $600 million out of thin fucking air and is

868
00:55:17.301 --> 00:55:22.080
buying up bonds.
It's,
nobody's didn't,
nobody's talking about that shit.

869
00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:23.310
Nothing,
nothing.

870
00:55:23.311 --> 00:55:26.580
All they're talking about is fucking family values and getting people back to

871
00:55:26.581 --> 00:55:31.020
work and a hard working Americans and all this lip service,
you know,

872
00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:34.350
and then people vote Democrat and Republican,
right?
Which is,

873
00:55:34.351 --> 00:55:37.870
you're fucking right.
But then whenever I tell him I voted for,
uh,

874
00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:41.730
somebody outside those two parties who actually says,
hey,

875
00:55:41.731 --> 00:55:43.410
why don't we audit the Federal Reserve?

876
00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:47.640
Why don't we figure out why they're a private corporation yet somehow print the

877
00:55:47.641 --> 00:55:51.420
money for this country.
They always tell me that that's a waste of a vote.

878
00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:56.940
So then you vote for fucking,
I don't get it.

879
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.260
I really don't fucking get it.
So I don't give a shit.

880
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:03.350
This whole country's going down the fucking shit.

881
00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:06.570
Everybody's just sitting there yelling at each other,

882
00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:11.310
fucking tea party screaming at people.

883
00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:13.650
I fucking give it thought,
you know,

884
00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:18.740
I just find the whole thing unbelievably fucking a depressing.

885
00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:25.820
I think the world is run by sociopath's and who manipulate morons.

886
00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:27.993
You know,

887
00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:33.120
you got this whole sea of morons could fill up the Pacific Ocean with the amount

888
00:56:33.371 --> 00:56:35.140
of morons,
you know,

889
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.770
tell me what to thank those people and then the sociopath.

890
00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:43.090
Tell them what to think and whoever's the best at telling them what to think

891
00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:47.410
wins.
Gi Bill.
That was fucking deep.
I know.

892
00:56:47.411 --> 00:56:50.110
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking above.
You know what it is?

893
00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:54.010
I just like the people who,
uh,

894
00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:57.130
I don't know.
I got my immune to explain it.

895
00:56:57.131 --> 00:56:59.740
I just slides just like people who just go,
this,
this is bullshit.

896
00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:02.410
This is fucking fixed.
I like those guys.

897
00:57:03.790 --> 00:57:08.590
I don't like people who go,
uh,
you know,
you know who were the Jesus,

898
00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:11.051
you know what?

899
00:57:11.051 --> 00:57:13.930
This podcast went off the fucking rails at least three minutes ago.

900
00:57:13.931 --> 00:57:14.711
I don't even want to say,
you know what?

901
00:57:14.711 --> 00:57:18.220
I'm so fucking stupid that I don't even realize that I'm one of those morons in

902
00:57:18.221 --> 00:57:19.060
the Pacific Ocean,

903
00:57:19.061 --> 00:57:22.930
that Herei am trying to have this deep fucking thought about politics.

904
00:57:22.931 --> 00:57:26.020
And I don't even have the fucking wherewithal,
the brainpower

905
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:31.120
to even convey my own thoughts.
So with that,

906
00:57:31.121 --> 00:57:34.180
let's go with the obscure sports stat of the week.
This is a new,

907
00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:38.290
this is for all the,
the,
the sports nerds out there.
Uh,

908
00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:43.150
this is the obscure sports stat of the week.
This is a new segment.
All right?

909
00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:46.270
This is something I didn't realize is how much,
um,

910
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:50.620
teams from Massachusetts from Boston have dominated St Louis.

911
00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:55.440
Here's the,
this,
I was in Saint Louis two weeks ago and a,
somebody hit me,

912
00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:57.280
hit me with this stat.
All right,
well,

913
00:57:57.281 --> 00:58:02.140
the last time the St Louis Cardinals,
uh,

914
00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:05.290
lost a world series they lost to the Boston red sox.

915
00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:10.580
The last time the city of St Louis lost the Superbowl.

916
00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:12.550
They lost the New England patriots.

917
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:17.260
The last time the city is St Louis lost to Stanley Cup finals game.

918
00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:19.990
They lost to the Boston Bruins.

919
00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:26.400
Add the most obscure of obscure the last time St Louis lost an NBA finals in

920
00:58:29.231 --> 00:58:34.000
1960 61 the St Louis Hawks lost to the Boston Celtics.

921
00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.800
We fucking own you guys.
St Louis.
You hear me?

922
00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:44.440
We've owned you sent 60,
61 and what have you done about it?
Nothing.

923
00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:49.300
I'm all right.
I'm bored shitless with sports too.
Let's,
let's move on here.

924
00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:53.380
What do we got here?
Oh,
last week I asked you guys,

925
00:58:53.381 --> 00:58:56.560
you know I was talking about that woman who kept clearing her throat in a really

926
00:58:56.561 --> 00:58:59.800
annoying way behind me on the plane.

927
00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:02.770
And I presented this question to you.
I said,

928
00:59:02.771 --> 00:59:07.660
what would happen if the most interesting man in the world met the most annoying

929
00:59:07.661 --> 00:59:10.240
woman on the planet?
What would happen?

930
00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:13.720
And I asked you guys for your theories and I got a bunch of them and I'm going

931
00:59:13.721 --> 00:59:17.230
to try to read them now and not fuck it up.
Um,

932
00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:20.560
this is what people had to say without saying a word.

933
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:26.410
He can make even the biggest con shut up and do the fucking dishes because he is

934
00:59:26.661 --> 00:59:28.220
the most interesting man in the world.

935
00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:35.840
All right.
That's story number one.
Theory number two,
most entering,

936
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:40.930
most interesting man plus contiguous woman equals most miserable man.

937
00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:44.510
That's pretty much at bill.
Uh,

938
00:59:44.511 --> 00:59:48.860
that is if your question implied in inherent and attraction between the two,

939
00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:53.120
if it's just like a chance encounter,
like at a party or something like that,

940
00:59:53.121 --> 00:59:57.230
the most interesting man would probably just say it's such an annoying cunt and

941
00:59:57.231 --> 00:59:59.090
he'd be on his merry way.
However,

942
00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:02.390
if the two decided to form a relationship,

943
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:07.340
the most annoying woman would just siphon everything interesting away from the

944
01:00:07.341 --> 01:00:12.341
most interesting man chiseling him down to a being that could equate her level

945
01:00:12.561 --> 01:00:17.030
of unjustifiable existence.
And then he writes,
wow,
that's depressing.

946
01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:20.810
Uh,
someone should advertise some PSA or something.

947
01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.600
There is no shame in a harrowing hunt.

948
01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:28.810
So please do not settle for an annoying country brought to you by the people who

949
01:00:29.331 --> 01:00:33.110
hate cunty throat clearers allocated to their immediate airspace.

950
01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:38.390
Um,
all right,
let's move on with the youtube videos for the week.

951
01:00:38.391 --> 01:00:40.850
I'm going to blow through some topics here just for some people cause I really,

952
01:00:40.851 --> 01:00:43.640
I got to,
I got to tone down the sports on this fucking thing.

953
01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:46.540
It's just becoming the fucking,
uh,

954
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:51.350
beer and wings podcast here,
a youtube,

955
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:57.890
youtube videos of the week.
Uh,
look at garbage day original.

956
01:00:58.610 --> 01:00:59.421
All these,
by the way,

957
01:00:59.421 --> 01:01:03.830
we'll be up in the MM podcast.com look at garbage day original.

958
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:06.530
And this one right here,
this one is from me.

959
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:11.600
And I think this is one of the greatest fucking lines ever uttered in,

960
01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:15.660
uh,
in movies ever.

961
01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:19.940
Certainly in any sort of teen movie that was a,

962
01:01:19.941 --> 01:01:23.480
that's about teens rebelling.
This movie's called over the edge.

963
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:26.720
I believe it came out in 1979.
Oh yeah,
this was over the edge.

964
01:01:26.721 --> 01:01:31.700
1979 part nine.
And,
uh,

965
01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:35.030
and just looking at that and you know,

966
01:01:35.031 --> 01:01:36.860
I also started off with revenge of the nerds.

967
01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:40.940
That speech on this podcast that kind of made me just think of some classic

968
01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:44.980
movies could embed.
Uh,

969
01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:49.370
here's ALP look up Al Pachino,
a great ass extended version.

970
01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:51.613
Um,

971
01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:57.710
one of the greatest actors of all time with one of the worst performances I've

972
01:01:57.711 --> 01:02:01.820
ever seen in my life.
And,
uh,
what else do I got?

973
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:05.120
Incident at subway.
Check that one out.

974
01:02:05.121 --> 01:02:10.121
Some kid at subway wants to fight somebody behind the counter at Jesus on,

975
01:02:10.601 --> 01:02:15.170
I know what's going on.
Um,
Nino.
Uh,

976
01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:21.360
what else?
Underrated.
Overrated.
What happened to this podcast?

977
01:02:21.361 --> 01:02:23.970
Something at 22 minutes happen at this podcast.
You know what it is.

978
01:02:23.971 --> 01:02:24.840
As I went outside,

979
01:02:24.850 --> 01:02:28.620
I'm still wearing my fucking hooded sweatshirt and I think I'm getting too

980
01:02:28.621 --> 01:02:31.170
fucking hot and it's siphoning all the god damn funny up.

981
01:02:31.171 --> 01:02:34.140
But now I can't take it off because they had my fucking headphones on.

982
01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:36.840
So I gotta lay the microphone down as they slowly take this.

983
01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:43.860
All right,
here we go.
Now I'm ready.
Oh,

984
01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:44.790
I remember what I was going to do.

985
01:02:44.791 --> 01:02:49.470
I was going to tell you guys the story this week.
I did this awesome,

986
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:53.430
unbelievable fucking Gig.
Um,
it was,
uh,

987
01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:57.330
the Bob Woodruff Fund,
whatever he called,
uh,

988
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:59.700
uh,
Jesus Christ.

989
01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:02.010
I really thought that this story was going to get the podcast go.
And again,

990
01:03:02.011 --> 01:03:03.180
what the fuck was it called?

991
01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.830
The Bob Woodward f a charity fund auction thing.

992
01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.040
Bob Woodward was a reporter.
Uh,
he was in Iraq.

993
01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:14.820
He got hit by a roadside bomb,
made a miraculous recovery.

994
01:03:14.821 --> 01:03:18.900
And this is the fourth annual one where they raise money for his foundation.

995
01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:23.930
That's the word I was looking for his fucking foundation to raise money for it,

996
01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:27.060
for,
uh,
you know,

997
01:03:27.061 --> 01:03:29.190
for troops who have been injured in battle and that type of thing.

998
01:03:29.191 --> 01:03:32.190
Just one of those,
those,
those charities,
you just cannot say no to.

999
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:34.350
You have to do it.
And,
uh,

1000
01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:38.490
it was all the way back in New York City at the Beacon Theater,
uh,

1001
01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:39.840
for music fans out there.

1002
01:03:39.841 --> 01:03:43.230
They know that the Allman brothers had been doing the beacon run for like the

1003
01:03:43.231 --> 01:03:45.270
last 30 fucking years.

1004
01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.710
So already I'm thrilled to be there just because I'm gonna be standing on the

1005
01:03:49.711 --> 01:03:53.370
same stage as Duane almonds.
And,
uh,

1006
01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:55.890
and I showed up in the,

1007
01:03:55.891 --> 01:03:59.730
in the lineup that I went on was the most insane lineup I've ever been on.

1008
01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:05.580
Um,
in my career.
This was the lineup.
All right.

1009
01:04:05.581 --> 01:04:08.070
Max Weinberg was there and he put together this big band,

1010
01:04:08.071 --> 01:04:11.670
so they're out there fucking killing it.
Jon Stewart was the host.

1011
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:16.830
He goes out and he kills it.
Talking about politics in a very funny way,

1012
01:04:16.831 --> 01:04:21.030
unlike the Horse Shit that I did on my podcast,
a,
he fucking kills it.

1013
01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:25.860
Then he brings out Tony Bennett.
Tony fucking Bennet,

1014
01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:28.740
who sings two songs,
absolutely kills it,

1015
01:04:28.741 --> 01:04:32.640
sounds as good as he did 40 50 years ago.
Just kills it.

1016
01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.840
Then they bring out John Stewart comes back out,
does some more jokes,

1017
01:04:36.841 --> 01:04:39.480
kills again.
Then he brings out Bruce Springsteen.

1018
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:45.710
Fucking Bruce Springsteen goes out there and just fucking owns the stage,

1019
01:04:45.901 --> 01:04:50.310
sliding around,
jumping up on the piano,
tells and telling jokes,

1020
01:04:50.311 --> 01:04:54.240
just just fucking kills it.
Uh,
then they had an auction,

1021
01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.980
at least fucking rich people's played like 150 grand for one of Bruce

1022
01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:03.420
Springsteen's guitars,
raised all this money.
Then the second half of the show,

1023
01:05:03.421 --> 01:05:08.421
they bring out Joel Mchale who had to go on after Tony Bennett and fucking Bruce

1024
01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:10.500
Springsteen,
and he still somehow killed it.

1025
01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:15.150
Then I went up and then the final act of the evening was Jerry Seinfeld.
Well,

1026
01:05:15.151 --> 01:05:18.970
it's the do Jerry fucking Seinfeld,
the king,

1027
01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:20.980
the master,
right.

1028
01:05:20.981 --> 01:05:25.981
And I'm on stage when I went out there and my whole nervousness of the night was

1029
01:05:26.921 --> 01:05:31.921
not going on after those people was my nervousness was the fact that nobody had

1030
01:05:32.201 --> 01:05:36.250
said fuck yet.
And it was a benefit,
you know,

1031
01:05:36.251 --> 01:05:39.640
and people talking about tragedy and I was going to go out there and my opening

1032
01:05:39.641 --> 01:05:42.250
bit was talking about,
you know,
hitting women.

1033
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:46.290
So I'm backstage just like mind fucking myself going,
Oh God,

1034
01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.370
going to be too harsh.
I shouldn't curse.

1035
01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:51.340
Jerry's going to get mad at me the second I curse.

1036
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:54.850
He's gonna look at me like I'm not even a comedian,
you know,

1037
01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:59.260
and I so badly want his fucking approval,
you know?

1038
01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:04.550
So I'm sitting there freaking out.
Finally,
my agent just goes,
dude,
Geez.

1039
01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:08.350
See what Springsteen just did?
He went out,
he just does what he does,

1040
01:06:08.351 --> 01:06:12.130
jumps on pianos.
Just go out there and do what the fuck you do.
I was like,

1041
01:06:12.131 --> 01:06:16.510
you know what?
You're right.
You're right.
So I went out there and I,
I definitely,

1042
01:06:16.511 --> 01:06:19.690
I didn't say fuck as much as I usually did,
but I went out there,

1043
01:06:19.691 --> 01:06:24.400
I did my getting hit by women,
uh,
hitting women,
all that type of shit,

1044
01:06:24.401 --> 01:06:27.880
a fucking killed.
And when I get off stage,

1045
01:06:27.881 --> 01:06:30.490
I'm walking and cherries going on next.

1046
01:06:30.491 --> 01:06:35.350
So I'm walking off the stage and there he is fucking Seinfeld

1047
01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:38.620
who at this point it's,
it's like,

1048
01:06:38.621 --> 01:06:42.850
it's like looking at Elvis Goddamn icon is standing there and his suit just

1049
01:06:42.851 --> 01:06:45.460
ready to go to work.
And I walked by him.
I'm just,

1050
01:06:45.461 --> 01:06:50.080
I'm just wincing waiting from just completely blow me off or just be like,

1051
01:06:50.081 --> 01:06:53.320
why did you say fuck so much?
You know?

1052
01:06:53.321 --> 01:06:58.321
And I walked by him and he fucking sticks his hand out and he just goes really

1053
01:06:58.631 --> 01:07:03.400
funny stuff.
Really,
really funny stuff.
And I was just like,

1054
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:04.510
oh,
thanks a lot.
You know,

1055
01:07:04.570 --> 01:07:08.440
I try not to curse so much out of respect for you going on,
going on next.

1056
01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:09.580
And he goes,
well I don't care.

1057
01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:14.350
Then it felt like an idiot.

1058
01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:17.860
I'm sitting in and I'll nervous like a little schoolgirl now.
Just realize like,

1059
01:07:17.861 --> 01:07:20.920
wait a minute,
Jerry has always worked totally fucking clean.

1060
01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:25.720
He came up in the late seventies,
right through the 80s with all these,

1061
01:07:25.721 --> 01:07:28.300
these barroom hack comics doing blow.

1062
01:07:28.301 --> 01:07:33.010
I mean the amount of shit that that guy had to go on after working squeaky

1063
01:07:33.011 --> 01:07:37.660
fucking clean.
He can't follow me.
Well what the hell was I thinking?

1064
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:39.520
And now I'm thinking he couldn't follow me.
I didn't think of that.

1065
01:07:39.521 --> 01:07:43.570
He would be annoyed and a then I stood there,
you know,

1066
01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:47.290
like feeling like I was 90 miles in the air because he said that he thought that

1067
01:07:47.291 --> 01:07:49.300
I was funny or that I had good stuff.

1068
01:07:49.301 --> 01:07:53.940
And then I watched him go out there and it just absolute,
uh,

1069
01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:58.690
not to bring up sports again,
but I guess I have to,
you know,

1070
01:07:58.691 --> 01:08:01.520
any port in a fucking storm here,
it was like watching a,

1071
01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:05.980
you don't want somebody who's just,
just has the,
they're just the perfect swing.

1072
01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.670
Perfect jumpshot,
their form or whatever that that's what it was like.

1073
01:08:09.671 --> 01:08:12.550
There was just everything that he did,
there wasn't one wasted word.

1074
01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:17.510
One wasted movement.
Everything.
Okay,
you want to talk moves,

1075
01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:19.550
it's like toy story.
You go to see toy story.

1076
01:08:19.551 --> 01:08:22.700
It's like every line in the movie just propels the thing forward.

1077
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:28.070
There's not a line of fat in that fucking script and it's just just like his act

1078
01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:32.300
and he goes out there and just,
just absolutely fucking destroyed.

1079
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:35.540
And uh,
it was awesome.

1080
01:08:35.541 --> 01:08:38.420
The all the other night that I had that ever compared to,

1081
01:08:38.421 --> 01:08:42.100
that was one night I was down at the comedy cellar in the,
uh,

1082
01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:45.800
in the village in New York City.
And,
um,

1083
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:51.130
that's the club where if you want to see if go out and see great comedy or if

1084
01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:53.300
you want to see a,

1085
01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:58.750
possibly somebody super famous that's a comedian,

1086
01:08:59.150 --> 01:09:01.850
just drop in and do a set.
That's where I would go.

1087
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:04.190
And it used to happen all the time.

1088
01:09:04.191 --> 01:09:08.630
And One night I was down the cellar and uh,

1089
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:12.140
give me name and a lot of names here,
but I never named names of the podcast,

1090
01:09:12.141 --> 01:09:13.550
but there's nothing bad about this story.

1091
01:09:13.551 --> 01:09:17.480
So Godfrey was hosting the show and um,

1092
01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:23.960
you know,
I was supposed to,
I think,
I think it was me,
I was going on next.
But,

1093
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:26.630
uh,
all of a sudden,
you know,

1094
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:30.410
I can't really tell this story without saying the names.

1095
01:09:30.411 --> 01:09:33.320
This is basically imagine you sitting in the fucking crowd.
All right?

1096
01:09:33.321 --> 01:09:37.910
You just seeing no name hacks like me going up and all of a sudden the host
goes,

1097
01:09:37.911 --> 01:09:39.380
uh,
hey everybody.

1098
01:09:39.381 --> 01:09:43.940
We've got a very special guest that just dropped by wanting to do like five

1099
01:09:43.941 --> 01:09:47.510
minutes.
You might recognize this guy from the hit TV show.

1100
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:48.740
Everybody loves Raymond.

1101
01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:53.540
Please welcome Ray Romano and ray walks on stage and the crowd goes fucking
nuts.

1102
01:09:53.541 --> 01:09:56.950
Holy Fuck Ray Romano,
right?
And um,

1103
01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:00.020
as he's on stage,

1104
01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:04.910
Seinfeld and Chris rock show up and they also want to go on,

1105
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:08.540
all right,
this has happened once in 20 years of me doing stand up.

1106
01:10:08.541 --> 01:10:11.510
This was the most unbelievable night,
right?
So they go downstairs,

1107
01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:12.710
Ray Romano finishes.

1108
01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:18.640
So Godfrey goes back up and he kept doing these great intros that was making the

1109
01:10:19.761 --> 01:10:22.340
crowd lose his shit.
He goes,
keep going through your mind.
He goes,
all right,

1110
01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:24.830
we got another special guest just dropped in.

1111
01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:28.280
You might recognize this guy from the Chris rock show,

1112
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:32.750
please welcome Chris Rock.
And then the fucking place standing ovation.

1113
01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:37.430
Holy Fuck.
We got fucking Ray Romano and Chris Rock.

1114
01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:41.370
And now at this point,
every comic knows that Seinfeld is waiting in the wing.

1115
01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:45.740
So we're all standing there huddled down in the little hallway waiting to watch

1116
01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:49.940
this crowd lose.
It's fucking shit like those soccer moms on fucking Oprah,
right?

1117
01:10:50.210 --> 01:10:54.110
Chris rock kills it.
Godfrey goes up,
Chris Rock,

1118
01:10:54.111 --> 01:10:58.640
everybody crown is like out of breath from fucking laughing.
And then he goes,

1119
01:10:58.641 --> 01:11:02.840
uh,
we had another guest dropped by at this point.
People just like,
what the fuck?

1120
01:11:02.841 --> 01:11:07.610
Right?
He goes,
you might recognize this next guy from the hit TV show Seinfeld.

1121
01:11:07.611 --> 01:11:12.470
And I hear this guy go no fucking way out.
And he goes,

1122
01:11:12.471 --> 01:11:16.410
please Jerry Seinfeld.
And like half the crowd almost fainted.

1123
01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:21.930
He goes up and just fucking destroyed.
And like people,

1124
01:11:21.931 --> 01:11:23.400
I like elated.
They had like,

1125
01:11:23.401 --> 01:11:27.240
like when he's done the everybody's faces just like in pain from grilling.

1126
01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:31.140
And from,
from,
from grinning.
I swear to God,
this is true story,
right?

1127
01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:36.060
So Seinfeld ends and he goes,
I keep it going for Jerry Seinfeld.
He goes,

1128
01:11:36.061 --> 01:11:40.620
all right,
you guys ready for more?
Show the crowds like flipping out.

1129
01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:41.611
And they go,
okay,

1130
01:11:41.611 --> 01:11:45.420
this next comedian and the crowd at this point is so goddamn spoiled.

1131
01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:49.800
I'm standing there in the doorway waiting to go on and everybody is trying to

1132
01:11:49.801 --> 01:11:54.360
look around my head for somebody famous to come on and he's bringing up me.

1133
01:11:55.380 --> 01:12:00.240
He goes,
please,
you know,
you might've seen him on a VH ones.
I love the eighties

1134
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:06.480
MTVs apartment two F please welcome bill burn.

1135
01:12:06.481 --> 01:12:10.030
I went on stage and there was just,
there was,
uh,

1136
01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:16.080
a noticeable sense of disappointment at that point when I walked up to the mic

1137
01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:20.790
and the only way I got out of it was I just addressed it.
I was like,

1138
01:12:20.791 --> 01:12:24.000
that's right.
Welcome back to reality.
This is what the fuck you paid for.

1139
01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:26.520
And then everybody laughed and like,
all right,
he addressed it.

1140
01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:29.190
He addressed the fact that we're disappointed to see him.

1141
01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:33.000
And at that point they kind of went along for the ride.
And I swear to God,

1142
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:37.170
an hour later,
Dave Chappelle went up and he went up and that was a

1143
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:42.470
boat.
So that night and the night I just did with a two,

1144
01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:47.040
two most unreal nights that I've ever seen in a,
in standup comedy.

1145
01:12:47.041 --> 01:12:50.580
I swear to God,
that seller story,
I know it sounds like some bullshit.

1146
01:12:50.581 --> 01:12:53.730
I swear to God it's fucking true.
Um,

1147
01:12:54.650 --> 01:12:56.580
and I don't know why I'm thinking that you're doubting it.

1148
01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:00.570
So if you ever go to New York City and you just want to go out and check out

1149
01:13:00.571 --> 01:13:04.490
some fucking comics,
go to the comedy cellar right down on

1150
01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.160
West third and Mcdougal,
right?

1151
01:13:08.190 --> 01:13:13.190
I've said that like 9 million times in my life flagging down a cab back in the

1152
01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:15.600
day when you could do eight sets on the weekend every night,

1153
01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:19.440
flagging down the cab with your spot money.

1154
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:25.320
Take me to west third and Mcdougal.
Do you want me to think the highway?
No.

1155
01:13:25.321 --> 01:13:29.590
You fucking asshole.
It's going to cost me an extra $7.
Okay.

1156
01:13:29.591 --> 01:13:32.310
It was a lot of traffic.
All right.

1157
01:13:32.311 --> 01:13:36.900
You Dick fucking take the other one.
You son of a bitch.
What do I care?

1158
01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.071
What do I care?

1159
01:13:38.071 --> 01:13:42.450
Someday I'll have my own podcast and I'll be selling ringtones at 99 cents a

1160
01:13:42.451 --> 01:13:46.950
whack.
Just raking in the fucking money.
I'm all right.

1161
01:13:46.951 --> 01:13:51.270
Let's get to underrated.
Overrated for this week.
Um,
all right.

1162
01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:56.130
This first underrated overrated that I'm going to read is a,
this goes,

1163
01:13:56.310 --> 01:14:01.080
this transcends the topic of underrated.
Overrated.

1164
01:14:01.081 --> 01:14:05.400
Because what you written,
not only did he get to hear this person's underrated,

1165
01:14:05.401 --> 01:14:06.234
overrated.

1166
01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:11.330
You get to see why having a tragic a childhood and,

1167
01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:18.070
okay.
I Dunno.
I Dunno what,
uh,
yeah,

1168
01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:21.660
basically that lead you to be fucking hilarious because

1169
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:25.130
all right,
I'm going to just read this shit.
This is,

1170
01:14:25.131 --> 01:14:27.890
this is from the same fucking person.
All right.
Underrated.

1171
01:14:27.891 --> 01:14:31.340
Your new girlfriend being hotter than your ex girlfriend.

1172
01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:37.210
Uh,
that first face to face meeting between them is priceless.

1173
01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:41.410
That's right.
She's hotter and skinnier than you enjoy the,

1174
01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.470
the eating disorder.
You can't.

1175
01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.560
So right off the bat you'd think it,
wow,
that's kinda harsh.
The fuck.

1176
01:14:50.010 --> 01:14:54.240
Where does that come from?
You learn where this comes from and is overrated.

1177
01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:57.810
Overrated.
Your Dad telling you he loves you.

1178
01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:01.830
I heard you fag.
I'm not saying it back now.

1179
01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:05.430
Tell that fat bitch you left mom for to get me a fresh beer.

1180
01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:11.550
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1181
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:15.060
<v 4>I'm going to tell you right now,
if this dude ever did stand up,</v>

1182
01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:19.740
he would be the guy that the comedians hang in the back of the club watching on

1183
01:15:19.741 --> 01:15:22.050
stage is the crowds groaning,

1184
01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:26.580
laughing their fucking ass off because they're relating to everything that he's

1185
01:15:26.581 --> 01:15:31.120
saying.
Those are the two classics.
Those are two fucking classics right there.

1186
01:15:31.930 --> 01:15:34.840
Um,
I heard you the first time.
Fag.
I'm not saying it right.

1187
01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:42.500
Just completely walled off with the emotions.
Ah,
that's fucking great.

1188
01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:47.450
That's a funny guy right there.
You already know it.
You know it.
Anyways,
um,

1189
01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:51.250
underrated modern horror movies.
Um,

1190
01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:52.880
being that it was Halloween last week,

1191
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:57.910
every channel had a horror movie marathon of some sorts and I watched some of

1192
01:15:58.201 --> 01:16:02.360
them.
What happened to horror films?
They used to be scary.
MMM.

1193
01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:04.720
It might be that I have grown up,

1194
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:08.710
but I think the real problem is that they spend most of their time trying to

1195
01:16:08.711 --> 01:16:12.580
grow out the audience.
Have you actually seen the movie saw?

1196
01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:17.100
Um,
the first one was good,
but after that they just try to make you throw up.

1197
01:16:18.450 --> 01:16:18.871
I mean,

1198
01:16:18.871 --> 01:16:23.100
does the movie really need a two minute sequence of a guy being injected with

1199
01:16:23.101 --> 01:16:25.570
acid and melting that that really happened?

1200
01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:27.800
That's kind of why I stopped watching it.

1201
01:16:27.801 --> 01:16:30.560
I saw the first song and I thought it was interesting and I started to watch the

1202
01:16:30.561 --> 01:16:35.550
second one and I'm like,
this is just gross.
This isn't really a scary,

1203
01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:41.570
it's like a,
it's like scary.
Like no,
it's like,

1204
01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:46.380
and even grosser jackass.
Right?
Does that make any sense?
Af,

1205
01:16:46.450 --> 01:16:50.650
let me just keep reading this.
God Damn,
why am I trying this week?
Um,
anyways,

1206
01:16:50.651 --> 01:16:53.530
he goes on to say it would be okay if they were unpredictable,

1207
01:16:53.531 --> 01:16:56.800
but they always make the killer the most obvious choice choice,

1208
01:16:57.330 --> 01:17:00.860
which just makes it obvious.
Did that make sense?
Yes,
it did.

1209
01:17:00.861 --> 01:17:05.710
Why did you lose confidence in the end?
Okay.
MMM.
No,
I totally agree with you.

1210
01:17:05.711 --> 01:17:09.890
I think the problem with a lot of movies,
both action movies and horror movies,

1211
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:15.080
is that the special effects are so unbelievable now that that's what they focus

1212
01:17:15.081 --> 01:17:17.660
on.
This happens,
this happens,
this happens.

1213
01:17:17.661 --> 01:17:21.710
And then the fucking special effects that they don't build any suspense,

1214
01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:23.660
you know,

1215
01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:26.810
and they don't really build the characters where you give a shit about them and

1216
01:17:26.811 --> 01:17:27.980
you're rooting for them.
The model,

1217
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:30.980
I just like mentally tap out of most of them and I'm like,
well,

1218
01:17:30.981 --> 01:17:33.440
this guy's the lead,
so there's no way he's going to die,
rust.

1219
01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:36.950
The movie would be over.
So what's the fucking point of this?

1220
01:17:36.951 --> 01:17:41.090
And like I always bring it back to a perfect storm.
Like I could give a shit,

1221
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:43.790
you know,
by the time they got to the wave,

1222
01:17:43.791 --> 01:17:48.350
I was like rooting for the wave because I,
I didn't care about their,

1223
01:17:48.351 --> 01:17:53.351
their pathetic attempt to try to bring some nobility to these guys who went

1224
01:17:53.841 --> 01:17:57.920
fishing.
They just so gloss over glossed over the whole fucking thing I had,

1225
01:17:57.930 --> 01:18:02.000
I didn't even give a shit.
So I would agree with you,
sir.
Um,

1226
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:07.940
what else do we got here?
A underrated cane sugar.
Seriously.

1227
01:18:07.941 --> 01:18:12.260
So much better than that.
High fructose crap.
Pepsi throwback is awesome.

1228
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:13.280
You know what?

1229
01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:16.220
I'm going to try it just because you said that and I'm not even a big soda guy.

1230
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.810
I'm underrated going to a concert.
Most people I know have never been,

1231
01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:24.650
never had the full concert experience of going to see someone you love and

1232
01:18:24.651 --> 01:18:29.510
seeing them live on stage,
killing it and leaving,
uh,
leaving def,

1233
01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:33.320
sweaty,
tired,
bruised and loving every second of it.
Uh,

1234
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:37.760
you're probably facing the same problem with people going out to see stand up.

1235
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:41.540
Actually,
I've got to be at Mit.
I've been really lucky.
I've been lucky.

1236
01:18:41.541 --> 01:18:44.910
People have been coming out to my shows.
Uh,
but anyways,
he says,
uh,

1237
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:48.380
they think it's going to be the same thing as watching it on TV.

1238
01:18:48.381 --> 01:18:51.570
I remember the first time I saw you,
do you stand up?
Act?
Um,

1239
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:53.990
it was also the first time I'd ever seen a comedy show.

1240
01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:56.630
I'm paraphrasing because I don't know where I am in the sentence.

1241
01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:02.270
First time I ever saw a comic was you about four years ago and the live

1242
01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:04.610
experience of seeing someone who is good at their craft,

1243
01:19:04.611 --> 01:19:06.560
it's just so much better than,
than watching it on TV.

1244
01:19:06.561 --> 01:19:07.820
Well thank you very much sir.

1245
01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:11.270
And it's considering you just gave me a little bit of a pat on the back.

1246
01:19:11.271 --> 01:19:14.750
I want to thank you everybody who's gone out and is bought my DVD.

1247
01:19:14.751 --> 01:19:16.190
My DVD is killing it.

1248
01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:20.980
It's still last I checked still in the top 10 on iTunes.
Um,

1249
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:22.370
I can't thank you guys enough.

1250
01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:28.280
This one is selling even better than why do I do this sold and I'm all the

1251
01:19:28.281 --> 01:19:32.720
emails you guys are sending me about that extra 21 minutes of material that you

1252
01:19:32.721 --> 01:19:33.680
didn't get to see.

1253
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:38.600
Basically 25% of the special that you didn't get to see on comedy central.
Uh,

1254
01:19:38.601 --> 01:19:41.420
I read all of them.
I appreciate all the uh,

1255
01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.230
all the kinds of emails and all that type of shit.
It's nice.

1256
01:19:45.231 --> 01:19:49.700
It really offsets all the jet fans giving me shit to read.
A nice compliment.

1257
01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:54.560
Now a jet fans going to write.
I love the DVD and then I'm going to open it up.

1258
01:19:54.561 --> 01:19:57.530
Patriot suck.
I already know you're up to that.
What do you think?

1259
01:19:57.531 --> 01:20:02.300
I'm a fucking child.
Um,
but seriously and Christmas is coming up.

1260
01:20:02.301 --> 01:20:06.020
So keep buying those DVDs.
It's only like 10 bucks on amazon.com.

1261
01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:07.130
And as I stated before,

1262
01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:10.890
it makes a great stocking stuffer for someone you don't give a fuck about,

1263
01:20:11.010 --> 01:20:15.930
but half to buy a gift for.
Go Out,
bang out six of them for 60 bucks.

1264
01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:20.970
There you go.
Frisbee him around.
There you go.
You can't fuck you.
Dickhead Pussy,

1265
01:20:20.971 --> 01:20:25.050
whatever.
Up to six people.
You know

1266
01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:28.140
what happened just by the God damn thing.
Okay.

1267
01:20:28.141 --> 01:20:30.000
My ringtone was such a God damn flop.

1268
01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:33.870
People actually asking me to make another rink tone and I feel like a band

1269
01:20:33.871 --> 01:20:37.470
that's scratching their head why they haven't been dropped by their label yet.

1270
01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:38.993
Um,

1271
01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:43.860
which actually segues us into some of the questions for this week.

1272
01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:48.270
If I could find them.
Somebody actually asked me some drum questions.
So bill,

1273
01:20:48.271 --> 01:20:51.570
I got three questions for you after I heard your drum battle on youtube and you

1274
01:20:51.571 --> 01:20:53.790
didn't suck a,

1275
01:20:53.791 --> 01:20:58.791
you seem like a relatively good drummer and extremely good opinionator so I'd

1276
01:20:59.101 --> 01:21:02.700
like to ask your opinion on some drum things.
Uh,

1277
01:21:02.710 --> 01:21:06.030
what do you think are some of the hardest drum songs to play?

1278
01:21:07.050 --> 01:21:09.450
Well for me it would be just about all of them.

1279
01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:16.200
Uh,
I,
I,
uh,

1280
01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:21.590
the hardest ones I would say.
I would say as far as like for a look at,

1281
01:21:21.591 --> 01:21:24.390
I'm going to get actually get into this a little bit cause I really got hardcore

1282
01:21:24.391 --> 01:21:26.760
into sports,
you know,

1283
01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:30.360
not even remotely concerned about people who could give a shit about sports.

1284
01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:34.140
So I'll get into this a little bit.
For the musicians out there is,

1285
01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:39.170
I actually found one of the hardest things to do is to have the discipline to

1286
01:21:39.871 --> 01:21:41.070
just sit down

1287
01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:45.780
and try and make what I could physically play.

1288
01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:49.470
Actually sound good because I think one of the,

1289
01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:54.471
one of the big things when you're learning an instrument is when you physically

1290
01:21:55.471 --> 01:21:59.970
get something down,
you move on to the next thing.
You don't,

1291
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.170
you don't stay with it until you can actually make it sound good and make it

1292
01:22:04.171 --> 01:22:08.670
sound good to somebody listening to you play it.
You just,
okay,
I got that down.

1293
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.720
Bre,
Pam.
Okay,
now I'm gonna move on to the next fucking thing.
Rather than,

1294
01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:17.700
you know,
if you learn like a drum fill,
you just get the fill down and you,
yeah,

1295
01:22:17.701 --> 01:22:20.550
you play a couple of fucking beats and then you just throw it in.
Yeah,
yeah,

1296
01:22:20.551 --> 01:22:22.380
I got that down.
You don't really have it down.

1297
01:22:22.381 --> 01:22:25.930
So one of the hardest things for me was having a discipline.
Um,

1298
01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:30.940
and it was something I learned when I was watching Steve Jordan play drums and I

1299
01:22:31.081 --> 01:22:35.310
was listening to him play something and I was watching it going,

1300
01:22:35.370 --> 01:22:40.370
I can physically play what he's playing and what he's playing is actually really

1301
01:22:40.411 --> 01:22:42.600
simple,
but I could not make it sound.

1302
01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:46.230
1 million is good is he's making it sound right now.

1303
01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:51.440
Like he was playing a beat that would actually be considered lame if I played

1304
01:22:51.661 --> 01:22:55.050
it.
And the way he played it,

1305
01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:01.220
it sounded unbelievably fresh and it would make an entire arena just start

1306
01:23:02.011 --> 01:23:04.440
smiling and get into whatever song was being played.

1307
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:09.470
That was the fucking hardest thing is far as trying to get halfway decent at

1308
01:23:10.121 --> 01:23:14.590
drums for me.
But as far as,
uh,
just songs that are difficult,

1309
01:23:14.591 --> 01:23:16.120
any of the shit by John Bonham,

1310
01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:21.370
his footage just so God damn fast and you can catch up with speed,

1311
01:23:21.371 --> 01:23:24.280
but you just can't play it the way he fucking plays it.

1312
01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:27.280
And I've had unbelievable arguments about people like,
you know,

1313
01:23:27.281 --> 01:23:28.810
the coke and Pepsi argument with,

1314
01:23:28.811 --> 01:23:31.450
with White Rock drummers is who do you like better?

1315
01:23:31.451 --> 01:23:35.020
Bottom or Neil Peart this is way back in the day before all these,

1316
01:23:35.021 --> 01:23:37.420
these other kids came along and I just fucking killing it.

1317
01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:39.580
And I always pick bond them.
I didn't,

1318
01:23:39.581 --> 01:23:41.410
I didn't think Neil Peart was anywhere near him.

1319
01:23:41.770 --> 01:23:43.960
I thought Neil Peart was like a fucking technician.

1320
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:45.640
He played right on the beat and it was,

1321
01:23:45.641 --> 01:23:50.641
sounded very fucking robotic as opposed to John Bonam who could play once again,

1322
01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:55.390
the simplest fucking fill that I could physically do.

1323
01:23:55.391 --> 01:23:59.170
But could never play it the way he pleads.
Did they just did,

1324
01:23:59.171 --> 01:24:03.790
this is the fucking shit.
It's like watching a great actor.
You know what I mean?

1325
01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:04.661
Who,

1326
01:24:04.661 --> 01:24:08.350
who could just take like a really just basic fucking monologue and make it the

1327
01:24:08.351 --> 01:24:12.160
most interesting God damn like a Christopher Walken or even John Goodman that I

1328
01:24:12.161 --> 01:24:16.120
was playing.
Like I sometimes I forget what a great fucking actor that guy is.

1329
01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:20.740
Um,
I dunno,
I dunno.
So,

1330
01:24:20.741 --> 01:24:24.730
but as far as like songs that I would say it's difficult.
I would say,
uh,

1331
01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:30.760
the wanton song is ridiculously difficult and I think most people play it wrong.

1332
01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:36.040
They actually leave out one bass drum note where he's playing three in a row and

1333
01:24:36.041 --> 01:24:39.400
they only play two in a row at that fucking tempo was fucking ridiculous.

1334
01:24:40.210 --> 01:24:45.010
Um,
out on the tiles,
that second fill that he does,

1335
01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:49.960
that ends where he plays a fucking triplet with one God damn bass drum is

1336
01:24:49.961 --> 01:24:52.910
fucking ridiculous.
And then I also got to admit,
uh,

1337
01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:58.000
that drum and bass shit and a lot of stuff that like a,
I like really into like,

1338
01:24:58.001 --> 01:25:00.760
uh,
um,
what's his face?

1339
01:25:00.761 --> 01:25:03.250
A quest love the shit that he plays.

1340
01:25:03.251 --> 01:25:06.460
He's another guy where I think he took like the Steve Jordan thing to like the

1341
01:25:06.461 --> 01:25:11.200
next level.
Um,
and he,
he does shit.

1342
01:25:11.201 --> 01:25:12.580
I don't even know what the fuck he's doing,

1343
01:25:12.581 --> 01:25:17.500
but I don't like fucking stutter in here cause I can't really think of any

1344
01:25:17.501 --> 01:25:20.170
specific song.
I'll give you one here that I'm trying,

1345
01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:23.470
that I want to break out my double pedal because I don't play double bass.

1346
01:25:23.471 --> 01:25:24.730
I just play a single bass drum.

1347
01:25:24.731 --> 01:25:27.730
But every once in a while there's a drama comes along that's so fucking good.

1348
01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:31.210
It makes me want to play double bass.
And um,

1349
01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.770
I've actually really,
uh,
gotten into that band,

1350
01:25:35.771 --> 01:25:37.840
lamb of God and a,

1351
01:25:37.870 --> 01:25:42.550
just to warn some of my older listeners,
uh,

1352
01:25:42.551 --> 01:25:46.150
this is that sort of,
that,
that Rah Rah,
Rah,
Rah Rah kind of fucking singing,

1353
01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:50.770
but it's not as bad as some of the other guys.
But they,

1354
01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:55.780
they got this song called break you and this does have double bass pattern in

1355
01:25:56.261 --> 01:25:56.591
the end.

1356
01:25:56.591 --> 01:25:59.620
That I just think is the shit and I'm sure all you guys who played double bass,

1357
01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:03.100
this is a fucking joke for you,
but this is something,

1358
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:06.510
this is the kind of shit that makes me want to play doubles

1359
01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:09.190
<v 6>base.
Let's see if I got this here.
I can get,
this</v>

1360
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:14.230
just sounds ridiculous the way he's singing.
All right,
here we go.

1361
01:26:14.231 --> 01:26:17.470
Listen to this fucking double bass pattern.
This is Chris Adler.

1362
01:26:17.471 --> 01:26:21.400
This is one of my new favorite drummers.
I think this is the shit right here.

1363
01:26:21.401 --> 01:26:22.240
Listen to this.
Here we go.

1364
01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:32.700
That shit right there.
That

1365
01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:36.200
<v 4>and machine guns shift actually figured out what the fuck he's doing,
but I,</v>

1366
01:26:36.201 --> 01:26:40.610
that just amazes me that the entire band can be on fucking point like that and I

1367
01:26:40.611 --> 01:26:43.610
know you guys are going to hit me with a bunch of other double bass drum players

1368
01:26:43.611 --> 01:26:44.930
who are faster or whatever.

1369
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:48.020
I liked their band because the temple that they play at,

1370
01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:52.070
it's still fucking music to me because some of those other bands I try to get

1371
01:26:52.071 --> 01:26:54.350
into,
but it's maybe my ear isn't ready to hear it,

1372
01:26:54.351 --> 01:26:58.400
but the shit is so fucking fast,
dad.

1373
01:26:58.401 --> 01:27:02.180
It loses its effectiveness that it stops being music.

1374
01:27:02.181 --> 01:27:03.560
It just sounds like a jet

1375
01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:09.420
that's like flying by but never passes my ears.
It's just sitting there

1376
01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:14.970
in my fucking ears.
So,
uh,
I guess that type of Shit.

1377
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.350
Does that make any fucking sense?
Why did I do with it?
What did I do?
Um,

1378
01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:19.740
let's get to the next question.

1379
01:27:19.741 --> 01:27:24.460
Who are some of the best recent drummers of the past decade?
Uh,

1380
01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:27.330
I'll just tell you the guys that I like,
I like everyone from a,

1381
01:27:29.330 --> 01:27:34.230
whoever played with those original Chuck Berry's,
I like Ringo,
Charlie Watts.

1382
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:39.850
Uh,
Phil Rudd,
Alex Van Halen,
Steve Gadd,
Vinny,

1383
01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:44.580
Vinny Khalida.
Yeah.
Uh,
Steve,
Steven Adler,

1384
01:27:44.581 --> 01:27:49.550
Chris Adler,
quest,
the,

1385
01:27:49.551 --> 01:27:54.390
so many fucking guys.
Um,
and I'm going fucking blank on all of them.

1386
01:27:54.391 --> 01:27:58.080
I really should've made a list.
You know what?
I'll actually,

1387
01:27:58.081 --> 01:27:59.880
since two a the MM podcast,

1388
01:27:59.881 --> 01:28:02.910
I'll send you a couple of youtube videos of some guys that I think are just

1389
01:28:02.911 --> 01:28:06.540
fucking amazing,
uh,
amazing drummers.
But,
uh,

1390
01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.450
I don't know anybody who gives me the fucking chills when I listened to them and

1391
01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:09.730
they,
that,

1392
01:28:09.730 --> 01:28:13.350
that's like the big thing and they make me wish that I could fucking do it.

1393
01:28:13.351 --> 01:28:15.990
That's,
that's how I judge whether a drummer is good enough.
If they,

1394
01:28:15.991 --> 01:28:20.340
if they play some shit and it's so fucking good that in my delusional head,

1395
01:28:20.341 --> 01:28:25.180
I start driving down the street,
fantasizing that I'm doing it,
you know,

1396
01:28:25.390 --> 01:28:29.590
during the middle of the greatest HBO standup special performance ever.

1397
01:28:30.050 --> 01:28:33.670
Then that's,
I get into,
I get into that drummer.
All right.

1398
01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:36.970
Number three is good times,
bad times.
The only song that you can play.

1399
01:28:36.971 --> 01:28:40.420
I can barely play that side,
but now this,
I can play some other ones.

1400
01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:46.070
I don't know.
Did that bore the shit out of you?
Music people who gives a fuck?
Um,

1401
01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:46.971
alright.
Advice.

1402
01:28:46.971 --> 01:28:50.690
This is going to be the last thing and I'm going to get on with my day here.

1403
01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:55.130
MMM,
okay.
Advice Bill,
how's it going?

1404
01:28:55.190 --> 01:28:59.690
I hope that wherever you're at,
everything is going swell.
Lol.
All right.

1405
01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:05.190
It's kind of a question about a relationship.
Here's my story.
I'm 19 years old,

1406
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:10.290
19 year old female who's been dating a 2021 year old male and we've been

1407
01:29:10.291 --> 01:29:12.540
together almost five years old,

1408
01:29:12.541 --> 01:29:16.080
g five fucking years.

1409
01:29:17.130 --> 01:29:21.990
And she writes fucking ridiculous.
Uh,
fucking ridiculous.
I know.

1410
01:29:21.991 --> 01:29:25.140
And our relationship has had its ups and downs,
like any relationship,

1411
01:29:25.141 --> 01:29:29.910
but lately I feel like I can't stand them anymore.
Yeah,

1412
01:29:29.911 --> 01:29:33.810
that's understandable.
You've been dating.
I'm like half of your fucking life.
Um,

1413
01:29:33.811 --> 01:29:36.270
I don't know what's wrong with me or maybe it's him.

1414
01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:40.200
I don't know what's going on.
I have no fucking clue.

1415
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:45.180
But he seems to have a really big problem with wheat.
If he isn't high,

1416
01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:49.260
he can't think about anything else but getting hi.
Oh God.
Here we go.

1417
01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:53.700
His goal in life is to get high as a fucking kite and giggle.

1418
01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:58.950
That's a peaceful,
nice fucking goal.
Uh,
she writes,
what the fuck?

1419
01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:01.920
I don't want to be dating a weakling who needs a drug,

1420
01:30:01.950 --> 01:30:03.540
like who leads a drug like that.

1421
01:30:03.541 --> 01:30:06.900
I want a man and I don't know how to tell him that.

1422
01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:11.250
Every time I tell them I have a problem with the weed,

1423
01:30:11.370 --> 01:30:14.850
we get into a huge argument and I ended up being the bitch.

1424
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:20.750
I just want them to care about me more than he cares about his weed and it's

1425
01:30:20.971 --> 01:30:22.140
hurting us financially.

1426
01:30:23.130 --> 01:30:28.130
We both only make 300 bucks a week and he's spending 75% of his check on weed,

1427
01:30:28.201 --> 01:30:33.090
cigarettes and gas.
I am the breadwinner.
I don't want to be the breadwinner.

1428
01:30:33.091 --> 01:30:36.870
I'm so tired of taking care of his dumb ass.
Um,

1429
01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:41.850
he doesn't even seem like he's willing to change even a little bit.
What do I do?

1430
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.320
I know I probably sound like a complete prude,
but I'm not at all.
Well anyways,

1431
01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:51.750
I really hope you read this and can give me some good advice.
All right,
ma'am,

1432
01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:53.700
you are dating a fucking loser.

1433
01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:00.090
Yeah,
you're dating a loser so you gotta you gotta get out of it.

1434
01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:02.610
I mean the only red flag in there is when you said,

1435
01:31:02.611 --> 01:31:06.930
I just want him to care about me more than he cares about his weed.

1436
01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:11.340
Now
the only question I have there is,
well,

1437
01:31:11.341 --> 01:31:14.040
what if he was really into playing guitar?
Would you then be like,

1438
01:31:14.041 --> 01:31:18.210
I just want him to care more about me than he does about his guitar playing

1439
01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:23.720
because then you know that's actually a red flag with you because you could be

1440
01:31:24.601 --> 01:31:25.920
one of those awful people.

1441
01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:29.040
Like one of the worst relationships you can seriously be in is when you're

1442
01:31:29.041 --> 01:31:34.041
dating somebody who finds your passion to be a threat and then they

1443
01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:41.660
systematically like they try to mind fuck you out of basically either your dream

1444
01:31:43.711 --> 01:31:47.140
in life all the way down to just a simple hobby that you have just because it

1445
01:31:47.141 --> 01:31:49.890
steals focus from you paying attention to them,

1446
01:31:49.891 --> 01:31:53.850
which I don't think you are in this.
I think you sound very rational.

1447
01:31:53.851 --> 01:31:55.380
You actually said,
I don't know if it's me,

1448
01:31:55.381 --> 01:32:00.070
so I don't think you are being like that,
so I have to side with you 100% here.

1449
01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:02.650
All right,
let's roll.
Let's,
first of all,

1450
01:32:02.651 --> 01:32:04.240
we'll start with your relationship and just,

1451
01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:10.360
just completely ignore the fact that he's 21 year 19 you've been together for

1452
01:32:10.361 --> 01:32:14.650
five years,
which means when you got together,
you were 14,
he was 16,

1453
01:32:14.770 --> 01:32:18.250
which means at some point he was 18 and you are under 18.

1454
01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:22.030
So there was some sort of statutory rape going on there,
right.

1455
01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:27.640
Uh,
we'll ignore all of that and just get to the fact like,
you know,

1456
01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:29.891
I've been,

1457
01:32:29.891 --> 01:32:32.890
a lot of my listeners would probably think that I was going to trash you for you

1458
01:32:32.891 --> 01:32:36.700
saying that I am the,
I'm the breadwinner.
I don't want to be the breadwinner,

1459
01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:41.890
you know,
and I would go,
oh,
typical fucking broads.
You know,

1460
01:32:41.891 --> 01:32:45.130
they all talk about how they want to be the independent God damn woman and Yada,

1461
01:32:45.131 --> 01:32:49.030
Yada,
Yada,
and all of a sudden they got to take care of some fucking sponge.

1462
01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:52.540
Welcome to my God damn world.
I'm not,
I don't feel that's that,

1463
01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:57.290
that you'll like that.
I know what you see a date in a fucking loser.
You're,

1464
01:32:57.300 --> 01:33:01.480
you're dating a future,
uh,
subject on cops.
It seems,

1465
01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:06.010
you know,
the way you describe him,
it's his,
he shirtless to,

1466
01:33:07.630 --> 01:33:10.780
this guy's a fucking loser.
He makes 300 bucks a week.

1467
01:33:10.810 --> 01:33:15.400
I'm not judging that aspect of it,
but he spent 75% of it on weed,

1468
01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:19.180
cigarettes and gas.
You know,

1469
01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:22.100
right now I'm picturing that guy that,
uh,

1470
01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:26.320
Matthew mcconaughey played in dazed and confused just hanging around the high

1471
01:33:26.321 --> 01:33:30.520
school,
like where the party's at,
man,
you know,
with his cool car.

1472
01:33:31.150 --> 01:33:35.140
Um,
yeah,
you got to get out of the relationship,
you know,

1473
01:33:35.170 --> 01:33:39.010
and there's nothing wrong as a female if,
if,

1474
01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:42.670
you know,
I'm not saying that you go out and just be a fucking gold digger,

1475
01:33:42.671 --> 01:33:46.270
but she wants you man to be able to provide.
That's what the fuck we do.

1476
01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:49.750
We provide,
we don't provide,
we're useless.

1477
01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.710
We don't have a womb right now.
Seriously.

1478
01:33:54.630 --> 01:33:59.440
We're fucking useless.
So I,
uh,
I get it.
Yeah,
you got,

1479
01:33:59.441 --> 01:34:03.910
you got to break up with this guy.
You mean,
how many times can you already,

1480
01:34:03.911 --> 01:34:07.810
it seems like you're approaching this guy on eggshells.
You know,

1481
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:11.980
he'd be really nice if you,
you know,
if you just stop being a fucking loser,

1482
01:34:12.370 --> 01:34:14.350
you'd been aren't even saying that you being a nice person.

1483
01:34:14.351 --> 01:34:15.760
So if I had to give you any advice,

1484
01:34:15.970 --> 01:34:20.140
I would say you need to get out of that relationship and considering you've been

1485
01:34:20.141 --> 01:34:23.830
in it since you're 14,
I think a,

1486
01:34:23.831 --> 01:34:28.720
you might be a little codependent and I think you need to to break up with this

1487
01:34:28.721 --> 01:34:31.210
guy.
Figure out who the fuck you are,

1488
01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:36.450
which will involve you staying single for a significant period of time and uh,

1489
01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:41.410
and just know that you know,
breakups are painful.

1490
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:47.070
Just prepare yourself for that so you don't go running back to this fucking

1491
01:34:47.351 --> 01:34:51.220
loser and waste another five years of your fucking life.

1492
01:34:51.250 --> 01:34:55.360
Cause you don't want to go through six weeks of pain just,
you know,

1493
01:34:55.420 --> 01:34:58.760
as they said and platoon take the pain.
All right,

1494
01:34:58.761 --> 01:35:02.460
just get out of the fucking relationship and just,
just tell yourself,

1495
01:35:02.461 --> 01:35:05.640
this is going to suck for six weeks.
I'm going to wake up crying.

1496
01:35:06.150 --> 01:35:07.650
I'm going to feel lost.

1497
01:35:07.710 --> 01:35:12.580
I'm going to be wondering what did I use to do with all my free time before I

1498
01:35:12.581 --> 01:35:13.600
was with this person.

1499
01:35:13.601 --> 01:35:18.601
You can have that bizarre feeling where now you're looking back on somebody who

1500
01:35:18.611 --> 01:35:22.230
was a huge part of your life and now they're becoming a stranger.

1501
01:35:22.231 --> 01:35:26.580
So then it just becomes this weird episode.
Like what was that?
Who was that?

1502
01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:30.760
What the fuck was that my life that just went into that fucking room for five

1503
01:35:30.761 --> 01:35:34.880
years?
It's really buzz.
Just prepare yourself that that's going to happen,

1504
01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:37.970
but every day it gets a little bit fucking easier.

1505
01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:40.810
And then one day you're going to wake up.
You're not going to give a shit.

1506
01:35:40.811 --> 01:35:43.620
The Sun's going to be shining.
And uh,

1507
01:35:45.130 --> 01:35:46.700
and then just a joy being single.

1508
01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:51.080
Your only fucking 19 years old is no fucking reason to be in a relationship

1509
01:35:51.081 --> 01:35:54.430
that's serious for that fucking long with the fucking loser.

1510
01:35:54.431 --> 01:35:59.410
So get out of it,
get through the pain.
And then after six weeks,

1511
01:35:59.411 --> 01:36:03.740
you know,
just hanging out with your friends,
have a good fucking time,

1512
01:36:03.741 --> 01:36:05.120
but do not get into another relationship.

1513
01:36:05.121 --> 01:36:07.610
I wouldn't get into another relationship for like a year.

1514
01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:12.920
Just be single for at least a fucking year and feel how awesome that is to just

1515
01:36:13.481 --> 01:36:16.390
be single,
to wake up,
you know,

1516
01:36:17.950 --> 01:36:21.910
feel good about yourself but then not have to worry that someone else's a dose.

1517
01:36:22.030 --> 01:36:25.290
So that drags down.
You're feeling good about yourself quotient.
Yeah.

1518
01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:28.150
It just fucking be single.
All right.
There you go.

1519
01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:32.110
I said the same thing 90 times in a fucking roll.
I realize it.
And a,

1520
01:36:32.111 --> 01:36:34.180
what are we going?
I'm a little over an hour here on the podcast,

1521
01:36:34.181 --> 01:36:39.080
so good luck to Ya.
All right.
Uh,
that's it.
That's the podcast for this week.

1522
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:40.370
I will talk to you guys next week.

1523
01:36:40.371 --> 01:36:43.430
This weekend I am at the funny bone in Columbus,
Ohio.

1524
01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:49.310
And uh,
Friday,
Saturday and Sunday are the dates that I'm going to be there.

1525
01:36:49.311 --> 01:36:52.430
And actually those are the days.
Here are the actual dates.
November 12th,

1526
01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:56.540
13th and the 14th and on the 13th I'm going to try to go to that Ohio state,

1527
01:36:56.541 --> 01:37:01.420
Penn state game.
You know,
cause I've,
I've been to Ohio state game,

1528
01:37:01.421 --> 01:37:03.400
but the first time I went they played bowling green.

1529
01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:07.080
It was like the middle of September,
one of those cupcake games and it's sucked.

1530
01:37:07.081 --> 01:37:10.830
So I want to go there and get the full on horseshoe fucking experience.

1531
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:14.040
So that is it.
Thank you guys for all the emails.

1532
01:37:14.041 --> 01:37:16.950
Thank you so much for buying my DVD.
If you haven't bought it yet,

1533
01:37:17.130 --> 01:37:20.620
it's only 10 bucks.
I swear to God.
Yeah,
you're,
you're,

1534
01:37:20.621 --> 01:37:23.100
you're not going to be upset if you buy this fucking thing and you're really be

1535
01:37:23.101 --> 01:37:27.840
helping me out because I will get another deal to shoot another special that you

1536
01:37:27.841 --> 01:37:31.470
can then watch and enjoy.
See how it works.
A little surf in fucking turf here.

1537
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:33.690
<v 0>Beautiful.
All right,
I'll talk to you guys next week.</v>

1538
01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:48.370
So close so close.
