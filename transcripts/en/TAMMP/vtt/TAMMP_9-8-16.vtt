1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.860
Hey,
what's going on as bill burn?
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:07.560
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcasting.

3
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.500
Just checking in on you.
Um,
just chicken on Anya.
How are you?

4
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.550
Come in the middle of a tour.
I'm in Charleston.

5
00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:22.210
South Carolina is fucking places.
Amazing.

6
00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:24.400
I was just telling somebody about how beautiful it is here.

7
00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:28.210
Everybody always goes to Savannah,
Georgia.
You don't want to go to Savannah,

8
00:00:28.211 --> 00:00:31.870
Georgia.
Savannah,
Georgia is like the Times Square of the south light.

9
00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:35.170
Everybody knows about.
It's everybody's gonna fucking end up there.

10
00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:37.890
And then what happens?
Yeah,
everybody sits around going,

11
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.930
why the fuck didn't we just stay in Atlanta?
In fact,

12
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:44.350
that's the number one thing said in Savannah,
Georgia.

13
00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:48.760
So everybody's all about that.
Okay.
Savannah,
Georgia is the VHS

14
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.560
of quaint southern cities.
Alright.

15
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.160
Charleston,
South Carolina.
That's the Beta.
That's the shit.
Yeah.

16
00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.380
That they should have used,

17
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.400
but they didn't cause everybody always gravitates towards,
you know,

18
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.250
the more mainstream what,
so whatever.
They're both beautiful,
but I love this,

19
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.240
this fucking place.
I'm telling you,
we get down near the water.
It literally,

20
00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:17.140
it looks like a Tom Hanks movie.
You know,
like Tom Hanks,

21
00:01:17.141 --> 00:01:20.530
we'll be walking down the street with Meg Ryan,
you know,

22
00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:24.460
and all the soccer moms would be like,
they just look good together.

23
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.190
Um,
speaking of Tom Hanks,
did anybody see that movie?
Sally.

24
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.040
Sally,
Shelly,
but going into the water,
Joe,
what the fuck?

25
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.950
Um,
I haven't seen it yet.

26
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.280
I'm hoping.
Well,
Clint Eastwood did it right,
so probably would be good.

27
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.940
I was just nervous.
Said it was just going to be a bunch of,
uh,
you know,

28
00:01:51.941 --> 00:01:55.530
there's only one place to land this thing that's going to be in the water.
Yeah.

29
00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.380
Like they were going to do some overdramatic fucking uh,
Hollywood shit,

30
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:02.120
but it's clean.
He split.
So maybe they did.

31
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.320
I just think it's funny that it's named Sally and he's not from fucking,

32
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.310
I don't even know where he's from.
I just looked at his last name.
It's like,

33
00:02:10.311 --> 00:02:13.490
that's not Sullivan.
Why they call him him?
Sally.

34
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.740
Sally is short for Sullivan and this other guy,
I don't know what his name is,

35
00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:21.080
just like seller when a,
when a witness or something,
you know,

36
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.440
so they just go by celly.
I think it's a Polish name.

37
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:27.440
I don't know what the fuck it is.
All I know is Tom Hanks let his hair go white.

38
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.183
<v 1>Right?</v>

39
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.630
<v 0>Is that a weird fucking thing?
Just dying your hair</v>

40
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.620
like I don't understand why people do that.

41
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.970
Why didn't you allow to look old?
Like if you're like a 60 year old,

42
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.840
like there'll be people in movies in that play in like a 60 year old guy and

43
00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:48.490
they have like jet black hair.

44
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.460
What could shoe pels tough like fucking shoe leather.
That Guy Damn Shoe Polish.

45
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:56.580
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.980
<v 0>Everybody should just let themselves go to shit and Hollywood</v>

47
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.670
would be great.
That would,

48
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.540
you still need the hottest but I'm just saying once you get past a certain age,

49
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:12.040
like 40 they should just let you go to shit,
you know?

50
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.530
And that would be great.

51
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:19.531
It's always fun to see some double Chin fucking baldy walking around,

52
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:22.810
right?
Or do you guys need them to all look good?

53
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:24.520
I have no fucking idea how it works.

54
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:29.320
All I know is the guy's last name isn't Sullivan goes by the name Sally.

55
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.450
A couple of fucking birds or something went into the jet engine.

56
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.400
He had to set that thing down in the fucking Hudson River.

57
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.640
<v 2>All right.
God,
I can't imagine that.</v>

58
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.040
<v 0>Hey,
so I was flying down to South Carolina.
Uh,</v>

59
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.020
that's all I have to say about that.
You know,
that unbelievable event.
I just say,

60
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.590
my God,
I can't imagine that.
All right,
next subject.

61
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.860
So I was flying down to South Carolina this morning and a fucking Bill Murray

62
00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.180
was on my flight.
How cool is that?
Huh?
Big Urn McCracken.

63
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.990
<v 2>Okay.</v>

64
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.420
<v 0>The guy from stripes,</v>

65
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.510
caddy shack and all those fucking legendary movies.

66
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.780
So now I'm trying to think of the amount of people from the original error of

67
00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:17.790
SNL.
I know he wasn't one of the original ones.

68
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.740
<v 2>I've,
uh,</v>

69
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.010
<v 0>I did a movie with Jane Curtin and then at the party,</v>

70
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.700
the Christmas party of the director,
I met Ray Laraine Newman.

71
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.710
So that's two.
And then I saw Bill Murray.

72
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.650
John Belushi's gone,
never saw Dan Akroyd Chevy chase.
I was at his roast.

73
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.160
So I got like three out of six Garrett Morris.

74
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.160
<v 2>I met him.
It's not bad.</v>

75
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.830
<v 0>Fucking going right to the cast.
Bill Murray was on a flight,
you know.</v>

76
00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.210
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

77
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.510
<v 0>I was fucking,
while walking down the street and uh,</v>

78
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.430
Hal Mcrae,
Pete was on the sand and went the fuck,
you know,
this is why I can't,

79
00:05:07.431 --> 00:05:10.310
I can't do these fucking podcasts when I'm on the road.

80
00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:13.820
I got like three hours sleep last night and it wasn't because I was boozing.

81
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.160
I did two amazing shows at the paramount theater out in Long Island,

82
00:05:19.161 --> 00:05:22.130
one of the most beautiful places I've ever performed out with some of the

83
00:05:22.131 --> 00:05:23.570
sickest goddamn food.

84
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.370
And I ate eating perfectly the whole night because I was working with Vinny
mark.

85
00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:31.280
And we got this tradition where whenever we worked with each other,

86
00:05:31.281 --> 00:05:33.680
we always end up going to white castle.
So I'm like,

87
00:05:33.681 --> 00:05:36.590
I'm going to eat fucking perfectly.
And

88
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.190
I woke up or did I have and I didn't have shit.
Right.
And when I did the opiod,

89
00:05:43.191 --> 00:05:44.750
Jimmy show had a great time.

90
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:46.620
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

91
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.240
<v 0>And then I went down to the village.</v>

92
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.510
That's right to do Lenny Marcus's and fucking Kevin Brennon's podcasts at the

93
00:05:53.641 --> 00:05:57.030
comedy cellar.
And they had,
they have an oatmeal place.
Just,

94
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.040
I never order oatmeal publicly.

95
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.160
I never do it cause it always tastes like paste and they fuck it up at that

96
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:07.760
place.
All they do is oatmeal or they call themselves oatmeal's.

97
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.630
So they're ended the shit.
So I went in there and I got a bowl of that.

98
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:15.770
So that was good.
Right?
Then you guys got to listen to this podcast by the way.

99
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.040
You know,
it's funny,
there was so much screaming and yelling on this,

100
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:21.020
just done by one man.
By the way,

101
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.980
Kevin Brennan just out of his fucking tree screaming at me.

102
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.660
If you ever want to listen to somebody just screamed at me,
you know,

103
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.690
and be mad that I'm selling tickets.
This is,
this is,
this is the show.

104
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.190
You have to fucking listen to it.
Let me find out the name here.
Lenny Marcus

105
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.510
podcast.
All right,
here we go.
What is it called?
Something

106
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.490
misery loves company.

107
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

108
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.120
<v 0>All right.
It's him and Kevin Brennan and I,
Jesus Christ.</v>

109
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.350
Kevin Brennan was going off on me,
but uh,

110
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:57.870
I got some good digs in on him at one point.

111
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.470
He was so fucking over the top screaming that me and Lenny would just sort of

112
00:07:01.471 --> 00:07:06.471
singing underneath him like happy songs to try to take the edge off of what he

113
00:07:06.661 --> 00:07:09.180
was saying.
Um,
but

114
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.870
we will have in fun.
But,
uh,
I don't know when that fucking thing's coming out,

115
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:20.980
but uh,
to give you an example,
he was like,
oh,
what do you,

116
00:07:20.981 --> 00:07:21.491
what you do?
Oh,

117
00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:25.690
I'm fucking Billpro I just get on stage and I fucking scream and then I get to

118
00:07:25.691 --> 00:07:30.580
play these big venues.
He was just trashing me the entire fucking time.

119
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.510
And,
um,
I got to admit,
you know,

120
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.140
at 11 in the morning was a little bit much,
but,
uh,

121
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.420
came out of it unscathed,

122
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.810
so I knew I didn't have enough time to do fucking cardio.

123
00:07:43.811 --> 00:07:48.760
You know what it really is,
is a gym near where I was staying in New York.
And,

124
00:07:48.761 --> 00:07:53.600
um,
they always ask for your fucking driver's license when you go in there.

125
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.030
It's like,
I'll just pay with my credit card.
And they're like,

126
00:07:56.031 --> 00:07:58.940
we have to make a copy of your driver's license.
It's like,
for what?

127
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.200
You're not the feds,
what do you,
I know,
what the fuck are you using that force?

128
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.230
You get my name and my address and then you sell that information.

129
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.970
There's such fucking assholes.
So instead of going to the gym,

130
00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:14.870
I just walked from the village all the way to the upper west side.

131
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.780
It wasn't even that bad a walk.
It's just a slow fucking inclined.

132
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.650
I'm a big La Pussy anyway,
so I'm always fucking going on hikes.

133
00:08:21.651 --> 00:08:23.420
So it wasn't even that bad.
And

134
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:30.410
I forgot about like how difficult it is to walk through New York City sometimes

135
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:33.200
and,
and there's two different,
there's three,

136
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:37.130
three groups of people that fucking drive me nuts.
The first two are obvious.

137
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.940
The Group of seven people who are walking seven abreast,

138
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:43.610
so they can all hear each other,
you know,

139
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.210
like that they're walking up the street like not even like reservoir dogs where

140
00:08:47.211 --> 00:08:50.690
they had a little bit of daylight.
We can pick your holes like Oj Simpson,
right.

141
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.720
Cut back against the grain.
They're like fucking,
you know,

142
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.740
like a bunch of cops trying to break up a protest,
right?
Arm's locked.

143
00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.880
There's those people,

144
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.470
there's the group of people that walks out of like a hotel or they just got done

145
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:08.070
eating and they all stand in the middle of the sidewalk looking up at buildings

146
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:09.900
and trying to figure out what the fuck they're going to do.

147
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.500
And then one of the most frustrating ones ever is the person walking in front of

148
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:20.781
you who was walking slightly diagonal and they always walking the diagonal that

149
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:24.960
you,
you're trying to fucking pass them on and then you cut to the other side.

150
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.170
They liked it.
It's like they're drunk or they're texting while walking.

151
00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:31.890
I don't know what the fuck it is,
but those are the people,
you know,

152
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:36.230
you want to come up behind them,
give him the old slew foot there.
Um,

153
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.390
but anyways,
let me get to the,
uh,
get to the long island shows here.
Um,

154
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.630
you know,
I'm getting ready to do this special and um,

155
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.670
I had a Vinnie mark open and for me,

156
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:50.640
we're having a great time talking about the old days and he just was really just

157
00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:54.060
such a fucking nice guy to me.
I guess I was telling you when I first,

158
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.030
when I first started out and,
um,

159
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.770
but he knows all like the long island stand up history cause he was a part of it

160
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.100
and he was saying right down the street and I always heard about this place was

161
00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:08.550
the east side comedy club.
And um,

162
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.720
this was this place out in,
uh,
out in Long Island.

163
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.630
We like fucking everybody got their start.

164
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.673
<v 2>MMM.</v>

165
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.850
<v 0>Eddie Murphy,
Ray Romano,
Kevin James,
Rosie O'Donnell,</v>

166
00:10:22.851 --> 00:10:27.810
Paul Riser,
Jim Carey,
this guy,
this guy,
Ritchie men.

167
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.870
I'm going to say his fucking name wrong.
I can't read.
I'm intervening.

168
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.943
<v 2>MMM.</v>

169
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.680
<v 0>Uh,
fuck was was the article.
This is the wrong God damn article here.</v>

170
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.823
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

171
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.700
<v 0>All right.
I'll just read you this article.
It says Richard [inaudible],</v>

172
00:10:44.701 --> 00:10:49.210
he should've worked for NASA because he helped launched the careers of so many

173
00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:53.770
big name New York comics in this,
the ones I just mentioned,
right.
And uh,

174
00:10:53.771 --> 00:10:57.200
Eddie Murphy,
Ray Romano,
Kevin James,
Rosie O'Donnell,
Paul Riser,
Jim Carey,

175
00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.350
a director,
Judd Apatow.

176
00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.570
Lot of people didn't know why he started doing standup again,

177
00:11:01.571 --> 00:11:03.500
but he did that before.
You know,

178
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.730
he did stand up initially before he did the 40 year old virgin knocked up and

179
00:11:06.731 --> 00:11:10.330
all those huge movies and now he's back to doing stand up while also making all

180
00:11:10.331 --> 00:11:11.470
these great movies.
So anyways,

181
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.680
all of their comedy bones made their comedy bones in the 1980s and nineties in

182
00:11:16.871 --> 00:11:21.040
Huntington Long Island at the legendary east side comedy club,

183
00:11:21.041 --> 00:11:24.910
which closed in 1995.
Um,

184
00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:29.260
Richie said I was in real estate in 1979 but I wanted to be a comedian,

185
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.810
a top comic who plays all the a list casinos and works the cruise ships circuit.

186
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.620
That was pretty much as high up as anybody got back then.
Um,
he goes,

187
00:11:38.621 --> 00:11:42.280
I got sick of driving into the city trying to get on stage at the Improv or

188
00:11:42.281 --> 00:11:43.420
catch a rising star.

189
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.660
So I found this restaurant in Huntington and made it into a comedy club.

190
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.210
Jackie Mason headlined his grand opening.

191
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.400
Jackie asked how I was going to pay him.

192
00:11:51.401 --> 00:11:56.401
10 grand is 10 fee with an $8 cover for 135 seats.

193
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.780
Richie said,
I have no idea what I was doing a so I said,

194
00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:06.100
I don't know.
And then Jackie was cool and said he told me to pay them next year,

195
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:09.580
which I did his first regular night of stand up.

196
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:12.280
Listen to this as first fucking show.
We have a booked at this club.

197
00:12:12.281 --> 00:12:17.281
This is a legendary east side comedy club with this was to show Eddie Murphy

198
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:22.540
right there over legendary show.
Jerry Seinfeld,

199
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.880
Jackie the joke man,
Marlin Paul Riser,
Rob Bartlett,

200
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:32.740
Bob Nelson in himself.
Each person did eight minutes and he said,

201
00:12:32.741 --> 00:12:37.330
I never dreamed that most of those guys would go on to become a big time

202
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:38.290
superstars.

203
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.250
And then he had all these great stories that vividly remembers Eddie Murphy

204
00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:44.680
shoes.
Said just before he went on stage,

205
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:49.120
Eddie would take a brand new pair of shoes out of the box,
wear them on stage.

206
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.920
It was a different pair every night.

207
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.000
Finally I found out he worked in a shoe store and he'd put them back on the

208
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:59.350
shelf.
The next day.
I fucking hilarious is that he said Ray Romano,

209
00:12:59.351 --> 00:13:03.610
or go on stage wearing a snazzy blazer blazer.
He'd take it off,

210
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.250
hang it on the chair.
So he would just walk out wearing it,

211
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.770
eat hanging on the chair.
He do his act,

212
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:13.300
then carry his jacket off stage and then you'd see the price tag on the inside

213
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.000
raid,
return it the next day for a refund.

214
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.330
Um,
this guy Rick,
he,

215
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.770
he told Richie told Jerry Seinfeld that he was hilarious but he needed to be

216
00:13:26.771 --> 00:13:31.150
more dirty.
And Joey was like,
yeah,
but then when I do the tonight show,

217
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:35.440
I'll have to clean it up and it'll hurt my time.
And he said,

218
00:13:35.441 --> 00:13:38.530
Richie just smirked and said,
sure,
Jerry.
Sure.
Like,
like,
you know,

219
00:13:38.531 --> 00:13:42.740
you're actually going to get on the tonight show,
which of course he did.
Um,

220
00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.880
and he just had a bunch of kind of things to say about Kevin James and all those

221
00:13:45.881 --> 00:13:50.200
guys say they haven't changed at all,
but,
um,
what's his face?

222
00:13:50.201 --> 00:13:53.080
Took me down the street and show me like the location where the first thing was.

223
00:13:53.081 --> 00:13:57.390
And I'm like,
I'm such a fucking nerd.
For the past,
you know,

224
00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.210
especially if it's something that I'm into,
you know,
when I would go to do,

225
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.650
you know what drives me up the fucking wall.

226
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.330
When you go to do the opion Jimmy show,
they got this,

227
00:14:05.331 --> 00:14:10.331
this space age elevator system where you don't just hit the button,

228
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.700
you got to hit what floor you're on.

229
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:17.740
So the whole concept is that like,
all right,
you know,

230
00:14:17.741 --> 00:14:22.741
cause people have to get to work fast as like 40 fucking floors.

231
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.040
If we break them up into clusters like this,
these five floors,

232
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:31.480
they hair these fucking four over there.
In theory,
it always,
you know,
to add,

233
00:14:31.481 --> 00:14:36.130
to make it more fucking difficult always seems like somehow it's going to make

234
00:14:36.131 --> 00:14:39.370
it easier,
which it never does.
So you go there right now you've got to,

235
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.910
we to look on your,
your car,
don't remember what fucking floor you're going to,

236
00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.420
you know.
So I went up and I was like,
God,
that wasn't bad.

237
00:14:46.421 --> 00:14:49.720
That actually maybe made it faster.
And then when I go to leave the show,

238
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.930
I want to hit lobby and I'm hitting lobby and I'm hitting lobbying.

239
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.020
I'm hitting lobbying.
It's not fucking working.
You know why?

240
00:14:57.021 --> 00:15:00.470
Cause I'm on like the top floor and that's the only one anybody hits when

241
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:02.720
they're up there.
So it's all fucking worn out.

242
00:15:02.721 --> 00:15:06.860
Like some old like ATM thing and I'm just sitting there in a panic.

243
00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:09.680
Like I got to go down to Lenny's fucking podcast.
I can't get the elevator,

244
00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.380
you know,
just fucking hit the Arrow button.

245
00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.660
I know I sound like a Goddamn [inaudible] but I swear to God like we should have

246
00:15:18.661 --> 00:15:20.520
stopped with the fucking technology.

247
00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.460
And I know this would affect the fact that I wouldn't be able to get to do this

248
00:15:23.461 --> 00:15:24.900
podcast,
but I don't give a shit.

249
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.680
Somewhere in the mid nineties was the tipping point.
All right.

250
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.440
Now we can keep people alive too long.

251
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.020
We're just making everything fucking difficult.

252
00:15:34.021 --> 00:15:35.580
Everything gets replaced and then you just,

253
00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:40.240
you just throw it in the fucking ocean,
right?
I mean that's no good.

254
00:15:40.241 --> 00:15:42.830
Is it okay.
Yeah.
He wouldn't think I'd be in,
in order to design.

255
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.940
I didn't get any fucking sleep.

256
00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:46.420
So late last night we ended up going to a white castle

257
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.690
and I got two doubles and two chickens and a little bit of French fries or

258
00:15:51.691 --> 00:15:54.630
whatever.
After eating well all day,
by the way,
the paramount theaters,

259
00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.130
food is fucking sick.
If you're there,

260
00:15:56.131 --> 00:16:00.620
you get the sliders and he's got these little tuna fucking cigar things.

261
00:16:00.621 --> 00:16:02.160
They rolled them up on this little shell thing,

262
00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:05.490
like a cigar Nitze sprinkled pepper on the answer.
It looks like a fucking cigar.

263
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:08.760
It's the shit.
Um,
I still think I eat pretty good,

264
00:16:08.761 --> 00:16:11.100
but like the white castle obviously fucking killed me.

265
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:16.050
So Vinnie ends up driving me and he's telling me all these great stories about

266
00:16:16.051 --> 00:16:18.330
the east side comedy club and all the people that he worked with.

267
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.790
So he drives me back in his city,

268
00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:25.980
drops me off where I'm staying.
And as I,

269
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:30.840
as his car drives away,
I realized I left my cell phone in his car.
So I'm like,

270
00:16:30.841 --> 00:16:35.050
fuck.
So I see this fucking dude sitting down

271
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.153
<v 2>right</v>

272
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.510
<v 0>on the stoop.
So I'm like,
I fucking run,
you know,
next door said,
hey man,</v>

273
00:16:42.511 --> 00:16:45.520
my buddy just took off a car.
Can I just use your cell phone just so I can call,

274
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.210
you know,
and he's holding his cell phone so I can just call blah blah,
blah,
blah,

275
00:16:50.211 --> 00:16:52.080
blah,
you know,
and get my phone back.

276
00:16:52.081 --> 00:16:54.270
Could just let me make a real quick phone call.
And the guy just looks at me.

277
00:16:54.271 --> 00:16:56.480
He just goes,
he's like looking up,

278
00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.520
he's sitting on the first day and I'm looking down at him.

279
00:16:59.521 --> 00:17:00.720
He just looks up and he just goes like,

280
00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.400
<v 2>yeah,
no,
no.</v>

281
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.250
<v 0>I'm just like,
really?
You fucking cunt,
right?</v>

282
00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.390
So just this little fucking Dweeb.

283
00:17:13.391 --> 00:17:16.480
I should have just slapped the fucking phone right out and thrown in a puddle.

284
00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:21.340
Um,
so I'm just not,
what a fucking Dixon and I run down,

285
00:17:21.341 --> 00:17:26.180
there's a bar on the corner.
This is fucking dude,
all tattooed up,

286
00:17:26.181 --> 00:17:28.190
neck tattoos,
the whole fucking thing.

287
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.760
I just talked to like the biggest pussy ever.
And he said,
no,

288
00:17:31.761 --> 00:17:35.090
now I'm going to go up to this guy from like fucking this sons of anarchy.

289
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.870
I just say,
fuck it.
I go,
man,
I go,
you got,
can I just use yourself?

290
00:17:38.871 --> 00:17:42.990
I told him the whole thing and he just goes,
yeah,
sure.
Let me fucking use it.

291
00:17:42.991 --> 00:17:44.130
I called him and I was fine.

292
00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.360
That little fucking pricks of standing there waiting for my buddy to come back.

293
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.140
I'm just staring at the guy and I just,
I hadn't actually be like,

294
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.760
I actually respected them on some level,

295
00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.240
<v 3>you know,</v>

296
00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.780
<v 0>maybe just looked at me and I just looked like such a fucking Ron Howard looking</v>

297
00:18:00.781 --> 00:18:03.660
jackass that he had no respect for me.
What a fucking,

298
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.910
it's been a while since I just prayed for something like really bad to happen to

299
00:18:08.911 --> 00:18:09.744
somebody.

300
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.233
<v 3>No,</v>

301
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.350
<v 0>I like really bad.
I just mean like as ac breaks and nobody comes and fixes it.</v>

302
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.750
He just sits there in the fucking heat wave.

303
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:19.703
<v 1>MMM.</v>

304
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.510
<v 0>Anyways,
this really feels like the worst fucking podcast ever.</v>

305
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.440
I got like the fucking hiccups,
you know?
I don't even know where the fuck I'm at.

306
00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:32.450
This God damn thing.
But you know what I do know?
Pump up a Butoh dude.
Okay.

307
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:37.170
<v 3>Get it to did it a bait if big,
big,
big,
Big Bay Bay,
Bay Bay.</v>

308
00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.540
<v 0>It's fucking football season.
Who Do you like tonight?</v>

309
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.890
Between the Carolina Panthers and the Denver Broncos?
Well,

310
00:18:44.891 --> 00:18:46.030
I'll tell you right now,

311
00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:50.650
these Denver Broncos that beat these Carolina Panthers are not the same Denver

312
00:18:50.651 --> 00:18:53.230
Bronco team that you saw this past January.

313
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:57.670
Obviously it doesn't need to be said,
but we're going to say it anyways.

314
00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.760
Peyton manning rode off into the sunset.

315
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:05.780
The van is retired.
He will not be understand her screaming Omaha.

316
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:11.290
So I guess the Games probably in Denver,
I would think.
Right?
Is it in Denver?

317
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.460
I Dunno.
Bill.
Why don't you go to nfl.com and fucking figure it out.

318
00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:16.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

319
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:21.790
<v 0>Why it is in fact,
in Denver,
I think Carolina wins this one,
right?</v>

320
00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.040
I'm going to give you all my fucking NFL picks right now,

321
00:19:24.041 --> 00:19:28.510
not knowing shit about it.
Uh,
Carolina Beats Denver,
Tampa,

322
00:19:28.511 --> 00:19:33.070
Atlanta.
Let's say Atlanta.
They're at home.
Matty ice.
They win that one.

323
00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:38.050
Uh,
Buffalo Baltimore.
Baltimore is a great defense.
Uh,

324
00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.320
I say Baltimore,
Chicago,
Houston.

325
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.290
Uh,
well that's a weird one.
You know,
it's kind of a pick up.

326
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:49.400
I'm just going to say Chicago cause I just,

327
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.200
I just picked two home teams in a row.

328
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:56.080
That's the level of fucking thought that I'm putting into this green papers.

329
00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.090
Jacksonville.
What Green Bay is going to win that one?
Jesus Christ.

330
00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:03.200
It's not even fair.
San Diego versus Kansas City.

331
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:07.430
I'm going to go with the man with a million children in picked San Diego,

332
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.600
right?
What's his,
I forget everybody's name.
The second the season ends,

333
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:17.130
it's a guy's fucking name.
He's got like nine kids.
Oh,

334
00:20:17.131 --> 00:20:20.970
what's his fucking name?
What is his name?

335
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:26.320
Not Andrew Luck.
Not Eli Manning.
Not Tie Rod Taylor.

336
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:30.130
Not Derek Carr.
Not Matthew Stepford fell up.

337
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:34.900
Revers I'm going to go with the man.
You know the man with the Golden Gun.

338
00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:39.340
This is the man with a million kids.
He's like real life.
The fucking Walton's.

339
00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.890
You know?
And if you're going to have nine kids,

340
00:20:41.891 --> 00:20:43.870
you might as well be a fucking multimillionaire.

341
00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:47.770
Can you imagine what Christmas must be at their house?

342
00:20:47.771 --> 00:20:51.250
Like how many fucking trees they have?
It's gotta be insane.

343
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:55.390
He probably buys all these sick ass fucking gifts,
you know what I mean?

344
00:20:55.391 --> 00:20:57.820
If I had nine fucking kids and I had his money,

345
00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.730
I buy them all like electric cars and I'd make them,

346
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.520
you know those little toy cars that you could sit in,

347
00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:07.210
a little kid could sit and I make them race themselves around the fucking thing.

348
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.210
I'd have one of those circular driveways,
right?

349
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.750
I'd have time trials on Saturday.
I put them all on the super soft,
so on Sunday,

350
00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:21.751
and I'd let him just fucking whip around and whoever won got dessert,

351
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.980
they ain't got to hang with me.

352
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:29.040
And then the rest of them would be banished to the loser wing of my mansion

353
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.730
and sure they would resent me.
A lot of them would cry,

354
00:21:33.731 --> 00:21:38.200
especially the little ones,
you know?
But there'd be no excuses.

355
00:21:38.201 --> 00:21:41.980
Cubs Sunday,
even if you were a baby,
you know,

356
00:21:41.981 --> 00:21:45.130
if you couldn't figure out how to just roll down onto the gas pedal,

357
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:49.020
at least make a fucking effort slam into somebody,
then that would be at,

358
00:21:49.021 --> 00:21:53.590
you would be banished by wife,
didn't like it.
She would be banished to.
Right.

359
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.620
This is why God never let me be a fucking
NFL quarterback.
That's,

360
00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:02.650
that's exactly what I would do if I had nine fucking kids.

361
00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.410
Jesus Christ.

362
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:09.460
I give every one of them would have like chores and I would never have shit to

363
00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:12.700
do.
Do you have nine kids?
You can actually run a farm.

364
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.420
So if you just live in a fucking house,
you know what I mean?

365
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:23.080
I give each one of them are room.
You clean up to study.

366
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:27.160
That's your job,
right?
You don't clean up to study.
I'm taking away your car.

367
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.780
You're going to get,
you going to get punished.

368
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.410
A couple of grid grid positions come Sunday.

369
00:22:32.411 --> 00:22:34.120
You're never going to have fucking dessert again.

370
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:38.770
You'd have to be strict with nine kids,
I would think.
Right?

371
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.230
Jesus Christ.
How many belts would you have to go through during your fucking,

372
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.870
the course of your,
uh,
you know,
or if he,
that dude from the Viking,

373
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.760
like how many fucking weeds of switches would you be pulling out of the ground?

374
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:57.190
I'm kind of a fucking lunatic.
Hits his own son and the nuts with a switch.

375
00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:03.520
You know what I mean?
I get it.
That's the way you were brought up,
but you know,

376
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.550
you usually try to correct shit with your parents.
You know,

377
00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:07.840
at some point you'd be like,
you know,

378
00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.730
I'm going to stop short of hitting my own son in his little fucking pre

379
00:23:12.731 --> 00:23:15.850
pubescent ball sack with a fucking switch.

380
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:20.900
You would like to think that someone would would make that leap,
but you know,

381
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:24.910
not everybody,
not everybody is as enlightened as me.

382
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:30.190
I like giving people advice that have children and I don't have any,

383
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.060
you know what I mean?
If you had nine kids,
you could actually,

384
00:23:34.061 --> 00:23:36.940
you could even if nobody had any musical ability ability,

385
00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:40.120
if you've sent all nine of them to American idol,

386
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:44.020
you got to think one of them would at least make it to Vegas,
right?

387
00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.730
Someone was just have be able to carry your fucking tune.

388
00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:52.450
Jesus Christ.
That's a giant God damn table.
Five kids on one side,

389
00:23:52.451 --> 00:23:55.870
four on the other.
Your wife on one side,
you on the other.

390
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.880
I mean,
how many fucking Turkeys is that?

391
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.060
It's a lot of Goddamn kids.
That's fucking not,

392
00:24:04.061 --> 00:24:08.470
that's like turn of the last century level kids.
You know what I mean?

393
00:24:08.471 --> 00:24:11.710
They would just have nine cause you knew someone was getting diet polio,

394
00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:14.620
somebody was going to get tuberculosis,
right.

395
00:24:14.621 --> 00:24:18.940
Someone was going to fall down a fucking well and right there you're down to
six.

396
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.130
You know it starts getting nervous.
So I mean those crops,

397
00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.610
you know the harvest is coming in and went down to six fucking kids.
You know,

398
00:24:26.611 --> 00:24:30.270
your wife's just laying on her back making fucking bread with one hand,

399
00:24:30.271 --> 00:24:31.930
churn the butter with the other and you just,

400
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.850
at the end of the day you come in and you just fucking walk right between the

401
00:24:35.851 --> 00:24:38.400
legs like you do when you're behind the heard of oxen.

402
00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.680
He just fucking put another one in her

403
00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:50.760
dude.
You know,
you'd be like,
you're like a college coach,

404
00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:54.240
college basketball coach.
It's like coaching Kentucky at that point.

405
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.150
The way the kids would leave you,
you know,
Kentucky,

406
00:24:57.151 --> 00:24:58.920
they're like one and done all the good players.

407
00:24:58.921 --> 00:25:02.910
So like you constantly got to be fucking out their prime when the pump throwing

408
00:25:02.911 --> 00:25:06.480
the dollar bills around,
handing out Gold Trans Ams.
Right.

409
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:10.560
But back in the day,
rather than leaving and going to the pros,

410
00:25:10.561 --> 00:25:13.710
they were just dying.
You know what I mean?
The more they died,

411
00:25:13.711 --> 00:25:17.160
the more farmland they took up me.
Granted,
they were enriching the soil.

412
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.880
It their bodies decouple.
The buddies would decompose back then.
Right,

413
00:25:20.881 --> 00:25:24.210
but they still put them in the boxes.
But you couldn't plant over there.

414
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.490
You know what I mean?
Oh my God.

415
00:25:26.491 --> 00:25:31.080
I mean this color flour for some reason I'm thinking about addie.
Oh,

416
00:25:31.081 --> 00:25:33.080
it's interesting you say that,
honey.
Cause I,

417
00:25:33.081 --> 00:25:36.450
that's right where I fucking buried him.
Yeah.

418
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:40.860
The native Americans decided to do a drive by

419
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:46.740
and he took a fucking hatchet to the head.
I told him to duck.
He didn't.

420
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.160
He was weak.
He doesn't deserve to live.
All right,
there you go.

421
00:25:50.161 --> 00:25:53.400
Now you're down to five kids.
Now you're down to five kids.

422
00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:54.930
I'm going to Google this right now.

423
00:25:54.931 --> 00:25:58.890
Ways to die in 1900 let's see what comes up.

424
00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.790
Ways to die.
I didn't finish my NFL picks.

425
00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:08.310
Uh,
let's see here.
All right,
so I stopped off at Philip Rivers,

426
00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.360
you know,
I gotta say the man with a thousand kids.
He's gonna win that one.

427
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:18.370
Oklahoma,
New Orleans at home got to go with New Orleans.
Cincinnati,

428
00:26:18.371 --> 00:26:23.350
New Jersey.
I say New Jersey.
I mean I'd New Jersey,
New York jets.

429
00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:29.020
I say they set the tone with a big loss against Seattle at home.
Cleveland.

430
00:26:29.021 --> 00:26:33.850
Philly.
Do I even need to say it?
Philly wins that.
Minnesota,
Tennessee.
Oh,

431
00:26:33.851 --> 00:26:38.200
the old fucking pre pubescent ball wipers.
You know what I'm going to say?

432
00:26:38.201 --> 00:26:40.870
They're going to get a road when,
I dunno.
Why Miami?
Seattle.

433
00:26:40.871 --> 00:26:45.840
That one's over before it begins at Seattle's Day.
A New York giants.
Cowboys.

434
00:26:45.841 --> 00:26:49.590
Cowboys at all.
No.
Eli plays go to the road.
Eli Wins that one.

435
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:55.080
Detroit,
Indiana.
Uh,
what's that?

436
00:26:55.081 --> 00:26:56.670
The pacers thoughts.
Andrew Luck.

437
00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.640
I don't fucking know.
You know what?
Fuck it.
I'll say Detroit.

438
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.280
Detroit is going to cover doing Glen Arizona.
Oh,

439
00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:10.670
what Jeanine Graf low under center.
I say the Patriots.
Surprise him.

440
00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.440
No,
that's got to be a tough game.
We're going to,
Oh fuck that.

441
00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:18.160
We're going to win Bill Bella checks going to figure him out.

442
00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:22.000
He'll figure out a fucking white and then a win and then everybody will get sad

443
00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:26.590
and then they'll start,
they'll start measuring Jimmy Garrett fellows,

444
00:27:26.591 --> 00:27:29.440
whatever his fucking name,
they're going to measure his shoe strings.

445
00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:34.180
And you know,
if you know that plastic tip,
if it had come undone for some reason,

446
00:27:34.181 --> 00:27:37.690
that'll be so fucking,
you know,
four game suspension for him too.

447
00:27:37.691 --> 00:27:42.520
And then we'll have,
uh,
you know,
our quarterback will also be a potter.
You know,

448
00:27:42.521 --> 00:27:44.230
John Elway,
the older he gets,

449
00:27:44.231 --> 00:27:48.520
the more he looks like he was one of the founding fathers.
He is a very,
like,

450
00:27:48.521 --> 00:27:52.840
he looks like he signed something,
something that was on a scroll,

451
00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.540
not when he wears sunglasses though the wrap around.
Good.
All right.

452
00:27:55.541 --> 00:27:57.520
Good luck for him.
Um,

453
00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:04.080
he definitely looks like he should be on money is his head should be on money or

454
00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:09.790
maybe change.
Um,

455
00:28:09.791 --> 00:28:14.540

457
00:28:15.591 --> 00:28:19.700
Washington can't get out of their own fuck away then the La Rams.

458
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:24.770
I love it.
I love that.
That back against the San Francisco 40 niners.

459
00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.560
I got to go 40 niners at home.

460
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:33.020
Even with the incredible distraction.
Can you believe that shit?

461
00:28:33.021 --> 00:28:36.350
One guy sits down for the fucking national anthem.
What'd you even know?

462
00:28:36.351 --> 00:28:37.280
He was doing it.

463
00:28:37.281 --> 00:28:41.090
If they didn't tell you how much people are flipping out about that,

464
00:28:41.091 --> 00:28:45.730
it's just fucking hilarious to me.
How does it affect your life?
I don't.

465
00:28:45.731 --> 00:28:46.051
I don't care.

466
00:28:46.051 --> 00:28:48.600
You don't care if he eats a fudgsicle Durden and if that's what the fuck he

467
00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:53.070
wants to do,
God bless them.
Everybody acting like when they're at home.

468
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.920
This standing at attention.
When the fucking song comes on.

469
00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.690
Think about some of this shit that you've been doing well and the rockets.

470
00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:02.400

Leading causes of death in the U S in 1900.</v>

479
00:29:38.431 --> 00:29:40.260
All right.
This is how your kids died.
If he had no,

480
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.890
this is why he had to have nine kids back in the day.
All right.

481
00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:51.210
Influenza pneumonia.
See Ya.
That goes a good two,
three kids,

482
00:29:51.211 --> 00:29:55.830
tuberculosis.
I called that.
This is like the Morbid family feud.

483
00:29:56.370 --> 00:30:00.720
Gastrointestinal infections,
heart disease,

484
00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.580
and then see she broke vascular disease.

485
00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:09.100
One of the fuck then is what about farming equipment?

486
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.970
By 1950 was heart disease.
Oh No.
This,

490
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:31.100
Ways to die as a child in 1900 wold childbirth was one of them.

491
00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:38.430
And you lost your wife.
That was like your Scout,

Oxen.
Go Tell Paul it's time for dinner,

499
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.120

He was kind of fat,

522
00:32:33.681 --> 00:32:38.681
At least the one on TV was Battlestar Galactica iron man and gone 60 seconds.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:19.100
This loop where collection is going to zoom away,

Transformable,

00:33:27.131 --> 00:33:32.131
Just subscribe and received that month's crate and then the cutoff happens.

539
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.090
That's it.
It's over.
Just like your social.

540
00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:44.260

All right.

542
00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:51.790
Is this the last one?
I don't feel like doing this.

543
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:53.150
<v 2>Okay.</v>

544
00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:57.820
<v 0>Okay.
Oh,
legal zoom,
everybody.
Legal Zoom.</v>

545
00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:02.000
How are you?
God bless you.
You've heard the expression time is money,
right?

546
00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:07.940
Right.
Well,
it's true.
Evidently,
especially when you run a business,

547
00:34:07.941 --> 00:34:10.910
she can't afford to waste time taking care of your legal needs.

548
00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.680
Somebody does a face plant.
You can't figure out what their medical condition is.

549
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:19.130
You need to fucking step over them and keep moving up that hill.

550
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.890
That's why he should lose.
Use a legal zoom.

551
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.370
If you work with the typical attorney,
they'll charge you.

552
00:34:25.371 --> 00:34:29.720
I just pictured some fucking hack with a little pocket watch trying to be

553
00:34:29.721 --> 00:34:32.120
original.
It's like you're a fucking hack.
Well what?
What do you,

554
00:34:32.121 --> 00:34:34.400
what do you put the fuck?
Do you work out parking tickets?

555
00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.210
Do you work with a typical attorney?
They'll charge you for their time.

556
00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:42.230
It's called the billable hour and a lot of times they won't tell you how much,

557
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:46.130
how long it'll take in advance,
but legal zoom is different.

558
00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:47.210
They're not a law firm.

559
00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.500
They've spent the last 15 years making sure you get the most out of your time by

560

Don't walk like everyone else.

Agreed.

Agreed or sleep like everyone else.
You know what Alex Helix.

575
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:52.050
I owe you an apology.
I guess I am unique.

576
00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.850
So why is your mattress one size fits all well,

577
00:35:55.851 --> 00:35:59.250
because it's too expensive to have a customized mattress,
isn't it?

578
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.890
Because they truly customized mattress will cost you five to 10,000 bucks until

579
00:36:04.891 --> 00:36:08.550
now I'll do what I called it.
It's almost like I've read this copy before.

Go to [inaudible] dot com how likes sleep.com answer a few simple questions.

581
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:19.500

582
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:25.250
And they'll run a three d biochemical model of your body through the proprietary

583

You fucking freaks.

589
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:51.630
I want to swing over mine.
Okay.

590
00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:55.570
Your mattress arrives at your door in about a week and shipping is 100% free.

591
00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:00.240
That's why everyone from Gq magazine to Forbes are all talking about headaches.

00:37:00.241 --> 00:37:04.170
Sleep.

gross and give you 100% refund.

594
00:37:08.311 --> 00:37:11.760

Well,

Bar.
Hey,
he looks sleek.com/.

597
00:37:20.221 --> 00:37:24.210
Birth.
All right,
there you go.
That's the fucking Thursday afternoon,

598
00:37:24.211 --> 00:37:28.700
just before Friday,
checking in on your podcast.
Enjoy this music and uh,

599
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:33.140
some clips from a podcast from a fucking week gone by.
I don't know.

600
00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:34.053
<v 4>No.</v>

601
00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:29.460
<v 5>Um,
sleep,
walk,
banging a Billy boy.</v>

602
00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:33.060
I need some advice for something I can guarantee you haven't gotten an email

603
00:38:33.061 --> 00:38:36.310
about before.
This one is personal.
It's not really,
what do you hyping,

604
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:39.190
<v 6>you're fucking God damn thing.
Just get to it.
All right.</v>

605
00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:44.140
Over the last year I have discovered that I engage in sleepwalking behavior.

606
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.880
The most hilarious part of it.

607
00:38:45.881 --> 00:38:49.540
I think fucking Mike Birbiglia wrote a whole one man show that's now a movie

608
00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:51.880
about this.
So I really don't think you're breaking new ground,

609
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:54.970
although I'll give you the,
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

610
00:38:55.210 --> 00:39:00.210
The most hilarious part of it is that I engage in sleep sex.

611
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:06.510
Okay.
You know what?
Go Fuck Yourself.

612
00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.340
Do you think I'm dumb enough to believe this?

613
00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:12.840
You're either just making this shit up or you're a fucking pervert and you're

614
00:39:12.841 --> 00:39:16.800
going around basically sexually assaulting other people and then say,
ah,

615
00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:21.870
I was asleep.
Sorry that I put my dick on your lip.

616
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:25.890
Oh my fault.
I was sleeping.
Um,
anyways,
let,
let's,

617
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.820
let's just,
you know,
to fill up the hour.
I'm going to read the rest of this,

618
00:39:29.821 --> 00:39:32.940
but I'm already calling bullshit cause I've been with my girlfriend for four

619
00:39:32.941 --> 00:39:34.860
years now and we're both 22 years old.

620
00:39:34.861 --> 00:39:39.150
We share a room in a house together with other housemates and let me guess,

621
00:39:39.151 --> 00:39:41.550
you wander in and accidentally fucked somebody else.

622
00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.510
Is that what you gonna tell me?

623
00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:46.170
Is that really where this fucking email is going to go?
Um,

624
00:39:46.171 --> 00:39:49.950
I've found out that if we don't have sex at least once every two days,

625
00:39:49.951 --> 00:39:54.180
I will basically begin to perform sex acts on her while I sleep.

626
00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:57.630
Dude,
you are so full of fucking shit.

627
00:39:59.210 --> 00:39:59.790
<v 4>Okay.</v>

628
00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:04.230
<v 6>I will have absolutely no memories of these.
Here's his out.
Oh,</v>

629
00:40:04.231 --> 00:40:08.580
did I fucking finger bang you with my Dick in your ass.
Sorry.
I was sleep.

630
00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:12.930
Sleep's automizing.
Um,
I will have no memories,

631
00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.170
memories of these in the morning unless I wake up during the act.

632
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.870
My girlfriend says that my eyes are open,

633
00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.690
but totally glazed over when I do it.

634
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:25.440
The most common one is that I will go down on her.

635
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:31.410
This is so fucking stupid.
You're asleep,

636
00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:37.960
you're asleep and you're dreaming,
right?
Your eyes are open,
but you're,

637
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:42.830
you're still like in rem sleep and you're somehow pulling the covers off.

638
00:40:42.831 --> 00:40:47.700
Fine.
What are you a fucking Zombie?
I,
you know,

639
00:40:47.701 --> 00:40:50.840
I'm not reading the rest of this.
This is the most ridiculous fucking die,

640
00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:53.250
but you know what,
maybe this people interested,
I'll keep reading.

641
00:40:53.251 --> 00:40:56.410
This is the dumbest thing that sounds like a Scott bail movie from the

642
00:40:56.411 --> 00:41:01.210
[inaudible].
Liz was this the original draft of zapped?
Um,

643
00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:02.700
somebody 43 years old,

644
00:41:02.701 --> 00:41:07.190
just fucking did a spit take on the dashboard with that reference.
Um,

645
00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.253
what the hell am I?

646
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.050
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

647
00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:12.880
<v 6>I have also fingered her as well.</v>

648
00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.133
Stupidest thing.

649
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:23.040
The one that I am least proud of is that I apparently licked my own TJ's offer

650
00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:26.920
boobs after all,
after coming

651
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.370
capital letters all in my sleep.

652
00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:34.090
Dude is the most

653
00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:37.310
<v 4>bizarre fucking thing I've ever read.
Okay.</v>

654
00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:42.550
<v 6>My girlfriend is actually really cool.
Hey,
you asleep and it's fine honey.</v>

655
00:41:42.551 --> 00:41:46.700
Go like this.
No,
on the other side.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You got a little more,
are there,
uh,

656
00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.670
at this,
at first she'll be really startled because she is sleeping too.

657
00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:55.180
If I'm going down are in my sleep,
she generally,

658
00:41:55.181 --> 00:41:57.700
let's keep going until she comes.

659
00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.910
I'll usually wake up as she's coming.

660
00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:05.620
We'll have sex and we'll both go back to sleep.
Oh,

661
00:42:05.621 --> 00:42:09.850
Jesus Christ the,
I swear to God people.
There's two more paragraphs of this shit.

662
00:42:09.851 --> 00:42:10.870
Do you want me to keep going?

663
00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.300
The scary part to me is the fear of not having control over my body and my

664
00:42:16.301 --> 00:42:16.960
actions.

665
00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:21.190
I'm scared because I have clearly shown my ability to perform complete tasks

666
00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:25.840
while being completely asleep and having absolutely no memory of them later.

667
00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:29.290
I'm afraid that one day I'll find myself waking up,

668
00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.210
driving my car down the highway.

669
00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:36.640
I haven't shown myself doing anything dangerous yet.
You haven't shown my,

670
00:42:36.641 --> 00:42:39.040
you haven't found yourself,
but who knows,
right.

671
00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:43.750
The only reason I do know about the times it has happened so far is because my

672
00:42:43.751 --> 00:42:45.730
girlfriend has been there to tell me it happened.

673
00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:50.800
Who knows what crazy shit I've done before I met her in my sleep that I'll never

674
00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:52.480
know about.
My girlfriend says,

675
00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:56.440
I'm just being paranoid and then I should let it be.
Wait a minute,

676
00:42:56.770 --> 00:42:59.230
you fucking came on your girlfriend's tits,

677
00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:03.760
licked your own jazz off of him and she's like,
Oh,
you're just big paranoid.

678
00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:08.440
Is this the white chick from every fucking horror movie?

679
00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:13.810
Um,
I don't think that noise is anything to be concerned about.

680
00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:20.320
Um,
what would you do?
Would you go see a therapist or a doctor for this?

681
00:43:20.321 --> 00:43:24.610
So would you just let it go?
I really don't.
Don't,
yeah,
this is beyond,
he goes,

682
00:43:24.611 --> 00:43:26.830
I really don't want to be,
go to a doctor with a bunch of pills.

683
00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:29.080
You know what I would email Mike Birbiglia.

684
00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:33.940
I actually think I vaguely remember him talking about walking over to a window

685
00:43:33.941 --> 00:43:38.350
or something,
you know,
and doing something.

686
00:43:38.351 --> 00:43:43.120
I can't remember.
You know,
I don't,
I don't remember.
I would email him.
Oh,

687
00:43:43.121 --> 00:43:45.640
why don't,
yeah.
Why don't you fuck what?
Yeah.
Go to another comedian now.

688
00:43:45.641 --> 00:43:47.770
Fuck that.
Go.
Go talk to a professional.

689
00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:49.373
<v 4>All right.</v>

690
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:55.410
<v 6>Jesus Christ.
If that's,
if that's real.</v>

691
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.870
Is it real son?
Is it really real son?
Um,

692
00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:04.470
that's one of the big things in hip hop.
Everybody's got it.
Yo,
this is real shot.

693
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:05.623
This rail.

694
00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:10.490
This is like the cities where it's like,
dude,

695
00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:15.230
it's all real me laying on a bed right now doing a podcast in Jacksonville.

696
00:44:15.231 --> 00:44:19.020
That's also real.
Everything's real son.

697
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:04.720
All right.
All right.
Last week,
last week,

698
00:45:04.721 --> 00:45:08.500
I was laughing my ass off reading this thing where this guy was trying to claim

699
00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:10.493
<v 4>mmm.</v>

700
00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:15.890
<v 6>That,
that sleep,
sex shit.
You know,</v>

701
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:20.790
basically he's asleep and he just starts having sex with his fucking,
yeah,

702
00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.220
<v 4>a girlfriend</v>

703
00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:29.030
<v 6>and he's completely asleep.
He's totally asleep.
I just,</v>

704
00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.570
evidently this is somebody says,
hey bill,
this does exist.

705
00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:35.570
This does happen to me at least a dozen times a year.

706
00:45:35.571 --> 00:45:36.590
That's what somebody wrote in.

707
00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:38.293
<v 4>MMM.</v>

708
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:40.780
<v 6>Listen to this one.
It bill,</v>

709
00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:44.020
I feel compelled to write to you this email after hearing the Monday morning

710
00:45:44.021 --> 00:45:47.590
podcast this morning.
I know the guys sleep sex story sounds insane,

711
00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:51.670
but I can tell you that it's a 100% a real thing.
Hear me out.

712
00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:55.150
This is so fucking nuts.
Somebody else told me that there was somebody,

713
00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:56.490
<v 4>okay.</v>

714
00:45:56.490 --> 00:46:01.110
<v 6>Who fucking was asleep,
woke up,
didn't wake up,
got up like a fucking Zombie,</v>

715
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:04.410
got in the car,
drove across town,

716
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:08.610
murdered somebody and came back and got off because they were asleep.

717
00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:10.923
<v 4>Okay.</v>

718
00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:17.000
<v 6>You can't drive a car when you're fucking asleep.
This is bullshit.</v>

719
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:21.130
I don't,
I don't give a fuck if there's a scientific name for that.

720
00:46:21.131 --> 00:46:25.300
Are Your eyes open then you were awake?
Well,

721
00:46:25.301 --> 00:46:29.860
you're driving down the street with,
would you fucking eyes closed?

722
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:32.833
<v 4>You know,</v>

723
00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:37.520
<v 6>are these these people like supernatural being that a witches,</v>

724
00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.880
what are they doing?
Why are they having sex?

725
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.850
Why don't they wake up and do like fucking a,
they start,
you know,

726
00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:47.390
scrubbing the floor.
Why do they always go do something fun?

727
00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:48.940
<v 4>Okay.</v>

728
00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:51.790
<v 6>Like get laid or kill somebody that's annoying them.</v>

729
00:46:51.791 --> 00:46:54.790
How come they never do anything miserable?
Oh my God,
I got fucking,

730
00:46:54.791 --> 00:46:55.660
you know I was,

731
00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:02.530
I've reached shingled the roof for my neighbor.
Yeah,
it's just bullshit.

732
00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:05.680
It's just fucking bullshit.
Fuck all you guys.
I'll read it.

733
00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:07.000
I'll try to have an open mind.

734
00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:12.370
Here's another guy who suffers from a getting laid while he's sleeping in

735
00:47:12.371 --> 00:47:15.490
college.
I was dating a girl who would do the same thing.

736
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:17.590
I started spending the night at her place,

737
00:47:17.591 --> 00:47:20.650
which was closer to campus than my dorm.

738
00:47:20.651 --> 00:47:25.030
One night I came back really late after driving back to college from home.

739
00:47:25.031 --> 00:47:25.864
I walked in.

740
00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:30.270
I heard a loud moaning like someone was having sex thinking see was sheeting.

741
00:47:30.271 --> 00:47:34.180
I'll be a bus into room to beat the shit out of whoever's she was fucking,

742
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.640
which is hilarious.

743
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:39.370
Why would you beat the shit out of that person unless they knew you and knew

744
00:47:39.371 --> 00:47:40.420
that you were in a relationship.

745
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.600
The guys just doing what he's supposed to be doing.
He's trying to get laid.

746
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:48.790
You should go in there and fucking call the girl a whore and then leave miss

747
00:47:48.791 --> 00:47:50.620
direct that anger.
Anyways,
he goes,

748
00:47:50.621 --> 00:47:54.790
I walked in only to find her by herself in bed naked from the waist down.

749
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:57.010
Fingering the hell out of herself.

750
00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:00.023
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

751
00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:03.560
<v 6>So he goes,
so I walked over thinking I could get in on the action.</v>

752
00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:05.800
<v 4>Okay.</v>

753
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:10.570
<v 6>And her eyes were closed and she wouldn't respond to me talking to her dude.</v>

754
00:48:10.571 --> 00:48:13.620
What kind of fucking Blair witch?
Uh,

755
00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:17.020
the extra assistance is fucking creepy.

756
00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:19.840
You walk in or eyes are closed.

757
00:48:19.841 --> 00:48:24.250
He's like in a Zombie state finger blast in herself.
And your first thought is,

758
00:48:24.251 --> 00:48:25.810
hey,
maybe I can get in on the action.

759
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:31.810
That right there just shows the weakness of a man.

760
00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.960
The fact that he can go from that level of rage.

761
00:48:34.961 --> 00:48:35.990
I would've beat the fuck out whoever,

762
00:48:35.991 --> 00:48:38.590
whoever's bagging my girl to two seconds later,
like,
hey,

763
00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:43.240
maybe I can help you out with that layer.
A little lady.
Uh,

764
00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:45.910
anyways,
once she finished,

765
00:48:45.911 --> 00:48:49.330
she seemed to fall asleep immediately thinking this was crazy.

766
00:48:49.331 --> 00:48:51.880
I woke her up and asked her what the fuck was going on.

767
00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:56.500
She admitted that this happens sometimes,
not very often,
but sometimes.

768
00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:01.180
And she never told me about it because it was embarrassing.
I was like,
okay,

769
00:49:01.181 --> 00:49:04.660
whatever.
It never really thought about it again.
Really.

770
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:10.260
You saw something that bizarre.
We're like,
hi.
Okay.

771
00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:13.150
You know,
then he never thought about it again.

772
00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.930
That sounds like that would be like so disturbing to see somebody in a Zombie

773
00:49:18.931 --> 00:49:21.990
fight state fingering themselves.
I don't think,

774
00:49:21.991 --> 00:49:24.990
I mean just me picturing what that looks like.

775
00:49:24.991 --> 00:49:29.580
I don't know if I'll ever be able to forget it.
Um,
anyway,

776
00:49:31.290 --> 00:49:35.340
now let me get to a fuck.
I'm gonna Sneeze.
God dammit.
Hang on a second.

777
00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:37.010
<v 4>Okay.</v>

778
00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:40.710
<v 6>All right.
I'm back.
I'm back here.
Um,
yeah,</v>

779
00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:44.520
like I don't think I could ever get that thought out of my head.

780
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:49.170
Oh.
I just kind of shook it off and continued on and he said,

781
00:49:49.171 --> 00:49:53.220
now let's get to where I say sleep.
Sex is real.

782
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:58.260
About three weeks later I was spending the night at her place again and I woke

783
00:49:58.261 --> 00:50:02.040
up to her talking in her sleep.
Oh my God,
dude,

784
00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:05.460
this is the creepy as shit if she's speaking in tongues.

785
00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:06.950
<v 4>Okay.</v>

786
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:10.750
<v 6>Six,
six,
600 fucking forearm.
This sounds like one of those.
The uh,</v>

787
00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:15.560
ah,
I got it all can name of the fucking movie is.
Uh,

788
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:19.040
anyways.
What the hell was I?

789
00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.660
Did we say that I woke up,

790
00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:27.070
she was talking her asleep but talking like she was having sex saying shit like

791
00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:32.360
fuck me and stuff.
But she was just talking,

792
00:50:32.361 --> 00:50:36.530
not doing anything else.
So she's sitting up in bed.

793
00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:37.980
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

794
00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:40.510
<v 6>having a fucking conversation or eyes fucking dot.
Oh,</v>

795
00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:43.560
like rolling around in a fucking head.
This is a creepy as shit ever.

796
00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:48.750
Do you guys sleep in like a pyramid?
Is she like,
like she like fucking cursed.

797
00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:53.220
This sounds like some shit that would only happen like in an Indiana Jones
movie.

798
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.153
<v 4>MMM.</v>

799
00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:59.850
<v 6>So he goes,
so I decided to wake her up or let her know what she was doing.</v>

800
00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:04.740
I leaned over and kind of shook her softly,
you know,
saying,
Hey,

801
00:51:04.741 --> 00:51:08.500
wake up.
Wake up.
Instead of waking up,
she rolled toward me

802
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:14.040
the Zombie.
Ah.
Fuck man.
Fuck man.

803
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:20.470
That's the fucking exercise.
Yeah.
Saki.
Dag.

804
00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:24.360
Ah.
Um,
oh God.
I always forget that I'm in New York.

805
00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:28.500
I can't imagine what my fucking
fucking neighbors are thinking right now.

806
00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:30.900
Instead of waking up,
she rolled toward me.

807
00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:33.130
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

808
00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:37.150
<v 6>They put her hands down my pants and started jerking me off and kissing me.
See,</v>

809
00:51:37.151 --> 00:51:38.890
this is where it goes out the window.

810
00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:40.270
<v 4>Okay.</v>

811
00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:43.440
<v 6>This is where it goes out.
It's a jerky.
Oh Dude.</v>

812
00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:47.350
This is where it goes out the fucking window for me.
If you're asleep,

813
00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.410
how do you know where the where everything is?

814
00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:52.600
<v 4>Okay.</v>

815
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:56.300
<v 6>Oh,
I'm asleep and I'm walking up to the garage,
not bumping into anything.</v>

816
00:51:56.301 --> 00:52:00.420
Grabbing the keys.
I gotta go kill that neighbor.

817
00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:04.170
Give me a fucking break.
This is the dumbest Shit I've ever heard in my life.

818
00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:08.220
This isn't real.
So she wrote,

819
00:52:08.221 --> 00:52:12.320
source has jerking me off,
kissing me,
and then still in her,
in her sleep said,

820
00:52:12.321 --> 00:52:14.150
are you going to fuck the or what?

821
00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:22.460
And he goes,
well shit.
How can I turn that down?
How could you turn it down?

822
00:52:22.461 --> 00:52:24.920
Because your fucking eyes are rolling up in her head.

823
00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:29.080
Dude.
Isn't this like a form of rape?

824
00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:31.060
<v 4>Okay.</v>

825
00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:34.990
<v 6>If she's asleep and your bag and her,
I mean that's just what if,</v>

826
00:52:34.991 --> 00:52:38.290
what if you didn't know her?
She walks up and back me back bay,

827
00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:42.310
walking around fucking pajamas out in the lawn,
pulled up in a car.

828
00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:45.520
This is the creepiest Shit I've ever read about.

829
00:52:45.521 --> 00:52:49.420
Am I in my five years of doing this podcast,
this is the creepiest shit ever.

830
00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:54.790
This is Linda Blair.
Linda Blair is a porn star.

831
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:58.630
So she goes,
you're going to fuck me?
Or what if the guy goes,
well,
shit,

832
00:52:58.660 --> 00:52:59.950
how can I turn that down?

833
00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:04.750
I started to take my pants off and her still sleeping.

834
00:53:04.751 --> 00:53:09.110
Started stripping in the bed.
See this?

835
00:53:09.111 --> 00:53:12.950
This all has like a,
I'm awake kind of thing or possessed one or the other.

836
00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:17.810
He goes,
we started going at it,
but the whole time her eyes were still closed,

837
00:53:17.811 --> 00:53:21.770
but it was like she was awake,
grabbing onto me,
kissing me moaning.

838
00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.920
It was totally crazy.
Then the craziest thing,

839
00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:30.870
so this girl was one of those more reserve types.

840
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:33.510
We never really had dirty sex suit.

841
00:53:33.511 --> 00:53:37.650
If you bang this girl in the ass while she's fucking in this zombified state,

842
00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:41.340
um,
I,
I don't know what to tell you.

843
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.900
<v 4>Okay.</v>

844
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:46.890
<v 6>He goes,
we never really had dirty sex or anything.
It was still really good,</v>

845
00:53:46.891 --> 00:53:50.610
but nothing out of the ordinary except tonight.
All of a sudden,

846
00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:51.950
<v 4>okay,</v>

847
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:55.790
<v 6>while we're going at it,
she flips over onto her knees and says,</v>

848
00:53:55.791 --> 00:54:00.530
put it in my ass.
Like,
God,
dude,
fuck you guys.

849
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:02.360
Did you guys all get together and just say,

850
00:54:02.361 --> 00:54:06.410
let's fuck with bill and let's just write the craziest fucking emails.
Average.

851
00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:09.890
Is there some sort of website where you guys are doing this?
I,
this is not real.

852
00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:15.040
This isn't real.
He goes,
what the fuck?

853
00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:19.420
I above fucking fell over.
Never had we even talked about it or anything,

854
00:54:19.421 --> 00:54:24.100
and all of a sudden she was doing things she had never done,
at least with me,

855
00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:26.380
without even seeming like it was new.

856
00:54:26.381 --> 00:54:30.310
She just acted like it happens all the fucking time.
Dude,
if you do this,

857
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:32.860
<v 4>okay,</v>

858
00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:35.170
<v 6>why don't you wake her up?
It'd be like,
sweetheart,</v>

859
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:38.620
just to let you know that you were asleep right now telling me to put my dick in

860
00:54:38.621 --> 00:54:39.760
your ass.
I,
you know,

861
00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:42.280
are you comfortable with going back to sleep and letting me do that?

862
00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:48.230
I'm just checking.
Alright.
Nighty night.

863
00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:52.700
Um,
anyways,
it was one of the craziest nights of sex I ever had.
Dude,

864
00:54:52.701 --> 00:54:54.260
you're a fucking creep.

865
00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:01.710
You're a fucking creep dude.
You're a fucking creep.
Okay.

866
00:55:01.711 --> 00:55:05.970
If I was with somebody and they were a Zombie,
I would wake them up.
All right.

867
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:13.380
You had fucking anal sex with this girl when she was like awake,
asleep,
awake,

868
00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:18.000
asleep,
whatever the fuck they did.
The medical version of this is fucking insane.

869
00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:21.753
Uh,

870
00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:27.330
the next morning she woke up and didn't mention a thing about it at all it all

871
00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:32.110
day.
So I finally decided to bring it up.
Oh,
that's a good move.
Hey,

872
00:55:32.111 --> 00:55:33.700
by the way,
last night when you were sleeping,

873
00:55:33.701 --> 00:55:36.670
but kind of we're awake but we're asleep.
Ah,
I,

874
00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:40.210
I put it in your ass if you wondered why Ya,
you know,

875
00:55:40.211 --> 00:55:41.830
you felt a little weird this morning.
Yeah.

876
00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:46.090
Cause I have Jesus.
He goes,

877
00:55:46.091 --> 00:55:50.590
I told her what happened and at first she was pretty pissed.
Yeah,

878
00:55:50.591 --> 00:55:54.520
I would think so.
But then after talking about it for a few minutes,

879
00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:59.680
she admitted that this had happened a few times before where she said sex in

880
00:55:59.681 --> 00:56:03.250
asleep with someone,
including her sister's boyfriend.
Wow.

881
00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:09.150
That's what he wrote.
And I would've said that anyways.
Do,

882
00:56:09.151 --> 00:56:12.870
so the boyfriend banged once she was sleeping or sister's boyfriend's at that

883
00:56:12.871 --> 00:56:14.100
this is like rape guys.

884
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.730
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

885
00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:19.720
<v 6>This is fucking nuts.
She's not in a place where she can say no,</v>

886
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:22.000
she's dreaming about something else.

887
00:56:22.001 --> 00:56:25.460
If this shit even exists is the creepiest fucking email ever.
Oh,

888
00:56:25.461 --> 00:56:26.380
when it keeps going,

889
00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:30.570
she started crying and saying she didn't know what to do.

890
00:56:30.571 --> 00:56:34.110
So I offered to go with her to a therapist and at least approached the topic

891
00:56:34.111 --> 00:56:38.190
with the professional or aren't you just a fucking great guy after you banged

892
00:56:38.191 --> 00:56:39.810
her in the ass while she was sleeping,

893
00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:45.360
the therapist said she may have sexsomnia.

894
00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:50.250
That was the term she used.
Seriously,
look it up.

895
00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:54.600
Or a sleep disorder where a person actually has sex in their sleep.

896
00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:00.150
Yeah,
go,
fuck you sexsomnia that now.
Now,
fuck you.
I'm not,

897
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:01.223
I'm not buying this.

898
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.580
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

899
00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:07.330
<v 6>The therapist said it's more common than people think.
No,</v>

900
00:57:07.331 --> 00:57:10.780
it isn't.
No,
it isn't.
None of my friends to have this story.

901
00:57:10.781 --> 00:57:11.680
They would have told me,

902
00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:17.260
and that is treatable only in some cases she got on some medication.

903
00:57:17.261 --> 00:57:18.640
It seemed to help a little,

904
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:22.810
but there were a few times when shit happened in her sleep and no,

905
00:57:22.811 --> 00:57:27.310
those times I did not bang her in her sleep after that one time.

906
00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:31.600
It's just didn't feel right since it was something she had no control over.

907
00:57:31.601 --> 00:57:32.434
Really.

908
00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:42.030
It took you after that first time,
so instead I would wake her up.

909
00:57:42.031 --> 00:57:43.770
That's what you should have done the first time.

910
00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:45.210
<v 4>Okay.</v>

911
00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:46.830
<v 6>Jesus Christ.
Anyways,</v>

912
00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:51.120
just wanted to send you this email so he didn't think the sleep sex guy was a

913
00:57:51.121 --> 00:57:53.550
total psycho.
Go Fuck Yourself.

914
00:57:53.551 --> 00:57:56.370
I downloaded your latest special love that catch you later.
Well,

915
00:57:56.371 --> 00:58:01.030
thank you for downloading this special.
Uh,
as far as your,
uh,

916
00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:02.640
<v 4>yeah,</v>

917
00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:06.330
<v 6>chivalrous acts after you fucking went anal on that girl.</v>

918
00:58:06.331 --> 00:58:07.470
I don't know about that man.

919
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:10.103
<v 4>Wow.</v>

920
00:58:11.050 --> 00:58:13.960
<v 6>Well there you go.
People.
That was worth the price of admission,
Huh?</v>

921
00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:18.060
I still don't believe it.
Sexsomnia

922
00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:23.430
at the very least.
It's not common.
I W I would have heard something about it.

923
00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:27.900
Okay.
I'm down.
Like I'm acting like I'm a doctor right now.
I am down,

924
00:58:27.901 --> 00:58:31.980
I am in the medical field.
I'm up to my knees and it,

925
00:58:31.981 --> 00:58:32.820
I would have heard something.

926
00:58:32.821 --> 00:58:34.440
I would have heard some sort of study by and I don't know.

927
00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:35.453
<v 4>Right.</v>

928
00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:28.080
<v 6>A professor wants to bank,
hey bill,</v>

929
00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:32.820
I'm a 19 year old male college freshmen and my professor wants to have sex.

930
00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:39.560
I'm sorry that wasn't me.
That was somebody else yelling,
okay,

931
00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:40.490
I'm going to be a professional.

932
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:46.130
I kept getting these signs ever since the first few weeks of class began.

933
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:50.870
You're 19,
you're an adult,
right.
And I'm not really,
I can't get in trouble here.

934
00:59:50.871 --> 00:59:55.640
Right.
Um,
I noticed anytime I am running late to class by a few minutes,

935
00:59:55.641 --> 00:59:58.460
she would always wait for me to start class

936
01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.550
through get to the good part.
What does she look like?

937
01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.640
Every time I walked in and she would say things like,
oh,

938
01:00:05.641 --> 01:00:10.620
I was worried you were sick and I was worried you were going to miss my class.

939
01:00:10.621 --> 01:00:15.120
Jesus.
She's putting it out there right in front of the whole class.
Um,

940
01:00:15.121 --> 01:00:19.710
anytime any l anyone else's late to class,
she ignores them and starts on time.

941
01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:25.350
Well,
wait a minute to it.
Or you're the teacher's pet,
you know,
when she says sal,

942
01:00:25.351 --> 01:00:29.120
did everybody do the reading last night?
Do we have any,

943
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:33.420
any thoughts on the,
um,
the assigned material?

944
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:36.990
Everyone just sits there staring at her,
chewing their gum slowly.

945
01:00:36.991 --> 01:00:41.340
And you actually put your,
your,
your hand up.
Oh,
Michael,
what do you have to say?

946
01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:46.110
I found it.
I thought it was brave.
I thought it was,
it was exquisite,

947
01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:50.670
you know?
All right.
Let me wanting to just read the rest of us here.
Um,
anytime.

948
01:00:50.671 --> 01:00:53.940
Anyone else's late to class,
she ignores them.
Starts on time.
Okay.

949
01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:57.930
She is always over the top.
Nice to me when we see each other.

950
01:00:58.230 --> 01:01:01.920
I brushed this off and I didn't let it get big in my head.

951
01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:04.950
All right.
So He's,
he's,
he's,
he's like,

952
01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:07.140
he's not thinking that this is going to happen.
Okay.

953
01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:11.700
A telltale sign came to me one day when I was small.

954
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:15.330
I was at the smoking section on the campus after I left her class,

955
01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:20.810
I cheated word for word from the girl that sits next to me in class on a test I

956
01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:22.110
had just finished.

957
01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:26.340
The girl that sits next to me came down to the smoking section with the bag of

958
01:01:26.341 --> 01:01:28.500
chocolate in her hand and gave it to me.

959
01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:32.550
She told me our professor gave it to her to give to me.

960
01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:37.520
Yeah.
Boy,
they're trying to bang.

961
01:01:37.521 --> 01:01:39.890
Your teacher is like trying to get away with a murder.

962
01:01:39.891 --> 01:01:42.920
The more people who are involved,
the bigger chance you have of getting caught.

963
01:01:42.921 --> 01:01:46.800
So what the fuck is she'd given this girl chalk the for bringing her in the
fall.

964
01:01:46.801 --> 01:01:51.000
Fox.
She wants a threesome,
right?
Is this,

965
01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:54.360
where is this where it's going?
Please tell me it's going in this direction.

966
01:01:54.930 --> 01:01:57.730
This is like a red shoe diaries.
Um,

967
01:01:57.750 --> 01:02:01.680
I asked the girl if our professor gave the chocolate to the class when I left

968
01:02:01.681 --> 01:02:05.250
and she said,
no,
I tried to keep calm

969
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:09.960
that you would say as my Dick was filling up,

970
01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:15.210
I try to keep calm and asked the girl how she did on the test.
Um,

971
01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:18.870
I told her I copied her word for word and she said she thinks she did.

972
01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:20.341
A few minutes later,

973
01:02:20.341 --> 01:02:24.090
our professor came down to the smoking section where her car was parked.

974
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.630
The girl asked the professor what,
what she made.

975
01:02:27.631 --> 01:02:31.620
And the professor tells us she made a 74.
When I asked her,

976
01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:36.690
she flipped her hair,
smirked at me and told me I made a 94.

977
01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.153
<v 2>Wow.</v>

978
01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.870
<v 6>Okay.
I'm going to tell you right now.
Right fucking now if this happens,
dude,</v>

979
01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:49.010
you were two condoms.
This woman is reckless.

980
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:53.520
Okay.
Go ahead and bang.

981
01:02:53.521 --> 01:02:56.310
You're fucking teacher to do it towards the end of the semester.

982
01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:03.260
So bad.
Anyways,
she's 36 years old and divorced.

983
01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.193
<v 2>MMM.</v>

984
01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:10.990
<v 6>On this certain website.
Wherever Denley people can uh,</v>

985
01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:15.950
basically rate their teachers.
The students rated her as hot.

986
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:21.080
I want to ask her out to lunch sometime.
Dope.
She's 36.

987
01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:26.420
Just fucker.
She didn't want to go to lunch.
She's 36.
She wants lunch.

988
01:03:26.421 --> 01:03:30.450
She'll buy our own lunch.
But that's,
you know,
you're 19.
I keep forgetting it.

989
01:03:30.451 --> 01:03:31.020
Anyways,

990
01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:34.590
the only reason why I haven't asked her out yet is because she told me she has a

991
01:03:34.591 --> 01:03:37.260
13 year old daughter.
We or

992
01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:38.800
<v 2>oh,
okay.</v>

993
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:43.630
<v 6>That's the sound of her vagina.
She already had a kid.
[inaudible] Oh,
uh,</v>

994
01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.750
Mike,
my question to you is,
would it be wrong?

995
01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:50.180
There are other girls I have met,

996
01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:54.830
but they are the typical dumb whores you find in college.
Okay.

997
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:56.083
All of them.

998
01:03:57.070 --> 01:03:57.430
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

999
01:03:57.430 --> 01:04:01.240
<v 6>I wouldn't think every girl is a dumb whore.
Is every guy a dumb jock.</v>

1000
01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:06.490
Does every jog dumb?
See what happens when we talk in absolutes.

1001
01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:10.180
Um,
I am not saying I want to marry this broad,

1002
01:04:10.181 --> 01:04:14.470
just a one night stand with the history.
The professor would be nice.

1003
01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:19.390
I am not the type of guy that likes to go around and fuck as many girls as I

1004
01:04:19.391 --> 01:04:22.300
made.
That is why I keep thinking that she has,

1005
01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:25.780
that she has a daughter and I should probably stay away.
What do you think?

1006
01:04:27.110 --> 01:04:27.970
<v 2>MMM.</v>

1007
01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:31.520
<v 6>I don't know dude.</v>

1008
01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:37.780
The fact that you hit yet did you don't want to fucking do what I,
I don't know.

1009
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:41.703
Well listen,

1010
01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:46.360
do you know how to bang a girl and then fucking see you the next day and have it

1011
01:04:46.361 --> 01:04:48.430
all be cool that that's a skill,
you know,

1012
01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:52.360
and not have her feel like you used her or whatever,

1013
01:04:53.530 --> 01:04:55.060
you know?
Do you know how to do that?

1014
01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:56.673
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1015
01:04:57.510 --> 01:05:00.000
<v 6>I can tell you one thing you don't want to do is,
what I would do was,</v>

1016
01:05:00.001 --> 01:05:03.000
was the next day I'd be like,
Hey,
I'll fucking weird.

1017
01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.730
And then they get mad and the next thing you know,

1018
01:05:05.731 --> 01:05:08.550
all of their friends are fucking looking at you like you're a Dosha and they

1019
01:05:08.551 --> 01:05:13.380
start drawn right and shit on your locker.
US A fucking nightmare.

1020
01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:14.423
Um,

1021
01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:15.680
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1022
01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.050
<v 6>If you've mastered the Yarra,
how to somebody and not be a,
yeah,
I don't,</v>

1023
01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:23.840
you know something dude.
If you're going to fuck this girl,

1024
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:27.740
you have to do it at the end of the semester.
Once it's over.

1025
01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:34.130
Um,
this girl,
she's reckless.
She's a nightmare.
If she's fucking putting this out,

1026
01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:39.060
it's unbelievably unprofessional.
She should be way more discreet.
Alright?

1027
01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:42.980
And you cheated on this girl word for word she gave you 20 points are,

1028
01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:45.280
you know what dude?
Stay away from this girl.
This girl is,

1029
01:05:45.281 --> 01:05:48.470
is she's going to get fucking pregnant and you don't want it to be you.

1030
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:52.340
All right.
Who doesn't want to fuck a teacher?
Everybody does,

1031
01:05:52.341 --> 01:05:54.870
but she knows something.
You don't want to have a fucking eat it.

1032
01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:59.420
I wouldn't do it.
I wouldn't do it.
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

1033
01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.273
Stay away.

1034
01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:05.720
Why don't you go meet some nice girls to stop talking to dumb horse and,

1035
01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:11.240

1036
01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:13.250

You know,

Okay.
All right.</v>

1037
01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:42.910
Okay.
