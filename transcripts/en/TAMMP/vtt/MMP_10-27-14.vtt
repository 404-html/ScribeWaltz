00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.700
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.900
October 27th,
2014 and a fuck you,

3
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.310
we'll put a,
I'm actually recording this thing late.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.130
I'm recording it late and then I got to go to work.

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.170
I gotta go to work or Billy Day job.
Oh Billy Day job.

6
00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:23.730
But oh Billy burning in a pole fence.
You know,

7
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.780
something's got to give.
Why does it always have to be out?

8
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.770
He you put your work first.
Um,

9
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.890
anyways,
uh,
I don't know what the fuck that was.

10
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.970
I am sitting here as you can tell by the echo,
echo,
echo.
Maybe you can't hear it,

11
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:42.600
but I can hear it.

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.840
I'm sitting in my living room because I'm doing this Monday morning,

13
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.610
eight 30 my time.

14
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.290
So this is still a Monday morning podcast where I'm from despite all use selfish

15
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:56.580
Douche bags around the globe,
around the planet,

16
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.523
you know,

17
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.310
and people took that thing and the nose on this beautiful bill blue sphere that

18
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:03.930
we called mother earth.
I just,

19
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:05.340
well lets me know when somebody's going to lie to you.

20
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.310
They start shaking their head when they're given the stage.

21
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.090
I want to thank everybody for gathering here today.
Wow.
High got Italia.

22
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:13.800
That you know what we got coming in.

23
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:15.840
I often they start shaking their fucking head,
you know,

24
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.040
trying to charisma their way through fucking stealing all the tax dollars.

25
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.900
Um,
anyways,
I didn't do,

26
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.280
I didn't do shit this weekend.
I didn't do any standup did I?
No,

27
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.500
I didn't.
I just fucking stayed in trying to catch up on my goddamn sleep here.

28
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.760
But I've been doing stand up during the week and I got a big standup gig coming

29
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:46.120
up.
I'm doing a the 20th,
um,

30
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.580
annual,
uh,
comics come home benefit for our cam Neely,

31
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.320
the Cam Nealy House,
uh,

32
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.250
put together by Denis leary and the always adorable Jimmy Serpico.
Oh,

33
00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:58.084
he's adorable.

34
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.500
I challenge you to find a picture of Jim Serpico where he doesn't look

35
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:06.360
absolutely adorable.
That is an adorable middle aged man.
Um,

36
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.320
I got that coming up,

37
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:10.230
so I got to make sure I'm on my game because I'm going to be following a bunch

38
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:14.040
of monsters.
I think I'm going on the last,
you know,

39
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.790
and that is the deal on those things.
You don't headline one of those,

40
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:22.530
you go on last because you're going on after all headliners.
So,

41
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.370
um,
it's not a lot of meat left on the bone,
if you know what I mean.

42
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.510
I can't really see myself 10 comics in being able to bring up a bowler and it's

43
00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:35.520
still a fresh topic,
if you know what I mean.
Right.

44
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.950
That's why I'm doing a bit on the mumps.
Yeah,
the forgotten one,

45
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.140
dude.
I gotta be honest with you.
I am so fucking sick of all these diseases.

46
00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:51.141
Grand standing during sports in every fucking police should go like it's,

47
00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:52.381
it's all this,

48
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:56.580
this got their marketing diseases now because they're trying to get your money

49
00:02:56.581 --> 00:03:00.130
for research somewhere in there.
I know there's a good thought,

50
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:04.600
like they're trying to cure the disease,
but there's a lot of Lexuses.
Lexis is,

51
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.700
this is is being bought off of that money.

52
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:10.540
You can't tell me that there isn't because I don't give a fuck how much you give

53
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:13.750
a shit about stopping the disease at some point.

54
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.840
You want a nice house and you want a nice car and if all you do is try to find a

55
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:20.800
cure for that fucking thing at some point

56
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.270
<v 1>been to the Aspirin Fund,
right?</v>

57
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.210
<v 0>Jesus fucking Christ.
The combination of this and the and the and the,</v>

58
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:32.160
the the fucking getting reprimanded.
When you watch a football game,
no more,

59
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.980
no more,
no more go fuck yourself.

60
00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:38.370
I'm not hitting anybody the fuck off my TV.

61
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.030
<v 1>You fucking dope.</v>

62
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.550
What do you think that some wife beater at home who's going to see the

63
00:03:43.551 --> 00:03:45.830
commercial and then be like,
oh,
okay,

64
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.450
you just going to erase 20 years of bad parenting with some dumb fucking

65
00:03:50.451 --> 00:03:54.770
commercial with your black shirts on.
It drives me up the fucking wall.

66
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.270
You talking to me like I'm two years old and you're also talking about this,

67
00:03:59.271 --> 00:04:03.260
this major fucking problem as if it's like,
you know,

68
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.920
why don't you just fucking hire one of those planes with the banner across it

69
00:04:06.921 --> 00:04:09.380
and just tell society how the fuck this supposed to behave?

70
00:04:09.381 --> 00:04:13.400
I'm sure that'll solve something to add and know.
Just fucking drives me nuts.

71
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.350
The whole fucking thing drives me up the fucking wall.

72
00:04:15.351 --> 00:04:18.410
Stand for cancer and everybody's standing up with a name of somebody that they

73
00:04:18.411 --> 00:04:21.620
had.
All right.
Who doesn't want to stop cancer?

74
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.300
Who doesn't give to it?

75
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.400
Do you got to interrupt a fucking the world series to remind me that there's

76
00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:34.020
people dying of cancer?
Sports is supposed to be my safe haven.

77
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.250
Maybe my Golick was right.
I mean,
I mean,
I mean,
I mean,

78
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.250
it's my Mike Golic.
That's my Mike Gull Lake.

79
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.970
That guy is a stammering jackass.
You know?

80
00:04:50.971 --> 00:04:53.790
You know you're dumb when you have to constantly bring up the smart school.

81
00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:57.120
You went to
fucking dust.

82
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.980
<v 0>I know what you can a lot of you guys to think of right now.
Bill,</v>

83
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.000
have you been smoking along to cigars lately?
Is that what it's for?
The uh,

84
00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:09.810
the cough.
I have not.
All right.
Oh,
freckles here actually went.

85
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.320
I've gone eight days without a cigar and now it's out of my system.

86
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.740
<v 1>I don't crave it right now.
I let the humidor dwindled down.</v>

87
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.650
Is that the right word?
Human door?

88
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.213
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

89
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.070
<v 1>I say humidifies via voice.</v>

90
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.010
Human doors for cigars and humidity is that thing that people who don't

91
00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:36.500
understand weather get mad at.
When somebody says it's,
it's not the heat,

92
00:05:36.501 --> 00:05:40.700
it's the humidity,
and then they go out.
That's like Shane,
he's not the bullet.

93
00:05:40.701 --> 00:05:44.600
It's the gun.
No,
it is.
It's no,
it isn't.
If you fucking read up on humidity,

94
00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:45.500
you dumb fuck.

95
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.490
If you got out of the East Coast and down south and you headed out west and you

96
00:05:49.491 --> 00:05:54.170
felt a dry heat versus that ungodly fucking moisture

97
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.050
that is in the air when you have,

98
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.633
<v 2>you know,</v>

99
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.790
<v 1>basically what happens is,
is when you have hot air,
that's what,</v>

100
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.100
that's what's known as a low pressure system

101
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.580
and the molecules get larger.

102
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.370
Really doesn't.
All it does is there's just really no moisture.
You know,

103
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.020
like if you live near a fucking desert,

104
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.420
it doesn't make a difference how fucking hard it is.

105
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.520
There's no fucking moisture due to extrapolate,
you know,

106
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.910
and bring to that fucking hair is essentially what's going on.
Okay.

107
00:06:32.911 --> 00:06:35.820
That's why it's awesome to fucking live out here.
Now I don't understand.

108
00:06:35.821 --> 00:06:37.080
We live near a fucking ocean.

109
00:06:37.081 --> 00:06:40.080
I don't understand how some of that water doesn't get in the air,

110
00:06:40.081 --> 00:06:43.050
but God knows it doesn't.
It does not.

111
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.620
We live right now in the Mojave desert.
I don't know what it is.
No,

112
00:06:46.621 --> 00:06:48.900
Santa Ana winds comes down to the fucking canyon.

113
00:06:48.901 --> 00:06:52.950
I think it just drives everything the fuck out like a giant hair dryer.

114
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.170
So when you out here and it's 90 degrees,

115
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.400
I mean it feels more like when you walk to your car that God has a microscope,

116
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.760
none of microscope of fucking magnifying glass right on the top of your skull.

117
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:04.653
<v 2>Right.</v>

118
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.520
<v 1>As opposed to when you're back east.
I'm still,
it's like one party.</v>

119
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.040
Your body's just like,
oh my God,
I got to get in the fucking car.

120
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.200
As opposed to when you're back east.

121
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.650
We just walking out with the arms to the straight out,

122
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.670
like he got something like your nailed to some invisible cross just walking down

123
00:07:20.671 --> 00:07:24.900
the street.
You just can't escape it.

124
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.580
You take a shower and two seconds later you're all fucking soaking wet again,

125
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.610
Bill.
We understand it all right.
I didn't even explain it well,

126
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.410
but I'm a moron anyways.
Um,

127
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:35.830
<v 2>okay,</v>

128
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.050
<v 1>and comment.</v>

129
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.973
<v 2>You hit it.</v>

130
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:45.570
<v 1>Jesus Christ,
a fucking plane.
His clothes,
he's fucking people out here are,</v>

131
00:07:45.571 --> 00:07:50.571
are lunatics the way they fly this fucking people in helicopters and airplanes,

132
00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:54.280
they fly like 800 feet above the fucking ground.
It's just like,

133
00:07:54.281 --> 00:07:57.250
where are you going to put that thing if God forbid you had a fucking engine

134
00:07:57.251 --> 00:07:59.620
failure?
Huh?

135
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:04.250
You're going to try and land here with all the fucking why is um,

136
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.220
all right,
I'm all over the place.

137
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:07.930
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

138
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.640
<v 1>I need to focus here.
Um,
anyways,
I ended up big sit down with my,</v>

139
00:08:12.641 --> 00:08:13.474
uh,

140
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:14.890
<v 2>okay.</v>

141
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:19.660
<v 1>My contractors and all that type of shit and we're finally,
uh,
on our way here.</v>

142
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:24.220
We're on our way.
We're finally getting to the final.
Uh,

143
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.530
I'd say 20% of the job.

144
00:08:26.531 --> 00:08:31.531
That's how fucked up my downstairs was slash all the other bullshit that happens

145
00:08:31.541 --> 00:08:34.690
when you're building something.
Um,
you know,

146
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.360
you know what kills me is right up the street.

147
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:42.550
Some lady bought a house and gutted the whole fucking thing and she has workers

148
00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:46.150
over there seven days a damn week.
However,

149
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.360
I know what they're doing over there.
They're flipping a fucking house.

150
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.170
I'm not flipping a house.
I'm having a hundred percent quality.
You should see,

151
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.100
you should see the fucking plumbing I got in down there.

152
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.480
All copper piping us just fine.
It's gorgeous.
It's almost,

153
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:03.870
it's almost a fucking shame that they're going to close up the walls.

154
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.840
That's how fucking beautiful the work is.

155
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.840
That's been done downstairs and this house used to basically be a house on top

156
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:15.270
and a tree fort down below.

157
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:20.650
It is now an absolute fucking fortress and some day when I go to sell this

158
00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:21.540
thing,
I can,

159
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.650
I can look the person in the eye that I'm going to sell this to as opposed to

160
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:28.080
the fucking,
I don't even know that I've,

161
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:30.260
I honestly think that people who lived here before,
I just,

162
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.270
I don't think people even understand some of them.

163
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:36.850
Some of them are actually out the fuck he over.
Okay.

164
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.730
Like whoever put that fucking tarpon downstairs to hold back four feet of dirt

165
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.440
army,
four feet high level of fucking dark.

166
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:46.800
<v 4>Okay.</v>

167
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.270
<v 1>Maybe three feet.
I don't fucking know.</v>

168
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.390
All I know now is I got a concrete barrier going all the way around like I'm

169
00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:53.220
supposed to,
everything's up to code.

170
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.500
<v 4>Okay.</v>

171
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.880
<v 1>Item master electrician come in and rewire the whole fucking place.</v>

172
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.310
I got copper pipe and going through all the guy,

173
00:10:00.311 --> 00:10:03.230
we chased the pipe all the way up as far as we could go.
You know,

174
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.370
there's a few galvanized pipes,
sections of it here or there,

175
00:10:06.371 --> 00:10:10.930
but generally speaking,
um,
you know,
if this house is going to be a,

176
00:10:10.931 --> 00:10:13.390
it's going to be rock solid and Ivan Shelly

177
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.340
<v 0>so fucking depressed with how long that this shit has been taking that.</v>

178
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.760
Um,
I,
last night I actually went on the,
uh,

179
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.070
the Internet and I was looking at other houses like,
fuck this,
I'm out.
You know,

180
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.340
you know,
like when you were in a relationship with someone that you just love.

181
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.050
Okay.
So you can't break up with them.

182
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.510
But every once in a while you just start thinking,
you know what?

183
00:10:32.511 --> 00:10:34.940
If I just went out and I bought a fucking corvette,
you know,

184
00:10:34.941 --> 00:10:38.750
and I just got a scarf or some shit and just started driving around and just

185
00:10:38.751 --> 00:10:39.584
live for me.

186
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.290
I started doing that with my house last night and I just looked at all the other

187
00:10:42.291 --> 00:10:46.220
houses and it's just like I can see it.
I can see it in all the houses I like.

188
00:10:46.221 --> 00:10:48.080
I like old houses and every one of them now,

189
00:10:48.081 --> 00:10:50.930
I don't see the beautiful house with all the character anymore.

190
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.550
You know what I see?
I see wood rot.
I see cloth wiring,
I see galvanized pipe.

191
00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:00.470
I see a gas leak,
you know?
That's,
that's all I see.
I see a fucking new roof.

192
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.310
I see flashing that wasn't put in properly.
I see all of that.

193
00:11:04.311 --> 00:11:07.430
That's all I see now.
It's all I see.
I see the cracks,

194
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.010
you know on the walls.

195
00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:10.880
<v 4>Okay.</v>

196
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.930
<v 0>No one that you know,
I see windows that aren't going to close fucking properly.</v>

197
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.620
That's what I would do.
Now when I walked in to a house,

198
00:11:17.621 --> 00:11:20.450
if I looked at a house now,
I would start opening,
closing windows.

199
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.900
I checked the water pressure,
I'd go under the house,
you know,

200
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.810
smell for gas and all of that type of shit.
Now you know something.

201
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.160
As much as I did all of that,

202
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.300
I'd still get fucked because you can't stick your head in a wall and you have no

203
00:11:32.301 --> 00:11:34.010
idea what the fuck's in there.
You've got no idea.

204
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.570
<v 1>You've got no fucking idea.</v>

205
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.840
How many times over the course of the life of that house,

206
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.490
some fucking vomit or some goddamn road and got into the fucking wall,

207
00:11:44.491 --> 00:11:49.020
chewed on what left?
A bunch of fucking shit pellets.
I'm telling you,

208
00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:50.760
<v 4>okay,</v>

209
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.570
<v 1>it's horrific.
The only thing you can do is maybe,
uh,
a brand new house,</v>

210
00:11:55.571 --> 00:11:58.840
a house that was,
uh,
just bought in case you don't know what brand new means.

211
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:02.410
And then even then,
I don't know,
something's gonna fucking happen,
you know,

212
00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.860
I dunno,
I'm soured on the whole fucking thing.

213
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:10.600
And I put my God damn life savings into downstairs and I don't think I'm ever

214
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:13.840
leaving.
That's it.
I'm fucking done.

215
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.140
All I need is a friend with the pool and I'm good.

216
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:24.340
It's fucking dust that put in the floors and downstairs,

217
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.470
which is fucking exciting and dusty all at the same time.
So anyways,

218
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.510
this is the Monday morning podcast.

219
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:36.310
My name is William Burke being very official this week.

220
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.310
And uh,
yeah,
I didn't do shit this week.
Um,
oh,
for those of you,

221
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:42.290
for those of you who are on the Internet this week,
and you might've saw a,

222
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.010
we finally announced the show that I've been telling you that I've been writing

223
00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:46.720
on.
Um,

224
00:12:46.721 --> 00:12:50.800
I actually sold an animated show to Netflix.

225
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.430
A cartoon is,
I like to call them.
Everybody calls it,
it's an animated show.

226
00:12:54.431 --> 00:12:57.970
It's animation.
It's a cartoon.
I sold a cartoon to Netflix.

227
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.950
They greenlit six episodes.
So this is a real thing.
This is coming out.

228
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.510
It's coming out.

229
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.890
Um,
uh,

230
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.900
the name of the show's calledF is for family and it's about a family in 1974.

231
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.250
All right.
It's basically,
I'm animating my childhood stories.

232
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:25.610
The people that I kind of grew up with a nobody's,
um,

233
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.620
in particular,
just sort of the way shit was back then.
And uh,

234
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:34.300
I'm working with a bunch of great people who all kind of grew up in that era
too.

235
00:13:34.301 --> 00:13:37.930
We all kind of had the same moms and dads and friends and neighbors and all that

236
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:41.380
type of shit.
So,
uh,
it's not going to lie to you.

237
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.690
It's the most work I've ever done in this business.

238
00:13:43.691 --> 00:13:47.380
But also what has been the most fun of anything that I've ever done.

239
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.440
And I can't wait for you guys to see it unfortunately because it is animation.

240
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:56.260
It's not going to be out until a year from December,

241
00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.130
which coincidentally enough I think is when they're going to finish the bottom

242
00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:02.920
of my house.
So it's all gonna come together for me next year,

243
00:14:02.921 --> 00:14:07.570
next year in 2015 December.
Yeah.
Come Santa Claus.

244
00:14:07.571 --> 00:14:10.270
Here comes Santa Claus right down Santa Claus Lane.

245
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.350
Billy's bass man is fucking fanish and he's got a show.

246
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:19.430
Please fucking watch it.
Please fucking watch it.
So I make money,
dope up,

247
00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.840
a doable do pool.
And then I'll have to buy a roof.
All right.
Um,

248
00:14:22.841 --> 00:14:27.700
so that's coming out.
Yeah.
Are you a year from this?

249
00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.470
December is when it's coming out.

250
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.010
I Dunno why they announce it as soon as they do,
but,
uh,
we got a great cast.

251
00:14:33.011 --> 00:14:37.590
We got Laura dern is going to play.
My wife Justin Long is playing.
My son,
uh,

252
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.780
David Kempner is playing my boss and uh,

253
00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:44.230
they're all absolutely fucking hilarious and we got a bunch of other people,

254
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:50.010
um,
doing voices on there.
And uh,
like I said,
it's the most fun I've,
I've,

255
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.120
other than doing stand up,
it's the most fun I had.

256
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.380
<v 0>I can't wait for you guys to see it cause I think it's going to be pretty</v>

257
00:14:54.381 --> 00:14:58.340
fucking,
it's pretty over the top.
Put it that way.
Um,

258
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.230
and I know what you think and what bill,

259
00:15:00.231 --> 00:15:02.360
how did you come up with an idea like that?
Well,
you know what,

260
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:05.780
I used to tell my childhood stories on stage and only twisted people would laugh

261
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:06.710
and the rest of the crowd be like,

262
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.320
so I was walking my dog one day trying to think how to fucking,

263
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.970
I do these things where people will,
uh,
you know,
fucking loosen up a little bit.

264
00:15:17.971 --> 00:15:21.020
And I was like,
all right,
I'll animate it.
I'll do a cartoon.

265
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.850
Those aren't real people.

266
00:15:22.851 --> 00:15:27.851
They have three fucking fingers on each hand and then nobody can get mad and

267
00:15:28.751 --> 00:15:29.511
nobody can get offended.

268
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:33.650
And that's been the most fun about doing this as we've been writing this thing.

269
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.970
At no point have I got one network note saying,
wow,

270
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:43.760
what is it?
What are we promoting drug use that's violence against women.
This is,

271
00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:46.170
you know what,
what's Peter going to say?
Nothing.
Cause it's,

272
00:15:46.171 --> 00:15:50.690
it's cartoon people doesn't fucking count.
Um,
so there you go.

273
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.970
So I've got that coming out.
I know it's a long ways off,

274
00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:56.120
but I'm excited about it.
So I'll be talking to you.
Uh,
we've recorded,
uh,

275
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.340
you know,
some episodes at this point,
you know,
we're about halfway done.
And,
um,

276
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.560
I can't,
I,
I,
I,
you know,
I just been having the time of my life,
don't when it,

277
00:16:06.561 --> 00:16:10.940
so that's what I've been doing.
All right.
And with that,

278
00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:12.800
let me read a little bit of advertising here.

279
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.300
Let's pay for the fucking basements here.
Um,
all right.

280
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:22.070
Sorry guys.

It's annoying.
All right.
Draft kings,

281

All right.

327
00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.930
<v 1>Ah.
Boda Boda</v>

328
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:29.190
alright.
NFL football.
Talk to all the ladies.
Just,
you know,

329
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.170
walk away from the podcast this point.
All right.

330
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.840
Go make some Goddamn Pumpkin Pie.
You know,

331
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:38.520
go put on an apron and some horse shoes and walk around the kitchen like you

332
00:19:38.521 --> 00:19:43.490
used to when relationships worked.
Okay.
Before you were bitching,

333
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.660
moaning and complaining at me during the football,

334
00:19:45.661 --> 00:19:50.370
both from the kitchen and on my television set.
Oh,
Jesus.
Bill,
Jesus.

335
00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:55.230
What's wrong with you?
All right,
let's talk about,
um,

336
00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.690
let's talk about my New England patriots.
Huh?
How'd you like that?
CHICAGO?
Huh?

337
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.490
That was for Super Bowl 20.

338
00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.950
I hate when people do that when they think that you can get revenge for a

339
00:20:07.951 --> 00:20:12.180
playoff game.
Play offs,
a play off game during the regular season.

340
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.860
Um,
I'm going to go out on a limb and say,
uh,

341
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.990
that was just a bad game for Chicago.

342
00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.750
<v 0>I'm not saying they would have won the game,
but come on.</v>

343
00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.690
That was fucking ridiculous.
The the end,

344
00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.630
the final like five minutes of the second quarter,

345
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.510
they should have been no announcers.

346
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.530
They should have just been playing Benny Hill music.

347
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.750
Anytime the fucking bears had the ball.
Where am I going to Africa,
Daniel.

348
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.380
They are.
They are.
You know,

349
00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.830
we score 21 points in like four and a half minutes was,
I didn't even,

350
00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:46.780
I didn't even watch the second half.
Put it that way.
Put up a 50 spot on him.

351
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:51.850
Five zero.
And you know what?
As much as I want to rub it in their face,

352
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:56.740
who beat who in the Stanley Cup finals?
Who beat who in the Super Bowl?
Exactly.

353
00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.413
There you go.

354
00:20:59.120 --> 00:20:59.350
<v 4>Okay,</v>

355
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.440
<v 0>there you go.
So no Chicago fan should feel sad.</v>

356
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.500
There's not one Chicago fan out there that should feel sad.

357
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:09.670
You guys have had a lot of success.
You had Michael Jordan,
right?
85 bears.

358
00:21:09.671 --> 00:21:12.640
The bears is a little rough,
you know,
but you got the Black Hawks.

359
00:21:12.641 --> 00:21:16.390
I'm making up for it.
And now you cub fans.
I don't have that.
You guys do.

360
00:21:16.391 --> 00:21:18.400
You don't even care.
You started Karen,

361
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:23.550
when some fucking nerd wearing a Walkman touched a foul ball and you all piled

362
00:21:23.561 --> 00:21:28.240
on him like fucked up fucking pussies.
You are Chicago cub fans.

363
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:31.750
What about the other six guys standing around also reached up for the ball.

364
00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:33.580
What's a matter with a out of your weight class?

365
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:37.030
You wanted that guy with his little hat pulled down over his head.

366
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.450
You fucking punk.

367
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.360
I don't have any sympathy for Chicago cubs fan because they don't even give a

368
00:21:43.361 --> 00:21:48.100
fuck.
They've only given a fuck for like the last 10 years.
But other than that,

369
00:21:48.101 --> 00:21:51.910
it's just been take your shirt off and let's have a keg party.
Nobody cares.

370
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.110
You're on there.
Almost like an honorary baseball team.
Like,
yeah.
You know,

371
00:21:56.111 --> 00:21:58.890
just this represent the fact that people like

372
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.960
<v 1>the game,
you know the white sox fans,
they care.</v>

373
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:07.400
They give a fuck.
It's written all over their guide.
Damn faces.
You know,

374
00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.130
they still miss their old ballpark.
They hate that new place.

375
00:22:10.131 --> 00:22:11.800
You see them coming in with their heads down,

376
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:13.940
go and look at his stupid ass fucking thing.
You know,

377
00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:19.370
we had a classic fucking car and we traded it in on a Ford Taurus.

378
00:22:19.371 --> 00:22:23.750
What the fuck did we do?
You know,
see can feel for those guys.
They give a fuck.

379
00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.740
Chicago cub fans do not give a shit.

380
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:33.080
All right?
So if you're a tourist,
if you ever go to Chicago,

381
00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:34.710
<v 4>okay,</v>

382
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:39.240
<v 1>and you run into somebody,
you know,
and I got a passion for what they're doing.</v>

383
00:22:39.241 --> 00:22:42.870
That's a white sox fan.
If you run into just some fucking jerk off,

384
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.950
you know,
sitting there wearing loafers with no socks,

385
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.160
you know,

386
00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:54.160
in some silly fucking let's play two hat that is a cubs fan and they are not to

387
00:22:54.721 --> 00:22:57.680
be respected.
See what I did that people,

388
00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.560
not only did we just beat them,

389
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:04.130
I just cause hopefully some arguments right now between people in Chicago.

390
00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:09.940
That right there was a terrorist act right here on the podcast and you listen to

391
00:23:09.941 --> 00:23:12.250
it because you didn't do anything because you didn't hit stop.

392
00:23:12.251 --> 00:23:14.620
You actually became a part of it and now you're liable.

393
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.310
What do you think about that?
All right.
Um,
actually,
you know,

394
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.010
as well as the Patriots are playing and they look great.

395
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.040
How the fuck are we number one in pass defense?
I had no idea.

396
00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:28.030
I've been watching every game.
Um,
I would say,

397
00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:32.090
and then we're like last in the run or some bullshit like that.
So I,

398
00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:37.560
I actually think this next week when we play the Broncos,

399
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:42.130
you know,
if we win,
um,

400
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.040
decisively,
then I'll actually believe in this team as far

401
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.270
<v 0>as their ability to possibly,
uh,
you know,</v>

402
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.780
go deep into the playoffs and maybe make a run at this thing.

403
00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:56.900
But I gotta be honest with you,
who the fuck is good this year in the NFL?

404
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.920
Who is like,
like without a doubt.
Fucking good.

405
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.260
Like,
look at the fucking Seahawks.
I don't know what the hell happened to them.

406
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.630
They won't like four games this year.
I don't even,

407
00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.350
I made gains were into two at this fucking point.
What are you eight weeks in?

408
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.780
We try to pull this shit up here.

409
00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:20.130
The standings [inaudible] now.
Um,

410
00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:26.290
but that would have thought the Steelers we're going to,
we're going to lose,
do,

411
00:24:26.291 --> 00:24:30.040
fuck would they play in?
I don't even remember.
I'm the horse.
What do I do?

412
00:24:30.041 --> 00:24:32.740
This shit.
What the fuck are the Seahawks?

413
00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.440
Seattle Seahawks are four and three.

414
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:41.560
You're telling me the Arizona cardinals six and one,
like as a patriots fan,

415
00:24:41.561 --> 00:24:44.740
I got to sit there and think if we make it to the Superbowl,
Holy Shit.

416
00:24:44.741 --> 00:24:48.970
We might play the car knows,
look out for those lions.

417
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.520
I,
I'm not even buying the eagles.

418
00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.970
I don't believe in that coach or the quarterback.
I don't think.

419
00:24:56.971 --> 00:25:00.690
I don't know that anybody's good.
The giants are three and four.

420
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.720
I Dunno who little radius.
Oh,
and seven Broncos is six and one.

421
00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:12.720
I think he could actually,
uh,
I dunno.
I think we wouldn't,

422
00:25:12.721 --> 00:25:13.620
we would have a tough time,

423
00:25:13.621 --> 00:25:16.020
obviously with the Broncos who'd have a tough time with the colts.

424
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:20.080
I don't get the bangles.
I don't get them.

425
00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.410
Everybody was talking about how they were fucking unbelievable.

426
00:25:23.411 --> 00:25:26.170
And then they came in to Foxborough and get the living shit kicked out of him.

427
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.950
It's Cincinnati.
They're never going to win anything.
These,

428
00:25:29.951 --> 00:25:32.530
you're going to just look a uniform.
You just like that.
You get done.

429
00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:35.260
You're never going to win a Superbowl.
This Cincinnati Bangles,

430
00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.040
it's fucking over.
They look like they're,
you remember that?

431
00:25:39.041 --> 00:25:41.590
That Broadway show cats?
That's what they,

432
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:46.600
if you put a helmet's on those fucking dancers to dream the impossible dream,

433
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:52.870
<v 1>you know they could do that.
Why am I being a Dick?</v>

434
00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:53.870
You know what?

435
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.230
<v 0>Cause I gotta I gotta fucking blow to this podcast and I gotta go to work and</v>

436
00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:01.670
I'm fucking,
I'm a,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm not in day job shape.

437
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:05.090
I haven't had a day job since 1995 and I got to get up every morning,

438
00:26:05.091 --> 00:26:07.670
pack a fucking lunch,
like a jerk off.

439
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.760
I'm just fucking with you guys with all your teams.
Um,
I actually feel,

440
00:26:10.761 --> 00:26:13.340
feel really bad for the Raiders,
man.
Oh,
it's seven.
What the fuck?

441
00:26:13.341 --> 00:26:15.880
I watched a little bit of that game yesterday.
How about that Brown's defense?

442
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.230
Huh?
Their offense sucks.

443
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.100
One guy goes down on the old line and all of a sudden everybody rolls over.

444
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:27.080
The fucking pocket's collapsing.
11.
They're going.
I know it was a major injury.

445
00:26:27.081 --> 00:26:30.380
Really.
So then everybody sucks on the offensive line.
I don't understand that,

446
00:26:30.381 --> 00:26:34.630
but their defense look phenomenal.
But granted they were playing their age.

447
00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.970
Um,
all right,
let me just get,
let me bail out of this.

448
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:40.490
I obviously don't know shit about football this year despite the fact I've

449
00:26:40.491 --> 00:26:44.310
watched almost every week.
Oh I see.
Movement.

450
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:48.150
<v 1>Is that the lovely Nia?
They'll lovely Nia</v>

451
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:54.590
dirt.
That egg.
What's gone?
I just get the wave.

452
00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:59.090
She's come in in.
Um,

453
00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.550
anyways.
Oh you know what I did yesterday?
I was all over the last two days.

454
00:27:04.551 --> 00:27:07.790
Cause it's a,
it's Halloween.
You know me,
I get up for the holidays.

455
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:12.620
I think it's very important to us start traditions around the holidays.

456
00:27:12.621 --> 00:27:16.340
You know what I mean?
It reminds you of your childhood.
You create new memories.

457
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.340
Right.
So I made six loaves of Pumpkin bread.

458
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:24.470
I've been handing them out to my friends like a fucking drug dealer,
you know,

459
00:27:24.471 --> 00:27:28.040
cause they're wrapped in foil.
It just feels like you've got a brick,
a weed,

460
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:31.370
you know,
riding around in my fucking,

461
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:36.540
I'm riding around in a Prius
with one of those,
uh,

462
00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.790
save the earth grocery bags,
the cloth ones filled with pumpkin bread,

463
00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.060
dropping it off to friends.
Okay.

464
00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:50.060
If you can be any more feminine and still be straight,
if you can top that,

465
00:27:50.061 --> 00:27:53.120
I want to know what it is.
That's your homework this week.

466
00:27:53.121 --> 00:27:55.360
I want you guys to send me an emails that you,

467
00:27:55.390 --> 00:28:00.290
you feel that there's something beyond driving a Prius with a cloth grocery reg

468
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:04.880
filled up with pumpkin bread that you made,
dropping it off to France.

469
00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:09.890
And I want you to find something that's more feminine than that as a straight

470
00:28:09.891 --> 00:28:14.630
guy.
And don't just tag on to what I just said and add like skipping.

471
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:15.471
You know what?

472
00:28:15.471 --> 00:28:17.900
I'm going to fucking just go hack up whatever the fuck is in my mind.

473
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:22.430
Hang on a second.
Hang on.
Well,
let me just hit pause here.
All right,
I'm back.

474
00:28:22.431 --> 00:28:25.250
Sorry about that.
Jesus Christ.
I should have done that 20 minutes ago.

475
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:30.590
I can't imagine how many listeners I lost.
Um,
all right,

476
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:32.630
what am I talking about?
Oh yeah.
Making the Pumpkin bread,
dude,

477
00:28:32.631 --> 00:28:35.150
I got it down now you make six loaves of Pumpkin bread.

478
00:28:35.151 --> 00:28:36.500
You can do that shit in his asleep.

479
00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:42.150
And I found this giant fucking whisk that we got as a wedding gift.

480
00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:47.630
You know,
uh,
my wife registered it,
you know,
you know,
that was registered.

481
00:28:47.631 --> 00:28:51.260
All that,
that shift that you think is a guy you think is dumb.
Like,

482
00:28:51.261 --> 00:28:52.820
why do we need all this?
You know,

483
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.660
why don't we register with the flat screen TV store?
We don't do that.
Yeah.

484
00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:01.340
You registered like wix and sticks,
you know,
get a bunch of fucking candles,

485
00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:06.760
you know,
glasses and plates and all of that Shit.
And uh,

486
00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.790
then all of a sudden it arrives and you're like,
yeah,
Jesus Christ,

487
00:29:10.791 --> 00:29:12.650
we've got to cut all this shit up.
And the next thing you know,

488
00:29:12.651 --> 00:29:14.630
you got to stock to fucking kitchen

489
00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.230
and you're looking at that big,
dumb,

490
00:29:18.231 --> 00:29:22.860
stupid fucking whisk going,
what?
We'll look at this site,
automated it.

491
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:26.190
He'll fucking make some pancakes with a green giant with what?
What do I need?

492
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.150
A West is big four.
I'll tell you when you need it.

493
00:29:29.151 --> 00:29:34.151
When you're making six loaves of Pumpkin bread and you standing on a fucking

494
00:29:34.191 --> 00:29:38.550
chair just stirring that,
stirring that shit.
I get it,
man.

495
00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:41.410
I fucking love Bacon.
It's just,
it's like controlled,

496
00:29:41.411 --> 00:29:42.760
like playing in like a mud puddle.

497
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:46.480
It's like you being a little kid again and I got to tell you,
it's delicious.

498
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:51.250
And I ate a bunch of it and uh,
I'm not liking the shape I'm in right now.

499
00:29:51.251 --> 00:29:55.780
I'm fucking Billy fat again right now.
It's fucking driving me nuts.

500
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.770
And uh,
I got to start working out again and someone told me,
Oh,
day,

501
00:29:59.771 --> 00:30:02.140
what are you talking about?
You look good.
You look good.
It's like,
no,
no,
no.

502
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.400
I know I have a shirt on.
Most people look good when you put clothes on them.

503
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.940
You know,
when you,
when you're,
when you're hiding the mistakes.

504
00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.760
And that's basically how you stay in shape.

505
00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.080
<v 0>You know,
every night before you go to bed,</v>

506
00:30:16.081 --> 00:30:17.940
you take your shirt off and you look at it,

507
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:23.900
you look at the damage that you created in the mirror and you do every sort of

508
00:30:24.211 --> 00:30:28.170
band you can pass of bend to the side,
bend to the other side,
right?

509
00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:31.380
Standard aside,
you know,

510
00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:35.250
bend over at the waist and you just see that fucking spare tire.

511
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:40.500
Just grab a whole fucking handful of it.
Look at you.
You fucking piece of Shit,

512
00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.520
<v 1>Huh?
I don't know willpower.</v>

513
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:51.120
That first half was bullshit.
We're going to go down a dark corner.

514
00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:53.010
You get fucking psych yourself up.

515
00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:57.450
You Psych yourself up and it's all about the next God damn day.

516
00:30:57.451 --> 00:30:58.560
When you wake up in the morning,

517
00:30:58.561 --> 00:31:00.570
it's like you're coming out of the locker room at halftime.

518
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:04.580
<v 0>All right,
and what are we gonna do?
We gonna make some halftime adjustments.</v>

519
00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:08.150
Are we going to go right back to the frosted flakes and what are you gonna do?

520
00:31:08.151 --> 00:31:10.730
You're gonna make some red velvet pancakes.
You tubers shit.

521
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.020
<v 1>Huh?
Are you going to get some great nuts and have a banana?</v>

522
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.480
Then I make some oatmeal.
That's what you need to do.

523
00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:17.980
You got to get the fucking oatmeal.

524
00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:23.750
What does that shit that I'm telling you dude?
It's,
it's,
it's uh,
it's,
I,

525
00:31:23.751 --> 00:31:25.690
I used to never believe that food is a drug.

526
00:31:25.691 --> 00:31:29.620
It's 100% of drug and you've got to fucking,
when you start eating badly,

527
00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:33.760
you've got to force yourself to just fucking eat a salad and it just fucking

528
00:31:33.761 --> 00:31:37.540
stops those cravings like dead and the track.
It's a fucking,
it's a stiff arm,

529
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.740
right to the sugar,
salt bullshit.
You know,
same thing with working out.

530
00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:45.520
I didn't work out for like at least like 10 days and I kept sitting on the

531
00:31:45.521 --> 00:31:45.940
couches.

532
00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:49.660
I'm watching sports going to bill just fucking dropped the floor and just give,

533
00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:54.100
you know,
Bang out a hundred pushups and I just do it to my,

534
00:31:54.101 --> 00:31:57.550
I don't feel like,
Eh,
you don't cause she hasn't been eating like shit.

535
00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.740
I mean Pumpkin bread,
I got that shit in my body and it's,

536
00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:05.790
it's fucking eating away at my brain and as is is the smart part of me is going

537
00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:10.390
compel,
get up,
go for a walk.
You paste the top of Shit,
right?

538
00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.900
The pumpkin pumpkin bread's getting stronger.
It's in there.

539
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:17.570
It's going to add all that.
Say,
hey him,
sit on a couch.
Come on.
You are,

540
00:32:17.571 --> 00:32:19.120
and d even working hard,
right?

541
00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:24.840
So yesterday I finally got off the couch and my body's screaming

542
00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:32.860
and I just forced myself.
And within five,
six of them,

543
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.130
you know,
you get that he stuck getting that rush that you're working out.

544
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.010
You know,
you stand up after what did,
banging

545
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.620
<v 0>out a set of 25 35 or whatever,
right?</v>

546
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.370
You get up and all of a sudden you feel good.
You start strutting around,

547
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:51.950
you know,
first dad,
I like you just made them nice fucking catch on.

548
00:32:51.951 --> 00:32:56.570
Third Down,
saving the drive.
You dropped down and do not 35 starting to do it.

549
00:32:56.571 --> 00:32:57.710
I'm gonna get fucking shredding.

550
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:04.430
I'm aware that Mark Walberg fucking underwear walking around all shredded,
right?

551
00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:07.550
You start thinking shit like that just after two sets.

552
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:13.160
But if you didn't override that fucking Mcdonald's in your brain and he just sat

553
00:33:13.161 --> 00:33:14.420
there,
you know what you're gonna do,

554
00:33:14.421 --> 00:33:16.250
you're going to add another fucking layer of fat

555
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:21.080
and you're going to go into the bathroom at night hanging your head when you

556
00:33:21.081 --> 00:33:23.270
brush your teeth because you know you don't want to look at it.

557
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.870
Now you've got a t shirt on,
you can see it come through your fucking tee shirt.

558
00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:28.790
You can't hide that shit.
Right?

559
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:33.050
That big pile of mush clinging to your fucking rib cage.

560
00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:38.900
Awful looking like a fucking,
I don't know what I get new,

561
00:33:38.901 --> 00:33:39.800
certain level of shape.

562
00:33:39.801 --> 00:33:43.040
I just feel like I should be tied to the risks hanging from a tree and be used

563
00:33:43.041 --> 00:33:47.920
as a pin,
Yada.
Oh,

564
00:33:47.921 --> 00:33:48.731
it's disgusting.

565
00:33:48.731 --> 00:33:52.090
I was just thinking the fucking beat me and candy comes out of my ass cause I've

566
00:33:52.091 --> 00:33:56.080
been eating so bad.
I'm sorry.
Whatever.
What do you want from me?

567
00:33:56.081 --> 00:33:57.550
So now I'm back on the stick.
So,
you know,

568
00:33:57.551 --> 00:34:01.150
all I did was I did a hundred pushups and uh,

569
00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:05.500
I woke up today thinking about doing pull ups.
Had I not done that,

570
00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.130
I'd be fucking out.
Dave eating pumpkin bread.
Nah,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

571
00:34:09.131 --> 00:34:12.310
I'm going to eat another slice of it.
Oh.
And I'm putting butter on it.

572
00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:15.460
All right,
but you just gotta.
You know,

573
00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.390
you just got to refuse to get past a certain point.

574
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:24.670
You have to have a fucking line in the sand line in the butter.

575
00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:29.170
Will you just like,
I'm not going past this.
I'm not going past this shit.
So

576
00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:33.010
you know what I'm talking about.
Trying to stay in shape,

577
00:34:33.011 --> 00:34:38.011
which obviously now I can effortlessly segue into the Ebola panic.

578
00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.210
All right?
I'm sitting there watching 60 minutes.
Okay.

579
00:34:43.211 --> 00:34:48.211
And I got all these famous people telling me that they're tired of me beating

580
00:34:48.491 --> 00:34:52.600
women.
All these women that I'm not beating.
All right?

581
00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:57.670
I'm watching the world series on being reminded that people lose people to

582
00:34:57.671 --> 00:35:00.160
cancer every day.
Which is it,
which is always nice.
You know,

583
00:35:00.161 --> 00:35:02.140
when you're watching the national pastime,

584
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:05.300
take me out to the ball game.

585
00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.960
Take me out to the crowd.

586
00:35:07.961 --> 00:35:12.940
I just lost my mother to throat cancer bull.
Whoa,
whoa.
I mean,

587
00:35:12.941 --> 00:35:14.320
what the,
what the fuck are you doing?

588
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.710
I don't want to see that during the fucking gang.

589
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:20.083
<v 2>Okay.</v>

590
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:24.620
<v 0>We just have like the cancer channel,
like the disease channel.
You don't,</v>

591
00:35:24.621 --> 00:35:27.470
every once in a while I'll fucking click over there and I'll write out,
you know,

592
00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.190
send in five bucks or whatever the fuck I gotta do.

593
00:35:31.191 --> 00:35:32.630
Do you really have to interrupt?
If

594
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:36.860
am I out of my mind that I think it's unbelievably fucking

595
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.310
to do that to people.
What,
what are the,

596
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.910
what are the fuck are they going to do next?

597
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.750
You're going to crash some little boy's birthday party.

598
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:48.720
Happy Birthday to no more,

599
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:53.970
no more.
She felt face first into a birthday cake

600
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:56.670
lady.
He's five years old.

601
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:02.640
Hey,
just in case you haven't heard everybody,

602
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:07.320
it's not okay to hit a woman just in case you were a little confused.

603
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:12.270
Uh,
cocaine is bad for you.
Ah,

604
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.480
just to let you know,
a,
when somebody dies of cancer,

605
00:36:15.481 --> 00:36:19.290
there's people that love them and they miss the person afterwards and it's very

606
00:36:19.291 --> 00:36:20.124
painful.

607
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:23.670
Just thought we would remind you that while you're trying to watch the Kansas

608
00:36:23.671 --> 00:36:27.630
city royals and the San Francisco giants,

609
00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.340
So then you know is if all of that shit,

610
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:34.650
this is bread and circus time,

611
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.160
this is mouth breed of time and you're coming in here bringing up the horrors of

612
00:36:38.161 --> 00:36:40.050
the world,
right?

613
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:45.680
So I'm watching a the four o'clock game and all they keep doing on CBS is they

614
00:36:46.051 --> 00:36:49.620
keep hyping on 60 minutes that they're going to be talking about three or four

615
00:36:49.621 --> 00:36:53.400
nurses,
three of which are guys,

616
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:59.340
right.
Which means the three ladies that were going to be nurses are now doctors,

617
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:04.080
which is far as I can tell is three out of four nurses are now men and three out

618
00:37:04.081 --> 00:37:08.880
of four doctors are now women.
And this still bitching.
All right.

619
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.690
And don't even tell me my math is off on that cause we'll fuck where all the

620
00:37:12.691 --> 00:37:13.650
female nurses,

621
00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:17.970
they know where to be filed because they bitch Moan and complain to get

622
00:37:17.971 --> 00:37:21.020
themselves to hold the scalp and the now what the fuck are we doing?
What?

623
00:37:21.021 --> 00:37:25.050
We're walking around changing bed pans and the fucking coming on my football to

624
00:37:25.051 --> 00:37:28.050
tell me not to hit you.
Uh,

625
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.120
you want to take a bed pan right across your back,

626
00:37:30.121 --> 00:37:33.600
like wrestling with a steel chair,
taking all the doctor jobs.

627
00:37:33.601 --> 00:37:38.520
You women got a lot of nerve.
Um,
anyways,

628
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.620
so what do they do?
They start fucking hypen.

629
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.780
They start hyping that they're going to talk to these four people that were near

630
00:37:45.781 --> 00:37:49.530
an Ebola patient who didn't catch a bola and how fucking scared they are.

631
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:53.370
You know,
it's funny,
the people actually caught a bulla.
How many have even died?

632
00:37:55.620 --> 00:38:00.360
You know,
you know what a bowl is?
A bullet is the Cincinnati bangles of diseases.

633
00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.910
They started fucking strong.
Everybody thought they were a contender,

634
00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:12.770
right?
They knocked the ice bucket challenge right off the map.

635
00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:19.570
Everybody was talking about fucking als ice bucket challenge and incomes.

636
00:38:19.581 --> 00:38:21.770
A Bolo,
right?
Like if it was a nightclub,

637
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:27.290
a bullet comes walking in a little hotter shoes,
a little Horia,
right?

638
00:38:27.291 --> 00:38:30.560
And everybody starts looking over at that bitch,
walking into the fucking club.

639
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:33.430
And then als is over there with the ice bucket.
We went,
wait a minute,

640
00:38:33.431 --> 00:38:36.370
and I'm doing the wet t shirt thing over here.
Guys don't like this anymore.

641
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.920
<v 1>Sorry.
Als.
There's a better look and horror on the pole.</v>

642
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.730
So not everybody's over here looking at this fucking a bowl of shit.

643
00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:50.950
We're going to be fine,
everybody.
This is a deal.

644
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.360
Let's just say,

645
00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:58.210
let's just say a couple hundred thousand people die of a bull,
all right?

646
00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:01.900
You know we have like over 300 million people in this country,

647
00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:03.773
<v 2>okay?</v>

648
00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:07.670
<v 1>So the way I look at it,
it's like you got a giant football team here.</v>

649
00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.040
A Bola takes out 200,000 people.

650
00:39:10.041 --> 00:39:13.190
That's like when you make your final cuts in the preseason.
Now we got,

651
00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:17.550
we were a little more streamlined,
all right?
Whose kidney would do it?

652
00:39:17.551 --> 00:39:21.570
If you get a bowler,
you're weak.
You're a weak person,

653
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.890
okay?
You don't have the intestinal fortitude.

654
00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.740
You don't have the mental toughness,

655
00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:30.883
<v 2>okay?</v>

656
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:35.980
<v 1>To fucking survive in a world of diseases,
okay?</v>

657
00:39:35.981 --> 00:39:36.940
And when you get a bullet,

658
00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:39.550
why don't you have the fucking decency to not go to the fucking airport,

659
00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:41.363
all right?

660
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:47.700
Just walk down the street into the woods and just bleed out by yourself like a

661
00:39:47.801 --> 00:39:50.800
gentleman.
Why?
Why can't you do that?
Is,
is there a reason for that?

662
00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.700
That's my question.
I'm going to take college here in 20 minutes.
Um,

663
00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:01.690
how far into the sand might this fucking absolute horse shit?
Uh,
all right.

664
00:40:01.691 --> 00:40:04.010
What have I talked about?
Oh Man.
What's it been watching this?

665
00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:04.841
A little bit of hockey.

666
00:40:04.841 --> 00:40:07.090
This is such a tough year to try and keep up with everything.

667
00:40:07.091 --> 00:40:11.750
I've been really watching the world series though.
Um,
I'm,

668
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:16.750
I missed most of game four.
I think I did.

669
00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.280
Uh,
I was watching something else.
I forget what,
but uh,
Jesus,

670
00:40:21.281 --> 00:40:24.370
Kansas City came back,
they lost the first one for those.
You're not watching.

671
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.310
They came back,
they won game two and three.

672
00:40:27.311 --> 00:40:29.980
They were up two games to one up two games to one.
Right.

673
00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:32.020
And then they go out to s.
You know,
there are actually,

674
00:40:32.021 --> 00:40:35.350
they won the first game in San Francisco and then,
uh,

675
00:40:35.351 --> 00:40:39.550
I was hoping that they were going to win either one game a four or five and they

676
00:40:39.551 --> 00:40:42.460
didn't,
they lost them both.
It was like the giant,

677
00:40:42.461 --> 00:40:44.500
I don't know if there's a way to make a halftime adjustment,

678
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.900
but that's what it looks like the giants did.

679
00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:51.910
I just think that they ran into some tough pitching and,
uh,
so who knows,

680
00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:57.010
who knows?
But,
um,
I don't have any sort of feeling on this series.

681
00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:01.030
Like I don't feel like if Casey wins game six that they're going to win game

682
00:41:01.031 --> 00:41:05.140
seven.
I hope they do.
I liked the royals.
I also really like the giants too,

683
00:41:05.141 --> 00:41:07.660
so I'm not being addicted.
People in San Francisco,
it's just,
you know,

684
00:41:07.661 --> 00:41:12.290
I just saw the giants win 2010 2012.
Um,

685
00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:17.140
and it was great to see that.
Um,
but I'd like to,
you know,
to see Casey get when,

686
00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:20.260
however,
if the giants win,

687
00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:26.500
um,
that's three world series in the 2000 and they would join the Boston red sox.

688
00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:30.370
We want Oh four oh seven and 2013.

689
00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:31.993
Um,

690
00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:36.830
because basically somebody is going to be the Yankees of this,

691
00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:42.200
uh,
century.
Someone's going to be the one who won the most fucking,
uh,
you know,

692
00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:45.290
team of the century basically.
How many,
how many world series,

693
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:46.213
how many [inaudible],

694
00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:50.630
how many world series do you think it's going to take to be the,
uh,

695
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:52.040
the team of this century?

696
00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:55.850
Because now that you got 30 fucking teams,

697
00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:59.000
what's crazy is if Kansas city wins this year,

698
00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.310
the fact that it took them 29 years,

699
00:42:01.311 --> 00:42:06.020
they're actually on average mathematically,
you know,

700
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.990
you got a one in 30 chance chance of winning now

701
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:15.710
that they would be,
uh,
that for them to win one in 29 years.

702
00:42:15.711 --> 00:42:18.890
They actually came in a year early.
My math fucked up on that.
I'm sure it is.

703
00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.090
I'm not the smartest guy out there,

704
00:42:20.091 --> 00:42:23.720
especially when it comes to the fucking arithmetic there.
Um,

705
00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.690
I'm actually thinking if you won,

706
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:34.700
if you want 12,
maybe
if you want 12th,

707
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:38.990
I would think that you'd get it at this point with 30 fucking teams that's

708
00:42:38.991 --> 00:42:41.030
waiting better than one a decade.

709
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:42.783
<v 5>MMM.</v>

710
00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:46.200
<v 1>So like right now,
the red sox are ahead of the curve.</v>

711
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:50.250
I can't believe I even get to say that after all the shit they went through is

712
00:42:50.251 --> 00:42:51.090
they've won three,

713
00:42:51.091 --> 00:42:54.930
so they're actually good through the 2000 twenties and I think we're going to

714
00:42:54.931 --> 00:42:56.130
get another one before then.

715
00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:57.713
<v 5>MMM.</v>

716
00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:02.590
<v 1>I think the Yankees are a,
I don't know.</v>

717
00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:07.240
I think that they're all,
all of those teams,
the Celtics,

718
00:43:07.241 --> 00:43:09.880
the Yankees,
the Canadians,
all of those teams that one,

719
00:43:09.881 --> 00:43:13.450
like fucking nine zillion titles when they was like fucking 15 teams in the

720
00:43:13.451 --> 00:43:17.820
League of 10 teams in the league.
Uh,
you know,
that's over.

721
00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:20.850
Like back in the day when the Yankees used to win titles.
Do you know when,

722
00:43:20.851 --> 00:43:22.960
when you won your division that was winning the pennant?

723
00:43:22.961 --> 00:43:26.080
They had so few teams that there wasn't another division you had to play.

724
00:43:26.081 --> 00:43:29.020
Forget about two rounds of fucking baseball.

725
00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:32.290
Best four out of seven to get to the final thing.
Now I'm not,
you know,

726
00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.290
fucking with the Yankees legacy because it's the most legit thing there is

727
00:43:35.291 --> 00:43:39.850
considering babe Ruth,
Lou Gehrig,
Joe Dimaggio and Mickey Mantle.

728
00:43:39.851 --> 00:43:42.310
No one's ever going to have a fucking run a players like that.
Again,

729
00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.900
you're lucky if you go back to back with two unbelievable players,

730
00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:48.490
spaghetti about foreign around.

731
00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.313
<v 5>MMM.</v>

732
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:52.850
<v 1>But nobody's going to win at a clip like that again.</v>

733
00:43:52.851 --> 00:43:57.851
Like I don't see anybody ever catching the Yankees like how bad the Yankees

734
00:43:59.301 --> 00:44:02.900
would have to nosedive.
And they're spending like,
you know,

735
00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.960
200 million a year.
I think they've,
they've lowered their,

736
00:44:05.961 --> 00:44:09.680
their yearly average and at this point,
but generally speaking,

737
00:44:09.681 --> 00:44:11.570
they send him to spend roughly 200 million bucks a year.

738
00:44:11.571 --> 00:44:14.660
If you do that year after year after year,
uh,
you know,

739
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:15.920
you're going to win a couple here,

740
00:44:15.921 --> 00:44:17.660
a couple there and you're going to stay out front.

741
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:22.400
I cause I think the closest that is to them is I think the cardinals and they

742
00:44:22.401 --> 00:44:26.330
got like 11,
10 or 11,
I can't remember what.

743
00:44:26.331 --> 00:44:30.770
And that puts them like a good 16,
16 behind.
It's over.

744
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:32.010
No one's going to catch

745
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.070
<v 0>them.
No one's gonna catch the,
uh,
the Canadians.</v>

746
00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:37.123
<v 2>MMM.</v>

747
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:41.690
<v 0>Both of them are just too out far in front.
But then with basketball,</v>

748
00:44:41.691 --> 00:44:45.270
like I think the Lakers are going to overtake the Celtics just because of

749
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:46.570
<v 2>Ah,
okay.</v>

750
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:49.410
<v 0>People would rather play in La,</v>

751
00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.620
like Boston and La are equally racist.

752
00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:54.453
<v 2>MMM.</v>

753
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:57.660
<v 0>And a lot of people don't think that just because for some reason we get all the</v>

754
00:44:57.661 --> 00:44:58.560
attention,
you know,

755
00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:01.590
despite the fact that they have fucking riots out here and that police are

756
00:45:01.591 --> 00:45:05.640
constantly fucking murdering people.
Um,

757
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:07.100
<v 2>yeah,</v>

758
00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:11.240
<v 0>I would say.
Yeah.
So then it just comes down to better weather.</v>

759
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:17.700
Um,
and celebrity pussy,
I mean right there and you know,
yeah.

760
00:45:17.701 --> 00:45:18.570
It's basically,
what do you want to,

761
00:45:18.571 --> 00:45:21.290
do you want to play in the racist town with the bad weather and a,

762
00:45:21.291 --> 00:45:25.220
the potato faces or do you want to come out here with the plastic surgery ass

763
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:29.130
and the great weather with the racism?
I mean,
it's a no fucking brainer.

764
00:45:29.131 --> 00:45:31.100
They're going to come out here.
Um,

765
00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:32.043
<v 2>so</v>

766
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:35.510
<v 0>I dunno,
unless we go on some sort of a fucking run,</v>

767
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:40.280
that's the only real race that there is.
And for those you don't keep up on it.

768
00:45:40.281 --> 00:45:45.281
The south except 17 and the Lakers had 15 plus a be a championship that they

769
00:45:45.861 --> 00:45:49.760
have to count as an NBA championship for some fucking reason.
I don't,

770
00:45:49.761 --> 00:45:52.400
I don't understand that.
I don't understand how I've said it before.

771
00:45:52.401 --> 00:45:53.510
I don't understand how to fuck.

772
00:45:53.511 --> 00:45:58.010
You can win an NBA championship before the NBA exists.
It's unbelievable.

773
00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:01.850
But you know,
it's La.
That's what you do.
I'm a director.

774
00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.630
I got 16 championships.
All right.
Uh,
let's,

775
00:46:05.631 --> 00:46:10.490
let's read a little bit of advertising here.
Oh,
by the way,
oh,
by the way,
if I'm,

776
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.090
<v 2>okay,</v>

777
00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:16.050
<v 0>let me get this out of the way here.
If you would like to buy my,
uh,</v>

778

my standup comedy album and you do not live in the continental United States,

779
00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:22.860
um,

And,
um,

783
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.030
reminders for listeners of the podcast,

784
00:46:39.031 --> 00:46:44.031

All right,

786
00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:51.720
let's get into a,

787
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:53.150
<v 2>okay,</v>

788
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:57.790
<v 0>let's get into some questions here for the week.
Um,</v>

789
00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:58.973
all right.

790
00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:00.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

791
00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:04.090
<v 0>Shaving in the steam room.
All right.
What do we got here?
Bill?</v>

792
00:47:04.091 --> 00:47:07.270
You like steams after my workout,
I like to take a steam.

793
00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:11.620
What I find is people coming in and shaving in the steam room.

794
00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:16.780
What the fuck dude?
People at just stiff fucking animals,

795
00:47:16.781 --> 00:47:21.160
man.
Fucking animals.
This is sign outside.

796
00:47:21.161 --> 00:47:25.540
No shaving,
but it must be for someone else.
You're a quick witted guy.

797
00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:30.190
What backhanded response can I give these assholes when they come in and start

798
00:47:30.191 --> 00:47:34.540
shaving?
Okay.
Am I the most negative guy ever that I took your,

799
00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:38.540
you're a quick witted guy as an insult.
Hey Bill,
you're a quick witted guy.

800
00:47:38.541 --> 00:47:40.310
Why don't you write me a fucking comeback?

801
00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:45.130
What am I on the writing staff of your life here,
sir?
MMM.

802
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:49.320
What would you say?
I would sit there and the Steve,
you like buddy.

803
00:47:49.321 --> 00:47:53.490
There's no shaving in here.
Let's disgusting.
We all have to use it.

804
00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:57.690
What's wrong with you?
You fucking animal.
Oh,
look who's here.

805
00:47:58.350 --> 00:47:59.790
Look who's here.
Everybody.

806
00:47:59.791 --> 00:48:04.791
It's the lovely Nia making of parents for the first time in a while people

807
00:48:07.261 --> 00:48:11.610
thought you dumped me.
Get over here.
I only have one microphone.

808
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.980
Don't touch the fucking mixer.
What are you doing?

809
00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:19.143
<v 6>Oh,
Jesus.</v>

810
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:24.170
Listening to you screaming like a moron about God knows what.

811
00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.140
What are you yelling about again?

812
00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:33.860
<v 0>Mia?
This,
this podcast is a,
it's an important thing.
I got to bring the energy.</v>

813
00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:34.753
I get to bring the,

814
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:39.110
<v 6>I know it's literally Monday morning your leg.
Oh,
how blood and butter on it.</v>

815
00:48:39.111 --> 00:48:43.010
And he's fucking screaming about Pumpkin bread.
It's nine in the morning.

816
00:48:43.011 --> 00:48:46.490
What is the matter with you?
Seriously?

817
00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:49.350
And when someone calls Azzie for a,
uh,

818
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:52.640
a nice quip or something to say to somebody,
you get an attitude about it.

819
00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:57.020
What's the matter with you?
I Dunno.
Look,
look how it's written.
It's written.

820
00:48:57.021 --> 00:49:00.200
Tell me I'm wrong there.
Somebody was shaving in the steam room.

821
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:03.950
How gross is that?
It's disgusting.
Absolutely fucking disgusting.

822
00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:07.220
They should literally just put a collar around that guy and stick him in a

823
00:49:07.221 --> 00:49:10.160
fucking cage.
Take him down to the pound.
Yeah,

824
00:49:10.161 --> 00:49:13.130
I mean he can either just go straight up to him.
Like you said a buddy,

825
00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:16.100
there's no shaving and hear that sounds like exactly what we would say.

826
00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:20.090
You would definitely say,
hey buddy,
and that really fucking tense away.

827
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.340
No,
I would or you could like,
you know what he should sell on then to the uh,

828
00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:28.760
place and get them band or what you stand up here where we were getting reports

829
00:49:28.761 --> 00:49:30.980
that you're,
you're shaving in the same room and Sarah,

830
00:49:30.981 --> 00:49:34.130
well you've been warned several times about this where it has asked you to
leave.

831
00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:37.330
Can I have your,
your locker room key please?
No,

832
00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:40.250
<v 0>the guy initially denies it.
I wasn't shaving in there.</v>

833
00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:43.130
And then the guy like gently reaches out and touches the side of his face.

834
00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:45.460
<v 6>Come on.
We both know.</v>

835
00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.420
<v 0>We both know there's no way your face is going to be that smooth unless you're</v>

836
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:50.263
shaving.

837
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:53.000
You know what the guy that you guys should do is just stand up and start peeing

838
00:49:53.001 --> 00:49:57.200
on his leg and this is what you do.
You say,
yeah,
no.
You say,
sir,

839
00:49:57.201 --> 00:49:59.300
there's no shaving in here.
And if he has an attitude,

840
00:49:59.301 --> 00:50:03.260
then you pee on his leg and then you both get kicked out and then you make the

841
00:50:03.261 --> 00:50:07.310
news.
Oh,
go,
go home.
Like that.
TMC A Matt was Shayla.

842
00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:10.820
I was also going to make the show.
Let me get a tighter shirt.

843
00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:14.570
The metal is metal shaving in the state room and this other guy,

844
00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:15.720
he gets somebody please.

845
00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:21.060
<v 6>No,
no,
I haven't.
That's my TMC impression.</v>

846
00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:28.470
<v 0>I hate that you watch that stupid fucking show with all those Goddamn</v>

847
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:32.410
<v 1>geeks standing around.
And I watch it on a regular basis,
but I do a,</v>

848
00:50:32.411 --> 00:50:36.590
I watch it from time to time to get caught up on the,
on the celebrity.
See,

849
00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:41.600
I have never seen however long,
it seems like it's an hour long,

850
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:45.530
an hour long of nothing.
Just watching people coming out of restaurants,

851
00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:51.050
you know,
hey Sean Penn,
what do you think about a boa?
And he's just like,
why?

852
00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:57.890
I just had some muscles.
Oh,
cleo.

853
00:50:57.891 --> 00:51:02.180
Cleo wants to be in the blog.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.

854
00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:04.370
It was going off the rails.
It's going off the rails here.

855
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:09.110
Get down the original cock block.
Anytime we hug,

856
00:51:09.111 --> 00:51:12.790
the dog comes over like I want to be a part of it.
Go lay down.

857
00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:19.350
Go lay down.
Get over there.
Get over there stupid.
Don't call the dogs.

858
00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:24.590
Oh,
that dog.
I fucking love that dog.
You don't even understand.
All right.
Yeah.

859
00:51:24.591 --> 00:51:25.530
You don't understand that.

860
00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:29.510
Do understand the way you throw yourself on top of her and go,
oh,

861
00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:33.350
glow or the loudest possible.
It's one of my favorite things to do.

862
00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:38.210
You can't stop doing it.
Do it constantly throughout the day.

863
00:51:38.211 --> 00:51:40.490
You do it like 10 times a day.
I'm not exaggerating.

864
00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:44.330
<v 0>I'm not going to defend myself.
It's like,</v>

865
00:51:44.331 --> 00:51:47.600
how do you not go over and hug your dog?
That's what I do.
I always go,
all right.

866
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:49.580
She,
she sees me coming over.

867
00:51:49.581 --> 00:51:53.240
She lays down on her side and I just grabbed her and I squeezed her and I
scream,

868
00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:58.880
<v 1>oh yeah,
you get her.
You know,</v>

869
00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:02.800
and who takes her for a hike every fucking day?
Yeah,
you do.

870
00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:06.610
But you also like literally you walk into the room and she's like up on her feet

871
00:52:06.611 --> 00:52:11.470
and she's like,
Huh?
Like you,
you're giving the dog your energy,

872
00:52:11.471 --> 00:52:16.120
your manic energy.
I know I'm a fucking psycho.

873
00:52:16.121 --> 00:52:18.730
What do you want from me?
But you know what?
I don't shave in the steam room.

874
00:52:18.731 --> 00:52:21.420
So what would I say to this guy?
I would say,
uh,

875
00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:26.350
<v 0>I'd be like,
buddy,
there's no shaving in here.
That's fucking,
yeah,</v>

876
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:28.970
<v 1>gross.
What's wrong?</v>

877
00:52:28.971 --> 00:52:32.360
You little stupid whiskers are going to be there on the floor.
He fucking animal,

878
00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:33.480
Dude.
I sweating

879
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:34.620
<v 0>God.
I swear to God,</v>

880
00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:39.060
the fucking animals that go into steam rooms.

881
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:43.510
Fucking animals.
Fucking guy

882
00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:47.290
<v 1>cleaning the does toenails or is dead skin off of his feet.</v>

883
00:52:47.291 --> 00:52:48.580
Just sitting there scrubbing it.

884
00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:51.190
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
you know something.</v>

885
00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:54.070
I only think that that's 10% of people that go into steam rooms.

886
00:52:54.071 --> 00:52:56.780
I think the rest of us,
we need to speak up.
We're just sitting there silently.

887
00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:59.230
They're not saying anything.
She's,
what the fuck is wrong with you dude?

888
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:00.160
It's gross.

889
00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:02.560
<v 1>Sitting there yelling at somebody.</v>

890
00:53:02.561 --> 00:53:06.160
You both got your dicks out and not a thick things flapping around.

891
00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:11.850
<v 0>Alright.
Remaining positive.
I'm a 23 year old,</v>

892
00:53:11.851 --> 00:53:16.140
recent recent college graduate who's dealing with a bit of depression,

893
00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:21.150
having never dated,
finding it hard.
Did I write this?
Having never dated,

894
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:25.320
finding it hard to get a job and having no actual goal life.

895
00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:27.810
I'm finding it hard to keep motivated to do anything.

896
00:53:27.811 --> 00:53:31.860
I normally eat well and go to the gym,
but that's the only healthy habit I have.

897
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:35.130
I want to be enjoying my twenties but because I've accomplished nothing,

898
00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:38.370
not even having formed any relationships with any girl,

899
00:53:38.371 --> 00:53:40.380
it's been hard to smile and remain positive.

900
00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:45.210
Do you get into these sorts of funks and what advice would you have to get out

901
00:53:45.211 --> 00:53:47.250
of it?
Any advice from you or the lovely?

902
00:53:47.251 --> 00:53:52.020
Nia would honestly make a major impact on my life.
No pressure.
Yeah,
body.
Jesus.

903
00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:52.883
Um,

904
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.460
<v 4>okay.</v>

905
00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:57.930
<v 0>Yeah.
I literally could have written that at 23 years old.
I was basically in the,</v>

906
00:53:57.931 --> 00:54:02.130
uh,
essentially the same boat.
Um,

907
00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:05.850
had no fucking,
I was still living at home,
had no girlfriend.

908
00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:09.870
I commuted all the way through college.
I didn't have any college friends,

909
00:54:09.871 --> 00:54:12.330
never went to any of those parties or any of that type of shit.

910
00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:13.960
<v 1>MMM,</v>

911
00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:15.390
<v 4>okay.</v>

912
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:18.240
<v 1>And I was actually flailing one on what the fuck I was gonna do with my life.</v>

913
00:54:18.241 --> 00:54:20.250
I tried sales,
I worked in warehousing,

914
00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:25.080
I had a job at a dental office and none of it was making me excited about going

915
00:54:25.081 --> 00:54:28.950
to work.
And I started thinking like,
Oh fuck,
am I going to be that guy?

916
00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:33.030
That guy that just does a fucking job that he hates sin.
Um,

917
00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:34.580
<v 4>okay.</v>

918
00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:38.860
<v 1>I Dunno,
I just started every day.
I Dunno.</v>

919
00:54:38.861 --> 00:54:43.160
I'm just trying to think what I wanted.
What did I want?
And um,

920
00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:47.120
don't look at it with judgment or think that something's impossible.

921
00:54:47.121 --> 00:54:50.240
Like whatever you want to do to be sitting there thinking like,
oh,

922
00:54:50.241 --> 00:54:53.420
I can't do that.
I could never do that.
You can,
you can.

923
00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:57.930
I am an absolute moron and if I can make something happen,
you definitely can.
I,

924
00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:01.430
I would.
I would say that I don't like how you laugh when I said I'm a moron.

925
00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:02.450
You are a moron.

926
00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:07.310
<v 6>But I think you just gave really,
really perfect advice.
That's great advice.</v>

927
00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:11.360
You got to figure it out.
Yeah.
What is it that you really,
really enjoy doing?

928
00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:15.170
And maybe there's a way to actually make a living at it.
Like,
Bill,

929
00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:17.550
<v 1>yeah,
this is what you just start doing it.</v>

930
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:23.300
You just start fucking doing it and then eventually it turns in to your job and

931
00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:30.120
all you do is just,
I think what most people do is like,

932
00:55:30.121 --> 00:55:34.890
say they're thinking like,
I don't know,
pick a job that's fucking a,
you're like,

933
00:55:34.891 --> 00:55:38.160
oh,
I could never do that.
I'll just keep it in entertainment.
Say you wanted to

934
00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:42.030
get into like I'm broadcasting,

935
00:55:42.031 --> 00:55:46.410
I guess announcing schemes and you start thinking like,
oh my God,

936
00:55:46.411 --> 00:55:51.300
I want to announce NFL Games.
How the fuck do I get there?
Um,
so you start,

937
00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:56.100
you know,
I would think you'd start doing high school games,
little league games.

938
00:55:56.101 --> 00:55:58.800
I would do anything.
I would just,
if no one was hiring me,

939
00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:03.030
I would just show up at little league games with a fucking sport coat on and set

940
00:56:03.031 --> 00:56:04.800
up a table and I would just start doing it.

941
00:56:04.801 --> 00:56:08.700
I would go down to pickup basketball games.
I just,
that's not creepy at all.

942
00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:12.420
<v 6>Just start doing,
just showing up at the little kids gave him like here I am.</v>

943
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:16.110
<v 1>I know cause now cause his pedophiles,
there's always been pedophiles.</v>

944
00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:17.190
What am I going here I am,

945
00:56:17.191 --> 00:56:20.070
I'm going to watch started molesting a kid is everyone's sitting there.

946
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:23.890
I would just start doing the game.
Like it was a major league baseball game.

947
00:56:23.891 --> 00:56:26.950
The parents would love it.
You could go down to like the uh,

948
00:56:26.951 --> 00:56:29.980
the basketball courts.
I would just anything just to,
just to be doing it.

949
00:56:29.981 --> 00:56:31.870
That's like your open.
So I'm not getting paid.

950
00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:35.600
I'm learning how to do this shit and then I dunno,

951
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:38.830
start taking some classes at a broadcasting school.
You just,

952
00:56:38.831 --> 00:56:43.780
every part of your day becomes announcing,
you know?
Right.
I,

953
00:56:43.781 --> 00:56:46.780
when I had day jobs,
I used to sit there doing the job and I would be any,

954
00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:51.640
any funny fucking idea ahead.
I would just write it down and um,

955
00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:57.280
and then I would go try it out somewhere and I just kept doing it and doing it

956
00:56:57.281 --> 00:56:58.300
and doing it and do it.
You just,

957
00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:01.720
you just start marching towards it and you don't look at like,
well,
Hey,

958
00:57:01.721 --> 00:57:05.260
I just fuck 'em I'm doing high school games.
I'll never get to the NFL.

959
00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:10.540
Like most people don't get there because they want it in a week.
Dude,

960
00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:13.840
they're fucking helicopters are going to fly into the fucking house around here.

961
00:57:13.841 --> 00:57:17.650
That crazy.
I don't know if you guys could just hear that ship.
Um,

962
00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:23.950
they uh,
yeah,
you just,
every single day you just,
you just,

963
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:27.070
I don't know,
look at this stupid ass podcast.

964
00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:29.770
I just kept doing it every Monday and all of a sudden,
you know,

965
00:57:29.771 --> 00:57:30.910
I got a bunch of listeners.
Okay.

966
00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:32.650
<v 6>Curious about cause I'm trying to,
you know,</v>

967
00:57:32.651 --> 00:57:35.170
I'm always trying to like read between the lines and he goes,

968
00:57:35.171 --> 00:57:37.060
I normally eat well and go to the gym,

969
00:57:37.061 --> 00:57:41.770
but that's the only quote unquote healthy habit I have.
What does that mean?

970
00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:46.240
Well I don't want to start.
Why that guy?
I'm just,

971
00:57:46.241 --> 00:57:50.560
I'm just curious as why that got thrown in there because I don't know if that

972
00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:55.590
means that there's things that he's doing that he is not healthy because the

973
00:57:56.291 --> 00:58:01.060
rest of it doesn't really,
I dunno.
I normally well and go to the gym.

974
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:04.000
That's the only healthy Abbott I have.
Like it's or it's like they only thing

975
00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:06.570
<v 0>habit I have.
It's just like working out and going to the gym,</v>

976
00:58:06.571 --> 00:58:11.320
but I don't have any other like things like does the healthy and quotes is a,

977
00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:16.080
it concerns me a little bit while I think he's really hard on himself so he's

978
00:58:16.081 --> 00:58:19.020
got to lighten up on self.
So even when he's doing something,

979
00:58:19.050 --> 00:58:22.800
even when he's doing something positive,
he still puts it in quotes.

980
00:58:22.801 --> 00:58:24.250
He won't give himself credit for there.

981
00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:28.770
It sounds like you maybe had some negative parents who told you the world was a

982
00:58:28.771 --> 00:58:32.550
lot more difficult than it is.
I would,
uh,
I'd also work on like,

983
00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:35.640
just paying attention to the thoughts in your head.
That's how,

984
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:37.800
cause I was never clinically depressed,
but I was definitely,

985
00:58:37.801 --> 00:58:41.070
I've had definitely bouts of depression and function,
that type of thing.

986
00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:44.270
I felt like shit yesterday when I was watching the game and I did,
uh,

987
00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:48.720
a hundred pushups and you know,
three sets.
Okay.

988
00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:52.440
I can actually like actually dropped down.
I had a heart attack.
No,
know I did.

989
00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:55.260
I this set of three and I got to a hundred,

990
00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:59.070
105 actually sets it 30 flag.
Right?
You folks.
Um,

991
00:59:00.930 --> 00:59:04.220
no,
but I immediately felt better.
Right?
I immediately felt better.
So,

992
00:59:04.350 --> 00:59:06.810
<v 6>and also you're 23 years old,
you have a long,</v>

993
00:59:06.811 --> 00:59:10.560
long time to figure out what it is that you want to do for the rest of your
life.

994
00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:13.980
You know what I mean?
And it's probably going to change several times.

995
00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:17.880
So maybe you just graduated college and you're like,
oh,
I majored in business.

996
00:59:17.881 --> 00:59:21.270
I don't want to get into business.
I really want to be a veterinarian,

997
00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.390
something like that.
And I think that bill's right.
You should,

998
00:59:23.530 --> 00:59:24.380
<v 0>when I want to do it,</v>

999
00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:28.880
I would immediately start picking up roadkill off of the side of the road and

1000
00:59:28.881 --> 00:59:30.350
I'd try to see if I could bring it back to life.

1001
00:59:30.690 --> 00:59:34.650
<v 6>Reviving it,
reviving that a dead cat on the freeway.</v>

1002
00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:38.310
<v 0>No,
no.
Just,
yeah,
you're fine.
You're 23 you got your whole life ahead of you.</v>

1003
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:39.370
You don't,
it can be worse.
Do.

1004
00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:42.300
You could be in a relationship and you fucking knocked her up and now you're

1005
00:59:42.301 --> 00:59:44.190
tied to her for the rest of your fucking life.

1006
00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:47.340
And then you've got to go get a job.
It's someplace you want to work at.

1007
00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:50.760
So the fact that you don't have anything going on in your life is fucking

1008
00:59:50.761 --> 00:59:54.510
awesome.
There's nothing holding you back.
You can just now you can.

1009
00:59:54.511 --> 00:59:55.950
You actually get to decide.
You know what I mean?

1010
00:59:55.951 --> 00:59:59.910
People would want to be in your fucking position.
23 no girlfriend,

1011
01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:04.050
you know,
no fucking mortgage,
no bullshit,
none of that stuff.

1012
01:00:04.051 --> 01:00:07.590
It's just you still fucking,
you know,

1013
01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.800
figuring out what you want to do and go after it and uh,

1014
01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:13.200
tell that negative thought and you had to go fuck yourself.
There you go.

1015
01:00:13.201 --> 01:00:16.950
That was like a doctor Phil episode.
There you go.
That solves all your problems.

1016
01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:23.490
<v 6>Well we come back.
I yell at more men.
Yeah,
just work on yourself.</v>

1017
01:00:23.491 --> 01:00:27.240
The wrestle.
The rest will come together.
Don't worry about the girl part yet.

1018
01:00:27.241 --> 01:00:30.030
Just get,
get your own shit together.
I already said that.

1019
01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.230
Why did you feel like you get,
you keep trying.
Keep trying.

1020
01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:38.010
You keep trying to say,
you could try and be the person who says the last thing.

1021
01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:40.920
This is my podcast.
I wrap it up.

1022
01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.810
I wrapped it in me to come in here.
You wanted me to come in here?
I did.

1023
01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:50.490
So stop giving me shit.
You the next question.
All right.
Artificial intelligence.

1024
01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:51.780
Also known as Bill Burr.

1025
01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:56.250
<v 0>Oh Jesus.
Artificial intelligence.
And it's,</v>

1026
01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.940
as long as there's intelligence in there,
I'll take it.

1027
01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:03.560
And its impact on humanity.
Dill.

1028
01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:05.480
Dear Bilbo Baggins,

1029
01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:09.470
what are your thoughts on Tesla founder Elon Musk?

1030
01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:12.740
Warnings on artificial intelligence?

1031
01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:15.320
I just love the fact that you think that I actually read it,

1032
01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:19.580
he said that through recursive self improvement,

1033
01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:24.610
simple tasks like preventing spam could lead to an AI determining humans are the

1034
01:01:24.861 --> 01:01:29.850
problem.
It's just like a Scifi script and,

1035
01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:31.280
okay.
Yeah I got that.
I'm,

1036
01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:33.200
I'm totally interested but I don't know what's going on here.

1037
01:01:33.201 --> 01:01:37.970
Recursive self improvement means it could reason with itself.

1038
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.490
Oh this is a uh,
like when you make it

1039
01:01:40.610 --> 01:01:44.390
<v 6>pure that like has emotions like a human being.
No,
it's like,</v>

1040
01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:47.330
like he's talking about,
we're trying to get rid of the spam and email and stuff,

1041
01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:51.950
but whatever program is like,
wait,
there's a human being behind the spam.

1042
01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:52.461
There's a,

1043
01:01:52.461 --> 01:01:57.461
there's a human being behind the Nigerian prince scheme or the,

1044
01:01:57.531 --> 01:01:59.240
Oh my God friend.

1045
01:01:59.241 --> 01:02:03.860
I'm trapped in Denmark and I've had my passport and all my money like taken from

1046
01:02:03.861 --> 01:02:04.540
me and

1047
01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.400
<v 0>I don't think that is,
I think he's talking to AI.</v>

1048
01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:10.600
Simple tasks like preventing spam could lead to AI.

1049
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:12.430
Artificial intelligence is a computer.

1050
01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:16.010
<v 6>Yeah.
The robot determining humans are the problem.
Yeah.
Okay.</v>

1051
01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:19.890
So how is there a guy in Nigeria recursive self improvement?

1052
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:24.510
<v 0>It's realizing that human beings are behind the spam in your email.</v>

1053
01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.540
Like there's someone,
oh I see what you mean.

1054
01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:31.590
<v 6>I see what you're saying.
Okay.
Sorry about that.
Um,
that's going to be a long one.</v>

1055
01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.740
<v 0>Recursive self improvement means it could reason with itself and incrementally</v>

1056
01:02:39.741 --> 01:02:43.790
improved to overcome obstacles that prevent it from fulfilling its objectives.

1057
01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:48.530
I listened to previous podcasts and you've mentioned you think there would be a

1058
01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:53.090
backdoor built into any AI machine robots by the powers that be,
however,

1059
01:02:53.091 --> 01:02:58.010
using the recursive self improvement that Alon mentioned in AI could eventually

1060
01:02:58.011 --> 01:03:02.420
reason with itself that a backdoor preventing it from fulfilling its mandate

1061
01:03:02.421 --> 01:03:07.190
must be ignored or overcome.
Elon Musk is very intelligent,

1062
01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:12.250
having found founded paypal space x and Tesla as well as playing a key role in

1063
01:03:13.401 --> 01:03:17.930
solar city.
So I don't think his concerns should be taken lightly.

1064
01:03:17.931 --> 01:03:21.410
Here's a book that delves into the subject in more detail because I know you're

1065
01:03:21.411 --> 01:03:26.360
a deep thinker.
See what I'm saying?
They're all giving me shit.
Oh that's bloody.

1066
01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:31.520
Our final invention,
artificial intelligence and the end of the human error.

1067
01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:36.020
Thanks for your,
uh,
for your fucking opinion.
Um,

1068
01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:40.880
is this some like sort of like 1984 type shit like you know,

1069
01:03:40.881 --> 01:03:44.650
1984 was humans on humans.
Ah,
okay.
We'll see there.
It's just,

1070
01:03:44.651 --> 01:03:45.590
that's already going on.

1071
01:03:45.591 --> 01:03:48.800
That's already going on where someone who was our ally yesterday is now the

1072
01:03:48.801 --> 01:03:53.240
enemy and then the enemy is now the ally and vice versa and all that type of

1073
01:03:53.241 --> 01:03:53.490
show.

1074
01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:56.810
This is basically like the machines are getting so smart that they're going to

1075
01:03:56.811 --> 01:03:58.340
eventually like take over.

1076
01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.830
<v 6>Yeah.
Here's the thing about machines and yet they don't have legs.</v>

1077
01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:06.790
<v 0>Robots might,
maybe that's his whole point.
Like the robots,</v>

1078
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:10.600
the robots I'm afraid of,
but just like a computer,
right.

1079
01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:13.390
It's like you don't have legs and you have an ability,

1080
01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:16.420
an umbilical cord plugged into that fucking wall over there and I,

1081
01:04:16.421 --> 01:04:19.300
we'll snip that fucker and I will dump water on you.

1082
01:04:19.301 --> 01:04:23.500
And that's the end of use water on you.
Yeah.
Go dump water on your computer.

1083
01:04:23.501 --> 01:04:24.334
See what happened.

1084
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:26.430
<v 6>Aren't they talking about making robots?</v>

1085
01:04:26.431 --> 01:04:29.970
That'll be able to like surpass all of that shit and that's the scary part about

1086
01:04:29.971 --> 01:04:30.091
it.

1087
01:04:30.091 --> 01:04:32.970
It's like you don't want to give them too much intelligence because like he was

1088
01:04:32.971 --> 01:04:35.640
saying,
they'll learn that like,
hey wait,

1089
01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:39.370
I've got this whole back door thing and fuck that back door.

1090
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:42.570
Well cause they're going to evolve beyond that.
Here's the thing,

1091
01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:46.790
what people don't understand her.
Did you ever see that movie her with Hakim?

1092
01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.140
Phoenix,
there was too much red.

1093
01:04:51.130 --> 01:04:56.010
I was just too much red.
He was the only one really that word red.

1094
01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:59.210
But anyway,
go on.
Anyways,

1095
01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:02.790
this is what I feel people are actually acting like this.

1096
01:05:02.791 --> 01:05:06.600
Just some nerdy scientists,
angling communities.
How many patients,

1097
01:05:06.601 --> 01:05:11.601
anytime I can bullshit it isn't it's rich people and rich people at the top want

1098
01:05:13.171 --> 01:05:17.860
to phase out us.
The sick of us,
like we are an inconvenience to them

1099
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:21.790
<v 0>with our complaints and our needs.
They want us to shut the fuck up.</v>

1100
01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:22.781
They want us to all do.

1101
01:05:22.781 --> 01:05:26.260
We making fucking slippers for them for fucking 50 cents a month.

1102
01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.440
They want to have all the cars they want.

1103
01:05:28.441 --> 01:05:31.150
Like it's like I went to when I went to the farmer's market yesterday,

1104
01:05:31.151 --> 01:05:36.151
right to add to my feminine weekend of Pumpkin bread and driving a Prius that

1105
01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:39.550
speaking of which you need to store your strawberry is more correctly cause

1106
01:05:39.551 --> 01:05:41.440
they're just sitting out on the counter and they're going to go bad.

1107
01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:42.310
You know why?

1108
01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:47.050
You know I left them up there because strawberries out on the counter because

1109
01:05:47.051 --> 01:05:47.980
they're not organic.

1110
01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:51.130
I went to a farmer's market and they actually just have regular,

1111
01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:53.410
you have to ask them is this organic?
And then will be like,

1112
01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:58.150
oh you know we're forming is the blue book.
They can't even handle 200 people.

1113
01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:01.660
The grocery stores can handle 200 fucking people walking into a parking lot.

1114
01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:06.090
The by some God they mix.
They even have to get that money.
Like they just stay,

1115
01:06:06.091 --> 01:06:09.470
don't they?
They want,
they want it.
All the people at the top.

1116
01:06:09.471 --> 01:06:13.570
So can I have those tremors if you're not going to eat them.
Did you hear?

1117
01:06:13.571 --> 01:06:14.530
Did you hear that back and forth?

1118
01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:18.520
This is why we deserve to get fucking taken over right here because you can't

1119
01:06:18.521 --> 01:06:20.730
keep people on.
Do you just give a fuck about the strawberries?

1120
01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:22.700
I'm talking about the overall picture.

1121
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:28.500
I don't care if the strawberries are organic or not my cause right now I'm just,

1122
01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:31.880
I like strawberries so I'm trying to stay on topic with this.

1123
01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.750
Say can you come near the mic please?

1124
01:06:34.751 --> 01:06:37.830
So basically what is this person asking you?

1125
01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.900
So he's asking me if I'm worried about artificial intelligence.

1126
01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:45.220
I actually think that there's human beings behind it and it's going to play out

1127
01:06:45.221 --> 01:06:50.110
like the classic like Frankenstein where you build it and then it comes back and

1128
01:06:50.111 --> 01:06:51.040
kicks the shit how you,

1129
01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:54.950
but like I think you know a lot of people looking at us like,

1130
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:59.680
like human beings as a collective.
What are we doing?
We aren't doing anything.

1131
01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:02.980
You're expendable.
I'm expendable.
We're an annoyance to them.

1132
01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:08.230
What the reason why we're still here is because we pay taxes,
we pay interest.

1133
01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:12.130
They got their foot on the back of our fucking neck and we're helping to buy

1134
01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:17.150
some more fucking gold coins for them every single month.
But eventually,
but the,

1135
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:17.891
but the thing,
the,

1136
01:07:17.891 --> 01:07:22.891
the big flaw with human beings is that we complain and we pay attention and we

1137
01:07:24.191 --> 01:07:25.540
go,
hey,
that isn't fair.

1138
01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:28.990
And I think super rich people are sick of it and it'd be great.

1139
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:31.570
Wouldn't it be great if we could somehow get them to just work,

1140
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:35.200
not bitch and not have to pay him at all?
What is the solution?

1141
01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:39.880
Let's make some fucking robots.
Yeah.
But then you know,
the robots would be great,

1142
01:07:39.881 --> 01:07:43.900
but then who are we going to fucking pull over to the side of the road and have

1143
01:07:43.901 --> 01:07:47.260
him suck our dicks and our back of our limos?
Well,

1144
01:07:47.261 --> 01:07:48.760
we got to make a more lifelike.

1145
01:07:48.761 --> 01:07:52.120
So they're going to try to make these lifelike robots that will do whatever the

1146
01:07:52.121 --> 01:07:55.630
fuck they want and suck their dicks and work out in the fields and all that

1147
01:07:55.631 --> 01:07:58.570
fucking shit.
But that eventually they're going to get overrun.

1148
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.950
So you are concerned about artificial intelligence then?
No,

1149
01:08:02.951 --> 01:08:05.530
I'm not concerned about it because there's nothing to stop it.

1150
01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:08.110
I just was talking to you about it.

1151
01:08:08.111 --> 01:08:11.260
And your main focus is the strawberries right there.

1152
01:08:11.830 --> 01:08:16.010
That little microcosm of that fucking conversation is why I

1153
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:19.070
<v 6>tapped out a conspiracy theory.
I will not talk.
I'll,
I mean,
I'll just,</v>

1154
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:23.030
I'll do it on this podcast because I don't have list to somebody else.
Um,

1155
01:08:23.690 --> 01:08:28.270
either sand dad fucking bullshit or this or that or that or here's my even crazy

1156
01:08:28.271 --> 01:08:33.050
theory because I'm nuts.
Everybody's fucking nuts.
Uh,
everything has,
I think,

1157
01:08:33.051 --> 01:08:35.480
I believe everything has a beginning,
a middle and an end.

1158
01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:39.590
And a human beings are no different and uh,
you know,
whatever,

1159
01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:42.260
I'm going to die anyway.
So what the fuck do I care about?

1160
01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:45.260
Rich people being annoyed by non rich people.

1161
01:08:45.261 --> 01:08:48.850
I was just reading something online that was talking about a dear prudence,

1162
01:08:48.851 --> 01:08:51.890
you know,
like an advice column over the weekend or something.

1163
01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:54.320
And there was a rich person that was saying,
you know,

1164
01:08:54.321 --> 01:08:58.010
I live in a very wealthy community and um,
you know,

1165
01:08:58.011 --> 01:09:00.170
there are billionaires and stuff around us for the most part,

1166
01:09:00.171 --> 01:09:03.140
like the street where I live is his doctors and lawyers and things.
Anyway,

1167
01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.950
we just noticed that every Halloween there are all these people from the poor

1168
01:09:06.951 --> 01:09:09.710
neighborhoods that come in and like,
you know,

1169
01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:13.340
trick or treat and asked for candy and I just really feel like we're already

1170
01:09:13.341 --> 01:09:16.820
doing so much,
you know,
and paying so many taxes for this,

1171
01:09:16.821 --> 01:09:20.090
that and the other like does Halloween now has to become a social service.

1172
01:09:20.091 --> 01:09:23.900
And basically the advice gave her was like wow,
like you are an asshole.

1173
01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:26.600
Like it's Halloween,
it's kids in candy.

1174
01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:31.130
Like are you really trying to make a bigger statement about society or over

1175
01:09:31.131 --> 01:09:34.100
Halloween?
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1176
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:36.710
You canceled Halloween at our house.

1177
01:09:36.711 --> 01:09:39.680
Not because of any sort of like class issue.

1178
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:42.590
I canceled Halloween because people were coming over here.

1179
01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:44.150
That's and like fucking morons.

1180
01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:48.260
I don't want 40 year old people to standing there dead eyed looking at me like,

1181
01:09:48.261 --> 01:09:51.680
what's up with the candy or high school kids who isn't?

1182
01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:55.220
Isn't that what this guy's saying it in a way and have the decency.
All right,

1183
01:09:55.221 --> 01:09:57.770
well then let's take the age of the people.
I had been high schools,

1184
01:09:57.771 --> 01:10:02.330
kids who don't even have the decency to come in a fucking costume who don't even

1185
01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:05.360
have the decency to say trick or treat.

1186
01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.730
They stand there staring at you.

1187
01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:10.790
You would get an applause break and this guy's gated community right now,

1188
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:14.870
but it's like coming to Kaiser,
you know like women of color,

1189
01:10:14.871 --> 01:10:16.070
but that's what makes sense

1190
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:21.440
here and be like fucking weird about it.

1191
01:10:21.441 --> 01:10:23.210
I don't care if whoever,

1192
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:26.630
any kid that comes into the neighborhood from wherever they are,

1193
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:30.380
Halloween is awesome in that way because it's cute fun kids.

1194
01:10:30.381 --> 01:10:32.540
They're excited about going out there with their parents.

1195
01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:35.790
Their parents are like say thank you.
Say it like it's a lovely thing.

1196
01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:38.570
Give Out Candy to eight o'clock at night and then you turn the light out.

1197
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:40.880
That's the thing.
I just the,

1198
01:10:40.881 --> 01:10:44.090
the kids that come with no costumes and it's like I'm afraid they're going to

1199
01:10:44.091 --> 01:10:47.750
egg the house.
So I feel like I have to give them candy.
Like it's bullshit.

1200
01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:51.540
It's annoying.
I just want people to,
to reciprocate the,

1201
01:10:51.670 --> 01:10:55.400
the spirit of Halloween.
Okay.
If that's your question handing out candy,

1202
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:57.710
I need a little something from you too.
Can you imagine?

1203
01:10:57.711 --> 01:11:02.711
You're so broke that you look forward to Halloween so you can fucking walk up

1204
01:11:03.171 --> 01:11:06.080
and try to get a candy bar from another adult dealer has helped fucking the

1205
01:11:06.081 --> 01:11:10.190
moralizing that we're get.
We're getting off track.
We're getting off track here,

1206
01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:13.440
but there's also freeloaders out there too.
But this,
this the thing,

1207
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:14.761
<v 1>this is the thing,</v>

1208
01:11:14.761 --> 01:11:19.761
meaning is what that guy you saying is how a lot of rich people view people who

1209
01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:25.990
aren't rich.
We,
uh,
we should be privileged that we're in their

1210
01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:31.060
presence.
Yeah.
Like that type of guy,
that type of guy.

1211
01:11:31.061 --> 01:11:36.060
Do you think that that type of guy would give a shit if the rest of the world

1212
01:11:36.061 --> 01:11:39.930
got phased out and was replaced by robots that would work for him?

1213
01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:45.650
Would never go on strike and we're so lifelike that he could fuck them and it

1214
01:11:45.811 --> 01:11:47.250
would feel like he was with the person.

1215
01:11:47.251 --> 01:11:50.910
I mean that's their idea of utopia because they're fucking sociopath.

1216
01:11:50.911 --> 01:11:52.500
Not all of them,
but generally speaking,

1217
01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:57.290
there's sociopath's is at the beginning of most,
yes,

1218
01:11:57.310 --> 01:12:00.030
I find novels and it's like the convenience evidence.
Great.

1219
01:12:00.031 --> 01:12:02.500
And then the robots eventually take over.
Yeah.

1220
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:07.500
Because they're smarter than us and they've somehow been able to evolve beyond

1221
01:12:07.501 --> 01:12:12.390
our program,
which is kind of like what her was about a little bit.
And then,
yeah.

1222
01:12:12.391 --> 01:12:16.060
And then basically what happens is,
is then they forget that like they don't not,

1223
01:12:16.061 --> 01:12:18.900
oh,
uh,
well actually a Scifi movie,

1224
01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:23.901
what would happened was there'd be a few humans that they allow to live and then

1225
01:12:24.001 --> 01:12:25.200
we work for them.

1226
01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:29.130
It's basically the planet of the apes fucking template over and over and over

1227
01:12:29.131 --> 01:12:29.670
again.

1228
01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:34.650
And then we'd come back and either Mark Walberg Morris Chestnut or one of those

1229
01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:38.340
fucking guys would be,
um,

1230
01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:42.390
is that really his name?
Yes,
it is.

1231
01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:46.120
And that sounds like the name of a cat or is Jeff?
Yeah,

1232
01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:51.140
it does like somebody who like lives with cats and not people and then all of a

1233
01:12:51.181 --> 01:12:55.860
sudden just like it gives them like real names that over there that now that's

1234
01:12:55.861 --> 01:12:56.760
Maura's trash,

1235
01:12:56.761 --> 01:13:01.761
not strapping honking chocolate piece of gorgeousness that's in movies.

1236
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:04.200
You've never said that about me.

1237
01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:08.430
<v 0>All right.
Uh,
advice.
Okay.</v>

1238
01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:12.860
It sound like I you show on harsh.
I sound like I Iisha on archer.
Nope.

1239
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:16.800
Is um,
advice.
Hey Bill,

1240
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:21.280
fellow red head here and needed some advice.
Gigi,
Gigi,
age,

1241
01:13:21.281 --> 01:13:22.730
another freckle face here.

1242
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:27.270
I'm 21 years old and after two years of college I decided to drop out because I

1243
01:13:27.271 --> 01:13:31.470
didn't,
I simply didn't see a future that would make me happy.
Smart move.

1244
01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:33.240
You need to regroup,
figure out what you want.

1245
01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:37.620
I know I may have burned a bridge here and made an irrational decision,

1246
01:13:37.621 --> 01:13:41.160
but I really couldn't take any more of it since I felt like I was wasting my

1247
01:13:41.161 --> 01:13:45.570
time and effort and my dad's harder and money since he paid for the tuition.

1248
01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:49.470
My parents unexpectedly ecstatic,
but they are not furious either.

1249
01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:53.610
I have a job and all that stuff and I've been playing guitar for nearly four

1250
01:13:53.611 --> 01:13:55.740
years now,
so I'm not bad,

1251
01:13:55.741 --> 01:14:00.570
but not nearly as good as I want to be considering I like metal and crap like

1252
01:14:00.571 --> 01:14:01.380
that.

1253
01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:05.550
I'd really appreciate some advice on whether or not I made a terrible decision

1254
01:14:05.551 --> 01:14:09.840
because part of me said I did another set.
I didn't,
uh,

1255
01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:12.640
should I simply be more open about my future,
I should.

1256
01:14:12.641 --> 01:14:17.641
I pursue my dream of being a musician even though that's extremely a far off.

1257
01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:21.870
I think he meant to say far off and unrealistic.
Deep down,

1258
01:14:21.871 --> 01:14:26.230
I feel like I'll figure something out because I always have pass.

1259
01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:29.240
Wow.
When something big comes up and whatnot.

1260
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:31.730
Thanks to advance really like your work and your podcast,

1261
01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:33.410
you cheer me up with your jokes when life gets

1262
01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:37.900
<v 6>all right.
Yeah.
Dude,
why are you going to music school?
You're 21,</v>

1263
01:14:37.901 --> 01:14:40.780
you dropped out of college.
Maybe because,
uh,
it just wasn't,

1264
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:44.710
they didn't offer the kind of curriculum you were into.
So you said,

1265
01:14:44.711 --> 01:14:47.560
hang on a second.
I've been playing guitar for nearly four years now,

1266
01:14:47.561 --> 01:14:48.261
so I'm not bad,

1267
01:14:48.261 --> 01:14:52.000
but nearly as good as I want to be considering I like metal and crap like that.

1268
01:14:52.150 --> 01:14:55.480
Why don't,
why don't we sort of take this back to the first advice that you gave?

1269
01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.080
Why don't you find like telling me what to do?
Why don't you shut up?

1270
01:14:59.350 --> 01:15:04.140
You look gorgeous this morning,
by the way.
See how you do that people.
Um,

1271
01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:07.210
anyways,
I meant it.

1272
01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:12.211
I meant to go to law school music programs so you can get better and

1273
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:18.190
play guitar.
Keep playing guitar every second.

1274
01:15:18.191 --> 01:15:21.190
It's like the first advice you can give.
Here's the big,

1275
01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:24.730
there's a big thing in this email.
I ride my ra,

1276
01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.100
my impression of red metal.

1277
01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:31.600
<v 0>Um,
this is why school is so fucked up.</v>

1278
01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:34.810
This guy is literally ignoring his heart,

1279
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:38.680
staying in school cause he's following the fucking heard.

1280
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:42.100
This guy wants to play guitar.
Dude,
let me ask you this.

1281
01:15:42.101 --> 01:15:45.700
How happy are you when you're playing guitar,

1282
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:49.150
when you're doing other activities?
Are you thinking,
I wish I was playing guitar?

1283
01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:53.410
That that's what you supposed to be doing on whatever level.

1284
01:15:53.411 --> 01:15:54.800
And if you think you're not good enough,

1285
01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:56.650
you've been playing guitar for four years.

1286
01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.230
You can be a rhythm guitarist in a band.

1287
01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:01.960
How cool is Malcolm Young?

1288
01:16:01.961 --> 01:16:06.550
He wrote all those fucking rifts for ACD to poor guy's got them sick now,
man.

1289
01:16:06.551 --> 01:16:10.750
Sucks.
Um,
but anyways,
like uh,

1290
01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:14.080
that's what you do.
Join a fucking band.

1291
01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:17.140
Just join a band going down on a music store.

1292
01:16:17.141 --> 01:16:19.780
They always have those fucking things.
A little,
a little,

1293
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:22.720
we were looking for a rhythm guitar or something for this.
Yeah,
the little fly.

1294
01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:26.650
Just do that and just make your whole life about music.

1295
01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:30.730
Give Guitar lessons.
Just your whole fucking life becomes music.

1296
01:16:30.731 --> 01:16:33.130
And then eventually you're going to be,
you're going to be in the music world.

1297
01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:37.390
You might end up,
uh,
who knows,
being a producer for albums,

1298
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:40.920
you might end up being an abandoned,
makes it,
you might end up managing bay.

1299
01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:43.690
You're going to be in the music business.
You're going to be around music,

1300
01:16:43.691 --> 01:16:46.120
which is what you love.
Okay.
I think there's a reason that you did it.

1301
01:16:46.121 --> 01:16:48.040
I think the the reason why you thinking,
oh,

1302
01:16:48.041 --> 01:16:51.610
maybe I shouldn't have done that is because 99% of your friends are all,

1303
01:16:51.611 --> 01:16:52.160
you know,

1304
01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.850
I got two more years of college and I majored in this and I'm going to go out in

1305
01:16:54.851 --> 01:16:57.310
the job world and we get married,
have two and a half kids,
blah,
blah,

1306
01:16:57.370 --> 01:16:59.830
which is fucking fine if that's what you want to do,

1307
01:16:59.831 --> 01:17:02.050
but you do not want to do this.
You want to play guitar,

1308
01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.780
so you made a great decision.
Congratulations.

1309
01:17:04.781 --> 01:17:09.120
And the balls at that took to fucking walk away from college,

1310
01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:11.260
didn't have the balls to do that.
I felt like I had to finish.

1311
01:17:11.261 --> 01:17:14.300
I've got to get a degree,
I got to get a degree and a,

1312
01:17:14.301 --> 01:17:16.460
I should have just went right down to a comedy club.

1313
01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:21.290
I knew from the time I was 14 years old that I wanted to be a standup comic and

1314
01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:25.370
it took me until I was 24 to finally get the balls up to do it.

1315
01:17:25.371 --> 01:17:29.030
So you're way ahead of the game,
you're going to be fine.
All right.

1316
01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:30.500
And I've got to go to work here.
So that's,

1317
01:17:30.501 --> 01:17:33.650
that's going to be in here for the podcast.
Thank you everybody for listening.

1318
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:36.530
Thank you to the lovely Nia for dropping in.
You're welcome.

1319
01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.660
The next time I'm coming,
come on here though.

1320
01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:41.870
We need to talk about some of the stuff I heard you screaming about earlier.

1321
01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:46.250
About what?
Something about women and something ignorant that you say,
which is,

1322
01:17:46.251 --> 01:17:49.220
I guess it's a fuck show.
What did I say?

1323
01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:53.280
They said a bedpan smashed across.
Okay.
You think that's just,

1324
01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:54.890
it's a wrestling reference.
Well,

1325
01:17:54.891 --> 01:17:57.830
you talking about Ebola or something like that too.

1326
01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:01.620
I don't know what it was or something like that.
Something along those lines.

1327
01:18:01.621 --> 01:18:04.940
Does.
Speaking of that ignorance,
I gotta,
I gotta,
I gotta read some advertising.

1328
01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:09.410
Um,
I thought I heard you're doing that.
Are there,
well,
I've got one more left.

1329
01:18:09.411 --> 01:18:13.700
Hulu plus everybody.
You've probably tried Hulu on your computer.

1335
01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:35.720

Pretty much any streaming device you already own.

1339
01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:48.530
You should be blocking off a day,
just a bench.

1340
01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:51.800
That's a little extreme with Hulu plus you're in total control.
