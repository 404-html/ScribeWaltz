00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.490
Hey,

00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:09.140
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast,

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.270
I know my voice is still fucked up.
I'll be back or maybe I shredded it for life.

4
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.740
What am I doing right now?

5
00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:19.520
I'm sitting on a pullout couch and what is supposed to be my office,

6
00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:23.270
but no work gets done in here.
Um,

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.150
just fucking chilling out and I got a little half a grapefruit here then I'm

8
00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.640
going to eat later cause all freckles.

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.700
It's a fat fuck and he's turning it around.
That's what I'm doing.

10
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.050
I'm turning around.

11
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.860
I'm not going to try to blame Hollywood for fucking given me an impossible body

12
00:00:40.871 --> 00:00:44.260
image to live up to.
I'm going to,
I'm going to use it as a goal.

13
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.090
All these fucking pussies out there nowadays.
Ooh,
that's too hard.
Yeah,

14
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:53.290
it is hard.
Eat An apple.
Gets you a Fedex at the gym.

15
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.560
That's what America needs right there.
Now for this fucking,

16
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.030
I don't know.
What does patty cake?
We're fucking playing with everybody.

17
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:06.180
Jesus fucking Christ.
You live in a great country.

18
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.130
There's too many cookies.
All right.
No,
that and leave the house.

19
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.233
It's all you gotta do.

20
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.190
Fucking sitting here blaming Arby's for your fat ass.
Hating on those.

21
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.500
Those fucking Victoria secret models are,
are uh,
uh,

22
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.380
whoever the new fucking Brad Pitt guy is with his fucking Apac.
Huh?

23
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.260
Oh,

Fuck you.
You Fat.

24
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.460
You ate a big king every fucking day for the last 20 days.
That's your problem.

25
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.300
It's not society.
It's that you have a car.

26
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.480
They have a drive through and you have singles in your wallet.

27
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.550
Where are you going to spend it?
Drive you fed s down to the supermarket.

28
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:51.220
Just like my dough.
He midsection.

29
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.450
I'm bringing it down there looking like the fucking freckled.

30
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.600
Imagine the Pillsbury Pillsbury dough boy with like freckles.

31
00:01:56.601 --> 00:01:59.030
That's what I'm looking right now.
Like my fucking shirt on.

32
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.660
Put on a good 12 pounds a writer's room.
Wait,
you know,

33
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.410
you know what I like to go for?
I like the Hershey's many inches,

34
00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:09.590
Get that fucking sugar rush.
And I'm like,
Whoa,
Whoa,

35
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.510
Then I eat a handful of fucking pretzels.

36
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.680
Bring me back down with the salt and then where am I?
Oh,

Oh,

37
00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:18.170

Then I,
ah,
let's get a fucking pizza.

38
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.940
I'm just going to have one slice,

39
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.990
four slices hot right down the fucking pie hall.

40
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.740
And who am I blaming?
Huh?
My blaming those whores on Instagram.
I'm not,

41
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.210
not me.
I've taken responsibility for my gluttonous.

42
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.020
I am a fucking,
oh,
I'm not a mess.
I'm turning around

43
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.290
old daddy white legs here.
Get up to almost a buck 86 you know,

44
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.240
now I'm back down to a buck 82 my goal is just to be in the one seventies if I'm

45
00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:55.070
in the fucking one seventies by the time we're done with the next two episodes,

46
00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:57.710
right.
In a couple of two,
three pounds of the next two weeks.
Right.

47
00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:01.210
I can do that shit even though the of July is coming up.
Right.

48
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.010
And that's the big day we celebrate Independence Day.
You know,

49
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.980
wasn't that today we had the fight with the British and we said a one if by land

50
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:16.750
two if by sea and get those native Americans off my property.
Isn't that,

51
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.230
isn't that what happened on that day?
Um,

52
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.710
we declared independence from England on July 4th,

53
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.410
1776 we were like,
we're sick of you oppressing us.

54
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.510
We would like to be the oppressors and it's took us almost 300 years to get

55
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:38.530
there and God dammit what?
We're doing it as good as England ever did it.

56
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.990
Take that fuck.
Oh

57
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.993
<v 2>mmm.</v>

58
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.500
<v 1>Anyways,
I've got to drink the throat coat tea.</v>

59
00:03:45.501 --> 00:03:49.130
I don't know why I never drank this before.
I got to tell you,

60
00:03:49.131 --> 00:03:51.590
you know something that's fucking delicious as a god damned grapefruit,

61
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.470
not a regular grapefruit.
A goddamn grapefruit.

62
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.720
They're right next to the sun kissed.
You go in there and you,
hey,

63
00:03:56.721 --> 00:04:00.230
you got a goddamn grapefruit and I'm sorry we only have Sunkist and then you
say,

64
00:04:00.231 --> 00:04:03.500
well fuck you buddy.
Fuck you and your create a salary.

65
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.430
That's what I'm back to salary at night with my little scoop of fucking peanut.

66
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.560
Right?
I'm six months into this year by drinkings back under control.

67
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.200
Not that we'll bring your drinking back under control like eight fucking corona

68
00:04:18.201 --> 00:04:21.770
lights that somebody left them my fucking fridge.
Jesus Christ.

69
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.430
But slowly knocking those things back one a day and it's just such a horrible

70
00:04:27.741 --> 00:04:30.890
experience.
By the end of it,
it's like I not only do I not want another,

71
00:04:30.891 --> 00:04:35.510
I don't think I ever want to drink again,
you know,
so whatever.
So,

72
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.460
um,
only had one cigar this month,
so I've had nine for the year,

73
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.120
so that's good.
Right?
It's going to go off the rail soon,
right?

74
00:04:44.121 --> 00:04:48.140
We got 4th of July and then I got fucking the European run coming up,
you know,

75
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.963
and uh,

76
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.980
I was on a flight and I somehow discovered this part of sagacity section.

77
00:04:55.401 --> 00:04:59.420
Natto um,
it's places to smoke.

78
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.670
If you like cigars,
people go on cigar affects you now.
Dot Com.

79
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.170
And you click on search cigar affects you.
Not a oneF who knew?

80
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.120
Um,
I thought it was spelled like after with two F's.
Right?
Kidding.

81
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.070
I just love all the people when I play up.
How stupid I am.

82
00:05:16.071 --> 00:05:19.640
They just love you know,
you guys Dominic or nick?
Nah,

83
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.770
you're right next to me at the Applebee's.
Right?

84
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.750
Just order your fried fucking pickles.
You cont mm.

85
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.753
<v 2>MMM.</v>

86
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.081
<v 1>Scarf.</v>

87
00:05:27.081 --> 00:05:32.081
Actually not a oneF as in fuck and a Google places to smoke.

88
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.110
I mean it's just,
it's fucking,
it's incredible.
So

89
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.100
I've um,
I've done that all across Europe,
but I just did it like every,

90
00:05:43.101 --> 00:05:46.010
like fifth city or something.
So I don't go off the rails when I'm over there.

91
00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:48.320
So I got a couple of days in London,

92
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.310
I'm going to smoke there and then I think I'm just gonna fucking haul ass for

93
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:56.270
the rest of the trip and maybe take a few days off,
little vacation,

94
00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.160
little a day,
you know,
somewhere down the Mediterranean,

95
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.530
right.
Look at old fancy freckles.
Do you like this?

96
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.920
What a fucking life flunked everything in High School,
Huh?
Yo,

97
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.320
you did two years of a language.
Now you don't,

98
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.390
you just need to be a silly comment and have enough people get into you and all

99
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:15.650
of a sudden you too,

100
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.000
you too can not add up how much your vacation costs and then get a credit card

101
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:24.140
bill would be like,
oh,
what the fuck?
It's one of my favorite things.

102
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.790
I might sound a little more jovial than usual.
Uh,
there's a reason for that.

103
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.240
There is a father as a fucking reason is the great Sam Kinison would say.

104
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.050
I um,
I uh,
I finally bought a car.

105
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.710
Daddy bought a whip.
Oh look who's here.
The Levenia,

106
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.180
just in time for me to talk about my new fucking car.
Let's turn up the mic.

107
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.410
Nini,
I got to tell you I bought,
you know what I bought?

108
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.080
I bought the BMW bitch magnet.
That's what it's called.
No,
I didn't buy a BMW.

109
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.850
I bought a Jaguar.
Um,
and I ordered it.

110
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.290
I bought a Jag and I,

111
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.980
and I ordered the color cause I didn't want to be another douche driving a
black,

112
00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:11.600
white or fucking red car as they may call me.
A douche.

113
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.320
Driving.
Driving a what does that British racing green.
Yeah.

114
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.500
Like every Jag was supposed to be.
Oh,
you're hate.

115
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.580
You're hating on me right now.
It's fucking beautiful.
Clay.

116
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.960
Is it freezing in here?
You notice that I'm wearing like,
oh,

117
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.360
you're fucking Apollo 13 jacket.
Yeah,

118
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:33.330
go turn off the AC bombers.
Oh,
cause it was,
it was hot as hell in here.
Oh,
okay.

119
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.020
Yeah,
I'm a white.
The cold doesn't affect me.

120
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.760
You know how I get on the beach and it looked like I'm having a heat stroke.

121
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.020
You sitting there frolicking around where it's in this grade.

122
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:50.021
I'm under that giant fucking umbrella looking like it was my final wish to go to

123
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:55.670
the beach for the first time ever in my life.
It of my life number,

124
00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:59.690
that guy.
Do you know what somebody told me to buy on the,
uh,

125
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.680
on the old inner web there is Richard Rawlings says,

126
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.830
don't start saying inner webs.
I love when he says that.

127
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:12.050
Why I love that guy kicked yourself so much.
Cause I look at him going,

128
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.410
he flunked everything in high school too and he still made it.

129
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.610
They put so much emphasis on being smart in school.

130
00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:21.720
You don't have to pick everything in school.
What was your,

131
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.100
when I say I flunked everything,
uh,
the ceiling,
the glass ceiling,

132
00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:26.960
I couldn't push through with Cs.

133
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.500
And then there was a bunch of D's and then just the,
uh,

134
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.180
the math was just the old right there.
Fred.
Ugh.
What about,

135
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:39.740
I've never shown you my fucking,
I think there's still,
I have this desk,

136
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:41.900
my parents don't throw anything out.
It's still in there,

137
00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:44.300
and every once in a while there's this little thing and I open it up to,

138
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.310
oh my God,
really?
Oh,

139
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.570
when I was showing you all my my achievement certificate.
Yeah.

140
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.380
Opposites attract Neil,
but it's like a,
it's a bunch of D's,

141
00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.450
C's and it's just,
it's English and stuff like that.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

142
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.070
I stopped going.
I stopped getting A's and B's.
Right.

143
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.590
I did well until through junior high.

144
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.180
And then when it counted

145
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.550
when the fucking college is going to have to do more than share,

146
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:15.511
the greatest thing,

147
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:20.240
the greatest thing I ever did was completely fuck up in high school because why?

148
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.570
Because if I did well,
if I did well and I lived the dream

149
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:31.170
like and I w and I got accepted into a big time college that had a great fucking

150
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:38.511
football program and I joined a Frat and I had penny loafers with no socks on

151
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:42.240
and all that just live in the white guy dream,

152
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.170
we definitely wouldn't be right if I did that.

153
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.010
Like I,

154
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.850
I just think I would have been doing so well in life that getting into this

155
00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:57.960
business never would have dawned on me.
I would've been like,
well,
I can't leave.

156
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.580
Right.
I'm driving a convertible Audi.
I got,
uh,

157
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.820
I got the extra special cubicle and I don't think I would've done it,

158
00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:10.821
but the fact that I fucked up so bad that my options were only going part time

159
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:18.170
too low level schools and unloading trucks that then going and doing an open mic

160
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.340
get wasn't as scary.

161
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:25.320
Like what was I walking away from lower back pain?
I mean look at me now,

162
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.240
Sciatica,
I think it's cured penny loafers with no socks.

163
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.220
I feel like that's a big red flag to me.

164
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:35.450
Like there's just something about it that I just,
yeah,

165
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.490
it's like when black people with no socks,

166
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.280
that's like certain white people see black guys in hoodies.

167
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.450
It's the same thing.
Yeah.
It is.
Say,
well,
no,

168
00:10:45.451 --> 00:10:47.910
it isn't because of the power structure,
but it's the same thing.

169
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.260
You're totally looking at him.

170
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.690
You look at those penny loafers with no socks and you're like,

171
00:10:51.691 --> 00:10:54.330
frat boy date rapists.
Yeah,
that's true.

172
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.490
There are a frappe way we agreed to have aggressive sex and you ended up face

173
00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:03.480
down and dead in a park.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yes.

174
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:07.650
You're allowed to say that.
Yeah.
I'm not allowed to say that.

175
00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:09.870
I'm not allowed to see a black guy with a Hoodie at 12 midnight.

176
00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:10.441
This will be like,
oh,

177
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:13.410
he's working on an app and he just came outside to stretch his legs.

178
00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:18.020
Then I ended up in a trunk of a car.
Uh,
but I do,

179
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.570
I do feel that way and I know that that's a stereotype and I know that that's

180
00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:24.940
wrong.
Why do you have yes.
Yeah.
Well,
you know if,

181
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.580
but why do you have like Kennedy isn't,

182
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.920
you have like you have this Trump white eyeliner on here.

183
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.720
Oh No,
I think that's my eye cream that I didn't fully blended.
Oh God,

184
00:11:36.721 --> 00:11:41.550
you're spoiled.
Spoiled.
I think that's my eye cream.
I put it on at night.

185
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.850
That's a bad stereotype.
What is that?
All preppy guys.

186
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.540
Preppy white guys or serial killers or date rapists.

187
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.950
But I feel like if they were to be,
they would get away with it.

188
00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:02.640
Okay.
I just feel like it's,
it's a safe is money.
It's a safe thought.

189
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:07.350
The think as a woman.
Hmm.
Just go with the bad.

190
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.000
So you get home in one piece?
Yeah.
If you think somebody is going to eat you,
you,

191
00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.860
you got to go with that thought and just,
just avoid,

192
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.210
regardless of how many people's feelings you hurt.
Right.

193
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.290
But like I get just people wearing like,

194
00:12:21.291 --> 00:12:23.690
so how do you think white people should handle pants?

195
00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.590
How do you think white people should handle the other situations and like boat

196
00:12:27.591 --> 00:12:32.591
shoes and like blazers or like shorts with whales on them.

197
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.593
Man.
You got you.

198
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:43.620
Gotta you fucking got this person down or like their hair is is so perfect and

199
00:12:43.881 --> 00:12:48.410
they've got their like color pop,
just so on.
They're like Ralph Lauren,

200
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.790
like yellow button down.

201
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.800
You got issues with salmon shorts and like a white belt with a blue stripe down

202
00:12:56.991 --> 00:12:58.310
the middle of it.
So one,

203
00:12:58.311 --> 00:13:01.160
if a guy like that came walking up to you and started talking to you in the
club,

204
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.820
I would feel very,
what is your name?
Is it something nick?

205
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.060
My name is Scott [inaudible].

206
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.760
Scott.
Uh,
no,

207
00:13:16.761 --> 00:13:18.680
I'm being very stereotypical right now.

208
00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.770
There are plenty of those guys that are a part of the yacht club and the golf

209
00:13:21.771 --> 00:13:25.070
and glove and I'm are there.
Lovely peak.
Where did you meet those people?

210
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.490
I've never been,
I'm really white.
I've never met those people.
I'm just,
yeah,

211
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.130
I'm being,
I'm being stereotypical and it's wrong.

212
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.440
Do you know one time I met he wasn't,

213
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.780
he wasn't like a waspy guy was a Jewish guy.
Right.

214
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.540
And I was at this wedding for buddy of mine who was Jewish.
Right.

215
00:13:38.541 --> 00:13:43.250
So I was like one of the only gentiles there and I just moved to fucking

216
00:13:43.251 --> 00:13:47.240
Manhattan and this guy fucking big league to me,
big time,
right.

217
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:52.070
I was living in this hour walkthrough bedroom on 97,

218
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.960
eight 97th street.
Right.
And uh,
you know,

219
00:13:56.961 --> 00:14:00.170
crack heads,
smoking,
anything to thing the total New York experience.

220
00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.640
Like the first night I'm laying in my single bed,
you know,
just,

221
00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.580
he's like a little kid bed and uh,

222
00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.570
like a roach walked across my chest at night and I just thought that was part
of,

223
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.260
I didn't even kill it.
I just thought it was part of the New York experience.

224
00:14:14.261 --> 00:14:18.020
I was like,
all right man,
I need to get tough.
So I was like,
fuck it.
All right,

225
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.500
bugs are going to crawl on me.
I can take this shit.
Right.
So I go to the,
uh,

226
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:26.030
but I'm still excited.
It's such a German,
Irish toughie.
Fucking dope.

227
00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.930
You guys will put up with any yup.
And that's why we die young.

228
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:30.140
That's why we die young.

229
00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:34.970
One day I'll let it all out and I'll do that epic cry like that Black Dude on

230
00:14:34.971 --> 00:14:39.620
the the intervention because I still,
and I'll be like,

231
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:46.463
<v 0>ah,</v>

232
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.300
<v 1>watched that yesterday.</v>

233
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:54.530
The cry of a man who hasn't cried and like it was a baby.

234
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:59.120
We watched that yesterday in the writer's room and then we watched one of the

235
00:14:59.121 --> 00:15:04.121
worst ones ever because I love the Guy Mike Schmidt retiring from baseball.

236
00:15:05.721 --> 00:15:10.550
We watched that one and it's such a shame the amount of shit that that guy gets.

237
00:15:10.551 --> 00:15:13.130
Cause he could literally at this still at this age,

238
00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:15.760
he could literally pick me up and throw me out of the major league in yeah,

239
00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:19.950
field.
I would land in shallow left,
but he just goes like,
you know,
whatever.

240
00:15:19.951 --> 00:15:22.350
Like I forget how it went.
It was like 20 years ago,

241
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.000
a boy left Blahblahblah Wisconsin.

242
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.750
What are the hell he was with the dream to play manager.

243
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.140
He went all the way.
I was like,
oh no.

244
00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:36.180
So somebody had that video manager and then they immediately cut to the black.

245
00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.960
I got,
dude,
we fucking died,

246
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:43.440
we fucking died.
And I was actually sitting there when I was watching that,

247
00:15:43.441 --> 00:15:44.820
how hard we were all laughing.

248
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.310
I was wishing I could reach out to the person that made that.

249
00:15:47.311 --> 00:15:51.060
Cause I would be psyched if I wasn't in this business and a bunch of people in a

250
00:15:51.061 --> 00:15:54.450
writer's room right now on a fucking show.
Like we don't laugh at Shit,
dude.

251
00:15:54.451 --> 00:15:56.130
We will fucking dying.
So I mean,

252
00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.830
I wish my standup got that kind of fucking left right room.

253
00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:03.550
It's all are what's the setup was a tracking and all of that ship.
So,

254
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.150
um,
anyways.
Um,

255
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.320
all right.
So where are we now?
Where are we talking about?

256
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.790
We were talking about your car.
Oh yeah.
Your Jaguar.
Jaguar.

257
00:16:15.791 --> 00:16:19.670
So like about the Jaguar,
the Jaguar,
the XF.
Are you excited for it?

258
00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:22.780
I'm so fucking excited.
I'm not excited that it doesn't come for,

259
00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:24.460
it's 100 days away.

260
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:29.190
That's what happens when you order a custom color down every single day.
Yeah.

261
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.180
If you don't mind,
can I be excited about this?

262
00:16:31.181 --> 00:16:35.370
I drove a fucking Prius for nine years.
You're right.
Yes.

263
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:39.310
I've been gay bashed for the better part of a decade.
Driving that car.
Yes.

264
00:16:39.311 --> 00:16:42.610
Long overdue.
I can tell you that's a hot fucking car though.
The Prius.

265
00:16:42.611 --> 00:16:46.160
I've had two people already offered to buy it.
Buy it off here.

266
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:50.620
I know that car has done right by us.
Yes it is.
Hello.
It's smells.

267
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:56.110
You got a detailed that one time and then we came home and it was a hot day and

268
00:16:56.111 --> 00:16:58.000
the windows were up and whatever that chemical was,

269
00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.450
they put in the seat if fucking this baked in there and like,
yeah,

270
00:17:01.451 --> 00:17:03.280
I know how to get it out.
Yeah.

271
00:17:03.281 --> 00:17:07.970
It's like somebody died in there that cleans houses.
No,
wait.

272
00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:12.220
It doesn't smell like somebody died in there.
It's just as God,
uh,
you know,
uh,

273
00:17:12.221 --> 00:17:13.300
a certain,
yeah,
yeah.

274
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:15.970
Eat something and you kind of think you like it and then there's that weird

275
00:17:15.971 --> 00:17:17.330
aftertaste and you're like,
Whoa,

276
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.260
we can't sell it until we figure out how to get rid of that.

277
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:25.030
You need to learn to talk into the mic.
There you go.
Okay.
You know what?

278
00:17:25.031 --> 00:17:29.680
They're not,
they'll just pick a hike.
Can hear me.
All right,

279
00:17:29.681 --> 00:17:33.020
I'm gonna turn you up.
I'm

280
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.340
sorry.
It's because of you.
Hey,

281
00:17:39.341 --> 00:17:42.580
I like that or that Remy Ma just cause she's shot somebody.

282
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:43.780
That'd be fucking great.

283
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.500
So many people in that genre act like they would do shit like that,

284
00:17:47.501 --> 00:17:50.490
but at the end of the day,
like what am I a fucking idiots?
I got a Bentley.

285
00:17:50.491 --> 00:17:51.870
I don't need to be shooting people.
Yeah.

286
00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:54.780
She actually shot somebody and she went to jail for it.

287
00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:59.650
I don't think she's like proud of it by any means,
but,
well no.
You know what?
No,

288
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.340
I had to see her out and do it.
I'm not advocating shooting people.

289
00:18:02.341 --> 00:18:06.240
What I'm saying,
what's cool is that if she talks about shit like that,

290
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:10.080
you know that she's not pretending.
Oh,
I certainly wouldn't fuck with her.

291
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.050
Like I'm still waiting for Robert Blake to put out an album.

292
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.430
You know he fucking flake.
Yeah,
he plays guitar.

293
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.220
He's not dead.
No,
he's out.

294
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:25.070
I went into a guitar shop one time and he was in there.
No,
at the,

295
00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:27.200
I would run the other way.
He's so scary.

296
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:34.050
Don't go to bed with the price on your head.
No.

297
00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.120
So you enjoy it.
You enjoyed watching the bet awards with me.

298
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.330
I did the whole prince tribute and all that.
It was fucking tremendous.

299
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:45.960
Fucking tremendous.
I don't know why you guys were upset about the Oscars.

300
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:47.310
You guys have a better award show.

301
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.600
Just do one yourself and show us how to do a good one.

302
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.120
I don't know why the fuck you're trying to get there.

303
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.801
Yeah,

304
00:18:58.801 --> 00:19:03.801
our shows generally it seems to be more fun but oh Jesus.

305
00:19:04.651 --> 00:19:07.890
Where the hell is no,
no,
it's not more or less fun.

306
00:19:07.891 --> 00:19:10.110
It's just you're going to be able to be yourselves.

307
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:17.310
I don't know who that is.
I don't know what the fuck happened.

308
00:19:17.311 --> 00:19:20.010
All of a sudden I got on this list like congratulations,

309
00:19:20.011 --> 00:19:24.840
your business has one and just hang up.
What kills me to say keep calling,

310
00:19:24.841 --> 00:19:27.900
which means somebody out.
It's enough people at works on.

311
00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.040
There's enough people that sit there congratulation.
Like Holy Shit.

312
00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:38.110
Is it an eight,
four,
four number?
Cause I have some weird eight,
four,

313
00:19:38.111 --> 00:19:40.800
four number that keeps calling me and it's business.
But you know,

314
00:19:40.801 --> 00:19:44.820
they have those machines that like just try every single combination of phone

315
00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:48.210
numbers and whatever one hits and someone picks up there like,
hello,

316
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.050
I have some exciting news for you.

317
00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.230
It's not exciting.
It's fucking annoying.
You know what the worst is,

318
00:19:59.231 --> 00:20:02.760
is when I'm out walking Cleo and I'm listening to some song,
right?

319
00:20:02.761 --> 00:20:05.550
I'm listening to some songs.
So of course,
any song that I listened to,

320
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.360
I am onstage with the band playing drums and I'm killing it and they're all

321
00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:13.740
turning around looking at me like,
wow,
this guy has more skills than we thought.

322
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.210
That's what I do at the entire time.

323
00:20:15.211 --> 00:20:19.620
I'm out there fantasize and then all of a sudden the phone comes on and I'm on.

324
00:20:19.621 --> 00:20:20.760
Whenever it's a random number,

325
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:23.730
I just think it's some radio station that I used to do and that's always good

326
00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:26.670
for business.
I pick up the phone,
I make people laugh drivetime you know,

327
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.280
whatever.
I'm not even in the city and they're hearing me make them laugh.

328
00:20:29.281 --> 00:20:30.300
Maybe they'll come up to a show.

329
00:20:30.301 --> 00:20:34.570
So I always pick up and I'll be like in the middle of a was I was listening

330
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.760
queens of the stone age today.
I was listening to them and uh,

331
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.770
what was the sound guy that ain't gay,
gay,
gay day,
day,
day,

332
00:20:40.771 --> 00:20:45.771
day and nicotine them like a day or in marijuana will haul all this coke.

333
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.720
I'm just fucking listen to it.
Of course I'm on the drums aren't gay.
Gay,
Gay,
gay,

334
00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:56.860
gay,
gay,
gay,
gay.
Fucking killing it.
Josh has turned around called wow.
Right?

335
00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.530
Totally impressed.
Which will never happen.
Right?
So

336
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.530
I can dream.
And then the fucking photo ring.
He's impressed with you,

337
00:21:05.531 --> 00:21:08.880
but not for your musical skills.
I know he's not impressed me.

338
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:12.970
Why would you say that and ruin this great story.
Sorry.
Um,
he fucking,
uh,

339
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.090
so I'm walking down the street and the fucking phone rings and then I stopped

340
00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:19.800
listening to that and I fucking,
I pick up,
it was like,
congratulations.

341
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.340
Your fantasy as all my,
your,
your business ladder won a free trip to a room.

342
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.300
<v 3>Wait a minute,
wait a minute.</v>

343
00:21:25.301 --> 00:21:29.440
So even if you know you don't have a radio station to yours is still pick up

344
00:21:29.441 --> 00:21:34.100
random numbers.
Yeah.
You have to stop doing that.
Also.
Why wouldn't,

345
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.960
<v 1>do you ever think you ever like dialed somebody dialed a number incorrectly?</v>

346
00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.760
Well,
I guess you don't do it that much anymore,

347
00:21:40.761 --> 00:21:44.270
but every once in a while you just fucking dial a number and you dial it wrong.

348
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:48.230
You ever think you actually called somebody famous?
Like they have phones,

349
00:21:48.231 --> 00:21:49.520
they got to get wrong numbers.

350
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.910
They don't pick up numbers that they don't recognize.
Yeah,
they do.

351
00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:56.530
You don't think j Lo picks up.
It's like,
oh,
whatever.

352
00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:01.130
She sounds like as it go.
She goes,
I'm just,

353
00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.350
I'm just checking the box.
I don't have to fuck.

354
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:08.420
He says you wouldn't pick up like Bill Clinton.
I don't understand that.

355
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:13.430
Bill Clinton picks up random numbers.
Oh,
of course.
He does
know.
He does.
He's like,

356
00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:19.130
oh,
could this be,
I dunno what now he's looking like very frail.
Uh,

357
00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.770
yeah,
he's old and Vegan now.
So I feel like,

358
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:23.870
is that why he looks like a scarecrow that came to life?

359
00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:30.200
If a scarecrow fucked a snowman for scarecrow fucked a snowman.

360
00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:34.640
That's what he looks like cause he's keys is pasty is a snowman and his skinny.

361
00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.450
I've never felt more alive.

362
00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.140
He comes at you with that fucking chicken neck.

363
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:47.590
<v 3>Can we talk about how you kind of lights up like in the same vein as you picking</v>

364
00:22:49.281 --> 00:22:53.930
up numbers and being like,
yeah,
sure.
How you just don't pay attention.

365
00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.460
What stuff?

366
00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.520
Like what happened when I asked you to get minute rice and grapefruit.

367
00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.700
What did you bring home?

368
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:07.350
<v 1>A cantaloupe and a regular rice.
20 minutes.</v>

369
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.210
I thought Uncle Ben's was always minute rice.
Thought he had shit the dope.

370
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:17.400
I haven't dentally I'd be,
I was wrong.
Ben Can hang around.

371
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.193
<v 3>Okay.</v>

372
00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.380
<v 1>Came on with the cantaloupe.
What do you want from,
it was delicious though,</v>

373
00:23:22.381 --> 00:23:22.720
wasn't it?

374
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.261
<v 3>It was,</v>

375
00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:26.830
but I just feel like he would just get a vague idea of like what's supposed to

376
00:23:26.831 --> 00:23:29.650
happen.
It just kind of run with it like you're like,

377
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:33.790
oh that's around melon fruit or something.
Not even a melon.

378
00:23:33.791 --> 00:23:35.190
You weren't even supposed to get a Mellon.
Just,

379
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.710
you just knew it was round and it was probably next to the grapefruit and he

380
00:23:38.711 --> 00:23:41.410
just grabbed it.
Not Thinking

381
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.480
you want to do,
you know it's

382
00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.220
<v 1>all right.
So I bought you a nice fucking car,
right?</v>

383
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:52.820
And you park and under a tree.
So I got this fucking the top,

384
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:57.710
the tarp that fits your car like a fucking glove and you're not putting it on

385
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:01.310
and the fucking saps coming down on your car.
So I sit there and go near.

386
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:03.590
Why don't you put the top on the car?

387
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:08.150
Like is there any way somebody could turn back the tree?
It's like,

388
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.690
or you could just put the fucking tarp on the car.
I know.

389
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.750
I feel like that she needs to be cut back in general.

390
00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:18.610
Why that tree is right outside can hear you right now.

391
00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:20.680
Don't worry buddy.

392
00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.000
You're not going anywhere cause it's just trapping those weird things all over

393
00:24:25.001 --> 00:24:29.170
the place called nature.
Nia,
we live,
we shouldn't even be out here.

394
00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.700
That trees should be out here.

395
00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.720
I'm not saying that you should cut it down and like it should be just cut it

396
00:24:34.721 --> 00:24:39.100
back.
That's all I'm saying is cut it back or maybe like cut it so that it grows.

397
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:42.280
Why don't you just put the fucking tarp on the car,
putting a tarp,

398
00:24:42.281 --> 00:24:46.060
the tarp on the car.
You Go,
it's soft.
Okay.
Yeah you do have a problem.

399
00:24:46.061 --> 00:24:48.790
Cause I went down there and it was shit all over your car and I'm telling you

400
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.510
the fucking last night.
And what happens is a lot of people don't know this.

401
00:24:52.511 --> 00:24:54.040
I learned this the hard way.
What happens is,

402
00:24:54.041 --> 00:24:55.660
and I'm explain this and I know you don't like this,

403
00:24:55.661 --> 00:25:00.370
but I'm explaining when the fucking SAP gets on your fucking car,
you got to,

404
00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.380
I'm not talking to you.
You got to get it off.

405
00:25:02.381 --> 00:25:04.540
Because what happens is when your car heats up,

406
00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:10.020
the paint expands and then at night when it cools off a contracts again and it's

407
00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:14.350
like a motion,
right?
The SAP and the paint become one.

408
00:25:14.351 --> 00:25:16.740
It's like a tattoo and then it's underneath your fucking paint.

409
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:20.040
You can't get it out.
At least that's what the guy at the car wash told me.

410
00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:22.650
Cause I was like,
Hey,
what about these spots here?
And he's like,
oh my friends,

411
00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.690
my friend,
we're not friends.
Tell me what happened.

412
00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:32.160
So I like your blue dress.
Thank you.
I got it yesterday.

413
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:38.190
What'd you get it?
Top shop.
Top shop.
Is that expensive?

414
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:43.530
No,
I'm actually good.
Good Job Nini.
Get a red one too.

415
00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:48.230
I like top shop.
The Monday morning podcast sponsored by top shop.

416
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.290
Top shop.
That would be great.
Where you too.
Why?
Cause it's send me some dresses.

417
00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:56.460
Yeah.

476
00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:46.060
we're doing the record for a,
actually still number eight.

477
00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:49.750
We're writing number nine.
Everybody,
I'm coming out the fucking,

478
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.060
what's that thing that comes out?
The Golfer,
right?
Groundhog.
Groundhog.

479
00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:57.730
Groundhog pokes his fucking head out.
Can you imagine if my head came out?
Honey,

480
00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:02.390
how many more weeks of winter would that be?
Um,
all right,
that's 30 minutes.

481
00:30:02.391 --> 00:30:04.600
It'll be alone winter.
It's going to be a long winter.

482
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:10.060
And I'll never forget 2016 with,

485
00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.660
eight 99.

486
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.640
But I don't think that's the kind of thing that we underneath the boat and we

487
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.060
think that's what the refugee special.

488
00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:29.470
I think that's the kind of thing where it's like we have to work on the boat.

489
00:30:29.471 --> 00:30:34.450
When we got there,
like 4,000 other people at the,
at the buffet line.
Oh yeah.

490
00:30:34.451 --> 00:30:35.860
You can't even get a cruise for that.

491
00:30:35.861 --> 00:30:39.340
There's no fucking way you're getting on this.
Yeah.
What is the boat look like?

492
00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:42.790
I don't know.
It's a dinghy.
Yeah.

493
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.060
<v 1>All right.
Well,
I don't know.
I'll have to,</v>

494
00:30:45.061 --> 00:30:47.400
I'll have to do something evil to ever be able to afford that,

495
00:30:47.401 --> 00:30:52.380
but it's nice to notice.
Um,
all right.
That's it.

I had to do the pyramid game.

498
00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.270
That's the only reason why I'm leaving.
Oh,

All right.

499
00:31:03.271 --> 00:31:05.820

Let's do it.

501
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.140

502
00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:14.550

Yeah.

503
00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:19.530
No days off.
Yeah.
This is how much fun this fucking is.
Okay.

504
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.910
That's why I fuck around the advertising.

505
00:31:20.911 --> 00:31:25.260
I don't give a shit if they here or not.
I'm still gonna do it.
Alright,

506
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:29.760

507
00:31:29.761 --> 00:31:32.940
They're a what did we do that to $10,000 pyramid?

508
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.090
<v 3>Yes.
Well,
because it all came about because we were talking about how you just</v>

509
00:31:37.091 --> 00:31:39.490
notoriously,
uh,

510
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.140
sorta just guests things wrong or it was really more about how your,

511
00:31:44.141 --> 00:31:46.420
your movie titles.
That's how it started.
Yeah.

512
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:51.030
You know where I go the last days of drag?
Yeah.

513
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:55.770
<v 1>Instead of saying Pearl Jam,
I'd be like a flannel shirt.
Oh,
I'm in a trance.</v>

514
00:31:56.250 --> 00:32:00.330
This music's making me go crazy.
I don't like George Bush.
Right,
exactly.

515
00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.310
But I knew that one.
That's Eddie vetter.
Yeah.
So,

516
00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:07.390
<v 3>and so then we started playing the pyramid game.</v>

517
00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:10.780
<v 1>Alright.
So evidently I sucked at given clues.
Let's see if you're better.</v>

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.400
All right.

You received like I thought I also gave,

520
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.640
I thought we both know.
No,

We both did.
No,
it doesn't matter.

521
00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:29.940
But now you do.
Do you have them in your head?
Uh,

I know what's in it for next time then.
No,

523
00:32:34.061 --> 00:32:37.750
you can't do that to people.
Well,
I'm sorry people.

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:32.750
And in the game there was four of them in each corner and you and your friends

552
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.910
like hit it and they had to like,
oh,
I hit ball.
Yes.
Ah,

553
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.210
I thought you meant the ocean.

554
00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:42.200
<v 1>Ah,
fuck.
That's something like three minutes to get,</v>

555
00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.170
you should have said that.
Hungry,
hungry because I didn't want it to be too easy.

556
00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:51.020
Oh,
there you go.
I could have done better.
No,
that was good.

557
00:34:51.021 --> 00:34:54.080
See you make them hard.
They make 'em hard then it's done the bit last longer.

558
00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:58.790
Make it easy.
Easy.
So I'm you open when it rains.
Umbrella.

559
00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.480
Okay.
All right.
I have to go.

560
00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.760
All right.
100 more days counting down.

561
00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:12.110
Can't wait.
All right.
Uh,
that's the Thursday afternoon podcast.

562
00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.580
Enjoy the music that's coming up.
Have a great July 4th weekend.

563
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:17.990
Uh,

564
00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.140
thank you to everybody in this country that's come out to my shows and thank you

565
00:35:21.141 --> 00:35:25.970
to England for losing that great battle today on a July 4th.

566
00:35:25.971 --> 00:35:29.240
Right.
Then they lose a battle.
Then we signed a paper like,
ah,
you motherfuckers,

567
00:35:29.241 --> 00:35:33.470
we got,
you
know,
I know,
I know what it is.

568
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:34.880
We declared our independence.

569
00:35:34.881 --> 00:35:38.940
I just liked doing it because it makes them feel superior and that's right where

570
00:35:38.941 --> 00:35:43.920
you want them just coming in.
What do they call themselves?
Cozy,
smug cans.

571
00:35:43.921 --> 00:35:47.040
And then you give him the old right there,
Fred.
All right,
that's it.

572
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.290
Go fuck yourselves.
Have a wonderful weekend and I'll talk to you on Monday then.

573
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:58.040
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

574
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.770
oh,

575
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.400
okay.

576
00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:36.060
Oh

577
00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.780
Yay.

578
00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.720
<v 4>Hey,
what's going on?
It's still births.
The Monday morning podcast.</v>

579
00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:12.460
What the hell today?
June 29th June 30th date.

580
00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.640
I don't know.
I don't know where it is.

581
00:37:15.641 --> 00:37:20.230
It's the last Monday in June and I can't believe how much the summer is just

582
00:37:20.231 --> 00:37:24.910
flying by
Jay.
When somebody say said that every fucking summer,

583
00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.110
you know,

584
00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:29.770
you know it's gonna fly by because the weather's awesome cause it's fun.

585
00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.250
It's like eating cookies.
You know,
you open a bag,

586
00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.630
you think you're just going to have one.

587
00:37:34.631 --> 00:37:37.870
Next thing you know the whole bag's gone.
You know why?

588
00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:42.120
Because they taste delicious to you really need some douchebag to stand there

589
00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:45.760
next to you is going like,
can you believe how good those cookies were?

590
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:50.490
I can't believe they're already God.
Um,

591
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.380
I wish someone would say that in the winter.

592
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:55.560
Can you believe how fast the winners going by?

593
00:37:55.830 --> 00:38:00.830
What kind of person would say that some Soda Mountain man was into snowboarding.

594
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.690
All right.
That was awesome.
I don't fucking,

595
00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.610
it's the Monday morning for Monday,
June 30th.
Sorry.
Okay.

596
00:38:08.611 --> 00:38:12.190
I was riffing and I was looking up what the date was.
All right.

597
00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.670
As I've told you guys in past podcasts,

598
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:18.780
I have one of the oldest still functioning laptops out there.

599
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:23.100
I told you mine is,
that's actually made out of Birch.
I uh,

600
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.390
I got it down at the pottery barn back when they used to sell laptops.

601
00:38:27.391 --> 00:38:31.230
A lot of people don't know that.
They think that they were just into furniture,

602
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.420
but there was a moment there where they stay,

603
00:38:33.421 --> 00:38:36.220
tried to branch out into a computers and electronics.

604
00:38:36.221 --> 00:38:40.060
And needless to say it's fail.
And uh,
actually,

605
00:38:40.061 --> 00:38:41.830
you know what I was thinking about getting a new laptop,

606
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:46.360
but I'm good friend of mine told me how to add more memory to this one.

607
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.960
So I'm thinking,
why the fuck?
Why would I go out and get a new one?

608
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.370
I don't understand why people keep going out and buying new laptops.

609
00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:59.820
Like they're fucking Steven Spielberg and the dumping like hours of film

610
00:38:59.831 --> 00:39:03.100
footage,
you're not doing it.
Okay.

611
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.900
They cost like two,
three fucking grand.
What are you doing?

612
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:12.130
You know what I mean?
Do you ever just stop and think what the fuck you're doing?

613
00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:17.580
Just get off the Goddamn fucking hamster wheel for a second and just realize how

614
00:39:19.391 --> 00:39:24.391
ridiculous it is that you spent $2,500 on something and it's acceptable that the

615
00:39:25.901 --> 00:39:30.520
thing is going to shit the bed within fucking two years.
It's been two years,

616
00:39:30.521 --> 00:39:31.354
something's going to happen.

617
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:34.960
You know the battery is going to mess up and then you're going to go down to the

618
00:39:34.961 --> 00:39:38.950
Mac store or the fucking Bill Gates store,
whatever the hell they got out there.

619
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:43.840
And then it'd be like,
yeah,
I'm,
it's not under warranty.
Can we fix the year?

620
00:39:43.841 --> 00:39:44.830
We can fix it.

621
00:39:44.831 --> 00:39:49.831
Book or two 50 for some stupid fucking reason is going to cause 2100 and a new

622
00:39:52.301 --> 00:39:56.470
laptop is 25 so you know,
I mean,

623
00:39:56.471 --> 00:40:01.390
we'll fix it,
but you know,
the whole thing is fucking bullshit.

624
00:40:01.391 --> 00:40:05.860
There's no reason they should cost that much.
You know what,
you know something.

625
00:40:05.861 --> 00:40:07.960
If nerds had any fucking brains,

626
00:40:07.961 --> 00:40:10.000
the amount of pussy they would be getting right now

627
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.330
just by fixing their friends,

628
00:40:13.331 --> 00:40:18.331
laptops and saving everybody 2,500 bucks instead of charging people 1800 why

629
00:40:18.611 --> 00:40:23.590
don't you charge charge like 500 bucks?
You fucking nerds go out,
you know,

630
00:40:23.591 --> 00:40:28.240
buy something flashy that always attracts the horse.
They liked that,
you know?

631
00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:33.220
No.
Just to give yourself a little makeover with,
with the,
with your laptop,

632
00:40:33.221 --> 00:40:36.970
fixing abilities,
money,
you know,
like one of those bad eighties movies,

633
00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.480
you could turn your life into like a montage,
you know,

634
00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:44.350
play some songs like the fine young cannibals as some chick takes you to the

635
00:40:44.351 --> 00:40:48.100
mall,
you know,
takes off your glasses.

636
00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:51.700
I always hated that in those fucking movies.
Like we'll never like somebody,

637
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:55.340
you know,
whenever they were going to have like a,
like the nerdy check all,

638
00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:57.910
all of a sudden become gorgeous.
Right?

639
00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:01.750
Like the way they made her ugly was they put her hair up and they made her wear

640
00:41:01.751 --> 00:41:04.420
black frame glasses.
You know what I mean?

641
00:41:04.421 --> 00:41:08.170
Like you still couldn't see that she was gorgeous.
You know,

642
00:41:08.171 --> 00:41:11.470
and then they just take her hair down and then she took off her glasses and

643
00:41:11.471 --> 00:41:16.120
everybody was like,
oh my God,
who is that?
You know?

644
00:41:16.121 --> 00:41:19.840
And then the date rape is football player comes up to her and then she always

645
00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.950
like a,
it's like no,
I don't think so.
You know,

646
00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:27.820
you didn't like me when I,
when I had my hair up and I was wearing these glasses.

647
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:31.090
Okay.
But this nerd over here,
he always liked me.

648
00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.510
So now we're going to go to the prom and we're going to dance and that's going

649
00:41:34.511 --> 00:41:36.470
to be the end of the fucking movie.
Okay.

650
00:41:36.471 --> 00:41:39.530
And I always hated that moment in the movie cause it always reminded me that I

651
00:41:39.531 --> 00:41:43.940
was watching a movie because in real life,
okay,
that girl,

652
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:47.720
as much as she liked the nurse,
she wouldn't like him in that way.
Okay.

653
00:41:47.721 --> 00:41:49.700
They can't help but send that fucking DNA.

654
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:52.220
They want to breed with the strongest cock in the room.

655
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:54.980
And I don't care how much of a Dick,
that guy,

656
00:41:54.981 --> 00:41:58.970
that quarterback was being toward the second she got the attention that that

657
00:41:58.971 --> 00:42:02.810
would fill her up because all those years they have in her hair up wearing those

658
00:42:02.811 --> 00:42:07.730
fucking Malcolm x glasses,
gave her low self esteem.
And uh,
she,

659
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:12.970
she would at least for a four to six year period would have to go out and fill

660
00:42:16.311 --> 00:42:19.190
herself up with,
please accept me cock.
You know,

661
00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:23.300
before she kind of was able to regroup and be like,
you know what,

662
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:27.320
these guys are assholes.
I wonder what that nerds up to.

663
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:32.360
And by then it will be too late because a nerd's generally,
you know,

664
00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:36.860
they marry the first thing that a lot of,
let them fuck them,
you know.

665
00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:40.190
So by the time she,
she,
you know,
she runs through,
you know,

666
00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.710
the time she found a fucking,

667
00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:47.060
the place kicker that nerd is already married with three kids and he invented a,

668
00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:48.620
he invented the IFE.
Wait a minute,

669
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:52.270
these teeth fucking event in these damn laptops they've got,
that's,

670
00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:55.740
that got to get repair.
And every couple of years that's their fucking Quebec.

671
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:58.400
Wow.
I just figured that out.

672
00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:03.950
That's why there's no Goddamn nerds out there being able to fix these fucking

673
00:43:03.951 --> 00:43:06.650
laptops for 500 bucks.

674
00:43:06.651 --> 00:43:10.010
It's all 1800 bucks cause they're mad that when they gave the fucking nerdy

675
00:43:10.011 --> 00:43:12.430
chicken make over,
she's still blew the quarterback.
So now,

676
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:17.240
now we got to pay for it spots.
Ridiculous man.
All right.

677
00:43:17.241 --> 00:43:20.510
This is the Monday morning podcast and uh,
my name is bill burr.

678
00:43:20.511 --> 00:43:23.130
I do one of these every fucking Monday.
And uh,
you know,

679
00:43:23.131 --> 00:43:26.270
I'll give you something to laugh about and uh,
you know,

680
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:31.310
keep you in my thoughts.
Actually keep me in your thoughts.

681
00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:32.270
That's why I'm doing this.

682
00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:34.400
I'm not doing it because I give a fuck about you people.

683
00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:37.910
I'm trying to give you guys a reason to keep coming back to my site and maybe

684
00:43:37.911 --> 00:43:40.670
you'll tell other people to come to my site.
So the next time I go to Raleigh,

685
00:43:40.671 --> 00:43:44.510
North Carolina,
I'm not standing in front of 25 people,
you know,

686
00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:48.860
so then I can make some more money and then I can buy some shiny shit and then I

687
00:43:48.861 --> 00:43:51.890
can make up for the fall,
all the fucking pussy.
I never gotten high school,

688
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:54.710
see how that works.
So anyways,
I did one of these,

689
00:43:54.711 --> 00:43:58.490
every week I talk about stuff that I have coming up in my career.

690
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.940
I talk about a comedy date and uh,
you know,
whatever,
like,

691
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:07.150
like it is a great example for you.
I have a,
a,

692
00:44:07.151 --> 00:44:09.470
an upcoming CD DVD release.

693
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:13.560
I just like saying that CD DVD release,
um,

694
00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:18.210
and a one hour comedy central special.
Um,

695
00:44:18.211 --> 00:44:22.010
that will be shown.
I believe it's August 23rd.
Um,

696
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:25.730
it will be shown the first time cds coming out in August.
The CD,

697
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:30.560
I don't have an exact day yet and the DVD is coming out in September.

698
00:44:30.561 --> 00:44:34.440
I don't have an exact date for that.
I just have a month at this point.
Okay.

699
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:38.910
So cool.
You fucking jets.
All right.
We got July 4th coming up.

700
00:44:38.911 --> 00:44:43.410
Just relaxed.
There's plenty of holidays between now and the God damn release.

701
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:45.900
And when I get the information,
I'm going to let you know what's up.

702
00:44:45.901 --> 00:44:49.980
So that's what I have coming up.
Okay.
It's gotta be an account during that.

703
00:44:49.981 --> 00:44:53.220
So let me try it.
Let me,
let me try to say it a little more clearer.
In August,

704
00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:58.140
I have a CD coming out and a one hour comedy central special.

705
00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:03.330
Um,
and then in September,
the DVDs coming out.

706
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:07.260
So a by October,
you guys should all be sick of me,
but by then,
uh,

707
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:11.070
hopefully I'll be filthy,
stinking rich.
I'll have a brand new,

708
00:45:11.071 --> 00:45:15.870
a Ludwig drum kit and a big house and I'll stand up there

709
00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:20.940
naked with the bathrobe.
That's partially open looking down on the city,

710
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.490
realizing that I'm still empty inside.
Okay?

711
00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:27.330
But we're going to cross that bridge when we get to it,
man.
All right.
Uh,

712
00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:31.620
people ask me questions every week on my podcast and I like to try to answer

713
00:45:31.621 --> 00:45:34.710
them.
People also send me in stories.
They give me information.

714
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:37.500
What do you want to start with?
First?
You want to start with the questions?

715
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:41.760
You want to go with the stories?
How about a story?
Let me scroll down here.
Okay.

716
00:45:41.761 --> 00:45:43.570
Last week,
you know,

717
00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.980
people were talking about their cars getting fucked up and everything like that.

718
00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:50.240
God Damn it.
Somebody sent me a funny one and I forgot to copy and paste.

719
00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:51.630
I gotta read that one next week.

720
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.170
But I told you last week I was going to tell you the second half,

721
00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.950
basically everyone was telling me these stories about how their car got fucked

722
00:45:58.951 --> 00:46:00.420
up and then everybody's story.

723
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:04.620
They were the victim except for this one dude who talks about how he was hitting

724
00:46:04.621 --> 00:46:08.070
on some fucking chick and she doesn't want to hook up with them.

725
00:46:08.071 --> 00:46:12.810
So he goes out in the parking lot,
hammered and backs his car into another truck.

726
00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:16.470
And I was trying to tell him,
you know,
you're not really the victim there,

727
00:46:16.471 --> 00:46:19.560
so it's,
it's uh,
it's kind of hard to feel bad for you.

728
00:46:19.561 --> 00:46:24.561
So what the fuck did the girl do that made you do something like that?

729
00:46:25.081 --> 00:46:26.550
That we should all feel bad for you?

730
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.950
Me and my 14 podcast's listeners should feel bad for you.
So here he goes,
this,

731
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:35.430
this is the other half.
This is his reason for doing that shit.
Hey Bill,

732
00:46:35.431 --> 00:46:39.030
thanks for reading my story.
Share my gloom with everyone.
Ha Ha.

733
00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:42.900
Let me tell you what happened with girl number one.
All right.
This is why he got,

734
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:47.370
he got pissed in the club,
was a little tipsy drunk,
got in his car,

735
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:52.530
evidently did not look
stomped on the gas and backed into a truck.

736
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.820
Fuck his car up and didn't do shit to the truck.
All right.
And he said,
uh,

737
00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:57.511
right being the girl,

738
00:46:57.511 --> 00:47:01.410
we've been working together for about a year now and everyone in this building

739
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:02.580
would like to get with her.

740
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:07.410
We've been on and off talking a lot or not at all.

741
00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:12.390
It's a big company.
She's kind of a teeth.
She'd kind of a tease.

742
00:47:12.391 --> 00:47:14.660
Okay,
well,
you know,
I'm going to take your word for it,
but I mean,

743
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:19.790
because she's a good looking woman who's got a lot of cock coming at her and uh,

744
00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:24.210
you know,
maybe she's a little defensive.
Um,
anyway,
she kind of a tease,
but hell,

745
00:47:24.211 --> 00:47:27.290
I don't care.
She's damn hot.
And I haven't sealed the deal yet.
All right.

746
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.400
Now I'm rooting for you.
That's right.
Go in there and fucking hit it.
All right.

747
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.910
I was damn sure that this was the night.
Um,

748
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:37.750
I was gonna Hook up with it because we were hanging out and talking a lot for

749
00:47:37.751 --> 00:47:42.751
the few weeks leading up to this particular night out since it was her birthday.

750
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:46.930
Okay.
So here he is,
you know,
chat or up to two weeks,

751
00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:50.710
he's go into patient rooms as opposed to those other guys who are walking into

752
00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:55.720
the cubicle with their pants already,
half on zip.
You know,
I respected,

753
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:58.780
everybody likes a full court press,
but a,
that usually doesn't work,

754
00:47:58.781 --> 00:48:02.470
especially if you weren't dockers.
It's just creepy.
So anyway,
so this guy,

755
00:48:02.471 --> 00:48:07.150
you know,
works if the two weeks,
now it's your birthday.
Okay.
And uh,
let's see.

756
00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:12.340
And apparently most girls like to get down on the day when the clock rolls over.

757
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.020
Okay.
I'm with you anyway.

758
00:48:14.021 --> 00:48:19.021
I completely fumbled the ball by not paying enough attention or not flirting

759
00:48:19.241 --> 00:48:20.770
enough.
That night assumption.

760
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:25.600
And I got pissed when I knew that this was probably the last chance I had,

761
00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.380
which then led to the aforementioned story.

762
00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:34.750
So basically you did two weeks of reconnaissance.
He went out there,

763
00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:39.780
it was their birthday and you're trying to hit on her to close the deal.

764
00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:44.290
And basically every other hot chick that walks by,
you're looking at it.

765
00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.153
You know what,

766
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:49.120
there's not one person in their early twenties that does not have that fucking

767
00:48:49.121 --> 00:48:54.010
story.
It's just what it is.
It's just pussy as to,
it's still too amazing for you.

768
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:55.121
With the,

769
00:48:55.121 --> 00:48:58.480
you're in your thirties you'll be able to block out the other ship and you'll be

770
00:48:58.481 --> 00:49:01.540
able to focus on your target.
And uh,

771
00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.050
of course by then you'll be in your thirties.
So you'll be hitting on some,

772
00:49:05.051 --> 00:49:09.370
a cougar as they say.
I hate that fucking word.

773
00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:13.900
And I hate those broads who think they're still fucking hot,
like they're 22.

774
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:16.420
Okay.
I'm not saying you're not hot for a 43 year old,

775
00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:21.040
but we stopped wearing shit that 22 year old chicks were,
you know what I mean?

776
00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:25.030
I just turned 40.
Okay.
My days of wearing a half shirt

777
00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:32.200
and fucking socks up to my knees,
like I'm in that movie dazed and confused.

778
00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:36.130
You know what I mean?
You look at me like I was a retard.
All right.
Stop it.

779
00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:39.940
You're hot for your age.
You look good for your age.
Okay.

780
00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:42.690
But let's leave it at that.
Okay.
Let's,
uh,

781
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.870
you're in your dressing elegant years.
You're in your address.
Classy.

782
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:52.240
Okay.
You know,
once you're past fucking,
you know,
I dunno,

783
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:56.140
somewhere in your mid thirties,
if you're still dressing like a Jello shot girl,

784
00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.530
I don't know what to tell you.
You know what that's like.
That's like the fucking,

785
00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:04.930
the form of muscle head who stopped working out,
but he still has the Hulk Hogan,

786
00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:09.350
Hogan Wardrobe,
you know,
so he's still got on the tank cars,

787
00:50:09.351 --> 00:50:12.880
but now he's got those flabby grandmother arms and it's just like,
dude,

788
00:50:12.881 --> 00:50:17.450
you need to get a full shirt or start doing some curls because,
uh,

789
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:19.570
yeah,
it's not working.

790
00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:24.870
It was like Billy Crystal's grandmother and uh,
Mr Saturday night number down,

791
00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.490
they were making sandwiches out of her arm,
the fat on the back of her arm.

792
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:32.780
Um,
all right.
So anyway,
it was so when it,

793
00:50:32.781 --> 00:50:34.910
so you got pissed because you weren't able to close the deal,

794
00:50:34.911 --> 00:50:39.140
then you're backed up and smashed your car.
That's actually fucking hilarious.
Um,

795
00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:41.270
that's a whole different segment.

796
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:45.380
The car stories I was trying to get people to tell is,
you know,

797
00:50:45.381 --> 00:50:49.730
you went in to go buy some a face moisturizer and you came out and your bumper

798
00:50:49.731 --> 00:50:53.820
was gone.
You know,
the whole,
I didn't do shit and uh,

799
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:58.780
somebody raped me stories.
Um hmm.
I guess you created a new one.

800
00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:02.550
People who fuck up their car because they were trying to fuck the hot chick at

801
00:51:02.551 --> 00:51:07.010
work on her birthday.
They and uh,
I dunno,
they looked at some other chick.

802
00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:11.590
I don't know what happened.
Anyways,
whatever man to man,
I feel bad for you.
Okay.

803
00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:15.860
Is a last story I'm going to read here.
Um,
all right,
bill a,

804
00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:19.360
your rants and American Airlines ring true as they screwed a marine.

805
00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.840
I met while on vacation.
I don't know if you guys listen to this shit every week,

806
00:51:22.841 --> 00:51:25.480
but American Airlines,
fuck me.
Over a while,

807
00:51:25.481 --> 00:51:29.350
back to the point I did a puff daddy,
a remix of their song.

808
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:33.790
Um,
when little something like this,
we're a bad kid.

809
00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:38.150
Fucking you.
[inaudible]

810

811
00:51:42.541 --> 00:51:45.900

All right.
While returning from Mexico,

812
00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:49.650
I was in DFW airport.
I love when people write their DFW.

813
00:51:49.651 --> 00:51:54.510
Like I know what the fuck that means.
Is that Detroit fucking where?

Oh,

The Delaware.

816
00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:06.390
I don't know Detroit fucking,

817
00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:10.740

he's at DFW airport.
A K and I in Nepal.
You pilots out there.

818
00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:16.130
Hey,

Lax is actually okay.
JFK,

819
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:20.160

people know that.
But stop saying DFW.
Like I know where the fuck that is.

820
00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:24.840
All right.
I was in Dfw airport and uh,

No Voc.

821
00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:29.850
I'm in the OCC.
Barely.
I don't know what the fuck that is.
Orange County.

822
00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:34.500
I still don't know what that is.
It's south of Los Angeles.
Thank you.

823
00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:36.020
Thank you.

824
00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:39.810
Do you mean that place that nobody fucking goes to in between Los Angeles and

825
00:52:39.811 --> 00:52:44.520
San Diego?
All right.
I was in DFW airport and met this guy at the tram.

826
00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:49.420
Oh,
fuck that shit.
That word just makes my skin crawl.
All the airports I've been,

827
00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:53.610
I was at the tram.
Uh,
I met this guy at the tram who was fuming mad.

828
00:52:53.611 --> 00:52:55.280
He told me he was headed to,

829
00:52:55.380 --> 00:53:00.090
to Gulf Port Mississippi from California and the plane had engine trouble and

830
00:53:00.091 --> 00:53:00.924
had to return.

831
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:05.190
He then caught the next flight and then had the land in Dallas due to bad

832
00:53:05.191 --> 00:53:10.020
weather.
He was then told that all swore off flights out.
We're on standby.

833
00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:13.500
And while talking to the gate agent,
the employee,
he got pissy with them.

834
00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:14.880
What a fucking surprise.

835
00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:20.340
He mentioned that he had orders and needed help getting any flight out and the

836
00:53:20.341 --> 00:53:24.480
Clark said,
sir,
I can't help you.
Please enjoy your night in the airport.

837
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:29.220
After the marine calmed down,
I asked him what airline he was on.
He replied,

838
00:53:29.221 --> 00:53:33.060
mother fucking American Airlines.
They suck.

839
00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:37.920
I hope they go under Jesus Christ.
Even fuck over a guy.

840
00:53:37.921 --> 00:53:42.921
Was he in uniform sharing help you please enjoy your night in the airport.

841
00:53:43.681 --> 00:53:48.240
Really,
please enjoy this fucking
Timberland to you.

842
00:53:48.241 --> 00:53:52.650
I already said the c word enough in this God damn thing.
It's ridiculous.

843
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:56.270
You know something and you know,
just go on their website.

844
00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:58.410
Just start complaining and I'm really trying to do that shit.

845
00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.200
You know what I mean?
Somebody's got to do something that's,
you know what I mean?

846
00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:05.250
If somebody fucking do something,
do they respond when you complain?

847
00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:07.860
Somebody sent me a fucking email about a,

848
00:54:07.861 --> 00:54:12.120
they returned something at best buy and they charged them a 15% restock fee,

849
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:16.020
which basically they bought something,
it sucked.
They brought it back.

850
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:19.560
Okay.
If it costs a grand,

851
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:23.400
they charge them 150 bucks just to put it back on the shelf.

852
00:54:23.401 --> 00:54:27.330
So they still make money.
So personally I'm never shopping at best buy again.

853
00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:31.380
That's it.
I'm done.
That's what I'm saying.
That's just like,
you know what,

854
00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:33.930
I'm not eating fast food ever again,
man.

855
00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:37.380
So it basically means I'm not fucking with best buy for three months.

856
00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:40.500
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I said let's get,
let's get on with the questions.
Okay.

857
00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:44.100
Just fucking,
this podcast started off really good and now it's just,

858
00:54:44.101 --> 00:54:47.370
it's brining to a fucking halt.
Let me see if I can up the comedy here.

859
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:51.150
Take it up a notch.
Okay.
This podcast is like,

860
00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:55.110
it's like the Lakers in game six.
You know what I mean?

861
00:54:56.370 --> 00:55:00.300
I never seen a team with west heart.
Jesus Christ.
I'll fix her up by 40 points.

862
00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:04.620
They're still shooting three pointers.
You think he would have put up with that?

863
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:06.900
Kareem,
those guys would have been throwing elbows,

864
00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:10.920
Larry Bird and all of them would have been holding up the trophy looking like

865
00:55:10.921 --> 00:55:15.000
Bobby Clark and the Lakers just stood there and watched it.

866
00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:19.890
All right.
Questions number one.
By the way,
I'm a Celtics fan and yes,

867
00:55:19.891 --> 00:55:21.330
I am totally psyched and I'm sick.

868
00:55:21.331 --> 00:55:24.210
All you Laker fans talk to me and me about buying them.

869
00:55:24.211 --> 00:55:29.070
Guy Like he's the second coming of fucking Bill Russell and Michael Jordan.
Okay.

870
00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.990
You guys need to work on your heart first.

871
00:55:30.991 --> 00:55:35.610
Why don't you draft a fucking heart first and then talk to me about,

872
00:55:35.611 --> 00:55:39.240
you know,
fucking kid a coming off the goddamn bench.
Cause I don't give a fuck.

873
00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:43.410
Ooh.
Got a little hostile there.
All right,
question number one.

874
00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:48.720
What a comedian does,
a comedy central presents.
Is there an applause?
Oh meter.

875
00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:53.820
Because sometimes it seems like an odd place for an applause break.

876
00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:58.560
Also.
Is there an opening act to warm up the crowd?
Uh,
let's see.

877
00:55:58.561 --> 00:56:02.040
Is there a plausible meter?
No,
they just actually,

878
00:56:02.041 --> 00:56:04.470
I think they just edit it in bill,

879
00:56:04.471 --> 00:56:09.471
take applause from a different joke that really killed and uh,

880
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:10.110
I dunno,

881
00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:14.130
maybe because there's a low and for some reason they think the viewer at home

882
00:56:14.131 --> 00:56:17.700
isn't going to notice or like when they cut to somebody who's laughing

883
00:56:17.701 --> 00:56:21.960
hysterically at another joke,
that was hysterical.

884
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:25.060
That maybe even that comedian didn't even tell.
They'll actually,

885
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:29.110
if they get a good laugh or in the crowd,
they use that as stock footage.

886
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:34.300
You know,
kind of like,
you know,
a battle footage.
You don't like the,
you know,

887
00:56:34.301 --> 00:56:37.330
when they show the atom bomb it's do they have like two or three views of that

888
00:56:37.331 --> 00:56:40.480
stock footage of the fucking Adam bomb that's the same.
It's the same thing.

889
00:56:40.481 --> 00:56:42.340
It's in standup comedy.
Okay.

890
00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:46.300
Some lady lost her shit laughing in 1983 you haven't ever noticed that.

891
00:56:46.301 --> 00:56:49.180
Sometimes like they'll cut to somebody really bad,

892
00:56:49.181 --> 00:56:52.810
like on bet they'll cut to somebody with a hairstyle that is just like from

893
00:56:52.811 --> 00:56:55.270
fucking 20 years ago.
You know what I mean?

894
00:56:55.271 --> 00:56:59.470
Like remember black people used to have the
three levels,

895
00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:02.560
like high top fade,
like three different levels.

896
00:57:02.561 --> 00:57:05.160
So it was like a parking garage or like a,

897
00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:09.610
some sort of fancy stairs that would lead into like a serving Rome or some shit.

898
00:57:09.930 --> 00:57:13.870
Remember the,
you know,
during the Bobbi Brown my prerogative.

899
00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:18.640
That's what they'll do.
They'll show a guy,
black dude or a white dude,

900
00:57:18.641 --> 00:57:21.460
whatever on ComicView and it'll tell a fucking joke.

901
00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:26.530
You know the address.
You know,
they got an a Obama and o a t shirt,
right?

902
00:57:26.531 --> 00:57:27.161
The comedian.

903
00:57:27.161 --> 00:57:31.310
And then they'll cut to somebody who looks like one of the guys and fucking a

904
00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:36.360
boys to men swearing like one of those lime green fucking seven up sport coats.

905
00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:41.620
Um,
okay.
Yeah,
I think,
I think I overly explain that.
All right.
Also,

906
00:57:41.621 --> 00:57:46.360
is there an opening act to warm up the crowd?
Uh,
if you're lucky?
Yes,
there is a,

907
00:57:46.361 --> 00:57:49.480
if there isn't,
it sucks because it's like nobody's laughing.

908
00:57:49.481 --> 00:57:52.900
They're just sitting there and all of a sudden you come out and you're just
like,

909
00:57:52.901 --> 00:57:56.680
what's up with lamps?
But these,
these crazy and it's really shocking.

910
00:57:57.310 --> 00:58:01.600
So hopefully there,
there was a warm up act.
Um,
all my experiences there has been,

911
00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:03.550
okay.
Question number two.

912
00:58:03.551 --> 00:58:08.290
The question is why does asparagus thank your Pitstick um,

913
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:12.040
I just liked that you said Piss,
you know,

914
00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:14.560
like they should have been the f word in that sentence.
Just,

915
00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:17.590
just to prepare me for pis.
I should have been,

916
00:58:17.591 --> 00:58:22.450
why does your bite as asparagus make your urine smell or a,

917
00:58:22.451 --> 00:58:25.690
what is fucking asparagus make you pissed stick.
You know what I mean?

918
00:58:25.691 --> 00:58:28.300
You've got gotta be consistent here.
The first half,

919
00:58:28.301 --> 00:58:32.080
you're like Dan rather reading off the teleprompter and then the second half

920
00:58:32.081 --> 00:58:35.530
you're going dice clay on me.
All right.
Asparagus contains,
uh,
this is,

921
00:58:35.531 --> 00:58:38.560
this is the answer.
I actually looked it up.
This is the first thing I saw.

922
00:58:38.561 --> 00:58:40.180
So I'm going with this.
Like it's the truth.

923
00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:44.770
Asparagus contains a sulfur compound called Merck captain.

924
00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:49.020
It's also found in rotten eggs,
onions,
garlic,
and in this,

925
00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:53.920
in the secretion of skunk,
when your digestive track breaks down,

926
00:58:53.921 --> 00:58:57.270
this substance byproducts are released.
That cause the funny sense.

927
00:58:57.550 --> 00:59:00.430
The funny sense.
I don't think it's funny if you to think it's funny.

928
00:59:00.431 --> 00:59:01.630
It's actually kind of disgusting.

929
00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:05.860
The process is so quick that your urine can develop the distinctive smell within

930
00:59:05.861 --> 00:59:08.290
15 to 30 minutes of eating asparagus.

931
00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:13.570
See sources for more info.
I left that last part in there just in case.

932
00:59:13.571 --> 00:59:16.920
I actually tried to play that off.
Like I wasn't reading it.
Um,

933
00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:19.210
so that's why it does it,
you know,

934
00:59:19.211 --> 00:59:24.020
cause there's some sort of sulfur compound called mercaptans that's also fine

935
00:59:24.021 --> 00:59:27.080
and rotten eggs,
onions,
garlics and in the secretion of skunks,

936
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.510
you know what I mean?
That's just one of those bucket things.

937
00:59:29.511 --> 00:59:31.250
At the second you hear it,
just forget it.
Okay.

938
00:59:31.251 --> 00:59:34.280
Cause there's no way to say that at a party and it's going to get you any

939
00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:36.800
further with the person you're talking to.
You know,

940
00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:40.790
either talking them into bed or trying to get a promotion that's just like,

941
00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:41.900
it just makes you weird.

942
00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:46.370
And people just sort of rates raise their eyebrows and nod and fucking walk
away.

943
00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:48.440
And you're left with a awkward silence.

944
00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:51.200
And that's when you take out your cell phone and you pretend you got to call.

945
00:59:51.830 --> 00:59:55.010
You don't have a call.
All right,
question number three.

946
00:59:55.830 --> 00:59:57.020
Now this is a great question.

947
00:59:57.021 --> 01:00:02.021
So who is more bad ass tie domi above prober for those of you who don't watch

948
01:00:02.241 --> 01:00:03.074
hockey,

949
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:07.940
these are two of the all time great enforcers in Nhl history.

950
01:00:07.941 --> 01:00:12.020
Who's more bad ass?
This is tied Domi or Bob Probert.

951
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:16.160
It's not even a question.
It's fucking Bob Prober.
Not In,
not even,

952
01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:21.230
I'm not even talking about at the height of his career where he beat the shit

953
01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:25.220
out of every tough guy and I beat the shit out of every tough guy in the league.

954
01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:28.100
He didn't start losing fights towards the end.
Okay,

955
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:31.640
so everybody knows what he did on the ice.
This is what he did off the ice.

956
01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:33.800
Here's a little blurb by finding him on the Internet.

957
01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:38.360
Died a former NHL enforcement,
Bob Proberg,
Bob Prober,

958
01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:41.090
so I don't do the news that can't even read his back in jail.

959
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:45.740
He was arrested Friday night in Delray beach after a scuffle with Florida police

960
01:00:45.741 --> 01:00:48.780
that led to probate being shocked with the Taser Gun.
This is,

961
01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:51.110
this is what he's doing after his career,

962
01:00:51.111 --> 01:00:52.700
when he's supposed to be out on the golf course,

963
01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:56.060
hanging out with Charles Barkley doing cell phone commercial charged with

964
01:00:56.061 --> 01:01:00.980
battery on a law enforcement officer resisting arrest with violence and

965
01:01:00.981 --> 01:01:02.120
disorderly conduct.

966
01:01:02.121 --> 01:01:06.710
Trovert was held without bail at the Palm Beach County jail while playing for

967
01:01:06.711 --> 01:01:10.400
the Detroit Red Wings in the eighties and nineties probate served a prison term

968
01:01:10.401 --> 01:01:13.910
when he was caught trying to carry cocaine into the United States from Canada.

969
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:18.370
He also had alcohol problems and was charged with numerous driving offenses for

970
01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:19.270
over probate,

971
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:24.280
was placed on inactive status for the 80 94 to 95 season after he was involved

972
01:01:25.281 --> 01:01:28.700
in a motorcycle accident and test showed alcohol and cocaine in his system.

973
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:33.590
This is what he does off the ice is what he was doing off ice during his career.

974
01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.780
And he probably had three fights that night.

975
01:01:35.781 --> 01:01:38.750
Beat the shit out of a whole nother team and that still wasn't enough.
He's like,

976
01:01:38.751 --> 01:01:42.860
Eh,
I think I'll drink a 12 pack of fucking Schaffer,
you know,

977
01:01:42.861 --> 01:01:44.960
get an eight ball and jump on a fucking Ninja.

978
01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:50.150
Dell rape police officers first spotted prober at this.
This is,
uh,

979
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:54.680
this is for my July,
June 4th,
2004.
He's well into his forties at this point.

980
01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:56.163
All right.

981
01:01:56.750 --> 01:02:01.490
They spotted him on Friday as he was parked in his white BMW sport utility

982
01:02:01.491 --> 01:02:02.180
vehicle,

983
01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:07.180
the wrong way on a side street and began hanging out his window to yell at

984
01:02:08.181 --> 01:02:09.014
several men

985
01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:16.670
before one a and he was out of his mind,
eh?
Yeah.
Fucking pussy.

986
01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:20.990
You know
I boss fucking Bro.

987
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.020
But you probably still wearing the hockey gloves.
I bet like he has to do that.

988
01:02:25.021 --> 01:02:28.190
He has,
he has to drop gloves before he could fight or it's just like,

989
01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:32.310
it's like no mark,
no Mark Garcia power before he hits.
He's got a fucking,

990
01:02:32.311 --> 01:02:36.000
you know,
click his feet and his shoes and justice gloves,
you know,

991
01:02:36.001 --> 01:02:36.960
his batting gloves or Betty.

992
01:02:36.961 --> 01:02:39.840
He literally has to walk around in hockey gloves or he won't,

993
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:42.450
he won't get the first couple of shots off.
So anyways,

994
01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:47.690
for officer's intervened when prober a native of Windsor Ontario got out of the

995
01:02:48.571 --> 01:02:52.710
car and tried to start a fight with one of the men according to the report,

996
01:02:52.711 --> 01:02:56.910
he then fought with the officers and refuse their artists to drop to the ground.

997
01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:00.520
As two of the officer's struggled to handcuff Filbert,

998
01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:06.060
I'm opposite Thomas Tolbert.
Shot him with a Taser gun and he fell backwards.

999
01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:10.290
But probate continued to resist their efforts when they tried to handcuff him.

1000
01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:15.090
This is after getting tasered so Tobar used a taser gun to stun prober it

1001
01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:16.410
several more times.

1002
01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:19.390
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1003
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:22.940
<v 4>She's fucking unreal.
The gun shoots Bob PR probes.
Yeah,</v>

1004
01:03:22.941 --> 01:03:25.880
that's that Barb wires shit.
I don't know if you guys know like,

1005
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:29.180
it's not like science fiction where they just shoot electricity at you.

1006
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:34.070
It shoots out these two medieval fucking,
uh,
inquisition

1007
01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:39.860
hooks in it hooks under your skin.
India chest like fucking eagle talents.

1008
01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:44.390
Like that's not enough to make you just scream like a bitch and dropped to the

1009
01:03:44.391 --> 01:03:48.920
ground.
They then shoot electricity into that.
Okay.
It's bad enough.

1010
01:03:48.921 --> 01:03:51.470
The guys already fighting two cops,
you know,
cops.
Okay.

1011
01:03:51.471 --> 01:03:56.120
There's little cops have like,
they have like mini UFC skills.

1012
01:03:56.121 --> 01:04:01.121
They all know armbars and choke holds and they have guns and clubs and shit and

1013
01:04:01.461 --> 01:04:02.540
he's fighting two of them.

1014
01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.680
They still have to taser him two or three more times.

1015
01:04:06.681 --> 01:04:09.330
So I would go to Bob Prober.
I would say Bob Roberts,

1016
01:04:09.350 --> 01:04:10.820
a little trough and the tied to Omi.
Okay.

1017
01:04:10.821 --> 01:04:15.790
Until Kai Domi fights for fucking cops and his mid forties and as to get Tabors

1018
01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:17.690
tasered numerous fucking times.

1019
01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:22.070
I'm going to go with Bob Prober and I don't have any sort of fucking hockey
geek.

1020
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:26.630
Come on here and talk to me about fucking career stats.
Bring out tie dummies.

1021
01:04:26.631 --> 01:04:31.100
Arrest Record.
All right.
Has he been arrested?
I didn't even look it up.

1022
01:04:31.101 --> 01:04:34.020
That's how fucked up probates arrest record was.
I don't even have,

1023
01:04:34.021 --> 01:04:37.860
I didn't have the decency to look up the only,
so there you go.
All right.

1024
01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:40.700
I've got to wrap this thing up here.
This is getting too long.
Um,

1025
01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:43.430
just a couple more questions.
I'll answer them real quick.

1026
01:04:43.790 --> 01:04:47.480
Have you ever done any work on a cruise ship?
Uh,
yes I did.

1027
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:51.110
And they won't be asking me back to captain wrote a letter,

1028
01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:52.880
said I was offensive to all races.

1029
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:58.250
Said I made fun of Handicap People Cause I did a joke about midgets.
Um,
you know,

1030
01:04:58.251 --> 01:05:00.120
I don't,
I don't know what to tell you.
You know,
uh,

1031
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:02.600
I was told that if I didn't I already answer this question.

1032
01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:03.630
Did I answer this question right?

1033
01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:08.170
They told me he's going to be young people and then I got on the cruise ship and

1034
01:05:08.171 --> 01:05:13.030
the first person I saw was that old Vietnamese lady lady with no teeth asleep

1035
01:05:13.031 --> 01:05:16.660
with their mouth open wearing that.
I'm picking rice hat.
Then I tell you,

1036
01:05:16.661 --> 01:05:21.470
I told you that rice,
I don't fucking remember.
All right,
let's,

1037
01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.780
let's get on with it.
Okay.

1045
01:05:50.141 --> 01:05:54.730
other fucking people

1046
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.400
But that's a July 10th through the 13th.

1047
01:05:57.790 --> 01:06:01.660
And then July 31st through August 3rd,

All right,
so keep the questions coming.

1055
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:27.490
Let me know how you guys think the story.
Sometimes I think the stories are good.

1056
01:06:27.491 --> 01:06:31.390
Sometimes I think kind of slows me down from a joking around.

1057
01:06:31.391 --> 01:06:34.000
I don't know if they're boring or if they're interesting,
please let me know.

1058
01:06:34.001 --> 01:06:35.170
Please give me a feedback.

1059
01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.440
I'll probably regret saying that because now I'm going to get a bunch of yeah,

1060
01:06:38.441 --> 01:06:43.210
and you stutter too much during them and blah,
blah blah.
So what,

1061
01:06:43.790 --> 01:06:47.950
why would I open myself up to more criticisms in life?
Anyways,
thanks everybody.

1062
01:06:47.951 --> 01:06:49.570
I really appreciate all you guys listening.

1063
01:06:49.571 --> 01:06:52.450
I know I say I only have 14 listeners.
I know it's a lot more than that.

1064
01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:56.010
It's gotta be at least 32 at this point and I really appreciate that.

1065
01:06:56.011 --> 01:06:57.400
You guys keep telling me that you like them.

1066
01:06:57.550 --> 01:06:58.870
As long as you're telling me you keep liking him,

1067
01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.930
I'm going to keep doing them and feeling like a man.

1068
01:07:01.931 --> 01:07:03.310
You don't have to fuck and listen,

1069
01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:07.360
I don't know why I have this hippie thing today.
Uh,
all right.
That's it.

1070
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:08.980
That's the Monday morning podcast.

1071
01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:12.520
God bless all of you and it's off to Chicago and let's win there.

1072
01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:17.650
I'll talk to you guys.
Uh,
what the fuck is it next Monday.

1073
01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.350
All right,
happy July 4th weekend.

1074
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:23.770
God bless America and uh,
you know,

1075
01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:27.520
stop taking shit from American Airlines and other airlines and stop taking shit

1076
01:07:27.521 --> 01:07:30.400
from these corporations.
Go to the West websites and complain.

1077
01:07:30.401 --> 01:07:32.860
Use a lot of words like outrageous,
ridiculous,

1078
01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:37.540
trying to go to a privately own shit.
That's what I like doing.

1079
01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:40.630
I tried to do that.
Then you go in there and they shit all over the food,

1080
01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:44.110
all over the spoon.
I mean,
this is food all over the spoon.

1081
01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:49.390
God just fucking,
this is why you know,
most people when they read the dyslexic,

1082
01:07:49.391 --> 01:07:52.570
I like to speak in dyslexia.
This is why I became a comedian.

1083
01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.930
If you have a fucking wondered why.
This is why I did it,

1084
01:07:56.140 --> 01:08:00.730
because I'm too much of a moron to exist in the real world.
And secondly,

1085
01:08:00.731 --> 01:08:04.360
when I'm in the real world,
um,
I like,

1086
01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:08.020
I just keep hearing this voice over and over.
I'm just going,

1087
01:08:08.021 --> 01:08:11.740
this is fucking stupid.
This is fucking stupid.
Fucking stupid.

1088
01:08:11.741 --> 01:08:13.420
That's all I would hear.
You know,

1089
01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:16.970
I tried to sit in the meetings as they talked about how to make the product

1090
01:08:16.971 --> 01:08:20.210
better and to try and increase the revenues.

1091
01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:25.250
And everyone was sitting there and they had out little little notebook cause it

1092
01:08:25.251 --> 01:08:29.380
was the eighties early nineties,
and he'll fucking writing shit down.
I just,

1093
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:32.510
that's why I couldn't hear what the person was saying because my brain just kept

1094
01:08:32.511 --> 01:08:35.360
going.
This is fucking stupid.
This is fucking stupid.
I don't want to do this.

1095
01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:40.610
I don't wanna fucking do this.
Alright,
I don't fucking do this.

1096
01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:43.130
All right,
there you go.
That's my job history.

1097
01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:48.170
Before I became a comedian who was me doing one job after another and hearing a

1098
01:08:48.171 --> 01:08:51.120
loud voice in my head going,
I don't want to fucking do this.
So I don't,

1099
01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:54.520
<v 0>and now I do this and this is too long.
All right,
I'll talk to you next week.</v>

1100
01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:55.413
Have a great week.
Bye.

1101
01:09:10.190 --> 01:09:11.090
Oh,

1102
01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.153
hey.

1103
01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.640
