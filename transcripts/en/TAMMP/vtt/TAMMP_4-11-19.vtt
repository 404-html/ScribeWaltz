00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.070
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:09.700
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast it.
Ah,

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.100
just checking in on you.

4
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.960
I'm checking in on you this cause I care.

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.330
Okay.

6
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.150
In this time when everybody else is just thinking about themselves and their

7
00:00:22.151 --> 00:00:22.984
issues,

8
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.280
I'm the person that cares about everybody else and now I'm going to tell you

9
00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:29.980
about it because that's what the world is about.
Now,

10
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.030
the world is not about trying to go out and go.

11
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.610
You don't do a good thing unless everybody knows you did a good thing.

12
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.920
Here's me helping an old lady across the street.
Hang on,
granny.

13
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.480
Look into the look under my phone while I take a selfie of what a good fucking

14
00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:50.970
person I am.
MMM.
And then I,

15
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:54.150
then I hashtag it humble.
Um,

16
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.070
just had the most amazing experience helping an old person across the street,

17
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:01.590
which I documented on my smartphone.

18
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.980
Hashtag humbled hashtag learn from your elders.

19
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.750
Oh,
I am in an extra county mood today.
I'm not going to lie to you.

20
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.910
It has nothing to do with the hipsters.

21
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:19.900
It's got nothing to do with the Manchurian candidate.
Hey,
by the way.
Okay.

22
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.070
You know,
I want to apologize to everybody in England,
the UK,

23
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.560
the,
what else do you call it?
The fucking,
uh,
there's something empire.

24
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.160
Great Britain.
Right.

25
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

26
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.150
<v 0>Specifically or pacifically depending on your education.</v>

27
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.550
I would like to apologize to the football fence of the premier league.

28
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.350
I've been making fun of it saying it's fucking stupid.
They,
you know,

29
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:50.840
and,
and,
and yeah,
Man City,

30
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:53.510
they had played a bunch of shit bump teams and they're just going to keep

31
00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:56.570
wedding and this is going to be like no excitement whatsoever.

32
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.870
And just when you thought this pasty freckled Yank was right,

33
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.070
what happened?
Man?

34
00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:09.071
City loses okay to the powerhouse that is Tottenham.

35
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.750
Oh,
no way.
Tottenham,

36
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.990
I could've told you fucking three years ago they were going to lose it.

37
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.873
That game,

38
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.250
nothing sends shivers down the fucking spine of football.

39
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:25.251
Feds as they shove fucking newspaper wrapped fish into their faces.

40
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

41
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.150
<v 0>Like the phrase we have taught in him next,
it's amazing.</v>

42
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

43
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.420
<v 0>They fucking lost.
So I don't know what's going on.
So now,
you know,</v>

44
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.770
I think Liverpool could actually tie

45
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.190
that.
That would be amazing.

46
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.430
Right after all of this running around and grabbing your legs and screaming in

47
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:56.370
agony,
the end of the year,
you got two champions

48
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.490
putting a whole fucking meaning to,
we are the champions.

49
00:03:01.491 --> 00:03:05.960
We are the champions of the Premiere League,
Booboo,

50
00:03:05.961 --> 00:03:09.310
booboo.
Uh,

51
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.120
no one is fucking better except for that other team do,
do,
do,
do.

52
00:03:14.121 --> 00:03:19.121
We are the champions and so is the other city.

53
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.250
I for the life of me don't understand how you have a fucking league that the

54
00:03:25.251 --> 00:03:27.530
entire world is watching and you don't,
you're not,

55
00:03:27.531 --> 00:03:29.240
you're not going to have these two teams play each other.

56
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.020
We are the champions of the world.

57
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.070
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.360
<v 0>But so was man city.</v>

59
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.080
We tied as champions.

60
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.090
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.990
<v 0>So then what's going to happen,</v>

62
00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:47.820
you guys are both going to walk around in your cities,

63
00:03:47.821 --> 00:03:50.340
which are championship hats for 2019.

64
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

65
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.090
<v 0>And then you'll run into each other on the fucking tube or the train or wherever</v>

66
00:03:56.091 --> 00:03:57.350
the fuck you are.
And then it's,

67
00:03:57.351 --> 00:04:00.890
it's like literally like one of those stupid fucking feel good stories on

68
00:04:00.891 --> 00:04:01.724
Facebook.

69
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.020
So and so had a twin that he was unaware of.

70
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.950
He's now 63 and he went to a mall on Long Island and ran into this fucking jerk

71
00:04:14.611 --> 00:04:17.490
off.
That was his brother that he didn't know.
Right.

72
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.940
I always think that's hilarious when siblings meet each other in their sixties

73
00:04:20.941 --> 00:04:24.450
that they didn't know existed.
And now what are you gonna talk about?
You know,

74
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.830
I had my gallbladder removed too.
You really are my brother.

75
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.070
You want to go play fucking catch.

76
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

77
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.910
<v 0>Um,
I don't have shoulders that work anymore.</v>

78
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.830
You also dodged the draft.
Oh my God.

79
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.930
How could you not be related?
So that's what's going on right now.
And I,

80
00:04:44.931 --> 00:04:47.060
I tried looking up to figure out,
you know,

81
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.520
the standings and all of that shit in the premier league.

82
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.240
Every wine will be chair this year.
Alright.

83
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.360
Standings

84
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.150
the same way.
It can end in a zero zero tie.

85
00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:06.000
You can have two champions do two to two.
All right.

86
00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:08.160
So right now Liverpool has two more points,

87
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.860
but I've learned that that doesn't mean shit.
Wish.
You know,

88
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:15.780
like how many games are left
and I gotta be honest.
I don't give a fuck.

89
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.520
I don't,
okay.
I'm still rooting for Liverpool.
I'm still paying attention.

90
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.190
But if the end of all of this fucking shit,

91
00:05:23.191 --> 00:05:28.191
these fucking two assholes aren't going to play each other and Man City could,

92
00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:29.204
could,

93
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:30.603
<v 1>I dunno,</v>

94
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.260
<v 0>could not win it because they lost that Todd or ham.</v>

95
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.730
Right?
Can I get bit Pip Tata Ham on his sandwich please?
Um,
I dunno.

96
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.160
Whatever.
You know what I'm doing?
I'm doing,

97
00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:46.100
what I fucking hate people do when they come to this country is they just come

98
00:05:46.101 --> 00:05:47.660
here and they tell me how fucked up it is.

99
00:05:47.661 --> 00:05:50.960
Like I as an American don't realize it.
It's like,
dude,
I fucking live here.

100
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.900
Can you stop country splaining to me while you man spread across to me.
You

101
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.160
for male Caucasian.

102
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.830
Whenever the fuck these fucking broads a bitching about this week.

103
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.263
<v 2>MMM.</v>

104
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.300
<v 0>Anyways,
there's a big strike that's supposed to be happening out here.</v>

105
00:06:10.301 --> 00:06:11.950
I'm hoping they're going to win the writer's guild.

106
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.990
You know what these fucking piece of shit agents did.

107
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.250
They actually fucking started packaging deals with them making more money than

108
00:06:18.251 --> 00:06:21.640
the fucking person they were allegedly working for.
It's just classic them.

109
00:06:21.641 --> 00:06:26.190
And you know what they do?
They go to bed,
they fucking sleep fine.
You know?

110
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.440
You know what's funny is none of my agents have brought this up.
Like,
yeah,

111
00:06:29.441 --> 00:06:31.840
I mean I wasn't a part of it and it's despicable.

112
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.033
<v 2>MMM.</v>

113
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.340
<v 0>Hey Nia,
we were just saying,
I haven't been on the podcast and forever.
I know.</v>

114
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.503
<v 2>Oh Wow.</v>

115
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.130
<v 0>You,
you,
you could not sound less.
Uh,
I dunno.</v>

116
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.140
Missing of the podcast.

117
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.690
What's going on with your gorgeous,
you look in great.
Thank you.
Huh?

118
00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:59.683
<v 2>Thank you.</v>

119
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.380
<v 0>I know Nia woke up,
I woke up this morning and the first thing he says,</v>

120
00:07:07.381 --> 00:07:08.700
it was just like,
oh my God,

121
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.890
I was asleep until midnight and then I couldn't go to sleep until 4:00 AM.

122
00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:18.330
And you know,
and you want as a husband to be like,
well that sucks for you,

123
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.760
but you know what that means.
You got to go get the little regret I did.

124
00:07:23.761 --> 00:07:27.240
I made a wafs.
I came in there this morning.
She goes,
I go,
I go,
hey buddy.

125
00:07:27.241 --> 00:07:30.780
She goes,
I want waffles.
Now the first thing right out of the gate,

126
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.340
she came in with a breakfast daughter.
I want waffles.
All right,

127
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.150
but I'm a strict dead so you know what I did?

128
00:07:36.151 --> 00:07:40.290
I went right downstairs and I made her waffles.
That's right.
Yeah.

129
00:07:40.291 --> 00:07:43.320
You're eating a healthy breakfast.
What'd you say,
sweetheart?
You want waffles?

130
00:07:43.321 --> 00:07:47.370
Okay.
Absolutely.
Anything for you.
But then I didn't make waffles for Junia.

131
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.010
I did not because you've been crushing it on your diet and there's all kinds of

132
00:07:53.011 --> 00:07:55.200
sugar and shit and that you don't need it.

133
00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:00.240
And I didn't want to be the guy that handed your the crack pipe.
Nia,

134
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.930
this off Mike thing that you're doing on the podcast is about as exciting as

135
00:08:03.931 --> 00:08:07.710
watching Liverpool and man city not play each other for the championship.

136
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.650
Everyone is champion in soccer.

137
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:19.710
If you fall down,
we'll fucking stop the game for 20 minutes,
Booboo,

138
00:08:19.711 --> 00:08:23.820
booboo.
Um,
the more you watch soccer though,
you're more,

139
00:08:23.821 --> 00:08:27.000
you can see how much it hurts.
You know,
when they get the spikes going.

140
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.660
Like a most solid was on that breakaway and that guy just basically peeled the

141
00:08:30.661 --> 00:08:32.190
skin off the back of his calf.

142
00:08:32.191 --> 00:08:34.830
But I love that he was on a breakaway and he kept going.

143
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.080
Most Sala actually looks like he's like,

144
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:41.370
looks like the Judd Apatow of premiere league soccer.

145
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:46.200
Nothing.
You just gonna walk out.
No,
I was just wanting to be like,

146
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.560
what they look,
they look like each other.

147
00:08:49.561 --> 00:08:53.520
He's the best player in the s in into soccer league.
Yes.

148
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.770
Um,
Nia always looking out for me.

149
00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.290
Always looking out for me.

150
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.910
Did you just say something about Tara Reid?

151
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.570
Um,
anyways,
uh,

152
00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.760
Stanley Cup playoffs started now for all you English people over there.

153
00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:13.810
You fight,
right?
What's that?

154
00:09:13.811 --> 00:09:18.010
Is that like everybody sort of just mills around playing each other and then the

155
00:09:18.011 --> 00:09:22.740
end,
the,
you know,
like whoever has the most points wins right now.
Everybody.

156
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:25.170
England,
it's just like,
that's a fucking terrible that

157
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.630
I'm going to compound it with a bad accent,
right way.
He'll fall.

158
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:35.080
Could talk like that mate.
Um,
yeah.

159
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:35.980
Started last night.

160
00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:40.090
The islanders big win in overtime over your Pittsburgh Penguins.

161
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:41.790
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

162
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.330
<v 0>Oh,
t loss.
Ot loss.
Uh,
San Jose Sharks.</v>

163
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.900
I fell asleep.
I think they were handling in the nights it pretty well.

164
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:51.180
It's four to one.
Um,

165
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.910
and I didn't see what happened with Nashville.
No,
wait.
Yeah,
that was the,
yeah.

166
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.190
Okay.
Sorry.
I watched,
I got a kid now.
I don't know what the fuck's going on.
Um,

167
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.600
but I'll tell you what,
as much as I have a child,

168
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.240
as much as I'm a dedicated father,

169
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.980
I still had time to go out to my little fucking garage with my wonderful,

170
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:15.540
beautiful Gretsch broadcast to set.
And I was there,
I was working on that,
uh,

171
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.330
that Soundgarden song,
uh,

172
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.730
never the machine again.

173
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.583
<v 1>MMM.</v>

174
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.670
<v 0>Which is a nine.
If I saw a site,</v>

175
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.700
I figured out that it was in nine and then I figured out the main groove and

176
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:35.130
then that second groove where he goes on the toms,

177
00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:38.250
I can never fucking here where he's at.
So I had to watch some kid on Youtube,

178
00:10:38.251 --> 00:10:42.840
play it.
Um,
but I was,
I'm able to the whole song though.

179
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.030
What I love about the whole songs,
it's,

180
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.330
it's in nine and then it feels like it's switches but it never does.

181
00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:49.830
He's just fucking with the time,

182
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.920
it was almost like he was either playing double time at first and then regular

183
00:10:55.981 --> 00:10:58.560
time or he was playing regular time and then half time,

184
00:10:58.561 --> 00:11:03.540
which I think is what he's doing and just the way he comes up with the drum

185
00:11:03.541 --> 00:11:06.960
parts.
Matt Cameron,
the overrated underrated for this week.

186
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.770
Matt Cameron Drummer for Soundgarden Pearl Jam and a,

187
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.240
whoever's next band is going to be whoever they are going to be.
Um

188
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

189
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:16.840
<v 0>I Dunno,</v>

190
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.290
I always thought he was like wasted and Pearl Jam that he could play all these

191
00:11:20.291 --> 00:11:21.370
different time signatures.

192
00:11:21.371 --> 00:11:25.840
As far as I know pro jam just plays in for you know,

193
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.040
so it's like you got like some fucking amazing like I dunno wide receiver and

194
00:11:30.041 --> 00:11:33.670
you just have them on special teams.
Is that what it is?
Bill?

195
00:11:33.671 --> 00:11:34.980
You Non Musician Khan?

196
00:11:34.981 --> 00:11:37.660
Who the fuck are you to tell one of the biggest bands ever that they're wasting?

197
00:11:37.661 --> 00:11:41.920
One of the great drummers of all time,
and I got a lot of fucking balls first.

198
00:11:41.921 --> 00:11:45.340
First he attacked the Premiere League and now you're giving shit to fucking

199
00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:50.230
whoever puts together Pearl Jam,
um,
with they fishermen.

200
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.300
Is that,
are they came up with Pearl jam?

201
00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.740
You know what a pearls come out and visit oysters.

202
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:00.630
I can never remember.

203
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:02.160
<v 1>Okay.</v>

204
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.890
<v 0>It is pretty amazing that we somehow found those fucking things.</v>

205
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.180
Crustaceans buried in the fucking sand in the goddamn ocean.

206
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:14.420
And our stupid nosy ass is,
we're like the broad set of species.
You know,

207
00:12:14.421 --> 00:12:17.090
you fucking wife just sticks.
They're fucking nose and everything.

208
00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:22.010
Everything is curious to them.
They say they're curious.
It's like,
no,
you're nosy.

209
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.830
You snooping around fucking nuts.
All right.
Uh,

210
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:30.800
where do pearls come from?

211
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.450
[inaudible]
that's where it is,
right?

212
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.360
Why is my internet this fucking slow?

213
00:12:38.361 --> 00:12:42.320
Have they just decided that I have to buy a new fucking,

214
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:47.300
although clams and Mussels can also produce pearls,
they do.

215
00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:52.310
So they don't do so very often.
Everything has to be inclusive.

216
00:12:52.311 --> 00:12:53.330
We're not saying,

217
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.310
we're not saying in clams and muscles aren't as good as the oysters.

218
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.210
Um,

219
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:01.830
<v 1>okay.</v>

220
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:06.300
<v 0>As the oysters grow and internal organ called the mantle use is minerals from</v>

221
00:13:06.301 --> 00:13:09.740
the oysters food,
right?
Produce a substance called na who gives a shit.

222
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.170
Somebody sat and figured that out.

223
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.040
Somebody opened that up and found it and was like,
you know what?

224
00:13:16.041 --> 00:13:18.500
I'm going to give this to the fucking woman in the tribe.

225
00:13:18.501 --> 00:13:23.110
I want to bang and it was shiny and the other women didn't have it and she liked

226
00:13:23.111 --> 00:13:28.111
him and the dude got his fucking prehistoric dick sucked and the trajectory of

227
00:13:28.821 --> 00:13:29.390
that,

228
00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:34.390
those butterfly wings flapping turned into I'll bull shit you see on TV with

229
00:13:35.661 --> 00:13:40.160
Tiffany's.
You know
as a man,

230
00:13:40.161 --> 00:13:43.040
if you ever produce one of those,
when are you going to get out of the ring?

231
00:13:43.041 --> 00:13:45.950
Commercials like you really dish something should happen to you.

232
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.980
You should lose something.
I'm not saying physically,
but you should depth.

233
00:13:49.981 --> 00:13:52.730
Somebody should take your flat screen away for like six months.

234
00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:57.260
No sports packages.
Right?
But then again,
what kind of man who is into sports?

235
00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.920
Well,
a lot of them because they're all about the fucking money.

236
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.920
These fucking Goddamn agents out here.

237
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:06.700
What a bunch of cons I do.
You know,
it's not that you steal,

238
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:10.580
it's that you'd go to bed at night with a smile on your face.
They get,

239
00:14:10.581 --> 00:14:12.770
that's what kills me about the fucking agencies out here.

240
00:14:12.771 --> 00:14:15.140
They don't even have any guilt of what the fuck they do.

241
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.150
Just like every other fucking corporations.
It's,
it's just fucking unbelievable.

242
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.170
Unfucking believable and they know they got everybody by the fucking balls.

243
00:14:25.171 --> 00:14:27.960
February is going to fire their fucking age.
They know.
They know they did it.

244
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:32.310
You did it.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Go get your fucking infinity pool.

245
00:14:32.311 --> 00:14:34.160
You're fucking greedy.
Cons,

246
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:35.700
<v 1>okay,</v>

247
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.020
<v 0>that out.</v>

248
00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.130
I'll tell you that's not just as business out to anytime you come up with an

249
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:42.790
idea,
all right,
and you get in business with somebody else.

250
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.300
You think that they are working with you.
I swear to God,
I swear to God,

251
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.970
but at the end of the day,
you're going to end up fucking working for them.

252
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.240
Every time you think you're not the whore walking the block and you think you

253
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:55.970
finally got in the car and now you're the pimp,
you're not.

254
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.510
You're fucking walk in the block for somebody.
It's fucking ridiculous.

255
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.820
May they all die of fucking a fucking heart attack today when they go out and

256
00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:09.310
eat their fucking surf and turf lunches,
gree cons.
Um,

257
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.520
<v 1>yeah.</v>

258
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.150
<v 0>What am,
I can only get so fucking mad about it.
But what do you expect?</v>

259
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:19.090
What do you expect?
You know,
that's,
that's what they do.
It's what they do.

260
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.913
That's what they do.
Yeah.

261
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.840
<v 3>They're all about</v>

262
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.640
<v 0>the fucking money.
Um,</v>

263
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.880
maybe that's what artists can do to fight back because we're not organized

264
00:15:31.881 --> 00:15:34.970
enough.
Maybe we should just fucking,
you know,
and they still would kids,

265
00:15:34.971 --> 00:15:37.030
not that you could say to him,
Hey,
what's up?
Do you agree?
He couldn't.

266
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.970
They'd be like,
hey,
how are you
just riding my Maybeck.

267
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.070
Um,
anyway,
uh,

268
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.660
moving on.
So the Bruins play the Toronto Maple leafs,

269
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.330
uh,
once again,
this,

270
00:15:56.331 --> 00:16:00.200
and you've got to think at some point Toronto has to push through.

271
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:05.120
Will this be the year?
Um,
I am rooting for those guys,

272
00:16:05.121 --> 00:16:08.720
but not this series.
Um,
and if they beat my Bruins than I will,

273
00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.470
I will root for them because it's getting ridiculous.

274
00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:13.880
You know what is amazing though,

275
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:19.580
and it really just goes to show you how nice people are in Canada on the

276
00:16:19.581 --> 00:16:20.121
surface,

277
00:16:20.121 --> 00:16:24.350
even though it's probably arguably more racist up there than it is down here.

278
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.640
And I know that that's a big statement,
but somebody has to offset Michael.

279
00:16:28.641 --> 00:16:32.090
What's his face there?
Is it Michael Moore?

280
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:37.330
And remember his fucking ridiculous cartoon version of what Canada was like.

281
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:42.590
Everybody leaves their doors unlocked in their [inaudible] is gingerbread houses

282
00:16:42.591 --> 00:16:45.080
up there.
Geez,
I,
I understand that.

283
00:16:45.081 --> 00:16:47.900
He's too fat to actually go and do some fucking research,

284
00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:52.500
which is why all this documentary.
So just op Ed pieces.
But that,

285
00:16:52.501 --> 00:16:55.430
that whole didn't that fucking moron.

286
00:16:55.431 --> 00:17:00.431
He should go fucking interview one guy of color who tried to make it in the Nhl

287
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.400
and just have him tell some fucking stories of playing minor league hockey up

288
00:17:04.401 --> 00:17:09.230
there and what people said fucking last week too.
I'm on the ice.
Um,

289
00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:13.520
anyway.
Oh Jesus.
Going after England now,
going after Canada,

290
00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.880
talking about fucking broads bitching and US bill.
What's less?

291
00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.650
Let's left El Salvador.

292
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.820
The look if you fucking people going to be down there.

293
00:17:23.821 --> 00:17:28.150
So we're in a close together.
God it you do it right.
Um,

294
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:30.183
all right.

295
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:30.980
<v 1>Okay,</v>

296
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.410
<v 0>here is another question I have.
No.
So here's the thing.</v>

297
00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:39.410
This just goes to show how nice they are.
Surface on the surface level of um,

298
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.450
and Canada is,

299
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:46.540
I remember when the Rangers have won it since 1940 everyone used in the 80s,

300
00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:51.450
everyone was chanting 19,
1940.

301
00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:56.451
So they were 40 something years in nobody chance 1967 maybe cause it's 67.

302
00:17:58.431 --> 00:17:59.264
It's just too long.

303
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.870
1940 doesn't have a good rhythm here.

304
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.670
1967.

305
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:12.770
That's like when when the red sox finally won and Yankee fans couldn't chair

306
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.080
1918 anymore.
So then now they just go boss,

307
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.870
they went and they used to be 1918 and now they go,

308
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.210
Boston sucks.

309
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.370
They turn a one syllable word to a two syllable word cause they're too fucking

310
00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:31.260
dumb.
You can't think of a fucking insult with two syllables.

311
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:39.210
I don't know.
Maybe I,
I,
I don't know.
I want understand,
but why isn't anybody,

312
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.430
it was always fucking shit.
And now our year,

313
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.630
nobody chanted 1906 and 1907 at the cubs,

314
00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:52.030
but everybody chanted 1918 I got,
I gotta tip my cap to Yankee fence.

315
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.930
We're actually ESPN the way they fucking overhyped all of that,

316
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.420
and of course them,
they didn't get to the real,
you know the real story about it,

317
00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.990
you know what I mean?
Where it was just like,
yeah,

318
00:19:04.991 --> 00:19:09.850
we were just say horribly inept franchise and the Yankees were not good owners.

319
00:19:09.851 --> 00:19:11.800
They didn't know what the fuck they were doing.
Right.

320
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:16.630
They didn't do that and that the Yankees were just this amazing organization

321
00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:20.740
that picked Michael Jordan for decades in a row,
bottom one time,

322
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.373
<v 1>and</v>

323
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.370
<v 0>no one's ever going to fucking do that again.
All right.</v>

324
00:19:26.371 --> 00:19:29.280
You got the Green Bay packers.
The Greenbay packers are on their way.

325
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.450
They went from Brett Fan.
All right.

326
00:19:35.451 --> 00:19:39.710
To Aaron Rodgers now an errands done.

327
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

328
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.030
<v 0>I ask you this.
When Aaron Rodgers has done,</v>

329
00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:49.060
if they have another hall of fame quarterback that wins one or two bowls three

330
00:19:50.271 --> 00:19:52.820
times in a row,
I don't think anybody's ever done that,

331
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.393
<v 1>right?</v>

332
00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:00.920
<v 0>I don't think so.
No,
they haven't.
Nobody's ever fucking done that.</v>

333
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:03.303
<v 1>MMM.</v>

334
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.770
<v 0>What is amazing too is they have three.
They do.</v>

335
00:20:06.771 --> 00:20:10.290
They have the greatest quarterbacks of all time.
Collectively,
Bart Starr,

336
00:20:10.291 --> 00:20:15.260
Brett Farve,
Aaron Rodgers who can do better than that.
Terry Bradshaw.

337
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.360
Ben Roethlisberger.
Then you got nothing.

338
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:24.810
We got Tom Brady in my heart also says Steve Drogan drew Bledsoe.

339
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:29.640
But you know the stat people won't allow that.
Um,

340
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:37.010
blob greasy Dan Marino to have three.
Three is hard.

341
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:44.130
Let's see here.
Roger Starbuck.

342
00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.900
Nope.
Nobody else there.
Wait a fucking minute.

343
00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:56.010
God knows a bears and fucking brown so you don't have to think about them.

344
00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.980
Alliance Bobby Lane.
That's it.

345
00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.390
Huh?
Come on in buddy.

346
00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:08.773
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

347
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.100
<v 0>Hey.
Hey.
Did you like the waffles?</v>

348
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:15.520
<v 1>Oh yeah.</v>

349
00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:19.960
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
yeah.
What are you doing today?</v>

350
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:25.970
<v 1>Come on up on the bed.
It's okay.</v>

351
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.353
Come on.

352
00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.260
<v 0>You want to hold that?
All right.
Um,</v>

353
00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:36.320
well I'm talking about is anybody other than the packers have three hall of fame

354
00:21:37.281 --> 00:21:38.114
quarterbacks.

355
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.610
<v 1>Hello?
Huh?</v>

356
00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.720
<v 0>Hell,
you want to say hello?
Say Hello.</v>

357
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:45.763
<v 1>Hello?</v>

358
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:51.090
<v 0>Say Hello.
Say hello everybody.
Now she's getting shy.</v>

359
00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.040
Um,
yeah,
I got to give it.

360
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.370
I got to give it up to the Green Bay packers and which makes sense because

361
00:21:57.371 --> 00:22:00.400
they've won the most NFL titles and super bowls.
But you guys,

362
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.530
you guys have heard this argument enough times.
Um,

363
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.620
it's time for me to read some advertising.
I only got one this week.

364
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:11.620
Oh,
hey buddy,
it's dollar shave club.

365
00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.340
Dollar Shave Club.
Can she not be looking at this thing?

366
00:22:15.341 --> 00:22:19.000
I'm trying to avoid the screen time.
She's looking at her herself,
not in her bed.

367
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:23.050
Say Bye bye.
Bye Bye.
Yeah,
it's all done.
All done.

368
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:29.420
I know you want it,
but you can't.
You can't.
You can't have it.
The whoa,
whoa.

369
00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:30.540
What is she doing today?

370
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:31.543
<v 1>No ma'am,</v>

371
00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.820
<v 0>you going to music class
now?
She said remote</v>

372
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:43.230
Fi.
Yeah,
she's not happy.
All right.

373
00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:48.220
She's saying I want remote.
I want remote.
All right.
Dollar Shave Club.

374
00:22:48.221 --> 00:22:50.530
Dollar Shave Club has everything you need to look,

375
00:22:50.531 --> 00:22:55.531
feel and smell your best and you never have to go to the Stila.

376
00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:59.350
That's because they deliver everything you need right to your door and they keep

377
00:22:59.351 --> 00:23:04.000
you fully stocked on what you use so you don't run out.
Here's how it works.

378
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:07.000
Dollar Shave Club has everything you need to get ready in matter what you

379
00:23:07.001 --> 00:23:10.600
getting ready for.
Have you covered head to toe for your hair,
your skin,

380
00:23:10.601 --> 00:23:13.360
your face,
you name it,
they have it.
You know what's hilarious?

381
00:23:13.361 --> 00:23:16.210
Somebody is going to commit a murder one day and then just use all the dollar

382
00:23:16.211 --> 00:23:20.810
shave club products and you know what if they actually get away with it,

383
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:24.070
the is is awful is that is it will be great for this company.

384
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.220
Not saying you need to be that clean.

385
00:23:27.221 --> 00:23:30.730
Not saying we advocate murdering somebody and getting away with it.

386
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.900
We're just saying that's how you will be clean enough to get away with a murder

387
00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:39.640
if this wrong.
That dollar shave club has doubled down and embraced.

388
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:45.010
Um,
and you have this new program where they automatically keep you stocked up on

389
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.740
the products you use.
You determine what you want and when you want it.

390
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:54.040
And it shows up right at you Dilla from once a month to once every six months

391
00:23:54.321 --> 00:23:58.940
plus what they're handsome discount.
The more you buy,
the more you save.

392
00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:00.630
Um,

393
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:05.360
and right now dollar shave club has a bunch of status sets you can get for just

394
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:08.900
five bucks,
like their oral care kit.
After that,

395
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.340
the restock box ships regular size

396
00:24:11.341 --> 00:24:16.341
products@regularpricegetsyoustartasetforjustfivedollarsrightnowatdollarshaveclub.com

397
00:24:17.151 --> 00:24:20.960
slash bar.
That's dollar shave club.com/burr.

398
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:22.640
You know what those sons of bitches did?

399
00:24:22.641 --> 00:24:27.050
They actually gave me a little old gym bag,
green and white,

400
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.990
like the money they're making,
right?
It has my initials on it.

401
00:24:29.991 --> 00:24:31.610
It's great old school guys.
Shit.

402
00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:34.670
And I opened it up and there was a bunch of ping pong balls in there.

403
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:39.050
I think that's,
I dunno.
So you'd stuff doesn't smell.
I have no idea.

404
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:42.170
But I was looking for my favorite product that they have is the one wipe

405
00:24:42.171 --> 00:24:46.120
Charlies.
You know what I mean?
That's like the poor man's,
but hey,

406
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.480
it's like toilet paper,
2.0 so you know,

407
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:54.250
you don't fucking leave let with a ticker tape parade still on your fucking ass

408
00:24:54.251 --> 00:24:57.470
hole.
I'm sorry people,
I didn't,
I didn't mean to be there.

409
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.520
So if Mr or Mrs Shave Club is listening,

410
00:25:04.521 --> 00:25:06.410
why don't you help both freckled stock up.

411
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.530
Maybe I could get a fucking membership and stop being such a fucking cheap

412
00:25:09.531 --> 00:25:13.370
pastored here.
Um,
boom.

413
00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:17.150
[inaudible] boom,
boom,
boom to do one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight,

414
00:25:17.151 --> 00:25:21.650
nine by guy digging,
digging,
digging,
digging,
digging and gang.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

415
00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.220
Paul Versey,
I love Paul Versey and you know something,

416
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.520
he had one of the most inadvertently hilarious tweets last night,

417
00:25:28.521 --> 00:25:32.390
which I am going to give him shit about,
uh,
Paul versus on the road right now.

418
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.610
And I'm so proud of this guy.
He's,
he's doing his first like serious,

419
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:41.630
like headlining tour across the country.
Right?
And you know,

420
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:46.670
if you got somebody opening for you,

421
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:49.840
okay.
And you're like,

422
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:51.420
<v 1>okay,</v>

423
00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.210
<v 0>bringing them around the country and you're not a fucking asshole.</v>

424
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.180
You want to see that person grow into a headliner,

425
00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:00.870
which sucks for you because eventually you won't work together as much.

426
00:26:00.871 --> 00:26:04.950
But you know,
you're not going to sit there and root against,
you know,

427
00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:08.100
I'm sorry this isn't coming off as sincere as I wanted to to cause the muscle

428
00:26:08.101 --> 00:26:11.190
clicking on his fucking website,
loading tour dates.
All right,

429
00:26:11.191 --> 00:26:15.180
so this is where he's going to be.
He's got the punchline in Philly.
April 11th,

430
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:21.350
12th the 13th he's at Raleigh Improv on the 18th,

431
00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:26.490
the 19th
and uh,

432
00:26:26.491 --> 00:26:30.720
and the 20th all you people down south don't sleep on him just because he's

433
00:26:30.721 --> 00:26:31.800
fucking a New Yorker.

434
00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:37.250
Then he's at the New York Comedy Club on the 26th and the 27th of April.

435
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:43.230
All right.
Uh,
I got to tell you,
I saw him at,
um,

436
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:49.220
Gotham comedy club and he was stretching because they're waiting for Seinfeld to

437
00:26:49.801 --> 00:26:53.130
get there.
And I just watched,
I watched him and it was just,
I was like,

438
00:26:53.131 --> 00:26:55.320
there it is.
That man is ready.

439
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.340
He is now officially a headliner.
And all you got.

440
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.390
It's just people have to discover that.
So he's learning.
Uh,

441
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.630
it's Kinda cool to actually talk to him cause I remember being where he's at,

442
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.170
where he's like,
you know,
certain areas,
they know who he is and he does great.

443
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.900
And then you go down south and nobody knows who you are.

444
00:27:12.901 --> 00:27:14.850
Same way for the southern comic comes up north.

445
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:17.640
It's like you went to a different country at first till everybody starts to know

446
00:27:17.641 --> 00:27:18.474
who you are.

447
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.160
Imagine Ron White probably had that issue at some point during his career before

448
00:27:23.161 --> 00:27:26.880
he became the superstar that he is,
um,

449
00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.080
catch Paul Versey now.
And you can say,

450
00:27:29.081 --> 00:27:33.480
I saw him when I saw him when,
uh,
but anyways,

451
00:27:33.481 --> 00:27:36.690
he had this hilarious tweet.
He's always talking shit.
He goes,

452
00:27:36.691 --> 00:27:41.100
I haven't smoked a cigar for 17 days,
which I'm very proud of him.
And then he,

453
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:46.070
then he writes,
tell me I can't do 30,
which is fucking hilarious.

454
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.610
Not only because there's people out there trying to get off fentanyl and there's

455
00:27:49.611 --> 00:27:53.930
people evidently getting sold into slavery and Libya and all he's trying to do

456
00:27:53.931 --> 00:27:56.990
is not smoke a fucking cigar and a Jacuzzi for a month

457
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:03.680
that stay strong fall.
But what I love is he goes,
tell me,
I can't do 30.

458
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:08.180
Almost like he was trolling people on the Internet and everything that I saw for

459
00:28:08.181 --> 00:28:09.500
the most part was negative.

460
00:28:09.501 --> 00:28:14.000
People were sending him pictures of cigars or they just write gay.

461
00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.910
It just,
I don't know,
it's just like,

462
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.880
it's like you walked into a boxing ring with your Chin Out,

463
00:28:19.881 --> 00:28:23.820
go on a date and punched me in the fucking Chin there.
Just me.

464
00:28:23.821 --> 00:28:28.010
And the Internet is just mean.
You don't go to the Internet for support.

465
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.620
MMM.
But he hasn't smoked a cigar in 17 days.

466
00:28:31.621 --> 00:28:36.150
And evidently he now thinks I know him in his head.
He thinks he's doing,

467
00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.960
he's like what Reggie Miller used to do to the Knicks.

468
00:28:38.961 --> 00:28:43.260
Like he's just burying three stealing the inbound pass,
running past the three,

469
00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.870
the other side of the three point line and hit another one.
Um,

470
00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.080
but I am proud of him too,
cause that's what,
you know,

471
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:53.950
I'll be honest with you to all the cigars.
Paul is not smoking.
I am smoking,

472
00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:59.590
so I got to kind of lay off.
Um,
but I'm just not feeling like I want to,

473
00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.190
cause that's like my only vice I really have right now.
Oh,

474
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:06.070
freckles is coming up on 140 days and no fucking booze.

475
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:11.140
Um,
20 goddamn weeks.
And I gotta be honest,

476
00:29:11.141 --> 00:29:13.750
as much as I bring it up to you guys,
I always bring it up to you guys.

477
00:29:13.751 --> 00:29:17.410
I know you're sick of it.
I just bring it up to you cause I want,
I want to,

478
00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.530
I want to be held accountable.
No,
I seriously,
I just want this,

479
00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.850
I want to keep going with this thing.

480
00:29:21.851 --> 00:29:24.280
So I said I'm doing a fucking calendar year,

481
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:29.310
January 1st to December 31st and I'm actually thinking of going to my birthday

482
00:29:29.681 --> 00:29:30.514
next year.

483
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:32.423
<v 2>MMM.</v>

484
00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:38.180
<v 0>I don't know.
I get weird with this shit.
Like now it's like,
all right.
You know,</v>

485
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:42.040
I don't want to like,
I don't to end the streak,

486
00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:44.123
<v 1>you know,</v>

487
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:50.410
<v 0>tell me.
I can't fucking make it to 140 days people.
Um,</v>

488
00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.680
anyways.
All right,
I think that's going to be the podcast here for this week.

489
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.790
Congratulations to all the football fans in Europe of the premier league.

490
00:29:57.791 --> 00:30:02.410
You must be going absolutely crazy right now knowing that there is an incredible

491
00:30:02.411 --> 00:30:05.200
chance that uh,

492
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.270
there could be two champions this year or maybe there isn't.

493
00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.870
I'm trying to look at my f is for family script that I have to read here in an

494
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:18.500
hour to table read.
I'm just going to get there early I think,
cause I can,

495
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:23.740
can't read this.
She yet,
it won't open for me.

496
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.050
Um,
anyways,

497
00:30:26.051 --> 00:30:30.520
episode nine everybody this time next week we're going to be reading episode 10

498
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.060
and then sees a number four has been written and we still have to do all the

499
00:30:34.061 --> 00:30:37.270
punch ups and the editing and all that.
That takes another fucking nine months.

500
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.000
But you know,
the big stuff,

501
00:30:40.001 --> 00:30:44.410
the big heavy lifting is out of the way.
All right,
well that's it,

502
00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.810
the podcast.
All right is done,

503
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.670
but there's going to be a little musical interlude here.

504
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:52.490
<v 4>Um,
and then we're going to play your greatest hits.</v>

505
00:30:52.491 --> 00:30:56.270
Another half hour bonus of a greatest hits Thursday afternoon,

506
00:30:56.271 --> 00:31:00.860
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast from earlier this year.
10 years ago,

507
00:31:00.861 --> 00:31:03.400
I don't know when I started doing sticks.
All right.
Have a great weekend.

508
00:31:03.401 --> 00:31:05.690
Your cuts.
And we gone.

509
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:37.663
<v 5>Paul Versey</v>

510
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.660
<v 0>of course was saying Babe Ruth was the greatest baseball player of all time.</v>

511
00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:44.210
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

512
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:47.180
<v 0>And then he said all the usual shit.
He basically repeated shifted.</v>

513
00:31:47.181 --> 00:31:51.950
He heard on TV that he played at the dead ball era.
Right.

514
00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:56.450
And a la head was also trying to tell me,
you know,
yeah.
He,
and I was just saying,

515
00:31:56.451 --> 00:31:59.090
listen,
I'm not saying he's not one of the great players of all time,

516
00:31:59.091 --> 00:32:02.480
but he's not the greatest of all fucking time for the simple fact.

517
00:32:02.481 --> 00:32:04.880
He didn't play against the greatest.
All right?

518
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.950
He played in a segregated league with the Pedro Martinez,
the Mariano Rivera's.

519
00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:13.610
Okay.
The Josh Gibson,
they weren't allowed in the fucking league.

520
00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:14.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

521
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:16.930
<v 0>You didn't have to compete against Reggie Jackson.</v>

522
00:32:16.931 --> 00:32:18.310
He'd have to compete against these guys.

523
00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:22.090
They weren't allowed in the league he was playing and basically a softball

524
00:32:22.091 --> 00:32:26.680
league.
Okay.
With the top third.
What I would say would make,

525
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:31.930
you know would make the major league baseball nowadays.
Okay.
But I get it.

526
00:32:31.931 --> 00:32:34.210
You gotta think like two thirds of them won't even fucking been there.

527
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.750
Then they tried to do that shit.
What bill?
It was only 10 teams.

528
00:32:37.751 --> 00:32:40.280
There's dirty teeth now.
Yeah,
there was all solely fucking

529
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:45.110
<v 6>2 billion people on the planet.
Now there's 7 billion.
All right.
So I'll,
I'll,</v>

530
00:32:45.111 --> 00:32:48.590
I'll knock off like I'll get my next to 10% on his fucking numbers then

531
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.860
like give me a fucking break.
All you gotta do,

532
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:58.500
do he played baseball when people died of tuberculosis.

533
00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:03.280
He played baseball.
Like there was a hit song,
but at the time

534
00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.860
and that song was written in the 1890s and everybody thought it was too fucking

535
00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:15.720
crazy.
What?
What is this devil music?
God dammit.
She,

536
00:33:15.721 --> 00:33:18.810
what happens when you let them off the plantation?
They get a piano.

537
00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:24.120
They couldn't even handle it.
Bat up a pap at that yet.
Add,
add,
add,
add.

538
00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:27.360
Abu [inaudible],
he played baseball.
That was a hit.

539
00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:33.720
Baba Du,
Du,
Du,
Du de,
De,
De,
de Boop,

540
00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.960
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop.
You know,

541
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:40.980
and people would just hear it and then sit around wondering when they were ever

542
00:33:40.981 --> 00:33:43.890
going to hear it again because they had no device to play it on.
Yeah,

543
00:33:43.891 --> 00:33:46.320
that idea and Labu Babu,
Babu,
right.

544
00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:49.890
That guy came to town and everybody stood around him and I played,

545
00:33:49.891 --> 00:33:50.910
you played a fucking piano.

546
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:57.780
You see how they worked out back then?
Head,
shoulders,
knees and toes.

547
00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:02.430
Knees and toes.
Head,
shoulders,
knees and toes.
Knees and toes.
And only white guys.

548
00:34:02.431 --> 00:34:06.210
No blacks.
I Puerto Ricans,
head,
shoulders,
knees and toes.
Knees and toes.

549
00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:08.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

550
00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.550
<v 6>No big dump fucking gloves.</v>

551
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:15.620
That looked like little people hands.
Give me a fucking break.

552
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:20.700
Not to mention Babe Ruth.
I mean they built a stadium towards his strength.

553
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:25.600
That right field fence.
Okay,
you could,

554
00:34:25.601 --> 00:34:30.601
you could make a cop show with two toddlers and they could do the classic scene

555
00:34:31.391 --> 00:34:35.770
where the fucking cop chases the perp down the alley and he gets to the chain

556
00:34:35.771 --> 00:34:37.600
link fence and fucking jumps over it.
You could,

557
00:34:37.601 --> 00:34:40.930
you could fill net with two toddlers with the right field fence in Yankee

558
00:34:40.931 --> 00:34:45.880
stadium.
The House that Ruth built.
Alright,
you backed up to catch a fly ball.

559
00:34:45.881 --> 00:34:50.110
It hits you like mid thigh and you fell into some guy's lap,
right?

560
00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:56.410
So anyway,
give me a fucking break.
All right.
From 1930 on,
I'll give it to you.

561
00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.810
All right?
But if you played in the teens,
he played in the arts,

562
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.760
he played in the 18 hundreds and even into the 20s.
Go Fuck Yourself.

563
00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:09.380
All right.
And I feel like every look,
every like um,

564
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:14.930
major sport has their three stooges era where one team won a bunch of fucking

565
00:35:14.931 --> 00:35:19.040
championships.
All right.
I love the Boston Celtics,
but give me a break.

566
00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:21.530
You look at them in the 1960s.
I mean,

567
00:35:21.531 --> 00:35:25.550
it looks like it looks like a game being played at the y.
You know,

568
00:35:25.551 --> 00:35:29.110
some Christian rec league.
All right.

569
00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.920
The fucking Canadians want a bunch of Stanley cups when you know you had first

570
00:35:32.921 --> 00:35:37.920
dibs on any guy within a 300 mile fucking radius and a 16 league.

571
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:42.270
<v 0>They had first dibs on anybody in French speaking Quebec.</v>

572
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:47.880
And we had,
you know,
we had first pick had like the best guy from Vermont.
Gee,

573
00:35:47.881 --> 00:35:51.660
did you go on a run?
It's fucking ridiculous.
Okay.

574
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:55.470
And then the Green Bay packers who were actually the fucking Yankees of
football,

575
00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.420
you know,
they,
you know,
they were,
when entitles,
when the Canton bulldogs,

576
00:36:00.421 --> 00:36:04.260
we're still in the fucking league or I can't wait to give me,
come on.
All right.

577
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:06.833
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

578
00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:09.520
<v 0>Football was like a,
generally,
I think they played with a pumpkin back then.</v>

579
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:12.730
I mean,
give me a fucking break.
All those chin,
a little star,

580
00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.060
the house during the blah,
blah.
The only ones that I will let,
I will,

581
00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:20.410
I will recognize their championships without a grain of salt.

582
00:36:20.411 --> 00:36:21.470
I would say,
uh,

583
00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:25.960
any of the New York Yankees from like the 1930 [inaudible] for the simple fact,

584
00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:30.550
they went Babe Ruth Lou Gehrig,
Joe Dimaggio,
Mickey Mantle.

585
00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.430
That's just,
nobody's,
nobody's ever going to do that again.

586
00:36:33.431 --> 00:36:36.990
You're not going to get the Jordan of your error four times in a fucking roll.

587
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.810
All right?
You're just not going to do it.
So without a doubt,

588
00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.060
I respect all of that type of shit.
But you know,

589
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:47.530
at the inceptions of these fucking leaks when crazy legs,

590
00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:52.030
Johnson runs around googly eyes fucking Ulysses and give me a fucking break.

591
00:36:52.031 --> 00:36:55.200
Okay.
He played in the deadbolt every,

592
00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:57.970
you don't understand this guy had more devils

593
00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:02.620
who was on the mound?
My great grandfather

594
00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:07.840
got out of the both pan.
Oh freckles.

595
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:14.200
Was that the song they played when he came in said or enter Sandman?

596
00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.830
They weren't facing cut fast balls back then.

597
00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:21.210
I'm sure there was guys throwing 90 a hundred miles a fucking hour,
but just the,

598
00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.460
the amount of bombs that were in that fucking league back then,
I don't want,

599
00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:25.390
I didn't want to hear it.

600
00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:27.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

601
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:27.520
<v 0>There was,
there's a,</v>

602
00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:32.520
there's a guy in the hall of fame for Good Luck in baseball.

603
00:37:32.641 --> 00:37:36.180
He kept a section of rope that was used in an actual lynching.

604
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.930
Okay.
This is how long ago these fucking people played.

605
00:37:39.931 --> 00:37:42.660
And you're going to sit there and act like in the inception of these fucking

606
00:37:42.661 --> 00:37:45.890
leagues.
You know,
I,
I'm,

607
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.900
I'm looking at obviously in every era there,
there was a Jordan.
All right.

608
00:37:49.901 --> 00:37:51.580
But just like the techniques and everything,

609
00:37:51.581 --> 00:37:53.350
some of the records that were set back then,

610
00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:56.800
they didn't have a fucking heavyweight fight.
It would go on for like a day.

611
00:37:58.090 --> 00:37:58.630
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

612
00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:01.600
<v 0>They'd have like a fucking,
you know,
a 90 round fight.</v>

613
00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:07.210
Okay.
Now listen,
you're getting punched in the fucking head.

614
00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:12.250
Well,
what kind of technique are you using?
Phil?

615
00:38:12.251 --> 00:38:15.640
Did bare knuckle fucking the people pop.
Oh God,
go fuck.
I want to hear it.

616
00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.500
I don't want to hear it.
All right.

617
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:22.990
The competition now is so much more insane that I,

618
00:38:22.991 --> 00:38:24.730
I just think it would immediately.

619
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:26.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

620
00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.990
<v 0>But I guess they would compete at the same level,</v>

621
00:38:27.991 --> 00:38:31.980
but like just the fact that it's now everybody gets to compete and not to

622
00:38:31.981 --> 00:38:34.170
mention like,
I mean you could get fucking fathers out there.

623
00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:36.010
I try and they try and teach their kid how to

624
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:36.850
<v 6>throw a curve ball.</v>

625
00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:38.530
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

626
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:39.101
<v 6>To get,
you know,</v>

627
00:38:39.101 --> 00:38:41.980
get the family out of the trailer park when the kids like six years old.

628
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:43.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

629
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:46.310
<v 6>Stunt the growth of,
of one of his fucking arms.
You know,</v>

630
00:38:46.311 --> 00:38:48.950
cause they live in a fucking trailer and somebody's got a growth on their face

631
00:38:48.951 --> 00:38:50.470
that they want to have a gay they want to removed.

632
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:51.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

633
00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:53.180
<v 6>Then all those kids go on out there that,
you know,</v>

634
00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.530
back in the day you went out and you played catch with your little kid.

635
00:38:57.531 --> 00:39:00.680
Now you go out there and you from day one you try to teach him how to switch it.

636
00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:02.220
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

637
00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.730
<v 6>It's insane.
All right,
so whatever,
I'm just saying,</v>

638
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.080
so whatever you guys think,
Babe Ruth is the greatest baseball player.

639
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.560
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

640
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:15.430
<v 6>It's so hard to say because all you can go by is this guy's fucking stats.</v>

641
00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:19.050
Who,
who,
who played back,
you know.

642
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:21.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

643
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:24.300
<v 6>I mean it was probably a guy better than fucking babe Ruth,
but he got polio.</v>

644
00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.140
You know what I mean?
I have it just,
all right,
I'm done.
I'm done.

645
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:13.820
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burns the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

646
00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.760
April 11th,

647
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:21.680
2011 2011 2011 whatever the fuck I got to say all this goddamn year.

648
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:23.810
Um,
how the hell are you?

649
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:29.030
Don't I sound bright eyed and bushy tailed?
I'll tell you why.

650
00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:33.470
I'm going to tell you why right now.
Cause I tried to do the podcast last night.

651
00:40:33.471 --> 00:40:36.740
I just can't do it on the days I travel,
you know,

652
00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:41.030
flew across this country once again from Philly all the way out here.

653
00:40:41.031 --> 00:40:44.210
And I'm like,
all right,
it took an early flight,
seven 30 in the fucking morning.

654
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:50.300
I'll land 10 30 La time somehow I'll take a little old man nap in the afternoon.

655
00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.470
You know,
the old men take a nap.
You know what I mean?
We'll,

656
00:40:54.471 --> 00:40:58.580
you'd lie in the fetal position with your hands in the prayer prayer pose

657
00:40:58.581 --> 00:41:00.950
between your fucking milk white thighs.

658
00:41:00.951 --> 00:41:04.730
If you're me sitting there and you're bbds and a tee shirt,

659
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.120
black dress socks on,
faced in towards the cushion.

660
00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:09.890
That's an old man nap.

661
00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:13.710
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

662
00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:16.530
<v 6>And then somewhere through what?
You roll over on your back.</v>

663
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:19.560
Start breathing out your fucking mouth in and out.
Just,

664
00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.930
you know,
that's what all people do when they old guys.

665
00:41:24.931 --> 00:41:28.140
Do you need to do it right in the fucking living room so no one could watch TV.

666
00:41:28.141 --> 00:41:32.640
Just dominate in the house.
Yo,
man balls just hanging out.

667
00:41:32.641 --> 00:41:36.830
This you get tighty whities um,

668
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:40.820
that was the plan.
That's what I was going to do.

669
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:44.230
Then you always end up getting cold too.
I never understood that.

670
00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:49.400
If I lie on the couch awake and I'm not moving,
I never get cold.

671
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:52.730
But the second you fall asleep,
you get you gotta util you don't Chile.

672
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:58.820
Why do you good Chili when he just leaving?
Um,
AH,
Jesus.

673
00:41:58.821 --> 00:42:00.450
I hate myself.
This week I'm writing it.
It's,

674
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.800
I'm not even going to fucking get into this shit.

675
00:42:03.801 --> 00:42:06.290
How fucking unfunny I was last night on the podcast.

676
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.570
I try to record this in for like 20 goddamn minutes.

677
00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:12.500
I to the point I have to put up one of the outtakes at the end of this.

678
00:42:12.501 --> 00:42:13.370
I've never done that.

679
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:18.080
I want to put up an outtake of me just quitting on a story.

680
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:23.060
Um,
I'll put that up at the end,
but before I,
before,

681
00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:27.260
before I get into the rest of the podcast,
ladies and Joe,
but,
um,

682
00:42:27.261 --> 00:42:29.370
I got a couple of things I have to hype.
Uh,

683
00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.390
like tonight for all you people in Los Angeles,

684
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.660
I'm going to be doing a benefit for a,

685
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:39.290
all the victims of the earthquake slash tsunami,
um,

686
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.400
over there in Japan.

687
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:44.840
I'm going to be doing it at the Catalina jazz club tonight.

688
00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:50.900
It's at six,
seven,
two,
five sunset boulevard,
just east of Highland.

689
00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:52.371
All right,

690
00:42:52.371 --> 00:42:55.430
I'm going to have the link and everything up on the [inaudible] podcast.com.

691
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.690
The show starts at 8:00 PM,
uh,

692
00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:00.440
it's called cabaret cares songs for Japan.

693
00:43:00.441 --> 00:43:04.660
So it's actually comedy and a,

694
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:08.690
and some music.
So there'd be some Broadway stars down there.
Uh,

695
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:12.820
daisy Egan's the one who actually put it together for those of you are in broad

696
00:43:12.821 --> 00:43:16.790
way.
Uh,
she won a Tony Award when she was 11.

697
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:22.910
Alright.
Sang at Carnegie Hall and killed it at 11.

698
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:28.210
All right.
Got got the fucking award from a,
who's that?

699
00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:32.930
That check there that I said that women should still be dressing like a

700
00:43:32.931 --> 00:43:36.020
breakfast,
a breakfast at Tiffany's.
What the Hell is her name?

701
00:43:36.021 --> 00:43:40.430
There are the one who looks like a little fucking a,
not a rat.

702
00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:46.490
Not a hamster.
What's a cute little fucking big brown?
I'd wrote it.

703
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:53.010
<v 8>Okay.</v>

704
00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:55.770
<v 6>That's what she looks like to me.
She looks like,
Oh God.</v>

705
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.220
I wish we could've gone on a date with her and said that to her.
You know,

706
00:43:59.221 --> 00:44:01.650
red is she starting to like me and it just look across,

707
00:44:01.651 --> 00:44:04.860
they're trying to say some pepe le Pew like Romantic Shit.
You know,

708
00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:10.420
come here.
My little brown.
I'd wrote it.
Yeah.
Ah,

709
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:14.390
fuck you ever notice it.
I'll fucking racist at is pepe Le Pew.

710
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:17.030
I never noticed I talk about that on the podcast.
Well,

711
00:44:17.031 --> 00:44:20.360
I don't care if I did got a wing an hour every week.

712
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:24.140
You're not going to fucking repeat yourself sitting in your Goddamn cubicle.

713
00:44:24.141 --> 00:44:28.190
How many times you told that fucking joke?
The two guys,
we'll have you do a book.

714
00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:29.090
You know,

715
00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:32.730
just waiting for a new employee so you can hit them with the same old fucking

716
00:44:32.731 --> 00:44:37.440
story.
How dare you?
How dare you question me?

717
00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:41.920
You motherfucker and your Goddamn cubicle,
Huh?
What are you doing?
Uh,

718
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.960
you hate yourself right now because you ate the whole Cinnabon cause you lied to

719
00:44:45.961 --> 00:44:48.300
yourself.
I'm going to cut it in half and I'm not going to do it.

720
00:44:48.301 --> 00:44:52.170
And what happened?
You cut it in half and you saw that sugary goodness,
Huh?

721
00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:57.000
Just fucking coming down and the fucking baker just that's on top.

722
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.120
Just dripping down the side.
And what do you,
you went down on it.

723
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:04.590
You went down on it like some horror just got off a bus in a strange city.

724
00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:08.190
That's what you did.
Now you had your sugar rush,
you like,
yeah,

725
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.390
I'm going to fucking,
I'm going to make it to the whole day.
Cinnabon.

726
00:45:12.391 --> 00:45:16.320
The poor man's 12 hour energy.
Hey,

727
00:45:16.321 --> 00:45:20.060
can somebody please explain to that commercial to me when those guys take that

728
00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:24.960
five hour energy,
whatever the fuck it is,
they take it and the guy goes,
yeah,

729
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:28.100
all right,
I'm ready.
And then he sits down,
puts his feet up on the table,

730
00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:31.560
reads a newspaper.
I thought it's supposed to make you go work.

731
00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:37.530
What was the deal out?
God,
am I going to suck on this one toe?
You know what?

732
00:45:37.531 --> 00:45:40.140
Fuck you guys every once in a while.
I have a bad set.

733
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.420
I think I'm going to bomb this week.
So anyways,

734
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.910
getting back to what I was talking about.

735
00:45:44.911 --> 00:45:49.800
So I had planned on taking a nap and old man fucking nap by the way,

736
00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.960
strip it right down in my underwears and sleeping on the couch like a fucking

737
00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.650
the old man that I am.
But uh,
the masters,

738
00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:03.740
the masters was on and I had to watch it because we're already McIntyre from

739
00:46:04.861 --> 00:46:09.510
Ireland.
Looked like he was gonna win the damn thing,
you know?

740
00:46:09.511 --> 00:46:14.220
Plus I'm always rooting for tiger,
you know,
because I have issues with women.

741
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:19.850
I have such issues with women that I actually think that at their women meetings

742
00:46:19.891 --> 00:46:21.270
where they trash guys,

743
00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:26.900
they actually have like a little counter on how many tournaments it's been since

744
00:46:27.331 --> 00:46:30.780
tiger actually one.
And they're trying to sit there,

745
00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:35.370
you know it's a fucking braid.
Their Harry muffs just sitting there.

746
00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:42.630
It's a braid.
Their hair,
he must right.
And they're just sitting there going,

747
00:46:42.631 --> 00:46:45.870
you know why?
You know why he hasn't won?
Because behind,
yeah,
we get,

748
00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:49.350
Amie gave me any,
the strong woman.
I know this saying that Shit,

749
00:46:49.351 --> 00:46:52.770
so I'm fucking ruining for tiger.

750
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:57.150
Even though I had a bet with Keith Robinson,

751
00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:03.410
every year we bet the masters and every year he picks tiger and then I pick a

752
00:47:03.811 --> 00:47:05.310
white guy,
you know,

753
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:10.400
it's sort of fun with racism and I send them Texas like white power and this is

754
00:47:10.951 --> 00:47:15.210
a white man's game and you're not taking over this one.
We'll give you,

755
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:18.870
we'll give you a football,
we'll give you a basketball.

756
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.260
Y'All black people actually took over baseball there for a minute.

757
00:47:22.261 --> 00:47:25.050
Then they just stopped giving a shit.
You know,
it was too boring.

758
00:47:25.051 --> 00:47:29.010
I don't know what it was.
I liked that when they do those things on,
on,

759
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.880
on sports shows,
we have to get more African Americans.

760
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:36.730
End of the day of a baseball,
they don't like it.

761
00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:38.840
<v 1>You know</v>

762
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.760
<v 6>what the fuck?</v>

763
00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.150
Why are you going to force a fucking sport down or you know what it is is

764
00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.710
because baseball sucks as they left.
Actually.
No,
the Latino saved it.

765
00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:53.860
What am I a def jam comic.
What's with all the race shit this week bill?
Yeah,

766
00:47:53.861 --> 00:47:58.060
but see a white person played baseball shit.
Fuck

767
00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:05.080
God.
His Jersey.
I'll snug up on his nuts and shit.
Um,

768
00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:09.390
do you guys see
what's his face?

769
00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:14.600
Manny Ramirez tested positive again a and then he just steady fucking skedaddles

770
00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:19.890
retired.
I'm going to go to stay with my dad.

771
00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:22.830
I didn't like how papel bond was giving him shit.

772
00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:25.830
I thought that was a country move.
I get it.

773
00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.860
You're obviously didn't like the guy when he fucking play it on your team,

774
00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:30.390
but you don't have to be a content.

775
00:48:30.391 --> 00:48:34.350
Throw the guy under the bus saying all the shit that these guys are already

776
00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:38.610
going to say.
It's kind of like this,
this ass hole here in the uh,

777
00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:39.970
<v 1>okay.</v>

778
00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:44.280
<v 6>One of the,
one of those guys in the New York Post,
you know,
those guys,
they uh,</v>

779
00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:44.730
or is he,

780
00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:48.850
where is he one of those guys on a round the horn that show that just makes

781
00:48:48.851 --> 00:48:51.790
absolutely no sense.
I don't understand that show.

782
00:48:51.791 --> 00:48:53.620
I don't understand how the points work.

783
00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:59.850
I don't understand why that guy who sounds like somebody imitating somebody

784
00:48:59.861 --> 00:49:03.960
stupid,
you know,
host this show is,

785
00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:07.510
is always clicking.
Why he's in charge of the scoring.
I don't understand it.

786
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:13.480
I don't,
I don't get it.
And it's always like four guys talking at once at a,

787
00:49:13.481 --> 00:49:17.800
I like Wally.
So that's his name.
I add,
I've got,
I don't get that fucking show.

788
00:49:17.801 --> 00:49:21.240
I think this guy is one of those guys on that shelf.
So anyways,
if you,

789
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:25.810
if you watch the uh,
the masters,
which I've watched for the last three years,

790
00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:30.160
I went to it last year,
two years ago I watched Kenny Perry.

791
00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:32.800
I'm watching this guy just,
you know,
it looks like a regular guy.
I'm like,

792
00:49:32.801 --> 00:49:34.330
oh great,
he's going to win the masters.

793
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:39.190
And then I watched just the fucking wheels come off the entire last day and the

794
00:49:39.191 --> 00:49:42.040
guy completely chokes and I got to tell you something.

795
00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:45.730
Golf is the worst game to choking.
You know,

796
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:49.180
if you're a goaltender in the NHL and you let up a bad goal.

797
00:49:49.181 --> 00:49:50.500
I mean how long does that take?

798
00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:55.990
You know what fucking a split second you let up another bad one.
People bull.

799
00:49:55.991 --> 00:49:58.870
Yeah.
I mean what do you have a bad period?
They take you out of fucking gay.

800
00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:03.700
It's maybe a half hour of your life and that's a long fucking time.

801
00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.170
You missed the big shot.

802
00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.440
You call a fucking time out like Chris Weber or whatever.
Right.

803
00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:13.170
It's fucking over.
It's done.
You walk off the court.
That's it.

804
00:50:13.171 --> 00:50:17.550
I guess he gets shit for it still bill Buckner ball rolls through his fucking

805
00:50:17.551 --> 00:50:21.510
legs in the fan that match when it all right.
How long did that take?

806
00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:25.260
Did you choke in golf?
I guess I'm talking about the game itself.

807
00:50:25.261 --> 00:50:28.640
I'm not talking about the amount of shit that you get cause that's usually

808
00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:29.483
lifelong.

809
00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.810
Cause I heard that bill Buckner had to move to like Idaho with some shit.

810
00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:38.410
But what I'm saying is going through the agony of the choke is anywhere from a

811
00:50:39.201 --> 00:50:42.050
split second up to about,
I don't know,
2025 minutes.

812
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:46.400
But in golf it's hours,
hours and hours.

813
00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:50.750
It's three hours watching this kid just all over the fucking course.

814
00:50:50.751 --> 00:50:55.160
And he know what he's 21 years old.
I thought he handled it tremendously.

815
00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:57.470
He handled it tremendously.

816
00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:00.920
One point he kind of laughed and shook his head that one hole when he was

817
00:51:00.921 --> 00:51:02.840
standing in between a couple of houses.

818
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:06.680
I've never seen houses on a golf course before my life.

819
00:51:06.681 --> 00:51:09.620
That's how bad his shot was.
It ricocheted off a tree

820
00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:16.430
is ball landed in like a kitty pool.
I'm telling you folks,

821
00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:20.180
it was off the golf course.
Ah,
Jesus,
I sucked this week.
Um,

822
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:25.640
so this Douche fucking rights,
uh,

823
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:30.590
his shirt was stained in the front.
Everybody shirt was stained.

824
00:51:30.591 --> 00:51:35.130
You're playing fucking golf in the sun.
Fucking fat.
Fuck you.

825
00:51:35.131 --> 00:51:37.100
Goddamn shirt was probably staying when you typed this.

826
00:51:37.101 --> 00:51:40.850
Listen to what this guy said.
It was staying in the front,
untucked in the back.

827
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000
A little boy lost Rory mcilroy trudged up the final holes at Augusta national

828
00:51:47.901 --> 00:51:51.290
and Sunday afternoon as if looking for somewhere to cry.

829
00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:56.960
His swagger had shriveled up into was stoop is boyish.
Smile became nod lips.

830
00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.660
Now I want to ask some.
Anybody else watch it to anybody.

831
00:51:59.661 --> 00:52:03.560
See at any point where he was going to cry,
I thought he held his composure.

832
00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:08.300
Granted he played fucking horrific.
He definitely maybe,
you know,

833
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:10.580
started to panic or whatever.
I'm not a golfer.

834
00:52:10.581 --> 00:52:14.420
I don't know what the fuck happens,
but he didn't look like he was going to cry.

835
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:20.060
I hate these.
I hate these fucking sports writers.
You know what I mean?

836
00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:23.840
You already have a word count,
so you gotta throw in another adjectives in there.

837
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:26.570
He's 21 fucking years old.

838
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:30.170
And then what happens is when something like this happens in sports,

839
00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:35.120
then these fat fuck sport writers who sucked in gym class,
you know,
they did.

840
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:39.920
You know,
they were the kids who got like the bloody nose and playing dodge ball.

841
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:43.850
Then they just start turning up the fucking pressure.
You know?

842
00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.510
That's what sucks about joking those cause now everyone's going to be sitting

843
00:52:47.511 --> 00:52:48.410
there going like,

844
00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:53.270
you know you'd had that collapse at the master's,

845
00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:56.930
barely had time to reflect.
Even at the end I thought he'd said it.
Well he said,

846
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.480
what?
What's going to,
what do you,
what are you thinking about right now?

847
00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.490
And he just said,
listen,
it's too early.

848
00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:03.620
It's too early to reflect on what it just happened.

849
00:53:03.621 --> 00:53:07.700
Talk to me in a couple of days.
I thought it was really fucking mature,
whatever.

850
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:12.740
So I support the guy.
I hope you fucking wins his God damn thing again.
But fuck,

851
00:53:12.741 --> 00:53:17.420
I lost 50 bucks cause tiger ended up having a higher score than Rory.

852
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:21.140
I just picked the top white guy.
I started watching the second day.

853
00:53:21.141 --> 00:53:25.010
So then I bet with Keith and now I owe that son of a bitch.
50 Bucks,
you know,

854
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:29.160
kills me is he's just going to blow it on another itchy sweater.
All right,

855
00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:32.280
let's get into the podcast here for this week.
Uh,

856
00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:36.270
where the hell am I here?
But the by hype to think,
Oh,

857
00:53:36.271 --> 00:53:37.380
another thing I have to hype,

858
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:42.540
the other thing I have to hype this week is people have been asking me,
um,

859
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:46.530
I have a date at the punchline is San Francisco on Monday,
May 9th.

860
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.290
And people are asking me when the tickets go on sale.

861
00:53:49.291 --> 00:53:54.120
They go on sale this Friday,
April 15th.
All right.
That's the deal.

862
00:53:54.121 --> 00:53:57.180
Go to the wild.
The punchline,
San Francisco website,

863
00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:00.150
which of course I don't have that fucking information,
but you could Google it,

864
00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:05.640
right?
Anyways,
so let's talk about my weekend.
I had two awesome shows.

865
00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:06.820
<v 8>Okay.</v>

866
00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:10.290
<v 6>Pet two awesome shows.
I did one at the records theater and Towson,
Maryland.</v>

867
00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.840
And uh,
then the next one I did was at the tower,

868
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:17.490
the tower theater in uh,
Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania.

869
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.200
Legendary venue I might add.
Okay.
And you know,

870
00:54:22.201 --> 00:54:26.220
I'm all about the history.
David Bowie recorded a live album.

871
00:54:26.221 --> 00:54:30.630
Their first time.
Bruce Springsteen got a check for five grand,

872
00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:35.210
was standing on Braf who stood on that stage and performed,
uh,

873
00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:38.880
average white band record,
their live album.
Uh,

874
00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:43.740
the fuck is it called cut the cake,
pick up the pieces.
I can see your Pussy,
lips,

875
00:54:43.741 --> 00:54:46.710
whatever the fuck it's called.
That all was all recorded there.

876
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:50.670
So I got to go down there and become part of that fucking history and uh,

877
00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:55.740
it was awesome and I want to thank everybody who showed up both to the Maryland

878
00:54:55.741 --> 00:54:58.280
Gig and to the one out in Philly.
Um,

879
00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:03.060
Maryland Gig was amazing and then Philly just completely took it to a whole

880
00:55:03.061 --> 00:55:08.010
nother level.
Um,
it was just an awesome,
awesome crowd.

881
00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:11.760
And uh,
actually had some lady,

882
00:55:11.761 --> 00:55:16.710
some lady came up to me at the end of the show and I had run out of DVDs.

883
00:55:16.711 --> 00:55:21.210
I didn't bring enough and uh,
she was all bummed out.
She goes,
you know,

884
00:55:21.211 --> 00:55:25.290
my son was supposed to come tonight,
but he's on house arrest.

885
00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:31.680
<v 8>Okay,</v>

886
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:35.370
<v 6>Saigon,
it's too bad.
I ran out of DVD.
She's like,
that's all he wanted.</v>

887
00:55:35.371 --> 00:55:39.330
He just wanted to meet you and get a DVD.
Sit Down my liberal side.

888
00:55:39.331 --> 00:55:43.140
I'm starting to feel bad.
And I go,
all right,
well you know,
uh,

889
00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:46.290
maybe you send me an email,
maybe I could send one out to them or whatever.
Right?

890
00:55:46.291 --> 00:55:49.380
And she goes,
oh my God,
I would really appreciate that.
And I went,
wait a minute,

891
00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:52.350
wait a minute.
What did he do?
You know,

892
00:55:52.351 --> 00:55:57.000
I don't want to send it out to some fucking pedophile.
I'm attempted racist.

893
00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:01.700
Some guy who's a steel in music online,
I'm fucking with you.

894
00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:06.470
So I guess it turned out some 18 year old kid punched his 11 year old brother.

895
00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:10.910
So her son Fuck head that he is not kidding.
Her son,

896
00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:15.250
18 years old went over and beat the shit out of the 18 year old because he'd

897
00:56:15.251 --> 00:56:17.000
beat up his fucking 11 year old brother.

898
00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:19.820
And because we live in such a pussy time,

899
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:26.910
because that kid basically got his ass kicked for doing what he did.

900
00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:30.550
This kid ends up on house arrest.
Can you,

901
00:56:30.551 --> 00:56:33.730
can you believe that kind of a fucking country.
Who Do we live in

902
00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:36.820
where the 18 year old,

903
00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:41.620
older brother of an 11 year old who got beat up by an 18 year old can't then go

904
00:56:41.621 --> 00:56:46.621
over and kick the shit out of that 18 year old without sitting in his own

905
00:56:46.721 --> 00:56:49.390
fucking house,
missing a comedy show.
You know?

906
00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.570
So now I have to mail them a fucking DVD.

907
00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:57.920
That's another goddamn branch off a tree in the rainforest.
And what,
what,

908
00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:01.870
what did that fucking kid learned?
The other kid,
what did he learn that is,

909
00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:04.960
because he's probably gonna have a lawsuit right there is profitable.

910
00:57:05.410 --> 00:57:09.550
His way of earning income is to walk around and beat up 11 year olds who have

911
00:57:09.551 --> 00:57:10.384
older brothers.

912
00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:11.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

913
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:16.660
<v 6>Oh,
I tell you the hypocrisy.
Um,
so anyways,
I was sitting out there and uh,</v>

914
00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:20.890
I did this gig out there and uh,
upper Darby,

915
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.260
Philadelphia,
it doesn't that sound nice.
Upper Darby,
upper class,
upper,

916
00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:29.710
we're up on a hill.
We're looking down on the poor people.
Um,

917
00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:32.500
that's not what Philly is like in Upper Darby.

918
00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:34.900
It was one of the most horrific neighborhoods I've ever driven through.

919
00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:36.610
I'd never been like,
you know,

920
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:42.220
I don't mind driving through the projects during the day cause the people I see

921
00:57:42.221 --> 00:57:42.851
out,
I'm like,
all right,

922
00:57:42.851 --> 00:57:46.300
these are just fucking hard work and people coming off from their jobs.

923
00:57:46.301 --> 00:57:47.650
It's when the sun goes down,

924
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.580
you know basically any way you're at when the sun goes down,

925
00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.560
that's when the fucking assholes come out.

926
00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:54.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

927
00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:58.520
<v 6>Both in the inner city and out in the suburbs.
You get all this,</v>

928
00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:01.620
no serial killer walking around the suburbs out in the broad daylight.

929
00:58:01.621 --> 00:58:02.700
He comes out at night.

930
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:08.140
This is one of the few neighborhoods during the fucking day
you,

931
00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:10.960
I can't even explain it like I dunno,
go Google some pictures.

932
00:58:11.050 --> 00:58:13.030
Upper Darby in Philly.
It's,

933
00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:16.030
it's unbelievable that Americans have to fucking live this way.

934
00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:17.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

935
00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:20.850
<v 6>Ashley will do.
My opening joke was after driving through that neighborhood,</v>

936
00:58:20.851 --> 00:58:23.070
I was like,
what the fuck is New Orleans Bitch and above?

937
00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:28.090
You don't know what it looked like.
These these fucking houses,
they look like,

938
00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:33.220
you know the end of all in the family when they go going down that horrific

939
00:58:33.221 --> 00:58:36.910
street of houses and Queens,
that's what it looked like.

940
00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:38.920
It looked like a,

941
00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:43.210
except they were all rusted out and I swear to God I thought they had like tin

942
00:58:43.211 --> 00:58:44.044
roofs or something.

943
00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.130
So many ways.
As long as long story short,

944
00:58:50.370 --> 00:58:54.690
I have a 7:30 AM flight the next fucking day.
Oh by the way,

945
00:58:54.691 --> 00:58:59.010
the reason why I got lost going over there is because I was using my smartphone

946
00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:02.940
and I'm using the little map thing and I swear to God,
that fucking thing.

947
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:06.840
I'm going back to maps.
The rand McNally,

948
00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:10.470
you know what I liked about the rand McNally at no point when I was looking at

949
00:59:10.471 --> 00:59:14.100
it,
did it shut off?
Did it go black?

950
00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:18.480
The screen went black and then I had to scroll my thumb down it while I'm still

951
00:59:18.481 --> 00:59:22.810
trying to continue to drive.
The whole fucking thing was horrific.
I'm just,
I'm,

952
00:59:22.811 --> 00:59:26.000
I'm completely,
I don't,

953
00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:28.350
I'm going to go on a limb here and say we have enough technology.

954
00:59:28.351 --> 00:59:30.840
What do you guys think?
Am I crazy?

955
00:59:32.350 --> 00:59:36.180
I like that three D TV.
Let me ask you guys is,
are you really,

956
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:40.070
you guys really going to go out and buy those fucking things and then there's

957
00:59:40.071 --> 00:59:43.820
going to be the tipping point where more people have them then don't have them.

958
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:48.410
So then eventually I'm not going to be able to see shit on my regular fucking
TV.

959
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:53.720
Three d TV is to be,
is it,
is it nuts?
Fucking clear enough with the HD TV?

960
00:59:53.721 --> 00:59:55.670
Is it not clear enough that I can see the,

961
00:59:55.690 --> 00:59:59.660
the fucking cartilage inside the nose of the fucking newscaster mean?

962
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:03.620
They kept saying that when I was watching the masters of Hilarious,

963
01:00:03.621 --> 01:00:05.410
they go the masters and three lakes,

964
01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:08.150
like I really need to be sitting there bending back.

965
01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:11.780
Like I'm watching the matrix is the golf ball goes flying over my fucking head.

966
01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.273
You know,

967
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:17.480
you're living from outside life is in three d Gulf for a fucking walk.

968
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:21.770
It's a total scam.
Think about how much you want it.

969
01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.050
I want to tell you guys this,
right?
Just think about this shit.

970
01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:28.160
Think about all the shit on three d.
All right.
Do you want to watch this DVD?

971
01:00:28.161 --> 01:00:31.250
Need to watch two and a half men in three d like wow.

972
01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:33.470
I feel like I'm sitting on the couch with them.

973
01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:35.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

974
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:40.080
<v 6>Do you need to watch the news in three d?
I'm going to tell you right now,</v>

975
01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:43.200
sports in three d is going to suck.

976
01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:44.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

977
01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:47.090
<v 6>It's going to suck.
I'm gonna tell you right now it's,
it's,
it's gonna.</v>

978
01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:50.080
I already think what the Hd TV,
it's all,
it's,

979
01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:52.600
it's getting to the point where it's so clear.

980
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:56.230
It's like HD is like clearer than real life.

981
01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:57.530
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

982
01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:59.540
<v 6>I dunno.
It's like,
it's like a fucking acid trip.</v>

983
01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.040
I remember one time I was watching this baseball game with this other comedian.

984
01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:05.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

985
01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:08.140
<v 6>And we were sitting there watching the game when HD TV first came out,</v>

986
01:01:08.141 --> 01:01:09.400
we weren't even watching the game.

987
01:01:09.401 --> 01:01:13.210
He was pointing at somebody and like the third row,

988
01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:17.710
go and look at that guy shirt.
Look how fucking orange his shirt is.
And it was,

989
01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:21.040
it was literally an orange that did not exist in real life.

990
01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:22.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

991
01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:25.170
<v 6>So what happened?
Everybody bought those fucking three d,
uh,</v>

992
01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.060
bought the flat screen TVs,

993
01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:33.320
you know now old people with their little square TV from the greatest
generation.

994
01:01:33.321 --> 01:01:33.981
They got to go out,

995
01:01:33.981 --> 01:01:38.840
buy a flat screen TV that breaking their fucking hip as they try to put it up on

996
01:01:38.841 --> 01:01:43.841
top of their old fashioned radio where they used to listen to FDI and his

997
01:01:44.241 --> 01:01:45.590
fireside chats.

998
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.690
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

999
01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:50.140
<v 6>right.
They finally get the fucking thing up there.</v>

1000
01:01:50.830 --> 01:01:51.060
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1001
01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:55.380
<v 6>The bankers took then their entire retirement and now you consequent to go out</v>

1002
01:01:55.381 --> 01:01:56.700
and buy three d TVs.

1003
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1004
01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:01.820
<v 6>It's got to fall down on their fucking old heads and that's going to be yet</v>

1005
01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:07.510
please people.
Please don't buy those three d TVs.
It's a fucking scam.

1006
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:09.730
What's going to happen with your old flat screen TV?

1007
01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.200
What are you going to do with that?
Just going to throw it out.

1008
01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:15.960
It's going to end up in the ocean.
It's talking about this this weekend.

1009
01:02:15.961 --> 01:02:20.080
We are going to be able to walk to Europe on on old flat screen fucking TVs.

1010
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:24.000
You don't need it is what I'm trying to tell you.
I've never,

1011
01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:29.180
I can't remember the last time I fucking prayed that a a that a technology was

1012
01:02:30.691 --> 01:02:35.490
going to bomb the way have with those,
those 3d fucking TVs.
All right.

1013
01:02:35.491 --> 01:02:36.330
And I don't want to hear any,

1014
01:02:36.331 --> 01:02:40.800
you fucking cunt sending me emails talking about the discovery channel and how

1015
01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:45.450
the fucking do from the Goddamn rain forest frog is going to drip off right

1016
01:02:45.451 --> 01:02:48.810
until you fucking lap.
And if you smoked some weed man,

1017
01:02:48.811 --> 01:02:52.550
how fucking cool that's going to be.
And then all the Frat Boys,
who would've,

1018
01:02:52.551 --> 01:02:57.270
well porno woo boy in three d.
What about fucking a real girl?

1019
01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:01.800
What about that?
You know,
all right,

1020
01:03:01.801 --> 01:03:02.780
I'm going to give you a porno.

1021
01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:05.190
I will give you porno cause you know what's going to be great.

1022
01:03:05.191 --> 01:03:08.790
I can't wait for that fucking sex suit to come out.
You know,

1023
01:03:08.791 --> 01:03:12.210
they're working on that like a full body sex suit is actually scientists working

1024
01:03:12.211 --> 01:03:16.320
on that,
having mature conversations,
uh,
you know,

1025
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:21.840
like nuts snickering at all talking about these,
these fucking,

1026
01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:25.650
as they develop in like dissections and basically what it's going to be.

1027
01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:27.380
Do you remember that?
That little one.

1028
01:03:27.381 --> 01:03:31.590
See that Arthur Fonzie rally used to wear when he'd be in his garage working on

1029
01:03:31.591 --> 01:03:34.560
some fucking 1940s rusted out hunk of Shit.

1030
01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:37.540
Remember that the thing that he would wear,
it's kind,

1031
01:03:37.541 --> 01:03:42.450
kinda dirty version of like those jumpsuits that the caddies were at the
masters,

1032
01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:46.310
you know
course Brittany would wear one,

1033
01:03:46.311 --> 01:03:50.540
roll it up and have her titties hanging out of it and talk,
you know saying like,

1034
01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:54.290
oops,
did I just touch your Dick again?
Whatever the fuck she used to sing about.

1035
01:03:54.291 --> 01:03:55.970
Right.
Hey,

1036
01:03:55.971 --> 01:03:59.390
do you know in rolling stone they had the top one hardest 100 artists of all

1037
01:03:59.391 --> 01:04:03.800
time and Madonna was like 50 something and I was going to get upset,

1038
01:04:03.801 --> 01:04:06.950
but I was just like,
you know what,
how many pop stars can last fucking 30 years.

1039
01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:12.170
But then I thought there was justice because they had like other famous artists

1040
01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:17.680
writing like you know like quest love would write the one for prince you two

1041
01:04:19.371 --> 01:04:23.090
would write the one for like a,
you know,
fucking rolling stones or whatever.

1042
01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:27.620
But I thought it was really fitting that Britney Spears wrote the one from

1043
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:28.463
Madonna,

1044
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:35.690
although it should have been lady Gaga.
She's doing a fucking songs,
right?

1045
01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:40.050
Like fucking word for word.
She's doing a Mashup without what?

1046
01:04:40.051 --> 01:04:43.180
That Mcdonald's lyrics over the top is that what the fuck she's doing anyways,

1047
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:45.410
let me get back to what the fuck I was talking about here.

1048
01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:47.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1049
01:04:47.090 --> 01:04:52.050
<v 6>Which I can't even remember.
The fuck is wrong with my brain this week.</v>

1050
01:04:53.830 --> 01:04:56.170
What the fuck was I just talking about?

1051
01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:04.100
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
You know,
so you know what?
I'm fucking Rory.

1052
01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:07.670
Whatever the fuck his name is,
right?
Mackle Roy right now.
Okay.

1053
01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:10.760
I had this whole fucking thing when it's the final days of the masters and I'm

1054
01:05:10.761 --> 01:05:14.030
just limping my way through 18 holes of this fucking podcast,

1055
01:05:14.031 --> 01:05:16.790
this podcast right now,
it's in between those two little,

1056
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.090
just like Rory was on the fucking 13th or the 15th fucking Hole,

1057
01:05:22.091 --> 01:05:26.200
whatever the hell it was.
What happened to all fat tits,

1058
01:05:26.201 --> 01:05:31.010
a Phil Mickelson.
I wanted him to win another one.
I'll tell you,

1059
01:05:31.011 --> 01:05:32.710
it killed me that I wasn't there at the masters.

1060
01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:35.380
If you ever get a fucking chance,
you got to go.
I went last year,

1061
01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:38.950
I've been to a super bowl and it's never really bugged me that I didn't go to

1062
01:05:38.951 --> 01:05:42.250
another one.
It bugged me for the first couple of years,

1063
01:05:42.251 --> 01:05:45.490
but once the game was over and I still had two grand in my pocket and I didn't

1064
01:05:45.491 --> 01:05:46.500
have to go to uh,

1065
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:51.400
an airport and stand in line and do that horse shit again and fly home and it's

1066
01:05:51.401 --> 01:05:54.730
never bugged me.
But this one seriously bugged me that I wasn't there.

1067
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:58.420
He got to go once in your life.
You got to go down to Augusta,

1068
01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:01.420
but I've got to tell you,
it's one in one of the shittiest fucking,
uh,

1069
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:05.600
it's not even in a shitty neighborhood.
It's just like,
you know,

1070
01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.280
you know when they show that,

1071
01:06:07.281 --> 01:06:11.480
when you drive up and you look at the Georgia Pines,
whatever the fuck they are,

1072
01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.800
when you drive up to the clubhouse,
first of all,
as a spectator,

1073
01:06:14.810 --> 01:06:17.390
you're not allowed to drive up there and you'd never see it.

1074
01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.400
You're not allowed to walk around that side of it.

1075
01:06:19.401 --> 01:06:23.510
That's just for the players and the members,
but right outside of that,

1076
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:24.890
like a half a mile away.

1077
01:06:24.891 --> 01:06:29.240
He's like a fucking waffle house at Denny's at JC Penney's.

1078
01:06:29.241 --> 01:06:33.440
Just like just that shit.
Mcdonald's

1079
01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:36.490
ace hardware store,

1080
01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:41.350
the way they shoot that thing is they shoot the masters the same way they shoot

1081
01:06:41.351 --> 01:06:44.200
like Elvis's house.
Like when you look at Elvis's house,

1082
01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:48.520
it looks like it's just like it's in Savannah,
Georgia or something.

1083
01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:52.060
And then you go to Elvis's house and I swear to God there's like an,

1084
01:06:52.061 --> 01:06:56.800
I hop like right next door.
And I was like,
yeah,
that makes sense.

1085
01:06:56.801 --> 01:06:57.880
That's why he was so fat.

1086
01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:02.430
He could just walk down his driveway and go get some pigs and blankets and he'd

1087
01:07:02.431 --> 01:07:03.650
just go over there.
You know?

1088
01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:12.160
Was Elvis the first fat coke kid?
You know,
they talk about that.

1089
01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:14.440
Like most people do coke,
the,
they're not,
uh,

1090
01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:19.720
they fucking lose weight or some shit,
you know,
I dunno.
You know something,

1091
01:07:19.721 --> 01:07:22.780
he got fat too.
Before we really had all the preservatives in there.

1092
01:07:22.781 --> 01:07:26.590
He was just fat on some,
what the fuck was he eating?

1093
01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:30.610
Peanut butter and fucking banana fried sandwiches on his fucking jet.

1094
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:35.980
Splitting his jumpsuits.
Oh,
another jumpsuit.
Bringing it back around again.

1095
01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:40.940
That's exactly what those,
those,
those caddies got those jumpsuits.
They all,

1096
01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:43.360
the missing is the cake.
And they could come down on one knee.

1097
01:07:43.361 --> 01:07:46.390
That's what they should do.
Come down on one knee holding out the Cape.

1098
01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:49.480
Is Somebody fucking Putz for the master's?

1099
01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.590
That would add some excitement,
wouldn't it?
All right,
let's get back to Philly.

1100
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:58.300
So anyways,
so I got to,
I got to 7:30 AM flight.
All right.
So I'm thinking,

1101
01:07:58.301 --> 01:07:59.134
all right,

1102
01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:03.430
that means I gotta get up at fucking five 30 return the rental car and all that

1103
01:08:03.490 --> 01:08:07.300
horseshit.
Why don't I stay at a hotel right next to the airport?

1104
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:12.700
So my travel agent gives me the whole list of,
uh,

1105
01:08:12.701 --> 01:08:15.920
of options of where I can stay.
So I'm like,
yeah,
fuck it.
All right.

1106
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:20.390
I checked them out.
And one of them is the Sheridan Sheridan,
respected name,

1107
01:08:20.690 --> 01:08:25.370
a very quality hotel.
I say,
I'm going to stay there.

1108
01:08:25.371 --> 01:08:28.910
And the price reflected that it was a quality hotel costs me like,
oh,
you know,

1109
01:08:28.911 --> 01:08:31.430
180 bucks or something like that was a lot of fucking money.

1110
01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:35.000
So a one 99 something like that,

1111
01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:36.640
<v 9>you know,
for Philly,</v>

1112
01:08:36.641 --> 01:08:40.870
that's a lot of fucking money considering I was right outside upper Darby.

1113
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:44.820
So anyways,
here's my travel tip for you.

1114
01:08:44.821 --> 01:08:47.220
Do not ever stay at the fucking Sheridan.
Yeah.

1115
01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:52.680
<v 6>At the Philadelphia International Airport.
It is a beyond ghetto.</v>

1116
01:08:52.830 --> 01:08:55.930
Sharon and I,
and it's so fucking ghetto that I,

1117
01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:59.850
I knew it was a fucked up Sharon before I even went into it.

1118
01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.090
I pulled up and it looked fine.
I got out of my car,
it looked fine.

1119
01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:07.800
And as I walked into the place,
as I was walking in,

1120
01:09:07.801 --> 01:09:11.790
these four chicks were coming out and they just look like horse from a reality

1121
01:09:11.791 --> 01:09:15.210
show.
Awful tattoos on their feet.

1122
01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:19.710
Tidies up and pushed together these cheap ass looking stripper shoes.

1123
01:09:19.711 --> 01:09:24.120
And I went out and though,
oh no,
not,
not,
not,
not a bad hotel.
Please God,

1124
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:26.670
please.
I start praying to the travel gods,
please,

1125
01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:31.140
please don't let this be a bad hotel.
You know?
I'm like,
wait,
but you know,

1126
01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.600
at first I was like,
all right,
what?
What are these like call girls?

1127
01:09:33.601 --> 01:09:37.890
So they just get done servicing some fucking married business guy on the road.

1128
01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:42.180
Is that what they did?
But it was like 12 noon.
It's like,
no,
no,
no.

1129
01:09:42.181 --> 01:09:47.130
Call Girls are up at 12 noon.
All right.
They already wiped fucking washed off.

1130
01:09:47.131 --> 01:09:51.780
The vaginas hosed up down at like eight in the morning and now they just fell

1131
01:09:51.781 --> 01:09:55.830
asleep face down in a fucking pile of glitter and then not to wake up against it

1132
01:09:55.831 --> 01:10:00.050
like five in the afternoon.
That's how it works.
And they wake up,
they fucking,

1133
01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:00.893
you know,

1134
01:10:01.770 --> 01:10:02.400
<v 1>okay.</v>

1135
01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.280
<v 6>I Dunno what they do.
You know,
they put some fucking vitamin E on the,</v>

1136
01:10:05.281 --> 01:10:09.060
on the ligature marks around the neck from the night before.

1137
01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.440
<v 9>You don't,
you know what's fucked up about ligature?</v>

1138
01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:22.720
Nobody ever uses that statement unless somebody's got choked to death.
You know,

1139
01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:25.870
ligature,
my,
no,
it does never any ligature marks because you know why?

1140
01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:29.080
Because these girls who are into that type of shit,

1141
01:10:29.081 --> 01:10:33.850
if they survive the encounter,
they fucking,
they were that little,
uh,

1142
01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:37.300
that little ass got the next day around their neck.
You know,
the hoary one,

1143
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:40.120
a choker.
That's what they were to cover it up.

1144
01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:44.320
You have to have a girl wants you to do that once you a choker.

1145
01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:47.830
I remember one time I was with this girl,
right?
And she,
uh,

1146
01:10:47.831 --> 01:10:49.060
she will all this type of shit.

1147
01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:54.550
She wanted me to slap her in the face and all this,
all this crazy shit that,
uh,

1148
01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:58.210
that all these fucking women shows they never address.

1149
01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:03.100
They never addressed the amount of fucking women that like,
that.

1150
01:11:03.101 --> 01:11:05.740
They like it rough.
It's fucking and say,

1151
01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:09.670
unless I just keep picking the same kinds of fucking women,
but it's ridiculous.

1152
01:11:09.671 --> 01:11:14.160
The amount of fucking Bra that I've gone out,
you know,

1153
01:11:14.161 --> 01:11:18.120
fucking women's Lib,
fucking Blah,
blah,
blah.
My career comes first.

1154
01:11:18.121 --> 01:11:23.080
If we get married,
I'm not taking your last name,
Yadda Yadda,
fucking Yada.

1155
01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:26.373
<v 1>Right?</v>

1156
01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:30.600
<v 9>Then you get them in,
you know,
the fucking all pro women.
There's pro women that,</v>

1157
01:11:30.601 --> 01:11:33.890
and I'm making my own money and fucking,
you know,

1158
01:11:33.891 --> 01:11:37.710
in a couple of other fucking lyrics from some stupid Beyonce song,
right?

1159
01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:39.510
All that fucking horse shit,

1160
01:11:39.511 --> 01:11:44.070
you're going to respect me eyeball to eyeball the images of women on TV,

1161
01:11:44.071 --> 01:11:45.810
all that fucking horse shit.

1162
01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.110
And then you get them back to your place and lo and behold,

1163
01:11:49.111 --> 01:11:53.730
they have a rape fantasy,
you know,
am I the only guy by the only fucking guy.

1164
01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.430
So anyways,
so I was seeing this fucking broad,
right?

1165
01:11:56.431 --> 01:11:58.050
And she's going to fucking college,

1166
01:11:58.051 --> 01:12:00.300
she's getting her Mba and all that type of shit.

1167
01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:03.450
So this is the first girl she ever asked me.

1168
01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:07.320
She told me that she wanted,
uh,
me to choker.

1169
01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:13.480
<v 6>I was like,
no,
I'm not doing that.
And she's like,
why not?</v>

1170
01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:18.670
And I said,
well,
because I'm not fucking going to call the cops.

1171
01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:19.481
Like,

1172
01:12:19.481 --> 01:12:22.660
how am I going to talk my way out of that if you fucking pass out and I got my

1173
01:12:22.661 --> 01:12:27.340
fingerprints around you,
God damn neck and your naked body.
I mean,

1174
01:12:27.341 --> 01:12:30.670
that just sounds like one of those fucking things from,
even if you come around,

1175
01:12:30.671 --> 01:12:33.160
I'm going to have some sort of fucking assault charge and then you're going to

1176
01:12:33.161 --> 01:12:36.580
feel guilty because everybody's gonna know because the cops are there.

1177
01:12:36.581 --> 01:12:39.430
So then you just going to be like,
yeah,
I didn't want him to do it.

1178
01:12:39.431 --> 01:12:43.810
So you can somehow skip away with your fucking integrity.
I'm not doing it.

1179
01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.480
<v 9>Of course I did.
Of course they did.
Eventually.</v>

1180
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:51.390
But there's a technique I can't actually,
you got you gotta be,

1181
01:12:51.391 --> 01:12:54.180
you gotta make sure you're up a little higher and underneath and you gotta you

1182
01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:57.010
gotta do it and then not be doing it.
Do it.
And then not doing it.

1183
01:12:57.011 --> 01:12:58.470
Don't just fucking grab it.

1184
01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:02.760
Like you don't grab that next like fucking David Tyree and the helmet catch.

1185
01:13:02.761 --> 01:13:07.200
You don't want to do that cause you got to,
you got to choke him out.

1186
01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:11.460
Uh,
you know,
unless you're really good at CPI,

1187
01:13:12.370 --> 01:13:16.040
I'd have fucked it.
Ended up talking about that shit.
That's it.
Really.
Yeah.

1188
01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:19.620
<v 6>You know something.
I'm going to talk about that in my act.
Jesus said,</v>

1189
01:13:19.621 --> 01:13:24.540
I'll bring the psychos out.
Um,
I'm going to talk about that.
My Act,

1190
01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:27.450
you just heard a fucking preview of a joke.
I really want to bring that up.

1191
01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:28.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1192
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.330
<v 6>The amount of fucking women,
they got that thing right.</v>

1193
01:13:30.331 --> 01:13:31.800
They are all independent and that type of thing.

1194
01:13:31.801 --> 01:13:33.220
Then you get them in the bedroom.
So like you want it,

1195
01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:36.300
they want you to you to kick the shit out of him.
But they got that list that,

1196
01:13:36.301 --> 01:13:37.410
that fucking line.

1197
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:44.270
They want to feel the man's power but still feel like safe overpower me.

1198
01:13:44.911 --> 01:13:48.390
But like do it in like a nice way,

1199
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:53.220
but not nice but nice.
Do you know what I mean?
I know exactly what you mean.

1200
01:13:53.221 --> 01:13:57.980
You filthy fucking whore.
Uh,
all right.

1201
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:59.820
I have to get up.
I gotta get off this subject.

1202
01:13:59.821 --> 01:14:03.980
This is just going to get too freaky to be talking about this by myself.
Uh,

1203
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:07.770
this is the choke 'em out podcast everybody.
So anyways,
so I see these fucking,

1204
01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:12.460
just these,
these whores father didn't stick around,
you know,

1205
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:15.730
George Foreman Grill.
Eaton fucking just,

1206
01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:21.110
just never had a chance for girls just coming out.

1207
01:14:21.111 --> 01:14:24.200
Just never had a fucking chance.
And you know,

1208
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:28.580
just dressed like fucking truck stock,
fucking whores.

1209
01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:30.090
And the sad thing is,

1210
01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:34.400
is they think they look good and they don't even realize the vibe that they're

1211
01:14:34.401 --> 01:14:39.230
putting out.
They don't know any better.
They don't fucking know any better.

1212
01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:42.500
All right?
There was a rusted out car in their front yard that day.

1213
01:14:42.501 --> 01:14:46.820
They were born and they never had a fucking chance.
You know,

1214
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:54.110
the only fucking male voice that was in their household when they was growing up

1215
01:14:54.151 --> 01:14:57.540
was the Billy Best that the Diff,
they're fucking dad left behind.

1216
01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.730
You know what I mean?
Just,
they just never had a fucking chance.

1217
01:14:59.731 --> 01:15:02.940
So that was my first red flag and I was gone off.
Maybe.

1218
01:15:02.941 --> 01:15:06.690
Maybe they use some sky miles.
Is that how they got in here?

1219
01:15:06.691 --> 01:15:08.760
And I just walked in the second I walked in,
I,
I just,

1220
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:13.790
I could just tell the caliber of human being that was in there straight across

1221
01:15:13.981 --> 01:15:18.510
the board here.
Alright.
The caliber or white person,

1222
01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:22.790
the caliber of black person.
The caliber of fucking male,
female,

1223
01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.470
you just can tell.
You know what I mean?

1224
01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:28.450
I saw some black dude,
you know,

1225
01:15:28.451 --> 01:15:31.990
when they get their hair braided but they don't have enough money to fucking get

1226
01:15:31.991 --> 01:15:34.900
it braided enough so they got all those little hairs sticking out of it,

1227
01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:38.230
you know,
cause you can't see the scalp in between the braids,
you know,

1228
01:15:38.231 --> 01:15:40.960
it's not looking fucking right.
It's just not looking right.

1229
01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:44.800
The fucking white dude with the cheap Anderson little suit,

1230
01:15:44.801 --> 01:15:49.540
the fucking creased up Brown loafers with this gold lamay horse shit on the

1231
01:15:49.541 --> 01:15:51.160
front of it.
You know,

1232
01:15:51.161 --> 01:15:55.780
shoes look like they cost 11 bucks and I'm just going out and now,
Oh God,

1233
01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:57.820
least let the fucking room be clean,
you know?

1234
01:15:57.821 --> 01:16:02.080
So I check in the lady behind the counter,
she was nice enough,
you know,

1235
01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:04.150
I don't know how she ended up at this fucking Sheridan.

1236
01:16:04.151 --> 01:16:08.350
Maybe she has stepped out of line at the big a stockholders meeting.

1237
01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:11.980
This is,
this is their stairs.
Sheridan,
Siberia.

1238
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:17.500
So then I go up to my room and uh,
it's weird.
It had like one of the,

1239
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:19.810
almost looked like a little house.
She come walking in,

1240
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:23.380
there's a door and right next to it there's this big window for some stupid

1241
01:16:23.381 --> 01:16:24.214
fucking reason.

1242
01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:29.740
If I want to overlook half the elevators in the fucking poor excuse for a pool

1243
01:16:29.741 --> 01:16:32.530
that they had,
so the blinds were down.
All right.

1244
01:16:32.531 --> 01:16:36.400
So I open it up and it's a sweet,
I'm like Nice.
It was a nice room.

1245
01:16:36.401 --> 01:16:37.300
It wasn't bad at all.

1246
01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:42.040
So I'm in there for like five fucking minutes and I hear this knock on the door,

1247
01:16:42.041 --> 01:16:46.270
right?
Guy fucking knocks on the door.
It was covered in foam,

1248
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:47.560
so that's what it sounded like.

1249
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:52.510
And I opened the door and there's a guy standing there with this giant coffee

1250
01:16:52.511 --> 01:16:56.500
table and he goes and he's trying to walk in with this giant cocktail.
I'm like,

1251
01:16:56.501 --> 01:16:59.290
Whoa,
whoa.
I go,
you got the wrong room.
I didn't order a table.
He goes,

1252
01:16:59.291 --> 01:17:03.940
not all this,
this tables is your room's missing a table,

1253
01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:05.770
Mike.
It is.
They go,
yeah.
Yeah.

1254
01:17:05.771 --> 01:17:10.220
The last people who were here broke the other table.
I was like,

1255
01:17:10.221 --> 01:17:13.280
Jesus Christ.
What'd they have?
Like a party or something.
Anyway.
Yeah.

1256
01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.250
I thought he was going to say no.
He went like,
yeah.
And I go,

1257
01:17:16.251 --> 01:17:19.400
well did they fucking fumigate the place now?

1258
01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:21.350
I think everything's been just dawn.
I'm,
you know,

1259
01:17:21.351 --> 01:17:25.220
I'm laying in fucking angel dust and cocaine and Shit,
you know?

1260
01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:27.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1261
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:30.430
<v 6>It keeps getting worse that I'm sitting there for another couple of minutes and</v>

1262
01:17:30.431 --> 01:17:33.440
then I just hear this lady telling the story,
right?
Yeah.

1263
01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:40.150
Tell me that mother fucker can't come up

1264
01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:46.090
with a motherfucker baby.
And I'm like,
is that it leads?

1265
01:17:46.091 --> 01:17:47.650
Is it at at least a guest?

1266
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:48.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1267
01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.530
<v 6>Is that at least a guest?</v>

1268
01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:53.940
And I fucking open the blinds to my window and she's one of the people cleaning

1269
01:17:53.941 --> 01:17:58.941
the rumps just cursing up a fucking store loud as fucking hell.

1270
01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:02.561
Like all broke.

1271
01:18:02.561 --> 01:18:06.080
He broke people are the loudest fucking people because they live near the

1272
01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:10.260
freeways.
They live near the subway.
They used to shouting over shit.

1273
01:18:10.261 --> 01:18:14.300
So she's out there.
This mother fucker trying to tell me what time it is,
baby.

1274
01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:15.950
Right.
And just screaming

1275
01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:21.200
and you know how much I curse.
Okay.

1276
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:25.790
I was offended and you know how much I curse.
I was just like,
Jesus Christ,

1277
01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:30.050
can you please,
I might have kids someday.
Can you please stop cursing like that?

1278
01:18:30.051 --> 01:18:32.090
But I didn't say shit cause I,

1279
01:18:32.091 --> 01:18:35.990
I mean at that point I knew what was going to happen.
I would have been like,

1280
01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:38.330
oh it just would've been like,
excuse me,
could you do me a favor?

1281
01:18:38.331 --> 01:18:41.310
Could you use now don't you?

1282
01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:45.270
Nobody talking to you baby.
Right.

1283
01:18:45.271 --> 01:18:47.820
I didn't want to go through that whole fucking thing at her screaming at me.

1284
01:18:47.821 --> 01:18:50.670
Plus she was so fucking big,
she probably could've just choke,

1285
01:18:50.671 --> 01:18:53.620
slammed me and we would have had to have a new fucking table,
my room,

1286
01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:55.290
third fucking table that week.

1287
01:18:55.291 --> 01:18:59.760
And I'm a conservationalist is that the right word?
So,
oh my God,
fuck it.

1288
01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:01.170
Whatever.
So I don't say ship.

1289
01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:06.570
So then I go out to go do my show and of course I'm using my stupid smart phone.

1290
01:19:06.571 --> 01:19:09.750
I get lost,
I'm driving to upper Darby.
And it's just like,

1291
01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:14.690
well you know a fucking the white guy driving through there looking down at his

1292
01:19:14.691 --> 01:19:18.470
phone.
Yeah.
Cause you had to see where I am,
you know,

1293
01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:22.370
I did everything but roll down the window,
excuse me,
hustlers,

1294
01:19:22.371 --> 01:19:24.530
could you just stop hustling for a second?

1295
01:19:24.531 --> 01:19:28.160
I can just wondering if you could directly and the direction of this theater

1296
01:19:28.161 --> 01:19:32.840
that I'm performing in tonight.
You know,
horrific.
So,
uh,

1297
01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:36.800
I was so fucking mad.
I really got to get my temper together.

1298
01:19:36.801 --> 01:19:40.340
I was so fucking mad.
I could feel myself when my screen,

1299
01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:41.810
every time I had to go to make a turn,

1300
01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:45.530
I'm looking down at my map and the fucking phone would go black,
you know,

1301
01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:48.830
to save the battery.
And it was always what I needed to make a decision.

1302
01:19:48.831 --> 01:19:53.600
Then I would miss a turn and it got to the point I was squeezing my phone and I

1303
01:19:53.601 --> 01:19:54.111
knew what I was,

1304
01:19:54.111 --> 01:19:58.820
I was going to take it and I was just going to smash it down on the,
uh,

1305
01:19:58.850 --> 01:19:59.930
whatever you call that,
the,
the,

1306
01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:04.510
the fucking thing that you'd not a gear shifter,

1307
01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:07.190
I guess it is geared to think you put it in gear.
It's not a stick shift.

1308
01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:10.440
You know what the Fuck I'm saying?
I was just going to smash the screen on that.

1309
01:20:10.441 --> 01:20:11.370
And I knew that,
that I,

1310
01:20:11.550 --> 01:20:15.750
I have my temporary control enough that I knew I couldn't do that shit.

1311
01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:19.980
So what I did was I just started screaming over and over again,

1312
01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:22.230
fuck you at my phone.
I was yelling,

1313
01:20:22.231 --> 01:20:26.090
fuck you at my in my car yelling fuck you would've phone blow.

1314
01:20:26.130 --> 01:20:30.360
That's why my voice is all scratchy right now.
Not because I,
I had,

1315
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:35.390
I screamed for two shows is cause I was screaming at my cell phone.

1316
01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.140
So anyways,
I finally ended up getting there.
I ended up doing the show.

1317
01:20:41.010 --> 01:20:44.550
It's fucking phenomenal.
And whenever,
whenever I,
I

1318
01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:45.530
<v 10>okay.</v>

1319
01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:46.930
<v 6>Do a show at a place like that.</v>

1320
01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:48.763
<v 10>MMM.</v>

1321
01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:50.241
<v 6>You know,</v>

1322
01:20:50.241 --> 01:20:53.240
there's always some guy's been working the theater for like 2030 years and I

1323
01:20:53.241 --> 01:20:55.760
always walk up to the guy,
go,
you don't have to say any names,

1324
01:20:56.060 --> 01:21:00.110
just tell me some stories.
And this guy was telling stories about,
you know,

1325
01:21:00.650 --> 01:21:04.790
hanging out with motley Crue back during the hair metal days and going out to

1326
01:21:04.791 --> 01:21:08.450
strip clubs.
And he said he was there when guns and roses came through.

1327
01:21:08.451 --> 01:21:11.600
On the appetite for destruction tour.
He said afterwards,

1328
01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:15.680
he was standing in their tour bus and they're looking out their windshield and a

1329
01:21:15.681 --> 01:21:19.820
sea of groupies.
And at 1.1 member,

1330
01:21:19.821 --> 01:21:23.360
I'm not going to name names,
looked out and said,
what's up with those two?

1331
01:21:23.370 --> 01:21:28.100
And the guy said,
oh,
that,
that's actually,
believe it or not,
those aren't sisters.

1332
01:21:28.101 --> 01:21:31.970
That's a mother and a daughter.
And I guess they were really hot.

1333
01:21:31.971 --> 01:21:35.360
And the dude was like,
oh yeah,
bring him on the bus,

1334
01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:40.310
do it in my next life.

1335
01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:44.990
I want to be a fucking musician just to have the opportunity to have that level

1336
01:21:44.991 --> 01:21:47.770
of groupie.
Ah,
just fucking unreal.
So anyway,

1337
01:21:47.771 --> 01:21:52.370
so I dropped you off at Darby was just unbelievably depressing that people have

1338
01:21:52.371 --> 01:21:53.204
to live that way.

1339
01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:57.050
Fellow Americans have to live that way and that we're always sitting here

1340
01:21:57.350 --> 01:22:01.070
fucking acting like we give a shit about other countries and we need to help
out.

1341
01:22:01.071 --> 01:22:03.870
We don't.
All right,
well we,

1342
01:22:03.871 --> 01:22:07.740
I mean you give a shit or I give a shit,
but our government doesn't,

1343
01:22:07.770 --> 01:22:11.160
we're working our way in there to help them out.
Air quotes.

1344
01:22:11.161 --> 01:22:15.180
So we can take their natural resources.
All right.
That's how it is.

1345
01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:20.190
That's what the fuck is really going on.
If you ever wondered why,
all right,

1346
01:22:20.191 --> 01:22:24.630
they don't give a fuck about upper Darby,
new in New Orleans or whatever.
Fuck it.

1347
01:22:24.631 --> 01:22:28.680
All those blue collar towns that are failing out there in Ohio,

1348
01:22:28.681 --> 01:22:30.720
they don't give a shit about them cause they already own them.

1349
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:32.340
So if there's any oil to be had,

1350
01:22:32.341 --> 01:22:34.140
they can just go in and suck it out of the ground

1351
01:22:36.010 --> 01:22:37.780
that it didn't make any fucking sense.
So anyway,

1352
01:22:37.781 --> 01:22:40.680
so I go back to my ghetto ass fucking Sheridan.

1353
01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:41.970
<v 10>Okay.</v>

1354
01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:45.740
<v 6>All right.
I come walking in there and uh,</v>

1355
01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:49.460
if this point,
it's one in the morning.
Now,

1356
01:22:49.461 --> 01:22:52.010
if it was one in the morning and I was at a nice hotel,

1357
01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:56.030
that'd be the usual thing.
There would be some people hanging down at the bar,

1358
01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:59.360
you know,
drinking,
getting ready to cheat on their spouses.

1359
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:04.430
Dress nicely though.
All right?

1360
01:23:04.431 --> 01:23:06.790
But because it was a ghetto fucking Sheridan,

1361
01:23:06.791 --> 01:23:10.150
I went down there and most of the people in the lobby,

1362
01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:14.230
we're children running around screaming like one in the morning,

1363
01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:18.550
kids just running around.
I felt like I was in fucking Atlantic city.

1364
01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:21.040
You know those gamblers degenerate gamblers,

1365
01:23:21.041 --> 01:23:22.600
they don't fucking handle their kids.
Right,
right.

1366
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:27.310
So just as see a fucking children.
I mean,
I was waiting for fucking,
you know,

1367
01:23:29.010 --> 01:23:32.130
Yoga was missing with somebody there,
you know,
gathering them like you could,

1368
01:23:32.150 --> 01:23:34.770
you could have had a children's choir.
That's how many fucking kids were there.

1369
01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:39.540
So I could go up the elevator and I,
and I get out,

1370
01:23:39.930 --> 01:23:42.630
get out of the elevator and I walked back up to my little,
you know,

1371
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:45.210
I told you the front of the room look like a house and there was a door.

1372
01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:48.960
And then there's the window.
And as I'm looking at,
I'm at the doors,

1373
01:23:48.961 --> 01:23:51.780
I'm looking down to take out my hotel key.

1374
01:23:51.781 --> 01:23:56.781
I looked down and on the window sill is a three quarter eaten chicken.

1375
01:23:57.061 --> 01:23:57.894
Yeah.

1376
01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:04.180
Sitting on the fucking window sill.
I got pictures to prove it.

1377
01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:08.560
They're all going to be up on the m m m m podcast.com.

1378
01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:11.860
Whatever the fuck it is.
Is that the name of the website?

1379
01:24:11.861 --> 01:24:15.240
I know the name of the fucking website.
The Hell is wrong with me.
Yeah,
the MM.

1380
01:24:15.670 --> 01:24:20.200
The MM podcast.com.
Uh,
if you go up there,
I'll have all these pictures,

1381
01:24:20.201 --> 01:24:23.040
the pictures of,
uh,
the tower theater and all that.

1382
01:24:23.041 --> 01:24:26.050
I didn't take any pictures when I was driving to upper Darby could for obvious

1383
01:24:26.051 --> 01:24:28.810
fucking reasons.
I didn't want to be,
you know,
I just,

1384
01:24:28.811 --> 01:24:31.750
I would not want to be taking pictures down there cause people either think

1385
01:24:31.751 --> 01:24:36.490
you're a cop or you're just at a documentary.
They're level of poverty,

1386
01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:40.210
which would be fucking annoying to me if I was in that situation.
So anyways,

1387
01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:45.490
with that,
that was my,
Oh,
and then the next morning I woke up and uh,

1388
01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:49.360
I dropped my car off at budget.
It was fucking hilarious when he's hilarious.

1389
01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:53.110
Racial moments here is I go to get on the bus,
the bus drivers,

1390
01:24:53.111 --> 01:24:57.760
black five white guys get on it.
He asked us where we're going.
I go US air,

1391
01:24:57.761 --> 01:24:59.240
this guy says this,
so blah,
blah blah.

1392
01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:03.790
So we're driving in that and he's listening to this preacher because it's Sunday

1393
01:25:03.791 --> 01:25:07.090
morning and the guy,
you know,
he's talking about,
you know,

1394
01:25:07.091 --> 01:25:09.700
people need to be into Jesus and blah blah,
blah,
all this,
you know,

1395
01:25:09.701 --> 01:25:11.050
regular Jesus Shit.
Right.

1396
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:14.400
But then all of a sudden he starts talking about Obama and,

1397
01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:17.260
and around him he's just starts kind of trashed and white people.

1398
01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:18.810
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1399
01:25:18.810 --> 01:25:19.231
<v 6>Just go,</v>

1400
01:25:19.231 --> 01:25:24.231
oh we should be giving thanks to Jesus that has strong black man is president

1401
01:25:24.721 --> 01:25:29.710
and is not afraid to stand up to the white supremacy that we run in this
country.

1402
01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:32.070
And he's got it cranked.

1403
01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:34.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1404
01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:37.330
<v 6>And I'm sitting there at fucking and all I did,
I'd just,</v>

1405
01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:38.720
cause I wanted to have the laugh,

1406
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:41.510
I just turned around and looked at all the other four white guys and then

1407
01:25:41.511 --> 01:25:44.660
everybody's just sort of sitting down looking at the wing tips like rarely,

1408
01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:49.610
what exactly is the call here?
Or can we say something?
You know,

1409
01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.650
excuse me,
we're not all white supremacists.

1410
01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:52.930
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1411
01:25:52.930 --> 01:25:56.410
<v 6>You know,
like what exactly is the proper response to that?</v>

1412
01:25:56.411 --> 01:25:59.740
Because I thought it was,
I dunno.
I actually thought it was fucking hilarious.

1413
01:25:59.741 --> 01:26:03.380
I wish I could remember what the guy's saying.
Ah,
Jesus.
Now I'm fucking bomb.

1414
01:26:03.381 --> 01:26:05.960
And again on this fucking podcast.
All right,
let's,

1415
01:26:05.961 --> 01:26:09.950
let's get through the rest of the,
uh,
what am I going to do?

1416
01:26:09.951 --> 01:26:12.470
What am I going to do?
Some,
oh,
hey,
wait a minute.

1417
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:17.240
Fucking NHL playoffs are coming up.
Everybody,
uh,
you excited?
Are you like me?

1418
01:26:17.241 --> 01:26:20.510
Do you like watching hockey Bruins?
Canadians?
Once again,

1419
01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:25.340
we're playing those fucking cunts up there with all their championships.

1420
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:28.430
Do you know the more I read about the history of the NHL,

1421
01:26:28.431 --> 01:26:31.040
the less impressed with the Montreal Canadiens I am.

1422
01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:34.460
I mean I used to kind of give him shit cause I'm like,
dude,

1423
01:26:34.461 --> 01:26:38.150
you dominated a 16 league and they didn't even dominate the six team league.

1424
01:26:38.150 --> 01:26:39.620
It's like them and Toronto.

1425
01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:45.250
Montreal and Toronto basically had the same amount of cups right through the

1426
01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:50.330
early sixties.
I,
Montreal was ahead but not by much.
Um,

1427
01:26:51.710 --> 01:26:56.710
and then I found out later that the Canadian teams had been be,

1428
01:26:56.741 --> 01:26:59.120
no,
I couldn't give them shit because the Bruins where they are too.
So it's like,

1429
01:26:59.121 --> 01:27:00.290
well,
why didn't you guys do it?

1430
01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:03.500
And I found out one of the main fucking reasons is,

1431
01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:07.520
is the way the league was set up,
any French born Canadian player,

1432
01:27:08.150 --> 01:27:11.720
the Canadian teams had first dibs on those guys.

1433
01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:14.150
That's why they got all the fucking great guys.

1434
01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:19.220
So it's like Toronto and Montreal were just like the Yankees and red sox fucking

1435
01:27:19.221 --> 01:27:24.140
buying up everything.
I don't respect,
I don't respect those championships.

1436
01:27:24.141 --> 01:27:27.470
What do you think about that Montreal?
Um,

1437
01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:31.280
and that what happened all of a sudden you didn't have first fucking choice,

1438
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:35.930
right?
And now look,
now you don't go on a run anymore.

1439
01:27:35.931 --> 01:27:38.090
You want it 93 one in 86 and that's it.

1440
01:27:38.210 --> 01:27:40.310
And don't even talk to me about the seventies.
Okay.

1441
01:27:40.311 --> 01:27:43.910
I don't want even fucking hear it because that was still the fallout of the old,

1442
01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:46.730
the old system.
You had to give those,

1443
01:27:46.731 --> 01:27:50.690
those expansion six teams a chance to get on their feet.
And once they did,

1444
01:27:50.691 --> 01:27:53.150
that was the NTU guys.
So I'm not fucking impressed.

1445
01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:57.680
So fuck you and all your fucking cops.
He had come the Bruins and you know what,

1446
01:27:57.830 --> 01:28:01.010
keep your fucking head up or we're going to slam you into that.

1447
01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:05.300
Turnbuckle whatever the fuck they call it again,
that son of a bitch up,

1448
01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:08.630
they're fake and his father good.
It can cause the worst concussion ever.

1449
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:12.530
Three days later he's at the movies.
He's at the movies.

1450
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:16.230
All right,
I'm just fucking with you.
Okay.
Uh,

1451
01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:19.790
broads Canadians going to be an awesome series and a carry prices playing great.

1452
01:28:19.791 --> 01:28:22.160
So it should be,
uh,
should be phenomenal.

1453
01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:24.350
I don't think the Bruins are going to win the Stanley Cup.

1454
01:28:24.351 --> 01:28:25.940
I just don't think we have enough guys.

1455
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:29.750
And I just think that despite the fact that we have two great goaltenders,

1456
01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:32.540
I just think that there's a lot of goaltenders playing great.

1457
01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:33.860
Kerry prices playing great.

1458
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:37.790
A Henrik Lundqvist is playing tremendous.

1459
01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:43.550
Uh,
who else?
Who else is playing good out there?
Oh,

1460
01:28:43.551 --> 01:28:45.320
he got,
he got what's his face up there and buy?

1461
01:28:45.321 --> 01:28:47.420
Can't ever remember the fucking name.
Who plays,

1462
01:28:47.421 --> 01:28:51.440
who plays goalie up there in Buffalo.
Bill Murray.
Is that,

1463
01:28:51.441 --> 01:28:53.330
what is that word called?
Bill Murray.
Bill Murray.

1464
01:28:53.331 --> 01:28:56.600
And then you got fucking Roberta Lou Longo and his cousin,

1465
01:28:57.290 --> 01:29:01.190
a Theo flurries third cousin who plays out there and fucking Pittsburgh.

1466
01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:04.890
I'm the worst.
I can,
when I went up,
I have to remember a name.

1467
01:29:04.891 --> 01:29:07.230
I can't remember her fucking name.
So whatever.
I think it's good.

1468
01:29:07.231 --> 01:29:11.500
I think it's going to be a
think.
It's going to be great.
I just don't see it.

1469
01:29:11.501 --> 01:29:14.700
I think I will be really happy if we can actually make it to the eastern

1470
01:29:14.701 --> 01:29:15.570
conference finals.

1471
01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:17.353
<v 10>You know,</v>

1472
01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:23.150
<v 6>that's my thing.
You know what?
Hey,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm beaten down as a fan,</v>

1473
01:29:23.151 --> 01:29:26.300
as long as we don't go up three games to none and then lose four in a row.
Again,

1474
01:29:26.301 --> 01:29:27.860
I'm going to consider this year of victory,

1475
01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:31.970
but I do not on any level want to lose to the hated fucking habs.

1476
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:37.460
Um,
and I'm fucking with you a bunch of cups,
but not really.
Okay.

1477
01:29:37.461 --> 01:29:40.040
Let's get onto advice this week,
everybody.
All right.
Hey Bill,

1478
01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:42.860
I always feel like you give great advice.
Well,
thank you.

1479
01:29:43.190 --> 01:29:45.680
So I thought maybe you could give me some in this situation.

1480
01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:50.360
I was in a local shop a few weeks ago and there was a little hottie work in

1481
01:29:50.361 --> 01:29:52.070
there.
Um,

1482
01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:55.250
I had seen her there once before and both times she really caught my attention.

1483
01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:59.150
I had the urge to ask her out while I was there,
but I was too busy be enough.

1484
01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:05.000
And I did.
And I did not say anything to her other than some idle nonsense about

1485
01:30:05.001 --> 01:30:08.600
sunglasses.
I was looking at,
oh,
that's the worst.
Uh,

1486
01:30:08.601 --> 01:30:11.840
the little bit we did talk though,
she seemed really cool and really nice.

1487
01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:16.900
My advice is how can slash should I ask her out without looking like,

1488
01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:19.070
<v 10>mmm.</v>

1489
01:30:20.490 --> 01:30:24.000
<v 6>Coming off like a creeper,
a douchebag.
I'm a good looking guy,</v>

1490
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:28.110
have a great career as an attorney.
But when it comes to ladies,
I can be shy.

1491
01:30:28.111 --> 01:30:30.050
Sometimes saying is that,
you know,

1492
01:30:30.090 --> 01:30:32.370
that's a very strong thing that you're able to admit that.

1493
01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:35.960
But every guy just went,
ah,
I was mad at you fucking fag.

1494
01:30:35.961 --> 01:30:38.830
Go up and say something to her.
That's,
that's how guys handle.

1495
01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:42.810
We just beat it out of each other.
Okay.
We said,
watch I'm trying to work on,

1496
01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:47.220
he says every once in a while you see a girl that blows you away.
And uh,

1497
01:30:47.221 --> 01:30:48.490
this time I wanted to do something

1498
01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:52.260
<v 10>about it.
Uh,
all right.</v>

1499
01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:55.060
<v 6>All right dude,
this is what you gotta do.
You got,</v>

1500
01:30:55.061 --> 01:30:58.960
you gotta get you gotta work on your self esteem.
Okay?
You know,

1501
01:30:58.961 --> 01:31:02.500
you're a good looking guy and you have a great career.
Believe it or not,

1502
01:31:02.530 --> 01:31:04.420
that's game set and match.

1503
01:31:05.170 --> 01:31:09.640
Do you know the amount of fucking not even good looking guys who have a shit job

1504
01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:11.400
and they're just scumbags,

1505
01:31:11.410 --> 01:31:14.680
but they're assholes who are out there fucking crushing it every God damn

1506
01:31:14.681 --> 01:31:18.280
weekend cause he just had the balls to walk up and talk to these women.

1507
01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:19.173
<v 10>You know,</v>

1508
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:23.130
<v 6>this is what you gotta do.
You actually know what you gotta do.</v>

1509
01:31:23.310 --> 01:31:26.070
You said you can be shy sometimes,
but you're saying you're working on it.

1510
01:31:26.071 --> 01:31:29.510
So there you go.
Just keep waiting.
It looked out.

1511
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:33.140
She probably light if you're a good looking guy.
And you're a fucking attorney.

1512
01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:36.490
He actually said something here.
I'm hoping to see you.

1513
01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:39.140
What Caroline's in May if I,

1514
01:31:39.230 --> 01:31:41.870
my Dick had friends can get this shit together if they can't.

1515
01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:45.230
Maybe with your stellar advice,
I can even bring this hottie to the show.

1516
01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:49.840
Why don't you just do that?
Go in there and make her laugh.

1517
01:31:49.841 --> 01:31:53.440
Joke around what there are in anything and just,
just fucking lay it on the line.

1518
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:55.300
Listen,
I'm really attracted to you.
I think you beautiful.

1519
01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:58.360
Ever the fuck you want to say it.
It just say,
you know,

1520
01:31:58.630 --> 01:32:02.680
I think it's always good if you have somewhere that you're going,
just say,

1521
01:32:02.681 --> 01:32:04.780
I'm going to this comedy show I love,
you know,

1522
01:32:04.781 --> 01:32:06.790
I'm really into this standup comedian.
I have an exit ticket,

1523
01:32:06.791 --> 01:32:10.500
which you like to go to women like going to stuff,
you know,

1524
01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:12.310
gives him an excuse to get dressed up.

1525
01:32:12.730 --> 01:32:17.020
It gives him an excuse to not feel fucking guilty when they're blowing you later

1526
01:32:17.021 --> 01:32:21.880
cause they actually went to some sort of ball or some shit,
you know?
Ah,

1527
01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:24.760
God,
yeah.
Even with the advice I'm off of this week,

1528
01:32:24.761 --> 01:32:28.990
but the essence of it is there.
All right.
You already talked to her.

1529
01:32:29.530 --> 01:32:32.230
Just go in there again.
You're not going to come off like a creep.

1530
01:32:33.070 --> 01:32:36.880
I actually think that it's easier to pick somebody up and get that number.

1531
01:32:36.881 --> 01:32:37.750
At least back in the day.

1532
01:32:37.751 --> 01:32:40.570
I have no game left anymore cause I've been in a relationship too long,

1533
01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:45.040
but I always found that it was easier for me to get a girl's phone number on
the,

1534
01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:46.810
at the fucking Jim.

1535
01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:52.300
Jim's a little bit harder but like I should do it on ice to get it on the
subway.

1536
01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:54.860
Oddly enough,

1537
01:32:54.861 --> 01:32:58.960
I had a better chance there than I did in some meat market bar because I,

1538
01:32:58.961 --> 01:33:03.961
I was never good when females had their guards up when they knew what play I was

1539
01:33:04.521 --> 01:33:07.640
running.
Some guys can do that.
They like the old packers.

1540
01:33:07.690 --> 01:33:10.040
Like everybody knew the packer sweep was coming and they,

1541
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:14.090
Forrest Gregg still fucking ran over you and some guys are like that.

1542
01:33:14.150 --> 01:33:18.860
Even when women know they got to dare fucking guard up and they know what the

1543
01:33:18.861 --> 01:33:21.260
fuck they're doing.
They could still plow through it.
They run over,

1544
01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:24.500
the guys just run right over those girls like Forrest Gregg and next thing you

1545
01:33:24.501 --> 01:33:24.651
know,

1546
01:33:24.651 --> 01:33:27.110
they're laying on their backs with their legs up in the air and they get the

1547
01:33:27.111 --> 01:33:29.090
Dick.
I was never that guy.

1548
01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:30.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1549
01:33:30.210 --> 01:33:31.550
<v 6>I was,
I snuck up on you.</v>

1550
01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:35.120
I waited for something stupid to happen that I could comment on.

1551
01:33:35.121 --> 01:33:38.570
And then I get the girl laughing.
And then when her fuck her defenses were down,

1552
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:43.490
I a I'd wrestle her cell phone up from her fingers.
No,
I would have,

1553
01:33:43.491 --> 01:33:46.730
I'd somehow get her number.
So what I would do was I would just go in there and,

1554
01:33:46.731 --> 01:33:50.750
uh,
I'll just keep reexplaining this 20 fucking times,
do get tickets to my show,

1555
01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:55.190
right?
Look at me.
I'll make a little money out of this advice.
So now you've got,

1556
01:33:55.191 --> 01:33:57.920
you've got somewhere that you got to take her.
Take Your Rod,
you know,

1557
01:33:57.921 --> 01:33:59.700
little dinner,
the ski comedy show.

1558
01:33:59.701 --> 01:34:03.390
She's already fucking laughing halfway through my AGI.
You do the old,

1559
01:34:03.391 --> 01:34:06.560
you're laughing your ass off.
Don't try to put your arm around the shoulder.

1560
01:34:06.561 --> 01:34:10.820
That's old school right.
You put it right on a fucking die,
you know,

1561
01:34:10.821 --> 01:34:13.370
and then you sorta start creeping up there with your fingers.

1562
01:34:13.371 --> 01:34:17.090
You know like you sorta thinking about something going Pinky,
ring,
Middle Index.

1563
01:34:17.091 --> 01:34:18.920
He just sort of work your way up like an inch worm.

1564
01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:24.080
And next thing you know if your,
if your,
if your fingers are Nimble enough,

1565
01:34:24.081 --> 01:34:26.810
you know you stretch out your picky,
it's gotta Rub it right on a click there

1566
01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:31.930
and then you get made fun of me cause you guys are fucking walking out during my

1567
01:34:31.931 --> 01:34:34.720
clothes and fit to go bang at the fucking w around the corner.
It,

1568
01:34:34.770 --> 01:34:39.430
it's right there.
It's a lay up to fucking lay up.
All right,
next one.
Hey Bill,

1569
01:34:39.431 --> 01:34:43.390
huge fan of the podcast and all your stand up and have made all my friends big

1570
01:34:43.391 --> 01:34:46.360
fans of yours as well.
I really enjoyed the relationship advice,
blah blah,
blah,

1571
01:34:46.361 --> 01:34:47.740
blah,
blah,
blah.
All right.

1572
01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:52.170
People ask me is starting to address the fact that I've never been married.

1573
01:34:52.171 --> 01:34:56.340
Why am I taking your fucking advice?
Uh,
here's my situation.
I'm 29,

1574
01:34:56.341 --> 01:35:01.010
recently graduated from medical school after a good number of years.
Uh,

1575
01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:03.980
honing my boning skills in the free market.

1576
01:35:03.981 --> 01:35:08.150
I'm ready to calm down and have a serious girlfriend.
Ironically.
Um,

1577
01:35:08.151 --> 01:35:12.050
the girl that I'm dating and wanting to get serious with was actually my college

1578
01:35:12.051 --> 01:35:13.940
girlfriend and first love.

1579
01:35:13.941 --> 01:35:17.750
We dated throughout college for broke up before attending different medical

1580
01:35:17.751 --> 01:35:21.080
schools during our years together.
I cheated a lot,

1581
01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:22.970
but to my knowledge never got caught.

1582
01:35:23.210 --> 01:35:26.330
A big part of the reason that I was so promiscuous besides being your typical

1583
01:35:26.331 --> 01:35:26.931
piece of shit,

1584
01:35:26.931 --> 01:35:31.931
cocky asshole guy full of test testosterone was because she was very sexually

1585
01:35:32.331 --> 01:35:35.060
inhibited,
no blow jobs,

1586
01:35:35.450 --> 01:35:39.380
the routine conventional positions sex about once every other day.

1587
01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:42.500
And that just wasn't cutting it for me.
Now,
in every other case,

1588
01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:45.530
now in every other category,
she was amazing fun to hang out with,

1589
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:48.800
but still lady like carrying respectable,
educated,

1590
01:35:48.801 --> 01:35:52.010
fashionable and extremely beautiful.
So like I said before,

1591
01:35:52.011 --> 01:35:56.630
we broke up for about five years and our back dating again and the sex is

1592
01:35:56.631 --> 01:35:59.450
exactly the same now.

1593
01:35:59.451 --> 01:36:02.780
While I'm grateful that some guy didn't completely smother out during our

1594
01:36:02.781 --> 01:36:07.580
breakup.
I did expect it did expect some sort of sexual maturation.

1595
01:36:08.210 --> 01:36:09.410
Um,

1596
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:10.110
<v 1>okay.</v>

1597
01:36:10.110 --> 01:36:15.110
<v 6>Blowjobs remained few and far between and pretty sub par even for a black chick</v>

1598
01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:20.010
disguise black by the way,
before you think this is something fucked up.
Um,

1599
01:36:20.370 --> 01:36:24.000
what makes it even more difficult this time around is after banging my fair

1600
01:36:24.001 --> 01:36:27.270
share of broad in our off season,
uh,

1601
01:36:27.271 --> 01:36:30.210
my sexual prowess has grown significantly.

1602
01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:33.450
It's hard because I really want to be faithful this time around and take the

1603
01:36:33.451 --> 01:36:36.660
relationship more seriously,
but a fear I'm not going to be sexually satisfied.

1604
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:40.380
My greatest fear is ending up like one of my father's friends who I always hear

1605
01:36:40.381 --> 01:36:44.910
complaining about how shitty their sex lives have become after marriage.
Um,

1606
01:36:45.630 --> 01:36:50.010
how I should have had all my fun now and Blah,
blah,
blah,
stereotypical castrated,

1607
01:36:50.011 --> 01:36:54.570
merry men,
background noise.
Uh,
fuck that extra sad shit.

1608
01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:58.290
I'm not getting married unless I know my wife is going to be a lady in the

1609
01:36:58.291 --> 01:37:00.120
streets in a freak in the sheets.

1610
01:37:01.730 --> 01:37:05.310
How do you like that old African American mantra?
Uh,

1611
01:37:05.311 --> 01:37:08.070
my question is how serious should I take this problem?

1612
01:37:08.071 --> 01:37:11.880
Should I be patient and hope that I can liberate her sexually or should I bail

1613
01:37:11.881 --> 01:37:14.370
and keep searching for a god-fearing dinner?

1614
01:37:14.371 --> 01:37:18.600
Cooking super freak if you don't mind asking.
Uh,

1615
01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:23.390
Oh,
if you don't mind asking Nia as well,

1616
01:37:23.391 --> 01:37:27.140
I'd like to hear what the sister has to say.
Oh,
Shit.

1617
01:37:27.170 --> 01:37:30.410
I should have read that to her by the way.
I'm also black.

1618
01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:34.700
So when you get to,
is it racist,
racist,
racist?
No,

1619
01:37:34.701 --> 01:37:38.600
I'm allowed to say sisters.
Uh,
all right.
Um,
you know what?

1620
01:37:38.601 --> 01:37:40.460
I really wish I read that part of what it had around here,

1621
01:37:40.461 --> 01:37:44.480
but she's not around today.
Um,
what should you do?

1622
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:50.110
All right.
Number one,
don't cheat on her.
Uh,
what you should do is you should,

1623
01:37:50.111 --> 01:37:55.090
you should communicate this tour.
Uh,
obviously not the way he just said it to me.

1624
01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:01.250
<v 9>Um,
well,
Jesus,
this is,
this is tough.</v>

1625
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:05.690
I,
I'd have to ask you some questions.
Let me ask you this.

1626
01:38:05.691 --> 01:38:08.000
Do you feel she has the potential?

1627
01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:13.550
That's what that would be.
My number one thing

1628
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:19.030
is,
all right,
this is how I would do it.
Right?
Fuck this.
All right.
Now,

1629
01:38:19.090 --> 01:38:22.490
now back on track.
This is what I would do.
First thing I would do is I would,

1630
01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:26.660
I would see if she has the potential.
All right.
If she's a good kisser,

1631
01:38:26.770 --> 01:38:29.480
if she has a good touch,
if when you're banging her,

1632
01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:33.170
you don't feel like you're fucking riding in a god did the back of a delivery

1633
01:38:33.171 --> 01:38:34.004
truck.

1634
01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:36.313
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1635
01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:40.330
<v 9>The rhythms there,
if she has is she has the basic tools.</v>

1636
01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:44.320
All right?
Because some people,
they just don't,
they,

1637
01:38:44.321 --> 01:38:48.160
they're not blessed with the touch then that good kissers you know,

1638
01:38:48.161 --> 01:38:50.590
and a lot of females,
not a lot,
but you know enough are,

1639
01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:51.790
that's another thing they never bring up.

1640
01:38:51.791 --> 01:38:54.520
They always talk about how guys don't know shit and bed and you just blah,
blah,

1641
01:38:54.521 --> 01:38:58.630
blah,
blah.
But there's a lot of women out there who they don't know shit either.

1642
01:38:59.710 --> 01:39:02.020
Not saying they're bad or whatever,
but in some of them just,

1643
01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:07.090
I just never going to be good.
So if you feel she has the potential then,

1644
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:08.200
then there's hope.

1645
01:39:08.830 --> 01:39:13.830
So what you have to do is you have to basically what I used to tell my friends,

1646
01:39:14.441 --> 01:39:19.080
we used to joke around,
just say you got to tap into her inner whore.
All right?

1647
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:23.800
And the visit a couple of ways to do it.
One of them.

1648
01:39:24.370 --> 01:39:25.660
And it's very delicate dude.

1649
01:39:25.661 --> 01:39:28.660
It's like one of those fucking action movies where you'd sit in there trying to

1650
01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:34.180
clip the right fucking wire as it's,
you know,
eight seconds left.
Um,

1651
01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:37.390
there's a couple of ways you go about it.

1652
01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:38.613
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1653
01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:43.560
<v 9>Uh,
one of the ways is,
well first of all,
this does a couple of rules.</v>

1654
01:39:43.561 --> 01:39:44.394
One,

1655
01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:49.320
as she's trying to open up with you sexually or whatever,

1656
01:39:49.530 --> 01:39:53.850
don't ever judge anything that she wants to,
to uh,

1657
01:39:53.851 --> 01:39:58.851
try and don't ever make fun of anything that she said it bed.

1658
01:39:58.891 --> 01:40:02.220
If she says some dumb shit,
which she's probably gonna say,

1659
01:40:02.221 --> 01:40:05.760
cause you sound like you're way more experienced if she's trying to talk dirty

1660
01:40:05.761 --> 01:40:10.590
for the first fucking time and she says some dumb shit,
do not laugh.

1661
01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:15.510
Simply turn her around and doggy style and then you get your laugh out.

1662
01:40:15.810 --> 01:40:16.643
<v 8>All right,</v>

1663
01:40:19.150 --> 01:40:20.920
<v 9>you got to do the quad,
but don't ever do that.</v>

1664
01:40:20.921 --> 01:40:25.921
That is like someone is never more vulnerable than in that specialty of female.

1665
01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:28.930
You can't,
you can't do that.
And then what she,
I would,

1666
01:40:28.931 --> 01:40:33.931
I would do is I would just basically figure out what she's into trying to figure

1667
01:40:34.271 --> 01:40:38.140
out what some of her fantasies are.
All right.
So that,

1668
01:40:38.141 --> 01:40:39.250
that's how I would start it.

1669
01:40:39.251 --> 01:40:42.790
Find out what some of her fantasies are and you start getting her down that
road.

1670
01:40:42.791 --> 01:40:47.110
And then as you're going down that road and you're not judging her and you're

1671
01:40:47.111 --> 01:40:51.100
not making fun of any,
you just supportive as she goes down that fucking road.

1672
01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:56.320
Um,
then she'll gain confidence and then Dan,

1673
01:40:56.321 --> 01:40:57.520
hopefully that'll happen.

1674
01:40:57.521 --> 01:41:00.520
And one of the ways to kind of lead her down the road is try to tell us some of

1675
01:41:00.521 --> 01:41:02.620
the shit that you're into that you've never done with her.

1676
01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:04.780
Then I'll go all the way down to the road.
You know,

1677
01:41:04.781 --> 01:41:06.820
your five years of fucking horrific shit.

1678
01:41:06.821 --> 01:41:11.821
You did just always be a couple of paces out in front of whatever sexual shit

1679
01:41:12.431 --> 01:41:13.990
that she admitted that she wanted to do.

1680
01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:18.190
So that way her shit doesn't seem as freaky because it's a couple of steps

1681
01:41:18.191 --> 01:41:22.810
behind you,
but you don't completely freak her the fuck out by,
you know,

1682
01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.640
talking about some German porn shit.
All right,
so that,
that's what,

1683
01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:30.400
uh,
that's what I would do.
All right.

1684
01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:33.970
And that's what I have been doing throughout the years.
Nia,

1685
01:41:34.570 --> 01:41:37.060
look who just walked in.
Somebody actually asked your advice

1686
01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:44.740
because you were working out.
Do you want to do this?
Okay.

1687
01:41:45.110 --> 01:41:47.810
All right.
You know,
what do I have?
I don't have my other microphone,

1688
01:41:47.811 --> 01:41:50.410
so we actually have to be over here and let me ask you this shit real quickly.

1689
01:41:50.590 --> 01:41:53.380
I'll give you the basic overview.
All right.
There was a guy,
right?

1690
01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:57.190
He sees this girl,
they like each other.
The heist did the college sweethearts.

1691
01:41:57.730 --> 01:42:01.690
Everything about her,
um,
was,
was great.

1692
01:42:02.230 --> 01:42:05.290
They have fun too.
She's knee is a little under the weather here.
All right.

1693
01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:09.490
Are fucking allergies are kicking up.
Let me hear your voice.
Say Hello.
Hello

1694
01:42:11.710 --> 01:42:14.970
and you worked out what a fucking trooper.
All right.
Real quick.
Yeah,

1695
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:19.750
so everything hanging out,
they'd laughed each at each other's jokes.

1696
01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:23.110
The whole shit was perfect.
But then they went to different medical schools.

1697
01:42:23.490 --> 01:42:26.670
All right.
So they broke up for a while.
And during the,
you know,
the five years,

1698
01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:30.310
I guess this guy cheated a lot when he was with her and now five years have gone

1699
01:42:30.311 --> 01:42:32.980
by,
he got his free cow.
Uh,

1700
01:42:34.350 --> 01:42:37.480
if you saw the look of disgust on her face,
he did all this shit.

1701
01:42:37.570 --> 01:42:39.730
So now he's back together with her.
All right.

1702
01:42:39.731 --> 01:42:42.130
And he was kind of hoping like as a sex was kind of lame,

1703
01:42:42.190 --> 01:42:46.240
like when he was with her missionary position,
very like if you like,

1704
01:42:46.241 --> 01:42:49.990
if you're going to make like a,
like a high school video on how to have sex,

1705
01:42:49.991 --> 01:42:52.180
the mail takes out his penis.
What aroused?

1706
01:42:52.510 --> 01:42:55.090
Like they were having that kind of sex and no blow jobs whatsoever.

1707
01:42:55.780 --> 01:43:00.430
So now he's gotten back together with her.
He wants to be serious.

1708
01:43:00.970 --> 01:43:01.803
He's gotten all this,

1709
01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:04.690
hopefully all this bullshit out and now he's back with their,

1710
01:43:04.691 --> 01:43:08.620
and the sex is basically the same.
Now there's a couple of blow jobs.

1711
01:43:08.621 --> 01:43:13.621
So he's wondering how does he get her to tap into her inner whore?

1712
01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:20.600
Should he pursue that he pursue this relationship?

1713
01:43:21.431 --> 01:43:25.570
Like how,
okay.
How does a guy do that?
Like how,

1714
01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:29.620
like I said,
basically how I do it.
Oh,
she's already just saying,
give me the mic.

1715
01:43:29.621 --> 01:43:32.950
All right,
go ahead.
Uh,
well,
first of all,

1716
01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:35.720
just because you enjoy sex in different ways,

1717
01:43:35.721 --> 01:43:38.620
does it make you a horse so she doesn't have to tap into our inner whore?

1718
01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:42.340
Just more freedom.
It's actually,
has he tried to talk?

1719
01:43:42.370 --> 01:43:44.980
You don't need to clarify it.
Okay.
I'm not saying she's a whore.

1720
01:43:44.981 --> 01:43:48.220
We understand this.
Okay.
I felt the need to clarify

1721
01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:52.040
to put your fist in the air for women right now.

1722
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:56.390
<v 6>Okay.
Uh,
did he try to talk to her about this before and she just ignored it?</v>

1723
01:43:56.450 --> 01:43:58.760
I don't think he's talked to her about it yet.
So it's,
you know,
it's,

1724
01:43:58.761 --> 01:44:01.520
it's the first step is that he's got to talk to her.
That's what I said.

1725
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:02.061
Look at that.

1726
01:44:02.061 --> 01:44:06.440
Why don't we switch it up a little bit and I wonder why she didn't give him blow

1727
01:44:06.441 --> 01:44:09.830
jobs.
Maybe she just doesn't like giving gloves out.
Maybe she doesn't know how,

1728
01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:14.180
but it could be fun to explore together.
So he should,
yeah,

1729
01:44:14.181 --> 01:44:16.930
you should ask her about it.
Just saying,
okay,
this especially what I said.
Yeah.

1730
01:44:16.970 --> 01:44:20.210
You know what's the worst is when women say they can't do it cause they have TMJ

1731
01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:24.890
and it's like what?
They don't like to do it.
Some people don't like to do it,

1732
01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:28.310
you know,
it's not,
it's not that great for the other person,

1733
01:44:28.311 --> 01:44:29.690
but it's like some people don't like it.

1734
01:44:29.690 --> 01:44:31.250
Some guys don't like to go down on girls.

1735
01:44:31.550 --> 01:44:34.850
Some girls don't like to go down and dies.
It's just a preference thing.
Okay.

1736
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:37.490
All right.
So you basically said what?
I said,

1737
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:39.960
I thought you wouldn't come in here with some soda.
Yeah.

1738
01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:42.770
Does that make you feel bad?
No,
but I just,
yeah,

1739
01:44:42.771 --> 01:44:46.970
I thought I would be coming at it in a different,
more rational,
sensitive way.

1740
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:50.000
But she said the same thing,
Huh?
Yeah,
but not as sensitively.

1741
01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:54.900
I said all the Horse Shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah,

1742
01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:58.200
that's,
I don't know what I thought that it was going to continue.

1743
01:44:58.290 --> 01:45:00.290
I don't mean it like that.
I just said in a mean way.

1744
01:45:00.291 --> 01:45:02.850
Can we come over here and get a hug?
Give a hug.
Um,

1745
01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:06.660
I'm coming towards the end of the,
uh,
the podcast.
All right.
All right.

1746
01:45:06.710 --> 01:45:09.020
There you go.
When I get Outta here,
cause you've been,
you've been,

1747
01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:13.160
you've been more than helpful.
All right.
She just gave me the finger.

1748
01:45:13.610 --> 01:45:14.443
Now you know what it is yet,

1749
01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:18.530
whenever you're on the podcast and then the podcast segment ends.

1750
01:45:18.531 --> 01:45:21.590
I don't know how to smoothly transition you out of here because we don't go to

1751
01:45:21.591 --> 01:45:26.300
commercial.
Why don't I just go ladies and gentleman?
Nay.
Nia,
everybody.

1752
01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:31.220
Thanks so much.
Thank you so much Neal.
See you next time.

1753
01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:36.560
See you next time.
You were great.
And now what the fuck just happened to Mike?

1754
01:45:37.730 --> 01:45:38.780
I hate computers.

1755
01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:42.380
It just signed me off and I was on a nice little fucking roll here

1756
01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:46.880
and now I can't.
I can't get back into my,
my,
my fucking,

1757
01:45:48.050 --> 01:45:48.400
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1758
01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:50.750
<v 6>How is this easier?
People I want,
I want people to,</v>

1759
01:45:51.670 --> 01:45:55.990
now I have to go into my fucking,
my stupid apple works.
All right.
Here I am.

1760
01:45:56.590 --> 01:45:57.980
Fucking,
all right.

1761
01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:01.000
I'm going to read one more of these and that's going to be the podcast for this

1762
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.870
week.
All right.
Uh,
hey bill,
I need an outside perspective.

1763
01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:09.280
My wife left me a year and a half ago to go blow college guys and spend her

1764
01:46:09.281 --> 01:46:12.340
newly raise salary on clothes and purses.

1765
01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:13.600
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1766
01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:17.110
<v 6>not kidding.
That's what she did.
After nine years and two kids,</v>

1767
01:46:17.111 --> 01:46:21.250
I found out that she had two short affairs after each kid was born.

1768
01:46:21.550 --> 01:46:26.550
Then left me with our five month old baby and two year old I had been raising

1769
01:46:28.061 --> 01:46:31.390
without her.
Anyways,
Jesus,
Oh gee,

1770
01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:33.760
I'm a year later,

1771
01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:37.240
she finally started trying to share custody.

1772
01:46:37.241 --> 01:46:41.050
She didn't have her hit her half of daycare.
I'm sorry.

1773
01:46:41.051 --> 01:46:43.600
People every once in a while I go back to my bad reading habits.

1774
01:46:43.601 --> 01:46:47.650
Let me just take a breath here.
Step back,
focus.
All right.
A year later,

1775
01:46:47.651 --> 01:46:51.180
she finally started trying to custody.
Okay.
So after she's gone up,

1776
01:46:51.181 --> 01:46:56.181
she left him with two kids to go blow college guys and spend all her money.

1777
01:46:56.341 --> 01:47:00.480
She just got on our newly higher salary.
I'm a year later,

1778
01:47:00.481 --> 01:47:05.400
she finally started trying to share custody.
She didn't have her half of daycare,

1779
01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:09.870
um,
bill for a few months,
even though she doubles my income.

1780
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:11.670
So I told her she could pay me back.

1781
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:15.150
Now the current gets her tax return and tells me to fuck off.

1782
01:47:15.151 --> 01:47:16.410
She's not repaying me.

1783
01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:20.880
She's going to get a car to replace the one she totaled in a Dui.

1784
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:23.130
Jesus,
where did you meet this winter?

1785
01:47:23.610 --> 01:47:27.480
I'm pissed off and can't blast her in the jaw.
So what do I do?

1786
01:47:27.930 --> 01:47:32.280
I'm thinking of hiring a crack head to spray paint dead beat on her fucking car

1787
01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:34.420
for one asshole to another.
Thanks bill.

1788
01:47:34.421 --> 01:47:38.160
The podcast and all three cds of helped me through a lot of tough shit by

1789
01:47:38.161 --> 01:47:40.920
laughing off the retarded shit that this cut does.

1790
01:47:41.690 --> 01:47:42.523
<v 10>MMM.</v>

1791
01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:48.580
<v 6>All right,
dude.
Uh,
yeah.
You,
you picked a winner here.
This is like,</v>

1792
01:47:48.581 --> 01:47:53.360
this is one of these ones that you should ask Dr drew about.
Um,

1793
01:47:54.250 --> 01:47:57.250
who's amazing and he would hit his half court shot and tell you exactly what's

1794
01:47:57.251 --> 01:47:58.084
going on.
This,

1795
01:47:58.090 --> 01:48:02.050
there's something going on with her where she has affairs right after she has

1796
01:48:02.290 --> 01:48:06.220
kids.
I don't know what that is,
but that's triggering something inside of her.

1797
01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:07.720
Um,

1798
01:48:08.590 --> 01:48:12.940
I don't know if she gets freaked out with the level of responsibility and she

1799
01:48:12.941 --> 01:48:16.600
wants to,
I dunno,
do a bunch get it go.

1800
01:48:16.601 --> 01:48:21.540
So her oats and a female fucking way failing.
Like I dunno,
you know,

1801
01:48:21.541 --> 01:48:24.700
some,
sometimes women have babies and then they had that postpartum depression.

1802
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:29.940
She has some sort of postpartum like you know,

1803
01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:34.570
hedonism that she just goes out and just turns into the fuck fest 2011.

1804
01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:39.710
So what you have there,
do you have damaged goods?

1805
01:48:39.711 --> 01:48:43.070
There's no way you can ever fucking trust her again.
You got two kids.
So,

1806
01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:48.050
um,
don't do anything to her.
All right.

1807
01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:53.030
This is like in sports where when somebody comes up and slashes,
Yah.

1808
01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:54.450
<v 10>Yeah,</v>

1809
01:48:54.450 --> 01:48:56.760
<v 6>the ref never sees it.
But when you retaliate,</v>

1810
01:48:56.761 --> 01:48:59.070
you always end up getting the fucking five minute major.

1811
01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:01.680
This is what's going to happen.
She's going to do all this dumb shit.

1812
01:49:01.681 --> 01:49:04.380
You're going to hire people to do stuff or I know you're not going to literally

1813
01:49:04.381 --> 01:49:04.711
do that,

1814
01:49:04.711 --> 01:49:09.480
but you can try to exact some sort of revenge and I dunno if the decent person

1815
01:49:09.481 --> 01:49:11.860
always seems to get caught.
So I would avoid doing that.

1816
01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:13.460
<v 10>Okay,</v>

1817
01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:16.640
<v 6>this is how you get your event is</v>

1818
01:49:18.170 --> 01:49:21.800
I would just focus on being a great dad for those two kids.
In all honesty,

1819
01:49:21.890 --> 01:49:24.740
I know that's a ton of work and it's easy for me to say when I don't have any

1820
01:49:24.741 --> 01:49:29.741
kids and I never ever bad mouth their mother.

1821
01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:31.390
<v 10>Okay</v>

1822
01:49:31.390 --> 01:49:33.370
<v 6>to them.
Never do that.
You know,</v>

1823
01:49:33.580 --> 01:49:37.660
have a buddy of yours where you can just vent and just talk about what a cunt

1824
01:49:37.661 --> 01:49:42.070
she is as you're punching the bar but never do it in front of your kids cause

1825
01:49:42.071 --> 01:49:43.090
that's still their mother.

1826
01:49:44.170 --> 01:49:48.940
Eventually they'll figure out what an irresponsible whore she is.

1827
01:49:49.690 --> 01:49:50.500
And this is going to be,

1828
01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:55.500
that's going to be your great payback is in that moment,

1829
01:49:55.630 --> 01:49:59.440
not only are they going to realize what an irresponsible horror their mother is,

1830
01:50:00.010 --> 01:50:03.430
is they're going to realize what a great dad they have and a,

1831
01:50:03.431 --> 01:50:07.090
which is obviously going to be priceless.
Um,

1832
01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:12.640
and in the meantime,
I would ask myself is if this,
this,

1833
01:50:12.850 --> 01:50:13.750
this lady,

1834
01:50:13.751 --> 01:50:17.530
if this is the kind of per dev you met a girl like this a number of times,

1835
01:50:17.531 --> 01:50:20.710
is it's just bad luck or do like every woman,

1836
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:24.460
every woman that you've dated is like this.
Because if that is the case,

1837
01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:27.530
there's something about these kinds of women that you're attracted to.
And,

1838
01:50:27.850 --> 01:50:31.420
and as I've always used that analogy,
you keep fishing in the same poisoned pond.

1839
01:50:32.260 --> 01:50:36.550
Uh,
I think because you got two kids and you want to go out and go meet a winter,

1840
01:50:36.551 --> 01:50:41.140
I go out to that debt shit,
where are you going to meet a decent girl?
Go out,

1841
01:50:41.141 --> 01:50:44.890
go take a cooking class.
I just gave on Nia for birthday.

1842
01:50:44.891 --> 01:50:48.370
A fucking almost said Goddamn year ago.
She finally got around to it,

1843
01:50:48.371 --> 01:50:51.700
a couple of gourmet cooking classes and she went there and it's kind of like a

1844
01:50:51.701 --> 01:50:55.150
little scene,
you know,
people bring wine in your cooking.

1845
01:50:55.151 --> 01:50:57.520
There's all that fucking people,
a taste and shit.

1846
01:50:57.521 --> 01:51:02.320
All the senses are going that pussies getting wet in the room.
You go in there,

1847
01:51:02.321 --> 01:51:05.650
you fucking knock a couple out or whatever.
Join a softball league.

1848
01:51:05.651 --> 01:51:10.240
I don't know what all those,
a lot of boozing was softball,
you know,

1849
01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:12.390
probably going to get some bloated whore there.

1850
01:51:12.391 --> 01:51:13.570
You might want to stay away from that.

1851
01:51:13.870 --> 01:51:16.870
Maybe that's where you go to vent about what a fucking whore you're wife is.

1852
01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:20.420
But Dude,
you know what?
You're a great fucking guy.
You're doing the right thing.

1853
01:51:20.421 --> 01:51:23.050
You sticking with your kids and your even supporting her,

1854
01:51:23.051 --> 01:51:26.650
even though she's making more fucking money.
She's a loser.
All right?

1855
01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:31.180
She's a fucking loser and she's out of your life and your kids will be 18 one

1856
01:51:31.181 --> 01:51:35.410
day and then this bitch will be out of your life.
So who gives a fuck?
All right.

1857
01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:39.100
In the meantime.
Yeah,
focus on being a good dad.

1858
01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:42.370
Get yourself in great shape.
I don't know.

1859
01:51:42.371 --> 01:51:46.030
Find some fucking way to do something social.
Go meet a great woman.

1860
01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:49.360
I can't say there's plenty of great women out there.
It's just like guys,

1861
01:51:50.290 --> 01:51:55.270
they're out there.
Go find one and just ask them during the day,

1862
01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:59.940
just be like,
by the way,
are you a,
are you an irresponsible whore?
Because I,

1863
01:51:59.941 --> 01:52:03.130
I really just got out of relationship with an irresponsible whore and I'm not

1864
01:52:03.131 --> 01:52:06.040
trying to try and do that and talk about cheating.

1865
01:52:06.070 --> 01:52:09.400
Ask if they ever cheated on somebody is another great question to ask.

1866
01:52:09.401 --> 01:52:12.130
Ask if their parents are still together.
That's a great one to ask.

1867
01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:14.800
The parents are still together.
If they get along with their parents,

1868
01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:18.770
they come from a strong background.
That's a good one to ask a man.

1869
01:52:18.771 --> 01:52:21.130
That's a good place to start off and that's it.

1870
01:52:21.131 --> 01:52:24.610
I'm done trying to be doctor bill here for the week.
Um,

1871
01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:28.630
our and six minute podcasts.
Once again,
I'm going to be done.
The

1872
01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:31.100
<v 9>Catalina jazz club,
um,</v>

1873
01:52:31.370 --> 01:52:34.760
doing a benefit for all those people out there in Japan,

1874
01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:40.310
fellow human beings who also live on a fault line just like I do.
Um,

1875
01:52:40.311 --> 01:52:42.470
so,
uh,
hopefully somebody out there,

1876
01:52:42.471 --> 01:52:45.590
we'll do a fucking comedy show for when La falls into the ocean,

1877
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:49.490
so I'm paying it forward.
All right,
so come on down.

1878
01:52:49.491 --> 01:52:51.770
All the proceeds will go out to help the victims of that.

1879
01:52:51.771 --> 01:52:55.450
This Catalina Jazz club down on Sunset Boulevard,
um,

1880
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:57.530
I just tweeted about it,
uh,

1881
01:52:57.740 --> 01:53:02.150
at [inaudible] dot com I think that's it.
Uh,
we got all the youtube videos.

1882
01:53:02.151 --> 01:53:04.190
It didn't get a chance to describe youtube videos this week,

1883
01:53:04.191 --> 01:53:07.220
but they're fucking hilarious.
Uh,

1884
01:53:07.670 --> 01:53:12.080
some guy has a potato gun that he shoots a bunch of pubes onto a passed out guy.

1885
01:53:12.110 --> 01:53:16.280
That's one of them and it just goes from there.
It just goes from there.

1886
01:53:16.281 --> 01:53:18.470
So I'll go to the FM podcast to watch all that.

1887
01:53:18.650 --> 01:53:23.420
If you want to see the pictures of the tower theater and me working with Joe to

1888
01:53:23.421 --> 01:53:27.170
Rosa,
the teen idol sensation from the opiate Anthony Program.

1889
01:53:27.171 --> 01:53:30.160
I have all of those and I have a picture of that fucking chicken wings sitting

1890
01:53:30.170 --> 01:53:33.890
on my window sill.
Just in case you'd think I was making it up.
Fucka uh,

1891
01:53:33.891 --> 01:53:35.150
that's it.
Everybody have a great week.

1892
01:53:35.151 --> 01:53:38.960
Go Fuck yourself and I'll talk to you next week.
Oh wait,
I don't hang up.

1893
01:53:38.961 --> 01:53:40.580
Don't hang up.
I almost forgot.

1894
01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:44.570
I almost forgot I told you that I was going to bring in the,
uh,

1895
01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:49.580
the outtake from a,
my failed attempt at the podcast last week.

1896
01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:50.960
This is like a special track.

1897
01:53:50.961 --> 01:53:55.910
Remember that back in the day when you'd buy like a CD and they'd say they'd be

1898
01:53:55.911 --> 01:53:56.990
like 15 songs,

1899
01:53:56.991 --> 01:54:01.010
but it would say 16 tracks and they would just let the tape run and run and run

1900
01:54:01.011 --> 01:54:04.520
and run.
And then you'd,
you'd find the A,
that little gem at the end.

1901
01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:09.110
I think this is,
this is the podcast version cause I already signed off.
Um,

1902
01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:10.430
all right,
just to set this up,

1903
01:54:10.431 --> 01:54:15.431
this was me last night after getting like four hours sleep flying across this

1904
01:54:15.561 --> 01:54:20.561
country and then watching the math and I'm trying to tell that Sheridan story.

1905
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:25.160
And up until this point,
it just had not been funny.

1906
01:54:25.730 --> 01:54:28.720
And I think I met the part of the story with a guy,
uh,

1907
01:54:28.730 --> 01:54:32.720
was bringing the new table to,
to replace the broken table in.

1908
01:54:33.290 --> 01:54:37.550
And a,
I was trying to explain it in a funny way.
It wasn't funny and I just,

1909
01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:42.890
I just fucking tapped out.
Uh,
and this is the clip.
Hope you enjoy it.

1910
01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:43.820
I'll talk to you next week.

1911
01:54:45.650 --> 01:54:48.300
<v 6>And I was like,
Jesus Christ.
Then I heard an argument</v>

1912
01:54:49.970 --> 01:54:52.880
between a man and a woman as I was walking back downstairs,

1913
01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:55.460
and later on that night when I came back from my Gig,

1914
01:54:55.850 --> 01:55:00.430
there was a fucking half eaten chicken wing sitting on the window sill.

1915
01:55:00.490 --> 01:55:02.060
My Room.
I got a picture of it.

1916
01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:05.273
<v 1>You know,</v>

1917
01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:09.240
<v 6>I actually,
you know something,
when I knew,
I knew something was up,</v>

1918
01:55:09.241 --> 01:55:13.710
when I went to check into my room,
ah,

1919
01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:17.290
there was a knock at my door five seconds later and the guy goes,
oh,
hey.

1920
01:55:17.670 --> 01:55:20.230
And he's got this big table.
I'm like,
dude,
you got the wrong room.

1921
01:55:20.231 --> 01:55:23.230
I didn't order a table.
He said,
no,
no,
no.
I said,
this,

1922
01:55:23.231 --> 01:55:27.310
this table belongs in your room.
He goes,
somebody broke it here last night,

1923
01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:31.000
and I was like,
Jesus,
what was their party here at something?
He was like,
yeah,

1924
01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:32.531
I go,
well,

1925
01:55:32.531 --> 01:55:37.370
did you fumigate the place or is it just all judges and coke residue when here?

1926
01:55:37.380 --> 01:55:38.380
And he just laughed,

1927
01:55:39.130 --> 01:55:44.130
shook his head and left and that's when my ass knew was in a ghetto

1928
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:48.430
<v 4>ass mother.
Fucking Sheridan baby is part.</v>
