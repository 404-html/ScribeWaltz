00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.100
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:06.240
It's bill burr and it's a Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.050
may the sixth,
may the sixth.
Did you read,

4
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:13.830
did you read your forecast for the day?
What does it say?

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.680
What is that shit called?
Astrology.

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.580
Why don't we look up old fucking astrology right now?
You know what?

7
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:24.180
It's raining out here in Los Angeles.
Everybody always freaks out.

8
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.350
Oh my God,
it's Ray.
I can't drive it.
This stuff.

9
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.020
Um Oh,
here's the astrology and who we have on his star of the day.

10
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:36.850
Who Will it be?
George Clooney.
Abbott.
Dentally.

11
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.770
He's a tourist and he was born today,
May 6th,

12
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.030
1961 happy birthday to George Clooney.
Who turns 52 today.

13
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.750
Um,
what kind of an asshole?

14
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.660
I'll tell you what kind of an asshole looks this shit up.

15
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.630
Adolf Hitler and thank God he did.

16
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.060
Maybe if he didn't have his head up in the stats,

17
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.120
the white at one that fucking war.
Right?
And I'll tell you right now,

18
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:06.180
most of us wouldn't be here,
including myself.

19
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.180
Do you think dead beady little shark?
I'd fucking

20
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.980
Amy Schumer Cheek Psycho would fucking put up with my red edit face walking

21
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:19.950
around.
I don't think he would.
I don't think he would.

22
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.560
I think he'd look at me and go now.

23
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.390
Oh Shit.
Um,

24
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.820
I drank like a fucking idiot late yesterday.
I was going so well.
Everybody,

25
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.720
when I was fighting that demon,
that little whore,

26
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:42.110
that little harlot that I like to call alcoholism,

27
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.510
I was doing so great by great.

28
00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:47.660
What I meant was I was actually working out in the morning before I went out and

29
00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:51.480
got shit faced.
That's how I fucking wrestle that demon to the ground high.

30
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:54.580
You're like,
got shit.
Huh?
Empty calories.
Of course you have to

31
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.340
tap out.
Tap Out.
Um,
no.
I've been doing great.

32
00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:02.720
I've been doing this stairs.

33
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.280
This is set of stairs down the fucking street.

34
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.570
And I know what most people see.
Most people drive by.
They see a set of stairs,

35
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.100
but not all freckle face here.
You know what I see,
I see a free gym.

36
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.270
So I had been going up and down these fucking things.
All right,

37
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.331
well there's,

38
00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:29.440
there's four sets of stairs and I'm doing them with the Cleveland Zone,

39
00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:32.380
Jason Law head.
All right,
there's four sets of stairs.

40
00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:34.570
So we're looking at it like a basketball game.
All right?

41
00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:38.500
The first set of stairs is the first quarter,
second stairs,
second quarter.

42
00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:41.650
You get the idea,
right?
Something to take our mind off.

43
00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:44.950
The fact that we're a couple of booze hound is trying to drag a fucking drunk

44
00:02:44.951 --> 00:02:49.900
ass is hung over ass is up the stairs.
So you basically,
you go up,

45
00:02:49.901 --> 00:02:53.710
down,
up,
that's the first quarter.
Then the second quarter is a short one.

46
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.810
So that one you got to run,

47
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.950
you're trying to run him out of the building or if you walk at that,
uh,
you know,

48
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.580
you blew a fucking eight point lead right up,
down,
up,
and then we fucking,
uh,

49
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.500
the last two a brutal up,
down,
up and down,
up,
down,
up,

50
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.600
and then you walk all the way around,
you loop around,

51
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:13.600
and then you've got the last two.
When you go up,
down,
up,
up,
down,
up,

52
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.680
and that's fucking overtime and you basically want to kill yourself afterwards.

53
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:20.230
But I've got to tell you something,
you know,

54
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:25.150
if you do that shit and you come home and you resist the urge to get a breakfast

55
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:28.960
burrito or whatever the fuck it is you do and your neck of the woods,

56
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:33.160
if you just have a few,
if you just sit there and you force yourself to eat,

57
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:38.100
like you're in a prison camp,
the weight will come off.
Um,

58
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.720
why am I talking about this shit?
Yeah,

59
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.550
I'm back to having my banana for breakfast.

60
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.180
Although if I do that fucking workout,
I do a,

61
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.200
I'll have the oatmeal and a banana.
That's what I do.

62
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.510
If you guys were ever wondering what my beauty secrets are,

63
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.220
if you ever wondered how it is that I keep the glow,

64
00:03:57.221 --> 00:04:00.910
how I keep the light in my eye,
when I walk into a room,

65
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.800
everybody just goes,
wow,

66
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.380
who is that gentleman and what are his ideas that I can invest in?
Um,

67
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.510
that's what it is right there.
Up,
down,
up on the fucking stairs,

68
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.230
a bowl of oatmeal with nothing else in it.
Maybe a couple of bananas,

69
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.940
slices of Banana.
And that's it.
You eat like you're in some bamboo cage,

70
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.300
treading water with a couple of rats.
All right?

71
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.880
That's what you have to do.

72
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.940
And your fucking forties if you don't want to end up with one of those Sammy

73
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.900
Hagar Torsos you know we just still trying to wear the t shirt and you look okay

74
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:38.380
straight on,
as long as it's black.
But when you turned to the side,

75
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.710
he just got all that extra fucking meat,
you know,

76
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.350
you gotta be able to put your hand down.

77
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.640
It'd be able to get your thumb to the back and your fingers to the front.

78
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.120
All right?
When your whole hand can just be on the side.
You got,
you got,

79
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.920
you got to shave down that ham.
All right?
So anyways,

80
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.790
that's what I'm trying to do.
I'm trying to shave it down.

81
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.420
I was at my fight and fuck your weight and like an asshole.

82
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.280
They put on like 13 pounds being a fucking Goddamn waffle.

83
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.280
Leeton fucking moron.
So now look what I have to do.

84
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:12.130
I gotta eat like a fucking God.
Like I mean,

85
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.540
oh God damn a pow camp.
Why do I do that to myself?

86
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.460
How many fucking times,
Bill,
are you going to get down to your way and be like,

87
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.220
oh,
that's great.
You know what?
It's celebration.

88
00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:27.430
I'm going to have a cheeseburger and some ice cream and go right back to the tub

89
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:30.700
of fucking Shit I was before.
I'm sick of it.
I hate myself.

90
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:35.140
I'm sick of that cycle.
Um,
whatever.

91
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:39.460
So it's raining out here,
which is great because the hills are on fire.

92
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.560
The hills are on fire out here,

93
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:46.450
which are actually a phenomenal part of nature out here.
Um,

94
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.890
if human beings weren't living in the hills,
it would be great.

95
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.040
We could all just sit back and sort of enjoy nature doing what it does.

96
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.460
Hills catch on fire.
I've,
I've gone through this before,
right?
Basically,

97
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.540
this is how the weather works out here.
Um,
it rains,

98
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.800
you used to be January and February now like fucking rains in December.

99
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.140
It's like earlier,
you know,

100
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.710
and fuck all you people in Minnesota okay with you.
Oh my God,

101
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:13.640
it's snowing in May.

102
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.320
Why are you acting like you didn't just put away your mittens?
Okay.

103
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.300
You live in Minnesota,
you know what you signed up for?

104
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.620
What'd you think you were going to be doing in May?
Waterski oh,

105
00:06:26.621 --> 00:06:31.400
it would have been nice.
Um,
46 fucking inches.

106
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:33.230
And everybody's out there acting like,
you know,

107
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.300
they're acting like it's snowing in May.
I wish I could have put on Fox News.

108
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.170
I know they were like global warming.
Huh?
Um,

109
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.800
fuck the polar ice caps melting.
It's snowing in Minnesota in May.

110
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.350
Let's see what the liberals have to say about this.
Is that a polar bear?
Um,

111
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.280
so anyways,
the fucking hills were on fire.
We drove,
we drove out to a,
we drove,

112
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.280
me and La had did a Chumash casino.

113
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.600
Somebody told me Chumash means number five in a native American.

114
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.870
I have no idea.
I don't know if it's the name of their tribe.
You know,

115
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.720
if they still on the hills out here when they were on fire and yelled at the

116
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:22.040
Apaches,
you know,
Chumash mother fuckers.
I don't know if they said that.

117
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.353
I have no idea.

118
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.050
Well if they just put five fingers in the air and that meant to gather up,

119
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.400
gather up,
we're going to go get some squat pussy tonight.

120
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.480
I have no idea what it meant,

121
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.210
but all I know is I went out there and I had a great fucking time,

122
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:40.130
but we're driving out there and I know you Californians are used to this shit,

123
00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:43.820
but we're just driving out there and all of a sudden you just come over the hill

124
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.980
on the highway and you look in the distance and there's an entire hill that is

125
00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:52.510
just completely can't say completely engulfed in flames.

126
00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:57.230
It's just walls of fire working its way up the hill.

127
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.240
And um,
you just sort of drive by it taking video,

128
00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:04.460
not paying attention to where you're going.
Like I did.

129
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.420
I'll try and send you some of the video.
Um,
gle,

130
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.400
you're really going to try,
how are you going to try what?

131
00:08:11.401 --> 00:08:13.650
Fucking select it and hit send.

132
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.910
I'm going to send the video.
I'll have the video.
Okay.
Anyways,

133
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.163
um,

134
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.550
and I actually went home the next day and I was watching these firefighters on

135
00:08:26.551 --> 00:08:30.060
the fucking news.
If you get a chance,
go on youtube.

136
00:08:30.061 --> 00:08:33.650
Maybe there's some clips out there watching these guys fight the fires.
It's,

137
00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:35.820
it's unbelievable.
First of all,

138
00:08:35.821 --> 00:08:40.821
it's like 85 fucking degrees out without the hill being on fire and like seven

139
00:08:41.251 --> 00:08:45.870
of them walk up this hill.
Here I am bragging about doing these stairs up,
down,

140
00:08:45.871 --> 00:08:50.280
up,
down.
These guys have like a fucking,
you know,
60,
70 pounds worth of equipment,

141
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.570
that heavy rain coat and they'd just walk it up this hill.
Like it's nothing.

142
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.840
They get up there.
I noticed one guy's got the red helmet.
He's leading the way.

143
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:02.790
So evidently he's the fucking chief.

144
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.570
So they're standing right next to this wall of fire and he just Kinda,
yeah,
it,

145
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:09.810
it's so bad at that,
that,
and then these fucking guys.

146
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:11.340
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

147
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.850
<v 0>They,
they just get after it to guys of the giant fucking chain saws.</v>

148
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.210
They start cutting away the brush.
The other guys are grabbing the brush,

149
00:09:19.211 --> 00:09:21.040
thrown it in the opposite direction.

150
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.410
<v 2>Okay.</v>

151
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.180
<v 0>Of the fire.</v>

152
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.310
Next thing you know there's a trail and they've established a perimeter,

153
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.850
you know,
and the fire is like,
wait a minute,
what the fuck happened?

154
00:09:30.851 --> 00:09:33.880
I thought everything was all good.
And they said,
I don't think so.
Fire.

155
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.960
Why don't you just sit there and either go in the other direction over shit.

156
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:40.870
You already burned out or just sadly fucking fade away like a child star.

157
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.200
That's exactly what they did.
I watched him save people's houses.

158
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:45.580
They're unbelievable.

159
00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:49.600
When it was in that moment that I realized I could never be a firefighter,

160
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.310
I don't have what it takes.

161
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:52.750
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

162
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.071
<v 0>I don't,</v>

163
00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:56.890
I have the wrong pigment to be walking up that fucking hill with all of that

164
00:09:56.891 --> 00:09:57.724
shit on.
You know,

165
00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:01.540
I was joking that night in the comedy club that if I worked in a firehouse I'd

166
00:10:01.541 --> 00:10:05.170
be that guy who stay hangs back and like makes the Chili,
you know,

167
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.100
everybody calling me a pussy.
Some homophobic words,
you know there would be,
yeah,

168
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.380
there'll be nothing against gay people.

169
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.370
It would just all about making me feel like a fucking chili making pussy.

170
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.420
I'd be sitting there stir in the pot ape.
Be careful out there guys.

171
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:26.410
I heard it's a hot one.
Fuck yeah.
Fuck fucking goddamn broad.

172
00:10:26.411 --> 00:10:28.800
Make me some fucking dude.
His fish

173
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.370
and I'd sit there with my big firemen,
red mustache,
little tear in my eye.

174
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.220
Sitting there all alone.
Taste in my chili.

175
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.600
It's a pepper Rico.

176
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.030
Oh God.

177
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.160
Do you guys realize not one nail has been put into my house since they demoed it

178
00:10:55.341 --> 00:10:57.650
the other day or whatever fucking was at six weeks ago.

179
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.120
We're still fighting with these insurance cuts over to grant cause I know what

180
00:11:02.121 --> 00:11:03.470
that they can.
It's to grant.

181
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.050
This guy eventually is going to get sick of fucking looking at this mess.

182
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.530
And you know what?
They don't know.
They don't know what they're dealing with it.

183
00:11:12.531 --> 00:11:15.590
They don't know how stubborn I am.
I'm going the opposite direction.

184
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:20.210
What I'm really seeing is all my shit that I had in the walk in closet,

185
00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.560
you know,
just strewn about in this room downstairs.

186
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.310
And I'm just looking at all of it.
Go on.
What the fuck do I need this stuff for?

187
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.870
What is that?
Do you know how it came across the other day?

188
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.220
Do you remember when those Mitchell and ness throwback jerseys were?

189
00:11:37.221 --> 00:11:42.170
All the fucking rage.
Remember that?
I remember the late great Patrice O'Neal.

190
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.450
Please download his CD.
Mr P,
all the proceeds go to his,
uh,

191
00:11:47.451 --> 00:11:51.560
his wife and his mom.
Um,
he,

192
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.610
I think at one point his entire wardrobe

193
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:55.950
<v 2>okay.</v>

194
00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.260
<v 0>Consisted of those fucking jerseys.</v>

195
00:11:59.310 --> 00:11:59.640
<v 2>Okay.</v>

196
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.030
<v 0>You know,</v>

197
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.020
and we used to give him shit when he come in wearing a fucking wide receivers.

198
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.590
Jersey Sandy was too big.
He should only buy throwback Lyman jerseys.

199
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.390
Um,
and he's like,
yeah.

200
00:12:14.391 --> 00:12:16.880
And then of course he'd fucking trashed the shit out of us,
but whatever.

201
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:21.780
So during that time they had a Fran Tarkenton throwback jersey.

202
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:27.330
The,
uh,
the white one.
Lsu,
by the way,

203
00:12:27.331 --> 00:12:31.250
I dunno who ripped off who probably the vikings ripped off Lsu considering,
uh,

204
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.930
Lsu has been around forever,
but um,

205
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.350
I have a fucking Fran Tarkenton Throwback Jersey and I'm like,

206
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.910
I forgot I even had that.

207
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:44.150
And then I remembered why I never wore it because I got it and I put it on and I

208
00:12:45.361 --> 00:12:46.710
look like an asshole.

209
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:47.990
<v 2>Okay.</v>

210
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.840
<v 0>I don't know what it was about the colors.
I don't know if it was the numbers.</v>

211
00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.590
I don't know if it was my dumb fucking face,
but I literally,

212
00:12:53.591 --> 00:12:54.740
the second I put it on,

213
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:59.630
I looked like I had a fatal disease and I was waiting for Fran Tarkington to

214
00:12:59.631 --> 00:13:04.100
show up next to my hospital bed.
That's what I look like.
So I never fucking war.

215
00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.530
I bought this fucking thing,
you know?
Remember those things.

216
00:13:06.531 --> 00:13:08.510
They were like 200 bucks to 50.

217
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.110
I've never worn that fucking thing.

218
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.573
<v 2>All right.</v>

219
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.770
<v 0>And if you can send me an email,</v>

220
00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:24.220
if you're almost five foot 10 like I am in roughly way about a buck 72 a buck 80

221
00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:27.960
depending on how much you booze.

222
00:13:27.961 --> 00:13:32.961
And if you can send me a fucking email as to why you're a giant Fran Tarkenton

223
00:13:33.981 --> 00:13:37.640
fan and all that bullshit,
you leave your address,
I'll mail that fucker til you.

224
00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:42.560
Cause you know what?
I'm done with all of this shit.
Fucking drop my computer,

225
00:13:42.561 --> 00:13:46.490
you asshole.
I'm done with all of this shit.
All right.

226
00:13:46.491 --> 00:13:49.010
I'm not going to be the guy with a bunch of shit,

227
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:55.500
you know that gradually ends up my garage and plastic tins like this fucking

228
00:13:56.261 --> 00:13:59.230
shit.
I'm not doing it.
I'm getting rid of all of my stuff.

229
00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:00.880
<v 2>Okay?</v>

230
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.220
<v 0>All these fucking books I already read and they still have them.</v>

231
00:14:03.221 --> 00:14:06.880
I'm getting rid of all of them.
You know,
when I was actually thinking this is a,

232
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:08.920
this would be a fucking hilarious way.

233
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.130
Two and a very sneaky way.

234
00:14:12.131 --> 00:14:14.650
Gradually get out of a relationship that you want to be in.

235
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:15.813
<v 2>You know,</v>

236
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.500
<v 0>possibly the biggest,
you know,</v>

237
00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.240
pussy way out of relationship rather than it just sitting down.

238
00:14:20.241 --> 00:14:23.740
And what I've always told you guys to do it,
you just sit down with the person.

239
00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:26.680
He just say,
listen,
we need to talk.

240
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:31.240
You sit down and you just started off with I'm not happy.
And that's the thing.

241
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.050
Well what if I did this,
that and that.
I'm just not happy.

242
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:41.570
What is it?
Is it the sex?
I'm just not happy.
Whatever man or woman.

243
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.413
<v 2>All right,</v>

244
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.500
<v 0>so say you didn't want to have that conversation.</v>

245
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.190
Say it just gives you so many deuce chose.
What if,

246
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.390
well it did was without her knowing,

247
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:58.810
just ever so subtly over the course of eight excruciating months still in that

248
00:15:00.231 --> 00:15:01.640
relationship you didn't want to be.

249
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:04.970
And what if he just gradually kind of got rid of all of your shit,

250
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.230
you know?
And the way you cover for it is you do yoga every day.

251
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.430
So he just tell you know your significant other,
that it's just a spiritual,

252
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.890
new spiritual path that you're taking.

253
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.560
And there'll be psyched in one way because I was getting rid of all of this
shit.

254
00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:20.690
That's fucking great.
There's more room for my stuff.
Right,

255
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:26.080
and then when you're down to like a backpack worth a shit and the clothes on

256
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:31.520
your back,
you put your toothbrush in your little fanny pack,

257
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:36.080
whatever you have left and you just,
hey,
I'm going to go run some errands.

258
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.900
He just walk out the door and that's it.
You're out.

259
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.750
There's another way to do it.
People,

260
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.880
you know some day I'm putting the book out thousand and one ways to get out of a

261
00:15:49.881 --> 00:15:52.220
fucking relationship.
That's one of them right there.

262
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.170
That's number 872 I just flipped through the book.
A little manuscript.

263
00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.610
That's one for you.
All right.
Anyways,

264
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.940
how far into this podcast are we?
Everybody?

265
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.490
That was a lovely 16 minutes here.
How bout a little advertisements?

266
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.580
How the hell do I get to him live reads [inaudible].

267
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.760
Okay,
here we go.
Pro Flowers.

268
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:27.800
Hey everybody.
Guess what it is next Sunday.
You know what is it's mother's Day.

269
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.880
Who's more important than your mom?
Nobody.
Unless she didn't stick around,

270
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:32.840
you know?

271
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.810
Then I would just wait until father's day and get the flowers for your dad.

272
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.520
Thought as he can handle it all as he won't slap in the face with them.
Go.

273
00:16:39.521 --> 00:16:42.320
And what are you giving me flowers for?
What are you trying to say about me?

274
00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:47.060
You think I'm like that guy,
that basketball player.
Um,

275
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.770
anyways,
uh,
Mother's Day is this Sunday.
Okay,

276
00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.320
here's the angle we have this week.

277
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:58.850
Proflowers everybody sibling rivalry does doesn't end because you moved out of

278
00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:02.480
the house.
You can still one up him.
Your brother sends a card,

279
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.510
your sister remembers to call.
Guess what you do.

280
00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:10.760
You taught both of them and send flowers to your mom on mother's Day.

281
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:15.200
It's brilliant.
I got to do is just call up the number,
big bang.
Boom.

282
00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:18.290
You can do it right from your kick,
from your cubicle.
Here's the offer.

283
00:17:18.291 --> 00:17:22.220
Pro Flowers has a hundred blooms for mom for just 1999.

Like I was supposed to make like,

331
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:06.480
like if I was in rehab or some shit and I was supposed to make a pie about what

332
00:20:06.481 --> 00:20:11.100
it is that I do,
you know,
and I swear to God,
no matter what I wrote,

333

I know the person would be like,
you know,
looking at this pie,

334
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:20.660
I see a lot of sadness.
It's like,
dude,
are you,
are you looking at the pie?

335
00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.690
I travel,
I tell jokes and then I get drunk afterwards.

336
00:20:23.691 --> 00:20:28.520
Where do you see the sadness in there?
It's my job to find sadness.

337
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.010
Oh fuck you.
All right.

338
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.470
Make an addiction your fucking life submission.
You don't realize I'm going to,

339
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:40.580
I'm going to give away some of these books that I have and uh,
oh,

340
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.050
I also didn't say,
uh,

341
00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:47.860
I didn't say where to send the emails to for the Fran Jersey.

342
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.260
Send it to uh,
uh,

343
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:54.380
bill at [inaudible] dot com and I'll sift through those mother fuckers.

344
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.300
I might even send you a book with it.
Huh?
You want to read about Bob?

345
00:20:58.301 --> 00:21:02.860
Prober I have is hard covered autobiography.
Um,

346
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.940
maybe ric flair to be the man you gotta beat the man.
I mean,

347
00:21:06.941 --> 00:21:10.480
what am I supposed to die of?
Random.
I got it.
Send the fucking memory bank.

348
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:14.170
You know what sucks is one time I took a bunch of used books down the street to

349
00:21:14.171 --> 00:21:17.370
this bookstore and it brought him in and this fucking content,

350
00:21:17.371 --> 00:21:22.030
I think I told this story.
I bought that Anthony Kiedis one I was telling,

351
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.790
you know,
jumping on a plane,
I'm like,
oh,
the guy from red hot chili peppers,

352
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:29.290
the guy's a rock star.
He never has a shirt on.
How much pussy did this guy get?

353
00:21:29.291 --> 00:21:31.630
I want to read about it.
Right.
So I read his book and it was,
yeah,

354
00:21:31.631 --> 00:21:32.464
that was all right.

355
00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:33.890
<v 3>Okay.</v>

356
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:37.620
<v 0>No,
I thought it was kind of a con to flee.
Seemed like a bully.</v>

357
00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.910
Kind of seem like he had like a fucking,
uh,
you know,

358
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.860
that battered wife relationship with flea.
I love you bro.
I love you.

359
00:21:46.861 --> 00:21:49.290
And then does something really mean that?
Not fully.
I'm sorry man.

360
00:21:49.291 --> 00:21:53.910
I'm so come on back.
Stop being mean to me,
Anthony.

361
00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:58.320
Right.
It just was really uncomfortable and parts of it,
you know,
and

362
00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.860
maybe I was fucking super imposing that I have no idea what,
whatever.

363
00:22:04.861 --> 00:22:06.210
So I bring it down there and uh,
you know,

364
00:22:06.211 --> 00:22:08.790
do you realize the Douche bag behind the fucking counter?

365
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.410
<v 3>Okay.</v>

366
00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:14.100
<v 0>Kind of like did some sort of half a laugh,</v>

367
00:22:14.101 --> 00:22:18.210
like laughing that I bought this fucking book.
You know what I mean?

368
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.030
And it's just like,
dude,
what was I supposed to read?

369
00:22:21.031 --> 00:22:22.410
The autobiography or your life?

370
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.293
<v 3>Huh?</v>

371
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.240
<v 0>The sarcastic guy at the fucking used bookstore</v>

372
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:33.530
surrounded by books.
Although your life would make a good one.
The irony of that.

373
00:22:33.531 --> 00:22:34.364
How about that?

374
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:35.203
<v 3>Huh?</v>

375
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.750
<v 0>Oh,
Jesus.
The violent thoughts that went through my head.
I didn't say anything.</v>

376
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.110
I was actually embarrassed,
which happens to me a lot in life.

377
00:22:43.111 --> 00:22:46.470
People just catch me off guard and they call me out for the pathetic Douche that

378
00:22:46.471 --> 00:22:48.690
I am and I believe it or not,

379
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.490
for as much as I handle hecklers onstage when I go offstage,
I think that that's,

380
00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.730
uh,
the microphones,
like my utility belt,
the second that's not in my hand,

381
00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:01.740
I go back to being the pathetic douche that needs to go on stage to feel good

382
00:23:01.741 --> 00:23:04.500
about himself.
Wow.
This is very therapeutic this week.

383
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:10.090
Puric therapeutic.
That didn't sound right.
There are patients,
um,

384
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:14.160
anyways,
did anybody watch the,
uh,
the Celtics New York Knicks series?

385
00:23:14.161 --> 00:23:16.710
How fucking amazing was that?
All right.

386
00:23:16.711 --> 00:23:20.800
And I called it the fucking Boston Celtics have the most hot and the Goddamn

387
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:21.653
league.

388
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:23.343
<v 3>Okay.</v>

389
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:27.010
<v 0>All you fucking knick fans who are texting me.</v>

390
00:23:27.011 --> 00:23:31.030
When you were up by 20 with like eight minutes ago in the fourth quarter,

391
00:23:31.031 --> 00:23:35.890
it was hilarious.
It was already coming in all the text messages na,
na,
na,

392
00:23:35.891 --> 00:23:40.630
na,
hey,
hey,
oh shit.
Oh Shit.
Oh Shit.

393
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.140
Fucking Celtics within like one on a 20 old run,

394
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:48.530
got it down to like four points or whatever.
So maybe we were down like 25.

395
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:52.630
I don't even know.
And um,
and I love that we would,

396
00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:56.240
we would down by like 20 points in the fourth quarter and none of the Celtics

397
00:23:56.241 --> 00:23:59.330
fans left.
I'm sure a couple did.
But for the most part,

398
00:23:59.331 --> 00:24:04.040
the place was still packed chanting,
let's go Celtics,
you know,

399
00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.180
Laker feds,
I'm not saying this in a bad way,

400
00:24:08.181 --> 00:24:10.160
but if you want to learn how to be better fans,

401
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:15.050
that's something you guys ought to do.
You know what I mean?
Now,

402
00:24:15.051 --> 00:24:18.050
if we were the Lakers this year who had way more talent than the Celtics,

403
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.570
we would've got swept,
you know,

404
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.620
and one of our best guys would've fucking deliberately got as second technical

405
00:24:24.621 --> 00:24:27.740
cause he doesn't want to go out there and feel the shame of being swept.

406
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:33.180
All of that stuff,
you know,
Laker fence.
Um,

407
00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:37.040
I'm extending an olive branch to try and help you guys become better fans.

408
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.460
All right.
And is the thing if one of your players,

409
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:45.440
no matter how much you love him,
walks off on the rest of his teammates,

410
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:47.720
you bull him the next fucking game.

411
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:53.200
You don't chant MVP and him thus boosting his ego even higher to the point when

412
00:24:53.751 --> 00:24:56.870
he gets an injury,
he starts tweeting during the game,

413
00:24:56.871 --> 00:25:01.040
criticizing his own fucking coach.
You know,

414
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.940
still being a distraction,
not even on the team,

415
00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:08.530
still disrupting team chemistry,
you know,

416
00:25:08.531 --> 00:25:12.880
it's going to kill me is when Colby comes back from this injury.
Um,

417
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:17.180
the way that ESPN fucking drops to their knees and blows that guy,

418
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:21.050
they are going to talk about this guy like he did his own surgery.

419
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.800
You know,
they're never going to think,
well,

420
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:26.840
they've been working on athletes with this,

421
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:31.490
this same injury and the advancements in modern medicine are so fucking

422
00:25:31.491 --> 00:25:35.060
incredible that these guys can sit here with like,
you know,

423
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:39.320
somebody's dabbing the sweat off their brow as they have.
Like,
you know,

424
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:45.330
when he called microscope glasses on or whatever to read to fucking remanned

425
00:25:46.431 --> 00:25:50.360
Coby Brian so he can go back out there and probably be 90% of what he used to be

426
00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.660
as opposed to back in the day where your career was over.

427
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.240
Or like Dominique Wilkins who had to take a year off,

428
00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:59.390
still was comeback player of the year.
They'll never bring that up either.

429
00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.510
Dominique Wilkins,
he won't get any love.
He won't get any love about it.

430
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:06.260
They'll act like nobody has ever done this before.

431
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:09.560
Maybe they'll bring up Jerry Rice coming back from his,
uh,
ACL.

432
00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.280
They'll talk about that.
Maybe they'll do that and it's gonna.

433
00:26:13.281 --> 00:26:18.281
It's gonna make me absolutely like projectile vomit onto my flat screen TV when

434
00:26:18.741 --> 00:26:23.660
they're just like,
what does it say about this guy as desired?

435
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.610
I mean,
you're like,
hey,
says it himself.

436
00:26:25.611 --> 00:26:30.611
All he wants to Ali wants to do is wind as he drives shack out of fucking town,

437
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:36.710
drives coaches out of town and very pale walks off the court,

438
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:41.120
every pig and say,
all right,
I'm done trashing the guy.
All right.

439
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:46.380
He could blow up both his and beat up me and everybody I know while eating the

440
00:26:46.381 --> 00:26:50.820
fucking BLT.
I realize this.
All right,
but if I didn't bring this shit up,

441
00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:55.920
um,
it wouldn't make me a typical country fan on the Internet.
What it,
well,

442
00:26:55.921 --> 00:27:00.540
there you go.
Um,
so anyways,
all those Celtics fans who were at the game,

443
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.390
I just want to tell you out here,
living in Laker land,

444
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.170
I couldn't have been more proud of the way you guys cheered on the team and you

445
00:27:07.171 --> 00:27:11.460
stuck around and he didn't fucking run out of the building.
You know,

446
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:15.960
knick fans would have stuck around,
but up top,
up top,

447
00:27:15.961 --> 00:27:20.670
they would download all those other guys.
You know,
all those celebrities,

448
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.930
Victoria's secret models sit next to the fucking action stars.

449
00:27:24.931 --> 00:27:28.260
They all would've left spike Lee with a state.
You know,

450
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:33.420
what has he been wearing lately?
You know what I mean?

451
00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:40.010
He looks like he was a huge Justin Timberlake fan and he's also going to clown

452
00:27:40.231 --> 00:27:44.970
college.
All right.
Anyways,

453
00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:48.300
if anybody been watching any of the,
uh,
the NHL playoffs,

454
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:50.220
they've been phenomenal so far.

455
00:27:50.221 --> 00:27:53.430
Of course I'm watching the Bruins may beliefs and,
uh,

456
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:56.520
can anybody explain this to me?
Because this seems to be a,

457
00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:01.460
anytime there's a playoff series in,
in,
uh,

458
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.910
I would say in basketball and hockey to be specific,

459
00:28:05.911 --> 00:28:10.690
not in baseball because baseball,
it's more about your stat and pitcher.
Um,

460
00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:15.630
but the first two games of the Bruins,
maple leafs series,

461
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.420
okay.
Gave one,

462
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:24.060
it looked like we were going to sweep the fucking maple leafs.
It looked like,

463
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:27.900
why the fuck out of fucked did the maple leafs even make the playoffs?

464
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.390
Bruins flying up and down the ice?
They hitting the maple leafs.

465
00:28:31.391 --> 00:28:34.650
Maple leafs aren't doing anything.
They looked like they were intimidated.

466
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.810
We score four goals,
bing,
Bang,
boom.

467
00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:41.490
Four to one easy fucking victory gained.
Two comes around.

468
00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:45.540
It's completely 100%.
The exact opposite.

469
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:50.040
Bruins are on their heels,
the fucking maple leafs of pushing us around.

470
00:28:50.041 --> 00:28:54.690
We're taking it and now we look like that frustrating team that I watched all

471
00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:58.050
year that can't score more than two goals.
And um,

472
00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:04.200
can anybody explain to me what,
what the fuck that is?
You know what happens,

473
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:08.460
happens,
what happens in those 48 hours between the games?

474
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:14.970
I just,
I don't understand it.
So tonight the Bruins and a maple leafs,

475
00:29:14.971 --> 00:29:18.450
the plan,
again,
I gotta be honest with you,
I have no idea what to expect.

476
00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:21.480
No idea what to expect.
But I could tell you this.

477
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:24.750
Phil Kessel is a great player but has one of the,

478
00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:30.680
I'd say top 10 most hateable faces in professional sports right now.

479
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.420
I don't know what that look is on his face.

480
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.820
I think if you have like a lot of baby fat on your face,

481
00:29:35.821 --> 00:29:38.580
it makes you very hateable.
I Dunno what it is.

482
00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:44.480
Maybe it's helmet
wishes,
his cheeks,

483
00:29:44.481 --> 00:29:47.520
it and they kind of stick out over his nose.
I don't know what it is.

484
00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.420
Why is my voice cracking?
Like I'm going through puberty.
I have no idea.

485
00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:56.610
And I'm also of course,
paying attention to the,
uh,
Canadians Ottawa series.

486
00:29:56.611 --> 00:30:01.320
I was at a,
I was at a cookout yesterday.
Cinco de Mayo,
self dumb.
I am last year.

487
00:30:01.321 --> 00:30:04.680
I actually,
what day?
I said,
what day is that?
Cinco de Mayo.

488
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:08.100
Now for all you other people who didn't know a lick of Spanish like me,

489
00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:12.820
that literally means May 5th
as the name of the holiday.

490
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:17.940
The name of the holiday is May 5th or the 5th of May or 5th of May.

491
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:21.080
I don't know how to fucking translate it.
Um,

492
00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.120
but I missed the fucking game and that looks,

493
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:28.380
it looked like an old school Adam's division.
You know,

494
00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:32.640
even though it was six to one total lopsided victory for,
uh,
Ottawa,

495
00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:37.080
I really wished that I watched the game and I can guaran fucking tee you.

496
00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.080
It's going to make no sense.
I,

497
00:30:40.081 --> 00:30:43.110
the Canadians are going to come back just like the maple leafs I'm predicting in

498
00:30:43.111 --> 00:30:45.900
the next fucking game and they're going to totally turn around and they'll

499
00:30:45.901 --> 00:30:49.410
probably win six to one now.
They won't because I think Ottawa,

500
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:53.430
the goalies too fucking good.
But,
uh,
here's a question I have.

501
00:30:53.431 --> 00:30:55.560
What are people going to wise up to that PK,

502
00:30:55.561 --> 00:30:59.760
sue bon fucking move where he's backing up acting like he's going to give you

503
00:30:59.761 --> 00:31:03.780
the zone and then he fucking does a couple of crossovers,

504
00:31:03.781 --> 00:31:06.330
leaves his feet and gives you a shoulder to the face.

505
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:10.110
You know the ref standard right there.
Oh,
that's a clean hit.

506
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:14.520
It's a fucking phenomenal move.
Phenomenal move.
I don't know.

507
00:31:14.521 --> 00:31:16.470
I don't understand why guys don't see it coming.

508
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:23.280
Just gotta be a reason.
Anybody.
That's it.

509
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:27.150
Um,
all right,
let's,
let's,
let's read one of these,
these,
uh,

510
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:32.010
these fucking things here.
Ah,
Jesus.
Do I need to buy a new wire or something?

511
00:31:32.011 --> 00:31:34.760
All of a sudden it's cutting out one headphone.
All right.

512
00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:39.030
To trust or not to trust.
Um,
Oh,

513
00:31:39.031 --> 00:31:43.770
before I get into that,
a condolences to that.
Uh,
the referee,
um,

514
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:45.870
who ref that soccer game,

515
00:31:45.871 --> 00:31:50.700
that high school soccer game out in Colorado when the worst things I stories

516
00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:55.710
ever,
he gave somebody a yellow card in this 17 year old kid,

517
00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.650
lost his temper and turned around and punched the guy in the face.

518
00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.230
And I dunno if it was the way he landed.

519
00:32:01.231 --> 00:32:03.240
I don't know if he had preexisting stuff for this kid,

520
00:32:03.241 --> 00:32:05.400
just caught them the right way.
But the guy,

521
00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:10.830
the ref went into a coma for like four or five days and he passed away.

522
00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:15.840
So,
uh,
it's just the,
it's still worst.

523
00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:19.620
I Dunno,
I can't say it's a warm,

524
00:32:19.621 --> 00:32:24.510
it's so many awful things have happened in the last fucking month or so.
But um,

525
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:29.950
oh Jesus Christ,
everybody involved on either side.

526
00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:33.790
I mean,
I know as much as people are going to get mad at that kid,

527
00:32:33.791 --> 00:32:36.810
17 fucking years old.
Uh,

528
00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:39.990
I just can't imagine it.
You know,
you

529
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.950
<v 3>got your whole life ahead of you.</v>

530
00:32:40.951 --> 00:32:45.930
You're going out to play soccer and you punch a guy in the face and he dies and

531
00:32:45.931 --> 00:32:48.570
now you're looking at a murder charge or manslaughter wherever they're going to

532
00:32:48.571 --> 00:32:51.990
charge you.
And then another thing is just some 46 year old guy,

533
00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:54.630
family man going out to a ref a game

534
00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:59.740
<v 0>and it,
it causes you ended up dead after.
It just,
I dunno,</v>

535
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:04.440
I dunno why I brought that up.
That really kills the fucking comedy.
Right?

536
00:33:04.441 --> 00:33:07.980
And speak the time to read some advertising.
All right,
here we go.
Oh,

537
00:33:07.981 --> 00:33:11.330
let's get it to the letters for this week.
Um,

538
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:15.930
to trust or not to trust.
Love is the question.

539
00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:17.370
Hey Bill.

540
00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:21.990
I am a 19 year old guy and had been dating a girl who is almost two years older

541
00:33:21.991 --> 00:33:26.580
than me for about two months and known her for about seven months.
All right.

542
00:33:26.581 --> 00:33:29.310
Do you realize how many numbers are in that?
Let's just start over again.

543
00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:34.340
I'm 19 dating a girl who's 21 for two months and I've known her for seven

544
00:33:35.911 --> 00:33:40.290
months.
Okay,
I got it.
We're in a long distance relationship.
Oh,

545
00:33:40.291 --> 00:33:44.310
Gigi Age and I've never met a come on,

546
00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:47.010
but we Skype almost every day

547
00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:53.090
to trust or not to trust I not to trust sir.

548
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.980
You might as well be up in a space ship.

549
00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.080
Her Pussy is on the other side of an ocean.
Do

550
00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.753
<v 3>all right.</v>

551
00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:04.361
<v 0>You want,</v>

552
00:34:04.361 --> 00:34:07.660
you're going to have to have incredible bone structure and verbal skills to keep

553
00:34:07.661 --> 00:34:08.680
that warm,
satisfied.

554
00:34:08.681 --> 00:34:12.520
I can tell you that if you're going to try and do this over Skype.

555
00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:18.190
All right,
but I plow forward here.
I live in the UK and she's in America.

556
00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.240
Uh,
I love her to bits and she says that she loves me.

557
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:26.680
I had an issue before meeting her and it really felt like I was exercising

558
00:34:26.681 --> 00:34:28.810
demons when I told her about my issues.

559
00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:33.490
She's my first girlfriend plus I've had issues around women previously as well

560
00:34:33.491 --> 00:34:37.450
as bullying in school and we got everything out in the open.

561
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:42.700
All right.
It felt like it,
it's set in Jesus.

562
00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:47.590
Some weeks I suck at reading and some weeks I really suck at reading me regroup

563
00:34:47.591 --> 00:34:48.220
here.

564
00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:53.220
He said it felt like it had set in stone a relationship that was secure and

565
00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:58.891
trustworthy given we'd shared a lot of our past such as her getting sexually

566
00:34:59.741 --> 00:35:03.820
abused as a child as well as her previous relationship breakdown.
Oh,

567
00:35:03.821 --> 00:35:05.650
breaking down.
Um,

568
00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.400
during these two months I have felt myself gaining self esteem.

569
00:35:09.401 --> 00:35:12.730
I never really had as a child.
But yeah,

570
00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:16.930
there always seems to be a,
but with the emails that you get a,

571
00:35:16.931 --> 00:35:21.931
she recently told me she cheated on me with somebody she met in the five months

572
00:35:22.031 --> 00:35:26.240
between meeting or meeting her and starting to date [inaudible] cert.

573
00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:30.820
You haven't been dating,
you've been skyping.
Um,

574
00:35:30.821 --> 00:35:34.570
she tells me it all happened too quick and she felt pressured into it.

575
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:38.460
I am unsure how to move forward and if have a future to get it along.

576
00:35:38.461 --> 00:35:42.690
Just the relationship is based on trust,
can't they?
Can that be repaired?

577
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:47.580
Thanks bill.
You should do a show in England against soon.
Uh,
no sir though.

578
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:50.250
No,
this is beyond over.

579
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.800
You're sifting through ashes of basically a relationship,

580
00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:00.090
a physical one that never existed and the more you Skype or third the lungs,

581
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.030
the heart it's going to be for you to move on.
All right.

582
00:36:03.031 --> 00:36:04.860
You said that you got some self esteem.

583
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:09.950
I need you to ramp up your self esteem even more and have the self esteem does.

584
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.250
Just say listen and do it in a nice way to say.
Um,

585
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.500
I think you're a great person and I think if you were here,

586
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:20.430
things would be different,
but you're not.
So,
um,

587
00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.970
I think it'd be better for both of us.
Not fucked better for both of us,

588
00:36:24.971 --> 00:36:27.820
cause then that could then she'll be like,
but I'm okay with it.

589
00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.590
You gotta always got to stick with you when you're talking about getting out of

590
00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:36.340
relationship.
All right.
Yeah,

591
00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.440
I mean,
silver,
you cheated on me.

592
00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:44.030
It's already hard enough that we're on different sides of size of an ocean and

593
00:36:44.031 --> 00:36:47.570
all we can do with Skype,
you know,
at the end of the day,
just be like,

594
00:36:47.571 --> 00:36:52.100
I'm not even mad at you that you cheated on me.
I understand it.
You know,

595
00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.770
human beings,
we need a human connection.
And this is like,

596
00:36:54.771 --> 00:36:58.910
I'm fucking a ground control to major Tom.

597
00:36:58.911 --> 00:37:01.600
Like I'm fucking orbiting the earth here.
We can't,
we can't have a,
a,

598
00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.500
we can't have a relationship here.
All right.

599
00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.320
<v 2>Okay.</v>

600
00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.920
<v 0>Having said that,
let me see a good just one time,
put them up against the screen.</v>

601
00:37:08.921 --> 00:37:12.700
Kateline you filthy whore.
Sorry.
Um,
yeah,

602
00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:16.210
I would not trust her,
sir.
And I would,
uh,

603
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.820
I might even go into therapy if I was,
you.

604
00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:22.060
Sounds like you had a rough go of it with the bullying and that type of thing to

605
00:37:22.061 --> 00:37:23.320
the point that,
uh,

606
00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:29.110
you're so pulled back that you're having relationships,
a nonphysical one,

607
00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:34.190
um,
over the Internet.
You gotta get out there,
sir.
He got to get out,

608
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:39.800
you know,
join a fucking volleyball league,
Softball League,

609
00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:44.510
a book of the Club,
the club,
book of the month,
League,
book,
Club of the month.

610
00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:48.680
Whatever the fuck I'm trying to say.
Uh,
you're not into sports.

611
00:37:48.681 --> 00:37:50.840
Take it fucking cooking class.
Just get out there.

612
00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:53.780
Get out there where the broads are at.
You know what?

613
00:37:53.781 --> 00:37:57.740
It's even greater if you're just,
hey,
let's go.
You know?
Oh,
you're into reading,

614
00:37:57.741 --> 00:38:01.250
you're into cooking.
It breaks the fucking ice.
I would do that.

615
00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.980
All right.
That's what I would do.
I would not trust to sir.

616
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:11.450
All right.
You deserve more than that.
Good luck.

617
00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:16.580
And God bless the United States of England.
Um,
is this a trap?

618
00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:21.530
Oh,
Billy boy.
Oh,
Danny boy,
the lights,

619
00:38:21.531 --> 00:38:25.240
the lights are calling you.
I love the podcast.
Or being,

620
00:38:25.241 --> 00:38:29.720
give me some perspective on this issue.
I am in my early thirties,

621
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:31.880
and I've been married for five years.

622
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:37.570
My wife and I recently have been having a sexual that our relationship after a

623
00:38:37.571 --> 00:38:41.920
big low caused by the birth of our two kids and me putting on some extra weight

624
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.900
and that's very honest.
Uh,

625
00:38:43.901 --> 00:38:48.430
we are back to fucking as much or more than we did when we first started dating.

626
00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:52.270
You know,
that was coming off like really like,
uh,

627
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.480
you were mature man and then you went right down to my level.

628
00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.090
I don't have to the birth of our two kids.

629
00:38:58.091 --> 00:39:02.740
There's been a sexual resurgent and uh,
you know,
I'd put on some extra weight,

630
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:07.250
but uh,
dropped a few pounds and we're back down [inaudible] as much as we used.

631
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:12.370
Um,
here's a tip for married men.
If you want more sex out of your wife,

632
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:17.350
get your ass to the gym.
It worked for me.
There you go.
There you go.

633
00:39:17.351 --> 00:39:22.351
Here's a guy practicing what I've preached for the six fucking years that I've

634
00:39:22.361 --> 00:39:24.340
been doing this podcast.
By the way.

635
00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:29.620
Next month is the six year anniversary of me starting this podcast.
Okay.

636
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:32.650
So I am expecting some,
um,

637
00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:36.400
I don't know what some sort of congratulations I should have done yet.

638
00:39:36.401 --> 00:39:40.840
Last year when it was the five year anniversary.
Um,
so this is going to the gym.

639
00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:44.830
That's right.
He's getting a pex going.
He's fighting off the man tits.
You know,

640
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.511
he's,

641
00:39:46.511 --> 00:39:51.511
he's fucking knocked Kevin that big a former fucking now rockstar God damn gut.

642
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.850
You've got to get rid of that shit and you'll live longer.

643
00:39:54.851 --> 00:39:57.880
I read something one time or overheard in a bar knowing,

644
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:01.870
knowing me that every extra pound of fat that you have is,
is,

645
00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:06.880
is five miles of capillaries that your heart has to pump blood through.

646
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:10.570
Just saying extra five pounds,

647
00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:13.000
25 more miles of capillaries.

648
00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:17.410
So you can imagine if you're 30 pounds overweight,
holy fucking shit,

649
00:40:17.411 --> 00:40:21.850
that's a hundred.
If that's a fucking road trip,
150 miles,
you got to get it off.

650
00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:25.660
Um,
that's why you always see little old ladies and little old men.

651
00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:30.340
You don't see jolly old fat 90 year old guys.
You don't,
they're gone.

652
00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.050
You know other than Bill Russell,

653
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.530
do you ever seen like a fucking 70 year old seven photo?

654
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:39.520
There's a reason for that.

655
00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:43.780
Your heart has to fucking pump all the way down to the tippy toes.

656
00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:48.830
Okay.
Also,
my wife has been open and willing to do any manner,

657
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:53.680
manner of deprived sexual shit that I can think of.
Jesus,
dude,

658
00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:59.770
he goes,
I am living the dream.
I feel like I won the wife lottery.
Well,

659
00:40:59.771 --> 00:41:03.970
I would say you do.
If she's a great mother to that's phenomenal.
So he goes say,

660
00:41:03.971 --> 00:41:06.310
here's the issue.
Oh,
okay.

661
00:41:06.311 --> 00:41:09.310
I'm going to guess that she wants to bring somebody else into the bedroom.

662
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:13.780
I'm going to guess that you fucking open Pandora's box.

663
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:19.870
And
the way this is red,
if it's another woman,
you don't give a shit.

664
00:41:19.871 --> 00:41:22.300
I'm guessing she wants another dude.
That's what I'm guessing.

665
00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:26.980
She wants a little rotisserie reaction there.
Little Boston market.

666
00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:32.470
Um,
here we go.

667
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:35.690
See,
here's the issue.
Um,

668
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:40.280
she has recently been saying that she thinks it would be really hot if I fucked

669
00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:44.120
another woman in front of her.
Oh.

670
00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:48.590
Oh.
That went on an entirely different direction.

671
00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:50.600
<v 2>Okay.</v>

672
00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.240
<v 0>She is clear that she doesn't want a threesome.</v>

673
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:58.190
She doesn't want to participate.
She just wants to be there.

674
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:04.520
Apparently this is a fairly common fetish known as being

675
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:06.160
<v 2>okay.</v>

676
00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:11.140
<v 0>Uh,
cut queen.
Did you spell it right?
See you see K Queen,</v>

677
00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:15.190
uh,
cut queen.
All right people,

678
00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:20.140
this is the first word I've learned the definition too since,
uh,

679
00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:25.780
what does it buggering of being above a getting buggered anyways,
he says,

680
00:42:25.781 --> 00:42:27.880
now I'm a guy.
No,
I'm a guy.

681
00:42:27.881 --> 00:42:32.881
So obviously I'm into variety and the idea is intriguing and like I said,

682
00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:37.120
she's willing to do basically anything I want to do in the bedroom.

683
00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:43.500
So it seems only fair that I would do what I can to fulfill her sexual

684
00:42:44.081 --> 00:42:48.490
fantasies.
Still.
This seems like a bad idea to me.

685
00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:53.050
Exactly.
Great instincts,
sir.
I don't know what her reaction is going to be.

686
00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:57.010
I don't want to jeopardize my marriage for something like this.

687
00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:58.300
What do you think,
Bill?

688
00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:02.140
Should I just go for it or listen to the voice in my head that says this is a

689
00:43:02.141 --> 00:43:06.730
bad idea if I go for it?
How would you suggest actually finding women,

690
00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:11.290
a woman who was open to the idea of being fucked in front of my wife?
Thanks.

691
00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:13.990
All right,
here we go.

692
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.650
<v 2>Yeah</v>

693
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:18.550
<v 0>Sir.
You're 100% right.
You can't fucking do this.
And,</v>

694
00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:20.850
and all the married guys out there who would like to know,

695
00:43:20.851 --> 00:43:23.730
what are you out your fucking mind.
I do that in a fucking second.

696
00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:27.100
<v 4>Focus check.
And I know this chicken deal office,</v>

697
00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:30.200
not only she fucking bang mean Farlow fucking office,

698
00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:31.370
<v 0>okay?</v>

699
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:34.880
<v 4>Hey,
love of my life.
Look at me.
Oh me,</v>

700
00:43:34.881 --> 00:43:37.780
I'm fucking baggage,
right?
All of those skies,

701
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:40.630
<v 0>those mouth breathing morons.</v>

702
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:44.980
You know who piss on the side of the road when there's a Wendy's what?

703
00:43:44.981 --> 00:43:48.250
The fucking public bathroom right there.
All of those guys don't listen to them.

704
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:52.540
So you're 100% right.
Some shit should just remain a fantasy,

705
00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:57.670
okay?
Um,
your parents,

706
00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.990
okay?
You have kids,
okay.
And when that happens,

707
00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:07.240
there's a certain level of maturity that you have to fucking have,

708
00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:08.140
okay?

709
00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:13.140
You can't be walking around in the Goddamn gimp outfit when at any second your

710
00:44:13.211 --> 00:44:17.380
fucking kids can open the fucking door to your bedroom.
You know what I'm saying?

711
00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.390
And it's just going to be,
uh,

712
00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:24.190
and you're also introducing the chance of you catching a fucking venereal

713
00:44:24.191 --> 00:44:27.100
disease.
Okay?
Because first of all,

714
00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:30.590
any woman that's going to allow you to do that is going to be a frequent,

715
00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.990
some level and evidently wearing a condom.

716
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:35.670
You could still get herpes.

717
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:41.160
I don't know how it fucking parrot troops down on your ball bag.
I have no idea.

718
00:44:41.161 --> 00:44:43.530
But evidently you can.
All right.

719
00:44:43.531 --> 00:44:46.270
And I gotta tell you some fucking thing.

720
00:44:46.271 --> 00:44:50.370
Some doors should just remain closed.
Um,

721
00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:53.533
<v 3>okay.</v>

722
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:58.230
<v 0>I don't know how I would try to make up in that area.</v>

723
00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:00.030
<v 3>Okay.</v>

724
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:01.870
<v 0>I was gonna say,
if she wanted to fuck another dude,</v>

725
00:45:01.871 --> 00:45:04.660
then you could just act like you were another dude and say a bunch of different

726
00:45:04.661 --> 00:45:05.411
dudes,
shit to her.

727
00:45:05.411 --> 00:45:08.170
Why you had a bent over and she's not looking at you said she could feel,

728
00:45:08.171 --> 00:45:11.050
you know,
you don't,
maybe we're a different cologne,

729
00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:16.500
but this whole,
uh,
you know,

730
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.310
why don't you just get a blowup doll and fuck that in front of her,
Huh?

731
00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:26.350
<v 3>Dad?
That sounded the fucking like that shit.
Yeah.
Hey,
good.</v>

732
00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.433
You

733
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.910
<v 0>right?
Maybe you could do that.
I don't know what to tell you dude.</v>

734
00:45:30.911 --> 00:45:34.030
But I'll tell you right now,
your instinct to not do it is 100% correct.

735
00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:37.120
All right?
You did hit the lottery with this woman and this is another deal,
dude.

736
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:40.870
You could be gradually opening this shit up.
You know,

737
00:45:40.871 --> 00:45:44.410
women are phenomenal masters of manipulation,

738
00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:50.410
okay?
This might be her round about way of saying,
I want to fuck another guy.

739
00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:55.570
Okay?
And what she's going to do is get you dirty first,
right?

740
00:45:55.571 --> 00:45:56.590
Just like politics.

741
00:45:56.591 --> 00:45:59.620
We can't have this guy get into the oval office unless we got something on him.

742
00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:01.840
She's doing,
she might be doing that same thing.

743
00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:05.470
Now this is just conspiracy theory.
Don't look sideways at your wife.

744
00:46:05.471 --> 00:46:07.270
Is your eating a bowl of fucking corn checks.

745
00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.430
I'm just throwing this shit out here.
All right.

746
00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:13.570
This might be her round about way of fucking getting her to be able to have a

747
00:46:13.571 --> 00:46:17.460
fucking,
all right,
you get to fuck one.
All right.

748
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:20.560
And not only does she gotta Fuck gonna Fuck Him.

749
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:25.060
You got to sit there and watch it.
You know,

750
00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:28.270
don't do it.

751
00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:34.270
Do not introduce other fucking people into your relationship.

752
00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:34.780
All right?

753
00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:39.610
Your relationship when it comes to sex and if it's going to fucking work has to

754
00:46:39.611 --> 00:46:44.290
be a secret society as far as my fucking skills go,

755
00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:48.820
my skillset,
get out.
I show up to the gym.
People know what I mean?

756
00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:49.713
<v 3>Dope.</v>

757
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:55.400
<v 0>I got one mid range jumper.
That's all I'm taking.</v>

758
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:57.950
Everybody knows if he can stop it,
you can stop it.

759
00:46:57.951 --> 00:47:00.260
That's what the fuck I'm coming with.
All right.

760
00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.440
I don't even know how the fuck I wanted to.
That analogy.

761
00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:05.720
That was supposed to be making fun of me in the fucking bedroom.

762
00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:09.590
I have my little bag of tricks,
so all I got.
Um,

763
00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:11.300
<v 3>okay.</v>

764
00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.810
<v 0>Yeah.
Okay.
Now here,
now I need something because I've never done shit like that.</v>

765
00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:20.650
I never went into that area of fucking freak week.
I never did that.
All right.

766
00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:22.603
Um,

767
00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:27.380
then I think if you are in a fucking healthy relationship at some point,

768
00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.140
both men,

769
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:33.100
women do want a variety and at some point it's gonna come up and you are going

770
00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:38.010
to talk about it and be law.
You know,
maybe we went to Vegas,
maybe yes,

771
00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:40.840
but the,
but the,
and then in the end,
you know,

772
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:45.850
usually after you've banged and got that urge out of your system,

773
00:47:45.851 --> 00:47:48.250
you lay there and you just look at each other.
Yeah.
That was the fucking,

774
00:47:48.251 --> 00:47:50.550
we think we can't do that.
It's fucking gross.
We can't do it.

775
00:47:50.551 --> 00:47:52.220
We like it would tote nights.

776
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:54.910
Like I'm not trying to judge people who do shit like that,

777
00:47:54.911 --> 00:47:58.690
but it would totally it your,
you know,
it is,

778
00:47:58.691 --> 00:48:02.470
it's a house of cards and you're pulling one out way down near the foundation.

779
00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:03.940
It might stay up,

780
00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:06.820
but the whole thing might come down and you got some kids in there.

781
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:08.980
So let me ask you this.

782
00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:15.090
At the risk of turning this podcast into a complete freak show.

783
00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:20.110
Not Freak show.
Just,
I dunno,
cause I,
I really don't judge people.

784
00:48:20.111 --> 00:48:24.040
What the fuck they do.
Um,
is there anybody out there that is married,

785
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:28.510
has a couple of kids and uh,
has,

786
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:32.560
has had this scenario,
you know,

787
00:48:32.561 --> 00:48:34.000
it has your wife been cool with it?

788
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:39.010
Did you just bring some girl and you fucking banged her?

789
00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:43.350
You know what,
what exactly,

790
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:46.560
what is the etiquette when you bang another woman in front of your wife,

791
00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:51.120
you know,
she just sitting there watching,
you know,

792
00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:53.010
like she's watching a chess match.

793
00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:58.230
Are you allowed to throw some looks like a c that you liked that move this weed

794
00:48:58.231 --> 00:49:01.320
are,
I dunno,

795
00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:06.240
I dunno what the deal is.
I imagine that there's a bunch of rules.

796
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:11.430
You're not allowed to do it.
Missionary style.
If you come,
you have to look at me.

797
00:49:11.431 --> 00:49:12.360
Don't look at her.

798
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:16.020
I mean that seems like there's all these like you know what it is,

799
00:49:16.021 --> 00:49:17.700
it's like you're starting a new sport.

800
00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:21.770
It's kind of like MMA when it first started out and you could punch upper,

801
00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:23.700
cut somebody in the balls and gouge the right,

802
00:49:23.701 --> 00:49:26.170
you can do whatever the fuck you wanted.
And then they'd be like,
God,

803
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:30.000
we need some parameters here.
Dana white came in and said,
hey,

804
00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:34.530
no more fucking upper cuts to the under carriage.
No more eye gouging,

805
00:49:34.531 --> 00:49:36.690
no kicking in the face when the guys on the ground,

806
00:49:36.691 --> 00:49:39.420
no punches to the back of the head.
He made it civilized.

807
00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:43.500
So I imagine that there has to be some sort of,
um,

808
00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:45.230
<v 2>yeah,</v>

809
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.571
<v 0>you know,</v>

810
00:49:45.571 --> 00:49:50.571
civility to the fucking another woman in front of your,

811
00:49:51.091 --> 00:49:52.110
in front of your wife.

812
00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:53.733
<v 2>MMM.</v>

813
00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:59.490
<v 0>Look who's kitten?
Hope that would be absolutely phenomenal.</v>

814
00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:04.380
But,
uh,
I,
I just,
I just couldn't imagine,

815
00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:11.180
you know,
my woman died afterwards,
afterwards,

816
00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:15.350
and the woman leaves and then I take a shower,
right?

817
00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:19.130
And then we're sitting down,
you know,

818
00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:23.110
eating spaghettio's.
Uh,

819
00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:26.960
like I would so be praying that she,

820
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:32.300
the conversation
if that she was going like,
yeah,

821
00:50:32.301 --> 00:50:35.900
I thought that was just,
wow.
I thought that was really,
that was really neato.

822
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:45.170
But the absolute fucking worst is if they would just be complete awkward
silence.

823
00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:50.580
And then all of a sudden she starts tearing up,
right.
And now here you are going,

824
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.180
but you told me to tow it and the fucking kids are sitting there.

825
00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:59.920
I just sit and think,
no,
I know,

826
00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:05.240
but I just sit there.
You're going to enjoy it that much.
You know,

827
00:51:05.241 --> 00:51:07.340
you don't put that fact with me,

828
00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:11.980
the fucking kids sitting there looking like that kitten,
the shining,

829
00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:14.860
you know when he's fucking looking up with that red rum face.

830
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:18.010
And I'll tell you right now,

831
00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:22.780
that would be a classic fucking won 80.

832
00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:28.440
That could possibly happen because of uh,

833
00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:32.140
the delicacy of women's emotions.

834
00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:35.140
And I don't mean that like they're weaker or whatever.

835
00:51:35.141 --> 00:51:38.560
This more tapped into him or whatever.

836
00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:43.630
And like I said,
this also could be some fucking

837
00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:45.210
<v 2>okay,</v>

838
00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:50.210
<v 0>top shelf pimp shit that she's doing what she really wants to go fuck another</v>

839
00:51:50.551 --> 00:51:54.960
guy.
And she knows,
well the male ego,
I can't come at them with this,

840
00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:58.890
you know?
And if her mindset is like,
hey,
it's just sex,

841
00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:02.760
she's trying to get you on the same tape page.
She has to get you fucking,

842
00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:07.800
she's got to get you dirty first.
So,
um,
I don't know,

843
00:52:07.801 --> 00:52:10.140
but like I said,
if there's people out there who've done this shit,

844
00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:13.890
please email me because I'd love to.
I'd love to know.

845
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:17.160
Um,
give me a quick

846
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:23.730
scenario of what happened and then give me a long detailed,

847
00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:28.590
it's not the act.
I get it.
The picture has been painted.

848
00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:33.450
I want to know the aftermath.
I want to know afterwards like what the fuck,

849
00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.530
how the fuck.

850
00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:39.960
I want to know what was the first topic that was discussed other than the fact

851
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:45.090
that your wife had an out of body experience of as far as like the whole

852
00:52:45.091 --> 00:52:50.020
intercourse with you,
you know,
and what is she doing?

853
00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:54.820
She's saving this up to think about later or does she literally engaging from

854
00:52:54.821 --> 00:52:57.040
across the fucking room?
You know,

855
00:52:57.730 --> 00:53:01.960
basically doing the sexual version of the guy who goes to the game with his face

856
00:53:01.961 --> 00:53:02.794

you know what,
I didn't answer his last one.
He says,</v>

906
00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:31.560
if I go for it,

907
00:56:31.561 --> 00:56:36.300
how would you suggest actually finding women who is open to the idea of being

908
00:56:36.301 --> 00:56:38.630
fucked in front of my wife?
Yeah.
I mean,
you're gonna,

909
00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:40.860
you're gonna have to find somebody who's a,

910
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:48.440
I would,
I would try and find somebody who was really advanced in their career,

911
00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:52.690
you know,
like a lawyer.

912
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:55.510
Do they have to have a certain level of job?

913
00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:59.410
I wouldn't go on fucking craigslist and signed,

914
00:56:59.411 --> 00:57:03.100
find somebody who works at a basket robins who's down for doing something like

915
00:57:03.101 --> 00:57:04.030
that,
that,
you know what I mean?

916
00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:08.710
You're trying to go out and find the cleanest person you can.

917
00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:13.330
And uh,
I would just lay it out on the table,
put it on a table,

918
00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:17.680
and I'd have everybody get fucking tested and then I'd still wear a condom.

919
00:57:17.681 --> 00:57:19.780
And then I'd have at it.
And then,
you know,

920
00:57:19.781 --> 00:57:23.530
as far as the spaghettio conversation afterwards,
that's on you.
All right,

921
00:57:23.531 --> 00:57:26.770
here we go.
Here's the next one.
A lot of sex ones this week.

922
00:57:26.771 --> 00:57:31.090
Want to bang friend's sister a dear Billy fat again?

923
00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:36.670
Uh,
first I would like to say I'm a huge fan,
but that buddy buddy,

924
00:57:36.671 --> 00:57:40.060
but a Purdue,
the podcast is influenced me changing my life for the better.
Great.

925
00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:42.990
He said,
I'm getting over an ex following.
Um,

926
00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:47.560
I dunno.
He's trying to write in the Boston accent and I can't even read that.

927
00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:52.060
Getting over an ex,
following my hat.
And there we go.
Um,

928
00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:57.770
I want to bang my friend's sister.
He even writes this in here for me.
Oh Gee.

929
00:57:57.771 --> 00:58:01.630
G H A backstory.

930
00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:07.000
He's been one of my better friends for about eight years.
And isn't this amazing?

931
00:58:07.001 --> 00:58:11.650
The power of women?
He's been one of my better,
better friends.

932
00:58:11.651 --> 00:58:16.240
He didn't say best friend a wow for eight years.

933
00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:20.650
How old is this girl?
She's 21.

934
00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:23.500
But this is getting creepy.
Let's do the math.

935
00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:26.860
So when he first started being friends with this guy,

936
00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:32.050
his sister was 13 years old.
Dude.
Come on.

937
00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:34.360
<v 2>Okay,</v>

938
00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:38.170
<v 0>that's fucking creepy.
So at what point did you start looking at her like,
Hey,</v>

939
00:58:38.171 --> 00:58:43.160
those titties is starting to come in there.
Ah,
Jesus,
ah,

940
00:58:43.161 --> 00:58:46.540
I'm going to have to shower after this one.
But you know what,
I understand,

941
00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:50.650
I understand what happens.
Uh,
for the better part of eight years.

942
00:58:50.651 --> 00:58:52.480
And we went to high school and college together,

943
00:58:52.481 --> 00:58:56.140
party got in trouble and all that other guy stuff and straight,

944
00:58:56.141 --> 00:58:59.560
he's going to put it right on the table.
He goes,
I want to bang her sister.

945
00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:02.710
I'm going to bang his sister.
He goes,

946
00:59:02.711 --> 00:59:07.360
I have known her since she was young and I am now 25 and she's 21.
Okay.

947
00:59:07.361 --> 00:59:11.550
So when she was 13,
you were 17.
Alright.

948
00:59:11.970 --> 00:59:14.710
And she's now a 21 year old lady.

949
00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:19.660
Uh Oh,
this is filthy,
sir.
This is filthy.

950
00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:25.430
Did she still have braces
the first time he saw anyways,
smoking hot.

951
00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:30.260
She's developed.
She was Welker in the Patriots' offense.
This is a creep.

952
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:35.210
Oh,
this guy is a creep.
I love you.
I love you to death,
sir.
He goes,

953
00:59:35.211 --> 00:59:38.960
I ended up getting a number from the one time we hung out with their brother and

954
00:59:38.961 --> 00:59:39.950
several others.

955
00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:43.940
So you hanging out with his brother and on this side you're suddenly hitting on

956
00:59:43.941 --> 00:59:48.470
her,
dude,
you don't need me.
Listen,
you're going to bang this girl.

957
00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:49.100
You're the,

958
00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:53.600
the end of this email should be you just asking should I do it or should I not?

959
00:59:53.601 --> 00:59:57.740
But as far as anything else,
if you're getting the fucking number

960
00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:03.320
of one of your better friends,
sister,
while he's two feet away,
you know,

961
01:00:03.321 --> 01:00:06.770
waiting for is,
maybe it's his chance to shoot pool,
you know,

962
01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:09.590
you go shoot some stick and you can get the number during that time.

963
01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:14.420
You don't need my help in that department obviously.
All right.

964
01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.720
So anyways,
the one time we hung out.
Okay.

965
01:00:17.721 --> 01:00:22.490
And with several others and she used my phone to take pictures and texted

966
01:00:23.130 --> 01:00:27.130
herself the pictures.
Oh yeah.

967
01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.440
Oh Jesus.
This is a layup right here.

968
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:30.730
<v 2>Okay.</v>

969
01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:34.780
<v 0>He goes,
I have not contacted her since because I'm not sure what to do.</v>

970
01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.060
Should I bank?
My friend's sister,

971
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:41.470
p s this friend has previously banged one of my other friends,

972
01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:45.070
sisters and has never told them,
oh,

973
01:00:45.370 --> 01:00:49.930
the two wrongs make a right for me to bang my friend's sister.

974
01:00:49.931 --> 01:00:53.170
He wrote it in capital letters.
Thanks and go fuck yourself.

975
01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.230
All right.
Um,

976
01:00:58.450 --> 01:00:59.110
<v 2>okay.</v>

977
01:00:59.110 --> 01:01:01.990
<v 0>Wow.
There's a lot of it.
This is a little fucking twist there in the end.</v>

978
01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:06.520
So you're going to use your fucking Dick is some sort of karmic

979
01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:09.403
<v 2>like</v>

980
01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:13.970
<v 0>balance in the sexual universe.
Karmically,</v>

981
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:16.190
he does deserve this,
but not by you.

982
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:20.310
The fucking dude whose sister got banked,

983
01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.420
he should go and fucking bang his sister and his,
another thing too,

984
01:01:24.421 --> 01:01:27.600
if this girl is as hot as you say she is,

985
01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:32.601
you are running the risk that she's just a fucking narcissistic like Dick Tease

986
01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:35.940
and she's taking phones with your camp.

987
01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:39.330
You have to your cell phone camera just because that's just what she fucking

988
01:01:39.331 --> 01:01:42.840
does is takes all my God,
look how hot I am ad look at this angle.

989
01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:47.310
Look at me doing this.
Oh,
well making the duck face right.
Um,

990
01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:49.683
<v 2>okay.</v>

991
01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:50.543
<v 0>Oh Man.</v>

992
01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:52.990
<v 2>Okay.</v>

993
01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:57.950
<v 0>I don't know what to tell you here sir.
He could do the age old,</v>

994
01:01:57.951 --> 01:02:02.660
rub one out,
rub one out and then in the Zen afterwards,

995
01:02:02.661 --> 01:02:05.830
think about it.
If you still want to do it then a,

996
01:02:05.831 --> 01:02:10.430
I'd say check your shoot and fucking jump out the back of the plane.

997
01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:15.530
Um,
you know what dude,
this is on you cause I don't,

998
01:02:15.531 --> 01:02:18.140
you said you haven't said much about the guy.

999
01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:22.950
You seem to have sort of like,
this is a guy that you've,
you've hung with,

1000
01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:27.951
but you don't seem to be saying that you guys have a real strong friendship and

1001
01:02:30.391 --> 01:02:34.590
he's kind of a dirt bag and bag one of your friends.
You know what fucker?
Do it.

1002
01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.793
<v 2>Do it</v>

1003
01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:42.320
<v 0>every once in a while.
I say go and do the dumb thing.
You're young enough,</v>

1004
01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:47.920
by all means wear a fucking condom.
Uh,

1005
01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:52.070
this is going to be so fucking sneaky.
This is another thing too.

1006
01:02:52.071 --> 01:02:54.800
I fall you want to do is bang her.
If you have no feelings for you are,

1007
01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:59.600
you are risking this fucking relationship
and is,

1008
01:02:59.601 --> 01:03:02.930
you know what it's going to be hilarious is when he comes running up to your

1009
01:03:02.931 --> 01:03:05.930
house and you know what's going to be raining out because whenever you find out

1010
01:03:05.931 --> 01:03:09.680
your friend fucked your sister and you have to go beat the shit out of him,

1011
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:10.790
it's always raining out.

1012
01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.910
God helps you out.
So your,

1013
01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:20.060
your buddy who fucked your sister also doesn't see the tears in your eyes

1014
01:03:20.061 --> 01:03:24.440
because it's pouring down raining and you bang on that screen door,
right?

1015
01:03:24.441 --> 01:03:25.670
Bang on that fucking thing.
He can,

1016
01:03:25.671 --> 01:03:30.230
you know my center front lawn or you guys roll around in the mud punching each

1017
01:03:30.231 --> 01:03:30.960
other.

1018
01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:34.430
Then you've got to understand that like what is your out going to be there?

1019
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.770
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1020
01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:39.250
<v 0>yeah,
will you fuck so and so sister?
So it's even,</v>

1021
01:03:40.090 --> 01:03:42.940
does he know that you know that he fucked to the other person's sister?

1022
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:48.960
This is like an episode of Dallas.
I say,
well let me know.

1023
01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.170
Look,
this is the last question I have.
That kid you've known for eight years,

1024
01:03:52.171 --> 01:03:55.010
what is his martial art background?
What if his,
uh,

1025
01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:56.430
when he gets into fights in bars,

1026
01:03:56.431 --> 01:03:59.880
does he have a tendency to bite somebody's ear off?
Is he a maniac?

1027
01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:04.980
Can you beat this guy if he jumps you when your own driveway?
You know,

1028
01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:11.400
you know what?
I don't know why.

1029
01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:14.610
Cause I usually give good advice.
I'm telling you right now,

1030
01:04:14.611 --> 01:04:17.610
this is a dumb thing to do,
but I'm telling you to go out and go do it.

1031
01:04:19.110 --> 01:04:22.110
Go on and go do it.
Fuck him.
He banged your father,
Buddy's sister.
Go ahead.

1032
01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:25.020
Make it all right with your Dick.

1033
01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:29.010
Make the world right again with you.
Dick.

1034
01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:33.450
Please give me a followup email.
I want to know how it goes down.
All right?

1035
01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:37.170
But this is the thing.
You got to let her jump in the boat.
All right.

1036
01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:42.780
Make it be her fucking idea.
This is the deal the whole time you're doing spec.

1037
01:04:42.781 --> 01:04:46.560
You know,
I don't know about this,
but blah,
blah blah.
You know,

1038
01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:50.670
I feel guilty cause again,
it died at that and just let it be.
No,
it's okay.

1039
01:04:50.671 --> 01:04:53.880
Let her fucking dive bomb down in your deck and then your are right.
Right.

1040
01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:58.380
I'm going to tell you all of that advice came with a giant fucking Asterik.

1041
01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:01.760
Beyond that,
I'm a moron and I'm not a therapist,
but I'm,

1042
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:06.720
I'm telling you to step into the quicksand cause I think that you have the

1043
01:05:06.721 --> 01:05:10.680
ability to make it to the other side.
I believe in you,
sir.

1044
01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:15.870
Good luck.
And God bless.
Um,
dilemma.

1045
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:19.750
What would you do for $1 billion that you wouldn't do for a million?

1046
01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:22.390
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1047
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:27.100
<v 0>Um,
not a lot.
I'm not motivated by money to be honest with you.</v>

1048
01:05:27.101 --> 01:05:32.020
What would I do for $1 billion that I wouldn't do for a million?
All right.

1049
01:05:32.021 --> 01:05:36.970
For $1 million.
Now,
you know what I gotta to be honest,

1050
01:05:36.971 --> 01:05:39.280
if I wouldn't do it for a million that I wouldn't do it for a billion.

1051
01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:44.780
I could live off a million.
Is that tax free by the way?

1052
01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:49.490
Free and clear
prenup and all that shit.
That's my million.

1053
01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:51.680
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1054
01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:56.180
<v 0>Let's see.
What would I do for $1 million?
What I eat dog shit.
No,</v>

1055
01:05:57.140 --> 01:06:02.130
I wouldn't humiliate myself.
You know,
I,
I,

1056
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:04.080
I'm not motivated,
motivated by money.

1057
01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.870
You know what,
if I was still working in a warehouse unloading trucks,

1058
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:14.680
that would be a good time to ask me that question.
All right.

1059
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:19.510
But I make enough money to pay my mortgage and get these banker cuts,

1060
01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:23.620
cuts off my back as soon as I can.
Uh,
you know what?

1061
01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:28.630
I'm a happy guy.
Keep the money.
You can't buy this redheaded con.

1062
01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:35.440
I'm sorry.
I know that you wanted a funnier answer than that,
but I don't have it.

1063
01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:42.280
I don't give a shit
one site once.
It's not worth the trouble.

1064
01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:47.700
I've never understood those game shows that one Rogan hosted what people were

1065
01:06:47.801 --> 01:06:51.810
eating Yak balls.
It's like for what?
Why?
Why,
you know,

1066
01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.280
have a shred of fucking self esteem.

1067
01:06:57.030 --> 01:07:01.350
What's wrong with you?
You never do something for the money,
you know,

1068
01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:02.070
unless I look,

1069
01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:07.070
I'll do a bad standup gig for the money cause I'm trying to pay down the house.

1070
01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:11.220
I'll do that.
I mean I would do that,

1071
01:07:11.221 --> 01:07:14.790
but nobody's going to give you $1 million to do standup.
Yeah.
Jesus.

1072
01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:17.040
We were doing so well.
Let me see if I can make this one funny.

1073
01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:21.770
Girlfriends past a Billy boy.
I am.

1074
01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:25.560
I have,
I'm having problems.
I'm having problems reading this,
sir.

1075
01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:28.260
I'm having problems dealing with all the guys.

1076
01:07:28.261 --> 01:07:30.210
My girlfriend has fucked before me.

1077
01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:34.770
She's 17 and a senior in high school and she's been with four to five guys

1078
01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:40.040
all the way and blown more.
No.

1079
01:07:40.041 --> 01:07:42.990
Why are you saying four to five?
You know,

1080
01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:44.730
if you've only fucked four or five people,

1081
01:07:44.731 --> 01:07:47.250
she got to be able to remember all of them.
She'd Ma,
she said,

1082
01:07:47.251 --> 01:07:51.150
my first girlfriend,
I'm 18 BZ there buddy,

1083
01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:52.350
go easy.

1084
01:07:52.410 --> 01:07:56.460
Is 17 considered under age cause you get busted for statutory rape?

1085
01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:02.130
Uh,
make sure she's legal.
He goes,
she's my first gate girlfriend.

1086
01:08:02.131 --> 01:08:06.810
I'm 18 but I wasn't a virgin because before,

1087
01:08:06.811 --> 01:08:11.700
because my neighbor forced me to have sex with her when I was five.

1088
01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:14.863
<v 2>What</v>

1089
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:22.490
<v 0>sexual with what?
You're a little Ding Dong.</v>

1090
01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:30.020
What was she doing?
Dude,
that's fucking creepy.

1091
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:33.020
I didn't even know that.
Anyways,

1092
01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:36.320
she lost her virginity in a one night stand when she was 14.

1093
01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:40.520
It just kills me every day that my virginity was stolen from me and she just

1094
01:08:40.521 --> 01:08:41.630
gives hers away.

1095
01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:45.410
It doesn't help that she still goes to the same school as the guy.

1096
01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:48.980
And while they don't really talk,
she fucked him again last summer,

1097
01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:51.470
a couple of months before we started dating.

1098
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:56.540
I feel like she's just let people use her and it really disgusts me.

1099
01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.530
I don't even know if I love her or if I even like her very much.

1100
01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:03.440
Am I overreacting about our past or not?
No,
dude,

1101
01:09:03.441 --> 01:09:06.590
what you're doing is you're tapping into how you feel about this girl and what

1102
01:09:06.591 --> 01:09:10.520
you're looking for in a woman.
And this girl,
isn't it?
Okay?
It's,
you know,

1103
01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:15.560
hopefully whatever happened to you didn't happen to her,
but um,

1104
01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:22.790
you would,
would,
you do,
sir?
Is you're fighting yourself esteem or discovering it.

1105
01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.600
All right?
Listen to that voice.
Okay?

1106
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:28.790
This isn't the kind of woman that you are looking to be with.

1107
01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:32.540
So I would break up with her.
All right?

1108
01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:36.500
And then get with a girl that hasn't fucked four to five guys that you're going

1109
01:09:36.501 --> 01:09:39.290
to pass on your way to math class,
all right?

1110
01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:44.510
As the deal,
all right?
You sound like you've gone through some shit.

1111
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:48.350
I probably go to therapy or without one there.
You know,

1112
01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.830
whatever the fuck happened to you and uh,

1113
01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:54.750
but what's great is you've come out of this that you,
you will,

1114
01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:59.350
they're still tapped in what you looking for in a girlfriend you want,
you want,

1115
01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.193
you know,

1116
01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:04.820
a great girl deserves a great guy and you sound like you're a great guy.

1117
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:08.390
So go out there and get a great girl.
That's what you should do.
All right?

1118
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:12.080
And be healthy human beings with one another.
Okay?

1119
01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:14.540
Don't let what the fuck happened to you when you're five.

1120
01:10:14.541 --> 01:10:18.980
Go down some dark sexual road that you pick these damaged girls that you relate

1121
01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:22.670
to faulty.
You probably need to go to therapy,
work some shit out,
all right?

1122
01:10:22.671 --> 01:10:26.510
But she didn't write me.
You did.
So I'm telling you to do that.
And um,

1123
01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:31.220
yeah,
get yourself a myth to fuck is with my voice.

1124
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:37.010
Get a girl.
You're proud to be with that.
You want to bring home to your parents.

1125
01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:41.750
All right.
That's the one.
There you go.
All right.

1126
01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.450
And that's it.
Everybody.
That's the podcast for this week.

1127
01:10:45.490 --> 01:10:46.910
I just got a couple of things.

1128
01:10:46.911 --> 01:10:50.330
I got some announcements as far is where I'm going to be a,

1129
01:10:50.331 --> 01:10:53.600
this is actually a huge gig in my life.
Um,

1130
01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.350
I've always wanted to work Las Vegas and I did it on the way up,

1131
01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:02.120
but the way Vegas works is either a,
you know,

1132
01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:07.550
yeah.
Headlining a great rump or your work in some dump.

1133
01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:11.030
And I was always in some dump and it was a depressing place to be because when

1134
01:11:11.031 --> 01:11:15.930
you work in a dump in Las,
you know,
basically the,

1135
01:11:15.931 --> 01:11:20.220
uh,
you know,
you just see these gamblers that fucking,

1136
01:11:20.221 --> 01:11:22.920
they don't have any money and it's just,
it's,
it's fucking horrific.

1137
01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.760
So I was never able to headline anyplace.
Nice.

1138
01:11:26.761 --> 01:11:31.320
One hours out there,
except when I toured with,
uh,
Jimmy Norton,

1139
01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.320
Jim Breuer,
and uh,
David tells,

1140
01:11:33.321 --> 01:11:37.080
so this is the first time I'm actually going to go get to go out there and

1141
01:11:37.081 --> 01:11:38.370
headline a major casino.

1142
01:11:38.371 --> 01:11:43.371
I'm going to be at the Mirage casino May 17th and May 18th in Las Vegas,

1143
01:11:43.711 --> 01:11:48.480
Nevada.
I'm obviously beyond honored to be out there and um,

1144
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:52.230
I love it if you guys came out,
showed up,
took a trip to Vegas or whatever,

1145
01:11:52.231 --> 01:11:55.800
I believe there's still a few tickets left and um,

1146
01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:01.080
and later on in the month I'm going to do a nice east coast run count Basie

1147
01:12:01.081 --> 01:12:05.430
theater in Red Bank,
New Jersey.
May 29th,
May 30th.

1148
01:12:05.730 --> 01:12:07.890
I'm going to be at the hope I say this right.

1149
01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:11.070
Mayor Hoff Symphony Hall in Baltimore,
Maryland.

1150
01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:16.290
May 31st the State Theater Center for the arts in Easton,

1151
01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:17.160
Pennsylvania.

1152
01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:23.120
And on June 1st I have two shows at the Borgata casino and spa in Atlantic City,

1153
01:12:25.711 --> 01:12:28.770
New Jersey.
So,
uh,
please come out there.

1154
01:12:28.771 --> 01:12:33.771
I believe on that trip that New Jersey swing is going to be the one and only the

1155
01:12:34.171 --> 01:12:39.171
teen idols sensation Joe to Rosa who has a half hour comedy central special

1156
01:12:39.211 --> 01:12:43.320
debuting I believe this weekend on comedy central.

1157
01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:48.500
Please email or tweet Joe to Rosa Facebook and find out when his half hour

1158
01:12:48.841 --> 01:12:52.490
specialist please watch is special cause how comedy central works is,

1159
01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.610
is if the ratings are beyond a certain point,
they're going to keep showing it.

1160
01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:57.570
And uh,

1161
01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:01.770
Joe's one of the great guys both on and off business who would be really great

1162
