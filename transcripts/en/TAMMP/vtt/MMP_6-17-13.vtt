1
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:02.850
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.960
It's bill burr and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:11.730
June 17th,
2013 here when I added something there.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.490
I as you just say,
it's the Monday morning podcast and I went,

5
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:19.491
it is the Monday morning podcast as if to suggest that I'm even more impressed

6
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:23.730
with myself this week than I usually am.
How are you guys doing?

7
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:27.720
How's your Monday?
Yeah,
it's,
you have a bad one.

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.010
Oh it's okay.
Cause there's always Tuesday.

9
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.730
What you guys to go for actually wrote a show tune about Tuesday.

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.260
It was a blatant ripoff of Annie,
you know,
you know,
I could actually play any,

11
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:43.020
when I was younger,
when I was 12,
I could have played any,

12
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.200
uh,
you know,
said in fucking true.
That is,
I really could have,
you know,

13
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:57.030
12 by voice to lead and changed,
uh,
this big stupid fucking,
you know,

14
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.870
you know,
it was in getting into metal music.
I tried to grow my hair long,

15
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:04.290
but it just,
it was too thick back in the day.
Still wish it was thick,

16
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.840
but we just fucking grow out into like an Afro.

17
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.390
I just look like an extra on like welcome back Carter,
you know,
which is fucked,

18
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.780
which would have been cool in the late seventies.
You know,

19
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:19.920
I miss my fucking wheel house by like,
I swear to God maybe six,

20
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:24.921
seven years if I had been born instead of 1968 if I born been born in 1962 but

21
00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:29.730
then,
you know what I would have been,
I'd be 51 right now.
You know,

22
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:33.330
I would've started podcasting late in the game,
you know,

23
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.980
being all grumpy

24
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.363
<v 1>radio.</v>

25
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.470
<v 0>Um,
anyways,
yeah.</v>

26
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.530
Somebody told me a funny joke that they had in the onion.

27
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.720
I don't know if you guys read that,
that uh,
that periodical,

28
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.580
whatever the fuck you call it,
newspaper,
um,
phone news,

29
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.610
is that what it's called?
I don't fucking know.
But they had something,

30
00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:02.060
whether it was somebody sitting in front of the laptop,
I guess with an anger,

31
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.050
anguish look on their face.
I haven't seen it,
but it says,
uh,

32
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.340
something over 250,000 podcasters stress trying to find guests for their

33
00:02:12.921 --> 00:02:17.750
podcasts this week.
You know what,

34
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:22.640
that made me feel good.
That made me feel really good cause,
uh,

35
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.560
I don't have any guests on my fucking podcast.
Rarely do I have kissed.

36
00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:27.920
And that's the fucking main reason,

37
00:02:27.921 --> 00:02:32.600
cause I don't want to have to sit there and try to work with other people and

38
00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:36.260
their schedules and that type of shit and fucking,
you know,

39
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.660
I don't want to interview my French.
So what,
what is your middle name?

40
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.720
I don't want to do that.
And then,
you know,
they,

41
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.670
they fucking book shit and then they cancel on you and then you're struggling

42
00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:49.130
for a guest and then you have somebody in there and you're like,
why?

43
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:53.660
I wanted this person realized that they weren't my first choice.
You know,

44
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.410
speaking of which,
that reminds me,
I have to get back to Jay Moore.

45
00:02:57.411 --> 00:03:00.070
I've been coming in and out on the war,
on the war,

46
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.980
going in and out on the road when I say the war,

47
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.620
because I was just reading a bunch of international shit,
I think.
And uh,
yeah,

48
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.520
he sent me a very flippant text message that I,
they intend on addressing,

49
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.540
you know,
Classic East Coast Guy.
He just can't ask you to be on the podcast.

50
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:19.240
He has to put you on the fuck at defensive,
you know,

51
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.940
so I'm going to call him today,

52
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.620
try to set up a time to do his podcast and,
and,

53
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:31.621
and we'll fucking discuss his flippant fucking text message to me,

54
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.880
which I did not appreciate.
All right.
See that Jay,

55
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:40.120
I'm fucking cop.
Crosspollinate near right.

56
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.170
Fucking guy texted me,
he's texting me.
He comes at me with this fucking tone.

57
00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:50.610
Like I owe him money.
You know,
where is that fucking text message?

58
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.770
He,
he writes this shit like gathering,
uh,

59
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.420
I gathered by hearing you on other people's podcasts.
You're back in town.

60
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.080
Cause I told him a few weeks ago,
he said,
can you do my podcasts?
I go,
no,

61
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.980
I'm out of town.
And then I was,
I went over to Bert Kreischer House.

62
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.340
I'll give you the whole fucking soap opera because I go over it per Chrysler's

63
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.260
cause I'm trying to get them on our all things comedy podcast network,
right?

64
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.820
So I'm shooting the shit over.

65
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:22.660
I'm pitching the fucking network to Burke fracture and a,
he goes,

66
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.720
well this is my podcast.
Shouldn't do but fuck it.
Let's do a podcast.

67
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.430
So that's what happened.
So there Jay gets his tears me on Burt's.

68
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:32.980
This is what I'm guessing.
Here's me on Burt's.
And he's like,

69
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.660
I thought this guy said he's out of town now.

70
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:38.290
You guys fucking panties all in a Jersey bunch.

71
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.800
And then he sends me this fucking thing.
Well I gather you're mid town.

72
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.950
Let me tell you something.
Jay Morris.
Jay to the motherfucking Morris.

73
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.550
Okay.

74
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.930
I am not unready contract with you or anybody else in his podcast world.

75
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.621
You got to stare me.

76
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:58.621
I am afraid and I will fucking podcast with whoever the fuck I want to whenever

77
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:03.790
I want to.
Young man.
That being said,

78
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.820
I'm going to try to do Jay's podcast this week.
Oh,
we so sensitive.

79
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.820
I love you Jay Moore.
All right.
Okay.

80
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.530
Continuing on.
Speaking of fucking wars,

81
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.470
cause maybe I'll start having a war with the j Maura.
Be Good.

82
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.300
It'd be good for both our podcasts.

83
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.373
<v 2>MMM.</v>

84
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.600
<v 0>Speaking of that Shit,
not like I've done this.
I'm just all bullshit and okay,</v>

85
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:36.100
before you guys fucking go epic,
epic fucking uh,
something,

86
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:39.040
something Twitter,
knock out,
whatever the fuck you,

87
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.080
you know,
it's all I'm trying to say.
Fucking know what anything's called.
Anyways,

88
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.200
I was on a,
I was reading the news today as I do.

89
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.190
I got one of those iPad minis for my birthday.

90
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:58.490
Butoh Bodo Boto Baloo so now what I do is sit out on my front porch like a

91
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:02.660
fucking old man in a rocking chair and you know,
that's something I was fighting,

92
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.720
fighting how great it felt to sit on a front porch sitting on a rocking chair,

93
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.020
reading the 21st century's newspaper.
You know,

94
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.380
I don't have the paper in my hand and isn't that some little kid that comes in?

95
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:19.880
Hey Mr Right.
Throws the thing over the fucking wall and I'll,

96
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.760
Hey dad,
thanks.
Thanks a lot dad.
Johnny Appleseed,
right.

97
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.480
And I get my Nicco when he goes,
Oh,
I thank you Mr [inaudible].

98
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.380
He goes down at buys like fucking 80 pieces of candy like you could back in the

99
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.480
day,
right down to the penny arcade.
You know,

100
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.520
some guy down there with the fucking derby on beating you with a cane.

101
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.820
Um,
I was fighting that feeling

102
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.720
just sitting out there.
I'm telling you right now,

103
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.150
just fucking given to be in an old fuck.

104
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:52.130
Like making shit out on a front porch.
If you don't have one Usia neighbors,

105
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.260
right?
He's at work.
Fuck them.
That's his fault for having a job.

106
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.400
You're in between jobs.
Nobody's using his porch.
Right.

107
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.980
Chat the clique.
That's not even his porch.

108
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.090
At least the land isn't that belongs to the court.

109
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.390
What the fuck is the Apache?
Depending on where the hell you live.

110
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:18.310
I shot his fucking land.
What?
Cause a piece of paper says it is.

111
00:07:18.311 --> 00:07:21.820
I don't fucking know.
So I'm sitting out there on,
on,
on my front porch,

112
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.930
on my rocking chair and I was just reading about a,

113
00:07:25.931 --> 00:07:30.931
I'm trying to figure out why we are arming the rebels in Syria.

114
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:37.180
Right?
And why Russia is arming the dude in power there.

115
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.260
That Assad,
sad guy.
Whatever the fuck his name is.
Right.
I can't figure out,

116
00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:44.380
I'm trying to figure out what both sides have to gain.

117
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:46.743
You know,

118
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.160
was that President Coo with us and he was given us whatever we wanted and now

119
00:07:51.161 --> 00:07:54.250
he's not.
So we're like,
fuck Campbell going to help the,
the fucking rebels.

120
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.890
I have no idea.
I fucking,

121
00:07:58.891 --> 00:08:02.550
I scoured the Internet for like at least three minutes before I did this podcast

122
00:08:02.551 --> 00:08:06.420
and I could not find one fucking reason why we were doing it.
Oh,

123
00:08:06.421 --> 00:08:07.890
why Russia was doing what they were doing.

124
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.810
Now Russia is saying that the reason why they actually gave a reason,

125
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:17.640
they said the reason why they are backing the dude in power in Syria is because

126
00:08:17.641 --> 00:08:21.240
the Syrian rebels kill,
uh,

127
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.930
Syrian soldiers and then eat their hearts in front of the locals.

128
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.500
And if that doesn't sound like a bunch of bullshit,
I don't know what is.

129
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.700
So that's his justification.
He goes,
well,
you know,
the fucking sitting there,

130
00:08:35.701 --> 00:08:40.440
I eat in the end trails like licorice,
you know,
we don't wanna be a part of that.

131
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:45.800
And uh,
but as far as I can tell,
we haven't said why we're backing them.
I Dunno,

132
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.760
cause they want democracy,
which is what we always say.
But then we usually,
it's,

133
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.750
there's something else we want there.
You know,

134
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.320
something in the gift shop that we got our eye on,
so I have no idea.

135
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:00.330
So I'm going to pay attention to it.
You know what I'm actually thinking,

136
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:04.170
I'm just thinking back.
This is just like a,
which is making money.

137
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.270
I think that that's what this meeting is about,
Northern Ireland.

138
00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:10.990
<v 3>Okay.</v>

139
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.780
<v 0>All right.
In a way,
like the u s is just like,
well listen,</v>

140
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.600
we don't manufacture anything in our country,
every mall anymore.

141
00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.880
Everything's fucking left.

142
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.400
You know that any luck we can fucking legalize weed will finally have some neck

143
00:09:24.401 --> 00:09:29.140
sport again.
It's basically,
we're not making any fucking money.
No rush.

144
00:09:29.141 --> 00:09:31.990
She's just like,
Hey,
you know,
we're fucking,
uh,

145
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.690
we've got a big shit storm over here too,
right?
Well,
I'm this side you want,

146
00:09:37.691 --> 00:09:40.600
I'm not Saturday.
Kind of blow each other up and how we make a little more money.

147
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.410
What do you think?
Sound good?
All right,

148
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.930
let's make some funny on too.
I took a break and then they walk out.

149
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:54.190
Then that's it.
So anyway,
star,
those rich kids who run the world,

150
00:09:54.191 --> 00:09:59.140
I guess they're in a northern Ah,
Ireland this week and there's no protesters.

151
00:09:59.141 --> 00:10:00.550
There's like 2000 protesters.

152
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.030
<v 3>Okay.</v>

153
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:06.690
<v 0>You know,
I don't know as much as I bitch,
I don't think I'd ever go to a protest.</v>

154
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.600
It's just so much work.
You've got to make that sign.

155
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:11.810
<v 3>Okay.</v>

156
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:16.490
<v 0>You know,
and I know none of the big thing is you gotta be informed.
You don't,</v>

157
00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:20.420
you know,
you're informed as a protester.
They don't show your interview on TV.

158
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:28.040
They always show the biggest fucking wing nut at those things.
You know,

159
00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:32.780
half a titty out,
face fucking painted,
you know?
Hey man,

160
00:10:32.781 --> 00:10:37.490
like it ain't right,
man.
No,
that fucking hatchet dude,
I don't know.
Sorry,

161
00:10:37.491 --> 00:10:41.030
this podcast,
this podcast is all over the place,
but you know what?

162
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:46.010
I have been all over the place.
I had another wonderful quick tour.

163
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:50.450
I did a St Louis,
Cleveland,
Ohio,

164
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:55.460
and uh,
in Buffalo,
New York.
And um,
I got to tell you,

165
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.900
I spent way too little time time in each city.
I,
uh,

166
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.350
I had a great fucking time in each and every one of those,
those places.
Uh,

167
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.830
let's start with St Louis.
May Be in Saint Louis,
Louis.
Um,

168
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.400
<v 3>okay.</v>

169
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.160
<v 0>I can't remember the name of the fucking place someplace.</v>

170
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.640
Everything's named a pageant or the palace.
I don't fucking remember.
Then my

171
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.590
a website takes it off the second.
It's the day of the show.

172
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.130
Takes it off the thanks.
And now I don't even fucking know.
Um,

173
00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:26.320
anyways,

174
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.260
I performing this wonderful theater that I've been to before that I'm actually

175
00:11:29.261 --> 00:11:31.780
going to look up right now because the owner is so fucking cool and I'm being a

176
00:11:31.781 --> 00:11:33.670
Dick Right now.
Let's see here.

177
00:11:33.671 --> 00:11:38.140
Say Louis Bill Burr.
Let's see what comes up here.

178
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.800
Bill burr bombs in Saint Louis.
What the fuck or shit?
No.
Um,

179
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.313
<v 3>okay.</v>

180
00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.720
<v 0>Where the hell is it?
Oh,
there it is.
The pageant pay,</v>

181
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:52.730
the wonderful pageant theater and right up the street there they got,

182
00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.940
they had all the others cool old record store,
which I never got into.

183
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.690
They had a great pizza place and they also had,
um,

184
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.660
they had this fucking a,

185
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:10.030
this bowling alley slash cool bar and it was perfect.

186
00:12:10.031 --> 00:12:13.090
It was just enough for the old bowling alley thing and not at,

187
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:15.280
not like a whole hipster thing with the bar.

188
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.030
And all it had was like fucking eight lanes wasn't one of those places that has

189
00:12:19.031 --> 00:12:20.320
like 40 fucking lanes.

190
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:25.410
So me and Jason Law had went in there killing time during the day and uh,

191
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.150
we bowled one frame.
We were fucking horrific.
I bowled in,

192
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.620
I think I bowled an 87,

193
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:40.330
you know,
I ball once every five years.
By the time I figured out how to get some,

194
00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:42.340
so I bought Bolis straight ball of course,

195
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.310
but by the time I've figured out how to fucking,
you know,

196
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.360
get back into that rhythm,
whatever the fuck it is that I'm doing wrong,

197
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.240
my fucking hacky swing there.
Uh,

198
00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:56.950
I'm usually in the fucking six frame,
is that the right thing?
Had a beer.

199
00:12:56.951 --> 00:13:00.820
They had a great time and I went into their,
their,
uh,
they have,
uh,

200
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.960
they have a city park there.

201
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.500
And I was thinking there's no fucking awake cause it like,
you know,

202
00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:07.900
it's one of the biggest pork so it'll all be United States.
And I'm like,
well,

203
00:13:07.901 --> 00:13:10.330
I've been through central park,
it's not going to be as big as that shit.

204
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.580
This thing was fucking huge.
Highly recommend it if you don't like going to gyms.

205
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.400
I like to work out outside,
just walk around and that type of thing.

206
00:13:18.401 --> 00:13:23.230
And they got like a fucking golf course.
Is it Goddamn Zoo in there?

207
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.093
Right.

208
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.130
I'm walking around the outskirts all of a sudden looking at a fucking zebra.

209
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.323
Right.

210
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:29.380
<v 3>Okay.</v>

211
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.930
<v 0>I think it was,
I walked the whole way around the outside.</v>

212
00:13:31.931 --> 00:13:36.190
It had to have been at least four,
four and a half,
five miles.
And uh,

213
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:37.740
<v 3>okay.</v>

214
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.010
<v 0>It's a great time that I went bowling,
went out,
had a great show.</v>

215
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.150
What do we do that night?
Oh,
then we went upstairs to the rooftop bar.

216
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.030
I'd like does the Blue Moon or whatever the hell it is,

217
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:52.440
the Moon Tower hotel that I was staying at at uh,
went up there,

218
00:13:52.441 --> 00:13:55.380
hung out Metson people after the show,
everything was good.

219
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.610
And then there was these two fucking hilarious kids who are like,
uh,

220
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.660
like 21,
22 years,
years old,
level drunk.

221
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.063
You know,

222
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.030
this fucking dude came up because somebody had yelled something about Tim Tebow

223
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.100
during the show.
So it comes out to me is I uh,
I uh,

224
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.660
[inaudible] stuff now.
My God.
All right,
cool man.
Great.

225
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:22.680
Because I actually had a good time.
Three minutes later it comes out to me.
Ah,

226
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.170
that,
ah,
Yay.
Hey,

227
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:31.020
tell Jay wows staff.
I man.
Yeah,
I understand you.

228
00:14:31.021 --> 00:14:33.780
You already said that.
You already said you're not driving.
Are you okay.

229
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.870
All right dude.
Listen,
I'm going to be over here with some friends.
I got to go.

230
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.320
All right.
See you sit down.
Fuck it.
Like half hour later.

231
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:41.940
<v 3>Okay.</v>

232
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.680
<v 0>I'm coming back from taking a piss.</v>

233
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.400
I come back up and he's sitting down where I was sitting.

234
00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.090
<v 3>Okay.</v>

235
00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:52.220
<v 0>And he just good Cevallo Vaga is,
and uh,</v>

236
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.200
he was such his buddy at this point,

237
00:14:54.201 --> 00:14:59.120
he's trying to get them up out of the chair and he refuses to get up or help and

238
00:14:59.121 --> 00:15:00.740
the other guys too drunk to get him out.

239
00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:05.120
So it was like this fucking keystone cop shit of this dude trying to drag his

240
00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:07.880
friend out of the fucking chair and we're all sitting there,

241
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.970
me and like four or five other people looking at them.

242
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.860
We finally just picked our drinks up.

243
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.450
We went to another table and I think it took him another 20 minutes to get them

244
00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:21.710
out of the fucking chair.
Um,
I'll speak at a tip.
Tivo,
everybody

245
00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.970
who's got the Jesus Freak.
We do.

246
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.940
I love all these more on football feds.

247
00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:33.080
Who would think that there's going to be like a quarterback controversy?
Uh,

248
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:38.990
now that we have Tim t buff,
are you forgetting that bill Belichick is a genius.

249
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.520
Okay.
And don't even talk to me telling me he's a fucking cheater.
All right.

250
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.790
I didn't want to hear that shit.
All right.

251
00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:48.470
Unless you're going to fucking take down every other goddamn coach,

252
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.740
including Ole Miss,
the fucking twinkle toes up there in Seattle.
Uh,

253
00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:58.610
Pete Carroll.
Could you look any more honest than fucking Pete Carroll?
Right?

254
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.920
Other than that guy,
he looks like that fucking Mr. Green Gene Guy.
The next door,

255
00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:08.000
Flanders on fucking,
uh,
the Simpsons.
He doesn't have the glasses,

256
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:08.960
but he has that vibe.

257
00:16:08.961 --> 00:16:13.450
Flanders actually looks like William h Macy with John Lennon glasses.
Um,

258
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.040
but I'm saying Pete Carroll's Vibe is that,

259
00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:20.870
but then you look at the shitty day at USC and right before the shit hit the fan

260
00:16:20.871 --> 00:16:22.070
and they were going to get suspended,

261
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.140
he fucking takes off and goes up to Seattle.
Hey,

262
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.010
and what was Pete Carroll guilty of it?

263
00:16:28.011 --> 00:16:32.540
USC doing everything everybody else does at that fucking level.

264
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:38.120
All right,
so all you cont who called bill Belicheck cheaters.
You're morons.

265
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.810
All right.
That's the way the game is played at that level.

266
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:47.750
There's millions of dollars.
There's yachts,
there's whores.

267
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.910
The second that shit is at stake.
Recognition,
legacy,
forget it.

268
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.500
All the rules are out the fucking when they're all being bent.
All right.

269
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.240
So anyways,
this is why the Patriots are going to,
are going,
uh,

270
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.370
if Tim Teebo is ever going to excel in the NFL,

271
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.850
it's going to be with the New England patriots and I'll bring you a one fucking

272
00:17:07.851 --> 00:17:10.070
play and I'll maybe give me an email.
I'll give you a link to it.

273
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:15.780
The reason for it was,
was back with Doug Flutie was playing with us,

274
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.800
not Doug Flutie.
Who the fuck was it?
Who did the pooch kick?

275
00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:26.840
Wait,
wait a minute.
Do I have that wrong?
Am I that old?

276
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.080
What was that def famous fucking play.
We're all of a sudden he fucking came in,

277
00:17:33.081 --> 00:17:34.610
right?
That was with us.

278
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:41.810
Add Jesus Christ.
I'm losing my fucking mind here.
How old am I?

279
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:46.520
All right,
here we go.
Doug Flutie poach.
Kick.

280
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.200
Alright.
Oh,
dramatic yet.

281
00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.520
There you go.
And he gets it.
That was,
it was with a Jesus.

282
00:18:00.521 --> 00:18:02.140
How fucking long did he play?

283
00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:07.440
I saw Doug Flutie when I had season tickets in 1989 when we had the little Paul

284
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:12.850
Rivera on the side of the helmet.
1980 fucking nine.
And he graduated in like 84.

285
00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:14.330
<v 3>Okay.</v>

286
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:17.240
<v 0>He'd already been,
oh,
that was before he went to the CFL.</v>

287
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:21.660
He'd been with Chicago leave,
then he came with us and,
uh,

288
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:23.360
<v 3>okay.</v>

289
00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.590
<v 0>Oh Jesus.
Did I ever tell you that fucking store?</v>

290
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:29.210
I can't believe I'm going to tell this fucking story.
MMM,

291
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:32.240
<v 3>okay.</v>

292
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.440
<v 0>Okay.
When I came out,
what year this was,
it was when Doug Flutie was playing</v>

293
00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:37.550
<v 3>okay.</v>

294
00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:42.440
<v 0>With the buffalo bills.
And I remember,</v>

295
00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:43.520
you know,
that was first,

296
00:18:43.521 --> 00:18:47.450
right around then he had come out and said that he had an autistic child and he

297
00:18:47.451 --> 00:18:51.020
had,
he had the Flutie flakes that was to raise money for autism.

298
00:18:51.021 --> 00:18:54.920
This great thing.
Right.
And,
uh,

299
00:18:54.921 --> 00:18:58.130
so we're in the stands was sitting in the end zone.

300
00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:03.640
It's me,
Bobby Kelly,
and this buddy of mine.

301
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.970
<v 3>Okay.</v>

302
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.790
<v 0>Uh,
one of my old drinking buddies from back in the day.</v>

303
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.070
This is the guy I told you.
You got,

304
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.010
he got into the handshake fight with the Elvis impersonator.

305
00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.420
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

306
00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.130
<v 0>I would tell you that one.
We were in,</v>

307
00:19:16.131 --> 00:19:21.110
daisy Buchanan's a famous meat market on Newbury Street in Boston.
Right.
And,

308
00:19:21.111 --> 00:19:23.840
uh,
you know,
everybody's in their hammered,
right?

309
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.680
Everybody's listening to music and we'll fucking whatever.

310
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.040
It's the middle of the fucking night.

311
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:33.250
So basically every guy in there is probably 50 to 60% on their way to either

312
00:19:36.611 --> 00:19:40.150
getting laid or going home and jerk and off after a slice of pizza.

313
00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:42.080
That's right where the night is.

314
00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.330
But everybody still has hope that they're going to be one of the guys that gets

315
00:19:46.331 --> 00:19:50.200
fucking laid.
All right,
everything's going good.

316
00:19:50.201 --> 00:19:53.440
Music is playing and all that shit.
All of a sudden,
the entire,

317
00:19:53.441 --> 00:19:57.340
you just feel this energy towards the door.
Like what the fuck's going on?

318
00:19:57.341 --> 00:19:58.480
You could feel this commotion.

319
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:05.350
So we fucking look over and there's this guy dressed up as Elvis for no fucking

320
00:20:07.731 --> 00:20:11.180
apparent reason.
It's like the middle of the summer,
you know,

321
00:20:11.181 --> 00:20:15.440
it wasn't the anniversary of his,
of his death.
I don't,
you know,

322
00:20:15.441 --> 00:20:19.760
we weren't Vegas.
I just fucking guy walks in dressed like Elvis.

323
00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:24.590
So all the whole energy of the fucking bar goes over there and every fucking

324
00:20:24.591 --> 00:20:28.400
chicken there wants to go over and get their picture with the guy.

325
00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:33.050
So this dude basically cock blocks the whole fucking bar.

326
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:38.060
Even half the guys are laughing cause he's doing all the karate moves and shit.

327
00:20:38.061 --> 00:20:39.410
It was ridiculous.
It was funny.

328
00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:44.450
But also it was very passive aggressive cause all the pussy went up to him.
So,

329
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:48.070
and half the fucking guys.
So my buddy,

330
00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.270
I was pissed.
I didn't realize he was pissed at them.

331
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.890
So everybody's lining up shaking hands with this Elvis impersonator trying to

332
00:20:56.891 --> 00:20:58.900
get their picture with them and blah blah blah,
blah blah.

333
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.820
So my buddy comes up to him,

334
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:06.260
he comes up to last and he's fucking,
he starts shaking his hand.

335
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.160
And when my buddy worked before he was going to get into a fight,

336
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:12.520
I don't know why he would always be like looking up in the air.
Like,

337
00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:15.160
what's up dude?
What's going on?
Huh?
Rarely,
rarely dude.

338
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.470
And he'd be like looking like straight up in the air,

339
00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.920
which of course he always ended up getting suckered,
but he was a big guy.

340
00:21:20.921 --> 00:21:22.750
So he's usually been able to make a comeback.

341
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:27.130
So he comes walking up to this Elvis impersonator and he starts shaking his hand

342
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.590
and he's looking up.
In the end,
the guy's sitting there going,
well,

343
00:21:29.591 --> 00:21:34.240
salt my uncle soap,
or you do,
man,
we're trying to be Elvis.
And he goes,

344
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.360
and he's like,
what's my buddy's like?
What's up dude?
He goes,
hey,

345
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:42.760
he's still shaking his hand.
He goes,
he goes,
why can't you just be yourself?

346
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.080
Right?

347
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.320
And immediately the Elvis guy is trying to let go of my buddy's head and he

348
00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:50.770
won't let them go.
So now there's kind of squeezing each other's hand.

349
00:21:50.771 --> 00:21:54.810
The guy's going to,
come on,
man,
come on,
let's go.
I got rings.
Oh Man.
Eh,

350
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.850
by buddy just keeps holding his hand.
He goes,
you know,
he goes,

351
00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:00.310
I like Roger Clemens,
because I like the red sox.

352
00:22:00.311 --> 00:22:04.270
You don't see me come in here dressed like Roger Clemens right now.

353
00:22:04.271 --> 00:22:06.400
This shake could fucking hands right in this squeeze.

354
00:22:06.401 --> 00:22:10.120
And now he's looking at this dude right through his stupid gold frame glasses.

355
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:13.330
And the guys going,
all right,
he drops the Elvis Shit gone.
All right,

356
00:22:13.331 --> 00:22:16.090
let go of my hand.
And I'm fucking sitting there going,
oh my God,

357
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.080
I'm going to watch my buddy fight a fucking Elvis impersonator.

358
00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:21.880
This is going to be the greatest thing ever.

359
00:22:21.881 --> 00:22:25.450
And right then the fucking bouncer steps in like,
you know,

360
00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:27.070
when you're watching a hockey game,
you like,

361
00:22:27.071 --> 00:22:30.400
finally these two guys are going to fight and then the fucking raft comes in and

362
00:22:30.401 --> 00:22:34.720
breaks it up and the whole crowd boos,
that's basically what happens.
All right?

363
00:22:34.721 --> 00:22:39.670
So that's the background on this guy.
So we're at this game.
He's a big guy.

364
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.840
He's not the most quick way to Guy Doug Flutie has now come back.
You know,

365
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.340
he would play for the Boston College.
He played for the,
you know,

366
00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:49.780
bears than the New England patriots.
So He's,
he's one of our guys,

367
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:54.310
but now he's playing for the buffalo bills.
The game we're going to,
this is now,

368
00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:58.330
I dunno,
like the fucking,
uh,
like 97,
98 or something.

369
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:03.820
And um,
I think Pete Carroll was coaching Jesus built,
get to this story.

370
00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:07.270
All right,
so every so fluid,
he's warming up in the end zone.
I have now.

371
00:23:07.271 --> 00:23:10.780
Everybody's given Flutie shit even though he's our guide,

372
00:23:10.781 --> 00:23:12.520
but he's piece playing for the other guys now.

373
00:23:12.521 --> 00:23:15.250
So it's like some Johnny Damon Shit,
even though it wasn't his fault.

374
00:23:15.251 --> 00:23:19.600
But you know,
Boston sports fans were assholes.
So everybody's given Flutie shit.

375
00:23:19.601 --> 00:23:22.840
They yell at gay killed a Midget,
a floaty,

376
00:23:22.841 --> 00:23:25.390
get to short all these short jokes or whatever.

377
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:30.310
So my buddy wants to get one in,
all right?

378
00:23:30.311 --> 00:23:34.900
And we have end zone seats.
So we are sitting with a bunch of fucking animals.

379
00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:39.910
So everybody's killed imaginary Flutie a too short or not today.

380
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.150
Douggie you know,
go back to Canada.
You stake,
right?

381
00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:47.240
Everybody giving him shit.
And then my buddy,
he wants to be part of it.

382
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.140
He chimes in,
he kind of stuttered.
He just goes,
he goes,
hey,
hey,

383
00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:56.210
hey floatie,
I hope your kid dies,

384
00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:02.870
dude.
The whole section just goes Ugh,
and just sits down.

385
00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:08.060
It was one that was one of the most fucking evil things.

386
00:24:08.061 --> 00:24:10.580
But you've got to understand why.

387
00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:13.730
It was funny to me was just because I knew,

388
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.880
I knew my buddy and I know how fucking dumb he is.

389
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.550
And I know that he just wanted to be a part of it.

390
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.160
He's just one of those guys who doesn't know where the line is.

391
00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:26.720
You know those guys,
we just go,
hey,
you know,
you start making fun of this shirt.

392
00:24:26.721 --> 00:24:29.450
And they go,
yeah,
at least by mother doesn't have breast cancer.
And you're like,

393
00:24:29.451 --> 00:24:33.230
Jesus Christ,
how the fuck do you go from a shirt to breast cancer?

394
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:38.320
That's basically what he did.
And uh,
I remember what's his,

395
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:43.350
Bobby Kelly was absolutely fucking SPI was speechless.

396
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.333
Fuck,

397
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:52.930
this is one of the few times I've ever seen Bobby is every bit as twisted as I

398
00:24:54.411 --> 00:24:57.320
am.
I,
I'll never forget that he was fucking,
oh,
wait a minute.

399
00:24:57.321 --> 00:25:00.200
What am I talking about?
I've told this story so many times I wasn't,

400
00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.860
I was sitting up a section over Jesus Christ.

401
00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.160
Jesus Christ.
I've told this story so many times.
I've forgotten.
No,

402
00:25:07.161 --> 00:25:11.240
he was sitting there over there.
I was,
I was the next section over.
That's right.

403
00:25:11.241 --> 00:25:15.590
And then Bobby came up to me at the end of the game and told me it.
So wait.

404
00:25:15.591 --> 00:25:16.970
So who else was fucking over there?

405
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:21.960
I can't remember even.
How the fuck are you?
Well,

406
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.780
how did you even get on the fucking story?
Oh,
Flutie that's right.

407
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:31.470
Cheating.
Okay,
let's work our way back.
Bill.
Work your way back.
I Dunno.

408
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.420
Is it time to do some fucking habit?
Yeah.
25 minutes in.
Here we go.

409
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.600

So have you been,

460
00:28:43.981 --> 00:28:46.420
what have you been watching you been watching spurs?
He,

461
00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:50.160
he'd been watching a Bruins Blackhawks.
Either way.

462
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:54.420
Couple of amazing series.
I've blew it yesterday.
I was traveling,

463
00:28:54.421 --> 00:28:56.360
so I missed the San Antonio game.

464
00:28:56.430 --> 00:29:01.430
Obviously thrilled that San Antonio is up three games to two going back to

465
00:29:01.471 --> 00:29:04.470
Miami.
You know,
now you know me,

466
00:29:04.471 --> 00:29:08.370
I love the Celtics and anybody who plays the Lakers,
but um,

467
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:13.340
there's just a douchebag factor to people down in Miami.
We're,

468
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:17.940
let's all go to the game and where,
why,
you know,
and of course it's white.

469
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:23.880
You know that white white is the,
um,
hang on a second.

470
00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:25.500
We know what it is like the,

471
00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:29.610
that's the color that people who want to flaunt that they're rich.

472
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:34.410
Where if he noticed that,
like whenever they do like those,

473
00:29:34.411 --> 00:29:37.590
uh,
those real housewives stories,

474
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:42.070
they always have some ridiculously expensive car.
And it's always,

475
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.010
it's always like,
like,
like Pearl White.

476
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:49.960
I don't know what it is about that.
They love it.
Oh,
out here in,
uh,

477
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:55.120
in La,
all the grownup up he fucking people,

478
00:29:55.121 --> 00:29:58.600
they fucking all have those white cars.
I don't know why.

479
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:02.620
So when I look at those people down in Miami,
it's the same fucking thing,

480
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.790
you know?
What are you showing off your Tan lines?
Even when you're in the car?

481
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.270
I don't understand it.
Where I come from.
You know,
you get a ute,
a black car,

482
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.900
you know,
some gangster look at thing,
he gets some tinted windows on it.

483
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.380
I don't fucking know.
Although I got to tell you,

484
00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.410
I was a big fan of milk trucks back in the day and those are always white.

485
00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:26.120
This podcast is just,
what the fuck am I talking about?
So I'm rooting for,

486
00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:29.680
I'm rooting for San Antonio.
I really,
you got to go for the underdog here.

487
00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.450
You know,
the big fundamental,

488
00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:36.370
the guy cheated on their chick from that fucking show,
right?
The other guy there,

489
00:30:36.371 --> 00:30:39.520
the a bald guy,

490
00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:44.840
Tony Coote coach at,
Oh fuck.
I don't watch hoop.
I Dunno what's going on.
Um,

491
00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:49.720
why don't you stick with what you've been watching,
Bruins,
Blackhawks,
everybody.

492
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:54.400
Uh,
right now if you haven't been watching the series is tied one game to one.

493
00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:59.170
Both went into overtime.
The first one went into triple overtime and uh,

494
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.230
two nights ago it was an overtime when for the Bruins.

495
00:31:02.231 --> 00:31:04.660
And it was kind of weird cause I felt like the Bruins should've won the first

496
00:31:04.661 --> 00:31:09.280
one in the hot shit one.
The second one,
although I missed most of the,
uh,

497
00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:13.720
most of the second game cause I was performing in a buffalo.
But uh,

498
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:18.730
it's a classic man and the Black Hawks that they like the Bros,

499
00:31:18.731 --> 00:31:22.240
man,
they're a fucking hockey team.
You know,
they got their tough guys.

500
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.800
I'd say they have more superstars with Hosa and Patrick Kane.
But,
um,

501
00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.660
they got their past and then they got their grind is man,

502
00:31:31.661 --> 00:31:36.190
they were fucking hockey team.
And,
um,
I really invite,
you know,

503
00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.980
I dunno,
I really liked the way they're playing.
No filthy shit.
You know,

504
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.530
I don't get mad at those,
those guys who,
you know,

505
00:31:44.531 --> 00:31:46.360
just doing shit to try to get an edge,

506
00:31:46.361 --> 00:31:51.130
but nobody's out there trying to hurt anybody and that fucking crap.
Um,

507
00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.330
it's just been two great games and they play again tonight.
Pivotal fucking game.

508
00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:59.620
They have little fucking game.
Um,
so we'll see.

509
00:31:59.621 --> 00:32:00.790
We'll see how the Bruins come out.

510
00:32:00.791 --> 00:32:03.520
I heard they came out real sluggish and game two in the first period and came

511
00:32:03.521 --> 00:32:07.270
out hitting in a second.
Um,
like I said,
I only came out after my show.

512
00:32:07.271 --> 00:32:11.620
I saw halfway,
the last half of the third period and then into the overtime.

513
00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:15.730
But um,
I watched every second of that first one.

514
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:20.350
Um,
and I was,
oh,
it was trying to stay in shape and I was on the road.

515
00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:26.550
So I watched the first three periods and then the first two overtimes I was on

516
00:32:26.951 --> 00:32:28.930
the elliptical.
I basically,

517
00:32:28.931 --> 00:32:32.230
I stayed on the elliptical until there was an intermission.

518
00:32:32.231 --> 00:32:34.570
And then in the intermission I did pushups and dips.

519
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.370
And then coming out of the intermission,

520
00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:39.380
I did the whole fucking did the elliptical again for the next period.

521
00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:41.480
I was actually thinking like,

522
00:32:41.481 --> 00:32:44.450
that's how you should be watching sports instead of sitting there eating fucking

523
00:32:44.451 --> 00:32:48.210
Nachos and drinking beer.
Right.
Um,

524
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:50.001
but,
uh,

525
00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:54.590
I dunno when are you good until I got to tell you the Blackhawks fucking goalie

526
00:32:54.591 --> 00:32:57.500
man is unbelievable.
And the exact way Pie Aa scored is,

527
00:32:57.501 --> 00:33:00.500
I think what we have to do.
The second it hits you stick,
just put it on net.

528
00:33:00.501 --> 00:33:03.460
Because if that guy gets a chance to square up on you,
he,

529
00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:08.480
he's just stopping everything.
The goal tending is top notch,
original six.

530
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.201
That's all I'm going to say.

531
00:33:09.201 --> 00:33:11.540
I really don't have anything bad to say about any of the Blackhawks.

532
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.450
I fucking like all of them.
And uh,

533
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:18.910
I'm hoping it goes seven and I obviously hope that we win,
but,
uh,

534
00:33:18.911 --> 00:33:23.420
they were a great fucking team.
So tune in and check it out.
All right,

535
00:33:23.421 --> 00:33:28.390
let's get to the,
uh,
let's get to the fucking,
um,
the,
the God damn,
uh,

536
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:33.110
whatever questions for the week.
Uh,
uh,
Billy red face tour.
Uh,

537
00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:33.590
William,

538
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:38.090
I used to live in North Dakota and I've been to northern cities on your tour.

539
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.200
If you are planning to drive between gigs,
the country is beautiful,

540
00:33:42.201 --> 00:33:43.850
but the distances are immense.

541
00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:48.650
Wrap your brain around long drives six to eight hours depending on how fast you

542
00:33:48.651 --> 00:33:53.050
drive.
Uh,
I now live in Chicago.
Black Hawks.
Yeah,
dude,

543
00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:56.990
you got to understand,
I've been doing the road hardcore since the late nineties,

544
00:33:56.991 --> 00:34:01.430
so you know,
I could do six hour drives in my sleep,
but I'm also,

545
00:34:01.431 --> 00:34:04.820
I'm taking a bus so it's not going to be a problem.
But,
um,

546
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.560
I'm also beyond excited to do this tour because I have performed in Boise.

547
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.380
I never did the comedy club,
but I did do a college up there.

548
00:34:12.381 --> 00:34:16.070
It wasn't Boise state was something else.
Um,

549
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.610
so I've,
I drove her around a little bit,

550
00:34:19.611 --> 00:34:22.520
but I've never been to Montana and I'm basically going to drive across that

551
00:34:22.521 --> 00:34:26.900
whole state.
I have done,
I've done like Sioux Falls,

552
00:34:26.901 --> 00:34:31.220
South Dakota,
and I've done like Fargo,
North Dakota,

553
00:34:31.221 --> 00:34:33.150
but I've never been to the western part of the state,

554
00:34:33.151 --> 00:34:36.800
so I'm going to be loving life,
um,
when I'm out there.

555
00:34:36.801 --> 00:34:39.440
So I want to see they'll all those cool looking ranches.

556
00:34:39.441 --> 00:34:42.020
I want to see a couple of bison.

557
00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:47.930
I want to see the fucking billboard with before and after pictures about people

558
00:34:47.931 --> 00:34:52.190
on meth.
You know what I mean?
That's like a major fucking problem.

559
00:34:52.191 --> 00:34:54.140
Like I bet you nobody,

560
00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:59.170
I bet the walking dead gets really low ratings out in Montana just because if

561
00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:03.650
they just,
all they need to do is look out the fucking window,
right to see that.

562
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.770
I'm googling right now.
Montana meth problem.

563
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.600
They get meth project,
documentary highlights,

564
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:19.310
Montana's meth problem.
NPR.
NPR was up there.
Yes.

565
00:35:19.311 --> 00:35:23.480
Montana has a meth problem.
Measuring meth in Montana.

566
00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:28.490
Montana.
Meth project news about the Montana meth project.

567
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:32.000
I said they've got a project going on.
Let's read this one here.
Yes,

568
00:35:32.001 --> 00:35:36.710
Montana has a meth problem.
Do you guys really want to hear me read out loud?

569
00:35:36.711 --> 00:35:39.770
You probably don't.
Uh,
I heard that Utah,

570
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:43.170
Colorado have a symbolist situation,
but I don't know who is the leader.

571
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:48.540
Um,
I get tired of arguing the point,
but the facts don't support your post.

572
00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:51.990
I'm not going to present evidence because it's clear.
It would not matter.

573
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.440
I guess he's defending Montana.
I don't fucking know.

574
00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:00.390
It's going to be a great time.
Oh,
you know what?

575
00:36:00.391 --> 00:36:03.600
I never finished talking about that tour that I just did the uh,

576
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:08.360
I went to Cleveland,
Ohio.
All right.
Had a great time.

577
00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:12.440
One of my favorite people in this business,
nick costs this,
owns,
uh,

578
00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:15.530
Pickwick and frolic slash the hilarides comedy club.

579
00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:19.490
And that's where I played from 2004 right on up.

580
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.660
He used to headline me when I could only draw half the fucking room and a half

581
00:36:23.661 --> 00:36:24.980
of those people would just go in there.

582
00:36:24.981 --> 00:36:28.160
Cause Nick had such a great restaurant upstairs and the Martini bar and

583
00:36:28.161 --> 00:36:29.840
everything.
Um,

584
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:34.940
and when nick bought in to that part of the,
uh,
the city,

585
00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.100
you know,
there was nobody there like I,
it was just crap.

586
00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:42.650
You got to go in there.
It's like a five star restaurant.

587
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:47.690
They got a live show with these,
these dancing girls downstairs in a Martini bar.

588
00:36:47.691 --> 00:36:51.040
And then he has this beautiful showroom with a balcony.
It's,

589
00:36:51.041 --> 00:36:55.100
it's absolutely gorgeous place.
And um,

590
00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.060
so he built this thing when they would,

591
00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:03.110
when Cleveland was just after 5:00 PM became a ghost town and you'd be in there,

592
00:37:03.111 --> 00:37:06.440
you felt like you were on the fucking titanic except it never sank.
Right.

593
00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.030
You're just on this luxury liner.
There was,
he didn't have to leave.
You ate,

594
00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.430
you had this great meal,
you did your show and then when you walked out,

595
00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:17.930
there was all these beautiful women in this Martini bar was the self sustaining

596
00:37:17.931 --> 00:37:22.250
unit,
this fucking oasis.
But the second,
the night ended,

597
00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:26.480
the cop would literally escort me out of the place and would walk me over to my

598
00:37:26.481 --> 00:37:31.100
hotel so I wouldn't get clubbed over the head by a piece of pipe that was

599
00:37:31.101 --> 00:37:36.080
probably laying right in the street.
And uh,
he was the only game in town,

600
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:38.180
especially on the block that he was on.

601
00:37:38.181 --> 00:37:40.380
And he was kind of like a third of the way up the block.

602
00:37:40.381 --> 00:37:44.000
So he's really hidden and he was having a rough go of trying to get the thing

603
00:37:44.001 --> 00:37:46.220
going.
And uh,

604
00:37:46.221 --> 00:37:49.610
over the years I watched like the House of Blues opened up across the street,

605
00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:55.100
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Fast forward to now,
nine years later,
you know,
I'm in town,

606
00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:58.100
I'm doing this theater right down the street and I'm like,
I got to go see next.

607
00:37:58.101 --> 00:38:03.101
So I go over there to go get some dinner before the show and I'm coming up the

608
00:38:03.231 --> 00:38:07.550
street and it's just a mob scene.
It's just like outdoor,

609
00:38:07.551 --> 00:38:10.790
everybody's outdoor cafes is this guy playing acoustic guitar,

610
00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:16.250
like hired by this restaurant,
house of Blues is this line up the street.
Um,

611
00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.970
he's just the greatest fucking guy.
So I went over there,

612
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:25.190
I had dinner and then I went,
uh,
I did my show,
I had a great time,

613
00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:28.640
you know,
went out,
took pictures,
signed DVDs and all that shit.

614
00:38:28.641 --> 00:38:33.620
And then we had the after party over at his Martini bar cause I wanted to drive

615
00:38:33.621 --> 00:38:36.810
some business his way and I want to thank everybody.
Seriously,
man,

616
00:38:36.811 --> 00:38:39.850
there's no bullshit.
Everybody came over there.
If you spent $1 over there,

617
00:38:39.851 --> 00:38:44.560
that's one of my great friends,
uh,
in business and in life.

618
00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:47.770
So I really appreciate it.
And if you ever seriously in the Cleveland area,

619
00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:50.920
you want to see a great show,
just have a great meal.
Go down to the,
uh,

620
00:38:50.921 --> 00:38:54.060
the Pickwick and frolic romantic guys the best and it cost to sale.

621
00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:57.990
Tell him I said what's up?
So anyways,
back to the,
uh,

622
00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:02.890
back to the reeds here.
When the fuck are they?
And the worst.

623
00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.620
All right,
no subject on this one.
Bill.

624
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:09.190
Your problem with Christianity is that you are in the wrong church.

625
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:13.900
Just switch over to the episcopal episcopal or Lutheran or something and get

626
00:39:13.901 --> 00:39:16.840
baptized and all of a sudden you'll receive the Holy Spirit,

627
00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:22.110
which will bring you to a higher spiritual level with a literal connection to

628
00:39:22.391 --> 00:39:26.710
God.
Uh,
all right.
You know something,

629
00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:32.380
I'm sure every religion has.
It's a,

630
00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:34.600
has something to offer.

631
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.050
You know what it is about episcopal or Lutheran is I'm lazy.

632
00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.240
I already know you can't teach an old dog new tricks.
Okay.

633
00:39:43.241 --> 00:39:46.060
I know the prayers and I know the songs from my fucking,

634
00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.560
this would be like me moving to La and not being a Celtics fan anymore and

635
00:39:50.561 --> 00:39:53.140
switching over to the clippers,
you know,

636
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.540
not saying you bought the clippers are actually decent now,
so I can't,

637
00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:57.850
I'm not really insulting you,
but uh,
yeah.

638
00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.400
Tell me some more about the episcopal in our Lutheran thing.

639
00:40:00.401 --> 00:40:03.310
Cause I actually always enjoyed going to church as far as,

640
00:40:03.311 --> 00:40:07.750
I felt like it was a reset thing every week to remind yourself not to be a

641
00:40:07.751 --> 00:40:12.250
complete hunk of shit or at least try not to be for as long as you could until

642
00:40:12.251 --> 00:40:17.230
the next mass.
But I just never liked all the other crap that was involved in it.

643
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:22.240
Um,
but as far as me receiving the Holy Spirit,

644
00:40:22.241 --> 00:40:26.170
which will bring me to a higher spiritual level and a little connection to God,

645
00:40:26.171 --> 00:40:30.700
like I can really do that on my own,
you know,
if I want it to,

646
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.680
if I really,
if I wasn't such a piece of shit,
if I really just,
I,

647
00:40:35.681 --> 00:40:40.240
you don't really need to go down there and do all the old law Selema that's all

648
00:40:40.241 --> 00:40:41.140
just,
you know,

649
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:46.440
rituals and I blessed the water and I throw it in your face and now the evil

650
00:40:48.491 --> 00:40:50.590
spirits or out of years,
but it's complete horse shit.

651
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:53.470
You could splash me with as much holy water as you want to.

652
00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.510
If I don't give a fuck and I want to go out and just do stuff,

653
00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:01.300
the water is not going to like fix me,
you know?
Oh,

654
00:41:01.301 --> 00:41:04.420
bill stopped being a cunt swing by,
you know what?
I'm going to go to one.

655
00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:10.810
I go to Lutheran.
Episcopals too hard to say.
Um,

656
00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:16.601
I dunno man.

657
00:41:16.601 --> 00:41:20.790
I get weirded out when I go in those fucking places and then behave and he

658
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.580
showed up in everybody grab hands.
It just makes me feel all douchey.

659
00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.110
Um,
all right.
Freedom built.

660
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:33.100
Please don't talk about freedom when you are over there.
Over where?

661
00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:39.700
Well,
why don't you fucking,
I'll,
okay,
here we go.

662
00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:43.240
This guy's gonna Trash America,
right bill,
please don't talk about freedom.

663
00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:47.830
When you people over there don't have the freedom to decide whether you want

664
00:41:47.831 --> 00:41:50.680
half your dick cut off or not.

665
00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.640
The way women in Africa don't have the freedom decide whether they want half

666
00:41:54.641 --> 00:41:57.490
their vagina cutoff or not.
They don't cut off their vagina.

667
00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:00.370
You ignorant dump Twat.

668
00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:05.640
All you American country Americans do is talk about freedom because you have

669
00:42:06.281 --> 00:42:08.890
none.
Um,
you know what sir?

670
00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.880
You sound as ignorant as what you're making fun of.
So congratulations.

671
00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:18.130
Welcome to the quad,
sir.
When did I talk about freedom?

672
00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:21.370
I don't even remember talking about that,
sir.
You know,

673
00:42:21.371 --> 00:42:25.270
half the Shit I talk about.
I'm just trying to fill up an hour here.
All right,

674
00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:30.610
Americans,
was that your best one?
Did you have a list?

675
00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.770
Can he come up with something a little bit better?
You know,
Americans,

676
00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:35.200
you're trashing all the Americas,

677
00:42:35.201 --> 00:42:38.410
so you basically trashing this whole half of the half of the,
uh,

678
00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:42.190
the world.
You do realize that these are the Americas,

679
00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:45.130
North America and South America.
All right?

680
00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.840
And you're calling me a dumb [inaudible].
They don't,

681
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:50.500
they don't fucking cut off half the vagina.
They remove the clitoris there.

682
00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:56.060
You know,
how exactly do they do that?
I don't even want to know.

683
00:42:56.061 --> 00:43:00.870
It's fucking disgusting.
Um,
well what is he talking about?

684
00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.720
Aren't the guy every week.
I'm talking about bankers.

685
00:43:02.721 --> 00:43:06.890
How they got everybody by the balls sturdy.
You listened to this thing.
All right,

686
00:43:06.891 --> 00:43:09.590
we're just going to move on.
You know what you are.
You're basically,
that was the,

687
00:43:09.591 --> 00:43:13.370
uh,
the email version of that guy who kept saying Tivo to me.
All right,

688
00:43:13.371 --> 00:43:17.030
my car is shit.
Hey billion.

689
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:19.460
I'm a high school student in Arkansas.

690
00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:25.310
Razorbacks sec and my car is pure shit.
The pain is blotchy.

691
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:29.570
Do this isn't pimp my ride.
What are you think I'm going to do?

692
00:43:29.571 --> 00:43:32.240
Fucking get over there and have somebody come in a

693
00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:38.030
put a flat screen TV and your trunk.
Uh,
the paint is blotchy and fading.

694
00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:39.410
The interior is shit.

695
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.950
The air conditioner doesn't work and there's a ton of stickers on the back from

696
00:43:42.951 --> 00:43:46.520
the previous owner.
It's actually embarrassing anytime a person,

697
00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:51.350
especially girls see it.
So how do I get over my shitty car?
Also,

698
00:43:51.351 --> 00:43:54.620
your podcast has not only helped me relieve the stress from school,

699
00:43:54.621 --> 00:43:59.330
but it gets me through class if I'm having a slow day.
All right?

700
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:04.520
What you got to do is you have to embrace your shitty car,
you know,

701
00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.590
takes a certain swagger to drive a shitty car.

702
00:44:09.591 --> 00:44:12.950
You've got to have a sense of humor about it.
You know,

703
00:44:12.951 --> 00:44:16.580
if somebody trashes your car,
just uh,
just,
you know,
you can do one or two things.

704
00:44:16.581 --> 00:44:18.800
Either agree with them or just be like,
how dare you?

705
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:22.070
How dare you trashed at that.
Right.
There was a classic,

706
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.970
that's an original condition.
All right?

707
00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.470
Or whatever the F I don't know what the fuck to do.

708
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:30.620
You can take the bumper stickers off.
You know what?

709
00:44:30.621 --> 00:44:33.180
You could throw some rims on it.
You know what?
Fuck that.

710
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.130
Don't don't put rims on a piece of shit car.

711
00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.160
This is the biggest thing that I would say.
All right.

712
00:44:40.161 --> 00:44:43.930
If you're trying to get a lady
right,
you're in college,

713
00:44:43.931 --> 00:44:46.360
everybody understands you're going to be broke.
What I would do,

714
00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:51.250
you got to make sure the inside of the car is clean.
Spend some money,

715
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:55.510
get that fucker steam cleaned and get some fucking air fresheners.
So it's,
it's,

716
00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:00.580
it smells.
All right.
All right.
You could probably take off the bumper sticker.

717
00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:05.170
You can get a $99 fucking paint job every fucking state you go to.

718
00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:09.940
There's some content on TV talking about a $99 paint job,
you know,

719
00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:14.020
pick a dark color,
you know,
that usually will,
uh,

720
00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:18.220
I dunno,
maybe paint over the other shit.
Well,
I don't know much about paint.

721
00:45:18.221 --> 00:45:23.200
I have no idea.
Maybe you'll be all right.
What kind of car is it,
sir?

722
00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.160
If you could help me out with what kind of car you have,
uh,

723
00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:30.400
maybe I can help you out.
I Dunno.
Listen,

724
00:45:30.401 --> 00:45:33.070
I drove in 83 Ford Ranger two wheel drive,

725
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:38.460
five speed amfm fucking radio.
It just was a mess.

726
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:42.300
And I finally put a nice stereo in there and somebody smashed the window,

727
00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:47.450
ripped up the fucking plastic like dashboard and yanked the radio out.

728
00:45:47.701 --> 00:45:50.730
And I didn't have room for another one that had this gaping fucking hole with

729
00:45:50.731 --> 00:45:53.400
wires hanging out and uh,

730
00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.140
and I wasn't getting any pussy.
There you go,
sir.
You know what,

731
00:45:58.141 --> 00:46:01.940
I've come around to your side.
I see what the problem is.
Uh,

732
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:07.270
you know what?
I would go to campus parties and try to go back to her dorm room.

733
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:13.950
Just avoid the whole car thing,
the whole car situation or you know something.

734
00:46:13.951 --> 00:46:17.010
If you meet a girl that you really liked,
just admit to it and just say,
listen,

735
00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:21.450
I gotta I gotta tell you something before we go to my car.
My car is,

736
00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:26.070
it's a mess and it's really embarrassing.
I'm really self conscious about it,

737
00:46:26.071 --> 00:46:27.260
but blog just own up to it.

738
00:46:27.261 --> 00:46:30.230
Girls love that because then that kicks into the motherly thing.
They go,
oh,

739
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:35.060
that's okay.
I don't think it's that pad.
And next thing you know that blowing.

740
00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:38.640
Yeah.
So they just make sure it smells okay.

741
00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:41.730
That's the biggest thing about women.

742
00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:43.800
When you're younger and you don't have any fucking money,

743
00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:47.430
if he just make a fucking effort,
you know,

744
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:50.690
have you fight.
If you're going out,

745
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:54.530
just make sure in case you get lucky cleanup you fucking room.

746
00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:59.090
Don't have dirty laundry laying all over the place.
Make the fucking bed,

747
00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:03.440
get a couple of scented candles,
all that Hacky Shit,
you know,

748
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:09.160
and for the love of God when you get in there,
do not have overhead lighting.

749
00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:13.600
There's nothing women hate more than fucking overhead.

750
00:47:13.601 --> 00:47:17.170
Lighting as a middle aged guys like me is you're balding.

751
00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:19.060
You really start to hate overhead lighting,

752
00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:24.910
<v 4>but</v>

753
00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:29.440
<v 0>well,
you know women,
they fucking hate overhead lighting.
All right,</v>

754
00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:34.660
self.
You have overhead lighting.
Go out and buy.
Invest in a fucking,
just a,

755
00:47:34.661 --> 00:47:39.630
just a fucking bedside reading lamp or whatever and then buy some cool fucking,

756
00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.860
I know this is how I keep,
but just call some cool fabric.

757
00:47:41.861 --> 00:47:43.060
If you can throw it over the top,

758
00:47:43.061 --> 00:47:46.750
gives it more of a fucking Softlight little mood.
Next,
he know a Teddy's around.

759
00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:51.850
You got some skills,
you know,
you fucking rounded second and the rest is on you.

760
00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.850
Okay.
There you go.
All right.
The royal family.
Everybody.

761
00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:00.190
Um,
this one says,
Bill,
I'm curious about your feelings on the royal.
Oh wait,

762
00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:00.881
I got it back up.

763
00:48:00.881 --> 00:48:04.600
I remember the first time I brought a girl back when I was in New York and I

764
00:48:04.601 --> 00:48:05.830
didn't,
I didn't have shit.

765
00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:09.820
I had my fucking couch when my dad's dental office in the early seventies floral

766
00:48:09.821 --> 00:48:13.420
pattern made out of wood debt.
Like I swear to God,

767
00:48:13.421 --> 00:48:14.890
you could fucking kill a village.

768
00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:18.630
You could club people to death with this couches.
Like it,

769
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.670
it took like three people to bring it in.
Um,

770
00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:23.060
<v 4>okay.</v>

771
00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:25.130
<v 0>And all I had was the,
Oh,
I had overhead lighting.</v>

772
00:48:25.131 --> 00:48:28.250
I had a light bulb would nothing even covering that.

773
00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:31.040
And I had this old fixture that you'd turn it on.

774
00:48:31.041 --> 00:48:34.280
It would make this like you slapped somebody in the face when you turned it,

775
00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:36.980
when you turned it on.
And,
uh,

776
00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:41.490
we were just sitting there and like,
I can't,

777
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:45.270
it was like we was sitting next to the sun and that was when I first learned

778
00:48:45.271 --> 00:48:48.800
about overhead lighting and
you know,

779
00:48:48.801 --> 00:48:51.330
I made my move and everything and I was like two minutes.
And she,

780
00:48:51.331 --> 00:48:54.890
she was just like,
all right,
wait,
wait.
Can we just like,
just wait a second?

781
00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:57.410
And she goes,
I need to fix something.

782
00:48:57.411 --> 00:49:00.020
And she went in and I had my bedroom door was open.

783
00:49:00.021 --> 00:49:02.930
What she did was she turned on the light in there that was also overhead

784
00:49:02.931 --> 00:49:04.910
lighting,
but it was another rumble way.

785
00:49:04.911 --> 00:49:09.230
And then she went and she turned off the light in the living room.

786
00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:13.970
And guess what I did the next day I went out and I bought a fucking lamp.

787
00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.253
<v 4>There you go.</v>

788
00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:25.020
<v 0>That's my limp story.
Everybody.
Okay.
Uh,</v>

789
00:49:25.021 --> 00:49:26.800
the Royal Family Bill A,

790
00:49:26.801 --> 00:49:30.900
I'm curious about your feelings on the royal family and the Brits occupation of

791
00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:31.740
Northern Ireland.

792
00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:35.580
Looking forward to seeing you in September at the Chicago theater.

793
00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:38.100
Go hawks a Bruins.

794
00:49:38.101 --> 00:49:43.020
Remind me of a bunch of Prince Charles is on skates and now they don't,

795
00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:44.820
you know,
I really hate when fucking people,

796
00:49:44.821 --> 00:49:48.840
like those are two great fucking games and then your team wins and then you

797
00:49:48.841 --> 00:49:53.130
texted me bro,
and suck or suck it,
you know,
those fucking morons.
That's why,

798
00:49:53.131 --> 00:49:53.341
you know,

799
00:49:53.341 --> 00:49:56.580
I've kind of stopped tweeting about sports on my Twitter page because it

800
00:49:56.581 --> 00:49:56.941
literally,

801
00:49:56.941 --> 00:50:01.941
it was turning into the exact reason why I don't go to a sports bar because of

802
00:50:02.131 --> 00:50:04.980
all just the fee all day,
all day,

803
00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:11.690
you know,
that type of shit.
And it's always the most unathletic fucking moron.

804
00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:15.900
Can't even talk about the game.
Just complete shit head.
So,
uh,

805
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:20.910
I dunno,
I've kind of toned down the Twitter,
the Twitter in there.
Um,

806
00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:25.650
my feelings on the royal family and the Brits occupation of Northeast Ireland

807
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:30.580
now obviously I don't think they should be,
it's not that fucking place.
You know,

808
00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:32.620
I actually learned all that shit about the whiskey.

809
00:50:32.621 --> 00:50:35.230
Now I've been drinking Jamison this whole fucking time,

810
00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:38.890
which I guess is from Northern Ireland.
So I guess that's the sellout whiskey.

811
00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:41.590
If you're in Ireland and you supposed to be drinking powers,

812
00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:43.180
but I can't find powers anywhere.

813
00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:44.820
<v 2>Okay.</v>

814
00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:49.610
<v 0>Jamison is marker did really well.
That's like the Pepsi,
a Whiskey I guess.
Um,</v>

815
00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:53.420
I don't fucking though.
Should they be there?
I don't.
I don't think so.

816
00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:56.810
I don't understand why they haven't left yet.

817
00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:00.520
They've left pretty much everywhere else.

818
00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:05.440
They got beaten back pretty much everywhere else.
India,

819
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:08.170
Hong Kong,
Rwanda,

820
00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:13.810
the United States of America.
They've been beaten back.
Falkland Islands.

821
00:51:13.811 --> 00:51:17.860
They held on to that one.
You know what they like?
They like,
uh,

822
00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:22.270
the royal family's like tiger woods after his divorce,
you know,

823
00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:27.250
lost a ton of shit,
but still as money,
you know.

824
00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:30.820
Other than that,
I don't mind them.
I don't mind that,
that Prince Guy,

825
00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:33.820
whatever his fucking name is the blond guy.

826
00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:36.313
<v 2>Okay.</v>

827
00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:40.810
<v 0>Harry Harry looks like a cunt though.
He does.
He's got that.</v>

828
00:51:40.811 --> 00:51:43.760
He's got bully face.
I don't know if it's cause all those freckles or whatever,

829
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:46.580
but he just looks like the kind of kid that would just fucking punch you in the

830
00:51:46.581 --> 00:51:51.140
side of the head for no reason.
Uh,
is all the brother looks a little soft though,

831
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:55.790
you know,
probably artistic.
I don't know shit about them to be honest with you.

832
00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:00.560
You guys seem to like him.
So God,
God bless you.
Continue.

833
00:52:00.561 --> 00:52:04.570
Continue to pay attention to them.
Are they like your Kennedy's and the,

834
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:07.640
there's so much inner fucking breeding going on that they all kind of have the

835
00:52:07.641 --> 00:52:11.270
same face.
Just like the Kennedy's Kennedys.

836
00:52:11.271 --> 00:52:16.160
All easy as you see the fucking teeth on that family.
Uh,

837
00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:21.410
okay.
Lost it to a famous guy.
Bill.
My name is Jessica.
Holy Shit.

838
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:24.650
I'll
finally writes in.

839
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:29.000
I'm 20 and I live in Miami.
Great.
I've already trashed Miami here.
Okay.

840
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:34.030
So about a year ago I was vacationing in D R is that Dominican Republic?

841
00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:41.390
Uh,
I dunno.
And I met a famous person and ended up sleeping with him.

842
00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:44.780
Dominican Republic.
I'm going to guess it was a baseball player.

843
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:49.190
Did you fuck Sammy Sosa?
Um,
he goes,

844
00:52:49.191 --> 00:52:53.090
he's not very famous in the u s Oh,
okay.

845
00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:58.400
Only in Latin America.
All right.
Ricky Martin's gay.

846
00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:01.083
<v 2>Okay.</v>

847
00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:05.660
<v 0>Uh,
oh.
Is that one of those,
is that the guy that j Lo is married to?</v>

848
00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:09.580
I don't fucking know.
All right,
let's,
let's plow ahead here.
Point of this story.

849
00:53:09.581 --> 00:53:12.830
Stories that ever since that night we've kept in touch and I've already seen him

850
00:53:12.831 --> 00:53:17.150
three times since then.
It is really interesting.
She goes,

851
00:53:17.151 --> 00:53:19.220
I've seen him every time he comes to Miami.

852
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:23.840
Is this great be like a hot chick you can like bang famous fucking people,

853
00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:28.780
you know,
and just not just be like working at Kinko's,

854
00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:34.090
but you're hot and you can like bang somebody that you saw in a movie,
you know,

855
00:53:34.091 --> 00:53:37.660
as a guy,
he just,
we just don't have that option.
You know?

856
00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:41.560
Good looking guy.
You work in a Kentucky Fried Chicken.

857
00:53:41.561 --> 00:53:45.760
The he think you're going to Bang Olivia Wilde that I don't think so.
Um,

858
00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:49.000
the last time I saw him was this past April.

859
00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:53.530
We usually go out to clubs while he's here and I've even met some of his famous

860
00:53:53.531 --> 00:53:55.750
friends.
I'm just a regular girl.

861
00:53:55.751 --> 00:53:58.480
So you can imagine how infatuated I am with this guy.

862
00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:03.310
I am infatuated with this story.
Um,
she goes,

863
00:54:03.311 --> 00:54:05.710
he's the only person I've ever slept with.

864
00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:09.100
So you could imagine the amount of emotion I've invested in this.

865
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:13.780
Please tell me you made a music condom with his around the world.

866
00:54:13.781 --> 00:54:17.140
Dick,
sorry,
not trying to ruin the romance there.

867
00:54:17.141 --> 00:54:20.900
Just run a little bit of reality.
Um,
I've always get,

868
00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:24.550
I always get sad because I know that things are probably not going to work out

869
00:54:24.551 --> 00:54:27.640
in my favor besides the fact that he is famous.

870
00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.650
He also lives in a different country than me.

871
00:54:29.651 --> 00:54:34.420
He's 10 years older than me and has a child.
Well,
that's game set.
Match,
right?

872
00:54:34.421 --> 00:54:37.180
This sweetheart,
I think you've got to protect your heart and uh,

873
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:41.890
either put him in a place mentally where you're not going to develop feelings

874
00:54:41.891 --> 00:54:46.000
and when it comes to town,
you get to have a fun time.
Um,

875
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:51.010
but other than that,
when he leaves,
I would try and find somebody,
you know,

876
00:54:51.011 --> 00:54:54.760
that at least lives in this hemisphere.
I don't know,
but h your life.
All right.

877
00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:58.060
He goes,
I have hoped that her relationship,
she goes,

878
00:54:58.061 --> 00:55:02.950
I hope that our relationship could happen because I've been lucky enough to have

879
00:55:02.951 --> 00:55:07.300
so much
to have.
So much has happened already.

880
00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:10.810
In addition,
he has plans to move to Miami soon.

881
00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:16.630
We talk once a month or every couple of weeks through text.
Well listen,

882
00:55:16.631 --> 00:55:18.310
he might just be stringing you along.

883
00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:19.933
<v 2>MMM.</v>

884
00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:26.070
<v 0>So I would be like,
look,
I'm starting to develop feelings for ea and uh,</v>

885
00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.850
you know,
I kinda got to cut it off here to protect myself,

886
00:55:29.851 --> 00:55:34.420
but if you move to Miami then we can pick up where we left off.
Sound good?

887
00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:40.060
All.
Ah,
all right.
That's all as Hillel,
right?

888
00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:41.950
Whatever she,
she goes,

889
00:55:41.951 --> 00:55:45.340
we talk once a month or every couple of weeks through text.

890
00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:50.260
Only thing is I'm usually the one that takes the initiative to text him or see

891
00:55:50.261 --> 00:55:53.740
him while he's here,
which really bugs me a,
yeah.
You know what?
I can't,

892
00:55:53.741 --> 00:55:55.270
I don't even need to read the rest of this.

893
00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:57.910
I'll blow through the rest of that same time.

894
00:55:57.911 --> 00:56:00.100
He always shows interest in me and when we spend time together,

895
00:56:00.101 --> 00:56:03.370
remembers everything.
Yeah.
You might just be his woman in that,
in that town.

896
00:56:03.371 --> 00:56:04.870
I hate to tell you,
she goes,

897
00:56:04.871 --> 00:56:07.360
should I hope for relationship with this guy given everything that's happened

898
00:56:07.361 --> 00:56:08.500
already?
No,
you shouldn't.

899
00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:11.890
Should I stop talking to him since I am the one that takes the initiative most

900
00:56:11.891 --> 00:56:16.420
of the time?
Or should I be content with the situation?
Uh,
yeah,

901
00:56:16.421 --> 00:56:20.970
he's stringing you along.
He's stringing you along.
Um,

902
00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:25.480
I don't think he's a bad guy,
but yours is a,

903
00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:29.760
your his woman in Miami.
So,
um,

904
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:32.950
sounds like you want more than that.
So

905
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:39.160
as much as this glamorous life is interesting to you,
in the end,

906
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:42.790
it sounds like you're going to get hurt.
If I had to guess,
if I had to guess,

907
00:56:42.791 --> 00:56:45.220
it sounds like you're going to get hurt.
So I would,
uh,

908
00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:51.340
I would just add that,
you know,
just stop texting the guy,

909
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:57.020
you know,
that's what I would do.
Just stop texting him and just be like,
hey,

910
00:56:57.021 --> 00:57:00.410
you know,
when you,
when your shiny watch come back to Miami,

911
00:57:00.411 --> 00:57:03.440
if I'm not in a relationship,
but you want to hang out down at the ground,
Rod,

912
00:57:03.441 --> 00:57:08.170
let's,
uh,
let's fucking do it.
But other than that,
you know what,

913
00:57:08.171 --> 00:57:09.080
don't you fucking

914
00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:15.550
enjoy the world and the pussy that it has to offer.
Right?

915
00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:19.610
I'm sorry,
I might've been a little crass here,
but that's basically,

916
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:22.180
that's basically the situation.
All right.

917
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:27.430
We had a long,
I've,
I've tried the long distance relationship thing.

918
00:57:27.431 --> 00:57:32.080
It didn't end up working out.
Uh,
you know,
I dunno.

919
00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:35.580
So anyways,
that's the podcast for this week.
Everybody,
I'll,
how far into the Sam?

920
00:57:35.581 --> 00:57:39.700
I have 55 minutes.
55 minutes.

921
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:42.460
All right,
well before I go,

922
00:57:42.461 --> 00:57:45.400
I want to thank everybody who came out to all my shows in a,

923
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:50.650
out there in buffalo of do,
I didn't even talk about Buffalo.
I played this a,

924
00:57:50.651 --> 00:57:54.850
the symphony hall.
Beautiful,
beautiful symphony hall,

925
00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.870
unbelievable crowd and all of that.
And,
um,

926
00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:03.250
I had a lot of people from Toronto came over asking me when I'm going to be in

927
00:58:03.251 --> 00:58:07.570
Canada.
And the answer to that is,
I hate to say it's going to be next March.

928
00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:11.800
I know,
I know what the fuck I,
it was supposed to be this summer,

929
00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:16.150
but I dunno,
we just felt like the summertime,
it's always snowing up there.

930
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:17.410
You can finally go outside.

931
00:58:17.411 --> 00:58:20.260
Why are you going to sit inside and watch some red cunt like me on stage?

932
00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:24.220
We can go out and go water skiing or whatever the fuck it is you do up there.
So,

933
00:58:24.221 --> 00:58:29.170
and also just figured I'd have a better chance on getting on some radio stations

934
00:58:29.171 --> 00:58:31.840
if it was hockey season,
be another angle to sell him a,

935
00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:36.420
a comedian first time touring Canada.
He's a big hockey fan,
Bruins fan.

936
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:38.830
He can come in and hang with you.
When he told Talk Sports,

937
00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:40.270
sort of a marketing thing.

938
00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:45.550
I was pushing for January and then we got worried about flights with the snow

939
00:58:45.551 --> 00:58:48.970
and all this shit up there.
And uh,
I know you're like,
what the fuck?

940
00:58:48.971 --> 00:58:53.971
But you can't run a string of dates together flying into the middle of a

941
00:58:54.281 --> 00:58:57.190
shitstorm cause you'll end up missing a date.
And I don't want to deal with that.

942
00:58:57.191 --> 00:58:58.690
So we've decided on,
on March,

943
00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:03.220
I'm going to hit all the hockey cities and possibly a couple of more depending

944
00:59:03.221 --> 00:59:04.600
on how tickets sales go.

945
00:59:05.050 --> 00:59:07.570
And I'm going to start doing these like more of these mini tours,

946
00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:11.770
like the red face tour.
By the way,
tickets are selling,

947
00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:15.130
they're selling like hot cakes.
So,
uh,

948
00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:19.600
what do I got here?
Coming up?
Uh,
yeah,

949
00:59:19.601 --> 00:59:22.100
the 28th through August 3rd.

950
00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:23.440
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

951
00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:27.640
<v 0>No,
it's not 28,
27,
26,
July 26 through August 3rd.</v>

952
00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:30.190
Uh,
for those of you haven't been listened this past week,

953
00:59:30.191 --> 00:59:34.570
I'm going to be hitting,
doing shows in the states of Idaho,
Montana,

954
00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:39.160
South Dakota,
Kansas,
Colorado,

955
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:42.300
western Texas.
And uh,

956
00:59:42.370 --> 00:59:47.080
I got a private show and a New Mexico.
So,

957
00:59:47.110 --> 00:59:50.500
um,
I got that whole tour set up.

958
00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:55.210
I'm working on a European tour and so far I know we got London,

959
00:59:55.211 --> 01:00:00.211
we got something in Scotland and Amsterdam and I imagine I'm going to do all the

960
01:00:00.491 --> 01:00:01.870
Scandinavian countries.

961
01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:02.960
<v 3>Okay.</v>

962
01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:07.580
<v 0>And then probably all the way over and to Helsinki do,
I'll do Ireland.</v>

963
01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:11.630
I'm hoping to do Ireland,
Scotland,
uh,
England,

964
01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:15.320
Amsterdam,
and then hit Copenhagen,
Oslo,

965
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:18.920
Stockholm and Helsinki.
Um,

966
01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:22.010
that's what I would love to do.
And then,
I dunno,

967
01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:26.720
I mean they're going to go after I do all that and I make some money or
whatever.

968
01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:31.670
I'm going to fucking either go down to Italy and eat like a fucking pig or I'm

969
01:00:31.671 --> 01:00:35.270
going to go to Paris,
uh,
go over to France.

970
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:39.410
I wanted to go to like Francis something like,
cause I,
I took French.

971
01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.153
<v 3>Okay.</v>

972
01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:46.080
<v 0>I tried French for a long time when I was in a high school and I was always into</v>

973
01:00:46.081 --> 01:00:50.360
the Tour de France.
I'd always watch the tennis Roland Garros.

974
01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:56.310
Um,
I dunno,
I was a big World War II buffs there for a minute.

975
01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.040
<v 3>Okay.</v>

976
01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.890
<v 0>And then,
you know,
all the d day stuff,
there's so much,</v>

977
01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:04.670
there's so much that I want to see in France alone.

978
01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.030
You know,
I want to see the beaches of Normandy.

979
01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:12.500
I want to go to the memorial cemetery.
I want to go to the French Open.

980
01:01:12.501 --> 01:01:16.370
I want to go to the Tour de France.
I want to go to Paris.
You know,

981
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:20.480
I want to ride a bike in Paris.
Why not write,
edit twinkle toes,

982
01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:25.010
put on a fucking baret big loaf of French bread coming out of my backpack.

983
01:01:25.070 --> 01:01:25.903
You know,

984
01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:29.750
wearing those pants that don't fit down on my fucking ankles and a striped shirt

985
01:01:29.751 --> 01:01:31.400
on.
Grow a little stupid mustache.

986
01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:37.730
Why not right then I want to go over to fuck in,
uh,
Italy.

987
01:01:37.731 --> 01:01:38.810
These are all dreams of mine.

988
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:44.950
I want to go to Italy and I want to somehow learn enough Italian and start

989
01:01:45.591 --> 01:01:48.950
people over there arguing about who makes the better,
whatever the dishes,

990
01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:52.280
and then let me be the judge.
And then I sit there and eat like a fucking king.

991
01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:59.360
I want to do that.
I want to go to Belgium and drink some booze.

992
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:01.760
I ran into somebody on the road,

993
01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:05.740
told me they got trapped over in Belgium one time because it was snowing and I,

994
01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:09.770
and they just sat there drinking beer all night and uh,

995
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:11.750
stepping outside every once in a while,

996
01:02:11.751 --> 01:02:15.980
just look into this beautiful snow in the city and I literally could see it and

997
01:02:15.981 --> 01:02:20.530
I was just like,
I want to fucking do that.
So,
um,
I don't know.

998
01:02:20.531 --> 01:02:24.210
Trying to expand the horizons yet,
people.
And next year,

999
01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:27.600
so next year I got the Canadian tour and then also I'm going to try and do a

1000
01:02:27.601 --> 01:02:30.690
tour of,
I'm gonna try to tour all of Australia,

1001
01:02:30.691 --> 01:02:34.650
which would be Perth all the way to a home,
a bond.
Scott,

1002
01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:37.770
I got to go see his grave site,
you know,

1003
01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:43.350
pay my respects and go all the way through.
I don't know,
all the way back.

1004
01:02:43.351 --> 01:02:46.920
Work my way all the way back to Sydney and maybe have time to check out the

1005
01:02:46.921 --> 01:02:51.840
great barrier reef.
See,
that's what I want to do.
That's the game plan for me.

1006
01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:56.340
All right.
And if the Bruins can win the Stanley Cup over the next fucking six,

1007
01:02:56.341 --> 01:03:00.750
seven days,
it would just be a perfect God damn year.
All right.
So anyways,

1008
01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:03.690
that is the podcast this week.
Everybody,
once again,

1009
01:03:03.691 --> 01:03:06.360
thank you to everyone who came out and,
uh,
and Buffalo,
oh,

1010
01:03:06.361 --> 01:03:09.600
I keep forgetting to tell that story.
We're drinking afterwards.

1011
01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:11.490
The hotel bar slow,
uh,

1012
01:03:12.210 --> 01:03:15.180
is about ready to shut down and I gotta leave at 6:40 AM flight.
So I'm like,

1013
01:03:15.181 --> 01:03:18.360
well,
what's the point of going to bed?
So I go across to this bar,

1014
01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.690
we start drinking over there and now their kitchen was closed.

1015
01:03:21.691 --> 01:03:23.430
So they bring out some bar food,
you know,

1016
01:03:23.431 --> 01:03:25.320
and they usually bring out some peanuts or pretzels.

1017
01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:27.390
They came out and it was all bacon.

1018
01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:35.870
I got to fucking tell you,
you can't beat the fucking Midwest,

1019
01:03:35.871 --> 01:03:37.820
even though that's not the Midwest.
It's the beginning of it.

1020
01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:42.050
And I forgot to mention,
uh,
Cleveland,
uh,
don't sleep on Cleveland.

1021
01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:46.100
I would say if you look into invest some money in buying an old building,

1022
01:03:46.101 --> 01:03:49.700
if you want some friends and you want to make some fucking money,
uh,

1023
01:03:49.790 --> 01:03:52.970
every time I come back to Cleveland it's,
it's doing a little bit better.

1024
01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:57.800
And I saw a lot of building going on there and it was great to see,

1025
01:03:57.801 --> 01:04:00.990
cause whenever I went to Cleveland it always made me sad like I was cause you,

1026
01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:02.900
you know,
I was looking at these beautiful buildings,

1027
01:04:02.901 --> 01:04:06.170
there was just nobody in them.
The same thing when you go to Detroit,

1028
01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:09.800
it's just like a,
yeah like fuck man,

1029
01:04:09.801 --> 01:04:11.840
look at these beautiful houses and these beautiful buildings.

1030
01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:15.010
And it was just like nobody there or just,
you know,

1031
01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:18.980
some Zombie looking person in front of it.
It's a,
it's depressing.

1032
01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:21.380
So in St Louis was another one.

1033
01:04:21.381 --> 01:04:25.400
St Louis was another one that was a scary place to be.
And 10 years ago,
you know,

1034
01:04:25.401 --> 01:04:27.290
they still have this shit,
you know,

1035
01:04:27.850 --> 01:04:31.220
if some people who are late to the show or couldn't come to the show because

1036
01:04:31.221 --> 01:04:33.230
there was a shooting or something like that.
So whatever,

1037
01:04:33.231 --> 01:04:34.400
everybody's got this shit.

1038
01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:38.930
But it was nice to see those cities are starting to make a comeback.
Um,

1039
01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:43.940
you know,
after all the manufacturing jobs and everything left and shit.
So I,

1040
01:04:43.941 --> 01:04:48.620
yeah,
I actually learned some shit about buffalo first city,
uh,
in,

1041
01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:53.540
in the United States that had electricity throughout the whole thing was used to

1042
01:04:53.541 --> 01:04:56.270
be known as the city of lights.
How funny is that?
Buffalo?

1043
01:04:56.270 --> 01:05:00.050
You don't think of that shit,
but I guess the Erie Canal or some shit.
Damn.

1044
01:05:00.051 --> 01:05:00.751
I don't know.
What the fuck are,

1045
01:05:00.751 --> 01:05:05.360
was creative bunch of jobs and then they built another dam or a canal somewhere

1046
01:05:05.361 --> 01:05:09.110
else up to fucking river.
And everybody left.
And that was the end of it.
You know,

1047
01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.400
everybody left,
all the pussies left,
you know,

1048
01:05:13.401 --> 01:05:16.460
but all the tough people stayed and that's why they have an outdoor stadium.

1049
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:20.440
If those pussy stayed,
the buffalo bills would play in a dome stadium.

1050
01:05:20.441 --> 01:05:24.040
That's actually true.
All right,
so there you go.
That's a podcast for this week.

1051
01:05:24.041 --> 01:05:27.750
Go fuck yourselves.
My next date I have coming up is,
uh,

1052
01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:32.500
the Cape Cod melody tent in Hyannis,
Massachusetts.
Um,

1053
01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:36.820
tickets are on sale.
Um,
I hope people come out to that one.

1054
01:05:36.821 --> 01:05:40.990
That's a huge one because for me,
cause I only saw George Carlin once in my life,

1055
01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.581
unfortunately,

1056
01:05:42.581 --> 01:05:46.720
I only saw him perform one time and I saw him at the Cape Cod melody tent in

1057
01:05:46.721 --> 01:05:50.920
like 1988.
I've told that story a absolutely blew me away.

1058
01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:55.630
Uh,
Dennis Blair opening them up blew me away.
It was just,
it was fucking awesome.

1059
01:05:56.170 --> 01:05:56.940
And uh,

1060
01:05:56.940 --> 01:06:01.940
it's actually be going back there 25 years later to be literally doing what I

1061
01:06:02.261 --> 01:06:05.380
saw him doing.
His is fucking amazing.
So,
uh,

1062
01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:08.070
thanks to everyone who's coming out to that show.
