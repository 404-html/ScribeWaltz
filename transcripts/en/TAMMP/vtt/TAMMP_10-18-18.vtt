00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.950
Hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill Byrd is time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:05.880
Just before Friday,

3
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:10.230
Monday morning podcast and I'm just checking again on you.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.940
I'm just checking it on you seeing how your week's going.

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.410
I know if you live in in Boston,
you'll weeks go pretty good.

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.060
You're living in Houston.
I ain't so good,
isn't it?

7
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.790
<v 0>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.920
<v 1>Fucking unbelievable.
How many times,</v>

9
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.210
how many fucking times to fucking players on opposing teams just going to

10
00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:34.780
fucking rile up the other team was some dumb horseshit.

11
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.810
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.950
<v 1>Didn't you learn anything with Aaron judge and a very,</v>

13
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.450
an Aaron judge moment playing fucking New York,
New York up in Boston

14
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.040
because they what?
They tied the fucking series.

15
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.170
What are you doing?
And then this other jackass on Houston

16
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.980
looking at some game film.

17
00:00:56.981 --> 00:00:59.790
It's where they went back to back to back on fucking what?
Whatever.

18
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:01.900
Valdi whatever's,
I don't know what anybody's fucking name is.

19
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.710
Why the fuck would you do that?
I'm glad you keep doing it.

20
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.650
Stupid fucking moves.

21
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.303
<v 0>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.560
<v 1>You're the defending world series champions.</v>

23
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:16.380
You don't need to be gone around trying to fucking troll people.

24
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.340
You carry yourself with the quiet confidence of a champion.

25
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.620
That's what you supposed to do.
You don't fucking rile him up.

26
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.680
<v 0>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.590
<v 1>So they can be in the other locker and,
and tell you some,</v>

28
00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:33.850
but those guys cross the hall
then I'll respect you.

29
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.690
I mean,
what,
what did what he said on fucking,
I'm fucking facetime.

30
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.400
Whatever the fuck these kids are doing.

31
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.670
And I know there's a lot of people down in Houston going like,
you know,

32
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.520
<v 0>okay,</v>

33
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.220
<v 1>I don't know about that.
All two way thing.
I think that was a fucking home run.</v>

34
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:55.130
You know what?
I agree with you.
God knows they didn't have any angle.

35
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.520
We could definitively say it one way or another.

36
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.893
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

37
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.840
<v 1>look like he reached back into the stance.</v>

38
00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:05.990
I know Kate Upton thought that that's the way it went down and that's good

39
00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:06.824
enough for me.

40
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.703
Um,

41
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.080
<v 0>okay.</v>

42
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.730
<v 1>Kate Upton said Sofa players in the stands,
fans are supposed to move over.</v>

43
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.330
Those are the rules.
Mlb shouldn't let fans sit there.

44
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.570
They didn't reach over the fence.
You know,
who would have thought?

45
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:31.230
Kate Upton was then into the fucking cameras.
Great.
Um,

46
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.910
anyways,
I thought,
oh,
I thought it was a,
I mean,

47
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.990
<v 0>yeah,</v>

48
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.870
<v 1>every angle that I saw,
which was nothing definitive,</v>

49
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.350
I could see why they didn't overturn it.
I was surprised we got that call.

50
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.350
But that's not why the Astros lost the game.
I hate when people do that.

51
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.770
Well he missed the seal goal in the first quarter and though they lost by two.

52
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:53.180
So I mean if he hits that,
that they,
uh,
they would the fuck get the fucking hits.

53
00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:57.030
It changes the whole game.
Did you watch back to the future?
You can't go.

54
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.040
He can't go back changing things.
It changes the future.

55
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:03.940
The reason why you fucking lost it was because you let up eight runs.

56
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.490
Why did you let it bake runs?

57
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:10.660
Cause you run fucking social media fucking amping up the red sox.

58
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.360
They got a little more spring in their step going.
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.660
Did they not respect the fact that we want 108 fucking games?

60
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.070
The Jackie Bradley Jr has got to go up there and give the old right there.
Fred,

61
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.230
what does,
um,
anyways,

62
00:03:27.231 --> 00:03:30.740
I still,
you know,
I still think this thing is far from over.

63
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.570
All right.
You're probably thinking,
Hey,
bill,
while you're up three games to one,

64
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:35.321
why would you say that?

65
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:38.350
Because I remember 2004 when there was a fucking $200 million team up,

66
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:41.500
three games to none and they didn't win.
So it's still,

67
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:46.200
we till we put the final nail in the fucking coffin,
you know?

68
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.930
Uh,
that's it.
And by the way,

69
00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:52.320
who was the fucking cunt and how the fuck did you figure out how the fuck did

70
00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:56.490
they figure out the name of the guy?
Some random fucking guy,

71
00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.130
not one credit on IMD B.

72
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.040
How do they find out what his fucking name was?

73
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.400
<v 0>Okay.</v>

74
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.620
<v 1>And then why would you go ahead and publish it after?</v>

75
00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:10.350
What happened to that poor bastard?
Uh,
what's his name?
Moe.

76
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.290
Mikey Michelson up there in the Chicago cubs.

77
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.090
That guy when fucking him and four the people I reached up for the ball,

78
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.980
it just so happened he hit him,
whatever the hell his name is.

79
00:04:19.981 --> 00:04:21.600
I'm glad I forgot what his fucking name is.
Elke.

80
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.030
That guy has been able to move on with his life.

81
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.253
<v 0>Okay.</v>

82
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.710
<v 1>The guy to hide fucking hide under the old Comiskey stadium for the last
fucking,</v>

83
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.810
I dunno,
15 years now that the cubs won it.

84
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.690
We finally stopped taking your childhood out on this guy.

85
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.020
That fucking guy in the front or did what everybody else would do.

86
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.960
You realize the balls,
it takes a fucking stick your hand out there.

87
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.970
You ever see you ever like have a foul ball?
Some that's a fucking baseball.

88
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.610
Would you go play baseball with your friend?

89
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.800
The guy who just building an APP with no,
with no glove.
Would you do that?

90
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.000
If the guy the fuck alone,
that's like some shit that morning.

91
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.230
Fucking radio guys trying to be edgy.
They're the kind of people they fucking

92
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.930
put the person's name or there's poor pastor.
He goes,
okay,

93
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:17.500
you know I got to get security the Astros.
Who's this game?

94
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:20.590
I'm going to need security escort me out of here.
It's the Astros.

95
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:23.170
Don't come back and win this match.
Just fucking,
that's pathetic.

96
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.190
You know what about the other pictures giving up all those runs?
Huh?

97
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.210
Do they have security escort them out of the building?
Well I guess they do

98
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.890
about that catchment.
Bennett 10 to end the game.
Unfucking believable.

99
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.460
So having said that,
uh,

100
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.700
the Houston Astros still scared the shit out of me cause they are the defending

101
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:49.480
world series champions.
They've got a couple of fucking uh,
you know,

102
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.280
tough games here.
But I figured Berlin,

103
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.720
it's got to be coming back any moment to put on his white hat and come back in

104
00:05:55.721 --> 00:06:00.290
and saved the day,
try to make it three,
two.
Then all of a sudden they're like,

105
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:02.260
why?
You know,
all we gotta do is one,

106
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.910
one more now it's fucking tied up and it's anybody's series.

107
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.790
That's how quickly you can fucking turn around.

108
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.410
It's no different than getting married.
You know,
you're a single man,

109
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:15.500
you've got the world by the balls and any second you could just fall in love

110
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:19.520
with a woman and all that freedom you had all that time,

111
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.070
all those great feelings you felt about yourself,

112
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.360
all those dumb sports shorts,
shorts,

113
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.760
sports shirts that you had that you thought were cool.

114
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.500
All of a sudden they just disappear.
You just like,
you're in seventh grade.

115
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.870
I liked seventh grade,
honey,

116
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.710
just try on this button down and it all fucking goes away.

117
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.890
Don't ever forget that.
You know,
it's like a fucking squirrel,
right?
It goes over,

118
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:46.790
gets a couple of nuts.

119
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:51.791
It's fucking lolly gag and across the road and all of a sudden a harmer comes

120
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:54.480
along,
right?
Just fucking flats thing.

121
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.050
I know what I'm talking about right now.
I just can't,

122
00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:02.560
I'm just stunned that were up three games to one.
Um,

123
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.240
hopefully Joel Olsteen,

124
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.200
we'll fucking open the doors to his church and let some people in there,

125
00:07:08.201 --> 00:07:10.960
you know,
let that guy fucking hide in there.

126
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.293
<v 0>Okay,</v>

127
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.730
<v 2>Joel,
open the fucking door on eight security.
Is it raining up?</v>

128
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.920
Jesus doesn't want you to come in if it's raining out.

129
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.620
<v 1>Um,
all right,
enough of that shit.
We still got one more to go.</v>

130
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.670
Uh,
having said that,
I still love the fucking Astros and I love their fans.

131
00:07:29.671 --> 00:07:33.120
It's like it's,
I haven't seen them this fucking amped up,
you know,

132
00:07:33.121 --> 00:07:36.570
since those great late seventies teams,
but jr Richards and all that.

133
00:07:36.571 --> 00:07:40.350
And I love when I see the old school gay pride parade,

134
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.290
a flag that they used to have.
Um,

135
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.110
it was actually more like the gay pride,
like ginger flag.
Like if you were,

136
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.580
if you like gay people,

137
00:07:50.581 --> 00:07:53.730
but only redheaded once that was like you had a flag for it,

138
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.690
that's what their Jersey looked like.
Um,
all right,
here's one for you.

139
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.650
I've been in New York City,
I'm in,
I'm on Baltimore now.
Baltimore,

140
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.520
Scarface reference anybody.
Um,

141
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.170
I got two shows tonight at the lyric theater and then I fucking got Atlantic

142
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.900
city.
I got two more.
And then I see my daughter for the first time in a week.

143
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:17.490
This has been fucking brutal,
but I had to do it cause I gotta fucking try.

144
00:08:17.491 --> 00:08:22.020
And uh,
you know,

150
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.790
Almost every fucking interview is just like,

You know all these fucking comedians that want to talk about that shit just

158
00:09:07.761 --> 00:09:11.480
cause they're talking about all of that Shit and getting all political and

159
00:09:11.481 --> 00:09:12.314

<v 0>okay.</v>

161
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.560
<v 1>Dive in into this,
dividing the country down the fucking middle.</v>

162
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.070
I just sitting there like,
why do I have to,
why do I have to comment on this?

163
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.030
So I'll let,
I'll let you guys on in a little fucking inside tiny thing.

164
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.950
I'm sorry,
I don't have my microphone,

165
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:28.740
Sorry about the fucking breathing on them like that.
Um,

166
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.270
I'll let you in on a little fucking secret.
This is how I handle those questions.

167
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.140
They'll go like,
so what do you think about Louis C K coming back?
I just go,

168
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.210
I don't know.
What do you think about it?

169
00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.540
It fucking works every time.

170
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

171
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.140
<v 1>Either they either they go,
well,
no,
I'm asking you.
I'm like,
well,
I go,</v>

172
00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:54.450
I wasn't thinking about you.
You're obviously thinking about it.

173
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.970
You obviously have an opinion.
I would love to hear your opinion.

174
00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:01.580
That fascinates me.
What do you think about it?
Or You just go,
I dunno.

175
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.180
What do you think about it?
They look,
you know,
I'd take a jet tickets,
fine him,

176
00:10:04.181 --> 00:10:05.970
yarrow,
or I think it's bullshit or whatever,

177
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.930
and then I just sit there and I look over and I fucking look at my butt.

178
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.270
You know,
the guy taking me around the radio and it just smiling

179
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.820
the fuck.
Do I take what I take?

180
00:10:16.821 --> 00:10:20.090
I want to be still be able to make my mortgage this month,
if you don't mind.

181
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.023
<v 0>Okay.</v>

182
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:24.840
<v 1>Fucking unbelievable.</v>

183
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.530
I don't understand how this is a more progressive era where,

184
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.850
and things are getting better.
That if,
if you haven't done anything,

185
00:10:34.851 --> 00:10:37.370
even if you comment in the wrong fucking way,

186
00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:42.260
all of a sudden you're in trouble and they take your fucking show away.
I just,

187
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:43.610
I just like,
it's,

188
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:48.860
it's fucking ridiculous and I know that I am in the massive majority when I say

189
00:10:48.861 --> 00:10:52.490
that
Jesus fucking Christ,

190
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.090
the amount of people that I saw on this fucking trip,

191
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.730
that old friends I haven't seen yet.
You know,
women are,
you go to hug him,

192
00:11:00.731 --> 00:11:03.960
you're like,
oh Whoa,

you know,
I want to,

193
00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:08.310
I want to come up with a fucking me to stick the thing where you go in for the

194
00:11:08.311 --> 00:11:11.830
hug and then if you feel fucking weird,
it just fucking,
it's like a nerf sticker.

195
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.800
Something.
It just shoots out between the two of you.

196
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:15.620
<v 0>Okay.</v>

197
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.090
<v 1>I'm bringing it back.
The fist bump.
But you know,</v>

198
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.430
<v 3>current comedy climate,
what do you is it is,</v>

199
00:11:23.431 --> 00:11:26.770
it can be [inaudible].

200
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.550
<v 1>All right,
if I hear that one more fucking time.</v>

201
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.170
<v 0>Okay.</v>

202
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.860
<v 1>It's like what fucking shows go to a comedy show.</v>

203
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.820
People are just showing up and they're laughing.
They're adults.

204
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:44.010
They know you're there.
At a show.
I know these fucking assholes.

205
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.140
What kind of a fucking adult goes to a comedy show and then goes,
you know,

206
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:54.160
I was triggered by that show.
You were triggered.
Well,
toughen the fuck up.

207
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.630
Stay home.
All right,
go,
go watch a willy Wonka and the in the,

208
00:11:58.631 --> 00:12:02.590
in the fucking chocolate factory.
Go Watch that shit.

209
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.610
Go on.
Go,
go fucking home and go watch the muppet movie.

210
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.900
Okay.
You went outside,
you went and public.

211
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:15.050
You said fucking down in a comedy club.

212
00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:20.260
It's the job of the comedian to say crazy outrageous shit and make you laugh.

213
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:30.130
You know,
go get,
go get the fucking ice.
Capades that's an most of those,
you know,

214
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:31.060
usually when they have the star,

215
00:12:31.061 --> 00:12:33.580
The star and the thing is usually a fucking Olympic gold medal winner.

216
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.010
Way Back in the day.
The fuck was her name?
Donna Karen,
who is that?

217
00:12:39.011 --> 00:12:42.910
Chicco one in [inaudible] 76 I remember she called in sick that day.

218
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:47.860
We went to go see her Dorothy Hamill.
There's a great old Naima,

219
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:52.180
Dorothy,
Dottie.
Dottie.

220
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.060
What do you mean you're not fucking skate?
And at the fucking Boston Garden,

221
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.050
we gave a bunch of mascots out there looking for a pretty chicken.

222
00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:02.430
You ain't out there twirling around
the ice.

223
00:13:02.431 --> 00:13:06.460
Capades trigger me because my last relationship,

224
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:08.470
my boyfriend was ice cold to me.

225
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.750
Is there any way you could melt the ice and give me my money back?

226
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.980
Um,
anyway,

227
00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:22.120
so I'm doing all this fucking doing all of this press.
It wasn't all like that,

228
00:13:22.121 --> 00:13:27.010
but there was a,
there was a lot of fucking talking about the current climate.

229
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.750
Um,
I'll be honest with you,

230
00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:31.930
if you come to my show is I've been going harder than ever and I've been

231
00:13:31.931 --> 00:13:33.970
trashing feminists because it's fun.

232
00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.573
<v 0>MMM.</v>

233
00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.410
<v 1>And I agree with,
you know,
a lot of the shit you want to make shitty equal.</v>

234
00:13:44.411 --> 00:13:45.590
I get it.
Yeah,
it's fine.

235
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.700
Does that mean I have to lose my job because I have a fucking opinion about

236
00:13:49.701 --> 00:13:50.534
something.

237
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.193
<v 0>Huh?</v>

238
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.560
<v 1>All right.
There bushy.
Anyways,</v>

239
00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.590
so going around right.
And all of these fucking God buildings,
you go into the,

240
00:14:03.591 --> 00:14:04.470
you know,
they want like an,
yeah,

241
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:08.480
you're fucking driver's license and shit like you going into the Goddamn

242
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.060
Pentagon.
So I just show it to him and now that they like,

243
00:14:11.061 --> 00:14:14.000
they like take the thing from me and they stick it in this little ass fucking

244
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.480
computer thing,
scan it.
Earl always dumb shit.
And you know,

245
00:14:17.481 --> 00:14:21.620
they're taking all your information off of it.
So I have an expired license.

246
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.170
Right?
I have one that's not expired,

247
00:14:24.171 --> 00:14:28.040
but I kept my expired one and that's the one I give it.
I give to him.
All right.

248
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.880
It's fucking from way back in the day when I still had fucking hair and I had a

249
00:14:31.881 --> 00:14:34.940
different address.
Right.
So

250
00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:41.120
I fucking go to this building and I hand it to the guy and he goes,

251
00:14:41.121 --> 00:14:46.010
your ids expired.
I go,
yeah,
but my face is it,
you know,

252
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.870
I didn't come here to drive the building.
You know,
it's a fucking id.
You need an,

253
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:55.750
there's an I date and I'm telling you these guys,
pretty soon it's going to be,

254
00:14:55.751 --> 00:14:59.780
you need a valid id to go.
It's like you have to know where the fuck I live.

255
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.940
That goes back to this fucking guy
who just like,
who caught that,

256
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.530
you know that home run.

257
00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:08.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

258
00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.470
<v 1>And now he's cynical and I'm going to meet this poor pass has got us thinking</v>

259
00:15:11.471 --> 00:15:12.760
about his own personal safety.

260
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.600
Like I don't understand how these corporations and all these people were able to

261
00:15:16.601 --> 00:15:18.940
snag your personal information.
People have stalkers,

262
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.820
they'll get all the women out there who literally have to have like,

263
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.290
like restraining orders from these lunatic guys and he's fucking corporations

264
00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:31.210
that you're going to buy fucking chapstick,
you know,

265
00:15:31.211 --> 00:15:35.320
they double swipe you love whatever the fuck they do with you.
God Damn license.

266
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.320
They take your fucking information and they just put it out there

267
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.880
and you know what's going to happen is somebody's gonna get fucking killed

268
00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:47.090
because of it.
And then these corporations,
they're not going to be responsible.

269
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:49.773
<v 0>Okay.</v>

270
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:54.580
<v 1>I,
I dunno,
I dunno.
I'm just basically,
I'm just fucking,</v>

271
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.160
I'm shouting into a tornado here.
Nobody gives a fuck enough.

272
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.840
Are you dumb fucks are going to go onto that ancestry.com and then we're,

273
00:16:01.841 --> 00:16:06.190
all of our fucking DNA is going to be mapped.
You know what I mean?

274
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.590
Like in what,
what good is going to come with that?

275
00:16:10.591 --> 00:16:14.490
They'll catch a couple of serial killers.
Okay.
What else are they going to do?

276
00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:17.070
I'm telling you I'm doing that whole bit.

277
00:16:17.071 --> 00:16:19.350
They're going to fucking build your robot replacement.
Yeah.

278
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:21.070
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

279
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.070
<v 1>No one knows what I dunno.</v>

280
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.370
I just don't understand what people have against privacy now.

281
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.660
You know,
it's fucking,
you see the look of concern on this guy's,

282
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:33.940
this guy's put full fucking poor bastards face.

283
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:37.500
It's poor guy in Houston.
He's probably thinking,

284
00:16:37.501 --> 00:16:41.520
how the fuck am I going to get to my God damn horse and ride out of fucking town

285
00:16:41.521 --> 00:16:46.521
without these mother fuckers getting a posse together coming after me?

286
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.863
<v 0>MMM.</v>

287
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:55.080
<v 1>Anyways,
I don't know when the next game is,
but uh,
people can we,</v>

288
00:16:55.081 --> 00:16:57.390
can we try to stop yelling at each other?
You know,

289
00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.930
can we fucking stop trying to peer into everybody's fucking living room?

290
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.600
These fucking lunatics like the fucking Alexis Shit.

291
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.990
What kind of a fucking moron gets that?

292
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:10.820
You literally bugging your own house house.
Sorry.

293
00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.880
It was yelling at the TV last night.
I'm watching the game.

294
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:15.890
You literally bug in your own house.

295
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.400
You're sending your DNA into the fucking Internet.

296
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.260
I don't,
or what else are you going to do?

297
00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.570
You're going to fucking handcuffs for your wrist to your ankles.

298
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.680
Start walking backwards down the street and see what happens to me.

299
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.700
What are you doing?

300
00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:40.003
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

301
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.720
<v 1>it's,
it's just so you can have some fucking thing</v>

302
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.890
and you knew you goddamn house,
so you can be like a,
you know,

303
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.780
captain and Neil,
what was the captain's Alexis Kay?

304
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.560
What was the captain's real name?

305
00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.340
Do the fucking shit that I say when I'm in my house to try and make my wife

306
00:18:03.341 --> 00:18:06.070
laugh.
I mean,
I don't want anybody hearing that.

307
00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.950
I mean,
that's,
that's her own private fucking jokes.

308
00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.400
Then forget about when to get to a God damn argument.
The shit that I say.

309
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.410
Well it's the,
why the fuck would you somebody recording that?

310
00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:22.150
Who's listening to it?

311
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.280
<v 0>Okay.</v>

312
00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.310
<v 1>There's gotta be somebody on the other side that Alexis,
Alexa,</v>

313
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:28.203
whatever the fuck it is,

314
00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:32.860
is literally listening to your life like a reality show.

315
00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:34.250
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

316
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.550
<v 1>You know,</v>

317
00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.910
maybe it was like an FBI guy or a fucking one of those international fucking

318
00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.350
Gumshoe guys and they're listening and maybe set a couple of fucking a,

319
00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:44.403
<v 0>yeah.</v>

320
00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:44.910
<v 1>You know,</v>

321
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:48.510
you were trying to talk about former president Obama and you said it was Sammer

322
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.310
instead,
and that was a trigger thing.

323
00:18:50.311 --> 00:18:53.160
So now they've got to listen in on your life to make sure you're not fucking,

324
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.230
you know,
a terrorist or some shit.
Right.
And then they just,
I dunno,

325
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.830
they just listening.
They don't hear any terrorist shit,

326
00:19:01.831 --> 00:19:03.480
but they just kind of get into your life.

327
00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.540
Oh,
he's,
yeah,
they were expecting a child.
This is,
oh,
this is so exciting.

328
00:19:10.541 --> 00:19:14.230
I'm so sick of being in this van and they just fucking listens.

329
00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:22.570
Uh,
you know,
do you like gone like one of those flat screen TVs?
You know,

330
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.360
they get the cameras on it like they got,
they ask them,

331
00:19:25.361 --> 00:19:29.890
do you watch people in their houses watching TV?

332
00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.070
And I don't know why they didn't just say no.
They would like,
uh,
you know,

333
00:19:33.071 --> 00:19:36.150
we're not going to comment on that or something.
Let me,

334
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.050
let me fucking look that shit up.
Here we go.
What is it right here?

335
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.120
Um,
smart TVs.

336
00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.680
Watch you watching you.
All right,
here we go.
This side,

337
00:19:50.681 --> 00:19:55.540
it'd be great for my fucking paranoia.
Para yourself.
Destroy.

338
00:19:55.541 --> 00:20:00.160
Yeah.
Your smart TV is watching you watching TV.

339
00:20:00.161 --> 00:20:03.640
Consumer report finds.
Now why isn't this

340
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:06.460
a concern to anybody?

341
00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.693
<v 0>You know</v>

342
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:16.150
<v 1>your smart TV is watching you watch TV.
Consumer report finds.
All right.</v>

343
00:20:16.151 --> 00:20:21.010
Millions of smart TVs sitting in families living room are vulnerable to hackers

344
00:20:21.011 --> 00:20:22.770
taking control.
Oh,

345
00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.710
this is saying hackers and could be tracking the households personal viewing

346
00:20:26.711 --> 00:20:31.180
habits much more closely than their owners realize according to a new consumer

347
00:20:31.181 --> 00:20:34.330
reports investigation.
Um,

348
00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.950
all right,
so this is talking about hackers then that's,

349
00:20:37.951 --> 00:20:41.640
I'm talking about the actual fucking companies.
All right,
so if hackers

350
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.960
like one of the,
this is like fucking,
I mean that's like a,

351
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:51.420
that's has to be a crime,
right?
I Dunno.

352
00:20:51.421 --> 00:20:54.750
These fucking voyeurs these days is so god Damn Lazy.
Back in the day,

353
00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:59.760
if someone wanted a look at you,
they had to walk up to your window,
right?

354
00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.500
And you saw him coming up your yard,

355
00:21:01.501 --> 00:21:05.220
but they're fucking dick out and you had a time to grab like a steak knife or

356
00:21:05.221 --> 00:21:07.980
something or maybe your shotgun,
you came out,

357
00:21:07.981 --> 00:21:10.650
you brandished a weapon and the guide,
you know,
ran away.

358
00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.370
I mean not too fast cause you can only run so fast with the fucking erection.

359
00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:16.440
And that's usually how people got caught.

360
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.030
Um,
but now they can just stay,
just stay at home.

361
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:28.120
Eight o'clock.
They start knowing you fucking habits a,
these,

362
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:33.090
this couple banks every Friday night around nine o'clock when they put,
you know,

363
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.140
kids all go out.
The kids are older.

364
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:36.780
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

365
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.940
<v 1>sit down.
Wow.
Look at that.
Try and doggy style this week.</v>

366
00:21:38.941 --> 00:21:39.930
Or they edit something else.

367
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:41.900
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

368
00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.510
<v 1>New rippled to this little fucking TV show much.
I don't know.</v>

369
00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:47.270
The whole thing fucking freaks me out.
Um,

370
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:55.020
what,
what is people's fascination with that shit?
Why do you want to listen?

371
00:21:55.021 --> 00:21:57.210
Why do you want to look at people?
What the fuck do you care?

372
00:21:58.940 --> 00:21:59.420
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

373
00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:03.820
<v 1>maybe because I'm antisocial.
I don't get it.
Like,
you know what I mean?</v>

374
00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:07.820
My wife's social.

375
00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.000
She says hi to the neighbors and that shit.
I'm,
if I'm like,
I'm just like,
Hey,
oh,

376
00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:20.420
I go inside.
I don't care what you're doing.

377
00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.480
I don't want to,
wouldn't know what you're doing.
I don't want to watch your fuck.

378
00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.390
I don't want to see what she eating and I don't want,

379
00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.630
I don't want to see your arguments.

380
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:32.730
I could barely talk to you in my fucking driveway.
The fuck would I want,

381
00:22:32.731 --> 00:22:33.564
you know?

382
00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:35.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

383
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.420
<v 1>I'm going to,
I'm going to fucking watch that.</v>

384
00:22:37.421 --> 00:22:40.000
I'm going to learn how to hack into somebody's TV.

385
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.070
Or I could put on a Martin Scorsese movie instead.
Yeah,
man.

386
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:48.850
But Alexis is real,
man.
I Dunno.

387
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:52.600
It's all fucking this whole podcast.
They'll throw worlds.

388
00:22:52.601 --> 00:22:55.030
He's fucking weirded me out.
Now I'll tell you this.
Current climate,

389
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.830
let me read this.
Felix Gray,
which sounds like a,

390
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.470
a high,
like a Hollywood escort service,
doesn't it?

391
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:04.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

392
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.500
<v 1>Felix Gray.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
I want to read it and I want to Brunette.</v>

393
00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:12.320
All right,
Felix.
Sorry.
Felix Gray.
Uh,
the average American blast,

394
00:23:12.321 --> 00:23:17.321
their eyes with bright screens for 11 hours every fucking day.

395
00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:20.820
All these things are great.
I actually have a pair of these.
He's amazing.

396
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:24.120
Now you can protect your eyes and not wearing them cause I'm a moron.

397
00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:25.003
I haven't been home.

398
00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:29.340
Now you can protect your eyes with a pair of Felix gray glasses available with

399
00:23:29.341 --> 00:23:30.360
or without a prescription.

400
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:35.280
Felix gray glasses filter out 90% of high energy.
I love that percentage.

401
00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:38.610
I always go with that percentage.
90% of high energy,

402
00:23:38.611 --> 00:23:42.990
blue light and eliminate the glare coming off all those screens.

403
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:47.550
That means no more tired eye you can you,

404
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:50.570
you a boom,
boom,

405
00:23:50.571 --> 00:23:53.870
boom and your blue revision.

406
00:23:53.871 --> 00:23:57.380
Is it thin disguise right?
Or headaches?

407
00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.600
Athol Barna,
sorry.

408
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:03.620
Usually it seems like a hassle to have to protect your eyes man.

409
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.440
And that's why most of us don't do it.

410
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.790
But Felix gray glasses aren't like those weird computer glasses you've seen

411
00:24:10.791 --> 00:24:15.620
before.
There's no yellow Lens Tint.
Donny shut the fuck up.

412
00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:17.360
That's what I always think of when I think yellow.

413
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.150
I'll let the other finger here in an hour.

414
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:25.400
Felix gray glasses are handcrafted from premium Italian acetate,

415
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:31.100
Acetate Acetate,
so they won't make you look nerdy.

416
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:31.821
In fact,

417
00:24:31.821 --> 00:24:36.821
throwing on some Felix Graze is an easy way to look pretty put together.

418
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.970
Sorry Felix.

419
00:24:37.971 --> 00:24:42.971
Grays glasses are available in nonprescription prescription and read us with

420
00:24:43.641 --> 00:24:48.020
free shipping and free returns.
There's nothing to lose.
Don't go another day.

421

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:30.040
it's an l two bay fucking bowl going into the fucking stands.

430
00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.430
Hold on baby.

431
00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:39.650
You're out.
Take a seat.
I can't believe how many calls Boston teams get now.

432
00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:44.380
It's like they're making up for the entire last century roughing the passer.

433
00:25:44.381 --> 00:25:47.050
Go Fuck yourself and you're super bold drinks.

434
00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:51.400
All right.
Then all of a sudden it just turned around.

435
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.450
Everything just fucking has been going our way.
I don't know what happened.

436
00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:58.360
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

437
00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.260
<v 1>Fumble by Tom Brady.
Brady.
Wait a minute.
The tuck rule.</v>

438
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:05.080
You're going to the Superbowl.

439
00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.000
Alex Rodriguez slapping that ball out of cave,
which is hand.

440
00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:14.080
We never got those calls.
Yeah,
you're out.
You can't fucking do that.

441
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.470
But he's wearing pin stripes.
That's over

442
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.030
fucking God damn Canadians.
They're losing the game.
Ah,

443
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:26.360
fucking too many men in the ice gala floor right there.
Fred.

444
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.410
No Stanley Cup for you,

My whole fucking life.

445
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.340
It's unbelievable.
I'm just going to enjoy the shit out of it.
The same way.

446
00:26:37.341 --> 00:26:39.560
Any other fan?
What if everything was going his way?

447
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.730
That's another thing they always ask me.
Only sports shows,

448
00:26:42.731 --> 00:26:46.560

449
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:52.920
I mean,

Well,

but thank you for your concern.
Thank you for asking.

451
00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:59.310
I know it's coming from a place of jealousy.

452
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:00.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

453
00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:04.550
<v 1>Okay.
I know when things are said,
well,</v>

454
00:27:04.551 --> 00:27:06.110
they're not coming from a place of love.

455
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:07.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

456
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.160

Who Knew?</v>

457
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:13.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

459
00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.300
The fuck is Kate Upton.
I know that.

460
00:27:19.301 --> 00:27:23.500
She's some ridiculously beautiful woman.
You know I'm more than that bill.

461
00:27:23.501 --> 00:27:26.860
I'm also a baseball fan.
Sorry.
All right.
Kate Upton.

462
00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:32.490
Kate Upton.
Jesus Christ.
I couldn't draw more.
Oh,
I can't really draw,

463
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.780
but if I could draw a kid for a better looking person than that.

464
00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.730
What's it like to be that good looking?

465
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.100
You must just like stare at yourself in the mirror.

466
00:27:39.101 --> 00:27:43.130
She's got the same birthday as me.
Oh my God.

467
00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:48.440
Maybe I have a chance.
Alexis.
Well,
k.
Dot.
And go out with me.

468
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:51.620
No.
All right.
Kate.

469
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.030
Elizabeth Upton is an American model and actress Upton was named the sports

470
00:27:56.031 --> 00:28:01.010
illustrated sports illustrated swimsuit issue rookie of the year.
Oh my God.

471
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.410
That's it.
Fucking over.

472
00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.260
Can you imagine being then fucking good looking.

473
00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.830
Why was that good looking?
If I was like Brad Pitt,
good looking,

474
00:28:11.831 --> 00:28:15.560
I would literally be like Ron Burgundy.
I'd be like,
hey,

475
00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.700
why come and see how can I look?

476
00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:26.230
I know he's at my eyebrows up a little bit when I looked to the side.
Oh I,

477
00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:30.760
you know,
I would be,
oh,
it'd be very generous with my good looks.
I would,

478
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.420
I wouldn't be like one of these people rolling their eyes like,
oh my God,

479
00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:35.021
I get it.

480
00:28:35.021 --> 00:28:39.760
Stop staring at me cause you just [inaudible] I wouldn't be like that at all.

481
00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:44.740
Be walking around with half shirts and shit.
Eight pack everybody.

482
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.450
Oh,
you take it an anatomy class.
You can see on the entire,
all the hall,

483
00:28:49.451 --> 00:28:53.860
the whole midsection split together here.
Um,
by the way,

484
00:28:53.861 --> 00:28:57.190
I've been eating like shit out here in the road.
My flat stomach is no more.

485
00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.600
I look like a fucking turd docket.

486
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:00.733
<v 0>Uh,</v>

487
00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:07.380
<v 1>all right.
You know what Kate Upton looks like?
I look like the exact opposite.
Um,</v>

488
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.600
oh my God,
I look like a fucking redheaded Danny Devito.

489
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.680
Oh fuck.
I just,
you know,

490
00:29:16.681 --> 00:29:19.930
I got here and it's just like I got one of those New York Deli sandwiches and I

491
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:20.581
just,
you don't,

492
00:29:20.581 --> 00:29:23.310
you feel like you have to stock up because I know I'm going back out.

493
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.850
Like if I was gonna move ever move back to the east coast,

494
00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:30.990
like the amount of fucking Mexican food that I would be eating in La,

495
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.460
the amount of Taco trucks that I would hit,
the amount of Thai food,

496
00:29:35.461 --> 00:29:39.240
the amount of Burgers,
everything that La does.
Great.

497
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:44.080
I go up to San Francisco,
I'd get a couple of thousand fucking Burritos,

498
00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:49.370
shoved them down my fat fuck fucking throat,
you know,

499
00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:54.250
and then that would be it.
And I would,

500
00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.620
I would just head back east and I would never get another fucking Taco.

501
00:29:57.621 --> 00:29:59.700
It's like I'm not doing it.
Um,

502
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.980
I mean pizza.
I mean,

503
00:30:02.981 --> 00:30:05.110
how do you lay off pizzas and Italian food when you're back here?

504
00:30:05.111 --> 00:30:07.450
Cause I can't do it because I got to go back to,

505
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:12.610
to no man's land of Shit,
bread,
shit,
doe and all of that stuff.

506
00:30:12.611 --> 00:30:14.920
So whatever.
I'll get back on the diet,

507
00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:17.530
I'm going to do that whole three day water fast.

508
00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:23.470
You know where you just drink water and you don't consult a doctor and then all

509
00:30:23.471 --> 00:30:26.050
of a sudden you go into convulsions.

510
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:27.250
<v 0>Okay.</v>

511
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:28.840
<v 1>And then you come to in the hospital</v>

512
00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.320
and there's some guy fucking the stethoscope standing over you go.
And uh,

513
00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:39.000
that was a pretty reckless thing he did.
What happened?
Well,

514
00:30:39.001 --> 00:30:41.420
you let your electrolytes get down to,
uh,

515
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:46.770
she challenged me and a year a bile juices and eh,
what happened was the,

516
00:30:46.771 --> 00:30:51.340
uh,
the lining in your cell walls.
A Dj too much water.
It says,

517
00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.720
hey buddy,
can you just fucking,
am I still alive right now or am I an hell?

518
00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.260
Cause I don't know what the fuck you talking about.
Okay,
I get it.

519
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:03.390
Can I see a mirror?
But see how much weight I lost?
How long was he in a coma for?

520
00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.050
Was it like a liquid diet and you couldn't force me to choose where you,

521
00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:08.820
<v 0>okay,</v>

522
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.220
<v 1>I'm a big Hollywood phony.
I don't care if I almost killed myself.</v>

523
00:31:11.221 --> 00:31:12.450
I'm just trying to lose weight.

524
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.420
I'm trying to keep my Michelin tire fucking dude.
You know,

525
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.210
somebody told me I didn't know Michelin Stars were the same people who make the

526
00:31:21.211 --> 00:31:25.650
tires
for those of you,
uh,

527
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:30.380
uncultured people,
a Michelin Star,
the coveted Michelin Star,

528
00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.150
you know,
if you get three of those,

529
00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:37.220
which is such a weird thing cause it's usually usually have to get like four,

530
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:42.430
five star hotel,
you know,
five star hotel is the,

531
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:46.460
is the new four.
Right.
But Michelin,

532
00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.270
it's like three stars.

533
00:31:49.271 --> 00:31:53.380
It's got three Michelin Stars and that means that the food evidently is out of

534
00:31:53.381 --> 00:31:54.520
this fucking world.

535
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.033
<v 0>Okay.</v>

536
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:05.450
<v 1>And I found out that
I thought there was separate,
you know,</v>

537
00:32:05.451 --> 00:32:08.750
like there's the Macintosh stereo and then there's the Macintosh computer and

538
00:32:08.751 --> 00:32:10.970
they're spelled differently and they have nothing to do with each other.

539
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.060
That's what I thought.
A Michelin Star Wars.
I'm like,
yeah,
I mean,

540
00:32:14.061 --> 00:32:17.150
but it's not literally the fucking Michelin tire people.
It is.

541
00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:21.740
And this person would have to look it up cause I refuse to believe it.

542
00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:24.230
And I was just like,
but why the fuck are we listening to these people?

543
00:32:24.231 --> 00:32:25.100
They make tires.

544
00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:28.383
<v 0>You know.</v>

545
00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:31.920
<v 1>I mean that's just a weird thing.
I'd see tires and,</v>

546
00:32:31.921 --> 00:32:36.921
and then you're into like a also breaks or something else on a fucking car.

547
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.130
Steering columns.

548
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.420
<v 0>Something in the tire area.
Okay.</v>

549
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:45.703
<v 1>You don't,</v>

550
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:50.710
how the fuck do you go from radial tires helping me not hydroplane to a beef

551
00:32:51.111 --> 00:32:51.510
Morgan.

552
00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:55.190
Y'All like where the fuck I'm supposed to go to food of fucked is think they
are.

553
00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:00.380
And furthermore,
what's wrong with all of these fucking,
what do you call them?

554
00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:00.630
The,

555
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:05.630
the Goddamn Mama chefs getting all fucking nervous about what a tire company

556
00:33:08.381 --> 00:33:09.214
thinks.

557
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.970
That would be like a bunch of comedians get nervous

558
00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:20.230
about,
uh,
making one comedian.
Make them fucking nervous.

559
00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.750
All right,
I'm speaking to code here.
Okay.
Anyways,
ladies and gentlemen,

560
00:33:26.751 --> 00:33:31.400
that is the podcast.
Uh,

561
00:33:31.401 --> 00:33:35.300

And um,

562
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:40.870

564
00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:49.640

And even then,
I'm only leaving for one day.
Okay.

565
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:51.350
And then I have Madison Square Garden.

566
00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:52.550

571
00:34:05.201 --> 00:34:09.970
something all freckles fucking year on the road is over.

572
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.550
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

573
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.120
<v 1>Except for one charity Gig.
I have to do.</v>

574
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:16.950
<v 0>Other than that,
I'm done.
All right.</v>

575
00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:20.250
<v 1>And I am,
I am going to get myself,
I'm going to lose these,</v>

576
00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:24.420
this fucking 10 pounds I think I put on in the last three days.
Oh,

577
00:34:24.421 --> 00:34:27.100
I had a good time.
I had a good time doing it though.
Yeah.

578
00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.040
There's a few places that I go back to and it's like,

579
00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:32.040
I just go back to where the fuck I was.
Like whenever I go back to Boston,

580
00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:35.970
it's just over.
I go to all the places that I went to when I,

581
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.760
when I could eat McDonald's at four in the morning,

582
00:34:37.761 --> 00:34:40.050
it's still wake up and not have no damage done,
really.

583
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.500
And when I go to New York,
that's just a psych.
I'm,
I'm not going to get a bacon,

584
00:34:45.501 --> 00:34:47.480
egg and cheese sandwich on a fucking roll.
Yeah.

585
00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:53.760
Every God damn data.
How do I lay off that?
Well,
Bill,
you have willpower.
I know.

586
00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:59.160
Fucking I'm streaky so I am all right.
Anyways,
go red sox.

587
00:34:59.161 --> 00:35:01.110
Go Patriots,
go Bruins,
go Celtics.

588
00:35:01.111 --> 00:35:05.040
This is this great time of year where they're all playing at the same time.
Um,

589
00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:09.420
astro fans.
Be Nice to that guy.
All right.
He did what we all would've done.

590
00:35:09.421 --> 00:35:10.680
I would've done the same fucking thing,

591
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.650
but actually me I've would got out of the way cause I want to go to hit what the

592
00:35:13.651 --> 00:35:18.390
fucking ball.
Um,
but uh,
don't,
don't,
don't,
don't be a bunch of cats.

593
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.910
All right.
If you take anything from this podcast,
how cool is it?

594
00:35:23.911 --> 00:35:25.770
The Kate Upton likes fucking baseball at that level.

595
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:27.770
<v 0>You know,</v>

596
00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:29.191
<v 1>it's about time.</v>

597
00:35:29.191 --> 00:35:32.640
One of the swimsuit models in sports illustrated actually watched sports.

598
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:34.480
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

599
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.850
<v 1>Well great though.
I'm sure she's fucking thrilled that she has your,</v>

600
00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:44.040
<v 2>all right,
please enjoy the music,
uh,
on the podcast here.</v>

601
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:45.200
And um,

602
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:46.771
<v 1>that's it.</v>

603
00:35:46.771 --> 00:35:50.040
And then we'll play another half hour of greatest hits from a Thursday afternoon

604
00:35:50.041 --> 00:35:53.070
podcast just before Friday with the Monday,

605
00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.830
somewhere in there from earlier this year.
Maybe

606
00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.930
<v 4>five minutes ago
because he'll sweet,</v>

607
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:10.320
because
it's true.

608
00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:20.793
All right.

609
00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:21.890
<v 2>Long distance hiking.</v>

610
00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:26.750
The last week I mentioned that I went on a hike and we just kept going and going

611
00:36:26.751 --> 00:36:29.690
like assholes,
not realizing that we had to walk back.

612
00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.380
Hiking is not like a treadmill.
You don't just get to step off and be like,
oh,

613
00:36:33.381 --> 00:36:37.640
I'm still,
despite the fact I walked for an hour,
I am still only,

614
00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:42.170
you know,
10 paces from my phone,
the parking lot,
my car.
Um,

615
00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:46.670
we ended up going on like an 11 mile hike and uh,

616
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:50.570
it was exhausting to say the least.

617
00:36:50.571 --> 00:36:53.180
So this person is writing about long distance hiking.

618
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:58.610
Another great old man thing to do yoga,
hockey,

619
00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:04.230
ice hockey,
and a hiking
know.
Um,

620
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:05.310
all right.
Hey Bill,

621
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.180
I've been listening to your podcast long enough to know that you love hiking,

622
00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:14.370
you hate getting fat,
and you get easily annoyed by day to day bullshit.

623
00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.760
I really think you'd enjoy backpacking and Jesus

624
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:23.410
backpacking.
I know it's awesome,

625
00:37:23.411 --> 00:37:26.470
but can you call it something else?
Backpacking.

626
00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.480
I just feel like I'm fucking waiting for a bus,

627
00:37:28.481 --> 00:37:32.680
picking my nose by Ray to get the shit kicked out of me.
Hey,

628
00:37:32.681 --> 00:37:34.060
you guys want to go backpacking?

629
00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:40.020
It's a pack you put on your back and you go backpacking or long distance hiking.

630
00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.250
Okay,
let's call it that.

631
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:43.650
<v 0>Okay.</v>

632
00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:44.401
<v 2>It's a really,</v>

633
00:37:44.401 --> 00:37:47.880
I don't have long distance hiking freaks me out because I figured at that point

634
00:37:47.881 --> 00:37:52.140
you've walked long enough to run into something that can mall you to death slash

635
00:37:52.141 --> 00:37:56.760
rip your face off or at the very least just sort of bite your throat until it

636
00:37:56.761 --> 00:37:59.400
stops feeling the pulse,
you know,

637
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:03.270
start getting into that next weight class of animals.

638
00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.800
I don't know.
You know,
mountain lines,
black bear,

639
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:12.480
grizzly bear,
fucking Anaconda,
whatever.

640
00:38:12.481 --> 00:38:16.950
Exotic pet that somebody let loose that has no natural enemy that is now taking

641
00:38:16.951 --> 00:38:21.360
over the forest.
Um,
long distance,

642
00:38:21.361 --> 00:38:23.550
long distance hiking.
It's really,

643
00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:28.950
it's really freeing to walk away from civilization for a week or more with the

644
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:33.570
solid pair of boots and everything you need strapped to your back.
Dude.

645
00:38:33.571 --> 00:38:37.930
Fuck that.
You're more man or woman that I am.
I can't fucking deal with that.

646
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:42.550
I get scared.
I get,
I get freaked the fuck out.

647
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.850
I'd have to be out there with somebody who knew what they were doing,

648
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.540
who had a gun.
Uh,

649
00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.790
automatic to not even semiautomatic.

650
00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:55.930
I need something that I could spray and the general direction of the sound,

651
00:38:55.931 --> 00:38:59.020
I just heard and you know,
if we kill a couple of backpackers,

652
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:03.790
there's no one else around burying them as optional.

653
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:05.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

654
00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:07.900
<v 2>I would say leave them above ground because they'll get picked away a lot</v>

655
00:39:07.901 --> 00:39:11.770
quicker.
Then people will find their clothes.
I guess the bones would be there.

656
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:15.910
That's creepy.
See what happens when you go out in the wilderness,

657
00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:20.620
you start fucking talking about shit like that.
I live in a suburb.

658
00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:24.550
Okay.
There's plenty of people to shoot and I never think of it.

659
00:39:24.551 --> 00:39:25.420
They're right out there.

660
00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.850
Right fucking out there and I never think of shooting them.

661
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:31.630
All of a sudden you get me backpacking or long distance hiking and I'm trying to

662
00:39:31.631 --> 00:39:34.390
think out of bury bodies.
All right.

663
00:39:34.391 --> 00:39:37.180
Every time I finish a long hike,

664
00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:42.610
I come back looking healthier and leaner and feeling refreshed.
Yeah.

665
00:39:42.611 --> 00:39:45.790
Cause you were out there eating berries,
wiping your ass with fucking pine cones.

666
00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.390
That's it.
That's why you have a peculiar look on your face.

667
00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:54.650
No matter how much you eat on the trail,
you're guaranteed to lose weight.

668
00:39:54.651 --> 00:39:59.090
If you spend six hours a day hiking with a 35 pound backpack,

669
00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:02.660
there's no need to limit yourself to salads and juice.

670
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:07.930
I can't tell you how many times I've had older day hikers look at my backpack

671
00:40:08.631 --> 00:40:12.710
and tell me they wish they had done more backpacking when they were able to.

672
00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.790
It's a really unique experience.
Experience out there on your own.
Yeah,

673
00:40:16.791 --> 00:40:19.980
I bet it is.
Well,
what,
can you please write back and tell me,
uh,

674
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:24.860
what you do about animals,
man,
because I'm telling you right now,

675
00:40:24.861 --> 00:40:25.940
I'm not doing this.

676
00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

677
00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:28.520
<v 2>You know,</v>

678
00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.820
I only way I would do this is that if I was in a fucking platoon and we all had

679
00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:36.380
machine guns just in case I missed,
um,
anyways,

680
00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:37.911
oh,
here he goes.

681
00:40:37.911 --> 00:40:41.300
He's going to calm me down and it isn't nearly as dangerous or as difficult as

682
00:40:41.301 --> 00:40:43.910
people make it out to be.
If you stay on the trail,

683
00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:48.170
you'll usually run across another hiker every few hours.
Oh,
that's comforting.

684
00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.190
That's comforting.
Every couple hours I can run into Johnny Appleseed,

685
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:57.650
but during the other hour and 50 minutes minutes,
I'm on my own.
All right?

686
00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:59.340
Uh,
you're running,

687
00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:03.260
usually run into another hike or every few hours that can help you if you get

688
00:41:03.261 --> 00:41:05.420
hurt at bears,

689
00:41:05.421 --> 00:41:10.421
mountain lions and all those other base kill a lot fewer people than Los

690
00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:15.020
Angeles.
Traffic accidents do.
Well,
I used to do a bit on that.
Well,
obviously,

691
00:41:15.021 --> 00:41:19.410
because the fucking,
you know,
th this,

692
00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:24.300
you're running into one person every two hours,
sir.
Let's do the math here.

693
00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:28.130
Okay?
Here's the deal.

694
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:32.910
There's like 7 million people in Los Angeles,

695
00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:36.403
okay?

696
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:41.120
You can't fucking go anywhere without running into like a thousand fucking

697
00:41:41.121 --> 00:41:41.954
people out here.

698
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:46.790
You're somewhere where you walk every two hours and run into one human being.

699
00:41:46.791 --> 00:41:50.480
So obviously I can guarantee you if those lines and mountain lions would down

700
00:41:50.481 --> 00:41:53.420
here,
the death rate would be through the fucking roof.

701
00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.000
All right?
This is the guy.
This is what he says too.
He goes,

702
00:41:57.001 --> 00:42:00.330
just keep your food away from your tent and you'll be fine.

703
00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:03.961
Do you understand,
sir,

704
00:42:03.961 --> 00:42:08.790
that you're telling me to do something where if I'm too near my food supply,

705
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:13.800
I could possibly get eaten to death.
You want me to leave my living room?

706
00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:20.450
You know,
why can't I just sit on my back porch?
Listen,

707
00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:21.290
I would love,

708
00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:28.090
I would love to too.
Go hiking like that.
I,

709
00:42:28.091 --> 00:42:32.250
I really would,
but I can not get past.
Um,

710
00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:35.880
no,
I don't think you should be able to get past it.
That there's,

711
00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.980
that type of shit is out there.
All right.

712
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:43.260
And if you get mauled to death as a standup comedian,

713
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:47.240
yeah.
You've really,
we're just looking for trouble.
Warn you.

714
00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.930
I,
I,
that's,
you know,

715
00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:57.070
somebody just asked me to do a cruise to do stand up on a cruise and I,

716
00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:01.520
I told them I wasn't going to do it and they said,
why not?
And I said,

717
00:43:01.521 --> 00:43:05.430
because I'm terrified of the ocean.
Okay.

718
00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:08.880
That's why I don't,
I respect it.

719
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:13.380
The ocean is not the ocean is the ocean,
but it's,

720
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:17.430
it's literally you talking about

721
00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.780
it's outer space on earth.

722
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:28.150
That's what it is,
okay?
You can't breathe in it.

723
00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:34.270
You're not.
You can't be in it.
If you're in it too long,

724
00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:38.230
you're either going to get hypothermia or something's going to come up and take

725
00:43:38.231 --> 00:43:40.210
a bite out of yet to see if your edible

726
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:45.750
or you're going to drown.
Those are your three fucking options.

727
00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:49.920
And I know what you're thinking,
dude,
cruise is a safe man.

728
00:43:49.921 --> 00:43:54.921
You're out there on this big fucking boat yet and until you're not until you're

729
00:43:55.321 --> 00:44:00.140
not,
and then you proceed to die.

730
00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.580
One of these slowest,

731
00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:06.610
most terrifying fucking deaths that there is treading water in the middle of

732
00:44:07.761 --> 00:44:12.680
fucking nowhere and somebody's going to die no matter how fast they can fucking

733
00:44:12.681 --> 00:44:16.460
get you out there at.
Somebody is gonna die and people follow.
I fucking,

734
00:44:16.461 --> 00:44:19.460
we did one cruise in my life and I could not,

735
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:24.200
I couldn't get past the fact that I was on something that the second it fucking

736
00:44:24.201 --> 00:44:26.900
shits the bed.
And I know you guys think that you go,

737
00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:29.720
I've been on cruises and go fuck yourself.

738
00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.840
I talked to the band that was on this cruise ship for fucking years and they

739
00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:40.221
told me stories over a little fucking played a Jello late at night.

740
00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:46.170
Those awful cruise desserts.
So poor excuse for fucking,

741
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.011
I also,

742
00:44:47.011 --> 00:44:50.460
I don't like fucking going out there and all of a sudden it's maritime laws and

743
00:44:50.461 --> 00:44:55.450
this Douche bag who didn't even run for office is now telling me what the he,
he,

744
00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:55.810
he,

745
00:44:55.810 --> 00:45:00.810
it's whatever he says goes with his stupid ass fucking outfit.

746
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:06.810
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,
they told me stories.

747
00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:10.520
Okay.
They told me,

748
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:13.640
they told me enough fucking stories about food poisoning,

749
00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:16.700
about shit back and up about,
uh,

750
00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:21.590
one engine not working and now they're going half speed and then they don't make

751
00:45:21.591 --> 00:45:22.580
it to all the cities.

752
00:45:22.581 --> 00:45:26.330
And then they make up shit about hurricanes and then they have,
fuck it.
Trust me.

753
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:32.050
People have medical issues and having to be fucking helicoptered off in Sloan is

754
00:45:32.661 --> 00:45:34.910
quickly is human possibly possible.

755
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:38.450
Not to the best possible hospital to the nearest one.

756
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.990
<v 0>Okay.</v>

757
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:41.620
<v 2>All right.
And you're going on a cruise,</v>

758
00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:46.750
they go all over the fucking world and they go buy a bunch of fucking countries

759
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:50.350
that you wouldn't want to fucking get have.
I've have a Goddamn hangnail in,

760
00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:53.170
but all of a sudden they're the closest one and that's where the fuck you're

761
00:45:53.171 --> 00:45:57.310
going.
Dole.
Hey Doctor Harry,
hack it off.

762
00:45:57.311 --> 00:46:00.820
Fuck that.
Fuck that.

763
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:02.903
All right.

764
00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:09.600
Fucking combined standup comedy and waterworld.
I'm not doing it.

765
00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:14.610
All right.
So that's the thing of it.
I would absolutely love to go backpacking.

766
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:17.280
I would love to do that.
I would love to go up fucking mountains.

767
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:19.680
I would love to do that.
It's way better than going to the gym.

768
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:24.900
I understand 100% what you're talking about,

769
00:46:24.901 --> 00:46:26.680
but dude,

770
00:46:26.681 --> 00:46:31.681
that shit where you run into a bear mama bear and it just,

771
00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:33.460
<v 0>okay.</v>

772
00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:37.900
<v 2>Turns around and just runs it.
You 35 40 miles an hour,</v>

773
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:43.600
you basically,
and you're sitting there hearing this,

774
00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:45.850
this beast,

775
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:52.160
like trees getting out of the fucking way.
It's this thing is just coming,

776
00:46:52.161 --> 00:46:57.161
flying down the fucking hill at you and you're running knowing you're going to

777
00:46:57.321 --> 00:47:02.321
get caught and you hear and your stupid pots and pans click clank and together

778
00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:06.500
and all you're trying to do is just get out in front of your friend.

779
00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:12.100
So he's the one that goes down and so you can live knowing for the rest deal

780
00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:17.620
life what your strategy did.
Killed your friends here in his cries,

781
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:23.090
whatever the,
what is the sound of having your face ripped off?

782
00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:29.120
I like to lose weight like the next guy.
Jesus guy.

783
00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:32.120
You go out there with the a beer.
We have fucking bear mace.

784
00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:36.800
Fuck all of that bears,
mountain lions,

785
00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:41.850
poisonous snakes.
What about if he just,

786
00:47:41.851 --> 00:47:44.160
and then all the fucking varmints out there.

787
00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:48.360
I love that word because you send me Sam's the only person I ever heard use it

788
00:47:48.361 --> 00:47:52.260
and when I found out it was actually a credible word and not something made up.

789
00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:57.960
I absolutely love that word farm.
It's,
you know,
badgers,

790
00:47:57.961 --> 00:47:58.920
wolverines,

791
00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:05.610
bobcat's people get bobcat's like they're no big deal if it getting scratched by

792
00:48:05.611 --> 00:48:10.020
a fucking house cat.
How bad that that thing can fuck you up with its little ass.

793
00:48:10.021 --> 00:48:10.890
Fucking pause.

794
00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:13.163
<v 0>All right.</v>

795
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.990
<v 2>You,
you want a goddamn links jumping on.</v>

796
00:48:16.991 --> 00:48:21.880
You don't want to fucking town cause it's board.
Oh,
you're freaked out.

797
00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:27.450
Oh you came near to near something that had peed on and you have no fucking

798
00:48:27.521 --> 00:48:31.600
idea.
That's another thing,
dude,
you're,
you're in their world.

799
00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:35.500
This guy actually actually respected the fact that I said I'm not doing it,

800
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:36.700
but I honestly,
he,

801
00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.030
I think he thought it was pretty peculiar that I wouldn't do a stand up on a

802
00:48:40.031 --> 00:48:43.330
cruise.
I just jumped subject.
Sorry.
And uh,

803
00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:46.870
and I was waiting for him to ask me why and I would just be like,
well,
you know,

804
00:48:46.871 --> 00:48:51.160
would you do a podcast?
You know,
[inaudible] on a,

805
00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:54.370
on a boat in a lake that's full of fucking alligators.

806
00:48:56.590 --> 00:48:59.140
I mean,
you can lie.
Okay,
we're on the boat,
everything's fucking fine.

807
00:48:59.141 --> 00:49:02.960
But it's really is just an unnecessary risk that you take.

808
00:49:02.961 --> 00:49:07.840
It goes all the way back to that fucking saints fan.
He got off easy.

809
00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:11.890
That same fucking guy put that guy with his jersey,

810
00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:16.060
with his video cam camera walking up to a mama bear screaming who day,

811
00:49:16.061 --> 00:49:19.000
who day and all that type of shit.
He's worried about getting spit in his face.

812
00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.570
He would have bare saliva all around his fucking neck.

813
00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:26.683
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

814
00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:31.740
<v 2>Ah,
Jesus Christ.
I've actually thought about that.</v>

815
00:49:31.741 --> 00:49:33.690
Like what do I do if a bear was running right at me?

816
00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:38.720
I just wished that I would have the wherewithal to run right at it.

817
00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:42.380
Like,
you know,
if a shark was coming at me,

818
00:49:42.381 --> 00:49:45.710
swim right at it and it as quickly as you can,

819
00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:49.310
shove your fucking head in there and get it over with.

820
00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:55.300
That is the only fucking strategy.
What are you going to climb a tree?

821
00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:58.950
Things going to go right up that tree.

822
00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.980
Do you ever see that youtube video of those guys sitting in the tree hunting

823
00:50:01.981 --> 00:50:06.981
that bear and all of a sudden the bear just literally runs up the tree next to

824
00:50:07.111 --> 00:50:09.840
him and is like,

825
00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:13.170
like I dunno,

826
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:19.020
seven feet above them on the tree next to him leaning out,

827
00:50:19.021 --> 00:50:21.450
sniffing at them,
trying to figure out what the fuck they are.

828
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:25.590
And I love how the bears just instinctually instinctually know.
It's just like,

829
00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:29.930
like with that bear eight feet above you,

830
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:33.830
that's like when you were in the upper deck of a stadium,
you know,

831
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:38.060
and you shit faced and you get into it with somebody two rows behind you,

832
00:50:38.061 --> 00:50:42.410
they automatically have the advantage because they're punching down,
right?

833
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.840
You're going to lose that fight.
You're going to fall on your back.

834
00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:48.260
You probably going to break your ankle.
Something's going to get twisted.

835
00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:51.950
As this guy's punching down at,
you're not.
Just imagine it was a bear.

836
00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:55.220
That was the situation these people are,
and you got to check out that video,

837
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:56.900
this fucking bear.

838
00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:02.090
It was on the ground and they're whispering in their little fatigues looking at

839
00:51:02.091 --> 00:51:05.420
this thing and then this thing,
I don't know how it found him.

840
00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:08.420
You just hurt and that was it.

841
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:12.350
Over this thing was all of a sudden not on the floor of the forest,
20 feet down.

842
00:51:12.351 --> 00:51:15.170
It was now eight feet above them,
sniffing at them like,
Ooh,

843
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:19.490
is that a food source?
Jesus,
dude,

844
00:51:19.491 --> 00:51:22.460
you really just hit on like two people today hit on two tremendous fears.

845
00:51:22.461 --> 00:51:26.840
I have been alone in the fucking wilderness and and,
and being out to sea.

846
00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:28.903
<v 4>Okay?</v>

847
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:33.100
<v 2>Fuck both of those.
Although I want to hear the stories.
If you do it,
you know,</v>

848
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:34.280
not if you went on a cruise.

849
00:51:34.281 --> 00:51:38.120
I don't give a shit going out there eating Jello with the date rape drug,

850
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:40.730
fucking Weirdo,
you know,

851
00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:45.050
to go see the reunion of Wham city.
Lapa here's what,

852
00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:13.130
<v 4>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

853
00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:16.740
<v 2>Spilled burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

854
00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:22.200
October 18th,
2010 how the fuck are you?

855
00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:27.720
I'm actually doing this shit Sunday night and I posted it nice and early.

856
00:52:27.721 --> 00:52:30.660
Look at death.
That's a gift for you all.
You can't shout.

857
00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:32.550
They're bitching about how to actually,

858
00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:36.870
you should call it the fucking Monday afternoon.
You know,

859
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:42.450
I guess maybe you have a point,
but you know what about me?
What about my world?

860
00:52:42.451 --> 00:52:45.240
What about the fact that I record them Monday morning?

861
00:52:45.241 --> 00:52:49.200
So it's still the Monday morning podcast.
All right.

862
00:52:49.201 --> 00:52:53.060
It's fucking free.
I think.
I don't,

863
00:52:53.061 --> 00:52:57.050
I have the right to name the goddamn thing.
Um,

864
00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:58.101
speaking of which,

865
00:52:58.101 --> 00:53:02.330
if you'd like to make a donation to the Monday morning podcast and actually get

866
00:53:02.331 --> 00:53:03.560
a little trinket for yourself,

867
00:53:03.561 --> 00:53:07.820
go to the the m M podcast.com and get the uh,

868
00:53:07.821 --> 00:53:12.821
the old gee ring tone for your phone sales or picked up last week after I kind

869
00:53:13.971 --> 00:53:17.750
of broke your guys' balls about saving up for fucking happy meals.

870
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:22.700
You can't even kick me fucking 99.
God Damn sense I'm closing in.

871
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:24.290
This is just like PBS.

872
00:53:24.291 --> 00:53:27.840
I'm closing on the number that I need to go buy that fucking thing so I could

873
00:53:27.841 --> 00:53:32.040
start walking around doing these three things.
Maybe go to a mall and just,

874
00:53:32.041 --> 00:53:36.150
you can listen to me shit on people for a fucking 45 minutes.

875
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:40.410
It's actually,
you know,
something that's something I really want to do because,

876
00:53:40.411 --> 00:53:43.090
uh,
yeah,
I dunno.

877
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:47.940
I like to think I have love in my heart,
but I,
I don't think so.
But anyways,

878
00:53:47.941 --> 00:53:49.950
it was a a,
it was a big week.

879
00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:54.120
I'm just looking at who I wrote for Douche bag of the week and I spelled her

880
00:53:54.121 --> 00:53:58.830
name wrong.
Um,
anyways,
let's talk about the,

881
00:53:58.831 --> 00:53:59.280
uh,

882
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:03.090
the week coming up and I've actually been talking about this shit on stage and,

883
00:54:03.091 --> 00:54:06.510
uh,
I don't give a fuck because it's such a topical bit.

884
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:09.660
I don't even know if people are gonna think it's funny in a month.

885
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:14.870
But can we please talk about fucking Bill O'reilly going on the view?

886
00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:20.550
Um,
I gotta I gotta tell you something right now.

887
00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:24.360
I don't like that guy's politics.
I don't like his face.

888
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:29.820
He has that,
he has that racist face.
You know his,

889
00:54:29.821 --> 00:54:33.270
when he gets mad,
his fucking,
his face gets pointy.

890
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:35.100
He just looks evil.

891
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:39.690
He's just not a pleasant human being whatsoever.

892
00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:41.490
But I got to tell you,

893
00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:46.440
he fucking destroyed on the view.

894
00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:49.530
You know,
and I,

895
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:54.590
somewhere in there was a victory for men because he took on for fucking women.

896
00:54:54.601 --> 00:54:55.770
They were all yelling

897
00:54:57.330 --> 00:55:00.360
and he got two of them to walk off their own fucking show.

898
00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:06.120
How do you do that?
I as a comedian,

899
00:55:06.121 --> 00:55:09.300
I was embarrassed a to standup comic comics just quit,

900
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:14.640
which is why I'm nominating Joy Bay Har and Whoopi Goldberg is Douche bags of

901
00:55:14.641 --> 00:55:18.360
the week.
What?
What did you think was going to,
do you think he was going to go?

902
00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:20.760
No Way.
Don't leave.

903
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:24.720
That's exactly what the fuck he wanted you to do.

904
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:29.490
I was actually hoping at that point that the other two women were going to leave

905
00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:33.270
and then he could just start hosting the O'Reilly factor on the view.

906
00:55:33.271 --> 00:55:38.271
That would have been he just totally 100% dominated at the very least that

907
00:55:40.381 --> 00:55:42.840
segment,
because I,
I don't,
I don't watch that fucking show,

908
00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:46.980
but just,
he just came on.
First of all,

909
00:55:46.981 --> 00:55:49.540
he sits down and he's got on that shiny fucking,

910
00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:53.010
the Joe Pesci shoot Joe Pes Peshy suit.

911
00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:58.370
It's difficult to say Joe Peshy suit and he's got his fucking leg spread like a

912
00:55:59.281 --> 00:56:03.780
with his ball bag,
hang his shiny ball bag.
He locally,
if you ever see like,
uh,

913
00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:08.310
when Kennedy debated Nixon,
how,
if you listened to it on the radio,

914
00:56:08.311 --> 00:56:11.190
how everybody said Nixon won.
But if you watched it on TV,

915
00:56:11.191 --> 00:56:13.830
Nixon was all tanned up.
He had his legs crossed,

916
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:19.190
he looked like a winner and Nixon sat there with his fucking legs splayed and

917
00:56:19.351 --> 00:56:22.380
crossed like underneath the,
he looked like a fucking moron.

918
00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:26.440
That's bill O'Reilly looked like any,
he just,
he still dominated.

919
00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:31.390
I love when he turned to joy and was just whatever I,
I'm paraphrasing here,

920
00:56:31.391 --> 00:56:34.390
but he was just like,
be quiet and learned

921
00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:41.650
and she had nothing,
a fucking standup comic.

922
00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:43.090
She had nothing.

923
00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:48.520
The whole segment was fucking hilarious.
And when he goes,
uh,

924
00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:52.090
another gem of a moment was when he goes,
you know,

925
00:56:52.091 --> 00:56:53.380
a lot of people don't realize this,

926
00:56:53.381 --> 00:56:58.381
but 70% of Americans don't want a mosque at ground zero.

927
00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:02.320
And joy goes.
She goes,
well,

928
00:57:02.321 --> 00:57:05.050
I'd like to see that that poll or something like an,

929
00:57:05.051 --> 00:57:09.850
as she's saying that the crowd is applauding what bill O'Reilly just said.

930
00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:12.790
So you really don't need to see the pole at that point.

931
00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:15.610
And and getting beyond that,

932
00:57:15.611 --> 00:57:20.440
what he really should have said was 70% of Americans don't realize that they're

933
00:57:20.441 --> 00:57:23.260
not building a mosque at ground zero still,

934
00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:29.100
that they're actually making a rec room with a ping pong table and an area to

935
00:57:29.201 --> 00:57:33.610
pray.
Kind of like they have an area to pray it every fucking airport,
you know,

936
00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:34.181
three,

937
00:57:34.181 --> 00:57:38.680
four blocks up the street at a God damn coat factory is where it's actually

938
00:57:38.681 --> 00:57:39.191
being built.

939
00:57:39.191 --> 00:57:43.990
But the fact that he said that they're still building a mosque and then he got

940
00:57:43.991 --> 00:57:45.040
an applause break.

941
00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:49.750
Joy is so wrapped up into her own fucking opinion that she doesn't even hear her

942
00:57:49.751 --> 00:57:51.720
own studio audience back up.

943
00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:55.780
The guy that she's trying to shit on and the fact that this fucking guy,

944
00:57:55.781 --> 00:58:00.420
he's still putting out inaccurate information that people are still back in
edit.

945
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:04.330
It just was fucking awesome on all of those levels.

946
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:09.820
And a,
I like how Barbara Walters was old school.
Cool.
And she didn't walk off.

947
00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:14.170
She gave those two Douche bags of the week shit for walking off their own show.

948
00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:18.190
And then she got him with a nice little classy Zinger.
He said,

949
00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:23.430
Bill O'reilly's on here this week.
When we come back,
we're going to talk,
um,

950
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:25.540
or he's on the show today.
We're going to,
when we come back,

951
00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:29.830
he's going to talk about his new book called pinheads and Patriots.

952
00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:33.010
And then she looked at bill and she goes,
at this point,
I,
uh,

953
00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:37.360
I'm not sure which you are,
something like that.
It was a great little zinger,

954
00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:42.670
but she wasn't like judging the guy.
I Dunno.

955
00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.720
The whole thing was funny and just how bill O'Reilly is,
is,

956
00:58:45.721 --> 00:58:48.130
is viewed as this intolerant person.

957
00:58:48.131 --> 00:58:52.240
And then he comes on the show of a,
I guess mostly liberals,

958
00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:57.600
and then they show absolutely no tolerance for him and then throw a fucking

959
00:58:58.241 --> 00:59:00.610
temper tantrum and walk off their own goddamn show.
I mean,

960
00:59:00.611 --> 00:59:03.100
you can't tell me everybody over at,

961
00:59:03.101 --> 00:59:07.780
at Fox News wasn't literally jerking off to that moment.

962
00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:11.140
I bill O'Reilly Bomas became a fucking rock star in that moment.
I was,

963
00:59:11.141 --> 00:59:14.560
that was like a standup comic moment that he did to two comedians,

964
00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:18.220
which blew my mind,
you know,

965
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:22.340
and I know I'm always trashing the brides on the show,

966
00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:27.290
but that really was a chick way of handling,
losing an argument.
Like,

967
00:59:27.291 --> 00:59:29.400
I'm just going to get off up in storm Ma.

968
00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:34.520
He is so used to people paying for your drinks and holding the Goddamn door for

969
00:59:34.521 --> 00:59:34.880
you.

970
00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:39.680
You actually thought that as an adult that you were just going to walk off the

971
00:59:39.681 --> 00:59:43.370
shell and this was going to be this big moment and he was going to be like,
oh,

972
00:59:43.371 --> 00:59:47.100
wait a minute,
let me stop.
Uh,

973
00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:51.830
I loved it.
He was like,
go ahead and leave.
I don't give a fuck.
I'll continue.

974
00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:57.800
I'll take over your fucking show.
Um,
so anyways,
there you go.

975
00:59:58.870 --> 01:00:00.050
Douche bags of the week.

976
01:00:00.051 --> 01:00:05.051
Joe Bay Harbor and Whoopi Goldberg for walking off your own fucking show when a

977
01:00:05.581 --> 01:00:08.610
shiny suit fucking I,

978
01:00:08.611 --> 01:00:13.520
I can't say he's a moron because he,
he does.
No,

979
01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.720
I mean,
look,
he,
he,
he's very read up

980
01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:22.990
on that.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I,
I'm too stupid.
This is why I would,

981
01:00:22.991 --> 01:00:23.811
and this is right here.

982
01:00:23.811 --> 01:00:28.400
Why I would never engage as much as I disagree with his opinions.

983
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:33.650
I don't fucking pay attention to politics at all.
I don't,

984
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:38.600
I find it frustrating.
I find it to be it just a rig,
fucking gay.

985
01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:42.830
I don't give a fuck,
you know,
and I,
so I would never try to,

986
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.200
as much as I disagree with Bill O'reilly,

987
01:00:45.201 --> 01:00:48.890
I would never go on his show and try to fucking one up the guy and think I'm

988
01:00:48.891 --> 01:00:52.640
going to,
uh,
beat the guy in an argument about politics.

989
01:00:52.641 --> 01:00:57.060
It's like he's paying attention to these politicians the way I,

990
01:00:57.061 --> 01:01:00.590
I give a fuck about football.
I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna win that argument.

991
01:01:00.591 --> 01:01:05.210
I mean,
one only bring fucking Roy Jones Jr rover and start debating him in about

992
01:01:05.211 --> 01:01:09.020
boxing.
I know.
It's just,
it was,
uh,

993
01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.340
it was fucking hilarious at the whole thing was just,

994
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:18.230
it was hilarious and a big,

995
01:01:18.231 --> 01:01:21.980
big fucking victory for that fucking,
I dunno,

996
01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:27.770
I dunno.
I was high enough as a stand up comic.

997
01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:32.630
He fucking you just tap out.
That was embarrassing.

998
01:01:32.631 --> 01:01:35.780
Anyway,
so let's get on with the damn podcast for this week.
Um,

999
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:38.570
I kind of liked that you guys liked that format.

1000
01:01:38.571 --> 01:01:42.560
Just getting a Douche bag of the week out of the way right off the fucking bat.

1001
01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:46.760
Uh,
I know a lot of people in Denver are probably saying that referee,

1002
01:01:46.761 --> 01:01:50.600
you called that fucking pass interference on the jets.
I mean on the Broncos.

1003
01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.250
Put them right down there on the goal line.

1004
01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.580
Did the jets give that guy a game ball or what?

1005
01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:01.760
That was fucking hilarious because everybody in New York wanted to kill that
ref.

1006
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:03.710
I can't say it was just him,

1007
01:02:03.711 --> 01:02:07.850
but I mean he fucked up to pass interference calls where the Broncos were Mcginn

1008
01:02:07.851 --> 01:02:11.060
the jets receivers add a what?

1009
01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:14.990
A fucking time for a makeup call.
Huh?
Hey,
you go mark.

1010
01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:21.570
You're fucking,
he looks like that dude from entourage,
doesn't he?
Look,

1011
01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:24.720
I got to extend a fucking olive branch here to the Goddamn jet fans.

1012
01:02:24.721 --> 01:02:28.290
I hate to fucking say it,
but you guys got a good team.
I'm convinced now.

1013
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:29.210
All right,

1014
01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:32.280
and right now you probably rolling your eyes and I want you to shut your green

1015
01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:35.700
fucking fucking faces for a second.
All right?

1016
01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:40.890
This is what I,
I wait til mid October before I start do,
oh,

1017
01:02:40.891 --> 01:02:42.420
we're going to win your,
you're fucking shoppable.

1018
01:02:42.421 --> 01:02:44.520
That dumb shit that people do in August.

1019
01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:48.750
Those people who paint their faces and have horns on their hats and all that

1020
01:02:48.751 --> 01:02:49.584
dumb shit,

1021
01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:54.690
and you don't wear a shirt to the game in November to show people how crazy you

1022
01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:58.230
are because you don't know how to talk to fucking women.
Um,

1023
01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:05.240
this is what's scaring me about the jets as a New York jet hater is,
uh,

1024
01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.990
not only are they a solid team,

1025
01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:11.820
they got luck on this side and you fucking need that.
All right?

1026
01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:13.261
Patriot fan.

1027
01:03:13.261 --> 01:03:16.950
The tuck rule pulled that one out of the Goddamn fucking mothballs wherever that

1028
01:03:16.951 --> 01:03:20.070
one came from,
you need some luck and a,

1029
01:03:20.071 --> 01:03:25.071
the jet's got real lucky when the refs finally decided to call a pass

1030
01:03:25.561 --> 01:03:26.940
interference they got,
they got and that,

1031
01:03:26.941 --> 01:03:29.850
that's the type of shit that happens when you win a championship.

1032
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.440
I'm just letting you know jet fans,

1033
01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:34.700
cause I know you don't know what that looks like as a jet fan unless you,

1034
01:03:34.701 --> 01:03:38.760
you're in your fucking seventies at this point.
So,
uh,

1035
01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:42.570
but I do want to say this to all you country jet fans and I was going back and

1036
01:03:42.571 --> 01:03:47.130
forth with like 20 of them this week.
So I'm sorry if I didn't get back to you.

1037
01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:52.290
Um,
all the you shitting on the fucking patriots for getting rid of Randy Moss.

1038
01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:56.700
I got admit our offense kind of looked the exact same,
you know,

1039
01:03:56.890 --> 01:03:58.350
kind of look the exact same and look,

1040
01:03:58.370 --> 01:04:01.560
the Deon branch caught a touchdown fucking pass and we beat the ravens.

1041
01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:06.420
So we're foreign one.
I Dunno what the fuck that means.

1042
01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:09.240
Our defense looked a little bit better,
but I dunno,

1043
01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:14.480
this has been the weirdest year in history for NFL football where there's just,

1044
01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:17.940
there's nobody dominating,

1045
01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:23.160
there's just no front runner team,
you know,

1046
01:04:23.161 --> 01:04:26.850
and don't sleep on the fucking a Kansas City patriots out there.
Huh?

1047
01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:32.070
Jesus Christ.
They got our old offensive coordinator,

1048
01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:33.750
defensive coordinator,

1049
01:04:33.751 --> 01:04:36.960
old quarterbacks coach and they pulled that fucking play out.

1050
01:04:36.961 --> 01:04:40.650
We have fucking throw the ball to Mike Graybeal for a touchdown.

1051
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.640
Um,
yeah,
but there's,
there's nobody out there.

1052
01:04:45.641 --> 01:04:48.780
Raw Steelers came back big Ben.
They got him back.

1053
01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.890
I stayed away from that game.
I didn't bet it.
I was like to fucking steal.

1054
01:04:52.891 --> 01:04:55.140
It's 13 points.
They're going to cover that.
But there was something,

1055
01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:58.020
I got my stupid theory about division rivalry games.

1056
01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:00.090
This is something that's an embarrassing,

1057
01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:03.240
I'm actually doing this Sunday night so I don't even know if the colts one,

1058
01:05:03.241 --> 01:05:06.990
I picked the colts but I had a,
the colts given three.

1059
01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:09.600
But these were the bets I had this week.

1060
01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:13.870
And you can follow this all along on the [inaudible] podcast.com me and Paul

1061
01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:18.070
Versey have is season long bet.
We basically we were three games a week,

1062
01:05:18.071 --> 01:05:20.590
but now we're kind of addicted to it.
So now we're kind of up to four.

1063
01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:24.070
We're going to pick for each and at the end of the,
against the spread,

1064
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:28.780
the end of the year,
whoever has the uh,
the best record,
when's the pot?

1065
01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:33.040
And uh,
I went forward one last week.
I thought I knew some shit.

1066
01:05:33.041 --> 01:05:34.690
And this week I got my ass handed to me.

1067
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:40.120
The only game I want I think is the jets game.
I took the jets given three,

1068
01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:45.370
I just didn't believe in Denver's fucking quarterback and a,
but I had,

1069
01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:50.620
I had Oakland given six going to San Francisco.
I just,

1070
01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:53.020
San Francisco keeps shooting themselves in the foot.

1071
01:05:53.770 --> 01:05:56.440
Oakland's been paying kind of competitive as fuck it.

1072
01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.480
I'll take that and I lost my ass on that one.

1073
01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:03.780
And I went against my gut that has been telling me that Tony Romo is missing

1074
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:06.070
half a fucking chromosome.
And He,

1075
01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:10.660
despite the fact that he throws for 350 yards and the final minutes of the

1076
01:06:10.661 --> 01:06:13.150
fucking game,
he just doesn't get it done.

1077
01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:16.510
I went against that because I saw what's his face,

1078
01:06:16.511 --> 01:06:21.020
Brett Farve grab his God damn elbow last week during the Monday night game.

1079
01:06:21.021 --> 01:06:22.480
So I'm like,
he's an old fuck.

1080
01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:25.810
I don't give a shit how many horse tranquilizers they give him a,

1081
01:06:25.811 --> 01:06:30.070
they're not going to win.
So I lost that fucking game too.
And I got to admit,

1082
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:32.710
I have won money on the jets two fucking weeks in a row,

1083
01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.720
two weeks in a row,
two fucking weeks in a row.
So there you go.

1084
01:06:37.721 --> 01:06:39.940
So if you want to follow along and watch our Ra,

1085
01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:42.790
watch our NFL picks and that type of stuff.

1086
01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:45.310
I'm actually trying to talk less about the NFL just because I've really,

1087
01:06:45.311 --> 01:06:49.150
that's all that I've been talking about.
I feel for like the last two,

1088
01:06:49.151 --> 01:06:52.480
three weeks.
So,
um,
and speaking of which,

1089
01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:55.420
I actually ran into Nick Swardson and he asked me next time he could come on

1090
01:06:55.421 --> 01:06:58.970
here cause he wants to scream about fucking NFL football.

1091
01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:03.730
If you guys think that I am a psycho when it comes to that shit.

1092
01:07:03.731 --> 01:07:08.530
This guy,
uh,
he really like I was sitting,
I was telling him that bills,

1093
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:11.050
you know,
Bill's jets game where somebody,

1094
01:07:11.051 --> 01:07:13.450
like when I was taking a piss and somebody almost pushed me into the wall

1095
01:07:13.451 --> 01:07:14.740
because I was one of my mouth so much.

1096
01:07:14.741 --> 01:07:19.240
And I was telling him how I was thinking back afterwards of how I don't want to

1097
01:07:19.241 --> 01:07:24.040
end up with my teeth on the floor of a fucking half ass NFL stadium.

1098
01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:28.330
And he was like,
no,
no,
you did the right thing.
You did the right thing.

1099
01:07:28.331 --> 01:07:29.620
You should have talked more shit.

1100
01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:32.910
So I gotta get 'em on there cause I think it will be a on this podcast,

1101
01:07:32.911 --> 01:07:35.410
do another one of those special ones just because I think it will be interesting

1102
01:07:35.411 --> 01:07:36.244
to,
uh,

1103
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:41.230
hear me tried to be a recovered angry fan and uh,

1104
01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:46.120
and him saying,
no,
you got to steer into it.
Um,
anyways,

1105
01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.890
uh,
let's get with questions this week.

1106
01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:53.740
Somebody wrote me here and he said a bill.
Um,
I just got the DVD,

1107
01:07:53.741 --> 01:07:58.270
let it go in the mail and it was fucking awesome.
And,
uh,

1108
01:07:58.360 --> 01:07:59.200
before we even get going,

1109
01:07:59.201 --> 01:08:02.260
I want to thank this guy for by actually buying the DVD.

1110
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:05.560
And I also want to thank all you guys who went out and bought it.

1111
01:08:05.561 --> 01:08:07.450
It was actually number one last week,

1112
01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:12.640
the number one comedy download as far as standup comedy goes on iTunes.

1113
01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:17.630
So I want to thank all you guys and it was fucking huge for me to hear that.
So,

1114
01:08:17.631 --> 01:08:20.910
uh,
and then as far as comedy goes,
it was only behind,
uh,

1115
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:24.440
the soundtrack to get them to the Greek.
I don't know where the fuck it is now.

1116
01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:28.880
This point might be behind some fucking Nipsey Russell compilation,

1117
01:08:28.881 --> 01:08:30.980
but for one day I was number one.

1118
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:36.010
So please keep buying it and everybody's saying the same shit who has bought it.

1119
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:39.200
They're like,
wow,
it's even funnier than what I saw on comedy central.

1120
01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:43.790
And they took out some fucking
strong bits,

1121
01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:48.850
which I really feel that is accurate because they took out 16 minutes of the

1122
01:08:49.431 --> 01:08:52.190
special.
So if you think you saw it,
you still haven't seen it.

1123
01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:56.000
It's only fucking 10 bucks,
$10 in change.

1124
01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:57.583
Um,

1125
01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.910
so please check it out just so I can sell enough fucking units of this place.

1126
01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:03.500
These people I did business with.

1127
01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:08.740
We'll actually get in business with me again and want me to do another fucking

1128
01:09:09.051 --> 01:09:12.170
special.
It's how it works.
See if they don't make any fucking money.

1129
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:15.200
Next thing you know,
I will be on American idol.

1130
01:09:15.201 --> 01:09:18.980
Sit next to Steven Tyler and I'll be fucking,
I dunno.

1131
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:21.350
Well actually I guess I would be on last comic standing when I

1132
01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:25.970
have I said anything funny for 20 minutes.
Let's go.
Let's,

1133
01:09:25.971 --> 01:09:27.730
let's plow through this.
I,
anyways,

1134
01:09:27.731 --> 01:09:30.800
I just recently started listening to the podcast and whatever,

1135
01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:34.370
any fucking ways I like,
I'll conversational this guy writes it,

1136
01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.430
listen to the podcast and shit in any fucking ways.

1137
01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:42.410
I liked how you talk about pirating music slash comedy and how it's sucks ass.

1138
01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:46.160
I'm an independent musician and if I don't sell my singles for 90 cents a

1139
01:09:46.161 --> 01:09:48.620
fucking song,
my music career dies.

1140
01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:53.690
It doesn't matter that my youtube videos of songs have,
uh,

1141
01:09:53.691 --> 01:09:57.860
hundreds of thousands of hits or whatever actual sales mean everything.

1142
01:09:57.950 --> 01:10:02.900
I hear you,
I hear you.
Cause they will not get back in business with you.
Um,

1143
01:10:02.901 --> 01:10:07.790
so anyways,
he goes,
I have a question about alcohol.
Um,
I don't drink that much,

1144
01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:12.380
but when I do,
I drink excessively like twice a week.

1145
01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:16.370
Usually I blackout.
Nothing bad ever happens.

1146
01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:21.680
I just like drinking.
Jesus,
this sounds familiar.
Uh,
he goes on to say,

1147
01:10:21.681 --> 01:10:23.750
should I cut back?
I usually clean my,

1148
01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:29.210
I usually clean my apartment when I black out.
That doesn't seem bad.
However,

1149
01:10:29.211 --> 01:10:33.980
most people think I have a problem for getting that drunk on the weekends.

1150
01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:37.940
Uh,
I would appreciate your feedback.
Uh,
again,
let it go.
Was Great.

1151
01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:41.910
Worth the 10 fucking dollars.
Well,
thank you once again for buying it.
Um,

1152
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:44.900
yeah dude.
All right.
I got to tell you,

1153
01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:50.630
I've blacked out from drinking who hasn't?
Um,

1154
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:54.110
and I got to me and I've always been fascinated.
Oh,
the lovely knee is coming in.

1155
01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:58.880
Um,
I've always been fascinated.
It's freezing.

1156
01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:04.280
It's freezing in here.
Come on the podcast for a second.
We'll turn the heat on.

1157
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:07.310
Yeah.
Oh,
Jesus.
You know what,
she's,
she just picked up.
She,

1158
01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:11.870
I don't know where you got that.
She bought this fucking,

1159
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:17.390
it looks like a wooly mammoth pelt.
You're really into FERS.

1160
01:11:18.490 --> 01:11:22.200
Huh?
Pick up the microphone and talk into it this week rather than than me

1161
01:11:22.210 --> 01:11:25.470
interviewing.
Not Real far.
Okay.

1162
01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:31.080
I got this down to what is fo means fake in French.
Oh,
okay.

1163
01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:33.310
Jesus,
look,
you coming here all oily.

1164
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:37.690
It's fucking gross.
No,
it isn't.
Yes,

1165
01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:42.900
that looks like that used to be in the back of a van in the seventies I bet if

1166
01:11:43.231 --> 01:11:45.690
you put a fucking ultra violet light over it,

1167
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:50.220
reg Brady's Jesus on that from when he banged Florence Henderson.
All right.

1168
01:11:50.221 --> 01:11:52.560
I said it.
I said it.
It's disgusting.

1169
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:57.210
I don't like it like you've made that point several times,
but to you,

1170
01:11:57.211 --> 01:12:02.040
but not to the listeners.
I think they need to know God.
Listen,

1171
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:06.600
I'll be the judge of their
fucking,

1172
01:12:06.601 --> 01:12:11.110
it's disgusting.
You pull it up.
Hey,

1173
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:16.020
be quiet and learn something and oh my God.
Are you doing the bill O'Reilly?

1174
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:19.650
I'm trying to see if that works on all females because joy just shut up.

1175
01:12:19.651 --> 01:12:22.020
You know what's fucked up?
I actually Douche bags of the week.

1176
01:12:22.021 --> 01:12:23.030
I actually said joy bay,

1177
01:12:23.031 --> 01:12:26.340
Har and Whoopi Goldberg for walking off their own goddamn show.

1178
01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:30.420
Quitting his stand up comedians.
O'Reilly in there too or just the two of them?

1179
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:35.100
No,
I said that I don't agree with his politics,
but he fucking was,

1180
01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:38.550
he was the man.
It was their show.
They shouldn't have walked out.

1181
01:12:38.551 --> 01:12:42.270
It's true in my house.
You walk off,
you know what I mean?

1182
01:12:43.530 --> 01:12:44.370
It'd be like someone,

1183
01:12:44.730 --> 01:12:49.020
you had a house party and some guy came in like breaking shit was being a dick

1184
01:12:49.021 --> 01:12:52.260
and then to make him leave you leave your own fucking house.

1185
01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:53.353
I can't deal with this.

1186
01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.860
And you're waiting for him to say no.
So let's get back to this thing.

1187
01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:02.460
Can you please stop buying shit like that.

1188
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:06.150
All right.
You know what else she got?

1189
01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:10.530
How much really going to trash everything you got?
She found this cheetah print.

1190
01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:14.820
I didn't find it.
I paid for a yard sale.
You're like fucking peg Bundy.

1191
01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:16.620
What do you mean your,
your,
your,

1192
01:13:17.130 --> 01:13:21.790
your furniture blankets style that looks no,
it's,

1193
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:23.250
it's leopard.

1194
01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:28.590
She found this leopard print sort of table sort of something that you,

1195
01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:33.180
it's clearly the print on this basically saying,
you know,

1196
01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:37.140
fuck your hoary girlfriend on this.
That's what that says.

1197
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:41.910
And she went out and she got it and I'm like,
and she hates that.
Yeah.
And I said,

1198
01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:42.970
if you hadn't guessed no,

1199
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:46.980
and I told you to get the thing fumigated and you never did fumigated bill,

1200
01:13:46.981 --> 01:13:51.900
whatever the fuck you doing professionally cleaned.
Listen,

1201
01:13:51.901 --> 01:13:52.860
I'm trying to help you out.

1202
01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:56.250
If you're going to buy something used when it comes to,

1203
01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:01.170
it's going to be up against your body or whatever the f are you going to let me

1204
01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:04.470
finish my stupid point?
Okay.

1205
01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:08.350
Be quiet in learn and you keep doing it.

1206
01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:15.460
No,
listen to me.
If you're going to do shit like that,

1207
01:14:15.461 --> 01:14:18.250
like stay away from leopard prints.

1208
01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:24.490
Might I like it because that's my taste.
It's not your taste and that's fine.

1209
01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:29.830
Okay.
But we bought it off of some frigging Yuppie overlay.

1210
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:34.800
I did.
Okay.
It wasn't like I founded mentioned halogen areas.

1211
01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:39.400
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you just give the goddamn merit.

1212
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:42.850
They live across the street.
They don't live across the street.

1213
01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:47.490
You live far away or throw them off.
My one stalker,
throw him off.

1214
01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:49.090
Paranoid about.

1215
01:14:51.970 --> 01:14:56.630
Thank you for stopping by the broad.
I am dismissing you.
Oh my God.

1216
01:14:56.650 --> 01:15:01.000
Your kick is,
you're divulging too much information.
You're cold.

1217
01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:04.540
You're wrapped up in that woolly mammoth blanket.
I don't like it.

1218
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:07.510
You're really annoying me.
Just get outta here.
All right.
I'm serious.

1219
01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:12.010
I'm dead serious.
Go out to the kitchen and fucking cook something up.

1220
01:15:12.010 --> 01:15:15.700
Whip something up there.
Tweets.
Yeah.
You don't even believe it.
Dude.

1221
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:19.180
Did you turn the fucking heat on?
Cause I smelled that burning smell.

1222
01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:21.430
When are we going to step up our life?

1223
01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:26.290
I should really take a picture with our life.
Well,
this is what I want to do.

1224
01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:26.950
I'll tell you what,

1225
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:29.860
because I keep going to people's parties and they're living better than we are.

1226
01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:32.200
This,
this whole debt free life that we're living,

1227
01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:36.340
the level of freedom that we have.
Like,
it's,
hey man,
let's go see a movie.

1228
01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:43.150
And we don't have,
we don't have to work that day that we can take trips.
And I,

1229
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:48.020
we both had a white trash upbringing.
I'm not in my house.

1230
01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:52.480
Brash macaroni and cheese was a main dish.
And you had it with toast.

1231
01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:55.570
We used to eat chipped beef on toast.

1232
01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:59.080
You didn't have macaroni and cheese and toast for dinner.
Yeah,
we did.

1233
01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.480
And it was awesome.
No,

1234
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:05.170
but every once in a while we would have that as a dinner and I loved it.
Oh,

1235
01:16:05.171 --> 01:16:09.880
well we'd have chipped beef on toast.
What?
Beef chipped beef on toast.

1236
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:13.270
It was chips of beef from,
nope.

1237
01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:18.130
Like just imagine if you could freeze a cow.

1238
01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:20.740
You skinned it and then you froze it.

1239
01:16:20.741 --> 01:16:24.760
And then you walked up to with a hammer and chisel and you chipped off some beef

1240
01:16:24.761 --> 01:16:27.610
that's on.
And it came in this,
uh,

1241
01:16:28.690 --> 01:16:32.950
this mushroomy sort of a,
Oh my God,
what the fuck was that?

1242
01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.910
Oh my God,
what am I,
I'm trying to remember the name of that movie,
but it came,

1243
01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:43.150
it came in a sauce.
This is what you're saying.
Yeah.
And there was this,

1244
01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:45.430
I'm not really having a flashback to my childhood.

1245
01:16:45.431 --> 01:16:50.320
We had this other meal that we always involve bread cause it fills you up.

1246
01:16:50.321 --> 01:16:54.260
And we had like two pieces of bread.
It was like this mushroom,

1247
01:16:54.261 --> 01:16:58.000
he sorta looking shit that had these little red things in there.
No,

1248
01:16:58.001 --> 01:17:02.260
it's fucking gross.
That sounds grow.
Isn't that Cube steaks?

1249
01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:07.420
You'd be chewing it.

1250
01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:11.510
You'd be chewing it like hours later trying to get that tendon down.

1251
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:16.760
No,
I lived,
uh,
we always had food.

1252
01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:22.760
We know we hit,
we had our ups and downs.
My chuck was like the economy,

1253
01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:27.380
there was booms,
there was bust.
But unlike this country,

1254
01:17:27.381 --> 01:17:31.860
at some point we hit a level ground and then yeah,
we leveled off,
uh,

1255
01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:35.690
around my high school years.
But uh,
but it was a good time.

1256
01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:38.800
But what I'm saying is,
you know,
what are you saying?

1257
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:43.190
I'm just saying that we're living like we're still eating cubes.
Yes,

1258
01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:48.080
we're doing that.
But we,
but my point was though,
you even said,

1259
01:17:48.170 --> 01:17:51.740
why don't we have up new fucking table that doesn't have just

1260
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:59.180
stupid.
Trying to have style.
You're ridiculous.

1261
01:17:59.210 --> 01:18:03.470
You always think it has a leopard leopard print equals come Nia.

1262
01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:07.490
It equals come.
Does everyone know that?

1263
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:13.460
You think when it comes 30 seconds to wrap this up or vintage thing in the

1264
01:18:13.461 --> 01:18:16.780
balls,
I will kick you.
What do you Yoda

1265
01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:22.450
in the balls.
I will kick you.
Sorry.
Hacky and pressure.

1266
01:18:23.130 --> 01:18:26.890
I've never even seen that movie.
I've just seen enough hat comedy about it.
Yep.

1267
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:31.560
It's so forgettable.
Those are the most overrated piece of shit.

1268
01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:34.920
You're going to fear the wrath of the star.
We take some,

1269
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:38.940
I go back and watch sesame street.
Kermit the frog is still funny.

1270
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.800
Timelessly timelessly funny if you get the ones when Jim Hansen did it.
Yes.
Okay.

1271
01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:47.680
That time you ever seen that one where that guy comes in and they're trying to

1272
01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:52.600
teach you about instruments and he comes into the to the music store and he
goes,

1273
01:18:52.601 --> 01:18:55.810
uh,
and he goes,
what can I help you with?
And he goes,
I'd like to buy.

1274
01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:58.540
And he sounds like a trumpet.
And he goes,
and he goes,
yeah,

1275
01:18:58.610 --> 01:19:02.770
<v 3>my pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop.</v>

1276
01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:07.520
<v 2>Right.
So you're thinking in your head,
you're like,
oh that's a fucking trumpet.</v>

1277
01:19:07.521 --> 01:19:11.460
And the Duke comes back with like a like a snare drum.

1278
01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.150
And he goes,
no,
I didn't ask for a,

1279
01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:16.680
and then he could make them that they would just have somebody play the teacher

1280
01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:17.573
teaching you about.

1281
01:19:18.190 --> 01:19:21.330
But the guy wearing in the story was hilarious at one point he goes,

1282
01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:24.870
oh you're one of those.
Like he kind of gave him a little dig.
Like there was,

1283
01:19:24.871 --> 01:19:28.110
there was something in there for a,

1284
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:30.090
for adults and it's still funny,

1285
01:19:30.091 --> 01:19:33.660
but you go back and you watch star wars unless you just like reliving your

1286
01:19:33.661 --> 01:19:34.020
childhood,

1287
01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:37.230
which I understand cause I watch NFL highlights and look at football cards.

1288
01:19:37.231 --> 01:19:40.360
I do get that.
But I wasn't a Scifi kid,
but I,

1289
01:19:40.361 --> 01:19:44.010
I go back and I watched those and they suck.

1290
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:48.300
The acting sucks in that,
that the fact that they were doing this movie about,

1291
01:19:48.330 --> 01:19:48.660
you know,

1292
01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:52.830
space and the effects at the time didn't that shit like blow people away.

1293
01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:57.080
I thought that was the thing for it's time.
People were like,
oh my God,
yes,
no,
no,

1294
01:19:57.081 --> 01:20:01.590
no,
absolutely.
Absolutely.
But it doesn't,
it doesn't hold up.
Hold up.

1295
01:20:01.670 --> 01:20:06.240
Like it looks kind of cheesy and like be movie.
No,
like it sucks.

1296
01:20:07.410 --> 01:20:09.150
Just really getting to what?
What were we talking about?

1297
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:12.210
I have to get back to the podcast.
All right.
Oh,

1298
01:20:12.211 --> 01:20:14.640
I thought this was a part of the podcast.
If you don't stop talking,

1299
01:20:14.641 --> 01:20:18.720
I'm going to walk off my own podcast.
That'll show me

1300
01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:25.200
in protest.
There are listeners out here.
Do they know your opinion of,

1301
01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:30.550
you know,
vintage or old items like,
like a goodwill or a yard sale.

1302
01:20:30.551 --> 01:20:32.700
It's fucking gross that you feel like people are,

1303
01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:36.240
people either died in it or came on it.

1304
01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:39.660
This is seriously what bill things when it comes to like vent,
like I said,

1305
01:20:39.661 --> 01:20:42.210
vintage goodwill yard sale.
Someone either.

1306
01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:45.660
The thing is we donate stuff to goodwill all the time.

1307
01:20:45.661 --> 01:20:50.490
Have we done any of those things on any of those things that we,
God,

1308
01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:53.160
I can't believe you're saying.
No we haven't.

1309
01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:55.800
I'm gonna tell you right now there's not a t shirt that I own

1310
01:20:58.590 --> 01:21:01.890
needs to stop.
You need to stop asking the questions.
Well,

1311
01:21:01.891 --> 01:21:05.580
I never did anything gross and like the clothes that I donate to goodwill or

1312
01:21:05.581 --> 01:21:09.150
whatever,
it can be a parade if you're not going to be honest on the podcast.

1313
01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:12.181
Look at,
first of all,

1314
01:21:12.181 --> 01:21:15.510
you go down there and then all that God damn estate jewelry with those broaches

1315
01:21:15.511 --> 01:21:18.630
that somebody dead grandmother's stuff.
So what?

1316
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.300
That's fucking creepy.
So what do you,

1317
01:21:21.301 --> 01:21:26.100
what do you propose to people do throw it in the trash?
No,
I don't know.
I'm not,

1318
01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.090
people can do whatever they want.
I'm just,

1319
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:32.410
I just don't want you wearing some fucking Jack Klugman old trench coat.

1320
01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:36.780
Oh,
fucking itchy.
And it's just gross.
It's fucking gross.

1321
01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:40.170
We have the money to buy new clothes.
Go by him.

1322
01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:44.010
I like certain vintage clothes.
A lot of people do.

1323
01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:49.170
All right.
You need to not be such a snob about it.
No,
I don't.

1324
01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:52.560
I'm not a snob.
I not talking about us.

1325
01:21:52.561 --> 01:21:55.140
And that stepping it up at your snobby about stuff.

1326
01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.600
Any stepping it up as having nice shit in here now.

1327
01:21:58.601 --> 01:22:03.601
Grabbing a leopard fucking come table off the goddamn sidewalk if you don't

1328
01:22:03.751 --> 01:22:07.830
stop.
It's nice.
I like it.
It brings me happiness.

1329
01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:11.400
And just because you don't like it doesn't mean that I'm not allowed to be
happy.

1330
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:17.430
All right.
You know what?
You wore me out.
You're one.
All right,

1331
01:22:17.431 --> 01:22:20.430
well thank you for stopping by the podcast.
No,
I have to give,

1332
01:22:20.431 --> 01:22:23.050
I have to give because I already,
I talked to Greg,

1333
01:22:23.050 --> 01:22:26.310
Greg Fitzsimmons on the special one.
So I've already had guests.
I try to,

1334
01:22:26.311 --> 01:22:29.870
I try to do the guests thing every once in a while.
And uh,

1335
01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:33.570
you're a little pouty face is not going to influence me either way.

1336
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:38.910
Fine.
Um,
do me a favor.
Go out and,
uh,
go get me some ice cream or something.

1337
01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:42.720
Can you,
what's that?
What's that shit that the Italians make?

1338
01:22:42.721 --> 01:22:47.130
They're that awesome stuff.
Gelato.
I'm not going to get you gelato.
Why?

1339
01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:50.580
Because you kicked me out and you're cold hearted.
What if I asked really nice,

1340
01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:55.800
really nice taste in,
oh,
I asked nicely.

1341
01:22:55.801 --> 01:22:58.290
So what if I asked nicely?
It's too late.

1342
01:22:58.291 --> 01:23:03.150
You're not even asking nicely now you haven't,
you haven't given me a chance.

1343
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:07.930
I'm,
yeah,
it's been real.
Listen.

1344
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:12.220
He looked so beautiful right now and I was wondering,

1345
01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:16.410
there you go.
See,
that's how you get rid of your girl.

1346
01:23:16.411 --> 01:23:20.290
All you did was ask her to do you a favor and they storm out of the room.

1347
01:23:20.291 --> 01:23:24.190
So there's another one for you.
Um,
all right,
let's get to underrated.

1348
01:23:24.191 --> 01:23:29.140
Overrated this week.
How far into this fucking Paul?
31 fucking God.
Damn minutes.

1349
01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:32.220
Actually speaking a reliving your childhood.
Um,

1350
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:37.170
I actually every once in a while go through like I,

1351
01:23:37.171 --> 01:23:42.100
I'm really big on the NFL in the 1970s and I own complete,

1352
01:23:43.150 --> 01:23:43.983
uh,

1353
01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:48.970
sets of football cards basically from the late seventies to the early eighties,

1354
01:23:48.971 --> 01:23:53.971
which was basically when I was of the age when I should have been collecting

1355
01:23:54.941 --> 01:23:59.170
football cards all the way to the age where I was almost getting a driver's

1356
01:23:59.171 --> 01:23:59.620
license.

1357
01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:03.790
And it was getting a little weird and my parents were worried that either I was

1358
01:24:03.791 --> 01:24:08.020
a going to live at home for the rest of my life or bring a gun to school.

1359
01:24:08.050 --> 01:24:12.640
One of the other,
um,
let me get rid of this.

1360
01:24:12.930 --> 01:24:16.270
Close this window here.
Let's get to underrated.
Overrated for the week here.
Um,

1361
01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:20.470
overrated,
underrated,
overrated,
this person.

1362
01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:24.910
And this is for all any new listeners out there,
um,
of my podcast,

1363
01:24:24.911 --> 01:24:28.450
which I doubt I'm going to have for a while because evidently iTunes is done

1364
01:24:28.451 --> 01:24:32.080
with me and I know there's a lot of people,
if you are already subscribed,

1365
01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:37.290
this was the confusion last week with Brad is um,

1366
01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:42.640
if you're already subscribed to my podcast on iTunes for some fucking reason,

1367
01:24:43.150 --> 01:24:45.610
you can still get the podcasts each week,

1368
01:24:45.611 --> 01:24:48.430
but if you're a new listener and you search for the podcast,

1369
01:24:48.431 --> 01:24:51.430
it's not there anymore.
If anybody knows,

1370
01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:57.420
any computer savvy people out there knows a way that I can guide new listeners

1371
01:24:58.031 --> 01:25:01.870
to find where my podcast is on

1372
01:25:03.490 --> 01:25:06.310
Itunes,
I would really appreciate it.
Um,

1373
01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:08.770
I don't know if it's because you clicked on my website.

1374
01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:13.120
This is all shit my web guy handles so I have no fucking idea.
Please help me up,

1375
01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:16.990
won't you please.
All right.
Overrated.
Underrated for the week.
Overrated.

1376
01:25:16.991 --> 01:25:18.190
Lady Gaga.

1377
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:22.240
And this guy says a or this woman and I have no idea.

1378
01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:27.700
Why is it she can dress like a slim Jim Mascot and sing about being a cock tease

1379
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.560
and everyone thinks she's brilliant.

1380
01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:34.900
Did they listened to her lyrics and stop telling me she's beautiful on TV and in

1381
01:25:34.901 --> 01:25:38.770
magazines.
I'm sick of being told what to find attractive.

1382
01:25:39.010 --> 01:25:42.340
I don't know where they get their standard,
but this bitch is ugly.

1383
01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:46.900
Granted she has a nice ass from what I can tell by the rolling stone cover,

1384
01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:50.830
but I bet it's not even her real one.
A while I'm added,

1385
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:56.550
Brittany Spears is ugly to where does the media get its taste in women from uh,

1386
01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:01.450
come on man.
Back in the day Brittany wasn't hot,
you know,

1387
01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:05.690
before she went crazy and shaved her head and robbed that seven 11 or whatever

1388
01:26:05.691 --> 01:26:10.490
the fuck she did.
Um,
you know,
stuff that they might,

1389
01:26:10.491 --> 01:26:14.630
they might actually fix her up a little bit because I thought that,
um,

1390
01:26:15.090 --> 01:26:18.830
remember that video she did was she just wore the all red,
uh,

1391
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:23.150
latex outfit.
She looked like a fucking midget.

1392
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:26.900
I don't know what it was about that.
Was she not wearing high heels?

1393
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:28.783
She looked like,

1394
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:32.870
like how she would look like the morning after after you fucked her and you got

1395
01:26:32.871 --> 01:26:36.490
to see what she really looked like.
You know,
you know my theory about the,

1396
01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:41.480
the whole,
uh,
you know,
women with high heels shoes and you're thinking,

1397
01:26:41.481 --> 01:26:43.820
oh my God,
look at this girl.
She looks like a supermodel.

1398
01:26:44.630 --> 01:26:45.500
And then you get him home.

1399
01:26:45.501 --> 01:26:48.200
You get them out of the shoes and after you'd done doing what you do,

1400
01:26:48.201 --> 01:26:50.390
when they get up to go get some water or go to the bathroom,

1401
01:26:50.391 --> 01:26:55.160
he just see this midget and a thong wattle and across the fucking floor.
Um,
she,

1402
01:26:55.161 --> 01:26:58.050
that's what she looked like in that video.
Oh,

1403
01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:00.110
Jesus sees this is why I don't to fuck these,
you know,

1404
01:27:00.111 --> 01:27:05.000
something for all you cunts who give me shit about how the podcast is late every

1405
01:27:05.001 --> 01:27:08.240
week.
This is why I don't do it Sunday night cause I'm burned out from watching

1406
01:27:08.241 --> 01:27:11.840
fucking sports or I flew on an airplane and it's never funny.

1407
01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:16.760
This is the only part of the podcasts that ends up being funny is me talking

1408
01:27:16.761 --> 01:27:21.140
about how fucking unfunny it is.
All right,
let's plow ahead.

1409
01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:25.190
Did I tell you guys it was raining out here today and how every Douche bag out

1410
01:27:25.191 --> 01:27:26.930
here,
the second it starts raining in La,

1411
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:30.050
they start driving like there's six inches of snow on the ground.

1412
01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:33.740
Evidently it's because it never rains out here.
That all the oil,

1413
01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:38.630
transmission fluid and all that just sits there in marinates on the street.

1414
01:27:38.631 --> 01:27:40.880
And I guess when it rains it makes it extra slippery,

1415
01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:45.410
more slippery than it would be in an area where it actually rains.

1416
01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:50.750
But these fucking,
it's still not that fucking slippery.
Um,

1417
01:27:51.170 --> 01:27:53.810
continuing on,
these are just ideas.
These aren't even jokes.

1418
01:27:53.811 --> 01:27:56.990
I'm just presenting premises that maybe one day I'll be able to make funny.

1419
01:27:57.770 --> 01:28:01.820
Jesus Christ,
um,
underrated a pitbulls,
uh,

1420
01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:06.850
it fucking burns me up to see all the bad press pitbulls get because some

1421
01:28:07.101 --> 01:28:11.940
horrible luck abused one.
What?

1422
01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:13.041
Get,

1423
01:28:13.041 --> 01:28:17.330
because some horrible fuck abused one into killing into a killing machine yet

1424
01:28:17.331 --> 01:28:21.590
again that not like that.
I have one and he's a fucking marshmallow.

1425
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:26.060
You know how since,
uh,
you,
you should know since you have one too.

1426
01:28:26.061 --> 01:28:30.320
They're great dogs.
Um,
I like most dog breeds except for the one,

1427
01:28:30.670 --> 01:28:34.970
the tiny ones,
but pitbulls especially make great dogs.

1428
01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:39.560
They're the chosen breed of evil fucks,
I admit,
but on their own,

1429
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:40.910
they're nothing dangerous.

1430
01:28:40.911 --> 01:28:44.150
It's funny to see people act worry around my dog sometimes,

1431
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:49.420
but it's also kind of sad.
Yeah,
I would go with that.
But also I think that,
um,

1432
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:55.100
you should get some sort of training before you get either a pit bull,

1433
01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:59.270
a German shepherd,
a a,
a doberman pincher,

1434
01:28:59.271 --> 01:29:03.180
and even like a Labrador retriever,
any of those fucking dogs,
because

1435
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:05.761
I dunno,
they kind of,

1436
01:29:05.761 --> 01:29:09.870
I've learned through taking my dog to one of these dog whisperer people,

1437
01:29:09.871 --> 01:29:12.210
they really feed off your vibes and he's,

1438
01:29:12.211 --> 01:29:15.960
you notice I'm sort of an angry amped up guy.
So,

1439
01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:19.140
you know,
I'm not going to get into the fucking details,

1440
01:29:19.141 --> 01:29:22.380
but I've had to definitely adjust my behavior.
My dog's fine now,

1441
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:26.460
but it got a little shady there for a second.
Um,
overrated.

1442
01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:30.720
The Disney channel as far as I can tell on passing by this channel.

1443
01:29:30.721 --> 01:29:35.520
Sometimes it's,
it's uh,
fuck.
See,
now I'm yawning on the podcast.

1444
01:29:35.521 --> 01:29:39.060
This is all,
you can't sue.
Give me shit every week to do it.
Fucking Sunday night.

1445
01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:43.830
Um,
as far as I can tell on passing by this,

1446
01:29:43.890 --> 01:29:47.790
this channel,
um,
it's a preteen porn ring.

1447
01:29:48.150 --> 01:29:52.770
They take these 12 to 14 year old girls and dress them slutty and cover them and

1448
01:29:52.771 --> 01:29:56.460
makeup and then tell them to act twice their age.
Jesus,

1449
01:29:56.790 --> 01:30:01.170
what is with these shows where the kids are fucking 14 and they have problems.

1450
01:30:01.171 --> 01:30:05.460
I didn't have till I was in my twenties.
I was a moron when I was 14.

1451
01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:09.690
And so as everyone else,
I didn't do shit with my life.
Um,

1452
01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.240
then and neither did anyone.
It's disgusting.

1453
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:14.910
And it's a farce what they do to these girls.

1454
01:30:14.911 --> 01:30:18.990
You making my Dick Confused thinking I'm looking at a grown woman when I'm not.

1455
01:30:18.991 --> 01:30:19.890
Thank you.

1456
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:26.010
Lead me into 10 takes a lead me not into temptation.
Disney channel.

1457
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:30.780
And You wonder why there are so many pedophiles.
Um,

1458
01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:34.920
I don't think Disney's the reason why,
uh,
there's so many pedophiles,

1459
01:30:34.921 --> 01:30:37.860
but I do agree they're subtly making programming for them.

1460
01:30:38.610 --> 01:30:40.500
I don't even know if that's fucking true.
I shouldn't even say that shit,

1461
01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:42.150
but I will say like Calvin Klein,

1462
01:30:43.230 --> 01:30:48.230
if I was to guess is a 100% pro pedophile and uh,

1463
01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:53.700
I think that he had a meeting at some point.
It was like,
you know what,

1464
01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:59.540
there's an entire segment of the human population that is not getting their

1465
01:31:00.541 --> 01:31:05.130
needs taken care of when it comes to advertising and that is the fucking

1466
01:31:05.131 --> 01:31:09.600
pedophiles.
So with that,
let's come up with an ad campaign.

1467
01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:15.150
Um,
underrated,
legendary comedians.
Bill as a comedian yourself,

1468
01:31:15.151 --> 01:31:19.500
I'm sure you have nothing but respect for legends like Carlin prior or Lenny

1469
01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:23.410
Bruce,
Lenny Bruce.
But Carlin gets dismissed so often in favor of,

1470
01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:28.500
of the hacks they have out there today.
Uh,
for the most part,

1471
01:31:28.501 --> 01:31:32.200
the only thing most people know about him is that he,

1472
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:34.650
he's the seven dirty words guy.
Really,

1473
01:31:34.651 --> 01:31:39.390
that's how we honor a 50 year career of a comedy legend with him scare a bit.

1474
01:31:39.391 --> 01:31:43.950
He did in the 70s.
I know there was a supreme court case over it and whatnot,

1475
01:31:43.951 --> 01:31:48.630
but it just bothers me to see how many kids today know all about hack comics.

1476
01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:49.531
Like,

1477
01:31:49.531 --> 01:31:54.270
I'm not naming names and they've never heard of Carlin prior Bruce Hicks or

1478
01:31:54.271 --> 01:31:58.800
their work.
It's nice that there are comedians out there.
Uh,
okay,

1479
01:31:58.801 --> 01:32:02.860
now he's complimenting me so I can't read that shit.
All right.
Uh,
yeah,

1480
01:32:02.861 --> 01:32:05.440
I mean it is what it is.
It's one of those deals where,

1481
01:32:07.330 --> 01:32:12.040
you know,
uh,
I think I knew who Carla was when I was a kid because he was,

1482
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:16.840
he was at the height of his career when I was coming up in the 70s and the 80s.

1483
01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:22.300
Um,
but I had no idea who Lenny Bruce was until I got into standup comedy,

1484
01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:27.490
um,
at,
that's just,
I think that's just part of being young.
It is annoying.

1485
01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:32.430
Actually talked to one of my cousins the other day who's a,

1486
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:35.030
in her early twenties,
and,
uh,

1487
01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:40.740
I mentioned the kids in the hall and both her and her boyfriend had no idea who

1488
01:32:40.901 --> 01:32:44.530
or what that was.
It just,
I don't know.
It is what it is.

1489
01:32:45.330 --> 01:32:48.540
Overrated.
Beautiful women.
Um,

1490
01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:51.490
I don't mean because they're prone to deception.
I mean,

1491
01:32:51.491 --> 01:32:56.491
because some women are two beautiful in this sort of unfuckable kind of way that

1492
01:32:58.391 --> 01:33:02.560
just ruined a woman,
has to be a least a little flood.

1493
01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.520
So you feel like you can violate herself.

1494
01:33:05.410 --> 01:33:09.430
It's hell being with a beautiful woman anyways because you drive yourself crazy

1495
01:33:09.431 --> 01:33:13.330
thinking everyone wants what you have.
It's better to be with someone you learn.

1496
01:33:13.570 --> 01:33:18.190
You learn to find attractive in your own way,
and no one else can see it.

1497
01:33:18.250 --> 01:33:22.480
All right?
Oh Shit.
Okay,
these are,

1498
01:33:22.481 --> 01:33:26.500
here's his opinions.
That's a self esteem issue right there on your part.

1499
01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:29.980
You know?
But I do understand,

1500
01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:34.360
do you know what it is when a girl is just so,
it's not,
don't look,

1501
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:37.870
it's a combination of,
of beautiful and just nice.

1502
01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:43.720
Like have you met a girl who just so beautiful and so nice and you're so fucked

1503
01:33:43.721 --> 01:33:48.100
up and twisted that you can't have sex with her.
You just can't.
You're like,

1504
01:33:48.101 --> 01:33:51.070
I don't want to fuck you.
I want to take you to a movie.
You know?

1505
01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:54.040
And then you meet some skank and you're like,
I'm not taking you to a movie.

1506
01:33:54.610 --> 01:33:56.200
I want to fucking bend you over the dresser.

1507
01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:58.090
I believe that's a whore Madonna complex.

1508
01:34:00.710 --> 01:34:02.020
My the only one that feels that way.

1509
01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:05.350
I'm trying to think of if somebody on TV that you could relate to that's just

1510
01:34:05.351 --> 01:34:06.184
nice.

1511
01:34:08.410 --> 01:34:13.410
You know who's borderline is that fucking goofy chick who cooks Rachel Ray.

1512
01:34:15.010 --> 01:34:19.180
She's borderline.
So sort of like nice and innocent that you couldn't,

1513
01:34:19.181 --> 01:34:23.290
but it's literally that quality that just makes you want to fucking,
you know,

1514
01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:29.230
I dunno,
I can't fault in it.

1515
01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:35.260
Oh Gee,
let's continue underrated having a fun job.

1516
01:34:35.530 --> 01:34:40.060
This one is aimed at you,
Bill.
You like to bitch about how uh,

1517
01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:43.450
midgets insert midgets more on stones,
et Cetera.

1518
01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:48.850
Don't want to work often enough.
Can I clarify that stoner thing?

1519
01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:51.520
I made fun of a specific person.

1520
01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:57.240
A friend of mine who smokes way too much weed and every stone are out there.

1521
01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:00.020
Fucking sent me these emails.
We mean,

1522
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:03.080
do you got against or I guess cause I imitate you like that,
but what the fuck?

1523
01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:04.520
That's the standard voice for you.

1524
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.390
You find me a pot movie where someone doesn't talk like that and I'll do a

1525
01:35:08.391 --> 01:35:10.590
better impression.
But that's what everybody says.
I'll give you all,

1526
01:35:10.591 --> 01:35:13.640
he's coming down and put me in.
I'm not,

1527
01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:18.260
I'm coming down on my fucking douchebag friend who all he's done is smoked weed

1528
01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:22.340
and it hasn't been a good thing for him.
His quote,

1529
01:35:22.341 --> 01:35:27.060
I liked to smoke weed because it turns my life into a movie.
All right,

1530
01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:29.870
you have a problem at that point.

1531
01:35:29.871 --> 01:35:32.450
Now all you fucks who liked to smoke weed and listening to this shit?

1532
01:35:32.451 --> 01:35:37.010
I don't give a fuck.
I drink.
Wouldn't that be hypocritical?

1533
01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:41.990
And speaking of which,
I'm on the wagon again,
as of today,

1534
01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:46.010
I did not drink today.
Everybody and a,

1535
01:35:46.011 --> 01:35:50.030
I'm going to try to see if I can make it all the way to the rose bowl before I

1536
01:35:50.031 --> 01:35:53.390
fall off to fucking work.
And again,
yawning once again.

1537
01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:56.420
No,
I don't know what it is.
I,
um,

1538
01:35:58.010 --> 01:36:02.630
I just been eating the wrong foods and uh,

1539
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.800
I dunno.

1540
01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:07.910
And every night I've just been doing sets and I've had two Heinekens and next

1541
01:36:07.911 --> 01:36:12.740
scene.
Oh,
I have this distended white belly and I'm not liking it.
You know,

1542
01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:14.780
I was just at a party and I wasn't drinking,

1543
01:36:14.781 --> 01:36:19.220
but I was leaning up against the counter and normally it be digging into my
back.

1544
01:36:19.221 --> 01:36:23.420
But I had a nice,
a nice level of padding,
you know,

1545
01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:27.800
from fucking,
you don't really screwed me up was when I went to buffalo,

1546
01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:33.100
the goddamn buffalo wings was so good there that I have gone on a buffalo wing

1547
01:36:33.171 --> 01:36:38.120
kick and I found a couple places out here that have really good buffalo wings.

1548
01:36:38.121 --> 01:36:42.650
And um,
actually you want to hear the story,
this is what happened.

1549
01:36:44.050 --> 01:36:44.883
Um,

1550
01:36:45.170 --> 01:36:50.170
I woke up on Saturday and I'll be in Lca or Saturday as they say in Boston,

1551
01:36:52.730 --> 01:36:56.570
in Boston when the real hardcore Boston guys,

1552
01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:01.910
you know,
I saw him on Saturday.
You just sort of open your mouth,

1553
01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:06.380
say Thursday,

1554
01:37:06.381 --> 01:37:09.890
Friday,
Saturday,
Sunday.

1555
01:37:11.630 --> 01:37:16.490
Say,
um,
I woke up and I'm thinking,

1556
01:37:16.491 --> 01:37:20.120
all right,
college football,
Auburn,

1557
01:37:20.121 --> 01:37:24.590
verse Arkansas.
Lsu was playing McNeese state.

1558
01:37:24.591 --> 01:37:28.450
They're given 39 and a half points.
So they're going to fucking cover the spread.

1559
01:37:29.330 --> 01:37:32.330
Who else was playing?
Georgia was playing.

1560
01:37:32.331 --> 01:37:36.590
Vanderbilt was all fucking site and a,
we're laying in bed.

1561
01:37:37.190 --> 01:37:40.370
My beautiful girl wakes up and she said,
uh,

1562
01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:44.810
and she claimed the fucking TV.
It's like,
I'm watching TV.

1563
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:50.270
So I immediately got up,
acted like I was going to the bathroom,
and I walked out,

1564
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:57.460
sat in the living room,
and I turned on the fucking TV and I started watching,

1565
01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:00.390
uh,
who the fuck was,
I started watching the Auburn Arkansas game,

1566
01:38:00.391 --> 01:38:03.360
which was fucking ridiculous.
You know,

1567
01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:07.670
Arkansas end up scoring like 40 something points and they still lost by 20.

1568
01:38:07.671 --> 01:38:11.990
It was absolutely insane.
And so she's like,
Hey,
I said,

1569
01:38:11.991 --> 01:38:16.560
I dad's gonna Watch TV.
Right?

1570
01:38:16.561 --> 01:38:19.790
So I tried to bill O'Reilly.
I tried to do that and it just didn't work.

1571
01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:22.410
Didn't work.
All right.
She had a rough week.

1572
01:38:22.411 --> 01:38:26.130
She wanted to watch your stupid reality shows.
So I said,
fine.

1573
01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:30.410
I said,
fine.
All right.
And,
uh,

1574
01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:34.820
I grabbed my stereo.
One of my stereo speakers was busted.

1575
01:38:34.821 --> 01:38:38.480
So I took it down to this fucking local guy.
Sky's out of his God damn mind.

1576
01:38:38.690 --> 01:38:43.460
He actually repairs shit.
So I already loved the guy.
So I go down there,

1577
01:38:43.461 --> 01:38:44.780
I get that taken care of.

1578
01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:51.020
I know I,
what else did I do?
I went out,
I just,

1579
01:38:51.250 --> 01:38:53.710
I just fixed some shit.
I went out and I bought some stuff.

1580
01:38:53.711 --> 01:38:56.890
I fixed some shit around the apartment and I let her watch the shit.

1581
01:38:57.070 --> 01:38:59.170
And at one point I was picking up dry cleaning.

1582
01:38:59.290 --> 01:39:03.670
I was doing all these God damn chores and I just saw this fucking,
uh,

1583
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:08.270
this bar and I knew they had wings and I was literally going to go in to get dry

1584
01:39:08.271 --> 01:39:09.104
cleaning.

1585
01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:14.110
I was parked in the dry cleaner parking lot and I look across the fucking way

1586
01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:17.810
and there's a bar with wings and I get out like,
uh,

1587
01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:19.560
like the Manchurian candidate.

1588
01:39:19.561 --> 01:39:24.561
Like they just turned on my chip and I walked across the street and the bar and

1589
01:39:25.221 --> 01:39:28.100
next thing you know,
I'm sitting there,
I got a water,

1590
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:32.870
they've got a Boddingtons and I got a fucking order of a dozen wings and I'm

1591
01:39:32.871 --> 01:39:36.260
tearing these fucking things down.
Like I'm in a wing seat and contest

1592
01:39:38.010 --> 01:39:41.640
here I am consuming 800 fucking calories or whatever the hell it was.

1593
01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:46.940
1200 goddamn calories for no fucking reason cause I don't want to bother my girl

1594
01:39:47.461 --> 01:39:50.340
because she's watching.
She's watching a fucking shows.

1595
01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:54.030
So I do all his shit.
I only end up stumbling out of there.

1596
01:39:54.031 --> 01:39:57.900
And then I finally go over to get the God damn dry cleaning

1597
01:39:59.510 --> 01:40:01.950
and I come back,
right.

1598
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:06.790
And during that time a buddy my texts me said,
hey,
I'm in la.

1599
01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:10.310
Are you watching the Ohio state game?
I said,
well it's going to be on TV.

1600
01:40:10.311 --> 01:40:13.370
Why don't you come by?
I figured,
cause my girl would watch three hours of fun.

1601
01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:14.960
I have to whisper this Parker,
she's going to get mad.

1602
01:40:15.230 --> 01:40:18.800
I figured because she watched three hours of fucking TV that I could actually

1603
01:40:18.801 --> 01:40:23.700
have a friend over,
but like it douche rather than saying,
hey,

1604
01:40:23.730 --> 01:40:25.620
you know you watch TV for three hours.

1605
01:40:25.621 --> 01:40:28.630
So I'm going to have a buddy of mine over here now and we're going to watch the

1606
01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:32.360
hi,
hi.
Oh State Wisconsin game.

1607
01:40:33.610 --> 01:40:36.500
I actually gave her the benefit of the,

1608
01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:40.450
of the doubt that she was going to be courteous and I said,
hey,

1609
01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:44.600
a friend of mine is coming over to watch your house state game.
You know,

1610
01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:49.510
we can either watch it here or would you rather us watch it out at a bar?

1611
01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:52.800
You know,
cause I,
I thought she was going to be like,

1612
01:40:52.801 --> 01:40:57.120
well know I hogged the TV for three hours,
you know,

1613
01:40:58.510 --> 01:41:02.890
why don't you watch it here and I'll leave you guys alone.
She didn't.
She goes,

1614
01:41:02.891 --> 01:41:07.360
yeah,
go watch it as sports bar to now I was pissed.

1615
01:41:08.230 --> 01:41:12.550
You know like when you have like one slice of pizza left and you offer it to

1616
01:41:12.551 --> 01:41:13.241
somebody going,
hey,

1617
01:41:13.241 --> 01:41:16.270
do you want this slice of pizza even though you want it cause you're thinking

1618
01:41:16.271 --> 01:41:19.150
they're gonna go,
no,
no.
That's okay.
Because that's what you would say.
And you go,

1619
01:41:19.151 --> 01:41:21.340
hey,
would you like to slice of pizza?
And they go,
actually I would.

1620
01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:22.950
And then they start eating.

1621
01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:25.420
Then you sit in there for your fucking mad at them when you should be mad at

1622
01:41:25.421 --> 01:41:27.820
yourself like an asshole.

1623
01:41:28.150 --> 01:41:33.100
I got mad at her right and we had time to do a quick workout.

1624
01:41:33.101 --> 01:41:36.070
I just ate some fucking wings.
She wanted to go on a hike.

1625
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:39.550
So we start to go on this hike and I just started going on to the,

1626
01:41:39.610 --> 01:41:44.610
on this rant about the stupid whore TV shows that she fucking watch watches.

1627
01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:50.340
And we got about a third into the hike and she was like a wide receiver just

1628
01:41:51.281 --> 01:41:54.150
breaking off her fucking pattern.
She just made a right down.

1629
01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:55.590
We were supposed to be walking straight.
She,

1630
01:41:55.610 --> 01:42:00.070
she broke off me to write and started walking down a side street and I didn't

1631
01:42:00.071 --> 01:42:00.940
even give a fuck.

1632
01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:05.380
And I continued my own way and we both were hiking um,

1633
01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:08.410
separately,
you know,

1634
01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:11.290
broke off the whole fucking thing.

1635
01:42:11.291 --> 01:42:16.291
We ended up getting this huge goddamn argument before my friend came over and

1636
01:42:16.361 --> 01:42:17.980
then there was that whole thing like got fuck,

1637
01:42:17.981 --> 01:42:20.140
now I've got to patch it up before he comes over.

1638
01:42:20.290 --> 01:42:23.110
So he doesn't feel the tension that we've been fucking arguing.

1639
01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:28.180
And not only we arguing,
we're arguing about fucking him coming over.

1640
01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:34.840
So I smoothed it over.
She came back,
I said,
look,
I fucking overreacted,

1641
01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:38.680
Yadda Yadda,
yet I ain't even,
that ain't even have a fucking ending.

1642
01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:41.140
I don't give a fuck.
I'm just going to keep saying this because it's Sunday.

1643
01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:45.730
I'm going to read one more fucking email and I'm just going to tap out of this

1644
01:42:45.731 --> 01:42:50.650
awful fucking podcast.
What was the point of that?
Can anybody even remember what,

1645
01:42:50.651 --> 01:42:51.910
where the fuck was I even go,

1646
01:42:51.911 --> 01:42:56.911
I've started talking about about eating wings and being out of shape and then

1647
01:42:57.131 --> 01:43:00.580
the end of it,
I told a fucking half ass story about getting into an argument.

1648
01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:05.170
Now I can't even sign into my fucking this,
this,

1649
01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:09.340
this podcast is literally just unraveling,
unraveling.

1650
01:43:09.930 --> 01:43:14.650
I don't even drink today.
The fuck is my podcast.

1651
01:43:15.230 --> 01:43:17.260
Here's a youtube video of the week.
If you guys are like,

1652
01:43:17.261 --> 01:43:20.560
if you play drums and you want to see a guy who actually can kind of make his

1653
01:43:20.561 --> 01:43:24.880
drums and the way he plays sound like John Bonham's guys does a great job.

1654
01:43:24.881 --> 01:43:28.510
Look up a John Bonham swing feel,
feel F,

1655
01:43:28.530 --> 01:43:32.920
e e l and uh,
and tell me the guy playing drums.

1656
01:43:32.921 --> 01:43:34.360
Does not look like a,

1657
01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:39.070
was it ogre was the name of the fucking psycho in revenge of the nerds.

1658
01:43:39.071 --> 01:43:43.480
Tell me that's not him.
Um,
but hang on a second.

1659
01:43:43.690 --> 01:43:44.411
I gotta I gotta get,

1660
01:43:44.411 --> 01:43:47.470
I gotta get back here because I wanted to read something about douchebags sports

1661
01:43:47.471 --> 01:43:51.040
fans and then I'm going to end the podcast for this week.
This one really,

1662
01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:54.860
but I got him at the last couple of weeks were pretty good.
But this one,

1663
01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:59.900
this one was not good in the annals of Bill Burr podcast.

1664
01:43:59.901 --> 01:44:04.630
You know this one would,
will not make it to repeat if the,

1665
01:44:04.690 --> 01:44:08.300
if this ever goes into syndication,
somebody sent me a great fucking email.

1666
01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:14.630
Oh I know why because I had it on this page
about sports fans.
Right.

1667
01:44:15.630 --> 01:44:16.031
I'll tell you what,

1668
01:44:16.031 --> 01:44:19.280
as I'm searching for this fucking thing that I can't find anymore,

1669
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:23.180
God damn can't.
Um,

1670
01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:28.000
here we go.
He has some youtube videos out.

1671
01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:29.690
Cold reason to kill.

1672
01:44:30.650 --> 01:44:33.830
All of these are on the Mlm podcast cause some of these are actually from

1673
01:44:33.831 --> 01:44:38.030
break.com and a.
So rather than have to jump around websites,

1674
01:44:38.031 --> 01:44:42.950
if you want to watch all these,
um,
out cold reason to kill,
uh,

1675
01:44:42.951 --> 01:44:46.400
this is like inexplicably this fucking video.
This is a singer.

1676
01:44:46.401 --> 01:44:50.270
He's on the ground and there's a fan doing something to him that I just can't

1677
01:44:50.271 --> 01:44:55.090
believe.
And they proceed to have the worst fist fight in the history of,

1678
01:44:55.130 --> 01:44:58.160
of fist fights.
Uh,

1679
01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:01.490
look up Kendall on sharecropping field trip

1680
01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:07.340
one slap Kao at gas station.

1681
01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:10.320
That's actually from break.com.

1682
01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:14.060
And then look up massive knock out those things that kind of violent.

1683
01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:18.200
What the fuck did I do with the God damn email?
This kid sent me,

1684
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:22.610
this guy sent me a great email about as much as people hate the patriots,

1685
01:45:22.611 --> 01:45:25.580
they hate the cowboys more.
So we actually kind of,

1686
01:45:27.210 --> 01:45:30.770
I give up.
You know what I just fucking give up on this Goddamn podcast.

1687
01:45:30.771 --> 01:45:34.550
All right,
here's where I'm going to be this week.
All right,
you fucking pricks.

1688
01:45:34.610 --> 01:45:39.410
I'm going to be at,
uh,
the Wilbur Theater in Boston,

1689
01:45:39.411 --> 01:45:42.830
Massachusetts,
uh,
on Wednesday of this week.

1690
01:45:42.831 --> 01:45:45.860
This is a fundraiser for my brothers,
uh,
campaign.

1691
01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:50.810
He's running for a state Senate in Massachusetts,

1692
01:45:50.811 --> 01:45:55.070
not to be in the United States Senate representing Massachusetts,

1693
01:45:55.071 --> 01:45:59.690
but I guess they have a different kind of center to just in Massachusetts.

1694
01:45:59.691 --> 01:46:02.660
I'm too fucking dumb.
So whatever I'm going to do at a comedy show,

1695
01:46:02.661 --> 01:46:05.630
at the Wilbur theater,
it's my brand new hour of material.

1696
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:10.990
All proceeds will go to my brother's campaign to try to help him get elected.

1697
01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:15.500
I'm so come on down,
even if you're not in his district,

1698
01:46:15.501 --> 01:46:20.350
which I don't even know what the fuck it is.
Uh,
come on down.
And a,

1699
01:46:20.351 --> 01:46:25.040
I'm going to be telling a lot of family stories and uh,

1700
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:26.480
trying to walk that line

1701
01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:33.290
so I don't offend too many people because it is kind of a political thing.
Uh,

1702
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:38.350
and later on this week I will be at the Pantages theater in uh,

1703
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:44.210
Minneapolis,
Minnesota on October 22nd and the,
a wonderful,

1704
01:46:44.211 --> 01:46:48.770
talented teen idols sensation from the opiod.
Anthony showed Joe Derosa.

1705
01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:50.010
We'll be opening for me.

1706
01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:54.090
And then the following day we're going to be at the Vic Theater in Chicago,

1707
01:46:54.091 --> 01:46:57.000
Illinois.
October 23rd,
um,

1708
01:46:57.001 --> 01:47:01.320
that show from what I've heard is actually sold out.
Um,

1709
01:47:01.410 --> 01:47:04.170
and I think the one in Minneapolis is coming damn close.

1710
01:47:04.171 --> 01:47:08.580
So I want to thank you guys for the ridiculous amount of support that you've

1711
01:47:08.581 --> 01:47:13.380
given me and I'm going to give you a fucking hell of a show when you come down

1712
01:47:13.381 --> 01:47:16.920
there.
And,
uh,
I think that's it.
I think that's it for the podcast this week.

1713
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:21.420
It is,
was one of the lamest ones I think I've ever done.
Let me,

1714
01:47:21.450 --> 01:47:24.750
let me see if I can just somehow pull out of it.

1715
01:47:26.610 --> 01:47:31.440
Do I got anything?
This thing this guy sent me.
Robots are stealing jobs.

1716
01:47:32.670 --> 01:47:36.480
Robots are stealing American jobs according to MIT economist.

1717
01:47:37.590 --> 01:47:41.790
Uh,
forget the recession.
Immigration in the mortgage industry collapse.

1718
01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:45.570
Well,
okay.
Why?
How can you forget all of those?
Okay.

1719
01:47:45.571 --> 01:47:47.250
This is already a ridiculous article,

1720
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:50.730
but I think there was a point to be made here when it comes to the loss of

1721
01:47:50.731 --> 01:47:54.510
American jobs.
Robots are to blame.
And you know what's hilarious?

1722
01:47:54.511 --> 01:47:59.511
They got a picture of a robot with fucking arms folding a goddamn sweater.

1723
01:48:00.590 --> 01:48:03.390
Um,
that's the conclusion of a con economists.

1724
01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:05.940
Do you understand in the future that when you have a robot,

1725
01:48:05.941 --> 01:48:10.470
not only can it fold the sweaters at the gap,
it can also be security.
You know,

1726
01:48:10.471 --> 01:48:14.880
didn't you guys see Robo Cop?
Can't you see what the fuck is going to happen?

1727
01:48:15.210 --> 01:48:20.100
All you morons who are using these automated checkout machines just helping

1728
01:48:20.101 --> 01:48:21.150
these fucking guys.

1729
01:48:22.530 --> 01:48:27.530
Do you think these corporations are beyond leading you to a shallow mass grave

1730
01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:29.850
when they don't need you anymore?

1731
01:48:30.330 --> 01:48:35.330
When they figure out how to make a robot that can actually work for free and,

1732
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:39.150
and you can actually fuck it and it feels like a human being.

1733
01:48:39.151 --> 01:48:42.480
When those two things come together,
uh,

1734
01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:46.200
like when they drove that golden spike in,
when they made the railroads connect,

1735
01:48:46.201 --> 01:48:50.400
I'm telling you that's the end of it for you and for me.

1736
01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:55.260
Huh?
Be honest with yourself.
Are you inventing anything?

1737
01:48:56.490 --> 01:48:58.950
What do you do for a living?
You think you're not replaceable.

1738
01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:03.120
They get it.
You don't think they could have a robot.

1739
01:49:03.150 --> 01:49:07.470
They just fucking upload every goddamn routine of all time and you just,

1740
01:49:07.950 --> 01:49:12.090
you can just have like a a computer screen topics,

1741
01:49:12.091 --> 01:49:16.590
political,
absurd hacky,
what you know,

1742
01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:20.370
women,
men and women,
dogs and cats,

1743
01:49:20.371 --> 01:49:25.371
all that type of shit or just have it to a Richard Pryor bit and have it move

1744
01:49:25.471 --> 01:49:29.700
around like Richard and they have a red fucking shirt on like that.
Great.

1745
01:49:29.701 --> 01:49:33.510
Specially did.
We're all fucking replaceable.
All right,

1746
01:49:33.511 --> 01:49:36.690
why are you going to help him out anyways?

1747
01:49:36.691 --> 01:49:40.170
They say that's the conclusion of economists who've studied labor statistics and

1748
01:49:40.171 --> 01:49:45.171
increasing job peril polarization or growing disparity in the pay among low and

1749
01:49:45.631 --> 01:49:48.190
high skill,
low and skill jobs.

1750
01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:52.600
A handful of studies from the spring and summer have picked up steam in recent

1751
01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:56.800
weeks and they raised some interesting questions about the economy in the days

1752
01:49:56.801 --> 01:50:01.060
leading up to election day.
By the way,
how great have I become reading out loud?

1753
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:03.490
This is fucking amazing.
Now that I've said it,

1754
01:50:03.491 --> 01:50:05.320
let's see if I'm in my head and I fuck up.

1755
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:10.810
Manufacturing is still strong in this country.
It's just that robots,

1756
01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:14.560
not humans are the ones manning the factories.

1757
01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:20.050
If automation is the future of manufacturing and medicine and other fields,

1758
01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:23.890
less educated Americans could be left in the dust.

1759
01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:27.430
I gotta be honest with you.
I don't know what the way they just worded that.

1760
01:50:27.431 --> 01:50:30.610
I don't know where I stand on that.
Um,

1761
01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:37.260
I'm definitely think the world is overpopulated.
See this,
this,
this entrance,

1762
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:38.770
like that fucking Hitler Shit.

1763
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:41.770
You're going to have to start deciding who gets to live and who doesn't.

1764
01:50:43.630 --> 01:50:46.960
Uh,
Jesus.
Oh Geez.
So I dunno.

1765
01:50:48.220 --> 01:50:50.350
I actually took my fucking speakers,
right?

1766
01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:53.080
I found this guy down the goddamn streets somehow.

1767
01:50:53.081 --> 01:50:55.990
I'm going to stretch this into an hour.
I've got another two minutes.

1768
01:50:55.991 --> 01:50:59.860
I found this guy down the street
who I had,
you know the,

1769
01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:03.370
you know the thing you stick your iPod on and it's got the speakers and that

1770
01:51:03.371 --> 01:51:06.970
type of shit.
When I think broke one day and it just doesn't work.

1771
01:51:07.090 --> 01:51:10.870
So Nia is just like,
well,
let's just throw it out.
And I go,
no,
I want to get it.

1772
01:51:10.930 --> 01:51:14.950
I want to get fixed.
And she's like,
oh,
she literally gets like upset.

1773
01:51:15.580 --> 01:51:20.380
And I'm like this probably just a fucking wire or something.

1774
01:51:20.381 --> 01:51:24.310
I just don't understand electronics.
He could just open it up.
You could fix it.

1775
01:51:26.110 --> 01:51:30.720
And I find this fucking guy,
the first thing I did was had these old speakers,
uh,

1776
01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:34.660
that I hook up to my laptop.
And so I go,
all right,

1777
01:51:34.690 --> 01:51:37.110
I don't give a fuck about these.
I'm going to take him down to this guy.

1778
01:51:37.110 --> 01:51:40.990
Am I'm going to figure out if this guy is any good or anything and the guy fixes

1779
01:51:40.991 --> 01:51:42.520
them,
they're fucking phenomenal.

1780
01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:47.950
So what I'm doing is I'm gradually bringing this guy more expensive shit.

1781
01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:50.410
All right.
Now that's what I suggest.

1782
01:51:50.411 --> 01:51:52.810
When you find a guy who says he's going to repair your shit,

1783
01:51:52.811 --> 01:51:57.130
start with something you don't give a fuck about,
like a clock radio.
All right?

1784
01:51:57.460 --> 01:52:02.320
Let them repair it.
And if it works,
you're all fucking good,
right?

1785
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:06.160
Because I'm all about this shit by the way.
He's when something breaks,

1786
01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:11.340
you go out and he'd get it fixed because evidently there is a pile of shit in

1787
01:52:11.981 --> 01:52:13.330
the middle of the Pacific Ocean,

1788
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:18.510
one and a half times the size of Texas and two miles deep of all the shit that

1789
01:52:18.971 --> 01:52:21.790
we just fucking throw out.
All right?

1790
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:26.380
And then the sun breaks down the plastic as much as it can,
right?

1791
01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:31.360
And then it becomes these little cubes in birds eat it and fucking fish eat it.

1792
01:52:31.361 --> 01:52:34.270
And then you go down and he ordered some Sushi and you think you're eating

1793
01:52:34.271 --> 01:52:37.530
healthy,
you're actually eating your old fucking roller blades.

1794
01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:42.670
So I'm all about fixing the shit.
So this fucking maniac,

1795
01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:47.960
he's like really like eccentric.
His places an absolute fucking mess.

1796
01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:52.700
And he was talking about,
I want to give away his idea here,

1797
01:52:52.701 --> 01:52:53.840
but I'm kind of going to talk,

1798
01:52:53.841 --> 01:52:58.841
cause he was talking about how all recorded music since the beginning of history

1799
01:52:59.541 --> 01:53:02.980
is a fucking lie.
I'm like,
what?
What are you talking?

1800
01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:05.990
These are the kinds of conversations you have when you go into a fucking mom and

1801
01:53:05.991 --> 01:53:09.740
pop kind of place.
You know,
it isn't like Kilz snacks.

1802
01:53:09.741 --> 01:53:11.010
Can I help complains?

1803
01:53:11.550 --> 01:53:15.240
I'm sorry Thera we can't kids there anything else I can help you with this guy

1804
01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:15.860
and like to,

1805
01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:20.860
he's telling me this shit and he basically broke it down saying that he works

1806
01:53:23.150 --> 01:53:28.150
Monday through Saturday fixing electronics shit and on Sunday he goes on the

1807
01:53:28.911 --> 01:53:29.744
Internet

1808
01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:35.960
and he looks up the heights of,
of like Jimi Hendrix,

1809
01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:40.370
all the beetles and he tries to learn how tall they are so we can figure out

1810
01:53:40.371 --> 01:53:44.330
where to position his speakers.
And I'm like,

1811
01:53:44.331 --> 01:53:47.570
what the fuck are you talking about?
He goes,
look at Eco Simon and Garfunkel.

1812
01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:52.430
He's like,
Garfunkel was five 11 Paul Simon's like five seven and a half,

1813
01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:55.970
whatever for he was like new,
their exact heights.
He goes,

1814
01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:01.430
but when they do the mix they mix them like the,
the exact same height.

1815
01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:06.700
So He's trying to tell me that you got to put one speaker at five foot 10 or 11

1816
01:54:07.610 --> 01:54:11.730
and the other at five foot,
seven and a half to really sat.

1817
01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:15.860
Hear what it sounds like if they were actually in the room singing to you.

1818
01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:20.210
And when you really think about acoustics,
it actually fucking makes sense.

1819
01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:22.520
I know a lot of you are going like what the fuck,

1820
01:54:22.670 --> 01:54:26.360
but I'm telling you this guy broke it down where it made sense because think

1821
01:54:26.361 --> 01:54:29.090
about it like if I was standing,
if I was sitting down,

1822
01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:31.610
if your ears were good enough,

1823
01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:35.480
if you heard a recording of me sitting down or if you stay sitting in a room

1824
01:54:35.481 --> 01:54:36.380
with your eyes closed,

1825
01:54:36.650 --> 01:54:41.650
you could tell if I was sitting down or standing up in the room because you

1826
01:54:42.111 --> 01:54:44.090
could because of the way the sound was hitting you.

1827
01:54:44.210 --> 01:54:47.090
But when I guess when they record the shit,
they level everything out.

1828
01:54:47.210 --> 01:54:51.320
Like the drums don't sound like they were behind the piano player or off to the

1829
01:54:51.321 --> 01:54:55.340
left.
I guess everything sounds,
you know I'm too stupid to explain this shit.

1830
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:59.280
All I know was the guy in front of me.
He fixed this guy.

1831
01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:01.070
He doesn't just fix your speaker.

1832
01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:05.150
He asked you if he wants you to hook it up and do it the right way.

1833
01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:09.500
Same thing with like amps and guitars and I don't have the balls to bring in my

1834
01:55:09.501 --> 01:55:11.600
amplifier.
I'm trying to see if this guy's too buddy.

1835
01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:16.070
He basically played steely Dan out of one of this guys speakers in it sounded

1836
01:55:16.071 --> 01:55:20.660
like two speakers that the sound was fucking unbelievable.
So,
uh,
once again,

1837
01:55:20.661 --> 01:55:25.661
I don't know what the point of my fucking story was there other than fuck robots

1838
01:55:27.410 --> 01:55:29.630
fucked.
Let me wrap this whole thing up.
Fuck by.

1839
01:55:29.631 --> 01:55:33.380
An old furniture that has leopard print on it cause it's got TJ's on it.

1840
01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:36.290
Guaran fucking teed.
And if something breaks down,

1841
01:55:36.291 --> 01:55:40.040
why don't you try and get it fixed?
Speaking of which,
the blinds in my apartment,

1842
01:55:40.041 --> 01:55:44.130
my dog attacked him.
Like 90% of them are okay,

1843
01:55:44.131 --> 01:55:48.540
but I need some new slats.
Can anybody tell me where the fuck to buy those?

1844
01:55:48.541 --> 01:55:50.070
Because I want to repair them.
Once again,

1845
01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:54.900
Nia wants me to throw out the fucking things and just go buy some brand new ones

1846
01:55:54.901 --> 01:55:58.530
and it's like,
well what about the,
where the fuck did

1847
01:56:00.150 --> 01:56:04.200
to do my other blinds go?
Where did,
where,
where the fuck did those go?

1848
01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:09.090
There'll be a great documentary.
He just throws something out.

1849
01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:14.060
You put a microchip on it and you just follow it.
You know,

1850
01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:18.300
if he could somehow find the thing that ended up in the ocean,

1851
01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:20.940
that a fucking,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

1852
01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:24.290
tuna inhaled and then go to the restaurant

1853
01:56:26.490 --> 01:56:29.160
and just blow sad if we wouldn't fucking work with it.

1854
01:56:31.170 --> 01:56:32.700
You know what this podcast is like?

1855
01:56:33.340 --> 01:56:37.120
There's a bad thing that comedians do when they're not getting laughs and they

1856
01:56:37.121 --> 01:56:40.390
just think the next joke's going to get him a fucking laugh.
And they,

1857
01:56:40.391 --> 01:56:43.160
and they just stay on stage and they stand.

1858
01:56:43.210 --> 01:56:47.480
I should have tapped out at 50 minutes and just,
and just been like,

1859
01:56:47.481 --> 01:56:52.481
I've proven my point that when I do podcast on Sunday night is nice as it is,

1860
01:56:52.761 --> 01:56:54.860
that when you come in on a fucking Monday,

1861
01:56:56.330 --> 01:56:59.030
that there's already a podcast waiting for you at work.

1862
01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:01.940
Little fucking nice little ribbon tied around it.

1863
01:57:01.941 --> 01:57:05.630
It's just not as good is when I do them after I have a good night's sleep,

1864
01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:09.600
you know?
So,
uh,
there you go.

1865
01:57:09.810 --> 01:57:13.210
Overrated bill doing podcasts.

1866
01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:15.880
The Monday morning podcast on a fucking Sunday night.

1867
01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:20.080
I'm not doing this shit anymore.
All right.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1868
01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:22.690
If you want me to do it,
I don't give a shit.
All right.
That's it.

1869
01:57:22.691 --> 01:57:26.890
I gave you an hour and five minutes.
Not of a hundred percent mediocrity.

1870
01:57:26.891 --> 01:57:30.750
I started off.
All right.
But I think in general,

1871
01:57:30.751 --> 01:57:35.640
this one sucked a big bag of elk dick,
as they say in comedy business.

1872
01:57:35.670 --> 01:57:40.120
All right.
That's it.
That's the part.
That's the podcast for this week.
And,
uh,

1873
01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:42.090
I'll talk to you next week on Monday morning,

1874
01:57:42.091 --> 01:57:45.000
and you can fucking wait for the cunt face.

1875
01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:50.740
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>
