3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.520

Oh,

5
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:21.321
freckles has been fucking smoke at too many cigars and the fucking booze.

00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:24.660
I don't want,
I'm doing,
I don't want,
I'm doing,

7
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:29.310
I'm ready for my fucking year to be over.
I'm ready to be on a vacation.

8
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:32.820
I'm burned out.
I am burned out from

9
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.610
all the crap I've been doing.
I don't work this hard.
I'm a comedian.

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.430
I sit around on a couch all day.

11
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.460
I take up the Ukulele just killing a day waiting for my show at eight o'clock at

12
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:50.900
night.
So what I was supposed to be doing,
but uh,
you know,

13
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:53.820
you've got a couple of things going on.
I had to promote my special everybody.

14
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.800
For those of you,
uh,
who didn't hear,

15
00:00:55.801 --> 00:01:00.240
I have my new stand up special just came out a Friday.

16
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.460
It's on Netflix exclusively.
It's exclusively on Netflix.
It's called,

17
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:09.270
I'm sorry you feel that way.
And,
um,
got to admit,

18
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:13.620
people really seem to be liking it.
Thank Christ.
Um,

19
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.520
I want to thank everybody,
you know,
Netflix,

20
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:21.420
new wave j Charisse for a directing it,
um,

21
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.210
giving me the special,
the look,
the went that I wanted.
Um,

22
00:01:25.211 --> 00:01:29.940
and people seem to like it,
so that's all good.
It's all fucking good.

23
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.640
Um,
as far as you wondering,
well Wayne,
can I,
yeah.
Wait,
can I see guy buy it?

24
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.360
Um,
Netflix has it for a year.

25
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.580
One year from now when anybody who wanted to see it already has seen it,

26
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.870
then I'm allowed to sell it on DVD,
blue ray or whatever the fuck I want to do.

27
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.610
Uh,
you know,
you know the deal.

28
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.210
So,
uh,
that's when,
and that's when I'll,
I'll have it available.

29
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.080
That's just the deal.
That's just how it is,
you know,
considering,
uh,

30
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.500
the current climate on the Internet,

31
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:09.060
this is the way you have to do the deals because,
uh,
you know,

32
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.520
people fucking steal.

33
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.390
So somebody's willing to put the money up for this special,

34
00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:16.290
what the fuck are you going to do?

35
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:20.910
Plus Netflix works great for me because I like to try to travel as far as I can

36
00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:24.330
internationally speaking.
And uh,
you know,

37
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.830
Netflix seems to be getting more international as we go along.
So it's been,

38
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:32.820
it's really been a nice marriage between the two of us.
But seriously,

39
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:36.900
I got a ton of great feedback.
Um,
all my special and uh,

40
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.110
I feel it's my best work,
you know,

41
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.650
and now that I've said that you guys can be conscious and be,
we'll actually,

42
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:45.810
I saw you in premium blend in.
I felt,
uh,

43
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.160
the material combined with your fucking Valora shirt was much better.

44
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.540
Um,
the fuck did I wear on that?

45
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:57.420
I think I hit on it and we think it was a crushed velvet.

46
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.020
The fucking green button up shirt or something like that.

47
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:06.300
And black pants.
I can't remember.
It was one of those ones where the,

48
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.670
it became dated I think before the end of my set.

49
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.493
<v 1>MMM.</v>

50
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.820
<v 0>But,
uh,
you know,
if he wants to,</v>

51
00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:21.140
to while you take a chance and it doesn't work up,
I basically look like a,

52
00:03:21.141 --> 00:03:24.050
I'm in Robin Hoods.
Like if Robin Hood had an agent,

53
00:03:24.051 --> 00:03:27.890
like that's how you would dress,
whatever.
Nobody gave me shit that night.

54
00:03:27.891 --> 00:03:32.330
So everyone had watched was also guilty.
All right,
let's plow ahead here.

55
00:03:32.331 --> 00:03:37.250
So anyway,
so I have to take my fucking laptop over to this place here in my,
uh,

56
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.630
my part of Los Angeles and I take it over there and the guy figures out what I

57
00:03:41.631 --> 00:03:46.370
need is a,
I needed a new hard drive so he puts the new fucking hard drive in.

58
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.100
So this morning I go to,
you know,

59
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.000
<v 1>okay,</v>

60
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.380
<v 0>download all the information,</v>

61
00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:54.830
I get all your questions and whatnot and then make my list of subjects that I

62
00:03:54.831 --> 00:03:56.600
might talk about I might not talk about.

63
00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.730
So I go to open up this fucking zip program APP.

64
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.110
I don't know what the fuck you call it.

65
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.110
It's one of the things we can actually write.
You know,

66
00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:09.110
you can type some shit on it,
save it later,
and then like a document.

67
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.090
And I opened the fucking thing up and immediately it's just steering me towards

68
00:04:14.091 --> 00:04:15.710
this soundcloud Shit.

69
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.490
Yeah we can save it and then you can have it on all your devices that you know,

70
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.400
have you ever thought about how fucking dumb you are if you're using soundcloud?

71
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.240
I'm not even talking about is convenience the fact that you're just giving

72
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.450
access to your God damn life to chill took God knows hoe.

73
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.830
You know what and then you're going to sit around and yeah

74
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.790
<v 2>I believe somebody stole my identity.</v>

75
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.523
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.390
<v 2>A picture of my dick end up on the fuck.</v>

77
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.040
<v 0>That's like what are you doing?</v>

78
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.120
Don't give people access to your photos and your files and all of that shit

79
00:04:55.971 --> 00:05:00.230
because it's some fucking little kid mentality.
Well what if I lose them?

80
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.340
What do you got to fucking balloon tied around your wrist as what you got the

81
00:05:04.341 --> 00:05:06.110
backup hard drive for.

82
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.940
Put them on there and once a week just fucking send a few over there and then if

83
00:05:10.941 --> 00:05:13.310
something catastrophic happens to your laptop,

84
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.190
you can still have 98% of your shit you're going to survive.

85
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.860
So having said that,

86
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.390
cause anybody know how to disable that fucking Goddamn cloud.

87
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.490
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

88
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.210
<v 0>Fucking Weirdo man fucking creep.
That's just like some nerd.</v>

89
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.230
Like if you looked over and there's just some nerds standing in your window with

90
00:05:34.231 --> 00:05:35.640
his black frame glasses,

91
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.840
trying to look at all your pictures joint to see,
uh,

92
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.780
what the fuck you're writing about.
Trying to see what websites you're on.

93
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.470
The whole thing is fucking creepy.
You know,
it's really creeping me out.

94
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.640
Is somebody recently is trying to suggest that the camera that's on your fucking

95
00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:54.960
laptop is on all the time and potentially somebody could be watching you or it's

96
00:05:54.961 --> 00:05:57.540
recording you or whatever.
Um,

97
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.580
what the fuck are they going to save all of that.
You know what I mean?

98
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.350
Although it does kind of freak me out.
Um,
I just,

99
00:06:07.351 --> 00:06:10.250
I just had a bad week with the technology.
Everybody,
I um,

100
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.450
I am so fucking anti all of this shit and I know is,

101
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.960
I just feel like it's convenient as it makes your life.

102
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:20.300
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

103
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.810
<v 0>Yes.
The,</v>

104
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.800
the amount of fucking money it costs and shit crashing and then you've got to

105
00:06:25.801 --> 00:06:29.920
upload it.
And then try to figure out how to use the new shit and then then just,

106
00:06:29.921 --> 00:06:34.921
just more and more trying to figure out just spy on you the fucking spine or you

107
00:06:36.421 --> 00:06:41.421
for whatever reason to try to sell you more toothpaste or to just make sure they

108
00:06:42.091 --> 00:06:46.050
got enough dirt on anybody who ever decides to run for political office for the

109
00:06:46.051 --> 00:06:47.220
rest of fucking time.

110
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.740
Do you realize right now that the next president,
right,

111
00:06:52.741 --> 00:06:55.140
not the next president was some precedent in the future.

112
00:06:55.141 --> 00:07:00.141
Say some president in 2040 or whatever right now is probably getting videotaped,

113
00:07:00.691 --> 00:07:03.480
jerking off to something,
right,

114
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.900
and they're going to have all of that fucking information.

115
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.390
All the fucking creepy shit you did.
All your weird little thoughts.

116
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.940
<v 3>Okay?</v>

117
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.200
<v 0>All your insecurities,</v>

118
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:19.280
all every fucking thing they need to know about you to keep you in line.

119
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.860
I know everybody thinks this is like paranoid thought.
I know it's not this word.

120
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:28.650
J Edgar.
You know how much j Edgar Hoover would fucking love the cloud.

121
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.280
That fucking Weirdo used to sit there going around Washington trying to just

122
00:07:35.041 --> 00:07:36.540
have dirt on everybody

123
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.930
so you can walk up and talk to you and just know shit about you,

124
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.040
who you will fucking,
what you were doing if you were secretly gay or anything.

125
00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:49.180
And he probably sat there talking to you.
Right.

126
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.420
The weird look on his face.
You'd be like,
this guy's just giving me the creeps.

127
00:07:52.421 --> 00:07:55.030
Why is he,
why is this guy giving me the fucking creeps?

128
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.590
It's cause he knows about your life and he's so excited about it.

129
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.910
He's probably fuck his fucking Dick is probably at half mast as he's talking to

130
00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:05.440
you.
You know

131
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.370
Jay Edgar?

132
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.490
<v 3>Okay.</v>

133
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:16.320
<v 0>Yeah.
And then they tried to say that deck guy who actually was a,</v>

134
00:08:16.321 --> 00:08:20.760
he used to walk around in a dress all day.
Yeah.

135
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:21.860
I don't understand that.

136
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:29.260
I don't understand why you would want to walk around in a fucking dress as a man

137
00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:31.940
or a woman.
Not really the dress.
I can understand the dress.

138
00:08:31.941 --> 00:08:34.490
It's like having a bathroom that doesn't open.
Right.

139
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.670
Where are one of those fucking things?
You know,

140
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.940
I haven't had a smock.
I just don't get the shoes.

141
00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:45.890
Why the fuck would you want to wear?
I mean,
they look good.

142
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.470
They look good when the ladies prints around and,
but what the fuck would you,

143
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:50.031
why,

144
00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:53.330
why anybody in their right fucking mind would want to walk around and your tippy

you're like,
oh good.

147
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:04.920
I don't have to wear that shit to go out of your way to actually wear it.

148
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.840
Why would you do that to yourself?

149
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.850
You know why I got to kill it?
Dress up like a woman,

150
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:19.160

So Wednesdays can be my first just back to being a comedian again.

Back to my fucking playing drums,

162
00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.290
whatever the fuck else I used to do.
Go on hikes with my dog.

163
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.060
I cannot fucking wait and I got two,

164
00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:06.140
three weeks where I'm just going to chill out and buy,
chill out.

165
00:10:06.141 --> 00:10:09.080
I mean probably do stand up 80% of the nights cause I got to come up with the

166
00:10:09.081 --> 00:10:11.030
new act cause I got my big,

167
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.730
my big tours coming up of uh,
Australia,
New Zealand and uh,

168
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.600
parts of Asia,
parts of Asia,

169
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.280
Singapore,
Hong Kong.
Um,

170
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.330
Saigon did not work out.
Uh,
we're going to have to do that on the next one,

171
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.130
but um,
and then I'm going to some fucking place in India.

172
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.183
<v 3>Okay.</v>

173
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.420
<v 0>I don't know what it is.
I think it used,</v>

174
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.780
it's the place that used to be called Bombay.
Let me look it up.

175
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.970
I think it's there.
I shouldn't be saying that shit.

176
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:45.260
<v 3>Okay.</v>

177
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.620
<v 0>Let's see.
Bombay,
India.</v>

178
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.750
Let's see what it says here.
Yeah.
Mumbai.
I think that's where I'm going.

179
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.890
Jesus Christ will do these fucking pictures.
Feast of famine.

180
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.133
Um,

181
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:02.870
<v 3>okay.</v>

182
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.070
<v 0>Yeah,
so I'm going to be doing that.</v>

183
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.290
I'm actually a little creeped out to be flying around,
uh,

184
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.260
Asia and that type of shit.
Just cause,
uh,
I don't know,

185
00:11:09.261 --> 00:11:12.010
reading up on fucking aviation and that type of thing.
Just I'm,

186
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.690
I'm just hoping I have the whatever plane I'm on.

187
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.720
The copilot when he sees we're running out of gas,

188
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.860
doesn't give a fuck about embarrassing the captain and says,
Hey dude,

189
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.540
I'm not trying to be a dick here.
I'm not trying to get out of a out of line,

190
00:11:26.541 --> 00:11:29.620
but uh,
we're gonna fucking be on the ground at 10 minutes,

191
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.000
unless you fucking pulled over at a station.

192
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.870
We're running out of gas over here.
Look,

193
00:11:35.871 --> 00:11:38.300
I'm not even looking at you and might even looking at you captain.

194
00:11:38.301 --> 00:11:43.301
Not Trying to disrespect your authority or suggest that you're fucking up right

195
00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:47.320
now,
but you kind of fucking up right now.
All right.

196
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.830
I,
I'm,
I'm nervous about that.
Other than that,

197
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.150
that and getting chained in Singapore,

198
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.690
I've been told that you can just kind of do whatever you want on stage.

199
00:11:57.691 --> 00:12:01.620
It just doesn't make sense to me that if I'm in a fucking country that you can

200
00:12:01.621 --> 00:12:03.870
get arrested for spitting gum on the sidewalk.

201
00:12:03.871 --> 00:12:06.900
That I can actually go on stage and talk the way that I want to talk.

202
00:12:06.901 --> 00:12:10.950
I don't know about that.
Oh,
Billy Budd cheeks is going to find out though.

203
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.760
No,
I'm really looking forward to it.
Um,
it always,
uh,

204
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:19.770
you know,
it's always cool.
I'm,

205
00:12:19.771 --> 00:12:22.290
I'm hoping to actually be able to hang out with the locals,

206
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.220
drink a couple of beers,
shoot the shit here.
What the fuck they have to say,

207
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.610
meet some comics abroad,
Yadda,
Yadda,
Yadda.

208
00:12:29.611 --> 00:12:33.590
See what the fuck goes on over there.
That's going to start up a,

209
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.810
I don't even know.
Why don't I go to my own website and figure it out for you.

210
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.190
I actually did yesterday.

211
00:12:38.191 --> 00:12:42.030
I did four hours of phone or right in the middle of the football,

212
00:12:42.031 --> 00:12:44.970
so I missed a ton of football,
but I have to promote these,
uh,

213
00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:49.950
I got to promote these shows and a call some places in New Zealand and
Australia.

214
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.140
Dude,
Australians are fucking hilarious.

215
00:12:52.141 --> 00:12:55.560
I'm calling them up and almost every reporter was going,
um,

216
00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.540
so you're touring all of Australia?
And I'm like,
yeah,

217
00:13:00.541 --> 00:13:03.480
pretty much going across it and just about every,
uh,

218
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:04.670
<v 3>okay.</v>

219
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:07.670
<v 0>Every major city except that one city that begins with an,</v>

220
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.310
with an a that I'm getting a bunch of shit for,

221
00:13:10.311 --> 00:13:14.180
for not going to add a lay or whatever the hell it's called.
Um,

222
00:13:14.181 --> 00:13:18.770
it just didn't work out.
But anyways,
they all had the exact same question.

223
00:13:18.771 --> 00:13:20.890
They would just go and like,
yeah,
I see you know yet.

224
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.390
<v 3>Okay,</v>

225
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.370
<v 0>you're torn over here.
Uh,</v>

226
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.970
why kept asking me why?

227
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.450
And I was like,
I dunno.
Kind of seem like,
why?
Why not?

228
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.530
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

229
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:39.810
<v 0>Like why wouldn't I?
They've,
I don't know.</v>

230
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:44.460
They're like Tevya read up on anything that's going on down here.
Do you,

231
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.140
do you know what's going on in the news?
And I'm like,
no.
Yes,

232
00:13:49.141 --> 00:13:52.350
because your act seems really American.
I'm fucking American.

233
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.450
It's going to be fine.
Stop getting in my fucking head.

234
00:13:57.451 --> 00:14:00.810
I went to Melbourne and I've been to Sydney and it went fine.

235
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.220
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

236
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.590
<v 0>the fuck am I supposed to read up on wombats</v>

237
00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.470
just going down there talking about my life.

238
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.470
I guess it's going to be hot as fucking bulls when I get there.

239
00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:16.030
My first one is January 27th I'm going to be at a in Perth,

240
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.970
Australia and uh,

241
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:21.420
<v 3>yeah,</v>

242
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:26.040
<v 0>I guess it's going to be a could get upwards of 40 degrees Celsius.</v>

243
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.770
Now for you,
those of you in the land of America is the,

244
00:14:30.771 --> 00:14:33.740
is the easiest way to learn Celsius.
All right.

245
00:14:33.741 --> 00:14:38.120
Water freezes at zero Celsius and boils at 100 degrees Celsius.

246
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:42.200
It's really simple.
All right,
so you know water boils at,
what was it,

247
00:14:42.201 --> 00:14:45.130
212 degrees or some shit like that.
So all right,

248
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
so a hundred Celsius is two 12 that means 50 Celsius is like bought about 106

249
00:14:51.581 --> 00:14:54.580
degrees.
You just do it that way.
You just keep cutting in and half.

250
00:14:54.581 --> 00:14:56.290
He can roughly guess whatever the fuck it is.

251
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.920
So they said it gets up to about 40 Celsius.

252
00:14:59.921 --> 00:15:04.730
So they're talking over a hundred fucking degrees.
Oh,
freckles is,

253
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.070
I wasn't counting on that.

254
00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:09.180
I thought it was going to be nice and ball me cause I've,

255
00:15:09.181 --> 00:15:11.560
I've been there in October and um,

256
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:17.070
it was a little bit chilly sort of fall type of weather and uh,

257
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.320
I guess they were coming out of their way to,
um,
I don't know.

258
00:15:20.321 --> 00:15:22.810
But I'm looking forward to going to Perth and going to a bond.

259
00:15:22.811 --> 00:15:25.340
Scott is very there for my favorite band ever.
ACDC.

260
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.840
So I'm gonna go pay my respects there.
They've got a statue of him there.

261
00:15:28.841 --> 00:15:33.280
I'm going to walk around Perth for a day or so,
get acclimated to,

262
00:15:33.281 --> 00:15:37.720
uh,
you know,
the time over there,
which is fucking brutal.

263
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.420
That would actually be the furthest.

264
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:42.790
<v 3>Okay.</v>

265
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.070
<v 0>Oh No,
no.
Actually it wouldn't be,</v>

266
00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:48.240
that would actually be a better time zone for me.
Right.

267
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.590
Cause Sydney and Melbourne are further to the international dateline that's

268
00:15:52.591 --> 00:15:54.560
closer to it.
So I'm actually moving farther away.
Sex.

269
00:15:54.561 --> 00:15:57.750
You pick up a couple of hours.
Yes,
it's bad.
I'm sorry.

270
00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.960
Doing the math there and then,
okay.
So on January 27th,

271
00:16:00.961 --> 00:16:05.430
I'll be at the Perth Convention and Exhibition Center on the 29th,

272
00:16:05.431 --> 00:16:10.200
I'll be in Melbourne,
uh,
art center fucking thing.

273
00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.580
January 31st I'm in Brisbane,
Brisbane,

274
00:16:14.581 --> 00:16:19.581
however the fuck you say at Brisbane City Hall on February 1st I got two shows

275
00:16:19.861 --> 00:16:23.790
at the Sydney Opera House.
And then February 3rd,

276
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.680
I'm in New Zealand,
February,
Auckland,
Auckland town hall.

277
00:16:28.681 --> 00:16:32.760
And then I'm doing the Opera House in Wellington,
New Zealand.
So,
um,

278
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.060
you know,
I've heard nothing but great things about New Zealand too,

279
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:38.400
unless you go to Australia and then they always make fun of them,

280
00:16:38.401 --> 00:16:41.160
but it's just like you're just doing that because you got nobody else to make

281
00:16:41.161 --> 00:16:42.030
fun of down there.

282
00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:46.740
It's the closest fucking country right there,
right there.

283
00:16:46.741 --> 00:16:51.510
So you get to act like all the fucking Yahoo's live in New Zealand.
You know,

284
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.820
I've driven a little bit of Australia.

285
00:16:53.821 --> 00:16:58.080
I drove from fucking Melbourne over to the,
uh,
the fucking 12 apostles,

286
00:16:58.081 --> 00:16:59.970
whatever the hell they were.
And,
uh,
you know,

287
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.290
it got a little hairy there as we were driving around you and sell him saying,

288
00:17:05.291 --> 00:17:07.810
you know,
you get out there,
there's a lot of surfers and that type of shit.

289
00:17:07.811 --> 00:17:11.760
But I mean,
you know,
I dunno.
Australis fucking insane.

290
00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:16.870
Do you realize like the top 10 most poisonous snakes on the planet are all in

291
00:17:16.871 --> 00:17:20.140
fucking Australia?
Every last fucking one of them.

292
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.480
Like the inland Taipan has like enough venom.
Okay.

293
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.510
I mean,
it would fuck it.
Just drop a God damn elephant,
right?

294
00:17:29.511 --> 00:17:32.840
It bite the elephant.
And the elephant would be like,
oh,
what the fuck was that?

295
00:17:32.841 --> 00:17:36.050
And then just Bam down on the ground,
fucking over.

296
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:40.670
And then that thing would dislocate it's jaws and it could swallow that elephant

297
00:17:40.671 --> 00:17:44.870
whole,
I'm fucking with you.
He couldn't,
but it could fuck it up,
kill it.

298
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:46.380
And I evidently,

299
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:51.220
the reason why they have that much venom is because food is so scarce.

300
00:17:51.221 --> 00:17:55.370
So they have to be,
even if they just wing it,
you know what I mean?

301
00:17:55.371 --> 00:17:59.590
It'd be like a sniper shot you with a bazooka and just sort of grazed yet.

302
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.220
That would be it for you.
You'd be done.
You'd be finished.
So,
uh,

303
00:18:04.221 --> 00:18:06.370
I'll be wearing boots the whole time.
I'm over there.
Okay.

304
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:12.140
I'm going to watch them thigh high Timberland's snake proof shit.
Um,

305
00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.850
I don't know and I'm sure all the locals would be,
yeah.

306
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.850
Actually might dare actually fucking scared of you would have I don't give a

307
00:18:18.851 --> 00:18:19.684
fuck.

308
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:20.980
<v 3>Okay.</v>

309
00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:25.510
<v 0>I don't give a fuck.
So,
uh,
and I'm,
I'm,
I'm actually going to travel really,</v>

310
00:18:25.511 --> 00:18:30.270
really,
really,
really,
really light.
Okay.
So for all you can see,

311
00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:34.210
we're already going to give me shit going.
Bill,
you wore the same two shirts,

312
00:18:34.211 --> 00:18:38.920
the whole fucking tour.
That's right.
I did.
All right.

313
00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:43.780
Jim Morrison wore those smelly brown leather pants for an entire fucking tour.

314
00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.820
All right.
I can't go with it.
With two shirts.
Old Billy two shirts

315
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.290
once you are two shirt,
red fish,
blue fish.
That's what the fuck I'm doing.

316
00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.220
I'm going to have two pairs of pants,
two shirts,

317
00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.520
and then I'm dressing like I'm on the Sopranos when I'm on a plane,

318
00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.700
which means I'm wearing a little fucking track suit and that's it.

319
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.970
I'm going to have my fucking toilet trash with me.

320
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.180
<v 3>Okay.</v>

321
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.680
<v 0>And I am not bringing,</v>

322
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:12.330
<v 3>yeah,</v>

323
00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.430
<v 0>I'm not checking any fucking bags.</v>

324
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.730
<v 3>Okay.</v>

325
00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:19.480
<v 0>But here's the problem.
I'm traveling with my lady</v>

326
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.200
and you know how women travel,
you know they fucking,

327
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.640
yeah,
they fucking,
they bring a lot of shit.

328
00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.070
Why women be bringing all that shit?
Sorry,

329
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.550
I don't want it to early nineties def jam now.
Um,
all right,

330
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.060
let's get to the inbox here.
What do we got here?
Let's,

331
00:19:41.061 --> 00:19:45.320
let's get to some live reads for this week.
Oh my goodness.
Everybody.

332
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.700
Hey,
by the way,
I've actually figured out that I am dyslexic a little bit.

333
00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.580
I'm not like really bad,

334
00:19:52.581 --> 00:19:56.690
but I've really started to pay attention to it and the way words get jumbled up

335
00:19:56.691 --> 00:20:00.980
as I'm fucking reading them.
And then I look at a word and I think it says life,

336
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.420
but it's actually file.

337
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.000
<v 3>Okay.</v>

338
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.480
<v 0>It's not like the bill,
like a debilitating kind of fucking thing.</v>

339
00:20:07.481 --> 00:20:11.890
But I got a little adult,
you know,
you know a little bit.
A little bit.

340
00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:16.060
All right,

Great attention.

five grand,
he probably was 2,500 after taxes.

Another turn $2 in a 10 grand.
Wait,

403
00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:15.250
Why are they putting words in my mouth?

404
00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:19.600
But when it comes to handling your business calls,
you're stuck with a challenge.

405
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:24.190
Either hire a full time receptionist,
right?
Walking around in their little skirt,

406
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:28.060
threatening to ruin your marriage or handle all your calls yourself.

407
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:32.110
It's a lose lose unless you talked to your deck.

408

That's why I love he voice.

they will set your business up with a toll free number or a local number.

410
00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.690
Uh,
when customers called,

411
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:46.270
they're greeted professionally by a virtual receptionist that will route all of

412
00:24:46.271 --> 00:24:49.840
your calls to wherever you are.
There's even a dial by name directory.

413
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:50.710
You know what's going to happen.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.670
<v 0>All right,
here we go.</v>

428
00:25:35.671 --> 00:25:39.640
Let me get back to the Goddamn questions here for this week.
Um,

429
00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:40.760
<v 1>okay.</v>

430
00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.760
<v 0>What else did I want to talk about too?
That was a huge fire last night.</v>

431
00:25:43.761 --> 00:25:46.160
He went downtown La and it was just,

432
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:49.700
I'm pretty sure it's this apartment complex that I have been driving by.
Um,

433
00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.910
drove by it a lot this year.
I mean those of you who watched that Seinfeld thing,

434
00:25:53.911 --> 00:25:57.620
you guys know that I learned how to fly a helicopter this year.
And,
uh,
so I,

435
00:25:57.621 --> 00:26:02.190
I would get up early in the morning and as I was driving down,
you know,

436
00:26:02.191 --> 00:26:03.900
for my lessons,
um,

437
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.010
<v 1>okay.</v>

438
00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.580
<v 0>I would fucking drive by this apartment building that was going up in like two</v>

439
00:26:08.581 --> 00:26:09.900
seconds,
you know?

440
00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:13.220
And as I'm sitting there getting construction downstairs and that's taken off

441
00:26:13.221 --> 00:26:16.390
fucking goddamn year and I'm watching this thing just flying up in granted they

442
00:26:16.391 --> 00:26:18.360
got fucking a hundred person crew or whatever.

443
00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:20.123
<v 1>MMM.</v>

444
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:25.220
<v 0>This thing burned to the goddamn ground and these firefighters talking about it</v>

445
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.220
was hilarious.
Was saying how big the fire was,

446
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:32.630
was saying that they actually call it like this was a career fire.

447
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:33.970
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

448
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.490
<v 0>You know,
like a quarterback had a career day,
you know,</v>

449
00:26:37.491 --> 00:26:41.480
go in 35 or 38 for 460 he had a career day.

450
00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.310
These firefighters have like a career fire.

451
00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:50.770
How fucking great and expression that is that are there any fire fighters who

452
00:26:50.771 --> 00:26:55.420
listened to this?
I want to hear about your career fire.
You know,

453
00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.180
I want to use some from some firefighters.

454
00:26:59.240 --> 00:26:59.600
<v 3>Okay.</v>

455
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.530
<v 0>I want to hear what's the most fucked up thing you you've seen in a fire.</v>

456
00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.630
I don't mean anything disgusting about death.

457
00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:10.760
I mean afterwards as you're going through the fucking rubble,

458
00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.950
trying to find like what caused the fire.

459
00:27:13.951 --> 00:27:17.930
Have you ever just found like a safe at the bottom of it and nobody's claiming

460
00:27:17.931 --> 00:27:22.510
it?
You know,
and then you try to get the fat fuck from the firehouse.

461
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:26.030
The Guy who makes the Chili to come over there and try to pick it up and put it

462
00:27:26.031 --> 00:27:29.540
in the back of your fucking dodge Ram.
You know,

463
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:34.100
it sounds like a fucking movie with Billy Bob Thornton.
All right?

464
00:27:34.101 --> 00:27:35.390
And we don't tell anybody.

465
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:36.950
<v 3>Okay.</v>

466
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:41.450
<v 0>Ends up being some fucking,
come on,
man.
He can't tell me every once in a while</v>

467
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.070
you went in there,
your risk,
your life.
I mean,
fucking burn into deaths.

468
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:50.130
Gotta be one of the worst deaths ever.
And you face that every fucking day.

469
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:54.780
You can't tell me that when you're rummaging through that you find you don't

470
00:27:54.781 --> 00:27:57.660
find a couple of trinkets and be like,
you know what?
I earned this.

471
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.500
Stick it in the front fucking lapel pocket of,

472
00:28:01.501 --> 00:28:05.130
you're a heavy duty rubber rain coat there.
Does that made out of rubber?
Right.

473
00:28:05.131 --> 00:28:07.830
It would melt.
I Dunno.
I want to hear some fire stories,

474
00:28:07.831 --> 00:28:09.240
but I want to hear about people getting burned up.

475
00:28:09.241 --> 00:28:13.720
I don't wanna hear about that shit,
but I just like,
uh,
you know,
is,

476
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:14.603
is the logo,

477
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:19.170
are you the low guy on the totem pole as a firefighter where after the big boys

478
00:28:19.171 --> 00:28:20.190
put the fire out?
Yeah.

479
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.920
The guys got to sit there pissing on it for like the next three days.

480
00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:24.750
Just standing up there.

481
00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:26.100
<v 3>Okay.</v>

482
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.230
<v 0>Going back and fuss gotta be the shittiest job ever.</v>

483
00:28:28.231 --> 00:28:32.790
There's no fucking excitement whatsoever.
You know what I mean?
It's like,

484
00:28:32.791 --> 00:28:35.550
you know,
you've got the,
he got the fucking maniac who writes the book.

485
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:39.410
He gets to drink whiskey,
be suicidal and fuck bitches.
Right then.

486
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:41.640
Then you've got the guys,
the proof reader in the end.

487
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.110
Got To make sure the past part is both.
There's that put the pluck an adverb,

488
00:28:46.111 --> 00:28:47.100
whatever the fuck they do.

489
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:49.290
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

490
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:50.670
<v 0>That's what,
that's what that guy is.</v>

491
00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.840
That guy's the firefighter equivalent of like a proof reader,
you know,

492
00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:59.160
or that guy in the locker room who picks up all the towels after all the
players,

493
00:28:59.161 --> 00:29:03.220
fucking rub the balls with them.
That's what that is.
That has to be,

494
00:29:03.221 --> 00:29:04.290
there's no way.

495
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:10.130
There's no way you're in the starting lineup at your fucking firehouse and you

496
00:29:10.131 --> 00:29:13.120
got to do that shit.
You're not doing that.
Yeah,
they wouldn't notice the flavor.

497
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:18.920
Alright,
come on.
Do you guys break that guy's balls when he's up there?

498
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:25.150
Hey,
make sure you spray over there.
I think I saw a fucking spark it to,

499
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.950
um,
anyways.
All right,
let's talk a sports.
You know what?

500
00:29:32.951 --> 00:29:37.951
I watched very little football this week because I was wrapping up watching a,

501
00:29:38.411 --> 00:29:42.320
I was,
I was binge watching is the children's sales that,
uh,

502
00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:47.400
that show,
uh,
the killing.
Um,

503
00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:52.410
I've watched the first two seasons about a year ago and I started to watch

504
00:29:52.411 --> 00:29:56.070
season three a,
the first episode.
I don't know what happened.
I just got busy.

505
00:29:56.730 --> 00:30:00.540
And what was cool is a,
during the time it took many jumped back on,

506
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.690
um,
seasons,

507
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:08.640
not a season four was shot and was uploaded.
So I got to watch the whole series.

508
00:30:08.641 --> 00:30:13.110
So I,
uh,
you know,
season four only had like seven episodes,

509
00:30:13.111 --> 00:30:16.620
so I just Kinda was blowing through those sinks.
So I missed a lot of games.

510
00:30:16.621 --> 00:30:21.510
I did watch the Seahawks Eagles game and uh,

511
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.800
Oh my God,
fucking Paul Versey is so God damn funny,
man.

512
00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:27.710
<v 3>Okay.</v>

513
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:31.280
<v 0>Years ago,
right.
He said that,
um,</v>

514
00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:36.420
he said that,
you know,
after three games and he said,

515
00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:41.280
Mark Sanchez was a star.
All right.
And I said,
Paul,

516
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.350
it's been three fucking games.
He's a rookie.

517
00:30:43.351 --> 00:30:47.000
You don't think he's going to have that for game,
you know,

518
00:30:47.001 --> 00:30:50.160
four picks in a game that picked six or whatever.
He's a rookie.

519
00:30:50.161 --> 00:30:52.920
Blahblahblahblahblah classic Paul Versey,

520
00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.590
he sees a guy out of the gate playing well and then goes,

521
00:30:56.591 --> 00:31:00.900
this guy's going to be the greatest fucking ever.
Right.
Um,

522
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:05.340
so anyways,
so the guy,
you know,
he feet,

523
00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:07.320
it didn't work out for him.
I'm not saying,

524
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:12.210
and I'm going to pay him in saying that the guy is a,
uh,
a bad quarterback.
Yes.

525
00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.360
He's not a bad fucking quarterback but,
but like,
you know,

526
00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.910
I mean people will act in like you had to call them up Sanchez,

527
00:31:17.911 --> 00:31:22.110
like he was a franchise quarterback.
Right.
So anyways,
um,

528
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:26.280
so yesterday he's Qb and for the eagles and he's having a,

529
00:31:26.281 --> 00:31:30.230
he's having a good game and fucking Versie rights end.

530
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:33.330
He finally admitted that he was wrong about Sanchez.
So now this Eagle's game,

531
00:31:33.331 --> 00:31:36.060
he's playing good against Seattle and he said,
he goes,
dude,

532
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:39.960
I may have been right about Sanchez dude can ball,

533
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.140
maybe not a star,
but good for sure.
It's just like,

534
00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.460
you see how he tries to warm out of it?
He goes,

535
00:31:47.461 --> 00:31:49.590
I may have been right when,

536
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.400
when you said the guy was a star Sanchez and all that,
and then he goes,

537
00:31:53.401 --> 00:31:57.030
maybe not a star,
but good for sure.
And it's just like,
dude,

538
00:31:57.031 --> 00:32:00.210
that's not what you said.
I never said Sanchez wasn't a,

539
00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:04.830
it wasn't a good quarterback.
So of course they were in Becky,
you're the worst.

540
00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:09.360
You said he was a star.
All right.
I don't want to fucking get involved in this.

541
00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.210
We mean verse,
he went round and round because you know I did this weekend.

542
00:32:12.211 --> 00:32:17.211
I actually test drove some fucking Kaz and I took out that Mercedes Benz station

543
00:32:17.851 --> 00:32:21.250
wagon,
AMG,
the biggest fucking

544
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:27.180
on the planet.
Dude,
this car was the shit.

545
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.180
I'm going to upload some video,
right?
The car,

546
00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.760
like when you go to park the fucking car,

547
00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:38.070
the steering wheel moves itself like it has sensors all around the car.

548
00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:44.120
So you'll put it in reverse and it cuts the wheel automatically and gets you to

549
00:32:44.141 --> 00:32:47.650
a certain point and you just control the pedals,
the gas to the brake,

550
00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:50.200
and then you put it in drive and then it turns it the other way.

551
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:51.920
You got to see this fucking,
uh,

552
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:53.020
<v 1>okay.</v>

553
00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:53.890
<v 0>This fucking video.</v>

554
00:32:53.891 --> 00:32:58.230
I went over there with a buddy of mine and a test drove a couple of fucking cars

555
00:32:58.231 --> 00:33:01.150
do this car was so fucking bad ass.

556
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:07.230
I'm driving down the hill and there was this fucking smoke shelf as they say on

557
00:33:07.781 --> 00:33:10.540
Barstool Sports,
walking this dog.

558
00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:15.600
And the last time I drove and I drove by in a car and a woman locked eyes with

559
00:33:15.791 --> 00:33:20.710
me the entire fucking way before looking away and horror.
I can't even remember.

560
00:33:20.711 --> 00:33:22.420
I think I was in my college years.

561
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:25.870
I fucking came down in a fucking station wagon.

562
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:30.730
She should be running the other way.
This car was so fucking bad ass looking.

563
00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.510
She fucking locked eyes with me.
The whole,
I couldn't believe it.

564
00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:35.730
It's like I went back in time.

565
00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.133
<v 1>MMM.</v>

566
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:42.350
<v 0>Took out one of those in and I took a different one that was like a four door</v>

567
00:33:42.351 --> 00:33:43.830
coupe and a dude.

568
00:33:43.831 --> 00:33:48.200
That's the fucking car that is the car because that is like,

569
00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.870
it's a supercar and you can put a bunch of people in it.

570
00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.740
Either you get the sedan or you get the,
uh,
the station wagon.

571
00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:55.760
And Paul Versey just kept,

572
00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:59.230
I kept telling Paul how fucking sick the car was and he just kept going at it.

573
00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:02.090
It's just a station wagon.
I just can't get by it.
I was like,
Paul,

574
00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:03.860
that's what makes it fucking cool.

575
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:07.340
It's the fact that it is a station wagon and you'd look like,

576
00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:11.060
do you think the person's a nerd and that they got their groceries and a bunch

577
00:34:11.061 --> 00:34:14.750
of pacifiers in there and then all of a sudden he fucking takes off from the

578
00:34:14.751 --> 00:34:18.730
line in his job,
groceries and babies are flying out the back fucking window.

579
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:24.190
That's what makes it fucking cool.
And I just can't,
I can't get past that.
Eh,

580
00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:28.550
it's a wagon.
I mean it's,
it's a fucking waste.
Like that's it right there.
Okay.

581
00:34:28.551 --> 00:34:30.710
You got Yay.
You got no style.

582
00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.210
Anybody can go out and like a Porsche.

583
00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:39.040
Anybody can like a corvette.
Anybody can like a Ferrari there.

584
00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:40.780
There's no thought process.

585
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:42.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

586
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.570
<v 0>You know,
that's why I like watching shows like gas monkey garage</v>

587
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.333
<v 1>right</v>

588
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:53.010
<v 0>fast and allow whatever the fuck is called.
Gas Monkey garage.
Oh,</v>

589
00:34:53.011 --> 00:34:54.390
I love watching that show.

590
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:58.200
Now when they take a fucking car that's known to be fast,

591
00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:01.950
I like when they take a fucking,
you know,
two door fucking sedan.

592
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:03.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

593
00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:03.791
<v 0>Like dead time.</v>

594
00:35:03.791 --> 00:35:08.791
They bought a Casey's fucking a 55 Ford and sold it to mark Cuban.

595
00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:15.700
That fucking car was so god damn cool they did that and they didn't want a 1950s

596
00:35:15.701 --> 00:35:19.680
Oldsmobile.
Like I don't know.
To me that that's,

597
00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:22.773
<v 1>I dunno,</v>

598
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:25.410
<v 0>those are those other cars,
right?
The Ferrari's and all that.</v>

599
00:35:25.411 --> 00:35:28.380
That's like going on stage as a comedian and telling a Dick joke,

600
00:35:28.381 --> 00:35:32.290
it's a fucking layup.
You know,
people are going to laugh.
I know I don't,

601
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.850
I got a lot of German blood.
Me and what I love about Germans is,

602
00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:40.480
what's funny to me about them is they really bad about getting along with other

603
00:35:40.481 --> 00:35:40.841
people.

604
00:35:40.841 --> 00:35:44.230
But you give those motherfuckers a station wagon and somehow that thing will go

605
00:35:44.231 --> 00:35:49.060
zero to 60 in 3.6 seconds at dude,
it's a fucking race car.

606
00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:49.421
You know,

607
00:35:49.421 --> 00:35:52.570
station wagons usually had that seat in the back where people face the other
way.

608
00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.040
This car doesn't have that.

609
00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.280
That's how fast to try and get this thing to go because it's a weight issue.

610
00:35:57.281 --> 00:36:00.610
So they got that thing the fuck out of there.
And um,

611
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:03.550
that is the first time I ever drove a car.

612
00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:06.580
Both cars that I drove and they have a dual clutch.

613
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:10.390
And I never thought I would say this,
but it just eliminates,

614
00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.300
like back in the day,
if you've got a sports car and it was an automatic,

615
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:18.490
you would the biggest fucking pussy,
the whole car was ruined.

616
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:21.890
You know what I mean?
Like if you bought a corvette and it was an automatic yeah,

617
00:36:21.891 --> 00:36:25.150
you're just a Douche bag.
Like why would you do that?

618
00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:27.760
The stick shift is so much faster.

619
00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:32.920
You can slow down by downshifting as you're fucking dive in into the Goddamn

620
00:36:32.921 --> 00:36:37.360
turns,
right.
Scaring the shit out of your passengers.
Right.
But now,

621
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:42.170
I mean I,
I didn't even understand the whole concept of it until like a week ago.

622
00:36:42.171 --> 00:36:44.960
I started reading up on how that,
I was talking about like a week ago,

623
00:36:44.961 --> 00:36:48.080
that whole dual clutch system,
basically this is how

624
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:53.350
fucking psychotic in a good way.
These guys are,

625
00:36:53.351 --> 00:36:56.080
who designed these cars and I guess a dual clutch system has been around since

626
00:36:56.081 --> 00:36:57.790
the fucking early eighties I just heard about it,

627
00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:01.750
which is not surprising cause I'm a moron.
But basically,

628
00:37:01.751 --> 00:37:03.490
you know when you're driving a car,
right?

629
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:05.500
You're going down the street and you're,

630
00:37:05.501 --> 00:37:09.990
and you're hearing it going through the gears at Wham Bam,

631
00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.630
right?
That little pot,
you know,
so it was like a lot.

632
00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.730
When you're in your seat and exam,

633
00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:19.840
you come off the seat where you're backing him up to seed,
my aim,

634
00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:25.170
you're coming off the seat because the clutch is basically disengaging with the

635
00:37:26.291 --> 00:37:29.110
engine and fuel and the engine still working like a motherfucker.

636
00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.620
But for that split second,
when you push in the clutch and it's a neutral,

637
00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.410
you're the,
the engine's working for nothing right now.

638
00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:40.420
That little sliver of that little split second,
when you go to shift,

639
00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:43.450
you're losing that torque from the engine.

640
00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:47.560
So the dual clutch system eliminates you coming off.

641
00:37:47.561 --> 00:37:52.561
You see by it puts the odd gears on one side of the training and the even on the

642
00:37:52.661 --> 00:37:55.900
other,
and I don't know how to fuck it switches off the way it does,

643
00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:01.510
but I was driving that car and I'm listening and going through the gears and I

644
00:38:01.511 --> 00:38:04.720
never came off my seat and the guy says,

645
00:38:04.721 --> 00:38:06.850
you can use the paddle shifters if you want,

646
00:38:06.851 --> 00:38:09.640
but you'll never be able to shift faster than the dual clutch dude.

647
00:38:09.641 --> 00:38:14.410
You just step on the gas and it's like,
man,
just fucking going through the gears.

648
00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:17.323
It's fun.

649
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:22.730
It's so completely unnecessary to have when you're driving down the street,

650
00:38:24.861 --> 00:38:28.310
it's so fucking unnecessary to have when you just drive it around civilians that

651
00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:32.360
you gotta have one.
Um,
does that make any sense?

652
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:36.760
I am completely sold
on those cars and I'm a,

653
00:38:36.761 --> 00:38:40.450
I'm glad I went shopping around and all of that type of shit.

654
00:38:40.451 --> 00:38:42.790
So now I just got it.
I got to save up to get one,

655
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:47.860
which is why I'm touring all through Australia,
New Zealand,
India,

656
00:38:47.861 --> 00:38:50.670
Asia before.
Dude,
I am,
I,

657
00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.990
I'm so fucking psyched for that tour.

658
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.650
I am going to lay waste to that land down there.

659
00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:01.060
I am so chomping at the fucking bit too to fucking do stand up right now.

660
00:39:01.061 --> 00:39:05.670
And I got all these goddamn ideas that I want to work out.
Um,

661
00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.810
dude,
I got to,
I,
I can't,

662
00:39:07.811 --> 00:39:10.660
I don't know how to tell this story without giving away the joke that I'm doing,

663
00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:16.250
but I'm gonna tell you why Joe Rogan is the greatest fucking dude ever.
Um,

664
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:21.990
I got this bit that I want to do and it adds like a physicality thing.

665
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:27.720
Like possibly even like a prat fall and a lot of standup comics,
whatever,

666
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:30.430
look at it like,
oh,
the pret full,
let's fucking hacky or whatever.

667
00:39:30.431 --> 00:39:34.510
I'm just looking at it like,
wait a minute,
that's,
that's part of comedy,
man.

668
00:39:34.511 --> 00:39:36.010
Like you gotta learn how to do that shit.

669
00:39:36.011 --> 00:39:40.450
So I have this idea for a fucking joke that would possibly involve something

670
00:39:40.451 --> 00:39:43.690
like that.
I'm just kind of playing with the,
and Rogan's going like,
dude,

671
00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.730
what the comedy store?
And he's gone through it.
You get to,

672
00:39:45.731 --> 00:39:48.120
you could totally do that.
He goes,
come over to Mike's House.

673
00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:50.680
I'll show you how to do it.
I got the fucking,
I got,
you know,
he's,

674
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.780
he's got like an octagon in his goddamn garage,
dollar Mattson,
Shit.
He goes,

675
00:39:55.781 --> 00:39:59.980
I'll show you how to do it in this fucking maniac.
Loves comedy so much.

676
00:39:59.981 --> 00:40:01.120
She's such a good dude.

677
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:06.250
We're backstage at the comedy store and he's doing these fucking rolls from a

678
00:40:06.251 --> 00:40:10.740
standing position onto the fucking floor and I'm just die.

679
00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:15.310
I'm fucking laugh and go on this guy.
Like,
who the fuck else would do the

680
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:21.040
fucking four?
Might not even his own joke.
He showed me how to do,

681
00:40:21.041 --> 00:40:24.940
how he goes easy.
You could just fucking do it like this.
It looks like you fall,

682
00:40:24.941 --> 00:40:29.050
but you kind of rolling into it.
He did it so well.
It's like,
dude,

683
00:40:29.051 --> 00:40:32.620
you want to do the fucking joke?
But uh,
anyway,
so the,
for my next special,

684
00:40:32.621 --> 00:40:34.720
you see me flopping around on the fucking stage,

685
00:40:34.721 --> 00:40:39.721
know that it's because Joe Rogan took the time to show me how to do that

686
00:40:39.791 --> 00:40:43.490
backstage backstage at the comedy store.
And by the way,

687
00:40:43.491 --> 00:40:47.620
it Rogan is back at the comedy store,
which is the greatest thing ever.
Uh,
they,

688
00:40:47.621 --> 00:40:51.400
you know,
they had a little,
a little riff there and a right,
right.

689
00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:55.450
As I moved to La.
And I remember when I first lived in La in the late nineties,

690
00:40:55.451 --> 00:40:59.770
one of the highlights of going down to the comedy store,
uh,
was seeing Rogan,

691
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:01.930
you know,
back in the day.

692
00:41:01.931 --> 00:41:06.670
So I have last night I was down there and actually I was late so I didn't get to

693
00:41:06.671 --> 00:41:08.590
say what's up to him,
but I actually saw him on stage.

694
00:41:08.591 --> 00:41:12.630
That's the first time I saw him in the,
uh,
the Oh,

695
00:41:12.631 --> 00:41:16.730
are also called the original room,
um,

696
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.540
since the late nineties,

697
00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:24.580
when I think I made a couple of trips in the two thousands to la,

698
00:41:24.581 --> 00:41:29.290
but I just don't ever remember running into him.
So he was doing fear factor.

699
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.960
Um,
anyways.
What else else?
Yeah,

700
00:41:33.961 --> 00:41:37.560
so I whored myself out this week,
uh,
promoting my special,

701
00:41:37.561 --> 00:41:39.570
I did Conan O'brien this week and once again,

702
00:41:39.571 --> 00:41:43.350
I always have a good time on that show.
Thank you to Conan and uh,

703
00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:46.590
Andy and all those guys for a laughing.

704
00:41:46.591 --> 00:41:50.480
When I say something funny and helping me out when it bombs and,
um,

705
00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:54.780
I think that's a,
I think that's about all I got for this week.
Oh,
the Bruins.

706
00:41:54.781 --> 00:41:59.100
Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.
We had a rough fucking road trip.
That was a rough one,

707
00:41:59.101 --> 00:42:00.790
you know.
Um,

708
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:06.930
we lost a couple of close ones to the ducks and the kings and them just got

709
00:42:06.931 --> 00:42:10.920
fucking hammered by the San Jose sharks.

710
00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:15.030
I don't know what the fuck.
I mean,
I actually went back and watched it,
but I uh,

711
00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:20.460
it was two to nothing when I left to go do some spots and I came back and I just

712
00:42:20.461 --> 00:42:22.380
saw,
I was like seven to four.
We lost,

713
00:42:22.381 --> 00:42:26.880
we give up seven fucking goals and two periods.
But you know,
you always,

714
00:42:26.881 --> 00:42:30.300
you have one of those every year,
you have a regular season game.

715
00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:35.190
It just gets away from you.
Then,
uh,
we beat the coyotes a couple nights later,

716
00:42:35.191 --> 00:42:38.850
so we went one and three on the road trips.
So we'll come back.

717
00:42:38.851 --> 00:42:42.060
We got the Chicago Blackhawks.
I'll tell ya,
it doesn't get any easier.

718
00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.860
We've got the Black Hawks at home,

719
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:46.800
I think the wild or something like that coming up.

720
00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.540
That's another thing I'm looking forward to over the break.

721
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:54.450
I haven't skated since like September.
Um,
yeah,

722
00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:57.660
I gotta get back into all my fucking hobbies and all that shit.
So anyways,
let's,

723
00:42:57.661 --> 00:43:00.630
uh,
in the,
uh,

724
00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:05.500
like I got to read some questions here because I have another busy fucking day

725
00:43:05.501 --> 00:43:09.820
here.
All right.
Wife and labor,
a Billy Black and white face.

726
00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:14.170
My wife and I watched your new special on Netflix last night and then at 6:00 AM

727
00:43:14.171 --> 00:43:18.460
this morning,
her water broke coincidence.
Probably not.

728
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:23.500
She did not want to watch it because she was having contraction contractions and

729
00:43:23.501 --> 00:43:26.860
was in pain and I don't think she laughed once.

730
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:31.420
I cackled like a maniac while she glared at me for enjoying myself so much.

731
00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:35.830
I think the hour and 15 minutes of glaring caused her to go into labor two weeks

732
00:43:35.831 --> 00:43:39.670
early.
Is that a thing?
Thanks for the entertainment and go fuck yourself.

733
00:43:39.671 --> 00:43:44.500
Jesus Christ out.
Your wife's had pain and you're still sat there and watched it.

734
00:43:44.501 --> 00:43:48.750
Why didn't you fucking a
bring it back into the bedroom,

735
00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:51.690
give her a nice book and a whatever,
peanut butter,
banana sandwich,

736
00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.950
whatever the hell she's craving.
Um,
I dunno why.

737
00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:59.010
I hope you had a nice healthy baby boy or girl,
whatever he had.
And um,

738
00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.690
I hope your wife hates you,
would not make,
but um,

739
00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.670
for those of you haven't seen my,
my newest special,
yes we did.
We shot it in,
uh,

740
00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:09.990
with the latest cameras you can have when we shot it in black and white.

741
00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:14.280
I always wanted to do with special ed black and white because I just think it

742
00:44:14.281 --> 00:44:16.560
looks fucking cool as shit.
And uh,

743
00:44:16.561 --> 00:44:20.440
and also I planned to do a bunch of specials and uh,
you know,

744
00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:24.390
each one to have like its own kind of unique look,
you know,

745
00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:26.490
so just imagine I got it.
So,
you know,
some color wasn't a boom.

746
00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:27.660
I got this black and white one.

747
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:32.110
I shoot this other one this way or that way or whatever.
Um,
I don't know.

748
00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.380
I don't know.
I don't like HD,

749
00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:39.940
the level of HD TV right now.
It's so fucking clear.
It doesn't look real.

750
00:44:39.941 --> 00:44:43.150
It's like,
it looks like a tropical fish tank.

751
00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:46.990
Half of these shows you sitting there watching a car chase and you waste,

752
00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:51.610
you're like waiting for a clown fish to swim by the,
uh,
pass the screen.

753
00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.490
I don't know.
I'm not in it.
I'm not into it.
I'm an old man.
Look at me.

754
00:44:54.491 --> 00:44:57.880
I'm releasing fucking vinyl records and black and white specials.

755
00:44:57.881 --> 00:44:58.840
I am regressing.

756
00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:00.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

757
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.390
<v 0>All right.
Last weeks,
24 year old version version,</v>

758
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:09.400
Virgin Bill.
I wanted to weigh in on the 24 year old virgin question.

759
00:45:09.401 --> 00:45:13.210
What the female perspective.
Oh,
but I love when the women writing.

760
00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:18.610
I always get it from the fellas.
This one's from a lady.
She said,

761
00:45:18.611 --> 00:45:22.840
this kid is potentially sitting on a golden ticket if he plays it right.

762
00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:27.250
There are girls that get really turned on by the idea of fucking a virgin,

763
00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:30.010
myself included.
Is that true?

764
00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:31.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

765
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:34.070
<v 0>Uh,
she said,
myself included when I was still in the game.</v>

766
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:37.990
It's sweet when you don't know what you're doing.
Sina,

767
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.600
I never would have known that because as a guy you feel like there's that

768
00:45:41.601 --> 00:45:44.750
pressure that you're supposed to lead and you're supposed to know what the fuck

769
00:45:44.751 --> 00:45:49.070
you doing from the get go.
Um,
so anyways,

770
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:52.850
she goes on to say and sweet.

771
00:45:52.851 --> 00:45:55.730
We'll get you laid.
Oh,

772
00:45:55.731 --> 00:45:57.290
it's sweet when you don't know what you're doing and sweet,

773
00:45:57.291 --> 00:46:00.920
we'll get you laid a will knock your fucking brains out because we take,

774
00:46:00.921 --> 00:46:04.160
because we get to take charge and we want to give you a great time.

775
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:07.940
I've been with guys who think they know what they are doing and it was far worse

776
00:46:07.941 --> 00:46:10.700
than fucking a virgin.
A few words of advice.

777
00:46:10.701 --> 00:46:13.940
Don't act all greasy and pretend you know what's going on.

778
00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:20.230
What is greasy mean?
Cool.
Is this for the Virgin?
Yeah.
Just yes.

779
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:22.220
Just saying fucking throw your cards on the table.

780
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:25.900
Stand there with the fucking rock card deck gone.

781
00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:35.760
What's happening?
Um,
anyways,
she said that's not a fucking turn on.

782
00:46:35.761 --> 00:46:36.690
When you act all greasy,

783
00:46:36.691 --> 00:46:39.870
pretend what you're doing and it will reflect poorly on your abilities.

784
00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:44.010
Also don't get to fucking wasted.
Yeah.
A little liquid.

785
00:46:44.011 --> 00:46:45.210
Courage isn't a bad thing,

786
00:46:45.211 --> 00:46:47.820
but too much booze and your system will make you sloppy.

787
00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:50.820
And if you pick a decent enough girl for your first fuck,

788
00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:54.750
she might tell her girlfriends,
but your buddies,
we'll never know.

789
00:46:55.820 --> 00:47:00.030
Um,
p s bill got to see you in Ottawa and you fucking killed it.
Thanks.

790
00:47:00.031 --> 00:47:04.770
And Go fuck yourself.
Jesus Christ.
It's fucking right there.

791
00:47:04.771 --> 00:47:08.360
That's the fucking blunt force trauma.
Truth of it all.
Um,

792
00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:10.260
I appreciate you being so God damn honest.

793
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:11.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

794
00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:15.150
<v 0>You know,
is that the way women talk when we're not around?</v>

795
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:20.130
You guys sounded like truckers to lodge mage.
All right.

796
00:47:20.131 --> 00:47:23.940
Adoption and I'm not shitting on you either cause I know I sound like a trucker.

797
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.230
I don't sound like a trucker.

798
00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:28.440
While I do is just add the southern accent because everybody knows every truck

799
00:47:28.441 --> 00:47:31.870
is from down south.
Right?
Speaking it down south,
everybody.
Um,

800
00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:35.910
I am going to be doing another fucking tour of the south,
the dirty south,

801
00:47:35.911 --> 00:47:38.800
and we're going to get an extra dirty,
this town.
I'm telling you right now,

802
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:41.890
I'm putting it together.
All right.

803
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:45.550
We're not going to be doing the main fucking ones that I've done in the past and

804
00:47:45.551 --> 00:47:49.420
Nashville.
Atlanta.
Fuck that.
Fuck that.

805
00:47:49.421 --> 00:47:53.830
All fucking day.
All right,
we're going to Talladega.

806
00:47:53.831 --> 00:47:58.060
We're going to mobile,
Alabama.
We're going to go into Mississippi.

807
00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.150
I want to,
I want to go into,
I want to,
I'm going to Homina.

808
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:06.040
Homina I want to go to like fucking some of these off the beaten fucking path.

809
00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:11.610
Southern ones.
Do A,
do a bus tour.
Um,
I'm gonna,

810
00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:15.610
I'm putting the fucking team back together again.
Just like the blues brothers.

811
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.640
All right.
That's something else in 2015 that's going to happen.

812
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:24.370
We'll get in the fucking bus back.
We'll get Steve the bus driver.
All right.

813
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.840
Versie law head and the coach and that's it.

814
00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:31.450
It's gonna happen again.
Um,

815
00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:34.150
I'm actually right after I'm done with this fucking podcast.

816
00:48:34.151 --> 00:48:37.730
I'm calling my agent.
I'm going to pick a God damn time.
We're going to,

817
00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:42.730
we're going to put it together.
I love the fucking self.
I love it.
All right.

818
00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:47.650
Adoption.
Serber just finished a new special.
Amazing.

819
00:48:47.651 --> 00:48:49.090
As always.
Thank you very much.

820
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:53.740
I very much liked your bit about adoption and as someone who grew up in a
family,

821
00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:56.890
oh,
as someone who grew up in a family through adoption,

822
00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:01.210
it's my honest opinion that it's the best and most socially responsible things

823
00:49:01.211 --> 00:49:04.810
someone can do.
My sister,
brother and myself were adopted by folks.

824
00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:09.840
My folks after my dad made the choice back when he was a kid in the 70s and met

825
00:49:10.811 --> 00:49:15.640
an adopted schoolmate who had been through some shit in Korea and express his

826
00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:18.760
true gratitude for being able to live a completely new life.

827
00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:22.630
My mom has made it clear that they could have had their own and it wasn't a

828
00:49:22.631 --> 00:49:26.740
question of possibility,
pain or timing.
Uh,

829
00:49:26.741 --> 00:49:28.990
my dad just always felt the need to do it.

830
00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.980
I don't know where I'd be without people like my parents and adoption should

831
00:49:32.981 --> 00:49:37.060
really be how our new generation in privileged countries like our own acquire

832
00:49:37.061 --> 00:49:37.894
that children.

833
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:41.740
Though I understand acquiring children's sounds like the to do list for an

834
00:49:41.741 --> 00:49:45.580
African dictator.
Either way.
Thanks for the thousands of last laughs.

835
00:49:45.581 --> 00:49:48.550
I hope you and Nia find tremendous joy in whatever you decide to do.

836
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:51.460
Any kid would be fortunate for you guys to have?
Oh,

837
00:49:51.461 --> 00:49:54.310
any kid would be fortunate to have you guys as a mom or a dad.
Ah,

838
00:49:54.311 --> 00:49:57.580
what a fucking great guy.
Um,

839
00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:01.840
I gotta be honest with you to do with the fucking world population problem the

840
00:50:01.841 --> 00:50:06.550
way it is.
You know what I mean?
And then all the kids out there that,

841
00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:10.990
uh,
for whatever reason,
you know,

842
00:50:10.991 --> 00:50:13.970
I can't imagine over in,
uh,
Iraq,

843
00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:17.620
how many kids don't have fucking mom's or dad's at this point,

844
00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:23.390
through that fucking shit show over the last 10 years and he's time of war just,

845
00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:28.420
just fucking pulls everybody apart.
Um,
and over here,

846
00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:30.940
you know,
well,
I don't know if they allow,

847
00:50:30.941 --> 00:50:35.780
do they allow husbands and wives in the United States military?

848
00:50:35.781 --> 00:50:39.010
You both go over there?
I wouldn't think so.

849
00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:43.710
They seem to not do that after that.
I think after they had that one,
uh,

850
00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:45.391
that shipped,

851
00:50:45.391 --> 00:50:49.020
it went down a World War II when there was like five brothers from the same

852
00:50:49.021 --> 00:50:52.980
family.
We're all on the same ship and the thing got torpedoed.

853
00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:57.330
And some poor parents lost all five of their kids.
Man fucking brutal.

854
00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:02.100
I think a,
the u s military does try to avoid that.
So,

855
00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:02.993
um,

856
00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:04.240
<v 3>okay.</v>

857
00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:07.390
<v 0>No,
I,
I wouldn't have a problem with that.
I should probably do it.</v>

858
00:51:07.391 --> 00:51:10.690
I'm fucking 46 right then I talk about that in my act.

859
00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:14.550
I need a headstand.
He's just fucking get,
we get 10 year old,

860
00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:20.530
so I'll still be alive when he graduates college.
Um,
no,

861
00:51:20.531 --> 00:51:23.020
I don't think there's anything wrong with it.
I think it's a great thing to do.

862
00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:27.970
And also,
you know,
not only is it great for the kid,

863
00:51:27.971 --> 00:51:31.000
it is great for,
I hate using the word society,

864
00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:36.060
mankind in general because if you don't have any sort of parental guidance and

865
00:51:36.221 --> 00:51:40.110
you're growing up in some sort of foster home,
you know,
it's just like,

866
00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.610
you're just going to grow up,
you know,

867
00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.500
with a bunch of other fucked up kids and you just end up doing what they're

868
00:51:44.501 --> 00:51:47.590
doing.
Uh,
when the person could actually,

869
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:53.290
you know,
if you have parental guidance,
you go to school,
you get a good job,

870
00:51:53.291 --> 00:51:57.730
you meet him,
you know,
give me a nice lady or whatever.

871
00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.880
You get fucking married or what do you chill?

872
00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:02.700
You're all fucking angry from your child and all that.

873
00:52:02.701 --> 00:52:06.210
God knows what you go out and go do,
right?
Um,
yes.
You know what?

874
00:52:06.211 --> 00:52:09.240
You reconvince me.
Alright?
Underrated.

875
00:52:09.241 --> 00:52:14.241
Doing dishes at spouse's family at spouse's family event is underrated.

876
00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:15.391
All right?

877
00:52:15.391 --> 00:52:18.660
I was at my sister in law's graduation party and decided to help clean up by

878
00:52:18.661 --> 00:52:19.500
doing the dishes.

879
00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:24.630
I was able to skip out on boring in law conversations while picking up some

880
00:52:24.631 --> 00:52:27.330
credit by offering to do the dishes on top of it all,

881
00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:31.410
I was able to catch the Patriots packers game on the kitchen TV while everyone

882
00:52:31.411 --> 00:52:35.640
else was having to having to make small talk.
Dude,
that's fucking genius.

883
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.820
<v 3>Okay.</v>

884
00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:39.200
<v 0>I hate small talk.</v>

885
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:42.620
I can't stand going to those fucking parties do and I'm going to steal that.

886
00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:44.870
Whoever,
man or woman,

887
00:52:44.871 --> 00:52:48.260
whoever wrote this sin Hermaphrodite I don't know who the fuck you walk.

888
00:52:48.261 --> 00:52:51.320
God bless you.
I got a nice crowd.
Uh,

889
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:55.340
I got a nice crowd going in the kitchen and most of the men at the event wanted

890
00:52:55.341 --> 00:52:57.590
to see the game.
We are rooting for the Patriots to win.

891
00:52:57.591 --> 00:53:00.290
So the lines would have the NFC north.

892
00:53:00.291 --> 00:53:04.400
Next time you get a chance to volunteer to do some easy cleanup,

893
00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:08.660
nonstop.
Thanks.
And an easy out from boring conversations.
Wow,
man.

894
00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.810
I got to tell you,
that might be the best one in a while.

895
00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:14.310
<v 3>Okay.</v>

896
00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:17.730
<v 0>That's,
that's god damn genius.
Oh,</v>

897
00:53:17.731 --> 00:53:20.880
musical mud dancing doc.
Um,

898
00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:25.080
so when he wears,
what do we got here man?
Look at this 53 fucking minutes.

899
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:28.520
53 minutes in and I'm out of shit to talk about.
I'm,

900
00:53:28.521 --> 00:53:31.920
I'm a little talked out people I have,
I apologize,
you know,
whoring myself out,

901
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:37.680
hyping this fucking special and uh,
doing the radio,
the radio,
God Damn Torah.

902
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:39.340
Let's,
you know,
this is what I'm going to do.

903
00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:43.590
How many just going to select some right now from my email account.

906
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:47.790

Isn't this exciting?</v>

908
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:55.000
I have no idea what these questions are.
Gonna be

909
00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:56.460
<v 4>B.</v>

910
00:53:57.490 --> 00:53:58.970
<v 0>MMM</v>

911
00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:01.260
<v 3>hmm.</v>

912
00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:05.190
<v 0>Advice.
Been out of the game.
It's changed.
All right.
What do we see?
Oh my God,</v>

913
00:54:05.191 --> 00:54:09.940
this fucking emails long.
Oh fuck.
All right.
Hey Billy,

914
00:54:09.941 --> 00:54:10.421
bad ass.

915
00:54:10.421 --> 00:54:14.830
I got a situation here and I can't make heads of tails of where I'm at with this

916
00:54:14.831 --> 00:54:15.664
girl.

917
00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:20.730
A modern day Casanova such as yourself should be able to figure out how to read

918
00:54:20.741 --> 00:54:23.470
this girl.
Read this girl and it

919
00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:29.000
vies me as the next as of the next step to take a,
if there is one.

920
00:54:29.001 --> 00:54:33.110
So here's my problem.
Your problem is fucking spelling and punctuation so far,

921
00:54:33.111 --> 00:54:34.760
my friend.
So here's my problem.

922
00:54:34.761 --> 00:54:39.080
I'm 24 years old and was in a relationship with a girl for five years from the

923
00:54:39.081 --> 00:54:41.360
ages of 14 to 19 when an ended,

924
00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:46.010
it was drawn out and she strung me along until she was comfortable enough with

925
00:54:46.011 --> 00:54:50.400
their next guy to cut it off for good.
Yeah,
that's what you're doing.

926
00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:54.410
You're young.
I wouldn't take it personal.
She's only fucking 19.

927
00:54:54.411 --> 00:54:56.330
She doesn't know how to get out of a relationship.
Do you,
you know,

928
00:54:56.570 --> 00:55:01.490
you guys started dating at 14.
Um,
anyways,
well she goes,

929
00:55:01.491 --> 00:55:06.491
well I live in a small town and the guy she went to was a little sissy girl Jean

930
00:55:06.601 --> 00:55:08.440
where and Piss in Ah,

931
00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:13.180
<v 4>z.
Z.
Z.
Okay.</v>

932
00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:17.140
<v 0>Ah,
Jesus Christ to Oh right.
I don't know.
I'm not gonna read the dude.</v>

933
00:55:17.141 --> 00:55:19.960
You sound like a fucking bully.
I know,
right?
You know what?
You're mad at him.

934
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.340
All right.
I'm going to give he Jesus Christ,
Dude.

935
00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:25.030
<v 3>Okay.</v>

936
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:28.270
<v 0>Thank God I pulled up on that one.
I would add to make an apology.
Um,</v>

937
00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:29.480
<v 3>okay.</v>

938
00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:32.390
<v 0>They can't take an ass whooping without calling the cops.</v>

939
00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:33.350
<v 3>Okay?</v>

940
00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:37.460
<v 0>Jesus Christ.
I to give her advice.
Let's just read this to hear of fucked up.</v>

941
00:55:37.461 --> 00:55:39.410
This guy is,
by the way,

942
00:55:39.411 --> 00:55:44.411
big reason why I country is our country.

943
00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:48.460
The reason why I country is going to hell in a handbasket.

944
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:51.590
It's cause the guys like this I get cause they can't take an ass kicking without

945
00:55:51.591 --> 00:55:54.380
calling the cops.
All right?
This guy's old school.
Uh,

946
00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:58.970
nobody is getting their ass beat anymore because of cop calling.
Ah,

947
00:55:58.971 --> 00:55:59.804
Jesus,

948
00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:07.710
which is salt is practically a prison sentence right away.
I digress dude.

949
00:56:07.711 --> 00:56:12.420
You're a fucking mouth breathing moron.
Good Lord.

950
00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:17.380
I'm actually ha,
um,
happy that she's fucking away from you.

951
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:23.980
See,
this is why we tried to screen these.
Goddamn.
Thanks.
Okay.
All right.
Where are

952
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.760
<v 3>we?
Where are we?
Come on.
Somebody asked for if</v>

953
00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:33.430
<v 0>men's room studio tour,
it's Cetera.
All right,</v>

954
00:56:33.431 --> 00:56:35.130
let's see what this one is.
High Bill.

955
00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:39.790
Let's hope this one doesn't have a homophobic shit all over it.
All right.

956
00:56:39.810 --> 00:56:42.310
Hi Belt.
I heard your podcast yesterday.

957
00:56:42.311 --> 00:56:46.900
I was dying laughing when you talked about the men's rooms and all the smelly

958
00:56:46.901 --> 00:56:48.310
shenanigans that happen in there.

959
00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:51.400
I'm a woman who's never been in a men's public restroom,

960
00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:54.100
so that was a shockingly funny revelation.

961
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:58.720
My husband never tells me it's discussing in there.
Perhaps he,
he's used to it.

962
00:56:59.190 --> 00:57:02.140
Oh,
I mean it's a public restroom.
I,
by the way,

963
00:57:02.141 --> 00:57:06.040
I've been in funny of ladies rooms.
Um,

964
00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:09.160
I shouldn't say plenty.
I don't mean to say it that way.

965
00:57:09.161 --> 00:57:12.260
I've been in there cause I used to be a busboy at a restaurant in,

966
00:57:12.261 --> 00:57:12.911
in the morning.

967
00:57:12.911 --> 00:57:17.911
I came in and I had to clean up both bathrooms and I was not surprised at how

968
00:57:20.861 --> 00:57:23.680
filthy the men's room was.
But the fucking ladies room,

969
00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:29.290
first of all,
this fucking toilet paper all over the place.

970
00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:30.690
I don't know what's going on in the,

971
00:57:30.691 --> 00:57:33.460
I think because they have to sit down to pee.
They just build the nest.

972
00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:37.660
I have no idea.
And I'll spare you the fucking details.
All right.

973
00:57:37.690 --> 00:57:39.400
But it looks like,
you know,

974
00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.290
<v 3>okay,</v>

975
00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:46.100
<v 0>just imagine a ticker tape parade
combined with bodily fluids.</v>

976
00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:49.910
That's disgusting.
I'm sorry,
but that's what it looked like.
He goes,

977
00:57:49.911 --> 00:57:52.850
on the other hand,
the woman's restrooms are quite the opposite.

978
00:57:52.851 --> 00:57:54.710
God forbid you make a sound in there.

979
00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:59.360
It's like an unspoken rule that women can't fart loudly installs.

980
00:57:59.361 --> 00:58:03.830
If you asked me,
this is so unfair that we ladies have to hold it in.

981
00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:06.770
Well you guys are doing it to yourself.
That's the lady's room.

982
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:10.690
Please don't blame the guys for that one.
Well,
you know,

983
00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:14.930
in society it's not acceptable for us to Fart in public.

984
00:58:14.931 --> 00:58:18.230
If a guy does it.
It's funny.
Oh,
fucking grow a Dick.

985
00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:19.400
<v 3>Okay.</v>

986
00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:23.930
<v 0>Stop playing the goddamn victim.
All right,
let one rip and have you dressed.</v>

987
00:58:23.931 --> 00:58:27.020
Fly up like Marilyn Monroe.
I don't give a fuck.
Anyways,

988
00:58:27.021 --> 00:58:31.550
I had the privilege to use the woman's restroom and south in the South Korea

989
00:58:31.551 --> 00:58:36.020
airport and each Saul had a device that lets you play classical music or nature

990
00:58:36.021 --> 00:58:38.870
sounds to mass the prostate area.
Trumpet blasting.

991
00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:41.360
That's about to shoot out of my dainty,

992
00:58:41.361 --> 00:58:45.740
but it was the best bathroom trip of my life.
Any who,

993
00:58:45.741 --> 00:58:50.741
I don't know if you got my email months before my offer still stands.

994
00:58:50.871 --> 00:58:54.140
You're welcome.
Oh,
to stop by our animation studio of Jesus Christ.

995
00:58:54.141 --> 00:58:57.560
I was getting nervous,
sir.
Um,

996
00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:04.810
oh.
All right.
All right.
Okay,
cool.
All right,
why don't we go here?

997
00:59:04.811 --> 00:59:09.740
Where do we go?
Um,
do I dare to read?

998
00:59:09.741 --> 00:59:12.830
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Feedback.
I got one more minute to do here.

999
00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:17.910
Loved every minute of it man.
Like the black and white.
Absolutely.
Awesome.

1000
00:59:17.911 --> 00:59:20.340
Special.
Keep coming.
Police.
I'll,
that's awesome.
That's awesome.

1001
00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:24.240
I can't tell you guys how sack dam that you guys liked this,
this special.
Um,

1002
00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:28.710
and for those of you who are wondering why we shot it the way we do is because I

1003
00:59:28.711 --> 00:59:33.270
love standup comedy and I just feel like it should be shot like a movie.

1004
00:59:33.930 --> 00:59:34.763
You know what I mean?

1005
00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:40.820
Like standup comedy has this weird sort of thing where it has this a ton of

1006
00:59:40.821 --> 00:59:43.670
respect where people like,
dude,
I don't know how you get up there.

1007
00:59:43.671 --> 00:59:45.230
I could never do that.
Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1008
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:48.560
Yet it's also looked at like you're the guy with the lampshade on your head.

1009
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:51.860
And I'll never forget when I did a half hour for comedy central,

1010
00:59:51.861 --> 00:59:55.330
I know I've told this story before and they did the promos for it and they

1011
00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:59.080
basically shot you sitting on a stool sorta making weird faces at the camera.

1012
00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.570
At least that's what they were asking you to do,
asking you to do.
And uh,

1013
01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:07.550
they just played this trumpet,
like the Promo.
It's like,
you know,
Bill Burrs,

1014
01:00:07.551 --> 01:00:08.450
half hour special.

1015
01:00:08.451 --> 01:00:11.540
And they just had me sitting there like shrugging my shoulders,
like,
Hey,

1016
01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:15.980
this is my half hour special and this trumpet was playing in the background,
went

1017
01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:20.320
<v 5>bad,
bad,
bad,
bad</v>

1018
01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:25.900
<v 0>with a gun.
I remember watching it on who's sitting at home.</v>

1019
01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:28.060
This is my first half hour special.

1020
01:00:28.061 --> 01:00:31.660
I was all excited and that fucking muted trumpet came.

1021
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:33.490
It sounded like it was heckling me.

1022
01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:34.810
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1023
01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:37.840
<v 0>Like that's the soundtrack to what the fuck I just did.</v>

1024
01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.000
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1025
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.160
<v 0>You know what I mean?
I just,
I don't know.
I don't fucking know.</v>

1026
01:00:44.161 --> 01:00:47.640
But that's the greatest thing about this age of specialist is that Comedians

1027
01:00:47.641 --> 01:00:52.050
have so much control that you can actually shoot the fucking thing the way you

1028
01:00:52.051 --> 01:00:55.590
want to.
Um,
which we did.

1029
01:00:56.430 --> 01:01:00.300
And um,
that is all,
that is the podcast for this week.
Everybody.

1030
01:01:00.301 --> 01:01:02.300
I know I only did an hour this week.
I,
uh,

1031
01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:06.480
I just let me get through this next fucking acting Gig and then,
uh,
I'll be back.

1032
01:01:06.481 --> 01:01:10.980
Slap on my fucking gums again next week.
Uh,
come back a little stronger.

1033
01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.700
All right,
that's it.
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.
Oh,

1034
01:01:14.701 --> 01:01:17.830
I didn't even bring it up to patriots,
beat the fucking chair.

1035
01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.660
Um,
look to be a great game.

1036
01:01:21.661 --> 01:01:25.050
I was actually punching up this fucking script so I've yet to watch the game.

1037
01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:27.760
And um,
I did see that play that,
you know,

1038
01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:32.580
we intercepted it and brought it back and there was that great hit and you know,

1039
01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.210
those guys,

1040
01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:36.750
they got up just because somebody gets fucking laid out now it doesn't mean it

1041
01:01:36.751 --> 01:01:41.070
was like helmet to helmet.
That was like a great hit.
Um,
but I actually,
I do like,

1042
01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:44.220
you know,
as much as everybody's saying that the NFL,
oh it's,
you know,

1043
01:01:44.221 --> 01:01:45.660
the turning into this pussy league,

1044
01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:50.070
I liked that there isn't helmet to helmet hits.
I liked it.

1045
01:01:50.071 --> 01:01:52.770
They're trying to get that out of the game.
Cause I gotta be honest with you,

1046
01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:53.101
you know,

1047
01:01:53.101 --> 01:01:56.820
if you're younger I can see why you don't like it because you haven't seen any

1048
01:01:56.821 --> 01:01:59.820
of the guys that you liked when you were a kid.
Be 50,

1049
01:01:59.821 --> 01:02:04.650
60 years old and you know,
dealing with the effects of it.
Like,

1050
01:02:04.651 --> 01:02:05.650
you know,
the latest one,

1051
01:02:05.651 --> 01:02:09.090
the latest ones that shocked me was Tony doors set the great Tony Doors,

1052
01:02:09.091 --> 01:02:12.030
sat watching him struggle with like,
you know,

1053
01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.130
anger issues and all that type of thing due to the,

1054
01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:18.240
the hits he took in his career.
Uh,

1055
01:02:18.270 --> 01:02:20.670
I like that they having them lead with the shoulder and even then,

1056
01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:22.740
I mean you still,
your head can snap back.
It's,

1057
01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.540
it's always going to be a violent game.

1058
01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:28.530
But I think it's great that they are getting it out of there cause it's still a

1059
01:02:28.531 --> 01:02:29.430
fucking awesome game.

1060
01:02:29.431 --> 01:02:34.050
I don't think that guys have to be like suffering the way these players are

1061
01:02:34.051 --> 01:02:38.130
suffering for it to still be a great game.
So I,
I don't have a problem with it.

1062
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.960
Having said all that,
that I,

1063
01:02:39.961 --> 01:02:44.190
that was a bullshit call that was a fucking hell of a play in a touchdown.

1064
01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:45.023
And uh,

1065
01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:51.390
I was nervous about that game cause I respect the chargers and fucking Philip

1066
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:56.250
Rivers.
Um,
so anyways,
I don't know what to tell you.

1067
01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.580
A patriots attended three tied with the Broncos.
Thank God we beat them.

1068
01:02:59.581 --> 01:03:03.360
So we are a provider.
We,
when we,

1069
01:03:03.361 --> 01:03:05.850
when the rest of the way out or the Broncos lose one,

1070
01:03:05.851 --> 01:03:10.460
we will have home field advantage once again.
And uh,

1071
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:12.270
we're looking good but I don't know man.

1072
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:16.230
I still think the Broncos would be tough to beat them twice to be tough to beat

1073
01:03:16.231 --> 01:03:20.520
the colts twice.
Be Tough to beat the charges twice.
It just is.

1074
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:24.270
I don't by any means think that it will be,
you know,
all of these paths.

1075
01:03:24.271 --> 01:03:26.340
Fans like dough,
we're going to the ball.
Don't,

1076
01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:29.040
I don't by any means think it would be a cake walk,

1077
01:03:29.041 --> 01:03:31.440
but a obviously home field advantage will be a huge thing.

1078
01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:34.770
So I just figured I'd end the podcast by saying a bunch of obvious shit.

1079
01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:36.780
I hope you enjoyed this week's podcast.

1080
01:03:36.781 --> 01:03:39.930
Thanks once again to everybody's watching my special and if you haven't watched

1081

it really helps me because,

1082
01:03:44.671 --> 01:03:49.270

Netflix is a ratings thing just like any other network.

1083
01:03:49.271 --> 01:03:51.120
So if you've already seen it,
thank you so much.
