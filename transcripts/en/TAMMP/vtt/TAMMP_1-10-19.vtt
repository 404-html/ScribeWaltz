9
00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:32.800
I'll just sit there and I'll try and move this cause I don't have the equipment

10
00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:37.780
that I need.
Um,
Paul.
Yeah.
Um,
since we last spoke.
Yeah.

11
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.120
Well it's been a long time since you've been on the podcast,

12
00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:44.260
but this week we've been to Germany,
Astonia,

13
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.500
Latvia,
Hungary in Poland.

14
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.560
<v 2>Yeah.
And uh,
it's been a great time.</v>

15
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.740
<v 0>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.750
<v 1>Hands Down Budapest,
hands down,
food pass,
hands down.
Buda,
Budapest.</v>

17
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.180
Last night Budapest was,
Budapest was,
they will all great.

18
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:03.180
But Budapest was so good last night I was on stage.

19
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.070
<v 2>Okay.</v>

20
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.310
<v 1>And I,
and I had that thought in my head like,
dude,
I think I tape a special here.</v>

21
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.210
<v 2>That was,
that felt like a hot American crowd.
Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:14.460
It didn't matter where you like,
it didn't matter.
We were in Hungary,

23
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:19.020
they were ready.
It was great.
Lottery trio was the best hackles.
Lot fee.

24
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.500
I enjoyed Lafayette,
the one,
the one,
uh,
you know,

25
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:24.660
there was a couple of times in life for you.
You felt alone up there.

26
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:29.430
But due to Astonia well,
10 minutes before I go on stage and granted I'm going,

27
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:33.330
obviously I'm going cold.
The only thing I got is Kenny going,
we have a space.

28
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:37.050
You're really gonna love them right column.
So to Kenny,
shout out to him,

29
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:38.620
he brings me up and uh,

30
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.130
<v 1>10 minutes before I go up,
the guy goes,
yeah,</v>

31
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.290
standups only been here for eight years.
It got introduced in 2010.

32
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.620
And I was like,
that's a little unnerving to hear before you go out there.

33
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:52.370
But like,
yeah,
they were dressed up really nice to theater was beautiful.
Yeah.

34
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.820
And a,
you go into something and it was just,
it's like you said,
man,

35
00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:58.190
those Baltic states,
it was fucking in a little bit,

36
00:01:58.191 --> 00:02:00.680
this is a little bit something like deputy,
they're very,

37
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:03.890
very fucking smart and logical.

38
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.880
Astonia was like the best look and crowd,
they would like dress so nicely.

39
00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:10.370
I felt like a,
I felt like out of place.

40
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:12.590
It's theater was too nice for what we were saying.

41
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.500
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,
but Munich,
it was also like Budapest by little</v>

42
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.680
<v 1>Munich and in Budapest where uh,</v>

43
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.070
we're for fucking and Munich goes with three 30 show when they were a hot crowd.

44
00:02:24.071 --> 00:02:26.870
But all of them have been a great,

45
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.100
but like those were the two cities that you didn't have to even think that you

46
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.820
were over somewhere.
But like,
so anyways,

47
00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:35.930
I'd been on the road with birthday now for like a week and I'm a moody son of a

48
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:39.520
bitch,
so I know I'm driving them nuts.
But uh,

49
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.340
you know it's funny is dude,
you're way of talking like I was just joking.

50
00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:47.420
Like what did you just say?
Like volume it up.
Volume up.
Yeah.

51
00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:49.740
You said volume it up.
Like I was trying to,
trying to figure out,

52
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:53.430
cause the recording seemed like you just have your own way of speaking and I

53
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:56.320
have to try to figure out what the fuck you talking about.
I'm like,
this,

54
00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:59.680
this is coming to,
it's too quiet in a corner.
You're just going like,
well,

55
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:02.950
you know,
just,
just volume it up.
Well,
like the volume it,
you,

56
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:07.510
me turn up the volume.
Uh Oh no,
no,
you're just a,
Oh,
they did it.

57
00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:10.360
Their bread before he came in.
You did they,
I mean,
just the,
what'd you say?

58
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:14.050
Wipe it down with Windex.
Windex that down.
Imagine if they want.
Yeah.

59
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.490
<v 2>Well,
you know,
the thing is to me and my,
my mother,
I got this from my mother.</v>

60
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.320
My mother always says,
um,

61
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.270
<v 1>like turn the lights.
Uh,
like we don't say turn the lights on and off.</v>

62
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.320
We say a cut the lights.
No,
not cut the lights.
What is it?
Uh,

63
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.710
oh fuck.
I forgot.
I have another thing in my wife goes,
I'd never heard that.

64
00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:34.890
Turned the lights up and I'll turn the lights off.

65
00:03:34.891 --> 00:03:37.280
You don't even know this language.
It's so crazy.

66
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.970
You don't even know what you saying.
Yeah.

67
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.990
I don't say turn the lights the way that other people do do funny shit today.

68
00:03:42.991 --> 00:03:45.660
So we're,
we're leaving in Budapest.
Oh,
this is great.

69
00:03:45.661 --> 00:03:48.210
And we've been taking these small propeller planes and shit,

70
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.180
cause you know they're short little flights here and uh,

71
00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:51.961
so it's one of those deals,

72
00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:55.620
you go to the gate and then you get on a bus and then he'd take the bus out to

73
00:03:55.621 --> 00:03:58.440
the propeller plane and then,
you know what I like about them?

74
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.290
They don't give a fuck if your bag doesn't fit.
They're like,

75
00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:01.560
I just shove it under the seats.

76
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.070
They get on the seat next to you that it's not like this fucking post nine 11.

77
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.260
You know,
why are you being hostile?

78
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.930
Get your bag off the fucking plane the way they are in the states.

79
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.190
So I get on the thing,
the bus and for,

80
00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:17.360
as he got on the bus first and I said,
hey.
And he had a weird looking face.

81
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.930
What's up?
He said,
dude,
you just missed it.

82
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.530
This guy just asked me to sit next to him.
Like some total like gay shit.

83
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.480
Like he like pat the seat next to him.

84
00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:29.340
I saw Paul and he the pad on the seat or whatever.
Right.
So like I'm like,

85
00:04:29.341 --> 00:04:31.860
really?
I go,
well maybe it's like a European thing or whatever.

86
00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:34.690
But I did think it was weird cause the bus was so big and there were the faulty

87
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.040
seat.
It was all these seats.
Yeah.
So then later,

88
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.450
first he's looking at the guy and he's laughing at him,
going through,

89
00:04:41.451 --> 00:04:42.630
look at his little hat.

90
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.750
His hat doesn't fit his head and I'm just looking over it.

91
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.480
And I knew it wasn't Jewish.
I knew it was something religious.

92
00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:51.170
It turned out was like a Muslim.
It was definitely bigger than a Yamaka.
Yeah,

93
00:04:51.171 --> 00:04:53.790
it's bigger than younger.
So it was like,
it was the Muslim that right.

94
00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:54.840
And then we finally realized,

95
00:04:54.841 --> 00:04:58.620
I'm looking at the guy and he looks just like [inaudible] and I'm going,

96
00:04:58.621 --> 00:05:02.490
wait a minute,
this guy's probably Muslim.
Thought you were Muslim.

97
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.040
He's in fucking Budapest and he wanted to hang with you.

98
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.450
And then he ends up and then with funny he's,
he's,
he was freaking you out.

99
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.480
And then in your seat was like 10 [inaudible] and Kenny goes,
watch,

100
00:05:12.481 --> 00:05:17.100
he'll probably have 10 a and then the fucking guy gets on,
he's got 10,

101
00:05:17.101 --> 00:05:19.830
eight and then he goes out to you,
cause you're fine.
Are you Arabic?

102
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.150
<v 2>But the ones,
so bill was right,</v>

103
00:05:23.151 --> 00:05:26.630
but the one thing you left out in the story is when I did get on alone,

104
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.100
when he said,
uh,
I,
you know,
like I'm a free people that don't know me.

105
00:05:31.101 --> 00:05:34.580
I'm kind of like even you said,
I get a little too nice with my small talk like,

106
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.850
oh,
so it snowed here hot like the audience shit dude.

107
00:05:37.851 --> 00:05:41.870
You talked to that kid with the sneakers that went on forever.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
uh,

108
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.390
I can just talk to a stranger.
My grandfather was like that,
right?

109
00:05:44.391 --> 00:05:49.280
So I look at this guy,
I smile and he smiles back overly like too much.

110
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.320
And then he goes,
he said something,
I didn't say it.

111
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.160
And then he patted the seat next to him and looked at me like,
hey,

112
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.010
I have this seat.
Wait and for you.
And that made me like a

113
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.090
<v 1>little weird because it was all empty.
So I'm going,
Oh shit,
maybe this guy.
So,</v>

114
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:05.960
but bill says,
dude,
he goes,
he may think you're a Muslim.
So sure enough,

115
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:09.950
like he said,
like he said,
the guy comes next to me,

116
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:13.160
couldn't have been sweeter.
I go,
sorry about the bed.
No problem,
no problem.

117
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.330
And then he leans over and I'm just going,
fuck,
Oh God,
fuck your bill is right.

118
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.430
Let's not let them,
it's bad that you are right.
But he goes,
are you a Arabic?

119
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.230
And I go,
I go,
cause I didn't,
he goes out to pick you Arabic.

120
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.860
And he like pointed to my face and I go,
no.
And he goes,

121
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:30.550
you look at her beck and I go,
motherfucker.
Bill was right.

122
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.700
Literally wanted me to sit with him.
He thought I was Muslim.
How fuck okay.

123
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.870
You thought he was a gay guy with a little hat.
That's the funniest shit ever.

124
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.110
Oh my God dude.
All right,

125
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.160
I want to talk to you cause this is something that is gradually going into your

126
00:06:49.161 --> 00:06:49.521
act,

127
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:54.320
which I think is gonna make you stand out and it's going to be your voice in it

128
00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:58.280
is your,
uh,
your ideas of luxury,

129
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.880
your ideas of leisure,
amenities,
amenities you're have,
you're big into it.

130
00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:06.200
Many of these,
like if there's a mint on your pillow,
when you come back,

131
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.260
you feel like,
yes,
that means something.
It does.

132
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.370
And this is why I love working with you.
Not only that,
we're friends,

133
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:17.370
you got class never in a back to school.
You know,
you've got 91.
Mr Mallon,

134
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.610
you've got class.
He goes,
I rubbed off from you buzzy.

135
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.540
The guy that redid his college dorm,
never.
Hey,
you made the college dorm.

136
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:27.860
He knocked out walls.
No,
but you go,
you like your five star.
You know,
you're,

137
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.720
I wouldn't say you're not a cunt about it,
but you like,
you like Nice Shit.

138
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.700
You know,
I love,
I love,
listen,
I stayed in a bunch of Super Eights and Oh yeah.

139
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:40.920
And Motel six is yeah,
but I don't,
I don't stay at the,

140
00:07:40.921 --> 00:07:45.921
the fucking Ritz Carlton Penthouse when I like working with you too because you

141
00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:48.950
just like,
you know,
certain things and I liked that.
But uh,

142
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.270
yes to so I love the little things.
I love to slippers.
I loved it.

143
00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:56.720
I loved the chocolate.
I love the,

144
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:01.340
I love the joy that you get out of it.
And it's just so fucking funny.
I,

145
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.480
I don't know why,
why those little things mean something cause so slippers to,
if,

146
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.290
if you've got those slippers for Christmas,
you'd be like,

147
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:12.940
it's my wife cheating on me.
Yeah.
These things are so fucking cheap there.

148
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.280
They never fit your feet.
But you know,
you come in like,
dude,

149
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:19.600
you just see the robe.
Yeah,
I know.
Oh my God.
I don't know why bill,

150
00:08:19.601 --> 00:08:22.940
they had chocolates.
Yeah,
you would think that I was raised.

151
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:26.130
You would think that I was raised on the streets.
I don't know what,

152
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.870
I don't know what it is.
You sitting there.
We were on the airplane going like,

153
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:32.800
Dude,
you know what,
we should start an airline first of all,
like those costs,

154
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:37.430
billions of dollars.
And he goes,
we'd call it luxury air.

155
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.240
And I immediately go,
I wouldn't fly that.
You're like,
well,

156
00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:44.600
you wouldn't fly it against that.
It's just too on the nose.
It's trying too hard.

157
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.650
I feel like I'd go in there and they'd be like,
you know,
like a,

158
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.750
like a faucet that was like gold,
but it wasn't real gold,

159
00:08:50.751 --> 00:08:54.420
but it was golden color.
Like look at the luxury invitation Rolodex.
Yeah.

160
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.020
All of that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
so we were trying to come up,

161
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.690
but you would fly an airline that had 25 all first class seats,

162
00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.930
leather,
all beds.
This is,

163
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.280
this is what we were talking about right when I was like that there's a

164
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:12.750
difference between,
uh,
like classy,
right?

165
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.033
Gardy.

166
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.900
There's refined and then there's showing up and there's just certain people,

167
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.400
I don't know if either one is right.
I won't be like that.

168
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.740
If I look at like a Ferrari,

169
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.940
a guy my age can drive a Ferrari and not look like an asshole.

170
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.730
Do you keep yourself in shape and you can tell like this guy's,
he's into,

171
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.460
he's into like,
he knows how to work on cars.
He worked his way up.

172
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:38.670
I'm not talking about some fucking jerk off,
you know,
pinky ring type of thing.

173
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.770
But like a Lamborghini,
a Lamborghini is a young man's car.
That's for like,

174
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:45.840
you're in your 20s,
you're shirtless.

175
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.920
You got like a Cheetah on like a fucking leash.
Like,
like I,

176
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:53.540
I feel like the Lamborghini is obnoxious where the,

177
00:09:53.541 --> 00:09:56.400
the Ferrari is the shit,
right?
Like they,

178
00:09:56.401 --> 00:09:59.520
like if they were people like the Lamborghini would be walking around and

179
00:09:59.521 --> 00:10:02.300
talking about how much money it had,
where the fucking,

180
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.260
the Ferrari guy would be like,
chill.

181
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.580
<v 2>See,
here's the thing,
my Greek side is the class here,</v>

182
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.200
but my Sicilian kind of goes in and is like,
and,

183
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.100
and we have that battle,
but most of those cars are Italian that,

184
00:10:16.101 --> 00:10:19.520
that's made by Italian stuff.
So I know,
but that's why I see,
I like the chain.

185
00:10:19.521 --> 00:10:21.860
I love the gold chain.
It's like,
pardon me,
I love it,

186
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.410
but can you got to your chain?

187
00:10:23.411 --> 00:10:26.600
You literally said that the gold chain completed yet.
Yes.

188
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.130
You and Neon is love.
That yon is almost cried when I said that.
Yeah,

189
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:33.620
the gold changes did something,
but I can't go pinky ring.

190
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.980
That's where I draw the line.
So I think that that's the Greek where it's like,

191
00:10:36.981 --> 00:10:41.060
no,
you can't wear my father hundred percent full blooded Italian,

192
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.660
the whole thing.
He just goes,
he's,
he's like into the Jews.
He goes,
he goes,

193
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:45.690
would you go

194
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:50.690
<v 1>second chain?
I would go second chain if it complimented this the right way.</v>

195
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.320
So that,
that,
that's the high water mark that change.
Yeah.

196
00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:57.590
I mean I would go one more,
no,
no,
no,
no bumps it.
But the other one would,
would,

197
00:10:57.591 --> 00:10:59.930
would compliment it.
You wouldn't,
you wouldn't then?

198
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.910
<v 2>No.
Maybe even like a little thinner than this around it or what?</v>

199
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:06.510
It would compliment it.
That's it.
Oh,
okay.
Just an accent.
An accent.

200
00:11:06.511 --> 00:11:10.650
You look good in a chain.
No,
I wouldn't get a Jane.
No,

201
00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:13.620
I think I had a thin rope.
It would look good on you.
A thin one.

202
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.370
<v 1>Yeah,
but then I would start looking like something that I'm not,</v>

203
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.820
which I'm not something you ever wear a chain with a cross ever.

204
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.760
I grew up in the 80s.
Of course I did.
I had the,
uh,

205
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.720
but I wanted the smooth one around and my mother got me the one that's like
that,

206
00:11:26.721 --> 00:11:31.160
which wasn't in style.
Then the other one was the total Guido fucking,
the flat,

207
00:11:31.161 --> 00:11:36.020
the rope I had,
I able to be like,
what do you at?
Oh,
you got this.
Okay.
Okay.
So,

208
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.210
um,
yeah,
no,
I think this,
this,

209
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.380
this certain thing about if you have a chain,

210
00:11:42.381 --> 00:11:46.140
there's a certain level of shit you're going to talk.
There's a certain level of,

211
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.310
of,
you know,
there's something that,
you know,
the,
you can go out and get.

212
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:53.470
I would wear with something like that if I was playing a character in movie,

213
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:57.040
but like,
I know I'm not a chain guy.
No.
Are you a leather jacket guy?

214
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.950
You'll wear the nice leather?
Uh,
yeah.

215
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:04.360
I like what the jacket was like a,
but I wouldn't get a motorcycle.
One.

216
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.860
I get one that was like really like top leather leather,

217
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:13.210
but it was like a,
it was,
I'm wearing it because it's the last,

218
00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:15.550
it's cold outside.
Yeah,
you're not alive.
Yeah.

219
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:18.580
I'm not trying to wear it to be like,
oh,
look at my leather coat.

220
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:23.560
I can't pull it off,
dude.
I'm a fucking pasty northern European guy.
You know?

221
00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:25.900
I didn't grow up in southeastern south.
He was Southie.

222
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:28.900
I wasn't like one of these,
you know?
I mean,
I basically,

223
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.470
I didn't care about fighting somebody else until I got to junior high and

224
00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:36.400
everybody else grew and I didn't grow and then kids really could fucking fight.

225
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:39.130
Once I started seeing people getting their teeth knocked out and nose is broken,

226
00:12:39.131 --> 00:12:42.280
I was just like,
all right.
You know,
I mean,
I don't,

227
00:12:42.281 --> 00:12:45.580
I don't want to go into this world.
I'm too fucking slow.
You know?

228
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:50.380
I have the anger to do this,
but I'm going to lose.
And you know,
read Ed's dude,

229
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.680
you barely touch us.
We looked like we fucking fell off a motorcycle.

230
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.640
We just bruise so easily.
Were you ever a,
are you,
you're not a sneaker guy,

231
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.570
you're not a,
you're not,
were you ever like,
uh,
I like sneakers when I was,

232
00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:04.270
when I was a kid and I do like some old school ones,

233
00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:09.271
but I got to admit that subset of American culture where you know you're in your

234
00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:11.411
forties,

235
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:14.980
you're in your 50s and your still dressing like it's the first day of school at

236
00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:19.090
the bus stop.
We have like the brand like Aye.
Aye.
Aye.

237
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.000
You've made me like respect Jordans.
I like them in that type of shit.

238
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
But it is hilarious to me that we've worked some of the greatest theaters in

239
00:13:27.791 --> 00:13:32.350
America and you walk out with a pair of sneakers on and like,
you know,

240
00:13:32.351 --> 00:13:35.000
you chain out and shit like that.
And to you that's like dressing up.

241
00:13:35.001 --> 00:13:39.790
But where I'm from like um,
oh,
uh,
what's his face?
Nate Cordrey.

242
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:45.100
I worked with him on a,
on a fucking,
uh,
uh,

243
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.680
the heat and we were joking about Boston,
we were shooting there and he said,

244
00:13:48.681 --> 00:13:49.251
he goes,
dude,

245
00:13:49.251 --> 00:13:54.251
it's like totally acceptable in Massachusetts to show up to a holiday party

246
00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.960
wearing like a Tom Brady Jersey.
Like people be like,
Oh,
you've got the away one.

247
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.230
Oh,
that's cool.
I like that.
It's got the Superbowl patch on it.

248
00:14:03.231 --> 00:14:08.030
So I came from more like a sports culture like that,
but um,
there is something,

249
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.330
uh,
I think also,
I think it's because of being in this business,

250
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:15.890
which has so much shit about your age,
you know,
you gotta,
you know,

251
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.380
you've got to always try to look younger.
You got to do all this shit.

252
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.990
He's fucking women bench like that.
That doesn't happen to guys too.

253
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.600
You know what I mean?
Like if you go bald,

254
00:14:22.601 --> 00:14:24.610
that doesn't affect the fucking parts you get off for.

255
00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.100
So I as usual,

256
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:32.840
my cunty way rather than giving into that and getting the hair plugs and fucking

257
00:14:32.841 --> 00:14:34.680
trying to a,
you know,
you know,

258
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:39.020
do whatever I steer into my ites keep myself looking good.

259
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:44.230
But it's just like I'm willing to lose whatever I'm going to lose to not come

260
00:14:44.991 --> 00:14:47.360
out the other side with the fucking ant leg.

261
00:14:47.361 --> 00:14:52.070
Caterpillar hairs coming out of the top of my head and fucking know face yanked

262
00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:53.840
back and shit.
I'll tell you what's fucked up dude.

263
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.090
It's being in this business long enough.

264
00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.990
You know you're going to see it right now at 40.
Yeah.

265
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.330
Which you're going to see is you're going to see,

266
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.520
you're going to see the first few people that you start out with go crazy.

267
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.780
Someone's going to go legit crazy.
Uh,
someone's going to quit.

268
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.930
It's weird when they quit at forties are fucked up one for people where they

269
00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.890
just,
cause people start panicking.
If they don't have something going on,

270
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:20.840
they're going like,
this is my last port hole to get out of this shit and,

271
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.620
and actually have a legit career because I have this 20 year gap now in my

272
00:15:24.621 --> 00:15:28.200
fucking resume that I went out and I,
I told jokes and shit and,

273
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.190
and then you'll see the other people that just doubled down.

274
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.790
They got nothing going on,
and then they start getting a little botox.
Uh,

275
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.470
you know,

276
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.490
the shoe Polish is going into the fuck and they start throwing hail Mary's.
Yeah.

277
00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:41.870
No,
it's not.
I have males at this point,

278
00:15:41.871 --> 00:15:43.950
but there's definitely the throwing the hook and ladder up.

279
00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.800
Just definitely a halfback option.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

280
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.760
All of a sudden they throw in the fact that fake punt.
Yeah.

281
00:15:50.761 --> 00:15:54.530
Your fake cards coming out right on this,
this,
this time.
So it's scary,
man.

282
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.620
The thing is,
the thing is,
is when I was,
I might say we were talking about,

283
00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.680
but we would,
you know,
the business thing that I was talking to you about,

284
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.480
how you carry yourself in this fucking business,
right,

285
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.180
is there's that thing where you got to want it,
but you can't chase it.

286
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.640
You have to really believe in what it is that you're doing.

287
00:16:10.641 --> 00:16:15.180
And then stick to that with this weird thing where you have to be flexible if,

288
00:16:15.181 --> 00:16:17.570
if,
if,
if what you're doing isn't working,
but if you,
you know,

289
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.480
if you're not hurting anybody,

290
00:16:18.481 --> 00:16:20.930
you're not being malicious and you really have this fucking thing that you want

291
00:16:20.931 --> 00:16:23.900
to do,
you have to stay on that thing.
And when people tell you no,

292
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:27.530
you don't take it personal,
but then you don't keep chasing them.

293
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.660
When they say no to you,
you keep doing your thing,

294
00:16:29.661 --> 00:16:32.510
you keep fucking killing and all of a sudden they start hearing about you,

295
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.380
then they come to you and then it's everything that they said before.

296
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:39.890
It's water under the bridge and you have to let it go.
You can't ever do that.

297
00:16:39.891 --> 00:16:44.891
A mother fucking you fucking said no to me back in 96 because they're not going

298
00:16:45.001 --> 00:16:46.910
to remember it.
No.
And it's not.

299
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.180
And you're just going to come off and look like a fucking I insecure asshole.

300
00:16:50.181 --> 00:16:53.300
Yeah.
Well,
you know,
I remember what you said to me like five years ago.

301
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.530
I had just moved into the house upstate and I go,
uh,

302
00:16:56.531 --> 00:17:00.480
I remember I want it to get to tonight show.
I wanted to get something and um,

303
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.420
<v 2>why the fuck are you auditioning for that gonna be like,</v>

304
00:17:03.421 --> 00:17:05.730
they're going to hear about you and then they're going to want you.
And I'm,

305
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.880
I literally thought when I got off the phone,
I'm like,
nothing can,

306
00:17:08.881 --> 00:17:10.650
you're delusional.
You've been in the business longer than me,

307
00:17:10.651 --> 00:17:14.430
but I'm going like bills 10 years ahead of me.
Like,
what's he talking about?

308
00:17:14.431 --> 00:17:18.360
It's easy for him to say.
Right.
You know,
he's not an angry way,
but just like he,

309
00:17:18.361 --> 00:17:20.900
I'm trying to get something like he's there,
you know what,

310
00:17:20.901 --> 00:17:22.680
I'm trying to get something and then like sure enough,

311
00:17:22.681 --> 00:17:27.540
like last year I did this monster set at Gotham and the booker of the tonight

312
00:17:27.541 --> 00:17:30.420
show and he was just like a,
hey dude,
I don't know.
Yeah,

313
00:17:30.421 --> 00:17:33.060
just send me like whatever I need.
And you know,
obviously I want to work on it.

314
00:17:33.061 --> 00:17:35.430
This year and time went by,
I was working on the special side.

315
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.640
It didn't happen the way I want it to yet.
But he just goes,
yeah,
send me so well,

316
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.630
and it was just weird how he did kind of say,
I don't even need a tape.

317
00:17:42.631 --> 00:17:44.920
We'll just let me know,
send a transcript that like tell me.

318
00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.540
And I was literally like,
Oh my God,
that does happen.
Yeah,
but don't do it.

319
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.070
I chased,
I,
you know,

320
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.660
<v 1>I chased it right up til about 2001 2002 and that's when I said fuck this.</v>

321
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:58.260
But I did the whole thing when it was like whatever the look was,

322
00:17:58.261 --> 00:18:01.800
I tried to have the look,
you know the fucking goatee,
you know this is,

323
00:18:01.801 --> 00:18:05.040
I got old standup clips and everybody had to go t so I grew a fucking goatee.

324
00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:06.180
I had like a,
you know,

325
00:18:06.181 --> 00:18:08.940
it's funny now is now people will look at those things and they'll make comments

326
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:11.870
like they figured it out,
which is one of the things that I like,

327
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.130
like literally people listening right now.

328
00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:18.960
You guys are ruining so much shit that you could fucking,
you know,

329
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:19.860
I don't know.
Like I,

330
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.130
I saw there was something on Twitter today was like check it all these cool

331
00:18:23.131 --> 00:18:27.150
clips of people hanging out in Hollywood and all these fucking amazing parties

332
00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:31.900
and shit.
Uh,
that no longer happened cause social media ruined it.
And,

333
00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:34.940
and it's just like,
and I know everybody,
oh boohoo the,

334
00:18:34.941 --> 00:18:38.280
they can't fucking hang out who had did for getting food and he blows,
it pulls.

335
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.133
It's just like,
dude,

336
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:42.900
I read when I came in the business like that's all you wanted to hear all those

337
00:18:42.901 --> 00:18:45.660
stories about so and so going to the playboy mansion,

338
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.660
all these crazy fucking parties and all of that type of shit.

339
00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:52.500
And the thing was was they were fun and now everybody's sitting there acting

340
00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:55.800
like every fucking party.
There was some sort of like,

341
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.250
I dunno what me too thing that happened and everybody just had their fucking

342
00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:02.880
dick out and shit.
And it's just like,
it's just this,
it,
it,

343
00:19:02.881 --> 00:19:06.930
it was a total fucking overcorrection now and I'm a tell you something right
now.

344
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.440
People are going to run from this shit.
The way they,

345
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.730
if the AllSeen for awhile they were acting like the alt scene was going to bury

346
00:19:14.731 --> 00:19:17.760
like comedy clubs and then that just ended up fizzling out.

347
00:19:17.761 --> 00:19:19.320
Now comedy clubs are thriving,

348
00:19:19.321 --> 00:19:22.560
thriving and now all those students are slithering back into the comedy clubs

349
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.150
and it's just like all of that shit like they,

350
00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:30.210
any sort of like extreme thing like that it can't sustain itself.

351
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.390
It just eventually what happens is it's not,
it goes away and tears.

352
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:40.500
Well it levels out cause right now like the behavior that was wrong,

353
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.430
it's going to be reported from here on out but now that just go in like that

354
00:19:44.431 --> 00:19:45.780
sect,
that junk that I do on my act,

355
00:19:45.781 --> 00:19:48.210
it's like now where there's somebody did something or not,

356
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.570
somebody has to get in trouble like they have to throw a body on the fire every

357
00:19:51.571 --> 00:19:56.190
four to six weeks just to keep it in the news,
which I have a theory.

358
00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.070
I think what's going to happen is I think with the whole me too thing and

359
00:19:59.071 --> 00:20:02.910
everything,
I think what's going to make it die down and,
and I could be wrong,

360
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:05.730
but I think things are going to start coming out about females that did stuff.

361
00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.010
Ah No,
that,
that that's,

362
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.250
that's a fucking pipe dream because shit has and nothing happens to them.

363
00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:15.150
It's just why you teddy?
Actually,
you know what,
that nick cannon yeah.

364
00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:18.060
That nick can't think they were all doing.
Why are you being so petty nick?

365
00:20:18.061 --> 00:20:21.460
It's still is the guy's fault.
Where if somebody fucking did that to a gut,

366
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:22.890
if those were all guys,

367
00:20:22.891 --> 00:20:26.130
nick has looking out for his friend and he just something,
if he just said,

368
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.630
hey man,
if I don't want to do this,

369
00:20:27.631 --> 00:20:29.160
cause I don't want to get the people that he said in John.

370
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.480
Of course all of their tweets that I read were clearly them joking around.

371
00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:35.790
That's it.
They're all jokes that they're all just at the point is,

372
00:20:35.791 --> 00:20:39.330
it's all joke Kevin Hart's did as he was joking.
It was 10 years ago.

373
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.820
It was in his standup back and he's a comedian.
Yeah.

374
00:20:41.821 --> 00:20:46.470
And they're acting like they heard him say this at like at a party with no set

375
00:20:46.471 --> 00:20:47.200
up and punch on it.

376
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.300
I don't want to keep bringing this up because I don't want to attend to keep

377
00:20:49.301 --> 00:20:52.310
mulching that over cause I'm sure he wants to fucking move on from it.
But it,

378
00:20:52.311 --> 00:20:54.850
it is like this.
No,
it's just this,

379
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:58.590
this fucking thing that where everybody's go to.
Uh,
they get loud talk.

380
00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.530
They get that fucking Guy John Legend's shit because when he took a pit and his,

381
00:21:02.531 --> 00:21:05.180
he wrote music for that Dude's movie and it's like w what?

382
00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.050
He's supposed to be standing in his shower to be knowing what the fuck he's

383
00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:09.400
doing.
Yeah.

384
00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:13.480
Like you don't know what somebody has done if you went to their party and years

385
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.170
earlier,
you don't know.
Yeah.
I might as well as I know you.

386
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:20.650
I don't know what you do.
Well,
I mean,
I call it,

387
00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:22.480
we call it y'all are enough to bitch.
I know,

388
00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:25.900
but you start like you don't know what point would you ever call me?

389
00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:27.850
I'm gonna say a pill.
You wouldn't believe this man.

390
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.340
One time I took my deck out and I was blocking this door.

391
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:35.180
You would never tell me that.
But the thing is is I never did that.

392
00:21:35.181 --> 00:21:36.380
But that's what I'm saying.
I shouldn't have said.

393
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.800
But if you knew somebody like that then it'd be like,

394
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.390
how could you have been friends with this guy?

395
00:21:40.391 --> 00:21:43.830
It's like he had fucking tell me that shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.

396
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.210
People who are friends with people at work and the finds out there like a

397
00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:49.690
fucking serial killer.
How could you take a picture with this guy?

398
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.550
He had already murdered 40 people.
It's like,

399
00:21:51.551 --> 00:21:53.920
well he wasn't bringing that up when we were fucking hanging around the water

400
00:21:53.921 --> 00:21:57.700
cooler.
Yeah.
You know to man,
like I feel like a lot of these head coaches,

401
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.870
we were talking about it before,

402
00:21:58.871 --> 00:22:03.040
like you've got 53 man roster and you love him and one of them does something

403
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.070
and then they're like this piece of shit new and it's like,
you know,

404
00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.380
it's totally,
yeah.
That becomes,
that then becomes at,

405
00:22:08.381 --> 00:22:10.900
and then all of a sudden it's like this program is corrupt and everything,

406
00:22:10.901 --> 00:22:14.890
like everybody knew and everybody,
everybody knew and everybody knows,
dude,

407
00:22:14.891 --> 00:22:16.000
I remember,
I'm not gonna say names,

408
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:19.870
but one comic got in trouble and this guy tried to suggest that the entire

409
00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:22.660
comedy club all got together and protected this guy.

410
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:27.430
And I almost did a spit take.
It's like the second that guy got in trouble,

411
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:32.560
all anybody underneath him was thinking is great.
Now I can get his spots.
I mean,

412
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.650
they just don't,
and it's always people who aren't in the fucking business.

413
00:22:35.651 --> 00:22:39.730
It's just,
they don't understand how fucking cutthroat this business,

414
00:22:39.731 --> 00:22:42.370
this business is.
Fuck,
I actually,
it's no nuts.

415
00:22:42.371 --> 00:22:45.460
No different than I imagine if you were in the oil industry,
you know,

416
00:22:45.461 --> 00:22:47.110
if you're on Wall Street,
just all of it,

417
00:22:47.111 --> 00:22:51.340
when you're going for something that in the end,
at least back in the day,

418
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.550
you're going to have a yacht dude.
And there's going to be models on it,

419
00:22:54.551 --> 00:22:57.910
like your fantasy when you're in your 20s,
like the shit that people are,
uh,

420
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.470
are willing to do.
Dude.
I remember after I did my second show ever,

421
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.030
I in New York City,
I crushed and I walked off and I literally was like,
dude,

422
00:23:07.031 --> 00:23:10.360
I'm going to be in.
I'm like,
I'm going to be,
he started thinking,
you're like,

423
00:23:10.361 --> 00:23:11.980
oh my God.
Cause you're like nobody could do,

424
00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.930
you don't realize that there's other people out there.

425
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:16.570
You know when you first started doing it like this,
I'm going to be a fucking,

426
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:18.010
you know,
you can come in a business.

427
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:22.260
The first thing everybody thinks is I'm going to win an Oscar.
I'm gonna,

428
00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:25.680
I'm gonna have a fucking special and all that type of shit.
And then once,
when I,

429
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:29.950
what I liked about this business of in the last 10 years is I've actually

430
00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:31.690
figured out where I want to be in it.

431
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:36.550
So any of that shit I would love to still happen or whatever.
But like,

432
00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.840
it's just like if I could just traveling,
we're fucking Warsaw right now.

433
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.690
Like I just looked out there and I'm looking at this shit,

434
00:23:43.691 --> 00:23:44.890
I can't fucking believe I'm here.

435
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:48.260
I can already tell this is going to be like Budapest where I remember we were

436
00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:50.660
walking around Budapest yesterday.
I was like,
Paul,
I was just,

437
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.910
I liked this placement and these people are fucking cool.

438
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.540
And I got that vibe from the dude who drove was over here.

439
00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:01.720
<v 2>He was funny.
Estonia when I saw the guy and he was like,
okay.
And I was like,</v>

440
00:24:01.721 --> 00:24:02.910
this might not go the same.

441
00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:07.420
And then when I got to Budapest and that woman was like,
oh here.
And she said,

442
00:24:07.421 --> 00:24:09.780
my mother in law and if your throat hurts,
take this.

443
00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:11.560
And all of a sudden I was like,
oh,
it's going to be great.

444
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:12.850
I got the same vibe here.

445
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.960
How funny is it that I saw like a Kia motors building and a fortnight poster,

446
00:24:16.961 --> 00:24:19.250
which made me think of my son and I'm going to think it'd be great here,

447
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:23.940
you know,
but I will tell you this,
Bill,
I noticed this,
um,

448
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:28.990
I told you we were on a train from Munich to Frankfurt and I just started

449
00:24:28.991 --> 00:24:31.720
watching people,
you know,
and people are the same.

450
00:24:31.721 --> 00:24:35.470
Like I saw these 80 year old woman and they gave little candies out in the thing

451
00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:39.430
and she took whatever her daughter or whoever did it and I saw her get her purse

452
00:24:39.431 --> 00:24:41.680
and opened a person like my grandmother used to do with cookies.

453
00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:43.060
My grandmother was like,

454
00:24:43.061 --> 00:24:45.190
I don't know if it was from when she grew up cause she came here.

455
00:24:45.191 --> 00:24:47.890
My grandmother came to the United States,
10 years old from Sicily,

456
00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.390
didn't speak a lick of English,

457
00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.010
would like go to a park and learn English that way at 10 years old,
oh my God,

458
00:24:54.011 --> 00:24:57.600
she was,
she came at 10 years old,
a rest her soul.
She died.

459
00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:02.320
I think she died at 80 80 in mid eighties so she probably,

460
00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.440
I need a year.
I'm trying to do the math and thrown out yet.

461
00:25:05.441 --> 00:25:08.770
When she tried to do the year,
when she painted,
she dialed do it for you.

462
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:12.260
She passed I believe in o nine oh nine [inaudible].

463
00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:17.320
So that's like 1929 she probably came in the twenties 29 no wait,

464
00:25:17.321 --> 00:25:17.680
no.

465
00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:22.680
Is that 29 was that 91939495969 yeah,

466
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.970
it'd be 19 to 19 right.
So she got here,

467
00:25:24.971 --> 00:25:28.780
let's say 1920 New York City depressions hang years old,

468
00:25:28.781 --> 00:25:30.190
never spoke a lick of English.

469
00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.280
And then she did this thing where like when we would go out,
she would go,
hey,

470
00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.950
if they take those cookies and I'd be like grandma,

471
00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:39.370
she would literally take two cookies that were that wrap 'em and Napkins and put

472
00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:42.220
her in bed.
But still just that depression era shit.

473
00:25:42.221 --> 00:25:45.890
So I saw this German woman do it and then I saw like the little kids and I saw

474
00:25:45.891 --> 00:25:49.220
little girls from Germany on their phone.
Like it's all the same shit.
Yeah.

475
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.450
You know,
I'll talk about a fight with my wife and the jury,

476
00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.970
even the journey cause ah,
they get it.

477
00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:59.500
Everybody's the same human beings that that's what this trip has shown me is

478
00:25:59.501 --> 00:26:04.450
that human beings are really all the same in a way,
which is now your bad ones.

479
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.010
This,
this will change how you then view foreign policy.

480
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:13.000
And when this,
when they're sitting there,
you know,
trying to make,

481
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:17.740
I still want the wall.
I don't want those atoms.
Calm Kid.
No,
but I know,
but uh,
I,

482
00:26:17.741 --> 00:26:19.930
yeah,
it makes you think like,
oh well you know,

483
00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:21.700
<v 1>no,
but this shit where they sit there and they,</v>

484
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.430
oh you know what I like your idea of,

485
00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.660
of say the Middle East and stuff like that.
It just changes your life.

486
00:26:28.661 --> 00:26:31.180
Cause there's that grandmother there,
there's the variety there,

487
00:26:31.181 --> 00:26:35.320
there's the me there and then what you have is the lunatics at the top and they

488
00:26:35.321 --> 00:26:39.170
just get everybody all fucking stirred up beneath them that these fucking people

489
00:26:39.171 --> 00:26:40.810
are going to come over here and they're going to do this,

490
00:26:40.811 --> 00:26:43.670
they're going to do that and all of this shit.
So I don't know.
You know,

491
00:26:43.671 --> 00:26:44.100
it's fucking

492
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.650
<v 2>hilarious about that.
That whole fucking Trump thing with the wall is,</v>

493
00:26:46.651 --> 00:26:48.470
I didn't realize there's there,
they're already really,

494
00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:52.620
basically there's a wall there.
There's some areas where an area,

495
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.440
he's trying to get the area of the south that doesn't have as much,

496
00:26:55.441 --> 00:26:56.820
which they're saying is doing stuff.

497
00:26:56.821 --> 00:27:00.230
But he doubled down so much on it that that's why he's not,

498
00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.300
it's like this is the thing,
like I don't think either side's going to back down.

499
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:03.601
No.

500
00:27:03.601 --> 00:27:07.530
Because the Democrats can't back down and he's just getting up and walking out.

501
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:11.100
A guide that prideful that tweets late at night at celebrities that don't
matter.

502
00:27:11.101 --> 00:27:14.040
Calls Single Comedians' names out as the present United States.

503
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:17.790
That guy that said we're getting the wall done and doubled down and promised his

504
00:27:17.791 --> 00:27:22.640
thing.
He can't.
Yeah.
I can't tell if he's like,
uh,
not used to hearing.

505
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:26.200
<v 1>No.
If it's insecurity,
like I'm not a psychologist,</v>

506
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:31.470
but however he is made up,
um,
is,
is he's,

507
00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:36.360
he isn't going to back down.
I love that tweet that you show share demands.

508
00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.900
We'll just say share what?

509
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:39.630
<v 2>Oh yeah,
I saw,</v>

510
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.620
what was the word that they install all these headlines on the phone.
Um,

511
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:44.310
shared demands,

512
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:49.400
shared demands that Polosi don't die on top hill tops to shut down and don't

513
00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:54.410
die.
Live share demands.
It's shared a man.
Yeah,
the pops,
the singer,
the,
the,

514
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:55.530
the wetlands.

515
00:27:55.540 --> 00:28:00.540
It well shared demands that this politician doesn't listen to.

516
00:28:00.691 --> 00:28:05.280
This reality TV star that is now president,
like that's where the fuck were at.

517
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.920
Bill,
do not have funny.
The headline is shared demands.

518
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:08.881
<v 1>Well,</v>

519
00:28:08.881 --> 00:28:11.790
what's funny is Trump's been presence is so fucking long that you forget that

520
00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:16.740
this is the guy from the apprentice.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

521
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:20.010
It's bad.
You know,
I just liked it.

522
00:28:20.011 --> 00:28:24.360
Now people are finally being able to kind of question financially what the fuck

523
00:28:24.361 --> 00:28:28.920
we're doing over in Iraq because that is the big fucking thing.
And that is not,

524
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:32.790
that is not liberal or conservative.
That is just black and white dude.

525
00:28:32.791 --> 00:28:36.690
Where it's just like how the fuck like to hear your kids,
kids,

526
00:28:36.691 --> 00:28:40.020
kids are still gonna be paying that fucking tab.
It's,
you know,

527
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:44.190
and I think that they should fucking investigate those corporations that has

528
00:28:44.191 --> 00:28:46.290
made zillions of dollars off of this.

529
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.710
W I think of the ones that are prolonging whatever the fuck it is we're still

530
00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:54.480
doing there.
Um,
I dunno,
I mean,
I don't know enough about it,
but I,

531
00:28:54.481 --> 00:28:57.000
I do,
I do know how to balance a fucking checkbook.

532
00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.780
And I do see money coming in versus money going out assets.

533
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:02.770
And Liabilities and there is,

534
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:06.000
there is no other fucking business where you wouldn't,

535
00:29:06.001 --> 00:29:07.860
you wouldn't right now just be completely fucked.

536
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.680
That's another funny fucking thing about him wanting to build this wall.

537
00:29:10.681 --> 00:29:12.360
It's like with what money?
Yeah.

538
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.040
<v 2>Cause they're gonna be like,
well that's going to create jobs and blah blah blah.</v>

539
00:29:16.041 --> 00:29:20.060
Yeah,
but then you still have to pay for the fucking wall.
And He fucked up man.

540
00:29:20.061 --> 00:29:24.170
He fucked up dude by saying Mexico is going to pay for it and now American

541
00:29:24.171 --> 00:29:28.490
taxpayers are gonna pay for it.
It's,
it's fucked up.
But uh,
talking about money,

542
00:29:28.491 --> 00:29:30.060
you know,
he didn't because nobody's

543
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:30.990
<v 1>going to remember that.</v>

544
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:36.320
And all people do is like getting people who are for Trump to admit that this,

545
00:29:38.101 --> 00:29:41.770
this financially doesn't make sense or what have,

546
00:29:41.771 --> 00:29:43.570
we don't have the money or whatever the fuck it is.

547
00:29:43.571 --> 00:29:48.550
It's literally trying to get somebody who's like a die hard whatever fan to

548
00:29:48.551 --> 00:29:52.750
admit that that bullshit call that went your way was actually a bullshit call.

549
00:29:52.751 --> 00:29:55.210
Like I would say like last,
not this past season,

550
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:58.510
the season before when that steel or click clearly caught the ball against the

551
00:29:58.511 --> 00:30:01.930
patriots clearly caught a fucking touchdown and they called it back.

552
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.240
Now the amount of patriots fans,

553
00:30:04.241 --> 00:30:08.110
I'll throw my own friends under the bus with the amount of them that would have

554
00:30:08.111 --> 00:30:12.580
to be,
they would dove clearly he didn't make a football move rule is the rule.

555
00:30:12.581 --> 00:30:15.130
Yeah,
yeah.
They would say that,
but it's just like,
you know,

556
00:30:15.131 --> 00:30:18.700
I'm one of those guys all the way along.
The line was saying the Tuck rule is,

557
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:19.990
it's a stupid rule.

558
00:30:19.991 --> 00:30:23.650
I understand that they wanted to have clarification or whatever,

559
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.690
but it's just at the end of the day it's like,
dude,

560
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.920
he had the guy slapped it out of his fucking hands and fell on it.
It's a fumble.

561
00:30:29.921 --> 00:30:33.380
The fucking game is over the top row.
I remember Tom Brady being like,
hey man,

562
00:30:33.381 --> 00:30:35.500
that's the fucking tucked role.
It's just like whatever,

563
00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:38.290
but like trying to get people politically.

564
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.080
I see kids to look at people like trying to get,

565
00:30:41.081 --> 00:30:46.081
like most of my friends are liberals trying to get them to see things about the

566
00:30:46.091 --> 00:30:49.980
Clintons or the Obama's or whatever.
They just think,
oh,
but they did.

567
00:30:49.981 --> 00:30:53.080
The best they'll say is they're not as bad as Bush than not as bad as Trump.

568
00:30:53.081 --> 00:30:57.520
It's just like they always just steer it into this fucking argument where it's

569
00:30:57.521 --> 00:30:58.241
just like,
you know,

570
00:30:58.241 --> 00:31:01.630
if this guy is really a man of the people and he's really such a great guy,

571
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.530
why are his first two speaking engagements with two of the biggest fucking banks

572
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:08.920
out there when all of these people are upside down in their houses because of

573
00:31:08.921 --> 00:31:11.200
these fucking cons?
Because at the end of the day,

574
00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:12.850
they're getting paid by the same guys.

575
00:31:12.851 --> 00:31:15.610
They got their faces in the fucking pig trough and this is too big for this

576
00:31:15.611 --> 00:31:17.440
podcast.
I don't know why we're talking about this.

577
00:31:17.441 --> 00:31:20.090
Maybe it's not going to spend the money about spending money.

578
00:31:20.091 --> 00:31:23.430
You can balance a budget.
I mean you can balance.
You want to know what though?

579
00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:27.700
I'm not good at it now.
I'm getting better.
I'm getting pell told me,

580
00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.570
Paul told me cause his special did so well and now he's selling tickets.
He goes,

581
00:31:31.571 --> 00:31:34.750
Bill,
I'm not going to lie to you.
I'm going to go through,

582
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:39.400
I'm going to go through a fur coat face.
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't do that.

583
00:31:39.401 --> 00:31:41.680
I actually think that that's too much.
I do think of for call.

584
00:31:41.681 --> 00:31:45.470
It's a little ridiculous.
I do.
I don't know you like you liked one.

585
00:31:45.471 --> 00:31:49.510
Will that fighter came in when he goes,
this is fucking polar bear.
The Guy,

586
00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:53.020
he looks like the Burger King Guy.
The fucking,
he's got the super fast.

587
00:31:53.021 --> 00:31:57.340
What's his name or the Irish guy?
Yeah.
Notorious Conor.
Conor McGregor.
Yeah.

588
00:31:57.341 --> 00:32:00.070
He came out with like a white one and he just started walking,

589
00:32:00.071 --> 00:32:03.160
but he did it like no shirt chain underneath.
Like that guy.

590
00:32:03.161 --> 00:32:06.420
That guy's not only one of the best fighters in the world and he could just shit

591
00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:11.410
talking.
He's up.
Maybe take five.
He could be a great standup comedian.
So yes.

592
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:16.570
Yeah,
I think kind of immigrant,
but he's shit talking.
I put them top five.
He's,

593
00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.490
he's at wrestler level.
I love that one.

594
00:32:18.491 --> 00:32:22.190
One time when he was doing to promote promotion it,
oh,

595
00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:26.950
you'll do fucking not that.
My favorite one was when,
when he goes,
uh,

596
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.700
this guy's tried to give him shit and he just turns around and goes,
oh,

597
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:33.610
the fuck are you?
Who the fuck is this guy?

598
00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:36.990
And even the guy started laughing and be like,
yeah,
I know.
Nobody knows who I am.

599
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:41.630
I was trying to get famous off of you.
He had all of them laughing.

600
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:46.400
I remember Rhonda Rousey was another thing.
He goes,
Ooh,
Ooh to focus this guy.

601
00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.410
I love what he goes,
Yo do nothing.
And he gets,
he gets into it.
Oh He's,
he's,

602
00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.300
he's on there man.
He's up there with that Lego.
But I will tell you this too.

603
00:32:53.301 --> 00:32:56.900
I know he was going to,
I told you I heard things from people,

604
00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.430
but when he was talking that extra shit,
somebody goes,
dude,
this is rocky three.

605
00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.130
When that guy beat him,
like it seemed like he,
what does well,

606
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.740
because I feel like right now what he's trying to do,
cause too,

607
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.040
those guys are all pieces of me.
Yeah.

608
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.480
So what he's doing right now is I think he's realized that.

609
00:33:14.481 --> 00:33:17.180
So he's trying to get on the other side where it's just like,
all right,

610
00:33:17.181 --> 00:33:20.820
how the fuck can I get the most amount of money without getting my brains
beaten?

611
00:33:20.821 --> 00:33:23.330
And so he took all that money to fight like Mayweather.

612
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.330
It's kind of like in the porn industry,
we're after a while they're like,

613
00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.420
fuck this.
I'm starting my own website.
Yeah.
You know,

614
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.200
if I'm going to take all these hits,
man,
I'm fucking make it.

615
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.840
The money's coming to me.
Right.

616
00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.210
Probably a fucked up analogy.

617
00:33:38.211 --> 00:33:41.000
They can all these shots taken all these shots to the face,
man.

618
00:33:41.001 --> 00:33:45.740
I'm going to fucking stop milk that God.
Yeah,
exactly.
That's exactly it.

619
00:33:45.741 --> 00:33:48.140
All right.
I got to read a couple of advertising and then we're done.
Hey,

620
00:33:48.141 --> 00:33:50.990
do you have any or club dates or anything that you've got a ton,
man,

621
00:33:50.991 --> 00:33:54.470
I've got a ton.
I'm going to be a February through July.
All kinds of dates.

622
00:33:54.471 --> 00:33:56.520
I believe my,
uh,
late February date data,

623
00:33:56.521 --> 00:34:00.390
helium and buffalo tickets are on sale now,
but I have a bunch of dates.

624
00:34:00.391 --> 00:34:02.980
So I was going to love about you.
What's your website?
You don't,
yeah.
Yeah,

625
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:06.230
it does.
Sounds,
it sounds right now,
uh,
if you go to the,
it's all done.

626
00:34:06.231 --> 00:34:08.900
The website's new Paul [inaudible] dot com Vir.

627
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:14.220
The show's page has all the dates from now through 19 and more being added.
Yes.

628
00:34:14.221 --> 00:34:19.170
And I can tell you that when we were at Gotham,
uh,
oh yeah.
Uh,
what was it?

629
00:34:19.171 --> 00:34:23.100
A month ago or so I went and I did a show for the Mozillas.
I love those guys.

630
00:34:23.101 --> 00:34:26.310
And they,
uh,
they were nice enough after we did the Gig in New York,

631
00:34:26.311 --> 00:34:29.520
the month before they had the after party at the cake boss make the cake.

632
00:34:29.521 --> 00:34:34.500
They just the best guys ever.
Um,
Steve and Chris.
So I was like,
I'm uncombed back.

633
00:34:34.501 --> 00:34:35.251
I'll do a night.

634
00:34:35.251 --> 00:34:39.000
So he did a night and you were on stage in front of me and you didn't know that

635
00:34:39.001 --> 00:34:41.460
Seinfeld was coming down?
No.
Yeah.

636
00:34:41.461 --> 00:34:43.530
So we were having him stretch and pulse thinking.

637
00:34:43.531 --> 00:34:46.200
Why do they keep having me do more time bills in the room?

638
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.570
And I watched you do like 30,

639
00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:52.680
35 minutes and you will refund and you were fucking around.

640
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:54.540
And I was just like,
wow man,

641
00:34:54.541 --> 00:34:56.940
this guy's like the legit headliner and I'm telling you dude,

642
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.650
hours are going to come easy.

643
00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:04.220
Much easier for you then then somebody who like is like a joke writer,

644
00:35:04.351 --> 00:35:07.410
which is why I love joke writers cause it's like,
like how hard,

645
00:35:07.411 --> 00:35:09.800
much harder it is for them.
But you're like a storyteller.

646
00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:15.210
You are fucking with the crowd.
I mean I was like,
uh,
I was really like you,

647
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.280
you came into your own dude.
So definitely check Paul out.
Oh,

It's built bar and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

705
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:15.160
January 10th,
2011.
How are Ya?
Hello?

706
00:39:15.161 --> 00:39:18.730
It's me.
Why is that song in my head?

707
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:24.240
Lionel Richie.
Lionel Richie.
There's a good looking fellow.

708
00:39:24.241 --> 00:39:29.050
Huh?
That was one weird looking son of a bitch,
wasn't it?
You know,
with his,

709
00:39:29.051 --> 00:39:31.600
his Jheri curl,
he had a Jerry curl,

710
00:39:31.601 --> 00:39:34.930
a mullet and an afro all at the same time.

711
00:39:34.931 --> 00:39:39.070
Three of a two out of three of the worst fucking haircuts ever.

712
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:42.910
I think the Afro was cool if you were in the Aba.
Other than that,

713
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:47.740
it was probably a,
just another reason for racist to not get along.

714
00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:51.250
You know,
you sit there,
you're trying to be open minded.

715
00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:55.180
You're write a fucking sporting event or maybe at a movie theater and some guy

716
00:39:55.181 --> 00:39:59.650
comes walking in with a big doctor,
j Afro,
you know,

717
00:39:59.651 --> 00:40:03.940
it doesn't have the decency to put that Frederick Douglass part on the side.

718
00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:07.780
So maybe you could look down as part and see a little bit of jaws,

719
00:40:07.781 --> 00:40:11.170
part two or whatever the fuck was coming out when people had hair like that and

720
00:40:11.171 --> 00:40:16.000
what it creates
animosity.

721
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:21.010
That's what it is.
Everybody thinks it's said slavery stuff.

722
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.490
They think it's the Holocaust.
That's not what it is.
It's the haircuts people.

723
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:28.720
That's why people don't get along.
You know,
you look at other people's hair cuts,

724
00:40:28.721 --> 00:40:31.990
it EOA kind of.
People will get haircuts like that,
you know?

725
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:35.350
And then there's some little psycho in the corner with greasy hair in a weird

726
00:40:35.351 --> 00:40:39.250
mustache and the shit starts.
That's how it goes down.
People.

727
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.560
He might be sitting there right now.
Go cheap bill.

728
00:40:41.561 --> 00:40:45.370
That was really fucking ignorant.
Don't you watch the history channel?

729
00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:50.950
As a matter of fact,
I do.
I do watch the history channel.

730
00:40:50.951 --> 00:40:54.910
Thank you very much for not asking me and allowing me to create your question in

731
00:40:54.911 --> 00:40:57.340
my head.
I do watch the history channel and there's,

732
00:40:57.341 --> 00:41:02.170
there's no history left on that channel.
All they show is pawn shop on that shit.

733
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:04.180
I don't know what the fuck is on that.
You know,

734
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:06.070
it's just become like every other channel.

735
00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.010
I was reading something today where they were doing a mini series on the

736
00:41:09.011 --> 00:41:12.850
Kennedys.
I a good shade a bridge and,
uh,

737
00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:18.180
am I really going to do a hacky Ted Kennedy?
I think I've got to,
yeah.
Joe,

738
00:41:18.181 --> 00:41:22.780
we went down to the bottom of the logo,
add a,
I took a deep breath.

739
00:41:22.781 --> 00:41:24.670
I finger fucked her a couple of more times,

740
00:41:24.671 --> 00:41:26.890
left her in the car and swam to the surface.

741
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.940
Actually the size of my head maybe be so buoyant.

742
00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:35.180
I just sort of floated unconsciously,
your honor.
Uh,
yeah.

743
00:41:35.181 --> 00:41:39.290
So they had a mini series about the,
uh,
the Kennedys and they canceled it.

744
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.390
They canceled it yet for some reason,
uh,

745
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.130
evidentaly if you have a bunch of shit in a storage shed,

746
00:41:46.131 --> 00:41:49.330
they want to go down and film it.
Um,

747
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:53.060
was that a little social commentary?
Is that what I did?

748
00:41:53.061 --> 00:41:55.310
Two minutes and 49 seconds into the podcast.

749
00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.160
Did I really just do some sort of a,

750
00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:03.890
what is the state of the history channel commentary?
I think I did.
Um,

751
00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.030
okay.

752
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:09.350
Well I have an announcement to make and it's with heavy heart that I have to

753
00:42:09.351 --> 00:42:14.210
tell you that my three week vacation is over,
you know,

754
00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:16.730
uh,
yeah,
it's back to the goddamn grind.

755
00:42:16.731 --> 00:42:18.800
And I know a lot of you right now going three weeks,
dude,

756
00:42:18.801 --> 00:42:22.340
I get fucking two weeks for the year.
Well,
you know what?
That's your fault.

757
00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:26.540
All right?
You pick that career.
It's a free God damn country.

758
00:42:26.541 --> 00:42:30.330
Go write some fucking jokes.
You can't,
maybe then you,

759
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:35.450
you could take a three week vacation and buy vacation.
What I meant is,
uh,

760
00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:37.130
I,
I didn't have to get on a plane.

761
00:42:37.131 --> 00:42:40.610
I didn't have to go to any airports for three weeks was awesome.

762
00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:45.380
I was actually hanging out with some people a the other day and uh,

763
00:42:45.381 --> 00:42:46.131
they weren't Comedians,

764
00:42:46.131 --> 00:42:50.900
but they traveled a lot and we just sat around talking about different airports

765
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:56.170
and that blew my mind how much I knew about all these airports and places where

766
00:42:56.901 --> 00:43:00.110
you could get something decent to eat and buy decent.
Of course,

767
00:43:00.111 --> 00:43:03.230
I mean by airport standards,
you know,

768
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:05.300
I know whenever I land in Dallas,

769
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.440
I'm going to come down that fucking escalator for,
for my connecting flight.

770
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:12.710
And there's that awful Mexican restaurant that's right there.

771
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:17.890
And every time I go in there because I'm hungry and I hope against hope that

772
00:43:18.171 --> 00:43:22.220
they're going to have the real cheese and not that cheese whiz.
You know,

773
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:27.140
that cheese come that they put on the burritos and every time I order a fucking

774
00:43:27.141 --> 00:43:29.060
Burrito,
I said,
hey,
listen,
this Burrito,

775
00:43:29.061 --> 00:43:33.930
does it have the real cheese or does it have that nuclear waste cheese with

776
00:43:33.931 --> 00:43:38.360
stuff?
And the waitress never knows,
you know,

777
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:40.940
because who's getting home?
If you're a waitress at an airport,

778
00:43:40.941 --> 00:43:45.680
you don't give a fuck,
you know?
I don't know.
Let me go in and ask the sheriff.

779
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:52.460
Then they go in and they come back.
So what's the verdict there?
Uh,

780
00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:57.020
what's a good Texas fucking nine?
Tacy.
You what's,
what's the verdict there,

781
00:43:57.021 --> 00:44:00.410
sweetheart?
Is it the,
do you have the real cheese?

782
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:06.200
We certainly doubt nodding the head.
You know,
mind fucking,
you're like,

783
00:44:06.201 --> 00:44:09.620
you've got to get an,
you know,
nodding up north means yes.

784
00:44:09.621 --> 00:44:13.560
Down South they could mean yes or fuck no.
Why?

785
00:44:13.561 --> 00:44:18.500
We most certainly do not.
We absolutely doubt,

786
00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:22.370
ah,
with your big fucking,

787
00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:28.850
those big fucking Texarkana,
those Oklahoma,

788
00:44:28.851 --> 00:44:32.490
that fucking huge white girl face that,

789
00:44:32.491 --> 00:44:36.510
that Hugh Hefner loves.
He loves those girls.

790
00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:38.970
Those big panhandle faces.

791
00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:45.060
Huge fucking heads.
Texas,
Oklahoma,
Arkansas,

792
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:50.270
white girls got the biggest rounders fucking heads I've ever seen in my life.

793
00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:56.130
Jesus fucking Christ.
They played football.
You couldn't get in my helmet.

794
00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:59.970
You'd have,
you'd have to custom make helmets for the beautiful bodies,

795
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.890
you know,
big Vanilla titties,
Huh?

796
00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:12.840
That's right.
Big Vanilla.
Titties.
I,
yeah.
Big Banella Teddy's,
they got the,

797
00:45:12.841 --> 00:45:13.674
you know,

798
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.300
the stars at night are big and bright.

799
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:23.100
Just like my big fucking head,
you know,

800
00:45:23.101 --> 00:45:27.180
if I'd have slapped the shit out of any woman,
I don't,
I think I can't.
Yeah,

801
00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:31.710
I think it'd be what some chick from fucking Texarkana,
Oklahoma,
you know,

802
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:36.030
just get a big 12 ounce glove,
right.
Boxing Glove,

803
00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:43.410
big fruit card of a fucking head.
Um,
all right.
Speaking of which,

804
00:45:43.411 --> 00:45:48.090
I will be in Addison,
Texas,
now that I've trashed,
you're women,
you're women.
Okay.

805
00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:53.170
I'm going to be there the last weekend,
uh,
in,
uh,
in January.

806
00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:57.250
So if you get a chance,
you know,
you know,

807
00:45:57.251 --> 00:45:59.320
you put on your best pair of boots.

808
00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.290
Is that what you guys do out there in Dallas?

809
00:46:02.291 --> 00:46:05.770
Why am I shitting on this is the second week in a row I've shit on people in
the,

810
00:46:05.771 --> 00:46:09.110
in the Greater Dallas area.
Um,

811
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:12.820
and I still have the audacity to think that I'm going to sell tickets down
there.

812
00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.990
Jesus Christ.
Is this the Chinese Year of arrogance?

813
00:46:16.991 --> 00:46:20.740
Because that's what I'm feeling.
Um,
anyways,

814
00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:24.940
so two more weeks of no Busan and I've made my 100 days,

815
00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:30.700
100 days.
I think about you in a hundred ways.

816
00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.231
What song was that?

817
00:46:32.231 --> 00:46:35.350
Was that a Jane's addiction song or was that when they were porno for Pyros?

818
00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:39.340
Pyros.
Huh?
Was that Tahitian Moon?

819
00:46:39.341 --> 00:46:44.200
Is that what I was just singing there?
What was it,
Bali in my eyes.
Um,
I,
my the,

820
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:47.250
uh,
the,
is it anybody else in the podcast?
I'm a,
I am.

821
00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.450
I like the only person who ever bought that CD.

822
00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:56.020
The second porno for Pyros.
I like Bali,
that song.

823
00:46:56.021 --> 00:46:56.854
Bali.

824
00:46:57.490 --> 00:47:01.240
I don't like the weird high pitch singing that Perry Farrell does in the

825
00:47:01.241 --> 00:47:01.931
beginning of it,

826
00:47:01.931 --> 00:47:05.140
but I really liked the sound of the guitar just in case you were wondering if

827
00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.340
you would just sit in there going,
you know,

828
00:47:06.341 --> 00:47:10.480
I wonder what bill thinks about that obscure track.
What does it,

829
00:47:10.481 --> 00:47:15.280
the fucking last song,
second side
fucking gives a shit.

830
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.080
All right,
what the hell am I talking about?
Okay,
let's,

831
00:47:17.081 --> 00:47:20.440
let's talk about something in sports that really fucking bothered me this

832
00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:24.400
weekend.
Uh,
I was watching the Bruins Canadians game.
Okay.

833
00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:26.320
Pay horrific loss for the Bruins.

834
00:47:26.321 --> 00:47:29.380
We were up to the north and then we led up to fucking goals and then right in

835
00:47:29.381 --> 00:47:30.700
the end and the lost in overtime.

836
00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:35.720
Well this is what pisses me off about the fucking Canadians is uh,

837
00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:38.410
the Canadians are sort of like,

838
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:42.850
they're like math and I'm Matthew mcconaughey Hayes character in dazed and

839
00:47:42.851 --> 00:47:44.830
confused.
Remember that guy?

840
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.560
The 26 year old guy's still hanging out at high school.

841
00:47:47.561 --> 00:47:50.590
Where in his fucking Letterman jacket asking where the parties are.

842
00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:52.000
That's what they are like.

843
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:57.750
They are a still the most successful NHL franchise in the history of hockey,

844
00:48:00.371 --> 00:48:04.120
but they have not dominated the league since pre Gretzky.

845
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:08.890
We'll talk in 1979 we're talking Jimmy Carter in office.
Alright.

846
00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:10.660
We're talking about the,

847
00:48:10.661 --> 00:48:15.520
the AMC Pacer being a viable option for a car or the future.

848
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:16.861
I know,

849
00:48:16.861 --> 00:48:21.861
I just realized because I drive a Prius that I bet if me live my was my age in

850
00:48:22.001 --> 00:48:24.610
1979,
I would have bought it.
I would've bought a pacer.

851
00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:29.410
I really just learned that about myself.
It makes me feel bad.
So anyways,
um,

852
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.640
just to give you a little bit of history between the Bruins and the Canadians.

853
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:37.360
The Canadians kicked the shit out of the Bruins for a good 50 fucking years.

854
00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:39.790
Alright.
Dominated the league.

855
00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.360
We met him in the finals seven times and we never beat him.

856
00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:48.400
And every time we went up to the,
to the Montreal forum,
they always beat us.

857
00:48:48.401 --> 00:48:50.980
And it was like this Hex,
we just couldn't beat it.
Right.

858
00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.950
And this is the weirdest jinx in sports

859
00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:58.080
because in 1987,

860
00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:01.620
88 we finally went up to the Montreal forum.

861
00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:05.040
We finally had a better fucking team.
Well,

862
00:49:05.041 --> 00:49:06.900
a couple of times we had a better team,
but we would still lose.

863
00:49:06.901 --> 00:49:10.560
But we finally had a better team and we fucking feed them.
Right?

864
00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:15.930
It's over.
The fucking Hex is over.
Oh,
thank God.

865
00:49:15.931 --> 00:49:17.880
Right?
Just for,
for better measure.

866
00:49:17.881 --> 00:49:21.150
Two years later we beat them again in the fucking playoffs,

867
00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:25.330
you know,
and then over the next 20 years,

868
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.150
we pretty much went tit for tat and the playoffs.

869
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:28.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

870
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:31.730
<v 7>Play offs.
And two years ago,</v>

871
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:37.030
we beat Montreal every fucking game in the regular season and then we swept them

872
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:43.070
in the playoffs,
the final two games in their own building.

873
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.780
Okay.

874
00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:49.780
But for some fucking reason they still always talk about this fucking Hex,

875
00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:55.100
like it's still going on.
I for the life of me,

876
00:49:55.101 --> 00:49:59.840
could somebody hockey fan please fucking explain it and don't even say it's

877
00:49:59.841 --> 00:50:01.550
because the Bruins having won a cup,

878
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:05.810
because we did during that 50 year fucking drought,

879
00:50:05.811 --> 00:50:08.270
we won in [inaudible] 70 and we wanted 72

880
00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.990
that would be like if the red sox won it in [inaudible] 70 and [inaudible] 72

881
00:50:12.991 --> 00:50:14.940
when you're still talking about the curse of the babe,

882
00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:17.040
I don't know what this fucking curse is.

883
00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:21.060
Is it because we haven't beaten them in the finals ever?
We can't.

884
00:50:21.061 --> 00:50:24.960
They realigned the divisions.
We've played them in the playoffs.

885
00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:29.930
We've beaten since 87 we're pretty much 50 50 against them.

886
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:32.480
I don't fucking understand.

887
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:37.340
I understand it when Dan Shaughnessy says something because Dan Shaughnessy like

888
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:41.480
if an old 80 like an 80 year old woman became a sports writer,

889
00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:45.530
she would be Dan Shaughnessy because Dan Shaughnessy never talks about the game.

890
00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:50.560
Dan Shaughnessy loves ghosts and Goblins and fucking urban myth.

891
00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:55.700
He's everything about the fucking game.
He will talk about all of it.

892
00:50:55.701 --> 00:51:00.460
Like he doesn't know shit about hockey.
Okay?
All right.
As he asked,

893
00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:05.000
actually called for the end of the winter classic this week,

894
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:08.720
he said,
you know,
it's time to retire the winter classic.
This is,
this is,

895
00:51:08.721 --> 00:51:10.100
this is what a more on this guys.

896
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:14.720
He talks about how the first fucking three years were awesome and how he stood

897
00:51:14.721 --> 00:51:19.070
next to Bobby.
Your arguably the greatest player of all time,
you know,

898
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:24.030
if not top two,
if not top three,
if you're a cunt,
you know,

899
00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:30.060
the fucking arguably greatest player of all time stands next to Dan Shaughnessy

900
00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:33.660
when the,
the winter classic was at Fenway Park and he says to Shaughnessy,

901
00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:38.310
this is what real hockey is.
This is what it is.
This is it,
this is,
this is it.

902
00:51:38.311 --> 00:51:42.450
And it's,
it's,
it's most pure form.
This is how we all learned how to play.

903
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.540
All right?
And then this year,
just because you know,

904
00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:47.760
one year that you're going to have bad weather,

905
00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:50.970
it was kind of raining out in the ice,
wasn't good.

906
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:54.420
Shaughnessy says that they should cancel it.

907
00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:01.920
He's such a fucking retard.
It's like Dan,

908
00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:07.750
those first three years,
that's pond hockey in the middle of the winter.

909
00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:12.400
What you saw in Pittsburgh is pond hockey at the beginning and the end of the

910
00:52:12.401 --> 00:52:16.750
pond hockey season.
All right,
if you have a fucking played in,
in your life,

911
00:52:16.751 --> 00:52:17.680
your dumb ass.

912
00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:22.390
The second I saw that Pittsburgh Washington game and I saw the ice surface with

913
00:52:22.391 --> 00:52:26.890
those puddles,
I immediately was taken back to my youth during the,
you know,

914
00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:30.310
just to be getting when it was just cold enough to play hockey or you will come

915
00:52:30.311 --> 00:52:31.870
into spring and what would you do?

916
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:34.690
You take big rock should throw them up in the fucking air,

917
00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:38.590
see if they would go through the ice and then you'd send the fattest fucker.

918
00:52:38.591 --> 00:52:42.640
You've added all your friends to walk out on the ice.
And if he didn't drown,

919
00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:47.140
game on,
you'd go out there and you would skate,

920
00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:49.720
you know,
and if you started losing,

921
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:52.570
you try to trip one of your friends into the big puddle,

922
00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:57.730
so whatever.
So anyways,
so I want to know seriously,
okay,

923
00:52:57.731 --> 00:53:01.330
now Montreal Canadien fans.
I'm not disrespecting you guys,
you guys,
you know,

924
00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:05.560
other than the New York Yankees,
uh,
you're,
you're the most success.

925
00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:08.150
You have the most championships.
All right?

926
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:13.160
And if I had to rate franchises,

927
00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:17.750
I would say Yankees,
Lakers,

928
00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:21.740
uh,
Canadians and then Celtics.

929
00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:25.190
And I know a lot of Boston fans aren't going to like that,
but this,
this is why.

930
00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:29.100
All right.
Yankees cause they got the most and they've won in every era.

931
00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:30.810
Then I would go,

932
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:36.080
I would say I would go Lakers just because they've won 10 championships in the

933
00:53:38.391 --> 00:53:42.740
last 30 years,
that know Canadians haven't,
Yankees haven't,
I mean,

934
00:53:42.741 --> 00:53:47.630
that's fucking unheard of in the modern era with free agency.
Uh,

935
00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:50.720
that,
that's,
that's fucking insane.
Um,
well,

936
00:53:50.721 --> 00:53:53.450
so I guess I would put that maybe I would say,
okay,

937
00:53:53.451 --> 00:53:55.190
well I don't know where to put the Lakers.
How about that?

938
00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:59.150
I will put the Lakers is the best franchise at the last fucking 30 years without

939
00:53:59.151 --> 00:54:00.860
a doubt.
Um,

940
00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:02.210
<v 0>okay.</v>

941
00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:04.910
<v 7>And I can't remember what the fuck I said about the rest of the shit.
All right.</v>

942
00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:09.200
But I don't understand like what exactly has to happen?

943
00:54:09.201 --> 00:54:12.770
How many fucking times to the Bruins have to beat the Canadians and the fucking

944
00:54:12.771 --> 00:54:17.440
playoffs?
I don't get it.
And we've won.

945
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:22.630
We won two Stanley cups during.
I just,
I don't get it.

946
00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:23.830
I absolutely,

947
00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:28.970
I do not fucking understand why every time I watch the Canadians Bruins,

948
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:36.100
they have to bring up something that ended that fucking ended.

949
00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.520
Jesus Christ.
Oh,
almost a quarter of,
a century ago.

950
00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:44.880
The Canadians have not dominated the Bruins for any significant amount of time

951
00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:51.400
since,
uh,
86 pre eight,
1986.

952
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:55.690
I Dunno if I got the Canadian feed.
I have no idea what,

953
00:54:55.691 --> 00:54:58.960
but that is the most overrated fucking thing I've ever heard.

954
00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:01.690
Overrated fucking thing I've ever heard.

955
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:06.010
And anytime the Canadians when like they did,
came back and won there,

956
00:55:06.011 --> 00:55:10.490
there'll be,
like you say,
you see and,
but they'll,
they,

957
00:55:10.491 --> 00:55:15.100
they'll ignore the fact that we swept them for a whole year and in the playoffs,

958
00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:19.210
the final two games in their own fucking building.
You know,

959
00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:24.760
how come the Red Sox,
how come their thing ended?
I don't,
I don't get it.

960
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:26.260
No,
other than w shouldn't,
shouldn't that,

961
00:55:26.261 --> 00:55:28.840
that thing of continued the whole fucking thing doesn't make sense.

962
00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:32.820
And it's just this classic a thing is a Boston sports fan,
which I'm,

963
00:55:32.821 --> 00:55:36.880
I'm so fucking sick of is I can't stand,
first of all,

964
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:38.950
I don't believe in curses.

965
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:44.910
That whole Dan Shaughnessy old fucking lady thing where it's such a pussy way of

966
00:55:45.521 --> 00:55:48.310
looking things where you literally take your hand off the wheel,

967
00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:52.660
you have no control of your destiny because there's a Goddamn Gremlin under your

968
00:55:52.661 --> 00:55:56.170
bed.
It's like,
isn't it really that aside,

969
00:55:56.171 --> 00:55:59.710
in fact that Montreal was a tremendous fucking franchise back in the day.

970
00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:04.230
All right.
As tremendous as they were,

971
00:56:04.231 --> 00:56:08.580
the Bruins were horrific,
wasn't it?
That,
Eh,
you know,

972
00:56:08.581 --> 00:56:13.581
Harry Sinden didn't embrace free agency and he resented fucking resented the

973
00:56:15.211 --> 00:56:20.211
fact that players were now in control and he absolutely categorically fucking

974
00:56:20.731 --> 00:56:25.360
refused to pay top dollar whether they were worth it or not.

975
00:56:25.361 --> 00:56:25.991
Wasn't that,

976
00:56:25.991 --> 00:56:30.580
wasn't that more likely than that?

977
00:56:30.581 --> 00:56:34.450
There was some sort of fucking ghost floating around a fucking hockey arena.

978
00:56:34.451 --> 00:56:38.320
I don't know.
I don't know.
So whatever.
So for the 900 fucking years in a row,

979
00:56:38.321 --> 00:56:39.970
I got to watch a Bruins Canadians game.

980
00:56:39.971 --> 00:56:44.290
And despite the fact that the Montreal Canadians are not a factor in the NHL

981
00:56:44.291 --> 00:56:46.300
anymore,
they're in first place now.
But you know what I mean?

982
00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:51.390
That they're not an elite franchise anymore.
They're just not.

983
00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:56.040
And they haven't been.
Okay.
They haven't won a fucking cup since 93 it's over.

984
00:56:56.790 --> 00:57:01.340
It's over.
Okay.
It's fucking over.

985
00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:09.360
I mean,
I,
I don't,
I don't know.
I mean,
as a Celtics Fan,
I admit that it did.

986
00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:13.630
It's,
it's over.
It,
it died when Len bias died with Len bias died.

987
00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:18.310
It was fucking over and it hasn't come back just because we won one since then.

988
00:57:18.311 --> 00:57:21.640
It hasn't come.
It's fucking over,
you know,
speaking of which,

989
00:57:21.641 --> 00:57:24.100
I've actually started to watch a lot of hoop,
and I gotta tell you something.

990
00:57:24.101 --> 00:57:25.840
When the fucking Boston Celtics,

991
00:57:25.841 --> 00:57:30.820
I've never seen so many goddamn ace bandages in knee pads in my entire fucking

992
00:57:30.821 --> 00:57:35.260
life.
I think they have the oldest legs in the NFL and the NBA,

993
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:39.160
every one of them is tape from the ankles up to their hips.
I don't think,

994
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:44.200
I really just don't see them winning it this year.
I don't,
I think that,

995
00:57:44.201 --> 00:57:48.580
uh,
I think Miami Heat's going to do it.
I actually think they're going to do it.

996
00:57:48.581 --> 00:57:51.940
They're,
they're,
they're,
they're much younger.
The fucking,

997
00:57:51.941 --> 00:57:55.220
everybody's dressed like Marcus Haynes on the Goddamn Celtics.

998
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:59.290
Now he is an old reference for you.
Huh?
Markus Hanes.
Look it up.
People,

999
00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:04.540
he was a,
the,
the,
the magical fucking a,
the guy in the globe trotters

1000
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:06.870
<v 8>Boobie,
Boobie,
Boobie,
boobie.</v>

1001
00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:09.370
<v 7>Right.
And each slide around on the floor.</v>

1002
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.240
You know what black people bitch about fucking Hollywood and that type of shit.

1003
00:58:15.241 --> 00:58:17.040
Don't we do the white people,
you know,
for the,

1004
00:58:17.041 --> 00:58:22.041
the stereotypes and the awful roles which they've been given for decades in

1005
00:58:22.561 --> 00:58:23.610
Hollywood,
you know,

1006
00:58:23.611 --> 00:58:28.611
to white people get any sort of credit for being on the Washington generals and

1007
00:58:28.831 --> 00:58:30.720
just being absolute stooges.

1008
00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:38.720
You know what I mean?
Just going out there,
paid to lose,

1009
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:42.470
paid to fall for the same fucking trick every goddamn night.

1010
00:58:42.471 --> 00:58:46.250
Just looking like absolute fucking buffoons.
Do we get any sort of a credit?

1011
00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:51.500
Can Can Spike Lee make a tragic film about white people who had played in the

1012
00:58:51.501 --> 00:58:54.740
Washington generals?
Anybody?
Can anybody back when we back me on that one?

1013
00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:58.920
Back me up people.
What's the deal?
Um,

1014
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:04.310
how far did this fucking podcast down?
My 20 God damn minutes.
Alright,

1015
00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:08.260
so what is there to talk about you guys?
Uh,

1016
00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:10.420
what do you guys want to talk about?

1017
00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:13.880
I sound like a headline or right now who is run out of jokes and he's done an

1018
00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:15.500
hours worth of material in 20 minutes.

1019
00:59:15.501 --> 00:59:19.460
So now he's just going to try to fucking play with the crowd,

1020
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:23.270
which I can't do because not here.
So why don't we read this,
uh,

1021
00:59:23.271 --> 00:59:28.150
this email under the provocative name corporate bullshit.
Uh,

1022
00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:28.760
Bill,
uh,

1023
00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:33.760
dear bill recently I had to return some items at the mall.

1024
00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:37.960
Uh,
it was the day after Christmas and I was with a girl.
I was dating,
uh,

1025
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:41.120
with the girl that I was dating.
She wants to return some shoes.

1026
00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:44.990
So we went to the journey store with his shoes were bought.

1027
00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:48.890
Uh,
when she got to the counter to return the shoes,

1028
00:59:48.891 --> 00:59:53.030
the girl behind the counter asked her for her name,
address,
email,

1029
00:59:53.031 --> 00:59:54.260
and phone number.

1030
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.630
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1031
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:59.050
<v 7>Oh my God.
The amount of fucking people who actually give out that information.</v>

1032
00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:03.760
My girlfriend just gave the information over.
As soon as the girl asked for it,

1033
01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:07.480
we were leaving the store.
I remarked that I thought it was bullshit,

1034
01:00:07.481 --> 01:00:10.510
that she had to give away personal information to return a pair of shoes.

1035
01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:15.430
She said,
uh,
it was not a big deal,
but I didn't like it.

1036
01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.300
All right.

1037
01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:20.620
Why the fuck would you give somebody all that information and just in case

1038
01:00:20.621 --> 01:00:23.890
you're new to my podcast,
just say you can say no,

1039
01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:28.570
can I,
you know I,
I go out to buy shit all the time.
Can I have your phone number?

1040
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:33.650
No,
I don't even say,
I don't even try to make it nice.

1041
01:00:33.651 --> 01:00:38.150
I just say no and then they go,
oh,
okay.
You know,

1042
01:00:38.151 --> 01:00:40.160
why do you feel like you got to give them their information?

1043
01:00:40.161 --> 01:00:43.160
You're trying to buy something.
I'm sorry I can't,

1044
01:00:43.161 --> 01:00:46.640
I can't show you this unless I get your information.
Well they go fuck yourself.

1045
01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:52.430
Abide somewhere else.
I don't even need it.
Anyways.
So anyways,

1046
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:57.020
he goes,
next we go to American Eagle.
You guys hit all the hot spot,
Huh?

1047
01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.820
Then we went to Cinnabon.

1048
01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.290
Next we went to American Eagle where I had to return a shirt.
That was a gift.

1049
01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:05.060
It was a long line for returns.

1050
01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:10.070
Why'd you return the shirt and did it not fit or was it ugly as hell or was it

1051
01:01:10.071 --> 01:01:12.110
both?
As I was waiting in line,

1052
01:01:12.111 --> 01:01:15.650
one of the employees comes up to me with a clipboard with the little form to

1053
01:01:15.651 --> 01:01:19.640
fill out.
Now is anybody else kind of getting the prison camp vibe here?

1054
01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:21.193
You know,

1055
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:24.920
they're standing in line to get processed and there's a guy coming up onto the

1056
01:01:24.921 --> 01:01:29.000
VAT.
Is Your name please?
Your phone number?
Uh,

1057
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:30.770
I stopped the employee.
Uh,

1058
01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:35.860
I stopped the employee and asked her why she needed this information and she

1059
01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:40.760
says that it was to verify my purchase.
How fucking dumb our people.

1060
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:45.110
You're going to verify my purchase.
Well,
here's the sale slips there,
sweetheart.

1061
01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:50.140
This verifies it.
That's it.

1062
01:01:50.530 --> 01:01:52.900
I don't know what to tell you.
Why don't you and your clipboard?

1063
01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:56.050
Why don't you hold that clipboard between your little fucking beef curtains and

1064
01:01:56.051 --> 01:01:59.200
take a fucking walk down the street.
How about that?
How sweetheart,
it's there.

1065
01:01:59.201 --> 01:02:03.170
There's the reasons you use that type of language.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Huh?

1066
01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:08.820
How about I fucking grabbed that ponytail and just,
no,
let's,
let's,
let's let,
let,

1067
01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:11.480
let's keep it clean this week,
shall we?
People anyways,
she,

1068
01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:13.720
he goes before I could protest further.

1069
01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.690
She said that I could just put my name on it.

1070
01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.000
Oh,
on

1071
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.480
<v 0>the clipboard.
Okay.</v>

1072
01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.970
<v 7>When she walked away,
I pulled out the gift receipt Ppas said to my girlfriend,</v>

1073
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:29.090
oh,
here it is.
Yeah.
This is what verifies my purchase.
Exactly.

1074
01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:34.310
The clipboard employee wasn't as far as way as I thought she was in.

1075
01:02:34.311 --> 01:02:37.280
Heard me say,
did I read that wrong?

1076
01:02:37.281 --> 01:02:39.770
Get heard me say it's heard me say this.

1077
01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.330
And she began to explain further why I needed to give over the information.

1078
01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.710
This is the part of the email I hate.
He goes,
I apologized and told her.

1079
01:02:48.711 --> 01:02:52.850
I realized it wasn't her and that it was just her company's policy that she was

1080
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:57.110
enforcing.
She walked away again.
I felt bad.
So the next time I saw her,

1081
01:02:57.111 --> 01:02:59.900
I apologize and said,
I realized that she was just doing her job,

1082
01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:00.734
but she ignored me.

1083
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:04.190
She was probably pissed because it was the day after Christmas and I was causing

1084
01:03:04.191 --> 01:03:08.610
your grief,
but you could at least accept my apology.
You Bitch.
Um,

1085
01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:12.710
I love how you go from being totally liberal and seeing somebody fucking side of

1086
01:03:12.711 --> 01:03:16.490
it too,
being yeah,
man up,
you can't.
Um,
anyway,

1087
01:03:16.491 --> 01:03:19.850
I got up to the counter and there wasn't any further problems.

1088
01:03:19.851 --> 01:03:23.300
The guy at the register just took my name and didn't ask me for anything.

1089
01:03:23.301 --> 01:03:26.570
I felt as though I had a small victory against the big corporations.

1090
01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:30.470
Then this week I had to go back to the store to return a hat my girlfriend got.

1091
01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:35.180
Did you guys not make Christmas lists or all your relatives blind?

1092
01:03:35.181 --> 01:03:38.270
The seems to be a lot of,
uh,
returning of gifts.

1093
01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:43.530
This is hilarious.
You're returning a hat that your girlfriend got.
You Dude.

1094
01:03:43.531 --> 01:03:47.820
How horrific was that hat?
Can you please send me a picture of it before I,

1095
01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.530
if you took one before you returned it?

1096
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:51.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1097
01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.720
<v 7>Picture one of those,
uh,
plaid Charlie Chaplin Hat.
Um,
I had the receipt,</v>

1098
01:03:55.721 --> 01:03:59.650
but again,
the girl at the register asked me for my address and phone number.

1099
01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.720
I said,
I didn't want to give that information to her.

1100
01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:06.100
Immediately panic sets in and her face and she says that I have to.

1101
01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.630
I said that I didn't have to the day after Christmas and I wasn't going to now,

1102
01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:11.493
good for you.

1103
01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:16.390
She calls over a coworker and they both get defensive and hold to the idea that

1104
01:04:16.391 --> 01:04:20.230
I have to give over my information in order to return a stupid hat.

1105
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:24.460
Even though I had my receipt,
I asked why and they let me slide.

1106
01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:27.730
Why did the let me slide on this before and they maintained that I had,

1107
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:30.340
I had to give them my name,
address and phone number,

1108
01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.490
so what did I do in the face of corporate opposition?

1109
01:04:35.491 --> 01:04:39.600
I caved and I gave it to him.
You Fuck Pussy?

1110
01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:42.190
<v 0>Okay,</v>

1111
01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:45.370
<v 7>dupe.
The second you saw the panic on their face,</v>

1112
01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:50.860
you knew that they were going to lose.
All right.
He goes,

1113
01:04:50.861 --> 01:04:54.760
I just don't get it,
Bill.
Why is a receipt not enough?
Nowadays it is enough.

1114
01:04:55.450 --> 01:04:59.230
They say they need our personal information to verify purchase then not,
dude,

1115
01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:03.880
they're not.
All right.
All of that shit.

1116
01:05:03.881 --> 01:05:07.610
All those little save,
you know you want to get when our discount store,

1117
01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:12.340
they're creating a file on you.
They figure out what you want to buy,

1118
01:05:12.341 --> 01:05:13.720
what they can market towards you,

1119
01:05:13.721 --> 01:05:17.590
and then they take that information and they sell it to other fucking companies.

1120
01:05:17.591 --> 01:05:20.500
Even though they say they're not going to,
they sell your information,

1121
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:22.600
your information gets up on the Internet.

1122
01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:26.500
And that's why there's all these creepy websites out there right now that have

1123
01:05:26.501 --> 01:05:29.110
all this fucking information about you,
about,
you know,

1124
01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.500
how many siblings you have,
your brothers and sisters names.

1125
01:05:32.501 --> 01:05:35.500
They all use that information to fucking,
it's,
I'm telling you,

1126
01:05:37.030 --> 01:05:37.650
<v 0>okay,</v>

1127
01:05:37.650 --> 01:05:40.170
<v 7>this don't give him your information.</v>

1128
01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:44.730
You don't have to give him your information and people out there

1129
01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:50.530
who just have this fucking attitude towards these corporations just sitting

1130
01:05:50.531 --> 01:05:53.200
there going like,
wait,
you know what we do?
What do they get?

1131
01:05:53.201 --> 01:05:55.180
You mean as long as you're not doing anything wrong?
I mean,

1132
01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.700
what do I care if they know where I live?

1133
01:05:57.790 --> 01:06:00.950
What do I keep this fucking morons?

1134
01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:03.550
I don't even,

1135
01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:07.030
I have explained this shit till I'm blue in the face and then I always get these

1136
01:06:07.031 --> 01:06:11.830
emails from these people.
Um,
he just,
I don't know.

1137
01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:15.150
I don't know.
I can't,
if I said something the other day,
you know,
I sit there,

1138
01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.100
listen to,
I was sitting there,
I was listening to a sports radio,
you know,

1139
01:06:18.101 --> 01:06:22.570
cause I'm a deep thinker,
right.
And uh,
this,

1140
01:06:22.571 --> 01:06:27.571
this new guy got on sports radio out here in Los Angeles and you know,

1141
01:06:29.590 --> 01:06:33.750
he does what most people do when they have nothing to say,
which is they,

1142
01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:38.210
they just start,
they just go over the top arrogant.

1143
01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:41.660
You know what I mean?
Like he was talking about how he wanted to get some,

1144
01:06:41.661 --> 01:06:45.590
some sort of sports culture personality on the show,

1145
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:48.830
but he doubted he could get them as a guest because the guest hated him.

1146
01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:52.490
And he goes,
you know,
cause I disagreed with them on some,

1147
01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:56.090
he talking to a coach and he was actually disagreeing with the,

1148
01:06:56.091 --> 01:06:59.330
with the fucking coach.
He's disagreeing with the guy and he goes,

1149
01:06:59.331 --> 01:07:01.250
you know what the problem is?
You know,
he goes,
look,
I'm,

1150
01:07:01.251 --> 01:07:02.990
I'm just like such a good debater.

1151
01:07:02.991 --> 01:07:06.140
I actually ended up like convincing myself of my own opinion.

1152
01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:10.220
You actually said that over the airwaves and I just sort of muttered to myself

1153
01:07:10.221 --> 01:07:14.780
that the confidence of morons is staggering.

1154
01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:20.340
You know what I mean?
Morons think they know everything.
That's,

1155
01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:25.270
that's what makes them fucking morons.
And like the emails,

1156
01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:30.040
like get with people who don't question this shit.
Um,

1157
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:32.560
which is,
I don't know,
like last week when I went,

1158
01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:34.120
I went off on my little fucking rant there.

1159
01:07:34.121 --> 01:07:38.810
Just some of the fucking emails I get,
it's like people are sending me shit.

1160
01:07:38.811 --> 01:07:41.960
That kinda is backing up what I'm saying and then telling me that it sound like

1161
01:07:41.961 --> 01:07:43.910
I have tin foil on my fucking head,

1162
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:47.330
which obviously I am out of my fucking mind on some level,

1163
01:07:47.331 --> 01:07:51.440
but I'm not out of my mind when I don't trust corporations and I don't trust

1164
01:07:51.441 --> 01:07:55.220
them when they say we're not going to do anything with this information.

1165
01:07:55.221 --> 01:07:58.670
The other day I was in cvs and I go to buy something and the lady asked me,

1166
01:07:58.671 --> 01:08:03.590
did I have a safe card?
And I said,
no.
She said,
do you want one?
And I said,

1167
01:08:03.591 --> 01:08:06.830
no.
And she goes,
well,
that's okay.
I'll just,

1168
01:08:06.831 --> 01:08:10.940
and she swiped the fucking thing anyways.
And I was like,
lady,

1169
01:08:10.941 --> 01:08:14.930
what did I just say to you now?
See if I use my credit card,
they'd have my,

1170
01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:16.930
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1171
01:08:16.930 --> 01:08:20.320
<v 7>and then to match up to that fucking number and what the hell I just bought.</v>

1172
01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:24.640
And just a little bit more information about me and my question to all you

1173
01:08:24.641 --> 01:08:29.350
people who have these,
this faith
in these corporations,

1174
01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.660
why does that person do that?

1175
01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:36.870
Why are they so hell bent on trying to make that corporation less money in that

1176
01:08:38.081 --> 01:08:42.510
moment?
They give me this card,
you know,

1177
01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:47.250
like everybody has those cards so you're not saving any fucking money.
It's just,

1178
01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:52.260
it's a big fucking shell game to make it seem,
oh look,
you're saving money.

1179
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:53.520
What they're really doing.

1180
01:08:53.521 --> 01:08:57.060
Did I look at this hand over here is you're giving them all your personal

1181
01:08:57.061 --> 01:09:02.061
fucking information that they can then use to at the very least sell to other

1182
01:09:03.181 --> 01:09:07.350
corporations to increase junk mail and it also to a limit.

1183
01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.870
You're fucking level of privacy.

1184
01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:13.020
The fact that they can put all that shit up in the Goddamn Internet.

1185
01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:17.550
People have been sending me these random websites where they have like your name

1186
01:09:17.551 --> 01:09:22.500
and your address,
where you fucking live and all this type of shit.
It's like,

1187
01:09:22.530 --> 01:09:24.690
how do you think that they get all that information?

1188
01:09:26.730 --> 01:09:29.970
Do you think there's somebody sitting there with the phone book and just typing

1189
01:09:29.971 --> 01:09:33.830
all of this shit in?
I don't know.
I'll fuck it though.

1190
01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:40.320
If some,
what's what's what kills me.
If some fucking random creepy guy,

1191
01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:45.210
you know you're standing there waiting for the subway came up to you,

1192
01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:49.800
asks you what's your name,
your phone number and your address was,

1193
01:09:49.801 --> 01:09:53.760
would you give it to them?
No,

1194
01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:58.380
but for some reason you're inside of a fucking store and there's socks and

1195
01:09:58.381 --> 01:10:02.420
sweaters and somebody has a name tag.
Now all of a sudden you,
you,

1196
01:10:02.421 --> 01:10:06.870
you give them total fucking trust.
You're writing your mind.
So sir,

1197
01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:11.900
don't cave in.
All right,
all you get,
you just,

1198
01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:16.280
just say that's unacceptable.
That's unacceptable.

1199
01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:21.350
I want to speak to the manager what they're doing.
It's not legal yet.

1200
01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:22.850
It's not legal yet,

1201
01:10:22.851 --> 01:10:27.851
but I can guarantee you there's somebody lobbying for it that in Washington

1202
01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:30.710
there's some sort of fucking high powered lobbying group.

1203
01:10:30.711 --> 01:10:34.130
I swear to God is probably lobbying that from here on out.

1204
01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:37.970
We need to have a law that if you're going to return a hat,

1205
01:10:37.971 --> 01:10:41.270
you have to give us your name,
your address,
and your social security number.

1206
01:10:41.271 --> 01:10:45.650
Just so there's not another nine 11 could guaran fucking tee it.

1207
01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:47.780
So yeah,
you don't have to.

1208
01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:53.810
That's actually one of the highlights of my day.
What I do now is when they say,

1209
01:10:53.811 --> 01:10:58.130
do you have our little savy save card?
And I say,
no I don't.
Would you like one?

1210
01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:01.670
No,
I don't.
I then say,
and please don't swipe another one.

1211
01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:07.120
You know,
and then I tried to pay with cash.
I love cash.

1212
01:11:07.121 --> 01:11:08.800
Cash is fucking anonymous.

1213
01:11:09.790 --> 01:11:12.640
All you guys out there who was sitting there watching these commercials where

1214
01:11:12.641 --> 01:11:17.460
they make look like credit cards are so fucking easy.
You,
you're,

1215
01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:18.360
you're idiots.

1216
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:22.710
If you're buying into exactly what they want you to buy into,

1217
01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:27.300
which is a cashless society so they can keep track of where you are at all

1218
01:11:27.301 --> 01:11:32.130
fucking times and every last fucking dime that you make so they can get their

1219
01:11:32.131 --> 01:11:33.960
greedy little fucking hands on it.

1220
01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:39.000
You're out of your mind and you're giving up an unbelievable amount of fucking

1221
01:11:39.001 --> 01:11:43.650
privacy by creating a paper trail.
Everywhere you go,

1222
01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:48.630
everywhere you go,
what you're doing,
where you're at,
you know,

1223
01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:51.970
and the Sea of morons who we're going to sit there and go,
Whoa,

1224
01:11:51.971 --> 01:11:54.180
have you doing anything wrong?

1225
01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:59.340
I mean,
I guess maybe,
maybe I'm a paranoid psycho.

1226
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.880
You look at all these fucking idiots who do reality TV's and [inaudible] and

1227
01:12:02.881 --> 01:12:06.420
they let cameras come into their house and they don't seem to care about it.

1228
01:12:06.421 --> 01:12:07.254
Maybe,
uh,

1229
01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:12.240
maybe the average jackass doesn't give a ship at Sir for the love of God.

1230
01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:17.730
You know,
in the end he says,
I'm not crying conspiracy.

1231
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:22.470
It's very plain to see what they're doing.
It's not malicious or evil.
Yes it is.

1232
01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.920
It is malicious and it is evil and it is a conspiracy.

1233
01:12:25.921 --> 01:12:29.130
They're conspiring to get everybody's information.

1234
01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:31.050
Find out what they buy,

1235
01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:34.680
and they're lying to you saying that they're not going to share the information.

1236
01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.570
It's everything that you're saying.
It's not.
It is a right and that's it.

1237
01:12:39.571 --> 01:12:41.790
That's two weeks in a row.
I'm on the soapbox.
See people,

1238
01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.190
don't you like it better when I talk about sports.

1239
01:12:46.410 --> 01:12:51.210
Um,
anyways,
let's talk about football this week.

1240
01:12:51.211 --> 01:12:54.390
You're going to hear me say something this week that I've never said before ever

1241
01:12:54.391 --> 01:12:58.860
on a podcast.
I feel bad for Peyton manning.

1242
01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:04.200
Peyton manning got fucked this week by his own Goddamn coaching staff.

1243
01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.850
Um,
he played a great God damn game when they needed a score,

1244
01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:13.020
he drove him right down the fucking field.
If that bomb caught that ball,

1245
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:17.910
they were right in there.
And even still,
and by the way,
Anna,
Vinod Terry,

1246
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.190
it's a shame that jets one the God damn game because that guy is the most money

1247
01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:25.650
kicker of all time.

1248
01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:28.650
I was actually joking with my buddy when I was watching the game.
Um,

1249
01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:33.710
I was saying that the most pussy ever gotten by a professional kicker has to be

1250
01:13:34.891 --> 01:13:38.790
Adam for Adam voluntary.
It's gotta be,
it's gotta be,

1251
01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:43.410
and I actually learned that there's no kicker in the NFL hall of fame and

1252
01:13:43.411 --> 01:13:47.700
there's no fucking way.
It's just a shame not cause I even that I hate the jets.

1253
01:13:47.701 --> 01:13:50.700
It's not,
it's a shame that the jets one that fucking game because

1254
01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:53.220
it,

1255
01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:57.810
people are going to forget that he actually hit that fucking 50 yard a man write

1256
01:13:57.811 --> 01:14:02.370
down the fucking middle,
right down the middle.

1257
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:05.620
But,
uh,
I,

1258
01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:09.000
I was right there with Peyton manning when he was,

1259
01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:14.120
had his hands out when called when the fucking cults called Timeout with 29

1260
01:14:17.291 --> 01:14:21.790
seconds to go.
Can somebody explain why the fuck they did that?

1261
01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:25.630
And don't even say,
well dude point to relate to Jake,

1262
01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:26.950
we're going to kick a field goal.

1263
01:14:26.951 --> 01:14:31.540
And they wanted to make sure that what they'd have 17 seconds to get down the

1264
01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:35.290
fucking field.
There wasn't gonna be enough time.

1265
01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:40.260
There wasn't going to be enough time.
You add a second year quarterback who had,

1266
01:14:40.261 --> 01:14:43.840
who,
who fucking had that deer in the headlights look,

1267
01:14:44.710 --> 01:14:48.670
he was overthrown all his fucking receivers.
You take a timeout,

1268
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:53.790
you give them a chance to gather himself for their coaches to give them the next

1269
01:14:53.951 --> 01:14:57.190
three plays so we can fucking relax.
And what comes to comes right out.

1270
01:14:57.191 --> 01:15:00.100
He hits a fucking 18 yard pass and that's the end of the game.

1271
01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:02.440
And when Peyton was sitting there with his hands out like,

1272
01:15:02.650 --> 01:15:06.730
what the fuck are we call a timeout for?
It was the one time I have,

1273
01:15:06.731 --> 01:15:10.060
I actually felt bad for that guy.
I just sat there and I've gone,

1274
01:15:10.061 --> 01:15:12.940
I think they are in the process of losing this fucking game.

1275
01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.880
Not It just giving the game away.
Um,

1276
01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:21.580
it was fucking brutal.
Absolutely brutal.
So there you go.

1277
01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:25.060
Peyton manning did not lose that game.
He fucking stepped it up.

1278
01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:29.860
He played a hell of a Goddamn game.
And I actually feel bad for the guy that he,

1279
01:15:29.861 --> 01:15:34.660
that he lost.
And if I'm going to be honest now that I think about it,
about five,

1280
01:15:34.661 --> 01:15:37.640
six years ago,
you know,

1281
01:15:37.641 --> 01:15:41.120
he drove his team down the field and their idiot kicker would talk shit about

1282
01:15:41.121 --> 01:15:44.330
Peyton choking in the playoffs.
He went on and he missed the fucking field goals.

1283
01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:48.560
So there's two years,
two losses.
I,
I won't,

1284
01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:51.050
I won't blame Peyton manning for all right.
There you go.

1285
01:15:51.051 --> 01:15:55.940
See that the could make trying to be a little more forgiving in a,

1286
01:15:55.941 --> 01:16:00.590
in this year.
And,
um,
and I realized this week too,

1287
01:16:00.591 --> 01:16:03.500
that I've been feeding into exactly what Rex Ryan wants,

1288
01:16:03.501 --> 01:16:08.040
which is people just talking about him.
Um,
you know,
what are the odds,

1289
01:16:08.041 --> 01:16:13.040
do you think he think he's going to say something outrageous this week?
Uh,

1290
01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:17.510
it's really like watching Madonna's career.
You know,
where you have a woman who,

1291
01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:18.500
uh,

1292
01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:23.500
has a mediocre voice and has made mediocre music for the last 30 fucking years.

1293
01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:27.310
Yet somehow,
eh,

1294
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:30.650
whenever she wants to be as in the news.
And you know why?

1295
01:16:30.651 --> 01:16:34.280
Because she knows when to take her clam up.
All right?

1296
01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:39.770
She knows when to go on Letterman and say,

1297
01:16:39.771 --> 01:16:42.800
fuck 38 times during an interview.

1298
01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:47.780
You know when you really think about Madonna,
what does it have to do?
Oh Wow,

1299
01:16:47.781 --> 01:16:49.190
look how good shape she's in.

1300
01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:54.640
Did you see when she did the book and she fucking spread her legs yet?

1301
01:16:55.401 --> 01:16:58.820
Oh,
did you see when she said fuck on Letterman?
Did you see what she did?

1302
01:16:58.821 --> 01:17:03.821
The video and a fucking Jesus was black and then she kissed him.

1303
01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:08.260
Of course.
That's what you talk about.

1304
01:17:08.261 --> 01:17:11.690
What are you going to talk borderline so you're like,

1305
01:17:11.691 --> 01:17:14.450
I'm going to lose by by rarely,

1306
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:17.150
30 year career off of that horse shit.

1307
01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.960
What's his face is doing the same thing.

1308
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:23.870
He's doing the exact same fucking thing.

1309
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:28.520
Dropped a bunch of f bombs during hard knocks.

1310
01:17:28.521 --> 01:17:32.390
That was his Letterman episode.
All right.
He put a wig on.

1311
01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:34.700
That was him showing his clam

1312
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:41.360
and then then he made a controversial a video.

1313
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:44.960
Other than that he lost the division.

1314
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:50.900
Backed into the fucking playoffs.
Playoffs I,
yeah.
I don't know.

1315
01:17:50.901 --> 01:17:51.470
You know,

1316
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:54.440
you don't even realize this week I didn't even know what the name of the coach

1317
01:17:54.441 --> 01:17:59.150
was for the Atlanta Falcons.
I given this guy no hype whatsoever.

1318
01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:01.370
Mike Smith,
I had actually actually had the look it up.

1319
01:18:01.371 --> 01:18:05.690
This is a guy who went 13 and three who actually has,

1320
01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:10.900
has actually has a franchise quarterback and Matt Ryan,

1321
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:16.340
he actually has a franchise quarterback,
you know,

1322
01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:21.890
but it's not a New York.
So who gives a fuck,
right.
Um,

1323
01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:28.010
with that,
my predictions for the week,
um,
Berg Ravens,

1324
01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:32.450
I have no fucking idea.
Uh,
patriots jets,

1325
01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.930
I have no fucking idea,
but just for the simple fact,

1326
01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:39.950
I have no idea which defense to patriots are going to show up with.
You know,

1327
01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.210
I am not a guy if you realize that I'm not a guy who buys into hype,

1328
01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:48.900
that's why I've have not bought into rex Ryan for half a fucking second.
Uh,

1329
01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:53.070
that's why also when the Patriots won 45 to three,
I didn't go well there you go.

1330
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:56.250
Cause I realize we also lost 28 to 14.

1331
01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.040
I also know that we suck against the run.

1332
01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:04.050
So I think if we're going to win,
I'll tell you,
if I'm the Patriots,

1333
01:19:04.051 --> 01:19:07.330
I gotta be taken.
I got to stop Lt.
No,
seriously,
we,
if we,

1334
01:19:07.331 --> 01:19:12.180
if we can stop the run and,
uh,
go up by a good 10,

1335
01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:17.300
14 fucking points and put Sanchez into a situation where he feels like he has to

1336
01:19:18.811 --> 01:19:23.300
make a play,
uh,
we're going to be,
we're going to be,
eh,

1337
01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:27.540
we're going to be all right.
That's what we need to do.
That's what we need to do.

1338
01:19:27.541 --> 01:19:29.430
And I have faith that we're going to fucking do that.

1339
01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:32.960
I hope for the love of fucking God,
because if we don't,
uh,

1340
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:37.960
you're going to listen to the sounds of a blubbering jackass next week on this

1341
01:19:37.961 --> 01:19:42.370
fucking podcast.
Um,
and that is it.
So that's it.

1342
01:19:42.371 --> 01:19:46.450
I'm really hoping,
uh,
oh,
look at this.
Look at this.
I got some offers coming in.

1343
01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:50.670
I got some offers coming in.
Yeah.
We go where,

1344
01:19:50.671 --> 01:19:54.420
where am I going to be performing?
Oh,
by the way,
I'm actually in the process of,

1345
01:19:54.421 --> 01:19:57.240
uh,
of,
uh,

1346
01:19:57.270 --> 01:20:00.510
getting a Detroit and Milwaukee date.

1347
01:20:01.210 --> 01:20:05.100
I have not played in Detroit since I did the rich bitch tour way back in the day

1348
01:20:05.370 --> 01:20:10.370
with Charlie Murphy and a ashy Larry and I have not played Milwaukee ever.

1349
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:17.090
I know I did a college in that area because a long time ago I went to a bucks

1350
01:20:17.091 --> 01:20:19.220
game.
Um,

1351
01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:22.690
but what else do I got going on here?

1352
01:20:22.691 --> 01:20:26.690
Of course I don't get the fucking Internet here.
My bedroom,

1353
01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:31.450
the hell's wrong with me.
I'm stepping up my life in 2011 people.
Um,
all right,

1354
01:20:31.451 --> 01:20:35.350
let's go with youtube videos for the week.
All right.
Um,

1355
01:20:37.410 --> 01:20:38.041
oh,
here's something.

1356
01:20:38.041 --> 01:20:41.520
I've been watching a lot of basketball lately and Kareem Abdul Jabbar always

1357
01:20:41.521 --> 01:20:45.750
gets credit for inventing the Sky Hook.
And uh,

1358
01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:47.910
I always took that as law and I was just like,
yeah,

1359
01:20:47.911 --> 01:20:50.760
the guy invented the sky hook.
Wow.
People must have been like,
what the fuck?

1360
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:53.400
You know,
they went from the set shot to the,
you know,

1361
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:55.800
the way they traditionally shoot now with the one hand,

1362
01:20:55.801 --> 01:20:58.680
the other hand guide the ball and then he comes out with that shit.

1363
01:20:58.681 --> 01:21:01.230
People must have just been like,
where the fuck did that come from?

1364
01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:06.300
And then I was looking at some old Celtics video and that was sort of a shot

1365
01:21:06.301 --> 01:21:08.190
that people already took in the 60s,

1366
01:21:08.191 --> 01:21:12.060
but they did it from their hip and it was one of the gayest looking shots you're

1367
01:21:12.061 --> 01:21:14.910
ever going to see.
You just sort of jumped in the air,

1368
01:21:14.911 --> 01:21:18.000
had one leg up in the air bent at the knee.

1369
01:21:18.810 --> 01:21:22.680
Like I don't think that there's a physical way to do that shot without going.

1370
01:21:22.681 --> 01:21:26.280
We as you throw it,
but uh,

1371
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:29.040
he just saw he changed it where he didn't shoot it from the hip.

1372
01:21:29.041 --> 01:21:32.510
He just put it over his fucking head.
So there you go.
Um,

1373
01:21:32.850 --> 01:21:36.630
here's a nice conspiracy theory.
One from people in the,
I believe in Seattle,

1374
01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:38.400
you go to a Seahawks game,

1375
01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.350
they have a large beer and a small beer and the large beer is like a dollar 75

1376
01:21:43.351 --> 01:21:45.240
more if they come in two different glasses.

1377
01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:51.200
So somebody filled up a small glass with water and poured it into the large

1378
01:21:52.711 --> 01:21:56.720
glass in it,
filled it all the way up.
It was classic,
the small glasses,

1379
01:21:56.730 --> 01:21:59.220
a little fat one and the other one's nice and tall.

1380
01:21:59.221 --> 01:22:03.450
So you think you get more and you're not and they charge your next a dollar 25
a.

1381
01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:06.870
So we made a video of it.
Um,
what else?

1382
01:22:07.170 --> 01:22:10.920
What other videos do I have here?
Oh,
this is one from a new website.
Uh,

1383
01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:16.070
totally crap.
Totally crap.com.
They got a lot of good,

1384
01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:19.100
good videos and there's one there called five minute fight.

1385
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:23.720
All of these by the way will be up on the m M podcast.com.
Um,

1386
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.960
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1387
01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:28.130
<v 7>And what else?
Oh,
this one is a,</v>

1388
01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:32.310
a video also on a totally crap.com.

1389
01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:34.633
<v 0>Uh,</v>

1390
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:37.820
<v 7>and it's also an underrated and it says underrated ass whooping.</v>

1391
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:41.390
So many things would be salt if people would start their kids outright.

1392
01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:46.430
And the name of this video is old school ass whooping.
And uh,

1393
01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:50.660
I don't know how to describe this other than this father puts on a video camera.

1394
01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.470
He makes his kid telling me he's not going to be in a gang.

1395
01:22:54.710 --> 01:22:58.130
And he starts beating him with the belt and the kid tells his dad is not,

1396
01:22:58.131 --> 01:23:01.820
the gangs are bullshit.
He goes,
don't tell me,
tell it to the fucking camera.

1397
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:04.040
And he continues to beat his ass with a belt.

1398
01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:10.030
It's a sad,
it's funny.
It's everything you want it to be.

1399
01:23:10.031 --> 01:23:12.130
And then there's another video that I saw right after that.

1400
01:23:12.131 --> 01:23:17.020
It's five minute fight and this fight is fucking hilarious.

1401
01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:19.000
There's two white kids,

1402
01:23:19.001 --> 01:23:21.970
they're calling each other bitch and they're calling each other the n word.

1403
01:23:21.970 --> 01:23:23.050
And I swear to God,

1404
01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:28.470
they might both throw 700 punches and I think they miss 698 each.

1405
01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:32.470
It's the classic thing.
We got two people who want to fight.

1406
01:23:32.650 --> 01:23:36.940
They don't know how to fight.
And all they know is they want to punch the person,

1407
01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:39.670
other person in the face,
but they don't want to get hit in the face.

1408
01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:42.070
So they won't commit to coming inside.

1409
01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:45.460
And they just sort of punching the atmosphere around the other guy's head.

1410
01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:50.590
Or as I like to say,
uh,
an NBA basketball fight.
You ever watch?
Oh,

1411
01:23:50.591 --> 01:23:52.480
NBA basketball players fight for the most part.

1412
01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:55.690
They pull their head behind their shoulders and then they,

1413
01:23:55.691 --> 01:23:59.170
they throw punches like they're trying to throw a fucking baseball from the

1414
01:23:59.171 --> 01:24:02.950
outfield to home plate.
Um,
all right.

1415
01:24:02.951 --> 01:24:06.040
I'm just really just giving information this week.
I don't feel like I'm fucking,

1416
01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:12.340
Oh,
here we go.
Nope.
That was from last week.
Oh,

1417
01:24:12.341 --> 01:24:15.460
for Christ's sake.
You Cook the shit out of me.
Where the hell am I here?

1418
01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:20.980
What the fuck is my underrated overrated for the week?
Oh,
overrated.
Underrated.

1419
01:24:21.010 --> 01:24:24.130
Here we go.
Overrated.
NFL celebrations.
Seriously,

1420
01:24:24.131 --> 01:24:28.180
how many times do we have to see these unoriginal athletes do the jump and the

1421
01:24:28.181 --> 01:24:31.300
chest bump after a touchdown?
It's been,
it's been done so much.

1422
01:24:31.690 --> 01:24:33.580
It's become lackluster and automatic.

1423
01:24:33.581 --> 01:24:38.581
Remember the throat slash they would all do before the NFL bandit for being too

1424
01:24:38.621 --> 01:24:39.790
violent.
A gesture.

1425
01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:44.890
I remember even Brett Farve doing that one and still managing to come off too

1426
01:24:44.891 --> 01:24:45.760
white when he did it.

1427
01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:51.100
Or what about the fact that the celebrations aren't even regulated to touchdowns

1428
01:24:51.101 --> 01:24:55.270
anymore?
Every sack tackle first down and catch warrants,

1429
01:24:55.271 --> 01:24:59.560
a dance and a,
hey look at me moment for the player.
This is the NFL.

1430
01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:03.610
I expect defenses to wrap a guy up and make a tackle.
Uh,

1431
01:25:03.611 --> 01:25:05.650
may expect to receive as the catch the ball.

1432
01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:09.370
They need to show some class and act like they've done it before.
Not to mention,

1433
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:12.300
yeah,
I'm totally with you on that.
That whole,

1434
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:15.930
every time you catch a pass and then you get up and you got it.

1435
01:25:15.931 --> 01:25:20.340
You know the Jerome Bettis was,

1436
01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:23.170
was the guy always stands out in my head where he would,
he would fucking,

1437
01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:25.120
you know,
his first 10 carries,

1438
01:25:25.121 --> 01:25:29.680
he get like 12 yards and then he ripped one off for like 11 and then he'd get up

1439
01:25:29.681 --> 01:25:32.900
and start stopping around,
taken off his fucking Chin strap.

1440
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:38.260
I can't stand that shit.
Braylin Edwards does that Shit,
you know,

1441
01:25:38.261 --> 01:25:43.180
drops like nine passes and then catches one for a first down.
Gets up fucking,

1442
01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:46.780
ah,
it's the worst thing ever.
The Keyshawn Keyshawn Johnson.

1443
01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:52.200
Well you stomp around,
you take off you fucking Chin strap.
It's like,
well,
I,

1444
01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:56.610
I,
I hate that shit.
I hate it.
I can't say.
I don't mind.
Actually we,

1445
01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:58.870
if you catch a touchdown,
you do a little fucking dance.
I actually,

1446
01:25:58.871 --> 01:26:03.500
I've always liked that shit.
But like the,
uh,
the first,

1447
01:26:03.501 --> 01:26:07.460
you know what's even worse is when your team is kicking the shit out of another

1448
01:26:07.461 --> 01:26:11.660
team and then the other team makes a good defensive play and then that guy gets

1449
01:26:11.661 --> 01:26:16.340
up Blah at screaming at the people in the end zone.
It's like,
dude,
you're,
you're,

1450
01:26:16.341 --> 01:26:18.410
you're down 28 to six.
All right,

1451
01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.800
why don't you go back to the defense of Huddle and figure out why the fuck you

1452
01:26:21.801 --> 01:26:24.320
weren't doing that for the first three and a half quarters,
you know,

1453
01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:29.150
so I go with you.
I'm a,
yeah,

1454
01:26:29.630 --> 01:26:32.150
I'm over all of that shit.
And uh,

1455
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:36.640
I think the worst thing I saw this year was the t o show show.
Well,

1456
01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:39.170
you had a team that was absolutely shitting the bed,

1457
01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:44.180
yet their two best players had the time to do a reality show,
uh,

1458
01:26:44.210 --> 01:26:46.790
during the fucking,
uh,
during the season.

1459
01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.700
Do you think bill Bellacheck would put up with that?

1460
01:26:50.570 --> 01:26:53.840
Do you think that those guys would not be shipped out for third round draft

1461
01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:56.270
picks?
It's unfucking believable,

1462
01:26:56.510 --> 01:27:00.650
the level of disrespect that that is to do that fucking show

1463
01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:07.080
during the goddamn season as you proceed to lien ludes fucking eight games in a

1464
01:27:07.081 --> 01:27:09.520
row.
Uh Oh.

1465
01:27:09.521 --> 01:27:13.060
And then you go on the show and you throw your coaches under the bus,
they go,

1466
01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:17.943
um,

1467
01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:22.330
and for those of you who wonder why Randy Moss was traded for a third round

1468
01:27:22.331 --> 01:27:25.870
draft pick,
that's why,
because of that type of shit,
because it's really,

1469
01:27:25.871 --> 01:27:30.130
it's just not worth it.
Like you haven't see a beautiful girl in a bar.
Okay.

1470
01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:33.910
Or whatever.
You start dating a beautiful girl and no matter how hot she is,

1471
01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:37.120
she's just such a cunt.
It's not fucking worth it.

1472
01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:39.610
She's just so fucking high maintenance.

1473
01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:42.400
That's what all those players are like in all the,
all the,

1474
01:27:42.401 --> 01:27:46.330
all those types of sports.
It's at the end of the day,

1475
01:27:46.331 --> 01:27:48.910
no matter how fucking good they are,
they do.
They just not worth it.

1476
01:27:50.190 --> 01:27:53.560
It just not worth it.
Kind of like listening to the rest of this podcast.

1477
01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:54.940
It's really not worth it.

1478
01:27:54.970 --> 01:27:57.910
I feel like I haven't had anything to say for the last fucking 12 minutes.

1479
01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:01.390
Alright.
Underrated,
uh,
bat baseball's code,

1480
01:28:02.530 --> 01:28:05.500
although it's definitely borderline juvenile.
Sometimes.

1481
01:28:05.501 --> 01:28:10.180
I do like that in baseball.
If you show up a pitcher by celebrating your home,

1482
01:28:10.181 --> 01:28:11.410
run a little bit too much,

1483
01:28:11.650 --> 01:28:15.310
you can guarantee he's throwing at you the next time you're up.

1484
01:28:15.730 --> 01:28:19.180
I liked that players get to police themselves a little bit.
Well,
sir,

1485
01:28:19.210 --> 01:28:22.630
why don't you come over to the NHL?
You'd love Nhl Hockey.

1486
01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:27.900
You just basically described why there's fighting and hockey and why.

1487
01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:32.320
That's why hockey's awesome and uh,
you know,

1488
01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:36.820
cause they let the players police each other and I know people who don't like

1489
01:28:36.821 --> 01:28:40.510
the NHL,
they're going to be like by fighting.
Yes.
By fighting.

1490
01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:44.140
It has to be done.
Okay.

1491
01:28:44.410 --> 01:28:48.880
You got a guy skating around the ice if fucking 20 miles an hour with the

1492
01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:52.090
goddamn club in his hand.
Okay.

1493
01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:56.260
If you don't slap the shit out of him,
every couple of games,

1494
01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:01.510
he's going to hurt somebody severely.
You know?
So that's,

1495
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:04.620
that's what needs to be done.
You know,

1496
01:29:04.770 --> 01:29:08.220
think of all the pieces of shit players that are cheap fucks in the NBA.

1497
01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:10.890
All right?
And in the NFL and all that,

1498
01:29:10.891 --> 01:29:15.540
just imagine if they actually had a club in their head and they could walk up to

1499
01:29:15.541 --> 01:29:19.560
your best player and just fucking slam 'em over the head,

1500
01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:23.130
right in the fucking grill or in the side of his fucking leg.

1501
01:29:24.450 --> 01:29:28.110
You know,
you'd have to beat the shit out.
You though,

1502
01:29:28.111 --> 01:29:30.900
are you have to be allowed to beat the shit out of that guy.

1503
01:29:30.901 --> 01:29:33.450
So it wouldn't happen.
And I know what you guys would thinking,

1504
01:29:33.570 --> 01:29:36.390
well if anybody does that just banned him for life out of the league.

1505
01:29:36.570 --> 01:29:41.040
Well then you would end up with nobody playing hockey because I don't know what

1506
01:29:41.041 --> 01:29:44.490
it is.
If you've ever played hockey,
there's something about it.

1507
01:29:44.491 --> 01:29:47.670
It's just a very physical game and at some point you're going to think about it,

1508
01:29:48.770 --> 01:29:51.950
that mother fucker gets you for like the fifth God damn time.
You just,

1509
01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:55.830
you got this club in your hand and you just use the,

1510
01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:57.060
I'm going to fucking come over there.

1511
01:29:57.061 --> 01:30:00.960
I'm just going to fucking take two hander right to his fucking neck.

1512
01:30:00.961 --> 01:30:05.490
But you doubt because their biggest player will come over there and beat the

1513
01:30:05.491 --> 01:30:09.090
living shit out of you in front of your fucking girlfriend or wife was in the

1514
01:30:09.091 --> 01:30:12.630
stance.
See to that makes sense.
Speaking of which,

1515
01:30:12.631 --> 01:30:17.280
I'm actually playing hockey tonight and yes,
I do suck.
I am upon hockey player.

1516
01:30:17.850 --> 01:30:20.970
I can only go frontwards and crossover on one side.
Okay.

1517
01:30:21.150 --> 01:30:25.320
I got the helmet with the full cage.
You know,

1518
01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:29.250
that's,
that's usually a sign that someone's going to be a cheap piece of shit.

1519
01:30:29.251 --> 01:30:31.170
Anybody who has all the extra padding,

1520
01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:35.160
that's because they know somebody is going to come up and try to retaliate.

1521
01:30:35.161 --> 01:30:37.260
So they want to make sure that they're,
they're extra protective.

1522
01:30:37.470 --> 01:30:39.670
I actually wear it because,
uh,
I know that my,

1523
01:30:39.690 --> 01:30:42.570
if I was ever gonna make it to the NHL,
it would have happened by now.

1524
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:46.200
I'm going to go out on a limb and say that as a 42 year old,

1525
01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:47.730
I don't think I'm going to make it.

1526
01:30:48.150 --> 01:30:53.150
So there's really no point in me getting the required 18 stitches that starts

1527
01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:58.320
above my upper lip,
goes through my lips and comes down.

1528
01:30:58.321 --> 01:31:02.820
I remember the Gary Galley one that was the most insane fucking scar I've ever

1529
01:31:02.821 --> 01:31:07.470
seen.
Gary Galley,
former Bruins.
He's playing for the Boston,

1530
01:31:07.471 --> 01:31:09.990
but then you went to the kinks,
right?
He's playing for the Bruins.

1531
01:31:10.110 --> 01:31:11.460
He's in front of the net.

1532
01:31:11.970 --> 01:31:15.450
Somebody gets crosschecked in their chest.

1533
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:20.510
The guy like he gets hit so hard that both his legs fly up into the air.

1534
01:31:22.201 --> 01:31:24.120
He's like in the air,
in the seated position.

1535
01:31:24.121 --> 01:31:29.121
He basically kicks Gary Galley in the face with his skate,

1536
01:31:29.431 --> 01:31:33.210
just sorta like as his legs are going up,

1537
01:31:33.211 --> 01:31:35.970
the blade of the guys skate catches Gary galleys.

1538
01:31:35.971 --> 01:31:40.860
Fucking Chin goes right through both his lips and right up the side of his face

1539
01:31:40.861 --> 01:31:43.680
and he had stitches from,

1540
01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:47.850
I think the side of his nose right down and write through both lips

1541
01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:55.170
in.
That was one of the worst ones I ever saw.
And uh,
you know,

1542
01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:59.070
and I think that's good to conclude one of the worst podcasts I've ever fucking,

1543
01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:04.720
uh,
I felt like a Sanchez during this whole podcast.

1544
01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:07.810
At no point that I feel comfortable.
I don't feel like I settled down.

1545
01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:11.410
I feel like all my jokes went 10 feet over everybody's fucking head.

1546
01:32:11.411 --> 01:32:15.070
And if I could have handed this mic off to somebody for the second half of it,

1547
01:32:16.210 --> 01:32:19.500
you know,
and let somebody kick the last joke through the uprights,
I would have.

1548
01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:25.210
Yeah.
Fuck,
I got to redeem myself.
Did anything funny happened to me this week?

1549
01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:27.850
I went out,
I looked at some houses.

1550
01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:32.320
I think I'm getting ready to go right back on the wheel again.
You know,

1551
01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:34.690
you have to talking about having no god damn dead.

1552
01:32:34.691 --> 01:32:38.350
I'm thinking about just going out and buying a house,
maybe buying a fucking car.

1553
01:32:38.351 --> 01:32:40.490
I want to buy something.
You know,

1554
01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:43.510
I want to fill the void like only an American can.

1555
01:32:44.890 --> 01:32:48.940
Somebody sent me an email talking about how America is over,
you know,

1556
01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:52.540
talking about how China is now.
Now they're now,
they're going to be the shit.

1557
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:58.210
And you know what I say?
Well,
it's about fucking time.
You know,

1558
01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.073
China,

1559
01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:03.100
how many Goddamn fucking people the have to make before he can take over some

1560
01:33:03.101 --> 01:33:05.870
shit.
China,

1561
01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:10.220
that's the most overrated Goddamn fucking country out there.
You know,

1562
01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:15.830
they got like a third of the world's population.
How the fuck are you?

1563
01:33:15.831 --> 01:33:19.760
Not the best.
You should have.
The best guitar players,
the best singers,

1564
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:23.810
the best actors,
the best scientist.
Just on a sheer fucking numbers.

1565
01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:28.460
What are you guys doing over there?
I've been slacking off.

1566
01:33:29.630 --> 01:33:34.190
Slacking off with your fucking awful food.
Ah,
you're dirty.
Goddamn restaurants.

1567
01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:38.000
Do you know I won't eat Chinese food because of that?

1568
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:42.290
I'm not saying Chinese people.
A bad food,
a bad people,
bad food,
bad people.

1569
01:33:42.890 --> 01:33:45.320
It was like a,
that was like a Jeffrey Dahmer comment.

1570
01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:49.160
I'm not saying Chinese people are bad food.
I'm not saying that they're,

1571
01:33:49.161 --> 01:33:53.000
that they're bad people.
I'm not saying they're not smart.

1572
01:33:54.110 --> 01:33:58.580
I'm just saying.
I lived in New York City and uh,

1573
01:33:58.770 --> 01:34:03.680
I used to be a fan of Chinese food.
I am not a fan anymore.
All right.

1574
01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:07.200
And until they start getting some clean damn restaurants out there,
I'm not,

1575
01:34:07.201 --> 01:34:11.300
I'm not fucking eating at him.
That's it.
I'm not saying you're bad people.

1576
01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:13.700
I'm just saying what the fuck.

1577
01:34:16.770 --> 01:34:21.480
Filthy.
I only,
I'll only eat Chinese food.
Who's getting hope?

1578
01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:23.490
I'm shit faced.
I'll eat anything.
I don't give a fuck.

1579
01:34:23.491 --> 01:34:27.270
But if I'm sober and the only way I'll eat Chinese food is if it's a cloth

1580
01:34:27.271 --> 01:34:30.990
Napkin,
sit down.
Nice fucking place.

1581
01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:35.340
All right.
And it'd be fair.
That's why I don't eat barbecue.

1582
01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:40.560
I'm not going into those God damn shacks with those fucking flies

1583
01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.530
the size of Goddamn bumblebees.

1584
01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:48.750
I'm not going in there and I get it.
That's the whole aids boy.

1585
01:34:48.751 --> 01:34:53.520
You poor people food.
Yeah.
It looks like it.
It looks like it.

1586
01:34:54.150 --> 01:34:58.400
It looks like you've been dominated on some fucking level.
Oh,

1587
01:34:58.401 --> 01:35:00.680
with the dirty floors and the peanut shells.

1588
01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:05.200
Fuck Barbecue and fuck Chinese food.
All right.

1589
01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:09.320
I actually had some Lebanese food,
uh,
yesterday,

1590
01:35:09.321 --> 01:35:11.570
which is just sort of all like Middle Eastern food like that,

1591
01:35:11.571 --> 01:35:16.571
that a chicken kabobs and all that stuff was fucking insane to Bouley Salad.

1592
01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:21.200
All right.
I sign off on that.
I sign off on Indian food.

1593
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:27.050
I sign off on a,
these are all the ones I'll give you a that I like.

1594
01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:31.700
I like a Japanese,
I'll go with Korean barbecue,

1595
01:35:31.701 --> 01:35:36.590
we'll go with that.
Thai food.
I liked that shit.
Chinese,

1596
01:35:36.650 --> 01:35:39.710
I think Chinese was the only one I won't fuck with.
You know,

1597
01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:41.900
and I'm Mexican food.

1598
01:35:41.901 --> 01:35:44.750
Mexican food has to be a certain cut or I'm not fucking with it.

1599
01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:48.140
You know when you go to the,
so some of those,

1600
01:35:48.141 --> 01:35:51.650
some of those little shits Jack's there and they got to have the refi re fried

1601
01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:53.540
beans and it just looks like,
you know,

1602
01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:58.160
it's like does the health department even know this place exists?
Okay.

1603
01:35:58.370 --> 01:36:00.560
This is like a restaurant slash

1604
01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:06.860
it's like you turn the garage,
he house into a fucking burrito factory.

1605
01:36:06.861 --> 01:36:08.870
I'm not eating here.
Macro.

1606
01:36:08.871 --> 01:36:12.380
Alexia gives me shit because I'll never get Chinese food.
You know?

1607
01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:16.430
And she thinks that that there's something like borderline racist that I won't

1608
01:36:16.431 --> 01:36:20.870
eat Chinese food.
It's like I have no problem with those people.
You know,

1609
01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:23.270
that's like over like overly think it's something.

1610
01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:28.550
What I'm saying is is I want a clean God damn restaurant.
Is that so wrong?

1611
01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:34.310
Um,
all right.
That's the podcast for this fucking week.
Um,
I dunno.

1612
01:36:34.390 --> 01:36:37.640
I am.
I am I wrong about that shit I just did when I think Chinese food,

1613
01:36:37.641 --> 01:36:38.980
I think dirty restaurant.
That's,

1614
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.160
that's what the fuck I think because that has been my experience.
So go ahead.

1615
01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:47.480
We're going to take the next call after this break.
Uh,
Hey,

1616
01:36:47.481 --> 01:36:50.360
what would you guys do if I started doing commercials on my podcast as a way to

1617
01:36:50.361 --> 01:36:53.990
make money if right in the middle of calling somebody a cunt.

1618
01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:56.930
I just did something for like true value hardware.

1619
01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:00.620
Do they still exist or where they bought out?
Bought up by best buy.

1620
01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:04.490
Do they still exist?
All right.
Anyways.
Oh,
you know what?

1621
01:37:04.491 --> 01:37:09.140
I actually forgot tonight then.
I can't say this shit because I

1622
01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:12.380
now fuck it.
I'm going to say it.

1623
01:37:12.530 --> 01:37:16.550
I'm actually gonna go see one of my favorite drummers of all time tonight.

1624
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:18.800
And,
uh,

1625
01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:23.300
Joe Joe Mayor is doing a drum clinic and I'm going to go check that shit out.

1626
01:37:24.110 --> 01:37:26.660
And uh,
if you want to see this guy drummers out there,

1627
01:37:26.661 --> 01:37:28.730
you got to fucking check this guy out.
This is going to,

1628
01:37:28.731 --> 01:37:32.030
I'm going to have this up on the MM podcast.com.
Uh,

1629
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:33.890
it's Joe Joe mayor performing.

1630
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:39.310
I plays like that drum in a drum and bass music and it's him performing at the,

1631
01:37:39.501 --> 01:37:43.910
I believe 2005 modern drummer festival.
And it's just a three minute clip.

1632
01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:48.200
He could do like a role with one hand.
He's got that push pull molar thing.

1633
01:37:48.201 --> 01:37:51.710
I don't know what the fuck he's doing,
but uh,

1634
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:56.460
this guy is the shit and I'm actually starting to like,

1635
01:37:57.810 --> 01:37:59.490
I can't get into drum and bass,

1636
01:37:59.491 --> 01:38:03.270
but I'm downloading some of his shit just because it's played by human beings

1637
01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:08.220
and I'm actually fascinated with drum and bass because it,

1638
01:38:08.221 --> 01:38:13.221
it melds both the capabilities of technology and then the abilities of human

1639
01:38:15.811 --> 01:38:20.580
beings to adapt to the technology and raise their level of performance.
You know,

1640
01:38:20.670 --> 01:38:24.810
remember that time when I told you guys about that,
that whole,
uh,

1641
01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:27.690
drum and bass music,
that whole video,
I basically explained it.

1642
01:38:27.691 --> 01:38:31.500
It was like a fucking drum brake from a B side of a 45.

1643
01:38:31.501 --> 01:38:35.430
And then Djs took that drum loop,
isolated every sound,

1644
01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:39.000
and then switched it all up and created a whole bunch of different beats and

1645
01:38:39.001 --> 01:38:44.001
then sped it up to the point that no human being could play it until a guy like

1646
01:38:44.221 --> 01:38:48.450
Joe Joe mayor sat down and figured out how to fucking do it.
It's,

1647
01:38:48.451 --> 01:38:51.450
it's incredible.
It's absolutely incredible.
I'm going to watch that guy tonight.

1648
01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:55.620
I'm going to get my ass kicked out on the ice tonight playing hockey and that's

1649
01:38:55.621 --> 01:38:58.980
it.
I'm going to be in New York and uh,
we doing spots,
uh,

1650
01:38:59.970 --> 01:39:03.030
around the city before I go down to Atlantic city.

1651
01:39:03.031 --> 01:39:05.700
So I make sure that I am in shape for my,
uh,

1652
01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:10.610
my big gig down there with Jim Norton,
Jim Breuer and David Tell,
uh,

1653
01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:14.250
I will probably be popping in at Gotham comedy club.

1654
01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:17.790
I will be popping in at the comedy cellar

1655
01:39:19.530 --> 01:39:23.740
and a stand up New York and Co the comic strip and danger fields on,

1656
01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:27.600
they'd be doing the whole fucking loop.
Like I used to back in the old days,

1657
01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:30.840
back in the old days,
which I guess they don't do that anymore now.

1658
01:39:30.841 --> 01:39:34.340
They booked the club's a month out and they just want you to work at the,

1659
01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:38.870
at the same club the whole week.
But back in the day,
he used to,

1660
01:39:38.890 --> 01:39:43.710
used to work like three,
four clubs.
If you could on a weekend and you'd,
you'd,

1661
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:49.290
you'd have a nine o'clock here at nine 45 and another club at 10 20 here and

1662
01:39:49.291 --> 01:39:54.291
1130 here all the way to like two o'clock in the morning and you get $50 a spot

1663
01:39:56.010 --> 01:40:00.810
and you'd blow like a third of it on cabs just driving all around the city and

1664
01:40:00.811 --> 01:40:04.560
you'd have a new idea for a bit.
And uh,

1665
01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:09.610
in one night you could hash it out just doing like,
you know,
sometimes up.

1666
01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:12.390
I think the most I ever did,
I do like eight sets in a night.

1667
01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:17.730
It was fucking unbelievable and it just caused you to write because you didn't

1668
01:40:17.731 --> 01:40:22.620
want to say the same thing eight times in one night and uh,
you could,

1669
01:40:22.621 --> 01:40:26.970
you could flesh out a bit.
I mean that was basically like doing,

1670
01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:28.591
you know,

1671
01:40:28.591 --> 01:40:32.820
almost headline weekends you only do six shows so you would get eight shows on

1672
01:40:32.821 --> 01:40:33.510
average six.

1673
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:38.510
So it was like doing an entire weekend worth of shows in one night as far as

1674
01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:41.940
running that same new bit and it's incredible.

1675
01:40:42.090 --> 01:40:46.260
And I wish the New York clubs would go back to doing that because I really think

1676
01:40:46.261 --> 01:40:51.261
that that was the system that created all the great comics that I watched when I

1677
01:40:51.391 --> 01:40:52.620
came to New York.
That's just my,

1678
01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:56.560
that's my 2 cents and I'll fucking sticker with that.
That's it.

1679
01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:58.300
You guys watch 60 minutes by the way,

1680
01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:01.160
that just reminded me of fucking Andy Rooney guys been watching.

1681
01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:02.590
I watch that every week.

1682
01:41:02.591 --> 01:41:06.730
Me in the eye and we just laugh our asses off at their curmudgeonly old bastard

1683
01:41:06.731 --> 01:41:09.310
and what the fuck is going on with his upper lip?

1684
01:41:09.850 --> 01:41:14.650
It's receded on both sides yet the middle part still is fleshy.

1685
01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:20.260
So now it looks like he has a pimple.
It's upper lip.

1686
01:41:20.710 --> 01:41:21.760
All right,
I got nothing people.

1687
01:41:21.761 --> 01:41:25.840
I'm talking about fucking Andy Rooney's upper lip.
Okay.
The podcast is overbuilt.

1688
01:41:25.930 --> 01:41:29.800
Tap Out.
It's over.
Oh,
congratulations to Pete Carroll.

1689
01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:35.140
I was wrong about that.
Docker wearing white shoes.
Jerry Seinfeld,

1690
01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:39.400
sneaker son of a bitch.
They came out to fucking play.

1691
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:42.580
Worse defensive performance I've ever seen with the saints.

1692
01:41:43.150 --> 01:41:45.820
And uh,
I don't know.

1693
01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:48.340
I don't even know who the fuck they're playing next week.

1694
01:41:48.341 --> 01:41:51.490
I'm just hoping that my patriots and praying that we're going to beat the jets

1695
01:41:51.491 --> 01:41:54.280
cause I have no fucking idea which defense is going to show up.

1696
01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:58.870
But I'll phone the patriots are got to be thinking.
All right,

1697
01:41:58.871 --> 01:42:02.070
that's the podcast for this week.
Everybody have a great week.
Uh,

1698
01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:05.320
don't give out your information to these fucking corporation for the love of
God.

1699
01:42:05.321 --> 01:42:09.370
And if you want to go ahead and do it stupid.
All right,
go ahead and do it.

1700
01:42:09.371 --> 01:42:12.160
But then don't be surprised when a,
you know,

1701
01:42:12.161 --> 01:42:16.000
some psycho you dated from high school is standing on your front porch and has

1702
01:42:16.001 --> 01:42:18.760
your fucking now all your information.
All right.

1703
01:42:18.850 --> 01:42:21.400
I couldn't even finish that sentence to gives us,
fuck.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1704
01:42:21.401 --> 01:42:22.234
I'll talk to you next week.

1705
01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:32.920
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

1706
01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:14.000
