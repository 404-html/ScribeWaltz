2
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:09.960
this is the Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.253
<v 1>Stan.</v>

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.380
<v 0>Guys,
I'm running out of ways to say it.
All right.</v>

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.150
I'm just going to have to go with the standard,
you know,

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.180
I always just say what's going on?
It's bill birth Monday morning podcast.

7
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:25.710
I'm just going to come up with a standard one.

8
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.240
You know what the fuck did I just do?
That was like a,

9
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:32.460
I got birds sitting outside on my porch now.

10
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.480
I'm fucking office is a fucking mess here.

11
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.800
Anyways,
how are you?
How's your week been going?

12
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.600
Well that's good.
Um,

13
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.480
I'd been a busy beaver wrapping up emphasis was family.
I keep bringing it up.
Uh,

14
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:54.540
we're,
we're editing episodes six,

15
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:58.800
we've locked one through four,
which means a,

16
00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:03.210
I think that means no more animation.
The timing of it is locked.

17
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:04.950
You know what's fucked up.
Once you lock it,

18
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.160
you only way you can change a joke as if it takes,

19
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:13.140
if it's the same amount of time and basic lip movement.
Because at this point,

20
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:18.141
they're already having voice actors all over different countries doing the show

21
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.890
in Spanish,
French and all this other shit.
Uh,

22
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.720
I don't know if they're going to get it,
you know,
it's Netflix.

23
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.010
They're worldwide.
So I guess that's what they're doing.
So once you lock it,

24
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.950
I learned that because I was just like,
hey,
you know,
I dunno about that joke.

25
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:36.960
Everybody just looked at me.
I was like,

26
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:38.970
what if we write a whole paragraph is shit?

27
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:43.110
And everybody's just looking at me like,
uh,
okay.
Uh,

28
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:45.210
when they see the show with locked,

29
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.140
what that means is right now doing that shit to me and whatever.

30
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.640
I'm the fucking new guy.
I'm the new guy.
So anyways,
um,

31
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.830
oh,
freckles,
freckles has a back on it with the working out,

32
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.450
you know,
took a nice loss last week.
What did I do?

33
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.150
Did I hang my head?
Sure I did.
Did I take it out of my wife?
Of course.

34
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.110
Did I make scary faces of children walking by me on the streets?

35
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:16.890
So they cried and I felt better about myself.
Absolutely.

36
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.800
But once I got through that childish period,
um,
I got right back on it.

37
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.810
You know,
I said I was getting down to a buck 62.

38
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.840
I'm fucking getting down to it.
Weighed myself this morning and a,

39
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.810
I'm going in the right direction to turn the ship around and um,

40
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.820
I've almost lost 20 pounds.
You know what happens when you lose almost 20 pounds?

41
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:41.310
People stop saying you look good.
They start giving you shit.

42
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.780
They start trying to pick you apart.
You know,
just like the Patriots,

43
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.910
he went a couple of rigs.
All of a sudden you're not the Darlin's anymore.

44
00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:55.500
Everybody's trying to find fault.
So people are giving me Shit,
right?

45
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.590
Getting Shit on Twitter,
like,
you know,
doing all this stuff about,
oh wait,

46
00:03:00.591 --> 00:03:04.820
was a wood shop with your ra?
Sad percentage.

47
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.460
Got a bunch of those,
you know,

48
00:03:07.461 --> 00:03:11.660
thinking I'm just sitting here like some chick before a wedding,
just not eating.

49
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.050
I'm fucking eating like a maniac.
I have breakfast,

50
00:03:15.051 --> 00:03:17.540
a snack lunch than something else.

51
00:03:17.541 --> 00:03:22.070
And then I have a meal at four and it's six fuel in my body.

52
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.950
Dude,
it's fucking bizarre.
I don't have any sugar,
salt cravings right now.

53
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.530
I fucking walked by the other day I was walking down the street by [inaudible]

54
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.800
and these people are outside while,
while,
while,
while,
while,

55
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:37.270
and now we're eating pasta with bread rolls.
And I didn't give a shit.

56
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.400
I just looked at it like,
oh,
what the fuck is I used to eat that,
you know,

57
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.160
before when I was on the smack,

58
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.240
you know when I was drinking the booze and all that shit,
you know,
it's sugar,

59
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:49.991
salt,
sugar,
salt.

60
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:54.670
I would look at that pass to got o don't fucking cancel everything.

61
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.930
Let's sit down and fucking put that man hole in my stomach.

62
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.670
Um,
it was the thing too.

63
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:03.940
I'm not being some can't right now cause I know most of you guys who are junkies

64
00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:06.160
right now,
sugar,
salt,
sugar,
salt,
doing that fucking thing.

65
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:08.680
I understand you don't think I'm going to be back

66
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.920
fucking limp in my way back into regular person rehab with the sugar salt
course.

67
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:19.810
I will.
But right now I got to fucking see this thing through.
So,
uh,

68
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.090
Oh God,
the blandness of some of this shit that I'm eating

69
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.270
know my four o'clock meal is I make Turkey patties.
You know,

70
00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:34.590
if I treat myself and I got enough fucking cha call,

71
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.170
I'll throw on my little Hibachi,
right.
And uh,
I don't know,

72
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.970
people around the country call them Hibachi.
It's just like a little grill.

73
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.240
I remember I said a bace the first time we move out to la,

74
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.490
the first time I was out here in the late nineties,

75
00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:52.020
people like I got to La as I,
you know,

76
00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:56.180
they do that thing.
If she had sketch on fucking,
uh,
SNL,

77
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.620
the Californians where they wouldn't say a word and they wouldn't close their

78
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:05.640
mouth until the end of it.
Like the,
we live in cow law class.

79
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.223
Um,

80
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.490
there is something about people that live out in Calabasas and in that fucking

81
00:05:11.491 --> 00:05:16.170
area.
Um,
I had to go to the doctor the other day,
you know,

82
00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:17.850
I'm an old man getting a checkup or whatever.

83
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.850
So this lady fucking brings me into this room and starts doing something to my

84
00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:27.420
leg.
I got like this little varicose vein.
I'm trying to get rid of,

85
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.370
she's taken in with this fucking laser thing and I found out x cause I got like

86
00:05:32.371 --> 00:05:36.120
low Brugge blood pressure.
So the,
my heart shoots it down to my feet,

87
00:05:36.121 --> 00:05:38.820
but then it doesn't come back up my legs the way it should.

88
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.020
It tells me I get to wear compression socks and shit.
Fuck it.

89
00:05:43.021 --> 00:05:44.790
Looking at him like I'm that fucking old,

90
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.950
you know when you fly on planes where some compression socks.
So anyways,

91
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.590
this person,
she takes me into the fucking room,
right?
And I go,
uh,

92
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.260
I was going like,
what to have,

93
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:03.770
I had my bag and my bag with me and I just,

94
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.830
there was a chair,
you know,
the fucking classic,
you know,

95
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.270
share that has the wheels on it that the fucking practitioner always sits in.

96
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.710
So it's all the way in the corner.
And if I set my bag down with my sneakers,

97
00:06:16.711 --> 00:06:19.080
it's the bag and the sneakers and now in the way of the chair.

98
00:06:19.081 --> 00:06:23.340
So I say to the person,
I'm like,
do you need that chair?

99
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.690
And she's like,
Nah.
So I set the shit down.
And then she,

100
00:06:27.691 --> 00:06:30.660
then I sit down and she's like,
oh wait,
I do need it.

101
00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:35.280
And she just starts dragging it across the floor.
My sneakers are underneath it,

102
00:06:35.281 --> 00:06:39.780
like,
like beginning to turn over and over and over,
like rolling along with it.

103
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.450
And I'm just looking at it,

104
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.090
I just like fucking pick the chair up and give it to her.

105
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.550
And then I joked,
I'm like,

106
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.370
are you better with the laser then you are with the chairs of that.
I ask,

107
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.120
I'm like,
why
I am a law?

108
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.650
Are you saying I know,
I'm sorry.
It's really weird.
I must say she was dumb.

109
00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:03.120
They just did that accent.

110
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.200
Ah.
Say I asked how the,

111
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.040
the going to what I call,
uh,

112
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.840
see me downstairs and the other what?
Raw Rum.
Yeah.

113
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.000
I,
I've been having a lot of that this week.
I was,

114
00:07:24.001 --> 00:07:28.740
um,
I was fucking sitting at home,
right.
And,

115
00:07:28.741 --> 00:07:32.190
uh,
I've been dying to make a fucking key lime pie.

116
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.370
I love key lime pie and key limes are in season.

117
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:41.030
So I learned from last year that she can't go to fucking snooty white people

118
00:07:41.371 --> 00:07:45.540
grocery stores because for whatever reason they got something against key lime.

119
00:07:45.541 --> 00:07:49.650
She come in and you're like,
do you guys have key limes to like key lime pie?

120
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.460
No key lines.
Like the Pie?
No.

121
00:07:53.461 --> 00:07:58.290
Like the fucking lines tell her to stay while you're yelling.

122
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.230
The all I have is the pie.
They won't fucking sell them.

123
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.280
But if you go to a grocery store,
we're enough.

124
00:08:05.281 --> 00:08:07.590
I Dunno if it's Asian or Latino people.

125
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.680
I don't know what it is out here.

126
00:08:10.681 --> 00:08:13.590
If you go to Johns j o n s they have them.

127
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:15.960
If you go to like trader,

128
00:08:15.961 --> 00:08:20.820
jazz and far our fucking a whole food,

129
00:08:20.821 --> 00:08:25.220
they don't have them.
Gimme like the Pie.

130
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.650
No,
the fucking line.
Um,
so anyways,
so I went down,

131
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:32.390
I got those fucking things and I'm like,
all right,

132
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:34.630
I'm gonna try and make one of these things as I'm sitting here at dieting,
I,

133
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:35.511

134
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:38.720

135
00:08:38.721 --> 00:08:42.440

136

139
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:49.520
I made this fucking pie and a homemade whipped cream,

140
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:52.220
which is not difficult by the way.
I know made homemade whipped cream.

141
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:53.600
Do you know you just take heavy cream,

143
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.650
little cartons of milk you'd get when you were a kid going to school.

144
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:02.670
You just pour that into a ball and then like a quarter cup of sugar and I don't

145
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:03.710
think it's that much.
You,

146
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.500
I've put some sugar in there and then you just put your uh,
like an egg beater.

147
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.930
He just put it on high and all of a sudden it turns into the old fucking whipped

148
00:09:11.931 --> 00:09:16.890
cream.
If you go too long somehow,
I don't know,
it turns in dope,

149
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.270
but then you've got sugar in it,
so it tastes weird.

150
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.850
I think it's more like the consistency.
If you put salt in,

151
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:24.750
if you've got to make butter,

152
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.170
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about Bonita.
Anyways,

153
00:09:27.171 --> 00:09:31.650
so I made the thing with a Graham cracker crust.
Um,

154
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.520
the hardest part was,
was juice in the fucking lives.
Um,

155
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.950
there's little fuckers,
man.
They didn't want to,
I though the lady,

156
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.570
the lady I was watching on Youtube,

157
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:46.380
she actually got one of those garlic press things,
a bigger one,
she'd have them.

158
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:48.390
And so I put it in there and uh,
I got to tell you,
man,

159
00:09:48.391 --> 00:09:51.330
I think it was taught as a motherfucker.
I don't know if I didn't make it right,

160
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.640
I'm going to back off the lime juice.
Uh,

161
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.720
I actually put a little extra lime juice in because usually people,
they,

162
00:09:57.721 --> 00:10:02.310
they under fucking season I find.
So I just assumed that this lady,
you know,

163
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.890
who cooks for a living,
didn't know what she was doing.

164
00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:08.970
And I'm a fucking standup comedian.
So yeah,
by all means,
Bill.
Overruled.
The chef.

165
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.600
Um,
but are you really a chef if you just making youtube videos?

166
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:13.930
<v 2>Okay.</v>

167
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.330
<v 0>That's like me.
I do a podcast.
Anybody can do this,
you know,</v>

168
00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.580
do I really consider myself a broadcaster?
I don't,

169
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.100
I consider myself a jerk off talking into a microphone that I then upload onto

170
00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:26.930
my computer.
Um,
so anyways,
so I tried it man.

171
00:10:26.931 --> 00:10:31.150
It taught as a motherfucker too much in as much lime juices.

172
00:10:31.151 --> 00:10:34.600
It was then they had the,
the,
the,
the rind over the Rhine,

173
00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:38.830
whatever the fuck you say the skin of it's sprinkled on top and I was too much,

174
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:43.870
too much,
but I'm going to finish it.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Uh,

175
00:10:43.871 --> 00:10:47.500
but somehow I'm still fucking a,
I'm still dropping weight.

176
00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:51.400
I got to see this thing through.
I got to see it fucking thrilled cause uh,

177
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:55.720
I'm finally,
it took me whatever I'm into right now,

178
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.770
eight weeks.

179
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:02.660
It took me eight weeks just to have hope that I could actually have a decent

180
00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:07.130
fucking torso again.
It was fun.

181
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.250
I'll tell you it was rough.
You know,
I'm,
I'm telling you man,

182
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.120
a button down shirt is a middle aged man's friend.
Okay.

183
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.290
And if you need a Snuggie,

184
00:11:15.291 --> 00:11:18.860
you just put on a fucking sport coat and all of a sudden magically you're in

185
00:11:18.861 --> 00:11:20.540
shape and a nice,
like I said,

186
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.230
then one day you got to go to the company picnic and all of a sudden it's t

187
00:11:24.231 --> 00:11:25.070
shirt time.

188
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.580
Remember that from the fucking and Italian show there on the beach in Jersey.

189
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:33.710
It's a short time and you fucking show up,
you know,

190
00:11:33.711 --> 00:11:35.120
with fucking love handles

191
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:41.260
the size of a fucking loaf of bread.
Um,
so anyways,

192
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.480
I've been having a lot of that miscommunication shit going on this week,
right?

193
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.760
So I,
I know I was going to tell you the key line story.

194
00:11:46.761 --> 00:11:51.290
So I go down to Johns j o n s not a pause,
three,
not possessive.

195
00:11:51.291 --> 00:11:56.050
John's,
I go down there,
uh,
that wouldn't be wants,

196
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:59.500
what did,
that'd be Jua in us.
It's John's whatever.

197
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:00.910
So I go down there and I'm all excited.

198
00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:03.700
They got these fucking things and they got him in space.

199
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.810
Big fucking pile of them.
And um,

200
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.050
so I go down and you know,
I got like a pound of them,
whatever.

201
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:13.900
I've got a little more than a pound just in case I didn't have enough juice or

202
00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:17.170
whatever.
So I'm all excited.
I'm going to make this fucking pie right.

203
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.360
So I'm standing in line now I'm that do,

204
00:12:19.361 --> 00:12:22.420
she was just in a great mood talking to strangers.

205
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.900
So I'm standing there waiting to pay and I see this lady and I'm all excited

206
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:28.720
cause I would make the pie.
And she had this really weird looking bread,

207
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.350
but it looked delicious.
So I just say to her,
I'm like,
Oh,
what is that?
Is that,

208
00:12:32.351 --> 00:12:36.640
is that bread?
You've got bread there?
And she just looks at me and she goes,
what?

209
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.410
I realized she barely spoke English.
And then I just said,
uh,
I always said,

210
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.610
I said,
okay,
well what kind of bread is that?
Oh,
it's delicious.
And She just goes,

211
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.790
what?
And then I totally just switched and I was like,

212
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.500
is that bread?
And she just goes,
yes.

213
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.090
Just turned around away from where it did.

214
00:12:58.091 --> 00:13:00.790
That thing where you're laughing and try not to move your head.

215
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.480
The whole conversation just went south.
Um,

216
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.550
so anyways,
anyways,
how'd your week go and Huh?
You hanging in there?

217
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.450
Hot as a motherfucker out here.
Goddamn.
Uh,

218
00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.040
Los Angeles,
where I'm living in a,
I've been,
as I've been telling you guys,

219
00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:20.230
I'm going to work on my way through this Andre Agassi book.

220
00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:23.110
Not like it's been work.
This book opens fucking great.

221
00:13:23.111 --> 00:13:27.430
I just been so damn busy and uh,
it's unreal.

222
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.630
Jesus Christ,
as he take us through the Brooke Shields relationship,
you know,

223
00:13:31.631 --> 00:13:36.400
he takes a little heat himself,
but a woo.
He does not pull any punches,
man.

224
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:39.670
He's not being like mean.
He's just fucking state and easy.

225
00:13:39.671 --> 00:13:44.500
This dude's just putting it out there,
like every great book should,
um,

226
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:50.410
talked about doing crystal meth.
It was like,
I had no idea he did that,

227
00:13:50.411 --> 00:13:51.360
but just the way he,

228
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:55.240
the way he's taking you through the bookshields shields relationship is the same

229
00:13:55.241 --> 00:13:55.990
way he takes,

230
00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:00.070
he takes you to his matches and you're rooting for the guy yet had stomach's in

231
00:14:00.071 --> 00:14:03.160
knots.
As you're reading it,
you're like,
come on,
come on,
come on.
Oh good.

232
00:14:03.161 --> 00:14:05.470
He's to the sammies through the 70s.
And then he's like,

233
00:14:05.471 --> 00:14:07.690
and then my mind starts fucking with me.
And you're like,
God,

234
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.280
it's like you're winning and losing with them.
It's such a great fucking book.

235
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:17.610
So it ended up making me a curious as to like the,

236
00:14:18.101 --> 00:14:20.680
the tennis tour,
which I've never paid attention to.

237
00:14:20.681 --> 00:14:23.860
Like most like passive tennis fans.

238
00:14:23.861 --> 00:14:28.360
I just watched the majors and for the most part I just watched Wimbledon.

239
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.680
I always watch Wimbledon.

240
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:34.600
I could give a fuck about the Australian Open US Open every once in a while I

241
00:14:34.601 --> 00:14:38.320
would watch,
but it was all about breakfast at Wimbledon.
I grew up watching that.

242
00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:41.830
I don't know why I thought the grass was cool and whatever.

243
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.760
Roland Garros to clay just bored me.
I don't know why.

244
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.080
Now I'm totally into all of it.

245
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.950
So it made reading this book made me want to look up the tour to see how many

246
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.183
there are.

247
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:57.400
So I believe that 62 events every year and for hardcore sports fans,

248
00:14:58.821 --> 00:15:01.610
this what actually this will probably interest you as far as like how they get

249
00:15:01.611 --> 00:15:04.490
their rankings.
I might be off on this.

250
00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:08.150
It obviously has to do with the major events that you,

251
00:15:08.151 --> 00:15:09.590
when you get points for it.

252
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.140
And then also I would also think like who you beat would also have something to

253
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:15.561
do with it.

254
00:15:15.561 --> 00:15:18.710
Like if you will ranked 100th and all of a sudden you're fucking beat the number

255
00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:21.230
one person in the world.
I don't give a fuck how many points you have.

256
00:15:21.231 --> 00:15:25.250
They got a movie up at least 50,
60 spots,
right?
Or whatever.

257
00:15:25.251 --> 00:15:27.460
I'm just using that as a rough example.
So here's,

258
00:15:27.461 --> 00:15:32.380
here's how the point system works.
There's,
um,
there's uh,

259
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:34.880
sorry,
um,

260
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:40.870
for a grand slam you get 2000 points and then underneath that,

261
00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:45.110
then there's four grand slams,
Australia,
French,
uh,
the English,

262
00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:49.940
Wimbledon and a,
the u s open.
So all of those are worth 2000 if you win them.

263
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.530
And then they have these other ones that are worth a thousand.

264
00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.880
They call him the gold something or other.
And for some reason they were in gold.

265
00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:01.610
And I read a couple of blogs and tennis people don't quite understand why,

266
00:16:01.611 --> 00:16:06.530
look why they're called that.
It says,
uh,
their ATP World Tour Masters,

267
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.323
um,

268
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:13.220
events and those are worth a thousand and there's nine of those.

269
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.760
So for nobody,
and by the way,

270
00:16:16.761 --> 00:16:21.730
nobody has ever won all nine of those,
which I found really interesting.
Like A,

271
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.550
there's a couple people in doubles have won them.
Um,

272
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.500
and like Djokovich has one eight,

273
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:32.420
I think [inaudible] seven or eight of them.
Um,

274
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.970
so whatever.
And they're basically,
and while I was psyched,

275
00:16:34.971 --> 00:16:39.020
there's one out here in Indian Wells,
um,
they're basically,

276
00:16:39.021 --> 00:16:43.340
I went and I fucking read them the for you.
Um,
okay,

277
00:16:43.341 --> 00:16:44.330
well let me get through the whole thing.

278
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.410
And then there's events that are worth 500 points and then there's ones that are

279
00:16:48.411 --> 00:16:53.330
just worth 250 points,
which are just shit bum fuck in lowest,

280
00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:58.250
like you're barely on the God damn tour.
Um,
so I think these pros,

281
00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.220
the upper echelon ones,
you know,
if they're,

282
00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:03.380
if they're coming back from an injury,

283
00:17:03.381 --> 00:17:08.330
they'll probably play it at two 50 or a if they're just trying to get some sort

284
00:17:08.331 --> 00:17:11.960
of points and they just need them or they need the money and they fucked up and

285
00:17:11.961 --> 00:17:14.780
bought too many God damn rackets that whatever the fuck they do way he would,

286
00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.710
he publicly rackets for free when you,
anyways,
um,

287
00:17:18.711 --> 00:17:22.520
I just find it really interesting.
So there's nine of these,
these events,

288
00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:26.540
I'm not going to bore you with the 502 50.
Read all 62.

289
00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:30.140
The first one's in March,
that's Indian wells out here in California.

290
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.360
And then the next one is in Miami.

291
00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:35.570
So what's cool is you can lose the Australian Open,

292
00:17:35.571 --> 00:17:39.460
but then when both of those and a thousand a piece and it's like you want to May

293
00:17:39.461 --> 00:17:42.650
gea,
then there's one in Monte Carlo

294
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:48.950
that's fucking great.
And I'm like,
why isn't it say in uh,
France?
I forgot.

295
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.520
That's a sovereign state Monaco,
which means they're their own little country.

296
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.510
It's funny why nobody just attacks him.
There's so little.
Um,

297
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.810
maybe because they're all in the aluminum.

298
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:07.650
All right.
Um,
then there's one in Spain,
in Madrid.
There's one in Rome,

299
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.790
Italy.
Both of those are in May.
So these are people who've passive tennis fans.

300
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:14.610
It might be a thousand point point or right down the street and you'll see

301
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:18.660
Serena or Federer Djokovich or whatever.

302
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:23.970
There's one in Canada and Montreal that's in,
uh,
August.
Well,

303
00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.790
I guess you guys would go to the website.
The one I just watched in Cincinnati,

304
00:18:26.791 --> 00:18:30.130
I saw Serena when that one,
Cincinnati,
who would've thought,
no,

305
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.490
there's one in Shanghai.
This is worth a thousand points.

306
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:37.030
And then the last one is in Paris.
I was fucking French constantly.

307
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:38.400
Got One in Monaco,

308
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:43.200
1,001 in Paris for a thousand and then they have Roland Garros with 2000

309
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:44.490
<v 2>okay.</v>

310
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.590
<v 0>Sons of bitches.
Um,</v>

311
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.100
and there's some sort of Barclays,
whatever.
I thought it was really interesting.

312
00:18:51.101 --> 00:18:53.080
So I'm going to try to pay attention.
One of that shit.

313
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:56.950
It kind of helps you get through the summer.
I just need help through July,

314
00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.500
mid June into July.

315
00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:03.460
And then I get excited because football's coming back and then by the end of

316
00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.080
August I start watching baseball.

317
00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:07.720
Like today I was driving around in my old truck and I was listening to the

318
00:19:07.721 --> 00:19:12.280
Dodgers playing an afternoon game against Cincinnati and I'm embarrassed to say,

319
00:19:12.281 --> 00:19:16.030
I don't know anybody's name at all in baseball.

320
00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:21.031
The only people I know is when I stopped paying attention five years ago when

321
00:19:21.371 --> 00:19:24.910
they said big papi tested positive for something.
I was just like,
ah dude,

322
00:19:24.911 --> 00:19:28.210
I don't know.
I don't want to watch Santa Claus go down to,
you know,

323
00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.910
nothing ever came of it.
But yeah,
it was just baseball was,

324
00:19:30.911 --> 00:19:34.750
it was just coming out of that roid era where it was just like,
all right,

325
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:40.120
I'm so sick of you guys telling me something that I cheered for eight years ago

326
00:19:40.121 --> 00:19:44.770
now doesn't count.
Just fucking clean it up.
And I,
I think they cleaned,

327
00:19:44.771 --> 00:19:47.080
I dunno.
I don't even give a shit whether they did or not.

328
00:19:47.081 --> 00:19:50.670
I don't understand why they can't use steroids.
These fucking poor bastards.

329
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.230
They can,
if you read the beginning of this Agassi book,

330
00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.400
the fucking pain that this guy is in,
just trying to get out of bed,

331
00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:04.590
just trying to to stand upright and then having to take an hour long shower and

332
00:20:04.591 --> 00:20:09.330
then go get shot up with cortisone is stuff and get out on the court and get

333
00:20:09.331 --> 00:20:13.800
himself all warmed up so his body can actually function.

334
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:18.390
These guys,
anything you can give these guys,
men and women,
they,

335
00:20:18.391 --> 00:20:21.480
they should be fucking legal.
It make for,

336
00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.230
I don't know,
their bodies would,
he'll quit.
I don't what the fuck though.

337
00:20:26.231 --> 00:20:27.780
You're not a doctor.
I mean it's,

338
00:20:27.781 --> 00:20:32.320
it appears to me as a comedian that with no medical background that their bodies

339
00:20:32.321 --> 00:20:33.154
would heal.

340
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:33.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

341
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.720
<v 0>They'd be healthier,
you'd have better matches,
they could enjoy themselves more.</v>

342
00:20:38.721 --> 00:20:42.820
I mean,
what the fuck,
how much pain do they got to go through?

343
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.300
Why can they do roads?
Um,

344
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.600
anyway,
so let's,
uh,
let's plot,
you know what?
I got to read a little bit ab one,

345
00:20:51.601 --> 00:20:53.670
one little advertising thing.
One,

346
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.780
one is the loneliest advertising that I ever read was that three dog night.

347
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:06.660
It's funny,
I drink the two dogs special at the juice bar.
All right,
next issue.

348
00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:07.560
Oh,
we got three here.

349
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:09.993
<v 2>All right.</v>

350
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.630
<v 0>Oh,
by the way,
you know,
somebody I t a d d all over the place.</v>

351
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.960
Somebody sent me something really cool word.
Uh,
I was talking about,
you know,

352
00:21:16.961 --> 00:21:19.550
one of my favorite drum records of all time is Jane's Addiction.

353
00:21:19.551 --> 00:21:22.870
Now our ritual de la de la habitual over the fuck you say.

354
00:21:22.871 --> 00:21:26.530
It's one of my favorite drum records of all time.
And uh,

355
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.370
somebody just sent me something called the,
uh,

356
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.410
I don't know the name of the band.

357
00:21:32.411 --> 00:21:36.310
Is the wedding present and the name of the album,

358
00:21:36.311 --> 00:21:38.050
sea monster sea monsters.

359
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:43.000
Now I don't know if this person's just fucking with me or whatever,
but uh,

360
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:47.260
yeah,
if you guys have favorite drum records or whatever,
base records,

361
00:21:47.261 --> 00:21:52.120
get tar records,
anything,
let me know what they are.
Cause uh,

362
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.660
I will download that shit and have a listen to it.
And I was just singing.

363
00:21:55.661 --> 00:21:56.830
Three is a magic number.

364
00:21:56.831 --> 00:22:01.690
You guys don't schoolhouse rock some of this sickest fucking session drummers.

365
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:07.030
Uh,
musicians play on that thing.
Listen to three is a magic number.

366
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:12.190
And listen to the fucking drums.
Listen to how fucking

367
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.410
the tasty licks the guy had groove in his fucking ass off,

368
00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.340
but not overplay it.
Plate perfect for the sock.

369
00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:27.960
I want to listen to her right now.
It's fucking amazing.
Um,
those are,

370
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.990
those are some of my favorite fucking musicians.

371
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:36.380
Are those people that just back up somebody and are absolutely fucking killing

372
00:22:37.021 --> 00:22:41.100
it.
And then they just walk away and you have no fucking Clint Eastwood in those

373
00:22:41.101 --> 00:22:43.980
cowboy movies.
He never had a name.
Right.

374
00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:49.800
Fucking ass.
Anyways,
let me,
yeah,
let's read here.

Don't you hate when somebody speaks for you?

377
00:22:58.450 --> 00:22:58.730
<v 2>Okay.</v>

378
00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.660
<v 0>Uh,
but who has time to sift through all this nonsense on the Internet?</v>

379
00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.650

available anywhere else,
giving you a richer reading experience.

386
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.480
Why do I need to interact with it?

387
00:23:35.481 --> 00:23:38.690
Why don't you write a fucking story worthy that I don't have to have scratch and

388
00:23:38.691 --> 00:23:43.500
sniff?
I've never felt that reading sports illustrated like,
Oh God,

389
00:23:43.501 --> 00:23:47.900

395
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.810
they got this guy out here.
I don't know if they have it around the country.

396
00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:17.030
He's a mattress dude.
Fucking do something or your mattress is free.

397
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.730
I got to give him a shout out.

398
00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:21.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

399
00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.010
<v 0>What the fuck's in Aa?
When I was in Massachusetts,</v>

400
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.590
it was Jordan's furniture.
Jordan's furniture wall.

401
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:34.590
Fam left dodge.
Back Brook,
right.
Or Daniel Webster.
Um,

402
00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.920
they had that and then they had the light and leisure,
the purple building.

403
00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.120
And this guy was trying to do the crazy yeti thing and every time he came on he,

404
00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:42.930
it was,

405
00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:47.930
he was the crazy guy who sold lamps and his thing every time was like,

406
00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:52.530
<v 3>God,
I really did this time.
Oh,
I shit,</v>

407
00:24:52.531 --> 00:24:54.630
why did I order so many labs?

408
00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

409
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:59.180
<v 3>Ah,
fuck.
I gotta get ready.
Thanks man.</v>

410
00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.750
<v 0>Every fucking time.
It's just like,
dude,</v>

411
00:25:01.751 --> 00:25:06.490
why don't you just look around your store and take a little inventory?
Uh,

412
00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.800
the bottom line is a,
you weren't given us a fucking

413
00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.530
<v 1>okay</v>

414
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.200
<v 0>a break on the price.
You were just acting like you were crazy.</v>

415
00:25:14.201 --> 00:25:18.700
And for some reason people let you run a store.
All right.
Zip Recruiter,
uh,

416
00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.630
business owners.

417
00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.790
Did you know that summer's a great time to hire the best people with your

418
00:25:24.791 --> 00:25:27.040
competent?
What'd you competitors on vacation?

419
00:25:27.041 --> 00:25:29.350
There's less competition for quality candidates,

420
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:33.010
but posting your job in one place isn't enough to find them.

421
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.000

He's a cool opportunity I had to share with you.

441
00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:53.770
<v 2>Okay.</v>

442
00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.590
<v 0>Looking both ways.
Driving with Uber,</v>

443
00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.600
Uber's that popular smart phone app that connects right is with drivers.

444
00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:06.730
A lot of people take Uber all the time.
A lot of people love them by the way,

445
00:27:06.731 --> 00:27:10.480
and they just loved chatting with the different drivers and evidently some of

446
00:27:10.481 --> 00:27:14.020
them have really interesting stories to why they drive with Uber.

447
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:18.670
I always though scientists evolution,
they love being there.

448
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.230
That's actually a taxi driver.

449
00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:26.320
A would've stripped thought I didn't want to do that.
I don't know.

450
00:27:26.321 --> 00:27:30.230
John,
I've had for cards out license come.

451
00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.450
They love being their own boss.
They earn great money.
It's easy to start.

452
00:27:34.451 --> 00:27:35.920
You just need a car and a license.

453
00:27:35.921 --> 00:27:38.860
Driving with Uber is great for anyone who needs flexibility.

454
00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:42.070
This is one of the great jobs of all time because they seem to just hire you,

455
00:27:42.071 --> 00:27:46.000
right?
So you know,
if he got a guitar and you want a better guitar,

456
00:27:46.001 --> 00:27:47.500
just start driving people around.

457
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.673
<v 2>You know</v>

458
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:54.430
<v 0>what a better drum kit.
I mean,
I will use this students,</v>

459
00:27:54.431 --> 00:27:56.770
you can make some extra money between classes.

460
00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.580
Now's the prime time to cash in driving with Uber.

461
00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.430
You'll thank me for telling you how to get paid every week.

462
00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.300
I could be getting into your car when you drive with Uber.
Well,

463
00:28:07.301 --> 00:28:09.150
I'll tell you right now,
I won't be sober.
That's for,

464
00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:13.810
that's the only time I take Uber because I'm responsible when I drink.

465
00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:17.230
You got a car and a license.
Put them both to work,
uh,

466
00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.620
for you and start earning serious life changing money today.

00:28:27.461 --> 00:28:31.070
Yeah.
Drive with uber.com.

470
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.980
They just feel like you don't hear it for the first two times.
Do they?
Um,
one,

471
00:28:36.981 --> 00:28:41.720
if that works in your relationship,
bill wants a blow job.

472
00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:47.340
That's bell once a blow job.
Hey though wants a blow job.

473
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:52.390
Why did she say after he ties?
Um,
all right.

474
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:53.650
<v 2>Okay.</v>

475
00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:56.710
<v 0>He's a good line.
I used on my wife the other day.
I was like,
sweetie,</v>

476
00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.730
what are you going to be sick of being sick of me?
She actually laughed and said,

477
00:29:00.731 --> 00:29:01.564
sorry,

478
00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.050
I'm an asshole.
I'm not easy to live with.
All right,
let's um,

479
00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:09.460
<v 2>okay,</v>

480
00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:13.820
<v 0>what the fuck am I here?
What I want to talk about.
Oh,
by the way,
um,</v>

481
00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:18.010
I actually reached out to the nerds on Twitter.

482
00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:19.210
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

483
00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:22.930
<v 0>Seeing if there was any way to,
I saw it.
All of a sudden I have this,
I watch APP.</v>

484
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.270
Like I had a really bad week with my iPhone.

485
00:29:25.271 --> 00:29:27.370
All of a sudden it was just wigging out on me

486
00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:29.590
<v 2>and um,</v>

487
00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:34.470
<v 0>I ended up,
you know,
I couldn't get messages.
I had to keep shutting them down.</v>

488
00:29:34.471 --> 00:29:38.850
I couldn't read my messages,
I couldn't close apps,
all this stuff.

489
00:29:38.851 --> 00:29:40.950
The whole thing was going haywire and I was thinking,

490
00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.890
did I fucking spill water on this thing?
What's going on?
And then somebody,
uh,

491
00:29:45.891 --> 00:29:47.250
over atF is for family families like,

492
00:29:47.251 --> 00:29:50.600
well you have you downloaded the new operating system.
I'm like,
I never do that.

493
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:52.010
It just fills up your phone.

494
00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:55.970
That's how I was able to keep the iPhone for us for fucking

495
00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.513
right.

496
00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.210
I was able to keep it forever cause I never downloaded any of the new shit.

497
00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.920
The phone was more than good enough when it was just the three.

498
00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:08.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

499
00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.400
<v 0>I have no fun.
I would still use a rotary phone with the phone cord.</v>

500
00:30:11.401 --> 00:30:14.460
I don't give a fuck these Goddamn I flew,
I found it like a,

501
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:17.280
a second one to star trek.
I don't need the new one.

502
00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:22.080
So inadvertently by not needing it and not wanting it,

503
00:30:22.081 --> 00:30:26.070
I was able to keep these phones for fucking years until they finally just died.

504
00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:31.480
Um,
but now these fucking apple con,

505
00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:36.930
I guess they figured it out probably cause idiots like me running the Yap about

506
00:30:36.931 --> 00:30:38.380
it on podcasts,
uh,

507
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.550
are new operating system now you like half the downloaded as far as,

508
00:30:41.551 --> 00:30:44.910
and maybe I'm wrong,
I'm reaching out to the nerds here.

509
00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.560
All right.
Is that what's going on here now?
Like they make,

510
00:30:49.561 --> 00:30:53.760
they're forcing you to download the new thing so you fill it up.

511
00:30:53.761 --> 00:30:58.290
So when the iPhone six s or fucking seven comes out,

512
00:30:58.291 --> 00:31:02.880
I have to go get it.
Cause if that's the case,
I'm out.

513
00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:07.170
Cause now I downloaded it.
Now we have the Iwatch APP.
I don't have an Iwatch.

514
00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:10.140
And you know what?
Nobody has a fucking Iwatch.

515
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:15.680
Have you seen anybody that thing fucking bombed?

516
00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:20.460
And I love it.
I love it.
But you know,
I probably for the environment,

517
00:31:20.461 --> 00:31:24.000
it's probably not a good fucking thing because they'll just dump them in the

518
00:31:24.001 --> 00:31:27.300
ocean.
You know what I mean?
Oh,

519
00:31:27.301 --> 00:31:29.610
they'll feed the cows and then you're fucking,

520
00:31:29.611 --> 00:31:33.240
they'll sell them to farmers and they'll feed them the cows and then there'll be

521
00:31:33.241 --> 00:31:34.410
in your burgers or some shit.

522
00:31:34.411 --> 00:31:38.100
Who the fuck knows but it is cause I've always been that guy like,
dude,

523
00:31:38.101 --> 00:31:42.630
we got enough technology.
We're fine.
We're good.
It's too good.

524
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.520
It's too much.
It's too much shit.

525
00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:49.950
We were good right around 95 94 95 was fine.
You know what I mean?

526
00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.870
Fine.
Everything's fine.

527
00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:55.223
<v 1>Okay.</v>

528
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.820
<v 0>And they'll put the new shit cause then you got to throw out the old shit.</v>

529
00:31:59.821 --> 00:32:03.390
It ends up in the ocean enough or our our upgrade.

530
00:32:03.391 --> 00:32:04.830
Just upgrade my fucking phone.

531
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.640
What do I got to go into a new one and then trade that fucker.
Man.

532
00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.910
I hate it and I also don't like how they're gradually forcing me where I don't

533
00:32:11.911 --> 00:32:16.230
have a choice on what the fuck is on my phone because eventually they're going

534
00:32:16.231 --> 00:32:17.760
to force you to use iCloud,

535
00:32:17.761 --> 00:32:22.761
which is so fucking intrusive that these cons want to see my pictures.

536
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:28.320
Am I fucking music and all you fucking dope out there who just like what do you

537
00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:32.170
really think that taking the time,
hello,
you've hung adventure.
It did.

538
00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.790
Did did that,
I can't even speak here.

539
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.340
All of that shit that I said about going into cvs and they're fucking doing

540
00:32:40.341 --> 00:32:45.170
those little savings,
save scan card.
By the way,
I was 100% right about that.

541
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.760
They were taking information from you.

542
00:32:46.761 --> 00:32:48.980
Now they tried to scan your fucking driver's license.

543
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:52.970
Just say no to those people.
I went to the doctor's office,

544
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.010
they go stand over here.
I'm like,
what are you doing?
They go,
well,

545
00:32:55.011 --> 00:32:56.810
we're going to take a picture of you.
I go for what?

546
00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:00.020
They could just share files so we can put a face to the,

547
00:33:00.021 --> 00:33:03.950
it's like we get the fuck away from me.
You creep.
And I was like,
no,

548
00:33:03.951 --> 00:33:07.520
I don't want you to do that.
They're like,
you don't want us to do that?
I'm like,

549
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:11.030
yes,
I don't want you to do that.
And then they go,
oh,
okay.

550
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.520
They try to make it seem like you have to do it.

551
00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:19.510
You know what I mean?
I got to fucking varicose vein.
Who to see my fucking face.

552
00:33:19.511 --> 00:33:24.450
You'd do.
She got my fucking driver's license.
And you got,
you got my,
my,

553
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:28.510
uh,
my credit card.
Well,
what's wrong with you guys?
Everybody's trying to do that.

554
00:33:28.511 --> 00:33:31.390
Cause it's,
it's a new way to make money is what they do is,

555
00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:36.400
is they get in from personal information about you beyond what you're there for

556
00:33:36.401 --> 00:33:39.070
and beyond really in reality what they need.

557
00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:44.290
And then they stock pilot and then they sell it to other people and they make

558
00:33:44.291 --> 00:33:45.970
money off of your information.

559
00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:50.560
And I believe that you should have to ask for that person's consent.

560
00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.940
And then once they give consent,

561
00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:01.080
that person should get a cut or percentage of the selling of their own personal

562
00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:05.440
information.
Shouldn't they?
My nuts.

563
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:07.960
Like if there's money to be made,

564
00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:12.430
no one about what kind of fucking fruit loops or special K on meeting,

565

566

567
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.840
freckle guy just got some fucking shredded wheat.

568
00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:27.460
I don't know what I'm saying.
Whatever I'm out of my fucking mind.

Don't listen to me.
Anyway,

573
00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:45.810

Hey,
by the way,
that fucking,
I,
I've said this before,

574
00:34:45.811 --> 00:34:50.811
I'm gonna tell you to get that fucking men's health grip strength workout that

575
00:34:51.401 --> 00:34:56.020
Bert Kreischer uh,
tweeted at me.
I have to retweet that thing.
Um,

576
00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.770
it's,
that shit is the real deal.

577
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:05.560
I'm on the third exercise with this is the one where you just hang by one arm

578
00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:06.940
with all your body weight.

579
00:35:06.941 --> 00:35:11.200
You just hanging there from a fucking chin up bar Chinet pull up bar and a,

580
00:35:11.201 --> 00:35:13.990
you try to work yourself up to being able to do it for a minute.

581
00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:18.420
I'm up to 25 seconds with the right hand,
20 seconds with the left hand.

582
00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:23.620
And,
um,
I went over to this,
uh,
the place where we were writing,

583
00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.100
editing the show and they have this little mini gym and they had a peg board

584
00:35:27.101 --> 00:35:28.180
there and I'm fucking,

585
00:35:28.181 --> 00:35:32.890
I was fucking horrible with the peg board and I was like,
you know,

586
00:35:32.891 --> 00:35:35.620
I've been doing this grip strength thing,
you know,
climbing the rope and shit,

587
00:35:35.621 --> 00:35:36.760
let me see what I'm doing here.

588
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:41.670
And I was able to at 47 to go all the way up the pegboard and then come back

589
00:35:41.671 --> 00:35:45.000
down.
I didn't try to go,
you're supposed to go up,
go over and come down.

590
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:49.280
And I wasn't able to do that.
So,
uh,
I'm fucking psyched man.

591
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:54.880
That's like,
um,
I dunno.
I know you youngsters can probably do it,
you know,

592
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.440
after a night of fucking booze and,
but when you're 47 that,
you know,

593
00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:00.960
it makes you still feel like you matter.

594
00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:10.950
Ah,
Jesus Christ.
What a fucking sad sack I am.
All right.
Um,

595
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:14.260
that's it.
Thank you guys for listening and have a wonderful weekend.

596
00:36:14.261 --> 00:36:15.850
You constant.
I'll talk to you on Monday.

597
00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:21.373
<v 1>Yes.</v>

598
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.450
<v 4>All right.
There's a lot of question out there about,
you know,</v>

599
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:49.810
things that happen within society,
specialty,
you know,
this,

600
00:36:49.811 --> 00:36:53.260
this is something that I think a lot of white people need because not because

601
00:36:53.261 --> 00:36:57.180
we're more racist than anybody else,
we just get just the,

602
00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:02.210
the consequences of us fucking up is so much harsher than other people because,

603
00:37:02.981 --> 00:37:06.850
uh,
you know,
we are the gold standard when it comes to racist.

604
00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.730
We are in the driver's seat right now.

605
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.490
We have been in the driver's seat for awhile.
Basically.

606
00:37:14.491 --> 00:37:16.860
Meaning that if we are ignorant ass holes,

607
00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.220
it has way more effect than when other people are.
You know,

608
00:37:20.221 --> 00:37:23.880
back in the day when other people were running shit,
that's the thing.

609
00:37:23.881 --> 00:37:28.170
Whoever's on top,
if you think an ignorant,
uh,
that's what,
that's why,
you know,

610
00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.290
if you're on top and you're thinking ignorant shit,

611
00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:34.980
you have to be called on it because,
uh,

612
00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:38.410
just cause he cause the effect that you can have.
You know what a mean.

613
00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:39.990
<v 5>Okay.</v>

614
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:43.770
<v 4>Like if somebody from Bangladesh fucking hates me,
that's such a stupid example.</v>

615
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:47.130
Okay.
That,
that's not a race of people.

616
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.130
I don't even know what Bangladesh's and I gotta be honest with you.

617
00:37:50.131 --> 00:37:51.810
I don't even know if that's a city or a country.

618
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.730
Bangladesh have ever seen that on a the prices,
right?

619
00:37:58.750 --> 00:37:58.891
Yeah.

620
00:37:58.891 --> 00:38:03.891
I to showcase showdown was selling yet a Bangladesh and some white trash person

621
00:38:03.941 --> 00:38:06.280
like myself,
sit,
sit with a confused look on their face.

622
00:38:06.281 --> 00:38:10.270
Like I don't know where that is.
Is that where the terrorists are?

623
00:38:10.271 --> 00:38:14.650
I don't want to go there.
Whatever,
like a Filipino people fucking hate me.

624
00:38:14.651 --> 00:38:16.990
That doesn't affect my life.
It doesn't,

625
00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:20.980
I'm not going to go into a job interview at,
at,
you know,

626
00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:26.250
Walmart is not run by Filipinos.
You know what I mean?
You know,

627
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.020
not saying there's anything wrong.
Filipinos.
Alright.
See,

628
00:38:29.021 --> 00:38:30.430
we'll see what I have to do with those white person.

629
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:33.900
Let's say I'm saying I feel bad about bill paid off because we clear him on,

630
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:37.880
I have never had issues.
I got to have a lab of cafe.
Well fucking all that shit.

631
00:38:37.881 --> 00:38:41.780
You got to go on the Jerry Lewis voice there lady.
Um,
so yeah,

632
00:38:41.781 --> 00:38:45.710
people have questions.
So here we go.
And I think all racist should shy men.

633
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:47.660
The questions that you have,

634
00:38:47.661 --> 00:38:50.430
if you have feelings about a different race of people and you just think you're

635
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:53.720
thinking something funny,
there's nothing malicious,
but is this offensive?

636
00:38:53.721 --> 00:38:56.660
Is it racist?
This is,
this is the new topic.
Okay.

637
00:38:56.870 --> 00:39:01.640
And if you feel that I answer these questions like the ignorant white man that I

638
00:39:01.641 --> 00:39:04.790
am,
call me out on it.
I'm here.
So here we go.

639
00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:09.800
This first one bill,
is it racist to call Indians?

640
00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:15.530
Dibble dabbles.
And I'm talking about the Asian ones,

641
00:39:15.531 --> 00:39:20.470
not native Americans.
Um,
I'm guessing by Debbie.
Deb was,
you mean Buba Dabo.
Oh,

642
00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.780
dupe it though.
But the baby the,

643
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:25.650
but you're saying like that debit Dabu um,

644
00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:31.220
is it racist?
Probably,
but it's fucking funny.

645
00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.650
So that knocks it down a little bit.

646
00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:38.650
This is what I feel that makes something like racist.
It's like,

647
00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.740
like the reason why,
uh,

648
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.090
that one isn't as offensive is because we haven't,

649
00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.890
we never enslaved them.

650
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:53.110
That's the reason why white and black shit is so sensitive is because of the

651
00:39:53.111 --> 00:39:57.160
shift that we did to him.
But we haven't really fuck with those people,
you know?

652
00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:01.610
So
if the black version of that was,
is it,

653
00:40:01.611 --> 00:40:06.400
is it offensive to black people?
Hey man,
mother fucker or whatever.

654
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.090
Yes.

655
00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:11.680
That would be offensive if you did some sort of marking of the way they spoke.

656
00:40:11.681 --> 00:40:12.700
Yes.
That would be,

657
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:18.520
that would be offensive if some CEO was giving a speech and I was driving,
uh,

658
00:40:18.521 --> 00:40:23.521
actually I was having someone else drive my town car and we drove by a group of

659
00:40:24.131 --> 00:40:28.810
a young mother fuckers and uh,
they proceeded to walk forwards again,

660
00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.610
you'd have to apologize.
So I guess,
yeah,

661
00:40:30.611 --> 00:40:33.790
I guess technically Duma Dabo like that would be,

662
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:40.700
that would be offensive.
Is it racist?
Um,

663
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:45.730
this is what I,
I really,
I really,
it's hard for me to say because it had,

664
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.650
it's what's in your heart,
you know,
cause I make fuck I really,

665
00:40:50.651 --> 00:40:54.550
I make fun of everybody,
you know,
I mean,
I play a game out here,
uh,

666
00:40:54.551 --> 00:40:58.300
when someone is make,
let me ask you,
I've got a question for you.
Is this racist?

667
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.460
I have a game out here when I ride around with Nia and she does not approve of

668
00:41:03.461 --> 00:41:06.670
this to keep her in the clear,
she does not approve this.

669
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:11.770
When somebody makes a more chronic move in front of me,
you know,

670
00:41:11.771 --> 00:41:15.880
driving,
you know just makes a fucking horrific move.

671
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:18.880
I play a game called old or Asian

672
00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:21.850
and you have to guess,

673
00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:25.270
wait cause I'm going to pass the person cause I got to see what they look like.

674
00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.210
You know,
whenever somebody does something fucked up,

675
00:41:28.211 --> 00:41:29.890
some comedians do a great joke about that.

676
00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:34.170
You just want to see what the fuck they look like.
Right.
Uh,
that's the game.

677
00:41:34.171 --> 00:41:39.020
Older Asian.
So as I speed up my little hybrid to try to pull parallel to them,

678
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.770
I always say,
what are you saying?
Yeah,
what are you going with all duration?

679
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:45.290
What do you got?
Older Asian.
She goes,
I'm not playing this game.
That's mean.

680
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.050
And then I was gone.
I'm going to go with old and then I pull up,

681
00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:52.070
it's fucking Asian,
you know?
Or Oh I nailed it.
It was an old guy.

682
00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:56.890
So is that racist?
I'm sure it's offensive,

683
00:41:56.891 --> 00:41:59.800
but within the context of my own car,
you know,

684
00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:04.030
I'm not yelling at anybody and I got to admit,
you know,

685
00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.940
there's a lot of truth in the fucking game.
Yeah.
Jesus,

686
00:42:06.941 --> 00:42:11.140
I'm going to have to apologize next week on the podcast.
So I would say that,
uh,

687
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:15.130
uh,
Indian people,
why don't you chime in?
I would say that,
yeah.

688
00:42:15.131 --> 00:42:19.650
That they would find that they would find that offensive.
Um,

689
00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:25.500
is it racist?
Let me see if I can use it in a sentence here.

690
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:31.650
Hey,
uh,
you know,
I called up customer service and,
uh,
you know,

691
00:42:31.651 --> 00:42:35.400
one of those Buba Dub was answered and tried to tell me that his name was Steve

692
00:42:35.401 --> 00:42:38.870
and act like he was in Tucky.
But I,

693
00:42:38.871 --> 00:42:41.720
I know that he was actually an India because what he talked,

694
00:42:41.721 --> 00:42:46.340
he was go with [inaudible] woods.
How can I help you?
Um,

695
00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:52.320
is it racist?
Probably.

696
00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:58.710
You know what,
something bad has to happen between white culture and,
uh,
or,

697
00:42:58.711 --> 00:43:03.160
or western culture in a Indians.
So,
you know what I mean?

698
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:07.630
It's like a,
it's like you're playing a team and there's no rivalry.

699
00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:13.860
Like patriots verse jets this year was like a whites and blacks.

700
00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.710
It was bad.
It was a lot of hate,
you know,

701
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:21.660
but like patriots verse like the Fucking Lions,

702
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:26.460
you know?
Yeah.
There's gotta be some shit targets.
It's knocked out,

703
00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:32.130
but it still hurts if somebody says something mean.
I don't,

704
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:34.140
I really don't.
What the fuck I'm talking about?
All right,

705
00:43:34.141 --> 00:43:35.190
let's move to the next one.

706
00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:40.460
The next one on the new controversial topic on the Monday morning podcast.

707
00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:45.340
Is it racist?
All right,
here we go.
Um,

708
00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:50.820
Bill,
I had an interesting experience today apparently involving me as a racist.

709
00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:55.830
I was walking with two of my coworkers who are both black.
Oh Geez.
Here we go.

710
00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:58.860
Um,
we were going to go get some lunch.

711
00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.950
One of my coworkers who are most of friends with,
uh,

712
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:09.790
did a little high five fist bump shuffle with one of the female sex security

713
00:44:10.461 --> 00:44:12.530
guards at the front desk.

714
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.590
Knowing both of them and how they interact with one another.

715
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:20.480
I kind of made a in passing comment to the tune of man,

716
00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:24.680
you guys in your handshakes while obviously laughing,

717
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:30.100
laughing while obviously laughing at just how choreographed it was in more or

718
00:44:30.531 --> 00:44:33.120
less picturing them in a studio or something,

719
00:44:33.121 --> 00:44:37.650
working out the logistics to get the fucking handshake.
Perfect.
Anyways,

720
00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:42.450
we all laughed and moved on and we got our lunch.
All right,

721
00:44:42.451 --> 00:44:44.880
so nothing wrong yet.
So you're cool with these people.

722
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.810
You made a joke and everybody laughed.
No problems,

723
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:54.090
no problems so far.
Um,
however,
after coming back through secure,

724
00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:55.710
uh,
back through security,

725
00:44:55.711 --> 00:45:00.540
I noticed the security guard stopped me and Kinda had a scowl on her face.

726
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:02.460
I thought she was mad at me for something,

727
00:45:02.461 --> 00:45:07.461
but it turned out she was mad at this other lady who was black because she

728
00:45:08.401 --> 00:45:11.820
overheard my comment and was telling,
uh,

729
00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:16.200
that security guard that she couldn't believe I had the nerve to say something

730
00:45:16.201 --> 00:45:21.120
like that.
And I should be ashamed also to the point where she could,

731
00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:22.003
um,

732
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:26.010
almost to the point where she could actually go complain to the human resource

733
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.780
people because she was offended,
um,
et Cetera,

734
00:45:30.781 --> 00:45:32.130
without even considering that.

735
00:45:32.131 --> 00:45:36.720
Maybe just maybe I was talking about the security guard and my coworker and not

736
00:45:36.721 --> 00:45:38.640
all black people now.

737
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:42.840
It being corporate America in all I'm sure rather than even face the pos

738
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:44.700
possibility of any bad press,

739
00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:48.960
they'd rather just sweep me out the door and completely ruined my re any

740
00:45:48.961 --> 00:45:53.490
reputation I may or may not hold at the company just to save their own asses.

741
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:58.630
I feel I did nothing wrong and had no intentions of ever doing anything wrong.

742
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:59.543
Anything wrong,

743
00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:03.420
I'm not going to go on and on about how I kiss black babies and trying to

744
00:46:03.421 --> 00:46:06.030
rehabilitate inner city schools because I don't,

745
00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:11.210
but I'm certainly not some corn fed rebel flag waving ignorant product of what

746
00:46:11.971 --> 00:46:13.110
might be incest.

747
00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:17.550
I guess my question is do we really have to walk on eggshells when we're just

748
00:46:17.551 --> 00:46:22.551
making casual conversation that just any that just any client can pick apart,

749
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:29.550
select the context that they might think it is in and then start crying foul.

750
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:30.390
Basically.

751
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:33.930
I would have liked to call that woman a cunt and told her to go fuck herself.

752
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:37.620
But let's just say I was already kind of worried about my job.

753
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:43.650
All right,
let's see.
Um,
yeah,
I think this is,

754
00:46:43.651 --> 00:46:48.651
this is the classic one where you were fucking around the other two people knew

755
00:46:49.501 --> 00:46:50.251
you were fucking round,

756
00:46:50.251 --> 00:46:54.720
but then one person decides to get offended and then you have to go on TV and

757
00:46:54.721 --> 00:46:55.381
apologize.

758
00:46:55.381 --> 00:47:00.381
Which personally I think is the wrong move because when you apologize now it's

759
00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:05.880
like you're,
you're admitting that you meant it in a bad way.
I mean,
the apology,

760
00:47:05.881 --> 00:47:06.990
I would do that and say,
look,
you know,

761
00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:09.570
I'm sorry that you didn't understand that I was joking,

762
00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:14.370
but I'm not going to sit here and apologize like I have any sort of ill will

763
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:17.610
come in your way,
you know,
but I,

764
00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:22.500
but just to avoid the problem in the future,
uh,

765
00:47:22.501 --> 00:47:27.150
white people do not use the expression you guys or you people

766
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:32.340
when talking about black people,
that's just it.
It's just not going to,
you're,

767
00:47:32.341 --> 00:47:37.270
you're setting yourself up for someone to get offended.
And,
um,

768
00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.670
there's a weird sort of a push poll going on with that whole law.

769
00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:46.010
You guys and you people thing where,
um,

770
00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:53.120
when somebody white says that there becomes this concern of,

771
00:47:53.341 --> 00:47:58.290
um,
that you're separating.
You're separating like,
yeah,

772
00:47:58.291 --> 00:48:03.270
you know,
you people over there with how you live your lives and where over here,

773
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.540
black people have that weird relationship with white people where they're like,

774
00:48:06.541 --> 00:48:11.060
you know,
can you stop stealing our fucking music and our culture?
Uh,

775
00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:16.070
but then like if something,
you know,
hey,
let's pay the streets,
you know,
well,

776
00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.750
make sure you do it in our neighborhood.
We're all in this together,
right.

777
00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:22.080
All of us together.
You know what I mean?

778
00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:26.280
So it's that weird sort of fucking push pull thing going on.
So yeah,

779
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:31.260
just avoid,
uh,
avoid the whole fucking,

780
00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:35.650
um,
yeah,
you fucked up.
You didn't fuck up,

781
00:48:35.651 --> 00:48:39.550
but you,
you left yourself open for a sucker punch by saying,
you guys

782
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:41.300
<v 1>okay.</v>

783
00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:44.740
<v 4>You know,
uh,
that's,
I guess that that's what it is.
I don't know.
That's,
that's,</v>

784
00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:49.280
that's my,
I basically a white guy telling a white guy how he fucked up.

785
00:48:49.281 --> 00:48:53.660
So black people feel listening to this thing.
Uh,
please,
please help me out here.

786
00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:56.120
Did I basically get it right?
Is that essentially it?

787
00:48:56.810 --> 00:49:00.320
And I know most people wouldn't get offended if,
all right,
so there you go.

788
00:49:00.321 --> 00:49:04.520
That's the new,
that's the new topic.
Is it racist?
And I would love to hear,

789
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:10.190
um,
some honest comments from a non white people about their thoughts.

790
00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:15.710
You know,
the fucked up ones too.
Okay.

791
00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:20.180
Cause I've watched enough spike Lee movies to think that evidently it's just us.

792
00:49:20.181 --> 00:49:23.780
But I've hung around enough people from different races to realize,
oh yeah,

793
00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:25.413
<v 1>but he's like,</v>

794
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:02.290
no,
I like to play a little game

795
00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:05.250
<v 4>well to your Asian or old person driving game,</v>

796
00:50:05.251 --> 00:50:07.530
except my game involves in the evening news,

797
00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:12.780
it's called beaner black guy or crazy ass cracker.
Just to clarify,

798
00:50:12.781 --> 00:50:15.060
I am Hispanic parentheses,
Latino,

799
00:50:15.061 --> 00:50:18.390
Mexican or whatever other dumb ass term someone has come up with.

800
00:50:18.391 --> 00:50:20.490
So saying beaner is okay,

801
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:23.550
see now this is why I wanted to do this segment.

802
00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:27.980
This is the exact fucking reason.
Okay.
He says beaner black and cracker.

803
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.520
All right.
And he goes,
I could save baner because I'm Mexican.
Well there,

804
00:50:31.521 --> 00:50:34.670
why can you say cracker ass cracker,
right?

805
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:38.660
It's cause I'm white and no one gives a fuck about that one.
See what I'm saying?

806
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:44.000
This is something that I learned from doing stand up in front of all different

807
00:50:44.001 --> 00:50:47.300
kinds of people.
That's what I learned.
I learned that everybody basically,

808
00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:50.930
it's not that they're selfish,
they just,
they look out of their own head.

809
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:54.590
You can't help but do that.
So you just see shit from your own perspective.

810
00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:59.420
Like one night I was doing this kick right down at the old Boston Comedy Club in

811
00:50:59.421 --> 00:51:04.050
New York City.
And one of the acts that was going up was this,
uh,

812
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:07.370
was this,
I think I told this story before,
it was a,

813
00:51:07.371 --> 00:51:11.120
it was a comedy team as this Asian Guy and girl.

814
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:14.870
And they went up there and they did this fucking rap.
Okay.

815
00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:18.800
And they went up there and they stuck their teeth out like they had buck teeth.

816
00:51:18.801 --> 00:51:19.521
And then they put,
you know,

817
00:51:19.521 --> 00:51:22.730
those glasses that you can put on those joke ones that make your eyes look
Asian.

818
00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.450
They had though they're Asian and yet they still put those on.

819
00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:29.570
And then the other guy had on,
uh,
uh,

820
00:51:29.571 --> 00:51:34.370
of fake gold chain with a fucking fortune cookie hanging off the thick.

821
00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:38.270
So I'm sitting there looking at it before they're going up going,
oh man,

822
00:51:38.271 --> 00:51:41.810
this isn't going to fly.
This isn't going to fly with this fucking crowd.

823
00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:47.180
This is basically,
uh,
what do you call that shit?

824
00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:50.450
What did,
what was that shit back in the day in old time,
Hollywood,

825
00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:54.230
it was almost like Asian black face.
Like what they were doing was fucking,

826
00:51:54.231 --> 00:51:56.450
was ridiculous.
I was thinking that black people watching it,

827
00:51:56.451 --> 00:51:59.960
we're going to be like,
just all the shit that they've been through.

828
00:51:59.961 --> 00:52:02.260
We look at and be like,
what the,
why are they these fucking,

829
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:05.390
why are they selling out their own fucking race?
This is horrific.

830
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:09.290
This is fucking horrific.
And they didn't,

831
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:14.040
that act went up there and they fucking destroyed and everybody laughed their

832
00:52:14.041 --> 00:52:17.450
balls off.
They thought the fortune cookie thing was fucking hilarious.

833
00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:20.090
And I was just like,
yeah,
that people,
I don't know.

834
00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.740
Maybe it's cause they're shitting on their own race.

835
00:52:21.741 --> 00:52:23.600
What the fuck you supposed to do?
I don't know.

836
00:52:23.601 --> 00:52:27.560
I just found that shit fascinating.
So what does that pertain to?
What the fuck?

837
00:52:27.561 --> 00:52:30.620
I just said,
I don't know if it's cold medicines kicking in.
Let me finish this.

838
00:52:30.621 --> 00:52:35.260
So anyways,
this is basically what this guy does.
He says,
uh,

839
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:39.910
J uh,
just to clarify the deputy.
Okay.

840
00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:42.920
Now this game started because I hate watching the news and no matter what I'm

841
00:52:42.921 --> 00:52:44.510
watching sports center,

842
00:52:44.511 --> 00:52:49.430
usually my wife will want to change it and I'm so naturally being the asshole

843
00:52:49.431 --> 00:52:54.020
that I am.
I had to figure out a way to ruin it for,
um,

844
00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.410
so what I do is turn away from the news whenever they begin,

845
00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:01.940
begin explaining the crimes are events of the day based on the description of

846
00:53:01.941 --> 00:53:05.330
the crime or event and how it was committed or performed.

847
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:10.040
I yell either beaner black guy or crazy ass cracker.

848
00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:13.150
Do that.
And she sounds like a fun fucking game.
Well,

849
00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:17.180
I wouldn't say crazy ass cracker.
I would just say fucking white dude.
Um,

850
00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:21.320
example news report says what I say.
Beaner no,
I wouldn't.

851
00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.850
That's one of the worst ones ever.
Beaner it's got no ring.

852
00:53:26.851 --> 00:53:31.080
It's got no flow.
That must've been a bad day with white people.
You know,

853
00:53:31.081 --> 00:53:35.790
usually we're a lot more creative than that.
Named me after a fucking vegetable.

854
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:39.120
Is it a vegetable?
Is it a fruit?
What the fuck is it?
I know.
Anyways,

855
00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.000
let's plow head example news report.

856
00:53:42.001 --> 00:53:46.950
It says a man was stabbed and I yell out beaner I know it's a beaner because we

857
00:53:46.951 --> 00:53:51.120
Mexicans can't afford guns and still pay for our legal extended family members.

858
00:53:51.121 --> 00:53:53.730
We have living with us and our two bedroom house.

859
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:58.740
If the news report says a drive by shooting,
I yell Black Guy,
come on.

860
00:53:58.741 --> 00:54:00.840
Do I really have to explain the reason behind that one?

861
00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:05.070
And of course if I hear the suspect had body parts of his victims in the

862
00:54:05.071 --> 00:54:08.220
refrigerator,
fucking crazy ass cracker.

863
00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:12.060
It's because of this game that my wife has stopped watching the news altogether

864
00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:15.780
and I now have peace and quiet to enjoy my top plays of the day.

865
00:54:15.781 --> 00:54:19.500
Fixed on sports center.
Well good for you.
Good for you.

866
00:54:19.501 --> 00:54:20.640
And I'll see that's something I don't,

867
00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:23.970
I don't think that that's racist because what,

868
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.330
you don't have any hatred towards any of those groups.

869
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:29.700
What you're doing is you're actually

870
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:31.390
<v 5>okay.</v>

871
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:33.400
<v 4>You don't want to watch the news.
It's fucking depressing.</v>

872
00:54:33.401 --> 00:54:36.640
You want to watch sports and then she puts on a double punch of depressing shit.

873
00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:39.760
And what are you going to do sit there and get depressed?

874
00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:43.420
Or are you going to fucking entertain yourself so you turn it into a fucking

875
00:54:43.421 --> 00:54:48.370
game?
It's actually a a,
you know,
I'm not offended by it.

876
00:54:48.371 --> 00:54:51.400
I think that's fucking funny and there's a lot of truth to it.

877
00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:53.493
<v 5>Okay.</v>

878
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:57.270
<v 4>Um,
oh,
here's a guy responding to,
they did with double.</v>

879
00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:01.680
Is that racist?
Um,
anyways,
so yeah.

880
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:05.490
Indians aren't big white people fans because the British controlled their

881
00:55:05.491 --> 00:55:08.760
country for hundreds of years.
See that once again.
See,

882
00:55:08.761 --> 00:55:12.630
we all can make ignorant statements.
So then you should hate the English.

883
00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:17.280
Why do you hate all white people?
See that we're all just as dumb.

884
00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:21.540
Oh God damn it.
This is,
this is,
this is enjoyable.
All right.
It's plow ahead here.

885
00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.560
Something.
I remember reading about this.

886
00:55:25.561 --> 00:55:27.540
I'm going to give you a vague description of what I remember.

887
00:55:27.541 --> 00:55:30.810
This is classic for my podcast cause nobody knows what the fuck they're talking

888
00:55:30.811 --> 00:55:33.910
about.
See this,
this is how we're all coming together.
Um,

889
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:36.211
yeah,

890
00:55:36.211 --> 00:55:40.740
the British were fucking over the Indian people and Indian people did something.

891
00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:45.990
They finally fucking snapped and they went off and they did something really

892
00:55:45.991 --> 00:55:50.880
violent to,
uh,
some of the British people who were over there,

893
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:54.960
including women and children,
I believe.
And uh,

894
00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:58.290
they went say,
you know,
we'll say one to 10 evil.

895
00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:02.340
They went about five.
And then England said,
Oh yeah,

896
00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:04.260
we'll fucking show you what ego evil is.

897
00:56:04.261 --> 00:56:06.360
And then they came back and they went 15 and they were like,

898
00:56:06.361 --> 00:56:10.230
fucking burning people alive.
They just went around just shooting everybody.

899
00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:15.420
Um,
which is what you have to do when you fuck an occupy a country,

900
00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:18.090
you have to commit fuck a genocide.
That's the only way,

901
00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:20.760
which is why you shouldn't do it.
You know,

902
00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:26.980
<v 0>it's why you shouldn't invade another country because they ain't fucking
leaving.</v>

903
00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:31.150
Fuck it.
Leave and so on.
I don't know what the fuck.
You know what this is like,

904
00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:33.490
that's part of a whole nother big district,
a discussion.

905
00:56:33.491 --> 00:56:34.990
I shouldn't even a fucking brought it up,

906
00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:38.380
but the only occupation I've ever seen that ever fucking work was in this

907
00:56:38.381 --> 00:56:39.214
country.

908
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:43.180
And the reason why it worked was because we weren't leaving and we fucking

909
00:56:43.181 --> 00:56:47.710
committed genocide,
that story.
And I'm not for that on any fucking level,

910
00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:52.920
which is why when I look around the world and I see certain people in certain

911
00:56:52.931 --> 00:56:57.100
areas,
I'm not surprised with what the fuck's going down.

912
00:56:57.101 --> 00:57:01.290
Cause that's what always goes down.
So what always fucking goes down.

913
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:04.310
<v 4>It's fucking the,</v>

914
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:07.270
<v 1>I dunno,
it's fucking,
it's evil.</v>

915
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:18.263
No.

916
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:43.143
Come

917
00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:51.233
on.

918
00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:01.340
<v 4>Speaking of which,
you know,
if you guys realize that right now,
Brett Farve</v>

919
00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:07.910
is getting sued,
sort of the shit,
this is how fucked up the world is right now.

920
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:10.910
Brett Farve is getting sued

921
00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:12.270
<v 5>okay.</v>

922
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:14.410
<v 4>By the,
uh,
by two Massoud.</v>

923
00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:15.850
<v 5>Okay.</v>

924
00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:17.800
<v 4>Because he tried to get,
uh,</v>

925
00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:21.460
some sort of sexual favors afterwards and they're,
they're,

926
00:58:21.461 --> 00:58:22.360
they're suing for that.

927
00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:24.170
<v 5>Okay.</v>

928
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:27.470
<v 4>Do you understand that?
Let me say that just one more time.</v>

929
00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:30.620
Brett Farve is getting sued by a Mizzou tumor.

930
00:58:30.621 --> 00:58:35.230
Susis is that how you said my sue says,
um,

931
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:37.150
mousses um,

932
00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:43.480
tomosynthesis for asking basically to,
to,
uh,
you know,

933
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:46.990
to bang them at the end of it,
they're suing him.

934
00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:51.900
Can you fucking believe that?
I just,
it's just fucking bus that will,

935
00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:52.770
you know what that's like?

936
00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:57.150
That's like me showing a comedy club because I got heckled.

937
00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:03.300
It comes with the job.
There was not any machine,

938
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:07.740
any female must Zeus out there that listens to this podcast.

939
00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:10.500
Are you honestly going to tell me that?

940
00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:15.590
That you've been rubbing guys bags and their legs and the chest and all that and

941
00:59:16.111 --> 00:59:20.160
you've,
no one has ever asked you for a fucking hand job at the end of it,

942
00:59:20.161 --> 00:59:25.090
it fucking comes the territory.
That's like being a cop.
And so when the city,

943
00:59:25.091 --> 00:59:28.360
cause you got shot at all,
right?

944
00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:35.010
You fucking put hot oil all over a guy's body and you rub everything but their

945
00:59:35.561 --> 00:59:40.240
dick.
I mean,
give me a fucking break.
You goddamn Cock teases.
Yeah.

946
00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:42.370
People are going to ask you to rub one out.
Okay?

947
00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:44.500
And if you had a shred of fucking decent,
so you'd do what?

948
00:59:44.501 --> 00:59:47.510
You complete the God damn job.
All right,

949
00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:51.850
because you sign says full body massage.
All right,

950
00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:57.170
last I saw my dick is still part of my body.
All right.
You know what,
they'll,

951
00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:58.290
you don't have a Susan's I liked it.

952
00:59:58.291 --> 01:00:02.490
I liked the fucking quarterback who can't get it done,
you know,

953
01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.860
just always comes up a little bit short.

954
01:00:04.861 --> 01:00:06.660
They should fucking interview them afterwards.
So,
you know,

955
01:00:06.661 --> 01:00:10.560
like what happened in there.
Uh,
you know,
I just didn't,
just didn't get it done.

956
01:00:10.590 --> 01:00:13.950
You know,
it was like right there,
all I do is just reach out,
grab it.
And I just,

957
01:00:13.951 --> 01:00:17.570
uh,
you know,
we didn't want,

958
01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:22.590
we didn't want it as much as they wanted it.
Um,
that's just like,

959
01:00:22.591 --> 01:00:25.860
just,
that's such a classic,
uh,
piggyback lawsuit.

960
01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:30.360
It's like once that first stupid whore,
um,

961
01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:33.890
you know,
gave Brett Farve Shit.

962
01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:38.210
This is very interesting that I've noticed about horse.

963
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:40.430
Once one comes out of the woodwork,

964
01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:43.580
then all of a sudden 20 come out of the woodwork,
you know,

965
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:47.570
and then they always try to paint it as well.
We would too scared.
We were scared.

966
01:00:47.571 --> 01:00:49.040
Fuck you.
You were,

967
01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:53.060
you trying to make money and you're trying to build on the momentum of the other

968
01:00:53.061 --> 01:00:57.980
case.
That's the female version of pulling a train on somebody.
You know,

969
01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:02.600
the guy version is,
you know,
you and 80 of friends,
bang the same girl.

970
01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.940
The female version is,
you know,

971
01:01:04.941 --> 01:01:09.941
you're a fucking whore and you're just waiting for a whore to sue a guy that you

972
01:01:10.191 --> 01:01:14.690
fucking banked and then you fucking,
you,
you draft in right behind their lawsuit.

973
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:17.460
Okay?
You know some of those myths date,

974
01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:22.010
they'll actually come to your house and give you a full body rubbed down with

975
01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.020
oil.
Okay?

976
01:01:24.021 --> 01:01:28.400
And then have the fucking nerve to get upset that you tried to get a hand job at

977
01:01:28.401 --> 01:01:32.360
the end of it.
You know,
give me a fucking break.

978
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:38.230
Why don't you fucking Mizuho's broads man the fuck up it start rubbing one out.

979
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:42.440
Is it that God damn hard,
no pun intended?

980
01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:47.770
Is it that fucking difficult
to just fucking,
you know,

981
01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:54.300
it's like your revenue motorcycle.
That's it.
That's all you gotta do.
Up and down,

982
01:01:54.301 --> 01:01:57.780
up and down with that dead fucking oily in and out.

983
01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:03.670
You want that house on the hill,
sweetheart?
There's a price to pay.
