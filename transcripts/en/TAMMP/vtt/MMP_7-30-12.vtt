00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.880
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:06.480
It's Bill Barth and it's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.510
July 30th,
2012

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.640
20 1212 years past the year of our Lord.

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.010
The year 2000 number that and all the computers were going to crash and everyone

6
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:22.410
was going to run around with their hair on fire

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.320
and what happened?
Nothing.
Oh my God.

8
00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:31.710
It comes in as dry way.
I missed us.

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.710
How many fucking times do they going to cry wolf?

10
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.960
How many times are they going to say that everything's going to fucking end and

11
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:44.130
it never does.
I wanna know.
I want to know.

12
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:48.300
They call be the big three,

13
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.560
the woo,
but songs in my head today,
I don't know why.

14
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.480
Maybe it's because you don't like yourself bill,
and you're sick of the lies.

15
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.480
Maybe it is.
I don't know what.
All I know is I took my dog out for a walk.

16
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.400
She did a four,
which is number two twice.
First one was solid,

17
00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:12.050
second one started to come out like it was going to be,
and then all of a sudden,

18
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.450
right?
Don't want to wait.
Do I?
Do you know what I do?
I do my best.

19
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.490
I do my best to be irresponsible neighbor.

20
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.470
You know,
I saw three people in my neighborhood just sitting in a car and I just

21
00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:30.040
immediately assumed that they were pieces of shit.
They had tattoos,

22
00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:32.860
they were smoking cigarettes,
they just look like scumbags.

23
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.610
And I was sitting at gone,
well they're kind of sort of white,

24
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.050
so that's not racist is it?
But there are real specific kind of white,

25
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.620
like their nationality.
They were 100% of whatever the fuck they were.

26
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.820
And I'll tell you right now,
I didn't like all right.

27
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.530
And my inner old man was starting to come out like,

28
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.080
it's weird when you buy a house,
you just suddenly become really conservative.

29
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.500
Before when I rented,
I didn't give a shit.

30
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:08.070
If there was a homeless guy jerking off on the street,
I thought it was funny.

31
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.680
Look at that guy right outside my window.

32
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:13.650
Who needs cable when that guy's sitting there rubbing one out?

33
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.410
Oh look at a lady running was great.

34
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.560
But once you buy you every fucking little thing,

35
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.340
there's a pot hall down the street.
And you need to be covered.

36
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.110
I did the other day.
That's how old I am.
I called three,

37
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:32.040
one one for the first time in my life to you.
Hey Man,

38
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:36.900
can we help you please now what said?
Yeah,
there's that old guy,

39
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.410
you know,
old people,
Bitch,
old people bitch like that.

40
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:43.380
You already heard the 0.9 times,
you know,

41
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.760
welcome to 301 what can we help you with that there's Pine Hall.

42
00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:51.540
It's still not covered.
I don't know which one you're talking about.

43
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.980
Crazy old man.
Crazy freckle.
The old man bill.

44
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.800
Um,
yeah.

45
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.320
So I'm doing the podcast late today and uh,

46
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.340
you know I am doing it late today cause I recorded one and it wasn't funny and I

47
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:10.180
have a certain level of quality control and they go get some nourishment and at

48
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:13.860
the end of the day I'll do this thing.
Whenever the fuck I damn well pleased.

49
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.680
All right,
so I'll you Twitter.
Can you tcs out there?

50
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.550
If you want to keep fucking writing to me and Bitch Moan and complain and just

51
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:24.490
know this.
I don't give a shit.
You know,

52
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.180
I know why you keep bitching at me because there's this new culture now where

53
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:32.290
you have to apologize for nothing.
Is that what you're waiting for me to do?

54
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:35.950
Do you want me to go on,
on Twitter and issue an apology?

55
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.880
I find it offensive that he calls it the Monday morning podcast and when he

56
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:46.870
records it,
it's his Monday morning and not mine.
I feel it's false.

57
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:50.380
Go Fuck Yourself.
That's what this week was.

58
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:55.150
This was a week of watching people that I'm huge fans of having to apologize or

59
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.460
semi apologize or finesse

60
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.900
for nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Fred Willard,
who doesn't like Fred Willard,

61
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.360
you know,
he allegedly rubbed one out or something,

62
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:14.290
touched himself in a lewd way.
Lewd,
such a great word,
isn't it?

63
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.400
They'd really just sounds like,
what the fuck it is.
Lewd,

64
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.280
you know,
crude.
Anything.
Food is not good.
Right?

65
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.220
Zune.
Is there another word?
Lewd.
Crude mood.

66
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.330
That mood could be off.

67
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.140
Shut up bill when he's trying to do some fucking Seinfeld bit here.

68
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.510
Why does everything that goes who'd,
um,

69
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.410
yeah,
lewd,
Lewd.
Just sounds like it.
Touching your fucking balls.

70
00:04:44.411 --> 00:04:49.411
Doesn't it a lewd act that you'd like come with that sound effect?

71
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.300
Uron up.
The shush backed is be a charged with two counts of a lewd act.

72
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.770
Right.
And you've got to like act it out as you say it.
No.

73
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.420
Well you wouldn't my court,
um,
in my fantasy court that I have,

74
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.861
um,
yeah,

75
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:10.861
Fred Willard allegedly touched himself while watching a porno and he has to

76
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:16.660
fucking issue some sort of state for what?
For,
you know,
first of all,

77
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:18.600
I don't understand what,

78
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.780
why are you apologizing to me or why are you trying to clear the air with me?

79
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.770
I don't care what you do.
Just make a good movie and I'll go see it.

80
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.330
I don't care what you're doing.
Like,
all right,

81
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.520
if you're out murdering people and touch and kids,
yeah,
I have a problem.

82
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:35.830
But if you're rubbing one out,
I don't give a fuck.

83
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.720
Is it or is it not a good movie,
Fred Willard?
If it is,

84
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:45.550
I will go see it regardless of how you empty your balls.
I don't care.

85
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.950
The only reason why I needed to hear him issue a statement would be he should

86
00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:54.610
only issued a statement to the person who owned the meat,
the movie theater,

87
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.640
the guy whose job it is to mop up after the shows and possibly the person that

88
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:03.890
was sitting in front of,
in front of him.
And that only is if,

89
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.620
when Fred climaxes,
he rises to his feet.

90
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.360
Other than that,
what do you,
why?
I don't need to know about it.

91
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:17.960
I don't give a fuck.
I don't care what anybody does.

92
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.490
If you're not hurting somebody,
John Travolta is getting a massage.
He goes,
hey,

93
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:27.380
you want to rub one out there?
Male Massoud and the guy goes,
no I don't.

94
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.250
And then I don't give a shit.
And then what?
I'm not going to see his next movie.

95
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:33.800
If it's good,
I'm going to go see it.
I don't care what that guy does.

96
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.300
It's none of my business.

97
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.650
And I don't think any of that shit is embarrassing or I don't think there's any

98
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:42.710
shame,
you know,
it's not our fault.

99
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.820
Our balls fill up and we got to get rid of it.
You know,

100
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.310
and there's a bunch of different ways to do it.

101
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.910
And if you're not hurting anybody,
I don't see what the problem is.
You know,

102
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.830
I don't,
I don't get why,
why you're apologizing me.

103
00:06:55.831 --> 00:06:58.730
You jerked off to allegedly jerked off to a porno.
I mean,

104
00:06:58.731 --> 00:06:59.630
what are you going to do next?

105
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.470
He's always gotta apologize for playing catch with a baseball.
I mean,

106
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:04.304
that's what,

107
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.520
that's what it's here for me p they make pornos so you jerk off to them.

108
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:08.330
All right?

109
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.570
If you don't want somebody to jerk off and you fucking allegedly jerk off in

110
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:15.440
your movie theater,
don't fucking show pornos.
Why don't you show Spiderman?

111
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.030
Okay.
Yeah,
you go,
there you go.

112
00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:22.880
If he was jerking off while watching Spiderman,
about teens,
is Christ Fred,

113
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:26.720
this kids there,
you know?
And even then,

114
00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:27.950
if he wasn't looking at any of them,

115
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:32.110
if you just was truly turned on by Spiderman or the the chick who was Dayton

116
00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:36.470
pita plaque,
then that's,
to me,
that's his own fucking issue.

117
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.930
You'll go with me,
Fred.
Well,
it,
I'm going to go see your next movie,

118
00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:44.070
whether I think it looks good or not.
What do you think about that?

119
00:07:44.071 --> 00:07:49.040
And I'm going on a little show of solidarity.
I'm sick of fucking this,

120
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:52.700
this whole new,
uh,
this new,
what do they call it?

121
00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:56.980
This new climate now,
this new,
uh,

122
00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.800
petri dish with the fuck is this new atmosphere.

123
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.160
And you know,
I went to one of those chemical bars the other night,

124
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.370
wasn't drinking and I went there and it was one of those things with a fucking,

125
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.220
you know,
it's like a chemistry thing.

126
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.730
This guy's got a paintbrush out and he's painting the inside of a glass.

127
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.520
Then he likes something on fire,
blows it out,

128
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:20.810
puts the smoke into the glass and then pours the drinking and everybody would

129
00:08:20.811 --> 00:08:25.790
then drinks and it's like,
oh my God,
this is the love the movie.
I don't buy it.

130
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.280
I couldn't taste,
I mean,
my sense of taste and smell is kind of bad.
But I,

131
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.000
to me it just seemed like that dude on green acres,
you know,

132
00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:38.420
when he would come up with some hunk of Shit and like just a rusted out radiator

133
00:08:38.421 --> 00:08:42.040
and be like,
this is a gene you learn.
Uh,

134
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.980
but soon from Rio,
I mean,
just see which just make up shit.

135
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:51.260
This guy basically was trying to say that he takes an apple and he sucks the

136
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:52.370
atmosphere out of it.

137
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.430
Does he literally said that and like Colorado or I didn't know what the fuck he

138
00:08:56.431 --> 00:09:01.431
was talking about and he tells you this fucking story that is so heavy on the

139
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:04.530
chemistry.
You can't help but feel like a fucking idiot.

140
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:09.450
So by the time he dips the straw in it and gives you a chance to taste it,

141
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:13.740
it's like that moment when you're in a fancy restaurant and somebody gives you a

142
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.500
pours a glass of wine and it's that,

143
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:19.650
that you know is you're swirling it around acting like you can taste the

144
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:23.610
difference between a $90 in a fucking $4 bottle of wine.
I can't,

145
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.740
I have never drank wine.
And Ben like,
yeah,
you know,
no,

146
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.950
now it's fucking wine.
It tastes like wine.

147
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.470
I don't have that sophisticated level POW.

148
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.200
So by the time this guy got done explaining,

149
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:40.050
sucking the atmosphere out of an apple,
it's like at this point,

150
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.580
it's almost like if you say it tastes like a God damn,

151
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:50.550
you know what it tasted like?
It tasted like a,
you know,
like homemade popsicles,

152
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.413
you know,
awful.

153
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.650
Or when you have a popsicle and it kind of melted a little bit and is that the

154
00:09:55.651 --> 00:10:00.651
gooey shit is on the inside of the wrapper and for some reason you,

155
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.860
you,
you,
you lick the wrapper.
Just how fucking gross.

156
00:10:03.861 --> 00:10:07.530
So that made it tasted like that level of sweet and everybody was just taking

157
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:11.310
the straws,
just taken it and they're like,
oh my God.
And I was like,

158
00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:15.810
either I'm a fucking moron or this is like the emperor's new clothes because

159
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:21.320
this shit is just,
it tastes like a popsicle.
Um,

160
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.470
was that story worth telling?
I don't know.
Looking back,
maybe not.

161
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.060
But looking forward,
um,
a buddy of mine,

162
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.830
standup comedian was involved in a scandal,
air quotes.

163
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:39.600
You know what he was doing?
He was in a comedy club trying out new jokes.

164
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.020
Can you believe that?
What the fuck was he thinking?

165
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.940
People d does anybody out there understand that?

166
00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:51.630
You have no right to get offended when you,
when you as a,
as a,

167
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:56.700
an adult makes the free choice to go into a comedy club.
All right?

168
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.880
You don't have a right to be offended.
You don't,

169
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.850
you don't.
All right.
You just,
the second you walk in there,

170
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.530
everything is fucking free game.
That's what it is.
All right.
That's,

171
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.780
it's not like you hired a comedian to do a private party and you gave them a

172
00:11:15.781 --> 00:11:20.070
list of shit of subjects that you wanted him to stay away from him or her and

173
00:11:20.071 --> 00:11:23.580
that comedian agreed to it.
Now,
if that's the case,
you're paying them and said,

174
00:11:23.581 --> 00:11:24.210
hey,

175
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:29.210
don't bring up a fucking cheese whiz and the person does a bit on an agrees to

176
00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:32.430
not do it and then goes up there and does that exact thing then yeah,

177
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:34.280
not only do they owe you an apology,

178
00:11:34.281 --> 00:11:37.200
you shouldn't even fucking pay him cause they,
they voided out the contract.

179
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.820
But in a comedy club,
you didn't hire those comedians.

180
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:46.050
You decided to go down there and watch comedians try out material,

181
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.110
give you their best shit,
give something that kind of works.

182
00:11:49.111 --> 00:11:52.500
Throw some shit against the wall.
That's our house.
That's our Dojo.

183
00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:56.880
You're not entitled to a fucking apology.
Um,
I thought that was the most read.

184
00:11:56.881 --> 00:11:59.830
They have to have two people bitching about that.
Dan Cook joke.

185
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.570
It's like they don't even,
didn't even get the joke.

186
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.950
The joke was not making fun of the victims in Colorado.
It was using that as a,

187
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:07.390
as a,
as a,
as a reference.

188
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.840
He was talking about how bad he thought the new Batman movie was.

189
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.810
So right out of the gate,
half the people didn't even get what the fuck.

190
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:16.240
And joke was about.
And then secondly,

191
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.500
Dane didn't film himself and then upload that onto the Internet.

192
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.940
Somebody in the crowd did.

193
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:23.763
<v 1>Right.</v>

194
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.030
<v 0>So why does he have to apologize?</v>

195
00:12:27.031 --> 00:12:32.031
He told that joke in La and they tell you at the beginning of the show,

196
00:12:32.371 --> 00:12:34.350
do not videotape the comedians.

197
00:12:34.351 --> 00:12:37.440
Please do not videotape the comedians and the person videotapes them.

198
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:42.580
And by the way,
I heard the crowd laugh,
joke sounded like it did all right.

199
00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.880
Wasn't a complete joke.
It's just,
you know,

200
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.060
something he's working on and some of the best material comes out of that

201
00:12:48.061 --> 00:12:48.451
material.

202
00:12:48.451 --> 00:12:53.430
So he has to basically apologize for building a new hour of material.

203
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.340
You know,
I don't get that.
You don't,

204
00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:01.440
and I don't think that comedian should apologize.
I think it's absolute bullshit.

205
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:06.090
And um,
look,
there's all different kinds of comedy.
Does dark comedy,

206
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.940
there's this absurd,
there's blue,

207
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.990
this squeaky clean and it's like music.
There's all different kinds of music.

208
00:13:12.991 --> 00:13:15.870
Go gravitate towards the shit that you like.
But like,
you know,

209
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:19.440
if some asshole in the crowd films a comedian in a comedy club,
our house,

210
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:25.520
our Dojo and puts it up there if you've got a fucking problem with,
uh,

211
00:13:25.521 --> 00:13:26.191
it being there,

212
00:13:26.191 --> 00:13:29.160
talked to the person who videotaped it because I think that's the only person

213
00:13:29.161 --> 00:13:31.470
that needed to apologize.
All right.

214
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.220
He should apologize for Dane for taking taping his act and then he should

215
00:13:35.221 --> 00:13:38.640
apologize to anybody.
Uh,
you know,

216
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:45.140
I guess who fucking saw this new joke that Dane didn't put on a special or do on

217
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.050
fucking Letterman.
It's the stupidest fucking thing on the planet.

218
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:55.650
Go Fuck Yourself.
And you know what kills me is when you apologize,

219
00:13:55.651 --> 00:13:56.080
you're actually,

220
00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.890
I feel like that's an admission then you're saying the other person was right.

221
00:13:58.891 --> 00:14:02.100
Like,
yeah,
I meant that in a malicious way.
You know?

222
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:06.150
Like what kind of a more on watch that joke and actually thought that Dane was

223
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.770
actually supporting what that's psycho did in Colorado.
You know what I mean?

224
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:16.410
Who,
who,
who is that fucking stupid,
you know?
Yeah.
I don't know.

225
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:18.031
And like I said,

226
00:14:18.031 --> 00:14:21.030
at the end of the day he just told the joke in the comedy club and the crowd

227
00:14:21.031 --> 00:14:23.550
laughed.
That's what kills me on all of these.

228
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:28.670
The crowd fucking laugh I've wrote on Twitter were to quote myself here too.

229
00:14:30.051 --> 00:14:33.510
They have to have and just just have a new level of arrogance on this podcast,

230
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.060
you know,
after the last one.

231
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:37.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

232
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.980
<v 0>Was it Tasha I think was the last one is the philosophical question is if a</v>

233
00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:46.981
comedian tells a joke in a comedy club and the whole crowd laughs except for one

234
00:14:47.981 --> 00:14:52.520
person.
Is it really a national news story?
You know,

235
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.280
cause that's another thing too is I feel like that's just like,

236
00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.240
it's like a good way to kill five minutes on a newscast where you can just say

237
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:04.430
that there's outrage where there was no outrage,
there was no outreach,

238
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.970
there wasn't.
If there was like truly outrage,

239
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.150
you were heard it after he told the joke,
you would heard people yelling out,

240
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:15.520
groans,
moans.
You would have heard that you didn't,
you heard a [inaudible].

241
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.040
The joke got a decent laugh.
That was it.

242
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:22.620
And then he moved onto the next one.
It's,
I mean,

243
00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.680
is that don't stand ups going to be,

244
00:15:24.681 --> 00:15:26.120
now you're gonna have to just sit there and be like,

245
00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:30.620
I'd like to apologize to anybody who is lactose intolerant.

246
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:35.510
I should have chosen my words more carefully.
Go Fuck Yourself.

247
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.420
Right.
Am I at,
in my mind,
I uh,

248
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.620
I dunno.
It's a whole new world,

249
00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.380
whole new world of fucking snitches just out there.

250
00:15:47.381 --> 00:15:51.310
Just trying to get people in trouble.
All right,
well here's something for you.

251
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.700
Eat voice everybody.
Would you like to have a,

252
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:59.140
would you like to have your cell phone ring but have people not know what your

253
00:15:59.141 --> 00:16:02.920
real number is?
You know,
wouldn't you like to get like have a cell phone,
right?

254
00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:05.710
And only your friends and family knew the real number to it.

255
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.950
And then you could come up with these virtual phone numbers that people could

256
00:16:08.951 --> 00:16:11.080
dial the,
but weren't really your phone number,

257
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:15.810
but your cell phone would still ring.
Would you be into that?

258
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:19.680
Would you be into a service like he voice that will allow you to do that?

259
00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:24.330
And off these,
these virtual phone numbers,
you could actually,
a,

260
00:16:24.331 --> 00:16:28.800
you could do conference calling on your own new business and on the conference

261
00:16:28.801 --> 00:16:33.150
call a feature where you could have actually up to 95 people for each extension.

262
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.020
It's incredible.
It's basically,
it's a business phone number that will,

263
00:16:37.021 --> 00:16:40.080
that will ring on your cell phone.
Okay.

264
00:16:40.081 --> 00:16:41.580
Without anybody knowing your personal one,

265
00:16:41.581 --> 00:16:45.270
which gives you the option of knowing whether it's a business one or a personal

266
00:16:45.271 --> 00:16:48.750
one and not answering it and whatever.
It's absolutely perfect.

267
00:16:48.751 --> 00:16:53.460
It's an amazing thing.
Um,
they offer an entire service where you can,

268
00:16:53.461 --> 00:16:58.230
uh,
free local managing of outgoing calls.
This is all,
all the,

269
00:16:58.231 --> 00:17:03.150
uh,
this is all the,
the,
the,
the,
what are the options?
Can't even think this week.

270
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.230
Uh,

271
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:08.970
mobility all calls forwarded to a number slash people don't have to know your,

272
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.440
uh,
your personal phone number,
virtual numbers.
So long as you have a real number,

273
00:17:13.441 --> 00:17:16.410
you can give out fake numbers,
but it rings on your own number.

274
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.710
And if you don't pick up on your business,
uh,
your,
your new virtual,
um,

275
00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.320
phone number,
they actually have professional accents,

276
00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:30.300
a professional,
a voice actress to give you any,
any sort of like,

277
00:17:30.301 --> 00:17:31.200
like an outgoing message.

278
00:17:31.201 --> 00:17:34.490
Like if you wanted to give the illusion that your business is bigger than it is,

279
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.760
you have a bunch of employees.

280
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.730
One of the options that they have is that you can actually have,

281
00:17:38.731 --> 00:17:39.331
like I personally,

nowhere I got it.
I had to write down my fucking cell phone number.
And,

301
00:18:50.331 --> 00:18:53.750
the guy worked at Eva's called me up.

359

You know,
who do I have to Apollo?

The uh,

360
00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:14.640
reading out loud,
anonymous
foundation,
whatever the fuck it is.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.280
Have you noticed that they only go after?

362
00:22:17.281 --> 00:22:19.620
They only try to make really successful.
I'll apologize

363
00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.610
because God knows I've said enough shit on this podcast.

364
00:22:23.611 --> 00:22:27.120
Have an eye that at some point should and I have to issue an apology,

365
00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.200
you know?
I don't know.
That's why I like,

366
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:34.530
I like my life is no one's dependent on me.

367
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:39.180
I go out and do stand up.
No biggie,
right?
It's just me.

368
00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.960
I do this podcast.
It's just me.
If I fuck this up,

369
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:44.460
I just fucked myself over.

370
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:49.320
But either way you can't stop me from doing either one of these,
you know,

371
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.230
maybe it could affect the amount of listeners.

372
00:22:52.231 --> 00:22:55.320
I have amount of people come out to my shows,
but I'm not motivated by money.

373
00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.780
You know,
as you can tell by my wardrobe,

374
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.900
my motivation is I don't ever want to have somebody telling me what I have to
do.

375
00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:12.000
You know,
a get over there and pick up that boy.
You go fucking pick it up.

376
00:23:12.001 --> 00:23:14.730
You can't.
You know,
I always hated that.

377
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.540
I don't like having a boss.
So that was my dream in life,

378
00:23:18.541 --> 00:23:22.260
not having a boss and I don't.
So you can do it yourself.

379
00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.230
Get your fucking ass out of your cubicle.
All right.

380
00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:30.260
Get yourself a virtual phone number and he voice and get yourself incorporated

381
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:35.640
or trademark your invention@legalzoom.com right there.

382
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:40.650
I gave you the tools,
you know,
I'll shut up bill.
All right,
I'll shut up.

383
00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:42.600
Um,
oh,
by the way,
speaking of Dane Cook,
let's,

384
00:23:42.601 --> 00:23:47.480
let's talk about some positive Dane Cook News.
Um,
Dane sent me an email.

385
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.600
All right,
I'm in his circle,
not bragging.

386
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.410
He mentioned that he was going to be at the Hollywood bowl performing in the

387
00:23:54.411 --> 00:23:57.470
musical,
the producers.
And he said,
come on down if you want to.

388
00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.280
So I was in that dilemma where I loved Dane.
But I,
I'm not a fan of musicals.

389
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:05.390
Um,
I'm just not a fan of them.

390
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.380
And that goes by just,
you know,
you know,

391
00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:12.140
it's fucking bullshit as I went and I saw one and I actually enjoyed it,

392
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.220
but that's just one of those guy things you can't say that you're a fan of and

393
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.360
musical,
you know.
So I went down there like,
all right,

394
00:24:17.361 --> 00:24:19.850
I gotta support thing so I'm gonna go to hell thing.
It was fucking hilarious.

395
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:24.140
It was at the Hollywood bowl and uh,
unbelievable performances.

396
00:24:24.141 --> 00:24:27.290
And I would tell you something right now.
Dane absolutely fucking killed it.

397
00:24:27.291 --> 00:24:30.710
I wish I had an nia down here cause I'm friends,
you know,
you think,
oh,

398
00:24:30.711 --> 00:24:33.470
you're friends with them so you just going to say that.
No,
he fucking killed it.

399
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.730
And I was so proud of them and I was sitting there watching it,

400
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:43.780
remembering all these hell gigs we did like 20 years ago at like fucking this

401
00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:51.090
pub.
Kelly's was the first time I think I saw Dane or maybe at this comedy club,

402
00:24:51.091 --> 00:24:55.040
stitches.
I mean half the half the gigs.
I like the first 200 gigs I did.

403
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.870
Half of them were done in places where it wasn't a comedy club and most of the

404
00:24:59.871 --> 00:25:03.080
crowd didn't even know that there was going to be a show and we'd always be in

405
00:25:03.081 --> 00:25:07.610
the corner.
I remember it'd be me,
Dane,
Al Del,
Benny,
Bobby Kelly,

406
00:25:07.611 --> 00:25:08.660
Patrice O'Neil,

407
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.600
all the guys I started and we'd just be huddling over in the corner,

408
00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:12.890
just gone out of this is going to suck.

409
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:14.450
This is going to just go eat a bag of dicks.

410
00:25:14.451 --> 00:25:16.430
That was like one of the first comedy expressions I learned.

411
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.730
This is going to suck a big bag of fucking elk dick,

412
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.480
and you would just sit there and watch your friend go up there and just

413
00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:26.510
absolutely just humiliation.

414
00:25:26.511 --> 00:25:31.130
Just standing there trying to make people laugh who aren't listening and don't

415
00:25:31.131 --> 00:25:35.120
want to fucking show and just taking those fucking lumps.

416
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:40.100
And I remember Dane would just was always would go full out,

417
00:25:40.101 --> 00:25:40.970
totally commit.

418
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.110
And when I was watching him in that show last night,

419
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:46.880
I was seeing all these little,

420
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.330
little subtle things that I used to see him doing all his hotel rooms than it

421
00:25:50.331 --> 00:25:54.770
was fucking great.
And I said,
what's up to him in the end?
And when I walked out,

422
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.620
it was hilarious.
Was One of the leads in it,
is that red headed dude with the,

423
00:25:59.621 --> 00:26:03.800
with the beard on modern family.
The guy was hilarious and he was,

424
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:05.740
he was great in this musical too.
And uh,

425
00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.700
when I walked out it was fucking hilarious.

426
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:10.510
I see this guy look kind of tilts his head to the side.

427
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.300
He got excited looking at me as I'm walking out and then his face dropped and I

428
00:26:14.301 --> 00:26:18.690
was like,
you know,
my ego,
I'm thinking,
oh,
he recognizes me as a comedian and uh,

429
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.530
I can't confirm this,
but I think he thought I was that dude

430
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.530
from a distance.
He thought I was that guy on modern family.

431
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:31.160
And then when he saw me and my hairline,
he's like,
oh,
that's,
that's not him.

432
00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:36.980
That's just some jackass with a beard.
Um,
oh,
it wasn't that sad.
Hey,

433
00:26:36.981 --> 00:26:40.190
I got a drum question for Y'alls,
uh,
for the drummers.

434
00:26:40.191 --> 00:26:42.190
Any drummers who listened to this?
Um,

435
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:46.080
I can't decide on this one.

436
00:26:46.081 --> 00:26:48.900
That song by Van Halen main streets.

437
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.480
Does Alex play that?
The high hat?
Does he play it with two hands or with one?

438
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.730
I saw him live in concert.

439
00:26:56.731 --> 00:27:00.120
He played it with two and then I watched the video the other day and he played

440
00:27:00.121 --> 00:27:04.820
it with one.
Uh,
but he wasn't playing straight sixteenths.

441
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.270
But when I listened to it on the album,

442
00:27:06.271 --> 00:27:09.640
it sounds like it's straight sixteenths cause somebody please help me with that

443
00:27:09.641 --> 00:27:11.260
because I'm working,
working,
getting back to the,

444
00:27:11.261 --> 00:27:14.820
the push pull thing with the stick,
trying to get it up to speed.

445
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:18.570
And how do you do that?
Why listen to Lenny Kravitz?
Uh,

446
00:27:18.571 --> 00:27:23.550
it ain't over till it's over.
And then I listened to what's his face?
Uh,
uh,

447
00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:27.960
Bill withers use me and I just keep,

448
00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:33.100
I play up to temple with each hand and each day can play a little bit longer,

449
00:27:33.631 --> 00:27:36.960
but I pay attention to the fact I don't want my forearms burning because if they

450
00:27:36.961 --> 00:27:40.080
are,
then I'm not doing it right.
You know,
for years that you aren't,

451
00:27:40.081 --> 00:27:44.160
aren't drummers,
one of the things your problem you have is uh,
you know,

452
00:27:44.161 --> 00:27:45.450
if you have great technique,

453
00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:50.160
you can effortlessly play the drums and you don't have to deal with carpal

454
00:27:50.161 --> 00:27:54.270
tunnel or any fucking injuries or any of that shit.
So sorry,

455
00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.610
that was my own little thing.
And speaking to that,
I want to start,

456
00:27:56.611 --> 00:28:01.020
I want to start making some drum covers and upload them onto youtube

457
00:28:01.021 --> 00:28:05.190
anonymously.
You guys will never find them,
so good luck to you.
But I,

458
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.690
I'm using that I movie 2012 and I don't obviously know,

459
00:28:09.691 --> 00:28:12.960
can film myself and upload myself,
but I don't know how to,

460
00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:17.940
how do you drop the music in?
You know what I mean?
So you hear my drums,

461
00:28:17.941 --> 00:28:19.920
plane,
you know,

462
00:28:19.921 --> 00:28:24.210
it's like I shoot the video and all you hear is me playing the drums to whatever

463
00:28:24.211 --> 00:28:25.044
song.
Right?

464
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:29.460
And then what I want to do is drop in the audio of the song and like obviously

465
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:32.880
have an instinct to me playing the drums because I just want to see what kind of

466
00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.550
reviews and when to get,
cause if I put it up there and it's me,
first of all,

467
00:28:35.551 --> 00:28:40.350
it's going to look cheesy and then second of all it's going to be,
I dunno,

468
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.440
I want people looking at,
I want people watching it.

469
00:28:43.441 --> 00:28:46.350
Like this guy actually wants to try and make it as a drummer because I want

470
00:28:46.351 --> 00:28:49.310
honest criticism.
And then I will,

471
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.680
I'm not going to tell you where they are on Youtube,

472
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:56.760
but I will read you the worst comments.
How about that?
Is that fair?

473
00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.480
That'll be good for some comedy.
All right.
Okay.
Here we go.

474
00:29:00.481 --> 00:29:05.400
Response to Penn state should keep their wins.
Last week I talked about,
uh,

475
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:09.240
you know,
obviously I agreed with every,

476
00:29:09.241 --> 00:29:12.870
every punishment that came down on Penn state except for the,
uh,

477
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.180
I just thought them losing their victories.

478
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:20.180
I just felt like that punish the players and the fans and the fans and the

479
00:29:20.281 --> 00:29:22.290
players were 100% innocent.

480
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:28.160
And this guys who's NFL dreams died because they blew out their knee in a game

481
00:29:28.801 --> 00:29:31.020
that they won and now you're going to take that away from them.

482
00:29:31.021 --> 00:29:34.830
And I just feel like,
uh,
it just seemed like it went above and beyond.

483
00:29:34.831 --> 00:29:37.050
So this guy says,
Bill,
in response to your,

484
00:29:37.051 --> 00:29:40.590
your view that Penn state shouldn't have to forfeit the winds.

485
00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:45.420
Should Germany have been allowed to keep the countries they conquered in World

486
00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:49.960
War II?
No.
I like when people ask me a question like,

487
00:29:49.961 --> 00:29:52.690
and I think that they want my opinion,
but they just answer it themselves.

488
00:29:52.691 --> 00:29:57.580
So he says no,
when we kicked their fucking axe ass is we took away their land,

489
00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:01.240
took away their army and place sanctions on them.
We didn't say,
hey,

490
00:30:01.241 --> 00:30:04.270
Hitler's dead.
So why should we punish the rest of you?
Germans,

491
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.530
we made a fucking example out of them and we need to do to do the same thing to

492
00:30:08.531 --> 00:30:11.140
Penn state.
Not all the Germans were Nazis.

493
00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:14.770
Not all the players did anything wrong.
Did anything wrong,
dude?

494
00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:18.740
None of the players did anything wrong.
What fucking,

495
00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:24.180
what Internet do you have?
What,
what TV shows are you watching?
Um,

496
00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:29.030
if they have a problem,
go immigrate to another university where wins.

497
00:30:29.031 --> 00:30:31.670
Count enough with the poor me.
Bullshit.

498
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:35.660
Your Supreme Holier Than Thou ruler fucked up big time.

499
00:30:35.661 --> 00:30:39.530
Fuck him and all you queer lions.
So there you go.
You know what sir?

500
00:30:39.531 --> 00:30:42.370
You were starting to make a point there and then in the end,
you,
you,
you,

501
00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:43.190
you end up,

502
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:47.690
you know that that's like a typical inner internet point.

503
00:30:47.691 --> 00:30:50.960
You start to make a point and then you either say something racist or homophobic

504
00:30:50.961 --> 00:30:54.260
in the end.
Uh,
first of all,
I disagree with that analogy.

505
00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.310
Um,
because that analogy,

506
00:30:58.311 --> 00:31:03.311
you're suggesting that the Penn state players were Joe Paterno was army and that

507
00:31:05.151 --> 00:31:09.860
they were in the know and Joe Paternal was Hitler and the people in the army

508
00:31:09.861 --> 00:31:13.340
were,
they knew what the fuck he was doing and they helped him.

509
00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.940
They helped him do it,
which they didn't.
They didn't.

510
00:31:16.941 --> 00:31:21.200
They would just playing football games.
All right.
And,
uh,

511
00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:26.270
should Germany had been allowed to keep the countries they conquered in World

512
00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:31.160
War II?
Well,
I wore is like a game dude.
That's a game.
All right.

513
00:31:31.161 --> 00:31:34.550
And they won the first half and they lost the game.
So no,
they shouldn't be.

514
00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:36.020
But uh,

515
00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:40.310
they did conquer France and that is in the history books.

516
00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:45.560
They fought France and world war two and they beat them.
That victory counts.

517
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:51.260
They conquered Poland,
they conquered the fucking Netherlands.

518
00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:52.610
They lost in England.

519
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:58.580
They lost to the Russians and they lost to us.
So right there,

520
00:31:58.581 --> 00:32:00.470
off the top of my head,
they were three and three.

521
00:32:00.471 --> 00:32:04.310
They conquered a Norway with the help of Sweden.

522
00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.960
Right.
All,
all those wins and losses count,
sir.

523
00:32:08.961 --> 00:32:12.020
So I don't know what you're saying.
Like that point doesn't make any sense.

524
00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:15.260
And the fact that the NSC,
you're all,
uh,
all,
you know,

525
00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:17.060
fuck him and you're queer lions,

526
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.870
that basically sounds to me like you're a fan of a team in the big 10,

527
00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.870
or maybe you like one of them southern coaches that had,
you know,

528
00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.940
more wins than Joe Pos.
So,
uh,
I agree to disagree,
sir.

529
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.260
And,
um,
you lose points on your,

530
00:32:33.261 --> 00:32:36.500
your hacky example of Germany and the Nazis.

531
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:39.680
It always comes down to that no matter you do,

532
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.610
I pick up my dog shit and I throw it in somebody else's trashcan and they go,

533
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:46.730
could you please
it's trash.

534
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:50.690
You worried that I'm going to make your trash thank you know.

535
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.790
And then they'll say something.
Well,
did hint when Hitler,
it isn't,

536
00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:59.540
it isn't like when Hitler,
it isn't,
it isn't.
Okay.

537
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:02.360
You should have gone like John Wayne Gacy there.

538
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:06.920
That's what I would have gone anyways.
All right.
Female roommate.
How to bill.

539
00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.400
You said howdy some reading all of this and a southern accent.

540
00:33:10.401 --> 00:33:13.030
I could use some advice,
uh,

541
00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:17.090
out of 27 year old Guy Leonean and apartment.
And Eh,

542
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.100
with a 19 year old girl.
She did Lou in a couple weeks ago,
a couple months ago.

543
00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.690
Uh,
we've been getting along great.

544
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:27.560
But over the past few weeks she's mentioned her sex life a couple of different

545
00:33:27.561 --> 00:33:30.560
times.
Mentioned how she loves to give head.

546
00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:38.840
Could it be the most perfect rule made in the world?

547
00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:44.200
Uh,
you're the reason that God made a Ho.

548
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:48.140
All right,
so she likes suck and Dick.
Okay,

549
00:33:48.141 --> 00:33:52.960
I see nothing but sunshine so far.
Where,
where,
where's the rain coming?

550
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:53.241
Here we go.

551
00:33:53.241 --> 00:33:57.320
And just the other day she mentioned out of the blue that she posed for some

552
00:33:57.321 --> 00:34:02.180
nude pictures.
Oh.
And she has no problem with nudity.
All right.

553
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:06.380
That's a major caution flag there.
Anybody who takes nude photos or is in the,
uh,

554
00:34:06.381 --> 00:34:10.280
the porn industry.
Yeah.
You got to watch out there.
That's a ticking time bomb.

555
00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.920
Oh Gee.
She's what happened and was it your uncle?
Was it the guy down the street?

556
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:20.210
Who Was it?
Uh,
she seems to basically say everything she thinks.

557
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:22.100
Uh Oh.
She basically said,

558
00:34:22.101 --> 00:34:25.610
it seems to say everything that she thinks will get a rise out of me.
Rise.

559
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:29.120
You get it.
That's what he said.
He put that in parentheses.
All right,
here we go.

560
00:34:29.121 --> 00:34:31.280
At first I didn't know how to approach the situation,

561
00:34:31.281 --> 00:34:34.730
so I just ignored her when she tried to steer the conversation towards sex,

562
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.940
but she seemed to do this repeatedly and I had enough with it and I came onto

563
00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:44.000
her and told her that I wanted to see the pictures and then joke with her that

564
00:34:44.001 --> 00:34:47.600
it was for artistic reasons.
Um,

565
00:34:47.601 --> 00:34:51.680
she seemed shocked that I'd asked such a question.
Oh,
here she goes,

566
00:34:51.681 --> 00:34:56.210
going to yank the rug out.
And she joked with me and called me a creeper.

567
00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:01.040
She seemed to flaunt her sexuality in front of me and say,
I'll open.

568
00:35:01.041 --> 00:35:03.680
She is with everything.
But the second I made a move,

569
00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:07.520
she made me feel like a creek.
There you go.
You got one of those,
sir.

570
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:12.740
You got one of those,
uh,
gee.
Oh Gee,
she's,
this is the,
this is like,

571
00:35:12.741 --> 00:35:17.030
she's a,
an Olympic level.
Uh,
uh,
uh,

572
00:35:17.031 --> 00:35:21.260
what do you call Dick Tease and I say Olympic level cause she's actually dabbled

573
00:35:21.261 --> 00:35:23.780
in the porn industry with the nude photos.
Um,

574
00:35:23.781 --> 00:35:26.690
I either want to bang this girl or get her to quit throwing her sexual

575
00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:31.400
suggestive topics at me and quit using me as an emotional tampon.
Helped me out,

576
00:35:31.401 --> 00:35:35.210
Bill.
Go Fuck Yourself.
I would say exactly what you just said.

577
00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.890
That the bang part.
Just say listen.

578
00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:39.493
<v 1>MMM.</v>

579
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.680
<v 0>Just,
you know,
you don't want you to,
you just go,
I would just go fucking</v>

580
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.500
<v 1>okay.</v>

581
00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.070
<v 0>Don't curse.
Don't say anything fucked up.
Just straight out.
Say,
just say,
listen.</v>

582
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:53.990
Ever since you've been here,
you have been just openly talking about sex.

583
00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.050
You talk about how you enjoy giving oral sex.

584
00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.080
You mentioned that you have nude photos,
you don't have a problem with nudity,

585
00:36:00.081 --> 00:36:05.030
you're constantly bringing up sex.
Okay.
And the other day,
you know,

586
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.670
no,
I can't go that way.
Cause then she'll be like,

587
00:36:07.671 --> 00:36:10.490
well cause you came up like a creep.
Just tell her,
look,
don't,

588
00:36:10.491 --> 00:36:15.400
don't bring up sex anymore.
Can you pull,
just don't,
don't bring up sex anymore.

589
00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:17.800
Uh,
and just when she says,
why just say,

590
00:36:17.801 --> 00:36:20.080
cause I'm not comfortable with you talking about it.
All right.

591
00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:23.770
I would just like to have a roommate to roommate relationship.
You know,

592
00:36:23.771 --> 00:36:24.700
I'm not trying to be a jerk.

593
00:36:24.701 --> 00:36:27.460
I just please don't talk about sex anymore and that would be perfect because

594
00:36:27.461 --> 00:36:29.510
then you will totally like take away all of her powers.

595
00:36:29.511 --> 00:36:33.040
So you just took the rope away from wonder woman right there.
Yeah.

596
00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:36.790
I want you to take a rope off.
She can't find her jet.
Isn't that how it worked?

597
00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:40.450
C'Mon nerds.
Any nerds listening to this and actually it's not true.

598
00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:42.460
She could see her invisible jet.

599
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:48.850
That was one of the dumbest thing that was such like a shelf in a stick thing

600
00:36:48.851 --> 00:36:53.350
that they gave her,
wasn't it?
An invisible jet.
Superman can fly by himself,

601
00:36:53.351 --> 00:36:54.610
doesn't even need,

602
00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:59.470
doesn't even need a fucking plane.

603
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:03.460
Wonder woman can't fly.
She needs a jet just like the rest of ours.

604
00:37:03.461 --> 00:37:05.710
But to make it an interesting,
they make it invisible.

605
00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:10.120
Not at any point did they say that wonder woman invented the invisible jet?

606
00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:14.830
You know,
she didn't.
She didn't.
She's too busy fucking going to the gym,

607
00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:18.880
you know,
keeping her stomach flat and fucking around with that rope.

608
00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.770
So that's all she really is.
She's just kinda like this.
Uh,

609
00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:27.370
well I guess she can block bullets with the wristbands,

610
00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.650
so that's unbelievably like reptilian quickness.
So I'll give her that.

611
00:37:32.651 --> 00:37:35.260
But other than that,
you know,
if she wants to go to California,

612
00:37:35.261 --> 00:37:37.270
she's got to get on a plane just like the rest of us.

613
00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:42.430
And she's got a fly yourself out,
which I guess is kind of cool.

614
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:45.690
I don't know how hot was fucking,

615
00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:49.420
was it that was going to say Linda Blair was Linda Evans to fuck was her name.

616
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:55.210
Claire,
what was the name of the woman who played a wonder woman
in,

617
00:37:55.250 --> 00:38:00.250
in the late seventies Oh,
did I love her?
I've loved every fucking,

618
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:03.280
that's back before there was like 9,000 channels.

619
00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:05.830
So every woman on television back then,
you know,

620
00:38:05.831 --> 00:38:09.880
if they were playing a sexy role,
it wasn't,
they weren't outside the box,

621
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:13.900
no pun intended.
They would just fucking straight up.
They were a 10.

622
00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:19.300
She was hot.
All three Charlie's angels.
They were all hot.
Jamie Summers,

623
00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.370
the bionic woman,
she was fucking hot.

624
00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.460
<v 1>MMM.</v>

625
00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.170
<v 0>Three's company.
I thought they were both hot.</v>

626
00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:34.260
I liked them all.
Alice was hot.
Vera was hot in a weird way.
You could keep flow.

627
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:37.420
That'd be one once in a while,
but they were all,
they were all like,

628
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:43.330
they will hot Gloria.
You know,
if you get past her voice,

629
00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:47.020
she was a fucking hottie.
Been somebody ugly.

630
00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:53.800
I really wasn't.
Marsha was hot.
Jan,
by the end of it,
she came into her own.

631
00:38:55.690 --> 00:39:00.220
Yeah,
just a bunch of Hardees.
Hardees they weren't hoary though.

632
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:05.070
They didn't have horseback then.
You know?
Did they?
I don't know.
All right,

633
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.570
let's plow ahead here.
Depressed dude.

634
00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.530
A Billy cont exclamation point.
I've been listening.

635
00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.200
I've been listening to your podcast for years.

636
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:19.780
You're derange psychopathic perspective reminds me,
I'm not the only one.

637
00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:25.150
Shake and ladders.
I don't know what that means is this guy from Boston.

638
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.420
I've been listening to the podcast for years.

639
00:39:28.421 --> 00:39:31.000
You drained psychopathic perspective reminds me,

640
00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:35.820
I'm not the only one shake in lad his kid.
That still is a song.

641
00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:40.450
Even if the accident shaken ladders.
I know what that means.

642
00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:45.190
Anyways.
I got a problem.
Yeah,

Get a fucking job.
You fucking Cock sucker.
Um,

652
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:28.330
I got a problem for years now.
I've been trapped in my KFC and wet wipes.

653
00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:30.070
Okay,
that's disgusting.

654
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:35.500
I used to be a bodybuilder and actor and a comedian with fucking prospects right

655
00:40:35.501 --> 00:40:39.940
in front of me,
but then adulthood raped me in the eyes.
Oh,
Jesus.

656
00:40:39.941 --> 00:40:43.480
Could you be more dramatic?
It sounds like that fucking chick from

657
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:48.030
sex in the city,
uh,
crazy.

658
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:53.640
Broke my hat.
I had,
this is the guy again,
crazy,
broad,
broke my heart.

659
00:40:53.641 --> 00:40:58.641
I had to cut away old friends and family shutting me out of their smiles.

660
00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:03.630
All right,
so this is like getting creepier with each sentence.

661
00:41:03.631 --> 00:41:06.780
If you don't bring this around in like two sentences,
I'm going to abandon this.

662
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.700
Had to cut away from old friends and family shutting me out of their smiles.

663
00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:16.140
Dude,
what did you do that your friends and family decided they didn't want to be

664
00:41:16.141 --> 00:41:20.070
around you?
Uh,
anyways,
I don't feel sorry for myself for one.

665
00:41:20.071 --> 00:41:24.030
Any pity you're not going to get any.
So good.
I'm glad you don't.
He goes,

666
00:41:24.031 --> 00:41:28.980
I just want to know how to get out of this.
Never ending routine of demise.
Well,

667
00:41:28.981 --> 00:41:32.850
first of all,
I would stop using those goth death metal words,

668
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:37.010
you know,
demise.
What else you got in here?

669
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:41.270
Adult rape me in the eyes.
These he like song lyrics,

670
00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:47.410
you know,
depress dude.
What would be the name of his is trapped and Barker.

671
00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:52.310
I'm sure you're going to wipe wipes,
right?
It sounds like I can't sing like that,

672
00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.170
right?
Where do you all like dish?

673
00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.420
We'll key it up to my eyes and all these fucking kids getting like wet fucking

674
00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.960
whiplash.
Um,

675
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:05.390
I worked too much in a jeweler that was supposed to pay for my comedy career.

676
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:09.230
When I don't work,
I,
uh,
I was suppose to pay for my comedy career when I,

677
00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:12.620
when I don't work,
uh,
I sleep or oh,
when I don't work,

678
00:42:12.621 --> 00:42:17.180
I sleep or watch endless DVDs.
I'm 24 years old of what the fuck this reads.
Like.

679
00:42:17.181 --> 00:42:19.610
You're 56,
dude.
He goes,

680
00:42:19.611 --> 00:42:23.180
I'm tired all the time from all the hating of the world and my body just won't

681
00:42:23.181 --> 00:42:27.830
listen to the screaming frustration in my soul.
Dude,

682
00:42:27.831 --> 00:42:30.680
you listened to light.
You listen to progressive metal.

683
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:32.900
I'm guessing by the words you use here,
uh,

684
00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:34.700
either that you played dungeons and dragons.

685
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:37.910
I'm really not helping you to depression by shitting on you through all of this.

686
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:42.880
Um,
don't worry.
I'm going to give you some sunshine here in the end here.
It's,

687
00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.960
I sometimes get a Spock,
a motivation to get back in shape and,

688
00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:51.830
and start writing script,
but only lasts for a day or two at the most.
Yeah,

689
00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.480
exactly.
And then,
and then the work comes and you have to keep going.

690
00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:01.660
And that's what separates the people in life who fucking work and in make it.

691
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:06.350
And those who don't,
you know,
everything's fun for a couple of fucking days.

692
00:43:06.351 --> 00:43:08.520
I'm going to get shredded.
I'm going to join a boxing gym.

693
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:11.120
I'm going to look like I'm going to fight in a title fight and you go down
there,

694
00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:12.440
you skip rope.
I'm going to get abs.

695
00:43:12.441 --> 00:43:15.550
You doing all the fucking shit in two days in,
you know,
after two days you,

696
00:43:15.551 --> 00:43:17.720
you get tired.
All right?

697
00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.330
And that's what you need the discipline to get up and go over there.

698
00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:22.970
Even though you don't want to,
you know,

699
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:25.970
people who've written Oscar winning scripts.

700
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.880
I bet they don't like fucking doing it on,
on a certain level,

701
00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:33.290
but they keep going.
So I would just tell you to keep fucking going.
Anyways,

702
00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:35.450
let me read the rest of this drum overly dramatic shit.

703
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:39.500
I've lost all faith in the world.
Have nothing to fight for anymore.

704
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:40.371
I respect you.

705
00:43:40.371 --> 00:43:44.630
Go Fuck yourself attitude and want and want to know what you did to finally pick

706
00:43:44.631 --> 00:43:47.780
yourself up from your Darfur inflicted depression.
Uh,
sorry,

707
00:43:47.781 --> 00:43:50.780
it's not the funniest emails,
but I could really do with you guys.
I know,
dude,

708
00:43:50.781 --> 00:43:53.180
I'm fucking with you.
I know you're going through some shit.
So I,
here we go.

709
00:43:53.181 --> 00:43:55.790
I'm going to help you out here.
Uh,
first thing I would do,

710
00:43:55.791 --> 00:43:58.910
get rid of the KFC in wet wipes.
All right?

711
00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:02.390
If you're already kind of a depressed dude,
if you eat bad food,

712
00:44:02.391 --> 00:44:05.510
that's just going to add because I'm just speaking personally.
Once again,

713
00:44:05.511 --> 00:44:08.330
not a licensed guy here in case you throw yourself off the fucking roof.

714
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:12.110
All right?
Um,
yeah.
Number one,

715
00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:17.660
this is what I do.
Go.
He'd go out and get something healthy to eat,
you know,

716
00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:22.100
drink some water.
Okay?
Get eight hours sleep,
wake up and eat something healthy.

717
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:26.570
Then go to the grocery store when you full and go buy a bunch of healthy shit.

718
00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.690
Okay.
Chop up the veggies,
chop up the lettuce,

719
00:44:29.691 --> 00:44:32.520
get a fucking salad already made in there so you don't have to think about it.

720
00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:35.820
All right?
Cook up some fucking chicken.
Chop that shit up.

721
00:44:35.821 --> 00:44:37.020
Make some chicken salad.

722
00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.220
You got that in there to get yourself some fucking lunch breed and get yourself

723
00:44:41.221 --> 00:44:44.070
some real bread from a fucking bakery.
Start with that bullshit.

724
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.230
You start eating right and then just start working out.

725
00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.070
You're automatically gonna feel good about yourself and fucking stick with that

726
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:53.850
as far as that other shit goes.
Dude,
you're 24 years old.
All right.

727
00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:57.450
I started comedy when I was 24 you sound like you've already been doing it and

728
00:44:57.451 --> 00:45:00.960
quit,
so you're ahead of where,
where I was at at your age,

729
00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:04.710
so there's no reason to be depressed.
All right.
Um,

730
00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:10.680
this is how I got beyond my depression was I just started observing it.

731
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:15.810
I looked at it as a spectator rather than feeling a thought and just accepting

732
00:45:15.811 --> 00:45:18.390
it and then being dragged to the bottom of the fucking ocean with it.

733
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.150
I just started to pay attention.

734
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:24.450
I just sat there and listened to what my brain was telling me and it was a bunch

735
00:45:24.451 --> 00:45:27.330
of negative,
oh my God,
I'm gonna fail and I have to go back,

736
00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:29.100
move in with my parents and they're going to die.

737
00:45:29.101 --> 00:45:31.110
I'm going to be able to afford to pay for the house and then I'm going to be

738
00:45:31.111 --> 00:45:35.130
homeless and then I'm just going to die.
And uh,
you know,

739
00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.900
nothing's ever going to work out for me.
You know?

740
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:39.180
Those were the thoughts I was having.

741
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:42.210
So I just sat back and observed him and I just started going,

742
00:45:42.211 --> 00:45:46.170
I don't want to think that.
I want to think that.
And I would just,

743
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:51.000
as I felt him coming,
I would just replace it with like a positive thought.

744
00:45:51.001 --> 00:45:53.670
I know this is really corny and simple,
but I kind of started doing that.

745
00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:58.740
And the more I did that because it didn't quite work as to what actually didn't

746
00:45:58.741 --> 00:45:59.730
work in the beginning at all.

747
00:45:59.731 --> 00:46:03.000
But like I just kept doing it more and more and then I just became conscious of

748
00:46:03.001 --> 00:46:07.830
when my brain was going in that direction and I'm working out.

749
00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:12.270
Helps me eating right.
Helps me going down to a comedy club,

750
00:46:12.271 --> 00:46:16.860
telling jokes helps me out playing drums,
wrestling with my dog,

751
00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:21.450
you know,
take Nia out to dinner.
Just go do something.

752
00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:24.030
Like it's just a choice.

753
00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:27.730
July 30th so only going to happen once.

754
00:46:27.731 --> 00:46:32.680
So am I going to fucking be a miserable can't on this or I said July 30th,

755
00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:35.230
2012 is only gonna happen unless it's just,
it's just a fucking choice dude.
So,

756
00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:38.830
you know,
if what you deal with his clinical,
then it's obviously way beyond me,

757
00:46:38.831 --> 00:46:39.970
so I don't need,
you know,

758
00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:44.150
and then I'll like to fucking apologize like Fred Willard.
Um,

759
00:46:44.151 --> 00:46:48.430
I'm sorry that you didn't go to a psychiatrist and you went to a hacky comedian

760
00:46:48.431 --> 00:46:52.960
instead.
Evidently that's my fault.
All right,
plowing ahead.
Um,

761
00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:57.100
what are we up to here with time?
Gigi,
she's flied by um,

762
00:46:57.130 --> 00:47:01.060
girl found porn
girl found porn

763
00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:04.450
boy meets girl,
girl finds porn.

764
00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:09.790
Boy is embarrassed.
That's what I'm guessing.
All right.
A few years.

765
00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:14.230
A few years ago I was in a relationship and one morning my girl went snooping

766
00:47:14.231 --> 00:47:18.190
around on my computer when I was in the shower in a classic rookie mistake.

767
00:47:18.191 --> 00:47:21.490
I did not delete any of the porn sites I had visited from my history.

768
00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.010
I'm not an internet porn addict or anything,

769
00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:29.040
but I am a dude and not only do I enjoy the occasional fucking Schwab session,

770
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:30.640
whatever that means,
I guess jerking off,

771
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.430
but a lifetime of bountiful internet porn.

772
00:47:33.431 --> 00:47:37.750
It has made my ability to perform the mental beat a thing of the past.

773
00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:40.750
I don't know what that is.
What is the mental beat?

774
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:47.860
My ability to perform the mental beat a thing of the past.
Oh,

775
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:51.820
jerking off with just your thoughts.
Basically,
I need moving pictures.

776
00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:55.870
I know many men understand my plight.
Yeah,
dude,
you got to go back to that.

777
00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:59.740
Go back to the mental fucking one yet.
Oh,
it's a lot cheaper.

778
00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:03.520
Nobody knows what you thinking about.
It's a safe world.

779
00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:09.010
Um,
anyway,
she was all kinds of pissed off.
Asked me why.

780
00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:12.160
I was looking at a site called youporn while starting to cry.

781
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:16.690
She was a seventh degree black belt at the guilty crying style of fighting,

782
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.290
meaning when she wants an instant victory,
she cries and I cave.

783
00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:24.760
So I played the only card I could defeat,
I could to diffuse the situation,

784
00:48:24.761 --> 00:48:25.720
which was to lie.

785
00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:30.880
I said that a buddy sent me an email link to that site because he thought he saw

786
00:48:30.881 --> 00:48:33.820
someone from our high school on there.
She immediately came back with,

787
00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:37.870
but it's in the top 10 of your most viewed sites on your history.

788
00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:42.110
Ah,
Jeez.

789
00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:43.990
I got to give it up to her right there,
man.

790
00:48:43.991 --> 00:48:47.680
She went fucking Colombel on you and you walked right into the,
so he goes,

791
00:48:47.681 --> 00:48:48.251
at this point,

792
00:48:48.251 --> 00:48:51.370
I just came clean and told her that all the dude's still catch a beat.

793
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:54.940
That all dudes catch a beat even when they're in a relationship.

794
00:48:54.941 --> 00:48:57.850
And it doesn't mean that we don't find her girlfriends desirable.

795
00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:01.960
I tried to make it funny and said I was training my Hogan to gain Stan Umma

796
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:05.800
stamina.
So really she should be more encouraging.

797
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.680
That's actually funny.
Alas,

798
00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:13.120
she wanted none of it and was in total shock that I was doing this.

799
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:16.210
She said that none of her previous boyfriends ever looked at porn,

800
00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.510
let alone rub one out well in a relationship.
Okay.

801
00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:23.320
What fantasy planet the she live on.
Um,
he goes to them,

802
00:49:23.321 --> 00:49:27.160
became pissed that she would be so naive to think that that was true and told

803
00:49:27.161 --> 00:49:30.730
her that all dudes do this and stood strong that I did nothing wrong.

804
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:34.270
She kept go,
good for you.
Standing your ground.
Good for you.

805
00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:37.390
She kept coming at me with yelling,
hitting and crying.

806
00:49:37.391 --> 00:49:41.530
But I remain unwavering in my stance and did not apologize.
Looking back,

807
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:45.010
I think I only took this stance because I was starting to have my doubts in

808
00:49:45.011 --> 00:49:48.250
regards to the relationship and just didn't give a fuck anymore.

809
00:49:48.251 --> 00:49:49.720
What do I gotta be honest with you?

810
00:49:49.721 --> 00:49:52.180
Whether you gave a fuck or didn't give a fuck about her anymore,

811
00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:57.040
if you totally loved somebody,
that doesn't mean you cave in 100% of the time.

812
00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:02.050
You know Cavan when you're wrong,
you're right.
Sorry.
Definitely do that shit.

813
00:50:02.051 --> 00:50:06.760
But like,
um,
you know,
if you can't watch porn and rub one out,
then I mean,

814
00:50:06.761 --> 00:50:10.370
I don't understand like,
uh,
I mean it's,

815
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:12.700
it's a slippery slope starts with that.
And the next thing you know,

816
00:50:12.701 --> 00:50:16.690
you can't watch the game.
Right?
I don't fucking know.

817
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.670
Anyways.
Um,

818
00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:22.420
it turns out we broke up a few weeks later and you better believe she threw this

819
00:50:22.421 --> 00:50:26.770
incident back in my face when she was having the goat getting killed by a python

820
00:50:26.771 --> 00:50:30.340
last struggle that you had previously made analogies about.
Anyways,

821
00:50:30.341 --> 00:50:32.330
I have a new girlfriend now,
which I like more,

822
00:50:32.331 --> 00:50:35.450
but I was wondering how I would handle the situation with someone I really love.

823
00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:39.320
So what do you think the best way to handle this situation if it happened to you

824
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:44.450
or any other guy?
Um,
you know,

825
00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:47.780
I don't think it's a big deal if you're not watching it habitually.

826
00:50:47.781 --> 00:50:52.550
If he occasionally watch it,
some women consider it cheating.
Um,

827
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:58.900
I don't know how the fuck do I hit?
Well,
I'm lucky knee doesn't give a shit.

828
00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:03.780
She doesn't care.
She would care if I hadn't done anything with her for awhile.

829
00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:06.580
And I was doing that I,
that would bother her.

830
00:51:06.581 --> 00:51:09.460
But like she doesn't give a shit what I do.
Um,

831
00:51:09.461 --> 00:51:12.130
I think someone has to accept you for who you are.
All right and let in.

832
00:51:12.131 --> 00:51:15.160
Unless you're like,
you know,
if you occasionally smoke weed,

833
00:51:15.161 --> 00:51:17.650
casually have a drink,
occasionally watched porn who gives a fuck.

834
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:21.160
But if you're always smoking weed,
if you're a fucking alcoholic or you,
you're,

835
00:51:21.161 --> 00:51:25.760
you,
uh,
addicted to porn,
then I think that,
um,

836
00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:29.020
there's a problem.
But,
uh,
I would just do what you do,

837
00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:31.523
<v 1>you know,</v>

838
00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.130
<v 0>if you think it's an issue and you need to bring it up,</v>

839
00:51:34.131 --> 00:51:37.550
I would just bring it up and say,
listen,
what am I just to let you know,

840
00:51:37.551 --> 00:51:40.750
I occasionally rub one out to porn and I'm,

841
00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.310
my one girlfriend really had a fucking problem with it.

842
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:47.120
And before we go any further,
I just want to make sure you don't,

843
00:51:47.121 --> 00:51:51.460
so there's no weird arguments.
I can't lie to you.

844
00:51:51.461 --> 00:51:54.380
That's not exactly an easy thing to bring up.
Uh,

845
00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:58.750
which is why you just kind of have to be yourself in a relationship.

846
00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:01.960
So then it won't come out of left field because if you're being overly polite,

847
00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:04.900
overly jolly,
overly,
you know,

848
00:52:04.901 --> 00:52:09.190
just accentuating the good parts about you and not showing your seedier side,
uh,

849
00:52:09.191 --> 00:52:12.820
that really is going to come out of left field.
So,
um,
does that make any sense?

850
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:17.080
I would definitely,
I'd bring it up.
You know,

851
00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:20.840
so sweetie,
are we going to dinner tonight by the way?

852
00:52:20.841 --> 00:52:22.600
And you like porn cause I do,

853
00:52:22.601 --> 00:52:24.820
I rub one out every once in a while to chicks do it.

854
00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:28.690
Really know where are you going?
Oh my fucking ear is killing me.

855
00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:31.420
Do you know my dog cause my ear to bleed?

856
00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:35.770
She gave my fucking ear ahead bud.
If you ever get a pit bull,

857
00:52:35.771 --> 00:52:39.940
you gotta watch out for the heads because they're like little wrecking balls and

858
00:52:39.941 --> 00:52:44.720
um,
you know,
I hadn't been home in like a week.

859
00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:49.520
I was out in Boston in the fucking north end all week.

860
00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:52.190
Um,
by the way,

861
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:55.580
underrated the north end pizzeria.
Regina,

862
00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:59.720
that one seat at the bar that faces the wall,

863
00:52:59.721 --> 00:53:02.810
they call it their timeout chair.
You can walk right in.

864
00:53:02.811 --> 00:53:05.510
You don't have to stand in line if you by yourself and just ask if you can go

865
00:53:05.511 --> 00:53:07.670
sit there and at granted you have to face the wall,

866
00:53:07.671 --> 00:53:11.630
why everyone at the bar shoots the shit.
But if you're a loner like myself,

867
00:53:11.631 --> 00:53:15.120
it's fucking great and it's tremendous pizza.
Um,

868
00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:20.670
anyway,
so I hadn't been home in like a week.
So,
uh,
you know,

869
00:53:20.671 --> 00:53:23.880
my dog gets fucking excited to see me.
I'm excited to see her.

870
00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:27.150
Nia let out the front,
she's fucking jumping up and down.

871
00:53:27.151 --> 00:53:30.780
It come through the gate and I had a bunch of stuff in my hand and I kind of,

872
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:33.820
you know,
it was bent down to like,
Hey,
what's up?

873
00:53:33.821 --> 00:53:38.821
And the dog jumped up and was like going to lick my face and basically had its

874
00:53:39.301 --> 00:53:43.860
mouth kind of open and we went teeth to teeth to that point where it was like,

875
00:53:43.861 --> 00:53:46.230
did I just knock out some teeth?
They definitely feel numb.

876
00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:50.310
Fortunately she didn't.
So that's what happened.
Now you would think if,

877
00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:51.960
if you were a smart person,

878
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:55.440
you bring your bags in the house where you had your hands free and I could calm

879
00:53:55.441 --> 00:53:56.274
my dog down.

880
00:53:56.460 --> 00:54:00.490
But I'm so fucking excited to see her and I get excited when she gets excited

881
00:54:00.491 --> 00:54:02.880
and Ma,
you know,
I'm loving that she's,

882
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:06.780
it's fucking great when you come home and there's one person like this fucking

883
00:54:06.781 --> 00:54:08.670
guy's home.
This is awesome.
Right?

884
00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:14.220
So I bent down to pet her and I was,
you know,

885
00:54:14.221 --> 00:54:14.990
scratching or,

886
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:19.950
or ribs and she was looking down at a tail and then she swung her head back and

887
00:54:19.951 --> 00:54:22.790
I got my fucking mouth out of the way just the last second.

888
00:54:22.791 --> 00:54:25.740
So he didn't knock my teeth out in the side of the head,

889
00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:29.640
slammed into the side of mine and basically Mush my year.

890
00:54:29.641 --> 00:54:34.641
I feel like I got suckered right in this side of the fucking ear and a fucking

891
00:54:36.091 --> 00:54:39.120
bled out.
I think my ear died.

892
00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:42.810
So now I got this fucking scab.
It looks like I've got this big,

893
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.220
what's a dirt on the side of my fucking ear for my God damn dog.

894
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.380
So I got the headphones on.
It hurts.

895
00:54:49.381 --> 00:54:52.590
That's why I told that story as this podcast gone off the fucking rails.

896
00:54:52.591 --> 00:54:55.860
Is it me?
Is it me?
Um,
all right.

897
00:54:56.170 --> 00:54:58.830
Couple of [inaudible] to a quick ads here.

898
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:03.180
And of course I can't go back.
Why does it do this to me?

899
00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:08.250
Why do you do this to me?
Can anybody explain why on these new fucking

900
00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:14.190
Mac book pros,
does anybody else have this problem?

901
00:55:14.191 --> 00:55:17.760
You go on the fucking Internet and when you go to go to a new window,

902
00:55:17.761 --> 00:55:21.480
you open a new tab.
It won't let you go back to the other window,

903
00:55:21.481 --> 00:55:23.730
even though you can click on it.
I Dunno.

All right,

923
00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:32.590
my girls lost her mind.
Well,
by the way,
everybody,

924
00:56:32.591 --> 00:56:34.710
that was really embarrassing last week when I thought that,
that,

925
00:56:34.711 --> 00:56:38.170
that woman who wanted to hike was actually a dude.
You know,

926
00:56:38.171 --> 00:56:40.780
I don't know what I was thinking.
I always just get emails from guys,

927
00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:43.960
even when she said,
uh,
no one wants that ghetto pussy.

928
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:47.920
I just thought that that was just some girl like trying to be tough and talking

929
00:56:47.921 --> 00:56:51.370
to a guy like he was a bitch.
I completely missed it and it was embarrassing.

930
00:56:51.371 --> 00:56:56.350
I got 50 emails last week to said good podcasts and the other 48 w were

931
00:56:56.351 --> 00:56:58.300
ridiculing me for not realizing that.

932
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:04.370
So there you go.
Alright,
last couple here and then I got to get the fuck out.

933
00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:08.380
He all right.
My girls lost her mind.
What's up bill bowl?

934
00:57:08.381 --> 00:57:12.250
I'm 25 and a few months ago I met a girl that blew my fucking mind.

935
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.120
She was smart,
creative,
beautiful,
sexy.

936
00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:20.530
It had been over a year since the last girl I really cared about dumped me

937
00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:24.310
because she had a religious epiphany and thought I was destroying her

938
00:57:24.311 --> 00:57:28.960
relationship with Christ [inaudible] and I was beginning to think that I'd never

939
00:57:28.961 --> 00:57:32.440
have that gut feeling of love for a girl again.
But this new girl,

940
00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:35.950
but this new girl and oh,

941
00:57:35.951 --> 00:57:39.640
but I met this new girl and I started dating and things went real fast.

942
00:57:39.641 --> 00:57:42.340
Within two weeks we were together daily and things were great,

943
00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:47.110
but about a month in,
I began to realize that she had a horrible temper.
Oh man,

944
00:57:47.111 --> 00:57:48.580
that's brutal.
All right.
Even worse,

945
00:57:48.581 --> 00:57:53.050
she tended to put words in my mouth when she'd get angry and get more mad at

946
00:57:53.051 --> 00:57:56.920
things.
I didn't even fucking say.
Here's an example.
All right.

947
00:57:56.921 --> 00:57:59.980
This conversation goes her,
him,
her,
him,
her,
him.
All right.

948
00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:04.990
I'm not going to say I'm not going to,
all right,
I'll just do the voices.
Okay.

949
00:58:04.991 --> 00:58:09.490
Here's his example.
Honey.
What time is the movie?
Eight 30.

950
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:14.680
I looked yesterday and I'm pretty sure it was a no,
I just looked it up.

951
00:58:14.681 --> 00:58:19.020
It's eight 30.
Ah,
some stupid.

952
00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:23.450
What?
No,
I didn't.
Oh,
I'm stupid.
Animal Life.

953
00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:28.240
Jesus.
You don't even worse than her relationship was that acting?
Um,

954
00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:35.860
I lost faith in it halfway through and it's gotten even extremely worse for the

955
00:58:35.861 --> 00:58:36.641
fourth day in a row.

956
00:58:36.641 --> 00:58:39.850
She's blown up at me to the point of telling me that we should just break up.

957
00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:43.870
I get pissed and I'm like,
fine.
And she's like,
how dare you break up with me?

958
00:58:43.871 --> 00:58:47.440
How could you do that yet?
Do this check is out of her fucking mind.
All right.

959
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:50.140
She's afraid you're going to break up with her and she's just fucking,

960
00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:51.850
she's fucking,

961
00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:55.930
she's sabotaging the relationship and guess what?

962
00:58:55.931 --> 00:58:59.430
That's not your fucking problem.
All right?
She can go work,

963
00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:02.050
workout or anger with somebody else.
Go find someone else.

964
00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.240
You still young right now.
He's still young.

965
00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:08.530
As long as you're not like over 38 there's no reason to try and wait around for

966
00:59:08.531 --> 00:59:11.250
this girl to fucking get her shit together.
Anyways,

967
00:59:11.251 --> 00:59:12.640
she's completely in another world.

968
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:16.930
And last night she told me the other reason why I was with her was because it

969
00:59:16.931 --> 00:59:21.280
was for easy sex.
Fucking ridiculous.
She texted me to apologize.

970
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:25.280
Ended up,
oh,
she texted you to apologize,

971
00:59:25.281 --> 00:59:27.410
but it ended up she started the shit all over again.

972
00:59:27.411 --> 00:59:31.040
When I asked her why she even fucking say something like that to begin with

973
00:59:31.041 --> 00:59:35.790
because she's out of her mine.
All right.
This is your call,

974
00:59:35.791 --> 00:59:36.624
sir.

975
00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:40.980
You can either date someone who is healthy and is ready to accept you and all

976
00:59:40.981 --> 00:59:45.360
the wonderful things you'll bring to the table,
um,

977
00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:48.530
or she can go fuck herself.
Right?

978
00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:54.230
What?
I'm sorry.
Did that make any fucking sense at that?
Didn't,

979
00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:55.850
did I just say that right?
I'm sorry.

980
00:59:55.851 --> 00:59:59.450
I closed the window and then couldn't figure out what the hell it was.
Um,
yeah,

981
00:59:59.451 --> 01:00:01.250
it's all up to you.
Do you want to deal with this bitch?

982
01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:04.280
I don't think you'd do this.
Plenty of the great girls out there,

983
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:08.560
plenty of phenomenal women that'll be excited to be with you and not be a

984
01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:09.410
complete psycho.

985
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:14.180
Or he could sit with this girl and maybe she'll figure this shit out.

986
01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:20.200
I Dunno.
You know what I love about mia is she's not an angry person.
Okay?

987
01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:24.250
Who wants to have kids with someone who isn't,
who's fucking angry?
Oh,
Jesus.

988
01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:28.060
I'm glad she didn't hear that.
She fucking dumped me in a second,
you know?

989
01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:29.860
But I think an angry dad is acceptable.

990
01:00:29.861 --> 01:00:32.500
That's actually understandable because guys are idiots.

991
01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.530
But if the mom's angry too,
I just can't imagine that.

992
01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:40.930
I don't think that's good for kids.
Neither is an angry dead,
I guess.
Angry,

993
01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:43.810
generous on a good thing.
Well,
you know,
let's look at that.

994
01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:47.840
I actually learned something.
Um,
anyways,
uh,
here's,

995
01:00:47.841 --> 01:00:52.210
here's some standup dates I have coming up.
Uh,
I'll be at the Improv in Orlando,

996
01:00:52.211 --> 01:00:54.850
Florida September 7th through the ninth,

997
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:59.830
and I'll be at Caroline's the rescheduled date September 20th through the 23rd.

998
01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:03.550
I apologize to everybody.
I had to cancel last second,
the,
uh,

999
01:01:03.551 --> 01:01:07.090
the Carolina state at the end of July and moved to September 20th through 23rd.

1000
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:09.280
I got that acting gig.
Uh,

1001
01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:13.720
I can't really tell you what it is because you never know.

1002
01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.513
You never know.

1003
01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:19.440
You can have a giant roll and then they go a different direction and by the time

1004
01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:22.060
had done editing,
you're not even in the fucking thing.
But,
uh,

1005
01:01:22.061 --> 01:01:26.450
I got a good feel that I'm going to be,
um,
but we shall see.

1006
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:28.520
We shall see all Billy,

1007
01:01:28.521 --> 01:01:31.610
the actress coming around coming around and done a couple of two,

1008
01:01:31.611 --> 01:01:36.350
three things this year.
Uh,
speaking of which,
my favorite show,

1009
01:01:36.351 --> 01:01:39.530
breaking bad next week,
you guys might want to tune in.

1010
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:43.670
You might want to tune in next week cause they're always great episodes.
Wink,

1011
01:01:43.671 --> 01:01:44.300
wink,

1012
01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:49.300
especially when a certain somebody wink wink might be making an appearance.

1013
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.781
Hey,
you know what?

1014
01:01:50.781 --> 01:01:54.110
I saw a picture of one of the most beautiful trucks I've ever fucking seen in my

1015
01:01:54.111 --> 01:01:58.460
life life.
Um,
I think I've completely abandoned.

1016
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:02.540
I still love cars,
but I am a total truck guy now.

1017
01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:07.070
And specifically I am a Ford truck guy

1018
01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.430
from literally the forties,

1019
01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:15.470
right through like 1968.
Those are my favorite ones.

1020
01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:20.160
I don't like the interiors on the 1970s for trucks.
I do,
I do love the,

1021
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.180
the front end,
sir.

1022
01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:23.053
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1023
01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.060
<v 0>But this guy has got a 1968.</v>

1024
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:28.790
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1025
01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:31.850
<v 0>Uh,
the same year as mine.
F 100 with the long bed,</v>

1026
01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.800
four wheel drive.

1027
01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:38.920
And it is absolutely fucking gorgeous and a,

1028
01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:42.130
if anybody else's into trucks,
I'm going to have that up on the,
uh,

1029
01:02:42.131 --> 01:02:46.730
the Amman podcast page.
Anyways,
that's the podcast for this week.
Um,

1030
01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:51.350
I hope this week can go by without me seeing somebody,
uh,

1031
01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:53.001
you know,

1032
01:02:53.001 --> 01:02:56.540
that I'm a fan of or even not a fan of having to apologize for not fucking doing

1033
01:02:56.541 --> 01:03:01.250
anything,
anything wrong.
And I'm really sick of just a lazy journalism.

1034
01:03:01.251 --> 01:03:04.370
Why you try to say that there's outrage when there was no outrage.

1035
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.860
You know what I mean?
The joke basically worked.
People laughed.

1036
01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:15.350
It's just really fucking annoying.
So anyways,
um,
that is it.

1037
01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.460
And by the way,

1038
01:03:16.461 --> 01:03:20.990
if you ever see that Dane is performing in any sort of Broadway thing,
uh,

1039
01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:24.350
I can't recommend them highly enough.
I was absolutely fucking,

1040
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:28.820
he blew me away.
And I've known this guy for 20 fucking years.
I've seen it.

1041
01:03:28.821 --> 01:03:33.140
I've seen all the tricks in his fucking trick bag there.
And uh,

1042
01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:37.490
absolutely fucking blew me away and I'm really happy for him,

1043
01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:40.490
especially after that fucking bullshit,

1044
01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:44.150
that fucking nerve filming them.

1045
01:03:44.151 --> 01:03:48.500
That just really ruined my fucking week when that she don't need it actually

1046
01:03:48.501 --> 01:03:53.270
called me up when that happened.
And like with like this concern tone going,

1047
01:03:53.271 --> 01:03:55.940
I know you've worked so hard.
What if something you say,

1048
01:03:55.941 --> 01:03:58.550
I mean that's the climate that's starting to be created,

1049
01:03:58.910 --> 01:04:03.560
which is the reason why people can't apologize for this shit.

1050
01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:05.450
I mean,
I dunno.

1051
01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:08.810
I guess if you're on a TV show that they get pressured to do it.

1052
01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:12.380
It's all bullshit that they gave me.
Like the Po apology isn't sincere.

1053
01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:14.400
It has to do with money.
Like all right,
well we,

1054
01:04:14.401 --> 01:04:18.410
we don't want people protesting this and making the show go away.

1055
01:04:18.411 --> 01:04:21.800
There's hundreds of people who lose their jobs.
Just fucking apologize.

1056
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:26.300
I think that's why they always go after comedians who have like TV shows or have

1057
01:04:26.301 --> 01:04:28.370
some sort of notoriety.
If you notice that shit,

1058
01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.600
they don't go after a guy like me.
What are they going to do?

1059
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:34.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1060
01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:37.920
<v 0>You can't stop me from telling jokes next to a cheesecake factory in a mall.</v>

1061
01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:42.930
All right?
You could maybe turn it from a three quarter full room.

1062
01:04:42.931 --> 01:04:46.080
Do I have full room?
But I don't give a fuck.
All right.

1063
01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:48.423
<v 1>Ah,</v>

1064
01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.160
<v 0>that just fucking frustrating.
All right,
that's it.
Go fuck yourselves.</v>

1065
01:04:52.161 --> 01:04:53.030
I'll talk to you next week.
