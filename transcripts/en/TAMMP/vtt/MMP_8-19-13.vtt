00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.900
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:02.901 --> 00:00:06.260
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.820
August 19th,

5
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.170
2013 2013.
Um,

6
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.890
I am still in New Orleans.

7
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.220
My last two days here in New Orleans.
I want to thank everyone.

8
00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:22.500
Do you know what it

9
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.790
<v 2>means to Miss New Orleans?</v>

10
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.840
That's whereby baby goes,

11
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.950
<v 0>okay.</v>

12
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.950
<v 2>She gets a Po boy pukes on a sidewalk down on Bourbon street with all the other</v>

13
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:41.460
fucking whores

14
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.140
<v 1>he up by Darpa.
Doopy Dbu.
You liked that?
That was a little low.</v>

15
00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:48.780
Started off with something,
I dunno,

16
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.850
some sort of basis street blues and I ended up with Clyde Mccoy's sugar blows

17
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.920
for all you out there who enjoy and unbelievably white man playing a muted

18
00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:00.754
trumpet.

19
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.770
I highly recommend listening to Clyde Mccoy's sugar blues.

20
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.150
You know,
if people other than white people were running this country,

21
00:01:13.151 --> 00:01:16.520
after that recording came out,
white people would be,
um,

22
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.700
banned from ever playing the trumpet again.

23
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.070
Now I'm sure there's probably some collide McCoy fans out there and I'm sure I'm

24
00:01:24.071 --> 00:01:26.440
offending you right now,
but I don't give a shit.

25
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.920
The man is no longer with us,
unfortunately.

26
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.800
Can Not play that horn anymore.

27
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.070
Those of you are not going to have time to look it up.

28
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.710
The muted trumpet Song went something like that.

29
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.753
<v 3>Wow.</v>

30
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.730
<v 1>It's literally that bad.
When I was six,
I thought it was good.</v>

31
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.770
Oh fuck.
And you know,
I finally broke down.

32
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.540
I went down to Bourbon Street and uh,

33
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.100
it was 20 to five.

34
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.570
<v 0>Okay.</v>

35
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.820
<v 1>On a Saturday,
20 to five.</v>

36
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.070
What's funny in New Orleans is they have royal street runs parallel to Bourbon

37
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.030
Street.
It's one block,
I guess north of it.
I don't fucking know.

38
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.560
Just night and day.

39
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.920
<v 1>Stay on Royal Street.
It's a bunch of sane people.</v>

41
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.770
Some really unbelievable street performance out here.
Man.

42
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.960
Musicianship is crazy.
But you know,
families,

43
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.570
you know,
fucking uh,
all these antique stores,

44
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.400
the gas lamp placed where they are,
the way they make the gas lamps,
you know,

45
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.330
in case you thought they made the gas lamp shit at some other place they may get

46
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.670
at the gas lamp place they got,

47
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.940
it's just a bunch of Nice stuff where you're like,
oh wow,
what a wonderful town.

48
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.210
Ah,
I'd work all this stuff to do.

49
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.710
<v 0>Okay,</v>

50
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.810
<v 1>good.
Clean,
fun on Royal Street.</v>

51
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.320
You go one block over over and you're on Bourbon Street and it is an absolute

52
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:05.350
shit show.
I saw a,

53
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.480
well she didn't take care of herself so she could have been anywhere from 26 to

54
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.950
about 59.

55
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.330
She had some hard miles people.
All right.
She was running with the,

56
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.000
she was down a couple of courts oil for at least two decades,

57
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:26.040
if you know what I mean.
You might need to work,
you know,

58
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.230
get a little valve job down on you.
Who had their lady.
Um,

59
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.850
anyways,
she's a,
I'm sitting drinking,

60
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.850
<v 0>okay.</v>

61
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.190
<v 1>And uh,
I'm in this bar,
there's nobody else in it.</v>

62
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.390
Everybody in the bar is dress like,
they're like coach from chairs,

63
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.570
then the band,
you know,
and they're playing,

64
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.970
I don't know what the fuck they were playing,

65
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.250
sort of jazzy sorta New Orleans Samad Shit.

66
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.090
And so I'm sitting there and I'm just,
you know,
it's open view.

67
00:03:56.091 --> 00:03:59.660
I'm just watching people going down the street.
I took some video of it.

68
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.190
All right?
It was this white dude with great hair,
you know,

69
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.790
fucking dirty as hell.
Full head of fucking,

70
00:04:07.791 --> 00:04:10.310
this guy could run for office with the head of hair that he had,

71
00:04:10.311 --> 00:04:14.300
but instead he decided to mop the gutters with it for the last fucking,

72
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.150
I don't know,
since the 70s.
And he was out skipping around freaking people out.

73
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.480
He,
you know,
it's funny that guy had been drunk for so long.

74
00:04:23.481 --> 00:04:25.910
When he would sit down,
when anybody would approach him,

75
00:04:25.911 --> 00:04:29.270
he would immediately put his hands up like,
hey man,
I'm not fucking doing,

76
00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:33.290
hey man,
why you half on me?
He's just so used to being hassled,

77
00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:38.291
mad that when somebody comes up to him or he's so used to people coming up to

78
00:04:38.571 --> 00:04:41.930
him,
telling him that he needs to tone down his behavior,

79
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.230
that the second and anybody got in his peripheral,

80
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.010
he immediately put his hands up.
Hey,
you know,
just sitting here,
man.

81
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.100
Um,
he had his little bottle of booze.

82
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.360
Then there was this hilarious black dude,
direct and traffic,

83
00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.303
um,

84
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.020
making most people laugh and driving control freaks out of their fucking minds.

85
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.160
So that was fun.
This is all like 20 to five in the afternoon.

86
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.960
Sun had even started to set and then across the street,
this woman,
I don't,

87
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.020
58 59 maybe early sixties.

88
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.340
She's with her guy and this other couple and she starts getting all fucking

89
00:05:21.381 --> 00:05:25.120
loopy or whatever and she just,
uh,

90
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.760
she blew chow to bring back the old way.

91
00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:31.070
We used to say puked back in the day.

92
00:05:31.071 --> 00:05:35.600
She blew chow all over the fucking sidewalk.
And this is the funny thing,

93
00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:40.220
all she did when she threw up was she just like,
it was like somebody said,

94
00:05:40.221 --> 00:05:43.160
can you see your toes?
And she was like,
you know,
I don't think I've,

95
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.690
I've tried to see my toes in a long time.
She just looked,
just,

96
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.790
she just looked straight down and just fucking yakked

97
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.040
it kind of Rekesh shade off for belly and then hit the sidewalk show.

98
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.090
She was near the landmine,
but was,

99
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.420
was fine as long as she took a step back or if you went right or she went left

100
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.060
and she just fucking,
she went straight.

101
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.010
She took one step and did a Benny Hill fucking slip.
Not really.

102
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.860
She did like she sort of collapsed like Bambi and just landed in,

103
00:06:20.861 --> 00:06:24.310
in our,
our own fucking puke.
Um,

104
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.920
and her friends sort of were comforting her letting her sit in our own pupils.

105
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.860
Fucking unreal.

106
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.430
Then meanwhile the other guy is skipping around with his bottle of booze.

107
00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:38.290
Hey man,
leave me alone.
And uh,
so the guy put them in like a UFC show code,

108
00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:39.970
which I don't even know if he knew the guy.

109
00:06:39.971 --> 00:06:43.900
He just put him into it in a joking way and the drunk do with the great hair

110
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.501
immediately.

111
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:47.500
Just played along and we sticking his tongue out and I don't know what the fuck

112
00:06:47.501 --> 00:06:50.770
was going on.
And then the black guy was still directed traffic am looking at,

113
00:06:50.771 --> 00:06:54.580
my watch is fucking 20th,
five
on a Saturday.

114
00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.480
And the thing is the people who are them who are an absolute fucking mess,

115
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.300
they should be antiquing the age that they were.

116
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.990
And all those stores that are really nice on Royal Street,

117
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.870
all of them were closing up.
That's how I ended up in a bar.
It was like,

118
00:07:10.871 --> 00:07:12.940
why are you guys all closing up?
And they're like,
ah,
you know,

119
00:07:12.941 --> 00:07:16.990
we close up around five gets a little crazy one block.
Oh,

120
00:07:16.991 --> 00:07:21.730
it turns into such a shit show that they just,
they uh,
they just closed down,

121
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.620
um,
or whatever.
So anyways,
I've,
I've had,

122
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.200
despite that crazy story of Anna,

123
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.660
I'd have had a great time down here and I've just kind of becoming a saints fan.

124
00:07:31.661 --> 00:07:35.230
I got to get out of here soon because we've kind of becoming a uh,

125
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.610
a saints fan.
I got all into the sentimental part of it,
of their,

126
00:07:39.611 --> 00:07:41.920
their longtime announcer.
Of course,

127
00:07:41.921 --> 00:07:43.750
I don't want to have his name in front of me here.
I'm going to,

128
00:07:43.751 --> 00:07:48.330
I don't want to butcher this.
He did his last show.
Um,

129
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.670
his last show,
was he doing standup bill now?

130
00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:55.180
He did his last broadcast saints.
Let me look this up here.

131
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.570
So I get this right and fuck all you guys down here in New Orleans giving me

132
00:07:58.571 --> 00:08:03.550
shit right now and not from here.
Retires Bang A,

133
00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:07.750
we go long time saints announcer retires.
Can I get a name?

134
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.640
Jerry roaming and a,
you got to listen to some clips of him on a,

135
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.590
on Youtube.
He's another one of those classic throwback guys.
Total homer.

136
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.760
It's awesome.
And uh,
I hope he doesn't always getting replaced by his son.

137
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.960
So he'll be a homer too.
I just hate when they go from a homer to just some guy.

138
00:08:25.961 --> 00:08:29.050
Well you don't know where they're from and you just get some,

139
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.910
you know what the fuck I'm trying to say.
Anyways,

140
00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:35.050
this is the Monday morning podcast.
Everybody,
um,

141
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.150

I know.

146
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.810
Been dicking around saying that I'm,
I'm doing an episode of Glee.

147
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.210
Obviously you guys don't know that for those of you did look it up.

148
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:05.211
I'm doing a movie down here called black and white with Kevin Costner and

149
00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:09.870
Octavia Spencer.
Um,

150
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.770
and it's been an unbelievable time.
Unbelievable shooting that whole time.

151
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.830
It's been amazing.
So,
uh,
I have this weird sort of,

152
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:20.980
I'm excited to get the fuck Outta here and I'm,
I'm

153
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.470
also going to be a little sad.
Been here for awhile.
Oh.

154
00:09:24.471 --> 00:09:28.770
And also of course directed by my binder.
Um,

155
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:34.220
they all got great Boston names costs this Spencer binder.

156
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.790
Um,
so that,
I don't know when it's going to come up.

157
00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:39.950
Probably going to come out next year.
So,
uh,

158
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.770
I don't know why I'm fucking hyping a movie that we haven't even finished

159
00:09:42.771 --> 00:09:45.110
shooting yet,
but uh,

160
00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:48.110
I guess it's what you have to do nowadays because there's 9,000 channels.

161
00:09:48.111 --> 00:09:52.070
So look out for it.
I think it's going to be a great one.
There we go.

162
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.740
And onto the stories for this week.
A Romanian doctor.

163
00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.700
Um,
did you guys see this story?

164
00:09:58.701 --> 00:10:01.010
This is one of these stories I just don't believe is true.

165
00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:07.290
Even though I retweeted it.
I refuse to believe that this is fucking true.
Says,

166
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:11.780
stressed out doctor cuts off man's Elf.
Patient's penis.

167
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.120
All right.

168
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:15.760
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

169
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.270
<v 1>I don't know how to say the guy's name.
Nom.
See,
oh,</v>

170
00:10:19.271 --> 00:10:23.740
Mu 58,
what is with the 58 year olds this week,

171
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.950
if they're not puking on Bourbon Street,
that cutting off somebodies Dick.

172
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.390
Rarely does this have to do with the size of the moon in the sky.

173
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.830
The moon is minimally.

174
00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.480
They always fucking talk about how that affects your goddamn mood.

175
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:43.300
The moon does it
and exactly.
How does that work?

176
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.350
I would love to just see a table full of scientists listened to this laughing

177
00:10:47.351 --> 00:10:51.130
their asses off right now.
Wiping tears from their eyes unto their fucking,

178
00:10:51.131 --> 00:10:55.540
I'm smart white coach.
Um,
anyways,
uh,
anyways,

179
00:10:55.541 --> 00:11:00.541
now [inaudible] 58 was operating on a man to correct a testicular mealth

180
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:04.000
malformation.

181
00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.190
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

182
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:08.970
<v 1>You see that?
This is a vanity thing.
His balls were working fine.</v>

183
00:11:08.971 --> 00:11:11.850
He just didn't like how one of them looked,
you know,

184
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.730
kind of like when a woman has one wonky teddy,

185
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.640
like once once focused and the other's the backup quarterback checking out the

186
00:11:20.641 --> 00:11:23.580
chicks in the front row.
You know,
so I have a deli.

187
00:11:23.581 --> 00:11:26.630
He had the same problem except it was his bowls.

188
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.790
So what he was,

189
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.290
he lost his temper trying to fix this guy's balls.

190
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

191
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.590
<v 1>Sweet.
Grabs a scalpel and he sliced off the guy's Dick.</v>

192
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:45.200
I love this word here in front of an amazed nursing staff.
Not Horrified.

193
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.490
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

194
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.780
<v 1>Not Nauseated.
Amazed.
How did he do that?</v>

195
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.220
And he would,
would've thought that one of us try to stop them,

196
00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.590
but by the time I realized what he was doing here,
you already did it.

197
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:04.140
Do you think we'll ever be that good at Umaine?
Evidently,

198
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:08.710
that's an amazing thing for a nurse to see in Romania.
They were amazed.

199
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.310
Um,
and then not to mention this,
after he cuts the Dickoff,

200
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.920
he then cuts it into three pieces.

201
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.940
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

202
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.740
<v 1>For those of you mathematicians out there,
that's two cuts.
I,
I,</v>

203
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.350
I wonder if you just stab the scalpel in there,

204
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.200
into the table and then that was it.
Alright.

205
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:31.230
And then he stormed out of the operating theater at the pandery urology hospital

206
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.500
in Bucharest.
That's the capitol to of Romania.

207
00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:38.770
So there's no excuse for this behavior.
This guy should be the best of the best.

208
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:43.360
He's working in the capital.
I could see if he was out in the sticks,
you know,

209
00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.180
I don't know.
Wurster.
Um,

210
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:48.440
<v 0>okay.</v>

211
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.420
<v 1>What the fuck was going through this guy's head?</v>

212
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.100
Did he not have the right equipment?

213
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:57.020
The keep getting the malformed ball into shape and then it kept on mal forming

214
00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.460
and you know,
like when your fucking computer keeps crashing,

215
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.600
that's basically what this guy did you ever get mad at your cell phone and he

216
00:13:06.601 --> 00:13:09.690
just fucking throw it?
He did the,

217
00:13:09.691 --> 00:13:13.530
the medical version of that and evidently that involves cutting off a dick.

218
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.650
Um,
so this,
it gets even weirder.

219
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.520
A Romanian court has ordered professor see Alma,

220
00:13:25.651 --> 00:13:30.651
whatever his name to pay a hundred grand damages and 20 and $20,000 cost to the

221
00:13:32.581 --> 00:13:33.414
victim.

222
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:35.470
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

223
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.630
<v 1>whatever's costs.</v>

224
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

225
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.590
<v 1>Did you still charge them for the operation?
Well,
you know,</v>

226
00:13:40.591 --> 00:13:44.010
we did kind of shape up,
what are your balls?
Tell you what that was going to be,

227
00:13:44.011 --> 00:13:44.761
40 grand,

228
00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:49.290
but we'll take 50% off and all the gods unique.

229
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:55.110
Um,
in this guy was a 36 year old build,
a 36 year old.
The trauma,

230
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.910
the gun,
this is what the guys,
now this is the hits.

231
00:13:56.911 --> 00:13:58.410
This is underwhelming statement.

232
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.730
The trauma has left a deep mark both physically and psychologically.

233
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:07.290
It's hard for a man who wants to have sex.
Sex yet lacks the Oregon.

234
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:12.620
My wife is the best thing I have as just for this one worst fucking thing.

235
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.190
There's no way this is true.

236
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:15.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

237
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.740
<v 1>How do you,
how do you know this shit is true?</v>

238
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.130
Even if you see it on,
I saw it on the news.
So what?

239
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:24.380
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

240
00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.420
<v 1>So what,
how do you,
how do you know what happened?</v>

241
00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.930
They look up to Susan.
Another one.

242
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.270
This was the one up in a new fileman,
right?

243
00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:44.290
40 pythons found in Canada motel 10 days after two boys were killed by an escape

244
00:14:45.111 --> 00:14:48.950
snake.
Did you see that story?
Like how do you,

245
00:14:48.951 --> 00:14:50.810
how do you fucking know that that happened?

246
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:57.490
I'd let you were there.
Other than that,

247
00:14:57.491 --> 00:15:01.150
I'm just sitting there and I'm listening to some woman talking and then they got

248
00:15:01.151 --> 00:15:04.690
a picture of a snake over a fucking shoulder and then they cut to somebody

249
00:15:04.691 --> 00:15:09.070
standing out in front of the house.
It's true,
Jennifer,
it's trill,
tragedy,

250
00:15:09.071 --> 00:15:11.470
dead strike today in this great house.

251
00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:15.940
If he could see that window air as well versus snake was and somehow,

252
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:20.350
I don't know how it went up the stairs.
I mean maybe they had those round ones,

253
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.190
you know,

254
00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.850
the spiral staircase and it went up the stripper pole that's in the middle.

255
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.490
I have no idea.
But anyway,

256
00:15:27.491 --> 00:15:32.260
somehow it managed to get up to the second floor,
had a eight,
not one but two.

257
00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:38.520
They basically said that there was very abnormal for a snake for snake lovers.

258
00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.260
He's been to Canadian brothers,

259
00:15:41.261 --> 00:15:45.670
apparently squeezed to death by a 15 foot African python.

260
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.610
Uh,
they were typical children who enjoyed life to the maximum.
Yeah.
Well,

261
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.790
I mean there's six and four.

262
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.850
What's one of them looking through a fucking telescope already?

263
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.480
I guess it could be an advanced learning.
Everybody is typical at six.

264
00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:03.740
And for that I missed my calling.
I maybe this is like,

265
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.320
this is what I should've done.
I should've written news articles.

266
00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:10.640
This is how fucking dumb you can be.
The nursing staff was,
hey,

267
00:16:10.641 --> 00:16:15.140
what's that word?
Uh,
just amazed.

268
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:20.000
Amazed,
amazed.
Yeah.
That sounds good.
What are you getting for lunch?
Um,

269
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:24.920
and spent the last days alive playing with animals on a farm.

270
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.150
A relative said Tuesday,

271
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:30.330
the boys were as sleepover and an apartment above a pet store when the snake

272
00:16:30.331 --> 00:16:35.030
struck Canadian police said it's slithered Oh,
did it?

273
00:16:35.031 --> 00:16:36.170
And it didn't walk into the room.

274
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.930
It's sluggards slithered through the top of its,

275
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.810
it's Florida ceiling cage.

276
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.070
Jesus Christ.

277
00:16:45.071 --> 00:16:48.820
I don't have a whole connected to a ventilation system and dropped from the

278
00:16:48.821 --> 00:16:53.650
living room ceiling when a pipe broke autopsies.

279
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:57.490
Oh my God.
It's terrible.
So then it was,
this guy says that this was not,

280
00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:03.890
um,
said it was abnormal for a snake to go on a,

281
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:04.913
on a killing spree.

282
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.650
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

283
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.520
<v 1>You know,
which I believe that,
right?
They just kind of,</v>

284
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.030
they just take what they need.
They all eat just enough.

285
00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:15.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

286
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.250
<v 1>You look it.
When's the last time you saw a fat snake?
I mean,</v>

287
00:17:17.251 --> 00:17:21.270
there were all muscle.
All right,
so this one,

288
00:17:21.271 --> 00:17:25.810
I don't know what this fucking thinks
deal was.

289
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.230
<v 0>Okay.</v>

290
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.200
<v 1>It was like thanksgiving.
It just fucking kept going.</v>

291
00:17:30.201 --> 00:17:32.960
But how am I really talking about a snake?
They killed two fucking little boys.

292
00:17:32.961 --> 00:17:36.370
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All right.
What am I going to do?

293
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:40.280
Make Fun of the Po boys in the Goddamn fucking paddle boat out there again?

294
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:45.650
Oh,
they're fucking paddle boats driving me nuts.
Fortunately it's out to see.

295
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:49.980
Can you be out to sea on a river?
What is an Eddie?
Does anybody know?

296
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.840
What is the difference between a C and an ocean?

297
00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.520
That's the kind of thing like if,

298
00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.840
if you're not a captain or you're not in the navy.

299
00:17:59.370 --> 00:17:59.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

300
00:17:59.640 --> 00:17:59.881
<v 1>I mean,</v>

301
00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:02.580
I bet half the people in the fucking Navy couldn't tell you the difference

302
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:05.850
between an eddy as see a Gulf.

303
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:07.730
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

304
00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:11.150
<v 1>Everything to me is the ocean.
Like the Gulf of Mexico.
To me,</v>

305
00:18:11.151 --> 00:18:12.290
that's the fucking ocean.

306
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.360
I'll be talking to me how old it's surrounded on three sides yet and what

307
00:18:17.361 --> 00:18:20.870
fucking 9,000 miles in each direction.
I'm in the middle of the fucking ocean.

308
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:22.470
<v 0>Okay.</v>

309
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:23.303
<v 1>Right.</v>

310
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.820
The only reason why the great lakes aren't oceans to me is because they're not

311
00:18:27.821 --> 00:18:31.780
salty.
I stick my face in them.
I don't golf.

312
00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.580
I don't do that shit.

313
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.860
And you know that one that they have out there in California,
the salt and sea,

314
00:18:39.861 --> 00:18:44.560
that's all salty.
That's the fucking ocean.
It's not a lake.

315
00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.700
It's not a c that is the fucking ocean got left.

316
00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.780
It got left behind like Willem Defoe and um,

317
00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.560
in platoon.
You know,
I just found out all that out that thought,

318
00:18:58.561 --> 00:19:01.470
that the whole,
that desert out there,
they used to be the bottom of an ocean.

319
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:06.160
I had no idea.
So wouldn't that mean
no,

320
00:19:06.161 --> 00:19:07.540
that wouldn't mean that I was gonna say that.

321
00:19:07.541 --> 00:19:12.230
This is fucking dinosaurs down there.
There's some sort of oil.

322
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.030
Do they have a drill in the desert foil?
Dude?

323
00:19:17.031 --> 00:19:21.530
What the fuck you think you're Middle East?
He is.
Oh,
go fuck yourself.

324
00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.990
You haven't been there.
You don't even know what it looks like.

325
00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.950
You just see it on the news like I do.
What does the Middle East to you?

326
00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:28.830
<v 0>Okay.</v>

327
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.800
<v 1>What is it?
Huh?
Our planes flying in there.
People throwing rocks at him.</v>

328
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.130
That's your geography before you get on your fucking high horse,
dude,
I'm sorry.

329
00:19:37.131 --> 00:19:41.480
I'm in this mood.
I am bored shitless out here.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
I'm done.

330
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.190
I've got two more days.

331
00:19:43.191 --> 00:19:46.150
I want to bang this shit out and I want to get an a first fucking one smoking

332
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.980
and get the fuck out of here.
I've had it.
I need to go home.

333
00:19:48.981 --> 00:19:53.450
I need a beat with my stuff.
All right.
I miss my stuff.

334
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:54.760
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

335
00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.800
<v 1>You know,
I really miss them.
I miss my pajamas.</v>

336
00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.590
I haven't seen my pajamas at a month.

337
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:01.380
<v 0>Okay.</v>

338
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.700
<v 1>How long do you have pajamas before you lose the top?</v>

339
00:20:03.701 --> 00:20:05.940
You don't even know where the fuck it is.
You only wear the bottoms,
right?

340
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:10.650
Just walking around,
scratching your balls,
making that face.

341
00:20:10.651 --> 00:20:13.560
When you look into the kick in the refrigerator and there's just nothing there

342
00:20:13.561 --> 00:20:17.250
that looks edible anyway,
everything's work.

343
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:22.800
Um,
anyways,
let's do it.
Let's do a little,
a little advertising for the week here.

344
00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:25.440
Um,
dollar shave club,
everybody,

345
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.700
there are so many things in the world that irritate me.

346
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:34.050
Raccoon hands.
I don't like to hit they,
I don't like the raccoon hats.

347
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.740
They creep me out.
The word expedite.
I don't like that word.

348
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.900
I don't even think it is a word.

349
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

350
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:42.390
<v 1>All right.
If it is a word,</v>

351
00:20:42.391 --> 00:20:45.780
it became a word from storage to saying it because the only fucking people I've

352
00:20:45.781 --> 00:20:48.990
ever heard say it and uh,
what else?
Oh,

353
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.120
people will hold their nose before jumping into a pool.
You know?

354
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:57.880
Can you just breathe out?
You know,
can't you just do that?
How old are you?

355
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:02.800
Right.
Um,
anyways,
with all the,
so many things in the world that can irritate you,

356
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.430
why would you let your razors add to it?
That doesn't make any sense.

357
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.780
What I'm trying to say is stop milking your razor blade for the entire month.

358
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.830
You know,
digging up your face.
I know the brand name razors,

359
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:18.940
you're used to paying outrageous prices and exhausting those raises until they

360
00:21:18.941 --> 00:21:22.630
start to look like a rusty code.
It soda.
Can I realize this?
Well,

361
00:21:22.631 --> 00:21:24.550
it's time to let that go.
Stein to move on.

362
00:21:24.551 --> 00:21:29.410

It turns out you elected the wrong guy.
You didn't like him.

428
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:24.170
You just got to wait for the next election and then you vote the bum out.

00:25:29.451 --> 00:25:32.780
Here comes the army,
right?

431
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.200
He's sitting there with fucking rocks in a dream.
I don't know.

432
00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:39.700
It doesn't work out too good.
Um,

433
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:45.590
all right.
This is a fucking disjointed podcasts I've ever heard.

434
00:25:45.591 --> 00:25:49.400
One.
I swear to God sometimes I really wonder why you guys continue to listen.

435
00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.960
Oh,
Bill,
stop fucking me.
Oh,
you know bill w why,
why,
why?

436
00:25:53.961 --> 00:25:54.651
What are you going to be like?

437
00:25:54.651 --> 00:25:56.750
That guy who threatens to kill himself and never does.

438
00:25:56.751 --> 00:26:00.290
Just so he can hear so much.
People love him and the way you listen to that.

439
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:05.240
Oh Bill,
don't stop podcasting me.
Love your podcast and your red cunt.
All right,

440
00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:09.590
follow up on salads.
Let's get into the,
uh,
the emails for the week.

441
00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.190
Oh,
you know what I didn't finish last week was I started to say I was actually

442
00:26:14.191 --> 00:26:18.630
rooting for a rod and people mentioned that I,
I forgot to say why.

443
00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:20.770
Um,

444
00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:23.060
<v 0>okay.</v>

445
00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:27.140
<v 1>I Dunno why it was something about everybody bowing and that just made me a,</v>

446
00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:27.983
it just,

447
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.560
<v 0>yeah,</v>

448
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:34.480
<v 1>just the level with which people were booing the guy,
you know,</v>

449
00:26:34.481 --> 00:26:36.670
and I'm a complete look.
This is how I look at it.

450
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.490
I can't judge the dude.

451
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:45.120
The only way you could pull them like that as if lived a perfect life.
All right.

452
00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:50.370
All that money on the fucking table.
C'Mon.
Complete piece of shit like me.

453
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.450
He think I'm not going to fucking do some roids to hang in the game.

454
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.500
Do you think if they made a steroid that allowed you to read advertising

455
00:26:58.501 --> 00:26:59.221
smoothly?

456
00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:03.420
That I wouldn't be on the juice right now just so I could stay in the podcasting

457
00:27:03.421 --> 00:27:07.740
league for another couple of years too,
for the kids.
I don't have the feed.

458
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:13.410
Um,
there's,
I,
you know what it is.
I don't like how people,

459
00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:15.790
they,
uh,

460
00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:22.690
I don't think it's fair that they look at like entertainers and athletes the way

461
00:27:22.691 --> 00:27:26.840
they do and start saying,
this is what's wrong with this country.
We blue,
blue,

462
00:27:26.841 --> 00:27:29.100
blue,
blue.
They still going down like that and then they just fuck it.

463
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:32.200
Let bankers go.
If they,

464
00:27:32.201 --> 00:27:36.820
if they gave just as much more shit to bankers and then they came on athletes

465
00:27:36.821 --> 00:27:38.980
and entertainment,
it's like that.
I'd be like,
all right,
that makes sense.

466
00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.760
That makes sense to me.
You don't,
I'm going to do,
I'm going to go,

467
00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:46.510
I'm going to fucking start my own trading cards rather than tops like baseball

468
00:27:46.511 --> 00:27:48.400
or football cards.
I'm going to start mine.

469
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.150
It's going to be banker cards so everybody knows what they look like and they're

470
00:27:52.151 --> 00:27:55.330
fucking,
stats will be on the back.
All the horrific shit that they did.

471
00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.720
And I dunno,
maybe they'd get booed when they're on the way to their lobster.

472
00:27:58.721 --> 00:28:02.290
Fucking and crusted lunch when that be nice every once in a while.

473
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.980
So there you have it for some stupid reason.
I'm rooting for a Rod.

474
00:28:05.981 --> 00:28:09.730
I want them to hit him a bunch of fucking home runs and a,

475
00:28:09.731 --> 00:28:10.990
I dunno what after that.

476
00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:12.720
<v 0>Okay.</v>

477
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.260
<v 1>Just cause everybody,
I'm only a few people booed him.
I'd still be against them.</v>

478
00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:19.080
But the fact that everybody was just fucking trash and it was a couple of people

479
00:28:19.081 --> 00:28:23.220
had sides but a some more on said the other day.
Well you know it's good.

480
00:28:23.221 --> 00:28:26.550
I'll leave.
P Days really puts that pleat rose.

481
00:28:26.551 --> 00:28:30.300
They get a perspective what it now.
No it doesn't.

482
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.710
No it doesn't.
Gambling is the worst fucking thing you can do.

483
00:28:34.711 --> 00:28:39.210
It's worse than PDS.
It's worse than an individual cheating.
All right.

484
00:28:39.211 --> 00:28:41.010
You're talking about when you start gambling,

485
00:28:41.011 --> 00:28:42.930
you're talking about throwing the game.

486
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:44.460
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

487
00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.190
<v 1>Then it becomes wrestling.
Right.</v>

488
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.700
And I'm not saying that on a certain level that you're,
you're up in the anti,

489
00:28:50.701 --> 00:28:53.700
but the pds you definitely are.
But gambling is the worse.

490
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:55.260
The outcome of the game.

491
00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:56.650
<v 0>Okay.</v>

492
00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:59.260
<v 1>CanNot be decided before the fucker gave starts.</v>

493
00:28:59.261 --> 00:29:01.540
You can't have people doing that shit.
All right.

494
00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:05.530
You want to take some Gogo juice and maybe change the outcome.

495
00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.560
I think that's half as bad.
Why is my voice,
you know,

496
00:29:08.561 --> 00:29:13.270
when I was in a bar last night screaming over music,
um,
it's not as bad.

497
00:29:13.271 --> 00:29:15.790
And for everybody who's going to send me a fucking email about

498
00:29:15.791 --> 00:29:18.760
it@billatthempodcast.com I'm telling you right now,

499
00:29:18.761 --> 00:29:21.430
I'm closed off to your opinions.
You can try and sway me,

500
00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:22.940
<v 0>okay?</v>

501
00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.100
<v 1>But I don't want to fucking hear it.
Gambling on baseball,</v>

502
00:29:25.101 --> 00:29:28.460
it's the worst thing you can do.
That's why they have it over every,
every thing.

503
00:29:28.461 --> 00:29:31.370
When you walk down the tunnel,
that's what they have.
Oh,
by the way,

504
00:29:31.371 --> 00:29:34.460
don't go out there and throw the game.
This isn't wrestling.
All right?

505
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.220
Put on Jaqual Velvet.
Go out there and try.

506
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:42.000
All right,
sorry.
Follow

507
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.410
<v 0>up on Salads.
People,
Bill,</v>

508
00:29:44.411 --> 00:29:47.980
I make salads for a living while eating vegetables from your grocery store is

509
00:29:47.981 --> 00:29:50.230
better than nothing.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

510
00:29:50.231 --> 00:29:53.350
You're going to talk about pesticides and then kill me.
He goes,

511
00:29:53.351 --> 00:29:56.920
you should urge your listeners to go to independent farm stands.

512
00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.410
I'm from New England and they're everywhere.

513
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.770
Try smelling a peach this from a farm versus one from the grocery store.

514
00:30:02.771 --> 00:30:07.000
This guy's 100% right.
He goes,
you should go to a farmer's market.

515
00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.270
The one from the grocery store won't smell it all.

516
00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:14.680
It's because they picked it too soon and lacks up to 75% of the nutrients.
Yeah.

517
00:30:14.681 --> 00:30:16.270
That's why tomatoes tastes like shit.

518
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.180
And people when they make a [inaudible] salad,

519
00:30:19.181 --> 00:30:22.320
they'll fucking put the Balsamic vinegarette on it to try and,
oh,
are you make a,

520
00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:26.080
uh,
when you make your pizza sauce,
they always end up throwing,
you know,

521
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:31.370
<v 1>whatever fucking third,
a cup of sugar,
depending on how much you fucking use it.</v>

522
00:30:31.371 --> 00:30:34.940
But that,
that's the natural sweetness that isn't in the tomato.

523
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:39.320
Because from what I've kind of read on a website,
maybe

524
00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.930
like a,
hey,
maybe you can handle this fuck.
head.com.

525
00:30:43.931 --> 00:30:48.640
I think I went to that and they were talking about tomatoes or anyways,
so once,

526
00:30:48.641 --> 00:30:53.610
once you,
basically
the,
the,
the fruit of the vegetable gets all,

527
00:30:53.611 --> 00:30:57.570
it's all it's nutrients from the vine or the branch,
the tree,

528
00:30:57.571 --> 00:31:00.600
whatever the fuck is hanging from.
Right.
So once you yanked it off,

529
00:31:00.601 --> 00:31:04.200
it's all okay.
Uh,

530
00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.020
I can't use that reference.

531
00:31:07.021 --> 00:31:10.560
I wasn't talking about taking a baby out of a womb too early as disgusting cause

532
00:31:10.561 --> 00:31:15.220
we're talking about eating something.
Alright.
No Jesus Christ.
Um,

533
00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.150
anyways,
yeah,
if you go down to your farmer's markets much better.

534
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:22.810
That's what he's trying to say.
But I've actually seen the thing where age,

535
00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:26.300
they're starting to infiltrate the farmer's markets because those cons can just

536
00:31:26.301 --> 00:31:31.180
not make enough money.
Um,
but anyways,
thank you for the followup.

537
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:34.910
I would have liked if he gave me a recipe for a couple of salads.

538
00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:39.490
If you make sales for a living,
that would be great.
Help help the listeners out.

539
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:43.060
Give us a little variety.
Give a gift.
I want three here.

540
00:31:43.061 --> 00:31:47.080
One to ease somebody in to the fact that they're reading salad.

541
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.900
If they went from eating a goat's head every God damn day.

542
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:55.150
And then the second one,
um,
I don't know,
make it down a medium sized one.

543
00:31:55.151 --> 00:31:56.520
And then the last one is a few.

544
00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.340
We'll just want to shoot your brains out and have energy of Superman.
All right.

545
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.370
How bout,
how bout,
how bout three salads like that?
That's my request,
sir.

546
00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:07.780
Thank you.
Send it to the,
to bill at the [inaudible] podcast.com.
All right.

547
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.080
All right,
here we go.
Follow up from a lady.

548
00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:11.940
<v 0>Okay.</v>

549
00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.440
<v 1>Hey Billy,
I'm a lady.
Just want to uh,</v>

550
00:32:15.441 --> 00:32:20.441
offer a piece of advice or referring to the guy on your last podcast who called

551
00:32:21.091 --> 00:32:24.600
in about his ex girlfriend texting him after they had broken up.

552
00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.060
Um,
she says,

553
00:32:28.061 --> 00:32:31.480
I have actually been one of those country girls you were talking about and have

554
00:32:31.481 --> 00:32:33.010
broken up with guys in the past.

555
00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:37.480
My advice to guys listening out there is the absolute best thing you could do

556
00:32:37.481 --> 00:32:42.481
when an x calls or texts you is to remain completely bored sounding on the

557
00:32:43.551 --> 00:32:48.200
phone.
Oh,
completely bored standing on the phone,
never text or call them back.

558
00:32:48.201 --> 00:32:52.580
Sound is distant and un and as uninterrupted as possible.

559
00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:54.920
Um,
when talking to them,

560
00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:59.780
guaranteed the x will never ever call again because it's humiliating.

561
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:02.030
That was my experience anyways.

562
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:05.660
Your advice was correct that you need to just cut the cancer out,

563
00:33:05.661 --> 00:33:10.280
delete from cell phone,
unfriend,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Hope you read this out loud.

564
00:33:10.281 --> 00:33:13.820
Okay?
Sometimes it helps to put a finger under each word.
When reading

565
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:22.010
she said just being cheeky.
Um,
God,

566
00:33:22.011 --> 00:33:25.550
I hate that fucking word.
Are you being shaky?

567
00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:27.800
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

568
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:32.340
<v 1>All right.
So there's great advice from a lady.
There you go.
She says,</v>

569
00:33:32.341 --> 00:33:36.780
just sound completely as completely bored and uninterested as possible.

570
00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:40.320
It's humiliating to them.
Yeah,
because you really,
you know what you're doing.

571
00:33:40.321 --> 00:33:42.780
You're pouring water on the lightsaber basically.

572
00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:46.900
Does that make any sense?
Well,
lightsaber it looks more like a dick.

573
00:33:46.901 --> 00:33:47.800
What am I trying to say?

574
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:51.850
Was there anything that somebody used as a Jetta that kind of looked like a

575
00:33:51.851 --> 00:33:52.684
fucking pot?

576
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.360
<v 0>Okay.</v>

577
00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.290
<v 1>That lit up that you could pour water on.
Was that electricity?</v>

578
00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:00.420
That's what I was thinking.
Do you pour water on and what would that do?

579
00:34:00.421 --> 00:34:02.340
Would probably Zap your hand if he had a metal.
Fucking,

580
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.680
my reference is a fucking terrible this week.

581
00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:10.010
You shutting off their,
uh,
I dunno.
Yeah.
Turn it off their pussy.

582
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:16.010
Gaslamp above their pussy.
You're just putting it out.
Um,

583
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.200
the best thing to do is you just fucking get away from them.

584
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.810
Are they going to make your life a living?
Hell?
That's what they do.

585
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:25.880
They don't Duke it out,
except for those broads on the UFC jab to the,

586
00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:29.840
to the tit jab to the tit uppercut to the fucking areola.

587
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.920
These body blows up.
Brodo kick to the womb.

588
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.700
Oh,
right in the VJ j.

589
00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:42.470
She's got to fucking hang a Fred the standing eight count.
All right.

590
00:34:42.471 --> 00:34:46.700
Was he a virgin?
Dare belly their belt.
First of all,

591
00:34:46.701 --> 00:34:50.610
I'd like to say I'm a huge fan from your hometown of a walk,

592
00:34:50.611 --> 00:34:55.100
a Luca Maka Duca.
You are a comedian.
You are my comedian crush.

593
00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:59.600
I absolutely love you.
While you've obviously never met me,
believe me,

594
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:02.930
I'm a piece of shit and up.
Difficult to live with,

595
00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.260
so why don't you set your standards a little higher?

596
00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:10.250
He says now to the problem,
I was celibate for almost two years.

597
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:14.630
I grew tired of it and decided to sleep with a guy I've liked for a little.

598
00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:19.370
I'd like for a little,
but I didn't know him too well.
Let me start by saying,

599
00:35:19.371 --> 00:35:23.360
honestly,
this isn't something I do ever,
but I needed to get laid.

600
00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.240
It was a slutty thing to do now wasn't,

601
00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:30.860
it was alright.
It wasn't,

602
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:35.480
he fucking have that urge.
Whatever you want,
how you did it,
fuck you going to do.

603
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.580
Um,
but oh well.

604
00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.930
I was good long and I was good for long enough.
Anyways.

605
00:35:42.931 --> 00:35:46.350
He's a little socially awkward and quiet,
which I initially thought was cute,

606
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:50.940
but found out there's a lot more awkwardness in them.
I don't know.

607
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.450
The date itself was awkward,
but I was Horny and he's a nice guy,

608
00:35:54.451 --> 00:35:59.220
so I wanted to get,
so I wanted to get it in.
All right.

609
00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.300
First it's not fucking around here.
Um,

610
00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:09.410
he started by nestling his head in my breasts and rubbing his nose on them in

611
00:36:10.171 --> 00:36:14.730
between and all around.
He did this also when I got on top of him,

612
00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.990
but when he did it,
he,
he did something extremely strange.

613
00:36:18.991 --> 00:36:23.910
He squeezed my breasts very rapidly,
almost as if to haunt them.

614
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:28.110
I laughed at first because I thought he was playing,
but he kept doing that.

615
00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:30.710
And then he did the same thing to my ass.
Multiple

616
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:38.070
God,
he,
she says,

617
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:42.630
well endowed in both of those areas so I understand and playing with them.

618
00:36:42.631 --> 00:36:47.040
But something was strange about it.
This is really fucking weird me out.

619
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:47.910
I don't know why.

620
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:49.490
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

621
00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:52.220
<v 1>Oh go,
go,
go,
go,
go.
Then beaches,
download Bogle,
Bobo,
Bobo.</v>

622
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:56.500
Was he doing it like at the same time or was he like alternating with each
hands?

623
00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:00.470
He should have been doing that while winking either.
I,
you know,

624
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:02.720
just completely freaking you on.

625
00:37:02.721 --> 00:37:06.440
Occasionally sticking his tongue out and you'd go into some sort of fucking

626
00:37:06.441 --> 00:37:10.820
epileptic seizure.
Anyway,
she said when he touched me anywhere else,

627
00:37:10.821 --> 00:37:13.070
he would only use the palm of his hand.

628
00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.100
At one point we were laying next to each other on the bed,

629
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:19.400
maybe just doesn't know what he's doing and I guess he remembered.

630
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:21.440
I said I liked my hair pulled,

631
00:37:21.441 --> 00:37:24.740
so he randomly grabbed a fist full of my hair and he yanked it.

632
00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:29.420
This sounds like somebody who can't dance trying to dance to something,

633
00:37:29.421 --> 00:37:33.080
uptempo.
This is fucking horrific.
I feel horrible for this guy.

634
00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:38.140
Like this is like,
this is such a bad performance.

635
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.040
This is like a first round draft pick bust like three games and you're like,

636
00:37:44.041 --> 00:37:46.710
oh my God,
what did we just throw a million dollars at?
This is over.

637
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:48.440
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

638
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:52.010
<v 1>give this guy a clipboard.
Um,
anyways,</v>

639
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:55.340
she said we were not even having sex yet and it and it,

640
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:58.820
and it wasn't like he guided my head to his lap or anything.

641
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:01.223
What,

642
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:07.450
when we finally did have sex,
it lasted less than a minute.

643
00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:11.380
And I'm not exaggerating when he told me he was about to finish,

644
00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:15.220
I told him to get on top so we could have more control.

645
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:16.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

646
00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.680
<v 1>But he put all of his body weight on me and was done in half a stroke.</v>

647
00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:26.180
Oh,
like
all in one.
All right.

648
00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:31.840
He fucking threw the Hail Mary again.
I'm not exaggerating.

649
00:38:31.841 --> 00:38:35.080
He went down on me to compensate and I'll spare you further.

650
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.760
But he knew nothing about what he was doing.
Yeah,
I kind of gathered that.

651
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.870
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

652
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:44.520
<v 1>that was nice throughout this because I never thought,</v>

653
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:48.660
because I never would want to give anyone a complex,

654
00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:52.410
but when you fucking said where you live,
so I feel bad about this.

655
00:38:52.411 --> 00:38:54.780
I want to have to uh,
have that bleeped out.

656
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:57.750
I'm going to bleep that out and I want to fucking blow up.

657
00:38:57.751 --> 00:39:02.410
Anybody spun at 38 minutes in.
All right.
All right.
All right.
39 minutes.
Um,

658
00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.220
I'll spare you the further details,
but he knew nothing about what he's doing.

659
00:39:05.221 --> 00:39:08.520
I was nice throughout this because I never would want to give anyone a complex,

660
00:39:08.521 --> 00:39:12.510
but dude,
what the fuck did I just fucking autistic man or a virgin?

661
00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:16.620
He's 26 and he's a sweet guy.
I almost want to teach him,

662
00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:22.050
but I don't want to insult him.
Any advice?
All right,

663
00:39:22.051 --> 00:39:24.060
well first things first deal like the guy.

664
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:25.010
<v 0>Okay.</v>

665
00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:26.160
<v 1>The,
even like the guy.</v>

666
00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:27.830
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

667
00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.690
<v 1>Before you get involved in this,</v>

668
00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:32.750
the money pit here as far as fixer up houses goes.

669
00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:35.163
<v 4>MMM.</v>

670
00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:41.380
<v 1>I Dunno from,
no,
I don't know if he would just trying to be funny.</v>

671
00:39:41.381 --> 00:39:45.390
But from the way you describe this,
you know,
there,

672
00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.330
there has to be a jumping off point.

673
00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:48.180
<v 0>Okay?</v>

674
00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:52.380
<v 1>Oh,
who knows?
Who knows?
Maybe.
Maybe.
I Dunno.
I don't fucking know.</v>

675
00:39:52.381 --> 00:39:53.570
26 years old,

676
00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.600
I dunno.
And he's fucking grabbing your ass.

677
00:39:59.601 --> 00:40:02.000
Like if you see somebody who knows how to make an Omelet really quick and can

678
00:40:02.001 --> 00:40:04.850
fucking open them up eggs with one hand does like he's doing that with your

679
00:40:04.851 --> 00:40:09.220
fucking titties in your ass.
It's just weird.
But you see,
all right,

680
00:40:09.221 --> 00:40:11.950
I want to go with you like him because what can you do?

681
00:40:11.951 --> 00:40:15.970
A Jesus cry though?
Where to start?

682
00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:23.520
You didn't even mention him kissing you.
You know I,

683
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:26.220
I don't know.
I think this guy's fucking weird.

684
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.480
<v 0>Okay.</v>

685
00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.790
<v 1>The fuck was with the nose all around your titties.</v>

686
00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.400
I don't know what to tell you.

687
00:40:34.401 --> 00:40:37.020
I got to give you advice here because this is the advice part.

688
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:38.310
<v 4>Okay?</v>

689
00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:41.520
<v 1>I almost want to teach them.
I don't want to insult him.
Any advice?</v>

690
00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.790
How the fuck do you go about that?
It's just such a fucking man.
You know?

691
00:40:46.791 --> 00:40:49.490
Usually when you give somebody advice,
you know who's sensitive.

692
00:40:49.491 --> 00:40:53.090
What you do is you compliment the things that they did well first and then you

693
00:40:53.091 --> 00:40:56.660
ease into a,
they this could maybe use a little work here,

694
00:40:56.661 --> 00:40:59.240
not saying you bed because you did this well,
just saying this over here,

695
00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.780
maybe is there,
what,
did he do?
Anything?
Well,

696
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:11.520
how was he when he pulled his pants back up?
Was that pretty smooth?
Uh,
you know,

697
00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.150
he gets ball stuck in the Zipper,
was able to not do that.

698
00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:16.710
Maybe you could start with that.

699
00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:19.643
<v 4>MMM.</v>

700
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:25.510
<v 1>Oh Jesus,
isn't it?
So this is why women are so amazing.</v>

701
00:41:25.511 --> 00:41:27.730
The fact that she's actually willing to work with this,

702
00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.830
she's going to try to make this work.

703
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.160
<v 4>Don't,
I don't know.</v>

704
00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.450
<v 1>I,
I guess I would try and figure out something that he did well and I would</v>

705
00:41:39.451 --> 00:41:43.200
compliment that and then I would just start chipping away at the mountain.

706
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.700
<v 0>Okay.</v>

707
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:46.950
<v 1>I wouldn't try to bring the whole mountain down in one day,</v>

708
00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.210
<v 4>but uh,</v>

709
00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:53.340
<v 1>you know,
just know you,
you get,
you get a long fucking road ahead of you.</v>

710
00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.630
Jesus Christ.
He took two years off from sex and that you,
you know,

711
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:05.700
it sounds like you were having sex with like the first robot ever and it was

712
00:42:05.701 --> 00:42:09.450
somebody like controlling of,
you know,

713
00:42:09.451 --> 00:42:13.650
and they had an inability to,
to they have robot hands caress.

714
00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:18.220
So when you know,
comments,
correct.
Caressing,
right mom,
hey mom.
Right,
right.

715
00:42:18.221 --> 00:42:20.790
It was just,
it was meeting dough.

716
00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:25.930
Ah,
Jesus.
Hey,
good luck with that.

717
00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:31.330
I'm sorry I got to start sending DVDs to people who I just can't fucking come up

718
00:42:31.331 --> 00:42:35.410
with anything.
I got,
I got nothing.
All right.
Nicknames though.

719
00:42:35.411 --> 00:42:38.260
What is the best way to respond to a nickname that you hate?

720
00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:43.510
I recently got one dude who was simple rhyme with my name.
Uh,

721
00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:46.990
I didn't do anything stupid or conti to earn it.
It was funny at first,

722
00:42:46.991 --> 00:42:51.860
but after a few months I find myself getting annoyed and angry when called by my

723
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:55.690
fee,
by this name.
Most people have moved on and stop calling me that.
However,

724
00:42:55.691 --> 00:42:58.660
two or three people still greet me with it every chance they get.

725
00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:03.010
How do I share this name without looking like a Douche and potentially making

726
00:43:03.011 --> 00:43:04.360
things worse?
All right.
First of all,

727
00:43:04.361 --> 00:43:08.350
you don't let on how much it bugs you and then what you do is you come back

728
00:43:08.351 --> 00:43:10.720
giving him the fucking Howard,
sir.
All right?

729
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:14.980
You got to come back with the anti aircraft.
You got to look.

730
00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:17.950
You got to come up with nicknames for these fucking people.

731
00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.550
Just start with one guy.
Don't do all three at once.

732
00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.910
They'll know what you're up to.
Just pick one guy.
All right?

733
00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:28.720
We're going to slowly whack these gripes.
The one,
one by one,
get this dude,

734
00:43:28.721 --> 00:43:33.490
that guy.
Then you get mo green through his fucking glasses and we're done.
Um,

735
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:36.100
they got a big nose.

736
00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:40.900
Something physically fucked up about their face.

737
00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:46.350
They got man tits.
They'll get it real quick.
They call calling you something.
EA.

738
00:43:46.351 --> 00:43:49.300
What?
What's up there?
Flabby tits or man,
ted.
So just something,

739
00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:53.020
something about them that you know that they hate about themselves.

740
00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:58.060
Hopefully something that's unfixable.
You know,

741
00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:01.960
unless they went under the knife and God knows what they'll do it in Romania.

742
00:44:01.961 --> 00:44:03.250
Right.
That's what I would do.

743
00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:06.700
But the first thing you do it do not let on that it bugs you.

744
00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:10.570
So when they call you,
whatever they call,
you,
just sort of laugh,

745
00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:13.930
big smile,
and then you just fucking hit him with you.

746
00:44:13.931 --> 00:44:17.350
Give him the old right there,
Fred.
All right,
that'll shut them up.

747
00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:22.090
Hopefully that's what I would do.
Or You just quit.
Your job

748
00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:28.450
fails.
You get the fuck out of there.
Change your name.

749
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:34.020
Uh,
the worst thing you want to do is go stop
that.
Then that just,

750
00:44:34.021 --> 00:44:38.710
it's fucking,
it's over.
It's over.
Um,

751
00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:43.440
then you have live action.
Twitter in your fucking life.
Getting trashed.
24,

752
00:44:43.441 --> 00:44:46.950
seven live action,
Facebook or whatever.
Alright.
Embarrassing.

753
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:53.160
Um,
Bill,
I can't spell for shit.
Um,

754
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:57.090
so let,
so let it go before you start hitching.

755
00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:02.100
I,
you know what,
go fuck yourself.
I got to sit here and I got to undo all of this

756
00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:09.960
embarrassing.
He spells that wrong.
Embara embar sing.

757
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:14.850
He spelled e embarrassing.
He spelt n.
E m.
P.
A.
R.
S.
S.
I.
N.
G.
See people.

758
00:45:14.851 --> 00:45:17.520
I'm not the only one dumb.
I'm just going to read this.
How he wrote it.

759
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:22.740
I can't spell for Shit,
so let,
so let it go before you start hitching.

760
00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:26.520
Funny story,
wanted to share it with capital.
Why a,

761
00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:31.500
I promise this as true.
An older man I know had gotten a vasectomy.

762
00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.700
He spelt it right with the,
with this new age laser,
laser treatment.
They do.

763
00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:38.010
It's an in and out kind of treatment.
Now,

764
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:42.990
was asked to come back a week or two later to make sure everything held up the

765
00:45:42.991 --> 00:45:45.270
way it was supposed to.
When he got there,

766
00:45:45.271 --> 00:45:49.200
he told the lady behind the desk why,

767
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:54.120
why he was there and she handed him a cup and told them they needed a sample in

768
00:45:54.121 --> 00:45:56.100
pointing to the bathroom.
Oh No.

769
00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.150
Did she mean Tj's or Wiz waiting room,

770
00:46:00.151 --> 00:46:02.250
which was filled with people.
FYI.

771
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:07.110
He went in and 15 minutes later came out with a cup of mango and proceeded to

772
00:46:07.111 --> 00:46:10.050
walk past the people in place,
the Cup on her desk.

773
00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:15.000
She slowly looked up at him and told him in front of everyone that she only

774
00:46:15.001 --> 00:46:19.240
needed a urine test.
God,

775
00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.550
Oh my God.
I really hope that's true.

776
00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.870
How do you fucking,
well,
she only gave him a cup.

777
00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:31.900
The fuck is he supposed to do?
They hand you a cup.

778
00:46:31.901 --> 00:46:34.900
That means that means to rub one out.
Right.
They hand you,

779
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:38.530
they give you that plastic bottle.
That means just supposed to paint it.

780
00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.130
Oh,
they do that shit all the time.

781
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.780
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

782
00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:46.130
<v 1>At doctor's offices.</v>

783
00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:50.870
Like they just forget cause they're there and it doesn't mean shit and they will

784
00:46:50.871 --> 00:46:54.780
just yell out,
you know,
anything.

785
00:46:56.190 --> 00:47:00.540
You just come walking in,
hey doctor so and so.
Hey are you it did it clear up?

786
00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:06.210
They still get the one Claire up and they immediately think he's got something

787
00:47:06.211 --> 00:47:10.980
on his balls.
Man.
Is it a contagious?
Um,

788
00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.200
that's fucking hilarious.

789
00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:15.580
<v 0>Okay.</v>

790
00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:17.250
<v 1>God Damn it.
This fucking embarrassing.</v>

791
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:22.410
I wonder what kind of a bathroom it was.

792
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:25.180
Did it have multiple toilets and people coming in?

793
00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.800
They're pissing and he's over there.
He hit,

794
00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:32.290
they'd make a noise cause the doctor because he feels the doctor said to do it

795
00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.840
that it's like somehow,
okay,
oh by the way,

796
00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:38.560
this is sort of a hacky shit joke and I don't want to do it on stage,

797
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:43.180
but I'm sick of people complaining about people blowing out the bathroom.

798
00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:44.830
<v 0>Okay.</v>

799
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:47.940
<v 1>Oh my God,
this guy came and he fucking blew out the bathtub.
Oh,</v>

800
00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:51.940
maybe next time you should take a shit in the kitchen.
You know?
That's what,

801
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:55.210
that's what it's for.
It's a fee.

802
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:58.330
It's designed so you can sit down and take a shit.

803
00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:01.410
You want them to go outside in the yard.

804
00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:08.420
It's like being mad bacon smells like Bacon.
Jesus,

805
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:11.210
what the fuck did you eat?
I Dunno.
Something healthy.

806
00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:15.470
And then it stayed with me for a couple of fucking days and went to nine miles

807
00:48:15.471 --> 00:48:19.370
of intestinal,
you know,
clinging on other shit.
Then what do,

808
00:48:19.371 --> 00:48:20.480
what is your shit smell like?

809
00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:22.990
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

810
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:26.680
<v 1>I've never understood that.
Like when I go into a bathroom and in,</v>

811
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:29.230
somebody blew it out.
I fucking makes me laugh.

812
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.570
Just a face you're making try not to smell it.
It's fucking hilarious.

813
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.020
Well that,
and when people get mad that babies cry on planes.

814
00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:41.340
When babies start crying on planes,

815
00:48:41.341 --> 00:48:45.030
I just start laughing because I just feel like they're expressing everything

816
00:48:45.031 --> 00:48:48.990
that I'm feeling,
but I'm not socially allowed.
I would love to just start crying.

817
00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:51.210
I don't want to be on a fucking plane.

818
00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:55.260
The second I say expedite the boarding practice,

819
00:48:55.261 --> 00:48:59.890
I just want to start fucking crying
anyways.

820
00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:04.840
X Won't move out.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
He is a fucking situation.
Hey Bill,

821
00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:08.140
huge fan of yours.
Loved that.
Loved the Monday morning podcast.

822
00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:11.200
I will keep this short as I know you don't like to read.

823
00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:14.440
I like to read.
I'm just not good at it.

824
00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.710
I'm like someone who likes to play drums but stinks at it.
Um,

825
00:49:17.711 --> 00:49:20.950
I recently bought a house and asked my girlfriend of three years to move in with

826
00:49:20.951 --> 00:49:25.540
me.
We have been living together for about six months and then we broke up.

827
00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.210
She was the worst.
All of my friends and families,

828
00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:32.770
they're not like her and she wouldn't let me hang out with friends.
No,
no,
no,
no.

829
00:49:32.771 --> 00:49:36.730
Let's,
let's put that in proper perspective.

830
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:39.130
It's not that she wouldn't let you hang out with friends.

831
00:49:39.131 --> 00:49:43.180
She asked you not to and you agreed to it.
All right.
You have,
you have the power,

832
00:49:43.181 --> 00:49:44.440
sir.
Anyways,

833
00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:49.890
she wouldn't let me hang out with my friends or watch any games with French ever

834
00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:53.530
capitol all call and caps.
I tried to get her to hang out with,

835
00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.380
with her friends,
but she was so insecure.

836
00:49:56.381 --> 00:50:00.210
She never trusted me even after three years of loyalty.
Anyways,

837
00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:04.270
we broke up about three weeks ago.
No one cheated,
lied,
or stole from one another.

838
00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.670
It was just time to move on.
However,

839
00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:11.680
she keeps saying she's going to move out but doesn't.
Um,

840
00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.200
I don't want to throw her out on the street,
but what do I do?
But,

841
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:19.180
but I do want her out as,
it's just not healthy for me to keep living with her.

842
00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:22.270
Also,
she refuses to pay any bills or help with the mortgage.

843
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:27.620
What's a fair amount of time to give her before I just go legal honor?

844
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:29.383
<v 4>Well,</v>

845
00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.220
<v 1>hindsight's 2020.</v>

846
00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:35.970
You should have told her from day one when she had to be out by.

847
00:50:37.350 --> 00:50:38.340
<v 4>MMM.</v>

848
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:41.790
<v 1>The fact that she's not paying any bills or anything like that.</v>

849
00:50:41.791 --> 00:50:46.791
I mean it's just like I would just hit her with the little two pronged attack

850
00:50:46.891 --> 00:50:50.570
here.
I would just go,
listen.
Uh,
we broke up three.

851
00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:55.400
Uh,
how would you dip into this fucking hell.
Gives a fuck.

852
00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:57.030
Just I was going to save you like,
Hey,
you know,

853
00:50:57.031 --> 00:51:00.440
how's the house a apartment hunting coming.
I would just go right at it.

854
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:01.430
I would just say,
listen,

855
00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.490
it's been three weeks and I really don't think it's healthy for us to be around

856
00:51:04.491 --> 00:51:06.470
each other.
Um,

857
00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:11.560
when do you think you're going to be Outta here by and let her answer em and

858
00:51:11.561 --> 00:51:13.180
Hawk and then just say,
listen,
I will,

859
00:51:13.181 --> 00:51:17.500
I need you to be out by this date because I have to get somebody else in here to

860
00:51:17.501 --> 00:51:19.030
help me with the mortgage.
All right.

861
00:51:19.031 --> 00:51:21.490
You're not paying any bills or helping with the mortgage.

862
00:51:21.491 --> 00:51:22.720
So this isn't fair to me.

863
00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:27.130
So you need to be out of here and her name is and on the mortgage.

864
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:31.270
So worst case scenario,
one day she goes to work,

865
00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.260
you call in sick,

866
00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:37.690
pack up all his shit and fucking put it out on the front line.

867
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:40.960
You're out.
And what she kind of say,
what's she going to do?

868
00:51:40.961 --> 00:51:44.740
Call the fucking cops.
You don't have to go legal on our,
get the fuck outta here.

869
00:51:44.741 --> 00:51:46.500
This is my house.
We broke up.
Get out,

870
00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:52.390
out you out.
Get Out.

871
00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:54.683
<v 0>Okay.</v>

872
00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:57.960
<v 1>Um,
I don't actually,
I don't know if she has any.</v>

873
00:51:58.850 --> 00:51:59.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

874
00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:02.730
<v 1>Anything legal?
I have no idea.
I don't fucking know,
but that's what I would do.</v>

875
00:52:02.731 --> 00:52:05.190
I would give her a definitive date.
You need to be out by this time.

876
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:11.820
And uh,
I dunno
what else?
I don't know what else I'd do.
My,

877
00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:15.270
my,
uh,
there's,
it's still,
we get it.

878
00:52:15.271 --> 00:52:17.720
We're on the Mississippi with the fucking horn.
I get it.

879
00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:19.813
<v 4>MMM.</v>

880
00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:24.830
<v 1>Just make up some shit too.
I need you out by the 15th of next month.
Uh,</v>

881
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:29.870
you know my uncle,
the,
my second uncle lives in Tennessee.
He's got tuberculosis.

882
00:52:29.871 --> 00:52:33.320
He's moving in and a,
he's bringing that machine with themselves.

883
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:38.360
You gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
All right.

It was kind of a short one.
Oh Jesus.
52 minutes.

885
00:52:42.081 --> 00:52:42.950
I can't do that to you.

886
00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:44.570
<v 0>Okay.</v>

887
00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:47.360
<v 1>Well I could technically I could if I want it to,</v>

888
00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:49.680
if I wanted to be a dick about it.
Um,

889
00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:51.770
<v 0>okay.</v>

891

00:54:09.931 --> 00:54:12.900
we added a second show at the beacon theater in,

919
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.560
I think all of those are on sale.

920
00:54:34.561 --> 00:54:38.550
So I got a bunch of shows out there that are all on sale.
Oh,
people of Scotland.

921
00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:40.770
It would be great if you showed up by the way,

922
00:54:40.771 --> 00:54:42.780
because we had to really fight with them to find,

923
00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.660
find some sort of venue because they didn't think anybody was going to show up

924
00:54:45.661 --> 00:54:46.381
when I was out there.

925
00:54:46.381 --> 00:54:50.250
So I'm at some venue that has a lower area and an upper area.

926
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.510
Um,
so I dunno.

927
00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:57.330
Let's see if we can get a couple of people up in the upper deck too,
if you can.

928
00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:01.860
All right.
Just call every cut,
you know,
and come on down.
All right.

929
00:55:01.861 --> 00:55:05.370
I have at least a new hour and a half since the last time I was fucking there

930
00:55:05.371 --> 00:55:07.200
and it'd be great if you came down.
Saw it.
All right.

931
00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:10.920
That's the podcast for this week.
Don't take any shit.
Go fuck yourselves.

932
00:55:10.921 --> 00:55:12.180
And I'll talk to you next Monday.
