00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.070
Hey,

And I am checking in on you.

3
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.780

I usually,
you know how I do,
I usually uh,

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.000
talk here to myself.
I usually babble.

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.060
I usually ramble and then I try to read out loud but every once in a while I

6
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:28.550
have a special guest and a,
this is one of these Thursdays.
Um,

7
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.240
this man is here to promote his new book.
Everybody is awful except for you.

8
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.890
That will be uh,

9
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.610
you can preorder now and it's going to be available on Amazon,

10
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:43.380
Barnes and nobles and all that stuff.
Please welcome Jim Florentine.
Everybody.

11
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.930
It's good to see you bill and thanks for having me back man.

12
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.050
He liked how I did the big buildup.
I said the book,
I did the whole thing.

13
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.860
I was waiting for everybody to sit back and try and guess who the hell it was

14
00:00:52.861 --> 00:00:55.650
going to be,
you know,
and then,
then I,
then I dropped the name on it.

15
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.440
That's old school shop is right there.
That is cause then like who could it be?

16
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.760
Maybe it's,
you know,
someone hasn't talked a while.

17
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.690
Maybe he's getting a Louis C K exclusive,
maybe Louise coming back.
Yeah.

18
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.230
Maybe he's coming back and he's going to do what?

19
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:10.460
I'm bill's podcasts and you know,
we were just talking about that.

20
00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:12.600
He might as well dive in.
That whole me too thing.

21
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.300
It's just like obviously it had to happen and everything,

22
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:19.120
but it is such like a bullying environment.
Even like the bullshit one,

23
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.820
if it's a bullshit one,
you can't say anything.
Like recently one came out,

24
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:24.690
it was just like,
all right,

25
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:28.560
this just seemed like this woman wanted a famous boyfriend and it didn't happen

26
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:32.820
and then the end she went on her friend's blog or some shit and trash this guy,

27
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.870
and I can't even name names before all these fucking lunatic start coming at

28
00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:41.130
like,
there's no,
there's no like,
hey,
hey,
hey,
let's,
let's,

29
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.330
let's examine this.

30
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.140
It's just all this person said that that means that's how it happened.

31
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.180
That's how the whole thing went down.

32
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:52.170
And let's burn down this person's life and their entire bill ability to earn a

33
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:56.880
living is a little nuts.
Absolutely.
And be me being a single guy out there.

34
00:01:56.881 --> 00:02:01.260
Absolutely.
You don't know.
You do like sign in triplicate before you'd be like,

35
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.580
I'm trying,
I'm trying to get like,
you know,
shacks contract.

36
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.360
He used to sign or Michael Jordan or whatever.

37
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:09.080
It's supposedly I had a thing where they would sign like they're Osisko Cisco.

38
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.910
Okay,
you go into the hotel room next door,
you know what's going to happen?

39
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.220
Sign here.
Yes,
this,
this is so here's a consent.
You're good.

40
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:18.620
Center water and then you know what you're going in there and you guys are going

41
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:20.430
to have sex and that's it.
What about funding?

42
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:23.430
One of the funniest things that I've read as far as like just all this extreme

43
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:27.930
mindset that's out there about politics that's out there,
about,

44
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:29.730
about this me to set everything is just,

45
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:32.820
you have to be like all the way on the left side of the room against the wall or

46
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:37.020
all the way on.
The other one is um,
oh God dude,
I'm getting so old.

47
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:38.820
I literally forgot my point right in the middle of it.

48
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.530
I swear to God I was going to make the greatest point.
I literally just fucking,

49
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.300
what the fuck was it?
Oh,
I know.
This is going to be a lot of this by the way.

50
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.550
Uh,
uh,

51
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.870
coercion is not consent is what they said.

52
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.750
When you coerced into doing something that is not consent.

53
00:02:57.751 --> 00:03:00.120
So that I was thinking like,
okay,
that mean I don't have to pay

54
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.810
<v 1>my bank loan this fucking month on my,
on my,</v>

55
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.680
my car loan and a body.
You don't want this man.
You want the turbo man.

56
00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:09.810
You come around the corner,
they hear and that engine,

57
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.180
the whole fucking world is coercion.
Everybody,
our whole business,

58
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.170
everything you,
anytime you sell anything,
any of it.

59
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.410
Half the Shit my wife does to me,
dude.

60
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.270
If coercion is not consent in women actually stuck by that,

61
00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:31.410
would brunch still exist?
And that's a good point.
No Guy,

62
00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:34.320
if you actually could see you want to go to that?
No,
I do not.

63
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.640
And then she can be like,
well I'm all mine.
That's coercion.
Like,

64
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.580
cause you immediately,
you're like,
yeah,

65
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.050
<v 0>oh fuck.
I don't want her to cry.
Anytime a guy goes to bronch,</v>

66
00:03:43.051 --> 00:03:46.750
he's taken the bullet on something.
Oh my words.
The worst is when they come up,

67
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.380
they said it's going to be like 40 minutes.
Is that going to be,

68
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.950
can you still stand like you have the option to say no.
I mean,
I say no.

69
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.000
That's why I fight with my wife so much.
No,
let's get outta here.
Yeah,
we can.

70
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.000
I can.
I can literally Google how to make fucking,
no pun intended.

71
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:04.330
Eggs Florentine.
Go to the supermind.
It's eggs and steam.

72
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:08.180
Fucking spinach on an English muffin.
I can figure this out.
No,

73
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.130
but I just as a fun audience here,
so look,

74
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:16.240
obviously it's great that there's a form now that all,
all these,
these,
these,

75
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.800
these are some of the shit this guy's did.

76
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:20.260
Like who the fuck knew people did that?
I mean,

77
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:23.050
I knew that it was fucking creeps out there,
but like now it's just getting,

78
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:25.360
it's getting to the point,
but with not,
it's not getting to the point,

79
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:29.230
but there's been a few where there's a few things where it's like you couldn't

80
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:30.520
handle that amongst yourselves.

81
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:34.390
Like did I need to know all the gory details of what you guys did here?

82
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:36.480
And then there's other ones that are just complete bullshit,
but I,

83
00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:39.940
I still don't feel that we're at a place where you can actually say that because

84
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:42.460
I think if you do,
then then what?
Then you're a rapist.

85
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.610
<v 1>Yeah.
Then yeah,
absolutely.
You can donate it and you'll understand.
The women now,</v>

86
00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:51.180
they just said,
we just want the guys to listen.
We don't want them to respond.

87
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.120
Don't come back like you're in a relationship and when your girls complain about

88
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:56.450
something on the wall,
I know how to fix it.

89
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.570
<v 0>Listen,
that makes sense.
If what they're saying is true.</v>

90
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.180
Yeah,
exactly know if you,
but if you're telling a fucking,
if you,
if you,

91
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:11.860
if you're talking about apples and you say in their oranges and then you're

92
00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:15.430
telling me I'm supposed to shut the fuck up and then watch somebody I know lose

93
00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:19.390
their fucking life,
their career,
that doesn't make sense either.

94
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:22.870
And I feel like a lot of people feel that and everyone's choosing like self

95
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:25.660
preservation,
like,
sorry,
I keep hitting the table here.
Like,
uh,

96
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.980
like the Golden Globes,
right when you went to that,
it's like,
dude,

97
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:34.050
if you didn't have a black shirt underneath you Tuxedo,
I mean you,
you,

98
00:05:34.051 --> 00:05:37.960
you were finished.
That meant you advocated sexual assault that night.

99
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.190
Then you had a word of pin.
Okay.
Time's up thing.
But here's the thing,

100
00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:45.790
you literally could have just sexually assaulted somebody but wore a black shirt

101
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:50.350
and had the pen and no one would fuck with you.
Right.
So I don't eat,
I don't,

102
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:53.680
I'm old.
I,
so I don't,
I don't get what's going on anymore.
I don't get it.

103
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.090
Sorry man.
You're here to sell a book.
No,
no,
no.
I'm only getting

104
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.140
<v 1>to know,
I do want to get into it.
No,
absolutely.</v>

105
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:03.560
I mean there's the story that we're talking about is just insane.
You know,

106
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:07.990
it was it,
there was oral sex performed bolt time two times on each,

107
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.740
on each other.
And then when he wanted to have intercourse,
she,
she's like,
Nah,

108
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:16.100
I don't know.
And he's like,
all right,
we'll hang or whatever like that.

109
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:20.690
And then he had a funny line.
No,
I thought it was a funny joke.
So he goes,

110
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.750
come on,
let's just have intercourse cause everybody would do.
And she goes,

111
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:26.360
you know what,
I,
I'd rather wait for the second day for that.

112
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:29.840
And he was at his place and he goes,
so if I pour you a new glass of wine,

113
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:32.320
is that considered a second day?
That's a fucking funny line.

114
00:06:32.321 --> 00:06:36.200
And a guys throwing it out there,
it's a desperate Lonnie,
it is funny.

115
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.190
And then she goes,
no,
and then,

116
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.080
and then they hung out for a little longer and she goes,

117
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:41.480
I'm just going to go home.
She wasn't upset.
He goes,
okay,

118
00:06:41.481 --> 00:06:44.570
I'll get you a car service center in a car.
Text her the next day.

119
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:48.320
He had a good time.
He last night.
Well I did.
And,
and then that's how it started.

120
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.820
Some of these,
these,
these uh,
what do you call him?
The cougars after a show.

121
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.010
Like if you will,
if you go out and you're selling anything,
dude,

122
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.060
you got to get manhandled when you're out there warming.

123
00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.750
Handled fucking once a weekend.

124
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.420
It happens to me cause I sell merchandise after a show.
Once a weekend.
Yeah.
Yeah.

125
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.400
Grab my ass.
Literally something.
If you did it like over po Po,

126
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.460
put your hand on my wife's tit.
No,
it's okay.
Or a girl goes,
hey,

127
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:13.820
put it on my tits.
Come on.
It'll be funny.
Or every time.
All the time.

128
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.900
You got to come out after a show.
Now you don't go.
Those guys wear that suit.

129
00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:22.310
What?
You fucking dismantle a bomb.
You've got to come a gap thing all made a lit.

130
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.950
Well tell me,
tell me what is the book about?
Cause I already like,

131
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:27.590
I love the title.
It's everybody.
Everybody is awful.

132
00:07:27.591 --> 00:07:32.591
And then parentheses except you to like how I heard that was everybody,

133
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:33.111
you know,

134
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:36.890
on Facebook going on and on about how great they are and like how the world's so

135
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:41.300
awful and you know,
I don't know,
just having the whole Selfie,

136
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.300
the selfie generation.
Yeah.
That's basically what it is.

137
00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:46.610
It just calling people out bad Facebook posts,
you know,

138
00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:50.270
people brag and people looking for attention,
you know,
to,
you know,

139
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.080
to PR person that posts so and uh,

140
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.340
among my weight at a hospital and they just leave it at that.
I go,
okay,

141
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:57.290
so now you're going to get 50,
what's wrong?

142
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.750
Are you okay if I lived in New Jersey,
I'd beat air for you,
but I can cute.

143
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.100
Please keep us updated.
Is Everything okay?

144
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:07.820
And then at the end it was just a sore throat.
Oh yeah.
You know what I mean?

145
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.880
It's never,
you always figure out these,
these,

146
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.670
these things like this crank Yankers all the way to this.

147
00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:18.170
You always fun terrorizing telemarketers.
You always find like that,

148
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.140
that thing that people are like,
I don't know.
It's,

149
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:23.030
I always see whenever you do a project,

150
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.140
I was thinking it was right fucking there was hanging right there and you just,

151
00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:31.490
you up like this.
You've done the um,
the uh,
uh,

152
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:33.410
what was supposed to show on VH one.
I just went blind.

153
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.740
That metal show metal shell.
Yeah.
Yeah.

154
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.890
How did you know that there was going to be in awe?

155
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:41.930
Like there was a bunch of people like me who wanted to know what Bobby blots or

156
00:08:41.931 --> 00:08:45.380
was doing.
I would like,
I was so excited to see all those guys.

157
00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:49.970
Like there was such a huge part of my life and a,
you know,
a part of my life,

158
00:08:49.971 --> 00:08:53.000
you know,
is you were a teenager.
He's a drama for rat by the way.

159
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.430
And it has a Pete just being a teenager where

160
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.750
<v 0>there's sort of all of this exciting stuff and then all of this scary and</v>

161
00:08:59.751 --> 00:09:04.310
depressing shit all happening at the same time and that music was so great and

162
00:09:04.311 --> 00:09:07.610
so fun that like,
I mean all of those guys in those,

163
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.780
those bands to me are on the same level of like the fonts were like when I was a

164
00:09:11.781 --> 00:09:14.660
really little kid,
like the Fonz,
they had the trading cards and they're like,

165
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.240
literally you're looking at somebody like made my childhood happier.

166
00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.080
When I watched your show,
that metal show,
I was like,
oh my God,

167
00:09:21.081 --> 00:09:25.580
I fucking love that guy.
Like what?
What is,
uh,
is it just how your brain works?

168
00:09:25.581 --> 00:09:27.860
Like how do you always seem to,
to,
to find,

169
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.461
<v 1>I don't know.</v>

170
00:09:28.461 --> 00:09:32.030
I think we just got under the good time VH one classic was like looking for a

171
00:09:32.031 --> 00:09:34.700
one original program that didn't have anything on it.

172
00:09:34.701 --> 00:09:37.010
Just show him repeats of just old music videos.

173
00:09:37.011 --> 00:09:39.220
And we pitched like a heavy metal talk show.

174
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.320
I liked the tonight show for ACDC fans.
They said,
okay,
we'll give you money.

175
00:09:42.321 --> 00:09:45.600
For one pilot.
We pulled Lita Ford out her retirement.
She was,

176
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.990
didn't do anything for like 20 years.
She was living in an island,

177
00:09:47.991 --> 00:09:51.750
raising her kids.
So we had her as a pilot episode where like,
all right,

178
00:09:51.751 --> 00:09:55.200
it doesn't know why she's back on the road.
She never sees her kids.
Yeah,
yeah,

179
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.570
yeah.
Great moms.
She was being a great mom until we gave her exposure.
It's like,

180
00:09:59.571 --> 00:10:00.710
oh damn,
I got a career.

181
00:10:00.711 --> 00:10:03.590
And next thing he knows he's put three albums out in the last nine years.
Oh,

182
00:10:03.591 --> 00:10:07.730
that's awesome.
And then,
uh,
you know,
and luckily the head of like VH one classic,

183
00:10:07.731 --> 00:10:11.480
this guy used to be a d,
like a metal DJ up in Buffalo.
He goes,
I love this show.

184
00:10:11.481 --> 00:10:14.780
Put It on the air.
You know,
it's going to be a shitty bar budget.

185
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.280
And I remember my manager goes,

186
00:10:16.281 --> 00:10:19.040
this is the worst contract I've ever seen in my life.

187
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.500
You sure you want to sign us?
Like go,
yeah,
like whatever.
Who Cares?

188
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:26.030
At least we'll be on the air.
And we did 140 episodes,
w seven seasons.

189
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.100
Who is some of your favorites?

190
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.310
Cause I knew that you were kind of already in that world a little bit like a lot

191
00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:34.130
of you guys like you Norton and all those guys,
big Jay,

192
00:10:34.131 --> 00:10:36.650
you guys seem to like know brewer.
Brewer.
Yeah.

193
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.260
Guys seem to build the know like rock stars and stuff like that.

194
00:10:39.261 --> 00:10:41.930
You were kind of already in that world,
but when you went there,

195
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:46.190
what was like your bucket list of guests and were you able to get most of them?

196
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.540
Yeah,
I mean Tony Iommi,
you know,
we got bottler,

197
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.590
Ronnie James Dio before he passed away was on twice.
Then we get Marilyn Manson,

198
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.890
you know,
we got Tom Morello from rage against the machine and I'm a huge fan.

199
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.740
We had Steve Harris from iron maiden,
so every,

200
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.070
every season with somebody different,
like you gotta be kidding.
Sammy Hagar,

201
00:11:04.071 --> 00:11:05.120
Michael Anthony.

202
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.170
You know what I loved about Steve Harris was even people who had none,

203
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:12.840
<v 0>knew nothing about music will be like,
that guy's an unbelievable bass player.</v>

204
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.810
Yeah,
he was,
yeah,
his fingers just flying.
Um,

205
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.700
actually iron maiden was the one that when I first wanted to play drums,

206
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.670
it was their drum.
Nicko mcbrain that was one of those,
uh,

207
00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.720
one of those screen from a long beach,
you know,
that they filmed or whatever.

208
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.140
<v 1>And uh,</v>

209
00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.290
I just remember when they finally went behind them because you should always see

210
00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:34.780
the arms moving.
Yeah.
You can never see me.
He's buried in the sand.

211
00:11:34.781 --> 00:11:36.040
When I saw the legs moving,

212
00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.730
<v 0>I was like,
that looks fucking cool.</v>

213
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.200
And I already failed on guitar because he actually had to like no notes and shit

214
00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:45.620
like that.
And just coming from more of a sports background as that guy,

215
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:46.730
he just kind of beat the shit

216
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:51.660
<v 1>I know.
After,
after that looks like fun after a,
you know,
a big patriot loss,</v>

217
00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:55.290
you can no problem pounding the,
Oh,
speaking of which hat,
what are you,

218
00:11:55.291 --> 00:11:58.410
I know you're a,
an,
there's a famous story about you.

219
00:11:58.411 --> 00:12:00.030
You're a huge Miami Dolphin Fan.

220
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:05.450
There's this story that Keith Robinson is told me probably a dozen times and I

221
00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:09.180
never stopped them because I love it was you were on a,

222
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:13.650
you're on some flight watching a dolphin game and that you will,
you will going,

223
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.970
please tell me it's true,
right.

224
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.930
The will landing and the stewardess told you to shut your phone off or whatever

225
00:12:18.931 --> 00:12:22.970
you were watching you you've refused to because it was an important part.

226
00:12:22.971 --> 00:12:24.480
It's like this is before cell phones.

227
00:12:24.481 --> 00:12:26.890
I have one of those little TVs with the antenna,
you know,

228
00:12:26.891 --> 00:12:28.660
it's a little box and it was a play.

229
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.890
It was a dolphins and Bobby Kelly can find the next thing.

230
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.990
He always had that shit.
This was like an,
I don't know,

231
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
probably 99 it was [inaudible] 98 when Montana was on the chiefs Dolphin chief

232
00:12:39.871 --> 00:12:43.590
playoff game and I was talking to on a fly from Florida and it was on like the

233
00:12:43.591 --> 00:12:45.850
local ABC cause there's a playoff game,
right.

234
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.200
So I had one of those little old school TVs when an antenna and I watched it

235
00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:51.070
under a blanket the whole game.

236
00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:53.670
Cause I didn't have to switch like a moment where in South Carolina I got to

237
00:12:53.671 --> 00:12:55.320
find the ABC affiliate there.

238
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:59.790
And then when I'm on and I'm switching around like this and I'm,
and Baltimore,

239
00:12:59.791 --> 00:13:01.260
I got to find the other church,
I feel.

240
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.050
So I watched a whole game and the woman came over like 20 minutes left.

241
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.330
You have a TV on,
shut that off.
It's gonna affect the plane.
I got too bad.
I go,

242
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.180
it's,
it's,
I go,
it's 2121 and Merinos drive and with two minutes left,
she goes,

243
00:13:12.181 --> 00:13:14.190
you've got a shot.
Like go,
I'm not shutting it off.
I don't care.

244
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.420
And even when the plane landed,

245
00:13:15.421 --> 00:13:18.300
I still watching the whole thing and they won like right as the plane landed.

246
00:13:18.301 --> 00:13:19.134
I'm like,
yes.

247
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:23.940
Oh that's why it was pre nine 11 it was pre nine 11 and I had that little,
yeah.

248
00:13:23.941 --> 00:13:26.910
And you couldn't have any,
any kind of electronic device on the plane,
you know.

249
00:13:26.911 --> 00:13:30.630
But I'm saying if now if you said no,
Oh yeah,
that would have been like,
you know,

250
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:35.660
like the CIA absolutely would come on and fucking were waiting for me when I

251
00:13:35.851 --> 00:13:38.700
liked it.
But yeah,
I would not shut the TV off on the note.

252
00:13:38.701 --> 00:13:39.511
I will add it on the black.

253
00:13:39.511 --> 00:13:41.610
I didn't get caught to like 20 minutes left in the flight.

254
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.550
I watched the whole game.
My girlfriend at the time,
we sit next to me.

255
00:13:44.551 --> 00:13:46.260
I was screaming.
She was miserable.

256
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:50.460
She was the way to end a bad trip on my head to bad breaking over again.
Anyway,

257
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.000
when I get back,
oh,
I didn't know.

258
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.220
I thought you wanted like a jet blue because I was thinking,

259
00:13:56.221 --> 00:13:57.870
well why wouldn't they just shut the thing on God,

260
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.400
your rowing team and my own little TV.
I brought it just in case they go to,

261
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.630
I was already doing the math.
I'm like,
if they win,

262
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.630
they're going to play on Saturday at four 30 my,
that's when my flight is,

263
00:14:06.631 --> 00:14:09.690
so I'm bringing my TV just the case and that's exactly what happened.

264
00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.420
<v 0>Wow.
Do you know when the,
when the Patriots beat Seattle?</v>

265
00:14:12.421 --> 00:14:15.240
I was flying from Sydney,
Australia to like Auckland,

266
00:14:15.241 --> 00:14:18.900
New Zealand and I missed the whole game cause I was thinking that it's the

267
00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:22.350
Superbowl they showed around the world,
they're going to have it on,
like,

268
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.560
you know,
they had TVs,
all they had was soccer.
I was like,

269
00:14:25.561 --> 00:14:27.660
you gotta be kidding me.
So when I got off the plane,

270
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.580
I knew it was towards the end of the game,
but I just had to know.
So I told,

271
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:37.270
I asked my wife,
I go,
uh,
I go,
what's the score?
And she's like,
Oh,

272
00:14:37.271 --> 00:14:42.030
I'm says the Patriots are winning.
And I was like,
really?
You know,

273
00:14:42.031 --> 00:14:45.270
cause I was still,
you know,
after those two giant losses,
I was like,
Oh God,

274
00:14:45.271 --> 00:14:50.250
now he's going to be three and three,
you know,
and um,
I go,
how much time's left?

275
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:55.270
And she's like,
um,
it's says it's over.
I go,

276
00:14:55.271 --> 00:14:57.490
no way.
Don't wait.
And then it looked,
I was like,
fuck.

277
00:14:57.491 --> 00:15:00.220
It started screaming in the middle of New Zealand,
look like a maniac.

278
00:15:00.221 --> 00:15:01.570
And then it went back to the hotel.

279
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:06.910
And they would just showing the Superbowl in this weird channel with no

280
00:15:06.911 --> 00:15:10.360
commercials.
And I watched it twice back to back.

281
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:13.480
And then I watched it again the next morning and I couldn't,
like,

282
00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.750
I had no idea about that whole play in the end or anything like that.
But,
uh,
um,

283
00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.230
anyways,
getting back to the initial thing I was going to ask you,
um,

284
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:25.270
a lot of people,
you know,
are talking about the Jaguars and the defense,

285
00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.940
you know,
and uh,
they going into New England,
you know,

286
00:15:27.941 --> 00:15:30.940
nobody thought that they were going to go into Pittsburgh.
Well,
some people did,

287
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:34.540
but they went in there,
they won there,
they beat buffalo bills,

288
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.710
but they beat the bills and it was like this snooze fest.
And then,
you know,

289
00:15:38.711 --> 00:15:41.890
they went into,
uh,
the Steelers and they had like a shootout.

290
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.800
So everybody's talking about how great their defenses,
and I'm still like,

291
00:15:44.801 --> 00:15:48.590
they just gave up like 40,
41 points,
but the week before,
who the fuck are they?

292
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:53.530
So Jim Florentine,
Amanda brought a TV on a fucking plane in 1999.

293
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:57.000
What is your gut feeling?
Uh,
patriots or a

294
00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:01.510
<v 1>patriots.
Absolutely.
You,
you don't win in Foxborough and you know,</v>

295
00:16:01.511 --> 00:16:04.870
and Patriots Gillette Stadium,
you don't win.
They're a championship game.

296
00:16:04.871 --> 00:16:08.530
You think Bella checks the seals were looking past the Jaguars waiting for the

297
00:16:08.531 --> 00:16:13.270
championship game.
We're fucking dude's always do it.
We came out,

298
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.810
we played them.
They had already,
they had already bought their fucking plane.

299
00:16:16.811 --> 00:16:18.400
Like that's the,
you know the urban myth.

300
00:16:18.401 --> 00:16:22.120
They've had already bought the plane tickets and hotel reservations down in New

301
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.790
Orleans.
Um,
that,
yeah.

302
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.320
Well you got bet Bella check to prepare for Blake Bortles.
They've got no shot.

303
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:31.000
Yeah,

304
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.460
I don't care what kind of defense they're running back there running back got

305
00:16:33.461 --> 00:16:36.670
hurt too.
Yeah,
with that defense looks good but to do,
but that's all right.

306
00:16:36.671 --> 00:16:37.690
Birdie will pick them apart.

307
00:16:37.691 --> 00:16:40.720
So find somebody last week they did not like some guy will come off the practice

308
00:16:40.721 --> 00:16:44.340
squad tomorrow and Oh,
catch 10 passes on Sunday.
Here's the thing,

309
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.060
how long can we do this?
We just keep doing it and do,

310
00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:49.920
he doesn't have a number one.
This isn't it.
We don't even know

311
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.440
<v 0>number one receiver right now.</v>

312
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:56.720
I'm with Edelman being out the whole year and uh,
you know,

313
00:16:56.721 --> 00:16:59.420
I know we got Gronk he's a tight end but like are,
are,
you know

314
00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:05.010
<v 1>there's a lot of passes.
They,
I dunno.
No it's that one guy he fucking stops.</v>

315
00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.150
It's like keep running,

316
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.910
keep letting it and lot of times I see Brady go and like just keep fucking

317
00:17:08.911 --> 00:17:11.280
running.
So I dunno like this,
this game scares me.

318
00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:15.000
This game scares me cause they can do the whole fat diet jacked up till then I

319
00:17:15.001 --> 00:17:17.650
suppose to pay here.
I got nothing to lose.
But Baba Baba Baba,

320
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.000
I'm getting all nervous about that now.
I think that they had their run,

321
00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:21.620
I mean they pay,

322
00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.840
if the bills had any kind of quarterback they should have won that game.

323
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.590
The first playoff game and Pittsburgh was waiting for New England.

324
00:17:28.591 --> 00:17:30.750
They overlooked it.
There weren't prepared.
You sorta first quarter,

325
00:17:30.751 --> 00:17:34.830
they weren't even,
but you know the head was in a different game.
Patriots.

326
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:38.310
The only problem they could have is maybe if they play Minnesota in Minnesota

327
00:17:38.311 --> 00:17:40.770
because the game will be a home game.
I was nervous about it.

328
00:17:40.771 --> 00:17:44.280
It's like the saints.
Like I called that saints game.
I called and I was like,

329
00:17:44.281 --> 00:17:47.250
drew Brees is going to go in there.
He gets no respect.

330
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.920
He's like the third all time and all that shit.

331
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.470
He's going to go in there and I kept saying that,
you know,

332
00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:53.520
all these Minnesota fans,

333
00:17:53.521 --> 00:17:56.730
we're going to go to the mall of America going to the giant clean next door and

334
00:17:56.731 --> 00:17:59.790
they were going to be crying and everything and exactly what the fuck I said was

335
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:03.660
going to happen until that last play with 14 seconds left,

336
00:18:03.661 --> 00:18:08.220
which I have never ever in the history of watching people fuck up.

337
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.580
I have never seen anybody do what that poor kid did.

338
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:16.890
It's like he put his head down and stop looking at the guy and then he throws,

339
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.390
he basically threw a block,
took out his own fucking guy.
It's just,

340
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:26.220
I've never,
I still cannot fucking believe that that happened.
We um,

341
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.860
I was watching a game,
a bunch of friends of ours at 17,

342
00:18:28.861 --> 00:18:31.950
nothing halftime and my brother gambles.
He's like,
all right,
look,

343
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.710
there's 10 to one odds you want to put on on the saints,

344
00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:37.310
come back and win this game.
So we put um,

345
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.930
like $2,000 in a pot,

346
00:18:39.931 --> 00:18:44.230
so I would have 1-800-BUCKS-IF they were to just made a typo right there and

347
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.140
spread was five,
right?
The scribe was five,

348
00:18:46.141 --> 00:18:48.990
but we had to just sort of sayings to win the game from the second half.

349
00:18:48.991 --> 00:18:51.120
They were down 70 nothing and a half time I go,
I'll do that.

350
00:18:51.121 --> 00:18:54.360
So they had to win the half of win the game when the whole game at 17.
Nothing.

351
00:18:54.361 --> 00:18:56.220
I'm like,
I'll put eight oh eight 80 bucks in,

352
00:18:56.221 --> 00:19:00.060
I would've won 800 bucks and I'm watching it.
We're all,
can you guys doing?

353
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.700
We're like,
yes.
That was just,
all right,
good.

354
00:19:02.701 --> 00:19:05.880
We've got this or you owe this and right now I'm only down this and this and

355
00:19:05.881 --> 00:19:07.200
then we're watching the last play.
Like

356
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.260
I was picturing all you guys walking and talking to the narrow with buying your

357
00:19:13.261 --> 00:19:16.350
wives furs and stuff.
When I say what I say,
don't buy anything.

358
00:19:16.351 --> 00:19:17.184
Don't take it back.

359
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:19.891
<v 0>Oh my God,</v>

360
00:19:19.891 --> 00:19:24.090
that's fucking do I wish you guys had the reaction video or that you guys just

361
00:19:24.091 --> 00:19:25.050
talking about all this shit?

362
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.420
<v 1>I was already crossing off my battery on my God.
Cool.</v>

363
00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:28.800
I'm only down 30 for the day.

364
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.430
This you took this and we're just already figuring out like,
we got this.

365
00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.760
<v 0>That's one of those games.</v>

366
00:19:33.761 --> 00:19:37.480
I immediately went to youtube to see people's reactions to it and these fucking

367
00:19:37.481 --> 00:19:42.010
nerds were like the first people that put theirs up and it was the worst

368
00:19:42.011 --> 00:19:46.840
reaction ever.
They're like,
oh my God.
Wow.

369
00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.260
That's crazy.

370
00:19:48.261 --> 00:19:51.280
And they already monetized it and everything else I fucking mad at him.

371
00:19:51.281 --> 00:19:56.281
I want him to see st spans crying and Viking fans crying because I figured like

372
00:19:57.911 --> 00:20:02.760
the best reaction video I ever saw was when,
when Auburn,
my favorite one,

373
00:20:02.761 --> 00:20:04.000
I went to Auburn caught that,

374
00:20:04.001 --> 00:20:08.410
that field goal that came up short against Alabama and the dude ran the whole

375
00:20:08.411 --> 00:20:11.140
thing back like Alabama was kicking to,
uh,

376
00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.850
to win the game and it was a long field goal.
And if they missed,

377
00:20:15.851 --> 00:20:17.170
who gives a shit?
We go into overtime.

378
00:20:17.171 --> 00:20:20.740
I believe that was the scenario and it came up short and you can return it in.

379
00:20:20.741 --> 00:20:22.550
The Auburn Guy fucking caught it and I,

380
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.570
they caught him sleeping and he ran it like a 105 yards back.

381
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:29.500
And my favorite one was these two girls.
One was for Auburn,
one was for Alabama,

382
00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:33.000
and the one screaming co,
the other ones like freaking out.
And then the end,

383
00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.550
the fucking Auburn girl looks to the Alabama girl who was just totally stunned.

384
00:20:36.551 --> 00:20:37.384
She's like,

385
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.430
<v 1>y'all just lost
fucking great.</v>

386
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.380
So,
um,
anyways,
I keep forgetting to talk about the book.
So,
um,

387
00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.150
you can preorder

388
00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:51.150
<v 0>this thing.
Wait,
where are they going?
Are they going to iTunes?
They go to I book.</v>

389
00:20:51.151 --> 00:20:54.840
What do you,
where do you go to Amazon?
Just,
it's all the links up on Amazon.
Oh,

390
00:20:54.841 --> 00:20:59.000
the link is up on Amazon.
It's Jim Florentine.
Everybody's awful except you are,

391
00:20:59.001 --> 00:21:00.390
comes out February 20.
It's just me.

392
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.670
It's basically based off my podcast where I just,
you know,

393
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.590
people send in like bad Facebook posts or like vanity plates,
you know,

394
00:21:07.591 --> 00:21:09.120
awful vanity.
This is some of this stuff.

395
00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.600
Bed of Hennessy pussy power wash,

396
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:17.860
awful Facebook rule number 10,
drown us and dumb ass details.
Oh,

397
00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:19.500
this is fucking great.
And I,

398
00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.550
these are actual Facebook posts by people are posted.
And then I just,
you know,

399
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.780
just take,
take him down,
you know.
Oh my God.

400
00:21:27.781 --> 00:21:32.350
The weather posts in Ohio,
you know,
Mother Nature,
you know,
go away.
Okay.

401
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.370
Do you know what's funny is earlier this year I went to this fucking award show,

402
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.450
uh,
in one of these ones that was not televised.

403
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.800
That's the level that I'm at in this business.
Right?
So I had a friend of mine,

404
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:46.620
he's got,
hey man,
this is going to be like this big fucking thing,
blah,
blah,
blah,

405
00:21:46.621 --> 00:21:49.260
blah,
blah.
You know,
so eventually maybe it'll be a big award show,
you know,

406
00:21:49.261 --> 00:21:53.200
if you want to go.
My wife loves music and he had a double date flub lesson.

407
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:57.060
All right,
let's go.
So right before,

408
00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:01.440
what kind of go the other couple has to cancer cause simple shifts and I would

409
00:22:01.441 --> 00:22:03.930
go into this fucking thing that I,
you know,
I'm like God,
Jesus Christ.

410
00:22:03.931 --> 00:22:05.880
So we show up dude.
I swear to God,

411
00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:10.910
every fucking person say say 20 people want awards that night 19 people cried

412
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:15.750
and talked about how hard it was and everything they went through and blah,

413
00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:18.480
blah blah,
blah,
blah.
And I was just sitting there.
I just wanted to yell out,

414
00:22:18.481 --> 00:22:22.380
you're in your 20s
how hard can you,

415
00:22:22.381 --> 00:22:23.790
10 years ago you were in high school,

416
00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:28.350
you're accepting a fucking award and you got to hit album.

417
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.290
How fucking hard could,
how could it have been?

418
00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:37.470
I was like almost 20 years.
It's still on a fucking Futon,
right?
Nothing.
I Dunno.

419
00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:42.570
I was paying,
my bills would change at 36 years old.
Oh Jesus.

420
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.820
Taking it down.
That a change thing at the supermarket,

421
00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:48.740
you know like they take like 8 cents off a dollar.
That was paying a 36 yeah.

422
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:53.180
He's a thing like who gives a fuck?
Like,
I don't know,
like I don't know.

423
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:57.710
The entertainment business is difficult.
Like is it easy for somebody else?

424
00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.090
Nobody goes into this business.
Even if you make it in two seconds,

425
00:23:02.091 --> 00:23:06.440
then all that means is you're going to get fucking slammed back down to the

426
00:23:06.441 --> 00:23:08.270
ground because when you start to dip,

427
00:23:08.271 --> 00:23:10.940
you're not going to know how to handle it and you're going to fucking freak out.

428
00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:15.440
It's better to get punched in the face repeatedly as you're walking up the hill,

429
00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.900
other than to just be on the chair lift,

430
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.560
go right up to the top and the first time you'll drop a ski or something like

431
00:23:21.561 --> 00:23:23.790
that,
all that,
you're just gonna go right down the other side of the mountain.

432
00:23:23.791 --> 00:23:26.780
So I actually,

433
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:30.830
it was one of the few times where I was semi ruining something.

434
00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:34.610
Did your wife know you were annoyed?
Yeah,
but she thought it was funny.
She did.

435
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.330
I didn't think it was funny because right from right in the beginning it was

436
00:23:38.331 --> 00:23:42.020
annoying.
I got there in this like I'm standing there,
you know the panic,

437
00:23:42.021 --> 00:23:42.640
you know when you,

438
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.380
you get like you're on like the guest list and you know they're going to your

439
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:46.070
name

440
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.020
<v 1>and the like,
I don't see it.
Then they found it.
I was like,</v>

441
00:23:48.021 --> 00:23:50.300
I had like this relief and all of a sudden the security guys just like,

442
00:23:50.301 --> 00:23:51.440
excuse me Sir sir,

443
00:23:51.441 --> 00:23:53.600
I'm going to need you to clear this and we need to clear it and I'm thinking

444
00:23:53.601 --> 00:23:58.130
like I'm in this totally open area.
This woman had to fucking walk by.

445
00:23:58.131 --> 00:24:01.310
It was just like some,
I dunno,
I dunno who the fuck it was,

446
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.330
but like she literally had 10 feet on either side of us and the guy was still

447
00:24:05.331 --> 00:24:07.790
telling me I had needed to get further up.
It gets like,

448
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:11.960
do you want me to become part of the paint?
I don't know.
So sorry.

449
00:24:11.961 --> 00:24:16.400
This is just podcast is becoming about me complaining.
No,
no,
no.
That's perfect.

450
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.980
That's what I should say.
I don't know.

451
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:21.590
Every once in a while I want to have a guest and I tried to want to like lighten

452
00:24:21.591 --> 00:24:25.460
it up or something.
How is the,
uh,
want to lighten it up?
Okay.
How's,

453
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.410
how's The New York comedy scene?
It's great.
It's been,
if you've been,
uh,

454
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:33.320
you know,
I moved away,
believe it or not,
like over 10 years ago.

455
00:24:33.321 --> 00:24:37.750
So when I go back now,
I don't know who a lot of the new people are all,

456
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.990
all of the,
uh,
there's a ton of them yeah.
As it should be.

457
00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:45.980
And a good,
you know,
the good,
the,
it's thriving men has all the clubs,

458
00:24:45.981 --> 00:24:46.641
they're packed.

459
00:24:46.641 --> 00:24:50.840
And I really liked to stand the stand is my club in the city and his great love

460
00:24:50.841 --> 00:24:54.950
that place.
And there's,
there's a danger fields I still love.

461
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:59.300
I haven't walked in there in 15 years.
And then the New York Comedy Club,

462
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.750
uh,
Al doesn't own it anymore,
so it's gotten better.

463
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:07.800
It's actually a decent gig.
And then they got the village on the ground.

464
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.360
It's like the comedy cellar and they got like three or three like they did when

465
00:25:11.361 --> 00:25:15.920
I was in New York.
The seller had the cellar,
they had,
uh,

466
00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:20.540
the y I don't think they had the village is at village underground.

467
00:25:20.541 --> 00:25:23.330
I don't think they had that.
No,
he had like,
yeah,
they're like,

468
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.080
like playing monopoly.
Like they keep it,

469
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.230
they got three rooms that you like 10 shows on a Saturday night.
It's incredible.

470
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.870
I remember I used to be so jealous of,
uh,
when I was living with Bobby Kelly.
Um,

471
00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.450
we both have nine shows,
but I would be all over the city and he would,

472
00:25:38.451 --> 00:25:40.160
he would have three at the Boston,

473
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.730
three at the Wa three at the cellar and he didn't have to take one cab.

474
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:47.930
He could just walk to all of them and he,
you know,
you got paid 50 bucks a seat.

475
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:52.370
So he,
he'd have nine fifties and I'd have a bunch of twenties and fives.

476
00:25:52.371 --> 00:25:55.850
I'll smash together from jumping in cabs going from the strip down to the cellar

477
00:25:55.851 --> 00:26:00.170
backup to stand up New York.
Um,
can you do that anymore?

478
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:03.740
I know they kind of switched the way they,
some of those guys.
Yeah.

479
00:26:03.741 --> 00:26:07.220
You could still do what it's.
Um,
I,
I try to stay like one club,

480
00:26:07.221 --> 00:26:09.650
one or two maybe in New York comedy club to stand.

481
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:13.340
I don't feel like running around,
like rushing around.
You know,
I'm not,

482
00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:16.700
I'm not my twenties anymore.
I'm just jumping on,
start doing this,

483
00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:19.520
running into another sec,
hold back over here.
I'm like,
oh good.

484
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.910
You know what I mean?
I'm working on my shit.
I know what I need to do.
I'm like,

485
00:26:22.911 --> 00:26:24.470
sometimes they look just like the staying the same.

486
00:26:24.471 --> 00:26:26.570
It's like I'll do three shows.
I did New Year's Eve,

487
00:26:26.571 --> 00:26:30.260
I did four shows at the stand to stay there all night.
Oh,
that's perfect.

488
00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.900
Other than the only time it sucks is when they were in between shows and it gets

489
00:26:32.901 --> 00:26:36.470
a little pack.
But then like they put them downstairs and you're fine.
Yeah.

490
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.611
What do you,
uh,

491
00:26:37.611 --> 00:26:40.490
how much standup do you do with all these like TV shows and books and all that

492
00:26:40.491 --> 00:26:44.310
type?
How often do you get to get two weekends?
I'm on road two weekends a month.

493
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.360
Oh,
that's good.
Yeah.

494
00:26:45.361 --> 00:26:49.370
And I do a one weekend in New York and then I take one weekend off.

495
00:26:49.371 --> 00:26:53.190
So I got my son one weekend a month alone also during the week to how old you

496
00:26:53.191 --> 00:26:54.900
saw now?
Seven.
That's amazing.

497
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.650
He's already getting into stand that he's been on stage like five times and he

498
00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:01.740
plays like from you.
You're like racing like the coolest kid ever.
I'm saying.

499
00:27:01.741 --> 00:27:05.840
And now,
now he's all about stand up now because I took them out.
Uh,

500
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.210
there was a show that Ronnie be,
Bennington does a show,

501
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:13.600
his radio show at the hard rock in New York every year does a live show.

502
00:27:13.601 --> 00:27:16.830
There's 400 people.
It's sold out.
And he did a segment where you go,
oh,

503
00:27:16.831 --> 00:27:20.700
comedians go up and tell an old joke.
So I brought my son with me and he goes,

504
00:27:20.701 --> 00:27:24.090
look,
if you want to go on stage,
you could tell an old joke is okay,
I will.

505
00:27:24.091 --> 00:27:26.970
And he went up there.
I introduced him to place,
went nuts.

506
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:30.020
He grabs the mic and I didn't even tell him.
I said,
he goes,
Oh,

507
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.670
you guys ready to hear a funny joke?
And I'm like,
man,

508
00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.520
he's already working in a crowded place cause not something as a host.

509
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.880
I know what he tells a joke and to play and it gets an applause break and he's

510
00:27:38.881 --> 00:27:42.360
up there and eat and we sit up on stage for another 10 minutes.
He felt that.

511
00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:45.660
Ever since then he's like,
dad got a show tonight.
Come on,
go get a show.

512
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:48.060
Let's just go get a show.
Just you more on stage,
right?

513
00:27:48.061 --> 00:27:50.820
You can go down to the club.
I go,
yeah,
I could come on.
We've got to do.

514
00:27:50.821 --> 00:27:52.140
Which one are we doing?
A show,

515
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:56.400
you know it's gonna be funny is that when he has to do like a book report about

516
00:27:56.401 --> 00:27:59.100
nervous,
she would get,
he's going to be like all amped up to do what?

517
00:27:59.101 --> 00:28:02.130
He's going to be psyched.
When I was in school,
I would just be like,

518
00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:06.540
I would be so scared and she wouldn't call it,
the teacher wouldn't call on me.

519
00:28:06.541 --> 00:28:07.500
It'd be like,
thank God.

520
00:28:07.501 --> 00:28:10.560
And then I see my buddy go up and then when he'd be done I'd be like,
Oh fuck,

521
00:28:10.561 --> 00:28:15.450
I wish I was him because it would be over.
And,
uh,
I had like a horrible,

522
00:28:15.451 --> 00:28:19.050
I had horrible fucking,
uh,
I guess was that stage fright?

523
00:28:19.051 --> 00:28:22.260
I would public speak and yeah.
I mean,
once I knew I wanted to do comedy,

524
00:28:22.261 --> 00:28:23.720
it took me a year to get onstage.

525
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:27.060
You get the balls to get on stage because I was petrified.
That's what I did.

526
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:31.020
I gave myself a,
I made a new year's resolution in 1992.
I was like,

527
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:34.530
at some point in this year,
I gave myself a whole year to do.
It was funny,

528
00:28:34.531 --> 00:28:38.010
but the second I did it,
uh,
all of a sudden it was a talent contest,

529
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.760
like in January and I just signed up for it.
And,
uh,

530
00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:45.150
it was like a month out and then there was so many guys,
they pushed it.

531
00:28:45.151 --> 00:28:49.920
And so I started like right in the beginning of March.
And,
uh,
yeah,
like horrible,

532
00:28:49.921 --> 00:28:52.740
horrible,
like I wish like I actually had,

533
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:56.280
I think that's great for a kid to,
um,

534
00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:01.290
I think it's great for him to meet a lot of people,
you know,
like,
um,

535
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:04.110
like we've had a lot of people come over the first year of my daughter's life

536
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.640
and um,
so like when people come over,
she's not really like,

537
00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:13.740
oh my God,
who's that?
It doesn't fuck with their universe.
And then to get them,

538
00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:18.840
you know,
to talk to the adults or speak publicly is something,

539
00:29:18.841 --> 00:29:23.430
I think that's a huge,
that's something I wish,
you know,
I was so fucking shy.

540
00:29:23.431 --> 00:29:26.610
I almost feel like someone needed to do that to kind of nudge me out.

541
00:29:26.611 --> 00:29:29.980
But if they did,
I probably wouldn't have been as fucked up.
I would've,

542
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.140
I would've just been some guy,
you know,

543
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:36.090
and it's funny the way up to management at this point and he's only in first

544
00:29:36.091 --> 00:29:39.390
grade and one's like,
oh,
so he must be the class clown and classical.
No,
he's not.

545
00:29:39.391 --> 00:29:42.660
I go,
that's why he could be a good comic.
He's not the guy.
Get away.

546
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:45.590
Look at me over here because those guys are never good.
Yeah,

547
00:29:45.591 --> 00:29:48.320
there's a lot of hacks in elementary,
you know,

548
00:29:48.321 --> 00:29:52.590
like fart jokes and those guys that tried to do comedy light or a terrible,

549
00:29:52.591 --> 00:29:53.660
then it's terrible that you know,

550
00:29:53.661 --> 00:29:56.890
you want the quiet guy that's just sitting back and observing everything and

551
00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.530
remembering it and writing it down.
You don't want the guy jumping on the desk.

552
00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.450
That's the guy.
He's going to be a hack.
He's going to do it.

553
00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.670
You're the guy who ended up meeting at your show later and he's just like,
dude,

554
00:30:04.671 --> 00:30:07.480
I was funnier than you.
I should have done this shit.
And you're like,
well go,

555
00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:09.380
go do it.
Or if he does stand up,

556
00:30:09.381 --> 00:30:12.560
he's the guy who does the arms thing at the end where to go behind a comic and

557
00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:17.610
work the arms.
How about great.
Was that though the first time you saw it?

558
00:30:17.611 --> 00:30:19.520
It was hilarious.
It was the greatest thing ever.

559
00:30:19.521 --> 00:30:24.020
Cause I saw I had an itch down my crotch and they'd have some hot girl and she'd

560
00:30:24.021 --> 00:30:25.170
have to go.
I know,

561
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.470
<v 0>you know,
one of the,
uh,</v>

562
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:30.670
one of the most misunderstood comedians of all time,

563
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.770
I believe is Gallagher because everybody looks at him like he was this fucking

564
00:30:35.771 --> 00:30:39.040
guy smashing all this shit.
He was making fun of advertising.

565
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:42.780
That's what that bit was,
right?
Sledge dramatic.
What the hell is it?

566
00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:45.280
And it didn't work,
but it was all this visual stuff.

567
00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:50.140
But so many people took it at face value.
They just wanted to go like,
Oh

568
00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.120
<v 1>God,
we're going to get like cottage cheese all in orange juice all over.</v>

569
00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.680
They'd ever got the bid.

570
00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.450
<v 0>And what killed me is if you watched the beginning of his act,</v>

571
00:30:58.451 --> 00:31:02.950
he had some really,
really good material,
clever material.

572
00:31:02.951 --> 00:31:04.780
I'm at one time Patrice rest,

573
00:31:04.781 --> 00:31:09.781
his soul was talking to him on the opie and Anthony Show and he was saying how,

574
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:16.000
um,
you know,
you need to pick a path.
You know,
it was great.

575
00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:16.441
You get you,

576
00:31:16.441 --> 00:31:19.920
they're going to do this Carlin stuff or you're going to be the guys smashing

577
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:23.380
shit.
And like he just wasn't able to convey it in a way.

578
00:31:23.381 --> 00:31:27.080
And I remember listening to it.
I was driving,
I was listening to on the radio.

579
00:31:27.081 --> 00:31:29.500
I was just going like,
yes,
yes,
exactly.

580
00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:31.570
He had that fucking bit where he sat down in the,

581
00:31:31.571 --> 00:31:35.380
in the school desk and he did this whole bit where he starts talking about how

582
00:31:35.381 --> 00:31:39.280
weird words are spelled in our life and our,
uh,
English language.

583
00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.420
He started with the word.
I just remember him going like something like,
uh,

584
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:47.950
I ended up going to like it,
uh,
like heard and then you point here,

585
00:31:47.951 --> 00:31:50.710
is this a bird?
No.
Beard,
B.
A R D.
Neat.

586
00:31:50.711 --> 00:31:53.020
When you did the whole fucking thing and then the end,

587
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:56.640
he got back to the word that he started with and then he just does this,

588
00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:58.690
it just all in circles.
And that's why he didn't go to school.

589
00:31:58.691 --> 00:32:01.020
It's like fucking great bit.
Yeah.

590
00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:03.850
For some reason he had to be sitting at a school desk when he did it.

591
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:07.210
So everybody starts going,
always a prop guy.
I Dunno.

592
00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.390
<v 1>No,
I remember he used to do his standup.
I remember seeing,
I like Tom has a,</v>

593
00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.980
Katie was on roller skates right then.

594
00:32:11.981 --> 00:32:15.160
They do a thing where it was like a giant couch and he put a trampoline in it

595
00:32:15.161 --> 00:32:18.570
and shit and like every,
so everybody would remember that.
Right.

596
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:21.850
But in the middle of all that,
he had this,
no.
Yeah,
I know he did.

597
00:32:21.851 --> 00:32:25.270
I remember at the end he would,
but yeah,
he was almost like Carlin back in a day,

598
00:32:25.271 --> 00:32:28.480
like a good smart material.
I was funny.
Yeah.
But yeah,

599
00:32:28.481 --> 00:32:31.870
you come out on a giant fucking tricycle and then,

600
00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.550
and then he wanted of it gets lost,

601
00:32:33.551 --> 00:32:35.940
the grows and then he retires and he sells his act.

602
00:32:35.941 --> 00:32:40.220
It was brother Gallagher to Gallagher to goes out.
He starts making a fortune

603
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.430
<v 0>and then gala gets jealous.
She goes,
wait a minute,
now I want my act back.</v>

604
00:32:43.431 --> 00:32:44.750
He was like,
no,
you sold it to me.

605
00:32:44.751 --> 00:32:48.050
And then they had to go to court and now Gallica too can't do it anymore.

606
00:32:48.051 --> 00:32:50.900
So get the real gile goes back out there.
Yeah,
he,
he,

607
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.900
he told them to do it when he couldn't tell.

608
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:55.940
I think I've heard so many stories and then he told him to stop doing it.

609
00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.780
I just remember when that came when Gallagher too came to Boston.

610
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:04.760
It was the funniest fucking thing cause like Gallagher to to the layman sounded

611
00:33:04.761 --> 00:33:08.450
like,
oh he wrote a new hour,
you know what I mean?
Like Ghostbusters,

612
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:11.270
Ghostbusters part to Gallagher Gallagher part too.
Right.

613
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.700
So he would go up there and it would be like,
it would,

614
00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:19.340
it wouldn't take any more than three or four minutes.
Like right out of the gate.

615
00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.990
It's like why does his voice sound so weird?

616
00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:25.100
Cause he kind of looked like if you sat in the back and then people just start

617
00:33:25.101 --> 00:33:27.470
what within four formats.
It's like,
Dude,
this isn't Gallagher.

618
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:28.850
Who the fuck is this?

619
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:32.960
And then this murmur would start and he that could fucking guy wouldn't even

620
00:33:32.961 --> 00:33:35.810
address it and he would stay up there for an hour as people going like,

621
00:33:35.811 --> 00:33:39.710
who the fuck is this guy?
Um,
I only watched the first 10 minutes.

622
00:33:39.711 --> 00:33:42.680
I had to run out and go do a spot.
But the tension in the room,

623
00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.680
that was back then where you could actually just do 40 member,

624
00:33:45.681 --> 00:33:49.940
45 was closing just to 45 minutes somehow.

625
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:51.170
Then it became like an hour.

626
00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:55.190
I could see I still do 45 a lot of times 45 on the road.

627
00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:56.953
Sometimes I'm like I'm gonna,

628
00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:00.520
I'm just going to do 45 if you're in like a club and they got a second share,

629
00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.840
like a funny bone or something like that.
They've got a second show.

630
00:34:02.841 --> 00:34:07.790
But even sometimes I just feel like doing 45 of 45th grade.
It's a blast.
Yeah.

631
00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:10.280
Cause you look down when you've got your 35 years.

632
00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:12.830
Like I got fucking ten one not that I want to get off stage where all my God,

633
00:34:12.831 --> 00:34:15.950
this is going good.
I'm good.
45 minutes to close.

634
00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.990
That's like having a beer in the afternoon.

635
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.140
He got nothing to do for the rest of the fucking day.
You know,

636
00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:25.700
I'm jealous of his clean comics who get to like,
uh,

637
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.830
like I've heard Regan we'll do like afternoon,

638
00:34:27.831 --> 00:34:32.120
like a matinee show and if I ever for some reason could find enough fucking

639
00:34:32.121 --> 00:34:36.200
animals to show up for a matinee show for me,
I would stop working at night.

640
00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:39.900
I would do a fucking two o'clock.
It's like in radio then,

641
00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.160
but oop is still always telling me about like doing how afternoon drive is like

642
00:34:43.161 --> 00:34:47.300
the greatest thing because you,
you know,
you,
you have a life like you can,

643
00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.740
if you still want to go out that night,

644
00:34:48.741 --> 00:34:50.300
you can and no matter how hard you hit it,

645
00:34:50.301 --> 00:34:53.840
you can sleep cause you're not back on the air until like noon or one or two

646
00:34:53.841 --> 00:34:55.940
o'clock in the afternoon.
But um,

647
00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:01.370
I dunno when I get old in my whole crowd turns into like the blue hairs,
uh,

648
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:05.640
like I will have no fucking problem switching to being the man.

649
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:08.030
I'll fucking do it.
I'll do an afternoon show.
You can do,

650
00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:12.050
you can do a five o'clock or five o'clock and seven 30 easily.

651
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:15.440
People want to go out early and are all the comedy clubs have switch this time.

652
00:35:15.441 --> 00:35:16.550
So like seven o'clock,

653
00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.780
seven 30 on a Friday for a show and seven o'clock on a Saturday.

654
00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.140
You know what I hate the most?
I hate seven and 10.
Oh yeah.

655
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:27.680
I didn't know it was time in between to me.
Absolutely.
Way Too much time.

656
00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:31.040
So you get the goody goody shown up at 10 and then you get the fucking meth

657
00:35:31.041 --> 00:35:34.670
heads at seven then you get the meth heads at 10 I always think like,

658
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.820
what can we just do seven and nine seven,
nine just

659
00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.760
<v 1>exactly.
I'll do for my type 45 we'll get them in,
get them out.</v>

660
00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:46.000
Do you need me off so you can turn this room over?
Now,
that pet peeve of mine,

661
00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.210
now we can pitch about clubs.
When the first show starts late,

662
00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:53.010
it's like how did it start late?
You knew what to.

663
00:35:53.011 --> 00:35:55.160
I can see the second show starting late because you,

664
00:35:55.161 --> 00:35:56.890
you know somebody spilled some drinks and shit.

665
00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.530
This is the physics right out of the fucking game.
Yeah.
You don't want to,

666
00:35:59.531 --> 00:36:01.630
you want to put yourself in a hole right off the bat.

667
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.080
If it's seven o'clock there's no reason for it to start at seven 15 just started

668
00:36:05.081 --> 00:36:08.500
at seven the has got to take the bullet.
Oh,
I took the bullet.

669
00:36:08.501 --> 00:36:10.260
You took the bullet when your emcee and sorry,

670
00:36:10.261 --> 00:36:11.680
this motherfucker's got to take it.

671
00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:14.870
Does people still walking in and they're eating?
I it,
sorry man.
Yeah,

672
00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.560
but you know,
these kids today,
they're all just say,
hey,
can we wait a minute?

673
00:36:17.561 --> 00:36:21.220
Cause you know there's people still coming in.
I always go,
yeah,
yeah,
don't worry.

674
00:36:21.221 --> 00:36:23.950
Don't worry.
Right.
Oh my God.
The amount of fucking times.

675
00:36:23.951 --> 00:36:26.410
That's the most amazing thing about that.
Richard Pryor special,

676
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.600
the one that he did down there at the terrorist theater,

677
00:36:28.601 --> 00:36:30.390
the one he had the red shirt is he,

678
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.430
when he came out there was still people getting in this seats.

679
00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:35.650
So anybody who's like a nerd for comedy,

680
00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:39.910
like that situation is every situation that an opener gets put in,

681
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:45.130
he came out as a headliner on his own special dealt with that situation that

682
00:36:45.131 --> 00:36:49.480
crushed.
Right.
I actually think,
you know,

683
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:51.370
just being a nerd fan of his,

684
00:36:51.371 --> 00:36:55.750
that that put them in the zone because rather than going out and having to jump

685
00:36:55.751 --> 00:37:00.130
into a bit going,
I am shooting as special and,
and here's my first idea.

686
00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:05.370
He went out there and just fucking started riffing and like I think it just

687
00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:11.020
after that it's the greatest special of all time.

688
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.690
And you don't think he had an opener that did time?
No,
he did what?
To whom I owe.

689
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.370
So we did.
He had,
did he have a band?

690
00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:24.150
Um,
I used to know this right cause I remember uh,

691
00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:29.190
Eddie Murphy on delirious had the bus boys from the movie 48 hours.

692
00:37:29.191 --> 00:37:33.720
He had them open,
uh,
who the fuck did he have?
I used to know this.

693
00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:39.040
It was like Gladys knight or something like that.
It was a singer.
Oh,
okay.

694
00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:42.670
And they sang and everybody fucking went out to the bathroom afterwards.

695
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:44.680
And um,

696
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:46.060
<v 2>yeah,</v>

697
00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.580
<v 1>they were like,
Richard is still coming back to the seats.
He's like,
no,</v>

698
00:37:48.581 --> 00:37:49.870
I want to go out now.
I want to go out now.

699
00:37:49.871 --> 00:37:52.810
Like he just was failing it and they just send them out there.

700
00:37:52.811 --> 00:37:56.800
And I think that the chaos of it was what he kind of thrived in.

701
00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.200
Um,
I dunno,
this is like some nerd shit,

702
00:38:00.201 --> 00:38:02.050
but just the stuff that I've done it right about him.

703
00:38:02.051 --> 00:38:04.300
Like when he was in like Vegas and everyone was sitting down,

704
00:38:04.301 --> 00:38:07.120
he's supposed to wear clean and like thought that whole structured thing about

705
00:38:07.121 --> 00:38:12.030
that he had like a fucking meltdown but then you get a more in that the,

706
00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:16.780
the,
the little more chaos that was like,
like more of like his,

707
00:38:16.781 --> 00:38:19.090
his kids' comfort zone was kind of chaos in a right.

708
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:23.880
It seems just from what I read it man obviously never met the guy.
I'm just um,

709
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:25.301
the worst was that,

710
00:38:25.301 --> 00:38:29.470
I'm sure you went through it as member when you could still smoke in the comedy

711
00:38:29.471 --> 00:38:33.250
clubs to first show Saturday was a no smoking show when they were always
uptight.

712
00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.230
Yeah.
They were always a tight as,
they weren't a good crowd.

713
00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:37.450
You knew if you just get through it,

714
00:38:37.451 --> 00:38:39.860
that show the second show is going to be great cause they would have drinkers

715
00:38:39.861 --> 00:38:42.920
and smokers and they're fun people and they'll just laugh.

716
00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.530
But the first ones are fucking that.
They want to be home early.

717
00:38:45.531 --> 00:38:48.320
They go out early and they don't want to put up with any smoke and they were

718
00:38:48.321 --> 00:38:50.240
always fucking tight.
It felt like a job

719
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.840
<v 0>coming out to just get this done.
Let's go to the comedy show.
Yeah,</v>

720
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:56.590
we'll be home by nine 30 I remember when,
when,

721
00:38:56.650 --> 00:39:00.430
when they used to fucking like by whole,
I don't know,
my first,

722
00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.200
like my first eight years of stand up,

723
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:06.550
that would put me to 2000 right around 2000 they started to have the smoke free

724
00:39:06.551 --> 00:39:10.100
stuff.
Like I had actually had like a smoker's cough a little bit.
I remember we,

725
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:14.080
I would wake up the next morning back when I had hair and I would get in the

726
00:39:14.081 --> 00:39:17.500
shower and when the water would pour over me,
all the smoke that was in my hair,

727
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:20.230
I,
which I would just breathe it in and it smelled like I fought a fire.

728
00:39:20.231 --> 00:39:24.580
So I started doing was I,
and I noticed I was getting a cough.

729
00:39:24.581 --> 00:39:26.370
What I started doing was,
uh,

730
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.910
I'd come home after the shows and I would immediately take a shower and that was

731
00:39:30.911 --> 00:39:33.580
just fucking throw my,
you know,
I was still living at home at the time,

732
00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:37.240
eight years.
I know when I was in New York by then.
But like the first,
um,

733
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.310
three years when I was still living at home with my parents,

734
00:39:39.311 --> 00:39:43.120
like I would just throw the clothes right in the fucking hamper and all of that

735
00:39:43.121 --> 00:39:46.080
shit.
And uh,
can you maybe eyes would be like,
I'm going to be on stage.

736
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:47.470
My eyes were like burning

737
00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.930
<v 1>the funny bone and Saint Louis was always like,
it was,</v>

738
00:39:49.931 --> 00:39:52.000
it was like a smoke machine.
Like you were at a concert.

739
00:39:52.001 --> 00:39:54.660
It was like Motley Crue starting off,
you know,
shout at the devil.
Yeah.

740
00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.010
You couldn't see a foot in front of you.

741
00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.270
The whole fucking room smoked and you're like,
Holy Shit.

742
00:39:59.271 --> 00:40:03.490
And had to do like three shows on a Saturday.
I'm like,
this is brutal on my,
yeah.

743
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:06.660
<v 0>Now you find him with doing like standup with,
uh,</v>

744
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:08.120
cause then when I went back to New York,

745
00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.430
I couldn't believe how many groans I was getting.

746
00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:13.720
Like I was getting a lot of groans and in,
um,

747
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:16.700
or just like people like kind of look at each other.
Like,

748
00:40:16.701 --> 00:40:20.610
what the fuck could just blows my mind that young people are like,
they,

749
00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:24.380
they act like old people in clubs now and I feel like they are,
they're like,

750
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:29.900
I dunno like it cause they grew up on social media.
Like you just saying shit,

751
00:40:29.901 --> 00:40:32.360
like you're going to get in trouble.
How have you found,

752
00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:35.030
it seems like you think the New York scenes great.
Like I'm out of it.

753
00:40:35.031 --> 00:40:39.410
I just went back for a couple of days and I think I was a little weirded out by

754
00:40:39.411 --> 00:40:40.340
some of the,
uh,

755
00:40:40.341 --> 00:40:44.390
the people that are you finding it that it's there because you've been there,

756
00:40:44.391 --> 00:40:47.210
like you could sort of just because you're there every fucking night,

757
00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:48.280
like you don't notice a change?

758
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.890
<v 1>Yeah,
I don't see,
I don't see a change in too much.
I mean,</v>

759
00:40:50.891 --> 00:40:52.630
I don't see a change in out here either.

760
00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:55.030
When I do sets at the comedy store and Improv,

761
00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.180
I could pretty much do the same set.
I'm really feel it.
Um,

762
00:40:58.181 --> 00:40:59.530
I don't know where you did and,
but I,
you know,

763
00:40:59.531 --> 00:41:02.110
I know it like a deer stand or New York comedy club.

764
00:41:02.111 --> 00:41:05.130
They just come in to laugh and there's not really,
no one's really gone,
man,

765
00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:09.310
that crowd sucks.
That's so uptight.
And so we're not getting that at all.

766
00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:10.163
So you know what it was.

767
00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:13.220
<v 0>I live out here now,
so I'm comfortable,
comfortable out here.</v>

768
00:41:13.221 --> 00:41:15.950
So I feel like la crowds are better than New York and it's just because I'm

769
00:41:15.951 --> 00:41:18.440
living out here and I'm just used to it.
I think that that's what it is.

770
00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:22.550
<v 1>Why always hated La Crowds.
When I used to come out 10 15 years ago,
I would,</v>

771
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:25.760
you know,
it was like,
what?
Why is this guy so angry on stage?

772
00:41:25.761 --> 00:41:28.010
I just didn't get it.
You know what I mean?
I wasn't physical,

773
00:41:28.011 --> 00:41:31.220
I wasn't smiling all the time and shit.
I'm like,
man,
these crowds are rough.

774
00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:35.300
And then it turned,
I don't know,
like maybe seven,
eight years ago where it just,

775
00:41:35.301 --> 00:41:38.510
you could do whatever you want and the comics were dirty and edgy and they

776
00:41:38.511 --> 00:41:41.360
laughed at because the laugh factory for so long,

777
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:46.100
this is such a weird thing to say.
It was too happy a place.
It was too well lit,

778
00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:47.211
you know?

779
00:41:47.211 --> 00:41:51.220
And then I saw that thing in the background look like the Warner brothers and

780
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:54.170
that's all folks will take a big fucking cartoon.

781
00:41:54.171 --> 00:41:58.430
So I'd get in there and you could see the whole fucking Rome and then I just got

782
00:41:58.431 --> 00:42:02.000
like self conscious when I would go on that stage being like just if you said

783
00:42:02.001 --> 00:42:06.990
anything fucked up.
But now I love the club.
Um,
it definitely was,
I,

784
00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.700
I,
I tried to stay away from that club because I knew I never did well on there.

785
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.190
Do you think that like,
uh,

786
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:16.250
there's going to be a backlash to this?

787
00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:19.880
Like a sort of like,

788
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:24.890
I dunno cause I'm not saying everything that people get offended by is,

789
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:29.240
is wrong because that's not accurate.
But um,

790
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:31.270
the overreaction in this,

791
00:42:31.271 --> 00:42:35.300
this like I'm kind of thinking how every generation rebels against the other

792
00:42:35.301 --> 00:42:39.490
generation.
The previous,
I'm kind of thinking like the next group of,

793
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:43.040
of young kids coming up.
I guess maybe it's wishful thinking.

794
00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:46.880
I'm hoping that they're going to be more like the people I knew in the seventies

795
00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.970
and eighties.
I don't think so because this generation,
the young ones now,

796
00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.750
they don't drink,
they don't do drugs.
They might smoke a little pot.

797
00:42:53.751 --> 00:42:54.980
They're not like promiscuous,

798
00:42:54.981 --> 00:42:58.040
like the last generation before that where they were,
you know,

799
00:42:58.041 --> 00:43:02.630
having sex early and getting no one 19 year old kids are not going in the woods

800
00:43:02.631 --> 00:43:04.350
and Drinkin you know what I mean?

801
00:43:04.351 --> 00:43:07.550
To not get high and not doing mushrooms like we did.
I was,

802
00:43:07.551 --> 00:43:10.730
I was smoking pot at 12 years old.
I was drinking and smoking cigarettes.

803
00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.680
<v 0>When you would hide the beers that you were all excited,
like you still,</v>

804
00:43:13.681 --> 00:43:16.320
everybody was like,
okay,
just steal like three beers from you dad.

805
00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:19.350
I'll still three bubba and he put together like this,
this stash.

806
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.890
And then you'd go and you'd bury him in the fucking woods member when you would

807
00:43:22.891 --> 00:43:25.920
go out there.
It'd be so fucking cold that they froze,
froze.

808
00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:28.740
And then you'd have to fucking just sit there and just slowly,

809
00:43:28.741 --> 00:43:31.590
SIF is solely said that you wouldn't even be getting drunk interviews,

810
00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:36.030
giant ice of fucking beer or they'd get skunked.

811
00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:39.690
Uh,
if you left them out there too long,
even as every weekend I was like,

812
00:43:39.691 --> 00:43:40.590
you'd go to the woods,

813
00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:44.760
you get as fucked up as you possibly could and then the cops would show up every

814
00:43:44.761 --> 00:43:48.900
fucking weekend.
Chase you are there and everyone to leap in their cars wasted.

815
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:54.210
I mean there has to be a happy medium between that and what the fuck is going
on.

816
00:43:54.211 --> 00:43:56.820
Uh,
I like how I'm talking about this.
Like I know what kids are doing.

817
00:43:56.821 --> 00:44:00.660
They're also doing like fucking ecstasy and meth and shit.
It is pretty nuts.

818
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:01.230
Yeah.

819
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:05.900
<v 1>But I,
I seriously like the,
they're not,
they're not output,
you know,</v>

820
00:44:05.901 --> 00:44:07.320
like drinking and stuff like that.

821
00:44:07.321 --> 00:44:10.260
I got a bunch of nieces and nephews and their friends and stuff like I see it

822
00:44:10.261 --> 00:44:13.650
and none of them doing anything.
Don't touch alcohol.
They don't smoke.

823
00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:15.090
They're not even in the woman.
I would

824
00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:19.670
<v 0>you do if there was a flat screen TV in your house,
you know,
and these kids,</v>

825
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.090
a lot of people get like a couple of them.

826
00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:24.570
This is like a fucking TV and like every major room in their house.

827
00:44:24.571 --> 00:44:29.040
You can go online,
talk to people,
play in video games.

828
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:33.600
You can watch porn on your right,
on your phone.
Yeah.
You could watch plane.

829
00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:34.720
You watch a scene.

830
00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.230
A fucked up it is that you can just watch footage of a plane crashing.

831
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.380
Nobody knew what the fuck that look like when we were growing.

832
00:44:40.381 --> 00:44:43.280
He had to go to like can,
there's some war footage,
but the,

833
00:44:43.281 --> 00:44:47.310
you can just watch you literally see anything.

834
00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.280
What does it look like when a guy jumps off the building?
He hits the pavement.

835
00:44:50.281 --> 00:44:51.330
What does that look like?

836
00:44:51.331 --> 00:44:55.140
I don't know what that website is because I was never into the death shit.
Uh,

837
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:59.910
but you,
you know,
I remember some of the fucking comics I was came up with when,

838
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.360
when all that Isis Shit,
when they was saw in people's fucking heads off,

839
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:07.230
they would go on and watch it and then they would come in like,
Oh God,

840
00:45:07.231 --> 00:45:10.950
it was so fucked up.
It's like,
why would you do that?
Like I actually know,

841
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:14.760
like I did a bit one time about being on fire,

842
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:19.830
screaming and blah,
blah blah,
blah blah.
And a buddy of mine,
it's comic I knew,

843
00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:21.060
told me.
He goes,

844
00:45:21.061 --> 00:45:23.880
that's actually not the noise people make when they get burned to death.

845
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:27.660
And he started imitating the noise.
It was even creepier.
And I'm like,

846
00:45:27.661 --> 00:45:30.060
how the fuck do you know that?
And he goes,
ah,
you know,

847
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.090
I've watched some pretty dark shit.
It's like you fucking,

848
00:45:33.091 --> 00:45:37.530
somebody got burned to death and you,
you sat and fucking watched it.

849
00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:38.660
I don't know.

850
00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:41.690
<v 1>I saw one isis beheading video.
My brother sent it to me and he's like,</v>

851
00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:44.390
don't worry,
it's not what it is.
It's a joke at the end.

852
00:45:44.391 --> 00:45:47.810
Just watch it through the end just to mess with my hall and I,
and it was,

853
00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:51.370
it's still,
that was like 15 years ago,
10 years ago.

854
00:45:51.371 --> 00:45:53.690
I still can't get out of my mind.
I never watched that stuff.

855
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:56.270
I don't want to want to see anybody get hit by a car.

856
00:45:56.271 --> 00:45:59.440
I don't want to see any of that shit.
They live if they live.

857
00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:01.730
<v 0>It's just kind of,
yeah,
you want to,
I like the happy medium.</v>

858
00:46:01.731 --> 00:46:05.420
If you can't handle the car is somebody getting gored by a bull because it's

859
00:46:05.421 --> 00:46:05.871
literally like,

860
00:46:05.871 --> 00:46:09.130
the only thing cartoon does not exaggerate is how high you go into the air.

861
00:46:09.131 --> 00:46:13.040
When it bull hits you,
I'll fuck,
I don't have my phone and look my phone,

862
00:46:13.041 --> 00:46:17.070
this guy fucking,
this dude's running.
And he's uh,
he said,
you know,

863
00:46:17.071 --> 00:46:19.330
it was fucking idiot.
He's in the ring with a bunch of other guys.

864
00:46:19.331 --> 00:46:22.160
As bunch of bowls run around and he didn't have his head on the swivel.

865
00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:25.700
He gets fucking shut up in the air and the ball takes off and the guy goes into

866
00:46:25.701 --> 00:46:29.090
like a fetal position and then everybody comes and saves him and now he's

867
00:46:29.091 --> 00:46:33.290
running like looking back to see if the bulls come in.
And as he's looking back,

868
00:46:33.291 --> 00:46:37.680
another bull comes to the
guy again.
Yeah.

869
00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:40.400
It was just like if he was an NFL player,
he's like,

870
00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:44.150
he was on special teams as some shit in his,
uh,
his career's going to be over.

871
00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:48.130
I do have to read a little bit of advertising here,
but um,
uh,

872
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:49.850
I can't even say how great it is to see.

873
00:46:49.851 --> 00:46:54.080
I don't ever get to see it now that I became a big phony out here in Hollywood.

874
00:46:54.081 --> 00:46:57.690
Well,
you know,
when you've got a kid too,
man,
it's a whole other,
yeah.

875
00:46:57.710 --> 00:47:01.850
You know this,
this weekend is,
is my daughter's first birthday.
First Birthday.

876
00:47:01.851 --> 00:47:06.200
Wow.
I'm baking my first cake and my wife and invited all these people.

877
00:47:06.201 --> 00:47:08.240
There's going to be all these kids there,
but what,
we're going to have a cool,

878
00:47:08.241 --> 00:47:10.610
like,
it's like adult food,
right?
You know,

879
00:47:10.611 --> 00:47:12.920
if you want some whiskey or something like that,
whatever,
you know,

880
00:47:12.921 --> 00:47:16.400
if the other spouse is cool,
we'll let you drive.
It's fine.

881
00:47:16.401 --> 00:47:18.230
And then we got all this cool shit with the kids.

882
00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:23.420
I never call it gift bag is is like this fucking bag of like gummy bears and

883
00:47:23.421 --> 00:47:25.100
just,
I don't know,
kids love gummy bears.
Right?

884
00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:29.020
<v 1>You know,
10 years ago you'd never thought you'd be baking a cake.
But my theory,</v>

885
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:30.220
whenever

886
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:31.840
<v 0>you think like,
I don't know if I could do this,</v>

887
00:47:31.841 --> 00:47:35.020
this is kind of what you do for the kid.
If there's a kid involved,

888
00:47:35.021 --> 00:47:39.550
do you get a pass?
Oh yeah,
no.
My,
my,
my wife said to me,
she's going like,

889
00:47:39.551 --> 00:47:41.650
I don't know,
it's gonna be all these people because the recipe,

890
00:47:41.651 --> 00:47:42.484
I had this for like a,

891
00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:46.980
like a two layer cake and then she may want to make it three and then she's just

892
00:47:46.981 --> 00:47:47.501
like,
well,
you know,

893
00:47:47.501 --> 00:47:50.260
you could just go to the grocery store and do the Dunkin Hines thing.

894
00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:52.780
And I was like,
no,
I'm not fucking doing that.
All right.

895
00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:56.670
I'm doing this every year.
Like this is one of these things that you,

896
00:47:56.671 --> 00:48:00.310
you got to have on the,
on the resume for like when your kid gets old,

897
00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:02.710
it'd be like,
what kind of dad?
What kind of dad?

898
00:48:02.711 --> 00:48:04.540
Which my dad made me a cake every year.

899
00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:08.450
I got to at least have that because I'm a fucking lunatic and I know I'm going

900
00:48:08.451 --> 00:48:11.920
to snap.
Well,
my son has gone a little person to be around.

901
00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:15.900
I'm an asshole so I at least got to come through with a cake,
right?
No,

902
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:18.490
you have to document everything too because they don't believe you.

903
00:48:18.491 --> 00:48:20.140
That's the advice I got from other parents.

904
00:48:20.141 --> 00:48:23.020
Take pictures because they're not going to believe that you took them to

905
00:48:23.021 --> 00:48:26.080
Disneyland every year and all those and you did all the shit with them.

906
00:48:26.081 --> 00:48:30.250
So whenever I take my son anywhere and event,
I take a picture.
So I go,

907
00:48:30.251 --> 00:48:33.160
hey motherfucker,
this is what I did at five.
This is what I did at six.

908
00:48:33.161 --> 00:48:34.740
Look what I did.
Dan Marino told me.
Dot.

909
00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:38.830
Moreno told me one time he came out to Mike show and I ain't even get to see how

910
00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:40.570
he gets to him.
Yeah,
he'd tell me,
he seems,
Hey,

911
00:48:40.571 --> 00:48:43.630
Dan Marino was out when I was in Fort Lauderdale.
It's like,
fuck,

912
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.370
I want to love if he came back.
He's such a humble guy.
Oh,
he's great.
He's funny.

913
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:50.870
He's awesome,
man.
I got to tell them what I've been wanting to tell him forever.

914
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.040
I was like,
dude,
if you play today in your prime with these rules of coverage,

915
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:58.750
you would throw for 6,000 yards without a problem every season,
and he's,
ah man,

916
00:48:58.751 --> 00:49:00.520
I appreciate that.
I appreciate that.

917
00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:04.780
Now he knows he still loves to show off his arm.
He loves to just go,

918
00:49:04.781 --> 00:49:08.050
let me just show you.
When they did those rock and jock things under Superbowl,

919
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:12.520
those rappers,
you know like qtip or something and he's firing at him.

920
00:49:12.521 --> 00:49:15.820
Then did you see to see us?
He must've watched Dan Marino football life.

921
00:49:15.821 --> 00:49:19.890
Phenomenal was arm goes up,
ball comes out.
It still looked like when,

922
00:49:19.891 --> 00:49:21.520
when they were just showing him throwing the ball,

923
00:49:21.521 --> 00:49:25.330
it looked like they sped up the film.
That's like a,
it's like a fucking a viper.

924
00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:27.430
You can't even see it.

925
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:31.300
It just fucking goes up in the burnout and it's a tight spiral.
Um,

926
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.050
that's funny.
Listen Motherfucker,
I took it here.
I took it here.

927
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.800
You're going to say he taught so just take document and take pictures the whole

928
00:49:38.801 --> 00:49:42.870
time.
We didn't do anything dad.
I'm already worried that uh,

929
00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:46.780
when they go through that period where inevitably they hate you because they

930
00:49:46.781 --> 00:49:50.050
think it gets to the kid gets to a point where they know enough shit that they

931
00:49:50.051 --> 00:49:53.500
think they're ready to live on their own.
That comes around like what?
1112,

932
00:49:53.501 --> 00:49:55.540
13 and then you just got,

933
00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:01.270
then you just got to wait to the like 26 I think.
And then they kind of like,

934
00:50:01.271 --> 00:50:03.100
oh wait a minute.
You know,
it's so rough.

935
00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.980
So it seems like it's like a rough 15 years.
Let me read this post.

936
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:13.150
Stop doing this doctor Phil.
Shit.
All right.
Oh me undies.
Everybody owe me undies.

937
00:50:13.151 --> 00:50:17.380
Me undies.
Mother,
fuck,
I took you here to me,
undies,
me undies.

938
00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.880
I opened your fucking first beer.
All right,

939
00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:23.710
me and you want to look good and your underwear and be comfortable.
Right?

940
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:28.340
But that perfect balance is hard to find.
Doubts.
Sacrifice the comfort.

941
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:29.540
Why would you do that?

942
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:34.310
Talk about why me undies is the best underwear you will ever own.
Well it's free.

943
00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:37.580
They send it to me,
you know,
so I'll wear it.

944
00:50:37.581 --> 00:50:41.060
Fill out good at fills on my balls and then I'll tell you guys how great it is.

945
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:44.920
It is.
I've got to tell you,
it is pretty amazing.
And um,

946
00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.450
it's got a superhero vibe to it.

947
00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:49.070
So I always feel a little stronger when I wear it.

948
00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:53.420
Does that contractually fill my obligation there monies will be the most

949
00:50:53.421 --> 00:50:55.310
comfortable pair of underwear you will ever own.

950
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:59.510
Made from sustainably sourced natural soft fabric that is three times softer

951
00:50:59.511 --> 00:51:03.910
than cotton.
Ultimate feel good undies for what you want to feel.
Uh,

let's wrap this up.

980
00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:34.580
I want to get Jim Florentine Florentine Florentine Florentines,

981
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:38.840
um,
NFL picks for this weekend.
Patriots.
Jags,

982
00:52:38.841 --> 00:52:42.860
you already picked a pats that,
let's talk about the eagles and the vikings.

983
00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.850
Two teens that have never won a Superbowl.

984
00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:50.360
Neither the Jaguar three out of 14 had not won a Superbowl.
That's

985
00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:51.890
<v 1>a tough one.
This is going to be,
you know,</v>

986
00:52:51.891 --> 00:52:56.060
cause the two backup quarterbacks and their,
um,
Minnesota has got a good deal.

987
00:52:56.061 --> 00:53:00.530
You don't know what nick falls is going to show up,
right?
Um,

988
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:03.680
I'm going to go,
I'm going to go Philly.
You're going to go Philly.

989
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:06.470
I'm going to go fill at home Philly at home fucking ends.

990
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:09.320
All that excite that in Minnesota.
Yeah,
I think so.

991
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:13.280
And the city of brotherly say should have lost that New Orleans game.

992
00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:16.730
They should have,
you know,
what did I lose it?
And then New Orleans,

993
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:21.030
fuck the whole thing up.
So yeah,
it was,

994
00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.690
imagine if you are a die hard saints fan

995
00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:29.440
<v 0>and that would be like,
that would literally be like if you fucking,</v>

996
00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:33.520
if you did a fucking standup special,

997
00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:36.160
you had the greatest special of all fucking time.

998
00:53:36.161 --> 00:53:37.720
And then right at the end of your special,

999
00:53:37.721 --> 00:53:41.080
you went to put the mic and the mic stand is somehow you did like a fucking face

1000
00:53:41.081 --> 00:53:45.060
plant.
I'm trying to think like what you could do.
Like you did it or maybe,
oh,

1001
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:49.970
there was no audio.
Oh yes,
it was wave.
No,
but you'd have to go and somehow you,

1002
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:52.310
you fucked up.
Okay.
Yeah.

1003
00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:53.870
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1004
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:55.970
<v 0>No,
the end.
You just go,
I like fucking kids.</v>

1005
00:53:55.971 --> 00:53:59.980
And you'd take a dick out and start jerking off.
Maybe it's not that,

1006
00:53:59.981 --> 00:54:04.100
that and that.
Yeah.
So I think,
yeah,
the eagles maybe a field goal though when it,

1007
00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:08.360
when a buyer for it and it'll be Philly and patriots and patriots,
you know.

1008
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:14.300
Okay.
31 20 something like that.
I like that.
I'm hoping the Patriots win.

1009
00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:17.630
And you just look at the quarterback.

1010
00:54:17.631 --> 00:54:21.830
So that's where you've got a dog who has a better defense eagles or a vikings?

1011
00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:25.820
The Vikings,
I kind of want the vikings are on the road.

1012
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.480
They got an a better defense and then you know,
they got a backup,

1013
00:54:29.481 --> 00:54:31.220
but he's the guy at this point.
Yeah.

1014
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:34.970
Case Kanombe that's what's making me feel old now is the names of quarterback

1015
00:54:34.971 --> 00:54:38.330
case Carson.
It's just like our generation is gone that there's no,

1016
00:54:38.331 --> 00:54:42.200
Jim says no bills.
No,
no,
not anymore.
There's no Steve.
Remember Steve?
No.

1017
00:54:42.201 --> 00:54:45.510
Steve to Berg anymore.
Steve Debars,
the Marino,

1018
00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:50.600
you know Stevie on Yo like I left is like Jay,
uh,

1019
00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:55.310
Yo Yo Guy Jake.
Oh,
Jay Cutler.
Jake's not in my field.
Goal kickers.

1020
00:54:55.311 --> 00:54:59.090
Cody.
I,
I've never,
there was never a coating on the dolphins till last year.

1021
00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:02.740
Oh,
they love to see names that old.

1022
00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:06.140
Everybody born in the 90s seem to have like a c name.
It started with Clemens.

1023
00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:09.440
Oh no,
he,
he named everything with a k.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
the Cody.

1024
00:55:09.441 --> 00:55:12.320
But like it was that.
All right,
so you'll pick it up.
I'm going to say,

1025
00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:18.270
I'm hoping the Patriots win and then I have no idea.
Ah,

1026
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:21.770
such a fucking hard when I would actually say the vikings go in and break the

1027
00:55:21.771 --> 00:55:25.370
eagles heart,
but the football gods smiled on him last week.

1028
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.250
Am I going to go against the Vikings again this week?

1029
00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:31.780
I can't do that because then if they win,

1030
00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:34.960
I'll have to go against them again if the Patriots win and then I'll be jinx in

1031
00:55:34.961 --> 00:55:36.850
my own team.
So do I pick it up?
Fuck that.

1032
00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:40.810
And I don't think there's going to be a big home field advantage of the vikings

1033
00:55:40.811 --> 00:55:44.290
going into soup bowl.
A lot of those are corporate tickets and it doesn't,

1034
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:48.760
the Patriots can play anywhere,
so it doesn't matter.
My,
I think,
uh,

1035
00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:53.260
that's a tough one.
That's the game.

1036
00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:57.520
Vikings Eagles is a game that's going to be a good one.
I e.

1037
00:55:57.610 --> 00:56:02.340
I'm going to say Vikings on pic.
No,
you took the eagles.
I'll take the vikings.

1038
00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:04.450
Fuck it.
I'll take the vikings.
Yeah.

1039
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:08.710
I just think the old nick foals is going to show up.
Old Nick foals shows up.

1040
00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:13.390
But both of those fucking teams,
both those franchises,

1041
00:56:13.391 --> 00:56:16.990
the football gods love to fucking yank the rug out from underneath.
I know.

1042
00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:23.440
I think there's a chance to stadium I collapsed on the bowling team.
Either way.

1043
00:56:23.441 --> 00:56:26.080
It's going to be great,
Jim.
So great to see it.
So awesome.

1044
00:56:26.081 --> 00:56:27.760
