00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.750
Hey,
what's going on?
It's filled burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:05.751 --> 00:00:09.950
November 5th,
2012 how's it going?

3
00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:12.950
How are you?
As you can tell,
this is once again,

4
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.600
one of these ones I'm doing from the road.
I don't have a mix of,

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.120
I suppose to buy a really small one.
But then I went to,
uh,
I dunno,

6
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.740
I bought this giant one.

7
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.360
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.300
<v 0>Like I guess it was going to sound better than my other one.</v>

9
00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:32.750
I don't fucking know.
But all I know is,
is too big to take on the road.

10
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:36.770
And then I was going to buy a small one,
but I'm here in New Orleans and they,

11
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.470
I don't know.
I don't know where to fucking buy one in New Orleans.

12
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.010
And I know while you come to are from New Orleans,
so like,
dude,

13
00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:47.750
what the fuck does a zillion places,
you know,

14
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.920
dead have music?
Yeah.
Well where are they?
Okay.

15
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.390
I don't know where they're at.

16
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.010
I don't know what the fucking look up and a,
and I got,

17
00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:00.290
I gotta be honest with you.
Like,
you know,

18
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.790
New Orleans is,
it's a great city,

19
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.820
but it's one of the shadiest I put it up there and like my top maybe four or

20
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:13.520
five shady cities that I go to,
you know,

21
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:16.160
and if you'd like to list in no particular order,

22
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.440
it would be a San Jose is shady.
Uh,

23
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.220
downtown Cincinnati past five o'clock.
These all these,
all these cities passed.

24
00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:29.330
Five o'clock is shady.
Cincinnati,
uh,

25
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.530
Detroit all day,

26
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.700
all day Detroit all day Cleveland.

27
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

28
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.300
<v 0>Is that five set for,
to add to fucking New Orleans?</v>

29
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.930
This is the one thing I will say is fucked up as San Jose,
Cincinnati,

30
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:45.420
Cleveland and Detroit are just as far as being like,

31
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:50.130
I don't feel safe past 5:00 PM because anybody with who actually has ever filled

32
00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:54.670
out a w two form seems to go home at five Oh one,
uh,

33
00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:58.780
before that second shift of fucking zombies hustlers and uh,

34
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.920
God knows fucking Werewolf's come out.
Um,

35
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.830
I would say New Orleans,
I can't put my finger on it.

36
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.720
It's got this great music.
It's got great people,
but it just has that,
you know,

37
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.190
you're going to get your throat slit if you go down the wrong fucking street

38
00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:20.830
vibe.
It really does.

39
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.060
And this is what they don't have in that little tourist,
you know,

40
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.590
fucking brochure because it is great and you can get out,

41
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.050
go on a fucking river boat.
You can go down to Bourbon Street,

42
00:02:35.051 --> 00:02:37.150
which really Bourbon Street is really like,

43
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.260
that's the Times Square of New Orleans.
Like nobody from New Orleans.

44
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.000
I figured that out in about fucking 10 minutes when I went over to Bourbon

45
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.630
Street with fucking Paul Dude.
I called it [inaudible].

46
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.390
I was over there for like,
first of all,

47
00:02:52.391 --> 00:02:54.370
I was stone sober when I went down the street.

48
00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:57.190
And it's just that the whole vibe of that street,
you know,

49
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.630
it just says sex sucker punched.

50
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.060
Um,
hepatitis.
Those would be the three,

51
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.030
you know,
like if I was on the $10,000 pyramid,
those,

52
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:14.830
those would be the clues that I saw a sucker punched a herpes,

53
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.350
a dirty needle pass pass.

54
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.470
Let's go to the next,
we'll come back to it.
Um,

55
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.300
I fucking hate dual these without headphones to the point I'm actually wearing

56
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:31.080
headphones and I can't even hear myself.
It's like my fucking line,

57
00:03:31.081 --> 00:03:35.530
his security blanket.
But anyways,
New Orleans is the shit.
The food is amazing.

58
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.140
But um,

59
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.790
at night I have to tell you like it's the only city in America that if I

60
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:47.650
actually came face to face with a vampire,
like I wouldn't be surprised.
You know,

61
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.320
it's got the food.
Do you know,
I forgot that.

62
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.910
That's what really puts it over the top.

63
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:56.650
I would say the Voodoo yellow food do,

64
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.280
I don't even believe in that shit.
I don't believe in any of that shit.

65
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.740
But it's just the fact that somebody does.
And whenever you see those things on,

66
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.750
on Vudu,
on TV,

67
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:12.310
they always have like that crazed speaking in tongues,
look on their face.

68
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.050
You know,

69
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.160
some chick always has her titties out and she dumps the blood of a chicken all

70
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:19.880
over and it's just fucking get off.
It's what,
what,

71
00:04:19.881 --> 00:04:24.250
what do you deal with that's like Manson family shit.
You know what I mean?

72
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.750
I'd give Charles Manson somehow got out of jail and started running NBC and

73
00:04:30.941 --> 00:04:35.440
wanted to bring back that whole must see TV thing that they had.

74
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.270
They used to have back in the late nineties,

75
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.040
the first fucking pilot he would greenlight would be anything that had to do

76
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:46.260
with Voodoo,
you know,
hey wait,

77
00:04:46.261 --> 00:04:47.200
it has that ever been done

78
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.460
is sit calm around like a voodoo person.

79
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.770
That would really be terrible.
I would take all the fucking edge out of it.
Um,

80
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.420
anyways,
this is the Monday morning podcast for this week.

81
00:04:59.421 --> 00:05:03.100
As I mentioned a few weeks ago,
about a month ago,
um,

82
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.340
I started my own a podcast,
I guess radio station,

83
00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:12.341
I guess you'd call it podcast network with a Al Madrigal and some other smarty

84
00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:16.550
pants.
Let smarter than I am and a,
it's called all things,

85
00:05:16.551 --> 00:05:19.040
comedy.com and uh,

86
00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:21.760
we have a bunch of wonderful shows on there if you want to check it out,

87
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:23.600
but gradually going to be adding to the site.

88
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.140
We'll actually have things beyond just the podcast.

89
00:05:27.141 --> 00:05:28.190
We're going to start blogging,

90
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.940
start putting videos up and all that type of stuff.
Is,
this is the early times,

91
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.640
you know,
like Aerosmith's first record,
you know,

92
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.550
they didn't quite have the Aerosmith emblem drawn the way it is now.

93
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.980
It was sort of a simpler form of it.
You know,

94
00:05:42.981 --> 00:05:46.790
it took them till they got to about toys in the attic maybe after get your
wings,

95
00:05:46.791 --> 00:05:49.940
they still had that same one and now what?

96
00:05:49.941 --> 00:05:53.540
Now you want that old concert tee shirt with their original logo with this is

97
00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:57.860
the original logo,
all things comedy.com uh,
I got,

98
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:00.170
I'm going to try to do a Ari,
uh,

99
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.190
Ari Shaffir skeptic tank and then he actually Mexican,
you're going to hear that.

100
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:07.140
I'm going to text him about it before he even fucking know so that,

101
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.380
that's how inside you guys are.
But anyways,
um,

102
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.280
the brilliant Tom Rhodes partner of the all things comedy a network has a one

103
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:21.281
hour special called light sweet crude that just became available on Netflix last

104
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.600
week.
This guy's fucking hilarious.

105
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.870
Harland Williams from heartland highway has a new mobile app called heartland

106
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:32.600

It's available on iTunes via heartland app.com.
And,
uh,

108
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.840
Mazda Bronys crowd funding campaign for his movie.

109
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.900
Jimmy vests would,
American hero.

111
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:53.270
Here's the link to the campaign.
It's crowdfunding.
Ah,
you know,

112
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:56.160
I'm going to put the link up.
It's too fucking long.
Alright,
so there you go.

113
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.270
There's the plugs back to the podcast.
Back to the fucking Voodoo.

114
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.143
So anyways,

115
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.410
I told you last week that I was coming out here to knowledge and I was going to

116
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:09.650
go the bucket list game.
I was going to go to fucking New Orleans.

117
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.240
I was going to go to a baton rouge,
the Lsu game,
and fucking a versus Alabama.

118
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.730
And uh,
it was,
uh,
it lived,
it definitely lived up to the hype.

119
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.051
I'm telling you right now,

120
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:25.640
people who live in pro sports cities like I did where you look at like,
you know,

121
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:30.380
college teams,
like,
you know the deal.
I grew up outside of Boston,

122
00:07:30.381 --> 00:07:35.150
so I mean,
we had Boston College.
Doug Flutie was that big moment,

123
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.570
you know,

124
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.660
I know that they've had guys after that to basically Doug Flutie put them on the

125
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:39.021
map.

126
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:44.021
And when I was growing up basically college sports in Boston,

127
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:48.300
like our football team,
the eagles or the,
uh,
the,

128
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.380
you terriers back when they still had a fucking team,
first of all,

129
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:55.900
they didn't even televise the Bu Games and then the BC games,
you know,

130
00:07:55.901 --> 00:07:56.920
we had one of those teams,
you know,

131
00:07:56.921 --> 00:08:00.910
like when your team goes to kick a field goal,
like you could see the dorms,

132
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.720
you know,
you can see like the parking lot and that type of shit.

133
00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:09.040
We didn't have an enclosed stadium,
we just had bleaches on either side.

134
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.080
And then Doug Flutie came and did what he did and everybody got fucking paid and

135
00:08:14.081 --> 00:08:18.670
they made so much goddamn money off of that guy that they actually were able to

136
00:08:18.671 --> 00:08:22.320
enclose,
you know,
the stadium.

137
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.330
You know what I mean?
But you know,
college athletes shouldn't get paid.

138
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:28.770
They shouldn't get paid.

139
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:33.090
They make enough fucking money for the school that they can build a new football

140
00:08:33.091 --> 00:08:37.560
stadium.
I love that too.
When people go college athletes,
they get paid,

141
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:42.360
they get a free education free education pitch.

142
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:47.210
They just built a hundred thousand fucking seat stadium because all my will

143
00:08:47.211 --> 00:08:50.070
twinkle toe activities between the fucking hashmarks.

144
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.100
Oh I get a degree in business.
It's fucking ridiculous.

145
00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:57.870
I'll tell you that Lsu Alabama game,

146
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.810
there's over a hundred thousand fucking people there.
And by the way,

147
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.330
we sat way the fuck up that we sat there in that part of the stadium that they

148
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:10.590
added onto the original bull,
you know.
Oh it sucks.

149
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.650
They treat you like a fuck.
It's like you're flying in coach.

150
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.090
You don't even actually,

151
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:18.570
I never actually technically have ever even been in that stadium cause I never

152
00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:22.340
was with the ticket that I had.
They were like,
can't go on high.

153
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.470
You're going to up all out,
you know that fucking creole accent.

154
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:30.150
And I like literally had to like walk in the back door and a,

155
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:34.950
I vaguely remember going up I think like 36 fucking escalators till I finally

156
00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:39.210
got up top.
And uh,
it was still the shit though.

157
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.000
The one thing he can say when you're up there is

158
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.800
if you can't fucking read a defense and figure out what the fuck they're doing

159
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:51.600
from up there,
you can see the whole field.
It's phenomenal.
But,

160
00:09:51.601 --> 00:09:53.640
um,
I gotta be honest.

161
00:09:53.641 --> 00:09:58.641
I really learned how much I love Lsu by how fucking devastated I was when they

162
00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:02.850
lost.
Like Versiti was beside himself.
He's like,
dude,
I didn't realize,
I mean,

163
00:10:02.851 --> 00:10:05.700
I knew you were a fan,
but you were like,
dude,

164
00:10:05.701 --> 00:10:10.050
I was like more pissed off than the fucking people,
the Lsu fans.

165
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.760
I got to tell you something.

166
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.050
Lsu Fans in Alabama fans and then it might be some fans around the SCC.

167
00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:17.940
I'm sure we're going to roll it fucking eyes at this,

168
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:22.170
but like as far as their fan behavior at the one game that I've been to,

169
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.310
they were phenomenal.
Absolute gentlemen.

170
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:31.180
I didn't hear barely any cursing.
Uh,

171
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.170
they were mixed in together.
You know,
the section where I'm up,
you know,

172
00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:37.320
up in the fucking bull pen up there.
They were all mixed in together and it was,

173
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.440
I was amazed at the behavior,

174
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.270
like when it looked like Lsu was going to win the game and some bunch of Alabama

175
00:10:45.271 --> 00:10:48.510
fans started leaving,
like,
which,
I don't know why the fuck you ever would,

176
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.540
you know,
people gave him some shit,
you know,
thanks for coming.

177
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.440
I have a nice long ride back to fucking Tuscaloosa,
you know,

178
00:10:58.441 --> 00:11:01.140
they'd say shit like that.
And that's about as deep as it got.

179
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.870
And it's fucking hilarious because I'm staying here at this casino with,

180
00:11:05.871 --> 00:11:08.760
there's a bunch of Eagle fans waiting to go to the saints game tonight,

181
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.440
which mean versus you're going to,

182
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.700
and you see the behavior of Eagle Fans in a fucking casino.

183
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:21.270
It's a hundred times worse than Lsu,
Alabama fence sitting next to each other.

184
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:27.380
Yesterday we were sitting there watching Sunday football and all of a sudden you

185
00:11:27.751 --> 00:11:31.110
just hear coming from the casino because everybody's wearing their jerseys.

186
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.880
All the dealers are wearing like saints jerseys and shit and all the eagles fans

187
00:11:35.881 --> 00:11:38.610
who are walking around with their jerseys on.
Um,

188
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.150
and I just hear from fucking the other side of the casino.
I just here,

189
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:47.170
<v 2>asshole,
asshole,</v>

190
00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.450
asshole.

191
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.050
<v 0>And I'm thinking like that's those stones that sounds like the shit they do.</v>

192
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.040
The Philly games when they appointed somebody with a different jersey.
Right.

193
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.730
And then I just hear,
hey gee,
oh eh,
Eh,

194
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:02.311
eh.

195
00:12:02.311 --> 00:12:07.311
He goes like obnoxious as fucking hell in the casino.

196
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.100
<v 3>Okay.</v>

197
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.500
<v 0>So me and Virginia was sitting in like this fucking,</v>

198
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.170
I don't know how to explain it.
It looks like a dance club that you,

199
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.660
that you'd go into when you're playing like grand theft auto.

200
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.131
That's what it looked like.

201
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:26.000
There was this big center thing that had these crazy like neon lights that would

202
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.540
gradually change like the background and like bill Cosby himself out of the

203
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:35.260
background would just gradually change color except on his specialty.

204
00:12:35.261 --> 00:12:36.130
He had like four colors.

205
00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:40.450
This was only two colors that would go from red and then it'll just morph into

206
00:12:40.451 --> 00:12:44.290
gold and then back to red look like a giant fucking glow stick.

207
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.280
And the,
but there was like these go go dancers stages,

208
00:12:48.281 --> 00:12:51.640
which obviously nobody would say it was just these fucking fat football fans.

209
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:52.211
By the way,

210
00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:55.720
football fans are the most oddest shaped fucking freak show you've ever seen in

211
00:12:55.721 --> 00:12:58.760
your life.
Just a bunch of fatty sitting there like,

212
00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.140
like Walrus is sunning themselves,
you know,

213
00:13:02.141 --> 00:13:04.270
before they get bitten the neck by a polar bear,
right?

214
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.350
So we're sitting there and we're along this bench,
right,

215
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:12.460
and it's me Versie and then there's this,

216
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.530
this black dude was sitting there for a second who sort of had like this African

217
00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:20.350
sorta had a Voodoo vibe.
He had like this fucking,

218
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.983
<v 3>uh,</v>

219
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.780
<v 0>old school,
like,
you know,
like a run DMC,</v>

220
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:30.010
ll cool j when they had the big gold chains,
he had a big chain like that,

221
00:13:30.011 --> 00:13:34.660
but it was plastic and it was made out of yellow.
It just yellow plastic,

222
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.850
like a Fisher price.

223
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:42.310
My first emcee chain he was wearing and he was wearing that as like a fucking 40

224
00:13:42.311 --> 00:13:43.930
year old guy or he looked 40.

225
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:49.230
The guy looked like he had a rough life and he had all his teeth from a set

226
00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:52.510
number nine over your two front teeth,

227
00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:56.480
eight and nine starting from the right going over up top for those of you and

228
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.640
never worked in a dental office.

229
00:13:57.641 --> 00:14:02.200
So he had number nine all the way to the back and fucking eight to the other

230
00:14:02.201 --> 00:14:03.730
side was just completely missing.

231
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Like he took like a Mike Tyson fucking hook back in 1988 so far as he goes up to

232
00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:15.190
the bar and that dude kind of came over.
Wgu Dude,

233
00:14:15.191 --> 00:14:18.730
guy sits down and I've gone like Af,

234
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.680
I don't want to talk to this fucking Voodoo Dude,

235
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:24.220
but I'm going to look like a bitch if I dealt with Versie comes back if to this

236
00:14:24.221 --> 00:14:27.400
fucking half of vampires sitting here with his plastic chain.

237
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.240
So I just tapped him and I just said,
hey,
excuse me about buddy sitting here.

238
00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.170
And he kind of gave me a look just long enough for me to be like,

239
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.390
am I going to fucking fight this guy?

240
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.040
Am I going to have the weirdest bite marks on my forearm ever where they won't

241
00:14:42.041 --> 00:14:46.450
even know what the fuck get me.
And then he slid over,

242
00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:47.284
thank God.

243
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.590
Then of course Versie who's all personality comes over and sits down next to the

244
00:14:50.591 --> 00:14:53.600
guy in the meaty Lucas shooting the shit.
Like they went to fucking war together,

245
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:56.720
right?
So eventually the Voodoo guy gets up and leaves

246
00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:02.380
and then we kind of got this whole like bench area to ourselves,

247
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.620
like cushion bench.
It's nice,
you know,
watching the fucking games,

248
00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:08.530
having a good time.
Uh,

249
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:12.130
and then this other dude comes over another the black dude,
don't worry.

250
00:15:12.131 --> 00:15:13.660
Eventually there'll be making fun of a white dude.

251
00:15:13.661 --> 00:15:16.900
So this doesn't seem like it's just fucking me being freaked out by black
people.

252
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.030
And this guy comes over and he looked like Thurman Thomas.

253
00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.770
Like how Thurman Thomas would look now.

254
00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:28.400
And you know those people when they sit down,
they never stopped rocking.
He,

255
00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:32.500
he was doing that.
He was just sitting there fucking rocket,
just back and forth,

256
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:37.150
kind of doing this OCD thing with his fingers and then like muttering to
himself.

257
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:42.580
Right.
And he was sitting like,
we're on on this giant bench of cushion.
So He's,

258
00:15:42.581 --> 00:15:43.061
he's like,

259
00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:47.560
there's one empty cushion between Versie and this guy and versus so locked into

260
00:15:47.561 --> 00:15:49.180
the game.
He's watching the giants,

261
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:54.210
Dale is that he doesn't see this fucking dude like rocking back and forth and

262
00:15:54.911 --> 00:15:58.570
I'm laughing my ass off.
So finally,

263
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.320
because I keep seeing people wanting to sit down in that seat and then they see

264
00:16:02.321 --> 00:16:05.980
this dude's fucking Thurman Thomas the old Thurman fucking rocking back and

265
00:16:05.981 --> 00:16:10.570
forth.
I said,
okay guys,
let's do this fucking rain man shit.

266
00:16:10.571 --> 00:16:11.740
And I'm laughing my ass off.

267
00:16:11.741 --> 00:16:15.910
And I thought first he sub so right as far as he's taking a swig of his drink.

268
00:16:15.911 --> 00:16:18.690
I said,
hey versus you see that guy there and he looks over at me,

269
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.820
he does almost does a spit take.
I go,

270
00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.310
he's the human equivalent of,
you know,

271
00:16:24.311 --> 00:16:27.820
those things at the airport that are always spinning to keep the fucking birds

272
00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:29.810
off the runway.
So they don't fly into the edge.

273
00:16:29.811 --> 00:16:34.570
And he's literally the human equivalent of that preventing anyone from sitting

274
00:16:34.571 --> 00:16:35.404
in that seat.

275
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:41.490
And right as I get done saying that this fucking eagles fan comes over with a

276
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:45.940
tee shirt on astronaut haircut and just fucking like,

277
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.730
like movie drunk,
right?

278
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:53.790
Overact and drunk stumbling over and fucking just sits down like,

279
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.140
like on fucking one ass cheek.
Totally lean in his head.

280
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.280
See starts sliding down almost in Diversey first he was like,
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
hey,

281
00:17:03.281 --> 00:17:07.840
easy,
easy.
And then there's fucking th th the two worlds collides.

282
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.300
This fucking guy like I don't know what he did if he likes shotgun,

283
00:17:11.301 --> 00:17:14.800
some whiskey or if we actually took some drugs cause he was fucking out of it.

284
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:20.260
Starts tapping a rain man.
Thurman Thomas.
He taps him.

285
00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:24.880
And like the way this dude was rocking and talking to himself,

286
00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.250
I wouldn't even think that he could have a fucking conversation.

287
00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:32.580
But the second this fucking drugged up eagles fan tap fucking rain man Thurman

288
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:38.190
Thomas The do just snapped out of it and was like a fucking state trooper.

289
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:42.040
He just looked at the dude
and,

290
00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.720
and the fucking eagles fans like said something like,
you know,
I said,

291
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.140
how you doing or how you live in or something.

292
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.500
<v 4>Okay.</v>

293
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.440
<v 0>And the dude just looked at him,
he can and he was like,
how you living?</v>

294
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.140
And he had this fucking look on his face like this pissed off look.

295
00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:59.440
And the kid tried to high five them and the guy,

296
00:17:59.441 --> 00:18:01.580
all of a sudden he just looked like he was gonna.

297
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.350
He had like that special needs strength and was literally just going to fucking

298
00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.290
punch this kid's lower jaw.
Fortunately that didn't happen.

299
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:10.403
<v 4>And</v>

300
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.450
<v 0>Raymond Thurman,
Thomas Slid over one more chair.
So now we got this fucking guy.</v>

301
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.700
<v 4>Okay.</v>

302
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.690
<v 0>And he keeps passing out,
falling on end.</v>

303
00:18:18.691 --> 00:18:22.620
Diversey and then he try and high five us.
And uh,

304
00:18:22.621 --> 00:18:25.080
we finally ended up having to get security.
You felt like assholes,

305
00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:27.210
but it was just like he was going to Puke.

306
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.730
You could just tell he was going to puke on somebody.

307
00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:33.570
So the security came over eventually got rid of them.

308
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.460
So then first he,
cause he's,
Mr Personality has to talk to fucking,

309
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:43.860
you know,
Thurman fucking Dustin Hoffman,
right.
And he goes,

310
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.580
he said something about the guy,
Eh,
you know,
hey,

311
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.010
that guy was a,
he seemed like he was pretty drunk.

312
00:18:52.011 --> 00:18:55.400
He seemed like he was going to Puke and the fucking rain man,
Dude,

313
00:18:55.401 --> 00:18:57.630
stop fucking rock.
And it looked at him,
he go,

314
00:18:57.631 --> 00:19:01.160
he looked like he'd go get his ass kicked.
And we were like,
all right man,

315
00:19:01.161 --> 00:19:01.910
nice talking to you.

316
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.570
And then immediately went right back to just sitting there fucking rock.

317
00:19:04.571 --> 00:19:09.410
And I couldn't figure the guy out either had either had some sort of mental

318
00:19:09.411 --> 00:19:13.430
problem or he had like fucking 20 grand on the game that he didn't have.

319
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.610
I don't know.
It was not even remotely fucking a music.
I have no idea.

320
00:19:16.611 --> 00:19:20.760
I'm fucking sitting here with headphones on.

<v 0>me and first he fucking go to Lsu,

348
00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.870
I say Saturday.

349
00:20:56.871 --> 00:20:59.390
For those of you not from Boston and um,

350
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.440
what's going to say?
I was actually just talking to them going,
you know,

351
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.600
I was like,
what the fuck of it happened in Michelob light?

352
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.950
It's the first beer I ever got drunk off of.
I don't give a fuck who you are.

353
00:21:11.951 --> 00:21:13.600
You got,
there's a special thing,
you know,

354
00:21:13.601 --> 00:21:17.740
it's like the first chicky ever fucking nailed it.
First Beer.
Yeah,

355
00:21:17.741 --> 00:21:20.350
but got drunk off of,
I had,
I had like,

356
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:25.450
I think I had like two MC lights the first time I ever caught a ball up buzz in

357
00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:28.480
Faneuil Hall in Boston.
And I was like,
oh,

358
00:21:28.481 --> 00:21:32.320
I think I liked this smash cut fucking 30 years later.

359
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.290
Um,
so anyways,

360
00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:39.040
we're here in New Orleans and we actually went to this fucking shady liquor
store

361
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.610
to buy a styrofoam cooler and all that crap.
And uh,
Lo and behold verse,

362
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:49.330
he comes out with some Michelob light and a bottle of Jameson and the whole

363
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:53.610
night before we're at the show and everybody in the crowd,
I'm like going,

364
00:21:53.611 --> 00:21:56.530
all right,
it's going to be 100,000 people.
It's a fucking seven o'clock game.

365
00:21:56.531 --> 00:21:59.680
What time should we leave?
And they're like six in the morning,

366
00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:02.920
seven in the morning.
I'm like,
get the fuck Outta here.

367
00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:07.450
There's not going to be 12 hours of traffic.
And they just kept laughing at me,

368
00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:10.630
acting like it was going to be this apocalyptic fucking traffic.

369
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.650
And I just kept thinking,
you know,
I go to the rose bowl every year.

370
00:22:14.651 --> 00:22:17.200
That's 100,000 fucking people.
Yeah,
there's traffic,

371
00:22:17.201 --> 00:22:21.190
but like it's not to that level.
And I get there for five hours before the game.

372
00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.000
These people are full of Shit,
you know?
And there's no way that that,

373
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.740
with the way I drink,
which I believe is called binge drinking,

374
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.650
there's no way I'm going to be able to get there 12 hours before the game.

375
00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:35.140
I'll pass out three times before the game even starts it by then.

376
00:22:35.141 --> 00:22:36.100
I'm not going to give a shit.

377
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.210
So we ended up leaving around one 30 fucking cruise to the game,

378
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.400
made a left off some exit right before the fucking stadium.

379
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.980
We just parked on a side street,
actually,
if you want to know what we parked,

380
00:22:50.981 --> 00:22:55.330
we parked on Stanford and Yale right in front of somebody's house.

381
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.110
They said it was 40 bucks to park on their lawn,

382
00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:02.020
but there was a space in the streets.
So we just fucking parked there.

383
00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.620
So then all of a sudden we realized we were like almost a mile away from the

384
00:23:06.621 --> 00:23:11.150
stadium and that we were going to have to carry this styrofoam cooler with ice

385
00:23:11.151 --> 00:23:12.320
and all these bears in it.

386
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:17.030
Him holding one side be holding the other and it's Dennis trade off this bottle

387
00:23:17.031 --> 00:23:21.440
of fucking Jamison was going to be fucking ridiculous.
So I got,
you know,

388
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.350
why don't we just slam a couple of these.
Let's,

389
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:27.110
let's take some weight out of this cooler.
I swear to God,
Dude,

390
00:23:27.111 --> 00:23:31.250
I think I drank five of those in like 90 minutes,
which at my age is impressive.

391
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:36.230
I wasn't shot gun and me there are funneling,
I'm like you pussies in college.

392
00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:41.180
It's the easy way.
You know what I mean?
I would,
I fucking,

393
00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:45.620
that's ripping off the bandaid.
I did work.

394
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:50.150
So I shut these things down.
Then of course then I got to Piss like a race horse.

395
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.800
So I'm drunk enough that my personality comes out and I don't come off like a

396
00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:58.040
con like I did when I was talking to fucking Thurman Thomas there.

397
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.950
I went up and I just knocked on the lady's door.
I said,
listen,

398
00:24:00.951 --> 00:24:03.350
I know I didn't pay to park.
I parked in your front yard.

399
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.340
Is there any way I can use your bathroom?
And she was like,
absolutely.

400
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.640
And I went in there and when I came out and gave her five bucks,
I go,

401
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:12.100
what did I say?
The uh,

402
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:14.533
<v 4>okay,</v>

403
00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.910
<v 0>ah,
what the fuck did I say?
Not The home security fund.
The hospitality fun.</v>

404
00:24:18.911 --> 00:24:23.470
She laughed.
She took the five bucks,
right?
And then she comes walking out later,

405
00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.910
no one that was slamming beers out there and she came out and she asked for our

406
00:24:27.911 --> 00:24:29.800
empties.
You know,

407
00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.810
that's what kind of economy we're living in here that someone's going to,

408
00:24:32.811 --> 00:24:34.060
I give somebody five bucks,

409
00:24:34.061 --> 00:24:36.940
they let me take a piss in their house and then they come out and they collect

410
00:24:36.941 --> 00:24:39.910
my empty.
So that's how bad it is.
By the way,

411
00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.820
if you live in New York City or you live in Los Angeles and you can't deal with

412
00:24:45.821 --> 00:24:47.530
how fucking liberal it is there,

413
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:52.800
you should come down to fuck baton rouge and go to an SCC football game.
Uh,

414
00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:56.320
you,
you would be in heaven.
What they were saying out there,

415
00:24:56.321 --> 00:25:01.030
they were saying Lsu fans,
a couple of them,
but they would go and no Bama,

416
00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.410
no Bama.

417
00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.070
And they would trash him for saying roll tide or they say,

418
00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:14.020
let me say around the bowl and down the whole roll tide roll.

419
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.160
And they went,
then they would literally mime them going down the toilet.

420
00:25:18.161 --> 00:25:23.020
And in case you didn't get,
what the fuck they were saying,
by the way,

421
00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.430
I,
I actually,
um,
I,
I've always liked Alabama too,

422
00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:30.610
you know,
and I know it's going to freak out.
Lsu Fans,
I'm not from here.

423
00:25:30.611 --> 00:25:33.130
So like I just like teams that are good,

424
00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.860
so actually like teams and the SCC that don't like each other,

425
00:25:35.861 --> 00:25:39.100
but Lsu is my fucking squad.
Um,

426
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.420
and believe me,
I fucking realize that when they lost,
uh,
you know,
it,
it was too,

427
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:49.130
I didn't like the way the Alabama fans dressed.
It reminded me,
it TC,

428
00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.210
you come out,

429
00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:55.210
frogs would they do that shit when they dress all dress like these fucking

430
00:25:55.211 --> 00:26:00.190
junior banker date rapists,
they go to a football game,
right?

431
00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:07.000
They were like,
they weren't Docker's
boat shoes.

432
00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.550
And then they have like a fucking polo shirt that they tuck in.
They,

433
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:16.390
I swear to God,
it's like,
are you serious right now?
You're from Alabama.

434
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:18.910
Oh,
who are you kidding?

435
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:24.310
I could see if you took off your Alabama Shit and you went to some place else

436
00:26:24.311 --> 00:26:25.570
and you tried to pull it off,

437
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:30.010
but eventually people are going to know you from Alabama and don't even fuck

438
00:26:30.011 --> 00:26:34.570
with me.
I've been to Alabama,
the civilized parts.
Okay.

439
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:37.900
I didn't go down to making a mobile or all that fucking shit where they,

440
00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.090
they're down there.
I mean,

441
00:26:40.091 --> 00:26:42.430
I don't even think they know Martin Luther King's dead yet.

442
00:26:42.431 --> 00:26:45.030
They're probably still haven't fucking meetings.
That's fucked up.

443
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.060
But they probably are.
We've got to get him.

444
00:26:48.061 --> 00:26:51.240
Why you think that took over the end bay?
He's gotta be somewhere.

445
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:55.680
He's like Elvis,
man.
He Ain't dead yet,
you know,
and as fucked up as that is,

446
00:26:55.681 --> 00:27:00.660
I swear to God
anyways.
Why?
It just,

447
00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:05.190
you know,
and there was this one,
this one fucking dude behind us.
All right.

448
00:27:05.191 --> 00:27:09.570
He had little seventh grade boy arms and he fucking,
he should have seen him.

449
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.960
All right.

450
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:14.050
He's got his little fucking dockers on and it's stupid fucking shoot he had and

451
00:27:14.051 --> 00:27:14.884
he has his gut.

452
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:16.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

453
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:20.650
<v 0>The funny thing was this kid was probably only about 50 pounds overweight,</v>

454
00:27:20.651 --> 00:27:25.090
but you could tell that he wasn't stopping and I was saying diversity.

455
00:27:25.091 --> 00:27:27.610
I go look at the,
I go look at that dude.
I go,

456
00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:29.920
just tell me that guy doesn't scream.

457
00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:35.020
Massive heart attack in about 20 years in is laughing.

458
00:27:35.021 --> 00:27:36.910
I go look at his shoes.
Those are heart attack shoes.

459
00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.590
He had like these fucking like,

460
00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.420
they were like boat shoes but they had like those tassels on them.

461
00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:45.131
I'm going to tell you right now,

462
00:27:45.131 --> 00:27:47.620
if you're a white guy and you wear shoes with tassels,

463
00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.640
there's no fucking way you're not going to have,

464
00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:54.670
you have a 98% chance of having a heart attack the second you put those shoes on

465
00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:56.380
and if you don't have socks on,

466
00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:01.440
it's a 100% that is the official dying at your desk or almost dying at your

467
00:28:04.991 --> 00:28:08.920
desk.
Fucking shoes.
You know,
like,

468
00:28:08.921 --> 00:28:12.890
you know how Chuck Taylors back in the day with the official punk rock fucking a

469
00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:13.983
sneakers,

470
00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:18.670
that meant you were into punk music and you were different because you and all

471
00:28:18.671 --> 00:28:21.070
your friends dressed exactly the same.

472
00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:28.150
Those fucking things.
So anyways,

473
00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:32.560
I'm watching the game and the exact reason why I became an Lsu fan.

474
00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

475
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:38.300
<v 0>Which was basically because of the way less miles,</v>

476
00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:42.740
you know,
the mad hatter,
the riverboat gambler,
whatever you want to call them,

477
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.190
would basically,
you know,

478
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.270
I actually set before the game,

479
00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.830
we're on Bourbon street and everybody was going out.
Even Lsu fans,

480
00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:54.360
we're going to think Alabama is going to get us.

481
00:28:54.361 --> 00:28:58.800
They're going to few whom are going,
they're going to kill us.
And um,

482
00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:04.380
I,
I,
you know,
I was drunk,
of course.
What else would I be doing?
And I was like,

483
00:29:04.381 --> 00:29:07.380
let me tell you something right now,
calling this right now,
Paul Versey,

484
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.000
there's going to be a fake kicked,

485
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:13.380
an onside kick of fake field goal and a fake punt.

486
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.590
He's going to pull out all the tricks and they're going to fucking win.

487
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:21.570
You Watch.
Well,
they did the fake field goal.
They did the onside kick,

488
00:29:21.571 --> 00:29:24.330
no fake punt.
But they also went for it on fourth down.

489
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:29.520
And if he didn't see the highlights,
none of it worked.
The onside kick work,

490
00:29:29.521 --> 00:29:34.170
but it didn't go 10 yards and uh,
uh,

491
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:37.170
Jesus,
they fucking blew it.
I was absolutely,

492
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.440
I couldn't believe I was fucking devastated.
I literally,

493
00:29:40.441 --> 00:29:41.950
I walked out of the stadium,

494
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:47.560
it was the quietest I've ever heard on a thousand people leave the stadium and I

495
00:29:47.561 --> 00:29:49.870
got to give it to the Alabama fence.
They weren't talking shit.

496
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:54.400
They would just like,
I think I was sort of the eagles fan at the game.

497
00:29:54.401 --> 00:29:58.180
I was the asshole.
I was just walking around,

498
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:01.210
fucking hammered,
hammered,

499
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.910
yelling at anybody I saw in red.
I would just go,

500
00:30:05.911 --> 00:30:07.480
Hey Amanda,

501
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.920
that dream ends tonight.

502
00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.980
It's gonna be a long ride.

503
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:18.940
I just kept saying that Alabama.
And they would look,
get me like,

504
00:30:18.941 --> 00:30:23.410
what does fucking shocked look on their face?
And I was like,
Jesus,

505
00:30:23.411 --> 00:30:27.220
you see that fucking guy?
Cause I didn't realize.
Like I said,

506
00:30:27.221 --> 00:30:31.090
I'm only judging them on one game here.
I thought you guys,
your,
uh,
I can't,

507
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.340
I can't figure southern people out.

508
00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:35.330
<v 4>Okay.</v>

509
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:39.650
<v 0>You know what I mean?
They're really nice,
really polite,</v>

510
00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:44.090
really friendly,
yet all the other shit

511
00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:49.880
confederate flags,
the south's going to rise again.

512
00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:53.540
The whole,
you know,
slavery wasn't that bad.

513
00:30:53.541 --> 00:30:56.720
A thing was it or the civil war wasn't about slavery.

514
00:30:56.721 --> 00:30:58.670
It was about representation and the fucking,
you know,

515
00:30:58.671 --> 00:30:59.690
they'd start doing that shit.

516
00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:01.383
<v 4>MMM.</v>

517
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:07.150
<v 0>I Dunno.
Can you really fault him for it though?
Isn't that kind of like the,</v>

518
00:31:07.151 --> 00:31:11.640
the same thing is like when your team does something Douchey,

519
00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:12.811
like films,

520
00:31:12.811 --> 00:31:15.810
the other team that you'll never quite admit that they actually cheated.

521
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:22.170
Oh,
by the way,
in defense of my New England patriots,

522
00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:27.270
um,
I was watching the Green Bay packers yesterday.

523
00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.830
Um,
and I saw,
I saw what's his face?

524
00:31:31.831 --> 00:31:36.831
Aaron Rodgers goes over to the sidelines and he fucking goes to talk to his

525
00:31:37.141 --> 00:31:38.850
coach.
And what does he do?

526
00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:42.050
He puts his hand over his mouth when he goes to talk to him.

527
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:46.020
Now why do you think that is?
Why do you think that is?

528
00:31:46.021 --> 00:31:51.021
Because somehow the other team could read his lips from that far away now,

529
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:58.340
because you think for some reason they actually have the NFL feed going or maybe

530
00:31:58.770 --> 00:31:59.131
just,

531
00:31:59.131 --> 00:32:03.690
maybe there's a chance that they're fucking doing something on the other side

532
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:05.783
that they're filming,

533
00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.640
that they're looking through binoculars and all that fucking horseshit.

534
00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:11.623
<v 4>I'm sorry,</v>

535
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.850
<v 0>I,
I'll,
I'll defend the page.
I have to go.
We fucking shoot you.</v>

536
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.380
What are you going to do everybody?
Everybody's doing it.

537
00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:21.700
I do the same thing when I defend Lance Armstrong,
Lance Armstrong.
So anyways,

538
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.690
I actually,
I,
I'm telling this story all over the place.
My,

539
00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.460
this is like a Terantin oh movie,
right.
I started in the middle,

540
00:32:27.461 --> 00:32:29.920
jumped to the beginning,
and now I'm at the end.
I don't know where I'm at.

541
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.370
Anyways,
somewhere in like the third quarter,

542
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.450
I got these epic hiccups and I just couldn't stop.

543
00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:42.650
And I had him for the rest of the fucking game through the night,

544
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:45.770
the entire drive home.
They went away a couple of times and they came back,

545
00:32:45.771 --> 00:32:50.420
like literally to the point I felt like my esophagus was going to snap in half.

546
00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:52.673
<v 3>MMM.</v>

547
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:58.540
<v 0>And then I went to sleep,
came home and had a pizza.
I had heartburn so I figured,</v>

548
00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:03.250
oh,
I know I'll use some pizza dough fuckin absorb that.
And uh,

549
00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:09.700
I went to bed and I actually got woken up by hiccups at seven in the morning

550
00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.930
and all day yesterday I just,

551
00:33:13.931 --> 00:33:17.590
I just had them on and off and on and off and on and off to the point I finally

552
00:33:17.591 --> 00:33:21.970
looked up.
What causes hiccups?
First of all,
I didn't even know what they were.

553
00:33:21.971 --> 00:33:24.940
I just thought it was when you swallowed air into your stomach and it was trying

554
00:33:24.941 --> 00:33:29.710
to get out,
but it couldn't.
I didn't know.
And everybody's telling me that their,

555
00:33:29.711 --> 00:33:34.030
their remedies and that type of shit.
So basically this is what causes,

556
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:40.090
after I've told you this story of what I did.
Oh.

557
00:33:40.091 --> 00:33:43.660
And by the way,
when I went to the game,
I had a burger,

558
00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:45.760
I had a sausage Poeboy,

559
00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.540
I had m and m's and I had something else.

560
00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:55.380
And I had already drank five fucking Michelob and an 90 minutes and then walked

561
00:33:55.421 --> 00:33:58.510
up to the stadium for a mile walking in the sun.

562
00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:01.720
And I had a big gulp of Jamison on ice.

563
00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:06.700
And then I smoked a Cuban cigar all in there.

564
00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.740
I don't really fucking remember the order.
And in the midst of all that,

565
00:34:11.741 --> 00:34:15.760
I was going and I've had that dream.
It's Ted Knight.

566
00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:16.870
I was a fucking mess.

567
00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:18.923
<v 3>MMM.</v>

568
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:24.340
<v 0>And then I got these echo epic hiccups.
So this is what causes hiccups.</v>

569
00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:25.993
<v 3>MMM.</v>

570
00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:31.660
<v 0>It says a very full stomach can cause bouts of hiccups that go away on their</v>

571
00:34:32.241 --> 00:34:33.270
own.
Uh,

572
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:37.730
a full stomach can be caused by number one,

573
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.400
eating too much food too quickly.

574
00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.500
Check drinking too much alcohol,
check,

575
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:51.500
swallowing too much air check,
smoking.

576
00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.810
Gotcha.
Right there buddy.
Uh,

577
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:58.880
a sudden change in stomach temperature such as drinking a hot beverage and then

578
00:34:58.881 --> 00:35:01.010
a cold beverage.
Now.
I didn't do that,

579
00:35:01.011 --> 00:35:04.850
but I definitely drank a lot of cold and then smoked.
I don't know,
fucking know.

580
00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:09.290
And the last one,
emotional stress or excitement,

581
00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.160
is it any wonder I had fucking hiccups for close to 36 straight hours.

582
00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.720
I did every fucking thing you could possibly do.

583
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.020
I was like a nerd going right down the checklist.
You know,

584
00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.960
I should've been like rocking back and forth talking to myself.

585
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:30.170
So basically,
uh,

586
00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:36.580
I'll tell you where the excitement came in was when I went into the,
uh,

587
00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:42.780
stadium when you come walking through the hall and I just saw those two Lsu end

588
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:45.990
zones and that tiger eye on the,
uh,

589
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:50.820
on the 50 yard line and I couldn't fucking believe I was there.
And um,

590
00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.480
I'll tell you right now,
no bullshit.

591
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.210
If you are in a pro sports town city and,

592
00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:01.860
and you'd Never Watch college sports cause you know,
you can't get into it,

593
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:06.010
you never watched it.
I've only followed the pros.
I'm telling you,
pick a team,

594
00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:09.060
pick a team,
get into it the way I did.

595
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:14.310
And fucking one year you and your buddies just take a fucking road trip,

596
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:19.290
tell the ladies to go fuck themselves,
go to the game,

597
00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:21.510
don't drink and eat as much as I did,

598
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:25.980
but definitely get yourself a nice cigar and uh,
go to the game.

599
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.220
It will definitely,
it will definitely be worth it.
I was actually,

600
00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:35.900
I was actually jealous that I didn't study harder in high school and didn't go

601
00:36:36.151 --> 00:36:40.440
to a,
to a,
to a college like that where,
cause that's,

602
00:36:40.441 --> 00:36:42.960
that's the amazing thing about those,

603
00:36:42.961 --> 00:36:47.940
this is like those games are like the,
the everything.

604
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:51.240
It's like generations of families are together.

605
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:56.270
There's like mini reunions of old drinking buddies and then there's the existing

606
00:36:56.821 --> 00:37:01.140
class.
I was just unreal.
Espn Game Day was there.

607
00:37:01.141 --> 00:37:05.010
It was fucking insane.
It was worth every God damn cent.

608
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:08.940
Uh,
so I dunno if you don't have enough shit on your bucket list,
I would,

609
00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.810
I would definitely suggest going to an sec game and don't go to some bullshit

610
00:37:12.811 --> 00:37:16.170
cupcake game in September,
you know,

611
00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:21.560
go,
go to go to a fucking game like that where there's like a hundred years of

612
00:37:21.561 --> 00:37:24.600
hatred.
I'm telling you,
it puts Red Sox,
Yankees,
shit to shame.

613
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:28.890
Go to go to fucking Michigan,
Ohio state,
Lsu,
Alabama,

614
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:34.110
Florida,
Georgia,
Oklahoma,
Texas,
telling you,

615
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.460
I'm telling you.
All right.
But we got it for fuck sakes.
We got it.
Um,

616
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:43.320
oh by the way,
Friday night,
Friday night when we were doing the show.

617
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:45.063
<v 3>MMM.</v>

618
00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.320
<v 0>Paul Versey got one of the fucking funniest tackles and he didn't even hear it</v>

619
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:55.950
because the guy did it so southern and like laid back as he was talking about

620
00:37:56.501 --> 00:38:01.150
some shit and he just basically said the tag was,
and he was just riffing,

621
00:38:01.151 --> 00:38:03.940
you know,
making it more southern.
Cause we were in front of that crowd.
He's like,

622
00:38:03.941 --> 00:38:08.410
you know,
I'll blah blah blah,
blah,
blah.
He goes,
I don't give a shit.
He goes up,

623
00:38:08.411 --> 00:38:12.040
kick some fat rednecks ass down the street or something like that.

624
00:38:12.041 --> 00:38:16.090
And then I just hear in the back of the crowd,
some dude goes,
tram it.

625
00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:24.040
It was fun.
It was the greatest.
And he sounded like he wasn't even bullshitting.

626
00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.880
I just loved that.
He's like,
I'm a fat redneck.
C'Mon.
Let's do it.
Fuck it.

627
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:32.890
Um,
speaking of which one of my favorite shows is coming up cause coming back,

628
00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:37.480
I of course,
I don't know the name of it because I'm an idiot.
Uh,

629
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:41.320
it's the one with those southern guys cook up the Moonshine

630
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:47.830
on film and there are like ducking behind trees is the cops come by and hoping

631
00:38:47.831 --> 00:38:51.160
that they don't find that it's still,
and it's like,
dude,

632
00:38:51.161 --> 00:38:53.200
this is all the damning evidence they need.

633
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:57.010
They don't need to walk through the woods anymore.
They just,
they have your name,

634
00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:00.940
they'll find out where you live and they'll just drive up and get you right.

635
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:05.500
That show has to be fake.
Why isn't that guy getting arrested?

636
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:10.390
They don't blot out his face or anything.
What's the do?

637
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:15.010
Uh,
all right,
let's get into this.
A southern Connecticut show.
Yeah.

638
00:39:15.011 --> 00:39:17.500
I'm doing a college at Southern Connecticut University.

639
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:23.710
William material would be toned down because of the college kids.
Um,

640
00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.920
where my act is right now,
there's nowhere to go.

641
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:32.500
I can't really tone it down because the subject's alone will probably be

642
00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:35.800
considered offensive.
So what I'm going to have to do is

643
00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:42.100
change the intro of each bit.
Well,
I'll,
I'll try and make it more relatable

644
00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.870
where I'll be like,
hey,
you know,

645
00:39:46.871 --> 00:39:50.170
here's something that might happen to you in 20 years.
If you don't get married,

646
00:39:50.171 --> 00:39:53.860
you keep drinking,
but then I'll just do the bits so don't worry about it.

647
00:39:53.861 --> 00:39:57.270
If you think about coming to the show,
it's going to be in an an adult shelf.

648
00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:01.540
I do a college once every two or three years.
Um,

649
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:05.890
and I'd be lying to you if I wasn't a little concerned about this one.

650
00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:11.330
I'm a little concerned about this.
There's a low pressure system coming in.
Um,

651
00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:12.520
tone down.
Hey Bill,

652
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:16.930
you think you can tone down the swearing during your podcast for who,

653
00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:23.210
why,
why,
why would I want to tone down?
You think he can go fuck yourself.

654
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:24.760
They'll go find another podcast.

655
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:28.660
Go to all things comedy and find another podcast to listen to.

656
00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.780
I love when people do that shit.
People like,
you know,
you know,

657
00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:35.440
you might want to consider
like,

658
00:40:35.441 --> 00:40:39.580
I'm sitting here doing this for you.
This isn't for you.
This is for me.

659
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:43.840
So I don't have any guests just sitting here talking to myself.

660
00:40:43.841 --> 00:40:47.560
You decided to listen to you do.
If you don't,
I don't give a fuck.
All right.

661
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:52.720
This is my fucking a,
this is my job that I can get fired from.

662
00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.980
You know,
when you just want to make a couple extra bucks,
you know,

663
00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:59.710
get out of the house.
Maybe you're not happy in your relationship.
You just,

664
00:40:59.711 --> 00:41:02.710
you know,
you don't like sitting around,
Hey,

665
00:41:02.711 --> 00:41:07.030
I want to do something else and get myself a weekend job.
Oh my God,

666
00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:11.510
he works so hard now sweetie,
he's sick of you.
Um,

667
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:13.540
no.
So I won't talk.
I won't turn it down.

668
00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:16.500
<v 4>Okay.</v>

669
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:20.430
<v 0>Anyways,
um,
my weekend,
Yo,</v>

670
00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.010
so for the past three weeks or so,

671
00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:28.370
I had been smoking weed on a normal and I must say,

672
00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:31.260
and I'm,
and I must say it's what he's trying to say.

673
00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:36.290
Life is so much more happier cause if any drama rolls through rose throw t h r o

674
00:41:38.061 --> 00:41:40.400
w rose through.
I know,

675
00:41:40.401 --> 00:41:43.220
just let it roll off and life is so much chiller.

676
00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:45.970
I'm just going to read this.

677
00:41:45.971 --> 00:41:48.730
How this person wrote it and life is so much chiller,

678
00:41:48.731 --> 00:41:53.080
more need to do this and stop being so damn uptight.

679
00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:57.640
Love your Monday morning podcast and have a good day.
Go Fuck Yourself.

680
00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:03.240
Are you saying that I need to do that?
Life is so much more happier.

681
00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:04.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

682
00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:09.270
<v 0>H a p.
P.
E.
R.
Cause if any drama roles throw,</v>

683
00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:14.750
um,
look after the way I drank this weekend,

684
00:42:14.751 --> 00:42:17.120
I'm going to give you shit for using any sort of substance.

685
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:19.220
I actually need to shut it down.

686
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.560
I would never advocate drinking the way that I drink.
I wouldn't.
All right.

687
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.220
I got this weird thing where I'm not an alcoholic.
I just fucking love doing it.

688
00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:31.520
I mean I could stop.
Uh,
Jesus.
I sound like the classic alcoholic.

689
00:42:31.521 --> 00:42:35.420
I can stop whenever I want to.
I took a fucking year off.
I was bored,

690
00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:40.160
but I was never sitting there like,
I need it man fucking knee.

691
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:42.320
I just liked doing it.

692
00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:45.890
I liked getting hammered and I like yelling at people in boat shoes,
you know,

693
00:42:45.891 --> 00:42:49.030
so me.
Uh,
but I definitely need to shut it.

694
00:42:49.031 --> 00:42:52.430
Once you start getting heartburn with the fuck sitting and making fun of these

695
00:42:52.431 --> 00:42:53.780
people,
like they're going to have a heart attack.

696
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:58.670
Isn't heartburn basically the uh,
the on ramp to major coronary failure.

697
00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:03.980
Oh,
speaking of which,
I'm reading this book right now,
eat to live

698
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:10.640
and every time I say eat to live,
I always think of iron maiden.
Ace is high.

699
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:17.510
Every time I say eat to live,
I hear Bruce Dickinson saying fly to live.

700
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:18.530
Live to fly.

701
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:20.343
<v 1>Uh</v>

702
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:24.710
<v 0>Oh the eighties.
Anyways,</v>

703
00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:27.830
you guys should definitely check out this book.

704
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:32.060
What'd you like me to read you an excerpt of it.
I gotta I gotta read you this.

705
00:43:32.061 --> 00:43:34.250
Let me put this on pause right here.
Actually.
You know what?

706
00:43:34.251 --> 00:43:36.260
Maybe it would be funnier if I just walk across the room.

707
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:41.690
<v 5>Hang on a second.
They walk across the room here to front.
Tried to find you.</v>

708
00:43:41.691 --> 00:43:44.930
Just busy yourselves.
Busy yourselves.

709
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:48.680
Talk amongst yourselves as I tried to find the park.

710
00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:51.083
<v 1>Fuck</v>

711
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:56.130
<v 0>there it is.
There it is.
Fair.
It is.
Okay.</v>

712
00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:58.230
Everybody take your seats.

713
00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:03.390
Take your seats where class is back in session.
All right,

714
00:44:03.391 --> 00:44:07.530
so this,
this,
this guy,
right?
He wrote this book,
Joe Fermin,
m d.

715
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:12.750
All right,
so you know,
he's smart.
He wrote this book,
eat to live.

716
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:15.870
So I had gone to the fucking gym.

717
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:19.890
Do you any reason why you have to go to the gym other than gravity?

718
00:44:19.891 --> 00:44:23.610
Pulling my fucking man tits down to the ground.
Every God damn day.

719
00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:28.220
It never quits unless you're laying it down.
You know,

720
00:44:28.221 --> 00:44:31.740
if you did a fucking headstand your whole life,
if you could do that,

721
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:35.130
would you fucking man tits eventually be in your face.

722
00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:40.470
What's the deal anyways?
This guy is basically saying,

723
00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:43.143
<v 4>okay,</v>

724
00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:44.410
<v 0>he used face,
you know,</v>

725
00:44:44.411 --> 00:44:49.010
you know forever that they've said the problem with the Vegan diet is that you

726
00:44:49.011 --> 00:44:53.090
can't get enough protein.
You're not going to get enough protein and that uh,

727
00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:54.590
<v 4>yeah,</v>

728
00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:58.190
<v 0>whatever.
Like vegetables aren't a complete protein or something like that.</v>

729
00:44:58.191 --> 00:45:02.510
You basically got to have a protein the size of your palm of your hand,

730
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:06.410
no bigger than that.
Make sure it's a lean cut and Yada,
Yada,
Yada.

731
00:45:06.411 --> 00:45:10.130
This guy's saying it's all bullshit.
Go to the fucking zoo.

732
00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:11.550
<v 4>Okay.</v>

733
00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:14.310
<v 0>The most jacked animal there is a God damn gorilla.</v>

734
00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:15.780
If you can't get any more jack than that,

735
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:20.280
a fucking gorilla is like an NFL linebacker fucking times 1000.

736
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:23.970
They said if you fucking had a,
uh,
a gorilla,

737
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.180
if you could actually make it bench press,
if you could actually make it,

738
00:45:27.181 --> 00:45:31.640
do it there.
No,
I said get over that.
Right.
How the fuck you going to make a door?

739
00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:36.450
Something I wanted to do it,
it could basically bench press two tons.
Easy.

740
00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:39.780
All right.
That's 4,000 pounds.

741
00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:42.810
If you dummies out there for you people overseas,

742
00:45:42.811 --> 00:45:46.530
I imagine that's a bunch of fucking uh,

743
00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:50.520
whatever the fuck measurement you use a bunch of stones.

744
00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:54.120
Um,
I think like a stone,

745
00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.070
cause I remember looking it up one time when I was listening to ACDC,

746
00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:03.570
whole lot of rosy weighing in at about 19 stone.
That was about 218 pounds,

747
00:46:03.571 --> 00:46:07.050
I believe.
Do the fucking math.
All right,

748
00:46:07.051 --> 00:46:12.000
so that's 19 times five.
That'd be about thousand pounds.

749
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:18.470
So that's like a hundred star.
Yeah,
it's about 400 stone.

750
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:23.240
350 stone at go fuck yourself.
So anyways,
he said,

751
00:46:23.241 --> 00:46:24.074
and you go to the zoo,

752
00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:27.440
the grill is the most fucking jacked animal you ever going to see.

753
00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:32.360
And they eat 80% vegetables,
20% fruit.
Now granted,

754
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:34.730
I realize I'm not a fucking gorilla,
but I tell you,

755
00:46:34.731 --> 00:46:37.370
I went to the zoo and I looked at God damn.
Monkey in the eye.

756
00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:40.790
You look at chimp in the,
I end up telling you they're us and wear them.

757
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:44.420
All right?
We're just,
we're just a little,
little,

758
00:46:44.421 --> 00:46:49.010
a little above or a little below depending on how you view the environment,

759
00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:51.710
you know,
in all our inventions,

760
00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:53.893
<v 4>the fucking</v>

761
00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:56.330
<v 0>goddamn mess.
We've made it the planet.
So anyways,</v>

762
00:46:56.331 --> 00:46:59.510
this is what the guy's claiming as far as cause my whole life,

763
00:46:59.511 --> 00:47:02.240
I heard about the four food groups and you build it around a protein.

764
00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:03.620
This is what this guy's saying.

765
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:05.783
<v 4>MMM.</v>

766
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:09.260
<v 0>He's basically saying,
oh,
I know I have.</v>

767
00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:13.100
This is going to be fucking hilarious because I can't read.
This is terrible.

768
00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:14.473
<v 4>MMM.</v>

769
00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:16.850
<v 0>He's basically saying,
you know,
you're not going to go to the supermarket.</v>

770
00:47:16.851 --> 00:47:18.410
And they say that shit that,
that,
you know,

771
00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:23.350
they'll say like this butter is 98% fat free,
you know,

772
00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:26.490
then you're like,
so this spot is fucking only 2% fat.

773
00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:30.850
It completely affected.
Uh,
it's actually bullshit.

774
00:47:30.851 --> 00:47:32.080
Butter is a hundred percent fat.

775
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:36.370
What they did is how they got around it is they just,
if you took like butter,

776
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:40.000
which is 100% fat and you throw it in a glass of water and then you start it up

777
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:44.950
and then rather than counting the caloric value of it,
of the butter,

778
00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.050
which is still 100% fat,

779
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:51.370
you did it by weight and you included the glass and the fucking water.

780
00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:56.680
That's how it becomes 2% fat by weight.
It's then becomes 2% per fat,

781
00:47:56.681 --> 00:47:59.170
but the fucking water is still 100% fat.

782
00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:02.410
It's like 2% milk is really 49% fat.

783
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.740
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

784
00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:06.420
<v 0>All right.
Does that make any sense?
Well it shouldn't cause I'm stupid.</v>

785
00:48:06.421 --> 00:48:10.260
So let me read what this,
this fucking guy bro.
And he's smart because he's an MD.

786
00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:15.510
I'm using weight instead of calories in nutrient analysis tables has evolved

787
00:48:15.511 --> 00:48:20.280
into a ploy to hide how nutritionally unsound in many foods are.

788
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.410
The role of the USDA was originally to promote the products of the animal

789
00:48:25.411 --> 00:48:27.750
agricultural industry.
Over 50 years ago,

790
00:48:27.751 --> 00:48:32.220
the Usda began promoting the so called four basic food groups with meat and

791
00:48:32.221 --> 00:48:36.510
dairy products in the number one and number two spots on the list financed by

792
00:48:36.511 --> 00:48:36.810
the,

793
00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:40.950
and this was financed by the meat and dairy industry and backed by nutritional

794
00:48:40.951 --> 00:48:45.330
scientists on the payroll of meat and dairy,
other meat and dairy industry.

795
00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:50.370
This promotion ignored science.
Am I going to get sued for this?
Uh,

796
00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.830
this program?
I'm only,
I'm only quoting the book people.

797
00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:56.520
This program could be more accurately labeled the four food myths.

798
00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:01.200
It was taught in every classroom in America to me included with posters

799
00:49:01.201 --> 00:49:04.650
advocating a diet loaded with animal protein,
fat and cholesterol.

800
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:08.790
The results of this fraudulent program were dramatic in more than one more ways

801
00:49:08.791 --> 00:49:12.510
than one Americans began eating more and more animal foods.

802
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:17.700
The campaign sparked the beginning of the fastest growing kids.
Hang on,

803
00:49:17.701 --> 00:49:22.701
I got to turn the page epidemic in history and heart attack rates soared to

804
00:49:23.011 --> 00:49:27.480
previously unheard the levels.
So I don't know whether you believe that or not.

805
00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:30.250
I got to still think that people will always eating steaks.

806
00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:33.780
All I know is I'm going to try to give this thing a shot.

807
00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.770
It's not that I'm going to go vegan.
All right.

808
00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:42.060
And I know if you try to do anything outside the norm of that,

809
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:46.410
automatically people are going to be sending me emails first.
She drive a Prius.

810
00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:50.010
Now you're a Vegan.
Why don't you just stick a dick in your ass?

811
00:49:50.011 --> 00:49:53.160
I get always becomes that.
Right?
Um,
no,

812
00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:55.050
actually I'm going to try and have one salvad a day,

813
00:49:55.190 --> 00:50:00.190
the very least to offset my fucking steak eating ways.

814
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:02.783
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

815
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:04.280
<v 0>I dunno,</v>

816
00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:07.790
the fucking book basically blew my mind if it's even remotely true and I got to

817
00:50:07.791 --> 00:50:10.270
admit,
I've kinda been doing it a little bit and it's uh,

818
00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:14.630
it's making me feel pretty good and I'm shitting like a fucking race horse.

819
00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:16.940
Sorry ladies.
Um,

820
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:20.780
I'm actually learning how to eat a salad without any dressing on it.

821
00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:25.820
Cause I guess that even like olive oil has a 150 calories per teaspoon and I

822
00:50:25.821 --> 00:50:28.640
gotta tell you,
I easily it 70 spoons.

823
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:33.530
That's not even that much,
you know?
Yeah.
But yeah,
you know,

824
00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:36.740
I might as well eat a fucking burger.
I'm an idiot.

825
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:42.140
So to eat a salad without dressing,

826
00:50:42.141 --> 00:50:44.270
I swear to God you don't know the misery.

827
00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:48.560
But what ends up happening is you get used to it and I swear to God,

828
00:50:48.561 --> 00:50:52.400
the onions and the tomatoes,
maybe a carrot in there,

829
00:50:52.401 --> 00:50:53.440
whatever the fuck you happened at,

830
00:50:53.441 --> 00:50:57.830
that becomes the dressing and you actually get excited to eat a tomato.

831
00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.040
You know,
it's funny,

832
00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:07.720
I don't think I sold that as much as I made people run to go eat more fucking
me,

833
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:09.820
but whatever.
I'm going to try it out because I'm,

834
00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:13.040
because I hate working out.

835
00:51:13.041 --> 00:51:16.550
I got to go down and I got to go try and work off one eighth of what the fuck I

836
00:51:16.551 --> 00:51:20.720
did to my body at the Lsu game.
God Damn.
And I was upset after that game.

837
00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:26.370
What happened?
I actually did the dumbest thing I could ever do.

838
00:51:26.371 --> 00:51:29.640
I actually have another fucking team that I'm now going to live and die for.

839
00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:34.500
So what are the odds they're going to win the championship every year?
Crl.

840
00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:38.920
So every fucking year there's going to be some level of disappointment,
you know,

841
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:42.950
I don't know.
They won the citrus bowl.
I guess that's kind of good.
All right,

842
00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:47.030
next one.
Um,
ear.
We go gay son,
Bill.

843
00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:51.440
My son just left for college this year and when I was cleaning out his room,

844
00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:54.650
I found several notes from he and his best friend from high school.

845
00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:58.400
These two were together all the time and are rooming together right now in

846
00:51:58.401 --> 00:52:03.320
colleges,
colleges and college.
God,
I'm fucking,
it's pathetic.

847
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:08.630
Uh,
the notes I found were from,
from one another on special occasions,

848
00:52:08.631 --> 00:52:12.170
like Christmas,
all of them said essentially the same thing.

849
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:14.270
I know nobody can know,

850
00:52:14.271 --> 00:52:18.820
but our love is real and we can express ourselves better in college.
Oh.

851
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:22.460
JJC.
Here we go.
Here we go.

852
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:27.380
They go on to talk about their nights in hotels and how their girlfriends never

853
00:52:27.381 --> 00:52:28.550
knew they were gay.

854
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:33.340
My son talks about how we can never tell me because I,

855
00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:37.550
he thinks I will disown him.
Oh my God.
Are the hiccups coming back?

856
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:39.800
Is this story exciting me,

857
00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:44.490
Bill?
I don't know what to do.

858
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:48.830
I haven't told anyone and I'm not mad at him or anything and don't care that he

859
00:52:48.831 --> 00:52:53.670
is gay,
but I want to know if I should tell him I know his secret.

860
00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:58.350
Jesus,
why don't you guys ask me these questions like,
I'm qualified.

861
00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:03.020
I'm not qualified to answer this,
but this is what I would do.
First of all,

862
00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:06.210
the fact that you know,
you're not going to judge him and you won't disown him.

863
00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:11.940
His biggest fear is,
is just that it's only a fear.
So that's,

864
00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:16.950
that's a good thing.
So I don't have any kids,
but I know that.

865
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.890
<v 4>Okay.</v>

866
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:21.650
<v 0>Then if my son had some giant fear,</v>

867
00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:25.090
I would want to,

868
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:29.340
if I could in any way alleviate that stress from his life,

869
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:34.620
I would.
Um,
I would,
so I would just,

870
00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:37.980
I would,
I dunno,
I would sit down with them and I would just say,
look,

871
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:44.460
okay,
tell him you love him.
And all that stuff.
So he chills and say,

872
00:53:44.461 --> 00:53:46.440
you know,
whatever you said,
you know,
it was cleaning out your room.

873
00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:49.890
I found these notes.
I mean,
I don't know how this is,

874
00:53:49.891 --> 00:53:52.290
you almost want to ask you gotta ask somebody gay about this.

875
00:53:52.291 --> 00:53:55.680
Cause I dunno if this is going to be like,
if it's up to him,

876
00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:01.360
you don't want to shock the kid.
But,
uh,
I would think that I,

877
00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:02.253
I would think,

878
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:04.420
<v 1>okay.</v>

879
00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:07.510
<v 0>And just say you're not going to disown them.
You're not mad at him or whatever.</v>

880
00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:10.570
I,
I,
I would think,
and I'm not qualified.

881
00:54:10.571 --> 00:54:14.050
I would think once he got over the shock of Holy Fuck,
my biggest fear in life,

882
00:54:14.051 --> 00:54:18.730
my dad found out
once he finds out you're not fucking mad.

883
00:54:18.731 --> 00:54:20.410
You give him a hug and then just say,
listen,

884
00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:24.730
and I'm not going to fucking tell anybody.
You know what?
Just hurt me.

885
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:26.800
It made me feel sad that you,

886
00:54:26.801 --> 00:54:30.160
that you were thinking that I would be like that with you.
I'm not you,
my son.

887
00:54:30.161 --> 00:54:34.240
I love you.
That's it.
You know,
I would just do it like that and then just say,

888
00:54:34.241 --> 00:54:36.130
I'm not going to say anything about your friend.

889
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:40.900
I'm not going to say anything to young mother.
Uh,
you know.

890
00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:45.100
Well,
that probably puts you in a situation with the,
I don't fucking know.

891
00:54:45.101 --> 00:54:49.030
I don't know how to go beyond that,
but that's,
that's what I would do.
All right.

892
00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:53.160
Once again,
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
So there you go.
That's,

893
00:54:53.161 --> 00:54:55.690
that's what I would do.
Okay.
Good luck to you sir.

894
00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:57.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

895
00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:59.910
<v 0>Okay.
Moving on.
Book recommendation,</v>

896
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:06.000
eat to live.
Live to fly.
Sorry.
Um,
Bill,

897
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:10.620
I hope all is well with you.
Well,
I hope all is well with you too,
sir.
Or ma'am.

898
00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:13.460
Hermaphrodite um,

899
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:17.640
I just wanted to say that I enjoy listening to your podcast early in the morning

900
00:55:17.641 --> 00:55:21.510
while I practice guitar before work or even better while I'm wasting time on my

901
00:55:21.511 --> 00:55:25.590
cubicle.
How do you practice guitar listening to this shit?
Um,
anyway,

902
00:55:25.591 --> 00:55:30.480
I heard you mentioned in the past that you're a fan of body weight exercise.
Yes,

903
00:55:30.481 --> 00:55:33.150
I am.
I'm not sure if you heard of Ross.

904
00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:35.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

905
00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:39.830
<v 0>I can't read that word,
and a mate,
e,
n,
a m,
a I t,</v>

906
00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:44.560
but he has an Xbox or in physical trainer who lives in Massachusetts.
He put,

907
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:49.670
he put a great book out called Never Jim Wallace a few years back and I'd been

908
00:55:49.761 --> 00:55:54.170
using it on a daily basis to keep in shape.
Ross is a bare knuckle,

909
00:55:54.171 --> 00:55:55.550
no bullshit kind of guy.

910
00:55:55.551 --> 00:55:58.520
I think you'll enjoy the book if you're into using your own body weight to keep

911
00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:02.040
in shape.
I am in no way affiliated with Ross.
We'll,

912
00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:05.870
I'll believe it because you just told me you weren't,
um,
or anything like that.

913
00:56:05.871 --> 00:56:08.360
I just want to let you know that I enjoy your work and thought you might be

914
00:56:08.361 --> 00:56:12.500
interested in this book.
Yeah,
I'll check it out.
Never.
Jim was,

915
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:18.430
let's oddly comforting the gym will always be there and those times when you

916
00:56:18.981 --> 00:56:23.860
can't work out.
Those were the times when I carried you movie recommendation.

917
00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:28.820
Bill,
you got to see wreck it.
Ralph.
It made me laugh and cry.
Oh Geez.

918
00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:34.140
I didn't laugh when I suck Cosby and I didn't cry when my relatives died.

919
00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:38.820
Oh,
you didn't laugh when you went to see bill Cosby.

920
00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:41.380
He didn't cry when your relatives die,
but wreck it.
Ralph.

921
00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:45.300
I think I saw some of that.
I think I saw,

922
00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.990
I think I saw something about that.
Which is that one.

923
00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:54.220
There's one out there that looks like a pixelated angry me that's coming out.

924
00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:59.080
Uh,
I dunno.
Anyways,
overrated.
Underrated,

925
00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.071
underrated.

926
00:57:00.071 --> 00:57:05.071
Being from a pro sports town and flying to New Orleans and experiencing a

927
00:57:06.461 --> 00:57:10.240
college football game between two SCC rivals.
I'm telling you,

928
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:15.820
put it on your bucket list.
Alright,
go buy your wife some shoes.

929
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:19.960
There you go.
Sweetie.
These are for you and these two tickets to me.

930
00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:23.470
Go Fuck Yourself.
I'll see you in three days.

931
00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:30.040
And by the way,
if you get,
if you get hiccups and you want to cure them,

932
00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:32.110
they got all these different cures and all that.

933
00:57:32.111 --> 00:57:35.530
The biggest thing is just don't eat like an asshole and drink like an asshole

934
00:57:35.531 --> 00:57:39.220
like I did.
Oh by the way,
by the way,

935
00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:44.200
this time tomorrow,
we have the big election here in the states.

936
00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:47.710
I don't know if you heard about it.
People out there and Sydney,

937
00:57:47.711 --> 00:57:51.910
Australia and Melbourne.
Melbourne.
Is that how you say it?
Melbourne,

938
00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:57.240
Perth.
Oslow hell Siki all these fucking places I go to now.

939
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:59.320
I don't know if you guys heard about it.
I'm sure it's all over.

940
00:57:59.321 --> 00:58:03.070
Your fucking blows me away that you guys give us shit considering I can't name

941
00:58:03.071 --> 00:58:07.140
any of your guys other than Tony Blair.
And the reason why I know Tony Blair's,

942
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:11.340
he's got such a fucking great show.
Biz Name.
Ladies and gentlemen,

943
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:15.210
keep it going for that mother fucker.
I told him dad,

944
00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:16.803
you know,

945
00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:21.100
he almost needs a black dude to bring them up that name so smooth.

946
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:26.200
Keep it going for Tony.
Um,

947
00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:29.710
anyways,
uh,
so what do you think?

948
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:34.880
Who you're calling Paul Versey is dying?

949
00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:40.500
He wants he,
he's Romney all fucking day.
He wants Romney.
I know.

950
00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:43.720
Juanita.
I don't even know who I'm going to vote for this time.

951
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:49.120
I don't even fucking know.
I have no fucking clue.
I don't give a shit.

952
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:49.541
It's not,

953
00:58:49.541 --> 00:58:54.100
it doesn't matter if they're both going to roughly do the same fucking thing

954
00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:58.090
because the same people got money on both fucking gang.

955
00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:04.780
Um,
I dunno,
I dunno what I'm going to do,
but uh,

956
00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:11.280
<v 4>I've had it.
I just just</v>

957
00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:14.790
<v 0>think people are so fucking stupid and that's coming from me who can't even read</v>

958
00:59:14.791 --> 00:59:18.930
out loud 44 years of age.
I just think people like,

959
00:59:20.370 --> 00:59:24.800
I just don't how they process information,
you know what I mean?

960
00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.670
The way they,
they,
they look at Shit,

961
00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:32.390
they never connect one presidency to another.

962
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:36.560
It's like people can't like whatever's going on,
they're like,
Oh,
who's an office?

963
00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:38.810
Oh,
it's his fault.
You know,

964
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.380
they don't keep seeing like the same problems keep getting fucking worse and

965
00:59:42.381 --> 00:59:43.700
worse and worse.
I just don't,

966
00:59:43.701 --> 00:59:47.060
I just don't believe that the president could fucking do anything.

967
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:51.260
Well they can do.
He's like Mark Sanchez.
He just has to try and manage the game.

968
00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:55.010
Don't throw a pick mark.
Don't draw a pic.
That's basically all he could do.

969
00:59:56.210 --> 01:00:00.350
You know?
Other than that,
yeah,

970
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:03.470
I are you going to tell how are you going to turn this country around?

971
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:08.030
Like corporations is so fucking powerful that they're beyond the borders of this

972
01:00:08.031 --> 01:00:08.811
country.
Like,

973
01:00:08.811 --> 01:00:12.590
you know what I thought was really fucked up and is literally treasonous

974
01:00:12.591 --> 01:00:17.591
activity is like all those people out there dealing with a hurricane Susan,

975
01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:24.230
Sally,
I,
for some reason I just cannot remember the fucking name of the,

976
01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:27.440
that Goddamn hurricane,
that shit where everybody

977
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.990
<v 1>okay</v>

978
01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:33.990
<v 0>is lining up to get gas and all of a sudden gas becomes like five 99 a gallon to</v>

979
01:00:34.061 --> 01:00:37.300
do that to your fellow countryman when they're involved.

980
01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:42.460
And that type of situation to raise the price of food,
to do all that,

981
01:00:42.461 --> 01:00:44.890
to make money off of people's misery like that.

982
01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:46.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

983
01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:48.840
<v 0>I was kidding who.
That's page one of capitalism.
But I,</v>

984
01:00:48.841 --> 01:00:51.070
I personally that that's just,
it's treasonists.

985
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

986
01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.380
<v 0>You should be,
if anything,
you should try to be keeping the prices steady.</v>

987
01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:59.070
You should be or,
or,
or try to drop them.

988
01:00:59.071 --> 01:01:01.680
If you can fucking help people out,

989
01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:07.500
the fucking coming up to you with their pockets inside out to shoes that don't

990
01:01:07.501 --> 01:01:10.800
even fucking match and you're going to try and get an extra fucking $2 a gallon

991
01:01:10.801 --> 01:01:13.860
off of him or whatever.
I,
I just that that isn't right.

992
01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:17.610
And a fucking right.
Not My America.

993
01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:19.323
<v 3>Uh,</v>

994
01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.020
<v 0>anyways,
that's a podcast for this week.</v>

995
01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:26.690
I felt oddly comfortable doing this with my headphones on,

996
01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.690
even though I couldn't hear myself.
You know what it is.
If you put them on,

997
01:01:29.691 --> 01:01:32.090
I can still hear my voice in my head,
which makes me feel good.

998
01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.980
It's soothing to me.
All right,
so here's the deal.
Um,

999
01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:37.730
I got one more road gig this year.

1000
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:41.270
I'm going to be at the University of Southern Connecticut on November 17th.

1001
01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.060
It is open to the public.
So you get you,

1002
01:01:44.061 --> 01:01:46.850
and I'm just saying that I don't even know if that's true,

1003
01:01:46.851 --> 01:01:49.310
but I think it's true considering people emailing me about it,

1004
01:01:49.311 --> 01:01:51.800
saying if I'm going to tone it down by the love of God,

1005
01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:54.110
get some Goddamn a delta in that crowd.

1006
01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:57.680
<v 3>All right.
Um,</v>

1007
01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.790
<v 0>but then I think that's it then all the rest of my gigs.
What do I got?</v>

1008
01:02:01.791 --> 01:02:02.940
I got Bray it.
That's it.

1009
01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:08.130
I only got his brain a left and another fucking year has gone by.

1010
01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.900
Can you believe it?
All right,
well,
that's the podcast for this week.
As always,

1011
01:02:12.901 --> 01:02:16.860
people.
Um,
if you'd like to support this podcast,

1012
01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:21.890
go to a m and go to [inaudible] com click on the podcast page and click on the

1013
01:02:23.071 --> 01:02:26.200
link to amazon.com and uh,

1014
01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:30.960
all she gotta do is go buy something.

1015
01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:32.580
You don't have to do it if you want to.

1016
01:02:32.581 --> 01:02:34.770
And then Amazon doesn't cost you any extra money.

1017
01:02:34.771 --> 01:02:38.250
Amazon then just kicks me a little bit of money and then I'd take a portion of

1018
01:02:38.251 --> 01:02:42.360
the,
and I take a portion of any ad money that I'd make on this and I,
uh,

1019
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:44.310
I sent it to the wounded warriors project.

1020
01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:48.620
So you'd be supporting me and supporting the troops.
And you know what?

1021
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:53.460
Look what I just did that I just did what all these corporations that do it now

1022
01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:57.690
where they try and align themselves with some sort of,

1023
01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.333
you know,

1024
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.330
some sort of cause that there's no way you're not going to be against it.

1025
01:03:03.331 --> 01:03:07.710
Like that whole breast cancer thing.
Like he's seen the five hour energy,

1026
01:03:07.711 --> 01:03:08.850
the little pink ones,

1027
01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:13.620
and every time you buy a pink five hour energy liquid cocaine,

1028
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:19.190
we will give a portion of the proceeds to finding a cure for breast cancer.

1029
01:03:19.591 --> 01:03:23.580
Now,
the key there is a portion of the proceeds.

1030
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:26.910
What do you think that pro portion is?

1031
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:32.220
I heard with a certain credit card company,
it was one penny for every charge,

1032
01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:33.810
regardless of how big it was.

1033
01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.420
So people that doing that shit,

1034
01:03:39.421 --> 01:03:43.530
can you really get mad that they're raising gas price of gas during the,

1035
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:44.970
during the fucking hurricane?

1036
01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.673
<v 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1037
01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:52.540
<v 0>I'll tell you wouldn't do something like that.
Ari should fair Arice your fair.</v>

1038
01:03:52.541 --> 01:03:56.260
Would you ever go to his march page?
You see the quality that he has on that?

1039
01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.860
I've been in this business long enough to know how much having all those extra

1040
01:03:59.861 --> 01:04:03.490
colors in your tee shirt or on the cover,
you CD a DVD,

1041
01:04:03.491 --> 01:04:07.030
how much that's gonna cost you.
And he says,
fuck that.

1042
01:04:07.031 --> 01:04:11.980
I am an artistic vision of PLA.
Irish affair would not raise gas prices.

1043
01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:16.220
And because of that,
you should go,
uh,
go.

1044
01:04:16.221 --> 01:04:18.980
You should go to all things comedy and you should listen to his podcast,

1045
01:04:18.981 --> 01:04:22.670
the septic tank,
the skeptic tank,
septic from such a fucking idiot,

1046
01:04:22.671 --> 01:04:26.210
the skeptic tank.
And I'm actually going to try to get on,
uh,
get on his show.

1047
01:04:26.890 --> 01:04:30.560
And that's it.
So that's it.
People,
he didn't believe me the first time.

1048
01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:34.730
I said it twice.
That is fucking it.
That's the podcast for this week.

1049
01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:35.960
Go fuck yourselves.

1050
01:04:35.961 --> 01:04:39.860
Thank you to everybody who came out to the show here at Harrison New Orleans.

1051
01:04:39.861 --> 01:04:43.820
This is going to be a regular stop for me on the tour and I'm always going to be

1052
01:04:43.821 --> 01:04:45.920
coming through during football season next year.

1053
01:04:45.921 --> 01:04:50.921
I'm going to try to do a Lsu and go to a a hornets game while I'm out here.

1054
01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:55.130
Check that one off the list.
But tonight,
saints,
Eagles,

1055
01:04:55.820 --> 01:05:00.820
and I'm gonna Laugh my ass off watching these polite southerners,

1056
01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:04.700
polite southern southerners,
who knows?
You know,

1057
01:05:04.701 --> 01:05:07.160
you always got to wonder if one of them's in the clan,
but whatever.

1058
01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:12.220
I'll outwardly polite fans dealing with dealing with these fucking eagles fans.

1059
01:05:12.371 --> 01:05:16.340
And what's funny is I actually think the saints are going to win because every

1060
01:05:16.341 --> 01:05:18.220
time I go an athletic event

1061
01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:24.210
and it's against a Philly team,
even if I was for the Philly team,

1062
01:05:24.211 --> 01:05:28.980
cause I love the flyers.
Their fans is so fucking obnoxious.
By the end of it,

1063
01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:30.690
I'm rooting for them to loose.

1064
01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:32.713
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1065
