00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.481
Hey,

2
00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:06.470
what's going on is bill burn is time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.690
September 10th,
2018 how's it going?

4
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:17.130
How I yeah.
Oh,
why?
Yeah.
Um,

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.820
I am back from a whirlwind tour.
I the fucking crazy weekend.

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.710
I'm actually sitting here a podcasting in front of the TV,

7
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:27.900
which I know a lot of you don't like.

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.510
Simply the fucking Steelers in browns had a tie.

9
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.230
Wow.
Jesus Christ one that,

10
00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:40.850
this exact reason why you don't like it.

11
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.760
This is the exact fucking reason cause I get distracted.

12
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.040
I haven't seen a fucking tie since.
Like they've had overtime.
I don't know.

13
00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:49.280
I don't recall one.

14
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.380
<v 0>Okay.</v>

15
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.741
<v 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:56.741
zero zero and one of the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cleveland browns.

17
00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:02.240
How about that?
Um,
anyways,
yeah,
I'm sitting here.

18
00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:04.100
I've got the Red Sox game on in the background.

19
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.060
The Houston Astros are trying to become the second team this season to sweep the

20
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:10.190
red sox.
Well,

21
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.500
Boston is trying to go two for two today against the city of Houston.

22
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.680
All right,
now we are already done.
Kicked the shit out.
You fucking football team.

23
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.430
Now we're trying with your baseball team.
I'll be honest with you.
Uh,

24
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.960
I thought the Patriots looked good for the first two and a half quarters.
Um,

25
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.080
special teams is letting up more yards than I would like.

26
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.090
Then you would like bill you as a what a football coach.
You as a comedian,

27
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.141
a shit joke.

28
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:43.550
Talon fucking jackass who decided to fucking record a game and fast forward

29
00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:48.410
through the commercials.
Yeah.
Bill,
what did you see on your game film?
Um,

30
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.970
fair enough.
Fair enough.
You know,
there's always room for criticism.

31
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.310
Who am I to sit here and act like I'm above it?
Um,

32
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.230
yeah,
I thought I was very impressed with our pass rush.

33
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.150
I was very impressed with our ability to,
uh,
contain,
uh,
what's his name?

34
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:11.060
Watson there.
I thought he was going to be a nightmare.

35
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.750
I also thought he might've been a little gun shy about running because he is

36
00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:18.830
coming back from a knee injury.
So I thought when he,
he ran when he had to,

37
00:02:18.831 --> 00:02:23.570
but I was impressed with him staying in the pocket.
Um,
I liked,
uh,

38
00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:26.630
the new,
uh,
left guard we got there.
I left tackle,

39
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:30.710
I should say taking old for Nate soldier,
soldier,
I'll be you say his name.

40
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.480
He's the only there for fucking 20 years now he's playing with the giants.
Um,

41
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.931
Brown,

42
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:40.931
whoever that guy was just keeping all those beasts up front for of the Texas

43
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.410
where they get clowny.

44
00:02:42.411 --> 00:02:46.910
They got JJ watts and then they got some other guy like maniac or something like

45
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:48.470
that.
Like his name is literally like,

46
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.030
it's like psycho or maniac or something like that.
I'm not a nickname.

47
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.390
<v 0>Okay.</v>

48
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.930
<v 1>The name he was born with as a baby.
Oh,
look at that little cute baby.</v>

49
00:02:57.931 --> 00:03:02.790
What's its name?
Clarence Maniac.
You want to have a play date?
Uh,

50
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.500
no I don't.
Why am I fucking headphones?

51
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.850
Fucking God damn these fucking cheap ass fucking things.

52
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:11.920
I swear to God,
I just can't win.

53
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.590
<v 0>Okay.</v>

54
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.850
<v 1>CanNot fucking win.
What is going on now?
This is all brand new shit.</v>

55
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.930
I got all brand new shit.
Hear people.
Speaking of which,
if you want to fucking,

56
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.720
if you want to,
a couple of things.
I'm selling.
I just bought a new mixer.

57
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.610
Uh,
my old one works fine,

58
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:33.430
but I'm getting back to doing these uninformed with Joe to Rosa,

59
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.990
which is going to be up on my patrion page coming up here in November.

60
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:39.340
We're going to tape some episodes,

61
00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:42.070
get a little in the can and that type of shit and some other stuff.

62
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.370
So I had to get a mixture where I could actually have enough microphones for

63
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:46.360
more than two people.

64
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.840
So I have a mixer with the chords and all of that shit.
Uh,

65
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.900
if you want to start your own podcast,

66
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.100
do you want to open up your little podcast shop across the street and compete

67
00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:00.610
with me?
Uh,
let me know.
I'll figure it out.

68
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:03.400
Cause I already started Dean del Rey cell and some shit.

69
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:06.260
I got a drum kit that I'm selling.
All right.

70
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.470
I'll get all the information.
I'll have it posted on my fucking Twitter site.
Um,

71
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.990
I'm selling this,
uh,
one of those sonar,
like travel kits.
You know,

72
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.730
it's kind of like the,
uh,
Questlove one.
The,
the,
what is it?
Uh,

73
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.150
whatever that one that he does with the little fucking 18 inch bass drum.

74
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:29.980
It's the same thing,
but to sona.
Um,
and fucking beautiful.

75
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:32.860
I just don't have the room for it anymore.
I got a,

76
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.620
I made a little drum room in my,
uh,

77
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.180
garage so I don't have to have a studio space for my drum set.

78
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.190
And I brought the big boy kit home and I got that little one,

79
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:47.140
which fucking sounds great by the way.
And I also have the,
uh,
the,

80
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.300
the fucking pads there where it's silent,
you know what I mean?
Where it doesn't,

81
00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:57.280
it doesn't,
uh,
you know,
the Mesh ones or the real ones.
I got it tuned up.

82
00:04:57.281 --> 00:05:00.250
Nice.
My buddy tuned it up,
I should say,
um,

83
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:04.540
after I kind of fucked it up a little bit,
but um,
whatever,

84
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.160
that's what it's come down to people.
This is the new me.
Okay.
I'm getting,
yeah,

85
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.920
British shit.
And right now you know what?
My whole fucking day,

86
00:05:12.921 --> 00:05:15.800
my headphones out working right now.
I have no fucking idea if you can,
I'm,

87
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.780
all I'm doing is just looking at the fucking mixture.

88
00:05:17.781 --> 00:05:20.840
I know that you can hear me.
I haven't been able to,
I fucking came home.

89
00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:25.670
I went to watch the fucking patriots game.
Uh,
my wife Angel,

90
00:05:25.671 --> 00:05:29.110
that she is taped the game for me and then I'm sitting there watching it and it,

91
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.440
the thing just like,
it starts fucking up.
Then I've got to hit pause.

92
00:05:33.441 --> 00:05:35.480
I gotta shut it off.
I've got to turn it back on.

93
00:05:35.481 --> 00:05:38.060
It was doing like one of those fucking things and it started off.

94
00:05:38.061 --> 00:05:42.020
It was doing it every couple of minutes then once a minute.
Oh fuck you.

95
00:05:42.021 --> 00:05:45.620
You can't fall ball.
Fall Ball.

96
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.720
Is that fair or foul
father.
Alright,

97
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.010
sorry.
Um,
it's two to one red socks by the way.
It has

98
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.540
<v 2>throws her up.
You just hit one down by the Pesky Pole.
It went foul.</v>

99
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.693
<v 0>MMM.</v>

100
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.273
<v 2>Anyways,</v>

101
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.090
so then it started doing it like every 30 seconds and it was like every eight

102
00:06:10.091 --> 00:06:14.170
fucking seconds and I was loving watching the game.
Tony Roma,

103
00:06:14.171 --> 00:06:17.680
I'm calling it right now,
Tony Romo.
If he fucking keeps doing this shit,

104
00:06:17.681 --> 00:06:19.900
he's going to be a hall of fame broadcaster.

105
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.810
I have never learned more shit

106
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.080
about football,
I don't think.

107
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:29.450
Maybe since I'm going back maybe to like John Madden.

108
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.280
<v 0>Okay.</v>

109
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.240
<v 2>The way that guys breaking down all of this stuff and has always been all these</v>

110
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:39.080
coaches and all this shit tried to do it somehow.
The Way Tony Romo does it,

111
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.660
it's like you get it.
He does it in real time.

112
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.723
<v 0>MMM.</v>

113
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.430
<v 2>It's fucking amazing.
So I was enjoying that.
So you know how the world works out?</v>

114
00:06:48.431 --> 00:06:51.310
What are you enjoying something?
Well,
let's fuck up the recording of it.

115
00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:54.670
So that's what ended up happening.
And um,

116
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.800
you know what it's funny about my fucking headphones is if I sit up and I'm

117
00:06:59.801 --> 00:07:04.210
uncomfortable,
they work perfect.
But if I lean back and I'm comfortable,

118
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.320
I swear to God,
dude,
I don't,
I don't know what the fuck I think I did.

119
00:07:08.321 --> 00:07:11.470
I kill Tesla and another fucking life.
Is that what I did?

120
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.210
And this is my fucking punishment.

121
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.530
This is literally all brand new shit.

122
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.190
I swear to God.
I don't know what the fuck I did.

123
00:07:23.191 --> 00:07:26.430
I kick Edison and the balls during a previous level.

124
00:07:26.431 --> 00:07:31.210
He's a fucking thief anyways.
Right?
I swear to God,

125
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:39.000
unbelievable.
And this is the shit,
right?
My wife never flips out about shit.

126
00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:39.571
Like does she know why?

127
00:07:39.571 --> 00:07:42.450
Cause it never happens to her cause she buys new shit and it works.

128
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:47.540
My wife will like lose her cell phone and grand central station and then I'll

129
00:07:47.851 --> 00:07:52.520
call it and they'll just be some guy.
Yeah.
Yes I have it.
No,

130
00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:57.150
no.
I'll bring it to you.
Right?
I lose my cell phone.
That's fucking it.

131
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.740
Over cold case file.
No leads,
no nothing.

132
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.790
That fucker is gone.
All right,
so it's better over here.

133
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.190
Little better over here.
A little better.

134
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.670
Now this fucking thing is hanging off here.
This whole fucking podcast.

135
00:08:12.671 --> 00:08:15.580
It's just gonna be me bitching about this fucking wire that I just bought.

136
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.120
Now it's off.
Now it's off.
Now it's on.
Oh,
I see.

137
00:08:19.121 --> 00:08:21.760
What happens when there's a little bit of weight and it's hanging down.

138
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:22.840
All can't handle that.

139
00:08:22.841 --> 00:08:26.050
Can you can't fucking handle a little bit of fucking weight.
Is that what it is?

140
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.550
I just figured what it out.
What it is.
Oh,
we got a quitter here.
Everybody.

141
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.950
We got a little fucking snowflake.

142
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.060
Let's just move the whole fucking table for you buddy.
Yep.

143
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.600
Everybody gets a fucking ribbon.
Oh,

144
00:08:40.601 --> 00:08:42.840
my mixer just fell off the fucking table.
This whole,

145
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.900
this is just going off the rails here.

146
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.890
Why do I try to make my life easier?
It,
it doesn't work up.
So I uh,

147
00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:56.150
can

148
00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:00.230
<v 1>I lean back,
can get in the old man,
put his fucking back up against the couch.</v>

149
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:06.350
Hello,
test.
Oh,
there we go.
There we go.
All right,
so I'm back.

150
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:08.580
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

151
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.310
<v 1>Well you just demo.
What'd you just saw there?</v>

152
00:09:10.311 --> 00:09:13.740
It was why my wife is sick of living with me and,
oh,

153
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.770
everything's a fucking conspiracy theory with me.

154
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.120
I really wish when those sort of challenging moments and in the first world

155
00:09:21.121 --> 00:09:23.550
country as a blue eyed white male,

156
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:26.320
that was actually a challenging moment for me as people are,

157
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:31.140
are like literally fleeing war torn fucking countries.
Haven't,

158
00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:32.880
God knows what done to them.
Right?

159
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.740
If there is a god and he's looking down right now and he hears all this

160
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:40.950
screaming and yelling and shit about stuff that's going on

161
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.440
and he finds out what's this?

162
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.430
What's this poor soul screaming about right after he looks at the horrors of war

163
00:09:49.431 --> 00:09:54.431
and he's going to just see some bald 50 year old fucking moron doing a podcast

164
00:09:55.341 --> 00:09:58.250
by himself yelling about a microphone cord.

165
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.460
He's just going to look down and it is a heat,
by the way.
All right.

166
00:10:04.461 --> 00:10:07.430
Fuck all this feminist shit where now they're turning everything around,

167
00:10:07.431 --> 00:10:08.264
you know?

168
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.153
<v 0>Okay,</v>

169
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.170
<v 1>fuck this.
You know,
there's gotta be something that has to still be a guy,
right?</v>

170
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:14.190
Why Not God,

171
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.240
Oh,
why do I love being an asshole?
I just,
I enjoy it.
I'm sorry.
I do.
All right.

172
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:30.640
He's going to be looking down.
It'd be like,
Oh,
who is that?
I made that.
All right.

173
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.500
Do me a favor when,
when he passes yet give them the,
uh,

174
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.870
tones to take the down escalator.

175
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:39.993
<v 3>MMM.</v>

176
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.600
<v 1>I don't know where I'm going to go when I die.
You know,</v>

177
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:46.310
you can even think about that shit.
I watched that Mr. Rogers,
uh,

178
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.160
won't you be my neighbor?
Did you fucking see that

179
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.900
you guys watched that thing?
Whatever you call it,
their documentary.

180
00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.970
I have never felt like such a piece of shit in my life.
F after watching that.

181
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.770
He's definitely fucking weird though man.
He is so fucking weird.

182
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.780
You know,
it says the guy by himself losing his shit,
talking into a microphone.

183
00:11:15.781 --> 00:11:18.780
I had the nerve to say this guy's weird,
but um,

184
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.590
I I yeah,
take it easy.

185
00:11:24.591 --> 00:11:29.480
End of the getting gunned down.
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.150
Anyways,
I a,
I watched that documentary and uh,
Fred Rogers.

187
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.250
<v 3>Mmm Mike.</v>

188
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:42.540
<v 1>I said if this,
if,
if there is a god and Christians are right</v>

189
00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:47.650
and got his son without having sex with a virgin.

190
00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:53.220
<v 3>MMM Jesus.</v>

191
00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.230
<v 1>I mean,
just</v>

192
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.660
<v 0>how do you even say it out loud and still believe it,</v>

193
00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:03.660
<v 1>man.
It's just clearly written by guys who don't want sloppy seconds,</v>

194
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.170
you know?
So then they got to have to have like that.
Like she's a virgin.

195
00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:12.270
No one ever banged her before so she doesn't know what good sex is.

196
00:12:12.271 --> 00:12:15.210
She doesn't know what a big Dick is.
Now I could feel comfortable

197
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.680
to mount this person.
I mean,
is that,
is that it?

198
00:12:18.681 --> 00:12:22.730
Was that the underlying theme of all of that?
Huh?
Oh,
hey,
look at that.

199
00:12:22.731 --> 00:12:27.290
That's sort of a feminist look at it,
isn't it?
I Dunno what it is.

200
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.130
Feel about now.
I'm sorry.

201
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.320
My apologies to everybody.

202
00:12:33.321 --> 00:12:37.490
South of a fucking Washington DC Mason Dixon lamb there.

203
00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.570
Do you guys know the first,
you know the Gettysburg address?
Yeah.

204
00:12:41.571 --> 00:12:45.380
I had no fucking idea where that was in the first fucking battle of the civil

205
00:12:45.381 --> 00:12:49.910
war.
I thought it was like,
you know,
somewhere in the SCC.

206
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:51.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

207
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:55.950
<v 1>They weren't big 10 country.
They weren't fucking Pennsylvania.</v>

208
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.830
I had no idea.
We never would get that far.

209
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.890
We always start with those fucking three ships.
The Nina,
the Pinta,

210
00:13:03.891 --> 00:13:07.740
the Santa Maria,
they came.
Oh,
they,
somehow they came over after a,

211
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:09.610
<v 0>okay.</v>

212
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:13.910
<v 1>Columbus,
right.
Columbus came over to like,</v>

213
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.670
I dunno,
like Cuba.
Well,
The Bahamas,
Haiti,

214
00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:23.380
he was down around there.
Right.
And then the Nina,
the Pinta,
the Santa Maria,

215
00:13:23.381 --> 00:13:27.340
they all came over together.
Right.
Sort of the first carnival cruise.

216
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.510
It's kind of like that without,
you know,
a workout,

217
00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:36.010
Roman and scurvy and shit like that.
Right.
Big Belt Buckles.

218
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.400
It must have no credible neck muscles back then.
Huh?

219
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.860
A big fucking hat with that belt on there.

220
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:47.880
Looking down at your soggy fucking boots,
bringing your head back up.
Um,

221
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.370
<v 0>okay.</v>

222
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.900
<v 1>Anyways,
they were all trap easy.</v>

223
00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.950
The coach used to come off slide right off their fucking nonexistent shoulders.

224
00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:56.211
So anyways,

225
00:13:56.211 --> 00:14:00.050
we would start with that shit and then we would maybe get to the war of 1812

226
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.630
never fucked with the civil war as far as where I went to school.

227
00:14:05.631 --> 00:14:09.220
We never fucked with it.
It was just our country fighting each other.
Why,

228
00:14:09.221 --> 00:14:10.970
why would that be of interest to anybody?

229
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:12.893
<v 0>You know,</v>

230
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.410
<v 1>maybe that was just northern as being cool,
you know,</v>

231
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:21.010
not talking shit after winning.
We don't need to teach them that we won.
Right.

232
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.540
But down south they were always talking about probably saying that we cheated,

233
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:27.190
you know,
like people hate the Patriots.

234
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.650
Say we underinflated are fucking cannon balls or whatever the fuck they going to

235
00:14:31.651 --> 00:14:35.140
say,
you know?
Um,

236
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:41.050
anyways,
let me,
uh,
somebody just sent me a text at Aaron Rodgers get hurt.

237
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:42.660
<v 0>Okay,</v>

238
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.670
<v 1>please tell me I fucking hate when that happens.</v>

239
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:46.040
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

240
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.150
<v 1>Roger is done.
He grabbed that knee so fast.
It's bad.
Oh No.</v>

241
00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:56.810
Oh Jesus Christ.
I fucking hate you.

242
00:14:56.811 --> 00:14:58.550
And because it's just,
there's nothing worse than that.

243
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:00.643
<v 0>You know what I mean?</v>

244
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.050
<v 1>And I gotta tell you something.</v>

245
00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:06.500
If you're a vikings fan or a bears fan and your psych that that happens,

246
00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:08.810
you're a fucking asshole.
You know,

247
00:15:08.811 --> 00:15:12.380
I never wrote it for Derek Jeter to get hurt or any of that shit.
You want to,

248
00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:16.680
you want to play in when the,
when you want to beat him with that best.
Um,

249
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.660
wow.
Does that change the NFC?

250
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.230
My buddy who actually knows something about football was,

251
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:28.790
was picking them to go to the super bowl.
Wow.

252
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:32.360
You know what that reminds me?
I remember that year when the jets were favored,

253
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.140
it was like the first game of the season test to verde,
you know,

254
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:37.820
blew out his Achilles

255
00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.090
<v 0>and,
uh,</v>

256
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:46.850
<v 1>who cried?
It wasn't terrellowens.
It was,
uh,
the guy from USC.</v>

257
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.770
Oh Jesus Christ.
Just give me the damn ball.

258
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:54.663
<v 0>Okay.</v>

259
00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.400
<v 1>When did wide the wide receiver position become the diva position?</v>

260
00:15:58.401 --> 00:16:00.080
He used to always be the quarterback.

261
00:16:00.081 --> 00:16:03.650
He was the guy always walking around with the big and slated fucking ego.

262
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.680
And somewhere in the last like 15,
20 years,

263
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:11.560
like all the emotional meltdowns come from the guys who like catch the balls,

264
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.890
you know,
that was my quarterback.

265
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:18.460
<v 0>Okay.</v>

266
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.010
<v 1>Um,
just give me the Damn Paul.</v>

267
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.100
Ah,
Jesus Christ.
Anyways,
um,

268
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:31.320
so I worked up in Thunder Valley,
[inaudible] Valley fucking California.

269
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:36.600
Um,
the,
the farthest north.
I have been in Sacramento.

270
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.900
All right.
I was a,

271
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.310
I landed in Sacramento was a 30 minute drive.
And this guy,

272
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.970
fortunately he took like the back roads,
which is really cool.

273
00:16:48.971 --> 00:16:52.750
So we went by all these,
these farms and uh,

274
00:16:52.751 --> 00:16:55.300
I actually for the first time saw an almond tree.

275
00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:00.610
I thought nuts came from the ground,
you know,

276
00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:02.620
because I always,
you know,
I was going to baseball.

277
00:17:02.621 --> 00:17:03.700
Whenever we go to a baseball game,

278
00:17:03.701 --> 00:17:06.880
they give you the ones that they feed to the elephants.
What was it like?

279
00:17:06.881 --> 00:17:10.420
The fucking,
you know,
the Budweiser of peanuts.

280
00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.650
Almonds is sort of like the blue moon.
You get a little more fucking crafty beer.

281
00:17:14.651 --> 00:17:19.600
Kind of snobby.
Right?
But they're there.
Those,
those elephant was,

282
00:17:19.601 --> 00:17:21.190
they always seem like they're dirty.

283
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.700
Take me out to the ball game.

284
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.610
I didn't know that nuts came on trees.

285
00:17:27.611 --> 00:17:30.250
I'm probably making an ass of myself right now either.
They all do.

286
00:17:30.251 --> 00:17:32.080
Well that's the one that does or whatever.

287
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.970
But I know there's a lot of you right now just racing to look up this

288
00:17:36.971 --> 00:17:39.280
information so then he could tell me how dumb I am.

289
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:43.090
Or maybe you fucking know that.
You know,

290
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:47.460
you don't know how to grow one.
You don't know when to pick it.

291
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.410
You just know where it comes from.
Right.
Um,
Chanel was a numb.

292
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.310
The biggest asshole ever is,
is that what happened?
No.
Bill,

293
00:17:55.311 --> 00:17:58.520
you're the biggest asshole ever because you just had a meltdown about a fucking

294
00:17:58.521 --> 00:18:02.090
wire.
Fair enough.
Fair enough.

295
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.950
Jesus Christ,
the Buccaneers and saints 48 to 40.

296
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.220
I got to tell you before it's all said and done.
I,

297
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.960
I drew Brees is going to throw for more fucking everything than anybody,

298
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.750
unless Tom Brady keeps playing.

299
00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:20.570
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

300
00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:24.770
<v 1>Cause I don't think drew Brees is doing that.
Uh,
drew versus time.</v>

301
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.980
Tom Brady versus time like that shit.
Like today.
They were actually,

302
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:33.290
they said he was the oldest quarterback to throw a touchdown in the first game

303
00:18:33.291 --> 00:18:37.220
of the year.
Other than George Blanda.

304
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:44.710
Who's the Gordy fucking how of of football as far as how long he played and,

305
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.310
and Warren Moon.

306
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:47.720
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

307
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.440
<v 1>Who I didn't,
I didn't know he played that late.
I know he's,</v>

308
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.020
he spent most out at least half his career up in the CFL.

309
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.930
Maybe that's why he didn't seem like he was at old because by the time he came

310
00:18:56.931 --> 00:19:01.720
in the league,
it was already like eight years in the CFL.
Um,

311
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:09.570
anyways,
uh,
why do I have the fucking TV on?
Why do I give a shit?

312
00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.140
Should I hit pause?
Let me hit pause.
You know,
at the end of the day,

313
00:19:14.141 --> 00:19:17.080
I have a job here to do and it's the God damn it.
It's to make you,
people laugh.

314
00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.100
Well,
you know what?
It's a new TV and I don't know how to do it.
Is this do it?

315
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.760
Oh my God,
it did it.
I hit the pause button and it paused.

316
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.000
<v 0>Fuck that.
I'm hitting play.</v>

317
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.690
<v 1>I still have that thing.</v>

318
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.140
You remember the old days when you pause your flat screen and then it's just

319
00:19:32.141 --> 00:19:36.610
burned in there?
Whatever the fuck you were looking at.
Um,

320
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.640
all right,
let me look the other way.
Okay.
So I,
I watched,
uh,

321
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:45.220
won't you be my neighbor?
And then I also watched,
uh,
Chappaquiddick

322
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.800
you got to check both.
Both those movies out were incredible and,
uh,

323
00:19:50.801 --> 00:19:53.620
any on me stay on track here.
So we took the,
uh,

324
00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:59.340
the back roads up to this casino,
what their thunder bay,

325
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.620
nothing to be sorry.
Thunder Valley.

326
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.570
<v 0>And,
uh,
you know,</v>

327
00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:08.610
<v 1>every once in a while I'll actually watch the news and whenever I watched the</v>

328
00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:09.444
news,

329
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:13.650
it always puts me into a panic and makes me feel like I should live in the

330
00:20:13.651 --> 00:20:17.040
middle of nowhere next to a lake with a bunch of guns.

331
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.833
<v 0>You know?</v>

332
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:23.620
<v 1>And I know there's a lot of people in the cities probably think that stuff.
Okay,</v>

333
00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:24.580
well here's the deal.

334
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.020
The only way to live in the middle of nowhere is if you grew up in the middle of

335
00:20:29.021 --> 00:20:32.020
nowhere,
cause then you know how to live out there.
Right?

336
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.120
You came from a family that

337
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.720
<v 0>okay,</v>

338
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.170
<v 1>taught you how to hunt and all of that shit.
You know what I mean?</v>

339
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:40.670
I'm too fucking old for that.

340
00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.590
I got to go the snake Pliska skin route and try to stay in,

341
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.160
<v 2>in a fit of fucking city.</v>

342
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:52.623
<v 0>You know,</v>

343
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.970
<v 2>I think I'm going to join the people that live underground in the sewers cause</v>

344
00:20:57.971 --> 00:21:02.180
it's going to be so fucking hot.
You know the red heads,
all US redheads,

345
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.690
we're going to end up on the ground and we're going to be coming up like a bunch

346
00:21:04.691 --> 00:21:06.070
of filthy Malakai's.

347
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.600
So you guys better sharpen your fucking swords or whatever the hell you're going

348
00:21:10.601 --> 00:21:13.870
to have.
Once you run out of bullets,
that's going to be the thing.

349
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:18.490
When you run out of fucking bullets,
then it'll be swords.

350
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.140
It just clubs and it's good.
It's going to become fucking Braveheart,

351
00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.470
you know?
But not if we were all like Fred Rogers.

352
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.270
He'd be just sitting there in the middle of it.

353
00:21:33.271 --> 00:21:38.271
It's such a good feeling to know you're alive and when you crawl up Otto that

354
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:45.510
manhole,
I would appreciate it if you,

355
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.390
what the fuck just happened?

356
00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.570
He got all of that one.

357
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:57.770
How did it go from to all the here?
Three run fucking homer.

358
00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.290
I don't even know who did it.

359
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.193
<v 0>I missed it.</v>

360
00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:09.670
<v 2>Very nice.
That's right.
Houston.</v>

361
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.730
How does it feel to be old Chitlin people do that shit.
Um,

362
00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:20.650
the big story here is that the Houston Astros are going to take two out of
three,

363
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.150
which this is a series.
Now,

364
00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:26.950
this is one of these ones that I pay attention to because we're going to run

365
00:22:26.951 --> 00:22:31.930
into these.
Some bitches
come October,
so I want to see how we match up my,

366
00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.990
granted Chris Sale's not in there.
I don't know if price pitched,

367
00:22:34.991 --> 00:22:36.760
I don't even know what the fuck's going on.
So anyways,

368
00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.990
we get up there to thunder valley and it is literally a fucking casino just

369
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.530
surrounded by farmland and the Gig.

370
00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.450
It's this giant stage just like out in the parking lot.

371
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.810
And if nobody's covered right,
if there was any sort of rain,

372
00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.770
I was joking like everybody would just fucking leave and I would be

373
00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:02.050
contractually obligated to do an hour in front of a bunch of plastic wet folding

374
00:23:02.051 --> 00:23:02.770
chairs.

375
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:06.880
But I gotta tell you he was one of my favorite gigs I've had in a long time was

376
00:23:06.881 --> 00:23:09.520
amazing.
The Sky was beautiful.

377
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:13.630
The only thing that was weird was like when motorcycles would go buy a head to

378
00:23:13.631 --> 00:23:14.920
like stop doing my act.

379
00:23:14.921 --> 00:23:19.600
Like I was only getting like heckled by those things that was joking about how

380
00:23:19.601 --> 00:23:23.560
those people up there,
they probably don't wear helmets.
You know what I mean?

381
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.300
Anytime you have a problem,
you just drive off until a bunch of snow peas,

382
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.060
those things are probably nice and soft,
slow you down.
Um,

383
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:38.100
and then after that I woke up the next morning at like something ridiculous.

384
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.110
I want to say it was a

385
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.640
4:00 AM four and then I had to get on a 6:00 AM flight,

386
00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:50.860
something like that.
I can't even fucking remember.

387
00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:56.680
Slide is salt lake city and from Salt Lake City go to Toronto for tiff.

388
00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:02.250
The Toronto International Film Festival is All freckles is in a movie called the

389
00:24:02.801 --> 00:24:07.801
front runner directed by a Jason Reitman starring a Hugh Jackman.

390
00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.770
And I just,

391
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:13.223
<v 0>uh,</v>

392
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.440
<v 2>I saw it for the first time anyways,
let me tell you the whole fucking story.</v>

393
00:24:17.441 --> 00:24:22.370
So I,
one of my favorite things I've seen in an airport

394
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:28.580
standing in line,
right,
trying to find something healthy,
but she,

395
00:24:28.581 --> 00:24:32.660
you can't really do.
And uh,
this guy in front of me,

396
00:24:32.661 --> 00:24:36.950
he orders two bagels and he goes,
can you put butter on it?

397
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.170
Can you put,
I just want to bagels with butter on it.

398
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:40.850
And he's like already on his tip toes,

399
00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:43.370
like over the counter and he's tall enough to see over the counter.

400
00:24:43.371 --> 00:24:44.204
So I was like,
what?

401
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:48.080
He's one of these fucking guys like when you prepare his food,

402
00:24:48.081 --> 00:24:52.010
he has all these fucking instructions and he's on his tip toes watching you do

403
00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:53.900
it and immediately I'm just like,

404
00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:59.050
God bless the fucking woman or man romantically linked to this fucking lunatic,

405
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.673
<v 0>right?</v>

406
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:07.650
<v 2>So he's on,
he's on his tip toes that Yankee flows.</v>

407
00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:11.040
He's on his fucking tip toes watching this lady.

408
00:25:11.041 --> 00:25:14.550
She sticks it in the little fucking conveyor belt piece of shit,

409
00:25:14.551 --> 00:25:18.120
toaster and it comes out.
She's putting it to,
he's got good.

410
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.460
Can you put cake with the butter on it ma'am?
Could you just put the punch?

411
00:25:20.461 --> 00:25:23.760
She goes,
what?
She goes,
can can,
can you put the butter on it?
She goes,
yeah,

412
00:25:23.761 --> 00:25:26.100
she goes to butters over there and he goes,
no,

413
00:25:26.101 --> 00:25:28.800
I was just hoping that you could put butter on it while it's still hot so to

414
00:25:28.801 --> 00:25:30.930
like melts.
Can you do that?

415
00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.990
Could you just put butter on it while it's still hot and then close it up?

416
00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.300
Can you do that for me?
She just looks at him and goes,
no,

417
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:44.230
just handed on the bag.
Now I know.
I've always made fun of that.

418
00:25:44.231 --> 00:25:47.850
I hate those fucking places where all of a sudden you've got to finish making

419
00:25:47.851 --> 00:25:49.920
the sandwich like you work there for free.

420
00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.590
But just the way she just told the guy no,

421
00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:56.280
and he was already annoying me the way he was up on his fucking tip toes

422
00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.340
like,
Gee,
what?
What the fuck?
You didn't order like a,

423
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:04.830
I'm trying to think of something fancy.
You all did a fucking Bagel.

424
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.480
She's going to toast the thing.
She's going to stick it in a bag.

425
00:26:09.481 --> 00:26:11.850
You're going to pay for it.
Then you're going to go over to the condiments.

426
00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:15.870
Try to find something that wasn't sneezed on.
You know how it's going down.

427
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:17.660
<v 0>Okay.</v>

428
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:21.830
<v 2>So I laughed and she looked at me and gave me like half a smile.
She's like,</v>

429
00:26:21.831 --> 00:26:25.160
what do you want?
I'm just like,
I'll take one of those ham and cheese sandwiches.

430
00:26:25.161 --> 00:26:26.300
You know?
You know what the only thing,

431
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:28.423
<v 0>mmm.</v>

432
00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.910
<v 2>Oh,
that was great.
Watching that guy gets shut down.
I don't know why.</v>

433
00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.210
It's like you,
you see a little spoiled fucking Brat kid crying,
you know,

434
00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:37.820
cause he wants something.

435
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:42.950
Is there anything better watching a parent not cave and then the kid doesn't get

436
00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.230
it.
I find I live

437
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:46.210
<v 1>for that moment.
He,</v>

438
00:26:46.211 --> 00:26:50.170
when the kid cries and cries and cries and then the parents end up just giving

439
00:26:50.171 --> 00:26:51.004
it to them.

440
00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:54.030
<v 0>Okay.</v>

441
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:57.990
<v 1>I was mixed.
We just want to like trip him.
Isn't that stupid?
I don't,
obviously,</v>

442
00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:02.880
I'm just saying,
you know something I do think about.
I'm not proud of it.

443
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.770
We all have our flaws occasionally.
Yes,
I see,

444
00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:14.030
I see.
I see.
A kid gets stopped and after crying and uh,

445
00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:18.650
makes you want to triple and it's stupid because the kid doesn't have the

446
00:27:18.651 --> 00:27:21.500
emotional maturity to express himself.

447
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:23.723
<v 0>Right.</v>

448
00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:27.150
<v 1>What,
how Fred Rogers would have handled that if he didn't want them to have it.</v>

449
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.170
Why are you crying?

450
00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:37.850
Well,
you can't have all my God,
what a fucking moron.
This,

451
00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.920
this fuck God blessed it.
There's a woman there,

452
00:27:39.921 --> 00:27:43.330
she's wearing a Houston Astros fan.
She's wearing like one of those,
you know,

453
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:45.550
they'd make the number one finger out.

454
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:49.490
She's got a giant Orange Astros' hat.

455
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.070
Like to the point you're blocking people's view behind you.

456
00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.760
Those are the things.

457
00:27:56.510 --> 00:28:00.290
It's because of hats like that and people like that that where am at games.

458
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:05.320
That's one of the reasons why like things like flame throwers are not legal to

459
00:28:05.361 --> 00:28:10.100
the general public because that's the kind of thing when you sit there for nine

460
00:28:10.101 --> 00:28:14.300
fucking innings.
Alright.
And that's self centered,
can't,

461
00:28:14.301 --> 00:28:18.080
won't take the fucking thing off.
That's one of the things,
if you had like a,
a,

462
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.070
a handheld,
well not seen,
you'd burn her up,

463
00:28:22.071 --> 00:28:26.780
but you'd like the hat on fire and God knows what that's made out of and it

464
00:28:26.781 --> 00:28:27.614
might,
you know,

465
00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.890
touch somebody else's fucking hat and then they're on fire and you're like,

466
00:28:30.891 --> 00:28:35.270
but no,
no,
no.
I just wanted to set her on fire.
I'm sorry sir,
my bed,

467
00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:40.250
my bed.
Would you like me to drive you to the burn unit?
No.

468
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.990
Most of your ear is still attached.

469
00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:43.843
<v 0>MMM.</v>

470
00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:45.261
<v 1>Anyway,</v>

471
00:28:45.261 --> 00:28:50.261
so then I flew up to Canada and I checked like 9 million times that I had my

472
00:28:50.861 --> 00:28:52.990
passport because that's one of the things I always,
you know,

473
00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.930
the first half of my career,
you could just go to Canada,

474
00:28:55.931 --> 00:28:59.650
like you were going to your friend's house.
He didn't need a passport,
you know,

475
00:28:59.651 --> 00:29:00.910
and then after nine,
11,

476
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:04.663
<v 4>shit,</v>

477
00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:11.030
<v 1>don't even say nine 11,
that horrific event</v>

478
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:17.750
in,
uh,
ever since then you've got to have you fucking passport to go everywhere.

479
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.030
So,
uh,

480
00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:21.610
<v 0>yeah,</v>

481
00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:25.090
<v 1>I checked like fucking nine out of times,
make sure I had my passport.
Um,</v>

482
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:31.440
and I went through the customs and everything and I think I got there at like

483
00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:34.950
four o'clock and then like the pickup was like at five 15.

484
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.890
So by the time I got through customs and all of that shit ordered room service

485
00:29:39.891 --> 00:29:40.461
and everything,

486
00:29:40.461 --> 00:29:45.461
like I had time to iron my stupid shirt and then I went over there and I did the

487
00:29:45.561 --> 00:29:48.830
whole,
uh,
you know,

488
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:52.790
the whole red carpet got asks great questions.

489
00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:56.210
Nobody tried to corner me.
You know,
there was a couple of,

490
00:29:56.211 --> 00:29:58.530
how would you relate this movie to a,

491
00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:02.900
what's it going on today in the current political climate?
You know,
it was fine.

492
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:07.010
There was no,
uh,
wait,
what do you think about this guy going back on stage?

493
00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:09.920
I already knew what I was going to say.
Well,
what do you think about it?

494
00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:17.240
That's all I ever do.
If you ask me one of those and your career questions,

495
00:30:17.241 --> 00:30:21.860
I just throw it right back at you.
What do you think about it?
No,
I'm asking you.

496
00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.500
Well,
I didn't ask the question.
You're the one who has the question.

497
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:27.950
You're the one thinking about it.
What do you think about it?
I want to hear it.

498
00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:31.850
I want to you put a quote on it.
What do you think about it?

499
00:30:31.851 --> 00:30:35.180
There they have fucking,
uh,
Jimmy Olsen.

500
00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.810
So then we,
uh,
I went into the,
uh,

501
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:44.240
this beautiful theater and sat down and watched the movie and I gotta tell you,

502
00:30:44.241 --> 00:30:48.770
man,
it's pretty fucking incredible.
Uh,
Jason Reitman killed it.

503
00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:53.750
Uh,
it's called the front runner and I would not be,
I don't want to Jinx Nda.

504
00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:56.810
I'm not going to jinx nothing,
but I would not be surprised.

505
00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:02.240
I'll go real.
I'm going to really
go low here.

506
00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:06.950
That if it performs very well,
that's,
that's as much shit as I'm going to talk.

507
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.570
Um,
but it's a phenomenal,
phenomenal movie.

508
00:31:11.571 --> 00:31:15.320
And the way the whole thing was cut together,
the way they told the story.

509
00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:19.730
And uh,
it's really,
really fascinating.
It's about the,
uh,

510
00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.630
the Gary Hart story,
which a for you youngsters out there.

511
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:27.980
He was a guy running for president in 1988 and yes,

512
00:31:27.981 --> 00:31:31.250
he was the front runner.
Great Looking Guy.

513
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:36.140
Guys like them ladies loved them.
Full head of hair,

514
00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.860
you know,
that's the kind of shit that gets you elected.
Right?

515
00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:45.950
Play the saxophone on our city.
Oh,
Hall.
Two terms,

516
00:31:45.951 --> 00:31:49.340
not one,
two terms.
Ah,
Shit.

517
00:31:49.341 --> 00:31:52.790
Did they just hit a fucking home run guy that was a monster shot five to,

518
00:31:52.791 --> 00:31:57.350
to the Astros?
No.
Quit numb.
You know why?

519
00:31:57.351 --> 00:32:00.560
Cause they're champions.
Um,

520
00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:07.080
oh man,
that's that fucking guy.
What is his name?

521
00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:12.140
That's the guy.
Last year,
the world series.
It was incredible.
You know,

522
00:32:12.141 --> 00:32:15.080
the dude that I was Al today,
right?

523
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:21.860
That guy,
that guy's worth every dime.
You pay him.
You know what else I like?

524
00:32:21.861 --> 00:32:26.300
I like that guy in the infield for the Texas Rangers,
total winner.

525
00:32:26.301 --> 00:32:30.920
The guy will punch that dude in the face.
Um,
credible ballplayer,

526
00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:35.450
man,
that's going to be a shame watching the red sox or Yankees by him,

527
00:32:35.451 --> 00:32:38.150
away from the Rangers.
Although back in the day,

528
00:32:38.151 --> 00:32:42.320
the Rangers spent all money on a Rod,
right?
220 million bucks.
So they got money.

529
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:47.210
That's Texas,
man.
You sitting on all that fucking oil.

530
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:52.670
Why don't you take some of that money,
put it on your team.

531
00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:58.120
Um,
anyway,
so I got there when,

532
00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:01.950
thank God every,
like the,
uh,
I got there on time and I got to see movies.

533
00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.760
Phenomenal.
Everybody in it is so fucking good.
I'm not going to lie to you.

534
00:33:06.761 --> 00:33:10.900
I had my head down whenever here my boys put my head down.
But,
uh,

535
00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:12.790
you know,
I watched,

536
00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:17.740
I actually watched most of my seats and I wasn't cringing too badly.
So I think,

537
00:33:17.741 --> 00:33:21.910
uh,
I think I did all right in it.
Uh,
but I want to thank everybody for,
uh,

538
00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.160
everyone I worked with and given me the opportunity to be in it.

539
00:33:27.161 --> 00:33:30.160
But I think it's going to be a great one.
So guys,
could you do me a favor?

540
00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.040
I know you're all streaming shit.

541
00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:38.400
I know you got your fucking virtual reality glasses with the laser disc players.

542
00:33:38.531 --> 00:33:42.250
Whatever the fuck he kids are doing nowadays.
Could you just go old school?

543
00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:43.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

544
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:48.260
<v 1>Just go to the movies when it comes up.
Just go see this thing.
All right.</v>

545
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.280
Do it for me.
Do it for me.

546
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:57.240
So one day I can afford to buy speaker wires that actually are microphone wires

547
00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:01.430
that actually work.
Okay.
It's for a cost.
This is a startup.

548
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:07.100
I think it comes out November.
Um,
go see it.
You will not be disappointed there.

549
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.890
That's it.
All right,
plowing ahead.
I'll look at a rod,

550
00:34:09.891 --> 00:34:14.000
a rods in the fucking box deck.
There's another guy,
another guy,

551
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:16.420
Tony Romo and Alex Rodriguez.
I say,

552
00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:21.200
oh well they're the two best former athletes turned broadcasters in a long

553
00:34:21.201 --> 00:34:22.034
goddamn time.

554
00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.800
It's unreal how when a rod was a player and,

555
00:34:27.801 --> 00:34:30.790
and the New York media would be asking them all those questions.
He,

556
00:34:30.791 --> 00:34:33.610
he get like tongue tied.
You get them in the booth.

557
00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:40.360
He's just the seas.
Effortless.
Fucking effortless.

558
00:34:40.361 --> 00:34:43.210
All right.
Speaking of effortless,
not effortless,
I should say.

559
00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.320
I got to do some reads here for the week and I forgot to turn the God damn light

560
00:34:47.321 --> 00:34:48.154
on

561
00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:53.710
some ways is such a good feeling.

562
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.690
So now you can read.
Ah,

563
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:04.220
Jesus.
So anyways,
and then this morning I had a 6:00 AM

564
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:09.560
6:00 AM flight.
What was awesome,
there was nobody like in Toronto,

565
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:14.240
I've gotten some of the worst traffic other than La and Chicago and some of

566
00:35:14.241 --> 00:35:17.450
those other fucking places.
Toronto is just brutal traffic.

567
00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:19.100
And I woke up this morning and there was nothing,

568
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.870
nobody out there on a Sunday morning.
And uh,

569
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:27.020
went right through customs,
thing of beauty.

570
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:32.240
And then I went to go buy some fucking Cuban cigars there and their prices were

571
00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:36.860
out fucking rages,
dude.

572
00:35:36.861 --> 00:35:39.540
I was looking at,
I was looking
at a box of them.

573
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:43.050
They want to like 500 to 60 bucks.
It's like,
dude,
I can get these things in.

574
00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:47.100
I don't,
people in la got these things not paying all that money.

575
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.410
So in a bind like these,
these,
these little ones about like five,

576
00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.180
I mean what the Hell you call it?
Oh Shit.
Now they're fucking hitting us.

577
00:35:57.110 --> 00:36:01.400
Now they hit somebody else.
How many outs here?
So top of the six a game.

578
00:36:01.401 --> 00:36:04.520
You guys already know the results of its five to two.

579
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:08.900
This has never been good other than the fact that one time when the guy ran the

580
00:36:08.901 --> 00:36:10.010
ball back to win the game,

581
00:36:10.011 --> 00:36:13.640
that was the only time this was a good move to have the fucking game on.
Um,

582
00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.430
all right,
let me read some of the,

586
00:36:24.011 --> 00:36:28.090
people have been asking me for advice.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:29.800

620
00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:27.310
You know what I realized is that I bought this,
this fucking microphone,

621
00:38:27.311 --> 00:38:28.660
wire headphones,
Shit,

622
00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:31.600
all this stuff and it's so heavy that it was hanging off the table.

623

That's why everything actually works.
Once again,

624
00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:40.860
I fucking flip out and there it was a simple solution and there was no reason to

625
00:38:41.771 --> 00:38:44.170
have a meltdown.
I do it all the time.
Okay,

626
00:38:44.171 --> 00:38:47.080
so now they got fucking two guys on base.
Nobody out.

627
00:38:47.081 --> 00:38:49.390
We got to write in a lefty warming up in the bullpen.

628
00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:53.720
This is why the Astros won it last year.

629
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:58.400
You cannot put these guys to bed.
Can't talk him in.

630
00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:03.710
All right.
Policy genius.
September is national life insurance awareness month.

631
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:07.640
Most people aren't aware of that.
In fact,
most people aren't aware they need,

632
00:39:07.641 --> 00:39:09.980
well,
most people,
I'm fucking away.
The light turned green,

633
00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.280
too busy staring at the God damn phones.
In fact,

634
00:39:13.281 --> 00:39:16.010
most people aren't aware they need life insurance at all.

635
00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:20.330
That's why 40% of people don't have it.
Well,

636
00:39:20.331 --> 00:39:23.900
I mean it's not that they're not aware of which a lot of it is guys and we don't

637
00:39:23.901 --> 00:39:28.220
like dealing with their mortality.
Um,
but I've,
I did it.

638
00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.040
I have my affairs in order and I cannot tell you as,

639
00:39:31.041 --> 00:39:36.041
as a husband and a father knowing that when I Croak,

640
00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:40.040
everybody that I love in my family is going to be okay.

641
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:45.320
It's great.
Then you can have like a happy funeral.
You know,

642
00:39:45.321 --> 00:39:49.520
people show up and brand new,
uh,
black clothing

643
00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.820
anyways,
but getting life insurance doesn't need to be difficult or expensive.

644
00:39:55.821 --> 00:39:58.850
Right now prices are the lowest they've been in 20 years.

645
00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:00.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

646
00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.071
<v 1>Why is that?</v>

647
00:40:01.071 --> 00:40:04.790
Is it because people are living longer and policy genius has made it easier than

648
00:40:04.791 --> 00:40:05.690
ever to get covered?

649
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:10.400
Policy Genius has helped over 4 million people shopped for insurance and placed

650
00:40:10.401 --> 00:40:15.200
over $20 billion in coverage and they don't just make life insurance easy.

651
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:19.190
They also compare disability insurance,
renter's insurance,
and health insurance.

652
00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:20.900
If you care about it,
they cover it.

653
00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:24.740
So if you're looking for a good reason to buy life insurance,
here's three.

654
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:28.700
It's national life insurance awareness month.
That's not a good reason.

655
00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:30.400
<v 0>Okay?</v>

656
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.100
<v 1>Okay.
It could be national ghetto hooker month doesn't mean you should go do it.</v>

657
00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:37.270
Right?
So that one's out.
Prices are at a 20 year low.
That's a good one.

658
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:42.010
And policy genius makes it easy to get the right policy for you.

659
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:44.860
Wait,
they said there was three reasons.

660
00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:50.380
National Life Insurance awareness month prices are at a 20 year low.

661
00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:54.700
Oh and then is policy genius makes it easy to get the right policy for you.

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:28.510
<v 1>Do you know what I really miss?
I miss football cards.</v>

705
00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:32.950
That's how I knew who everybody was in the league.
I fucking,
yeah,

706
00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.120
<v 2>miss those things.</v>

707
00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:38.770
And what happens was all those fucking baseball cards in the 1950s,

708
00:43:38.771 --> 00:43:42.310
all the Mickey Mantle rookie cards and all that shit blew up.

709
00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.670
And where with all that money.
So by the time I became an adult,

710
00:43:45.671 --> 00:43:48.850
so many adults were collecting cards.
Kids didn't give a shit about it.

711
00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.820
And then I'm,
I try collecting football cards again and they,

712
00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.700
they would like deliberately make some of them rare.

713
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:57.880
You couldn't just go out and go buy a whole sec cause that's what people were

714
00:43:57.881 --> 00:44:01.630
doing and then they weren't fucking worth anything.
Let me see.
Tops.

715
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:03.140
<v 0>Okay,</v>

716
00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:08.130
<v 2>let me see.
They still have these things.
Football car,</v>

717
00:44:08.131 --> 00:44:08.964
Duh.

718
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:11.343
<v 0>Okay.</v>

719
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:15.470
<v 2>Uh,
2018,
2018.</v>

720
00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.910
What do you got here buddy?
Will my internet work?
You know what?

721
00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.920
I don't even care if it does or it does or doesn't.

722
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:23.720
I'm not going to flip out about it.
How about that?

723
00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:30.890
Just relax bill.
Just count to 10 slowly.
What?
You know what I,
I got a,

724
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:36.060
I got a master going for a walk the other day.
I got into with my wife,

725
00:44:36.061 --> 00:44:40.440
right.
And,
and I,
I started to walk away but I didn't leave,

726
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:42.683
<v 0>you know.</v>

727
00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:49.110
<v 2>All right.
Shop tops,
football cards,
2018 football cards.
Release dates.</v>

728
00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:50.430
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

729
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:51.850
<v 2>All right,
let's see what they got here.</v>

730
00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.510
It's such a good feeling.

731
00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:00.460
I used to just sit there and like I wouldn't study in school and I would just

732
00:45:00.461 --> 00:45:02.080
look at football cards and I would read,

733
00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:05.200
I would look at the picture and I would just read them over and over and over

734
00:45:05.201 --> 00:45:09.190
again.
It didn't realize it was like flashcards.
And by the end of it,

735
00:45:09.191 --> 00:45:10.750
I knew everybody in the league.

736
00:45:10.751 --> 00:45:13.180
I knew where they went to cook cause I would watch it every year.

737
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:14.950
I get the cards every year.

738
00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.160
And there was all these guys that I already knew shit about and there was only

739
00:45:18.161 --> 00:45:21.350
so many new rookies.
And uh,

740
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:26.120
I remember he used to blow my dad's mind.
I was like,
and he went to college.

741
00:45:26.121 --> 00:45:30.200
It'd be,
can't stay
Louie couches.

742
00:45:30.201 --> 00:45:34.020
See as a size 16,
quadruple east a clique.

743
00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:38.760
You like Jesus Christ.
How do you know all of this stuff bill,
while dad,

744
00:45:38.761 --> 00:45:40.020
cause I'm not studying

745
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:45.590
all that effort that I should have put in to my studies.

746
00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:51.260
So I could've gone to a,
to a,
to a big time college,
you know,

747
00:45:51.261 --> 00:45:53.480
and he joined a Frat,
walked around,
you know,

748
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:57.530
maybe join the glee club or whatever.
I've had an acapella group,

749
00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:01.940
you know,
met some women,

750
00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:08.620
get me two fucking years later.
I just missed out on it.

751
00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:13.030
Um,
when the fuck is this thing gonna load.

752
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:17.150
All right.
You know,
I'm just,
I'm just going to start read some questions.

753
00:46:17.151 --> 00:46:19.430
Maybe there's at some point I don't,
I know for the life of me,

754
00:46:19.431 --> 00:46:23.240
I don't know how much money I have to pay these internet guys to get something

755
00:46:23.241 --> 00:46:24.074
that works.
You know,
I was,

756
00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:28.400
I started to talk about this where a buddy of mine had a,

757
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:30.940
you know,
he solved this Internet prom buddy.

758
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:35.180
They got these things called like mesh or something like that where it ties the

759
00:46:35.181 --> 00:46:37.850
Internet signal from one party house to another.

760
00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:40.940
And that just seems like you are in

761
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:46.670
the Tsa Line for fucking brain cancer.
Like it's bad enough.
We've got all these,

762
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:49.760
did this,
it can't be good.
I don't know what it is,

763
00:46:49.761 --> 00:46:52.070
but there's something going on you.
We've all done it.

764
00:46:52.071 --> 00:46:55.520
We've all talked on a cell phone long enough that like the society of fucking

765
00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:59.150
one side he head starts feeling weird.
You know what I mean?

766
00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.520
I used to a bit about that.
So then you talk with the cell phone,

767
00:47:01.521 --> 00:47:04.160
the other side of your head sort of sear it like a fucking tuna steak.

768
00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.900
It's just your brain.
All right.
Eastern European tour.
Hello Bill.

769
00:47:08.901 --> 00:47:10.130
I am writing from Croatia.

770
00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:13.790
I like to ask you if you are still coming to this part of the world.

771
00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.700
My part of the world,
not yours.
Just kidding.
Yes I am.

772
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:19.190
We're just working it out because a,

773
00:47:19.191 --> 00:47:21.830
the dates came in and I was going to be gone for too long.

774
00:47:21.831 --> 00:47:25.700
I have a kid so I'm trying to break it up into two different tours.

775
00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:30.640
Do a week to 10 days and then come back a few months later and do another week

776
00:47:30.641 --> 00:47:34.960
to 10 days.
10 10 days,
10 days,
10 days.
So that's what I'm trying to do.

777
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:36.063
Okay.

778
00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:37.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

779
00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:41.900
<v 2>I promise you it is going to happen.
All right.
Outdoor venues.</v>

780
00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:44.390
Uh,
why did one this weekend?
So I am ready.

781
00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:49.130
I'm ready for this question dear Billy.
Operation Northwoods.
Look it up.

782
00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:53.120
All right,
well my internet work.
Sure.
I would love to look it up.

783
00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:59.350
It's still loading.
All right.
Um,

784
00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:02.790
thanks for the killer show in the casino parking lot.
Oh,

785
00:48:02.791 --> 00:48:05.520
thank you for showing up.
Anyways,
he said,

786
00:48:05.521 --> 00:48:08.040
I've heard you mention a guy named La head before,

787
00:48:08.041 --> 00:48:10.890
but I never knew shit about him.
Fucking hilarious guy.
Yeah.

788
00:48:10.891 --> 00:48:13.650
J Law had Jay lie.
Come on man.

789
00:48:13.651 --> 00:48:16.980
That guy a fucking kills it on the grill too.

790
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:18.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

791
00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:21.610
<v 2>Follow him on Instagram.
You see that guy when that guy starts cooking,</v>

792
00:48:21.611 --> 00:48:24.610
it's fucking crazy.
It's like a cooking show.
Uh,

793
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.540
how come he's not on Netflix or seesaw?

794
00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:31.190
I think it's Cecil or whatever the fuck you guys do.
Anyways.

795
00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:35.170
Wondering if the parking lot is up there in the weirdest outdoor venues.

796
00:48:35.171 --> 00:48:39.130
You've played at a,
all right.
Why is it j on Netflix?

797
00:48:39.131 --> 00:48:42.640
Well or CSO went out of business.

798
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.650
What else is there?
Hulu,
Amazon and all that.
Well,

799
00:48:46.651 --> 00:48:48.960
eventually it happens for everybody.
Everybody,
you know,

800
00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:52.500
takes people different amount of time.
You know,
look,

801
00:48:52.501 --> 00:48:57.501
I started in 1992 and it took me until either 2005 or 2006 to get on Letterman.

802
00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:06.410
And I went through a couple of bookers a couple of days was just like yeah I

803
00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:09.810
don't like you.
Right.
You got a weird,
we get a weird look as one that I got.

804
00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:14.690
Well I don't think that was in the letter of people but um,
yeah,

805
00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.441
you know it was hilarious.

806
00:49:15.441 --> 00:49:19.160
I remember years later seeing this other generations of comedians and they were

807
00:49:19.161 --> 00:49:22.910
like bitching about the book booking process and they will like seven years in.

808
00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:28.450
It's just like,
well hey fucking buck up buddy.
It's going to take you another A.

809
00:49:28.451 --> 00:49:29.284
Yeah.

810
00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:31.663
<v 0>I don't know.</v>

811
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:33.720
<v 2>That's not how it works is that our works nowadays.</v>

812
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:36.390
Cause now there's social media cause now you fucking complaint and then

813
00:49:36.391 --> 00:49:38.610
everybody's afraid to get in trouble and nobody,
nobody just goes like,

814
00:49:38.611 --> 00:49:40.530
hey you don't have,
fuck you.
Oh Shit.

815
00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:43.483
<v 0>Fuck</v>

816
00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:47.160
<v 2>that's a run scored two run score</v>

817
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:51.110
to run school.
All my God,

818
00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:56.170
these fucking Houston Astros are relentless.
Look at them.

819
00:49:56.171 --> 00:49:57.340
They're all up there.

820
00:49:58.050 --> 00:49:58.450
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

821
00:49:58.450 --> 00:50:02.380
<v 2>Top of the dog.
This is impressive.
This is what we've been doing,</v>

822
00:50:02.381 --> 00:50:06.460
the teams all year and now they're coming in giving us the old right there,
Fred.

823
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:09.903
<v 0>Fuck.</v>

824
00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:13.080
<v 2>I already know what this saying with the sound dial.</v>

825
00:50:13.081 --> 00:50:16.890
That ball got up there in the zone.
I mean that thing you want that much lower.

826
00:50:16.891 --> 00:50:20.880
This is like,
that's right in his wheelhouse and he jumped all over it.
His eyes,

827
00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:25.510
they opened up like a kid on Christmas.
Uh,

828
00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:28.700
fuck me.
Um,
anyways,

829
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:33.190
I love that you guys know that the result of this Houston chance.

830
00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:37.590
So I was talking all that shit like we're gonna whip y'all fucking cities as

831
00:50:37.591 --> 00:50:38.424
today.

832
00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:39.673
<v 3>MMM.</v>

833
00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:42.030
<v 2>If there is a sports god,</v>

834
00:50:42.031 --> 00:50:45.960
just because that woman is wearing that giant stupid fucking hat in,

835
00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:48.780
in a visitor's stadium,
you know?

836
00:50:48.781 --> 00:50:51.810
I mean just how many times can you just ask to get your fucking ass kicked

837
00:50:51.811 --> 00:50:52.710
before it happens?

838
00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:54.773
<v 3>MMM.</v>

839
00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:59.330
<v 2>Anyways,
yeah.
So people like,
yeah.
Then started whining about,</v>

840
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:03.800
I dunno how long it takes or whatever,
and then I guess it shorten up.

841
00:51:03.801 --> 00:51:07.910
It's so fucking stupid.
Show new teach hort.

842
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.680
Ooh.
It's particularly hard for me.

843
00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.500
It's like,
what are you,
what are you seeing out there?

844
00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:21.070
Like,
here's the deal.
It might be more difficult for you,

845
00:51:21.071 --> 00:51:25.480
but nobody has it easy fucking sitting there acting like,

846
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:28.880
God damn fucking Spielberg sends me a fucking sandwich every day.

847
00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:30.993
<v 3>MMM.</v>

848
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:35.630
<v 2>Which would be nice if he's listening every once in a while.</v>

849
00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:37.430
<v 3>Uh,</v>

850
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:40.090
<v 2>all right.
Outdoor venues.
Yes.
Um,</v>

851
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:44.710
where's the weirdest venues that I've played,
outdoor venues that I played it.

852
00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:49.360
I used to open up for Wynonna Judd way back in the day and we,

853
00:51:49.361 --> 00:51:54.360
uh,
we did a lot of outdoor venues.
Um,

854
00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:58.020
you know,
when you sell on that level of tickets,

855
00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:02.700
she basically was selling so many tickets that they didn't have an indoor venue

856
00:52:02.701 --> 00:52:05.430
big enough.
So the half,
you have to go outside at some point.

857
00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:10.800
So I open it up up for her at the,
I believe it's the del Mar race track.

858
00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:14.090
I thought I told this story.

859
00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:15.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

860
00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:18.520
<v 2>So I go down there and it's one of these deals where they're like,
hey,
you know,</v>

861
00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:23.180
work clean.
This is a country crowd.
These people,
uh,

862
00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:27.820
they don't like Carsick,
which,
you know,
you have to respect.

863
00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:33.580
It's not my crowd.
I'm opening for this person.
This is what they've created,

864
00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:38.040
you know,
Volu young comics out there to then go up there and,
and,

865
00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:42.850
and curse anyways is a,
that's not a Lenny Bruce moment that,
that you're,

866
00:52:42.851 --> 00:52:45.500
you're acting like a jerk off.
Cause they,

867
00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:50.200
they probably told you before they even got the Gig,
you got to work clean.

868
00:52:50.650 --> 00:52:53.020
So if you're not going to work clean,
don't take the Gig,

869
00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:56.470
but don't say you're going to work clean and then go up there and start talking

870
00:52:56.471 --> 00:53:00.370
about your nuts.
Oh,
you're far more accurately these days.
You're fucking Twat.

871
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:04.360
Cause female comics are that fucking Dick Joe Comics of today.

872
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:11.620
Some of the fucking filth that I,
I mean some of the bits it's just like,

873
00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:16.770
I remember this bit except there were Dick and balls and I was standing in a bar

874
00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:20.260
trying to figure out how the fuck am I going to follow this shit.

875
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.863
<v 3>MMM.</v>

876
00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.760
<v 2>Anyways,
so,
uh,
I had to clean</v>

877
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.470
<v 1>it was during the day,</v>

878
00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.760
which actually didn't bug me because I was psyched because I was making money.

879
00:53:31.761 --> 00:53:35.270
I always loved like those gigs,
like a lot of times the news and Shit sucked.

880
00:53:35.271 --> 00:53:37.910
But what was awesome was when it was over,

881
00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:41.510
you had your check and you already made money and you could maybe double up and

882
00:53:41.511 --> 00:53:44.240
do another Gig or you were like done

883
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:49.790
at like a normal hours.
So,
um,
well that never happened.

884
00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:53.020
You know,
you always went out and did more fucking time.

885
00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:55.400
Are we gonna do sit at home and be alone with your thoughts?

886
00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:56.830
<v 0>Okay.</v>

887
00:53:56.830 --> 00:54:01.600
<v 1>So I went down there
and why nodal was always like really nice to me.</v>

888
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:06.550
Um,
and I went down to open up and I got to work clean.

889
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:11.530
It's outside,
I'm in the sun,
I'm a redhead.
I still had my hair back then,

890
00:54:11.531 --> 00:54:14.410
so I didn't need a hat and a,

891
00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.840
I'm up there and I'm doing my shit.

892
00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:22.080
And all of a sudden this lady in the crowd who I'm going to go out on a limb and

893
00:54:22.811 --> 00:54:27.760
say was a lesbian,
you know,
she had that haircut,
the whole fucking thing.

894
00:54:27.761 --> 00:54:28.510
And I know you're not,

895
00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:30.490
you're not supposed to do well at least you're not supposed to do that with

896
00:54:30.491 --> 00:54:34.540
lesbians.
You know,
you could do that with other groups of people,
you know,

897
00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:39.820
don't be a Brad,
don't be a Chad.
You can,
you can fucking do that.

898
00:54:39.821 --> 00:54:43.840
But if you go the other way,
all of a sudden you're an asshole.
Uh,
but yeah,

899
00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:46.660
I mean if I had to put my life savings on it and the same people that were

900
00:54:46.661 --> 00:54:49.750
criticizing me,
if it was a life or death situation,

901
00:54:49.751 --> 00:54:54.100
if you had to put money on it,
you would say this was a lesbian.
Right.

902
00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:58.600
Why is it pertinent to the story?
Because I'm painting a picture.
All right,

903
00:54:59.590 --> 00:55:03.100
and are you liberal cuts out there acting like you don't have a fucking idea in

904
00:55:03.101 --> 00:55:07.600
your head when I say that,
that she was a lesbian,

905
00:55:07.601 --> 00:55:10.840
you have no fucking idea what I'm saying.
What if I said it was a frat boy,

906
00:55:12.070 --> 00:55:16.440
you got your boom,
you get out to get that picture in your head.
Right.
Um,
anyways,

907
00:55:16.441 --> 00:55:19.990
so she sit there and I'm on stage.
It's she shit the whole,

908
00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:24.760
like I maybe get three minutes into my act,
we'll fucking outside.

909
00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:29.770
It's brewed
and she's just standing.
She starts going,
why?

910
00:55:29.771 --> 00:55:32.700
No why?
No,
no.

911
00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:37.420
And she's trying to get the rest of the crowd to do it with her,

912
00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:41.660
which they're not thankfully,
but she's fucking relentless.
And I,

913
00:55:41.661 --> 00:55:44.860
I don't know if I did a joke that she didn't like,

914
00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:48.400
or maybe it was that I had at Dick.
I have no fucking idea who,

915
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:51.430
or maybe I was just an pasty or maybe she thought I was weird looking.

916
00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:55.480
Well,
maybe she was just a cunt.
I have no idea.

917
00:55:55.481 --> 00:56:00.220
But she's doing that and I'm sitting there
and I want to go off on her,

918
00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:02.290
but I got to work clean.

919
00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:08.380
So I actually just stopped and I gathered myself and I said,
Hey lady.

920
00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:15.480
I was like,
what is the problem?
Why are you Channing Wine Wynonna?

921
00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:16.611
Why?
No,

922
00:56:16.611 --> 00:56:21.611
not she's going to come out here at eight 30 no matter what she's coming out at

923
00:56:23.161 --> 00:56:27.150
eight 30.
Okay.
Do you think I thought all you guys came out here to see me.

924
00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:27.880
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

925
00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:30.760
<v 1>I know why I'm here.
I'm dancing monkey boy,</v>

926
00:56:30.761 --> 00:56:33.490
but Blahblahblahblahblah and uh,

927
00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:37.850
I got the crowd on my side and then I made fun of her haircut.
I had to,

928
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:43.950
I had to do it cause I had to make sure I got all the Trump supporters on my

929
00:56:44.411 --> 00:56:45.244
side.

930
00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:50.790
I was flailing and then I got him and I started having getting labs and that

931
00:56:51.311 --> 00:56:54.130
lady was pissed and she was still Janet.
Why?
No,
no,

932
00:56:54.131 --> 00:56:56.830
but now it's drowning her out with laughs and I was winning.

933
00:56:57.790 --> 00:56:58.300
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

934
00:56:58.300 --> 00:56:58.500
<v 1>Oh,</v>

935
00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:03.500
redhead in the sun with this pasty freckled back up against the nonexistent wall

936
00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:05.950
was turning it around

937
00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:12.160
and then out of nowhere the crown went from laughing on it.
No,
they just went

938
00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.633
<v 5>wow.</v>

939
00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:16.530
<v 1>All at the same time.
And I couldn't figure what the fuck happened.</v>

940
00:57:16.531 --> 00:57:18.600
I thought my fly came down.
I had no idea.

941
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:23.970
And I turned around and behind me was way off in the distance,
was a carnival.

942
00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:27.380
And there's some ride where they just shoot you up in the fucking air,
like,

943
00:57:27.381 --> 00:57:28.260
like superman.

944
00:57:28.261 --> 00:57:32.260
So I'm standing there fucking finally getting the crowd and right as it's

945
00:57:32.261 --> 00:57:34.800
starting to pay attention to me in the way in the background,

946
00:57:34.801 --> 00:57:38.370
some guy got shot up in the fucking air on this ride,

947
00:57:38.371 --> 00:57:43.110
and then I kind of made fun of that.
Oh,
not another hit.
Ah,

948
00:57:43.111 --> 00:57:46.710
another head,
another run scores.
And we got ourselves a tie game,

949
00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:53.860
five to five,
just like that.

950
00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:00.580
Oh.
Coaches coming out to the mound.

951
00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:05.880
Jesus Christ.
Wow.

952
00:58:05.881 --> 00:58:09.000
And with deep into our fucking bullpen already.
This is not looking good guys.

953
00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:11.093
<v 0>MMM.</v>

954
00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:16.750
<v 1>Anyways.
Uh,
so yeah,
that was a weird one.</v>

955
00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:21.130
I've done also,
I've done college gigs in a,
uh,

956
00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:27.520
sort of that area,
you know,
the Walker's shame area between dorms.

957
00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:31.420
I've done that.
And there was also like sort of a carnival thing set up.

958
00:58:31.421 --> 00:58:35.650
There's always a fucking car.
It was always rides some sort of popcorn machine.

959
00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:37.683
<v 0>MMM.</v>

960
00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.990
<v 1>I remember a long time ago,
this one was actually inside.</v>

961
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:46.063
<v 0>MMM.</v>

962
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:52.030
<v 1>It was me,
Patrice,
O'Neil,</v>

963
00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:55.990
Robert Kelly,
Dane Cook,
and Al Del Benny.

964
00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:01.570
We all doing this gig
and it was something,

965
00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:04.480
some sort of Jewish thing.

966
00:59:04.481 --> 00:59:09.481
I don't remember what was a function hall and the crowd was was predominantly

967
00:59:09.761 --> 00:59:13.750
Jewish.
I don't know.
It couldn't have been fucking,
they don't go to church.

968
00:59:13.751 --> 00:59:16.060
Where do they go to temple?

969
00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:18.520
I could couldn't have been related to that or they wouldn't have hired us.

970
00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:21.130
I don't know what it was,
but all I know is we were up there

971
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:24.103
<v 0>and</v>

972
00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:30.310
<v 1>none of us were in the business long enough to recognize like we will go.</v>

973
00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:32.370
Why is this microphone so small?

974
00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:34.980
Like you could hold it with just your two fingers.

975
00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:38.760
I remember Al went up there first go and this is the smallest microphone I've

976
00:59:38.761 --> 00:59:39.181
ever seen.

977
00:59:39.181 --> 00:59:42.660
Then he put it in his mouth and started humming or whatever and people laughed

978
00:59:42.661 --> 00:59:44.430
and I was like,
oh my God,
I got to hold that thing.

979
00:59:44.431 --> 00:59:46.920
Now I've got to go up after him.
Right.
So we did the whole,

980
00:59:46.921 --> 00:59:50.970
we did the whole fucking show.
I remember when Patrice get up there,

981
00:59:50.971 --> 00:59:53.820
he was holding it with his big fucking fat fingers.

982
00:59:53.821 --> 00:59:56.040
Just holding this little thing is three things.

983
00:59:56.041 --> 00:59:59.640
Like he was holding a teacup and a,

984
00:59:59.641 --> 01:00:03.990
it wasn't until years later when I did my first TV Gig that I realized it was a

985
01:00:03.991 --> 01:00:08.910
lapel mic and none of us knew to just clip it on your shirt and then just walk

986
01:00:08.911 --> 01:00:12.030
around like you're doing the one man show,
you know,
with both hands.
So we all,

987
01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:16.830
we would like finish our act and there was a Mike stand and we would like drape

988
01:00:16.831 --> 01:00:20.610
it over and then the next guy would come up or just pick it up with his index

989
01:00:20.611 --> 01:00:25.370
finger and his thumb.
Um,
yeah,

990
01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:27.650
I don't know.
I gotta be honest with you.
All of those hell gigs,

991
01:00:27.651 --> 01:00:30.140
they all just kind of,
they kind of fade away after a while.
I can't,

992
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:34.220
I don't remember.
I just know I've had a bunch of shit thrown at me.

993
01:00:34.221 --> 01:00:36.940
I think I just,
after a while you just,
you don't want to remember him.

994
01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:38.733
<v 0>MMM.</v>

995
01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:45.260
<v 1>Yeah.
I don't know.
I,
I've,
I've done some,
I've definitely done some weird,</v>

996
01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:46.133
I know I've done,

997
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:51.530
I did one outside up Mondale fucking west side highway.

998
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:56.030
There was like boats and shit

999
01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:00.040
and all these fucking flies and stuff.
Yeah.

1000
01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:02.680
These are all starting to come back home.
It was hottest shit too.

1001
01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:04.550
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1002
01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:07.430
<v 1>And I was up there and I had like a long sleeve button down cause I just worked</v>

1003
01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:11.220
like a comedy club so they had like the air conditioning cranking and then I

1004
01:01:11.221 --> 01:01:14.270
went over and did that Gig and I was like sweating my ass off.
Yeah,
I've done it.

1005
01:01:14.271 --> 01:01:15.021
I've done a lot of those.

1006
01:01:15.021 --> 01:01:19.520
That's kind of par for the course that happens.

1007
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:25.160
Um,
that was a fun one though.
I opened for Wynona outside in a,
in a,

1008
01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:29.360
in a parking lot,
parking lot,
race track,

1009
01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:35.300
the occasional theater.
I opened up for an a parking lot in Laughlin,
Nevada.

1010
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:39.590
Jesus do.
Why are you bringing back all of these memories?
All right.
A smoothie,

1011
01:01:40.550 --> 01:01:41.031
dear bill,

1012
01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:45.950
years and years back you said Kevin James told you the benefits of having liquid

1013
01:01:45.951 --> 01:01:50.450
first in the morning to get your engine going.
Kevin James.

1014
01:01:50.451 --> 01:01:54.590
I don't know if you get the name right.
I've only met him like once a smoothie,

1015
01:01:54.591 --> 01:01:57.830
water,
et cetera.
Then a few years ago you basically said,

1016
01:01:57.831 --> 01:01:59.900
fuck that because you thought it was too much.

1017
01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:04.790
It might have read it was bad for you.
Now you're doing smoothies.

1018
01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:09.560
Do you think it'll stick this time?
No Pun intended.
Go blend yourself.

1019
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:14.210
Uh,
well,
I didn't know how to make one healthy back then.
You know what I mean?

1020
01:02:14.211 --> 01:02:15.590
There's a lot of them.
It's just like,

1021
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:18.920
you do all this stuff and there's a bunch of sugar in shit that you're putting

1022
01:02:18.921 --> 01:02:22.560
in there.
Um,
now that I've been using like,
um,

1023
01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.730
unsweetened almond milk,
almond milk,
I used to hate it.

1024
01:02:26.731 --> 01:02:31.240
Now I'm kind of used to it.
Uh,
I got a good one for you.
Uh,

1025
01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:36.010
one cup of,
uh,
almond milk.
I literally a miming doing this,

1026
01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:37.083
putting this shit in.

1027
01:02:38.110 --> 01:02:38.820
<v 3>Uh,</v>

1028
01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:42.480
<v 1>then it's like a teaspoon is cinnamon,
a frozen banana,</v>

1029
01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:47.600
two tablespoons of almond,
peanut butter.

1030
01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:49.700
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1031
01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:56.440
<v 1>A tablespoon of Maca powder.
Some ice,</v>

1032
01:02:57.370 --> 01:03:00.910
a little bit of ice.
You blend that fucker together.
It's delicious.

1033
01:03:00.911 --> 01:03:04.210
Tastes like a God damn chocolate shake and you'd drink it and you have energy

1034
01:03:04.690 --> 01:03:05.523
for hours.

1035
01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:06.973
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1036
01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.500
<v 1>I gotta be,
I gotta be honest with you.
If,</v>

1037
01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:15.280
if I actually knew enough about nutrition and all I could do,

1038
01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:16.750
if all I could do is just that

1039
01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:18.530
<v 3>mmm.</v>

1040
01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:21.590
<v 1>And just do a liquid diet,
I would love to do that.</v>

1041
01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.750
I would absolutely love to do that.

1042
01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:26.213
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1043
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:30.280
<v 1>There's another one I have that's like Kale.
It says apple juice.</v>

1044
01:03:30.281 --> 01:03:31.150
That's the only thing I don't like.

1045
01:03:31.151 --> 01:03:33.640
It's apple juice and just apple juice has a bunch of sugar in it.

1046
01:03:33.641 --> 01:03:37.480
So I went to like,
this is fucking hilarious.
It says health food store,

1047
01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:40.210
but like,
they don't like gays.

1048
01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:46.570
Funniest fucking thing.
I was like,
how did those things go together?

1049
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:51.100
It's usually like,
hey man,
here's some vitamins.
And everybody's like,
everybody,

1050
01:03:51.101 --> 01:03:54.610
man.
Uh,
who the fuck would it?
Who Ever saw that coming?

1051
01:03:55.510 --> 01:04:00.460
Um,
um,
so yeah,
I would love to do that.
Like,

1052
01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:04.450
uh,
two as you saw some of the shit that I'm fucking eating,

1053
01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:07.810
they'll look at this fucking,
I Miss Boston.
Just saw a guy,

1054
01:04:07.811 --> 01:04:11.890
he had a red sox like knitted cap on with the Tom Brady Jersey in a glove

1055
01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:17.250
sitting right along the third base line.
Fucking hilarious.
Um,
I,
yeah,

1056
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.400
I would love to do that.
Um,

1057
01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:23.770
I like vegetarian and Vegan meals,
but I also still like steak,

1058
01:04:23.771 --> 01:04:25.840
but I know if I combine like all of that shit,

1059
01:04:25.841 --> 01:04:29.800
I can still eat a little bit like John Wayne and not have a problem.

1060
01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:35.470
Um,
all right.
You disrespected miles Davis.
You can't.
All right.

1061
01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:39.580
What does this,
hey bill in season two,
episode four of F is for family.

1062
01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:43.600
There is an album cover parodying the miles Davis kind of blue.

1063
01:04:43.601 --> 01:04:47.260
In the background of one scene in the corner of the cover,

1064
01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:52.150
there appears to be a label of Bluenote records in this case,

1065
01:04:52.151 --> 01:04:54.550
black note records.
Uh,

1066
01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:59.380
these two instances of factual are factually incorrect.

1067
01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:04.570
Dude,
how much
you fucking jazz guys,
you know,

1068
01:05:04.571 --> 01:05:05.860
back in the fucking day,

1069
01:05:05.861 --> 01:05:09.970
I used to host this show called the jazz oasis on,

1070
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:13.270
on uh,
the fuck was it?

1071
01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:16.270
88.9.

1072
01:05:17.070 --> 01:05:17.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1073
01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:21.730
<v 1>W E r s at Emerson College.
And I used to find,</v>

1074
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:26.730
I didn't know fucking anything about jazz and I'd asked You fucking assholes to

1075
01:05:26.731 --> 01:05:30.150
call and request and none of you motherfuckers would call in.

1076
01:05:30.151 --> 01:05:33.930
All you would do is wait for me to play a record and then all you fucking cunts

1077
01:05:33.931 --> 01:05:36.090
would get on the phone and call me and be like,
fuck you.

1078
01:05:36.091 --> 01:05:40.650
Play in that four man in a jazz.
The fuck is it did a jazz motherfucker.

1079
01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:45.510
All you fucking guys can go fuck yourself.
Go sit on your fucking horn.
All right.

1080
01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:50.690
First of all,
did,
did you enjoy the show?

1081
01:05:52.070 --> 01:05:54.620
Did you enjoy the episode?
Listen to this ass.

1082
01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:57.470
Those are for actually incorrect kind of blue was released,

1083
01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:01.520
released on Columbia records.
Nobody likes labels,

1084
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:03.980
record labels more than these fucking jazz people.

1085
01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:08.060
And Miles Davis at the time had not recorded for blue note.
Uh,

1086
01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:12.080
in a number of years.
You might want to get your facts straight.

1087
01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.033
You believe this shit.

1088
01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:16.820
If you want to reference the greatest jazz record of all time,

1089
01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:20.300
it may be who've you to respect,
respect,

1090
01:06:20.301 --> 01:06:25.250
possibly the greatest musician of the 20th century by simply getting some simple

1091
01:06:25.251 --> 01:06:28.700
factual information correct on your show.
You had dumb cunt.

1092
01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:33.800
Tony Williams is probably ashamed of you.
Let's be honest.
All right,
sir.

1093
01:06:35.170 --> 01:06:39.940
I'm going to walk you back through all your bullshit.
Okay?
First of all,

1094
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:46.630
the reason why it didn't say Bluenote or Columbia records is because we would

1095
01:06:46.991 --> 01:06:49.610
have had that.
We would had to get permission to do that.

1096
01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:55.130
That's also the reason why the song kindness sounded like kind of blue,

1097
01:06:55.250 --> 01:07:00.250
but was it because we don't have the fucking budget to use that music.

1098
01:07:02.030 --> 01:07:05.910
All right.
That's why,
that's why it looked like that.

1099
01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:11.810
Okay.
And then secondly,
Tony Williams didn't play on that record.
You dumb.
Fuck

1100
01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:18.000
I then for the record,
I thought it was Philly,
Joe Jones.
I looked it up.

1101
01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:20.160
It was like some Guy Jimmy carb or something.

1102
01:07:20.161 --> 01:07:23.010
I hope I got his fucking name wrong.
Just so you can blow another gasket.

1103
01:07:23.130 --> 01:07:26.850
Fuck all you jazz guys.
You stupid cunt.
You're not,

1104
01:07:26.851 --> 01:07:28.500
you're not making an animated show.

1105
01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:33.330
You have no fucking idea how much money music costs.
That's why we did that.

1106
01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:37.560
Okay.
It w we weren't disrespecting miles Davis.
Okay,

1107
01:07:37.561 --> 01:07:41.880
so why don't you take all your words like behoove stick him in your clarinet and

1108
01:07:41.881 --> 01:07:45.570
shove it up your ass.
You pretentious fucking cunt.

1109
01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:50.340
Ah,
did that feel good?
He didn't even,

1110
01:07:50.341 --> 01:07:52.680
he didn't get the right drummer after giving me shit.

1111
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:54.750
He didn't even get the right fucking drummer.

1112
01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:02.410
Tony Williams as part of the second grade quintet.
I do know that,
but I don't,

1113
01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:03.610
I don't know shit about jazz.

1114
01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.670
But I do know that the reason why we did that was because it would

1115
01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.870
Columbia records and Bluenote probably wouldn't have given us permission.

1116
01:08:10.871 --> 01:08:11.501
And if they did,

1117
01:08:11.501 --> 01:08:15.490
it would have cost us more money than it costs to fucking make the whole and we

1118
01:08:15.491 --> 01:08:19.360
would've been screwed.
That's why sir.
Okay.

1119
01:08:19.361 --> 01:08:24.010
So we didn't disrespect them.
We tipped our fucking cap tool.
Um,

1120
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.630
by the way,
do you play any instrument?
Are you in a band?
All right.
Anger issue.

1121
01:08:27.631 --> 01:08:31.570
So this could not come at a better time.
Anger issues.

1122
01:08:33.090 --> 01:08:35.730
Uh,
we're gonna have anger issues if we don't get out of this fucking any.

1123
01:08:36.370 --> 01:08:40.030
All we did,
we finally got out of the inning.
Um,

1124
01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:43.740
dear Billy,
red top dear bill.
Bill red top.
Okay.

1125
01:08:43.741 --> 01:08:46.320
I had anger issues when I was younger.
Oh my God,
it's,

1126
01:08:46.321 --> 01:08:48.900
this is going to be a rail light.
I had a good family,

1127
01:08:48.901 --> 01:08:52.560
but I grew up in a neighborhood that exposed me to shit I shouldn't have seen.

1128
01:08:53.190 --> 01:08:54.480
Uh,
as a defense,

1129
01:08:54.481 --> 01:08:58.800
I started reacting to everything with anger and it carried on into my adult
life.

1130
01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:03.690
Uh,
did I write this in a drunken state and I forgot,

1131
01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:04.770
cause this sounds like me.

1132
01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:09.270
I've read lots of books and even wrote a few unpublished ones on the topic

1133
01:09:09.271 --> 01:09:13.530
myself.
So you actually worked on it.
I commend you for that.

1134
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:20.050
I just like try for a few days and then I just go back to what I know anyways.

1135
01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:24.350
It kept me from being the happiest I could be.
It didn't ruin my life,

1136
01:09:24.351 --> 01:09:26.150
but it's kept me from enjoying things.

1137
01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:30.590
I had a bad habit of looking at people who are happy and finding reasons not to

1138
01:09:30.591 --> 01:09:33.720
like them.
I don't do that.
I think I did that my twenties,
but I,
I,

1139
01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:38.750
I'm not like that.
Uh,
even people I was close to,
which may sound strange.
Nope,

1140
01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:43.460
I did that a long time ago and then I've also had that done to me.

1141
01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:47.510
Um,
I remember when I bought my old truck,

1142
01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:52.530
68 f 100 short bed.
This guy was like,
what'd you get to truck?
Huh?
Hey,

1143
01:09:53.050 --> 01:09:54.500
you're going to put stuff back there.

1144
01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:58.540
Just like annoyed because everybody was looking at my truck.

1145
01:09:58.541 --> 01:10:01.670
Go do that thing is so fucking bad ass.
Nobody has that out here.

1146
01:10:01.671 --> 01:10:03.890
This thing's a shit,
you know.
Anyways,

1147
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:08.000
I've been catching up on your podcasts over the last year and I've heard you go

1148
01:10:08.001 --> 01:10:13.001
from being much very angry to still pretty being pretty Angley but certainly

1149
01:10:14.631 --> 01:10:18.020
less angry than before.
I'm glad you've made strides.
Well,

1150
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:21.890
not on this podcast because I can tell you the most important thing I gained

1151
01:10:21.891 --> 01:10:23.120
from reprogramming,

1152
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:28.450
my immediate reaction to everything from anger to observance is time.

1153
01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:36.460
I'm not smart enough to only read that sentence once I got to do this again.
Uh,

1154
01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:40.160
I can tell you the most important thing I gained from recaro reprogramming,

1155
01:10:40.161 --> 01:10:44.150
my immediate reaction to everything from anger to observance is time.

1156
01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:47.053
What does that mean?

1157
01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:54.200
You got time back or something or you,
you're enjoying your life more.

1158
01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:58.910
You cause you don't have to spend so much of it apologizing for what you did an

1159
01:10:58.910 --> 01:11:00.530
hour ago anyways.
It's sneaky though.

1160
01:11:00.531 --> 01:11:04.400
Being angry can waste a whole day and you can do things while still being

1161
01:11:04.401 --> 01:11:09.230
agitated,
but you don't feel like you're completely unaccomplished.
Yeah,

1162
01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:14.060
I don't,
I don't stay angry for a whole day.
Uh,
I just do like in spurts.

1163
01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:15.790
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1164
01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:17.920
<v 1>And it goes all the way up to the top.
Then it come back down and worried.</v>

1165
01:11:17.921 --> 01:11:21.600
Cause what's the Hell's wrong with you?
I've got your right.
Sorry.
You know,

1166
01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:24.830
I'm just trying to fucking take my work.
Uh,
you still ran your,

1167
01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:27.860
your errands and did your jobs and fed your kid,
et Cetera,

1168
01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:32.060
but you probably ignoring things you could be doing to advance yourself.

1169
01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:36.350
Uh,
you're likely not appreciating those.
Who are we talking about here?

1170
01:11:36.351 --> 01:11:40.280
Is this me?
My goodness.
A stern talking to um,

1171
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:41.990
are you just a hypothetical you,

1172
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:45.200
but you're probably ignoring things you could be doing to advance yourself.

1173
01:11:45.230 --> 01:11:50.180
You're likely not appreciating those around you who make your life good because

1174
01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:53.750
you are focused on people who make your life terrible or projecting things on

1175
01:11:53.751 --> 01:11:56.930
people that aren't there.
Um,

1176
01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.710
I don't do any of that with anybody in my life.

1177
01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:05.540
I do that with the people that are in power.
I do that a lot.
You know,

1178
01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:10.610
like I was all ready to fucking talk about everybody at best buy this is like

1179
01:12:10.611 --> 01:12:13.220
two podcasts in a row and they've done nothing wrong.

1180
01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:18.350
It's just been me needing to make a couple adjustments anyways.

1181
01:12:18.351 --> 01:12:23.120
My biggest regret in all my anger years was snapping at people who are genuinely

1182
01:12:23.121 --> 01:12:25.910
good people who didn't have that angry gene.

1183
01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:30.710
It's like being six foot one,
two 15 kicking the hell out of a small kid.

1184
01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:34.790
They can't defend themselves because if they do,
they become the maniac.

1185
01:12:34.791 --> 01:12:37.550
You are horrible,
horrible position to put someone in.

1186
01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:42.590
Hope you cross the finish line to zen?
Uh,
yeah.
I mean,

1187
01:12:42.591 --> 01:12:47.210
I think I'm,
I'm somewhere in the middle of angry and Zen,

1188
01:12:47.211 --> 01:12:50.690
believe it or not,
as much as I flip out,
like I was,

1189
01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:55.520
I was a lot worse,
but,
uh,
I don't wish bad shit on people

1190
01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:00.340
and,
um,
I don't resent anybody.

1191
01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:02.300
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1192
01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:07.050
<v 1>I don't,
I just,
it's,
you know what things,
things make me freak up.</v>

1193
01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:12.260
Anything tech technology related makes me flip up.

1194
01:13:12.261 --> 01:13:14.360
But you know what's funny is if I get something old,

1195
01:13:14.361 --> 01:13:18.410
I have all the patients in the world,
you know,

1196
01:13:18.411 --> 01:13:22.230
like if my old truck won't start,
I actually,
you know,
I may not,

1197
01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:23.420
I'm not going to say I enjoy it,
but I,

1198
01:13:23.421 --> 01:13:27.830
I find the process of figuring out what's wrong with it,
enjoyable.

1199
01:13:27.831 --> 01:13:32.210
And then learning,
you know,
as the truck gets fixed,

1200
01:13:32.211 --> 01:13:37.100
what that was,
why that happened,
how to prevent it in the future.
Uh,

1201
01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:38.420
I know,
I tell you this,
you know what,

1202
01:13:38.421 --> 01:13:43.421
playing drums really helped me get back into playing drums and,

1203
01:13:44.991 --> 01:13:49.610
uh,
you know,
meet Nia.
Having a kid,

1204
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:51.530
just shit that made me happy,

1205
01:13:52.650 --> 01:13:53.550
<v 3>uh,</v>

1206
01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:58.070
<v 1>has kinda gotten me to that.
But my big thing is if I could just stop snapping,</v>

1207
01:13:58.071 --> 01:13:59.450
that's kind of what I don't walk like,

1208
01:13:59.451 --> 01:14:01.670
you know what's funny is people actually think I am like an angry guy.

1209
01:14:01.671 --> 01:14:04.220
Like a walk around angry.
I don't,
I just snap.

1210
01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:06.863
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1211
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:12.590
<v 1>I'm definitely loud and I'm definitely fucking crazy.
But uh,</v>

1212
01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:19.140
I dunno.
Maybe I'll let you guys be,
I don't classify myself as an angry guy.

1213
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:23.670
Uh,
I saw,
I got to talking about my drinking.
Like I don't think I'm an alcoholic.

1214
01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:29.130
I don't think I'm an angry guy.
And I also think that I can admit when I'm wrong.

1215
01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:34.710
Fucking mess.
All right.
Dilemmas.
A dilemma.
Clarification number one,
Bill,

1216
01:14:34.711 --> 01:14:39.690
last week you read my dilemma wrong.
Oh,
sorry.
Geez.
Everybody coming at me.

1217
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.951
Uh,

1218
01:14:40.951 --> 01:14:45.951
you have to either score perfectly on the sats with up to a year of studying or

1219
01:14:47.341 --> 01:14:51.570
in one sitting when a game of monopoly.
Oh,

1220
01:14:51.710 --> 01:14:55.470
in one city.
That means bankrupting all the other players.

1221
01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:57.390
Which one to save your life.

1222
01:15:00.570 --> 01:15:05.160
MMM.
Oh,
the fucking sats.

1223
01:15:06.230 --> 01:15:06.780
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1224
01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:09.540
<v 1>absolutely.
Those things are are pretty hard,</v>

1225
01:15:09.541 --> 01:15:12.540
but fucking winning monopoly in one sitting.
I mean that's just,

1226
01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:18.660
I'd rather like sit down and like this time around really pay attention in math

1227
01:15:18.661 --> 01:15:21.230
class and and find out what I'm,

1228
01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:26.010
what this math is she is applied to as opposed to just being regurgitated at me.

1229
01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:31.380
Then sitting down and rolling dice like I'm in a fucking casino,

1230
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:35.770
you know,
I mean Jesus Christ.
Can you imagine,
you know,

1231
01:15:36.190 --> 01:15:40.480
your life's on the line and you're moving a little dog or a shoe around a board.

1232
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:43.150
I think I would much rather leave it up to my brain.

1233
01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:45.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1234
01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.770
<v 1>Sort of a damned if you do,
damned if you don't come on get underneath that.</v>

1235
01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:54.840
All right.
You ain't get a challenge as I'm okay.
Okay.

1236
01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:56.210
<v 0>Yeah</v>

1237
01:15:56.210 --> 01:15:59.960
<v 1>Man on second top of the seventh one out.
Okay.</v>

1238
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:01.423
Dear Bill.

1239
01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:06.130
Dear dear bill to thought I have a dilemma for you,

1240
01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:12.390
would you rather have to fight an alligator in a water tank with a 12 inch blade

1241
01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:19.080
or fight an alligator in a room with a 30 inch aluminum baseball bat?

1242
01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:23.600
All right,
well we haven't talked about the size of the alligator.

1243
01:16:23.601 --> 01:16:27.200
I'm assuming it's big enough to kill me,
obviously.
Well,

1244
01:16:27.201 --> 01:16:28.670
I remember a long time ago,

1245
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:34.750
I'm a cop told me if you're not going to get a gun to get a bat because you want

1246
01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:37.700
to have distance between you and the intruder.

1247
01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:42.080
So considering that the intruder is a fucking reptile pass ball,

1248
01:16:42.081 --> 01:16:46.000
he goes to third.
Fuck.

1249
01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:49.000
Um,
I would,
uh,

1250
01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:51.100
<v 0>okay.</v>

1251
01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:52.960
<v 1>Yeah,
I take the the baseball bat.</v>

1252
01:16:53.770 --> 01:16:54.170
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1253
01:16:54.170 --> 01:16:59.170
<v 1>And the weird thing about an alligator is you got to come at them straight on.</v>

1254
01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:05.330
Right?
Or from behind those fucking things.

1255
01:17:05.331 --> 01:17:08.930
You don't want to be on the side.
They,
they,
they bite from the side.

1256
01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:12.890
If you're right in front of them,
you're all good.
That's why all those,

1257
01:17:12.891 --> 01:17:15.660
those fucking morons that go up and they stick to their,
their,

1258
01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.980
their arm in the guy's mouth.
The Guy

1259
01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:26.780
No fucking way.
Oh,

1260
01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:29.380
Holy Shit.
What a fucking play that was

1261
01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:35.520
dude.
Lay down the BOT,
that owl to bay guy came in.
Who the fuck was that?

1262
01:17:35.521 --> 01:17:40.270
Zander Bogart.
Who through that fucking ball.
Who true that ball.
Oh,

1263
01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:44.520
it wasn't who he was swaying.
Actually.
Actually it wasn't a good throw.
He got him

1264
01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:52.360
throw was high.
He slid wide.
Oh No,

1265
01:17:52.361 --> 01:17:54.460
they're going to reverse that,
ladies and gentlemen.

1266
01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:56.760
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1267
01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:59.970
<v 1>Oh,
you mother fucker.
That's going to be that.</v>

1268
01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:02.760
He's safe anyways.
Yeah,
I would,

1269
01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:07.140
I would 30 inch aluminum bat.
Wait.
Yeah.
Wait,
wait a minute.

1270
01:18:07.141 --> 01:18:10.740
That's not that big.
It's only three feet.

1271
01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:13.843
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1272
01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:16.723
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1273
01:18:16.770 --> 01:18:18.460
<v 1>All right.
This is us just so weird.</v>

1274
01:18:18.461 --> 01:18:21.400
I would attack the top of his head from behind,

1275
01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.830
but I'd start with his feet.

1276
01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:27.441
Well,
you know,

1277
01:18:27.441 --> 01:18:31.820
that would actually fucking kill me to do that to a living thing like that.

1278
01:18:31.821 --> 01:18:35.060
I'd have to fucking slowly chop it down.
I had attacked the fuck thanks fee.

1279
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:36.540
Although I did see that one way,

1280
01:18:36.541 --> 01:18:39.350
that fuck on Rogan showed that with that alligator bit,

1281
01:18:39.351 --> 01:18:41.330
the other ones leg and just did the death row,

1282
01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:45.120
rip the fucking things leg off and the other one wasn't going like,
ah.

1283
01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:49.070
It was just going like,
and that's it.

1284
01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:54.320
Just fucking down at barely bled.
So,

1285
01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:58.570
yeah,
I think,
I think he just got to a,

1286
01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:04.320
maybe what I really love to do is just sort of somehow getting on its back,

1287
01:19:04.321 --> 01:19:06.870
rub its belly.
Oh,
I know what I would do.

1288
01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:10.680
I take my shirt off and I cover its eyes.

1289
01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.350
I've seen those guys do that.

1290
01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:15.280
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1291
01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:19.090
<v 1>And then I would take that fucking bat and I would just wham,</v>

1292
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:22.060
right down on it's fucking,
you know,
and I,
I,
you know,
that would be,

1293
01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.270
I wouldn't want to kill an alligator.
I am terrified of those things,

1294
01:19:26.271 --> 01:19:31.100
but I don't live in the same world.
It does.
But if it was me and him,

1295
01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:32.570
I mean that thing has to go.

1296
01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:34.473
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1297
01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:39.080
<v 1>I've eaten alligator though.
Night alligator.
When I was in Florida.</v>

1298
01:19:39.081 --> 01:19:42.790
It was fucking gross.
Just too Goddamn Gamey.

1299
01:19:43.810 --> 01:19:48.370
People like gay,
you know,
get tastes like chicken.
It doesn't,
it doesn't.

1300
01:19:48.371 --> 01:19:51.580
Chicken is fucking delicious.

1301
01:19:53.710 --> 01:19:57.010
Steers are delicious.
Those are the pigs are delicious.

1302
01:19:57.220 --> 01:20:01.060
Those are the three fucking best tasting things.
Turkey's a good,

1303
01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.940
they dry out though.
You know,

1304
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:08.970
<v 2>that's what I think.
Like you get to the upper level of,
you know,</v>

1305
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.550
if you have a smoker,
if you actually know how to smoke Turkey,

1306
01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:16.860
how the fuck did I do an hour and 20 minutes?
I'm all right.
That's the podcast.

1307
01:20:16.861 --> 01:20:20.070
I really appreciate people who are trying to help me with my temper because I

1308
01:20:20.071 --> 01:20:23.670
would like,
I mean,
I need to learn to like how to stop fucking snapping.

1309
01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.860
Um,
that's the big thing.
You know,
I'm not going to lie to you.

1310
01:20:28.861 --> 01:20:31.800
I do ramp it up a little bit when I'm on the podcast just to entertain you guys.

1311
01:20:31.801 --> 01:20:35.130
Put a,
that is,
that was pretty legit earlier in this show.
All right,

1312
01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:40.110
that's the podcast here.
I'll check in on you on,
um,
on Thursday.

1313
01:20:41.010 --> 01:20:44.490
Go fuck yourselves at a,
I have a wonderful couple of days.
