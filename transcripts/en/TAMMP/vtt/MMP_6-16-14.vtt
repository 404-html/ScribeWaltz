00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.590
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

2
00:00:05.591 --> 00:00:10.330
June 16th,
2014 how the hell are your,
how are you doing?

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.850
Yeah,
no.
Are you enjoying the fucking Saba?

4
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.540
When does this summer start officially?
I know it's June 20 something.

5
00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:23.840
I'll tell you a book deal.
That global warming,
it's kind of hard to tell.
Um,

6
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.510
I got to watch the volume this week.
Okay.
I have to keep it low.

7
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.550
Fucking key because uh,
I am actually recording.
Um,
Sunday,

8
00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:36.130
June 15th.
I'm in Salt Lake City.

9
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.830
<v 0>Okay,</v>

10
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.700
<v 1>I'll go.
I didn't pronounce it.
Salt Lake City.</v>

11
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.520
We had a hotel room here and I got to keep my,
uh,

12
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.900
my voice down cause I don't want to offend,
you know,

13
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.350
whatever Mormon is next door and the whole,
that hotel room,
right?

14
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.630
What's his fucking 22 wives or whatever the hell they do.
You know,
you don't,

15
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.110
it's funny when you come out here to Utah,

16
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.450
you think what you're gonna see is you're going to see a bunch of Mormons,
right?

17
00:01:01.451 --> 00:01:04.870
Walking around dressed like the runs little house in the prairie.
And,
you know,

18
00:01:04.871 --> 00:01:09.420
one guy with like,
you know,
four wives,
five wives,
and uh,

19
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.930
I don't know how many times I've been out to Utah,

20
00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:15.820
but it finally dawned on me that if you have five wives,
okay,

21
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.240
and you know,
each one of them wants to have like two kids.

22
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.990
The average woman wants a couple of kids,
right?
I'd like a boy and a girl,

23
00:01:22.991 --> 00:01:25.270
you know,
one of each,
you know,

24
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.090
looking at you like you possess that sort of like trick shots,

25
00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:31.150
sperm that go quite like,
are you playing a game of horse?

26
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.350
All right,
you got to make the shot from over here and over here.
One of each.

27
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.670
Then you move onto the next round.
So that right there with,
you have five wives,

28
00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:43.730
one of each,
right?
If you're going to have kids and wants a boy and a girl,

29
00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:48.050
you're looking at 10 kids,
you're going to have 10 kids,
five wives.
I mean,

30
00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:49.910
how many bedroom house are you going to have to buy?

31
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.230
Basically what I'm saying is,

32
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:54.980
the reason why I've never run into one of these people with all the wives is

33
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.300
there's no way they can afford to live in the city.
You know,

34
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.040
you'd have to,
you'd have to rent out a whole floor of a fucking condom,

35
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.530
a skyscraper there,
condominium a Co op if you will.

36
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.290
So that's what it is.
That's where they are,
man.
They're,
they're all,

37
00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:13.990
they're all over the fucking hill there,
over the hill.

38
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.450
So I guess I'm never going to find them.
So you're probably saying,
well,
Bill,

39
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.400
what do you run into when you go to Salt Lake City?
Uh,
it's absolutely beautiful.

40
00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:24.730
Bit of a bit of a scary landing here.
Um,

41
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.620
the city itself seems to be surrounded on at least three sides by a mountain.

42
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.990
You know,
like the old Denver Broncos,
horseshoe shaped stadium where,
you know,

43
00:02:34.991 --> 00:02:36.190
when they'd go to kick the field goal,

44
00:02:36.191 --> 00:02:39.130
you could see the parking lot on one side and then all you saw was a bunch of

45
00:02:39.131 --> 00:02:43.000
fucking orange painted maniacs on the other.
Um,

46
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.010
by the way,
I never understood why they did that.
The horseshoe shaped stadium.

47
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.760
It was,
I just always struck me as such a half ass job where it's just like,

48
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.640
why don't you just finish the fucking thing?
You know?

49
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Or just keep bleaches on both sides have it be symmetrical.

50
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.733
You know?

51
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.460
I actually know somebody who builds a lot of shit and he sucks at it.

52
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.080
He's good at it,
but he sucks at he's,

53
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.300
he wants to do everything himself and protecting the identity of this person.

54
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.580
But the dude read did his fucking kitchen and I walked in and I'm,

55
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.780
I'm eyeballing the cabinets and you can see clearly one of the cabinets is like

56
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:27.520
an eighth of an inch or a half an inch.
Like it just looks weird.

57
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:30.850
You can tell that it's longer than the other one.
And the guys I guy and I don't,

58
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:33.930
I don't like symmetry.
I'm not,
I'm not into symmetry with

59
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.490
thinking in my head about who's not in dissymmetry.

60
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.270
I could see in landscaping,
it doesn't look natural.

61
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:46.000
If everything's symmetrical on both sides,
I get that.

62
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:47.260
But when you're building something,

63
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.240
say you're not a dissymmetry isn't for all my construction fans out people.

64
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.960
And then the construction arts is,

65
00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.130
and what that person is really saying that they don't like to measure or they

66
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:03.580
don't like to go back and fix their mistakes.
So they just sort of plow ahead.

67
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.090
That's basically what this fucking thing looked like.
And all I'm thinking is,

68
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.740
okay,
if that's what the cabinets look like,
what does the electrical look like?

69
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.200
You know?
And I immediately wanted to get the fuck out of there.
But anyways,

70
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.210
let me back up for a second here.
Um,
so when you come out here to Utah,

71
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.630
uh,
yeah,
so they got,
they got like,
I think it feels like it's,

72
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:29.080
it's surrounded on at least two sides.
All right.

73
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.940
Like that Winnipeg football stadium that I saw that,
I guess everyone is,

74
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.650
they're going to tear down.
Well,
they had bleachers on both sides,

75
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.060
nothing in either end zone,

76
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.440
and it just looked cold as fuck if you went to the game.
Um,

77
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.860
so it's,
you know,
and especially this time of year when it's a,

78
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.980
when it starts to get hot out,
I don't know why,

79
00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:49.960
but like it tosses you around a little bit as you,

80
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.220
as you come in for a landing and a,

81
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.240
so I'm on the plane and this fucking lady in front of me might've had the worst

82
00:04:57.551 --> 00:05:01.300
tattoo I've ever seen in my life and it went all the way across her back.

83
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.010
It was like this,

84
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.820
it was green ink and it was some sort of tree or some sort of something.

85
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.720
It's like Jesus Christ,
we get it.
You know,
you're fucked.
You like nature.

86
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.220
<v 0>Okay.</v>

87
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.400
<v 1>I don't understand.
It's like I liked the Bruins,</v>

88
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:20.250
but I would never get a giant be put on my back.

89
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

90
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.410
<v 1>What would you do that it stands for bill and the approach?</v>

91
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.470
No,
it stands for fucking moron.
Um,
it was just a horribly,

92
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.710
horribly like,
uh,
you know,

93
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.630
my parents left when I was four years old,
just drawn like,
you know,

94
00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:43.680
my buddy who sells meth,
you know,
did this tattoo.

95
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:47.100
And I've noticed that there are a lot of tattoos out here.

96
00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:51.270
A lot of bad fucking tattoo.
So if you're,
if you're on that show,

97
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.090
what does it fix my tattoo,
Tattoo mistakes,
whatever the hell it is.

98
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.370
That one where you guys always draw the flowers over,

99
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:04.220
you sending me Sam fucking daffy duck in the ass.
Whatever.

100
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:08.540
Somebody could decided to get on their butt cheek.
Right?
You'd come to Utah.

101
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

102
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.810
<v 1>I mean I,
I don't eat,
I don't even know what,</v>

103
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:14.540
why would you just further fuck the thing up?

104
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

105
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.230
<v 1>I guess the,
the guy gets,
because you're trying to draw something over it that,</v>

106
00:06:19.231 --> 00:06:21.600
that makes it creative.
I mean,

107
00:06:21.601 --> 00:06:25.650
I think that they should just paratroop a bunch of people in here who were in

108
00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:30.630
tattoo removal,
you know,
and uh,
just have like,

109
00:06:30.631 --> 00:06:30.840
you know,

110
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.720
when they dropped the tanks and with that flat piece of wood underneath it,

111
00:06:33.721 --> 00:06:38.210
just have the tattoo removal machine and you set up a tent like mash and he'd

112
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:43.200
just have all these people come in with their awful green tattoo tattoos and you

113
00:06:43.201 --> 00:06:48.030
just remove them and then you immediately take them into another 10 and you

114
00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:50.180
start showing them,
uh,
you know,

115
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.720
just video footage of what a good tattoo looks like,
you know,

116
00:06:54.721 --> 00:06:57.760
or maybe some art or maybe give him a plane ticket and you,

117
00:06:57.761 --> 00:07:01.870
and you get them to travel outside of,
outside of these fucking trees.

118
00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:05.190
So they stopped drawing them on their bodies.
So am I being too judgmental?
Am I,

119
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.160
well,
maybe all,
yeah,
I don't know.
You don't what this is,

120
00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:12.900
this really has nothing to do with the fucking two women that I saw in Utah with

121
00:07:12.901 --> 00:07:16.500
those tattoos.
So I judge all fucking,
you know,
whatever,

122
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.370
half a million women that live in the greater Salt Lake City area has really

123
00:07:20.371 --> 00:07:23.580
nothing to do with it.
Has to do with the fact that I am taping a special,

124
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.820
a standup special,
uh,

125
00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:30.960
this Friday night in Atlanta at the tabernacle,
three theater,
two shows.

126
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.760
And,
um,
I'm getting fucking antsy,
so I'm lashing out of people and that,

127
00:07:35.761 --> 00:07:37.860
so I apologize to,
you know,

128
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:42.890
the 99.5% of salt lake women that don't have fucking green tattoos.

129
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.740
I'm also being a cunt because I haven't booze since the day I came back from

130
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.820
France,
which was April 18th,

131
00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:02.820
uh,
coming up on fucking 60 days or whatever.
I'm working out,

132
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.250
I look good,
but I,
I,
you know,
as far as you know,
best I can do it.
46.
Okay,

133
00:08:08.251 --> 00:08:12.900
let's not get crazy here.
Okay.
Um,
I,
uh,

134
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.830
yeah,
I just want to take this fucking thing.
So,
um,

135
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.080
I get two more shows tonight here in Salt Lake City at wise,

136
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:23.580
which I gotta tell you,
man,
underrated,
underrated for the week.

137
00:08:23.581 --> 00:08:27.420
Wiseguys comedy club and Salt Lake City,
Utah.

138
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:32.340
And from what I heard Joe Rogan's coming out here in the next week or so.
Um,

139
00:08:32.341 --> 00:08:37.341
I guess Dave Attell was out here and went on Rogan's podcast and uh,

140
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.080
Joe's great podcast and you know,
and Dave was raving about this place.

141
00:08:41.081 --> 00:08:44.450
So Joe called up the next day and I guess he got a booking out here and uh,

142
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:49.800
so I dunno man.
I got it.
I can see why David towl was raving about it.

143
00:08:49.801 --> 00:08:50.101
It's just,

144
00:08:50.101 --> 00:08:54.960
it's perfect if I can say it's a fucking perfect comedy club that the ceiling,

145
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:59.070
that the exact rate height,
the way people are seated around you,

146
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.410
the way they dropped the checks,
the whole fucking thing.
It's just great.
Um,
if I,

147
00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:06.510
if I was actually going to design a comedy club,

148
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.290
did you just ask that from your fucking a elliptical machine?

149
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:15.030
You know what I would do?
I would do everything that they got there at,
uh,
at,

150
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:18.630
uh,
at,
at wise guys,
the only money,
the only thing I would change,
I would have,

151
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:22.890
I would design it with a grain room is right off the stage.
That way,

152
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:26.760
if it was a mean crowd and maybe only you almost got into a physical

153
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:28.140
confrontation with somebody,

154
00:09:28.141 --> 00:09:32.190
you have the option of not having to walk the gauntlet and go through the crowd

155
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.760
and you can just step right off stage and you're right into the green room.
Jim,

156
00:09:35.761 --> 00:09:38.880
much like the punchline in Atlanta,
which is great,

157
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.160
although you can't lock the door as far as I know,

158
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.180
but it's still nice.

159
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.360
There used to be a comedy club in New York City called comics and that thing was

160
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:54.600
a fucking fortress.
I guess you could run through the curtain,

161
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.620
but even then there was a door down the end of the hall.
You,

162
00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:01.200
you walked off stage and you step down immediately.
You are in a hallway.

163
00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:01.951
If you went to the right,

164
00:10:01.951 --> 00:10:05.460
you could go out and say hello to the crowd or you could go to the left and you

165
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:08.100
could disappear into the green room.
And,
uh,
you know,

166
00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:11.670
this week I haven't been coming out after shows just because,
you know,

167
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.090
I got my special coming up and uh,
you know,

168
00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:17.820
he'd go out and you shake a bunch of hands.
God knows people did,

169
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.880
God knows what is all over their fucking hands after you shake a bunch of hands.

170
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:27.990
And uh,
I,
I can't be getting sick this week,
so,
um,
so whatever.

171
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:32.940
That's what I've been doing this week than eating as perfect as I know how to

172
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:36.360
eat.
You know,
as I know,

173
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.190
that's the key thing is I know how to eat,

174
00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:41.520
cause I've only partially read up on nutrition,
but uh,

175
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.350
I'm trying to go veggie the whole time.

176
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:48.351
I'm out here and eat a bunch of beans and all I fucking Shit I got to tell you

177
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.030
is my pet peeve about veggie restaurants.
Two things.
One,

178
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.560
um,
when you look up vegetarian restaurants,

179
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.280
the amount of times that it comes up with like,

180
00:11:02.281 --> 00:11:05.280
I guess I don't,
I actually explained this to me.

181
00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:08.640
Why do I always get like Chinese restaurants and Thai food restaurants?

182
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.170
And to me it's like,
okay,
I get that there's no meat in that dish,

183
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:16.890
but this salt is through the fucking roof.
And don't get me wrong,

184
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.760
I love Thai food.
All right.
Chinese food.
I don't know.

185
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:26.100
I don't know.
All right.
Shiny shoots a little shady in my book.

186
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.970
Um,
but like,
you know,
I like eating.
That's that shit.
He,
you know,

187
00:11:30.971 --> 00:11:34.410
when you just like,
let's just fucking,
who gives a fuck?
Let's eat this food.

188
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.490
You know,
it's like when I,
when I asked her,
the fucking Siri,

189
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:41.430
their robot lady there,
my phone,
you know,

190
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.700
and I asked to said vegetarian restaurants,
Salt Lake City,

191
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:45.960
like all of a sudden all these,

192
00:11:45.961 --> 00:11:48.990
these Chinese and Thai restaurants come up and it's just like,

193
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:54.040
can't you tell I'm trying to eat healthy.
I don't need a of fucking noodles.

194
00:11:54.041 --> 00:11:57.550
Was Salt poured all over it.
That's not what the fuck I'm trying to do.

195
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.090
I'm trying to get down on my fighting weight here.
So anyway,
so then I,

196
00:12:02.091 --> 00:12:05.200
I had to go and like Vegan restaurants,
that type of thing.

197
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.540
Here's my pet peeve with Vega fucking restaurants.

198
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:12.700
The goddamn things have weird hours.
All right.

199
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:13.520
I,

200
00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.500
there's two of them within walking distance of my hotel and neither one of them

201
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:20.080
is open Sunday.
Neither one of them is open.

202
00:12:20.081 --> 00:12:24.820
Every fucking burger joint from here to fucking Colorado Springs is open.

203
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.480
God Damn Vegan restaurants,
how come they're not open on Sundays?

204
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:28.811
And you know what?

205
00:12:28.811 --> 00:12:33.811
A lot of carnivores would say it's because to a weekday a care they need to

206
00:12:33.971 --> 00:12:36.900
rush.
Judge started daycare it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

207
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.980
Nothing gives you less energy and less energy than eating in a healthy way.

208
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.740
That's,
I'm so fucking sick of that shit.

209
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:52.240
And people talking about electric cars look good.
They go up a hill,
you know?

210
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.810
That's why I'm really,
I'm starting to,

211
00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.950
I'm starting to pull away from the whole conspiracy theory thing.

212
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.100
I think the whole thing just works itself,
you know?

213
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.120
Because there's just enough people out there that know,
don't know shit.

214
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.460
Myself included.
Jesus Christ.
I'm top 10 on that list.

215
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.170
And you just,
it's just,
it's a,
yeah.

216
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.890
It's really not like a group of people live in under a mountain.

217
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.530
It's just a bunch of mouth breathing.

218
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.560
Morons or not even people who just died all fucking know anything.

219
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.880
You know,
like I've been talking about,

220
00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:31.260
I want to learn how to fly a helicopter and people keep saying [inaudible] to

221
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:35.260
that man.
Those things have fallen out of the sky all the time.

222
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.200
They're really all the time and everybody's okay with that.

223
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:48.000
Just every other Mary can't come into work today.
Yeah.

224
00:13:48.001 --> 00:13:52.890
Helicopter fell out of the fucking sky did happen to her again.

225
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.750
I mean,
don't get me wrong,
it fucking happens.

226
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.650
It happened in Scotland this past year of one fell on a bar.

227
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.870
Horrible story.
But I mean obviously,
I mean shit happens.
Okay Shit.

228
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.670
But Shit happens on the ground too.

229
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.510
You know how many times a day to people step on a rake,
right.

230
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.360
Does that mean you leave the leaves out there and burn up your grass?

231
00:14:12.361 --> 00:14:15.730
I don't think it does,
Dude.

232
00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:20.060
It's a fucking engine cuts out yet all that's it.
You fuck a dog?

233
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:25.080
You just dropped like a stone.
No,
you don't.
You don't.

234
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:30.910
Jesus fucking Christ.
Look it up.
Just look it up,
right?

235
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.000
You fucking auto rotate.

236
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.480
Like I'm saying that like I know how to do it.
Um,

237
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:41.610
although I have watched people on Youtube doing,
it's pretty,
it's pretty,
uh,

238
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.380
it's pretty fucking impressive for whatever,
whatever.
I'm,
look,

239
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:50.600
I'm by brain is all over the fucking place this week.
I

240
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.100
<v 0>okay.</v>

241
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.570
<v 1>Can't stand the weight the week of to do my special.
All right.
I am,</v>

242
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.950
I am ready right now.

243
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:02.510
I'm actually sitting here in my boxes and my t shirt and I am ready to throw in

244
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:03.740
some slacks and a shirt.

245
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:07.010
And if I walked out my hotel room and they just passed me on,

246
00:15:07.011 --> 00:15:10.970
Mike and my began my special,
nothing would make me happier.
All right.

247
00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:13.160
This is,
it's like I,

248
00:15:13.161 --> 00:15:16.430
it's like I just want to get out there and fucking do this God damn thing

249
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:21.110
because the second it's over.
Oh,
fucking red faces on vacation.

250
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.370
I'm on vacation.
Everybody for the first time.
Emma,
I'm taking,

251
00:15:25.371 --> 00:15:27.920
I'm taking the summer,
basically taking the summer off.

252
00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:32.480
I've got a couple of gigs here or there,
but I am,
I'm dialing it back,
you know,

253
00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:33.740
and by taking off the summer,
I mean,

254
00:15:33.741 --> 00:15:35.390
I'm not going to be jumping on a bunch of airplanes.

255
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.540
I'm going to be a course in the comedy clubs out here in La,

256
00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:41.300
trying to build up my next hour before my next special comes out.

257
00:15:41.301 --> 00:15:43.250
But I'll be sleeping in my own bed.

258
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.220
I'm going to be getting drunk in my own house.

259
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.440
I'm going to be putting on all the weight that I took off from my special in a

260
00:15:51.441 --> 00:15:52.760
neighborhood restaurants.

261
00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.940
I'm gonna have a great time becoming old Billy fat face again.

262
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.030
You know right now a malaria William.

263
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.333
<v 2>Okay,</v>

264
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.490
<v 1>now don't get too skinny.
I love it.
People say that to you.</v>

265
00:16:06.491 --> 00:16:07.840
Don't get to fucking skinny.

266
00:16:07.841 --> 00:16:12.820
It's like if I lifted up my shirt and you saw the horror show that's underneath

267
00:16:12.821 --> 00:16:16.060
it,
you're just used to me being really out of shape.

268
00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.490
Now I'm only kind of out of shape or right.
But believe me,

269
00:16:18.491 --> 00:16:22.120
Calvin Klein will not be calling me ever.
You understand?

270
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.390
Which really disappoints me because I think it's about time.

271
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:30.460
They did a spread of a 46 year old,
redheaded male shirtless.

272
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:35.090
Okay.
So if they're listening,
all right,

273
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.850
I'm throwing my fucking hat in the ring.

274
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:46.180
How bad,
how bad with this stock.
Plage yeah,

275
00:16:46.181 --> 00:16:46.580
either way.

276
00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:51.580
You'd never know because I used to watch a watch that top model show with Nia,

277
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.070
you know,
I mean I got to find a middle ground.

278
00:16:55.071 --> 00:16:58.970
So it's like if you're gonna Watch some reality,
at least I can look at some,

279
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:03.410
you know,
beautiful nine foot women walking around with a look on their face.

280
00:17:03.411 --> 00:17:07.910
Like you know somebody Pete and their Okra.
Right?
And uh,

281
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:09.300
<v 0>okay,</v>

282
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.960
<v 1>so many of them,
they will,
they,
they were beautiful bodies,
but they have faces.</v>

283
00:17:12.961 --> 00:17:17.490
They were fucking weird.
So I finally said to Nia,
I'm like,

284
00:17:17.491 --> 00:17:21.330
you know what the fuck is what,
why,
what is with her fucking,

285
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:26.280
she looks like she put on an astronaut helmet that was too small,
you know,

286
00:17:26.281 --> 00:17:30.390
when she left it on for like 24 hours and they just just pop the thing off right

287
00:17:30.391 --> 00:17:34.680
now,
you know?
And she's just like,
well,
you know,
Tyra likes,

288
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.010
she likes him.
She thinks they should be a little weird looking.

289
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:42.390
And I was just like,
what?
What,
why is that?
So she doesn't feel intimidated.

290
00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.513
<v 0>You know,</v>

291
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:46.081
<v 1>what's her problem?</v>

292
00:17:46.081 --> 00:17:48.870
She's been on the cover of sports illustrated or she tried to help other people

293
00:17:48.871 --> 00:17:51.900
because used to make fun of her forehead.
You know,

294
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.810
I love that people made fun of tire banks,
his forehead,
you know,

295
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.720
like if she came walking up to you,
right.

296
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.440
Doing that thing where one leg stepping over the other leg for some dumb reason.

297
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

298
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.170
<v 1>I,
you know something,
I have to be honest with you.</v>

299
00:18:06.171 --> 00:18:07.880
No matter how good a woman looked,

300
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.930
if they came walking up to me like that during the stepping over each other foot

301
00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:15.960
each,
you know,
every other foot,

302
00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:17.980
why would it fuck I'm trying to say right over left,

303
00:18:17.981 --> 00:18:21.760
left over right with that look on their face with their hair blowing.
Um,

304
00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:26.170
that's supposed to look so amazing.
If that actually happened to me in real life,

305
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.090
I would be sitting there looking at them.

306
00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.610
Do you guys ever see young Frankenstein?

307
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.210
<v 0>Okay.</v>

308
00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:34.300
<v 1>You know,
I remember when gene Wilder's going,</v>

309
00:18:34.301 --> 00:18:38.210
it said a lie is a lie,

310
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.180
you know,
and Frankenstein's just kind of sitting there looking at him like,

311
00:18:43.181 --> 00:18:45.650
what the fuck is wrong with this dude?
That that's how I would be looking at.

312
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:49.680
I'm not saying you know,
that they're not beautiful,
but whatever.
I'm,

313
00:18:49.681 --> 00:18:51.680
I'm fucking making too many left turns here.

314
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.970
I don't even know how it got to this.
I was talking about weird looking.
Oh yeah.

315
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.530
So I,
I'm weird looking.
I'm a weird looking fucker.
Who knows?

316
00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.680
Maybe it could have,
I know that it does that work.
Yeah,
I guess it does work.

317
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:10.860
I was thinking maybe it wouldn't work,
uh,
women into weird looking guys

318
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.550
and not from my experience.

319
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.540
No Kid.
That was kitten hope.
You know,
what are they into?
They want,

320
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.393
they want security.

321
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.520
And that translates to money because that's how the fucking world works.

322
00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:30.840
So are they really hoarse?
I Dunno when we return and I'm all right,

323
00:19:30.841 --> 00:19:34.230
I'm going to a pause here now actually don't have my advertising,

324
00:19:34.231 --> 00:19:36.300
so I'm gonna have to record it later and drop it in.

325
00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:40.350
So right now I have to pause so I have a place to fucking edit this into.

326
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:41.463
All right.

I hope I did a good job on it.
All right.

377
00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:48.170
Because I'm reading that sometime in the future.

378
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.963
<v 0>MMM.</v>

379
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.770
<v 1>So anyways,
I've been a,
you know,
with my fucking add,</v>

380
00:22:54.771 --> 00:22:56.170
I've been trying to learn how to,
you know,

381
00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.720
just work out more efficiently or fucking whatever.

382
00:22:59.721 --> 00:23:01.280
So I've been eating right and that type of thing.

383
00:23:01.281 --> 00:23:03.620
And I've gotten into all of these,
uh,
you know,

384
00:23:03.621 --> 00:23:05.750
I like climbing the rope and doing pull ups and shit.

385
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:09.620
And I stumbled onto a couple of youtube videos.

386
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.440
Of course I don't have them up here,
but I'll definitely send the links to uh,

387
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.250
to Andrew to have them up here.
Um,

388
00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:20.840
couple of these home home gyms you could have in the garage and um,

389
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.700
and,
and one,
this one,

390
00:23:22.701 --> 00:23:26.030
it's actually part is a three part series with this guy teaches you how to do a

391
00:23:26.031 --> 00:23:26.864
muscle up,

392
00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.580
which is basically if you ever saw somebody do the pull up and they basically go

393
00:23:31.581 --> 00:23:36.581
passage and up to their chest and then basically get to the point where they do

394
00:23:36.951 --> 00:23:39.710
a dip at the top of the bar,
that the,
the,
the,

395
00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:43.160
the other half of a dip because you don't have to go down because you start out.

396
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.860
Just explain that in a completely confusing,
you know what I mean?

397
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:51.310
You shoot pass the bar and then you push yourself up with your arms so your arms

398
00:23:51.801 --> 00:23:53.900
are then straight at the top of the bar.

399
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.110
And I remember the first time I tried to do that,

400
00:23:57.111 --> 00:24:01.680
if you could have listened to the [inaudible],
do you remember when,
uh,

401
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.500
what's his face?
William Wallace was getting his end trails yanked out.

402
00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:10.960
<v 0>Okay.</v>

403
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.420
<v 1>Okay.
Do you remember that noise Mel Gibson was making,</v>

404
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:18.700
if you could fucking take that audio and then turn it up to a,
you know,

405
00:24:18.701 --> 00:24:21.520
when they do the chipmunks holiday records.

406
00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:23.560
That's what I sounded like when I tried to do on,

407
00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:28.720
aside from the fact that I completely lack the strength,
um,

408
00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:29.740
my technique,

409
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:34.150
I didn't understand that very little of it.

410
00:24:34.151 --> 00:24:36.100
Is your arms going past that?
Uh,

411
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:40.120
that bar and I'm not even going to try to begin to explore why?
Well,

412
00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.820
my head was supposed to be funny on this one and I tried to explain it.

413
00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:47.020
It's basically you're calming up when you're,
when you're pulling yourself up,

414
00:24:47.021 --> 00:24:50.770
you sort of explode up and you got yet your legs are a little bit in front of

415
00:24:50.771 --> 00:24:53.860
you and then right as you,
you get your chest up to the bar,

416
00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:57.520
you do a quick shit up in the air,
I swear to God,

417
00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.600
which causes your legs to swing down like a down past.

418
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.440
You like a fucking pendulum and you actually roll up onto the bar.

419
00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:06.970
So it's really,

420
00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:10.870
it's your abs sitting up and then your legs swinging out from underneath you

421
00:25:10.871 --> 00:25:14.830
that gets you up over the bar and then your arms are in positions position to,

422
00:25:14.831 --> 00:25:18.670
uh,
to then push yourself up.
And it's like,
oh,
that's why I was fucking up.

423
00:25:18.671 --> 00:25:23.020
So I figure,
I figure if I just,
you know,

424
00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:28.300
train doing that for two months over the summer,

425
00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:33.520
trying to get my technique down right.
And then I somehow,

426
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.980
you know,
jump into the cocoon pool.

427
00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.950
I had to be able to do it by 2016 what do you think?

428
00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.130
Maybe do the human slag one of those fucking things.

429
00:25:42.131 --> 00:25:44.310
I'm just fascinated with people that have that kind of strength.

430
00:25:44.311 --> 00:25:47.140
And then I found a,
I don't know,
you just click on that.

431
00:25:47.141 --> 00:25:48.640
Then the other things that they suggest,

432
00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:51.790
I clicked on like five others and all of a sudden I was watching these guys

433
00:25:51.791 --> 00:25:56.380
climbing what was considered the hardest rock face to climb in the world.

434
00:25:57.070 --> 00:26:01.570
And these fucking guys,
I mean I bitch about doing pull ups,
you know,

435
00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:03.940
I got my whole hand around it.
These guys get like that,

436
00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.490
you know the little joint at the top of your finger.

437
00:26:06.491 --> 00:26:11.491
They're hanging on like that and they jump up to a thing and they like for their

438
00:26:11.621 --> 00:26:13.390
fingers,
that last little joint,

439
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.450
a grabbing some little crevice and I'm telling you,

440
00:26:16.451 --> 00:26:21.451
they reach up and they grab it and you and the people on the ground here all the

441
00:26:21.461 --> 00:26:24.160
way on the ground.
You have the guy jumps up and he grabs me just here,

442
00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.730
do that the whole fucking way up.
They got a grip called the pinch grip.

443
00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:37.870
Just imagine holding a dictionary or a really thick book,
right?

444
00:26:37.871 --> 00:26:41.140
And you just sort of would hold it straight down.
You know,
on either side of it,

445
00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:44.400
you're just holding it by the binding.
Yeah,
like that kind of a grip.

446
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:48.930
Like the lobster grip and the,
the thing is like,
it's uh,

447
00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:53.340
it's,
it's faced up and down.
What's the fucking word?
Perpendicular.

448
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:54.270
I have no idea.

449
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.260
It's looks like a nose coming out of the fucking cliff and they jump up and grab

450
00:26:58.261 --> 00:27:01.260
one of those and then just pinch with their fucking hand

451
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.260
and then they get one little toe cracked below it.
Just holding that.

452
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:13.020
I mean,
watching these guys do this shit.
I swear to God it's like these guys.

453
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

454
00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:19.130
<v 1>I mean I,
I don't know,
like if you ever had them in prison,</v>

455
00:27:19.131 --> 00:27:20.990
it's like how long could you keep them in prison

456
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.680
the second you got them in the yard,

457
00:27:24.681 --> 00:27:28.340
you'd have to have a fucking scope on them at all times because they would just

458
00:27:28.341 --> 00:27:31.590
fucking run over to the corner.
Well,

459
00:27:31.591 --> 00:27:34.710
we're one wall meets together wall and he's a little 90 degree turn.

460
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:36.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

461
00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.140
<v 1>They just kinda put all the way up the top of it.
Next thing.</v>

462
00:27:39.141 --> 00:27:40.370
You know that thing be right in your face,

463
00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:42.950
like that fucking grizzly bear that ran up that tree.

464
00:27:42.951 --> 00:27:47.020
Have you seen that youtube video?
This guy's sitting,
he's in a fucking tree.
Well,

465
00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:50.540
like a bow and Arrow trained on this black bear and the black bear looks up and

466
00:27:50.541 --> 00:27:55.520
sees him and within two seconds it runs up the tree next to him and is above

467
00:27:55.521 --> 00:27:56.320
them.

468
00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:56.710
<v 0>Okay.</v>

469
00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:00.880
<v 1>And they're sitting there like,
God,
dude,
what the fuck?
Holy Shit.
What the fuck?</v>

470
00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.580
They're like freaking out and I'm

471
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:04.660
<v 0>okay.</v>

472
00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.530
<v 1>I don't know why.</v>

473
00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:07.150
<v 0>Okay.</v>

474
00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:11.530
<v 1>I was rooting for the bear.
I wanted the bear to mall that guy.</v>

475
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:16.990
I just think it's fucked up to go out and shoot a bear or an elk or a moose.

476
00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.860
You know what I mean?
Can we just keep it with cows and chickens?

477
00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:22.443
Isn't that enough?

478
00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:23.470
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

479
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:24.303
<v 1>Fish.</v>

480
00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.320
<v 0>Okay.</v>

481
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.030
<v 1>Yeah.
All the fish to get fucking killed.
I swear to God,
I swear to God.
The more,</v>

482
00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.440
the more I,
I,

483
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:32.560
<v 0>okay.</v>

484
00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.750
<v 1>I don't know.
I look into that shit.
It's,
it's just brutal.</v>

485
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:40.090
You know where I go hiking in,
uh,
California when I hike.
And by the way,

486
00:28:40.091 --> 00:28:43.120
I do wear short shorts with aerobics socks.
When I hike

487
00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.550
there's a fucking mountain lion.

488
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

489
00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:52.060
<v 1>There's a mountain lion in the canyon</v>

490
00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.100
and that's been freaking me out.

491
00:28:55.101 --> 00:28:57.920
And they have these cameras set up all over the place and over the last couple

492
00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:58.840
of years of taking pictures of them,

493
00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:00.800
they just took a picture of the thing recently.

494
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:03.500
And I swear to God it looks horrible.

495
00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.740
And what they're speculating it happened,

496
00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:11.600
happened is to thing is eating coyotes that eat rats,

497
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:16.220
that eat the rat poison that people put out,
you know,
to kill the rats.

498
00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:20.930
And if you saw this thing,
you know,
I am terrified of getting malt.

499
00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.250
Okay?
I'm terrified of the ocean getting eaten by a shark,

500
00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.840
getting pulled up by the riptide and getting mauled,
any of that fucking shit.

501
00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:32.810
Any shit that involves me.

502
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:34.300
<v 0>Okay?</v>

503
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:38.530
<v 1>I just can't imagine when one of those cats is,</v>

504
00:29:38.531 --> 00:29:42.610
you're walking right?
Just reaches out and you okay.

505
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.600
Just in terms you wanted to like this rag doll,

506
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:51.550
how little fucking control you have,
your ability to fight back.

507
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.650
It's like,
dude,

508
00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:58.270
you're fighting fucking Edward Scissorhands but fast,
you know,

509
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.300
or like Freddy Krueger on all feet.
Just that alone.

510
00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:03.250
If it gets scratched by a fucking house cat.

511
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.820
<v 0>Okay.</v>

512
00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.080
<v 1>It fucking kills.</v>

513
00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.560
Can you imagine a god Damn Mountain Line just grabbing you and pulling you over

514
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:17.270
to it's fucking mouth.
Ah,
God.
Feeling that breath on your neck.

515
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:23.240
Jesus Christ.
I'm fucking terrified of those things.
That's just a mountain line,

516
00:30:23.241 --> 00:30:26.990
which is like a house cat compared to what?
Tiger.
Right.
So,

517
00:30:26.991 --> 00:30:29.930
but I saw the things face.
It's just like that.
That's terrible.

518
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:31.160
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

519
00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.690
<v 1>It's fucking terrible,
man.
So I don't know.</v>

520
00:30:33.691 --> 00:30:36.500
I'm not trying to get all pita on you here.
I didn't want to talking about it.

521
00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:41.090
I'm all over the fucking place this week.
Um,
so anyways,
I'm going to,

522
00:30:41.091 --> 00:30:43.740
I'm really want to get you guys those clips because uh,

523
00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:49.710
there's three clips I want to show you that it really inspired me to try and get

524
00:30:49.711 --> 00:30:50.700
back.
And you know,

525
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:56.080
I don't know if you just stop walking around with this 15 pounds of pizza and

526
00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:00.660
beer.
Wait,
just fucking sick of it.
You know,
I've knocked off like half of it.

527
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.010
I just don't understand how far down I got to go to have a flat stomach again.

528
00:31:05.011 --> 00:31:08.700
He can't even do it once.
You'll be,
once you get that fucking belly,

529
00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:13.050
it's just over and you try to fucking lose the weight and you just lose muscle

530
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.150
and no matter how you eat a hope,
God damn chicken,

531
00:31:15.151 --> 00:31:18.060
somehow you fucking arms are going to shrink.

532
00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:22.290
And you have Belize just going to be sitting there laughing at yeah.
Juggling.

533
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:26.580
You know,
it was funny actually got a fucking email this week

534
00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.430
and I know you guys are saying,
Jesus,
Bill,
you have made a major body issues.

535
00:31:31.431 --> 00:31:34.030
Yeah,
I do.
Well,
you know what,
why don't you get a good gig?

536
00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:36.500
Get on fucking comedy central's premium blend.

537
00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.770
Why don't you do that and then get yourself a fucking Twitter account and let me

538
00:31:39.771 --> 00:31:42.350
tell you what kind of body images you're going to have people on exactly.

539
00:31:42.351 --> 00:31:44.050
Nice to you.
Um,

540
00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:50.210
they start off nice,
a really funny shit,

541
00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.230
but what's the deal with?
And then you ended up getting like,
oh fuck,

542
00:31:54.231 --> 00:31:56.540
I never even noticed that about myself.
So anyways,

543
00:31:56.541 --> 00:31:59.960
here's somebody says a fat shaming bones Yogi,

544
00:31:59.961 --> 00:32:03.390
Ohm French for William Mary.
I actually knew that one.
Showing up.
How Keel,

545
00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.640
uh,
Ramo,
uh,

546
00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.710
I am a longtime listener and I love the show.

547
00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:13.730
I am a big guy and fat shaming works.
It really works.

548
00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:18.290
Last September I was sneaking a pizza in my car while listening to the show and

549
00:32:18.291 --> 00:32:22.250
you add another rant about fat people and you basically described exactly what I

550
00:32:22.251 --> 00:32:25.940
was doing.
Like you,
you were somehow watching me eat.

551
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:30.590
It made me laugh uncontrollably and I decided to get serious about losing
weight.

552
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.760
I quit boozing,

553
00:32:31.761 --> 00:32:36.050
which is something you're show inspired me to do and ate healthy and exercise

554
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.550
twice a day.
Uh,
I was off the bottle from until February.

555
00:32:40.551 --> 00:32:43.100
And spending the holidays sober was quite a challenge.

556
00:32:43.101 --> 00:32:46.880
But I got my weight down from three 10 to two 54 dote.

557
00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:51.680
Graduations,
what is that?
Let's do the math here for this guys.

558
00:32:51.681 --> 00:32:56.681
61 pounds times five miles of capillaries for every fucking pound.

559
00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.440
That's 305 miles of less of capillaries that your heart has to beat every time.

560
00:33:03.771 --> 00:33:07.740
Isn't that wonderful?
We'll be right back on Doctor Oz.
Sorry everybody.
Uh,

561
00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:11.510
I was pleased with my progress and I started working out less and resumed

562
00:33:11.511 --> 00:33:16.511
drinking til mid April when I weighed myself at two 73 so I gained 19 pounds in

563
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.360
about two and a half months of drinking.
I was shocked.
Therefore,

564
00:33:20.361 --> 00:33:24.860
I am off alcohol again and,
and,
and way to 43 now.

565
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:28.010
Holy Shit.
He says,

566
00:33:28.011 --> 00:33:31.280
my goal is to weigh to 10 before I drink again,

567
00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.840
please continue to make criticizing.
Uh Oh,

568
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:40.190
please continue to criticize the fat ass is because you do it in a hilarious yet

569
00:33:40.191 --> 00:33:44.420
respectful way.
Thank you for your help.
Oh Dude,
that's great man.

570
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:47.810
You know what's great about what you did was a lot of people,

571
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.930
if they went from three 10 to two 54 and they started,
you know,

572
00:33:50.931 --> 00:33:54.680
going back to that bad habits,
you then,
you know,
gain it all back.
And then some,

573
00:33:54.681 --> 00:33:58.290
I'm surprised you weren't three 20 self.
And so the fact that you actually,
uh,

574
00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:03.800
got back on the scale at two 73 shows a,
you got a lot of willpower,

575
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:08.040
then you dropped another 30 after that.
So what do you down altogether?

576
00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:13.070
Two 43 that's 57 and 10 is 67 pounds.

577
00:34:13.581 --> 00:34:17.180
Dude,
that's amazing man.
That's amazing.
Uh,

578
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.320
well if you go back to boozing,
what I would suggest is,
uh,

579
00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:24.530
drinking whiskey or Scotch neat.
You know,

580
00:34:24.531 --> 00:34:27.820
a drinking vodka on the rocks or something.
Just,
it's Kinda,

581
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.730
that's like the vaporizer of boozing.
You just get right to it.

582
00:34:31.731 --> 00:34:36.680
Like all those chick drinks,
um,
not only you,

583
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:38.270
the,
you,
you're,
you're sucking down,

584
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.700
you get a brutal fucking hangover first of all,

585
00:34:40.701 --> 00:34:44.960
and then it's just all this extra bullshit,
you know,
rum and cokes,
you know,

586
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:48.290
you have five rum and cokes.
Would you ever sit down and drink five cokes?

587
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:50.870
I can barely finish one.
Have to.
Wow.
It's,
it's,

588
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:55.880
I can feel my stomach expanding like him in some hot dog eating contest.

589
00:34:56.630 --> 00:35:00.560
Um,
so yeah,
I would go,
I would go back to that and then,
um,

590
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:06.140
I would somehow limits,
uh,
your intake of it,

591
00:35:06.141 --> 00:35:09.490
which I gotta be honest with you.
I don't know how to do because,
uh,

592
00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:13.250
speaking of boozing,
okay,
there's a segue for you.

593
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:15.890
Um,
so here's the deal.

594
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.280
I basically said I wasn't going to drink it til my special,

595
00:35:19.281 --> 00:35:22.700
so I'll be done with my special Friday night.

596
00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:27.110
And then I was kinda thinking like,
well,
you know what,
I want to close out June,

597
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:31.460
you know,
cause I didn't drink for the entire month of February or May.

598
00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:35.060
And if I get June then I'm kind of balanced out.
Right.

599
00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:39.450
I drank January,
March,
and April didn't drink February,
May and June.

600
00:35:39.451 --> 00:35:40.290
So I'm kind of,
you know,

601
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:45.300
I'm fucking got the ying and Yang of being a drug douche and actually being

602
00:35:45.301 --> 00:35:49.140
sober.
But,
uh,
the thing is,

603
00:35:49.141 --> 00:35:53.790
is the last weekend in June,

604
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:55.100
I'm at,
uh,

605
00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:00.060
I'm at the Mirage in Las Vegas and it's not going to be hard not to drink,

606
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:03.690
you know,
cause I don't,
I don't gamble.
You know what I mean?

607
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:07.860
I'm too fucking old to go hang out and do that type of shift.

608
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:08.790
If I'm going to booze,

609
00:36:08.791 --> 00:36:11.520
I would just go back and drink by myself in the hotel room,
which is,

610
00:36:11.521 --> 00:36:15.930
I'm not going to do.
However.
Excuse me,
how to take a drink of water there.

611
00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:20.430
Um,
coincidentally,
and I don't know how this happened.

612
00:36:20.431 --> 00:36:24.120
The all in tour starring Joe Barton,

613
00:36:24.121 --> 00:36:25.950
Nick,
Jason,

614
00:36:25.951 --> 00:36:30.210
law head and Paul don't say I'm from New Jersey.

615
00:36:30.211 --> 00:36:33.570
Versie is going to be there on the Sunday night.

616
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.330
I'm there Friday and Saturday.
I can't fucking believe it.

617
00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:40.080
They're going to be right across the street,
you know,

618
00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:44.310
so what am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
What?
What do,

619
00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.780
I'm not going to hang out with them.

620
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:50.190
And you know what's funny that's going to be like June 28th or 29th,

621
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.470
and uh,
the one at 1:00 AM I going to do,
you know,

622
00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:57.950
I got to do it.
So I'm going to go over there and uh,
I'll tell you where,

623
00:36:57.951 --> 00:37:00.060
it's funny as I've been dying for some Miller high life,

624
00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:03.530
there's something about the bottle.
I didn't think the beer tastes that good.

625
00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:07.680
It's just the best bottle ever.
You know,
it looks like a fucking lady

626
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:16.200
and there's a part of me to relate to you sir.
I don't want to go back.

627
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.160
I miss it man.
I fucking love drinking.
But uh,

628
00:37:20.161 --> 00:37:24.270
I like how I feel not drinking,
but,
um,

629
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.020
I dunno man.
As I said Diversey before,

630
00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:31.860
whatever the fuck I said about the devil in me,
the devil is a

631
00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.520
devil is rearing his fucking ugly head.

632
00:37:35.521 --> 00:37:39.000
I can't remember what the fuck I said to him,
but I,
I feel it like I need to.

633
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:43.470
What I'm hoping to do is just get absolutely plastered with them and then

634
00:37:43.471 --> 00:37:46.950
immediately go back to,
uh,
sort of,
uh,

635
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:50.940
not being an idiot and then actually doing these workouts that I was telling you

636
00:37:50.941 --> 00:37:53.790
guys about any of might think I'm obsessed with this stuff,
but I am,
I mean,

637
00:37:53.791 --> 00:37:56.760
who wants to be a fat fuck nobody,
you know,

638
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:59.160
don't you want to be in good question though.
All right.
Aren't,
I don't,

639
00:37:59.161 --> 00:38:01.500
I don't need to get into this shit with you guys.
You know,

640
00:38:01.501 --> 00:38:03.990
you're a bunch of adults.
Um,
yeah,

641
00:38:03.991 --> 00:38:07.740
I felt shamed myself all the fucking time and it fuck it works.
All right,

642
00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:10.620
well let's get beyond this.
Let's,
let's move in a different direction.

643
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.370
Let's read another,
uh,
wait,
before we do that,

644
00:38:14.371 --> 00:38:16.300
I haven't even talked about anything.
Let's swap out thought about,

645
00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:21.150
let's talk a little bit of hockey.
All right.
First and foremost,

646
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.670
all crown the La Kings,

647
00:38:23.671 --> 00:38:28.200
the kings claim the crown second time in three years.

648
00:38:28.201 --> 00:38:30.840
You know what's weird is I thought the Blackhawks were going to win it and they

649
00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:34.920
were going to say that they were going to be a dynasty.
Okay.
If they want three,

650
00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:38.350
cause that would have been 2010,
2014,

651
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:43.250
13 2014.
So they would have one,
one,

652
00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.910
they want one,
three and five years.

653
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:49.450
And they're saying how competitive with all the free agents signings and all

654
00:38:49.451 --> 00:38:54.010
that bullshit,
um,
three and five years would now be considered a dynasty.

655
00:38:54.011 --> 00:38:57.760
So guess who's in line for next year?
The unthinkable.

656
00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:59.890
The La kings a couple of years ago,
you know,

657
00:38:59.891 --> 00:39:01.690
we're actually more than that four fucking years ago.

658
00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.370
The La Kings fan base was thinking,
are we ever going to fucking win one?

659
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.670
I bet if you talked to their fan base,
they will probably go and like,
dude,

660
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:13.450
I just want to see him when it wants.
They just went at once in my lifetime,

661
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.180
I am going to be happy.
Yeah,
Yada Yada,
Yada Yada.

662
00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:20.560
And here we are four or five short years later.
If they win it again next year,

663
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:24.070
that would be,
let's see,
they would want it in,
uh,

664
00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:29.890
2012.
Then Chicago 1415,

665
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.440
they would have one,
three and four years where they get the Patriots a dynasty.

666
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.020
So that would definitely be considered a dynasty.

667
00:39:35.021 --> 00:39:38.170
And I know unbelievable what a fucking team,
you know.

668
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:41.290
And I also got to say hats off to the rangers cause everybody thought like the

669
00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:42.850
east was a lot weaker than they were.

670
00:39:42.851 --> 00:39:45.400
And despite the fact that they lost in five games,

671
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:50.950
I mean three of those ranger losses were an overtime.
Um,

672
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.900
I definitely think the kings were clearly the better team,
but I just being a,

673
00:39:55.901 --> 00:39:59.170
you know,
a Bruins Fan,
I was happy that the east,
you know,

674
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.670
we didn't get absolutely shelled.

675
00:40:00.671 --> 00:40:05.470
The only tough game it was if you arrange a fan to watch was that game a game

676
00:40:05.471 --> 00:40:09.160
three when they lost three to nothing where they really just got shut down and a

677
00:40:09.161 --> 00:40:11.110
game four I missed because I was working.

678
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:15.250
I think that's one of the Rangers won two to one,
but whatever man,
it was great.

679
00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.100
It's a great season.
And um,

680
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.990
Jim Rome actually tweeted something where he said,
uh,
you know,

681
00:40:22.991 --> 00:40:26.050
once something to the,
I retweeted it,
something to the effect that once again,

682
00:40:26.051 --> 00:40:28.630
the Nhl playoffs just show,
you know,

683
00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.790
just saying that basically that they were the best playoffs.

684
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.820
Now I'm not going to be someone who says that.
I mean I think they are,

685
00:40:33.821 --> 00:40:38.410
but I understand if it's not your sport,
but I'm telling you it's fucking insane.

686
00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:40.090
Um,
but however,

687
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:44.650
I have also been watching the NBA finals and I actually watched both conference

688
00:40:44.651 --> 00:40:47.030
finals and I've been enjoying that too.
And,
uh,

689
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:51.070
how bout them spurs look into close at home and you guys know whether they did

690
00:40:51.071 --> 00:40:55.810
or not.
Um,
I won't know because a,
it's the fucking afternoon here.

691
00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:59.850
By the time I post this,
I dunno who the fuck knows.
All I know is,
uh,

692
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:04.720
it's been amazing to watch the spurs fucking great team.

693
00:41:04.721 --> 00:41:08.380
How about that Leonard Kit?
Jesus Christ.
You know what I like about him?

694
00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:11.140
The one clip that I saw,

695
00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:16.350
he shows up to the arena looking like he's going to go play basketball as

696
00:41:16.781 --> 00:41:20.920
opposed to everybody else who for some reason show they show up like the,

697
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:23.110
they're going to fucking foreclose on somebody's house.

698
00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:29.100
Why do they wear the suits?
It's like if you're to wear the suit,

699
00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:33.130
then you ought to do it.
Like,
uh,
you know,
Walt Frazier,

700
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:36.660
you know,
and I'm using that reference cause I actually,
yeah,

701
00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.030
I'm going to get a little Hollywood on you,

702
00:41:38.031 --> 00:41:42.200
but I'm doing it because I'm promoting a friend of mine's a

703
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:45.590
new documentary.

704
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:51.350
Michael Rapaport was nice enough to invite me to the premiere of a screening of

705
00:41:51.351 --> 00:41:51.761
it.
He's that.

706
00:41:51.761 --> 00:41:56.761
He's got a new documentary out called when the garden was Eaton based on a book

707
00:41:58.431 --> 00:42:01.980
by the same name that was about the 70,
um,

708
00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:06.020
and 73 New York knick championship teams and basically the building of that

709
00:42:06.021 --> 00:42:10.880
championship team and um,
all his lot of overlap when I actually,

710
00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:16.220
you know,
just knowing some of the rangers history,
the same thing where,
um,

711
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.030
the Knicks just weren't even respected.
And that same thing,

712
00:42:20.031 --> 00:42:23.420
just like the New York Rangers,
like right around when playoff time came around,

713
00:42:23.421 --> 00:42:27.410
Madison Square Garden also brought the circus and the circus would sell more

714
00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:31.670
tickets than the ranges of the next wood.
And uh,

715
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:35.120
so they would have to play like one year that the New York Rangers,

716
00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:37.970
I forget it,
what the fuck they were playing.

717
00:42:37.971 --> 00:42:40.120
I think they were playing the Detroit Pistons,

718
00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:42.830
the Detroit Redwings jumping sports here.

719
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:47.810
The Detroit Redwings in the Stanley Cup final and the circus was in town in

720
00:42:47.811 --> 00:42:48.800
Madison Square Garden,

721
00:42:48.801 --> 00:42:52.940
wouldn't let them play their home games in Madison Square Garden.

722
00:42:52.941 --> 00:42:54.080
So they actually had in play,

723
00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:57.080
I believe it was in maple leaf gardens with the Toronto Maple leafs played.

724
00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:01.760
They considered that somewhat of a home game because leaf fans hated a wings

725
00:43:01.761 --> 00:43:04.970
fans and they thought that leaf fans maybe would show up and root for the

726
00:43:04.971 --> 00:43:08.670
rangers.
Um,
there's a lot of that type of stuff.
Um,

727
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.690
you really should see it if you get a chance.
I don't know.

728
00:43:11.691 --> 00:43:12.950
I don't have a premiere date yet,

729
00:43:12.951 --> 00:43:17.090
but I'm going to try to get him on the podcast again.
Longtime listeners.

730
00:43:17.091 --> 00:43:21.620
Remember his last is only visit to the podcast where he trashed me for the

731
00:43:21.621 --> 00:43:24.530
giants beat and the Patriots in the Superbowl and all New York fans of course,

732
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:28.730
enjoy,
enjoyed that.
Go Fuck Yourself.
But um,
it's,

733
00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:31.460
it's a fucking amazing documentary.

734
00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:35.570
And one of the funniest things about it without giving anything away is

735
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:40.571
listening to Rapaport trying to debate these guys and to trashing Boston and

736
00:43:41.481 --> 00:43:44.450
their fans.
It's fucking hilarious.
Um,

737
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:47.660
so he definitely check it out.
It's going to be on,
he did.

738
00:43:47.661 --> 00:43:51.440
It was one of those ESPN 30 for 30,
60 for 60.
I don't know what the hell it is,

739
00:43:51.441 --> 00:43:53.660
but it's,
it's amazing.
It's called when the garden was eating.
All right.

740
00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:58.880
Is That my horn out?
Enough things this week?
You know,
how about this,

741
00:43:58.881 --> 00:44:03.881
I got another one for you that I actually watched downloaded legally paid my $5.

742
00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:09.080
I watched David spades new stand up special called my fake problems.
Um,

743
00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:13.280
definitely check that one out.
What I loved about it was I actually,
you know,

744
00:44:13.281 --> 00:44:16.670
it's still his,
you know,
classic David Spade,

745
00:44:16.671 --> 00:44:20.630
but I felt it was really personal stuff.
Um,

746
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:25.130
like I,
I easily his best specialties ever put out.

747
00:44:25.131 --> 00:44:28.220
So if you're a fan of his or a new fan or curious man,

748
00:44:28.221 --> 00:44:32.430
it was definitely worth the five bucks.
Um,
and that's,

749
00:44:32.431 --> 00:44:35.130
that's one of my bucket list things.
I want to see that guy live at some point.

750
00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:38.730
But anyway,
so let's go,
let's get back to the,
let's get back to the podcast here.

751
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:41.910
Um,
what else?
What else have I been doing here?

752
00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:44.340
I've been watching some world cup soccer.

753
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:48.120
My fucking TV just went out in the hotel room,
so I was watching France.

754
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:53.670
They were up three,
three to nothing trois to a zero.

755
00:44:53.671 --> 00:44:58.440
Whoever the fuck you say zero.
And uh,
I dunno,
I get into the World Cup.

756
00:44:58.441 --> 00:45:02.030
I think it's fucking awesome.
And I do think soccer was a beautiful sport.
Uh,

757
00:45:02.031 --> 00:45:04.240
I just don't understand why my co,

758
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.750
my complaint that I've always had with that fucking sport,

759
00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:09.690
I don't give a shit about the lack of goals.
Shit.
I watch hockey.

760
00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.630
I still understand,
understands it's think it's awesome.

761
00:45:12.631 --> 00:45:17.631
I just don't understand why every fucking two minutes somebody collapses to the

762
00:45:17.791 --> 00:45:18.121
ground.

763
00:45:18.121 --> 00:45:21.450
Like they blew out their ACL and all they did was get kicked in the Shin and

764
00:45:21.451 --> 00:45:22.710
they have a Shin Guard there.

765
00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:25.440
Now I'm not saying that I wouldn't collapse to the ground,

766
00:45:25.441 --> 00:45:28.680
but I'm not a professional athlete.
You watch the fucking UFC,

767
00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:33.810
those fucking maniacs kick the other fighter with that part of their leg.

768
00:45:33.811 --> 00:45:36.270
Now I know they come in at an angle,
but it's still his shin.

769
00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:40.860
Now if they can toughen their leg up to do,
to do that,
you know,

770
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:45.570
I don't understand why these guys can you make the fucking guard go all the way

771
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:49.410
around their legs so we can keep the movement going.
So I don't know.
I mean,
I,
I,

772
00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:53.850
I don't know.
My idea of watching the sport is not every two minutes I see a man,

773
00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:58.350
a grown fucking man in the fetal position with a look on his face.

774
00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:02.430
Like he's going to start crying and then somebody comes running up to another

775
00:46:02.431 --> 00:46:05.310
player,
gets right in his face.
Like he's going to punch him and you're like,
oh,

776
00:46:05.311 --> 00:46:06.570
great is going to be a fight.

777
00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.840
And then he takes out this yellow card and sticks it up in the air.

778
00:46:09.841 --> 00:46:14.520
Like he's in some Benny Hill sketch.
Other than that,
I love it.
The scarves,

779
00:46:14.521 --> 00:46:18.030
the singing,
people going absolutely fucking nuts when they score.

780
00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.490
I enjoy all of that.
So I'll continue watching it.

781
00:46:20.491 --> 00:46:23.130
And this year is actually great to now that they,
uh,

782
00:46:23.131 --> 00:46:24.900
they got it away from those crazy horns,

783
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:30.180
whatever the fuck and those things we'll call
know Jesus was Hulu.

784
00:46:30.181 --> 00:46:33.660
Fuck's calling me now?
Huh?
Who is this?
Oh Jesus.

785
00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:39.390
Hang on the lovely Nia.
Everybody.
Nia,
I'm recording my podcasts.

786
00:46:39.391 --> 00:46:43.260
Can I call you right back?
Okay,
Sweetie.
All right.

787
00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:45.723
<v 0>MMM.</v>

788
00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:51.970
<v 1>Anyways,
where are we here?
43 minutes.</v>

789
00:46:51.971 --> 00:46:56.290
And I could tell by the way she said,
okay,
that I need to talk to her.
She's like,

790
00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:57.573
okay.

791
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:05.500
Oh Geez.
All right.
Um,
what was I talking?
World Cup soccer.

792
00:47:05.501 --> 00:47:08.500
So I have no idea who's gonna win that.
All I know is I think that,
you know,

793
00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:13.760
I think I've watched enough soccer to tell it to know that,
you know,

794
00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:17.660
the United States is definitely without a doubt going to make the finals this

795
00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.860
year.
If not when the whole fucking thing.
Okay,

796
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:26.510
look,
I know they're not going to win it,
but I just,
I want them to,

797
00:47:26.511 --> 00:47:31.390
when it's so bad because it piss off the world on two levels.
One,

798
00:47:31.391 --> 00:47:32.670
everybody fucking hates us.

799
00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:37.030
So then I can enjoy us actually winning a true world championship where

800
00:47:37.031 --> 00:47:40.450
everybody was invited and we were the best.
And then secondly,

801
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:45.370
when like 40 people show up to the parade,
you know,

802
00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.350
here in the United States,

803
00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:51.850
just to watch everybody having to wait another four years to wait for their team

804
00:47:51.851 --> 00:47:54.970
to win it and just see that we want something that we don't even give a fuck

805
00:47:54.971 --> 00:47:58.690
about.
Right.
Like some hot chick that gets a fucking,
you know,

806
00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:01.480
a Bentley for fucking 16th birthday.

807
00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:02.670
<v 0>Okay.</v>

808
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:07.000
<v 1>And I god,
why did you get that color?
I guess it's okay.
You know,</v>

809
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:10.870
that would be us if we ever won the fucking World Cup and I want it to happen.

810
00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:15.000
I really do.
Um,
anyways,

811
00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:20.310
the same way I wanted my team to draft Michael Sam and I wanted to absolutely

812
00:48:20.561 --> 00:48:25.561
dominate because on two level levels it would annoy fence one that someone on my

813
00:48:25.961 --> 00:48:30.961
team was dominating their team and then to all the homophobes would be upset

814
00:48:31.421 --> 00:48:33.460
that this gay guy was just wreaking havoc.

815
00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:40.840
All right.
Oh,
speaking a soccer,
uh,
dear Billy worldclass.

816
00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:45.770
Um,
oh,
actually,
you know,
I got to pause here to reach recent more fucking,
uh,

817
00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.860
sorry guys to read some more fucking advertise.

818
00:48:47.861 --> 00:48:50.830
This is the last little group here.
Let me do my little pause.

819
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.020
All right.
Who's number two?

820
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:59.330
When the order a dollar shave club,
everybody,

821
00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:04.430
the big razor company.
You know what?
They think we're stupid.

822
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:05.780
Oh yeah.

823
00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:10.730
Every year they roll out some ridiculous shaving technology gimmick and expect

824
00:49:10.731 --> 00:49:15.350
us to shell out big bucks for it.
What are they up to?
17 blades at this point.

825
00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:19.400
All lifting and separating like a bra in the 70s.

826
00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:23.610
Do you really need a razor with a vibrating handle?
Huh?
Well,

827
00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:28.330
a roller pivot ball.
Backscratcher egg timer laser pointer corkscrew.

828
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.740
Huh?
I know I don't,
we were shaving just fine before any of that crap.

829
00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:36.920
We were two blades.
That was all you have needed.
Uh,

830
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:39.470
you could get it on to get knows they got so many blades.

831
00:49:39.471 --> 00:49:42.310
You can't even shave onto your nose.
Um,

832
00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:45.500
and I definitely don't think I need to spend my hard earned cash on a people.

833
00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:49.130
It's a bunch of junk.
If you're sick of being treated like a full,
like a whore,

834
00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.590
like an idiot,
a moron,
a sucker or chump.

839
00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:08.900
You know what?
I have sensitive skin,

840
00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:12.770
so watch what you say about it when you're around it and their razors have never

841
00:50:12.771 --> 00:50:14.660
given me any problems.
Honestly,

842
00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:19.010
I have the best shape of my life with their four x razor.
You got to try it.

843
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:23.070
I've never used that.
Stop putting words in my mouth.
I like the double blade.

844
00:50:23.071 --> 00:50:24.170
She got this sweetheart.

845
00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:28.610
I told my buddy about the dollar shave club that would be guys and he shares a

846
00:50:28.611 --> 00:50:33.110
subscription with his wife.
No life.
I think it's saved their marriage.

847
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:36.140
Dollar Shave Club.
Why are you writing all this crap?

848
00:50:36.141 --> 00:50:40.820
You have a product that sells itself.
Quit trying to make me sound more personal.

849
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:45.860
All right.
It's personal.
The way I fuck up the reed.
Okay.

00:50:58.071 --> 00:51:01.820

Dollar Shave club.com/burr a shave club.

858
00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:16.730

859
00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:19.910
Dollar Shave club.com/bar.

<v 1>I don't even understand what it is.</v>

864
00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:31.200
Dollar Shave club.com/ [inaudible] that's what it is.
B U.
R.
R.
Okay.

865
00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:36.030
This,
it's legitimate.
We don't need any bells and whistles on the snake.

866
00:51:36.031 --> 00:51:38.640
Just join it.
Okay.
Unless you want to keep getting screwed.

867
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:39.950
<v 0>Okay.</v>

868
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:42.860
<v 1>All right.
If you like to be Gillette's prison bitch,</v>

869
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:45.410
keep doing what you're doing.
Oh God.
Look at that.

870
00:51:45.411 --> 00:51:48.920
Look at that little thing I just opened up.
Those are my French words.

871
00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:51.620
I stuck with it for two months now.
I don't remember any of them.

872
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:58.660
Okay.
And I'm back here.
All right.
Um,
all right,

873
00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.790
dear Billy,
world class,
uh,

874
00:52:01.791 --> 00:52:04.760
I don't hate on soccer even though I have a problem with it.

875
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:06.590
There are some great things about the game.

876
00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:09.470
Sometimes I wish I played it because it automatically,

877
00:52:09.471 --> 00:52:14.060
it would mean I'd have great hair and abs apparently.
Uh,

878
00:52:14.061 --> 00:52:17.150
what pros and cons would you say there are to the game of soccer?

879
00:52:17.151 --> 00:52:19.560
I think I already answered this.
I,
you know,

880
00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:23.690
I just love out the whole world,
loves it and we don't love it.

881
00:52:23.691 --> 00:52:27.440
And then we have the nerve to sit there criticizing it rather than sitting back

882
00:52:27.441 --> 00:52:30.650
going,
hey,
maybe we're wrong about this.
You know,

883
00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:35.120
like the whole world's on like the fucking metric system and we're,
we're not,

884
00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.280
you know,
God,
I know you were going to stick with the,
uh,

885
00:52:37.281 --> 00:52:42.230
the foot in the FEC and yachts.
So,

886
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:46.190
uh,
anyways,
let's,
I'm,
let me hear what your complaints are.
Um,

887
00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:49.280
let's see.
He says,
uh,

888
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:53.690
my biggest complaint other than the pratfalls and woosie injuries,

889
00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:55.760
is that well do it well,
I gotta be honest with you.

890
00:52:55.761 --> 00:52:59.990
If somebody is running full speed and steps on your,
your foot with a cleat,

891
00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:02.390
I mean,
that's got to fucking hurt.
I mean,
that's up there.

892
00:53:02.391 --> 00:53:05.820
That's like taking an Arista off your laces.
Um,

893
00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.780
is the fact that the reps control when the game ends,

894
00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:13.400
they don't end the game until a play is over despite what the clock says.

895
00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:15.800
Uh,
no,
that's,
that's the,
uh,

896
00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:19.880
penalty minutes when all those guys rolling around on the ground.

897
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:23.420
So to have you relate to it,
that's like a snow day.

898
00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:27.540
If you get a snow day in like elementary school,
you still have to go 180 days.

899
00:53:27.541 --> 00:53:29.070
So they just tack on an extra day.

900
00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:32.310
You are going to get out of school on June 20th.
Now it's the 21st.

901
00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:36.450
That's how it works.
They keep track of the time.
He says,
however,

902
00:53:36.451 --> 00:53:41.430
and a game yesterday I watched a possession changed twice and a yellow card

903
00:53:41.431 --> 00:53:45.090
being issued.
Uh,
he puts in parentheses,

904
00:53:45.091 --> 00:53:48.810
someone's stubbed their toe.
And the rep still didn't stop the game.

905
00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:51.270
You think NBA reps can mess with the game?

906
00:53:51.271 --> 00:53:55.470
The soccer reps got a few weapons of their own.
Um,

907
00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:58.980
yeah,
I guess,
yeah,
I guess they can.
Why was,
when I talk about that,

908
00:53:58.981 --> 00:54:02.670
I talk about the four major American sports,
the United States of America,

909
00:54:02.671 --> 00:54:06.900
what I'm talking about.
But uh,
yeah,
I guess you can give people yellow cards,

910
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:08.790
give them two yellow cards.

911
00:54:08.791 --> 00:54:13.791
But I feel like the crowd kind of keeps the ref in check where,

912
00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:15.690
you know,

913
00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:20.690
I can NBA Ref consider player and uh,

914
00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:23.670
you know,
I dunno if it was a big enough games,

915
00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.790
maybe he'd get a couple of death threats,
but you know,

916
00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:30.390
in the soccer world they'll actually carry,
they'll actually kill you.

917
00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:34.980
They'll actually run out into the field and like fucking saw your head off.

918
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:39.990
Um,
there was something horrific that happened down in South America.

919
00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:44.130
We'll just like 20 year old ref.
First of all,

920
00:54:44.131 --> 00:54:47.220
he had a knife on him so he can tell you what kind of a fucking horrific

921
00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:50.130
refereeing job he knew he was going into.

922
00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:53.460
And he got into it with some guy and I don't know what happened,

923
00:54:53.461 --> 00:54:58.320
but he took out a knife and he stabbed this guy and I believe the guy died.

924
00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:01.390
And then his brother,
the dude who died,

925
00:55:01.391 --> 00:55:04.830
his brother and everybody else ran onto the field and they cut the dude's head

926
00:55:04.831 --> 00:55:08.610
off on the fucking soccer field,
you know?

927
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:14.090
And we flip out when Ron Artest goes into the crowd and throws 15 punches and

928
00:55:14.401 --> 00:55:18.120
doesn't connect once basketball players are the worst.

929
00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:21.030
They can't draw a fucking,
you know what it is?

930
00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:23.820
It's because they were nine feet tall in the third grade.

931
00:55:23.821 --> 00:55:28.170
They didn't have to fight.
I,
some of the shorter guys,
this six foot ones,

932
00:55:28.171 --> 00:55:32.820
you know,
they knew how to fight,
but I swear to God,
first of all,

933
00:55:32.821 --> 00:55:35.760
they'd throw punches like they're trying to throw somebody out from like the

934
00:55:35.761 --> 00:55:40.000
warning track.
They do that overhand fucking,
a lot of them,
lot of them,
they,

935
00:55:40.001 --> 00:55:42.600
they uh,
I don't know what the deal is.

936
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:47.070
That would be fucking scary,
right?
If you actually learned some martial arts.

937
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:52.770
I know Kareem Abdul Jabbar tried to act like he did in those Bruce Lee movies,

938
00:55:52.771 --> 00:55:57.771
or maybe a will Chamberlain in a Conan the barbarian.

939
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:02.490
Did he fight in that thing?
And he just sort of sit on that fucking Yak?

940
00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:07.170
I can't remember.
Um,
anyways,
I don't,
I don't really,
uh,

941
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:12.030
I'm not gonna criticize a,
I'm not gonna Criticize World Cup soccer.

942
00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:13.140
The whole fucking world loves it.

943
00:56:13.141 --> 00:56:15.480
I understand that there's something wrong with me.
And you know,

944
00:56:15.481 --> 00:56:17.100
I went to a game when I was over in England,

945
00:56:17.101 --> 00:56:20.070
went to that arsenal game and the knock,
a lot of it was the shit.

946
00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:25.000
It was the shit.
We just don't have enough time
to get into it.

947
00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:27.770
You know,
like I would say if,
if you're,

948
00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:30.460
if you're into sports in the United States,

949
00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:34.600
you're into football and you're in the basketball for them,

950
00:56:34.601 --> 00:56:37.480
or you're into football and you were into hockey.
All right,

951
00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:40.330
and maybe you watch a little bit of baseball.
That's how,

952
00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:42.430
that's kind of where the pendulum is right now.

953
00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:46.240
But there's very few people that can actually watch hockey and basketball at the

954
00:56:46.241 --> 00:56:51.050
same,
like the,
the amount of space that would be taken up on your fucking Divia.

955
00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:56.320
Right.
I used to do it back in the day though,
back in the 80s,
man,

956
00:56:57.110 --> 00:57:00.340
we had bird,
mchale,
Robert Parish,

957
00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:07.400
you know,
fucking uh,
Dennis Johnson,
Cedric Maxwell,

958
00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:11.060
m l cow,
right.
And then the Bruins

959
00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:15.120
all through the eighties to the ending of Stan,

960
00:57:15.121 --> 00:57:19.740
Jonathan Wayne Cash Terrio Riley and to Cam Neely Raymond Bork,

961
00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:25.340
right,
Gord clues,
exec Willie Plett,
Linden bias,

962
00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:27.030
all of those fucking guys.

963
00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:30.800
You didn't want to miss a game least I used to just,

964
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:32.470
<v 0>okay,</v>

965
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:34.430
<v 1>so all you did,
just that,</v>

966
00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:39.730
that's why I suck so bad in school side from the fact that I was dumb was,

967
00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:45.130
you know,
the beginning of the year,
school year,
it was football season.

968
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:49.180
So that fucked half my weekend right through January.

969
00:57:49.181 --> 00:57:52.360
And by January I was in the throes of hockey and basketball season.

970
00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:56.290
That shit ended around May.
And then it was June.
And then I would just say,
hey,

971
00:57:56.291 --> 00:58:00.760
you know,
maybe I'll try next year,
you know,

972
00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:05.590
and then what happened?
Then I'd go to summer school,
summer school,

973
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:07.870
what a fucking great time that was.

974
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:10.990
Why don't you just got past the fact that you was still going to school?

975
00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:14.080
What you really,
what you realize that you are now into this,

976
00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.720
you boiled like,

977
00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:20.860
it's like when you reduce something by heating it up and they basically,

978
00:58:20.861 --> 00:58:24.880
they boiled off all the fucking nerds,
all the people that applied themselves.

979
00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:29.950
And what you were left with was this high concentration of class clowns and

980
00:58:29.951 --> 00:58:34.120
absolute psychos.
And it was the,
I mean it was the best fucking,

981
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:39.150
there was like going to a goddamn comedy camp and where I went to summer school,

982
00:58:40.121 --> 00:58:41.470
it was like three towns.

983
00:58:42.010 --> 00:58:46.960
So you met these class clowns from three different towns and everybody kind of

984
00:58:46.961 --> 00:58:50.920
had their own fucking style and you had to up your game.

985
00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:55.300
I know I've told these stories before I,
they would,

986
00:58:55.301 --> 00:59:00.301
just that time the guy poured the coke out on the guy mowing the lawn during the

987
00:59:01.061 --> 00:59:04.540
break and we all ran and we sat down and then I fucking teacher came in who was

988
00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:07.570
wearing Bermuda shorts.
I swear to God and I think they were pink.

989
00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:11.500
He starts to lessen and all of a sudden the guy was mowing the lawn comes in,

990
00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:12.793
he's got,

991
00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:16.600
he had on a white tee shirt and the coke had made brown stains all over the

992
00:59:16.601 --> 00:59:17.434
front of it.

993
00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:21.200
It just comes barging in and the fucking Bermuda short teach looks at like,

994
00:59:21.201 --> 00:59:23.060
what the fuck?
He goes,
hang on a second.

995
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:26.570
And he walks all the way to the back of the class and he sticks his fucking,

996
00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:31.070
he had a square and rectangle head all at the same time like a Fred Flintstone

997
00:59:31.071 --> 00:59:33.140
had.
He sticks it sideways through,
you know,

998
00:59:33.141 --> 00:59:35.150
those school windows and then looks down,

999
00:59:35.151 --> 00:59:38.720
he sees the puddle of coke right underneath the window and he's like,
yeah,

1000
00:59:38.721 --> 00:59:40.770
this is yet which one of,

1001
00:59:40.771 --> 00:59:44.300
you'll throw the coke out at me and we're all just laughing,

1002
00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.420
laughing our ass off.
And then,
uh,
you know,

1003
00:59:47.421 --> 00:59:49.340
the kid who did it admits that he doesn't give a fuck.

1004
00:59:49.341 --> 00:59:51.740
He's not afraid of the principal,
you know,

1005
00:59:51.741 --> 00:59:54.200
he's on a first name basis with the guy and it was just like,

1006
00:59:55.640 --> 01:00:00.560
it was a great time.
Other than losing your summer,
you know,
Blues Kitten,
hope,

1007
01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:04.400
you know,
I'm a red head.
What was going to be out there sunbathing.
Um,
all right,

1008
01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:08.960
continuing on.
All right.
Uh,
this is somebody talking about last week,

1009
01:00:08.961 --> 01:00:13.340
daughter or gay son.
Whore question from last week.
Uh,
dear Billy,

1010
01:00:13.341 --> 01:00:14.270
friend of gay,

1011
01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:18.530
I'm a gay male and Alyssa and a listener,

1012
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:23.330
most of the issues that come up in everyday life pertained to the gay community

1013
01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:26.300
are overblown.
I came out in the early nineties.

1014
01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:29.720
I was a bit more emotional and defensive about things back then because the

1015
01:00:29.721 --> 01:00:33.350
climate was very aggressive towards gays.
Um,

1016
01:00:33.351 --> 01:00:36.860
the truth is we only have a re we have come a really,
really long way.

1017
01:00:36.861 --> 01:00:38.420
It doesn't mean that the prejudice has gone,

1018
01:00:38.421 --> 01:00:43.180
but it's a place where there what,
where,

1019
01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:43.790
uh,

1020
01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:48.080
where the general consumer consciousness of the country is in a much healthier

1021
01:00:48.081 --> 01:00:52.710
place.
Um,
last week,
uh,
Rita ass,
who a,

1022
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:57.250
which you'd have a whore of a daughter or a gay son.
Uh,

1023
01:00:57.650 --> 01:01:01.940
let me start off by saying that I love Nia and I can see why you do as well.

1024
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:06.320
Sometimes I think she is a bit hard on the listeners and quick to label labeled

1025
01:01:06.321 --> 01:01:08.660
them as cave men.
Um,

1026
01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:13.190
I gotta tell you this for you and everybody else who thinks she's too harsh and

1027
01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:17.030
you guys just know this.
She's not talking to you guys.
All right.

1028
01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.380
She's talking to me

1029
01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:26.510
because she knows how I am and she knows what the fuck I say is,

1030
01:01:26.511 --> 01:01:30.330
you got to understand she lives with me.
So when I shut the mic off or whatever,

1031
01:01:30.331 --> 01:01:33.770
when I come home from a comedy club,
she is the shit that I say.

1032
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:35.420
And I'm just like,
you guys,

1033
01:01:35.421 --> 01:01:39.500
I say all kinds of Shit than I've actually had a real job.
I,
I,
you know,

1034
01:01:39.501 --> 01:01:42.320
I'd have to issue some sort of fucking apology,
you know what I mean?

1035
01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.600
Cause I'm a human being and I'm a moron.

1036
01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:50.350
So what she does is she thinks she knows all the shit that I say.

1037
01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:56.150
Um,
most of which ends up ends up going to the stage.

1038
01:01:56.210 --> 01:02:01.070
I usually end up taking to the stage because she gets so mad at me.
And,
uh,

1039
01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:06.680
I,
oh,
you know,
you know what one of them was,
this is actually a great story.

1040
01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:09.940
Sorry guys.
I'm fucking in this high altitude and I just worked out and uh,

1041
01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.580
keep getting fucking dry mouth here.
I know.
It's disgusting.

1042
01:02:14.581 --> 01:02:19.230
The listen to me drink here.
I'm sorry.
Um,
all right.
He's a classic one.

1043
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:24.890
That bit I did about Rihanna,
um,

1044
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:27.410
about saying,
you know,
I,
I'm not,

1045
01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:31.490
I'm not condoning what the guy did and Bob above blah blah.
But like,

1046
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:36.600
you know,
I was basically speculating what happened,

1047
01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:41.880
you know what happened in the car before that shit went down.

1048
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:43.530
I can't remember how the fucking pit went.

1049
01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:48.150
So I'm sitting there and I say that shit.
And she just goes,

1050
01:02:48.151 --> 01:02:51.660
don't even fucking say it.
Doni cause of right when the story came out,

1051
01:02:51.661 --> 01:02:55.140
don't even,
she was doing that shit.
You know when somebody is so mad at you,

1052
01:02:55.141 --> 01:02:58.080
they can't even look at you.
She was putting her index finger up,

1053
01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:01.130
like going like,
hang on a second.

1054
01:03:01.131 --> 01:03:03.960
And she was just sort of looking up with their eyes closed.
Don't even say it,

1055
01:03:03.961 --> 01:03:05.400
don't even fucking say,

1056
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:10.510
and I just start laughing and I of course,
yeah,

1057
01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.200
you tell a comedian,
don't say it.
You know they're going to fucking say it.

1058
01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:17.790
It's like that Mr Saturday nights seen Billy crystal when he does that,

1059
01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:20.700
what's with the fucking hair when they said don't say it and then you got to say

1060
01:03:20.701 --> 01:03:24.870
it.
So,
uh,
so I said,
whatever the fuck I said,

1061
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:27.470
and then she got so mad at me or whatever.

1062
01:03:27.490 --> 01:03:31.500
Then we had a giant debate about a surprise.
Surprise.
And then like a week later,

1063
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:33.840
completely unprovoked,

1064
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:38.070
my mother-in-law was over and that story came up again.

1065
01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:43.260
And she goes,
you know,
that's terrible,
but I got to admit,

1066
01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:46.580
I wonder what she said.
And I start laughing at me.

1067
01:03:46.581 --> 01:03:51.270
It's just like mom and I felt totally justified and whatever that ended up being

1068
01:03:51.271 --> 01:03:54.840
in that bid or whatever.
So getting back to what you're saying,
she's not,

1069
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:57.210
she's not calling the listeners cavemen.
It's,
and I'll don't,

1070
01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.040
I labeled them as cavemen.
She's,

1071
01:03:59.041 --> 01:04:02.190
she's really talking to me because she thinks I'm a moron.

1072
01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:06.370
And then she thinks on the podcasts that I am a Pied Piper for moron.

1073
01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:08.670
She doesn't understand that the amount of people that listen to this,

1074
01:04:08.671 --> 01:04:12.450
just to listen to how dumb I am and laugh and feel better about themselves or

1075
01:04:12.451 --> 01:04:16.820
maybe get fat shamed.
Anyways,
back to the,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,
question the here,
um,

1076
01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:21.060
he said,
however,
uh,
it is her opinion and I've never thought her wrong for it.

1077
01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:25.380
I'm just guys being very diplomatic.
Um,
in this case though,

1078
01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:27.030
she was way off the mark.

1079
01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:30.960
There was nothing discriminatory about the question.
In fact,

1080
01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:35.050
it was the exact opposite.
It was,
um,
and I wish she was here for this.
Um,

1081
01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:36.300
it was an inclusive,

1082
01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:40.470
it was inclusive and represented the types of thoughts a man having a son could

1083
01:04:40.471 --> 01:04:43.020
have raising alarm the way she did.

1084
01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:46.320
Sensationalizes some issues that don't even exist.

1085
01:04:46.321 --> 01:04:50.790
We do not have chronic problems of wondering which sex we'd rather have be a

1086
01:04:50.791 --> 01:04:55.440
whore.
The fact that the question was intended to be humorous,
humorous,

1087
01:04:55.441 --> 01:04:59.550
which she did acknowledge,
put it in a category of even less offensiveness.

1088
01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:04.950
Uh,
you ever have made many jokes about a million things and implying this is off

1089
01:05:04.951 --> 01:05:08.600
limits.
Victimizes the sexual habits of either sex,
uh,

1090
01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:11.430
her intent was righteous.
Uh,
but it,

1091
01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.650
it's this irresponsible,

1092
01:05:13.651 --> 01:05:16.890
alarming of any issue that makes it harder for a gay boy to be thought of

1093
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:20.560
equally and also makes it harder for a straight person to become comfortable

1094
01:05:20.561 --> 01:05:25.320
with the issues pertaining to sexual,
uh,
orientation.
Ps,

1095
01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:26.210
you look better with the

1096
01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.113
<v 2>beard.</v>

1097
01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.030
<v 1>Oh Shit.
You know,
right.</v>

1098
01:05:34.031 --> 01:05:39.031
As I was about ready to say that this was my probably the most dramatically like

1099
01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:42.600
best written thing on the podcast.
You could a row,

1100
01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.840
you get a read that on fucking meet the press.
You got it?
Yeah,
that was perfect.

1101
01:05:45.841 --> 01:05:49.950
You set me up with anything yet.
You took a nice fucking uppercut.
Um,

1102
01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:53.850
I like having a beard.
I was like being clean shaven,
so you know,
I'm sorry.

1103
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:57.330
You're just going to have to keep looking at that poster of me above your bed,

1104
01:05:57.331 --> 01:06:01.980
sir.
Okay.
Because I'm,
I'm going clean shaven here for awhile.
All right.

1105
01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:07.660
Yeah,
that clean shaven.
All right.
Fat Shaming.
I already read that one.
Um,

1106
01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:12.480
what are we up to here?
Oh,
we're up to one hour.
Um,
graffiti,

1107
01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.570
a Billy copper crotch.
Do you look at it?

1108
01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:17.550
Just take it fucking rights and lefts here.

1109
01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:22.230
Is this any way to treat your host?
You know,

1110
01:06:22.231 --> 01:06:25.620
I invite you over for free.
I help you with your commute.

1111
01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:29.370
Now you do fucking trash in my pubes over there.
Um,

1112
01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:34.440
first off,
I like to say I'm a huge fan of the podcast.
Oh,
I know how this goes.

1113
01:06:34.441 --> 01:06:35.340
Yeah.
Butter me up.

1114
01:06:35.341 --> 01:06:38.100
So then I put my guard down and then you fucking trash my fucking,

1115
01:06:38.730 --> 01:06:42.360
I don't know what my giant forehead said.
Always hilarious.
Even so,

1116
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:45.330
even insightful at times.
Oh,
look at that.
Even dummies,
right?

1117
01:06:45.331 --> 01:06:48.420
Every once in a while,
a guest we throw the long commute to college every day.

1118
01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:52.530
He said,
uh,
Jesus Christ,
his kids,
18 years old.
Oh,

1119
01:06:52.531 --> 01:06:56.610
it's even insightful.
You little cunt.
Um,
he said,

1120
01:06:56.611 --> 01:07:00.690
I'm an 18 year old from Providence,
Rhode Island.
I've drank there.

1121
01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:05.340
I've been into art at ever since I can remember.

1122
01:07:05.341 --> 01:07:10.070
I love all forms of it except those dms s sculptures that look like some moron

1123
01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:14.010
welded a couple of scraps of junkyard metal together in a pathetic attempt at

1124
01:07:14.011 --> 01:07:16.860
being a creative.
Uh,

1125
01:07:16.890 --> 01:07:21.890
but the one form of visual expression that has always been my hat and personal

1126
01:07:21.931 --> 01:07:26.880
passion is graffiti.
Uh,
uh,

1127
01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.300
man,
the question got cut off.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

1128
01:07:30.301 --> 01:07:34.470
I got it right here.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
As a graffiti writer,

1129
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:39.180
I am very aware that many people despise what we do.

1130
01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:42.240
Consider it pointless,
ugly,

1131
01:07:42.241 --> 01:07:45.000
detrimental to society as well as childish.

1132
01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:49.380
Yet I have been utterly curious to know what your opinion slash position of our

1133
01:07:49.381 --> 01:07:51.810
art form is.
Be it negative or positive.

1134
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:56.550
I'd be ecstatic to hear you discuss it on the podcast for a bit.
For a bit.

1135
01:07:56.551 --> 01:08:00.580
Best wishes to the lovely Nia and you,
you old conch.
Go Fuck you

1136
01:08:02.790 --> 01:08:05.370
dude.
Everybody's trying to steal around this week.
You know,

1137
01:08:05.371 --> 01:08:08.400
I feel like I'm winning then all of a sudden you fucking sugar ray Leonard,

1138
01:08:08.401 --> 01:08:13.380
me here.
Um,
the Psu should come perform somewhere in Rhode Island,

1139
01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:15.030
Connecticut or Boston as soon.

1140
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:19.100
And my older brother had been dying to see some authentic Billy boys stand up,

1141
01:08:19.101 --> 01:08:22.640
but we lack the finances to travel relatively far from home.
Well,
I'll,

1142
01:08:22.641 --> 01:08:26.480
I'll be there definitely.
Uh,
as I build up my next hour,

1143
01:08:26.481 --> 01:08:30.110
I haven't been to Boston and uh,
I think it was February of last year,

1144
01:08:30.111 --> 01:08:33.380
so I'm dope.
I'm definitely doe.
Um,

1145
01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:35.050
<v 0>okay.</v>

1146
01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:36.890
<v 1>All right,
so what am I,
what is my opinion on it?</v>

1147
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:40.220
I definitely think it's an art form.
I definitely like any art form.

1148
01:08:40.221 --> 01:08:42.800
There's some I like more than others.
What I,

1149
01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:47.830
my only complaint is the canvas that you guys use.

1150
01:08:48.690 --> 01:08:53.120
And I respect the ability to,
uh,
I mean some of some of the,

1151
01:08:53.150 --> 01:08:56.090
like someone who actually makes like a painting or something like that is

1152
01:08:56.091 --> 01:08:58.280
incredible.
Just sitting there tagging and write in your name.

1153
01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:03.230
Then it comes down to how visually I guess stimulating it is.

1154
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:06.320
But my thing is to,
uh,

1155
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:12.340
what kills a lot of it is if you actually spray paint on something that I was

1156
01:09:12.341 --> 01:09:16.660
already appreciating and the fact that I know that somebody else owns it and

1157
01:09:16.661 --> 01:09:18.340
that you just spray painted all over it.

1158
01:09:18.341 --> 01:09:22.900
And I understand that a lot of that art is this outlaw thing.
Um,

1159
01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:25.980
you know,
I mean,
I don't give a fuck,
you know,

1160
01:09:25.981 --> 01:09:29.010
those metal things that they pulled down over the doors,
those ugly to look at.

1161
01:09:29.011 --> 01:09:32.310
So when graffiti artists spray painted them,
I thought that those look better.

1162
01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:37.170
However,
you know,
if you come up like where I live,
you know,

1163
01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.250
there's these guys,
you know,

1164
01:09:38.251 --> 01:09:43.251
I don't know this fucking Armenian gang and they tagged shit all the fucking

1165
01:09:43.351 --> 01:09:45.000
time and it's stinks.

1166
01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.810
It's just black spray paint and they just spray their fucking thing.

1167
01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:53.940
It's really dumb.
They write danger in one of the things,
which is really stupid.

1168
01:09:53.941 --> 01:09:54.360
And I,

1169
01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:58.950
and I've told you before that I think Armenians and Russians are the pit bulls

1170
01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:03.050
of a,
of humor.
Like I would not eat,

1171
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:06.250
I would not fuck with either one of them on any goddamn level.
However,

1172
01:10:06.251 --> 01:10:09.250
I will sit there and the safety of this hotel room in the middle of the Utah

1173
01:10:09.610 --> 01:10:12.430
surrounded by Mormons and say that,
that,

1174
01:10:12.431 --> 01:10:15.160
that's kind of fucking lame to write danger.

1175
01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:20.080
It's just stupid down baiting them to do something dangerous.
But,
uh,
yeah,

1176
01:10:20.081 --> 01:10:24.250
I dunno.
I,
I would say it,
it,
it,
I've seen documentaries on,
uh,

1177
01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:25.980
<v 0>uh,</v>

1178
01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:29.500
<v 1>you know,
graffiti artists and I definitely have an appreciation for it,
but I,</v>

1179
01:10:29.501 --> 01:10:32.070
I'm happy that they're off the subway trains in New York.

1180
01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:33.843
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1181
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:37.250
<v 1>I always hated that shit.
Then they started scratching up the seats and shit.</v>

1182
01:10:37.251 --> 01:10:38.084
And it's just like,

1183
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:42.080
isn't it awful enough that these things are going to be filthy because so many

1184
01:10:42.081 --> 01:10:46.580
people are in here that you have to fucking ruin it now by scratching up the

1185
01:10:46.581 --> 01:10:51.350
windows and all this type of shit.
And like,
I don't,
I don't,

1186
01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:54.140
you know,
all that bullshit that they say,
well,
you know,

1187
01:10:55.450 --> 01:10:55.760
<v 0>okay.</v>

1188
01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.730
<v 1>I guess with some inner city kids,
they have this,
you know,</v>

1189
01:10:58.731 --> 01:11:01.300
they feel invisible and this is their way of the,
of,

1190
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:03.800
of what fucking ruining property.
I don't,
that's,
I don't know,

1191
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:06.680
there's gotta be a better way to do it,
but I have to tell you out in la,

1192
01:11:06.681 --> 01:11:11.600
there's some amazing,
amazing stuff that I have seen.
So,
uh,
I dunno.

1193
01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:14.310
So I,
yeah,
I do appreciate

1194
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:17.460
<v 0>it,
but sometimes,
you know,
it's just some of the shit,</v>

1195
01:11:17.461 --> 01:11:20.940
like they got a lot of stuff.
Uh,
you know,

1196
01:11:20.941 --> 01:11:23.610
La is just classic for just Taren,

1197
01:11:23.611 --> 01:11:27.540
some beautiful old building down and then just sticking up a fucking strip mall

1198
01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:30.000
and there's not a lot of stuff like that left.

1199
01:11:30.001 --> 01:11:31.620
So when there is something like that,

1200
01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:36.060
some art deco look and stuff and some kid comes up and spray paints all over it.

1201
01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:41.520
Um,
you know,
I don't like that.
I think I then,

1202
01:11:41.521 --> 01:11:44.120
I think it's ugly.
I think,
uh,

1203
01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:47.760
you there was already a piece of art and then you fucking like,

1204
01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:52.980
in a way it's like you're cock block and you're not enhancing it or whatever.
Um,

1205
01:11:53.090 --> 01:11:55.650
I would say that,
you know,
it is funny though,

1206
01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:01.100
is when you see somebody driving down the street and like some truck and it's

1207
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:02.790
just fucking graffiti all over it.

1208
01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:10.320
That always makes me laugh because I always think about,
uh,

1209
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.370
the Griswold family truckster when they pulled in and they went to ask for

1210
01:12:14.371 --> 01:12:17.070
directions,
which was absolutely hilarious.

1211
01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:19.920
You couldn't do a scene like that now because it would probably be considered

1212
01:12:19.921 --> 01:12:23.120
too racist or whatever.
But it was fucking hilarious.
They pull in in this steel,

1213
01:12:23.121 --> 01:12:26.580
in their hubcaps and all that type of Shit and spray painted.
It was basically,

1214
01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:29.910
it was a def jam bit like what's his face?

1215
01:12:29.970 --> 01:12:33.540
Chevy chase was the white guy,
you know,
hey,
how are ya?

1216
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:38.700
Just trying to get back out on the highway,
you know,
that type of shit.
So,

1217
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:40.410
oh,
you know what,
I forgot to bring up his,

1218
01:12:40.411 --> 01:12:43.850
something else I wanted to show you guys before,
uh,
before I get out of here,
um,

1219
01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:49.770
is I got a new rear end put in on my truck.
I finally just,
I,
you know,

1220
01:12:50.610 --> 01:12:53.430
I went out to Texas when I hung out with those guys over at gas monkey.

1221
01:12:53.431 --> 01:12:54.001
They were telling me,

1222
01:12:54.001 --> 01:12:57.720
cause I got still at that granny transmission in there and I wanted to keep it,

1223
01:12:57.721 --> 01:12:59.460
you know,
a three speed on the column.

1224
01:12:59.461 --> 01:13:03.810
I just think it's cool as hell to be shifted on the column.
And um,

1225
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:06.300
so I didn't want,
I,
you know,

1226
01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.570
I didn't want to fuck with the linkage or something like that where all of a

1227
01:13:09.571 --> 01:13:11.970
sudden I don't,
I don't,
I don't actually,
to be honest with you,

1228
01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:13.800
I don't know if I put a fourth gear,

1229
01:13:13.801 --> 01:13:15.720
if that means now I got to have it on the floor.

1230
01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:17.790
Just always seem as four on the floor,
three on the tree.

1231
01:13:18.330 --> 01:13:22.170
So I'm one of the guys over there at gas.
Margaret says,
yeah,

1232
01:13:22.171 --> 01:13:24.090
just throw new rear ended,
you know,

1233
01:13:24.091 --> 01:13:28.020
that cause my truck basically red lines at about it was about 50,

1234
01:13:28.021 --> 01:13:29.190
55 doesn't red line,

1235
01:13:29.191 --> 01:13:32.970
but it's making enough noise with the engine's working too hard because it's

1236
01:13:32.971 --> 01:13:37.170
basically designed to just kind of haul shit around on a farm.

1237
01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:42.750
Um,
so whatever.
So I put a new rear ended.
I didn't put it anywhere.
Uh,
obviously,

1238
01:13:42.850 --> 01:13:47.220
uh,
I had some other guys do it and uh,
it's fucking amazing.

1239
01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:52.110
It's fucking amazing.
And now it's making me,
now it can cruise at like 65,

1240
01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:55.860
which is night and day.
You know,
55 to 65,

1241
01:13:55.861 --> 01:14:00.000
65 you're cruising at 55,
you're actually going to cause an accident.

1242
01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:04.710
You bump up that extra 10 miles.
It's huge.
And now,
um,

1243
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:06.660
I dunno,
I think I kinda got the bug.

1244
01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.960
I really want to keep the truck as original as I can,
but

1245
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:13.840
<v 1>to the point that I've,
everything that I've changed on the truck,</v>

1246
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:17.830
I've kept the original,
like when I had an aluminum radiator put in,

1247
01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:22.570
I kept the original want to have that in my garage when not Christopher Titus

1248
01:14:22.571 --> 01:14:26.920
helped me do the,
the front brakes basically showed me what to do.

1249
01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:30.130
I kept the uh,
the drums and the shoes and all that shit.

1250
01:14:30.131 --> 01:14:31.990
I have that and now I have back there,

1251
01:14:31.991 --> 01:14:35.650
I have my opinion and ring gear from the rear end and um,

1252
01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:38.680
I found this great website,
I got to find it.

1253
01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:43.750
That actually explains gear ratios and how to do them.
You got to check it out.

1254
01:14:43.751 --> 01:14:45.310
It's one of the coolest like fucking,

1255
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:47.030
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1256
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:52.030
<v 1>it's one of the coolest things sites I ever read as far as like mechanics go and</v>

1257
01:14:53.391 --> 01:14:56.930
you really understand like racing a lot better.

1258
01:14:56.931 --> 01:15:01.010
Like the push pull of ad,
it gets all about weight,

1259
01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:02.811
you know,

1260
01:15:02.811 --> 01:15:06.800
trying to get the car to go as fast as it can while still keep keeping it as

1261
01:15:06.801 --> 01:15:11.390
light as possible.
It's fucking amazing.
That whole balance.

1262
01:15:12.650 --> 01:15:17.000
Um,
and just all the shit that they do to the car.
It just makes it,

1263
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:21.800
I feel like I moved up three levels in my limited understanding of,
it's really,

1264
01:15:21.801 --> 01:15:26.480
really fucking fascinating stuff.
And,
uh,
I already forget how to do gear ratios,

1265
01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:31.040
but I counted the rings on my old,
uh,
ring gear and,

1266
01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:34.430
and on the pinion and I was able to figure out what kind of rear end that I had

1267
01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:38.210
and I was trying to get over to the garage when they were putting the new one in

1268
01:15:38.211 --> 01:15:40.700
because they were going to actually,
you know,
show me how to like the way tidy,

1269
01:15:40.701 --> 01:15:42.110
show me.
We're going to show me some shit,
but,

1270
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:45.980
and of course ended up getting some crap that I had to do so I wasn't able to do

1271
01:15:45.981 --> 01:15:49.490
it.
But,
um,
so that'll be it.
I'll show you the rock climbing thing.

1272
01:15:49.491 --> 01:15:52.530
I'll show you the guy showing you how to do a muscle up and I'll show you

1273
01:15:54.570 --> 01:15:55.403
<v 0>what else,</v>

1274
01:15:56.410 --> 01:15:59.590
<v 1>what I just talked about,
the gear ratios.
Oh.
And then the last thing too,</v>

1275
01:15:59.591 --> 01:16:03.190
just to keep it fair,
so it's not all testosterone stuff.

1276
01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:08.660
I'm going to show you a a fucking cake youtube clip that I saw today on how to

1277
01:16:09.581 --> 01:16:13.060
basic,
it's pretty basic how to just make an egg within some bread.

1278
01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:15.133
<v 0>You know,</v>

1279
01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:16.580
<v 1>like an egg over easy.</v>

1280
01:16:16.581 --> 01:16:18.530
And this woman actually makes it with a little heart shape.

1281
01:16:18.531 --> 01:16:20.300
So you can do a teeth for your wife.
I'm telling you,

1282
01:16:20.301 --> 01:16:24.380
this is a type of shit you do that you know.
So then when you actually fuck up,

1283
01:16:24.381 --> 01:16:25.610
they have that enter their head.

1284
01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.830
Oh well he made me an egg in the heart shape thing.

1285
01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:31.820
So I watched this thing showing you how to do it.
It's really basic,

1286
01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:34.300
which is why I couldn't understand it,
but I have to,

1287
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:37.330
I got to show you this thing.
I don't want an,
I don't want it.

1288
01:16:37.331 --> 01:16:40.760
Like I don't want to bait you guys into writing a bunch of mean comments.

1289
01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.193
All right?

1290
01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:47.420
There's something in the video that is super fucking annoying that you're not

1291
01:16:47.421 --> 01:16:50.780
supposed to make fun of.
So I won't.
All right,

1292
01:16:50.781 --> 01:16:52.880
but I'm just letting you know that,
you know,

1293
01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:57.200
there's cute and then there's fucking annoying and I felt that this video went

1294
01:16:57.201 --> 01:17:00.050
into annoying,
but other than that,
I'll put that up there anyways.
All right.

1295
01:17:00.051 --> 01:17:01.970
But keep your comments fucking Nice,
you guys.

1296
01:17:01.971 --> 01:17:04.580
You guys say way too much mean ship a lot of you too.

1297
01:17:04.581 --> 01:17:07.040
You guys go way over the top.
You know,

1298
01:17:07.041 --> 01:17:09.020
if you don't like my wife's been on that I get it.

1299
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:13.370
Can just say that you don't have to go as far as your fucking go.
So really a,

1300
01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:16.730
you know,
I mean,
that's fucked up.
Me saying that considering I trash everything,

1301
01:17:16.731 --> 01:17:20.950
but uh,
you know,
just fuck it.
Dial it back a little bit.
All right.
You can.

1302
01:17:21.150 --> 01:17:23.750
All right,
that's the podcast for this week of fuck yourself.

1303
01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:25.550
I'm telling you right now,
United States,

1304
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:28.250
I'm praying they make the World Cup final.

1305
01:17:28.251 --> 01:17:31.610
I'm praying that they went in and I'm praying that 40 people show up.
All right,

1306
01:17:31.611 --> 01:17:33.650
that's it.
Go fuck yourselves.
We'll talk to you next week.
