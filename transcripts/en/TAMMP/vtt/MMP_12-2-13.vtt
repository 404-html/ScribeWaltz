1
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.870
Hey,
what's going on?
It's Filburn burn.

2
00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:07.970
It's the Monday morning podcasts from Monday,
uh,

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.250
December 2nd,

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.250
2013 t when the boat hits your eye like a big pizza pie.

5
00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:21.190
That's,
Oh,
are they?
When a man,

6
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.010
a guy have Rigatoni on the sly,

7
00:00:25.011 --> 00:00:30.011
that's a mornay and I ain't on that fucking song goes

8
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.210
one man is not supposed to lay down with another man.
How dare you say that?

9
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:41.080
So close to the Vatican.
Ciao Bella.
God.

10
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.780
See player goes Si.
Perfecto.
Coma.
Say Go.
Como Se deed shit.

11
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:50.640
Go Fuck Yourself.
Hey,
this is bill burr.
I'm on.
I'm over here in Rome,

12
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:55.240
Italy.
And um,
once again,
my fucking mix.

13
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.840
For some reason it doesn't work over here.

14
00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:02.620
And what I'm starting to think is that,
you know,
when I was in Australia,

15
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.930
I just plugged it right into the wall and that was the end of that.
It had no,

16
00:01:07.931 --> 00:01:12.340
uh,
no,
I was going to say surcharge,
no circuit breaker.

17
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.440
It didn't have,
it wasn't a hurricane ready basically,
and it got blown over.

18
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.880
But this time I actually got the little adapter or the converter or whatever the

19
00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:26.500
fuck it is.
Adapter,
I guess.
And it still isn't working.
So we are,

20
00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:31.300
I am here.
I sit trying to hold my hand steady is,

21
00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:35.560
I talked directly into my record.
Um,

22
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.070
all right.
I don't know what the levels of like,
I don't have a mixer.

23
00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:42.970
It's going to be a fucking cluster.
Fuck.
So there you go.
All right.
By the way,

24
00:01:42.971 --> 00:01:47.140
somebody sent me some stupid tweet going,
you know,
Bill,
when you don't care,

25
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.070
we don't care.
Just always remember that.
Like,

26
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.030
I didn't know what the fuck that means.
But what do you mean we don't care?

27
00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.110
What is the we in that statement?
Uh Huh.

28
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.670
What you and all the voices in your fucking head.

29
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.950
Stop acting like you're running a union.
All right.

30
00:02:05.951 --> 00:02:08.620
If you don't like my fucking podcast,
believe me,

31
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.600
there's plenty of other selections here on the all things comedy network.
Oh,

32
00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:15.550
he slips in a plug.
Yes.

33
00:02:15.551 --> 00:02:20.290
Listen to the echo of this fucking room here.
Um,

34
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.930
yeah,
so I'm in Rome,
Italy,
and um,

35
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.490
it is totally lived up to the hype.
It's been absolutely freaking amazing.

36
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.440
Ollie,
I got Pete's had coming out of my folk in age,

37
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.180
I had the worst heartburn last night.
I ate two pizzas yesterday,

38
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.800
like both within like two hours.

39
00:02:38.801 --> 00:02:43.330
Like that's how good the pizza is over here and like a fucking camel drinking

40
00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:44.140
water.

41
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.140
I know that eventually I'm not going to be here at the source of the greatest

42
00:02:49.781 --> 00:02:52.960
pizza on the fucking planet and then I'm going to go out to the Los Angeles,

43
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.350
arguably the anti source of the greatest pizza on the planet.

44
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.070
So I'm trying stock up all of those memories.
And um,

45
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.420
yeah,
the food has just been outstanding here,
but you know,
just like any place,

46
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.760
there's always people living off the legend.
So you really have to,
you know,

47
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:16.000
you gotta ask around is what I did.
And when you ask,

48
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:17.470
where's a good place to get pizza,

49
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:22.120
you don't do it standing outside the fucking coliseum or down there at the

50
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:25.930
Vatican or the lean in tower of fucking beach.

51
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.490
Right.

52
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.610
You don't cause you're just going to run into some guy from fucking Detroit.

53
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.080
And what you want to do is go up to some Italian dude and find out where the

54
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:39.310
fuck he eats.
That's basically what we had been doing.
And um,

55
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.500
it's been absolutely,
uh,
it's been amazing.

56
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.873
It's been amazing.

57
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.990
So if you're listening to this thing and you always want to come to Italy,

58
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.080
how about the next time the ghost of Steve jobs comes out with a new phone or

59
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:59.500
some other Douche bags?
Make another phone.
Why don't you say fuck that phone?

60
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.480
My phone still works.
I don't need that phone.
I can still text.

61
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:07.360
I can still talk.
I will save the money.

62
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:12.361
I'm going to spend on that fucking $300 a hunk of shit that's not going to be

63
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:16.540
worth anything.
It's four months when the next one comes out.

64
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.070
Um,
and just save up for a plane ticket and get your ass over here.

65
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.180
Fucking stay in a cardboard box.
Do whatever you gotta do.

66
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:29.530
I wish I didn't wait until I was 45 to come over here,
but still it's been a,

67
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:32.800
it's been awesome,
but it ain't that bad.

68
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.030
I got to do is just get your ass over here.
Um,

69
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.900
I brought the lovely kneel with me and um,

70
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.270
one of my goals in life was I always wanted to fly,
you know,
first class where,

71
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:50.860
you know,
you go up those,
those,
the staircases,
you know,
they have like the hump,

72
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.150
the front of the plane.

73
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.180
So I used a bunch of miles and I made sure that we fly business class and uh,

74
00:04:57.821 --> 00:05:00.220
when we were flying Air France

75
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.080
and when we got to the airport is one of those fucking double decker planes,

76
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.320
the a 300.
And uh,

77
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.420
and I'm sitting there looking at my ticket and instead I was like,

78
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.710
we were in 63 a and B and I was like,
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

79
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.270
I thought we were in business class.
They used all these miles.
You know what?

80
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:20.740
I'm flipping the fuck out and everything.

81
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.700
It turns out we were in business class,

82
00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:26.800
we were just in business class upstairs,

83
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.670
so they already went through one through 60 downstairs.

84
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:34.570
So we were like row three upstairs and it was a,
they had to jet ways.

85
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.840
We come walking down,
they're like,
no sir,
you're on the upper upper deck,

86
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.970
so fucking site.
So we come in there

87
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.920
and were upstairs on an airplane.
You know what it looked just like downstairs.

88
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.160
Just look like a fucking plane.

89
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:55.660
But it was still cool and we went up there and I'm going,
Oh man,

90
00:05:55.661 --> 00:05:59.330
look at those nice business class.
They can fold down.
I can lay down,

91
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:01.520
this is going to be great.
Watching all the movies and everything.

92
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:06.521
And then all of a sudden there was this fucking ungodly God damn fucking smell.

93
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.220
You know New York City body odor.

94
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.810
Stinken fucking smell upstairs in business class on an international fucking

95
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:21.074
plane.

96
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.110
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

97
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.660
<v 0>I'm like,
what the fuck is that smell?</v>

98
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.963
<v 1>Right?</v>

99
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.560
<v 0>Two words,
Air France.</v>

100
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:32.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

101
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.800
<v 0>All right.
The keyword is not air there.
It's certainly not fresh air.</v>

102
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.570
Air France,
this fucking French dude.

103
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.570
Okay.
Now I'm not coming down on all the Frenchies here,

104
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.020
but I discovered where the stereotype came from in this one passenger.

105
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:52.603
<v 1>All right.</v>

106
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.210
<v 0>I now understand pepe Le Pew.</v>

107
00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.730
Good fucking Lord with his fucking tight ass God damn shirt.
This guy,

108
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.300
I swear to God,
arms at his side.

109
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.140
He looked like a guy wearing a shirt that didn't fit.
Okay.

110
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.150
Sticking his fucking suitcase up into the overhead compartment.

111
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.370
It was like you were in the back of a cab in New York City in July with no

112
00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:22.120
fucking air conditioning.
I couldn't,
I couldn't fucking believe it.

113
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.050
I couldn't believe it.
He kept forgetting shit and going back up.

114
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:30.980
And every time that that stink was starting to go away,

115
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.290
um,
he'd have to reach up and get something.
So of course,
you know me,

116
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.770
I am by no means master of my emotions.

117
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.750
So I'm looking over at the lovely Nia who's just taking it in stride.
Granted,

118
00:07:45.751 --> 00:07:48.720
she also has the window seat.
I have the aisle,

119
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.310
so I'm right next to fucking stinky Lapu over there.
And I'm like,

120
00:07:53.311 --> 00:07:54.390
do you fucking believe this?

121
00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:57.180
You fucking place fucking spent all his fucking money,

122
00:07:57.181 --> 00:08:00.510
fucking fuck fucking business class,
fucking fuck,
fuck,
fuck.
And she's just like,

123
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.920
it's okay.

124
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:07.080
He'll get his comb or whatever and he'll sit down and that's what happened.

125
00:08:07.081 --> 00:08:10.500
He sat down and eventually that's fucking smell went away.

126
00:08:10.501 --> 00:08:15.160
But Jesus Christ,
it's fucking unreal,
man.

127
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:17.620
You know,

128
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:22.120
and all you hear about when you go to Paris is what countries they are and how

129
00:08:22.121 --> 00:08:24.430
they treat everybody like shit.
And I thought,
all right,

130
00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:27.340
that's that ignorant American thing,
right?

131
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.840
But last night I was in an Irish pub.
Hilarious.
I'm in Rome,

132
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.160
I'm in an Irish pub

133
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.070
because I have to be honest with you,
like I love Italian food,

134
00:08:39.071 --> 00:08:42.790
but you can't fucking,
I've realized you eat it four days in a fucking row.

135
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.780
All right.
I got off the posts,
come out my fucking A's over the,
um,

136
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.130
I just needed an where we walked by this,
uh,

137
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:55.030
this great strip of our stores and all that type of shit.
And,

138
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.960
and Nia happened to look in and there was hockey on,
like the flyers game was on.

139
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.870
And she immediately was like,
oh,
Bill,
I know you're going in there.

140
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:06.240
And of course I went in there and then of course,

141
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:10.440
two seconds later I met some guy from Boston and we're sitting there talking

142
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:13.260
about when the pats game is going to come on.
It was just,
it was fucking great,

143
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.730
you know,
so it was like,
it was basically,
it was heaven.

144
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.260
I was in the sports bar and watch the Bruins,

145
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:25.290
Celtics or the Patriots depending on who was playing obviously.

146
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:28.800
And then I stepped out and I was in fucking Rome and right across the way was

147
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.800
one of the best pizza places in Rome.

148
00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:34.110
Had this ridiculous align and I had gotten there early.

149
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.220
That's the place where I ate it there twice,
already ate there once.

150
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:42.330
And then yesterday I had there twice.
And right now,
um,

151
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.820
after getting myself into great shape,
I now look like,
um,
uh,

152
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.450
maybe two weeks ago I had a baby.

153
00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.830
I have a lot of baby fat on me right now.
Um,
post-pregnancy Pooch.

154
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.600
I ever cut belly,
everybody,
I'm not going to lie to you,
um,
that it's disgusting.

155
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.090
And right next door was this gelato place.

156
00:10:04.091 --> 00:10:07.720
So I was eating pizza and then I was going and getting gelato and then I was

157
00:10:07.721 --> 00:10:11.500
coming in and I was drinking fucking,
uh,
McCowen.

158
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.090
And uh,
it was just the best time ever.

159
00:10:16.091 --> 00:10:21.091
So there was this Italian guy in there and he's watching the soccer and I'm

160
00:10:21.671 --> 00:10:25.720
watching the Patriots and a,
so we ended up starting to talk,

161
00:10:25.721 --> 00:10:29.950
he couldn't really speak English.
I can barely speak three words of Italian,

162
00:10:29.951 --> 00:10:34.810
but I did know some Spanish.
So we were kind of the middle ground with Spanish.

163
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.470
So we will kind of communicating was fully cool using English,

164
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.340
Spanish and Italian and our eyes.

165
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.560
But anyways,
I'm talking to him and I was saying I'll,

166
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:54.590
Italian seemed a little easier to pick up than Spanish because Spanish goes by.

167
00:10:54.591 --> 00:10:59.510
They,
they speak so quickly.
And with the Italian it's like every like third word,

168
00:10:59.511 --> 00:11:01.670
they draw it up at that,
but that blah,
blah blah.

169
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:05.870
So they kind of slow it down for you,
you know?
And he was laughing,

170
00:11:05.871 --> 00:11:09.590
he was saying how he also like the French speaking French,

171
00:11:09.591 --> 00:11:12.500
but he didn't like French people.
And I was like,

172
00:11:12.501 --> 00:11:17.270
did they treat you like shit too?
And he was like,
yes.
See.
And it's just like wow.

173
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.700
Just in general,
they just kind of cuts to everyone,

174
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:25.100
which is confusing and fucking hilarious to me all at the same time.

175
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.750
Um,
I dunno what,
what is their problem over there?

176
00:11:29.751 --> 00:11:31.580
All I know is I can't wait to go there.

177
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:37.180
And my dream has always been to be totally fluent and be able to speak French

178
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.930
and go to Paris and then just sit there and listen to them say a bunch of

179
00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:45.320
horrific shit about me.
Not realizing I understood every word.

180
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.970
Isn't that a weird dream?
And then a weird motivation,
you know,

181
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.400
to learn how to speak the language.
Does anybody listen to this thing?

182
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.100
Preferably some,
uh,

183
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.040
some hottie they can put on a French maid's outfit and teach me the language

184
00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:04.540
because I would show up for every class.

185
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:07.900
Cause other than that I just can't seem to,
uh,

186
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:14.060
I just can't seem to fucking dedicate myself to it.
So,
um,

187
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.570
<v 1>okay.</v>

188
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.460
<v 0>Anyways,
I hope this is sound and I write,</v>

189
00:12:17.461 --> 00:12:20.990
I'm trying not to move to record it too much.
So anyway,
so we,
we uh,

190
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
we land in Charles de Gaulle airport and as we're coming in on the left side of

191
00:12:26.341 --> 00:12:29.220
the,
uh,
of the plane,
but we saw a little bit of Paris,

192
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.780
which is really exciting and really cool cause he always wanting to go there.

193
00:12:33.781 --> 00:12:37.920
So she was acting like a little kid,
which was great.
And um,

194
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.653
we land

195
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:41.100
<v 1>okay.</v>

196
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.300
<v 0>And we're all excited thinking,</v>

197
00:12:42.301 --> 00:12:45.420
okay now we're only in like another hour and a half,

198
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.950
whatever hour and 10 minute flight from Rome.

199
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:52.730
And then of course there was that ungodly fucking smell of that French fuck with

200
00:12:53.001 --> 00:12:58.001
his fucking yellow shirt is yellow button down.

201
00:12:59.170 --> 00:12:59.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

202
00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:00.471
<v 0>Oh I was,</v>

203
00:13:00.471 --> 00:13:04.920
I was really looking at the guy like how the fuck have you managed in life to be

204
00:13:04.921 --> 00:13:09.590
able to get into business class here,
smelling the way you do.

205
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:10.940
Okay.

206
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:15.740
I've had to jump around like a monkey and I would many layers of deodorant to

207
00:13:15.741 --> 00:13:19.880
get where the fuck I am to be sitting next to you on this fucking plane.

208
00:13:19.881 --> 00:13:23.600
How do you go into your board room?
How do you run your cult?

209
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.480
How sell your fucking widgets?

210
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.190
Smelling like that?

211
00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:33.450
You just walk into your place of business with your hands plunged into your

212
00:13:33.451 --> 00:13:37.950
slacks,
like fucking pockets.
That's the only God damn way.

213
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.570
[inaudible] I know I'm an angry guy,
but I'm just saying this guy smelled so bad.

214
00:13:44.571 --> 00:13:46.460
Like,
like I was actually,
I had rage.

215
00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:48.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

216
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.190
<v 0>I just slapped him with a glove.
You want normally do.</v>

217
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:52.520
Next time I'm bringing a white glove.

218
00:13:52.521 --> 00:13:55.880
When I go to Paris and when somebody treats me rudely,

219
00:13:55.881 --> 00:13:58.550
I'm just going to slap him in the face with that glove.
And you know what?

220
00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.930
I don't think they're going to do anything.

221
00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:01.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

222
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:06.420
<v 0>I in general do not have fear of waiters in Paris even though I've never been</v>

223
00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:11.140
there.
No watch to probably a bunch of fucking mixed martial artists.

224
00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:16.270
Not only will I get treated like shit by some non perfume wherein countries also

225
00:14:16.271 --> 00:14:19.990
going,
do they even body slam you?

226
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.090
Hey,
I know I'm,
uh,
I,
this video came out in 2007,

227
00:14:25.091 --> 00:14:28.390
but did you ever see that video where that wrapper acorn has that?

228
00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:29.224
He say his name,

229
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.150
he's doing a show and somebody threw something at him and he's like,

230
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.640
who was it?
Point them out.
Bring them up here.

231
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.110
And as they bring this fucking kid up,
this nerdy,

232
00:14:41.111 --> 00:14:43.330
I think it was an Asian Asian dude,
I don't know what.

233
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.020
But as he pulls the kid up on the stage in one move,

234
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:52.010
oh by the way,
he's taken off his does Jesus peace and his wife beater.

235
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:57.200
So now he's just standing there shredded and it's oversized jeans.

236
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.721
Any polls,

237
00:14:57.721 --> 00:15:02.660
this kid up on stage and in one move puts this kit up over his head,

238
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:06.970
like fucking Tony Atlas and then throws him into the crowd

239
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.550
and the dude just lands on some girl.

240
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.300
It was the funniest shit.
Like,
do you know bad?

241
00:15:18.301 --> 00:15:21.980
I would love to do that to a heckler.
You know,

242
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:25.020
take off my fucking,
my buttoned down,

243
00:15:25.021 --> 00:15:30.021
standing there with my blinding Alabaster fucking shirt with my little my torso,

244
00:15:30.211 --> 00:15:31.200
with my cunt belly.

245
00:15:31.201 --> 00:15:36.190
And just pick somebody up over my head and just throw him into the crowd.
Don't,

246
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.960
it was like marvel comics.
The only thing missing is,

247
00:15:39.961 --> 00:15:44.280
is he didn't go through the kid didn't go through a brick building.
Um,

248
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.870
I dunno what happened and I don't want to encourage anybody to take any sort of

249
00:15:48.871 --> 00:15:49.291
action,

250
00:15:49.291 --> 00:15:54.291
but I can't imagine if his accountant or his lawyer was in the crowd while

251
00:15:55.201 --> 00:15:57.690
watching them do that.
They just must have just been like,
yeah,

252
00:15:57.691 --> 00:16:01.470
well that's the end of my salary.
It's like we're not having Christmas this year.

253
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:06.360
Um,
I'll post that video.
You can just search for it by the end of this podcast.

254
00:16:06.361 --> 00:16:09.980
I'm sure you've already found it,
you know,
58 different places.
But,
um,

255
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.470
and the has showed me that when,
you know,

256
00:16:13.471 --> 00:16:16.590
we were getting acclimated to the time over here at like two in the fucking

257
00:16:16.591 --> 00:16:20.550
morning.
We were both wide awake and she showed me that and God damn it,

258
00:16:20.551 --> 00:16:24.600
that made me laugh.
That really made me laugh.
Um,

259
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:26.743
<v 1>okay,</v>

260
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:31.120
<v 0>who the fuck does the show and does crowd control?
And I wonder,</v>

261
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:35.990
that guy is so much fucking money.
Um,
he's wearing a lot of hats.

262
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:40.370
So anyways,
what am I up to here?
I'm gonna have to advertise it here in a second.

263
00:16:40.371 --> 00:16:41.990
So when we finally a

264
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.020
sneaky French guy gets off the fucking plane,

265
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:51.100
we get off the plane and uh,
and was the weirdest thing.

266
00:16:51.101 --> 00:16:56.101
We were connecting in Paris so I just thought we would just go connect but we

267
00:16:56.651 --> 00:16:57.011
don't,

268
00:16:57.011 --> 00:17:01.090
we had to go through security again already went through security to get on the

269
00:17:01.091 --> 00:17:04.810
fucking plane and now they want us to go through security again.

270
00:17:04.811 --> 00:17:07.420
And I'm like laughing and near like what do you think they,
I fucking somehow,

271
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:11.820
you know,
made a gun on the plane,
like fashion something out of,

272
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:15.010
out of the seat back.
Trey,
why are we doing this again?

273
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.640
And so we're trying to go through and I got to tell you something about French

274
00:17:18.641 --> 00:17:21.370
people.
They asked some cutten sons of bitches,

275
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.330
if you even remotely aren't on your game,

276
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.620
they'll try to pass you in the corners.
Like Formula One racing.

277
00:17:29.621 --> 00:17:32.650
Like when you're just standing there going through the zig zag maze when you

278
00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:34.120
tried to deal with these fucking people.

279
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

280
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:39.730
<v 0>And this one guy loves doing it so bad.
Nia finally just goes,
excuse me.</v>

281
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:43.300
And I was like,
yeah,
dude,
what's your,
I go,
yeah dude,
what's your problem?

282
00:17:43.301 --> 00:17:46.300
To some French guy.
And then I had to like stare him down.

283
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.930
Um,
this was standing into this fucking line.

284
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:57.030
It's going like half a mile an hour,
right?
So we finally get through the shit

285
00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:03.650
and then we get on the,
uh,
the Italian,
you know,
airlines and went,

286
00:18:03.651 --> 00:18:06.800
we're flying there you go over the fucking Swiss Alps.

287
00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:12.910
It's insane.
And then we land in Rome and it's the funniest shit ever.

288
00:18:12.911 --> 00:18:17.530
Like we're landing in Rome.
They never gave us anything to fill out.
There was no,

289
00:18:17.531 --> 00:18:20.020
what are you bringing into the country?
There was nothing.

290
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:21.820
<v 1>Yup.</v>

291
00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:26.770
<v 0>We go to the airport.
There was no,
there was nothing.
They didn't check as sin.</v>

292
00:18:26.771 --> 00:18:31.450
You just cut off.
Like I was getting off at Logan Airport was hilarious.

293
00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.070
So,
um,

294
00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:39.070
we get in the cab and as we're going into Rome,
I got to tell you something,

295
00:18:39.071 --> 00:18:43.640
these people on these scooters over here,
okay.
I,
I don't,

296
00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.150
I,
they might be the greatest writers on scooters.

297
00:18:47.151 --> 00:18:48.350
I don't know if he can respect that,

298
00:18:48.351 --> 00:18:52.400
but like we would be going around a turn and they would be like six of them in a

299
00:18:52.401 --> 00:18:54.410
row on our side of the road,

300
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.980
on the other side of the double line going around traffic on their side.

301
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:03.520
And my driver never slowed down and the guys in the scooter never slowed down.

302
00:19:04.251 --> 00:19:07.520
And at the last second they would pinch in to the double line.

303
00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.750
And as we went flying by him without a care in the world,

304
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:16.580
like centipede is what the video is like,
like a video game.
And uh,

305
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.220
I've kind of noticed that over had these fucking drivers are amazing.

306
00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:24.050
It's like the way people drive in Boston,
like that level of aggressiveness,

307
00:19:24.051 --> 00:19:27.140
except I've yet to see an accident and a,

308
00:19:27.141 --> 00:19:30.500
it even says in the little touristy book that if you're standing in the

309
00:19:30.501 --> 00:19:32.630
crosswalk,
if you want to get across,

310
00:19:32.631 --> 00:19:36.140
you have to make the first move because they don't slow down.

311
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.230
So it's yet another reason why I'm having the,
uh,

312
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.800
the time of my life over here.
And,
uh,

313
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.760
and then this Irish pub has just been this a waste.
It's like I just go on.
I,

314
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:55.250
I saw the Spanish stairs,
I went to the Colosseum and his mom's coming over here.

315
00:19:55.251 --> 00:19:58.850
So I didn't do any of the tours of any place yet.
But,
uh,

316
00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:04.040
I did just go over to look at the coliseum and it's just,
it's just insane.

317
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:08.150
You guys got to do it.
Okay.
Fuck.
I iPads,

318
00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:13.100
fuck phones,
flatscreen TVs and all of that shit.
Just,

319
00:20:13.101 --> 00:20:13.934
I mean,

320
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.990
come over here when no one wants to come over here cause it's fucking cold over

321
00:20:17.991 --> 00:20:21.700
here by the way.
Um,
which is a little bit of a disappointment,
but,
uh,

322
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:24.650
if some reason I just thought it was,
you know,
down to the Mediterranean Sea,

323
00:20:24.651 --> 00:20:28.540
I just kept thinking,
God father to right.
We'd be out in the country and,

324
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:32.300
you know,
meet some,
you know,

325
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.720
gorgeous woman and she'd go off to start my rental car and it would blow up.

326
00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.660
Then I would cry.
And you know,

327
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:42.110
Nia would comfort me and say that the threesome was over.
You know,

328
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.910
I had my drinks,
but it came over here
and it was cold.

329
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.070
It's been cold,
but

330
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.720
<v 3>seriously,
um,</v>

331
00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:56.110
<v 0>it's not that big a deal to come over here for forever.

332

Ooh,

401
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.820
Finally it finally happened.
Um,
so anyways,

402
00:25:22.821 --> 00:25:27.650
Nina's mom's is here,
so today we're actually going to go over to the Vatican,
uh,

403
00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.590
and you,
it was fucking hilarious like the other day and he was going like,

404
00:25:30.591 --> 00:25:30.861
all right,

405
00:25:30.861 --> 00:25:34.940
the pope's coming out is going to give mass at noon and I'm telling you like I

406
00:25:34.941 --> 00:25:38.930
look out my window and I can see the wall.
I can't,
I get to walk down the street,

407
00:25:38.931 --> 00:25:42.080
go around the corner,
but from basically I could see the wall

408
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:49.150
that surrounds the Vatican.
So she's goes,
you want to go down there?

409
00:25:49.151 --> 00:25:52.810
I'm like,
yeah,
I want to,
I'll go down there.
It's the fucking pope.

410
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:54.820
I see Elvis Caprice.

411
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:58.680
I got to go down and go see this guy and I dunno.

412
00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.880
Then I was laying in bed the next morning I was like,

413
00:26:00.881 --> 00:26:02.950
I don't want to cook but fucking go down there for what?

414
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:06.460
After all the shit that they've done.

415
00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.570
Like that's the place right there behind those walls where they were like,

416
00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.370
alright,
there's people fucking boys.
How are we going to handle this?

417
00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.160
And they did what they did.
Like,
why am I going to go down there?
I was like,

418
00:26:18.161 --> 00:26:18.994
you know what,
fuck it.

419
00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.940
But I do want to see that painting with as a person reaching out,

420
00:26:21.941 --> 00:26:25.930
touching the other person,
like the tea thing and they're sort of,
you know,

421
00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.560
you ever walked down the street with a male friend of yours and your hands

422
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.330
accidentally kind of graze one another,
you know,

423
00:26:31.331 --> 00:26:34.630
that awful creepy feeling with somebody painted that on a ceiling.

424
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.920
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

425
00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.260
<v 0>So,
and you know,</v>

426
00:26:38.261 --> 00:26:40.810
it's funny right now the amount of people that actually know the name of that

427
00:26:40.811 --> 00:26:44.940
and the artists and for some they feel that that means that they're smarter than

428
00:26:44.941 --> 00:26:49.440
me.
You know,
I don't think it does.
Who wrote that?

429
00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:54.120
Was that Michelangelo?
Michelangelo?
Was it the count of Monte Cristo?

430
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:59.700
Christoph?
Maybe
she read that book too.
Um,

431
00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.793
<v 1>yeah,</v>

432
00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.210
<v 0>we've gone into a couple of churches,
old churches here and I just,</v>

433
00:27:04.211 --> 00:27:06.220
I just don't like it.
I don't like the whole,

434
00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:10.210
I don't like the fucking mood they put you in.

435
00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:15.370
Like why do they have to make you so scared of dying and the afterlife,

436
00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:19.090
he can walk in and they got the candles.
It's all quiet.

437
00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:23.650
Why is it so fucking quiet?
Is God always taken a God damn nap?

438
00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:26.230
Is he ever in a good mood?

439
00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:29.800
I feel like he's some overbearing father and it's dad's home.

440
00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:32.820
Have you been quiet?
Dad's home.
I,

441
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:36.220
I absolutely fucking hate churches.

442
00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:40.450
I can't stand up a fucking one to two of them because I want to go in there and

443
00:27:40.451 --> 00:27:42.660
appreciate the fucking architect shift.

444
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.690
And I go in there and I immediately resent the fucking mood.

445
00:27:46.691 --> 00:27:50.230
They tried to put me in this hat and hand.
Oh my God.

446
00:27:50.231 --> 00:27:55.231
Am I living my life the right way is the invisible thing upset with me and

447
00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:58.480
creepy as church music.

448
00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:03.950
<v 4>Ha ha ha.
[inaudible]</v>

449
00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:05.150
<v 1>okay.</v>

450
00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.600
<v 4>La Boz,
all ba a,</v>

451
00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:14.080
<v 0>they just sitting there and people coming in and getting out of that fucking</v>

452
00:28:14.301 --> 00:28:15.140
knees.

453
00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

454
00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:21.590
<v 0>They make you do that at Walmart?
No.
Well there you go.</v>

455
00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.860
If you can't do the math on that,
I can um,

456
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:30.200
for whatever.
And He,
his mom goes to church.
She's a good person.

457
00:28:30.201 --> 00:28:32.840
So we're going to go over there today and tomorrow we're going to go to the

458
00:28:32.841 --> 00:28:35.630
Colosseum.
And those are the two tours de things that I'm doing.

459
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:39.470
Because other than that,
all that touristy shit,
he can take it,

460
00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.310
turn it up sideways and shoved straight up you fucking candy ass.

461
00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:47.390
Cause I'm not doing it.
I'm done with all of that shit.

462
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:50.520
Stonehenge.
Go Fuck Yourself.
I'd guide.
Look at that.

463
00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.480
You know what I like about Stonehedge?
She can like drive by it and see it.

464
00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.910
I'm not getting on a fucking plane for 15 goddamn hours next to some smelly

465
00:28:58.911 --> 00:29:03.200
French guy.
You know,
where every time he shifts in his seat,

466
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:04.670
I smell his fucking,

467
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.150
I dunno what the stress of his life.

468
00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:15.260
I'm not doing that for 15 fucking hours and then to go stand in line.

469
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.790
I'm not doing it.
He built,
nobody's saying you have to do it.
Good.
Well,

470
00:29:20.791 --> 00:29:22.350
I'm just making sure,
you know,
I'm not,

471
00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:28.280
this is what you do when you,
when you're,
when you're fucking

472
00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.440
<v 1>okay,</v>

473
00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.380
<v 0>here's some advice and I know you didn't ask for it.</v>

474
00:29:33.381 --> 00:29:37.410
This is unsolicited advice and God knows,
I love giving it out.
Um,

475
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:43.360
when you go on vacation with your fucking lady,
um,

476
00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:49.410
you just gotta you gotta remember,
you don't really have anywhere to go.

477
00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:55.560
So when they're walking really slowly and window shopping,

478
00:29:55.890 --> 00:30:00.890
just know that they have in the time of their life and just slow down and look

479
00:30:01.711 --> 00:30:04.040
in the fucking windows too.
Okay.

480
00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:07.980
Just plunge your hands into your pockets and you know,

481
00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.370
get your eyebrows up as high as you can get them and,

482
00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:15.990
and whatever she says just to be like,
oh yeah,
yeah,

483
00:30:15.991 --> 00:30:18.360
I can see that.
That is amazing.

484
00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:26.250
She was in the best fucking mode.
I finally decided,
hey,

485
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:29.770
why don't I stop being an Asshole,
you know,

486
00:30:29.771 --> 00:30:34.690
and stop walking 90 miles an hour to go look at where fucking Caesar's dipped

487
00:30:34.691 --> 00:30:39.691
his balls in a river and just fucking slow down and let her go to all these

488
00:30:39.761 --> 00:30:40.594
shops.

489
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.940
I finally think I realized that all these clothing stores over here for women is

490
00:30:45.941 --> 00:30:46.960
like,
I dunno.

491
00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:48.250
<v 1>Okay.</v>

492
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:50.920
<v 0>I Dunno what,
like me going to the pro football hall of fame.</v>

493
00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.210
He's probably a bad example.
I don't know what it is,
but they absolutely love it.

494
00:30:55.211 --> 00:31:00.211
And if you let them do it and you just go and you sit in that chair next to

495
00:31:00.221 --> 00:31:05.221
another sad fucking man and just sit there and let them try on shit and look at

496
00:31:05.861 --> 00:31:09.070
stuff they are having the time and they're fucking,

497
00:31:09.071 --> 00:31:13.090
let's one of the smartest things I've ever done in my relationship for like the

498
00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:17.330
first day.
All we did was just,
we went down the street that all,

499
00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.640
all these great stores,
all these hit my stomach,
growling her,

500
00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:26.540
all these fucking,
uh,
cool,
like,
oh,
you know,

501
00:31:26.541 --> 00:31:29.020
I don't know women,
they go on,
on the Internet and these,

502
00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.160
they make these clothes and there's only so many of them.

503
00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.290
And then they run out and then somehow target gets some and then they go down

504
00:31:37.291 --> 00:31:41.230
there when they fucking elbow each other and body slam each other and it's just

505
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:46.200
a fucking nightmare.
Like why don't they make an up close?
Um,

506
00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.220
they just don't make enough.

507
00:31:47.221 --> 00:31:51.870
They just deliberately make them hard to get and they get these women all out of

508
00:31:51.871 --> 00:31:55.740
their fucking minds.
The next thing you know,
you got to go drive to a target.

509
00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:59.220
On the other side of the four oh five to get something.
I don't know what.

510
00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:01.530
So when they come over here,

511
00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:06.270
they got all these fucking clothes that none of the bitches back in the states

512
00:32:06.271 --> 00:32:10.650
can get.
See,
you just let them go in there and try this shit on.

513
00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.440
You get him a couple,
two,
three things.
And you know what?
You're good.

514
00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:19.020
You could even if you meet your good,
you know,
so that's my advice.

515
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:22.480
Do that.
And then next thing you know,
they're in such a good mood.

516
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.810
They walked by a fucking Irish bar and they go,
hey look,

517
00:32:24.811 --> 00:32:27.660
they got the hockey game on.
I know you want to go in there,
you know,

518
00:32:27.661 --> 00:32:31.620
a little give and take.
You guys probably already know this shit.
All right,

519
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.050
so maybe I'm not even saying this to you.
Maybe I'm just saying it for me.

520
00:32:34.051 --> 00:32:37.430
So I fucking remember how not to be an asshole.
Um,

521
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:43.010
it'd be someone that you actually want to be on vacation with.
Uh,

522
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.710
anyways,
back to the podcast here.
So I was in that Irish pub and uh,

523
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:49.850
so they had on,

524
00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.600
they had on a hockey game they had on soccer and then they had on this rugby

525
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:57.080
game and it was rugby.
Uh,
was it Australia versus somebody else?

526
00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:01.250
And I gotta tell you,
man,
every time I come over here,

527
00:33:01.251 --> 00:33:05.300
I'm more sold on rugby.
It's just a fucking,

528
00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:07.730
it's just an awesome game.

529
00:33:07.731 --> 00:33:11.180
And I really feel like it holds the solutions to NFL football.

530
00:33:11.181 --> 00:33:14.870
If you're really going to talk about concussions and everything because

531
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.100
they just,
they lead with their shoulders.
You know what I mean?

532
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:24.930
Which I'm sure is how American football used to be.

533
00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:29.090
You know,
back when they had the leather helmets

534
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:34.520
and you stuck a tee shirt on your shoulder,
that was the only pad you may be had,

535
00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:37.820
like your leg with your fucking shoulder.
You didn't leave with your head.

536
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.150
Those helmets were the dumbest idea.

537
00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:43.660
We ever fucking hat.

538
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:49.330
Every God damn week there's another fucking NFL player killing himself or

539
00:33:49.341 --> 00:33:51.290
something.
It's terrible.
So anyways,

540
00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:56.090
she can watch the game knowing that these guys are all going to have back and

541
00:33:56.091 --> 00:33:59.000
knee problems and everything,
but you know,
that they're not going to fucking,

542
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.520
you know,
commit suicide through cops,
death by police,
you know,

543
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:08.990
that one or kill their whole family and then themselves because they weren't

544
00:34:08.991 --> 00:34:11.840
Tracy from slamming their head into somebody else's head for the rest of the

545
00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:14.810
time.
But,
uh,
it's a fucking awesome game.

546
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:20.810
And uh,
I dunno.
And then just the characters,
I don't know,

547
00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:24.440
half the guys fucking just you looking at the faces to ride in their minds.

548
00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.980
I was watching it.
The sound was down.
I didn't know what was going on.

549
00:34:27.981 --> 00:34:30.830
And like every five minutes I would just laugh my ass off looking at some

550
00:34:30.831 --> 00:34:35.780
fucking lunatic with long hair and a crazy mustache.

551
00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.960
It's just was awesome.
Totally sold on that game.

552
00:34:38.961 --> 00:34:42.080
And I know I've made fun of rugby on this podcast,

553
00:34:42.081 --> 00:34:43.700
but it's never like I didn't respect the game.

554
00:34:43.701 --> 00:34:46.430
The only reason why I did was because you fucking uninformed,

555
00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:50.090
ignorant shitheads who don't watch American football.

556
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:55.970
That because American football players have on helmets that they're somehow not

557
00:34:55.971 --> 00:34:59.300
as tough as rugby players.
All right,

558
00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:04.490
so you put me in a defensive place.
I have to defend it.
All right,

559
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:09.470
you fucking cunts.
There you go.
Anyways,
plowing ahead.

560
00:35:09.471 --> 00:35:14.350
Plowing ahead.
Um,
oh,
by the way,
I got to,

561
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:18.450
I have a book I want to recommend,
um,
Bobby or wrote a book.

562
00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:23.830
Uh,
it's called my story and uh,

563
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:28.210
I'm just blowing through it over here cause I got a little bit of jet lag and I

564
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:31.290
got to tell you like the beginning of that book,

565
00:35:31.291 --> 00:35:36.060
whether you're into sports are not a,
should be read at the very least,

566
00:35:36.061 --> 00:35:36.930
just the beginning.

567
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:41.960
You have to at least read that it should be required reading for anybody who's

568
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:47.280
going to be a parent or anybody in life who wants to,

569
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.173
I dunno,

570
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:54.540
either maximize their own potential or not get in the way of other people

571
00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:59.070
trying,
you know,
to develop whatever gift that they had.

572
00:35:59.071 --> 00:36:02.260
And he was basically talking to,
you know,
if you don't know hockey,
whatever,

573
00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:06.240
Bobby,
you are basically,
um,
he changed the game,

574
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:11.190
especially the,
the position of being a defenseman back in the day.

575
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:16.790
All the defenseman did when his team had the pop was basically skate up to the

576
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.600
Blue Line and just stop there.

577
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:23.040
And your whole goal was basically keep it in the offensive zone and not get

578
00:36:23.041 --> 00:36:27.700
caught up ice.
And,
but Babi Yar was so fast,
he would actually go down,

579
00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:31.020
crashed.
And that is first defenseman just score over a hundred points.

580
00:36:31.021 --> 00:36:35.910
Just a ushered in the era of an offensive defenseman,

581
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.690
which was,
was,
was completely unheard of.
Um,

582
00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:43.060
but when he started playing hockey,
he,

583
00:36:43.061 --> 00:36:47.280
he was playing forward and he was playing defense and he kind of switched off.

584
00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:51.360
And I dunno,
it just seemed like they naturally came together,

585
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.360
both aspects of playing,
you know,
both those positions.

586
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:58.530
But he was lucky enough to have a coach that didn't say like,
well,

587
00:36:58.531 --> 00:37:01.380
now you're playing defense and this is how you play defense.

588
00:37:01.381 --> 00:37:05.970
You played from here to here.
He actually let him create.
And,

589
00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:08.160
um,
I dunno,

590
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:12.660
I saw a lot of parallels to that and the business that I was in that I'm in

591
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:18.060
where it's like,
um,
he was talking about how,

592
00:37:18.061 --> 00:37:20.680
you know,
kids when they first started playing hockey should not be,

593
00:37:20.681 --> 00:37:25.620
you should not be introduced to any sort of system of playing hockey until,

594
00:37:25.621 --> 00:37:27.450
I don't know,
you like 50,
60,
whatever.

595
00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.270
When you start getting old enough where you're going to actually play in a game,

596
00:37:30.271 --> 00:37:34.170
that means something other than that you should just let kids create with the

597
00:37:34.171 --> 00:37:37.200
puck.
And it,
I dunno,

598
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:41.910
teaching a kid is basically a system when he's five years old is slowing down

599
00:37:41.911 --> 00:37:44.370
the growth of the game I would think.
Um,

600
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.370
and there's a lot of the parallels like within standup we're like,
oh,

601
00:37:47.371 --> 00:37:51.060
don't talk about this,
that isn't funny.
Or,
uh,

602
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.480
I don't know was people try to find their voice or whatever.

603
00:37:54.481 --> 00:37:58.910
There's like all these fucking rules.
I Dunno,
I,

604
00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:03.170
I tried to think of a,
of of actual spoken rule in comedy,

605
00:38:03.171 --> 00:38:07.730
but were basically just through watching all this other people doing stand up.

606
00:38:07.731 --> 00:38:12.350
You kind of get these ideas of like,
standup exists from here to right here.

607
00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:16.310
It's the same like idea people had on being a defenseman and hockey.

608
00:38:16.311 --> 00:38:17.860
I don't know as,

609
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:22.430
and I guess hopefully if you're an upcoming comic,
you're not working.

610
00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:27.050
You're not opening for some content of a headliner who's telling you as you go

611
00:38:27.051 --> 00:38:30.290
to do something that's outside of the realm of what they think is possible,

612
00:38:30.291 --> 00:38:33.800
that they go,
no,
you should never do that.
You should never lean on the mic.

613
00:38:33.801 --> 00:38:36.070
Stand with your left hand.
Always it on the right hand.

614
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.000
<v 3>I Dunno.
Whatever.
You know what he wrote it.
You read it.
He's a genius.</v>

615
00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:43.000
I'm a moron.
It took me fucking 10 minutes to get to that fucking point.

616
00:38:43.001 --> 00:38:46.540
I apologize.
Please do not judge the book on my rambling right there.

617
00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:50.560
Um,
all right.
And we to the point here,

618
00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:56.080
38 minutes and I've got to start reading some shit here.
Uh,
by the way,

619
00:38:56.081 --> 00:38:59.710
the Patriots somehow one another one.
And although let up,
what would we let up?

620
00:38:59.711 --> 00:39:04.560
31 points.
I was watching that Texans game and uh,

621
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.620
watching that game is why we're going to make the playoffs and also why we're

622
00:39:08.621 --> 00:39:12.490
probably going to lose in the first round because anybody with a defense,

623
00:39:12.491 --> 00:39:15.760
we're going to be in fucking trouble because we,
uh,

624
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.980
we have too many fork and injuries over there.
All right,
here we go.
Dubai.

625
00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:25.240
Hey Belle,
I think you would do great in Dubai if you would do a show here.

626
00:39:25.241 --> 00:39:26.590
Think about it.
Um,

627
00:39:26.591 --> 00:39:29.530
I have thought about it and I've thought about some of the things that I talk

628
00:39:29.531 --> 00:39:31.090
about and I've thought about how,

629
00:39:31.091 --> 00:39:34.690
I don't know what the rules are in your country.

630
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:38.230
And I've thought about getting beheaded while I was on stage.

631
00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.680
And I know most of that's probably ignorant because I've had friends who go over

632
00:39:41.681 --> 00:39:44.350
there,
but when I pictured doing stand up in the Middle East,

633
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:50.140
I a picture a bunch of women in Burkas me walking up there going,

634
00:39:50.141 --> 00:39:54.880
Hey lady,
why don't you show me what's under the rope there?

635
00:39:55.150 --> 00:40:00.150
And then I immediately get grabbed by some sort of secret police and a,

636
00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:03.160
then I'm in that orange jumpsuit rocking back and forth,

637
00:40:03.161 --> 00:40:05.890
slowly preparing myself to get my head sought off.

638
00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.690
Now I'm sure that doesn't happen,

639
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:13.400
but that's what I think of.
I would love to do it.
I'll fucking go over there.

640
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:16.790
Do you make shifts city with your tall ass build links?

641
00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:22.040
Uh,
the tent city right outside of it where everybody built the city.

642
00:40:22.041 --> 00:40:25.580
Isn't that how it goes?
And then Oprah goes there.
It's like there's no taxes.

643
00:40:25.581 --> 00:40:29.930
There's no nothing.
This is a utopia.
Um,

644
00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.780
did you ever see that when she goes to the happiest places on earth,

645
00:40:32.781 --> 00:40:36.530
she went to someplace in the Middle East where they said there's no taxes and

646
00:40:36.531 --> 00:40:38.960
everything's for free.
And she completely bought it.

647
00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.110
Like if you're going to live that way,

648
00:40:42.111 --> 00:40:45.350
that there wasn't then a group of people that you were just standing on top of

649
00:40:45.351 --> 00:40:48.760
their fucking heads.
Yeah.
Cheese.

650
00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.333
<v 0>Yeah.
You know,</v>

651
00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:52.981
<v 3>it's bad enough.</v>

652
00:40:52.981 --> 00:40:56.870
You pretending you're reading all of those God damn books and every,

653
00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:59.250
every once in a while when the fucking wolf set the door,

654
00:40:59.251 --> 00:41:03.060
you give away a bunch of fucking minivans to keep everybody at bay.
It's just,

655
00:41:03.061 --> 00:41:06.300
you know,
unfucking believable,
um,

656
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.640
Panama and they have red,

657
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:13.670
big fan of the podcast and listening to it for the best part of 2013,

658
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:18.990
you mean for the better part of 2013 and it's really an inspiration and a relief

659
00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:22.980
that there was angry people who react to shit like I do.
You should come.

660
00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:27.240
You should come down to Panama.
Ah,
Jesus Christ.
Well,

661
00:41:27.241 --> 00:41:32.241
what month can I go down there where I wouldn't just fucking IX fixie eight from

662
00:41:32.311 --> 00:41:35.930
the heat.
You're telling a redhead,
I should come down to the goddamn equator.

663
00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:40.180
Do what?
Catch malaria.
Um,

664
00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.850
a big part of the population speaks English.

665
00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:46.150
We were a US colony for a hundred years.
I know,
I remember that.

666
00:41:46.151 --> 00:41:50.800
And then Jimmy Cata didn't he give you your freedom?
Also?
The expat,
uh,

667
00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:52.660
Patriot community is huge.

668
00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:57.520
A lot of pasty all balls rolling our beaches.
Oh,
okay.

669
00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:01.690
The point is you would have an audience down here,
you would get,

670
00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:06.550
you would get kidnapped down here.
It's too hot.
Oh,
you wouldn't,

671
00:42:06.551 --> 00:42:07.384
she should say,

672
00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:09.730
I think you were trying to say you wouldn't get kidnapped down here.

673
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.010
It's too hot down here for that.

674
00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:17.850
<v 0>And thugs don't have the energy.
Thanks to the podcast and go fuck yourself.
Um,</v>

675
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.760
<v 1>okay.</v>

676
00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.470
<v 0>Oh,
what is that a dude down in Panama?</v>

677
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:27.150
The only thing I know about Panama is the canal and how you guys dug it and

678
00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:32.090
died.
And then we took the credit and then we own the Panama Canal.

679
00:42:32.091 --> 00:42:32.924
That's what it was.

680
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:37.070
And I think Jimmy Carter finally turn it back over to you guys.

681
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:43.110
And uh,
and then Manuel Noriega.

682
00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:49.580
And the only reason why I remember his name is because of that Sebastian Bach

683
00:42:49.591 --> 00:42:51.960
story that I told you guys.
But if you new to the podcast,

684
00:42:51.961 --> 00:42:55.230
I'll tell it really quickly.
When we were having a

685
00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:00.110
issues with Manuel Noriega,
which if I read up,

686
00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.690
I'm sure we put them in power and everything was cool.

687
00:43:02.691 --> 00:43:04.760
And then he wanted to run more of his country.

688
00:43:04.761 --> 00:43:09.200
And then we said he was a terrorist.
That's usually how it goes.
All right?

689
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:14.830
That's the dysfunctional relationship that we have with just about every

690
00:43:15.171 --> 00:43:18.560
country.
If that isn't a first world country,

691
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:23.690
we're would like that guy who keeps picking the psycho chick,
Manuel Noriega,

692
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:25.430
Saddam Hussein.

693
00:43:25.431 --> 00:43:30.320
We just keep picking the wrong person to stick into power that we can then use

694
00:43:30.321 --> 00:43:35.250
as a puppet.
I think on our first date with our next dictator,

695
00:43:35.251 --> 00:43:36.360
we really need to ask,

696
00:43:36.361 --> 00:43:39.410
what is his relationship with his parents or his parents divorced?

697
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:40.560
Are they still together?
You know,

698
00:43:40.561 --> 00:43:44.880
before we start making the same fucking mistakes again.
Um,

699
00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:46.650
anyways,
plowing ahead.

700
00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.920
You always wearing rubber manwell Noriega's fucking name is because I want you

701
00:43:49.921 --> 00:43:53.230
to Aerosmith show,
uh,

702
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:58.270
New Year's Eve show at the Boston Garden and a December 31st,

703
00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:00.630
1989,
I was a convicted drunk driver.

704
00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:05.660
I wasn't convicted at that point was I was I waiting trial or by arraignment I

705
00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:09.150
mean,
I just admitted guilty.
I mean,
I blew a fucking one nine.

706
00:44:09.151 --> 00:44:12.360
There really was no case there.
Um,
anyways,

707
00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:16.710
so I go to the thing and I'm stone sober,
skid row's opening up.

708
00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:18.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

709
00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:19.150
<v 0>And for some reasons,</v>

710
00:44:19.151 --> 00:44:24.151
Sebastian Bach decided to talk about world politics to a bunch of hair metal

711
00:44:24.231 --> 00:44:28.790
moron people like me.
And,
uh,
and this is how we got into it.

712
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.130
He was wearing leather pants,
of course it was required.
And

713
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.130
<v 3>he said,
hey man,
what's up with this man?
Well,</v>

714
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:39.990
and he grabbed his dick and he goes,
suck my fucking burrito man.

715
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:45.290
And there was a pause and everybody cheered anything he just said something that

716
00:44:45.291 --> 00:44:50.100
I think we should just knew this guy back to the fucking stone age man.

717
00:44:50.101 --> 00:44:50.934
And every just goes,

718
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:57.230
everybody sharing some reason we thought he just summed up our fucking puff for

719
00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:00.210
policy perfectly.
Uh,
but he's Canadian.

720
00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:04.980
So it's nice to hear him sound as fucking ignorant as an American,

721
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.030
you know,
hey,
it's a,
it was my stomach growled.
I just realized,

722
00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:13.470
I'm sort of hearing that in the background.
My stomach growling,
I got up earlier,

723
00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:16.500
I got to do the podcast.
What do you want from me?
Go Fuck Yourself.
Uh,

724
00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:19.560
and by the way,
I'm kind of shitting on America here.

725
00:45:19.561 --> 00:45:22.990
I'm not acting as if any other country would handle their position of power and

726
00:45:22.991 --> 00:45:26.790
you better than we have.
So fuck you and get off your high horse.
All right.

727
00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:31.680
Smelly roommate,
Billy,
the schmuck will face.
Sure.
Meal.
Uh,

728
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:34.980
oh by the way,
uh,
somebody uh,
helped me with my Yeti.

729
00:45:34.981 --> 00:45:38.660
Sheriff Schmuck is a grown man's penis.
A schmuck.

730
00:45:38.661 --> 00:45:41.880
Ul is what a little kid has.
All right.

731
00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.070
So when they're breaking each other's balls,

732
00:45:44.071 --> 00:45:46.380
I guess they say you went on a date last night.

733
00:45:46.381 --> 00:45:49.520
Did she touch your little schmuck over there?
Uh,

734
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:53.490
except they do it with more of a fucking Jackie Mason accent.
First off,

735
00:45:53.491 --> 00:45:55.350
love to stand up and podcasts.

736
00:45:55.410 --> 00:46:00.410
Looking forward to catching a you the next time you stop near Albany,

737
00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:05.010
New York.
I'm a 25 year old guy living with the 26 year old male roommate.

738
00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:07.440
Things are swell for the most part.

739
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.500
Swell with fucking year was this written,

740
00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:15.450
but he has some interesting quirks.
Most of these are no big deal.

741
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:19.860
I live with tons of roommates and I know the deal.
Pick and choose your battles.

742
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:20.640
However,

743
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:24.990
his stinky ass towel is starting to become an issue and I'm not sure how to

744
00:46:24.991 --> 00:46:26.100
confront him about it.

745
00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:31.580
He owns one towel and he only washes it every four to five weeks or so of Jesus

746
00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:33.983
Christ.

747
00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:34.400
<v 1>Okay?</v>

748
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:39.380
<v 3>Uh,
he showers every day.
Don't get me wrong.
Uh,
but you do the math.</v>

749
00:46:39.381 --> 00:46:42.650
The thing is stiff is cardboard and smells like death.

750
00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.510
Why would you do that?

751
00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:45.490
<v 1>Okay.</v>

752
00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:46.121
<v 3>That's a fuck.</v>

753
00:46:46.121 --> 00:46:50.500
There's nothing worse than a dirty towel after you come out of a fucking shower.

754
00:46:50.501 --> 00:46:54.310
You know,
you smelling like fucking fruit toast,

755
00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:59.440
whatever the hell bath,
body wash thing you're making,
they make it,
you know,

756
00:46:59.441 --> 00:47:02.810
you put it on you,
right?
They have French sheet.

757
00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:05.490
You put it on your specialty in your fucking arm pits,

758
00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:09.780
maybe a glue the bottle sought in half and stick it on a both armpits pitch you

759
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:11.440
cunt.
Um,

760
00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:15.040
and then he'd go out there and you take that dirty ass towel.

761
00:47:15.041 --> 00:47:16.240
Then you smell like shit again.

762
00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:17.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

763
00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:21.740
<v 3>Oh,
okay.
That guy's an animal.
And he goes,
he goes,</v>

764
00:47:21.741 --> 00:47:24.960
it's to the point where you can smell the damn thing outside the bathroom.

765
00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:26.940
I Dunno if he does,

766
00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.070
doesn't have a good sense of smell or if he's just used to it.

767
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:33.240
How the fuck am I supposed to confront him about his amp,

768
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:37.960
abnormal towel practices without hurting his feelings and making things weird.

769
00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:43.240
Thanks and have fun in Europe.
All right.
Wow.
Without hurting his feelings,
dude,

770
00:47:43.241 --> 00:47:48.160
fuck his failings.
This is what you do.
Go to bed,
bath and beyond.

771
00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:52.210
All right?
And just go buy him three cheap towels.

772
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.640
<v 1>Okay?</v>

773
00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:57.450
<v 3>And then call him into the bathroom and right before he gets there,</v>

774
00:47:57.451 --> 00:48:01.780
you're already have his old towel in the tub covered in lighter fluid and run.

775
00:48:01.781 --> 00:48:04.320
Did you hear his footsteps coming around the corner?

776
00:48:04.321 --> 00:48:09.321
You liked that towel on fire and you are sitting Indian style on the tank behind

777
00:48:09.421 --> 00:48:11.720
the toilet.
And as he walks in,
just

778
00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:16.040
<v 4>go,
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.</v>

779
00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:19.560
<v 3>And Kevin Monk,
just get them in that.
Oh my God,
I'm in church.</v>

780
00:48:19.561 --> 00:48:23.880
I'm not worthy of being here as you burn his fucking towel and never say

781
00:48:23.881 --> 00:48:28.740
anything.
Just be holding all three new towels.
And as she talks to you,

782
00:48:28.741 --> 00:48:32.520
what are you doing?
Or the smoke alarms going off?
Just never break character.

783
00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:37.190
<v 4>Well,
ah,
ah ha ha ha.</v>

784
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:38.590
Oh,

785
00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:42.580
<v 3>and just fucking
hand them the towels.</v>

786
00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:44.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

787
00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:47.110
<v 3>And then never bring it up again.
He'll get the point.</v>

788
00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:49.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

789
00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.740
<v 3>Do you want to go on more conventional group?</v>

790
00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:59.380
<v 0>Want to go more conventional route?
Just say,
Hey,
uh,</v>

791
00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:04.100
<v 3>this is what you do.
Your front end loaded with compliments,
you know?</v>

792
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:09.500
Yeah.
I love the way you part your hair.
Even when you eat crunchy cereal,

793
00:49:09.501 --> 00:49:13.040
it's not that loud.
And uh,
you know,
you like watching sports like me,

794
00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:16.760
having said that,
boy,
you might want to go with,
however,

795
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:20.630
either way your index fingers should be up in the air pointing towards the

796
00:49:20.631 --> 00:49:23.630
ceiling.
Not at him.
Don't be confrontational,
but do draw a line,

797
00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:29.260
<v 0>however,
finger up in the year,
you'll fucking bath towels.</v>

798
00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:31.183
Okay.

799
00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:33.870
<v 3>Just say what you told me.
It smells like death.</v>

800
00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.240
I can smell it on the other side of the door.

801
00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:38.093
<v 0>Okay.</v>

802
00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:44.800
<v 3>It smells like the arm pits of a French guy upstairs on an airplane.</v>

803
00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:50.930
You're fucking Rick's.
You got a guy.
I,
I,

804
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:53.420
if I,
you know,
what do I would buy him new towels?

805
00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.730
I would buy new towels and I would do it.
I would burn his other tower.
Literally,

806
00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:02.330
I would burn it,
burn it in the fucking driveway in the parking lot.

807
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:07.280
Like that fucking thing on fire.
Have a garden hose right there.
Make it safe.

808
00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:11.930
Maybe some baking soda depending on what sort of lighter fluid to use.
All right.

809
00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.160
I would burn that fucking,
yeah.

810
00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.550
<v 0>Thank you.
And just</v>

811
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:19.330
<v 3>that,
I mean,
the easiest way to do it is when he's not there,</v>

812
00:50:19.331 --> 00:50:20.470
you've just burned that.
If you don't,

813
00:50:20.471 --> 00:50:22.210
if you sound like you don't like confrontation,

814
00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:28.000
<v 0>uh,
you got to</v>

815
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.950
go quality of life here.
I would go quality of life.
Okay,
this guy,

816
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.600
Emmy,
you want,
you want the problem gone.

817
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:39.630
So I would burn his fucking towel and I would just have three other ones sitting

818
00:50:40.361 --> 00:50:42.790
there ready for him to go and just say,

819
00:50:42.791 --> 00:50:47.320
listen to every other week you got to do this,
man.
Okay.

820
00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:51.160
Because not only does your towels smell like shit,
then you wipe it on yourself.

821
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:52.270
You're going to smell like shit,

822
00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:56.380
and that's greatly going to affect the level of pussy that not only you're going

823
00:50:56.381 --> 00:50:58.240
to get,
but I'm going to get,
because if we come,

824
00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:02.020
if I bring a woman home and she comes in here and she smells that fucking towel

825
00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:04.290
and she's thinking it's me,
or even if she doesn't,

826
00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:08.050
she doesn't want that thing on our fucking upper lip.
All right?

827
00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:12.640
You smell like ass despite the fact that you're showering every day.

828
00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:15.850
It's not you.
It should towel.
It needs to be,

829
00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:21.830
you just fucking burned the thing.
All right.
And a safe way.

830
00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:26.290
Okay.
Do you accidentally burned down your apartment that's on you?

831
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.080
If he takes you to court,
is it going to take you to court over that?

832
00:51:29.081 --> 00:51:29.914
I don't think he is.

833
00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:35.950
I don't think he was he doing him a fucking favor.

834
00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:40.360
Go to fucking target is one of those goddamn places and you just go by.

835
00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:43.500
All right.
I'm gonna say the same thing over and over again.
That's,

836
00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:46.930
I always fucking hated that shit about having roommates.

837
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:52.950
That whole guy thing where you fucking live like a God damn animal.

838
00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:58.480
I've never understood that Latin dishes pile up and all that shit.

839
00:51:58.481 --> 00:52:02.320
I never did that.
I W I,
I was clean.

840
00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:07.000
My desk was always a fucking mess.
Come tax time.

841
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:08.920
I have receipts all over the fucking place,

842
00:52:08.921 --> 00:52:12.940
but when it came to food and uh,
hygiene

843
00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:18.700
plates,
trash being thrown out,
that stuff was all taken care of.

844
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:23.860
Alright.
Mike close might be all over the place.
All right.
But they were clean.

845
00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:29.040
Alright.
Ruined the mood

846
00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:31.320
<v 3>dear Billy salmon skin.</v>

847
00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:37.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

848
00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:41.950
<v 3>Ah,
that was a good one.
You fucking asshole.
All right.
Uh,</v>

849
00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:45.400
my boyfriend has been a fan of yours for a couple of years.

850
00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:46.750
<v 0>Okay.</v>

851
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:49.760
<v 3>Oh,
that was a lady saying that,
that makes it even funnier.
Look at you.</v>

852
00:52:49.761 --> 00:52:53.950
You're a hot shit in somebody can bag.
Yeah,
you're killing it on two fronts.

853
00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:57.970
My boyfriend has been a fan of yours for a couple of years and yes,

854
00:52:57.971 --> 00:52:59.320
I realized how sexist that was.

855
00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:03.520
He introduced me to your comedy and podcasts the beginning of last year.

856
00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:07.960
And since then I've been a fan.
We'd been living in different towns for the last,

857
00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:08.980
uh,
the last couple of months.

858
00:53:08.981 --> 00:53:11.350
Then I was finally able to go visit him for Thanksgiving.

859
00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:15.490
It's been a long time and I needed to scratch my itch there.

860
00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:19.900
So we're getting ready to get intimate and I tell him to play something because

861
00:53:20.350 --> 00:53:23.740
we didn't want the roommates to hear us in the throes of passion.

862
00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:28.380
And Lo and behold,
he turns on your podcast.
Oh my God,

863
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.450
that's fucking weird.
He goes,

864
00:53:30.451 --> 00:53:35.340
he was 100% ready to do it with your voice in the background.
Needless to say,

865
00:53:35.341 --> 00:53:39.330
my mood was killed.
Thank you,
Billy.
I don't,

866
00:53:39.331 --> 00:53:41.610
I don't tell you to play it door and you love baking

867
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.880
Jesus Christ.
What do you want me to add?
You got to talk to him.

868
00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:48.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

869
00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:51.280
<v 3>Why does he want the sound of my voice going on in the background?</v>

870
00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:58.260
Does he have a crush on me or is he one of the few males who has the ability to

871
00:53:58.321 --> 00:54:01.370
be laughing while coming at the same time?
But that's,

872
00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:03.630
is those two emotions possible?

873
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:05.400
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

874
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.390
<v 3>What would that orgasm sounded like?
I think it would sound a little sub line.</v>

875
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.350
Louis eighties comedy.
Everybody.

876
00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:17.530
I don't know what to tell you sweetheart.
Um,
I don't think that that's on me.

877
00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:21.740
What do you want me to do?
You want me to chrome for you?

878
00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:25.330
If you guys want to fuck to this podcast lady low,

00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:36.280
<v 3>Uh,

Lady Luck.
I just butchered it.</v>

882
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:37.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

883
00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:38.373
<v 3>You know,</v>

884
00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:43.020
it's funny about back then when like pedophilia was really underground on the

885
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:47.320
ground.
Thanks.
The undergrounds.
Yeah.
Um,

886
00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:49.510
<v 1>okay.</v>

887
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:51.280
<v 3>So there's a lot of the,
uh,</v>

888
00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:55.290
a lot of the lyrics back then is my stomach fucking growls again.

889
00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:59.460
A lot of the lyrics back then.
Like you couldn't get away with today.

890
00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:03.610
Like I was in some fucking bar over here.

891
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:05.600
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

892
00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:06.470
<v 3>And I wasn't even thinking,</v>

893
00:55:06.471 --> 00:55:10.520
I was just singing along to the song before Neopharma goes.
All right.

894
00:55:10.521 --> 00:55:13.790
That's creepy.
I think it's a,
it was Ringo Starr,

895
00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.680
yours 16.

896

00:55:34.271 --> 00:55:39.000
Singing about an underage girl under aged lady.

903
00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:43.840
People sit there nowadays and they sing that fucking sweet Caroline.

904
00:55:43.841 --> 00:55:45.700
I talked about that a Zillion fucking times.

905
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:49.540
He wrote that song about Caroline Kennedy when she was like 12.

906
00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:52.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

you'll,
you'll love is softer than a baby's touch.</v>

912
00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.930
I know what he means,

So I want to thank you guys for uh,
helping me clear up my garage.

962
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:12.840
I was getting nervous whenever I have anything new to sell that nobody's going

963
00:59:12.841 --> 00:59:16.810
to buy it and then what am I going to do with it?
Huh?
Send it back to Honduras.

964
00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:22.400
New banker scam a day.
Billy suppos.

965
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:25.550
Supposedly the housing market is on the rise again,

966
00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:28.010
but the reasons for it aren't being told.

967
00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:32.270
Big banks are buying up tons of homes across the country in cash with the intent

968
00:59:32.271 --> 00:59:34.580
to rent them out.
Not so bad.

969
00:59:34.581 --> 00:59:37.490
It's you realize that they're going to take those rental payments,

970
00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:42.260
group them together as a security and sell them to investors just like they did

971
00:59:42.261 --> 00:59:44.750
with the mortgage securities that tank the economy.

972
00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:48.590
So they basically made millions of people homeless so they could buy back these

973
00:59:48.591 --> 00:59:51.560
houses cheaper and then rent them back to us at prices.

974
00:59:51.561 --> 00:59:56.150
That will probably rise over time because they own the houses outright.
Uh,

975
00:59:56.151 --> 01:00:00.490
when will it end?
Here's the link to the article.
Well,
I hope that explains,

976
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:04.430
I don't understand what a security is.
I don't even know what the fuck that is.

977
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:06.793
<v 1>MMM.</v>

978
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:12.940
<v 3>All I know is that every dime that I have goes extra goes to Monday principal on</v>

979
01:00:12.941 --> 01:00:17.170
my house.
Uh,
and that's the way you should do it.

980
01:00:17.171 --> 01:00:19.270
If you're a youngster in you haven't bought a house,
Shit,

981
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:23.830
don't buy something where you can just make the payment by something.

982
01:00:23.831 --> 01:00:27.130
We can knock down the principal because banks,
they do own everything.

983
01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:32.290
And even when I pay off my house,
um,
just to put stomach,

984
01:00:32.530 --> 01:00:35.200
even when I pay off my house,
uh,

985
01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.860
even then it's just a matter of time before they own it again.

986
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:43.760
They just waiting for me to die and then they're going to get it back again.

987
01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:47.640
It's,
it's awful.
They own everything.

988
01:00:48.810 --> 01:00:52.500
They fucking own everything.
He goes.
Anyways,
just want to let you know,
uh,

989
01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:54.870
you've helped me through a lot in my life and I can't thank you enough.

990
01:00:54.871 --> 01:00:59.190
Thanks for doing what you do and go fuck yourself.
No worries.
Um,
all right,
well

991
01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:02.850
if you guys want to read more about this banking thing,

1004
01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:46.630
I don't really care much but think about it,
but I am writing to you about it.

1005
01:01:46.631 --> 01:01:49.270
So obviously I do.
I added that part.
He said,

1006
01:01:49.271 --> 01:01:52.690
but everyone now and then my friends telling me I should be taking advantage of

1007
01:01:52.691 --> 01:01:56.050
it.
I don't really know what that means.
I'm single and I date here and there.

1008
01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.940
Should I be looking for young tail?
Jesus Christ.

1009
01:01:58.990 --> 01:02:00.420
They have to spell it out for you apps.

1010
01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:03.820
A fucking lutely go get yourself a Letterman sweater.

1011

Maybe you look like you're 22.

01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:13.060
You know what?
You were raised right?
Or where are you?
You're 43 and single.

1013
01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.620
That means you're a psycho like me.
Uh,
is that what the kids call it?

1014
01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:18.763
Young tail.

1015
01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:24.170
Should I show up to an arcade fire concert in skinny jeans and live tweet the

1016
01:02:25.921 --> 01:02:29.310
concert?
How do I take advantage of looking and feeling young?
Dude,

1017
01:02:29.311 --> 01:02:33.660

1018
01:02:33.661 --> 01:02:37.080

1020
01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.590
I always just had a number that I couldn't go below and as I got older,

1021

what it was and I really think you were a fucking creep.

1023
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:55.410
If you're 38 and you can fuck a 22 year olds,
you're a fucking creep.
All right?

1024
01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:58.700

I wouldn't go younger than 26.

1025
01:02:58.701 --> 01:03:03.490
26 is starting to get weird.
