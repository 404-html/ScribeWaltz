00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:02.311
Hey,

2
00:00:02.311 --> 00:00:06.810
what's going on is bill bar and it's time for the Monday morning podcast from

3
00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:10.830
Monday,
October 5th,
2015 uh,

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.180
you're gonna have to deal with this.

5
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:14.400
This is the level of talking then I'm going to be able to do,

6
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:19.401
because I have a couple of guests here in my house and it's a 8:00 AM and I'm

7
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:24.360
trying to be courteous,
unlike the cunt that called me at six 58 in the morning.

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.230
I thought it was some fucking radio guy,
you know,

9
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.490
for some Gig I had back east,
I had no idea.
It was like,

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.070
I was like,
well,
what?
And he was like,

11
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.440
I guess my wife's schedule some fucking shit here at the house on Sunday.

12
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.450
Saturday.
She wasn't even aware of it.

13
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.660
I don't eat something about the fucking alarm.
He goes,
well,
anyway,

14
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:53.940
I have to reschedule that.
It's like,
well,
uh,

15
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.130
I dunno about this one.
I got to wait to,
my wife wakes up and he goes,
okay,

16
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:02.490
something I woke you up too.
It's like,
yeah,
it's six 58 in the morning.

17
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:07.491
You can't with your fucking morning DJ voice a,

18
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:11.240
it's any in the bull die.
We got bill coming up.
He had a bed as that.

19
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.380
He's got to be at two showers here in Maryland.

20
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.390
I'm sorry it was a bad morning DJ voice,
but you know something.

21
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.620
I'm trying to be courteous to other people in the fucking house here.

22
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.150
All right,
whatever.
Let's plow through the podcast here.
Uh,

23
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:27.931
I've got to say something.

24
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:31.980
I've got to get something right off right off my old freckled fucking chest
here.

25
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.330
Uh,
to start this thing.
All right.

26
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.580
The W hotel,

27
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.620
I am fucking done with that place at a great weekend,
right?

28
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.600
I did a couple of benets benefits out in,
uh,
DC and um,

29
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.090
one of the Tig Notaro set up for planned parenthood and it was such a fucking

30
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:58.650
cool crowd.
My whole set.
I just kept telling him that they didn't like babies.

31
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.540
One of my favorite things to do when you do a benefit as you go out there and

32
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:09.660
then you act like you don't understand the point of view of the people that are

33
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:12.690
doing the benefit,
unless it's something fucking horrific.
You know what I mean?

34
00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:14.910
Like if it's,
you know,
kids with cancer or something like that,

35
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:19.140
then I behaved myself,
but it's like planned parenthood or uh,

36
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.070
you know,
the right to life.
If it was the right to life people,

37
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:26.070
I would tease them that they've haven't looked at a census and how many people

38
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:30.430
are on the planet.
Um,
hey,
let's keep adding more baby.

39
00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:32.190
They'd would just do something like that,
something,

40
00:02:32.191 --> 00:02:36.180
anything to just kind of kill the fuck tensioned of the one subject that you're

41
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:38.340
not supposed to talk about.
So,
um,

42
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.560
it was just an awesome crowd and I kept going back to that and they had a great

43
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:47.790
sense of humor about themselves.
They kept laughing when I was saying it.
Um,

44
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.570
you know,
the rest of my act,
it was a little touchy dcs really fucking touchy,

45
00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:55.950
by the way.
If,
if what I found,
if you perform it,
the DC improv though,

46
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.130
it's a great crowd.
You get a couple of uptight people there or whatever.

47
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.380
Like if once you get out of the clubs and he becomes a bigger event,

48
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:06.430
like that benefit that was at like a theater,

49
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:11.080
it's just this really weird sort of um,

50
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.890
pay attention to what you laugh at kind of thing.
Like it's,

51
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.700
it feels like a political fundraiser for whatever fucking reason.

52
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:23.110
But a Friday night they were cool.
And then on Saturday,
um,

53
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.480
did the addiction benefit that a Marianne Geraldo,

54
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.030
Greg draw those wife put together and uh,
Jesus Christ,

55
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:35.740
what a fucking show that was everybody murderer and Tom Papa putting on a

56
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:40.000
clinic.
Nick Depaulo,
uh,
Judy gold.

57
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:44.830
Tig was on that one too.
Gary Owen.
I mean it was just a fucking,

58
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.460
just a monster show.
I know I'm going to forget a few people,
but uh,

59
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.270
everybody was route.

60
00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:54.580
What was really cool was it just a bunch of different styles in everybody with

61
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:58.630
their own style?
Absolutely.
Fucking destroyed.
And a dude,

62
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:00.100
I got to tell you something,
Nick Dipaolo,
man,

63
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.090
it's probably the most underrated comedian out there,
man.
If,

64
00:04:03.091 --> 00:04:07.060
if that guy's playing in your area,
you got to go see him.
He's fucking,

65
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.811
if you want to see,

66
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:12.811
just like completely uncensored somebody just saying exactly what they're

67
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:17.480
thinking,
ah,
that's the guy to go see.
And uh,

68
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.970
he does not take an ounce of shit from anyone in the crowd now.

69
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:24.950
Like he should be giving him shit.
But I'm just saying if,
um,

70
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.860
he addresses groaners put it that way,
is the best way to put it.
But,
um,

71
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.020
so it was great working with all those guys and I'm just had,

72
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.950
just had a great fucking nights.
So anyways,
so after the shelf Saturday night,

73
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.800
um,
you know me,
Tom Papa,
and uh,
you know,

74
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.490
Al Madrigal,
we all go out to a,

75
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.070
we all go out to a,
to dinner or something like that,
right?

76
00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:55.390
And have a couple of drinks and then we head back to the fucking w hotel or me

77
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:57.640
and Tom did anyways,
because that's where we,
where we were staying to.

78
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.750
And it was just an absolute fucking shit show.

79
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.280
That hotel,
I'm not saying it's a bad hotel,
but that hotel is for young people.

80
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.050
It's not for 47 year old fucking freckled Douche bag like me.

81
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.060
I just couldn't get over the level of shit faced.

82
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.490
This is coming from a drunk,
how fucking hammered these people were.
First of all,

83
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:25.050
I walked by the w hotel at like,
uh,

84
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.930
what the fuck was I with?
I was with somebody

85
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.770
and how the whole weekend kind of blended together,

86
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.800
but I swear to God it was the afternoon and these fucking,

87
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:39.840
these three like hot chicks come walking out with,

88
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.670
with tattoos on their titties,
like script writing.

89
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.450
They will horse horse just walking right out.

90
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.380
I'm not saying professional,
but you know,
if that should daughter,
you're just,

91
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:52.660
you just talking to a wall for the rest of your life being like,

92
00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:56.890
I completely fucked up script writing on your titties that I,

93
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.430
I'm telling you right now,

94
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:03.431
if you were a man and a woman walks up to with script writing on her fucking

95
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:07.370
titties,
I'm telling you,
you run in the other direction.
All right.

96
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.490
Nothing good is going to come from that interaction.
Okay.

97
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:11.960
And if there's any ladies listening out there,

98
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:16.961
I challenge you to find a wholesome woman who's going to be a good mother.

99
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.080
Was script writing on her teddies all right.

100
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.090
I'm sure you can find one.

101
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:25.760
Just like I can find a white guy that can dunk a basketball.

102
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:28.850
There's always fucking exceptions.
All right?

103
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.890
But I'm just saying generally speaking,

104
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:35.660
not even generally 90% fucking speaking my favorites percentage,

105
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.240
90%.
You just,
you just run in the other fucking direction.
So anyway,

106
00:06:39.241 --> 00:06:41.750
so we come back from the,
uh,

107
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.150
from the fucking dinner and dude,

108
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.140
like this woman was so folk outside,
this woman was so fucking drunk,

109
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.480
like the kind of drunk you get when you're in your 20s,

110
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.430
you don't know how to stop,
right?
Leather Pants,
right?
Dress like,

111
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:02.390
you know,
she's going to be an a Rianna video.
She's so drunk.

112
00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:06.770
The guy she's with is trying to hold her up and she's got her head buried into

113
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:11.030
him.
Like she's in like a rugby scrum,
just sorta trying to walk into,

114
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:13.250
and he's going,
sweetheart,
sweetheart,
sweetheart.
And we kind of,
I was like,

115
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:16.520
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck is all these,
you know,

116
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.330
fucking tattooed titty hose.
A walking out of the w.

117
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.800
What's so funny is when you check in the place during daylight hours,

118
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.080
like it seems like a nice hotel,

119
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.170
but they always had like the fucking club or duck club,
da Apostrophe,

120
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.350
whatever.
The young kids saying,

121
00:07:33.351 --> 00:07:38.290
somebody is up this spinning right when the fucking it,

122
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.270
it turns into an absolute fucking shit show.

123
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.530
And nobody can hold their alcohol or,
or fucking did too many drugs.

124
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:46.880
I don't want his,
he was his fucking,

125
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.910
this lady is like buried her head into this guy and his legs.

126
00:07:50.911 --> 00:07:52.260
She's trying to like,
uh,

127
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:57.440
get a first down and we looked away and then all of a sudden you heard,
boom,

128
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.550
the unmistakable sound of a head hitting something solid.

129
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.020
And she had fallen down on her backside and,

130
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:10.460
and her momentum carried her into the cab,
the side of the cabinet.
She was,

131
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.540
they were trying to stick her into,
and she fucking banged her head.
Um,

132
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:20.330
and then she got up
and was laughing.

133
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.190
And I w I,
I wanna say it was because she was a dumb cunt.

134
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.940
All right.
Now somebody could say,
well,
why don't you look at it like,
you know,

135
00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:31.760
she's got a sense of humor about herself,
like the right to life people.

136
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.540
You know what,
she was too pretty to have a sense of humor about herself,

137
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.160
you know?
And that's probably my,
you know,

138
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:43.670
issues with those types of fucking women.
Uh,
which of course most of it is.

139
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.300
But yeah,
I would just say no.
She just was like,
oh,
this is funny.

140
00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:51.080
Cause there's no consequences to anything I did because this is a drunk as I am.

141
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.190
I probably paid for one fucking drink this night.
You know what I mean?
Oh,

142
00:08:55.191 --> 00:08:57.860
this is stupid laptop.
Let me know.
I got to fucking message.

143
00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:59.563
<v 1>MMM.</v>

144
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.460
<v 0>So,
uh,</v>

145
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.290
<v 1>okay.</v>

146
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.210
<v 0>Yeah,
I think she just was enjoying the attention.</v>

147
00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:07.910
And then her boyfriend finally snapped and was like,

148
00:09:07.911 --> 00:09:11.120
will you shut the fuck up and get in the fucking cab?
And she was still laughing.

149
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.690
You know what I mean?
And I bet when it happens again,

150
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.100
she'll laugh again because no one will ever slap the shit out of her because

151
00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:22.850
she's a woman and it's against the rules.
You know what I mean?

152
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.550
So anyways,
so then me and fucking,
uh,

153
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:32.910
<v 1>okay</v>

154
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.840
<v 0>Tom walk into the,
uh,
not saying that you should slap the shit out of a woman,</v>

155
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:37.261
but you know,

156
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:40.200
there is something to be gained every once in a while when you've truly in the

157
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:44.820
wrong and somebody just slaps you in the fucking face and,
uh,
you know,

158
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.270
all you have to deal with this,
the stinging pain for about eight seconds.

159
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.930
There is kind of a,
uh,
let me,
uh,
what do I think about,
uh,

160
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.070
some of my behavior over the last couple of minutes.
Um,

161
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:00.670
another great advantage to being a guy.
Also,

162
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:05.460
you can have a beard so you can kind of cushion the sting of the slap is he

163
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:08.990
advocated domestic.
Um,

164
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.700
so then we go into the,
uh,
the w hotel.
Um,
by the way,

165
00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:15.361
what I just said,

166
00:10:15.361 --> 00:10:19.980
there is most bloggers fucking thought process before they sit down to type.

167
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.020
Um,
anyways,
so we go into the fucking w hotel.

168
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:30.320
And was that just like weaving our way through unbelievably fucking shit faced

169
00:10:31.281 --> 00:10:33.300
people?
Uh,

170
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.450
there doesn't seem to be any sort of concern as to how these people are getting

171
00:10:36.451 --> 00:10:38.340
home.
If they're driving.
It is a city,

172
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.700
so I guess everybody was sorta cabinet or ubering it.

173
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:42.870
I don't know what the fuck they were doing.

174
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:46.170
So weaving our way through these people,
we get to the fucking,

175
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.550
you get to the,
the,
the elevators and they got three elevators.

176
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.090
One of them goes up to the top with a bar is,

177
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.300
it's basically the shit show elevator.

178
00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.800
Then the other two is for fucking old people who just want to go to their room

179
00:10:59.801 --> 00:11:02.650
and go to bed.
And of course the shit face.

180
00:11:02.651 --> 00:11:05.550
People keep getting on the wrong elevators and all that type of stuff.
Right.

181
00:11:05.551 --> 00:11:06.570
So as we're standing there,

182
00:11:06.571 --> 00:11:11.571
all of a sudden this sea of fucking guys walked in wearing Tuxedos and for some

183
00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:16.010
reason they have these little stuffed animal ponies with them.

184
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.023
<v 1>MMM.</v>

185
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.650
<v 0>And they're just all come filing in to go to bed.</v>

186
00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:24.000
And I'm looking at Tom gone off,

187
00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:26.070
fuck these guys and they're fucking drunk as hell.

188
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.570
And the guy shows up next to me,
goes through you.
Odd By pony is fuck a guy.

189
00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:34.890
Right?
These guys were like over the top gay and they had like these Hitler youth

190
00:11:34.891 --> 00:11:36.990
haircuts.
It was really fucking bizarre.

191
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.050
And they had Tuxedos and these stuffed animal ponies or some shit.

192
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:42.543
<v 1>MMM.</v>

193
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.530
<v 0>I don't know what was going on.
I have no idea what the fuck was going on.</v>

194
00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:49.510
So we skip an elevator,
um,

195
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.540
and then wait for the next one to come.

196
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:56.690
And by the time the next shows up as another fucking heard of a Hitler youth,

197
00:11:57.011 --> 00:12:02.011
gay guys with ponies trying to get in this as you have scripted titty drunk

198
00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:06.340
girls trying to figure out how to get up to the fucking top of the place so they

199
00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:10.930
can get even more shit faced.
Um,
so anyways,

200
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:14.410
you get them to finally get on the fucking elevator and um,

201
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.890
you know,
I
fucking on,

202
00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:24.820
I gotta take this,
I got to hit pause here.
Hold on,
hold on,
hold on.

203
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.830
All right,
I'm back.
Sorry about that.
Sorry about that.
I get some fucking,

204
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.800
uh,
you know,
I had a relative pass away so I got to go to the fucking funeral.

205
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.750
Sucks.
Sucks.
I moved up when everybody moves up,
you know,
somebody in your family,

206
00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:43.090
you know,
passes away.
Everybody moves up a spot.

207
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:45.730
Everybody's sad and then everybody moves up a spot.
You know what I mean?

208
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:50.660
Who's next?
Who's next?
Right.
Fucking brutal.
Anyways,

209
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.370
so let's get back to the scripted titty horse.
All right.

210
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.710
The scripted TD,
who was all right and where,
where did I leave you guys?

211
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.470
Scripted titty whores.
Gay Hitler,

212
00:13:02.471 --> 00:13:05.680
youth guys with ponies all dressed in Tuxedos.

213
00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:08.830
Like they just gave a piano concert.
Oh.
However the fuck you said.

214
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.520
So I finally get all the way up to my room and then I walk up and of course my

215
00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:15.310
key doesn't fucking work.
Or maybe I have a key from the wrong hotel,

216
00:13:15.311 --> 00:13:17.050
cause I'm always on the fucking road.
I have no idea.

217
00:13:17.051 --> 00:13:18.610
So I got to go back downstairs,

218
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.870
get back on an elevator that's actually empty and they go downstairs,

219
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:27.750
doors open up more Hitler youth,
gay guys,
more scripted titty whores,

220
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.600
more fucking rugby scrums and uh,

221
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.620
get my key and I get back up there and I was just like,
Eh,

222
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.690
it's just shit shelf.
I'm not saying it's a bad hotel,
you know what I mean?

223
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:40.810
It's a fucking great hotel if those,
if that's what you're into.

224
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:42.850
You know what I mean?

225
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.630
Like stay there during the week I think is fine if you're an old man like me,

226
00:13:46.631 --> 00:13:51.160
but on the fucking weekends it is an absolute fucking shit show.

227
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:55.060
Like it was literally,
it looked like a convention for reality shows,

228
00:13:55.810 --> 00:14:00.280
you know what I mean?
Uh,
stopped writing script on your titties,
you know,

229
00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:04.060
on VH one.
I'm gay,
show Pony,

230
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.950
World War II plants a piano concert.
Oh,
for the,

231
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:14.050
for the straight guy,
whatever the fuck you want to call it.
Um,
and uh,

232
00:14:14.051 --> 00:14:18.760
you know,
Doug Kahn,
rugby chicks,
whatever the fuck you want to call it,

233
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:22.000
but it was a tonight.
Now I'm done.

234
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.460
And you always funny it was during the day,

235
00:14:24.461 --> 00:14:26.560
I was already starting to get that feeling like,
you know,
I,
I,

236
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:30.530
the second year you get into the WWE when they have like that fucking debt,

237
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:31.601
that option,

238
00:14:31.601 --> 00:14:36.601
we can have like that neon aquarium lighting around your fucking a bed,

239
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.220
you know,
cause young people thinks that,
that,

240
00:14:39.221 --> 00:14:41.620
that like enhances their sexual experience.

241
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.810
What they're really doing is they're trying to cover for the fact that they

242
00:14:43.811 --> 00:14:46.420
don't quite know what the fuck they're doing.
You know what I mean?

243
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.120
Or maybe it's of the drug thing.
I have no idea.

244
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:55.430
But I remember that when I was younger and I was going to hook up,

245
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.880
it was all about like the lighting and having the right CD.

246
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.360
It was all this extra shit that you needed to cover up for the fact that you

247
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:04.850
didn't quite know what the fuck you were doing.
At least that was for me,

248
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:10.160
whenever I'm just a grumpy old man,
don't listen to me.
So anyways,
I fucking,

249
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.013
uh,

250
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.340
so the food sucks at the w and it's fucking like a zillion dollars.
So I'm like,

251
00:15:16.341 --> 00:15:18.970
all right,
I'm going to walk down the street.
Okay.
And I'm going to fucking,
uh,

252
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.640
maybe find something.
So I'm walking down the street,

253
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:27.470
it's Saturday afternoon and Hello Annie.
Anna Bama is going to play,

254
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.590
uh,
the Georgia bulldogs between the hedges,
right?

255
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:36.040
Georgia is favored because Alabama lost to ole miss the fucking week before in

256
00:15:36.861 --> 00:15:40.580
Georgia is actually given two points.
And in the back of my head I was like,

257
00:15:40.581 --> 00:15:45.470
if there was ever a fucking gift it would be Alabama getting points.
But,
uh,

258
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.800
fortunately I don't have access to a fucking,

259
00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:53.810
I'm a sports book.
So,
which is good because that saves me a bunch of money.

260
00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:56.990
Cause anytime you sitting there thinking like,
oh my God,
this is a fucking gift,

261
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.440
you end up losing.
So I walked down the street like two blocks,

262
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.880
not even a block and a half.
And I see this problem like art,

263
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:08.450
I'm gonna go in there and turns out it's this fucking insane cigar bar slash

264
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:12.110
sports bar.
I pop in there,
right?

265
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.590
This is fucking guy sitting there,
this southern dude with,

266
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.840
with the Georgia bulldog logo on.

267
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.250
And then there's like this old Jewish dude sitting there and old Jewish dudes

268
00:16:22.251 --> 00:16:25.640
are the fucking best man.
They're the fucking best giving ridiculous,

269
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:30.670
ridiculous fucking life advice at the most easy going pace ever.

270
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:36.200
Are you married?
Are you in love?
Well,

271
00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:38.150
that's good,
right?
And they just won't,

272
00:16:38.151 --> 00:16:41.510
they'll walk you all the way through fucking life.
They're the best,
right?

273
00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.890
So anyways,
um,
so I'm sitting with that dude.

274
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.610
And then there's the other guy,
you know,
and they both got cigars going and a,

275
00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.700
I'm thinking like,
wow,
fucking smoke one later tonight.

276
00:16:52.701 --> 00:16:54.890
I'm not gonna smoke during the day,
but I'm going to watch the fucking game.

277
00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:59.240
So they put the game on the crowd's going nuts,
right?

278
00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.740
Fucking Georgia bulldogs that jumping up and down Alabama comes out,

279
00:17:03.741 --> 00:17:05.120
they get right in their fucking face.

280
00:17:05.121 --> 00:17:08.540
I'm getting amped up like I'm going to play the game right?
And it's a cigar bar.

281
00:17:08.541 --> 00:17:11.390
So it's a chill fucking vibe.
You can hear the game.

282
00:17:11.391 --> 00:17:14.390
Everything's great all of a sudden,
right?

283
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:19.420
It literally is the fucking games going to start this tabletop of five or six

284
00:17:19.461 --> 00:17:24.461
people walk in with this fucking smug jackass who just has a fucking opinion on

285
00:17:27.021 --> 00:17:29.300
everything that he thinks is so God damn fascinating,

286
00:17:29.301 --> 00:17:32.450
which is kind of funny to hear me say,
but at least I know I'm a moron.

287
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.920
God knows I got an opinion on everything,

288
00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:37.670
but I know I'm a fucking moron and I also know that when you go into a fucking

289
00:17:37.671 --> 00:17:41.570
cigar bar,
it's an old man vibe.
Okay,

290
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.860
inside old man voices,
right?
This fucking fat con.
I swear to God,

291
00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.750
remember that show Jake and the fat man,

292
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:53.140
he looked like the fat he sits down and proceeds to start speaking as loud as

293
00:17:53.391 --> 00:17:56.030
you could possibly fucking talk without yelling.

294
00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:00.500
And he keeps talking about these.
He tells his fucking story like three times,

295
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:05.750
but the cigarettes he got in London that for some reason are not legal in the

296
00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:09.980
United States.
He and he kept going like it's London,

297
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.520
but you cannot get them here.
I've tried to order them,

298
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.850
but they are not legal and he would always end it the same way.

299
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:21.100
They are not legal.
Then he'd go,
why?
I don't know.

300
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.020
Told that story three times.
He only told it twice,

301
00:18:24.021 --> 00:18:28.200
but I want to say it felt like fucking three and a

302
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.880
is,
he's fucking screaming.
I find,
look over at the old Jewish jewel,
Mike,

303
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:37.430
if you say,
can you believe this guy?
And the old Jewish guy said something like,

304
00:18:37.431 --> 00:18:38.810
you know,
I feel the same way.

305
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:42.920
Like when you get on a plane and there's a baby crying next to you.

306
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:47.580
And I laughed.
I go,
yeah,
but this guy should know better.
And then the guy goes,
I,

307
00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.170
he goes,
any fucking,
he just got up and left,

308
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.080
you know,
cause he,
what he had on him,

309
00:18:54.081 --> 00:18:57.980
he had this beautiful fucking Cohiba and he knew better.
He's like,

310
00:18:57.981 --> 00:19:02.450
I'm not going to fucking sit here and smoke this unbelievable cigar with this

311
00:19:02.451 --> 00:19:06.710
fat fuck screaming across the God damn room.
Right.

312
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.730
That'd be like if had like a great glass of wine and the whole time you're

313
00:19:10.731 --> 00:19:13.130
drinking it,
there was some guy yelling in your fucking here.

314
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:18.460
So he gets up and leaves and I sat there and watched the whole first quarter

315
00:19:18.681 --> 00:19:23.681
while simultaneously trying to think of a nice way to asset guide politely to

316
00:19:24.861 --> 00:19:26.090
shut the fuck up.

317
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.150
Could somebody please help me with this social moment because um,

318
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.000
I was literally muttering over in the corner like I be like,

319
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.010
and no matter how much I tried to be nice,

320
00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.260
like by the time I got to the end of the sentence,

321
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:44.090
the rage would come in and I would drop the F.
Dot.
I been,
excuse me,
sorry.

322
00:19:44.091 --> 00:19:45.890
You know,
I'm not trying to be a jerk here,
but uh,

323
00:19:45.891 --> 00:19:49.260
you sort of yelling and you know,
you're in a fucking cigar bar.
I get dumped.

324
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:54.110
[inaudible] you can't do that.
Can't do that.
Back it up.
I'm sorry.

325
00:19:54.111 --> 00:19:57.350
I'm not trying to inhibit you from having a good time,

326
00:19:57.351 --> 00:20:01.160
but for some fucking reason you don't give a shit that you're doing that to me.

327
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:06.230
You Fat.
Fuck right.
They did.
I just kept going like that.
Right.

328
00:20:06.231 --> 00:20:09.250
So I never ended up saying anything.
And I finally,
uh,

329
00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.640
<v 2>okay.</v>

330
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:11.930
<v 0>I don't know.</v>

331
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:16.650
I left after the first quarter and I went back to the fucking w hotel.

332
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.480
And,
um,
by the way,
Jesus Christ,
Huh?

333
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.860
Alabama coming back answering the belt.

334
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:31.770
Absolutely fucking kick the shit.
I,
the only,

335
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.120
the more they could have done was ripped.

336
00:20:33.121 --> 00:20:37.050
The hedge is out of the fucking ground and God knows I was rooting for Georgia.

337
00:20:37.051 --> 00:20:40.140
I don't even,
I don't even hate Alabama.
It's just you have to root against them.

338
00:20:40.141 --> 00:20:44.190
It's so fucking good.
And uh,
you know what?
I forget the guy's name.

339
00:20:44.191 --> 00:20:47.160
Who is that number two,
that running back that Alabama has?
Jesus.

340
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.990
That guy's a fucking beast.
I don't know the names.

341
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:53.500
I know number seven on Lsu is a monster.
This guy number two,

342
00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:57.010
like they're making these new kinds of fucking running backs.
I don't get it.

343
00:20:57.011 --> 00:20:58.180
They're built like full backs,

344
00:20:58.181 --> 00:21:03.181
but they run as fast as running backs and then they lower the shoulder and they

345
00:21:03.251 --> 00:21:06.340
just absolutely destroy people.
But,
um,

346
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.740
unbelievable.

347
00:21:08.741 --> 00:21:13.390
A college matchups this weekend,

348
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.860
but none of them turned out to be the games like the back and forth that you

349
00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:19.000
thought they were going to be.
Huh.

350
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.130
Fucking Alabama kicks the shit out of Georgia.

351
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:29.350
And then Florida who was also undefeated but was getting no respect was playing

352
00:21:29.351 --> 00:21:33.790
ole miss in the swamp.
And everybody's thinking,
well Ole miss beat Alabama,

353
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:37.120
right.
They're going to have their way with Florida and Florida.

354
00:21:37.121 --> 00:21:40.930
Absolutely kick the fucking shit out of him.
I got to see that game too.

355
00:21:40.931 --> 00:21:44.160
I watched the replay last night and um,

356
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.840
and then Notre Dame,
Clemson,

357
00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:50.860
I was rooting for Notre Dame cause I'm going to Notre Dame USC game and I was

358
00:21:50.861 --> 00:21:53.830
obviously hoping that Notre Dame would win so they'd be undefeated in the game

359
00:21:53.831 --> 00:21:56.050
would mean even more when they played USC.

360
00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:01.150
And as far as I can tell they got handled cause I haven't seen that game yet.
Um,

361
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.120
that game was going on while I was doing the,
uh,

362
00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.870
the Geraldo addiction benefit and um,

363
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:12.310
but one of the stage hands had the game going and I just know it was like 14 to

364
00:22:12.311 --> 00:22:14.680
three forever.
They kind of went out early.
But,
um,

365
00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:18.730
the only game that was really fucking close and exciting was probably a game

366
00:22:18.731 --> 00:22:22.540
nobody thought it was going to be,
which was a hio state versus Indiana,

367
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.770
which I ended up turning on towards the ending because Alabama was just,

368
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:30.040
Georgia just couldn't answer the fucking bell.
Um,

369
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.520
so I ended up putting that thing on and,
um,

370
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.050
what a fucking game that was.
I love our,

371
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.630
Osu kept thinking they put Alabama to bed now put him to sleep.

372
00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.720
Like they had that one touchdown pass and the guy does the old slip,

373
00:22:43.721 --> 00:22:47.230
the fucking throat thing.
Like that's it.
Nail in the coffin,
which,
you know,

374
00:22:47.231 --> 00:22:50.320
I felt it was too in Indiana.
Just kept coming back.

375
00:22:50.321 --> 00:22:53.410
I didn't know Indiana was that good.
They were also undefeated.
So,
uh,

376
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:58.330
when I'm trying to say is that when I wasn't weaving in and out of scripted

377
00:22:58.331 --> 00:23:01.930
titty horses fucking weekend as I watched a lot of God damn football.

378
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:07.760
I'll talk NFL here in a minute.
Let me,
uh,
let me get back to the,
uh,

379
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:12.310
kind to do a little bit of ad advertising here.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Sorry,

380
00:23:12.311 --> 00:23:13.870
I have to hunt my password and I forget.

381
00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.840
Oh Jesus Christ.
You got to put in 50 fucking God damn things now.

382
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.190
And of course it's wrong.
And of course it's fucking wrong,
you know,

383
00:23:24.191 --> 00:23:27.460
it's just my fucking podcast.
Why the fuck I mean my laptop?

384
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:33.190
Why the hell would I know how to do it?
Come on.
Come on.
Uh,
Bam.
There we go.

385
00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.900
All right,

Why are you torturing yourself with a gross old blade week after week?

390
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:52.790
You know why?

391
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.850

398

399

Don't say they ate.
Sorry.

414
00:25:19.341 --> 00:25:23.870

They make your balls feel like they're on air.
Yeah,

415

Put 'em on your Rhonda carriage.
Alright me,
Andy's,

418
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:39.560
we all know how sexy confidence can be.
Hey,

419
00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.350
and that confidence comes from being comfortable.

420
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:46.280
But how great can you feel if your underwear is wrinkling and riding up on your

421
00:25:46.281 --> 00:25:50.270
balls?
They're creeping up years me gets it.

422
00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:53.030
And that's why they've created the world's most comfortable underwear for a

423
00:25:53.031 --> 00:25:54.380
daily dose of confidence.

424
00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:58.310
You wear underwear every day unless you're Matthew mcconaughey or a scripted

425
00:25:58.311 --> 00:26:01.880
teddy who were,
that's three to 65 days a year.
Rain or shine.

426
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.510
You need to be extraordinary with that without an insane price tag.

427
00:26:05.511 --> 00:26:08.300
We undies understands this and that's why they've created the world's most

428
00:26:08.301 --> 00:26:09.260
comfortable underwear.

429
00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:14.440
Luxury for your balls at half the retail price you'd find anywhere else.

430
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:18.420
When you look good,
you feel great.
It's a cliche because it's true me.

431
00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:20.970
Andy's understands this and that's why they designed underwear.

432
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:25.700
They makes you look and feel fantastic.
Uh,
modelle me,

433
00:26:25.701 --> 00:26:29.210
Andy's has made from Odell a fabric that's twice as soft as cotton.

434
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:32.660
There's twice as soft it,
what is it?
Is it from the Madell tree?

435
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.400
There's this manmade stuff.
Who knows?

436
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.480
But who knows how softer cotton is other than men,
you know,

437
00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.380
who have cotton up against their balls?
Uh,

438
00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:44.250
that's twice as soft as an whatever you're wearing right now.

439
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:47.620
And he says tons of colors and styles and the only place to get matching pairs

440
00:26:47.621 --> 00:26:51.730
from men and women,
they even release a new design every month.
Um,

441
00:26:51.731 --> 00:26:55.090
I wear whatever pair that they ever fucking send me and they feel great against

442
00:26:55.091 --> 00:26:58.500
my balls.
No complaints here.
Plus we all know what a,

443
00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.140
that paying for shipping sucks.
So Mandy says,

444
00:27:01.141 --> 00:27:03.550
removed from the equation that from the equation,

445
00:27:03.551 --> 00:27:07.480
all our orders in the u s and Canada shipped for free.
You,
me,
undies even go.

446
00:27:07.481 --> 00:27:08.800
It gives you a money back guarantee.

447
00:27:08.801 --> 00:27:11.770
If you don't love your first pair and you get to keep those for free,

448
00:27:11.771 --> 00:27:14.170
you literally have nothing to loose.
All right?

449
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:16.140
<v 1>To sweeten the deal,</v>

We got?

455
00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.180
All right,
let's do two.
One,
two.
All right.
Those are the first two.

456
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:41.550
Let's get back to the fucking podcast here.
NFL football.
Why pop?
Blah,

457
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.260
Podo Boda um,

458
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.940
I actually took an early flight out.

459
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.410
<v 2>Okay.</v>

460
00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:52.320
<v 1>So I could get back in time to watch the NFL football,</v>

461
00:27:52.321 --> 00:27:57.270
which I was able to do by the way,
by the way,
when I was on the plane,

462
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:01.500
I watched a guy in dress socks.
They weren't gold toes,
they were whatever.

463
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.690
I don't know if they were compression socks.
I don't know what they were,

464
00:28:03.691 --> 00:28:07.080
but they were porno socks,
dark colored socks.

465
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.610
And I watched this guy walk into the,
the bathroom on the airplane.

466
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.360
<v 2>Okay?</v>

467
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.530
<v 1>In socks.</v>

468
00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:16.960
<v 2>Okay.</v>

469
00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.180
<v 1>Which in some weird way is actually</v>

470
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:20.690
<v 2>okay</v>

471
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:21.800
<v 1>as gross.</v>

472
00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:26.620
He's fucking walking in with your bare feet,
you know what I mean?

473
00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:30.940
Cause there's something about socks that they like absorbent to take fucking

474
00:28:30.941 --> 00:28:34.570
urine and fecal matter and have 'em up against your feet for the rest of your

475
00:28:34.571 --> 00:28:35.404
fucking fly.
But

476
00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:38.680
<v 0>what the full kind of a fucking animal.</v>

477
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.220
<v 2>Okay.</v>

478
00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.280
<v 0>I shouldn't say the guy like,
dude,</v>

479
00:28:41.281 --> 00:28:44.810
do you realize you just walked into a public bathroom and your socks

480
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.430
are you out of your fucking mind?

481
00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:50.430
<v 2>Okay.</v>

482
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:55.430
<v 0>At the very least these like 20 people's fucking urine in your socks,</v>

483
00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.810
up against your fucking skin animals.

484
00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.580
And then I'm also thinking like,
you know,

485
00:29:02.581 --> 00:29:07.110
maybe this guy is preparing for when the dollar collapses or whatever and you

486
00:29:07.111 --> 00:29:09.930
just got to start eating squirrels and everything and,
and maybe,

487
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.820
maybe your neighbor.
And as I'm sitting there puking,
you know,
like Henry Hill,

488
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.090
when they dig up fucking Billy batts and I can't handle it,
you know,

489
00:29:18.091 --> 00:29:20.340
and he's just sitting there,
he's ready for you and give a fuck.

490
00:29:20.341 --> 00:29:23.260
He walked into a public bathroom and his fucking stock and feet.

491
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:25.980
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

492
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:30.780
<v 1>Absolute fucking animal and had this really nice male stewardess on there.</v>

493
00:29:30.781 --> 00:29:33.570
But every time you went to talk to me he put his hand on my shoulder.

494
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.250
Take your hair.

495
00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:42.490
<v 0>May,
oh Stewart is you're me out.</v>

496
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:48.190
I can hear your voice.
Stan Lee,
I don't know.

497
00:29:48.191 --> 00:29:51.360
I think his name is Stanley.
It's an old person name.
Um,

498
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.690
I need to make a human connection,
which who likes the more peanut.

499
00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.220
Um,
so anyways,
I landed in time.
Uh,

500
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.810
I only missed the first half of the first game and I went in and I watched the

501
00:30:04.811 --> 00:30:06.190
giants versus the bills.

502
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:11.560
This makes no sense because I am a patriots fan,
but I fucking love the giants.

503
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.640
I love the giants though.
He's got a great fucking defense.
You see that maniac?

504
00:30:15.641 --> 00:30:20.050
They got our defense,
the guys five 10,
10 if guys five,
four,

505
00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:23.170
10.
I'm so impressed.
My voice is cracking guys.

506
00:30:23.171 --> 00:30:25.690
Five foot 10 playing on the defensive line,

507
00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.470
plowed through two guys that got to fucking sack guys a fucking animal.

508
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:34.510
You Literally Watch.
And Rudy,
you know what's funny,
unlike the movie Rudy,

509
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.110
where the dude playing them look like an absolute pussy who shouldn't even be

510
00:30:38.111 --> 00:30:42.160
playing fucking volleyball.
This guy looked like a fucking animal.

511
00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:46.900
It's like he was five,
10 but it was built like he was fucking six for um,

512
00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:48.690
you know,
they got Odell backup.

513
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.880
You see that catch the guy made it didn't even count was so fucking
unbelievable.

514
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.950
It's still made the highlight reel.
And um,
I dunno,

515
00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.460
I was watching what rex could do against a team like that.
Plus,
you know,

516
00:31:00.461 --> 00:31:04.390
rex in our division and a,
I know that we're going to be playing the giants.

517
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.720
I don't know how the fuck we're ever going to beat him.
We never beat them.

518
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.880
They beat us an exhibition.

519
00:31:09.881 --> 00:31:11.980
They beat us in the playoffs to beat us in the regular season.

520
00:31:11.981 --> 00:31:16.210
I don't think we've ever beat the giants during the Tom Kauflin,

521
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:20.350
Eli Manning,
um,
error.

522
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.080
I wonder when the last time we beat we beat them ones.

523
00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:26.590
I'm sure some fucking nerve to go out there and let me know or tell me that I'm

524
00:31:26.591 --> 00:31:29.620
wrong.
Oh,
Julian fluky booboo or any significant game,

525
00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:32.320
they always kick our fucking ass.
So,
um,

526
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:36.570
but I always loved defensive minded teams.
Um,

527
00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.810
so even though they beat us,
I mean,
what am I going to get mad?

528
00:31:39.811 --> 00:31:43.780
Cause they always beat us.
That's on us,
right.
Figure out how to fucking beat him.

529
00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:48.250
So anyways,
so,
and I also love watching rex loose.
It's fun,

530
00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.560
you know,
and uh,

531
00:31:50.561 --> 00:31:53.770
if I could watch him lose while he wears a pink hat and headsets,
I mean,

532
00:31:53.771 --> 00:31:56.890
that's even better.
So,
uh,
I watched that,
uh,

533
00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.550
still buffalo looked pretty good man and I think they're a,

534
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:04.150
their quarterback there.
What is it?
Travis Trent,
the black version of that name.

535
00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:07.510
Uh,
I dunno if

536
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:13.870
Trayvon third guild,
I don't know what his fucking name is.
Dale three.
Um,

537
00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.420
he looked fucking great,
you know,
great.

538
00:32:16.421 --> 00:32:17.980
But he looked way better than when we were playing him.

539
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.510
When he was throwing like 90 miles over.

540
00:32:19.511 --> 00:32:21.700
Everybody's head looked like he settled down and everything.

541
00:32:21.701 --> 00:32:25.450
So I got to watch the bills lose and then I watched the packers.

542
00:32:25.451 --> 00:32:30.451
I'm actually play a surprisingly tough game against the 40 niners.

543
00:32:30.491 --> 00:32:31.690
I thought that they were going to crush them,

544
00:32:31.691 --> 00:32:35.520
but as much as the score looked like it was a,

545
00:32:35.521 --> 00:32:39.310
a one sided affair lists and meek using all the sports cliches.
Um,

546
00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:43.900
I thought 49 is played really tough.
And uh,

547
00:32:43.901 --> 00:32:45.860
and then I watched the fucking saints game,

548
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:49.400
a cowboys game and I had that game fucking recording.
What a God damn game.

549
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.350
Why should all the way to the end and the one time I don't add the extension

550
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:59.120
right as they're lining up to take the field goal to tie it up.

551
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:03.470
Um,
my fucking,
uh,
my,
my recorder cut out.

552
00:33:03.471 --> 00:33:06.740
So then I had to go on TV and I was just sitting there,
right?
It's a 30 yard.

553
00:33:06.741 --> 00:33:09.740
Even though they hit the fucking thing and it turns out they missed it and

554
00:33:09.741 --> 00:33:12.740
evidently they missed it.
Cause some guy with a giant white belly,

555
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:18.360
what I look like a few months ago,
lifted his shirt up and fucking distracted it.

556
00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:21.560
Uh,
let's see.
It's still ended up winning the fucking game.
But um,

557
00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.030
I don't know.
You ain't just realize,
I don't know anybody's name.

558
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.100
I could sit there and I can watch the whole fucking game.

559
00:33:28.101 --> 00:33:31.070
I don't know anybody's game.
Who's the cowboys back up?

560
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.340
He's one of those unfortunate guys who's a quarterback,
you know,

561
00:33:34.341 --> 00:33:37.190
who does not look good?
When are you wearing it?
When he was wearing a helmet,

562
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.180
he's got those baby fat cheeks,
you know,
so it all moshes in together.

563
00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.670
It looks like Stan Humphreys.
You know what I mean?

564
00:33:43.671 --> 00:33:45.380
That's just so unfortunate because you know,

565
00:33:45.381 --> 00:33:48.620
if you're going to stand back there and have six foot,
four,
six foot,

566
00:33:48.621 --> 00:33:51.740
five inch guys who run full 40 is coming into fucking layout,

567
00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:54.620
you can at least be getting a ridiculous amount of ass.
Right.

568
00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.730
You know what I mean?
You could have,
you know,

569
00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:02.540
you could have a cute little face like a old Tony Romo there.
You know,

570
00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:06.050
as he's sitting there wearing the Tom Landry hat,
he's got his arm in a sling.

571
00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:10.330
That's all women give a shit about Dallas.
Oh,
I just want to rub his shoulder.

572
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:16.730
What did hey break.
Um,
well there his collar collarbone,

573
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:22.220
white gold.
Um,
anyways,

574
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.890
whatever that guy's name is.
I thought when the saints went ahead head it,

575
00:34:24.891 --> 00:34:27.440
I was like,
God,
they don't have it in him.
This guy's a game manager.

576
00:34:27.441 --> 00:34:29.660
They don't have it in them to come back and score.
And Lo and behold,

577
00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:31.400
they went right down the fucking field and they scored.

578
00:34:31.401 --> 00:34:34.680
And it was great to see Tony Romo really being happy for his backup bite.

579
00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:37.430
He knows,
he knows.
He still has the job.
He knows he's better.

580
00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.990
He knows he looks better and a fucking helmet is going to sell more march.

581
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.273
Right.

582
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:48.530
I don't think I would look any worse in a football helmet and a closeup on HDTV

583
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:51.590
than that poor son of a bitch that's playing for the cowboys.
But God dammit,

584
00:34:51.591 --> 00:34:54.020
he got the job done,
drove them right down the fucking field,

585
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:59.120
right through to that tight end that's been there forever.
Jj Witten,
Jj stokes,

586
00:34:59.121 --> 00:35:01.250
whatever the fuck his name is.
I don't know anybody's name anymore.

587
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:05.150
I don't play fantasy football.
All right.
I'm a man.
I'm over 40.

588
00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:09.680
I'm actually thinking about starting to play fantasy football just so I can

589
00:35:09.681 --> 00:35:11.630
fucking learn the players names again.

590
00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:16.430
I actually am embarrassed to say that I went on the,
uh,

591
00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.190
on the Internet to see,
you know,

592
00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:24.140
look at some of the stats of like the top receivers and I didn't know anybody's

593
00:35:24.141 --> 00:35:28.300
name.
I didn't know anybody's name as far as running backs went.

594
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:33.830
I know Marshawn Lynch,
I know ray rice

595
00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.940
and I think it,
I don't know anybody else.

596
00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:45.350
I kept hearing names from the sec going,
didn't that guy play for Arkansas?

597
00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.710
Didn't that guy win the Heisman trophy?
Darren McFadden.

598
00:35:48.711 --> 00:35:52.910
Anyone the Heisman trophy in 2009,
I think he was on the saints.

599
00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:55.410
And then the fucking,
uh,

600
00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.810
the guy from Arkansas was on,
uh,
the cowboys.
I don't know.

601
00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:04.490
I don't know fucking anything anymore.
I don't know what happened to me.

602
00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:06.770
I don't what happened my fucking life,
man.
I used to know all of this,
you know,

603
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.230
I used to collect football cards.
That's what,
that's what it was.

604
00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:14.480
That's what it would.
Um,
anyways,
but it was a great whole fucking,
uh,

605
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:18.200
uh,
great,
uh,
weekend and watching football.
And then as always,

606
00:36:18.201 --> 00:36:23.201
I tell you what I do is I take a one o'clock game and I taped an extra one

607
00:36:24.711 --> 00:36:27.420
o'clock and an extra four o'clock game and I also still have the,

608
00:36:27.421 --> 00:36:31.040
the Notre Dame game to watch.
So tonight is Monday night football.

609
00:36:31.041 --> 00:36:34.430
I can watch that Tuesday night.
I can watch the one on one o'clock game.

610
00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:38.060
I don't give a fuck that.
I know what happens.
It's still fun to watch.
Wednesday,

611
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:40.460
Wednesday I go watch the four o'clock game.

612
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:45.800
Thursday you got Thursday football Friday or watched the noted game Dame game

613
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:49.670
and then Saturday it starts all over again.
There you go.

614
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:53.900
And if you want the woman in your life or the man in your life,

615
00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:57.650
whatever your deal is to feel underappreciated,

616
00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:00.140
you will record football games the way I do.

617
00:37:00.141 --> 00:37:01.880
Then you sit there the whole fucking week.

618
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:06.650
Watch like you some coach watching game tape.
I gotta.
I got to learn the names.

619
00:37:06.651 --> 00:37:10.970
Guys,
I apologize.
I apologize to anybody who had a great fucking game.

620
00:37:10.971 --> 00:37:14.270
I should at least know you.
God damn name right.
Drew Brees.
Drew Brees.

621
00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:16.910
I know Aaron Rodgers.

622
00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:21.140
I can't even remember the name of the fucking quarterback from Seattle.

623
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:23.340
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

624
00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:28.280
<v 0>or the quarterback.
What the fuck's it?
Richard Sherman.
Collin Kaepernick.</v>

625
00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.110
Who's the guy who's trying to be like the Walton's with 52 kids there for,

626
00:37:33.111 --> 00:37:37.370
for uh,
San Diego.
Philip Morris.

627
00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:41.970
I know him.
Andrew Luck,

628
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.280
I guess quarterbacks you know or I know.
I don't know.
Fuck.

629
00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:49.080
Why the fuck I know there's some guy in Atlanta who is unbelievable.

630
00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:54.910
Unbelievable receiver.
Oh,
Dell.
Becca,
my.
Now.
Bill,

631
00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:57.570
why don't you learn the fucking names instead of torture?
No,
it's all right.

632
00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:01.770
All right.
Sorry.
My mistake.
Oh,
hey,
listen,

633
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:06.300
I got to give a,
uh,
I gotta give a

634
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:12.420
shout out here to,
uh,
when I,
when I was in DC,

635
00:38:12.421 --> 00:38:14.970
now that I shit all over the w hotel,
which is a great hotel.

636
00:38:14.971 --> 00:38:17.130
If you're in your twenties,
okay?
And you got scripted titties,

637
00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:21.990
or you're a gay guy with the Hitler youth fucking haircut and a little show
pony.

638
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:23.300
You know what I mean?
You know,

639
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:28.300
you're some fucking a hottie with leather pants who's into rugby when you're

640
00:38:28.591 --> 00:38:33.060
drunk.
Um,
I gotta give a shout out here.
Uh,
one of the great things that I've,

641
00:38:33.061 --> 00:38:36.010
I found when I was in DC,
this is for everybody out

642
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.420
<v 1>there.
Anybody who plays professionally or,
uh,
just as like a drum nerd like me,</v>

643
00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.770
I found a great place for 15 bucks an hour that you can go play drums at a,

644
00:38:44.771 --> 00:38:48.720
it's called seven lessons drums in,
um,

645
00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.920
in Washington DC.
I showed up there,
um,

646
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:57.430
I played for two hours on Friday and two hours on Saturday.

647
00:38:57.431 --> 00:38:58.810
I could not have had a better time.

648
00:38:58.811 --> 00:39:02.740
I went to two different drum rooms to drums with top notch.
They were tuned up.

649
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:05.730
They sounded great.
And um,

650
00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:11.050
I mean that's to me,
if when I'm on the road,
you know,

651
00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:15.370
and uh,
that's one of the greatest days of my life.

652
00:39:15.371 --> 00:39:19.030
If I can be on the road and I can just for two hours during the day,
you know,

653
00:39:19.031 --> 00:39:23.080
to combat the fucking loneliness and all the bullshit that goes on when you're

654
00:39:23.081 --> 00:39:24.960
out there just sitting there,
you know,

655
00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:28.950
sitting there on a Thursday when there's nothing on TV,
do it.

656
00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:33.460
An Espn at two o'clock in the fucking afternoon is one of the funniest things

657
00:39:33.461 --> 00:39:34.450
you're ever going to watch.
Like,

658
00:39:34.451 --> 00:39:37.540
did you see that form a jet making fun of Tom Brady?
It was hilarious.

659
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.110
He gave it up.
He said he's arguably the greatest quarterback of all time,

660
00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:45.590
but he's a nerd.
What do you keep crying?
Kept saying corny.
You guys caught it.

661
00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:47.680
How many air of high fives is this guy get a miss?

662
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:50.290
Just trashing him of his who's fucking hilarious?

663
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.000
I would think of Tom Brady heard it.

664
00:39:52.001 --> 00:39:55.460
He would laugh and then they went back to skip Bayless and you would have

665
00:39:55.461 --> 00:40:00.190
thought somebody spit on the fucking,
uh,
world trade memorial.

666
00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:04.630
He's like,
his comments were despicable.

667
00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:10.830
I would guess that they're possibly born in jealousy.

668
00:40:11.081 --> 00:40:15.220
His people know I am a huge fan of Tom Brady.

669
00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.640
I don't,
I don't agree with those comments.
It's just like,
dude,

670
00:40:18.641 --> 00:40:22.360
are you fucking serious right now?
They want it.
Is,
is,
it's two in the afternoon.

671
00:40:22.361 --> 00:40:23.620
They've already shown you the highlights.

672
00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:27.880
Nothing new has happened and they just got to try and milk it for all its worth.

673
00:40:27.881 --> 00:40:32.380
So there's nothing worth to do.
Um,
people,
uh,
you know,

674
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.970
if you're a fan of this podcast,

675
00:40:33.971 --> 00:40:37.420
if you go to my website and you see the city set,
I'm going to be in.

676
00:40:37.421 --> 00:40:41.350
If you guys know cool studio places where I could just sit down and chill out

677
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:46.150
and fucking play drums for a couple hours,
uh,
by all means,
let me know.

678
00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:49.570
If you run one,
let me know.
I'll give it a shout out on the podcast.

679
00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.890
It is it,

680
00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.970
it's my favorite thing to do when I go on the road.

681
00:40:54.971 --> 00:40:57.640
If I can actually find a place like that.
And I found a great one.

682
00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.790
I know there's a lot of comics out there that play drums.
You know,

683
00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:02.370
you bring your iPhone and you plug it in.

684
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.380
You pretend you're fucking John Bonham for two hours.
How much fun is that?

685
00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:09.730
A seven lessons.
Drums in a Washington DC.

686
00:41:09.731 --> 00:41:14.080
If you guys know some other places,
give me the heads up because,
um,

687
00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.870
I gotta be honest with you.
It's frustrating,
you know,

688
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:21.290
to learn some shit and then go on the road for a week and you come back and you

689
00:41:21.291 --> 00:41:24.400
fucking,
you know,
one step forward,
two steps back.
It's a great fucking way.

690
00:41:24.401 --> 00:41:27.760
I feel like I got four hours better or at least maintained it.
So,
uh,

691
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:30.310
thank you to everybody over there.
Seven lessons trumps all right.

692
00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.140
Before I get into the questions,

693
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:36.290
unfortunately guys got to listen to me read out loud against here for a couple

694
00:41:36.291 --> 00:41:40.220
of a couple more.
Me undies.
We did that one.

695
00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:45.140
Okay.
All right.
Legal Zoom,
everybody.
You know what,

696
00:41:45.141 --> 00:41:49.220
you shouldn't have to choose a random lawyer who charges expensive hourly rates

697
00:41:49.221 --> 00:41:52.910
when you need legal help.
But the legal system is so complicated.

698
00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:56.540
What other choice do you have when you need help with your business or want to

699
00:41:56.541 --> 00:42:00.650
protect your family?
Well,
start with legal zoom.
They make it easy.

700
00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:04.430
They make a nice shade ego game for more than a decade.

701
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:08.240
They provided a way for regular people,
regular people like you and make,

702
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.770
you know what I mean?

730
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:53.840

but the last batch of DVDs that I have,

731
00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:57.890
I'm bringing those out on the road and they're all going to be autographed cause

732
00:43:57.891 --> 00:44:02.000
I'm getting them out of the garage cause I'm turning my garage into my little a

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:06.030
Ninja Warrior Gym.

tipper,
uh,
that is correct.

744

I got my atomic holds and,
um,

745
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:47.400
I got a buddy coming in who's going to do everything the right way because,
uh,

746
00:44:47.401 --> 00:44:50.550
even though I have a stud finder and I got a drill,

747
00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:55.760
I do not trust myself to put as a standup comic to put this thing up correctly

748
00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:01.290
and not,
uh,
do unbelievable damage to myself,
you know,
and I don't,

749
00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:04.710
we'll be hanging by all my bodyweight,
swinging from one hold to another,

750
00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:05.070
you know,

751
00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:10.070
my pasty legs are out in front of me and then that thing fucking gives way,

752
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:12.910
you know,
I'm at that fucking age for that.

753
00:45:12.911 --> 00:45:15.030
Then I'll have that pain for the rest of my fucking life.

754
00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:17.580
I'll finally know what it's like to be sacked in the NFL,

755
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:22.820
to fucking be horizontal four feet off the ground and land land on concrete

756
00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:26.040
right there.
Like,
that's what astroturf feels like.
All right,

757
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:30.600
let's get to the questions.
Um,
by the way,
if you want to,

758
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:35.190
uh,
you know what,
I don't even have the email.
What is the fucking email?

759
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:40.030
God dammit.
Bill at the MLM,
podcast.com.

760
00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:43.580
That's where you send all your emails too.
Um,

761
00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:47.820
and if you guys know what better way to fucking learn the players names nowadays

762
00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:49.810
other than playing that fantasy stuff,

763
00:45:49.811 --> 00:45:54.100
I guess I just have to keep going to the website.
Um,
all right.

764
00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.960
Boston.
Hey Bill,
me and my wife are headed to Boston for the first time.

765
00:45:58.961 --> 00:46:00.760
Any tips on the best places to eat?

766
00:46:00.761 --> 00:46:04.870
I hate when people do this to me because I moved away from there in 1995.

767
00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.240
So half the shit I'm going to tell you to go to,

768
00:46:07.241 --> 00:46:10.690
it's probably not even there anymore.
Uh,
how about things we shouldn't miss?

769
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:13.600
I'm going to Fenway for sure,
but after that we are clueless.

770
00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:15.160
Any help would be appreciated.

771
00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:20.320
Thanks and love the podcasts except for the disparaging remarks about

772
00:46:20.321 --> 00:46:24.930
Sacramento.
Have fucking ha,
come on dude.
You know,
Sacramento,

773
00:46:24.931 --> 00:46:28.210
Sacramento is a weird place.
You know what I mean?

774
00:46:28.211 --> 00:46:32.050
It's either totally shady or you feel like you're in a Donny Osmond fucking

775
00:46:32.051 --> 00:46:34.840
Christmas special.
That'd be honest with you.

776
00:46:34.841 --> 00:46:37.290
I don't know much about Sacramento to be totally honest with you,

777
00:46:37.291 --> 00:46:40.810
cause every time I stayed there,
I didn't have a car and I was working the,
uh,

778
00:46:40.811 --> 00:46:44.470
the punchline there and I stayed at the comedy condo across the street and then

779
00:46:44.471 --> 00:46:48.080
they had a dirty Mcdonald's that I would go to.
Um,

780
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:51.130
so that's what it's based on.
Other than the fact,

781
00:46:51.131 --> 00:46:56.131
one time I went to a Sacramento Kings game and I went to the downtown area and I

782
00:46:56.201 --> 00:47:01.201
felt like I was in Utah in the widest Mormon sense of the word.

783
00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.380
Um,
she doesn't mean it's bad.
I mean,
I'm white.

784
00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:08.140
I don't know when it's so white that I'm uncomfortable though.

785
00:47:08.141 --> 00:47:10.900
You know what I mean?
I Dunno.
I probably don't know shit.
I will tell you this,

786
00:47:10.901 --> 00:47:14.740
if I've been telling you that I've been watching the ultimate fighter with Conor

787
00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.950
Mcgregor,
Conor Mcgregor,
and uh,
and um,

788
00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:23.630
ah,
fuck,
what an asshole.

789
00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.270
I was just going to give him props.
A how fucking funny he's bent.

790
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:32.910
<v 0>Uriah Jesus Christ.
I got to stop talking on cell phones.
Do that guy.</v>

791
00:47:32.911 --> 00:47:36.030
He's been fucking,
I knew Conor McGregor was going to be funny.

792
00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:38.730
That's why I was tuning in to watch.
But who knew how,

793
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:42.920
how fucking funny Uriah was having,
I already talked about this.
Well,

794
00:47:42.921 --> 00:47:45.930
Mcgregor was talking shit to him about what the fuck he would do to him and then

795
00:47:45.931 --> 00:47:50.580
he just looks at him.
He goes,
he goes,
Connor,
to do I strike you as a fearful man.

796
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:56.880
And he keeps making fun of Connor's big fucking head,

797
00:47:56.881 --> 00:47:58.620
which I don't even think he has a big head,

798
00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:03.660
but I think it's starting to fuck with the,
um,
anyways,

799
00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.960
it's funny man.
You know what's a great God damn show?

800
00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:09.120
And it's fun watching two guys to talk and Shit,

801
00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:11.400
knowing that neither one of them is full of Shit,

802
00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:14.670
knowing that both of them know how to fight.
You know what I mean?

803
00:48:14.671 --> 00:48:17.310
So many times when you sit there,
you watch your guys talking,
Shit,

804
00:48:17.311 --> 00:48:20.100
I'll fucking do this.
I'll do this.
Yeah,
you don't want to fuck with me.

805
00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:23.250
It's usually people bluffing like me,
you know what I mean?

806
00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:27.210
Oh my good friend Joe to Rosa.
I had never seen a guy who knew how to fight less,

807
00:48:27.211 --> 00:48:28.440
talk more shit and bars,

808
00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:33.150
but he just did it with supreme confidence as he was backing up and the person

809
00:48:33.151 --> 00:48:36.540
would never take in that information.
He'd always kind of psych them out.

810
00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.320
Joe's got this way of scrunching up his fucking eyebrows and making this face,

811
00:48:40.321 --> 00:48:43.860
even though he,
he,
he's got glasses on,
you know,

812
00:48:43.861 --> 00:48:46.260
and he looks like he works at a library is you can think,

813
00:48:46.261 --> 00:48:49.750
well maybe this guy knows some shit.
Maybe this guy's fucking crazy.
So anyway,

814
00:48:49.751 --> 00:48:53.560
so it's great to watch them talking shit.
Um,

815
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:58.970
just professional fighters anyways.
It's not even like they're not talking shit.

816
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.910
They're not talking shit.
They can do everything that they're saying.
Um,

817
00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:08.500
anyways,
sweetener.
That was the next day.
UFC think I got,
I'm,
I'm a,

818
00:49:08.501 --> 00:49:12.080
I'm Jonesing for one.
I think I missed the last one cause I was on the road.
So,

819
00:49:12.081 --> 00:49:15.680
uh,
all right,
whenever I'm babbling here,
let's get to the questions.
All right.

820
00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:19.460
This guy's asking me what's a good thing to do here in Boston?
Uh,

821
00:49:19.461 --> 00:49:20.221
well it's the ice.

822
00:49:20.221 --> 00:49:23.540
A lot to go into Dominic's to get a slice of pizza at that does not exist

823
00:49:23.541 --> 00:49:28.520
anymore.
Um,
you know what's there now?
A W hotel.

824
00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:34.160
I was tell you what it si scripted.
Teddy's go to a,

825
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:39.190
the w hotel raw right there on fucking warranted street on the corner warrants

826
00:49:39.481 --> 00:49:42.530
history used to be a parking lot.
Do I even know anything anymore?

827
00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:48.240
Combat Zone is all fucking hotels.

828
00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:53.600
I just know touristy shit.
Oh my God,

829
00:49:53.601 --> 00:49:58.540
this is terrible.
The swan boats,

830
00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:01.060
I don't know anything about my city anymore.

831
00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:02.740
<v 2>Okay.</v>

832
00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:04.030
<v 0>I know that if you go to Fenway,</v>

833
00:50:04.031 --> 00:50:07.210
they bought up like the surrounding block and he can't go down there.

834
00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:11.050
Do you know what sir?
You've stumped me.

835
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:16.030
I say go to Harvard Square and go to the tasty.
Get yourself a burger.

836
00:50:16.031 --> 00:50:17.590
That doesn't exist anymore.

837
00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:19.270
<v 2>Okay?</v>

838
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:22.780
<v 0>Oh my God.
This is,
see,
this is what's so fucking sad,
man.
This is what said,</v>

839
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:25.690
this is why they say you can never go home again because you move away and you

840
00:50:25.691 --> 00:50:26.500
come back.

841
00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:31.070
Everybody moved away or fucking died and everything closed up and is now a

842
00:50:31.071 --> 00:50:35.810
fucking Arby's.
Um,
you know what,

843
00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:40.750
sorry,
you stumped me.
I have no fucking idea.
I have no idea.

844
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:44.900
Definitely taken a sporting event.
Um,
fortunately with the Internet,

845
00:50:44.901 --> 00:50:47.900
I'm sure you can get some ideas and hey dude,
if you learn anything,

846
00:50:47.901 --> 00:50:50.750
if you go to someplace cool,
why don't you,
why don't you let me know.

847
00:50:50.751 --> 00:50:54.760
Pays a touristy place she can go to is the uh,
the,

848
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.770
the Union Oyster House.
That's like,
you know,

849
00:50:56.771 --> 00:51:00.590
like fucking Paul revere went in there and had a fucking Sam Adams back in the

850
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:01.280
day.

851
00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.250
And by that I mean he had a gay relationship with them cause the beer did not

852
00:51:04.251 --> 00:51:06.470
exist.
Um,
that's a real touristy spot.

853
00:51:06.471 --> 00:51:09.410
I'm sure that's not everybody's rolling their eyes right now.
Like,
oh look,

854
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:13.550
good dude.
Don't fucking Sandham ne um,

855
00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:18.290
tell you what,
I'll retweet places if people know some good places.
Um,

856
00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:23.150
other than that,
I just know go to the cow loon.
That's why he used to stand up.

857
00:51:23.151 --> 00:51:26.120
They got some good Chinese food.
I got nothing.

858
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:28.520
I'll go to the new England aquarium.

859
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:33.260
Go look at the sad fish that want to be back in the ocean.
Oh,

860
00:51:33.261 --> 00:51:36.140
I know the north end.
Go to the fucking north end.

861
00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.750
Go write down what does that Hanover Street,

862
00:51:38.751 --> 00:51:40.610
I don't remember the name of the street.
Begins with an h.

863
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:44.900
Go down that fucking street and uh,
you know,

864
00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:49.460
find somebody,
looks really Italian from the old neighborhood and be like,
listen,

865
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:51.410
I don't want to eat on this street.
What's one,

866
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:54.380
a couple of blocks over that you go to?
I swear to God,

867
00:51:54.381 --> 00:51:57.320
I won't tell anybody and it'll be the best fucking Italian that you can get in

868
00:51:57.321 --> 00:52:02.210
the,
in Boston at least.
I think so.
Oh God.
That said,

869
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:05.780
that really made me feel fucking old.
Oh,
here's another is another one.

870
00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:09.830
A black mass.
Hey Billy Bulger.
Nice.
Nice fucking call back.

871
00:52:09.831 --> 00:52:13.460
They're not called BEC.
Nice reference there.
Billy Bulger,
he was the politician.

872
00:52:13.461 --> 00:52:17.420
Did you see black mass?
He said,
I'm usually a pretty easy critic,

873
00:52:17.421 --> 00:52:19.640
but it was pretty rough.
Nothing really happens.

874
00:52:19.641 --> 00:52:23.960
And what does happen has been refuted by everyone who knows the story.
Well,

875
00:52:23.961 --> 00:52:25.790
you can say that about every fucking movie.

876
00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:29.690
I don't mean things like getting the color of his shirt right,

877
00:52:29.691 --> 00:52:33.830
but major events and motives,
really disappointing.
While you know,

878
00:52:33.831 --> 00:52:36.860
you can kind of say that about a Goodfellas,

879
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.130
the way you know [inaudible] were talking about that,

880
00:52:40.131 --> 00:52:42.530
how they made Henry Hill look like Ray Liotta.

881
00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:46.190
He says great looking movie star and then when you see him,

882
00:52:46.191 --> 00:52:51.140
he was a little fucking worm.
Um,
so,
you know,

883
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:54.670
it is a movie.
I haven't seen it.
Um,
um,

884
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:58.460
I know some people liked it,
some people didn't,

885
00:52:58.461 --> 00:53:01.280
but that I'm still gonna go see.
Cause I love Johnny Depp.

886
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:05.080
And also I remember when no country for old men came out and everybody's like,

887
00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:09.860
Google the movie soaked.
And it ended up being like my favorite one ever.

888
00:53:09.861 --> 00:53:12.780
So I did not see it.
And um,

889
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:17.060
I don't go to see movies to get a history lesson and I don't think he should.

890
00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:21.620
I think you go there to be entertained.
Um,
I dunno.

891
00:53:21.621 --> 00:53:25.250
It looks fucking great to me,
so I'm definitely gonna go it.

892
00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:26.090
I think that's one of those

893
00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:28.910
<v 1>ones that everybody thought it was going to be a big shoot 'em up kind of thing.</v>

894
00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:31.220
And they did it in a little bit of a different way.
So they're like,

895
00:53:31.221 --> 00:53:34.190
what the fuck?
And I'm calling it right now when it fucking goes on Netflix,

896
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:39.080
everyone be like,
you know what?
I actually liked it first.
He liked it,
you know,

897
00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:43.370
so,
um,
I can't tell you this.

898
00:53:43.371 --> 00:53:47.330
So that is a scary guy do that you did not want to fuck with.

899
00:53:47.331 --> 00:53:51.320
That's all I knew when I was living in Massachusetts and fortunately I lived out

900
00:53:51.321 --> 00:53:53.960
the safe suburbs and played street hockey in a cul de sac,

901
00:53:53.961 --> 00:53:56.420
so I didn't have any sort of Southie,

902
00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:00.620
goodwill hunting upbringing whatsoever.
Uh,
you know,

903
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:04.910
we just drove around and shit cars with the case of beer on the weekends,

904
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:08.660
drove around trying to find out the kids drive around and fucking with cases of

905
00:54:08.661 --> 00:54:12.470
beer,
you know,
that's,
that's what you did.
That was the excitement in my town.

906
00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:17.300
Um,
they need to know what we knew enough to stay away from heroin.

907
00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.440
It's fucking killing me now.

908
00:54:18.441 --> 00:54:21.200
Seeing all these kids on heroin after they get it on a painkillers,

909
00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:23.130
it's unfucking believable,
man.

910
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:29.230
Unfucking believable that that has made a comeback and they get EEG.

911
00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:31.730
You don't make a comeback from that fucking drug,
dude.

912
00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:35.570
That's one of those drugs that,
and even when you get clean,
you know what I mean?

913
00:54:35.571 --> 00:54:38.270
Every day you do,
you still want to fucking do it again.
I mean,

914
00:54:38.271 --> 00:54:42.950
that's what a thing to do to yourself.
I don't think that that's worth it.

915
00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:46.760
You know,
to put it to the biggest understatement ever.

916
00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:50.330
Major fucking problem.
Enough to major.
It's a fucking problem.

917
00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:53.870
Massachusetts problem in Vermont,
Maine,
all these places I'm going to,

918
00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:57.320
they will like to kind of places you used to go to,
to get away from that shit.

919
00:54:58.250 --> 00:55:03.170
Um,
it's out in the suburbs,
man.
It's a fucking epidemic.
Anyways.
All right,

920
00:55:03.171 --> 00:55:08.030
wife thinks I'm nuts.
Hey Billy Davinci.
My wife thinks I'm losing my mind.

921
00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:10.100
Well,
join the club a couple of weeks back.

922
00:55:10.101 --> 00:55:15.101
I told her that I at the ripe age of 49 one to learn how to paint too.

923
00:55:15.421 --> 00:55:16.790
That's fucking great.

924
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:18.510
<v 2>Okay,</v>

925
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:20.280
<v 1>that's fucking,
dude,
this is the thing,
man.</v>

926
00:55:20.281 --> 00:55:25.281
If you want to stay excited in life and if you want to send off depression,

927
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:30.720
like this is a really depressing week for me,
man.
My uncle passed away and uh,

928
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:34.140
he's just the greatest guy ever.
And um,

929
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:38.160
cause that thing that,
you know,
no one,
I'm never going to see him again.

930
00:55:38.161 --> 00:55:39.930
And then that other thing as far as like,

931
00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:45.000
like that level of my relatives,
one of them passed away.

932
00:55:45.001 --> 00:55:48.060
Like he's the first one and like,
um,

933
00:55:48.061 --> 00:55:52.470
the next wave and you just start doing the math in your head and I'll quit the

934
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:53.790
last decade went by and it's like,
oh my God,

935
00:55:53.791 --> 00:55:57.090
I'm going to fucking be that guy in like two months.

936
00:55:57.091 --> 00:55:59.460
You feel so what's,

937
00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:04.860
he can't stop the clock from ticking,
but you know,

938
00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:09.810
nobody can stop you from enjoying yourself or having a good time and unless she

939
00:56:09.811 --> 00:56:14.250
let them.
So,
um,
you know,

940
00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:17.730
I think that's how I ended up,
you know,
I just,

941
00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:19.411
I dunno,

942
00:56:19.411 --> 00:56:24.160
I am a big fucking believer in learning how to do

943
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:28.450
<v 0>shit and that whole a jack of all trades,
master of none.
Go Fuck Yourself.</v>

944
00:56:28.451 --> 00:56:31.990
I do stand up.
All right.
I do that thing.

945
00:56:31.991 --> 00:56:34.870
I'm never going to master it because the second I think that I've mastered it,

946
00:56:34.871 --> 00:56:37.840
I'm going to stop growing.
And then the depression comes back.

947
00:56:37.841 --> 00:56:42.841
Like for me when I'm standing still and I got time to think and contemplate,

948
00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:48.010
like however I'm wired,
it just,
it puts me in a fucking funk.

949
00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:53.230
So I'm always chasing that next fucking carrot thing.

950
00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:57.900
Like I'm learning how to smoke meat.
You know,
I was going to try to,
uh,

951
00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:02.560
smoke some ribs this week,
but I got to go to the funeral.
I'm hoping,
you know,

952
00:57:02.561 --> 00:57:05.710
I can maybe give that a shot this weekend.
But,
um,

953
00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:11.590
you know,
playing drums,
I learned how to fly a helicopter.
Um,

954
00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:16.750
I got into old cars and stuff and you know,
and I have like,
you know,

955
00:57:16.751 --> 00:57:20.650
I don't have a tremendous amount of knowledge in any of that shit,
but our,

956
00:57:20.651 --> 00:57:23.390
rather than obviously I got my pilot's license,
I had to know what the fuck goes.

957
00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:27.280
Hey,
I kinda know how to do this.
Um,
I'll do it all.
By the way,

958
00:57:27.281 --> 00:57:31.550
I'm doing a flight this week where,
uh,
I'm going to landed,
uh,

959
00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:36.640
Elmonte.
Um,
and then I'm going to do a lap around the rose bowl,

960
00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:40.000
which is so fucking cool.
I'm starting to like,

961
00:57:40.001 --> 00:57:43.390
my big thing right now before I get instrument trained is I really want to get

962
00:57:43.391 --> 00:57:47.530
comfortable on the radio and uh,
um,
into,
um,
you know,

963
00:57:47.531 --> 00:57:49.750
I already did the advanced autorotation class,

964
00:57:49.751 --> 00:57:53.590
so I know I can get that thing to the ground at the fucking engine,
cuts out a,

965
00:57:53.591 --> 00:57:54.820
which was the big thing for me.

966
00:57:54.821 --> 00:57:57.580
So now I'm past that fear that I know if something bad happens,

967
00:57:57.581 --> 00:58:00.220
I know I can get to the ground and I have fucking confidence in that.

968
00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:04.540
So now my next little hurdle is I got to geek kid comfortable on the radio,

969
00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:05.740
you know,

970
00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:10.360
and know what to say and just get better at listening and looking for traffic

971
00:58:10.361 --> 00:58:13.660
and all that type of shit.
And the only way to do it is to go fucking do it.
So

972
00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:18.700
getting back to what you're talking about is you want to learn how to paint at

973
00:58:18.701 --> 00:58:23.680
the ripe age of 49 like I just love even the way you're writing that,
I mean,

974
00:58:23.681 --> 00:58:26.140
I don't want to put words into your mouth,
but the,

975
00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:31.150
the tone underneath that is that you shouldn't be trying new things or learning

976
00:58:31.151 --> 00:58:33.910
new things at 49 you should be set in your ways.

977
00:58:33.911 --> 00:58:37.240
You should have your fucking routine.
And for some people that is comforting.

978
00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:40.270
But uh,
to fuck that,
if you want to learn how to paint,

979
00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:45.270
I don't give a fuck if you're 89 the keep your mind active as supposed to sit in

980
00:58:45.271 --> 00:58:49.150
their rotten in between your ears.
So anyways,
he said,
you know,

981
00:58:49.151 --> 00:58:52.840
I'm ripe old age of 49 and then I let her know that I want wanting to paint.

982
00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:57.840
She immediately changed the subject to shed a that Oh,

983
00:59:00.731 --> 00:59:04.480
she immediately change the subject to to the shed.
Okay.

984
00:59:04.481 --> 00:59:05.980
That needs cleaning out.

985
00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:09.940
I explained to her that one has nothing to do with the other.

986
00:59:09.941 --> 00:59:13.810
I can clean the shed and learn how to play paint.
I'm self employed.

987
00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:18.700
I brought it up again and she rolled her eyes.
I love my wife,

988
00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.380
but this has me wondering,
uh,

989
00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:25.660
what are the things that she shot down in the past that maybe I just accepted a,

990
00:59:25.661 --> 00:59:28.750
you talk about,
you talked about that in your last specialists.
Especially,

991
00:59:28.751 --> 00:59:31.390
what's my move here?
I don't want to pass over this.

992
00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:35.170
I'd rather address it and fix it.
Uh,
what's your next move?

993
00:59:35.171 --> 00:59:39.340
I had to go down to the art supply store and get yourself a fucking easel and

994
00:59:39.341 --> 00:59:44.210
some paints and I would learn how to paint.
This is okay.

995
00:59:44.211 --> 00:59:47.630
This is the deal,
dude.
She has no fucking argument here.

996
00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:53.030
This is like literally you want to learn to do something that's going to make

997
00:59:53.031 --> 00:59:57.860
your life more enjoyable.
Um,
and that's what I would say.
I would just say,

998
00:59:57.861 --> 01:00:01.910
listen,
I want to learn something that's going to uh,

999
01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:06.970
make my life more enjoyable and fill me with happiness and it doesn't involve me

1000
01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.980
a fucking another woman.

1001
01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:13.490
So what exactly is she a problem?

1002
01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.120
Lay Right.
What is your problem?

1003
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:22.190
If you want to address it,
like,
dude,
you're going to destroy in this.

1004
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:26.570
Just sit down and just say,
listen,
I need to talk to you about something.

1005
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:28.310
All right.
All right.

1006
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.770
And immediately she's going to be off guard cause she didn't cause you know,

1007
01:00:30.771 --> 01:00:34.670
there's going to be a talk and you've had a time to fucking get your ideas in

1008
01:00:34.671 --> 01:00:37.000
order to just say,
listen.
Um,

1009
01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:41.540
the other day when I mentioned to you that I wanted to learn how to paint,

1010
01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:44.810
you immediately said that the shed needed to be cleaned out.

1011
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:47.270
When I told you that I had enough time to do both,

1012
01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:51.380
you rolled your eyes at me and uh,
don't say it the way I just said,

1013
01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:54.140
you rolled your eyes.
See,
I get the anger.
You,
Gabby,
you rolled your eyes,

1014
01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:55.851
you go back,

1015
01:00:55.851 --> 01:00:58.490
you bring your head back so you're not getting in a grill so she can actually

1016
01:00:58.491 --> 01:01:00.350
hear you and she won't be on the defensive.

1017
01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:03.950
Just feels like you rolled your eyes at me and um,

1018
01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.930
that hurt my feelings because if there was something that you ever wanted to do

1019
01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:13.190
that was going to make you happy,
I would never

1020
01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:17.770
come at you in a negative way.
I would encourage you to do it.

1021
01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.620
So I was just wondering what was behind that

1022
01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:26.920
and uh,
you know,
just let her talk and talk your way through and just say,
listen,

1023
01:01:26.921 --> 01:01:29.260
like for the rest of my life,

1024
01:01:29.261 --> 01:01:33.280
I'm going to be trying new things because it makes my life enjoyable and it

1025
01:01:33.281 --> 01:01:37.510
would crush me that the woman that I love,
which somehow get in the way of that.

1026
01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.140
All right,
the shed is going to be cleaned out and I'm learning how to paint.

1027
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.650
All right?
And I don't want to paint a picture of you being a con to me,

1028
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:47.590
so why don't you lighten up their sugar tits.
See right there.

1029
01:01:47.591 --> 01:01:49.510
See what happens always in the end.
I get mean.

1030
01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.320
That's why I couldn't talk to that guy in the fucking a cigar bar.
Um,
all right.

1031
01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:00.040
All right.
Okay.
Bill,
aren't you paranoid?
Hey Billy B a,

1032
01:02:00.041 --> 01:02:04.050
aren't you a bit paranoid with all this tracking and surveillance?
Uh,

1033
01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.150
I think he's talking about the microchipping and all that shit.
He said,

1034
01:02:07.151 --> 01:02:12.151
I noticed that this is a typical American psyche of Jesus Christ here in Europe.

1035
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.990
We are a bit,
well,
a lot more relaxed about those things.
Um,

1036
01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:20.020
I don't

1037
01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:23.180
<v 2>know if people are doing this just to try to get me all fucking fucked up,</v>

1038
01:02:23.181 --> 01:02:26.630
but I noticed that about people from other countries like they are so fucking

1039
01:02:26.631 --> 01:02:29.510
arrogant with like,
they think they know all the American psyche.

1040
01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:32.360
Like what do you know about the American psyche?
You don't fucking live here.

1041
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:34.730
What the shit you watching the BBC,

1042
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:40.010
you fucking dope over in America,
we're a little more relaxed.

1043
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:44.690
Really based on what?
Based on what.

1044
01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.710
Isn't that where the last two world wars started?
Oh,

1045
01:02:48.711 --> 01:02:53.360
what are you go way back to then look at how can one would fucking Russia pulled

1046
01:02:53.361 --> 01:02:57.860
out all those kinds of Bosnian Serbs,
Russia,
they get,
you're not more relaxed.

1047
01:02:58.490 --> 01:02:58.790
Okay.

1048
01:02:58.790 --> 01:03:02.550
<v 0>You're not any more fucking relaxed fucking maniac.</v>

1049
01:03:02.551 --> 01:03:05.540
She can't even go to a football game without beating the shit out of each other.

1050
01:03:05.541 --> 01:03:09.650
Getting all fucking hammered.
You're not more relaxed.
All right.

1051
01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:12.290
I don't see that at all.

1052
01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:16.400
I'm not saying we're better than you or what,
like you know,

1053
01:03:16.401 --> 01:03:18.560
and also you're not a bit more paranoid.

1054
01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:22.190
I love how Scotland Shutdown Monsanto when they wanted to have their fucking

1055
01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.490
genetically altered food coming to their country and they're like,

1056
01:03:25.491 --> 01:03:29.060
you're not fucking doing that.
I don't think you're more relaxed.

1057
01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:31.490
I don't think Greece looks at fucking relaxed right now.

1058
01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:35.420
Is they got in bed with the evil fucking bankers are now.

1059
01:03:35.421 --> 01:03:36.980
I don't know what the fuck happened over there.

1060
01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:39.710
Their whole fucking economy collapsed.

1061
01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:43.820
I don't see many relaxed things over there.
Yeah.
Nice and relaxed.

1062
01:03:43.821 --> 01:03:47.240
You draw cartoon and then somebody comes in and sprays the place with bullets.

1063
01:03:47.241 --> 01:03:49.550
I add so fucking chill.
God,

1064
01:03:49.551 --> 01:03:52.370
it's so refined in relaxed over there.

1065
01:03:53.810 --> 01:03:55.160
Fucking neo Nazis.

1066
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:59.090
Can you go to a fucking football game without being reminded a Hitler?

1067
01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:02.420
Jesus fucking Christ.

1068
01:04:02.421 --> 01:04:05.150
What could you got a king and queen riding around in a carriage.

1069
01:04:05.151 --> 01:04:09.650
You think it's all fucking chill.
Um,
anyways.

1070
01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.070
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1071
01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:15.030
<v 0>My question here is why I see that you will reject anything that makes your life</v>

1072
01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:19.610
easier and more convenient.
Um,
well that all depends on how you,
uh,

1073
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:23.490
define convenient,
which you spelled incorrectly.
He goes,

1074
01:04:23.491 --> 01:04:27.990
but it's collecting any data,
whether it's purchasing habits,
location and such.

1075
01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:32.400
I prefer to see personalized ads rather than random ads for moms.

1076
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:37.430
If I buy something all the time in a market,
why not create clubcard?

1077
01:04:37.890 --> 01:04:40.530
You will pay less.
Oh my God.
What a dope.

1078
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.970
It doesn't matter that you will receive an email every once in a while,

1079
01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:49.740
which will land in spam anyways.
Dude,
you're not paying less.

1080
01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:51.810
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1081
01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:53.760
<v 0>Do you want to say it?
You're not paying less.</v>

1082
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.980
Do you know anything about corporations?

1083
01:04:57.090 --> 01:04:57.590
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1084
01:04:57.590 --> 01:04:59.480
<v 0>they're never going to make less money.</v>

1085
01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:04.670
They're going to create this whole thing like,
Hey,
join the club man and look,

1086
01:05:04.671 --> 01:05:08.120
you'll get 40% off this shit that we can't fucking sell.

1087
01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:11.450
That's what they give you a discount on.

1088
01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.940
And then if they actually got some PR,

1089
01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:16.370
whatever their prime rib is that they're selling you,

1090
01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:21.450
all they do is Jack up the price.
Go,
hey,
it used to be this and now it's this.

1091
01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:21.970
So you,

1092
01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:26.970
you give the them the perception that you're getting a lower price and I don't

1093
01:05:28.021 --> 01:05:31.650
have,
I'm not paranoid dude.
I am informed,
believe it or not,

1094
01:05:31.651 --> 01:05:34.590
and I always call myself a fucking dope.
All right?

1095
01:05:34.591 --> 01:05:38.910
Cause I know that I am and I don't think that I know everything,
but,
um,

1096
01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:43.230
I do understand how corporations operate.
Okay.

1097
01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:47.670
And they literally sit there and they go dead babies or more money for us.

1098
01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:49.920
And they actually debate going like,
well,

1099
01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:55.040
how much will the parents suing us for their dead babies costs us to settle out

1100
01:05:55.411 --> 01:05:58.110
of court versus how much money you know,

1101
01:05:59.010 --> 01:06:03.600
to have these led and fuse fucking pacifiers.
And if the pacifiers,
I mean,

1102
01:06:03.601 --> 01:06:05.100
using this obviously is a fuck.

1103
01:06:05.130 --> 01:06:07.680
I know you're rolling your eyes because you fucking think you know everything,

1104
01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:10.400
which is certainly do as just shitting on my country.

1105
01:06:10.401 --> 01:06:13.260
A country you don't even fucking live in.
Um,

1106
01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:20.170
they will choose the fucking,
the product.
Auto companies did that.

1107
01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:21.500
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1108
01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:25.400
<v 0>You know,
whether they knew like fucking police,
like to what the Crown Victoria,</v>

1109
01:06:25.401 --> 01:06:28.700
when they knew cops were getting rear-ended when they are on the road and we're

1110
01:06:28.701 --> 01:06:29.660
burning to death,

1111
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:34.220
they fucking squelched all of that fucking information and they took the fucking

1112
01:06:34.221 --> 01:06:37.790
lawsuit.
All right?
They're not on your side.

1113
01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:39.830
They're not trying to make your life any easier.

1114
01:06:39.831 --> 01:06:42.050
What they're trying to do is they're gay.
They're,
they're,

1115
01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.960
they're invading your fucking privacy.
Like,
look,
dude,

1116
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:47.690
I don't have a problem that you don't have a problem with somebody invading your

1117
01:06:47.691 --> 01:06:51.500
privacy.
Okay.
But she should have to give consent to that.

1118
01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:56.120
And what I don't like is I have not given my consent.
Okay.

1119
01:06:56.121 --> 01:07:00.380
I didn't give my consent for you to put my fucking bank account information

1120
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:03.560
online.
They just fucking did it.

1121
01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:06.200
I don't want to bank online and they just put it up there anyways.

1122
01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:09.620
Then I had to go down to the fucking bank and go through this whole fucking maze

1123
01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:13.610
and they were very hostile before they would let me take my own banking

1124
01:07:13.611 --> 01:07:18.080
information off of the fucking Internet that they exposed my entire fucking

1125
01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:22.550
adult life of working to getting hacked into.

1126
01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:26.330
They exposed all of that.
They made the choice and not me.

1127
01:07:26.331 --> 01:07:30.410
I think that that's fucked up.
And if you think like when you go through history,

1128
01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:34.700
how human beings have handled any level of power,

1129
01:07:34.701 --> 01:07:37.820
I'm talking about the average person just getting their own fucking Sitcom.

1130
01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:41.300
What that does to their fucking psyche.
Okay.

1131
01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:44.390
When you're trying to take over shit,

1132
01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:48.740
the thought of rebellion and all that is always in the back of your head.

1133
01:07:48.741 --> 01:07:51.920
If you fucking microchip everybody and you know where everybody is,

1134
01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:53.170
you could fucking just an,

1135
01:07:53.171 --> 01:07:57.560
and you put all the money is then on the microchip and all your shit is just on

1136
01:07:57.561 --> 01:07:57.741
that.

1137
01:07:57.741 --> 01:08:01.070
All you gotta do is just shut somebody chip off and you've killed any sort of

1138
01:08:01.071 --> 01:08:05.390
rebuttal to anything that you're doing.
That's it.
And the future,

1139
01:08:05.391 --> 01:08:07.870
when you go to a protest,
they'll just fucking,
they'll just have,

1140
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:09.320
they'll have some sort of satellite,

1141
01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:13.490
everybody's chip number will show up and they'll just be shut it off and they'll

1142
01:08:13.491 --> 01:08:17.120
starve you for fucking 10 days.
So you'll learn the fucking lesson.

1143
01:08:17.121 --> 01:08:19.160
They won't kill you.
Cause if they kill you,
that'll,

1144
01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.020
that'll cause more people to get upset.

1145
01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.020
But just sort of kick it back and the people like,
yeah,
you know what?

1146
01:08:24.170 --> 01:08:27.950
I'd love to go to a fucking protest.
You know?
Right now it's like,

1147
01:08:27.951 --> 01:08:30.650
I'd love to go to a protest,
but the cops are gonna beat the Shit on me,

1148
01:08:30.651 --> 01:08:32.420
which is so fucking ridiculous.

1149
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.980
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1150
01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:36.110
<v 0>you can't go to a protest.
There is no protest.</v>

1151
01:08:36.111 --> 01:08:38.270
So you go to a protest and the cops beat the shit out of you.

1152
01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:41.150
That's basically what happens.
And then they always try to act like,
oh,

1153
01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:43.460
well these guys got out of line.
Give me a fucking break.

1154
01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:46.580
They'd been doing that since the fucking beginning.
Um,

1155
01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:48.170
so I don't think I'm paranoid,
sir.

1156
01:08:48.171 --> 01:08:51.350
If you want all of your fucking information and all that out there to make your

1157
01:08:51.351 --> 01:08:55.250
life more convenient and you don't have to think,
you have to think less.

1158
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.990
Like I don't,
I don't think that's good.

1159
01:08:58.010 --> 01:09:01.760
I don't think that happened like that fucking app on my phone.

1160
01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:05.270
This is my own personal thing and I'm not going to shit on your fucking country.

1161
01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:10.050
I only shit on after you shit on my country.
All right.
Okay.

1162
01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:13.080
I don't think there's anything wrong with your continent or your country and I

1163
01:09:13.081 --> 01:09:16.200
don't think there's anything fucking wrong with the fact that you don't give a

1164
01:09:16.201 --> 01:09:20.520
shit about this.
So you think it makes your life easy.
That's fine.
All right.

1165
01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.180
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1166
01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:26.200
<v 0>But I mean,
I,
I'm not,
I don't want to be microchipped dude.
I don't,</v>

1167
01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:30.820
I also find that on my phone,
the little gps thing that fucking tell him,

1168
01:09:30.821 --> 01:09:32.530
make a left and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1169
01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:36.070
I've never had more fucking problems getting to when I had the map and I had to

1170
01:09:36.071 --> 01:09:38.830
use my brain,
I was made way more effective.

1171
01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:40.130
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1172
01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:41.180
<v 0>Way more effective.</v>

1173
01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:46.770
I start fucking looking at the picture.
They'll go make a right.

1174
01:09:46.771 --> 01:09:48.750
And then there's like a lazy right and a right.

1175
01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:51.390
And I'm looking at it and I can't,
you know,
ash,
I'm fucking driving.

1176
01:09:51.391 --> 01:09:55.080
It makes me more dangerous.
A driver.
I don't,
I dunno.

1177
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:59.010
I like using my fucking brain.
I'll figure out my own shit.

1178
01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:00.413
Um,

1179
01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:04.770
and I don't think that this stuff makes my life easier because it's constantly

1180
01:10:04.771 --> 01:10:06.600
has to be updated and replaced.

1181
01:10:06.601 --> 01:10:10.050
And then you replace it and then you throw it in the fucking ocean and you're

1182
01:10:10.051 --> 01:10:13.260
polluting the environment that you're in.
You know?

1183
01:10:13.290 --> 01:10:16.590
And I know a guy like you is probably rolling your fucking eyes right now

1184
01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:20.430
because all you give a fuck about is your little flat or whatever the fuck you

1185
01:10:20.431 --> 01:10:24.360
live.
And having them,
oh yeah.
I like soft t shirts all.

1186
01:10:24.361 --> 01:10:26.580
Thank you for that ad right there that I can click on.

1187
01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:29.880
Like if that's how you want to live your life.
God bless you.
But uh,

1188
01:10:29.881 --> 01:10:33.240
I don't think I'm being paranoid at all.

1189
01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.560
You know what I mean?
Anyways,
he said,
I'd love to see in Poland,

1190
01:10:37.561 --> 01:10:40.950
maybe the next time you were in Europe.
Uh,
I would love to go to Poland.

1191
01:10:41.490 --> 01:10:45.870
I actually heard that a up along the coast is beautiful and actually a south of

1192
01:10:45.871 --> 01:10:48.930
Poland is great places to take vacation.
Who fucking knew?

1193
01:10:49.290 --> 01:10:50.850
I didn't know that till I went over there.

1194
01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.240
So my apologies to any other part of Europe.
I didn't,

1195
01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:54.960
I just so sick of people like,
uh,

1196
01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:00.310
not seeing how fucked up their places and just constantly,
uh,
you know,

1197
01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:02.050
I want to tell him I was flying across the country.

1198
01:11:02.051 --> 01:11:03.410
There was this chick from Australia.

1199
01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:04.870
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1200
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:08.590
<v 0>We're literally in the United States flying from one us city to another and she</v>

1201
01:11:08.591 --> 01:11:12.250
shitting on the u s to me,
a US citizen.

1202
01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:16.860
Not saying we don't have our faults.
Absolutely.
Apps the fucking loopy.

1203
01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:19.800
You know what I mean?
I don't know what the fuck we're doing.

1204
01:11:19.801 --> 01:11:23.310
We want a world war in four and a half years.
We've spent 15 fucking years,

1205
01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:26.130
14 years over in fucking Iraq.
I don't know what we're doing.

1206
01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:27.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1207
01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:30.720
<v 0>Trying to put up Starbucks.
MMM.</v>

1208
01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:35.240
Anyways,
I'm not saying we don't have our fucking faults,

1209
01:11:35.241 --> 01:11:38.810
but I mean just this is just a common level of decency.

1210
01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:41.000
You know what I mean?

1211
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.210
I to sit there and go to another country and shit on the country to somebody

1212
01:11:45.211 --> 01:11:48.800
from that country and then say what country you're from it,
I don't know.
I,

1213
01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:52.140
this is Dell.
There's a fucking level of ignorance there that,
uh,

1214
01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:55.170
I just feel like Americans are always getting accused of and not everybody

1215
01:11:55.171 --> 01:11:58.620
else's patting themselves on the back about how fucking amazing their country is

1216
01:11:58.621 --> 01:12:01.290
because it's not the u s and I'm just saying,
you know,

1217
01:12:01.291 --> 01:12:03.750
you guys got your fucking warts too.
All right.

1218
01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:05.200
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1219
01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:08.500
<v 0>So fucking relax.
I like going to your countries.</v>

1220
01:12:08.501 --> 01:12:11.290
I like meeting the people over there and I know I tease you and make fun of your

1221
01:12:11.291 --> 01:12:14.620
sports of Blahblahblahblahblah.
I know I compared to Sydney,

1222
01:12:14.621 --> 01:12:17.830
Australia to Sacramento,
California.
But you know,
being,
you know,

1223
01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:22.300
just busting your fucking boss.
Maybe I'm being overly sensitive.

1224
01:12:22.301 --> 01:12:23.890
Maybe I'm the cutting this.
I have no idea.

1225
01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:24.993
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1226
01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:30.070
<v 0>All I know is uh,
I got to get on with my fucking day here because uh,</v>

1227
01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.990
obviously,
uh,
I get the bullshit I have to deal with,
you know,

1228
01:12:32.991 --> 01:12:34.370
fucking annoyed the shit out of me.

1229
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:36.800
I got to say this really fucking quickly cause I don't think it's going to get a

1230
01:12:36.801 --> 01:12:37.760
laugh from the comedy club.

1231
01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:41.000
Cause when I was watching CNN and that fucking horrific shooting at the school

1232
01:12:41.001 --> 01:12:43.510
happened and his fucking lady,
all right,

1233
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:48.550
she looks like Mary Lou Retton is flipping out because she can't get the right

1234
01:12:48.771 --> 01:12:51.500
number of dead people at the school.
It's like,

1235
01:12:51.501 --> 01:12:53.510
isn't it enough that it's a fucking tragedy?

1236
01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:55.610
What are you flipping like the sheriffs on faith?

1237
01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:59.000
Let's fucking nine people or 10 people.
It's like lady fucking relax.

1238
01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:03.800
The tragedy happened.
The tragedy is going to exist tomorrow.
All right?

1239
01:13:03.801 --> 01:13:06.950
Maybe law enforcement is trying to figure out who fucking did it.

1240
01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:11.570
Why and all of that shit.
Stop acting like you solve in the fucking case.

1241
01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.960
You're freaking out because you want to get the right amount of dead people so

1242
01:13:14.961 --> 01:13:16.260
you have the accurate shit.

1243
01:13:16.261 --> 01:13:19.520
So people will go to you and there's a fucking tragedy so you could sell,
get,

1244
01:13:19.521 --> 01:13:23.990
make more money.
When you sell your fucking fruit loops,
you fucking right.
Yeah.

1245
01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:25.920
Can't,
oh fuck.
It annoyed me.

1246
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:28.770
She sitting there screaming and yelling and just a sweetheart,
just go to bed.

1247
01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:33.810
All right.
Just go to bed.
I don't need to see.
And I,

1248
01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:37.250
and I don't understand people who sit there and they watched that shit and then

1249
01:13:37.251 --> 01:13:41.510
they show the pictures of,
of the,
uh,
the relatives and the friends crying,

1250
01:13:41.511 --> 01:13:44.210
hugging,
and all that.
I,
every time I saw it,
I would turn the fucking channel.

1251
01:13:44.211 --> 01:13:46.070
I don't want to see what the guy looked like who did it.

1252
01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:49.310
I don't want to know his fucking name.
Fuck that piece of shit.

1253
01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:54.150
I don't know if he's alive or dead.
If you know,
if he's alive,
uh,

1254
01:13:54.170 --> 01:13:58.390
they should kill him.
They should be out.
This is the guy.

1255
01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.730
This is the guy who did it without a doubt.
We know this.
Okay.

1256
01:14:00.731 --> 01:14:03.220
And you just take a right out in the fucking street to behind the year.

1257
01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:07.210
That's it.
Over.
I think they should do that with all sex offenders,

1258
01:14:07.211 --> 01:14:09.850
all pedophiles,
all of that.
You can't cure those people.

1259
01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:12.160
Just take them right out to buying a fucking

1260
01:14:12.170 --> 01:14:16.240
<v 1>ear.
All right,
drag them off,
throw them in a pit,</v>

1261
01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:20.100
bulldoze over him,
and then,
uh,
I dunno,

1262
01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:21.620
fucking turn the music on.

1263
01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:28.100
All right.
That's the podcast for this week.
Everybody.

1264
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:31.670
When it got a little sideways there at the end,
got a little sad.
I look,

1265
01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:34.070
obviously I'm a little fucking paranoid.
I'll give you that,

1266
01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:38.910
but I think it's a healthy fucking paranoia.
You don't even read,
you know,

1267
01:14:38.970 --> 01:14:41.160
when you're watching cigarette companies going like,

1268
01:14:41.161 --> 01:14:44.430
I don't think cigarettes so raw.
I don't think they're addictive at all.

1269
01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.320
Ignoring all of their fucking information.
Right?

1270
01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:53.640
Government spraying agent orange over its own fucking troops,
ignoring it,

1271
01:14:53.641 --> 01:14:58.480
denying it.
Right.
What's the latest one?
Oh,

1272
01:14:58.481 --> 01:14:59.440
that fracking.

1273
01:15:00.150 --> 01:15:03.630
It fucking absolutely destroys the drinking water and then those corporation

1274
01:15:03.631 --> 01:15:07.020
guys sit there going like,
I would drink that drinking water.
Well,
here's some,

1275
01:15:07.021 --> 01:15:10.950
would you like to drink it?
No,
I don't think I'm fucking paranoid.

1276
01:15:10.951 --> 01:15:15.660
I don't want those types of people to go around having more information on the

1277
01:15:15.661 --> 01:15:20.560
public because there are absolute fucking psychopaths.
Dude,

1278
01:15:20.561 --> 01:15:24.000
the head of Nestle doesn't think water is a basic human right.
He wants to,

1279
01:15:24.001 --> 01:15:25.380
he wants to own the rain.

1280
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:29.530
These people are out of their fucking minds and the president only makes four

1281
01:15:29.531 --> 01:15:31.770
and a grant of fucking year in needs.
That guy's money,

1282
01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:35.550
so they're not going to talk about those guys.
Oh,
but God forbid,

1283
01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:38.880
God forbid you make fun of Caitlyn Jenner and a fucking strip mall.

1284
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.390
You're going to make the fucking national notes.
Oh,
I'm on my soapbox.

1285
01:15:43.410 --> 01:15:45.810
Go Fuck Yourself.
You can't sell.
Talk to you on Thursday.
Okay.
