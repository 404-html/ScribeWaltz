00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.380
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:05.381 --> 00:00:09.580
September 22nd,
2014 I you doing ow why?
Yeah.

3
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.220
Did you enjoy your weekend?

4
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.440
Well that's good.
I had to wait to respond to,
do you see that?

5
00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:22.441
That's the new me trying to be a little more courteous trying to listen to the

6
00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:25.120
listener.
No to the speaker.

7
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.490
That's how much I interrupt people actually call the other person talking the

8
00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:35.470
listener.
This I call the speaker,
the listener.
That's how I do it.

9
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.140
Now.
Gives a fuck.
Um,
anyways,
I got another Goddamn busy week.

10
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.740
I been writing on this show that I'm trying to get on the fucking air and I'm

11
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:50.490
not going to tell you really what it is because it doesn't make a difference

12
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:53.540
cause most of them don't end up making it.
So,
but uh,

13
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:56.290
I've been in a bubble doing that all fucking day.

14
00:00:56.291 --> 00:00:59.650
And then at night I'm trying to go out and write some new jokes cause I got some

15
00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:03.660
shows coming up.
Um,
I'm going to be in San Francisco.
We just added another,

16
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.000
the show at the Davies arena whenever the fuck it's called.

17
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.120
And uh,
so I appreciate everybody in San Francisco.

18
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.140
I plan on kicking the shit out of you and giving you your money's worth.

19
00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.540
So I've been going out like every night here in Los Angeles,

20
00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:22.380
trying to get up on stage somewhere somehow somewhere.
And uh,

21
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.610
I've been writing during the day.
I got a fucking job.
Everybody,

22
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.290
you know,
I got a little pass code key.
I come in,

23
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.790
say hello to the fucking person at the desk.
How are you?

24
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.650
And I fucking do the little swipey thing and I go in there,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,

25
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:42.940
pop,
pop.
Right?

26
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.370
And I fucking go in there and I try to come up with some funny shit to add to

27
00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:51.990
the other funny shit that other people are writing.
Um,
no,

28
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.520
Jeez.
It's actually been a lot of fun to be honest with you.

29
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.310
And uh,
I'm learning,
I'm learning to ride.

30
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.960
I'm learning how a script comes together,

31
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:05.160
which I never knew how to do it because I was too scattered brain and a,

32
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.250
for the most part in life.
I'm a fucking quit.

33
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.420
I really am.
I just,
when I go do something,
if it's easy and it's fun,

34
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.030
I keep doing it.
If there's a little bit of work to it,

35
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.980
that brutal combination is if there's a little bit of work and I don't like it,

36
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.820
I'm done.
And a that would explain my,

37
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.200
my high school transcripts,

38
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.710
I did horrible fucking horrible in high school.

39
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.280
Like I don't know how,
like if that was a PGA tournament,

40
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.620
I would not have made the cut.
Um,

41
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.600
<v 0>okay.</v>

42
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.120
<v 1>I think freshman year I might've made the cut,
but sophomore,
no junior known.</v>

43
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.690
Especially in senior year it was,
it was over.
It was fucking over.

44
00:02:55.691 --> 00:02:56.141
You know what,

45
00:02:56.141 --> 00:03:01.141
you know what my fucking high school performance was like basically the Broncos

46
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.140
in last year's super bowl.
All right.

47
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:08.080
I walked up to the line of scrimmage and I'm like,
I'm going to be a lawyer.

48
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:11.470
I'm going to Notre Dame.
That's what I'm doing freshman year.
Right.
It comes,

49
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:12.950
you know,
first play from scrimmage,

50
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.040
everybody yelling and it fucking went right up over my head for a safety.

51
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.460
I never got the rhythm back.
I know there was no rhythm,
there was nothing.

52
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.760
I did really well.
I did really well right up to eighth grade that really,

53
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:29.230
really well.
But I did great.

54
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.780
I gradually tapered off my,

55
00:03:32.781 --> 00:03:37.130
like my academic career from first grade to 12th grade was like,

56
00:03:37.131 --> 00:03:41.040
like an athlete's career.
You know,
I had young,

57
00:03:41.041 --> 00:03:43.590
fresh legs and everything was going great.

58
00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:46.330
I was bouncing up after he hits and tackles and all that shit.

59
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:47.460
A cruise through first,

60
00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:52.461
second and third grade and I got my first c I think in fourth grade

61
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.560
and in fifth grade I had to quit my baseball team cause I got a d in math.

62
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.370
Then sixth grade I came back strong contract year,
right.

63
00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:08.940
Going into seventh grade,
seventh grade I did decent.

64
00:04:08.941 --> 00:04:12.900
Eighth Grade I did decent,
didn't quite live up to the big contract they gave me.

65
00:04:12.901 --> 00:04:17.830
After that stunning sixth grade year and then ninth grade or I dunno,
I blew up,

66
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:22.800
my Achilles came back from injury and the sophomore dredges to just shit the
bed.

67
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.000
It was over.
It was over by senior year,

68
00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:30.360
I was wearing my Joe Nemeth Rams Jersey,
academically speaking,

69
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.310
and it was fucking over and that's the way it was back in 1987.
Um,

70
00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:37.800
so anyways,
this is the Monday morning podcast site and he knew,

71
00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:39.150
listens listeners out there,

72
00:04:39.151 --> 00:04:42.870
how are you welcome to people who listen to this around the world,
world,
world,

73
00:04:42.871 --> 00:04:46.890
world,
world.
Um,
what the fuck happened in Scotland?

74
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.570
You know,
you would have,
I thought that they were going to break away.

75
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.940
I thought they had had enough.

76
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.450
You know what I should do as I shouldn't read up on it at all.

77
00:04:57.451 --> 00:04:59.430
I should just start talking about it.
You know,

78
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.890
that's my God given right as a fucking American rights Scotland.

79
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.770
Um,
independence.

80
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.860
Let's see what happened when the folks who are fucking court,

81
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.560
the podcast,
you're fucking scared.
Where include,

82
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.850
um,
polls were pretty bad.

83
00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:25.290
It says Scotland faces challenge of putting reference referendum behind them.

84
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.510
Oh yeah.
He just started everybody up.

85
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.080
This is probably even more fights in the bus

86
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.200
again to a Scottish accent.

87
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.020
The only reason why I could say what I already said was cause it was said to me,

88
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.290
other than that it can't do it.
I'm like a really bad person here.

89
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:42.390
You know what I mean?
Like if I,

90
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.990
if those like a really bad impression is all they do is the shit that people say

91
00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:49.480
in the movies.
Like I'll be back.
They just do that.
But you know,

92
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.730
the really great ones like Jay Moore can actually do a Arnold Schwarzenegger in

93
00:05:53.731 --> 00:05:58.400
therapy talking about having a child out of wedlock,
you know?

94
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.900
Um,
anyways,
well I'm all over the fucking place.

95
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.680
The pros and cons of Scottish independence as if your life wasn't boring enough.

96
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.360
Let's talk about this shit.
I think it's a good move that they didn't,

97
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:18.170
uh,
that they didn't break away.
Right.

98
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.670
<v 0>Okay.</v>

99
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.370
<v 1>The Scotland have an army or a navy.</v>

100
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

101
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.380
<v 2>Go fuck yourselves.
All right.
I'm sorry that I don't know this shit.</v>

102
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.210
Okay.
Why don't you fucking invade somebody every once in a while and maybe,

103
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:36.080
maybe I'll know about your team's over there.
All right.
The effort.
No.

104
00:06:36.081 --> 00:06:37.580
Referendum ends one debate,

105
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:42.581
but sparks a new question about the devolution of power to Scotland.

106
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.310
I hope I said that right.
Scotland has rejected independence falling way.

107
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:48.620
Historically high turnout at yesterday's referendum,

108
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.380
chief accounting officer and Mary pick a Deli,

109
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:56.240
whatever the fuck her name is officially announced that no side one by 55%

110
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:57.763
<v 1>oh the no side</v>

111
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.610
<v 2>and the worst that the no side one by 55% to 45% no normal person was allowed to</v>

112
00:07:06.991 --> 00:07:11.870
count the votes.
So everyone has to take that as fact.
Uh,
the clock and my shy,

113
00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:16.530
shy Shire Council was the first local authority to announce its results at

114
00:07:16.531 --> 00:07:20.760
around 1:30 AM or gives a fuck.
You at Union is celebrated victories.

115
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:25.030
Blahblahblahblahblah nationalists,
one done d by pretty blah,
blah,
blah.

116
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.400
<v 1>Well,
what the fuck?
Why did he wait a minute.
Wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
Whoa.</v>

117
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.480
<v 0>Okay.</v>

118
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.340
<v 2>When did Scotland become part of the UK?</v>

119
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.390
The acts of union between Scotland and England were pass the 1706 taken effect.

120
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.040
Didn't they get taken over?

121
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.100
<v 1>I don't know.
Something happened there.
And next thing you know,</v>

122
00:07:44.101 --> 00:07:48.040
Mel Gibson was in dress.
That's all I know.
He was in a scared,

123
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.740
um,
yeah.
Why are you going to work?
You know,
I don't,
you know something,

124
00:07:52.741 --> 00:07:56.670
I don't know anything about it.
I don't know anything about it,

125
00:07:56.671 --> 00:08:00.180
but I bet there was a bunch of old Scottish people who didn't want to upset.

126
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:01.080
You know,

127
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.800
they were going to take the evil that they knew rather than the unknown evil,

128
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.000
you know,

129
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.870
what are they doing tax in the Shit Outta you making you do the shit jobs?

130
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.590
Is that what it is?
What would have happened to England if,
Scott,

131
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.260
can you guys answer me these fucking questions cause I'm not going to read up on

132
00:08:17.261 --> 00:08:19.390
it.
What would it happen to?
The power of England.

133
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:20.780
<v 0>Okay.</v>

134
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.613
<v 1>You know,</v>

135
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.620
which I don't even know what it's based on at this point because they don't own

136
00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:28.430
shit anymore.
Do they?
What do they,
oh,

137
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.600
they got like the Canary Islands in Northern Ireland and Scotland and Wales.

138
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.840
Right.
Falkland Islands.
Didn't they lose that?

139
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.440
Something happened over there like 30 fucking years ago and all of a sudden the

140
00:08:42.441 --> 00:08:46.640
planes would take an off straight,
straight up in the air.
I remember that

141
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.180
<v 2>way back in the day.
Nancy Reagan.
Ronald Reagan.</v>

142
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.640
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

143
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.090
<v 1>Uh,
Margaret Thatcher.</v>

144
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.980
I don't fucking know.
I don't know what happened.

145
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:01.910
I can't believe how little I even know about it.
I can even,
I,

146
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.860
I don't know anything about it.
I'm going to shut up then.
Well,

147
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:08.580
congratulations to people of Scotland,
uh,
who didn't want to leave.

148
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:13.200
And I feel bad for those who did and I really wish I could have talked about it

149
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:15.780
a little more intelligently.
But,
uh,
you know,
every once in a while you just,

150
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.831
you just,
you know,

151
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:19.350
you think the water is like two inches deep and next thing you know,

152
00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:23.610
you're in over your head.
That's what happened to me.
Oh,
Jj is,

153
00:09:23.611 --> 00:09:26.790
that might've been the worst discussion of anything political ever.

154
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.480
That was even bad for me.
That was a fucking embarrassment.
Well,

155
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.600
I'll tell you right now,
it far,

156
00:09:32.601 --> 00:09:36.380
that last conversation was indicative of what this podcast is going to be.

157
00:09:36.381 --> 00:09:38.690
I could tell you right now,
I don't think he's going to get it done this week.

158
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.850
Okay.
Uh,

159
00:09:40.851 --> 00:09:44.260
if you take the chicken to have a good podcast and the national park casting

160
00:09:44.261 --> 00:09:47.670
league with that type of performance.
Ah Man,
man,
man.
What,

161
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.690
what did I say about his preparation?
Ooh,
I could change.

162
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:58.480
Um,
I didn't watch any of that.

163
00:09:58.481 --> 00:10:01.050
You guys want you in the pregame analysis?
You know what I was,
I,

164
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.880
I have a rental car.
Of course.
Still a rental car.

165
00:10:03.881 --> 00:10:08.290
I haven't seen my fucking truck in like months because the people fixing the

166
00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:08.891
downstairs,

167
00:10:08.891 --> 00:10:11.230
they've got to walk to my garage and I don't want to get it scratched.

168
00:10:11.231 --> 00:10:13.390
I want to leave it out on the street.
So I got it in storage.

169
00:10:13.391 --> 00:10:17.470
It started up once a week.
That's my life.
Okay.
So anyways,

170
00:10:17.471 --> 00:10:18.910
I've been driving this fucking car.

171
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.460
I got this new one and I suck with technology.

172
00:10:21.461 --> 00:10:25.180
I can't figure out how to turn the radio on two auxiliary so I can listen to my

173
00:10:25.181 --> 00:10:29.050
fucking show tunes there as I drive down the street.
Right.

174
00:10:29.051 --> 00:10:33.160
Roll out the barrel.
That's the kind of music I listen to when I drive.

175
00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.970
You know,
I listened to funny girl.

176
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:38.510
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

177
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:42.500
<v 1>Oh Glove Houma.
When the something something and there's something,
right.</v>

178
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.260
I don't know any fucking show tunes.
Wait a minute.

179
00:10:46.261 --> 00:10:51.261
To dream the impossible dream to dress like a fucking kitty cat

180
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.850
to descend on a glowing moon.

181
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:05.290
Well a crowd of old hey eggs and some young homosexuals cry in the crowd.

182
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.850
Um,
anyways.

183
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.290
Sorry.
All right.
What the fuck am I talking about here?

184
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.630
There was something I wanted to talk about before I started singing show tunes.

185
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:22.821
Oh yeah.

186
00:11:22.821 --> 00:11:25.580
I was driving down the fucking street and the car and I can't figure out how to

187
00:11:25.581 --> 00:11:27.230
listen to my God damn songs.

188
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:31.460
So I've just been listening to sports talk radio cause I don't want to listen to

189
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:36.680
real news.
It's too fucking depressing.
I don't want to listen to them.

190
00:11:36.681 --> 00:11:40.610
Try and sell me on the idea that we just have to go into Syria.

191
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.240
Yeah.
Now we just got it.
Doe It.

192
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:50.420
It's our job to go over there and tell these people,

193
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.810
well Yay.
Yay.
Hey,
that's about enough for

194
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:59.080
is we suck their natural resources out of the fucking ground and bomb the living

195
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:01.570
shit out of innocent people standing around.
You know,

196
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:03.760
I don't want to listen to them sell me in another one of those.

197
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:06.520
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

198
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.180
<v 1>Well as it's an initial freedom,</v>

199
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.080
the way they are [inaudible] whether somebody needs to be done.
I thought,

200
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.530
hey pal that I,
well I don't give a fuck.
I don't care anymore.
All right.

201
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.800
Oh and I would vote.
I would vote if you actually fucking countered them.
Um,

202
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.390
and if I wasn't lazy as Shit,
I got a big pamphlet today.

203
00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:28.450
There was telling me all about the local officials and I just took one look at

204
00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:31.630
that.
Does it mean it's written on recycled paper?

205
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.010
It's overcast paper.
That's what it looks like.
Overcast skies,

206
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:38.590
except there's typing on it.
They do it on purpose.

207
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.590
Who the fuck is going to read that?

208
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.303
<v 3>MMM.</v>

209
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.610
<v 1>So anyways,
I was driving down the street Lulu,
Lulu Dude,</v>

210
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:51.780
and I'm listening to a that Mike and Mike in the morning and like I've been,

211
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.920
I've been really hard on these fucking pregame postgame sports talk guys.

212
00:12:55.921 --> 00:12:58.890
I actually now have empathy for them.
I understand what they're doing.

213
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.750
There's just too much time.
There's too much air time between games.

214
00:13:03.751 --> 00:13:07.710
And they just have to talk everything to death.

215
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.120
And this week I swear to God,

216
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:13.670
<v 3>yeah,</v>

217
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.370
<v 1>my goal luck of the Mike and Mike Show,
right?
Yeah.</v>

218
00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:17.770
<v 3>Okay.</v>

219
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.300
<v 1>They read a letter and a,
it was somebody who's basically,</v>

220
00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:22.950
he was tight.

221
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:27.910
He was respectfully tired of listening to the Adrian Peterson Story,

222
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.840
the ray rice story and all of that shit.
And it was just like,

223
00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:35.830
can we just get back to talking about football?
Signed a tired football fan.

224
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.060
And I swear to God this,
I'm paraphrasing,
but this is kind of what gold said.

225
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.080
He goes,
you know what I want to do?
I want to,
I want to right now,

226
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.970
I don't want to talk to the players.
I don't want to talk to y'all.

227
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.690
I don't want to talk to the media.
I want to talk to you.
The Fan.

228
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.860
They know when I'm on Mike,
Mike,
this is something that I want to get out there.

229
00:13:55.861 --> 00:14:00.480
Is,
is this game your safe haven?

230
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:02.060
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

231
00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.050
<v 1>Is it your safe haven?</v>

232
00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:08.420
Like on Sunday when you sit down in your chair,

233
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:09.760
<v 3>okay.</v>

234
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.660
<v 1>Eh,
and,
and,
and you,
you,
you take out your,
your,
your,
your,</v>

235
00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:14.920
your favorite beverage.

236
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:20.380
Is that your safe haven is the national football,
he kept saying,

237
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.220
is that your safe haven?
What the fuck does that mean?

238
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.950
How simplistic and fucking stupid do they think the average football fan is?

239
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.110
Was I supposed to be driving in my car on,

240
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.230
<v 3>I've heard of safety.
What?
I watched football.</v>

241
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.590
<v 1>What the fuck is he talking about?
I got to tell you something.</v>

242
00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:50.480
This is really immature.
Me.
I hate when overweight people bring up food.

243
00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.980
I don't what it is,
but I swear to God you can already hear them salivating.

244
00:14:55.610 --> 00:15:00.020
I never had an issue with the word beverage until I heard Mike Golic said,

245
00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.330
you need to take out your favorite beverage.

246
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.590
I just heard the fucking ice hitting the inside of the glass and I swear to God

247
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:10.520
I wanted to drive into a fucking pole.
I had to shut it off like three times,

248
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:14.720
but I was like,
no,
this is good for the podcast.
You got to listen to it.

249
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.860
And uh,
he just,
is it,
is it your safe haven?

250
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.890
I mean just absolutely out of shit to talk about.
I mean,
I didn't know what,

251
00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.960
I didn't know what,
what the,
what the fuck does that?

252
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.360
I didn't listen to it long enough to somebody actually call in

253
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:35.160
a safe fucking haven.
You know what?

254
00:15:35.161 --> 00:15:38.760
I'm going to look that up right now and I want to see examples of safe havens.

255
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.350
I know exactly what they are.

256
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:44.430
It's like captains in the middle of a fucking storm trying to find a port so

257
00:15:44.431 --> 00:15:46.590
they don't get smashed on rocks.
Yeah.

258
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:51.420
Either that or some fat fucking his pajamas with some potato skins watching

259
00:15:51.421 --> 00:15:55.380
football.
Yeah.
Just,
let's just,
let's just fucking devalue safe haven.

260
00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.370
I'm looking it up right now.
Below was a movie.

261
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:04.620
There's a film.
It's a county.
How about a fucking definition?

262
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.690
Well,
Bill,
why don't you search for that and stop yelling at a screen.
All right.

263
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.600
All right.
Definition.
Safe Haven.
A place of refuge or security.

264
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:19.020
Temporary refuge given to a person.

265
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.100
Persecuted person or group.

266
00:16:21.101 --> 00:16:24.120
So is he trying to say that were persecuted by them saying,

267
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.990
talking about the same shit day after fucking day after day.

268
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:30.070
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

269
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.200
<v 1>Is it your safe haven?</v>

270
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:33.790
<v 0>Okay.</v>

271
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:38.790
<v 1>And officially protected place in an area of military activity or any safe or</v>

272
00:16:38.981 --> 00:16:41.860
peaceful place in a dangerous area.

273
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:44.240
All right.

274
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.620
Amanda magnets to say that he overstepped the bounds of the definition of that

275
00:16:48.621 --> 00:16:53.600
word to apply it to sitting there fucking eating pizza and drinking booze.

276
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.530
<v 0>Okay.</v>

277
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:58.500
<v 1>You know,
I don't fucking know.</v>

278
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.420
Anyways.
Um,
and I'm sitting there going like,

279
00:17:03.421 --> 00:17:07.680
how fucking dumb does this guy think the average football fan is?

280
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:12.710
And then I watched the Fsu gang and I am a huge fan

281
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.970
<v 0>okay.</v>

282
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.060
<v 1>Of Florida state.
I've always loved the Seminoles.</v>

283
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.220
I want to go to a game I had went to,

284
00:17:19.221 --> 00:17:21.650
I did a show down there like a year and a half ago,

285
00:17:21.651 --> 00:17:22.850
but I got to tell you something.

286
00:17:22.851 --> 00:17:26.510
I watched this fucking game and in the first drive alone,

287
00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.490
they played that fucking,

288
00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.510
what do you call the Tomahawk chance song?

289
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.910
They must have played it like seven times.

290
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.593
<v 4>Duh.</v>

291
00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.620
<v 1>Right.
And the fucking crowd is going on</v>

292
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:54.320
fucking arms.
I get it.
Everybody's got their little yeah.
Thing that they do,

293
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:58.700
you know,
and uh,
you know,
I,
you know,
whatever,

294
00:17:58.701 --> 00:18:00.910
you just kind of fucking and mocking a,

295
00:18:00.911 --> 00:18:04.550
a group of people that were victims of genocide.

296
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:10.880
How many,
who's to say,
I mean,
if the Nazis,
you know,
if they won World War Two,

297
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:14.320
what will they not have had dev version of the Tomahawk Chop with?
Oh,

298
00:18:14.321 --> 00:18:15.154
a Jewish people.

299
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.490
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

300
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.380
<v 1>What would they be doing?
What is,
what if you were doing,</v>

301
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:23.440
if the Nazis won and then they fucking named their team offensive names about

302
00:18:24.501 --> 00:18:29.430
Jewish people,
what would the Tomahawk Chop?
What would it be?
Okay.

303
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:32.221
Oh,

304
00:18:32.221 --> 00:18:37.080
eva or whatever the fuck you was a Yada,

305
00:18:37.081 --> 00:18:41.360
Yada,
and I was,
fuck you.
I'm sorry.
What do you want from me?
I'm tired.

306
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.190
Right?
They would all have like fucking,

307
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.010
they'd be dressed like just Siddiq Jews or something like that,

308
00:18:47.011 --> 00:18:48.210
but cartoonish version.

309
00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:51.730
It's like one of them would come out riding a fucking horse with a goddamn

310
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:52.950
briefcase,
some shit,

311
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.700
and he'd fucking go to slam it down on the 50 yard line for getting it was

312
00:18:59.701 --> 00:19:02.760
handcuffed to his wrist and he turned his head to a lawn dart.

313
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:06.960
Something like that.
Right?
Oh,
eva.

314
00:19:06.961 --> 00:19:09.450
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
We'll

315
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.960
the Berlin woody Allen's
Berlin.
Woody's.

316
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:20.890
I'm sorry,
what do you want from me anyways?

317
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.870
Anyway,
so what the fuck.
So I,

318
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:29.210
and then what was worse was they kept cutting to the crowd and you know,

319
00:19:29.211 --> 00:19:31.310
I talked to fire her or nothing.
You know,

320
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:36.530
I always heard that the checks at Fsu a fucking,
I heard they will hot dude.

321
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.350
All I saw,
it looked like,
you know,

322
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:43.250
there was a hurricane and everybody,

323
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.150
I dunno.
Well they,

324
00:19:47.151 --> 00:19:51.610
they look for a safe haven in fucking Walmart and they just opened the door and

325
00:19:51.611 --> 00:19:52.960
all these fucking zombies came.

326
00:19:52.961 --> 00:19:57.040
I was just a bunch of people standing there mindlessly moving their fucking,
I'm

327
00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:02.290
like,
I'm telling you like 1520 times a half,

328
00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.190
40 times in a fucking gang,
just sitting there doing that shit.
And I just,

329
00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:07.910
<v 0>okay.</v>

330
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:09.850
<v 1>You don't want to do right now.
I don't want to talk to the players.</v>

331
00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:10.900
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

332
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.820
<v 1>I don't want to talk to me.
I want to talk to the fans.</v>

333
00:20:12.821 --> 00:20:17.210
I want to talk to the fans in that fucking stadium.
Like what?

334
00:20:17.211 --> 00:20:20.200
What is going through your fucking head?
The 30th,

335
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:23.440
the 35th fucking time you're doing that.
At any point,

336
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.000
do you sit there and start to question whether you're an individual anymore?

337
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.740
What kind of a fucking person you do if you're,
I don't know.

338
00:20:31.741 --> 00:20:33.930
I never been to the game.
Do you,
do you take a few of them off?

339
00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:35.460
<v 0>Okay.</v>

340
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.630
<v 1>Right.
Well,
you know,
what am I going to do it this time?
Just,</v>

341
00:20:37.631 --> 00:20:42.340
just so I can keep a piece of me,
right.
I don't know.
Don't listen to me.

342
00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:47.020
I am completely,
I am antisocial,
like beyond belief.

343
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.540
The stuff that actually makes me mad.
It's weird.

344
00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:54.410
I like can't stand people and I also liked them.
I can't stand him to the point.

345
00:20:54.411 --> 00:20:55.430
I don't want to be around them.

346
00:20:55.431 --> 00:20:59.340
But when I see them doing shit that I feel they're above,
um,

347
00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.250
it makes me sad for him.
Like,

348
00:21:01.251 --> 00:21:04.680
I was sad for some of those people when I looked at him like,
what are you dope?

349
00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:09.140
Come on.
You know,
I don't want to use that hacky term.
You're better than that.

350
00:21:09.141 --> 00:21:11.360
I hate when people say that shit.
You're better than that.
It's like,

351
00:21:11.361 --> 00:21:14.330
you know what?
You're better.
You're better than you.
Better than that.
All right.

352
00:21:14.331 --> 00:21:18.500
Don't try your fucking first grade psychology on me.
Oh baby.

353
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.100
I am better than that.
Oh,
I guess I agree with you.
Now.
Give me a fucking break.

354
00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:23.613
Um,

355
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:28.010
it's like when you see people waiting out for a fucking phone.

356
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:29.570
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

357
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:32.150
<v 1>Like those fucking losers.
I can't,
it,
you're into the,</v>

358
00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:37.160
I get it that you're into it.
All right.
Whatever the fuck I'm into.

359
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.880
All right.
Whatever.
I like playing drums.

360
00:21:40.881 --> 00:21:43.640
Let's say they came out with the greatest fucking drum kit and you could have a

361
00:21:43.641 --> 00:21:46.790
fucking hat.
And I wanted it worse than I,

362
00:21:46.791 --> 00:21:49.970
and I wanted anything in my life like the way those fucking kids,

363
00:21:49.971 --> 00:21:52.100
like the God damn iPhone.
This,

364
00:21:52.101 --> 00:21:55.400
I'm not sleeping out on a sidewalk for it.

365
00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:56.950
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

366
00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.480
<v 1>When a week later I could just walk in like a fucking human being.
Go.
Yeah.
Good.</v>

367
00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:04.450
Let me get one of those.
Thank you.
Box it up there,
rusty.
Right?

368
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:09.370
The first one.
This one,
it has the phone.

369
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.540
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

370
00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:15.110
<v 1>You know,
I asked this week on Twitter,
I asked what,
what Roku was.</v>

371
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:20.570
Somebody gave me a Roku.
Right.
I had no idea what I opened it.

372
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.450
And uh,
I had no idea what it was.

373
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.120
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

374
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.540
<v 1>And um,
you know what's funny,</v>

375
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:32.570
I so didn't even know what it was.
I don't even like read.

376
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:33.590
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

377
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:36.680
<v 1>I noticed that about myself.
Like it's said Roku right on the box.</v>

378
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:38.160
<v 3>Okay.</v>

379
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.600
<v 1>But I was just looking at the picture of it and I was reading the fine print or</v>

380
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.190
immediately I didn't know what the fuck it was.

381
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:49.560
So I did a live podcast with Al Madrigal and uh,

382
00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.690
I was trying to describe what it was,

383
00:22:51.691 --> 00:22:54.870
cause I didn't know what it was in Neil Brennan.
I gotta give him props,

384
00:22:54.871 --> 00:22:59.460
actually called it.
He said,
is it a Roku?
And I think I said no.

385
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.100
<v 3>Okay.</v>

386
00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:05.010
<v 1>Anyways,
I tried looking it up on the Internet and I,</v>

387
00:23:05.011 --> 00:23:07.770
and the description of it,
I'd still didn't understand what it was.

388
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:12.390
So like an asshole.
I ask on my Twitter,
I go,
hey,
this isn't any,
I just said,

389
00:23:12.391 --> 00:23:16.580
you know what's a Roku
and you can't believe this shit.

390
00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:19.350
I understand like the funny answers that people gave me,

391
00:23:19.351 --> 00:23:23.760
but there was a lot of people giving me fucking shit like I was a moron or

392
00:23:23.761 --> 00:23:24.594
something.

393
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.760
I don't get that shit talking with technology where just because you go out and

394
00:23:29.761 --> 00:23:33.630
you buy the latest thing,
like that somehow makes you smarter than me now.

395
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.753
<v 3>Okay.</v>

396
00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:37.430
<v 1>I could see if you invented it.</v>

397
00:23:37.431 --> 00:23:40.820
It's like the person who invented Roku said I was a fucking moron.

398
00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:42.860
I mean I got to take that one on the chin,

399
00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.130
but if you're just another breathing moron

400
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:51.130
<v 2>like me walking around the fucking best buy and you walk in and you buy a Roku,</v>

401
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:55.460
I mean,
I don't know.
I don't get the fucking shit talk.
That's all I'm saying.

402
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:56.421
All these nerds,

403
00:23:56.421 --> 00:24:01.160
all of a sudden action like quarterbacks in the NFL getting in my fucking face

404
00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:05.120
on Twitter.
Jesus.
I feel like I'm bitching a lot this week.
Let's,

405
00:24:05.121 --> 00:24:07.850
let's do a little,
uh,
let's do a little advertisement.

406
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:14.030
Let's do a little advertisement here.
Um,
all right.
All right.

407
00:24:14.031 --> 00:24:16.610
What the fuck is it?
A dollar shave club.
Everybody.

408
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:20.270
Is there anything worse than buying razors?

409
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.150
You got to remember that you need them in the first place.

410
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.790
You got to sit in traffic to go to the store.

411
00:24:25.791 --> 00:24:29.720
You've got to find that locked plaque.
Uh,
that locked plastic fortress.

412
00:24:29.721 --> 00:24:33.320
They keep them in.
That's so ridiculous that you got to find somebody with a key,

413
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.970
right?
Find the one dude,

414
00:24:34.971 --> 00:24:38.990
he's got the key and he's in the back texting his girlfriend or he's outside

415
00:24:38.991 --> 00:24:43.340
smoking a joint.
After all that,
it's going to set you back like 25 bucks.

416
00:24:43.341 --> 00:24:46.820
Do you really need to deal with that anymore?
You don't never do it again.

417

uh,
to the

470
00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:59.440
<v 1>cast here.
Um,
anyways,
what else did I do this week?</v>

471
00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:03.530
<v 2>I watched a bunch of football.
I got to tell you.
Um,
I've got to tell you,</v>

472
00:28:03.531 --> 00:28:06.440
I'd be like gotta be a little concerned with what I saw up there and stock

473
00:28:06.441 --> 00:28:08.090
sparrow with the New England patriots.

474
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:13.890
<v 1>Um,
I don't know.
You don't,
what the Patriots have been doing forever is we,</v>

475
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:15.870
we get rid of guys,

476
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:20.760
we get rid of veterans and the final third of their career when they want the

477
00:28:20.761 --> 00:28:22.560
big bucks,
we kind of let them go.

478
00:28:22.561 --> 00:28:27.561
Thai law lawyer Malloy a fucking defensive tackle we sent to the Raiders.

479
00:28:27.901 --> 00:28:29.040
I mean there's been so many of them.

480
00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:34.790
Latest one Logan Mankins Senate to a Tampa Bay or whatever.

481
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:36.780
And um,

482
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:41.340
I don't think that's working for us because you get a great veteran and then

483
00:28:41.341 --> 00:28:46.170
that dude leaves and then you have a hole in that position for like three years

484
00:28:46.171 --> 00:28:47.970
waiting for somebody to get up to speed.

485
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.150
And by the time that guy figures out how to play the position,

486
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:55.230
somebody else gets let go.
And now we've got a problem over there.
I mean,

487
00:28:55.231 --> 00:28:58.710
I guess you're always going to have a fucking problem.
But,
um,

488
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:04.190
I don't know.
I see a slowly starting to slide.
I mean,

489
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:09.350
the way we let the Raiders hang around that long and they should have won the

490
00:29:10.051 --> 00:29:10.884
fucking game.

491
00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.850
They didn't shoot the other beat the Raiders if they didn't shoot themselves in

492
00:29:14.851 --> 00:29:18.990
the foot.
I just don't understand why the Raiders,
they just,
I dunno.

493
00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:24.320
It's like they knew how to win games and for the last 30 years they stopped all

494
00:29:24.781 --> 00:29:28.860
went out.
The fucking,
I dunno.
I think it's Karma.
It's a Karma thing.

495
00:29:28.861 --> 00:29:31.950
It has to do with their fans and how they disgraced being a football fan by

496
00:29:31.951 --> 00:29:36.900
going there dressed up like spongebob squarepants but you have on brass

497
00:29:36.901 --> 00:29:39.030
knuckles.
I just don't understand that.

498
00:29:39.031 --> 00:29:42.220
I don't understand why you have to take your dignity and throw it out the

499
00:29:42.221 --> 00:29:45.490
fucking window.
Or am I talking about all rate of fans I'm talking to,
you know,

500
00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:47.530
with fans of talking about.
All right.

501
00:29:47.531 --> 00:29:51.850
So thank God it was a home game so they didn't have to keep talking about the

502
00:29:51.851 --> 00:29:56.770
black hole,
you know,
you know those,
you know those places to black hole,

503
00:29:56.771 --> 00:29:57.790
the dog pound,

504
00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:02.170
the entire Seattle Seahawks stadium actually watched it.

505
00:30:02.171 --> 00:30:06.820
What a fucking game that was,
man.
Um,
Seattle,
a Broncos game,

506
00:30:06.821 --> 00:30:07.930
fucking awesome game.

507
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.220
But at one point they cut to the crowd and some guy had this fucking lime green

508
00:30:12.221 --> 00:30:14.680
Sam that you sign that just said loud,

509
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.560
like he went out and made that or something.

510
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:25.590
It's just the dumbest thing.
I have to commend them.
I,

511
00:30:25.591 --> 00:30:27.820
I mean I fast forward through a lot of it cause I,
you know,

512
00:30:27.821 --> 00:30:31.990
I was out living a life when I came back and I watched the tape,
my tape of the,

513
00:30:31.991 --> 00:30:35.020
uh,
the game and uh,
they didn't bring it up that much,

514
00:30:35.021 --> 00:30:39.700
which thank God they didn't enough already with the stupid 12th man and all of

515
00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:43.660
that shit.
Um,
anyways,

516
00:30:43.661 --> 00:30:47.830
but the game was fucking awesome.
And,
um,

517
00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:53.020
I thought Seattle,
I thought it was done.
And uh,
what was it,
20 to five,

518
00:30:53.021 --> 00:30:56.710
17 to five or something like that.
I think it was like 21,
five.
I don't even know.

519
00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:01.420
Fucking Broncos came back in.

520
00:31:01.421 --> 00:31:04.240
Our Peyton throws a big pic and then comes back with the,
I don't know,

521
00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:06.620
<v 2>I don't get why on that final drive,</v>

522
00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:10.340
whenever it's every fucking drive is that the prevent defense,

523
00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:14.480
they always go down the field and score or they always,
they always drive down.

524
00:31:14.481 --> 00:31:17.000
At the very least they're going to get in the red zone.

525
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:20.290
That whole bullshit of like,
you know,
we'll uh,

526
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:24.050
take away the sidelines and we'll give them the middle of the field and somehow

527
00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.740
this just magically not supposed to be enough time left on the clock and they

528
00:31:27.741 --> 00:31:30.680
fucking always is like 90% of the time.

529
00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:36.530
But it actually seemed like a Seattle was playing defense set.

530
00:31:36.531 --> 00:31:38.070
You blowing your nose in that Nia.

531
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:43.530
<v 1>Yeah,
she's got the allergies.
Um,</v>

532
00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:50.530
<v 2>cute little nose.
She makes all that noise.
Um,</v>

533
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:55.800
<v 1>anyways,
it was a great fucking game and I was happy that uh,
you know,</v>

534
00:31:55.801 --> 00:31:58.820
both teams played well and there wasn't any fucking incidents of screaming,

535
00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:01.460
yelling or any of that type of shit.
Um,

536
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:04.830
the day started off bad with them talking about the,
uh,

537
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:09.990
the Goddamn Paul Tag.
You'll boot boo or fucking Pete Rozelle,

538
00:32:09.991 --> 00:32:12.750
whatever the fucking new guy's name is.
I don't even know what his name is,

539
00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.750
Doug Fairbanks.
We're going to,
wouldn't go with that.

540
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.120
Gary Greenberg.
The fuck is his name.
You'd think it.
Yeah.

541
00:32:21.121 --> 00:32:22.230
That's how much I don't watch it.

542
00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.460
<v 2>I put it on it.
Then there's time Jackson and,
and uh,</v>

543
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.370
Keenan Ivory Wayans what are the fuck Keyshawn Johnson,
right.
And I'm like,
oh,

544
00:32:30.371 --> 00:32:33.760
I like those guys.
Those guys used to play,
they know the fucking game and then,

545
00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:37.990
you know,
they got the big pasty doughy boy,

546
00:32:37.991 --> 00:32:41.060
looks like he's in one of those big fucking sitcoms,
right?

547
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.380
Third Rock from the sun where they lived with big foot and alf made like a
cameo.

548
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.960
Whenever the hell is one of those furry fucking shows.
Right.

549
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:52.870
He looks like the dad on one of those shows,
doesn't me.
And um,

550
00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:57.350
that gave you as a check,
you'd be like a milk maid,
you know,

551
00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.290
but he only be like a six.
So anyways,

552
00:33:01.291 --> 00:33:03.980
he goes up there and he's like,

553
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:08.020
<v 1>no,
I did go right.
Laws Dot.
Uh,

554
00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:09.430

555
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.420
We're going to do every day to make sure we get it right.

556
00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:17.110
<v 2>Get it right.
He's in then sports speak,</v>

557
00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.980
and then they cut back to the players and the players,

558
00:33:20.981 --> 00:33:24.960
you know are now fucking wherein Anderson little suits and they're fucking,

559
00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.220

560
00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:30.390
<v 1>go.
You know the Paul g,

562
00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:37.610
All my God.

563
00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:39.660
<v 0>Okay.</v>

564
00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:42.330
<v 2>Is it wrong to say who gives a fuck at this point?</v>

565
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.700
The guy's not going to quit his goddamn job.
You're not going to kick him out.

566
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:53.460
All right?
He gets it next time.
A player slugs,
his wife,

567
00:33:53.461 --> 00:33:54.420
fiance,

568
00:33:54.421 --> 00:33:58.650
or just some random woman walking down the street in,

569
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:59.880
in the face,

570
00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:05.270
they're going to show the whole video the first day and they will suspend the

571
00:34:05.641 --> 00:34:08.540
person indefinitely.
Okay.

572
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:10.731
You know,

573
00:34:10.731 --> 00:34:13.460
it's great to halfway through when I was listening to that sports talk radio

574
00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:13.671
show,

575
00:34:13.671 --> 00:34:18.670
they had al Michaels calling who does not speak in sports speak because uh,

576
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:21.980
you know,
he's found his own voice.
He's a legend.

577
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.580
So he called up and he was just saying how the whole league got tarred and

578
00:34:25.581 --> 00:34:27.230
feathered because of a couple of guys.

579
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:32.380
And he actually claimed that the spousal abuse rate in the NFL not only is less

580
00:34:35.151 --> 00:34:38.810
than general society,
but way less so.

581
00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.390
What was all the screaming and yelling about?

582
00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:46.190
I don't fucking get it all that fuck.
They have a real problem.

583
00:34:46.191 --> 00:34:49.490
They actually looked like they doing a little better doing better than the

584
00:34:49.491 --> 00:34:54.491
plumber's contract is standup comedians and everybody else walking around

585
00:34:55.521 --> 00:35:00.000
outside that stadium,
the new drinking game.

586
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:05.040
Listen to Mike and Mike in the morning and every time Mike goal that goes,

587
00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:09.270
Eh,
in between points you got to take a shot.

588
00:35:09.271 --> 00:35:14.040
I swear to God you're going to have your stomach pumped 45 minutes into it.

589
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:19.400
They came out in the first quarter and I mean they were all over up.

590
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:25.290
Um,
okay.
Is there anything else to talk about here?

591
00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:29.900
And I talked about Roku.
I talked about the games that I watched.

592
00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:34.530
Um,
oh,
double bass drumming by the way.
I'm trying to,
you know,
I made fun of,

593
00:35:34.531 --> 00:35:38.160
I didn't make fun of it.
I just said,
you know,
it's just so fucking,
after a while

594
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.800
<v 1>that I,
I,
I,
you know,</v>

595
00:35:40.801 --> 00:35:45.030
I don't hear a groove anymore and some double bass drum is called,
uh,
told me,

596
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:47.670
update the fucking twittered me.
And they were like,
Eh,
kind of bummed me out.

597
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.770
You said you didn't like the blast beats and shit like that.

598
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.850
I don't mean I don't like them.
I just,
you know,
my,
I don't know,

599
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:58.110
I just don't gravitate towards a already have that level of rage in me.

600
00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:01.290
I don't need a soundtrack to it.
Like I need to go the other way.

601
00:36:01.291 --> 00:36:05.460
I need to listen to the sounds of waterfalls,
you know?
Um,

602
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:07.523
so anyways,

603
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:09.100
<v 0>okay,</v>

604
00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:12.760
<v 1>I want to do another one of those goddamn comedy jam and the sign that I picked</v>

605
00:36:12.761 --> 00:36:15.820
out add a little bit of double basin.
So I've been trying to get,
you know,

606
00:36:15.821 --> 00:36:20.020
I pulled up the double pedal from the fucking back of the closet and,
um,

607
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:25.790
I gotta tell you man,
it fucking,
it's,
it's hard as Shit I've always respected.

608
00:36:25.791 --> 00:36:27.410
That's why I bought it.

609
00:36:27.411 --> 00:36:31.250
Like I bought a double pedal like 12 years ago when my obsession with John

610
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:35.030
Bonham got to the point that all I was doing was listening to led Zeppelin and I

611
00:36:35.031 --> 00:36:39.320
wasn't developing at all any creative ideas,
nothing playing drums.
So it's like,

612
00:36:39.321 --> 00:36:41.390
why don't I get outside of this and get a double pedal?

613
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:46.370
And I fucked around with it on and off and I just never had the discipline to

614
00:36:46.371 --> 00:36:47.031
stay with it.

615
00:36:47.031 --> 00:36:50.080
So I've been trying to stay with it the last couple of weeks and I'm,

616
00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.020
I'm fucking horrible.
I'm horrible.
I mean,

617
00:36:54.021 --> 00:36:57.470
I'm talking like 85 90 beats per minute before it starts sounding like I'm

618
00:36:57.471 --> 00:37:01.580
galloping rather than a nice smooth sound.
So,
uh,
I got,

619
00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.490
I always had a ton of respect.
Um,
oh,
you know what's funny,

620
00:37:04.491 --> 00:37:08.360
I actually opened for a,
went down and did a guest spot in front of Dean del Ray.

621
00:37:08.361 --> 00:37:11.690
At the Improv this week.
And,
uh,
he used to sing in a band,

622
00:37:11.691 --> 00:37:14.120
so he knows all these musicians.

623
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:19.150
And one of the guys that came down out to the show was the drummer from slayer.

624
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:24.290
Dave Lombardo,
I got to talk to him for a couple seconds.
Speaking of,
you know,

625
00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:28.310
legendary drummer,
double bass drum mic,
um,

626
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:33.140
was a great fucking guy.
And um,
I don't know.

627
00:37:33.141 --> 00:37:36.900
It's one of the great things about living out here in la.
He's like,

628
00:37:36.901 --> 00:37:40.050
you'll fucking move somewhere and that guy will be a next door neighbor.

629
00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:41.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

630
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:43.920
<v 1>That there's just people that are in show business out here.</v>

631
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.480
It's fucking hilarious.
Do you know,

632
00:37:45.481 --> 00:37:48.480
I went to a Superbowl party one time and I met somebody and they would just
like,

633
00:37:48.481 --> 00:37:49.314
yeah,

634
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:50.320
<v 0>okay.</v>

635
00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.360
<v 1>Hey.
They started talking to him and I found out his,</v>

636
00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:57.480
his grandfather played the guy that was in the bed with the severed horse head

637
00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.710
in godfather one.
How fucking cool is that?

638
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:04.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

639
00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.010
<v 1>It's like your grandfather did that.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

640
00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:08.860
Do you know he had no idea how big the movie was going to be.

641
00:38:08.861 --> 00:38:11.680
They put a fake head Nordea.
He's screaming,
yelled,

642
00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:18.560
what did your grandfather do?
They worked at Eva's.
Um,
all right,

643
00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:23.080
let's move on.
Okay,
let's get to the lettuce for this week.

644
00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:28.630
The fucking law.
A bill stop saying,

645
00:38:28.631 --> 00:38:31.030
sorry,
dare Billy red face.
I,

646
00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:36.330
I have been listening to your podcast for about a year and are hilarious

647
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.440
<v 2>and I have noticed these fellas spelling with like letters not,</v>

648
00:38:41.441 --> 00:38:46.441
and he just the letter n and I have noticed you say something outrageous and

649
00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:51.100
funny.
Then say sorry.
You're not responsible.

650
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.280
You can say whatever the fuck you want to ends.

651
00:38:54.281 --> 00:38:57.580
And one without apologizing.

652
00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:02.230
Both of those words spelled wrong.
Keep that shit up.
You funny bastard.

653
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:07.270
Thanks for the podcast and go fuck yourself.
Um,

654
00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:11.440
no,
I'm gonna keep saying sorry if I fucking do a joke then think it's a little

655
00:39:11.441 --> 00:39:14.320
corny or a,
he went a little too long with it.
I apologize.

656
00:39:14.321 --> 00:39:15.460
I'm trying to have respect for you,

657
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:19.420
but I appreciate the fact that you enjoy the podcast.
Please keep listening.

658
00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.230
All right.
American who grew up in Singapore.
Oh,

659
00:39:23.231 --> 00:39:26.260
I love it last week than any of you guys have the nerve to go.

660
00:39:26.261 --> 00:39:29.860
Look at that caning video.
Holy Shit yet.

661
00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:31.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

662
00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:35.530
<v 2>That's not something you don't look at it cause you won't ever forget it.
Um,</v>

663
00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:39.580
hey Billy.
I have,
I have lived,
so this is an American who grew up in Singapore.

664
00:39:39.581 --> 00:39:44.080
I've lived in Singapore for five years,
or I lived in Singapore for five years.

665
00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:46.870
In the late eighties through the early nineties I was a kid,

666
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:52.080
but I remember they had public commercials for Caney somewhere like the semi

667
00:39:52.121 --> 00:39:57.070
funny Dui commercials we have in California and somewhere like short film

668
00:39:57.071 --> 00:40:00.430
versions of hot of hostels.
Oh,
of hostile.

669
00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.500
Oh wasn't that a horror movie?

670
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:08.020
They even had billboards and bus signs that depicted offenses that would warn
it.

671
00:40:08.021 --> 00:40:13.021
Warrant caning complete with soar asked cartoon characters.

672
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.110
Caning was even a thing and there's soap operas and TV shows.

673
00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:21.670
The message was clear.
You fuck around and you're going to get caned.

674
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:25.540
The Michael Fay thing happened when I was 11 this is fascinating,

675
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.240
but I remember feeling no sympathy for the guy.

676
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:33.270
I always thought he gave the US a bad name for a being a dumb ass in a foreign

677
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:37.180
country.
And B,
not owning up to his own bullshit.

678
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:42.310
I have no love for Singapore,
but I think their nation points out a sad fact.

679
00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:47.530
The only way you can have a society with less than one murder a year,

680
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.620
no drug offenders with a pristine subway.

681
00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.320
And then he writes in parentheses,

682
00:40:53.321 --> 00:40:58.321
you could literally eat ice cream off the floor is by hanging felons and beating

683
00:40:58.991 --> 00:41:01.750
the shit out of everyone.
I love you.

684
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.820
Oh my God.

685
00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:11.360
Jesus Christ.
Is that true?

686
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:16.600
Can you imagine if they had caning in this country?
How many,

687
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:19.330
how many of us would deserve a caning?

688
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:24.860
How fucking crash you can act and that and that before you get on your fucking

689
00:41:24.861 --> 00:41:27.140
high horse.
Anybody listened to this and Canada,

690
00:41:27.141 --> 00:41:30.740
England and Australia and all the other God damn places.
Okay,

691
00:41:30.741 --> 00:41:34.400
you'd all take a couple of fucking,
you take nice couple of fucking whack.

692
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:37.220
She yourself.
You know,

693
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:40.650
I went to slap my leg and even then I pulled it cause I do pull,

694
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:42.830
pulled the punch because I didn't want to fucking hurt myself.

695
00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:44.453
<v 0>MMM.</v>

696
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:46.111
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

697
00:41:46.111 --> 00:41:50.970
I guess so if you hang felons that really cuts out the whole a recidivism,

698
00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:55.200
you know?
No,
no repeat offenders in Singapore

699
00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:00.220
and they beat it.
Let me tell you something.
They beat the shit out of you.

700
00:42:00.221 --> 00:42:04.150
This guy took like six of them.
Like they,

701
00:42:04.151 --> 00:42:07.010
there's some times like I heard punishments of up to 12 and some people were

702
00:42:07.011 --> 00:42:11.270
saying like other parts of the world,
you get like 96 lashings.

703
00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:15.440
I mean,
you just passed out.

704
00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:19.750
I gotta tell you it is inhumane as it is.

705
00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:23.860
Like let's just say I got,
I,
you know,

706
00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:26.450
I don't want to put this fucking id in anybody's head.

707
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:34.290
I am Jesus Christ.
How many fights?
I mean,
that would be it.
I wouldn't,
I would,

708
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:39.870
I dunno what I would do.
You know what I would do?
I would do,

709
00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:44.630
I would work in the back of a Coldstone creamery.
If I ever took 96 lashings,

710
00:42:44.631 --> 00:42:47.720
that would be it.
That'd be end of my dreams.
All of that would be a broken man.

711
00:42:47.721 --> 00:42:51.290
Like,
all right dude,
I get it.
You're running shit.
Fuck this.

712
00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:54.260
I'm going in the back here.
I'm going to fucking stir up some ice cream.

713
00:42:54.261 --> 00:42:57.860
I'll come out when I got to sing the hi Ho.
Hi Ho.
Well make an ice cream.

714
00:42:57.861 --> 00:43:01.430
We go whatever fucking song I got to sing.
I'm wearing the uniform.

715
00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:03.683
<v 0>You know.</v>

716
00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:07.380
<v 2>Everybody likes to think that there'd be that guy going,
you know,</v>

717
00:43:07.381 --> 00:43:11.220
after they give me a 96 lashes and just sitting there,
you know,

718
00:43:11.221 --> 00:43:14.730
and they come up to you and they say some and then you'd go fuck you and you

719
00:43:14.731 --> 00:43:18.300
spit in their face.
I think that just happens in the movies.

720
00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:21.660
Even if you think in fuck you,
you're not going to say it again.

721
00:43:21.661 --> 00:43:24.200
What is the point of taking more lashes?
At least like,
all right,

722
00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:25.380
I'm going to get this motherfucker later.

723
00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.400
<v 0>Okay.</v>

724
00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:31.420
<v 2>Absolutely sir.
You are the boss.
I got my mind right gum.</v>

725
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.500
I'm like shaking a Bush,
walking it off,
boss,

726
00:43:35.501 --> 00:43:40.180
walking it off.
All right,
bad luck dear Mr. Burn,

727
00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:46.030
what to do when everything goes south for an extended period of time.

728
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:50.320
So I am a 32 year old with quite a good track record,

729
00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.690
former semi pro hockey player,

730
00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:57.720
three university degrees in rather good shape and overall not that ugly and he

731
00:43:58.481 --> 00:44:02.410
got a sense of humor.
You're crushing it.
One sentence in,
I love this guy.

732
00:44:02.411 --> 00:44:07.150
Two sentences is however,
I have had no luck with girls jobs.
Our health.

733
00:44:07.151 --> 00:44:11.740
In the past 10 years,
I have had almost every Dezeen disease known to man.

734
00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:15.220
Okay.
There is a little bit padding in that story.

735
00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:20.290
I have unbelievably bad luck with jobs always.

736
00:44:20.291 --> 00:44:24.310
When I get my dream job,
something from outside comes and stops me getting there.

737
00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:28.690
This has happened three times now and the last one was one of the classics.

738
00:44:28.691 --> 00:44:33.691
The company went to hiring to a hiring and let 25% of the workforce go and

739
00:44:34.591 --> 00:44:39.120
girls,
well,
I could get some,
but I just have no interactions with girls.

740
00:44:39.121 --> 00:44:43.440
With personalities.
I would like,
uh,
they are out there,
but if I meet them,

741
00:44:43.441 --> 00:44:44.610
it does not go anywhere.

742
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:49.920
I love sports and now I have been unable to train for a year and a half due to a

743
00:44:49.921 --> 00:44:54.210
disease,
heart problems plus virus.
Uh,

744
00:44:54.211 --> 00:44:57.570
I am unable to do work.
So there is that.

745
00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:01.200
Even if I would like to get a job,
there was none available.

746
00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:05.040
And I am a cunt working in fa in the finance industry.

747
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:08.310
I am sure I am not the only one to be in this situation.

748
00:45:08.311 --> 00:45:10.890
So my question for you is how do you believe in your future?

749
00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:15.690
If everything's been shit so far,
please go for an account yourself.

750
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:20.550
Yours sincerely.
A ps.
English is not my first language,

751
00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:24.960
so please excuse me.
Well,
that was pretty impressive.
Um,

752
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.790
all right,
so how do you continue?
Uh,

753
00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:31.390
<v 0>okay.</v>

754
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:34.270
<v 2>Thinking positively.
Um,
it's a choice.</v>

755
00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:38.400
You just have to decide to do it.
I mean,
what else are you gonna do?

756
00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:41.110
Are you going to let it win?
He can't let it win.

757
00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:45.820
And everybody who's been successful always has,
you know,

758
00:45:45.821 --> 00:45:47.200
they have all this stories.

759
00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:48.620
<v 0>Okay.</v>

760
00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:52.310
<v 2>When they sit around telling stories about,
you know,</v>

761
00:45:52.311 --> 00:45:53.510
after they've been successful,

762
00:45:53.511 --> 00:45:55.940
all they talk about is the shit that they fucking went through,

763
00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.240
which is most of panel.
If you look,

764
00:45:58.241 --> 00:46:01.550
if you watch a late night talk show of a comic goes on,

765
00:46:01.551 --> 00:46:03.080
he's not going to talk about the time he killed.

766
00:46:03.081 --> 00:46:06.500
He's going to talk about the time he bombed the time of buddy lost his agent at

767
00:46:06.501 --> 00:46:10.340
the time,
his fucking TV show get cancelled.
All the pain of that and all that.

768
00:46:10.341 --> 00:46:14.570
Cause you know,
it's funny,
but the big thing is,

769
00:46:14.571 --> 00:46:16.330
is when you're sitting there watching it go on,

770
00:46:16.331 --> 00:46:19.460
this person went through all of this shit.
So,
uh,

771
00:46:19.461 --> 00:46:22.250
I feel bad that you're going through all this,
especially the health part.

772
00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:23.693
<v 0>MMM.</v>

773
00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:26.630
<v 2>I Dunno what kind of virus she had,
but I mean,</v>

774
00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:29.090
not like if you told me I fucking know anything,
I was still like,

775
00:46:29.091 --> 00:46:30.440
I'm a doctor obviously,
so.

776
00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.353
<v 0>MMM.</v>

777
00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.700
<v 2>What I would do if I was you was,
I would,
I would focus on what you can control.</v>

778
00:46:36.701 --> 00:46:40.000
You can't work out,
but there's nothing stopping you from eating perfectly.

779
00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:44.620
Um,
how about something low impact like yoga,

780
00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:50.340
like I don't ever see where light stretching and eating is perfectly as you

781
00:46:51.971 --> 00:46:55.570
possibly can,
would ever be a detriment to your health.

782
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:59.490
So that would be a step in the positive direction.
And um,

783
00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:01.170
<v 0>okay.</v>

784
00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:04.740
<v 2>As far as like your bad luck with women to fuck that dude.
Fuck that.</v>

785
00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:09.680
There's no such thing.
You just keep,
you just keep getting back.
What,
what,

786
00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:13.680
what is the worst?
They're gonna say no.
Who gives a fuck?

787
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:17.070
They laugh at Shit.
You're already laughing at yourself.
All right?

788
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.460
You just become undeniable.
You become unstoppable.

789
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:24.630
It's just not going to beat you.
All right.
Who knows?

790
00:47:24.631 --> 00:47:26.040
Who knows how long you're going to be here?

791
00:47:26.041 --> 00:47:28.580
Who knows how long I'm going to be here.
But like every issue,

792
00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:31.930
you're fucking living your life day to day.
You can't let it beat you.

793
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:35.440
That's basically it.
And you make that fucking choice.

794
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:41.350
Now get out there the second half,
crushed some ash,

795
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:45.760
do some yoga and eat some goddamn beats.
Um,

796
00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:49.180
yeah,
that's what I would say.
I would just fucking refuse to let this thing,

797
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:54.700
you know,
just do that that fucking day,
day to day thing,
you might win,

798
00:47:54.701 --> 00:47:58.090
but not today.
All right,
I'm tougher than you today.

799
00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:02.470
Go Fuck yourself and I'm gonna join this day.
There you golf.
I would do that.

800
00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:06.720
And uh,
I dunno,
I,
in the end,

801
00:48:06.721 --> 00:48:10.000
if you're going to be around women don't have an angry energy like me that is

802
00:48:10.001 --> 00:48:12.970
like raid to women.
Don't do that.
All right?

803
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:17.050
You attract psychos and uh,
it's just,

804
00:48:17.051 --> 00:48:21.010
it's just not a good situation.
So anyways.
All right.

805
00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:25.360
A hundred days without booze.
Hey,
bill,
ball sack,

806
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:29.560
pill ball,
Saginaw,
parentheses.
I Dunno,
I tried.

807
00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:34.330
All right.
Quickly to the point,
I'm doing a hundred days clean.
I love it.

808
00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:38.350
Inspired by your podcast a while back,
I like the whole deadline thing.

809
00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:42.010
Knowing there's only x more days to go and stuff.
Makes it easier,

810
00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:46.840
makes it easier to do it.
I feel better.
I'm not pissed off as much.
I'm not,

811
00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.540
I'm getting a handle on my money.
This is all good things,

812
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:54.250
which is a lot easier when you're not buying whiskey slash rounds in Brooklyn.

813
00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:58.720
Baas um,
and he further goes on to say,

814
00:48:58.721 --> 00:49:02.260
so thanks for setting a good example on how to keep that shit in check.

815
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:07.120
Only problem is is it's kind of messing up my game or what I thought was my
game,

816
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:12.190
which might've just been getting drunk enough to think of a six was a nine for

817
00:49:12.191 --> 00:49:15.370
the night instead of practicing some patients and self control.

818
00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:19.930
Did you do the 100 days when you were with Nia or did you do even,

819
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:21.970
did you ever do sober stints?
Single?

820
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:25.780
I'm a single dude in my thirties and I'm a writer so I don't have an automatic

821
00:49:25.781 --> 00:49:28.000
social life unless I go out at night.

822
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:32.650
Basically that means up till now I've met all my previous girlfriends at bars or

823
00:49:32.651 --> 00:49:36.940
at shows.
But now I feel like if I'm sober and they're not,

824
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:40.810
then isn't that kind of like taking advantage?
I know exactly what you're saying.

825
00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:41.500
Yeah.

826
00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:46.500
A lack of a Gal's got two plus drinks in her and I'm not in the same rocking

827
00:49:47.171 --> 00:49:47.501
boat.

828
00:49:47.501 --> 00:49:50.950
I'm just standing on the deck watching everyone else swaying back and forth.

829
00:49:50.951 --> 00:49:54.160
It almost seems shady DB picking up gals.
In other words,

830
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:56.230
how the hell do you meet cool chicks?

831
00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:59.350
If you're taking a gentleman interlude from the booze.

832
00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:03.040
I know in the past you've recommended like mixed gendered sports and stuff.

833
00:50:03.041 --> 00:50:06.670
Just wondering if,
uh,
you got any other insights.

834
00:50:06.671 --> 00:50:10.540
Thanks and go,
uh,
not even gonna say it.
Um,

835
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:16.990
all right,
so judging by that you're not athletic because you already know what I

836
00:50:16.991 --> 00:50:20.110
suggested.
So I would,
I would get involved in something else.

837
00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:22.840
Get involved in some of Dude,

838
00:50:22.841 --> 00:50:26.020
if you could somehow cut out booze and bars out of your fucking life at some

839
00:50:26.021 --> 00:50:28.040
point.
It's a great thing.
Get eight hours sleep,

840
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:32.930
you get more shit done and then you start doing,
uh,
you know,
something else.

841
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:37.400
I don't know what,
join a fucking gym.
Join in,
but join like a specific one.
Like,

842
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:39.380
you know,
they got like those rock climbing gyms.

843
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:43.370
It's way more social because it's like a specific thing that everybody's into.

844
00:50:43.371 --> 00:50:47.090
If you just go to the treadmill,
elliptical weight thing,
you know,

845
00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:52.040
then everybody's got their fucking headphones on and shit.
But um,
you know,

846
00:50:52.041 --> 00:50:55.490
if it's something more like a,
like that rock climbing stuff for,
uh,

847
00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.290
I dunno,
riding a bike,
my shit's always physically active.

848
00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:01.790
I don't know what else to do.
I mean,

849
00:51:01.791 --> 00:51:04.430
I don't know what other types of interaction things,
you know,

850
00:51:04.431 --> 00:51:05.420
what the fuck he supposed to do,

851
00:51:05.421 --> 00:51:08.420
but I respect the fact that you don't like hitting on a woman when she's drunk

852
00:51:08.421 --> 00:51:10.100
and you're sober.
Yeah,
I don't like that either.

853
00:51:10.101 --> 00:51:14.420
That feels like some form of sexual assault.
If you end up hooking up with them,

854
00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:17.420
you know,
if they're all over you,
you out.
And I was still was always like,

855
00:51:17.421 --> 00:51:20.810
all right,
well,
you know,
let me know what you think tomorrow.
You know,

856
00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:24.570
after the fucking a hang over there.
All right,
there boozy.

857
00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:31.660
Um,
I should fucking take a day off man.

858
00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:37.060
I fucking drank it up yesterday,
last night,
ended up eating off of food truck,

859
00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:41.680
got a super fucking deluxe Burrito,
whatever the hell you call it.

860
00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:47.260
Horrific.
And I'm paying for it today.
All God Damn Day.
No energy.

861
00:51:47.261 --> 00:51:51.190
If stupid fucking stupid,
why can't I stop?

862
00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:56.620
Maybe I should join that rock climbing gym.

867

I'm a big fan and an even bigger booze hound.

919
00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:37.200
I'm a 47 year old boozer with a good job successfully raising my two young

920
00:55:37.201 --> 00:55:41.340
daughters myself.
You recently went on a run of sobriety that I admire.

921
00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:45.330
Can you talk more on your fucking epic podcast?
Thank you.

922
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:48.930
About how you did it and what types of foods you ate to help you replace the

923
00:55:48.931 --> 00:55:53.910
sugar that your body mist without the sweet mother's milk of vodka.

924
00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:56.580
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
Yeah,
dude,
you're addicted.

925
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:59.490
You're addicted to sugar.

926
00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:03.780
Like most people like myself or whatever.
So,
um,

927
00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:08.610
what I found with food is it's really all about that first night,

928
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:10.111
you know,

929
00:56:10.111 --> 00:56:14.130
if he can eat well all day on the first day you diet and right around four

930
00:56:14.131 --> 00:56:15.810
o'clock,
five o'clock in the afternoon,

931
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:18.780
you're body starts craving the shit food that you've been eating.

932
00:56:18.781 --> 00:56:20.510
Either something salty or sugary or anything.

933
00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:22.890
If he can just fucking push through that,

934
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.090
<v 1>you know,
drink plenty of water,
not a dangerous level of water.</v>

935
00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:31.720
Don't fucking make the walls of yourselves fucking not even exist anymore.

936
00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:33.040
Is that what happens when you can lean in,

937
00:56:33.041 --> 00:56:35.920
literally die from drinking too much water?
Just drink water,

938
00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:40.090
big salad with a protein and then just make yourself go to bed,

939
00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:44.740
that white knuckle it the first night and then your body starts to get used to

940
00:56:44.741 --> 00:56:49.030
that.
And after doing that for three days,
you on a nice track and

941
00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:51.850
<v 3>okay</v>

942
00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:56.080
<v 1>to help you along if you get that.
Um,
Hey Nia,
what is it?</v>

943
00:56:56.081 --> 00:57:00.100
Dark chocolate.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you get that dark chocolate,

944
00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:04.900
um,
it's weird.
Like,
he just seemed like a little corner of it.

945
00:57:05.410 --> 00:57:09.610
It feels way more dense than like milk chocolate,
but it's not nearly as sugary.

946
00:57:09.611 --> 00:57:10.900
I don't even know if there's any sugar in it,

947
00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:15.760
but it kind of keeps that sugar thing at bay.

948
00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.180
And that's kind of a way you can kind of cheat your way through it.

949
00:57:19.181 --> 00:57:23.200
But what's cool about your bodies if you actually feed it healthy food,

950
00:57:23.201 --> 00:57:24.370
it craves healthy food.

951
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:28.330
Like you'll actually get psyched for a salad with some chicken on it or some

952
00:57:28.331 --> 00:57:31.870
shit.
Believe it or not.
I never thought it was gonna be possible.
But I would say,

953
00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:35.580
you know,
you've gotta be careful with the,
obviously with the salad dressings,

954
00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:39.850
you know,
um,
and people always say when they talk about calories and shit,

955
00:57:39.851 --> 00:57:43.990
the low,
say like,
you might as well have had a big Mac.
I 100% disagree with that.

956
00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:47.800
Um,
it might,
even if the kid caloric intake is equal,

957
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:51.100
there's nothing worse than a fucking big Mac because at the end of the day,

958
00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:56.130
if you had a giant fucking salad with a ton of calorie dressing on top of it,

959
00:57:56.171 --> 00:58:00.280
you still ate a fucking salad.
Where have a big Mac.
You just ate a big Mac.

960
00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:03.370
All right.
And fuck all,
you know,

961
00:58:03.371 --> 00:58:07.000
net con personal trainers who are now going to question that.

962
00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:08.260
I that makes sense to me.

963
00:58:08.261 --> 00:58:13.150
And I don't give a shit about your degree and fucking salad dressing.
Um,

964
00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:16.900
yeah,
so just white knuckle it for the first three.
I need to do that.

965
00:58:16.901 --> 00:58:18.340
Like I'm trying to get back into working out.

966
00:58:18.341 --> 00:58:21.670
I've been so fucking busy and I'm forcing myself to go downstairs

967
00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.070
cause my body is saying I don't want to do it.
I don't want to do it.

968
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:28.100
You drank last night,
he ate that shit food,

969
00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:29.970
let's fucking relax and eat more shit food.

970
00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:33.060
And I'm just going to force myself to go down there and all I gotta do is that

971
00:58:33.061 --> 00:58:36.960
first set of pushups.
The blood gets going and then the body's like,
yeah,
yeah,

972
00:58:36.961 --> 00:58:38.610
I want to do this,
I want to do this.
And then,
you know,

973
00:58:38.611 --> 00:58:43.320
half hour later like thank God I did this and it's fucking over.
So,
uh,

974
00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:45.480
another great thing,
especially a guy your age,

975
00:58:45.481 --> 00:58:47.520
your almost your little a year older than me,

976
00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:52.080
take a fucking walk at night a take a fucking walk.
I'm telling you,

977
00:58:52.110 --> 00:58:57.000
just walk around the block at a nice leisurely pace,
you know,

978
00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:59.610
put it on your Walkman or whatever the fuck he listened to.
Now,

979
00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:03.480
whatever the hell you call it,
your phone,
your transistor radio,

980
00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:07.230
listen to some music,
walk around the block.
Um,

981
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.680
<v 3>yeah,</v>

982
00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:12.040
<v 1>it's great.
You're burned cat little calories.
You're not beating on your joints.</v>

983
00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:13.900
You know your burn like a hundred,

984
00:59:13.901 --> 00:59:16.450
200 calories just walking around the block right before he go to bed.

985
00:59:16.451 --> 00:59:20.740
Nice big glass of fucking water.
Go to bed and then start your day.

986
00:59:20.741 --> 00:59:25.010
I'd like fucking oatmeal with bananas and raising in it.
No milk,

987
00:59:25.011 --> 00:59:28.310
no brown sugar,
none of that shit that's going to send your body back,

988
00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:32.000
get you back on this smack.
Fuck that big lump of shit that's good for you.

989
00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.490
Sits right in your belly.
It fills you up.

990
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:37.820
Have a fucking apple for a snack and then,
I don't know,

991
00:59:37.821 --> 00:59:40.220
peanut butter and jelly sandwich or a Turkey sandwich,

992
00:59:40.221 --> 00:59:42.320
lean Turkey sandwich and you're on your way,

993
00:59:42.321 --> 00:59:45.400
and then you're all the way to four o'clock.
Then I got to do,

994
00:59:45.401 --> 00:59:48.230
it's a salad and the protein and just shoved that shit.

995
00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:51.320
Sometimes I'll do the salad at lunch just to get it out of the fucking way.

996
00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:55.610
He's got to get it all away.
Just fucking do that.
And it's the end of the night.

997
00:59:55.611 --> 00:59:58.400
Again,
drink a giant thing of water.
Take another fucking walk,

998
00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:02.360
and then your body's just enter that and then you'll drop weight.

999
01:00:02.361 --> 01:00:06.560
And then the hardest fucking thing is once your body gets used to that and you

1000
01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:11.240
get bored of that Shit,
Oh,
you start lying to yourself like,
hey,

1001
01:00:11.241 --> 01:00:13.140
I could have a big Mac.
I've been doing,
I've been,
now,
you know,

1002
01:00:13.141 --> 01:00:16.380
I'm gonna treat myself.
I've been doing well and you're basically,
I've tried,

1003
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:20.930
you're treating yourself to the heroin again and it's going to be in you for

1004
01:00:20.931 --> 01:00:24.710
three days and you've gotta be really careful after you eat like shit for the

1005
01:00:24.711 --> 01:00:28.430
next three days because there's that demon is back in.
You go and get,

1006
01:00:28.431 --> 01:00:30.680
get a pizza that get some ice cream,
but blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1007
01:00:30.681 --> 01:00:35.100
I'm telling you that at least that's how my body works.
Um,
anyway,

1008
01:00:35.101 --> 01:00:37.630
so good luck man.
You're making some smart choices there.
Alright,

1009
01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:39.290
threesome problems.

1010
01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:44.840
<v 2>Oh God.
I want this guy's life is fucking great threesome.
Hey Nia,</v>

1011
01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:46.130
you want to come in for this one?

1012
01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.160
<v 1>Neato</v>

1013
01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:57.030
<v 2>while you were all stuffy.
Come on.
That'll be funny.
Next week.
Okay.</v>

1014
01:00:57.830 --> 01:01:01.980
All right,
three some problems.
Greetings Billy boy,
longtime listener,

1015
01:01:01.981 --> 01:01:06.000
first time caller question mark.
As they used to say,

1016
01:01:06.001 --> 01:01:10.260
I realize many,
if not most guys would love to have my problems,
but nonetheless,

1017
01:01:10.261 --> 01:01:11.550
it's caused me some headaches.

1018
01:01:11.551 --> 01:01:15.240
So I thought I'd ask an asshole like you for his 2 cents.
Well,

1019
01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:19.480
you've come to the right place if you're looking for an a hole.
My wife of years.

1020
01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:25.570
It's very much by sexual and we have brought other women into our relationship

1021
01:01:25.571 --> 01:01:26.790
since we started dating.

1022
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:30.070
<v 1>All right,
so,
okay.</v>

1023
01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:32.130
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1024
01:01:32.130 --> 01:01:33.810
<v 1>Is that still technically a marriage?</v>

1025
01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:37.450
I'm not trying to be approved here but like um,

1026
01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:39.120
<v 0>okay.</v>

1027
01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:42.460
<v 1>All right,
so you guys are like friends.</v>

1028
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.080
It's fucking great.

1029
01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:52.250
<v 2>This is great.
This fucking guy.
How the fuck did you pull this off?
Nah,</v>

1030
01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:54.680
not like we,
I guess cause his wife's bisexual anyways.

1031
01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.340
Not like we do this every Friday night but since we are both very sexual people

1032
01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.550
and the fact that she has no interest in screwing another dude,

1033
01:02:02.551 --> 01:02:07.260
it's just a win win.
Yeah.
You mother fucker.
What it,
what,
what is your problem?
He,

1034
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:12.360
you taken up valuable time on this podcast for other people actually have

1035
01:02:12.361 --> 01:02:17.130
problems.
It goes here is the rub,
the so to speak.
Nudge,
nudge,
wink,
wink.

1036
01:02:17.490 --> 01:02:22.490
Most of the girls have been hookups more or less and that neither of us had any

1037
01:02:23.641 --> 01:02:26.250
real emotional attachment to them.
Yeah,
you got it.

1038
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.900
I would think you'd have to do it that way.

1039
01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:31.770
What are you going to bang your neighbor and then have to see her for the rest

1040
01:02:31.771 --> 01:02:34.600
of the time you lay aria at the time.
Like Dental Joe.

1041
01:02:35.770 --> 01:02:39.030
Then my wife was doing that other thing too.
You know,

1042
01:02:39.031 --> 01:02:41.440
we don't want to do it again.
We just wanted to do it.
Do you want

1043
01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:47.670
have a nice day?
I for a while.
That sounds crass.

1044
01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:51.960
All three,
sometimes even four.
One,
five,

1045
01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:56.070
five at once.
All of us were consulting adults,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1046
01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:59.130
How did you have a,
a two,
one five.

1047
01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.520
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1048
01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.560
<v 2>Did you go?
You must,
you guys must be swingers.</v>

1049
01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:08.190
Where'd you go down to the why we got,
we got next.
We've got next

1050
01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:14.430
standing outside an orgy.
Um,
anyways,
he said,

1051
01:03:14.431 --> 01:03:18.840
but there is one good friend of my wife that is found her way into our bed off

1052
01:03:18.841 --> 01:03:20.520
and on for a few years now.

1053
01:03:20.521 --> 01:03:24.720
Usually after all of us have had one too many cocktails.
Yeah,
Dude.

1054
01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:29.730
All right.
Yeah,
you're dancing with the devil here again.
So far so good.

1055
01:03:29.731 --> 01:03:34.080
Except that this lady,
let's call her Jenny Jannie.

1056
01:03:34.081 --> 01:03:36.150
I got your number.

1057
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.020
You want to Bang my wife?
Um,

1058
01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:41.700
<v 3>okay.</v>

1059
01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:44.250
<v 2>So far so good.
It's just,
okay.
We'll call her.</v>

1060
01:03:44.251 --> 01:03:49.251
Jenny is just as into each of us personally as she is into us as a couple.

1061
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:54.450
That is,
she is down to screw each one of us individually.

1062
01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:59.430
Now this person right here is the real winner in all of this because you know

1063
01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.350
she's not in a relationship this first.

1064
01:04:01.351 --> 01:04:04.920
She's the one getting her cake and eating it.
She has nothing to fucking loose.

1065
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.520
Um,
anyways,
she says,
well,

1066
01:04:09.521 --> 01:04:13.150
my wife was away on business.
Ah,

1067
01:04:13.151 --> 01:04:17.260
I gave in and did the Dade.
Jenny insists that a,

1068
01:04:17.261 --> 01:04:20.140
my wife would not consider this cheating and B,

1069
01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:24.400
even if she did she that is Jenny would never tell her.

1070
01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:27.580
Part of the problem is that,
like I mentioned,

1071
01:04:27.581 --> 01:04:32.350
my wife has zero interest in other dudes and being the ex Frat guy that I am,

1072
01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:38.040
I really would not be jealous if she informed me that she slept with a girl

1073
01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:42.220
while on a business trip.
But at the same time,

1074
01:04:42.221 --> 01:04:46.780
my gut is telling me she'd be very angry and very hurt if she learned that I

1075
01:04:46.781 --> 01:04:51.310
slept with Jenny.
One or one on one in our absence.
Jenny,

1076
01:04:51.311 --> 01:04:54.910
I have had sex three times in my wife's absence.
Yeah,
dude,

1077
01:04:54.911 --> 01:04:56.350
you're kind of having an affair right now.

1078
01:04:57.100 --> 01:05:02.100
I feel like I am about the absolute limit at which I can admit all to my wife.

1079
01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:05.530
That is after four,
five,
six,
eight,
12,

1080
01:05:05.531 --> 01:05:10.000
whatever times it is no longer a new problem and it's simply an affair.

1081
01:05:10.001 --> 01:05:14.590
Should I just come clean now considering that this is not exactly your run of

1082
01:05:14.591 --> 01:05:18.070
the mill affair.
Thanks my man.
Um,

1083
01:05:19.610 --> 01:05:23.570
I dunno dude.
I would,
I would immediately stop banging Jenny on the side.

1084
01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.940
Um,
you know what dude,

1085
01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:32.780
you're relationship is a complex to say the least and uh,

1086
01:05:33.591 --> 01:05:35.510
there's going to be some security issues.

1087
01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:39.710
There's going to be some breaches in security.
So you had a breach in security.

1088
01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:42.470
She's not going to say anything.
You don't say anything.
You know,

1089
01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:47.150
you basically fuck this woman that your wife has fucked.
She just wasn't there.

1090
01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:51.790
So I don't know what that is.
Uh,
that sounds like a a,

1091
01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:55.040
that sounds like offsetting penalties.
No,
not really.

1092
01:05:55.041 --> 01:05:57.430
Cause you cause your wife is the other team.
Um,

1093
01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:03.790
I dunno for,
I,
I would,

1094
01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:06.870
I would stop banging her and you did it three fucking times.

1095
01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.840
I Dunno if you want to say that.
That's your call.
If you want to say something,

1096
01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:10.674
say something.

1097
01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:15.210
You know that's going to be a shitstorm and your wife is probably going to think

1098
01:06:15.211 --> 01:06:18.970
you know there are vengeful,
uh,
sex.

1099
01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:22.810
So do the math on that one.
If she's going to get you back.

1100
01:06:22.811 --> 01:06:27.190
I don't think she's getting with Jenny.
She's getting with Lenny.

1101
01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:32.220
Oh sorry.
Apologize.
Apologize for the Pun.

1102
01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:37.360
Arm.
Is that upon?
I don't know what it is.
Um,
so there you go.
That is the,
uh,

1103
01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:42.070
that's the podcast for this week.
Everybody,
uh,
j e t s Jess jets,

1104
01:06:42.071 --> 01:06:44.890
jets tonight playing.
I don't know who,
I don't know who,
I don't know what,

1105
01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:46.270
I haven't watched him yet this year,

1106
01:06:46.271 --> 01:06:50.200
but I am predicting the New England patriots are going to go 500 against the

1107
01:06:50.201 --> 01:06:53.170
jets,
500 against the bills,
500 against the dolphins.

1108
01:06:53.171 --> 01:06:56.620
Maybe we'll be one of them twice.
Um,

1109
01:06:58.110 --> 01:07:00.330
I think all three of them might've got a little better.

1110
01:07:00.331 --> 01:07:04.920
And I just think that we get a little worse.
I Dunno.

1111
01:07:05.070 --> 01:07:07.380
I just a,
there's just something about it.
I don't know,

1112
01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.410
letting the Raiders hang around that long.
The Raiders,

1113
01:07:11.730 --> 01:07:15.300
no disrespect to the greatest fucking emblem and all sports,

1114
01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:20.310
but they are what they are and have been what they've been for this fucking
long.

1115
01:07:20.311 --> 01:07:23.200
So I don't know what to tell you.
Um,
anyways,

1116
01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:24.540
other than I'm looking forward to it.

1117
01:07:24.570 --> 01:07:28.890
I'm trying not to be a cunt this year and a rooting against teams and all that

1118
01:07:28.891 --> 01:07:30.720
shit.
It really kills a lot of my enjoyment of it.

1119
01:07:30.721 --> 01:07:34.140
I know it's funny for you guys in that type of shit,
but I'm just really busy.

1120
01:07:34.141 --> 01:07:37.620
I don't know.
I don't have time to fucking hate this year.
Uh,
that's it.

1121
01:07:37.621 --> 01:07:39.720
I'm just hoping it's going to be a good game.
How do you like that?

1122
01:07:39.721 --> 01:07:42.600
That was even handed.
All right.
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.
