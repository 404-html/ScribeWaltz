00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.790
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:07.260
Is Bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,
Monday,

3
00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:11.010
December 4th,
2000 and fucking

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.340
17.
Yeah,
there we go.

5
00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:18.750
I just realized I just gave a fuck and just gave dean Delray a check and I wrote

6
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.600
December 5th on it.
I thought tomorrow was December 5th.

7
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.980
Well it is by the time you hear this,
but I did the Sunday night.
NAF.
Fuck it.

8
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.080
Tell him not to deposit the check.
Well they can.
You can still deposit it right?

9
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:35.140
And then they don't fucking whatever a del Ray opened for me this weekend.

10
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.690
Holy Shit.
We got the levels up too high here.
They are too high.

11
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.100
I can't hear myself thinking here.
For God sakes.

12
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:48.870
Could you just shut it down please.
Thank you.
Um,

13
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.200
dude,
I'm fucking sitting there wanting to,

14
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.880
and I'm sitting there minding my own business in my house,
my fucking house.

15
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.510
Fuck you bankers.
It's mine now until I die.
Then you get it back.

16
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:05.310
Don't you get cuts?
Um,
they just sit there waiting.

17
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.950
It would pay off your house.
Look out your window.

18
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:10.080
There'll be a banker sitting out there like a fucking,

19
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.990
like a Goddamn vulture waiting for you to fucking,
I'll get,

20
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:16.320
let them looking at me eating bacon.
I guess Bacon's good for you now.

21
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.210
I don't know what the fuck.
I don't know what I know what I'm talking about.
Um,

22
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.530
anyways,
um,
I wonder what room I'm going to die in this house here.

23
00:01:26.531 --> 00:01:30.000
But think about that when you just get the house,
like I'm not fucking leaving.

24
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.540
I'm staying here.
Right.
And then you just,
when you,
once you make that decision,

25
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:35.820
you're like,
well then I'm going to fucking die in here.

26
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.520
What room is it going to be?
I think a lot of people die at breakfast nooks.

27
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.460
You know,
just sitting down and having some toast.

28
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.660
Read the morning paper.
That wouldn't be a bad way to go.

29
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.470
Let's go face down until like fucking half piece of grapefruit.
But

30
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.410
what were on would you want to die in?
You don't want to do it in the shower,

31
00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:01.530
right?
That's fucking awful.
And you're all waterlogged,
you know,

32
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:05.100
Bang your head on.
The fucking lot of people die in the shower.

33
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:09.750
They slip and fall,
you know,
and they can't get up right.

34
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:12.990
And that's why they came out with dead fucking that thing there for all the old

35
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:13.824
people.

36
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.610
But what a lot of people don't realize is a lot of them fall in the fucking

37
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:20.070
shower and then they go to use their little,

38
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.620
I've fallen and I can't get up thing and then they get electrocuted.

39
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.030
I don't think that happens,
but I would be worried about that.

40
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.250
Trying to drag my old prude ass out of the fucking tub.

41
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.220
Oh my God.
That's gotta be the worst when he gets so old.

42
00:02:37.221 --> 00:02:41.380
You're afraid to take a shower.
You got to bring like a fucking lazy boy.

43
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.390
Oh Shit.
I'm sorry.
They just fucking struck me.
He's funny.

44
00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:56.190
He just got a giant lazy,
we got a recliner in your shower.
It's an hour.

45
00:02:56.191 --> 00:02:59.560
It's waterproof.
I don't know the fuck you.
I liked.

46
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:03.730
I loved that flashlight that just came out that that runs on water.
I mean,

47
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:07.390
giving you,
what are we doing?
What the fuck are we doing in the Middle East?

48
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:10.930
Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.
Just put that in a fucking car.

49
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:13.660
Stick 20 olds flashlights in the car,
I'll drive slower.

50
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.010
It's just get out of there already,
right?
The fuck we think we're doing.

51
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.020
You know what?
Fuck.
The Middle East is like,

52
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:24.130
my lease is like ear a civilian and you get in the middle of like a domestic

53
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:28.000
violence fucking incident,
you know,
and you try to break it up,

54
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.240
you know,
and the second he'd go to break it up,

55
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:35.020
the woman starts beating on you and get off my abusive husband.

56
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.850
That's what it's like over there.
Just fucking get those water flashlights.

57
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.771
This is what you do.

58
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:46.210
You get those water flashlights and you put them into fucking Scotus that

59
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:49.570
everybody has to ride his scooter,
whether you're fat or old or whatever.

60
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:52.480
You got to ride one in cars or illegal.
All right?

61
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:54.980
The amount of people wipe it out and dying bride,

62
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.640
it frees up the fucking traffic.

63
00:03:57.641 --> 00:04:00.250
We're not using as much oil and then they go bankrupt over there.

64
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.660
How about that there?

65
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:04.510
Did I solve the Middle Eastern Obama's don't we do that every week?
Every week?

66
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:08.930
I'm gonna have a new fucking solution for the Middle East.
Um,

67
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.830
anyway,
I don't want the fuck I'm talking about.
I just,

68
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.840
can you imagine just having a giant fucking recliner,
you know,

69
00:04:15.841 --> 00:04:16.750
and then you have like debt,

70
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:19.990
little grabby thing and you just turn on the fucking water.

71
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.810
What are those grabby things?
You know,
you fucking,
you,

72
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.790
you pull the handle and then you got an x,
like the fucking groceries.

73
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.150
They always grab like a can of soup or some shit.
Yeah.

74
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.610
What breeding from Broccoli whenever they go up there and they fucking Yank it

75
00:04:35.611 --> 00:04:39.690
down.
I don't know that,
that doesn't happen anymore.
There's no,

76
00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:43.410
there's no regular person running a fucking grocery store anymore.
Is there?

77
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.810
Yeah.
Grocery stores are fucking weird man.
Dot.

78
00:04:47.811 --> 00:04:50.140
They could kind of like the food version of a casino.

79
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.410
Like you just feel like there's somebody up in the ceiling watching you buying

80
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:56.530
like a two way mirror when you go in there,

81
00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.670
it's really nothing stopped.
But yeah,

82
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:02.910
I mean one time I walked into this grocery store with Patrice and we acted like

83
00:05:02.911 --> 00:05:07.510
fucking children.
He got me going like,
he was so fucking silly.

84
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:09.270
I'm at one time,
he just goes,
uh,

85
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.990
we were going and he was staying at my apartment for pilot season.

86
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.620
Both of us creeps trying to get on must see TV.
Yeah.

87
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.630
How do you think that worked out?
So,

88
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.913
um,

89
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.450
we were in like Ralph's or some shit and he just kept going a pill.

90
00:05:27.451 --> 00:05:31.500
You want some of these?
And when he would go to point at it,
he would like,

91
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.560
he'd have his hand way too close to the bag and he was like bread or something.

92
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.330
He goes,
Bill,
you need some of this.
And he was,

93
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.500
he would just push his finger into like fucking three slices of bread through

94
00:05:43.501 --> 00:05:44.334
the rapper.

95
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.870
And he just started doing that around the grocery store and I was fucking
crying,

96
00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:52.140
laughing.
He did it.
The cookies he was doing,

97
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.880
he was doing it to fruit and these giant fucking fingers,
they bill you.
Why?

98
00:05:56.881 --> 00:05:57.330
One of the easy,

99
00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.330
just like all the way through the fucking thing and I'm immature is fuck.

100
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.280
And it was just making me fucking cry,
laugh.

101
00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:08.540
And he's a comedian so he just kept doing it.
And I was trying to do it.

102
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:12.470
I could even,
you know,
my fingers weren't,
I don't know.
I was laughing too hard.

103
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:17.180
I couldn't fucking do it as good as him.
Um,
anyways,
Jesus.

104
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.690
I hadn't thought about that for fucking ever and I want to apologize.

105
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.350
Maybe it wasn't Ralph's.
What the fuck?
Where are we?
I always hated rouse,

106
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.570
you know,
it's just a fucking pain in the ass.
The one that was down the street.

107
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.570
I used to live off as sunset and it was a Ralphs.

108
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.840
They used to be called rock and roll.
Ralph's.
Everything was rock and roll.

109
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:40.400
Denny's rock and roll.
Ralph's steps back like leftover from the hair metal shit.

110
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.480
You know the rock and roll Hyatt right next to fucking the comedy storm.

111
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.750
John Bonham used to ride motorcycles.
There's some shit into the fucking thing.

112
00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:51.584
I don't know what.

113
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:53.723
<v 0>MMM,</v>

114
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.170
<v 1>I have no idea.
I don't know what the fuck it was.
I even know where we were at.</v>

115
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.403
Um,

116
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.110
<v 0>okay.</v>

117
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.110
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
I have decided that in Fred.
What the fuck was they talking about?</v>

118
00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:05.160
It's talking about being an old man,

119
00:07:05.161 --> 00:07:07.140
but there were cleaner and a God damn shower,

120
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.740
whatever that moment is come and gone.
That's what happens on the podcast.

121
00:07:10.741 --> 00:07:14.580
I just fucking talk and whatever happens,
it happens.
By the way,

122
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.540
I would like to thank everybody that came out to Albuquerque,

123
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.740
New Mexico.
I had a great fucking time at route 66 casino.

124
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.630
That's the second time I played there.

125
00:07:26.631 --> 00:07:31.190
I fucking love that place to crab was awesome.
And then the next,
uh,

126
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.750
the next last night I played in Tucson,
Arizona.
Another great time.

127
00:07:34.751 --> 00:07:38.450
Just fucking great people,
great parts of the country,
uh,

128
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.870
fun fucking crowds.
And um,

129
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.740
I got to tell you that I'm acting like a fucking idiot on stage.
Like yet.

130
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.560
I think it's my reaction to this fucking,
this,

131
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.220
this weird fog that is starting to roll in slowly rolling in over the last five

132
00:07:54.261 --> 00:07:58.070
years on standup comedy where all of a sudden I sit there on stage and sometimes

133
00:07:58.071 --> 00:08:00.710
I think after I say something like,
did somebody record that?

134
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.050
Am I going to get into trouble?
I even thought,

135
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:06.140
I never thought that the first fucking 20 years of my career in the last five

136
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:10.850
years,
it just keeps creeping into my head.
And in order to beat it down,
I,
I,

137
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:12.240
<v 0>okay.</v>

138
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.320
<v 1>I Dunno.
I think I'm going a little harder.
Somebody scared.</v>

139
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.140
There's gotta be some sort of pushback on this fucking vibe that's out there,

140
00:08:19.141 --> 00:08:23.970
that everything is so God damn serious.
Now Jesus fucking Christ.

141
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.040
Couple guys want to be women.

142
00:08:26.041 --> 00:08:29.010
A couple of guys take their dicks out at work and then all of a sudden

143
00:08:29.011 --> 00:08:32.850
everybody's got to look.
Whew.
How did he mean that joke?

144
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.200
Is that a joke or is that legislation for a new law?

145
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.130
Like this whole fucking vibe that's out there.
It's,
it's,
it's really weird

146
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.860
and fucking young people are acting like old people.

147
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.180
<v 0>Okay.</v>

148
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:47.780
<v 1>You know?</v>

149
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.780
And I think that's because they're on social media and all that shit and they're

150
00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:53.720
just watching this stuff.
24 seven.
It's like fucking,

151
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:56.270
I dunno.

152
00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:57.730
<v 0>Okay.</v>

153
00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.550
<v 1>It's fucking up their brains,
man.
C'Mon millennials could get,</v>

154
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.580
got to do something that spoil you.
Supposed to make me uncomfortable.

155
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.360
<v 3>Origin,
mural,
jack crunch.
Why?
And I go and,
you know,</v>

156
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:09.520
<v 0>yeah,</v>

157
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.370
<v 1>I guess they have that new documentary,
Meth town on fucking,
uh,</v>

158
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.830
Hbo d Delray told me to wash it.
I can't fucking watch that shit.

159
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.060
I'm not going to watch a bunch of toothless fucking pee.

160
00:09:20.061 --> 00:09:21.730
But those God damn people,
I swear to God,

161
00:09:21.731 --> 00:09:25.580
they look like they're from the 18 hundreds.
So bad.

162
00:09:25.581 --> 00:09:28.190
They fucked their faces up with that meth shit.

163
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.350
I'll tell you,
once you lose your fucking teeth,
he,
you look like you're 80.

164
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:35.490
I don't care how old you are.

165
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:39.960
You could take one of those gorgeous Victoria secret models.
They,

166
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:43.980
if they don't have any fucking teeth and they didn't get a partial or a fucking

167
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.810
implant or whatever the fuck you call them

168
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.980
dentures as some shit.
If you just walk around toothless,
you immediately look,

169
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.640
you look like homer Simpson's fucking that guy that falls asleep.

170
00:09:55.641 --> 00:09:59.270
His Dad is it his dad?
Um,

171
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.690
their grandfather,
right?
I don't know.
Yeah.
So I had that on.

172
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.970
I was talking to someone on the phone and,
and dean kept telling me,

173
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.360
what you got to see it,
dude,
you got to see.
And even dean said,
man,

174
00:10:10.361 --> 00:10:13.540
I fucking shut this thing off like three times.
He goes,
it's fucking brutal.

175
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.650
So I just had the sound down and I was watching all these toothless fucking

176
00:10:17.651 --> 00:10:20.500
people with these crazy looks on their faces.

177
00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:22.690
And uh,

178
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:28.370
I was on the phone and at one point I just saw somebody kicking dog shit like

179
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.420
piles of dog shit,
different piles all around the house,

180
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:37.690
like hoarding dog shit out of the way in this person's house with newspaper all

181
00:10:37.941 --> 00:10:42.250
over it and stuff.
And um,
that's when I turned the channel.

182
00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.870
I don't know about you guys,
but I drew the line at the,
uh,

183
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.750
I drew the line at the dog.
Shit,

184
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.960
there's a few things that make me turn the channel.
Okay.

185
00:10:52.961 --> 00:10:56.560
Drug addicts would dog shit in their house and,

186
00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:01.270
and strong female characters make me turn the channel.

187
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.110
And not because I have anything against a strong female character.

188
00:11:05.111 --> 00:11:06.790
It's just that they don't develop them.

189
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.810
I think everybody in Hollywood is so afraid of getting yelled at by these

190
00:11:10.811 --> 00:11:14.200
women's groups that they just throw in these strong female characters,

191
00:11:14.201 --> 00:11:16.720
but they don't,
they don't make a three dimensional character.

192
00:11:16.721 --> 00:11:21.370
They just have a woman yelling at guys and grabbing them by their fucking lapels

193
00:11:21.371 --> 00:11:23.710
of this suit and throw them over couches and shit.

194
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.710
It's like they took like leftovers,
Steven Seagal Shit,

195
00:11:26.711 --> 00:11:28.270
and the guy will give it to the woman here.

196
00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:33.271
See she Straub all of a sudden every fucking gia dick and balls

197
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.810
to psych with this fucking Parson sky outweighs it by like a fucking hundred

198
00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:45.540
pounds.
What am I,
what am I watching?
I want you to it.

199
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.100
Recently,
I might even say the fucking show,
but I'm watching this guy,

200
00:11:48.101 --> 00:11:50.050
this guy's like 40 fucking years old.

201
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.280
He's talking to a 19 year old redneck woman who lives to a fucking lake in the

202
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:56.950
middle of the Arkansas and she's having a battle of wits with them and she's

203
00:11:56.951 --> 00:12:00.310
winning my Jesus fucking Christ.

204
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.441
The Fun.

205
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:07.441
What kind of a fucking 19 year old can beat a fucking 50 year old guy in a

206
00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:12.250
battle of wits.
And wants to talking about fucking Nintendo or whatever.

207
00:12:12.251 --> 00:12:15.040
The fucking kids playing in the tendo.
Sorry.
Whenever you guys play.

208
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:21.910
Um,
I'm not a Gamer.
All right.
I used to be a booze hound.

209
00:12:21.911 --> 00:12:24.640
I'm still not drinking the fuck is it?

210
00:12:24.641 --> 00:12:27.790
It's a one of my a hundred and some days in at this point.

211
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.420
It's one oh five days,
three days.
Anna.
It's one oh eight.

212
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.250
We went oh nine by the time he listened to this thing.

213
00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:36.790
But I gotta tell you I'm fucking,
I'm getting weak.

214
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.090
I'm getting a week or the holidays,
a role in it.

215
00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:42.160
I think I'll be good through December,
but uh,

216
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:47.370
I'm going to the fucking Rosebowl again this year.
This is my 10th Rose Ball.

217
00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.420
All right.
It's the 10 anniversary for me and Joe Barton.

218
00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:53.530
Nick the originals,

219
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.480
the original fucking drunk maniacs at that game.

220
00:12:58.481 --> 00:13:03.250
And what's so fucking awesome now about the college football playoff is that

221
00:13:03.251 --> 00:13:06.310
every three years now,
the Rose Bowl is a playoff game.

222
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.220
Last time it was a Florida state and Oregon,
I believe,

223
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.530
a Jamison Winston.
And,
uh,
the guy from fucking a Tennessee,
Tyson's,

224
00:13:14.531 --> 00:13:17.320
I can't remember his name.
Mary Yoda.
Is that the coach?

225
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.710
I don't know what the fuck the guy from Oregon,
he's great,
right?
Um,

226
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:26.770
and this year it's going to be the Oklahoma sooners versus the fucking,

227
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.620
uh,
who else got in?
Let's see.

228
00:13:29.621 --> 00:13:34.621
It's clubs in verse Alabama and then we got a fucking Oklahoma's playing hope.

229
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.450
Nobody in the big 10 got in

230
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:43.460
Tcu got their fucking asses kicked.
I mean,
and whenever I watched Tcu they went,

231
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.000
I can't believe I fucking miss that.
Who the fuck is Oklahoma plate?

232
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:48.810
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

233
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:53.670
<v 1>Wasn't Wisconsin.
Clemson is Alabama.
I got to hit pause here.</v>

234
00:13:53.671 --> 00:13:56.010
This is going to turn out.
Fuck that.
You guys can listen how dumb I am.

235
00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.510
I know this.
USC didn't get in.
It's gotta be a conference.

236
00:14:00.511 --> 00:14:04.800
Fucking champion Miami laws to Clemson.
Auburn didn't get in.

237
00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:09.560
Who the fuck is it?

238
00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.420
<v 4>Okay,</v>

239
00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.890
<v 1>I got to hit pause.
I don't know the fuck it is.
I'm an asshole.
Georgia.</v>

240
00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.240
I actually didn't look it up.

241
00:14:17.241 --> 00:14:18.980
I just sat there and I fucking started thinking like,

242
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
what the fuck else is in there?
Miami,
central Florida,

243
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:28.970
Florida state,
South Carolina,
gators,
Georgia.
That's how I did it.

244
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.631
Started down,

245
00:14:29.631 --> 00:14:32.940
I always start down in Miami and I fucking work my way up the George
[inaudible],

246
00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.810
Georgia bulldogs.
And I know there's a lot of people were upset.

247
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.630
A lot of people were upset that a,
it's such a flawed fucking system.
Um,

248
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.290
I know Jay lie head was telling me that fucking Alabama didn't play anybody,

249
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.410
so I didn't even fucking play anybody.
And then I'm thinking like,
well,

250
00:14:48.411 --> 00:14:50.420
the big 10 wasn't his fucking,
you know,

251
00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.770
Wisconsin being undefeated is amazing until you fucking look at the,

252
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:56.653
you know,

253
00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:57.710
<v 4>yeah,</v>

254
00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:01.490
<v 1>the western side of the fucking big 10 Nebraska stinks.</v>

255
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.260
Illinois was pathetic.
Indiana stakes,

256
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:11.030
Minnesota stakes.
Northwestern was decent.
They were seven and two,

257
00:15:11.031 --> 00:15:13.940
but I mean,
if you won that last seven games,
what they played,
nobody.

258
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.230
Um,
and I are sitting there going like,
so I'm like,

259
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:21.800
what the fuck is he talking about?
You know,

260
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.780
it's like you guys lost a fucking Iowa.
I was,
I was halfway decent.

261
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.500
Penn state was overrated.
What the fuck you talking about?
So,
you know what I did?

262
00:15:30.501 --> 00:15:35.300
I actually listened to Jay law head and I looked up the fucking Alabama crimson

263
00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:38.000
tide is fucking schedule and I gotta tell you,

264
00:15:38.001 --> 00:15:42.770
I think I could've got them five fucking winds.
J Law head,
sorry.

265
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.670
J Law had I owe an apology to this is who they played.
Florida state.

266
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:51.150
Who stinks then they played Colorado state at,
I don't even know what they,

267
00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.360
those fucking people should be selling insurance out there.

268
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:57.680
Get rid of that football team.
Mississippi.
They stink this year.

269
00:15:57.681 --> 00:16:01.670
Arkansas stunk this year.
Lsu,
you know Lee came on late,
but they stink.

270
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:05.360
I love them.
Mercer.
Is that a woman's college?
I didn't know who the fuck that is.

271
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:10.430
Fresno state.
I went to that game.
Fresno state,
you know,
I'd say they stink,

272
00:16:10.431 --> 00:16:12.500
but I've watched too many of those behind the scenes.

273
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.600
Things about frago Fresno real cobalt,
the cap.

274
00:16:15.601 --> 00:16:18.050
We are so I'm not gonna say shit about Fresno.
I'm just saying,
you know,

275
00:16:18.051 --> 00:16:22.160
they could have been a little better.
Vanderbilt a too fucking smart to be good.

276
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.780
Texas a and M,
they stunk.

277
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:27.710
Tennessee fucking stanks Mississippi state was decent.

278
00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:31.820
Then they played Auburn who was a good fucking team and they lost.

279
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.710
However they did beat the shit out of people.
They want 24,

280
00:16:36.711 --> 00:16:40.400
740120360 six to three 41 to nine.

281
00:16:40.401 --> 00:16:44.870
They did beat the fuck out of people.
56 to nothing against a woman's college.

282
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.040
41 at 10 59 and nothing against Vanderbilt.

283
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:52.850
Does he play a bunch of fucking architects?
Uh,

284
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:56.570
Nate Barr Godsy was starting at fucking punter 27,

285
00:16:56.571 --> 00:17:00.830
19 against Texas a and m 45 seven.
Hey,
by the way,

286
00:17:00.831 --> 00:17:04.490
all those students that fuck that guy out of that fucking head coaching job at

287
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:07.670
Tennessee were those signs that they wrote,
was that true?

288
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.720
And how?
Cause they really fucking,
I dunno man.

289
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:18.940
I hope they did some research this whole fucking trial by Internet.

290
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.870
Um,
I left to look that up mad cause that just,
I was like fucking in the,

291
00:17:23.871 --> 00:17:27.640
some of the shit that people wrote on sides.
He was at Penn state.

292
00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:32.140
I don't know during the whole time or part of the time when that sent Dusky guy

293
00:17:32.141 --> 00:17:34.210
was there,
but it's just like,
you know,

294
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:35.760
<v 4>okay,</v>

295
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.220
<v 1>it's,
I don't understand this stuff.</v>

296
00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.270
I love how there's like one guy does some shit,

297
00:17:39.271 --> 00:17:43.950
then all of a sudden like the most horrific fucking thing you could do a

298
00:17:43.951 --> 00:17:48.300
basically and then all of a sudden everybody fucking knew and nobody said

299
00:17:48.301 --> 00:17:50.580
anything.
Everybody,
everybody.

300
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.390
I'm not saying they weren't a few people like,
oh Jesus,

301
00:17:54.391 --> 00:17:56.430
we've got to fucking protect the university,

302
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.640
but just anybody who was there as automatically fucking guilty.

303
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.830
Some of these fucking kids,
man.
I,
you know,

304
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:06.180
this whole trial by fucking social media is a little out of control there.

305
00:18:06.181 --> 00:18:09.000
But anyways,
so I'm going off the rails here.
Um,

306
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:10.760
<v 0>okay.</v>

307
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.190
<v 1>So I dunno.
We'll see.
We'll see what the fuck happens.
Uh,</v>

308
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.190
I know Jay was upset that Ohio state did get in.
I,

309
00:18:19.191 --> 00:18:22.850
you got to tell you I'll have stayed at a tougher schedule than fucking Alabama.

310
00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:27.840
Easily,
easily had a tougher fucking schedule.
But what about,
what about Auburn?

311
00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.620
What about Auburn man,
they beat Georgia when they were number one.

312
00:18:30.621 --> 00:18:33.890
Then they beat Alabama.
They,
they be too fucking number once.

313
00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.580
Then they had to go back and beat fucking George again.
They couldn't do it.

314
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.900
You know what happened with that?

315
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.290
That fucking Auburn's coach opened his big fat fucking mouth.

316
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.030
We kicked a dog crap out of them,
did we?

317
00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.580
We don't kick the dog crap out of them dead.
You know what I mean?

318
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:54.530
I hope every fucking person who's in sports journalism,

319
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.240
I hope they watched that.

320
00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.710
They see that fucking clip and then you see the fucking Georgia bulldog showing

321
00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:05.790
up the next game with flames coming out of their fucking nostrils.

322
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.010
You know,

323
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:11.400
the next time you're going to sit there and trash bill Belicheck and say he's

324
00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:14.580
quote unquote was so boring and his press conferences,

325
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.080
that's because the man is a genius bill.
Bella check is never going to be like,

326
00:19:19.081 --> 00:19:21.360
we kicked the dog crap out.
Modern work

327
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.450
<v 5>character fuckin dog crap on the boom.</v>

328
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:30.100
<v 1>Why the fuck would you say that?
You know,</v>

329
00:19:30.101 --> 00:19:33.330
it says that the kind of guy who wears a fucking golf and hand when he's

330
00:19:33.331 --> 00:19:35.700
coaching a football team,
um,

331
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:41.250
what a dumb fucking think that that is the stupidest fucking thing you can do.

332
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:42.900
<v 0>Okay.</v>

333
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:47.010
<v 1>Bebo when the fucking cowboys will fucking kicking the shit out of the Steelers</v>

334
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.400
and like Superbowl nine or 10,
I dunno,
about 40 years ago,

335
00:19:50.401 --> 00:19:54.570
you have a look at those highlights and fucking Roy GRL a missed that field goal

336
00:19:54.571 --> 00:19:56.940
and stupid as cliff Harris got in his face,

337
00:19:56.941 --> 00:20:01.410
patted him on the fucking helmet and then Lambert came over and just body

338
00:20:01.411 --> 00:20:04.440
slammed cliff Harris back when you could do that and there wasn't a fucking,

339
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.150
you know,

340
00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:10.380
a bunch of fines and you had to go fucking sing acapella to some fuck a woman's

341
00:20:10.381 --> 00:20:13.710
group.
Whatever the fucking punishment is now.
Right.
You could do that.

342
00:20:13.711 --> 00:20:15.420
That turned the tide of the game.

343
00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:21.380
Keep your fucking mouth shut until you're holding the championship trophy and

344
00:20:21.631 --> 00:20:24.880
then you don't need to talk shit cause you want it.
You're fucking Ugh,

345
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:28.530
we don't kick the dog crap out of them.
What happened?

346
00:20:28.531 --> 00:20:32.410
She played him a few weeks later.
You get the old right there,
Fred,
don't you?
Um,

347
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.410
so anyways,
so it was a lot of 'em.

348
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

349
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.680
<v 1>There was a lot of uh,
um,
I was 100% wrong.</v>

350
00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.800
I thought j Lo head was just being a fucking homer.

351
00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:44.710
He was absolutely fucking right.
Alabama didn't play anybody,

352
00:20:44.711 --> 00:20:47.980
but they scored a lot of fucking points.
Who knows?
We'll see.

353
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.290
We'll see it now.
If Alabama goes in and wins the whole fucking thing,

354
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.090
then what does that do?

355
00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:00.660
I actually like how vague this is and how many arguments that it creates.

356
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.850
Just the whole fuck,
you know?
And at the end of the day,
you can't,

357
00:21:05.851 --> 00:21:10.110
you can't open this up to some giant fucking march madness.

358
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.870
The game is just simply to fucking violent.

359
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.440
I love that it's four teams and I love that people get left out,

360
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.290
you know,
the same way.

361
00:21:19.291 --> 00:21:22.890
I love seeing a little kid crying because his mother wouldn't get him the toy

362
00:21:22.891 --> 00:21:25.860
that he wanted.
That just warms my heart whenever I see that.

363
00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:29.190
And he'd seen a little spoiled Brat like,
yeah,
fuck you.

364
00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.980
And gave you a cheerios this morning,
didn't you?
Didn't I,
you know,

365
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.850
meanwhile I'm going to spoil a shit on and my daughter,

366
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:39.900
I'm all over the map here and what the fuck I'm talking about.
Um,

367
00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.990
so that's what I did all day.
Uh,

368
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.540
all day on fry out Friday and Saturday.

369
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:49.420
I just watched fucking college football other than when I was traveling,

370
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:54.260
going out to a,
the fact that I fly out to

371
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.890
Albuquerque,
New Mexico,
and he was funny.

372
00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:02.990
It was a six hour drive from Albuquerque to Tucson.

373
00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.720
I should have done that.
I wasn't paying attention.

374
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.420
I actually flew down and rather than getting a direct flight,

375
00:22:08.421 --> 00:22:10.630
I had to connect through Phoenix.
So it was the fire.

376
00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.900
I could have flown from La to,
to the Goddamn Columbus,
Ohio,

377
00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.620
you know,
and uh,
speaking of buckeyes right in that,

378
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.990
the amount of time that it took me in this,

379
00:22:20.991 --> 00:22:24.920
the fucking person who flew us from Phoenix,
from,
from uh,

380
00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.660
Albuquerque to Phoenix.
Okay.
We're taxiing out to get to the,

381
00:22:29.661 --> 00:22:33.260
uh,
I don't know,
on our way out to the runway.
Right.

382
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.820
And the guide bags a left and then quickly goes back to the right.

383
00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:41.060
And I was just like,
Whoa,
what the fuck?
And I was like,
well,
you know,

384
00:22:41.061 --> 00:22:42.320
maybe it was the tower.

385
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:47.330
Maybe they said make a left on a Bravo Radha.
I mean,
right.
Sorry.
Right.

386
00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.950
Correction,
go right on.
Bravo.
Right.

387
00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.520
So I got this app work and listen to the tower.

388
00:22:52.521 --> 00:22:55.790
So I put it on to here to try and listen to see if I could hear anything,

389
00:22:55.791 --> 00:23:00.230
which I couldn't.
So we take off flights,

390
00:23:00.231 --> 00:23:01.670
great flying,
everything's fine.

391
00:23:01.671 --> 00:23:04.280
Not No fucking problems would come in and go land,
land.

392
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:08.180
Landing was nice and everything.
And then we're going in with taxing me in.

393
00:23:08.181 --> 00:23:10.700
We go in to get into the a where you parked the plane,

394
00:23:10.701 --> 00:23:14.090
whatever the fuck he call it,
the gate.
And this fucking guy,

395
00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.450
he literally did a donut.
He did a three 60 with the airplane.

396
00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.320
He once again went left when he was supposed to go.
Right.

397
00:23:21.321 --> 00:23:24.500
And we fucking did an entire three,
not it,
maybe not an entire three 60.

398
00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.940
I think he just missed the gay and he just drove by it and then he couldn't go

399
00:23:28.941 --> 00:23:31.740
right into it because he would have hit the other plane.
So he had to,

400
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.530
because it was on the right hand side.
He had a bang,

401
00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.630
the left and we live it did like a fucking doubt.

402
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:42.110
And everybody's in the plane like,
what the fuck are we doing?
Guide a bad day.

403
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:47.360
He or she,
whoever the fuck was up front,
um,
it was hilarious.

404
00:23:47.361 --> 00:23:49.760
Everybody was getting off the plane like to,
what the fuck was that?

405
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:55.050
The hell just happened.
You know what happens?
You know,
you drive down the street,

406
00:23:55.051 --> 00:23:58.280
sometimes you miss the home depot is I can't fuck,
I got to go back around again.

407
00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.670
I don't feel like doing it legally and he just fucking bang a Uie.
Right.

408
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:06.890
Well the same thing happens in aviation,
evidently have a fucking Dan Lee.

409
00:24:06.891 --> 00:24:10.520
The same thing happens.
Um,
Jesus,

410
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.100
what the fuck is going on in Kansas City by the way?

411
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:18.130
They lost to the New York jets.
Jets.
It decent.
Good Lord.

412
00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.420
This is why,
you know,
coaching in the NFL,
he's got to be a bitch.

413
00:24:22.421 --> 00:24:27.340
Can you imagine Andy Reed after September starts to year,
they,

414
00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.150
they fucking beat the dog.
That the fray.
We beat the dog crap.

415
00:24:31.151 --> 00:24:34.420
All of them fucking patriot.
You right?
Not really.

416
00:24:34.421 --> 00:24:37.720
They just dominated the fourth quarter and ran away with it at that point.
Right?

417
00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.740
Everybody's all excited.
Holy Shit.

418
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:44.130
Then all of a sudden Tom Brady's fucking old and uh,

419
00:24:44.131 --> 00:24:47.320
they'll fucking water goes down the drain that different way.
Black is white,

420
00:24:47.321 --> 00:24:47.951
white.
He's black.

421
00:24:47.951 --> 00:24:50.830
You don't know what the fuck's going on all the way through September.

422
00:24:50.831 --> 00:24:54.790
I bet he started a building,
an addition onto his fucking house,
you know,

423
00:24:54.791 --> 00:24:57.400
getting ready to put that fucking trophy in there.
And uh,

424
00:24:57.401 --> 00:25:00.490
after these last two fucking months,
the last eight God damn weeks,

425
00:25:00.491 --> 00:25:03.550
I would say that the,
that they've stopped the construction,

426
00:25:03.551 --> 00:25:08.140
he probably has a tarp over the top of it.
Um,
I like Andy Reid.

427
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:12.690
I hope they turn it around.
I haven't been able to watch the game,

428
00:25:12.691 --> 00:25:14.070
but Jesus fucking Christ,

429
00:25:14.071 --> 00:25:18.300
they can't get a God damn when they cannot get a fucking win.

430
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:24.330
So,
um,
I actually watched a bunch of football today too when I,
when I landed,

431
00:25:24.331 --> 00:25:26.160
I watched the Patriots first,
the bills.

432
00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:30.000
I thought that was gonna be a lot closer game.
I thought tie Rod Taylor,

433
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:34.140
who is going to give us headaches.
All right,
tie Rod Taylor.
I liked that guy,

434
00:25:34.141 --> 00:25:35.220
but I'll tell you right now,

435
00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.050
he is no Russell Wilson and after watching the fucking Seattle Seahawks tonight,

436
00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.960
uh,
I'm going to go on a limb.
I think I could block for Russell Wilson.

437
00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:48.770
I could just have a guy in about eight seconds run around me and then just watch

438
00:25:48.841 --> 00:25:53.841
him fucking be like this modern day Fran target that that guy is fucking

439
00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:58.980
unbelievable.
I don't even know how good Seattle's offensive line is.

440
00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:00.330
I don't even know if they're decent.

441
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.720
All I know is at the end of every game they should be giving.

442
00:26:03.721 --> 00:26:08.520
They should be fucking making it rain that Russell Wilson's locker,

443
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.710
because they're all going to get a big contract because I guarantee you he

444
00:26:13.711 --> 00:26:17.490
probably got sacked probably,
I dunno what,
three times,

445
00:26:17.491 --> 00:26:22.220
four times less than he should have.
The fucking eagles were in the backfield.
Oh.

446
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.330
It was like every time he went back for the past,

447
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:27.450
the guy to run like an extra 40 yards until somebody got opened

448
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:30.460
the gun.
I'm like,
I dunno.

449
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:35.120
Like I felt like they got maybe two or three times that game maybe.
Um,

450
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:41.080
but Jesus Christ as that guy,
fun to watch and Seattle look to say,
I look fun.

451
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:42.530
They look really strong,
man.

452
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:47.220
That was actually kind of like root for the Eagles because,
uh,
you know,

453
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:48.690
I don't know what the Patriots are going to do.
I,

454
00:26:48.691 --> 00:26:51.890
you never know when you're playing the AFC east,
you know,

455
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:54.630
that's our fucking schedules.
Like the Alabama Crimson tide,

456
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.650
you don't often stink.
Bill stinked at jet stink this year.

457
00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:00.480
They're all fucking average.
You know what I mean?

458
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:04.310
There's literally six wins right there.
Um,
so I,

459
00:27:04.311 --> 00:27:07.950
I really don't know how good we are,
but,
uh,
that was a huge game tonight.

460
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.120
This is what it feels like a sports podcast.

461
00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:15.170
I did start off talking about fucking old people in lazy boys right there.
Nice.

462
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.580
And I also believe I solved the Middle Eastern crisis.

463
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.943
<v 0>MMM.</v>

464
00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:26.070
<v 1>I just watch,
I'm sorry.
I just watched a ton of fucking football and uh,</v>

465
00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:28.810
well at this point you gotta be into football if you're still listening.

466
00:27:28.811 --> 00:27:33.310
So I'm not gonna apologize.
I should apologize like fucking 10 minutes ago.
But,

467
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.930
um,
I don't know.
The defense looked fucking great.

468
00:27:36.931 --> 00:27:38.280
Richard Sherman isn't even in there.

469
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:41.580
Can I ask you guys a fucking question about the Achilles Tendon?
Why?

470
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:46.820
Why do you rupture your Achilles tendon but you tear your ACL?

471
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.301
Why is that?

472
00:27:48.301 --> 00:27:51.870
Why don't you rupture your ACL and tear your fucking Achilles tended?

473
00:27:51.871 --> 00:27:55.230
Why is that?
He said because your Achilles tendon goes up.

474
00:27:55.231 --> 00:27:59.190
You fought back he leg like a fucking window shade.

475
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.090
Is that what it is?
You know what?
I'm actually going to look that up.

476
00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.730
I'm going to look that up.
I'm gonna put this fucking urban myth.

477
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.660
This is it a metal.
Now it's not.
It's uh,
uh,
I dunno.

478
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.130
It's a fucking question I have.

479
00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:16.630
Why do you rupture a,

480
00:28:16.631 --> 00:28:20.530
that's not going to come out right?
Your Achilles.

481
00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:21.900
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

482
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.290
<v 1>Okay.
Wait it out because there'll be like,
cause you fucking didn't stretch.</v>

483
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.930
That's the wrong way to search.
How about

484
00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:33.620
<v 0>rupture?
Verse Tear.</v>

485
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:38.280
<v 1>Achilles.
All right,
let's see what we got here.
What do we got here?</v>

486
00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:45.060
Achilles tendon rupture is an injury that affects the back of your lower leg.
Oh,

487
00:28:45.061 --> 00:28:45.980
is that where it is?

488
00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:48.243
<v 0>Jesus Christ.</v>

489
00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:54.600
<v 1>All right.
It mainly occurs in people playing recreational sports.</v>

490
00:28:54.601 --> 00:28:56.400
That means white guys playing pickup hoop.

491
00:28:56.430 --> 00:29:00.900
Every fucking white dude I know over the age of 40,
35,
40,
who still plays hoops,

492
00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.650
every one of them gets to Colby injury,
but it can happen to anyone.

493
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.520
That's why before you get out of bed,
if you're a fucking old person,

494
00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:12.510
especially an old white guy.
All right?
I don't know.

495
00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.850
I mean the many black guys other than than,

496
00:29:13.851 --> 00:29:18.851
than fucking Richard Sherman and Coby Bryan like superstar black guys do it

497
00:29:19.411 --> 00:29:21.900
right,
but average white people just all the fucking time.

498
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.320
I'm just making up shit here before you get out of bed in the morning.

499
00:29:25.321 --> 00:29:28.830
I'm telling you,
if you,
if you run a little tight,
okay,
I'm telling you,

500
00:29:28.831 --> 00:29:33.120
I've said this before,
you fucking take your toes pointing at your knees slowly.

501
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.560
All right?
And if you get an a,

502
00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:38.910
if you get a fucking Charlie horse in your fucking calves immediately point your

503
00:29:38.911 --> 00:29:41.680
toes in the other direction and a little release.
Okay?
But if you don't,

504
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.270
just point in your fucking do it right now.
Your desk,

505
00:29:46.271 --> 00:29:49.810
what the fuck are you not doing?
Shit right?
But when you sit down,
right,

506
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:52.150
don't do it.
Wait til you fucking laid out.
Don't listen to me,

507
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.380
but I'm still going to Talki right.

508
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:58.330
Point your toes at your niece and your kneecaps.
I saw you do.

509
00:29:58.331 --> 00:30:02.230
And you just do that for a good,
I don't know,
1520 seconds,
right?

510
00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.730
Then you pointed with the other direction that the fucking wall or whatever in

511
00:30:06.731 --> 00:30:11.380
front of you,
all right,
your dog that's laying on the end of your bed,
okay?

512
00:30:11.381 --> 00:30:13.180
Then once you do that for 15 seconds,

513
00:30:13.181 --> 00:30:18.181
then you roll your fucking feet clockwise a couple times and counter clockwise.

514
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.230
Then you get out of bed.

515
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:24.730
Don't just lay there for fucking eight hours sleeping with you,

516
00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:28.960
God damn apnea and then just pop out of bed and take that first step because

517
00:30:28.961 --> 00:30:32.290
you're going to get you get you get you going to be fucked.
Planter Fisher,

518
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:35.110
it's all that bullshit.
All right,
let's,
let's continue with the Achilles tendon.

519
00:30:35.111 --> 00:30:35.801
Is he strong?

520
00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:39.940
Fiber is cord that connects the muscles in the back of your calf to your heel

521
00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:43.890
bone.
If you overstretch your Achilles tendon,
it can tear.
Fuck,

522
00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:45.510
wait a minute.

523
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:49.920
I thought it was cause you didn't tear slash rupture completely or just

524
00:30:49.921 --> 00:30:53.160
partially.
If you're killies tendon ruptures,

525
00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:58.550
you might hear a pop followed by an immediate bitch like scream that appears to

526
00:31:00.301 --> 00:31:01.650
come from your mouth area.

527
00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:05.790
No followed by an immediate sharp pain in the back of your ankle and lower leg.

528
00:31:05.791 --> 00:31:08.520
That is likely to affect your ability to walk properly.

529
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:12.850
Surgery is often performed to repair the rupture for many people over

530
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.140
nonsurgical treatment works just as well.

531
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.460
This is not answering my fucking question.

532
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.340
Why do they say rupture?

533
00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:26.010
<v 4>Okay.</v>

534
00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:29.460
<v 1>For Kelly's,
I can't believe I know how to spell Achilles.</v>

535
00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.940
It's how big a fucking Zeplin Fan I am.
I spelled it wrong.

536
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:38.190
Achilles tendon ruptures,
Jersey.

537
00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.033
<v 4>What</v>

538
00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.650
<v 1>to do if you tell it.
You know what?
I don't even give a fuck anymore.</v>

539
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:48.630
Somebody has got to be a Goddamn doctor or a first responder.

540
00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.100
Who could fucking tell me what it means.
Um,

654
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:59.850
Then I do know,
um,
oh,
you know what?

655
00:38:59.851 --> 00:39:03.270
I ordered this old modern drummer because it was right around the time John

656
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:06.870
Bonham died and they had this little John Bonham retrospective.

657
00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:09.270
I thought they're going to be a little more shocked that he was gone.

658
00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:11.730
They just kind of said,
you know,
he's one of the great drummers of all time.

659
00:39:11.731 --> 00:39:16.200
He has all his beats and all that shit.
You know,
it's real.
It's really cool.
One,

660
00:39:16.201 --> 00:39:18.250
like what's his face is on the cover.
Let me see what's on the,

661
00:39:18.251 --> 00:39:22.020
I don't even know who's on the cover.
It's from so long ago.
It's 1981.

662
00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:25.950
Um,
hang on a second.
Hang on a second.
As I walk across the room,

663
00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.280
it's uh,

664
00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.460
oh shit.
It's Peter Criss,
Peter,
Chris,

665
00:39:39.461 --> 00:39:42.040
and he's sitting,
I swear to God,

666
00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:47.070
he is playing a pearl drum kit with concert Tom's,

667
00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.350
but you novices out there,
that means there's no bottom heads.

668

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:12.090
So he has an 11 piece kit to play at one Oh rock and roll.

673
00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:16.660

680
00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:41.170

681
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:42.700

682
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:47.680
the mount two toms and then they'd have a third one there.
When I opened this up,

683
00:40:47.681 --> 00:40:51.970

00:41:05.861 --> 00:41:09.070
You look at like the bass drum pedals that they had and this was like the 80s

689
00:41:09.071 --> 00:41:13.300
this was like 15 years after John Bonham did good times.

00:42:09.901 --> 00:42:14.520
apology from you.
Dear Burbank,
bad boy brain redbird,

709
00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:19.710
redbird,
whatever the fuck that means.
A Bill Burbank.

710
00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:23.910
That's going to be my fucking alias.
A,
I've got an interesting one for you.

711
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.290
A little bit of context.
I am 24 and two years out of school.

712
00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.900
I live with my girlfriend of almost five years,

713
00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:34.890
roughly two years ago on a sorority trip with my girlfriend,

714
00:42:34.891 --> 00:42:36.960
her friend and her friend's boyfriend.

715
00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:42.410
I gave the girl one of those awkward side hugs after she went out for a beer

716
00:42:43.381 --> 00:42:46.590
run.
No sexual intent whatsoever just to thank you.

717
00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:52.490
Evidently the boyfriend felt otherwise and flew into a rage shortly thereafter

718
00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:55.260
and salting the girl and my girlfriend.

719
00:42:55.290 --> 00:43:00.290
I didn't learn about this until well after and since I have no relationship with

720
00:43:01.531 --> 00:43:02.364
the guy.

721
00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.120
<v 4>Okay.</v>

722
00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:07.290
<v 1>Was content to let it be now wait a minute.</v>

723
00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:08.890
<v 4>Okay.</v>

724
00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:10.960
<v 1>Did the guys see the side hug?</v>

725
00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:14.000
<v 4>All right,</v>

726
00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:16.660
<v 1>wait,
or what the fuck happened?</v>

727
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.680
I gave the girl of one of one of those awkward side hugs have to,

728
00:43:22.931 --> 00:43:27.880
she went out for a beer run.
No sexual intent,
whatever,
just to thank you.

729
00:43:27.881 --> 00:43:32.740
Evidently the boyfriend felt otherwise.
If flew into a rage shortly after,

730
00:43:32.741 --> 00:43:35.020
I guess he waited till you leave on this guy a pussy.
That,

731
00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:39.720
what are you worried about?
If he was fucking there,
but she called him up.
Ah,

732
00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:44.540
me fucking
touched this opposite side.

733
00:43:44.541 --> 00:43:49.250
Shoulder of mine.
All right.
Flash Florida for two years later,

734
00:43:49.251 --> 00:43:51.840
the two of them have just gotten engaged.

735
00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:55.730
My girlfriend will be a bridesmaid and learned from the other girl.

736
00:43:55.731 --> 00:43:59.990
I will not be invited to the wedding unless I apologize to the boyfriend now go

737
00:43:59.991 --> 00:44:03.950
fuck yourself.
Fuck this fucking pussy.

738
00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.130
Why does he call you up?

739
00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:08.260
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

740
00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.960
<v 1>he did good.
You May.
Where do you this?
You apologize me.</v>

741
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.590
Why is this woman marrying this guy two years later,

742
00:44:14.591 --> 00:44:17.800
he's still mad about a side hug.
Jesus Christ.

743
00:44:17.801 --> 00:44:19.720
How possessive as this fucking maniac.

744
00:44:19.721 --> 00:44:22.150
I feel bad for the woman that's married this lunatic.

745
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:26.410
Alright for inappropriately touching his girl.
Well,
dude,
by the way,

746
00:44:26.411 --> 00:44:29.200
I'm just hearing your side of the story,
you know,

747
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:31.230
did you do one of those awkward side hugs?

748
00:44:31.231 --> 00:44:34.950
And then Jan came off her shoulder and accidentally went across their ass.

749
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.190
If it was just an awkward side Hug,
I say,
fuck this guy.

750
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.400
Out of respect for my girlfriend,
I'm tempted to apologize.

751
00:44:41.401 --> 00:44:45.120
But since an apology is an admission of guilt and I didn't do anything wrong,

752
00:44:45.121 --> 00:44:46.710
my pride is holding me back.
You know what?

753
00:44:46.711 --> 00:44:49.440
Because you just said that actually believe in you.
I actually believe you.

754
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:53.940
I'm surprised that he's been too cowardly to approach me and it's having to work

755
00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:56.820
through to people to get what he wants.
What we do do.
Uh,

756
00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:57.990
you know what I would do?
I would,

757
00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.160
I would go fucking find out what sports is playing in that area.

758
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:07.350
Tell my girlfriend to have a good time at the fucking wedding.
Love the podcast.

759
00:45:07.351 --> 00:45:11.190
Love to stand up.
Thanks.
Um,
this is what I would say.

760
00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.810
I would just say I did nothing wrong,

761
00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:17.811
so I'm not apologizing and tell that groom to be congratulations on getting

762
00:45:18.511 --> 00:45:18.931
married.

763
00:45:18.931 --> 00:45:22.110
And at some point he might want to grow a Dick if he wants to be the man of the

764
00:45:22.111 --> 00:45:25.680
house.
I'll get some fucking balls,
dude.
Fuck that guy.

765
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.210
Five would go to a fucking tractor pull before I would go to the fucking
wedding.

766
00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.960
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
You'll be fucking hilarious.

767
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:39.210
Go to the wedding anyways.

768
00:45:39.211 --> 00:45:42.050
And then after they fucking exchange their goddamn vows,

769
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:46.950
go up and give her a side hug.
Yeah,

770
00:45:46.951 --> 00:45:49.620
Dude.
Fuck that.
Fuck that.
I don't feel,

771
00:45:49.621 --> 00:45:53.580
I don't see your letter that does any pressure from your now girlfriend.

772
00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:59.640
Um,
you know,
however,
if you don't go,
she,

773
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:02.790
you know,
she might be,
or what the fat gaming guy an hour less than,

774
00:46:02.791 --> 00:46:05.760
as in they're getting married.
You mean you really flex my ring?

775
00:46:05.761 --> 00:46:09.040
You might have to go down that road,
but I got to tell you.
Yeah,

776
00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:12.480
this might be a twofer.
You very human dating this woman for five fucking years.

777
00:46:12.481 --> 00:46:15.570
You're not giving her a ring.
So what the fuck did I say?

778
00:46:15.571 --> 00:46:20.050
You dump your current girlfriend and tell that guy to go fuck himself.
Uh,

779
00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:25.260
uh,
you know,
I'd dump everybody in this fucking story.

780
00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:28.050
Sorry I'm a little grumpy.
Don't listen to me,

781
00:46:28.051 --> 00:46:30.660
but I definitely wouldn't apologize to that guy.
And I would go to the wedding.

782
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:34.560
I mean,
you're a guy who the fuck wants to go to a wedding.
This is great.

783
00:46:34.561 --> 00:46:37.710
You got an hour.
All right?
And just stay with that.

784
00:46:37.711 --> 00:46:41.250
I just can't do it because they feel it's an admission of guilt.

785
00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:46.200
And during this sensitive time is climate and worried that did this.

786
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:50.370
If they,
if they see,
I'm sorry there,
Dennis was somehow going to meet Instagram,

787
00:46:50.371 --> 00:46:53.970
which is tailored to me,
Facebook and overdue my Twitter and I may not get a job.

788
00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:54.930
Just call that fucking room.

789
00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.090
Or You could just be a man and just see and then apologize and that gay.

790
00:46:58.091 --> 00:47:02.670
Fuck him.
All right.
And then you,
you're fucking girlfriend.

791
00:47:02.671 --> 00:47:05.910
Year duty.
We,
me,
I would love to go,

792
00:47:05.911 --> 00:47:08.550
but I'm not going under those circumstances.
And I'll tell you right now,

793
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:11.120
if you didn't do shit in the fucking bride wanted,

794
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:13.770
you apologize and you didn't want to,
I would back you.

795
00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:19.430
So I'm not going.
If you want to go,
you can go off.
You know,

796
00:47:19.431 --> 00:47:22.230
I'd go and get over here and blow me and let's go to the game day.
You Go.

797
00:47:22.231 --> 00:47:26.910
That's what you're saying.
All right.
Boyfriend rides.
Motocross.
Dear Bill,

798
00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:30.010
I love all your work and your comedy.
Thank you.

799
00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:34.030
You're so inspire of Jesus Christ.
[inaudible] okay.

800
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:38.440
Where'd I'd like where?
I'd like your input.
Here we go.

801
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.980
I'm seriously dating someone who loves to ride and race motocross.

802
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:46.930
That's fucking awesome.
I bet.
I bet this isn't the same woman from the last one.

803
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.410
You know?
I bet this is the guy that's getting married.
The motocross guy.

804
00:47:50.411 --> 00:47:54.440
This guy is fucking cool.
This guy doesn't like a fucking side hug.

805
00:47:54.441 --> 00:47:57.200
He's just going to fucking punch you in the face with his motorcycle gloves to,

806
00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:59.930
right.
Uh,
we've been together for over a year,

807
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:04.160
so I'm starting to think about marriage and a family with this person because

808
00:48:04.161 --> 00:48:08.690
they're both 25.
Well,
that's,
that makes sense.
Uh,
he's awesome in every way.

809
00:48:08.691 --> 00:48:11.840
And the person I know I want to be with forever.
Well,
they go,

810
00:48:11.841 --> 00:48:16.280
but he loves to ride and race motocross.
It's not on the professional level.

811
00:48:16.281 --> 00:48:19.310
It's a hobby.
Aww Sweetheart.

812
00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:22.890
You're going to do this.
You're going to take away his fucking hobby.

813
00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.940
We had a talk recently where I asked him how long he wants to keep riding.

814
00:48:26.941 --> 00:48:28.260
And he said forever.

815
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:34.270
I know someone who has two children who husband had an accident riding a dirt

816
00:48:34.271 --> 00:48:37.540
bike.
He's paralyzed and doesn't remember who his kids are.

817
00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:39.510
<v 0>Uh,</v>

818
00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.220
<v 1>well,
Jesus Christ is,
people will get in cars.
I mean,
come on,
man.
What are you,</v>

819
00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:45.800
what are you doing?
This,
this is,
come on.
I'll tell you right now,
if you,

820
00:48:45.801 --> 00:48:48.890
if this guy who you want to marry,
if you want to make them fucking miserable,

821
00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:51.970
we'll have to explain this to my boyfriend.
He said his,

822
00:48:51.971 --> 00:48:56.200
something's going to happen to me.
It will,
whether I'm riding motocross or not,

823
00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:00.160
I'm not going to change what I love doing because of fear of what could happen.

824
00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:04.390
Uh,
I gotta tell you this.
I have,
I understand why you love this guy.

825
00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:07.030
I'm starting to develop feelings for this guy.
He's holding his ground.

826
00:49:07.031 --> 00:49:11.680
He's riding motorcycles,
and we date the fucking Marlboro man here.
Um,

827
00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:17.470
I,
I think that's a selfish response when it involves your children.

828
00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:22.340
Hate to try and,
well,
you're getting,
you don't have any kids yet.
All right.

829
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:28.850
You said,
I hate to try to convince him to stop something he loves doing so much,

830
00:49:28.851 --> 00:49:33.080
but I can't imagine being with someone who participates in an extreme sport as a

831
00:49:33.081 --> 00:49:35.300
hobby when I have children with them.

832
00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:39.650
Is it wrong of me to ask them to promise to stop and we have kids or am I being

833
00:49:39.651 --> 00:49:40.484
controlling?

834
00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:42.083
<v 0>Uh,</v>

835
00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:47.430
<v 1>well first of all,
the fact that you asked that you're a cool person.
All right?</v>

836
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:51.000
If you're actually questioning your behavior,
this is the thing.

837
00:49:51.001 --> 00:49:54.750
I think you're a little further ahead emotionally in this relationship than when

838
00:49:54.751 --> 00:49:57.330
he's at where most women are.
All right?

839
00:49:58.250 --> 00:49:59.083
<v 0>Uh,</v>

840
00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:04.690
<v 1>and this is the thing,
when you become a dad,
you do change.</v>

841
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:09.580
All right?
So that rather than fucking Nag him about this shit,

842
00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:14.830
just let the guy ride and if you get married,
okay,

843
00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:18.100
I'm telling you right now,
when you get married and you have a fucking kid,

844
00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:22.510
this guy is going to be so fucking sleep deprived.
And so God damn tired,

845
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:28.040
he's not going to have time to ride.
Okay.
Though as much as it used to,

846
00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:31.240
which will then make it safer cause he's not writing as much.
But,
um,

847
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:35.750
I think there's a big thing you can't,
when you love somebody,

848
00:50:35.751 --> 00:50:40.100
you have to let them do what they love unless it's heroin.
Okay.

849
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:48.110
Or being a pedophile.
Obvious fucking thinks.
All right.
But other,
do you know

850
00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:54.480
if my wife liked all of a sudden wanted to be one of those roller Derby Queens,

851
00:50:54.481 --> 00:50:57.090
as much as it wouldn't fucking destroy me.

852
00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:01.140
Watching her taking those bumps as the elbow and them was there skating around

853
00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:03.360
if she really loved doing it.

854
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.770
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

855
00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:07.210
<v 1>You know,
I,
I wouldn't tell her not to fucking do it.</v>

856
00:51:07.211 --> 00:51:10.240
I really would be worried about concussions.
It's shit like that.
I would be,

857
00:51:10.241 --> 00:51:14.900
I'm not going to lie to you,
but,
um,
you got to let people do what they do.

858
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:18.350
Uh,
it sounds like you've got a really cool guy that you're dating by the way,

859
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.290
so congratulations.
Um,

860
00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:25.460
and I think you're going to be a great mom cause you're doing what a mom does.

861
00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:27.650
A mom's already looking way into the future,

862
00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:30.890
trying to figure out where the danger is and try to eliminate it.
All right.

863
00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:34.430
So thank you both.
Lucky to have each other just fucking relax.

864
00:51:34.431 --> 00:51:38.450
Get yourself a god damn glass of wine.
Let the guy ride his bike.
You know,

865
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.400
you guys get married some day,
I'm telling you,

866
00:51:40.401 --> 00:51:42.950
what do you get fucking knocked up and all of a sudden he's got to go to seven

867
00:51:42.951 --> 00:51:47.940
11.
You know,
cause you want beef jerky in a fucking fucking,

868
00:51:47.941 --> 00:51:51.540
I don't know,
when did some God damn ice cream whenever you're craving is,
uh,

869
00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:56.280
you know,
believe me,
like I have had to make adjustments in my life.

870
00:51:57.230 --> 00:52:00.750
Um,
I think you'll be fine,
but uh,
you definitely really,

871
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:02.701
you know,
you know,

872
00:52:02.701 --> 00:52:05.490
they would say a good man's hard to find a good woman is also hard to find.

873
00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.070
And the fact that you're cool enough to actually be considering,

874
00:52:08.071 --> 00:52:11.280
am I being a Douche share?
Uh,
I think you guys are going to be all right.

875
00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:14.460
All right,
there you go.
Alright.
Neighbor,
neighbor invasion.

876
00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:15.890
<v 4>Okay,</v>

877
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:20.780
<v 1>dear Billy mango tits.
I don't know what that means.
It's bizarre and I like it.</v>

878
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:25.420
All right.
I am an older lady,
uh,

879
00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:30.130
who just moved into a sweet cottage in the boondocks last month.

880
00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:31.823
All right.

881
00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:37.620
I met my next door neighbor before I moved in and I liked her instantly and she

882
00:52:38.051 --> 00:52:41.830
seemed warm and funny as it turned out.

883
00:52:41.831 --> 00:52:46.831
She's a Kramer in the first week she came knocking on my door numerous times for

884
00:52:47.801 --> 00:52:50.230
social calls.
Oh No.

885
00:52:50.231 --> 00:52:52.900
And she will stay for long periods of time.

886
00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:56.590
Even if I tell her I'm busy and she won't sit down.

887
00:52:56.591 --> 00:52:59.800
So I feel like a captive audience to her monologues.

888
00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:04.510
I'm a solitary person and I don't like peeping people coming over unannounced

889
00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:09.620
unless it's an emergency.
This ain't,
this ain't right.
Little House,

890
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:11.930
a little house on the prairie.

891
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:16.970
I have told her firmly on numerous occasions to fucking stop it.
Oh,

892
00:53:16.971 --> 00:53:19.310
good for you.
You're a strong person.
And I like it.

893
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:23.600
And that would appreciate her emailing me and waiting for a response or leaving

894
00:53:23.601 --> 00:53:28.260
a note if she wants to hang.
I'm not sure how much more clear I can be,

895
00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:31.410
uh,
that I'm uncomfortable with the situation.

896
00:53:31.411 --> 00:53:35.880
Especially when I see her face in my kitchen window at night,
waving me down.

897
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.940
It scares the shit out of me.
Yeah.
That made me uncomfortable.

898
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:42.870
She's even knocked on my bathroom window when I didn't answer the door.

899
00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:47.360
I don't wish to be mean.
Oh No,
you gotta be me.
You have to be mean.
Uh,

900
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:50.760
since I live next to her,
I know she's lonely and well,
yeah,

901
00:53:50.761 --> 00:53:53.230
cause she's a fucking lunatic.
Were kind of Guinea went,

902
00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:55.650
look what she's doing to you and you don't even live with their,

903
00:53:55.651 --> 00:53:59.400
can you imagine living with this woman to be like that thing an alien that's on

904
00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:02.700
those fucking people's faces.
Um,

905
00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:06.990
I know she is lonely and it,
and I liked to be friends with her,

906
00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:08.190
but she,

907
00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:13.640
but she just no comprendo love your podcast and advice and thanks you ginger

908
00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:19.680
Moose knuckle for not being a sex offender because all my heroes are going down.

909
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:23.370
Uh,
well,
you know,
it's still early in this game.
You know,

910
00:54:23.371 --> 00:54:26.430
someone could accuse me of something.
God knows.
It doesn't matter what the fuck.

911
00:54:26.431 --> 00:54:28.350
I mean,
I don't know.
Nobody really innocent.

912
00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:31.110
Nobody who seemed innocent has fucking,
uh,

913
00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:36.120
seem to have been called out yet.
You know,
I,
a couple of people have been like,

914
00:54:36.121 --> 00:54:38.520
I've never met that woman in my life and then it fucking goes away.

915
00:54:38.521 --> 00:54:42.420
So I think it's all right.
Right.
It still makes you nervous as a guy going,

916
00:54:42.421 --> 00:54:44.280
Jesus Christ,
you know,

917
00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:48.450
this whole trial by social media is kind of scary over there.
All right,

918
00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:51.630
let's stay with the,
uh,
the,
the topic here.
Um,

919
00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:59.930
I don't,
I don't know what I would just be,
look all,

920
00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:03.650
I can't tell you what to do.
All I can tell you is what I would do.
All right.

921
00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:08.420
I would do what you already did.
And um,

922
00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:12.310
all right.
You want to know what I would do when she knocks on the door?

923
00:55:12.311 --> 00:55:15.520
I'd be like,
get Outta here.
Fuck off.

924
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:20.650
I would do that.
And when she knocked on my window and scared the shit out of me,

925
00:55:20.651 --> 00:55:22.750
I'd be like,
dude,
are you Outta your fucking mind?

926
00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:24.310
You're scaring the shit out of me.

927
00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:30.950
I want to be friends with you,
but you suffocate me.
You asshole.

928
00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:34.670
All right.
Do you want to be friends with me?
Yes or no?
Yes.
Great.

929
00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:36.500
Then stop being a fucking jerk off.

930
00:55:36.830 --> 00:55:40.510
Stop knocking on my fucking door and my window.
Stop crying.
Alright.
Alright.

931
00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:44.060
Come on in.
I'm in.
I'm sorry.
Let me make it some lemonade.

932
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:46.720
She's one of those people.
Um,

933
00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:54.480
I dunno.
I Dunno why.
I Dunno what I would I get a BB gun?

934
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:56.640
Maybe shoot her in the fucking knee as she comes over.

935
00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.180
Maybe she'll think it's a beehive or some shit.
I don't know what I would do.

936
00:56:01.690 --> 00:56:03.650
I Dunno what the fuck I would do a,

937
00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:06.370
if you've actually told her that she sounds like a crazy person,

938
00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:10.270
why would you want to be friends with a crazy person?
I think he just got it.

939
00:56:10.271 --> 00:56:11.380
You can just got to ignore.

940
00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:13.790
<v 4>Okay.</v>

941
00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:17.180
<v 1>Like the next time she knocks on her.
When you window like that,</v>

942
00:56:17.181 --> 00:56:19.820
I would just knock back on the same on the other side of the window.

943
00:56:19.821 --> 00:56:23.970
I'd knocked back and then give her the finger,
see how she handles that.

944
00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:26.520
That's one way to do it.

945
00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:30.030
The other way to do it is to start talking about shit that freaks her out of,

946
00:56:30.031 --> 00:56:31.260
she's really religious.

947
00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:35.790
Just talk about how much you love Satan and you've given yourself over to him.

948
00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:45.800
Uh,
I dunno what else you could do fart in her presence.
I Dunno.

949
00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.620
I'd have no idea.
I don't know what to do.
I feel bad for you.
Um,

950
00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:52.850
for some reason it reminded me of misery.

951
00:56:52.851 --> 00:56:56.870
I just keep picturing that woman walking up to the window,

952
00:56:56.871 --> 00:56:59.250
the CACA duty,
whatever.
Fucking come up to the window.

953
00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:01.760
It's very American horror story.

954
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:06.080
A wife cries at least.
So I hope that helps you out.
Um,

955
00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:10.950
I would just be more firm.
Write her a letter,
dear neighbor.

956
00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:14.310
Fuck off.
Sincerely,
uh,

957
00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:19.230
solitary woman in college,
uh,
cottage next to you,
right?
All right.

958
00:57:19.231 --> 00:57:23.880
Wife cries at least three times a week.
Dear bill burr bag.

959
00:57:23.881 --> 00:57:26.190
It's a big fan of you.

960
00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:29.100
Of your f you attitude towards life.

961
00:57:29.101 --> 00:57:31.410
I don't have a fuck you attitude towards life.
Okay.

962
00:57:31.411 --> 00:57:36.411
I think it's very precious and know that I am taking notes by telling people to

963
00:57:36.841 --> 00:57:39.990
go fuck yourself.
All right.
Anyways.
Anyways,

964
00:57:39.991 --> 00:57:43.860
I have an issue with my wife to be because she cries all the time.

965
00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:50.060
All right.
That's a deal breaker for me.
Uh,
Ari,
I already have my advice.

966
00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:52.280
Next time she cries,

967
00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:58.010
just gently put your hands on her shoulders and be like,
honey,
honey,

968
00:57:58.070 --> 00:57:59.930
honey,
grow up.

969
00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:07.460
No,
you can't do it.
Right.
We've known each other since January,

970
00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:11.930
2017 and our marriage was arranged,
not forced,
but arranged.

971
00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.860
All right.
This is like tear and rupture.
What the fuck does that mean?

972
00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:20.120
We both chose to marry each other after our parents allowed us to talk on the

973
00:58:20.121 --> 00:58:24.430
phone for a few months.
Oh,

974
00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:29.100
what the fuck is this?
What?
What?
In what in guide?
Well,
of course she did.

975
00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:29.620
If they left,

976
00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:33.610
if they didn't allow you to talk on the fucking phone the first time,

977
00:58:33.611 --> 00:58:35.430
you poke your head out of the ground.
Yeah,
you're gonna,

978
00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.990
you're gonna marry whatever you do just to get away from those controlling

979
00:58:37.991 --> 00:58:40.000
maniacs.
Anyways,

980
00:58:40.001 --> 00:58:44.380
since we've been together and she's cried more times than I've cried in my life,

981
00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:47.380
including the Times I've cried during my childhood.
Everything.

982
00:58:47.381 --> 00:58:49.330
She's crying because she doesn't want to marry you.

983
00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:50.560
That's what I'd be worried about.

984
00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:55.090
She cries for various different reasons like her little sister annoys her.

985
00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:56.590
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

986
00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:58.870
<v 1>Feels like she's lucky to have me.</v>

987
00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:04.150
Feels like her parents don't value her or she feels like she won't do me proud

988
00:59:04.151 --> 00:59:07.660
as a wife.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

989
00:59:09.050 --> 00:59:11.900
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

990
00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.210
I don't even know what to do with this person.

991
00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:17.890
But you know that you seem like you're from a different part of the world and

992
00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:19.640
different cultures so,
but you,

993
00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:23.530
you do seem annoyed but oh my God,

994
00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:29.920
Jesus fucking Christ.
I,

995
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.090
I think I would start crying.
I just be,
if you,
if you don't stop fucking crying,

996
00:59:33.091 --> 00:59:36.780
I swear to God I'm going to kill myself and that would make her cry even more

997
00:59:36.781 --> 00:59:41.730
and just be like,
what do I have to do?
Okay.

998
00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:42.091
Anyways,

999
00:59:42.091 --> 00:59:46.940
we are definitely getting married is that line has been crossed.

1000
00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:49.100
So cutting it off.

1001
00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:53.630
Is it a possibility to where the fuck are you in the world?

1002
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:57.450
I love her more than you love the freckles on your face,
but,

1003
01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:03.320
but this is crying is wearing me down.

1004
01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:04.580
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1005
01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:08.630
<v 1>well it seems like you still have a sense of humor about it as I have to comfort</v>

1006
01:00:08.631 --> 01:00:13.631
her every time and just stare at her on facetime and she cries at times.

1007
01:00:15.621 --> 01:00:20.570
It just gets super annoying because she does cry over small shit.

1008
01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.660
I got to tell you something.
I don't know this woman and she's already,

1009
01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:26.300
she's annoying the shit out of me.
Anyway,

1010
01:00:26.301 --> 01:00:30.950
she has a busy schedule because she's training to be a teacher.

1011
01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:34.730
Oh God.
I hope she doesn't fucking teach them under privileged kids.

1012
01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.350
She'll have a god damn nervous breakdown.

1013
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.970
Second she starts crying and shows weakness.
It's going to be over anyways,

1014
01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:42.620
getting a Postgrad,

1015
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:48.080
organizing Islamic events,
parentheses,

1016
01:00:48.081 --> 01:00:53.000
no isis jokes please.
And she does an Islamic course at night,

1017
01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:56.510
so I understand that she has shitloads on her plate.

1018
01:00:58.210 --> 01:01:02.590
She's under confident and she feels like she's not the model woman you see on

1019
01:01:02.591 --> 01:01:03.424
Instagram.

1020
01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:08.580
Although I assure her that she is beautiful and I love her just the way she is.

1021
01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:15.100
I really don't know how to deal with this or even approach the situation.

1022
01:01:15.101 --> 01:01:19.450
Sometimes I find that I am avoiding her because I know a lady will lead to

1023
01:01:19.451 --> 01:01:22.990
crying.
And what you have you,
what do you suggest

1024
01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:27.070
your podcast is?
Sex to my ears.

1025
01:01:27.071 --> 01:01:31.720
Nia is awesome and I hope Lola is not giving me a too many sleepless nights.

1026
01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:36.580
Thank you for listening.
Old Bright Bulb.
Beg Billy.
Uh,

1027
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.620
Jesus fucking Christ.

1028
01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:40.000
<v 8>MMM.</v>

1029
01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:44.760
<v 1>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

1030
01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.510
I don't know what to tell you dude.

1031
01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:49.773
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1032
01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:55.110
<v 1>I really,
I really don't know what the fuck to tell you.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.</v>

1033
01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:57.670
I don't know how to solve this.
This is like,

1034
01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:05.380
how do you tell a woman to stop crying in a way that doesn't make them cry more.

1035
01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.430
All right.
Okay.

1036
01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:14.230
You know what I do when my wife is going to cry and I don't think it's that big

1037
01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:16.650
a deal at or I just don't want to deal with it.

1038
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:18.700
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1039
01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.220
<v 1>When she to cry.</v>

1040
01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:27.410
<v 4>I just look at her and I jut out my bottom lip and I make the saddest,</v>

1041
01:02:28.441 --> 01:02:33.000
most pathetic.
Let's just picture like a sad clown.
I make the saddest,

1042
01:02:33.001 --> 01:02:37.440
stupid face,
stupid his face and I looked down while still looking up at her.

1043
01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:42.360
Just imagine that look and it always makes her laugh and she gets fucking mad at

1044
01:02:42.361 --> 01:02:47.361
me because she can't continue crying because they look so fucking ridiculous and

1045
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:48.740
okay.

1046
01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:51.500
<v 1>Another way you could do it is bright.
Before you make that face,</v>

1047
01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:54.580
she'd take a big inhale.
You Go,
Oh man,

1048
01:02:54.590 --> 01:02:56.390
you just make that face and I'm telling you if you,

1049
01:02:56.391 --> 01:03:01.300
if she has a sense of fucking humor,
that's what I would do.

1050
01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.680
I think that's what I would do.
I would just joke my way out of it.

1051
01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:13.360
Anytime she was crying over nothing,
I would start crying with her

1052
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:19.970
like,
I just don't feel that I'm going to be good enough has been for you.

1053
01:03:19.971 --> 01:03:21.410
It'd be like,
oh,
and then I would just be like,

1054
01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:32.450
now you have to know this.
I am a dick.
All right.
But that's what I would do.

1055
01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:36.920
I would just start doing that and what's going to happen is hopefully she'll

1056
01:03:36.921 --> 01:03:39.680
toughen up a little bit.
Um,

1057
01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:42.730
Jesus Christ.

1058
01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:47.760
Do you know how fucking nervous that would make me if a woman was crying because

1059
01:03:47.951 --> 01:03:51.450
she loves me that much and was worried that she wouldn't be a good fucking,

1060
01:03:51.490 --> 01:03:54.190
I would break up with her.
I'd be like,
I can't handle that pressure.

1061
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.280
Jesus.
Chris,
what is going to happen when she finds out?

1062
01:03:59.281 --> 01:04:03.660
I can't fucking read out loud.
A mom's comment on pizza.

1063
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.150
Good luck to you,
sir.
That's what I would do.
I would use humor.

1064
01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:07.950
How would use humor?

1065
01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:12.143
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1066
01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:15.150
<v 1>You know,
next time she goes,
honey,
can I talk to you about something?</v>

1067
01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:20.210
I would have like 40 fucking boxes of Kleenex and just fucking run over with

1068
01:04:22.681 --> 01:04:24.440
like five boxes of Kleenexes.

1069
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:27.060
I would just do something to make it silly and ridiculous

1070
01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:33.300
and then she might get upset that you do that.
I guess I would then say,
uh,

1071
01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:40.210
the fuck would I say.
I would just be honest.
Just say,
listen,
I,

1072
01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:42.980
I,
I love you to death.
But

1073
01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:44.120
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1074
01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.920
<v 1>you delete the amount that you cry.
I don't know how to deal with it.
Yeah.</v>

1075
01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.430
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1076
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:53.630
<v 1>Oh fuck that made you cry.
Jesus Christ.
What do you guys say?
What do you,</v>

1077
01:04:53.631 --> 01:04:56.600
what do you Islamic guys say when you curse?

1078
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:58.000
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1079
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.650
<v 1>What do you,
what do you say instead of Jesus Christ?
What do you,
what do,</v>

1080
01:05:00.651 --> 01:05:05.070
what do you say?
Do you say something?
You Take d,

1081
01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.760
take Muhammad's name in vain.

1082
01:05:06.761 --> 01:05:09.310
Do you do something like that and with the whatever the fuck it is you say,

1083
01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:13.690
I would,
I would be really a,
that would really,

1084
01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:18.940
I mean,
that's a lot.
These fucking letters are a lot this week.

1085
01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:23.740
Okay.
The fucking neighbor,
the God damn fucking Douche bag.

1086
01:05:23.741 --> 01:05:27.310
Who needs an apology for a fucking side hug through two different women?

1087
01:05:27.311 --> 01:05:28.780
He needs to get his apology.

1088
01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:29.993
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1089
01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:31.930
<v 1>That guy is such a pussy.</v>

1090
01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.740
What kind of fucking guy on invites another guy to a fucking wedding as if

1091
01:05:35.741 --> 01:05:38.860
that's some sort of punishment.
He just made his day.
You asshole.

1092
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:43.450
If you really didn't like the side hug,
you should make him fucking go there.
Um,

1093
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:47.350
and then there's the one cool check of fucking boyfriend rights.

1094
01:05:47.351 --> 01:05:50.800
Motorcross all right.
Let's say the other people were cool,

1095
01:05:50.801 --> 01:05:53.980
but could lord wife cries at least three times a week.

1096
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:59.090
I read that it's three times a day.
Three times a week.
That's still a lot.

1097
01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.970
156 times a year.

1098
01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:11.950
That's what I would do.
All right.
Three 65 minus one 56.
Oh Jesus.

1099
01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:17.170
Two 56 to 50.
That's 194 194 days.

1100
01:06:17.171 --> 01:06:21.130
You're not crying.
156 you are.

1101
01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:23.653
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1102
01:06:24.490 --> 01:06:28.300
<v 1>That's like Marty Schottenheimer's lifetime record that like that's the way</v>

1103
01:06:28.301 --> 01:06:31.210
you're crying.
Days you cry versus days you don't,

1104
01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:33.910
and that's not enough to make it in this league.
Okay?

1105
01:06:33.911 --> 01:06:37.360
So I'm going to need you to toughen it up at least two thirds more.

1106
01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:39.550
Why don't you tell us she,

1107
01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:43.630
she's allowed to cry once a week unless something really bad happens.

1108
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:45.583
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1109
01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:48.660
<v 1>Um,
you know,
you could do,</v>

1110
01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:51.100
you could go to the pet store and get one of those shocker college and every

1111
01:06:51.101 --> 01:06:55.450
time she starts to cry just fucking sapper.
Um,
I dunno.

1112
01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:56.410
I Dunno what to tell you.
All right.

1113
01:06:56.411 --> 01:07:00.880
Mom's comment on pizza leads to break up.

1114
01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:07.430
I have no idea where this is going.
All right.
Hey bill weekly listener here.

1115
01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:11.450
Love F is for family and all your standup stuff.
Keep up the good work.

1116
01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.610
My question is what experiences,

1117
01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:15.563
<v 4>okay.</v>

1118
01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:19.480
<v 1>Ah,
good to see you.
Come on in.</v>

1119
01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.720
Come on in

1120
01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:29.290
a knee at this guy's fucking wife.
Christ.
Three times a week.

1121
01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:34.120
Why?
That's hilarious.
Did you guys here?
Then she goes,

1122
01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:36.610
why are you going to cry?

1123
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.400
She cries because she loves him so much.

1124
01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:43.270
<v 9>She just did a spit take.</v>

1125
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:50.110
I swear to God.
She does.

1126
01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:53.900
Yes she does.
Nobody loves somebody that much.
They cry at the,
that was the,

1127
01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:55.930
well this is the thing that they're there.

1128
01:07:55.990 --> 01:08:00.690
They're Islamic and their parents allowed them like,

1129
01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.390
well listen,
knock it off.
Exactly.

1130
01:08:05.650 --> 01:08:09.540
I was telling him what I do when you cry baby at that time when you would cry

1131
01:08:09.541 --> 01:08:11.040
and I just kept making that face.
I go,

1132
01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:17.090
which was not helpful by the way.
It helped me cause I just didn't want to deal.

1133
01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:19.760
You tell me if I'm crying,

1134
01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:22.010
I'm having an emotion about something and I tell you something.

1135
01:08:22.011 --> 01:08:25.730
My job isn't to like checkout and figuring out how to wait for you to deal with

1136
01:08:25.731 --> 01:08:30.470
it.
Your job is to like check in and figure out how I can deal with it.

1137
01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:35.640
Your job was to make me feel better,
not cope for yourself.
God,
you have a,

1138
01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:40.570
sometimes you just don't want to deal with like you know when I know when I

1139
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:44.330
occasionally want to deal just fucking deal being nice person,

1140
01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:45.890
be emotionally open,

1141
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:50.880
don't be a fucking vast wasteland of non emotion.

1142
01:08:50.881 --> 01:08:54.110
Man.
Are you?
Hi.

1143
01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.740
Yes you are.

1144
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:05.030
Nobody cries.
She's lying cause she's not crying that much cause she loves him.

1145
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.450
Can I tell you something like you know,

1146
01:09:08.451 --> 01:09:10.430
occasionally I'll get upset and I go on a rant.

1147
01:09:11.690 --> 01:09:12.990
Wouldn't it be great if he knew how to,

1148
01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:17.120
what your version of that is when you cry?
No,
it is.

1149
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:20.990
No it is no,
don't tell me how I feel.

1150
01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:25.880
Don't tell me how I react to things.
I don't cry.
Like,
don't respond to my,

1151
01:09:25.881 --> 01:09:29.390
don't tell me what your,
don't tell me.
Angry.
I'm angry.
If I'm emotional,

1152
01:09:29.391 --> 01:09:33.530
I'm fucking emotional.
Hey,
can I finish this?
These people are Islamic.

1153
01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:36.430
This is an arranged marriage.
It's,

1154
01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:41.570
it's not forced to listen for fuck sakes.
Can we get old binding them?
Like,

1155
01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.110
all right.

1156
01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:46.940
They actually were allowed to talk on the fucking phone for a few months.
Okay.

1157
01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:51.040
Okay.
So yeah,
these are,
these are fucking,
you know,
this is very respective,

1158
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:55.430
secluded life here.
I got it.
So,
you know,
she's,

1159
01:09:56.410 --> 01:10:01.220
her emotions are at the surface,
so she cries if for little sister annoys her,

1160
01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.010
if she feels she feels she's lucky to have me.

1161
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:09.550
Feels like her parents don't value her or she feels like she won't do me proud

1162
01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:14.900
as a wife.
Oh.
So whenever she's having emotions basically,

1163
01:10:14.901 --> 01:10:18.500
right.
What's a good way to be like,
honey,
I love you to death,

1164
01:10:18.501 --> 01:10:21.680
but could you fucking knock it off because you're driving me crazy?

1165
01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:25.910
How do you say that to a woman without making her cry more?

1166
01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:29.840
Uh,
I mean,
yeah,

1167
01:10:29.841 --> 01:10:34.670
she seems like she would cry if you told him.
If you told her like,
you know,

1168
01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:38.750
I don't know.
The t was not sweet enough,
so she's definitely a sensitive,

1169
01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:43.820
I told him to start crying too.
Like she's just like,

1170
01:10:43.821 --> 01:10:45.350
I'm just worried.
I was like,

1171
01:10:47.130 --> 01:10:51.140
and I was thinking that she would get mad the probably because if she did it

1172
01:10:51.141 --> 01:10:54.380
like that,
cause that's it.
Then she stops crying.
Hey,

1173
01:10:54.381 --> 01:10:57.950
hang in here for this last one.
Is that me?
No,
I don't know.
Honestly,

1174
01:10:57.951 --> 01:11:00.860
I have no idea what I can tell you as a man,
when a woman cries,

1175
01:11:00.861 --> 01:11:05.380
all we want you to do is to stop crying.
We don't give a fuck.
Yes.

1176
01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:08.120
Completely fucking selfish when it comes to our emotions.
Yeah.

1177
01:11:08.121 --> 01:11:11.120
We know you're selfish when I yelled,
that's an emotion.

1178
01:11:11.121 --> 01:11:16.050
You want me to stop yelling,
yelling,
like hearing somebody yell constantly.

1179
01:11:16.051 --> 01:11:17.680
It's like traumatic.
Okay.

1180
01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:21.240
When somebody cry all the time is also traumatic.

1181
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:24.300
It's like you're watching a sad movie that never ends.
It is.
No,

1182
01:11:24.301 --> 01:11:29.170
that would be a real,
she sounds like a real drip,
you know Jesus.
All right.

1183
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:35.430
Well what can he do?
I don't know.
Oh boy.

1184
01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:37.350
Oh boy,
buddy.

1185
01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:41.960
It sounds like that's just kinda how she is.
I mean,

1186
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:45.060
I don't know if your religion allows you to do this,

1187
01:11:45.061 --> 01:11:49.590
but I would get some Bose wireless headphones,
the noise canceling ones.

1188
01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:50.730
Whenever she starts crying,

1189
01:11:50.731 --> 01:11:53.610
I just put them on and put on your favorite fucking music.

1190
01:11:53.611 --> 01:11:56.460
Can you ask her dad or her mom or whatever?
Like just,

1191
01:11:56.461 --> 01:12:00.210
I just feel like she's very sensitive.
She cries easily,
you know?

1192
01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.720
Is that,
yeah.
I don't know.
I wouldn't do that,

1193
01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:07.120
but they finally let her talk on the fucking phone and then you're going to come

1194
01:12:07.121 --> 01:12:11.340
and be like,
yeah,
you know?
Can you tweak it a little bit this way?
Anyway,
mom,

1195
01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:13.980
mom's comment on pizza leads to break up.

1196
01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:18.270
Hey bill weekly listener loveF is for family and all your standup stuff.

1197
01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:22.530
Keep up the good work.
All right.
My question is,

1198
01:12:22.531 --> 01:12:27.330
what experiences have you had with dating while going through our of,
hey,

1199
01:12:27.331 --> 01:12:29.520
a rough time with your professional career?

1200
01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.280
Bill has never dated anyone besides me.

1201
01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:35.220
I'm the only woman in his life that matters and I really don't appreciate you

1202
01:12:35.221 --> 01:12:38.820
asking about the people that came before me.
I gotta tell you something.

1203
01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:42.450
I dated a lot of great women,
lot of Hardee's.

1204
01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:47.210
There were absolute animals in the rack.
Uh,

1205
01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:51.810
my girlfriend and I dated for three years and recently decided to go on a break.

1206
01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:54.690
Yeah,
right.
You're breaking up a,
we met in law school,

1207
01:12:54.691 --> 01:12:58.410
both graduated with good grades and each pass the bar exam.

1208
01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:03.180
The big difference between us is that she got a job right after graduation with

1209
01:13:03.181 --> 01:13:07.950
the high salary,
insane benefits and located in a wealthy suburb.

1210
01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:12.030
This was largely due to a family connection,
which she openly admits.
Yeah,

1211
01:13:12.031 --> 01:13:14.400
good for her.
Use your connection.
Meanwhile,

1212
01:13:14.401 --> 01:13:18.750
I hope to get hired by a firm I worked at during my final year of law school,

1213
01:13:18.930 --> 01:13:23.250
but was told that the last minute that none of the interns would be hired you

1214
01:13:23.251 --> 01:13:26.460
fucking cunts.
Oh my God.

1215
01:13:26.461 --> 01:13:29.220
After he sat there going through their card catalog and one of the fuck it is

1216
01:13:29.221 --> 01:13:31.020
you guys do.
As a result.

1217
01:13:32.370 --> 01:13:37.350
I've been living with my parents for the past three months,
making money,

1218
01:13:37.351 --> 01:13:42.270
teaching tennis lessons while sending resumes and traveling for interviews all

1219
01:13:42.271 --> 01:13:43.104
over the state.

1220
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:47.550
The decision for a break came when my girlfriend was visiting me at my parents'

1221
01:13:47.551 --> 01:13:48.150
house.

1222
01:13:48.150 --> 01:13:52.830
She and I went out for pizza and came back with some leftovers by girlfriend,

1223
01:13:52.831 --> 01:13:57.150
put the pizza in the fridge.
But my mom,
who has a heavy Russian accent,

1224
01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:01.620
told her that putting the pizza in the fridge destroys the flavor.

1225
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:06.480
I did not even bat an eye at the interaction and went to the couch to watch a

1226
01:14:06.481 --> 01:14:10.020
hockey game.
These guys live in the life.
He's living at home.

1227
01:14:10.021 --> 01:14:14.290
He's teaching tennis,
he's watching hockey's eating pizza.
I love this guy's life.

1228
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:19.210
After an evening of my girlfriend moping around,
I asked her what was wrong.

1229
01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.140
According to her,

1230
01:14:20.141 --> 01:14:25.120
I failed to stand up for her and it was supposed to tell my mom to not speak to

1231
01:14:25.121 --> 01:14:28.090
her that way.
Well,
in defense of her,

1232
01:14:28.810 --> 01:14:31.850
not to put the pizza in the fridge.
Yeah,

1233
01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:36.310
but in defense of her though,
the Russian accent is a little harsh.

1234
01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:37.780
They can't help it.

1235
01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:41.050
Even when they're being like happy and friendly towards each other,

1236
01:14:41.051 --> 01:14:43.450
they sound like they're screaming at each other.
They want to murder each other.

1237
01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:46.630
Yeah.
That they're going to send you to the fucking gulag.
Don't get mad at me.

1238
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:49.870
You know that shit is true and like think about your grandparents and your aunts

1239
01:14:49.871 --> 01:14:51.450
and your uncles,
like when you went in the room,

1240
01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:54.150
nobody gets mad at anything on this podcast Neah I have,

1241
01:14:54.210 --> 01:14:58.400
I have curated some of the dumbest people on this planet and we all just sit in

1242
01:14:58.401 --> 01:15:02.200
there fucking bubble of stupidity,
enjoying all of this.
All right.

1243
01:15:02.201 --> 01:15:06.730
After an evening of my girlfriend moping around,
I asked her what was wrong.

1244
01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:07.980
Okay.
Coordinator.

1245
01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:12.650
What I failed to stand up for him was supposed to tell my mom to not speak to

1246
01:15:12.651 --> 01:15:16.160
her that way.
I know my mom could sound a little harsh with her accent.
Yeah,

1247
01:15:16.161 --> 01:15:18.650
there you go.
And sometimes uses incorrect words.

1248
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:23.690
Use your imagination when speaking English,

1249
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:26.450
but the two have always had a good relationship,

1250
01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:29.480
so there was no reason to think she would be upset by the comment.

1251
01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:34.510
This started an argument about how I've become a mama's boy.
Oh boy.
Oh,

1252
01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.350
she went there and that I'm not,

1253
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:41.480
and then I'm not desperate enough to move out of the house.

1254
01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:44.400
<v 10>Ooh,</v>

1255
01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:47.330
<v 9>somebody is going to throw a chair soon.</v>

1256
01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:52.440
These comments really pissed me off because she has personally seen the amount

1257
01:15:52.441 --> 01:15:55.500
of hard work and long hours I put into my schoolwork,
internship,

1258
01:15:55.710 --> 01:16:00.660
passing the bar exam,
and not to mention she got a hookup and sending out resume.

1259
01:16:00.661 --> 01:16:01.231
Additionally,

1260
01:16:01.231 --> 01:16:06.231
this came a day after I was informed that I was close a close second for a job I

1261
01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:10.290
was excited about potentially receiving.
Yeah,
so this is it.
Yeah.

1262
01:16:10.291 --> 01:16:13.650
You seen branches,
you know,
land is coming.
You like Christopher Columbus.

1263
01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:19.660
MMM.
Nia was commenting on this all natural ginger Ale.

1264
01:16:19.690 --> 01:16:23.500
I actually like it,
but really quickly,
can I just ask a quick question?

1265
01:16:23.530 --> 01:16:26.990
Do you consider a Ginger Ale soda?
I think that as we do,

1266
01:16:26.991 --> 01:16:30.140
I consider ginger ale offensive and offensive name.

1267
01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:35.930
Do you consider Ginger Ale soda?
Yes.
You do?
Yes.

1268
01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:38.990
Yeah.
People that follow me on Twitter on know what I'm talking about.

1269
01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:42.950
I did a poll on Twitter because I realized that I don't consider a Ginger Ale

1270
01:16:42.951 --> 01:16:46.070
soda.
Well,
it's because you only drink it when you have,

1271
01:16:46.730 --> 01:16:50.450
when your stomach's,
not everybody was saying to me,
but you know,

1272
01:16:50.451 --> 01:16:54.350
I'm obsessed with Ginger Ale so I drink it all the time.

1273
01:16:54.650 --> 01:16:59.330
But people seem to,
yeah.
Why don't you consider it soda?
Oh No,

1274
01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:04.000
I have no idea.
I consider soda like coke and orange.

1275
01:17:04.001 --> 01:17:07.800
Do you consider an apple a fruit?
No.
Why not?

1276
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:11.630
I don't know.
I know it's super obvious,

1277
01:17:11.631 --> 01:17:15.080
but I just never made the connection that it would be soda.

1278
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:19.370
If you said that on a first date,
I there would be no second date.
That'd be like,

1279
01:17:19.371 --> 01:17:23.750
this is the fucking Bimbo.
Jesus.

1280
01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:28.350
I thought I was dumb.
Yeah,
that's okay.
I can look.

1281
01:17:28.351 --> 01:17:30.260
That reminds you that.
That's why.
That's a story of the pockets.

1282
01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:31.820
That girl one time like,
hey,

1283
01:17:31.821 --> 01:17:34.760
you want to go out and you want to go grab some Sushi or something some night?

1284
01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.160
Oh my God,
I love Sushi.

1285
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:40.520
But one time I ate it every day for like a month.

1286
01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:45.190
And what do you call the white party?
Or I am like,
ah,
the white party,
your eye.

1287
01:17:45.230 --> 01:17:49.880
She goes,
yeah,
it turned all yellow.
And I was like,
Hey,

1288
01:17:49.881 --> 01:17:51.770
bitch had jaundice.
Yes.

1289
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:55.670
And I conveniently had another call coming in that I had to take.

1290
01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:59.390
Um,
well,
but even if you thought it was a bimbo,

1291
01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:03.470
I still try to go out with it still means like you are attracted to me.

1292
01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:07.670
I still tried to go out with her though.
She was an underwear model.

1293
01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:12.600
She modeled me undies,
me undies though.
She did.
Um,
so anyway,

1294
01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:17.570
uh,
pizza,
sorry to interrupt.
Okay.
Uh,
additionally,
okay.
Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1295
01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:21.080
This came up.
So the guy was excited.
Where am I suspect the real situations.

1296
01:18:21.081 --> 01:18:26.081
My girlfriend has an image of who her partner is and saw potential in me meeting

1297
01:18:26.241 --> 01:18:29.300
that image someday.
But right now I'm not living up to that image.

1298
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:34.750
It's like she's an NFL GM and I am the potential franchise quarterback who still

1299
01:18:35.421 --> 01:18:39.170
needs to work on his arm strength before becoming the starter in her eyes,

1300
01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:43.790
boozing it up like Johnny football instead of hitting the gym.
Um,

1301
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:44.870
I gotta tell you some dude,

1302
01:18:44.871 --> 01:18:49.871
I'd let this girl go and I have to say something to do not fall in love with

1303
01:18:50.601 --> 01:18:55.450
potential and is a trap.
No,
no.
She,
well she's,
she's phone.

1304
01:18:56.610 --> 01:18:59.600
That's what I'm saying is for her to like fall in love with his potential is not

1305
01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:04.250
a good idea.
So it's really about,
that's the end of the question.
Yeah.

1306
01:19:04.251 --> 01:19:06.950
He kind of knocked it off too.
I know.
I gotta be honest with you.

1307
01:19:06.951 --> 01:19:09.530
I actually thought this guy was going to do better with the question.

1308
01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:13.670
I believe in his potential for this question,
but I didn't go nowhere.

1309
01:19:14.050 --> 01:19:17.490
She your grow,
I think you grow couch.
Oh,
I was gonna say,

1310
01:19:17.491 --> 01:19:21.470
I think you grow from making a point here.
Yeah.

1311
01:19:21.471 --> 01:19:23.750
So clearly it's not about the pizza.

1312
01:19:24.170 --> 01:19:29.170
It's about like the bigger picture for him and where he's at in her life and

1313
01:19:29.241 --> 01:19:30.530
she's not,
she's like,

1314
01:19:30.531 --> 01:19:35.300
she's a spoiled Brat who just got a job gifted to her so she doesn't understand

1315
01:19:35.301 --> 01:19:38.310
why she's still like good at it though.
Right?
Like it's,

1316
01:19:38.311 --> 01:19:41.300
it's not as if she just got it and she sucks at it.
I know,

1317
01:19:41.301 --> 01:19:42.350
but you know something he didn't,

1318
01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:45.510
he didn't say that he brought that up cause I would have brought that up still.

1319
01:19:45.511 --> 01:19:48.440
And what I'm saying,
I'm sorry,
I don't fucking come from the Goddamn Walden's.

1320
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:51.680
What are the,
who's a big lawyer family on TV with a Waltons lawyers.

1321
01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:56.780
Cliff Huxtable was,
did you ever watch the wall?
No.
Sorry,
Claire House.

1322
01:19:57.590 --> 01:20:01.300
The Waltons was the Cosby show for white people.
What is the Waltons,

1323
01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:03.740
it's just a bunch of fucking rednecks.

1324
01:20:03.741 --> 01:20:07.710
Living in an old farmhouse is like 90 of them.
They all have fucking overalls.

1325
01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:08.640
Sounds terrible.

1326
01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:14.430
What do you have against white people and overall fucking dilapidated buildings?

1327
01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:18.810
Can I jump boy?
Yeah.

1328
01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:23.760
Didn't I do whoever good nights.
Yeah.
Good,
good,
good night.

1329
01:20:23.761 --> 01:20:26.940
Mary sue.
All right.
Barbara Jo.
Goodnight.
John Boy.

1330
01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:29.580
John boy who was John Boy.

1331
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:33.390
John boy was like the fucking oldest dude on,
he was like a man.

1332
01:20:33.391 --> 01:20:36.810
He was like a young man,
but he was a boy.
John Boy.

1333
01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:40.940
It's his dad John Too.
And he's John Man.
He's John Man.

1334
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:46.140
It's job.
We're not answering this guy's question.
I is the question.

1335
01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:50.580
There is no question but I think he just wants me to comment on the situation.

1336
01:20:50.581 --> 01:20:54.860
I have no idea,
but I would just say that,
um,

1337
01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:59.470
I would like bitch,
why don't you support me when I'm down.
How about you?

1338
01:20:59.471 --> 01:21:02.110
How about your potential to be a loving and supportive spouse?

1339
01:21:02.111 --> 01:21:03.640
Like why are you kicking me when I'm down?

1340
01:21:03.641 --> 01:21:05.740
Like don't you think that I'm trying to make it happen?

1341
01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:08.830
Don't you think I want to impress you.
Don't you think I want to be like,

1342
01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:12.320
you know the man that like you know is,

1343
01:21:12.321 --> 01:21:14.950
is everything that you've ever dreamed of.
I'm having a hard time right now.

1344
01:21:14.951 --> 01:21:19.360
Like you know that fucking four hour debate when you could just break up with

1345
01:21:19.361 --> 01:21:21.700
somebody.
I see too many red flags here.

1346
01:21:22.930 --> 01:21:26.560
Too many fucking red flags there.
First of all,
they're both lawyers.

1347
01:21:27.490 --> 01:21:28.030
Okay.

1348
01:21:28.030 --> 01:21:32.440
You can argue it out all night long since they're going to be competitive there

1349
01:21:32.441 --> 01:21:34.770
were in the same fucking field.
Then is boasting.

1350
01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:39.780
Then she gets fucking pregnant and like who the fuck puts their fucking practice

1351
01:21:40.001 --> 01:21:44.730
on hold?
You know you would have to obviously if she's carrying a baby,

1352
01:21:44.731 --> 01:21:48.480
like that's Kinda how it goes.
Yeah.
Like she should be loving.
So she's like,

1353
01:21:48.481 --> 01:21:51.150
so get your shit together.
Because eventually when we have a family,

1354
01:21:51.151 --> 01:21:53.310
I'm going to have to take time off.
Fuck debts.
She,

1355
01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:57.300
she seems like the Alpha male here in this and I think that she's going to want

1356
01:21:57.301 --> 01:22:00.390
to keep working and then this guy can,

1357
01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:04.500
this guy can just fucking chill out with the kids teaching tennis.

1358
01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:10.140
Yeah.
I mean,
it's not like he doesn't have a job.
He's looking for a job.

1359
01:22:10.141 --> 01:22:13.440
He almost got one.
Okay,
well keep at it.

1360
01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.150
Keep your chin up.

1361
01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:22.470
I Dunno both of these people's on annoying.
Why?
How is he annoying?

1362
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:26.850
Both annoying.
He's like,
I'm playing tennis,
I'm doing my best.
And she's like,

1363
01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:31.620
get it to,
he's teaching tennis,
whatever.
He's trying and he's making money.
Yeah.

1364
01:22:31.621 --> 01:22:32.910
But she had to play it to teach it.

1365
01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:34.770
<v 0>Ooh.</v>

1366
01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:41.890
<v 9>You're like killing in your own head right now.</v>

1367
01:22:41.891 --> 01:22:45.860
I don't know what's going on with you.
You find yourself very amusing.
All right.

1368
01:22:48.210 --> 01:22:50.440
Right.
You know something.
All right.

1369
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:54.370
I almost started crying like that guy's fucking PR potential.

1370
01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:59.380
his wife.
Um,

That is the podcast.
I don't know if I helped anybody.

1371
01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:00.910
I don't even know when I talked about,

1372
01:23:01.450 --> 01:23:05.470
I want to thank everybody who came out in Albuquerque and people who came in

1373
01:23:05.471 --> 01:23:08.380
Tucson,
Arizona.

1375
01:23:11.711 --> 01:23:13.680
Like people is like an audible like no.

1376
01:23:13.681 --> 01:23:17.680
And he's one his fucking sets over to knowing he's making me work out there.

1377
01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:21.970
He's crushing it.
A Dean's the best.
Uh,

1378
01:23:21.971 --> 01:23:26.971
and I will be with Dean next Sunday night and Santa fucking Barbara said,

1379
01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:34.050
I want to go and go out and spend the money that you're earning and go look at

1380
01:23:34.451 --> 01:23:38.830

Fuck you.
Fuck you and has nothing to do.

1381
01:23:38.831 --> 01:23:40.510
And what do you want to do in Santa Barbara?

1382
01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:43.960
I want to go and hang out and see Santa Barbara is and how much does that cost?

1383
01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:48.340
It doesn't cost anything for me to like see cause I'm paying for it.

1384
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:51.880
Paying for what exactly the trip to Santa Barbara.

1385
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:55.690
You are working in Santa Barbara and I'm tagging along with you like what is the

1386
01:23:55.691 --> 01:23:58.180
problem and you just don't want,
you don't want me to cramp your style.

1387
01:23:58.370 --> 01:23:59.460
What do you and dean going to go?

1388
01:23:59.490 --> 01:24:03.370
Go Do's like skipping to the vineyards together and I go to a fucking brothel.

1389
01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:05.290
What do you think we're going to do?
Well again,

1390
01:24:05.291 --> 01:24:08.020
you're going to be there and be like,
oop,
you wear a condom.

1391
01:24:08.170 --> 01:24:10.300
I don't need that shit.
Listen,

1392
01:24:10.301 --> 01:24:14.200
if you can try to with that fucking second grade manipulation to try to turn the

1393
01:24:14.201 --> 01:24:17.920
conversation into that goddamn direction.
I'm just going to stare into it.
Nia,

1394
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:21.490
why wouldn't I be able to come to Santa Barbara?
It's a beautiful place.

1395
01:24:21.491 --> 01:24:24.040
I haven't been there in years like what is the problem?

1396
01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:28.810
I'll tell you what the problem is because fuck you.
Fuck me.
Why?

1397
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:33.250
Because you only see cause you only support me when I go to fun places.

1398
01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:37.930
You're never there when I need you.
When I go to,
when I got to Sacramento,

1399
01:24:37.931 --> 01:24:41.370
you never want to tag along.
I would potentially go to Sacramento.

1400
01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:43.870
I mean it is the capital of what?

1401
01:24:49.630 --> 01:24:53.560
Why would I go to a not fun city?
Like why would I do that?

1402
01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:58.990
Why would I need you to come along to a fun city?
I'm already having fun.

1403
01:24:59.110 --> 01:25:00.940
You love when I come on the row with you.

1404
01:25:00.941 --> 01:25:03.120
That's why I traveled so much with you before us and he had,

1405
01:25:03.121 --> 01:25:07.690
these are things I say to keep the relationship going fronting on your podcast

1406
01:25:07.691 --> 01:25:10.470
like I that you don't enjoy me being there with you and you're on the road

1407
01:25:10.650 --> 01:25:11.800
[inaudible] the road.

1408
01:25:11.801 --> 01:25:16.801
Who is you ooze a baby like you're so and your sewing,

1409
01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:22.060
controlling your just like the man of the family.
Wait a minute,

1410
01:25:22.061 --> 01:25:26.080
wait a minute.
Love when I'm there with you on the road.

1411
01:25:26.081 --> 01:25:30.610
So knock it off.
Timeout.
Timeout.
You're talking a lot of shit.

1412
01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:34.060
I didn't get lonely on the road like this until I had a daughter.

1413
01:25:34.690 --> 01:25:39.220
Oh my God.
Are you,
are you see when I did a three week fucking run,

1414
01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:43.960
are you suggesting that you were not lonely on the road before we had a
daughter?

1415
01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:46.120
Are you saying for the most part,
yeah.

1416
01:25:46.450 --> 01:25:50.200
You didn't miss me when you're on the road for the most part,
yes.
So,
oh,

1417
01:25:50.201 --> 01:25:54.460
so then who are you lying to you?
You so you feel better.

1418
01:25:54.670 --> 01:25:58.300
That's completely untrue.
Have you ever seen what I do on the road?

1419
01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:01.450
I go to steams.
I go to games,
I'm hanging out with my friends.

1420
01:26:01.451 --> 01:26:03.280
I'm riding on a bus.
It's fucking tremendous.

1421
01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:06.350
The whole game thing is you got to make your wife feel like you're not having a

1422
01:26:06.351 --> 01:26:10.100
good time out there.
She's going to get upset.
Are you serious?

1423
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:15.460
A lot of the times,
yeah.
Why?
No,
but now that,

1424
01:26:15.461 --> 01:26:18.480
now that I have a kid,
it's different.
So you,

1425
01:26:18.490 --> 01:26:20.920
so you never miss me when you were on the road,

1426
01:26:20.921 --> 01:26:24.060
all those nights as you called me and said you were lonely.
It was,

1427
01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:27.600
I was here and you saw something funny and you're sending me a lot of those

1428
01:26:27.601 --> 01:26:31.170
times which just all day and text messages all day like I miss you,

1429
01:26:31.171 --> 01:26:34.110
check this out.
Isn't this funny,
blah,
blah,
blah blah.
And like you,

1430
01:26:34.410 --> 01:26:38.550
that was a lot of those times.
A lot of the times it's bullshit.

1431
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.700
Almost 15 years.
It's all been bullshit.
Not all,

1432
01:26:41.701 --> 01:26:44.260
but a lot of it is bullshit and I'm fully,
yeah,

1433
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:47.540
that's how you do the road as a guy.
I don't believe you.

1434
01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:52.340
I will never trust you again.
If this is true.
You got to say it.

1435
01:26:52.341 --> 01:26:55.340
I'm going to Milwaukee.
I'm seeing the Henry Winkler statue.

1436
01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:57.380
I'm going Fonzie,

1437
01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:01.160
I'm going to the fucking the Harley Davidson Museum.

1438
01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:04.520
They have a statue of him.
Why?
What did he do?

1439
01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:08.690
Cause happy days was filmed in front of a live audience to the audience there.

1440
01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:12.680
But it's Oregon's rocky.
And do they really have a statue of him?

1441
01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:14.793
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1442
01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.460
<v 9>Seems like a waste of a statue.</v>

1443
01:27:24.330 --> 01:27:25.163
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1444
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:28.800
<v 9>It's like the funniest thing ever.
Oh,
waste of a statue.</v>

1445
01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.640
The statue could have been something else.

1446
01:27:31.641 --> 01:27:34.620
So what are you going to chop the head off and put fucking Merv Griffin's head

1447
01:27:34.621 --> 01:27:35.710
on there?
Wait a minute.

1448
01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:40.120
Is that character that iconic that it deserves its own statue.

1449
01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:41.560
A that guy.

1450
01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:50.700
That's why I love Bill Waukee.
That's why I love Milwaukee.

1451
01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:55.560
That's why I love Milwaukee's cause it's,
it's a city.

1452
01:27:55.561 --> 01:27:59.460
But it's small town.
Oh my God.
Milwaukee,
you got to do better.

1453
01:28:06.010 --> 01:28:10.480
Oh,
Nia.
So me,
that's one of my favorite fucking cities.

1454
01:28:11.570 --> 01:28:11.810
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1455
01:28:11.810 --> 01:28:14.960
<v 9>I love Milwaukee.
Milwaukee.
You're okay with me?</v>

1456
01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:19.530
All right.
Yeah,
this is the,
of course I miss you on the road.
I love you.

1457
01:28:19.531 --> 01:28:21.120
I love our daughter.
But this,

1458
01:28:21.121 --> 01:28:24.540
there's times where I'm really having a good fucking time out there.

1459
01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:30.230
So you have to text.
Hey honey,
I'm thinking about you.
I'm not thinking about you.

1460
01:28:30.231 --> 01:28:32.090
I'm,
I'm watching an SCC football.
I,

1461
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.960
I sometimes forget I'm married when I'm at those games.
I get it.

1462
01:28:36.961 --> 01:28:38.400
You don't have to keep like,
you know,

1463
01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:41.940
don't because you went so hard the other way.
Go the
like,

1464
01:28:41.941 --> 01:28:46.900
I was so fucking pansy.
Yeah.

1465
01:28:46.970 --> 01:28:51.530
You were like,
you love me,
you miss me now I get it.
So it was self serving.

1466
01:28:51.650 --> 01:28:54.140
Obviously you're having fun on the road,
like you and you know,

1467
01:28:54.141 --> 01:28:58.610
text me pictures of you and Paul Versey and Joe Barton.
Nick like arm's length,

1468
01:28:58.611 --> 01:29:02.700
you know,
skipping into an arena of some sort.
Like,
so I get it.
I understand.

1469
01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:07.800
That's our tradition.
We always skipping
your breath.

1470
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:12.020
Yeah.
I fucking ran a helicopter.
I fly myself to Vegas.
It's fucking,

1471
01:29:12.021 --> 01:29:15.060
it's a good time.
It's a good God damn time.
All right.

1472
01:29:15.061 --> 01:29:18.360
This podcast is way too fucking long.
It's an hour and a half long run,
right?

1473
01:29:19.290 --> 01:29:22.530
I okay.
Can we apologize to till the city of Milwaukee?

1474
01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:27.620
