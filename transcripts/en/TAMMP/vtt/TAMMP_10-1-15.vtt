1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.460
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:07.620
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcasts.

3
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.170
I'm sorry about the recording here I am in Washington DC and I forgot to bring

4
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:23.721
my laptop because I did not pack the night before because I went out with some

5
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:28.010
friends and we hung out and I was like,
Oh,
you know,

6
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.020
I'm only leaving for a couple of days.
I just wake up the morning,

7
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:34.890
throw a couple of shirts or pants and a fucking backpack and I'll be fine.

8
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.820
And uh,
you know,
it didn't work out and I forgot my fucking laptop.

9
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:41.310
So if you're listening to this right now,
it's on a Thursday.

10
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:45.600
It's a fucking miracle because somehow I figured out how to download the Dropbox

11
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:49.930
APP and send this thing to my fucking,
uh,
Mike,

12
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.330
my good friend Andrew to put this thing up.
Um,
so we'll see.

13
00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:57.480
And I've already made an attempted this and it was really quiet and then the

14
00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:00.720
screen wants to screen,
cuts out the recording stops.

15
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.340
So occasionally I have to touch the fucking screen to keep this thing going.

16
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:09.210
So in other words,
it's going to be a really fucked up podcast here.
All right?

17
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:12.570
So just hang in there with me.
That's all I need you to do is hang in here.

18
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.290
And by the way,
I'm going to give you guys a couple of travel tips.
All right?

19
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.000
A lot of people go out and they buy those stupid bows fucking headsets,

20
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.990
those noise canceling things where somehow it,

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.240
it mimics the frequency of whatever the fuck is going on in the,

22
00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:31.920
the area around you.
So then you can't hear anything.
Um,

23
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.970
you know,
so then you ear doesn't vibrate.
I have no fucking idea.

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.210
Or is your vibrating like a motherfucker?
You just can't hear it right now.

25
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.450
I have no idea.
But all I know is there a lot of fucking money.

26
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.890
Just go get yourself some plugs.
Tiny stick.
Jamson fucking ear plugs.

27
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.700
I brought some this morning and I was so psyched that I did because I got on the

28
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:52.440
flight and there was this store,

29
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:55.590
this God bless her and I know you're not supposed to call them stewardess.

30
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.720
All right?
You're not supposed to call him that.
What?

31
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:01.830
He's supposed to call him now.
Huh?
What was flight attendance?

32
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:04.080
Is that we supposed to call them?
That's right.
You know why?

33
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:08.850
Because stewardess was a,
uh,
it was a,
it was a racial slur back in the day,

34
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.253
you know?

35
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>

36
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.570
<v 0>Don't,
don't,</v>

37
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.700
those were fighting words and they had to march on Washington and all is what

38
00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:17.350
the fuck was wrong with stewardess?

39
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.090
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

40
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.320
<v 0>Flight attendant,
flight attendant,
you know,
like you helping somebody fly.</v>

41
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.173
<v 2>You're not,</v>

42
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.510
<v 0>you know,
you're,
you're,
you're a,
you're a fucking maitre d slash waitress.</v>

43
00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:36.430
You multitasking.
Alright.
Stewardess,
maitre d and waitress,
euro,

44
00:02:36.431 --> 00:02:40.520
euro,
uh,
a matress,
whatever the fuck you was.

45
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:43.810
So this lady's on the plane,
right?
This lady,
God bless her,
she's sweet as hell,

46
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.380
but she's just super fucking Nice.
Super fucking chatty.

47
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.430
She won't shut the fuck up.
All right.
And she's annoying the shit out of me,

48
00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:55.360
but I got my earplugs.
She was,
you know,
those,
those stewardesses that they just,

49
00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:59.020
they just lack,
like I,
they just,
they just go into mental.

50
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.710
<v 2>Okay.</v>

51
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.000
<v 0>You know,
as they go row to row to row.</v>

52
00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:06.630
And then if they're asking basically the same question,
you know,

53
00:03:06.631 --> 00:03:09.640
would you like some snacks?
You know what I mean?
They,

54
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.890
they have an inability to improvise that line.
Like,
would you like some snacks?

55
00:03:13.891 --> 00:03:18.480
Excuse me,
snacks,
snacks,
anybody.
Hey,
how you doing?
I've got some snacks.
You know,

56
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.150
they got there,
I just banged out five rows,
did not have a problem.

57
00:03:21.151 --> 00:03:24.120
I could have done another 15 before I repeated.
But you know,

58
00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:27.030
the stewardesses or male stewardess,
this whatever the fuck they are,

59
00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:30.090
we have an inability to do that.
This is what I had.

60
00:03:30.091 --> 00:03:34.260
And she had a fucking super annoying voice and she was handing out this survey

61
00:03:34.261 --> 00:03:37.060
thing to everybody and she was just going down the aisle.

62
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.850
She's coming from behind me.
I just kept hearing pride in me.

63
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.540
Pardon me?

64
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.680
Pardon me?
And um,
she finally comes up to me and she goes,
pardon me?

65
00:03:51.681 --> 00:03:56.060
And it's like,
well,
are you trying to get by?
Like what do you fucking saying?

66
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.990
Right.
Why didn't you fucking saying pardon me?
Pardon me?
Why do you keep saying,

67
00:03:59.991 --> 00:04:04.280
pardon me the exact same way?
Pardon me?
Um,

68
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.560
and then finally somebody didn't respond to her and she went,
pardon me,

69
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.830
would you like to fill out our survey?
She was doing that.

70
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.510
The whole fucking flight.
What was killing me was I was,
well,

71
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.730
I seem to be the only person getting annoyed by her because everybody else just

72
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:24.550
kept talking to her,
kept asking her questions,

73
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.240
and then he had to hear her annoying fucking voice and I just want to yell out,

74
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:32.680
will you stop fucking talking to it?
Just let it go button.
I it.
Yeah.

75
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.030
That's why I said it.
Just let it fucking go by.
Get it Outta here.

76
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.800
Don't engage.

77
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.620
I was literally treatment the way used to treat like when I was living in New

78
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.860
York,
how you treat it.
Crazy person.
The second that came on your subway car,

79
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.080
the fucking rule was don't look at it,

80
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.920
don't look at it and it won't see you and it'll go right by you become fucking

81
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:53.350
invisible.
But the second you make eye contact,

82
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.030
it's over and his fucking jerk off in front of me.
You know,
goals.

83
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:02.440
This is what they offer on United.
I haven't flown United in a while.
Bill.

84
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.340
Really like you're a professional passenger.
You dumb.

85
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:07.780
Fuck nobody cares.

86
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.370
Nobody cares that you know what the fucking snacks are on Piedmont and whatever

87
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:16.180
the fuck you fly.
Transworld they are.
I'm the retreads world.

88
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:19.080
There are usually some good and on the apple.
Um,

89
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.380
of course he's right in front of me and I was just staring daggers into the back

90
00:05:23.381 --> 00:05:24.490
of his head.
But anyways,

91
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:27.220
I can't really complain about her because she was super nice,

92
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:30.850
but her voice was so fucking annoying and she would just be like,
wow.

93
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.170
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

94
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.650
<v 0>Wow,
wow.</v>

95
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.590
Oh,
I know.
Five fucking hours or that the only way to describe it,

96
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.270
do you guys ever see that movie misery?

97
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.080
Imagine if that movie was rated g right?

98
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.000
Like she wasn't fucking like Sonya feed off like she did in the book or just

99
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:55.360
broke your ankles in the movies.
Right.
She wasn't doing that shit,

100
00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.320
but just like James Caan,
you couldn't fucking leave.
You were trapped,

101
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.110
you know,
but it's ready to g it's only for five fucking hours.

102
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:05.420
It's exactly what it was.
Like,
you know,

103
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.600
I was sweeping and at one point when I opened my eyes,

104
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:12.110
I thought she was going to be right in my face.
Like that fucking lady there,

105
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:16.100
whatever her name is.
Elizabeth Cole Harrington.
What was the name of that?

106
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:19.970
She's a fucking great ass Elizabeth base.
Nancy base.
Why don't think Elizabeth?

107
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.740
Because she looks like Elizabeth.
Um,

108
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.530
same way I look like a skippy.
Let's plow ahead here.

109
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.260
So anyways,
he finally fucking land.
Um,
you know it was great.

110
00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:38.760
Two was the Wifi did not work on the plane.
Why the fuck you would want?

111
00:06:38.761 --> 00:06:43.650
Why fly?
You're already closer to the sun.
You're already getting radiated.

112
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.450
Let's fucking add a satellite.

113
00:06:45.451 --> 00:06:50.040
Just fucking Zap and the top of your fucking skull for the entire five hours.

114
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.390
I'm calling it right now.

115
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.560
Somebody is going to die as some fucking a Wifi shit in the air.

116
00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.040
I don't know what's going to happen.
Oh No,
no,
no.
Oh good.
Oh,

117
00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:03.540
it's still going.
I saw the screen cut out and I was like,
oh fuck.

118
00:07:03.541 --> 00:07:04.830
Did I have to start it over again?

119
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.480
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

120
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.480
<v 0>What'd you do if there was an ax murder just walked into my room and that was</v>

121
00:07:09.481 --> 00:07:12.720
the level of emotion I had.
Oh,
no,
no,
no.

122
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.520
That was my acting ability.
Um,
AH,
fuck.
I thought at the screen went black.

123
00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:23.100
I was going to shut off again,
like the,
uh,
like I did last time.

124
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.390
Mini heart attack.
They don't,
what the fuck come back on.
Come back on.

125
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.780
Come back on.
Where did you go?
Why does it keep cutting out on me?

126
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.310
I need to see that it's recording or I'm going to be freaking out here.
Um,

127
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.430
and for all you people laugh for me right now.
Fuck you.
I'm an old man.

128
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.830
I don't understand these things.
I don't pretend to understand them.
So anyways,

129
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.230
I um,
so I land Washington,
Dallas,

130
00:07:46.231 --> 00:07:50.580
like a fucking inexperience Douche.
Every time I go to DC I always say,

131
00:07:50.581 --> 00:07:54.630
you know what?
Next time I'm going to land it,
Ronald Reagan,
that's actually,

132
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.290
you know,

133
00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:00.290
fucking in the downtown area rather than 45 fucking miles outside of the city.

134
00:08:02.011 --> 00:08:03.030
But fortunately a,

135
00:08:03.031 --> 00:08:07.290
I landed at seven o'clock and the traffic was headed out rather than him.
But,
uh,

136
00:08:07.291 --> 00:08:09.870
there's a couple helacious fucking airports like that.

137
00:08:09.871 --> 00:08:14.470
Like next time you go to Dallas,
don't,
don't go to their main fucking,
uh,

138
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.210
those airports where they're an airport and they also have their own subway

139
00:08:18.211 --> 00:08:22.620
system.
You really don't want to be,
cause they're usually way the fuck outside.

140
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.230
I mean,
I guess Dallas is
Dallas isn't that bad.

141
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.390
You know what sucks about Dallas is when you go to connect,

142
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:36.330
you know when you go to connect,
um,
you never in the right terminal.

143
00:08:36.331 --> 00:08:41.160
And the way they did it is it goes a,
B,
c,
d like A's on top,

144
00:08:41.161 --> 00:08:44.100
bees on the bottom.
She's on top ds on the bottom.

145
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.920
And I think there's an AA or something like that.

146
00:08:46.921 --> 00:08:50.430
Except the thing goes in a circle.
Is that Mike Vick on the fucking Steelers?

147
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:52.860
Well,
the hell did that happen?

148
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:54.370
<v 2>Okay.</v>

149
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.000
<v 0>Do Ben Roethlisberger I saw</v>

150
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.190
<v 3>him the other day with just like a regular shirt on.</v>

151
00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.100
He looks like some fucking fan and the upper deck.

152
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.950
<v 0>He,
that guy is just,
he's fucking aging.
You got,</v>

153
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:09.140
you know what it hats off to him for age,
allowing himself to age naturally.

154
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.410
You know what I mean?
Like Tom Brady,

155
00:09:11.411 --> 00:09:14.780
he's like the fucking hot chick walking around in fucking uggs and stuff.

156
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:19.370
Getting his hair highlighted,
experimenting with different haircuts.
You know,

157
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.610
Ben Roethlisberger is like,
you know,

158
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.300
a character actor or an out of shape actress.
You know,
like if he was an actress,

159
00:09:26.301 --> 00:09:29.470
they call what he's doing right now.
Brave.
You know what I mean though?

160
00:09:29.471 --> 00:09:32.090
He's big on that.
They're big on that word and the acting community,

161
00:09:32.091 --> 00:09:36.320
everything's fucking brave.
And you did the movie without makeup.

162
00:09:36.321 --> 00:09:38.360
It was such a brave performance.

163
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:39.790
<v 3>Okay.</v>

164
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.160
<v 0>Oh fuck.
Are they wearing pink again?
This God damn.
Yeah.</v>

165
00:09:42.161 --> 00:09:43.180
You know what I like about it though?

166
00:09:43.181 --> 00:09:47.560
There's only a little bit of pink and I called it right now the NFL is gradually

167
00:09:47.561 --> 00:09:52.561
trying to phase out the pink October next year.

168
00:09:52.581 --> 00:09:55.820
They're just going to have a wristband because eventually somebody,

169
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:56.700
<v 3>okay,</v>

170
00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.930
<v 0>look off fat is fucking spaces.
Ben Roethlisberger space,
dude.</v>

171
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:04.830
He goes to buffalo wild wings all week and then he just comes out in the slings

172
00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:05.730
it on Sunday.
Man,

173
00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:08.340
you've got to love that guy unless you're a woman in a bathroom.

174
00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:11.670
But other than that,
this guy is just a fucking old school.

175
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.730
He's an old school football player,
right?
That was a low blow.

176
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.050
You got acquainted twice,
you know,

177
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.450
twice as the keyword in that sentence twice.
Um,

178
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:23.150
I'm calling it right now.

179
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:28.160
They're gradually gonna phase out this pink shit in the NFL because eventually

180
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:32.360
somebody with enough poll is going to do a research cause going to do some

181
00:10:32.361 --> 00:10:36.710
research and realize how little fucking money trickles down to anybody,
right?

182
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.970
I you don't want to put the fuck do I know.

183
00:10:39.971 --> 00:10:42.710
I've just gone on a couple of websites anyways.
Um,

184
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.520
what am I doing here?

185
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.820
I'm watching a football game and doing this isn't fucking add maniac.

186
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.180
Let me turn my back here.
You can't turn your back on football.

187
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.540
It's like turning your back on America.
Hey,
you know what?

188
00:10:55.541 --> 00:10:58.540
Somebody came up with a great retort here for a,

189
00:10:58.541 --> 00:11:00.670
you know how those fucking English constant,

190
00:11:00.671 --> 00:11:03.640
all those fucking douchebags and think they're so fucking smart.
They always go,

191
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.290
why are you cal football?

192
00:11:05.291 --> 00:11:08.600
Football might you know you fucking carry with your hands.

193
00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:12.520
And she called fucking handball.
Somebody tweeted me that.
His friend goes,

194
00:11:12.521 --> 00:11:14.740
well then why the fuck don't you call it feet ball?

195
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.220
You're using you using both feet.
All right there.

196
00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:22.150
There's a little clever one right back at you.
If you guys were so fucking smart,

197
00:11:22.151 --> 00:11:25.990
you would've called it feet ball,
not football.
How about that?
Huh?

198
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:30.040
We'll chip the tat there.
Look at this fucking awful shit they laid out here.

199
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.610
You know what I hate when?
I hate the arena.

200
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:37.650
When somebody has let an appetizer and their consideration of an appetizer is an

201
00:11:37.901 --> 00:11:39.400
array of different pickles.

202
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.810
You know I got to fucking bread sticks here that looked like chopsticks.

203
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.540
Some fucking cheese that look like,
well,
I guess Jesus like rotted milk.
Anyways,

204
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.570
what do we got here?
Got some nuts.
I don't like this hotel.

205
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.160
The hotel I'm staying at is for young people.
It's for people in their twenties,

206
00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.443
right?

207
00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.280
For them to fucking do selfies and flashed a peace sign and then Hashtag Yolo,

208
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:05.460
it's one of those fucking hotels.
I'm an old man.
All right?

209
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.830
I don't like air conditioning.
It gives me a cold and my,
my,

210
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:12.270
it makes my throat raspy.
How the fuck do you shut it off?

211
00:12:12.271 --> 00:12:15.780
Does that option exist or did apple build this fucking thing and it's no longer

212
00:12:15.781 --> 00:12:19.500
an option?
I'm really down on their fucking products.
Everybody.

213
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.190
Did you have,
you noticed that,
that you,

214
00:12:22.191 --> 00:12:24.930
you're only allowed two options now with all of their shit.

215
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.350
It's basically a do it now or maybe later.

216
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:30.180
Remind me later.

217
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:34.650
They've completely gotten rid of the fuck off option.

218
00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:39.110
Fuck off.
I don't want this.
You know,
and I'll tell you right now,

219
00:12:39.111 --> 00:12:43.300
it's a slippery slope.
Um,

220
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.570
I think people are going to graduate.
They get used to not having an option.

221
00:12:46.571 --> 00:12:49.150
Like here,
this is what it is.
This is what it is.

222
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.640
And you can either do it this way or you can do it that way,

223
00:12:51.641 --> 00:12:54.390
but you can not opt out on any fucking level.

224
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.150
And then they're going to gradually microchip us.
Oh,

225
00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:59.850
fucking steal is straight out.
I got to tell you,
Mike Vick is looking,

226
00:12:59.851 --> 00:13:04.740
really sharpen that stealer,
that Steelers jersey.
You know what I mean?

227
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.180
Who was the other guy they had?

228
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.930
They had an African or they've had a couple of African American quarterbacks.

229
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:14.430
The last guy cried.
You know what I mean?
So they're like,
all right.
You know what?

230
00:13:14.431 --> 00:13:19.050
We'll just have a coach.
Coaches don't cry.
Players cry every once in a while.

231
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.750
You know they,
how was that guy's name?

232
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.740
I don't fucking know.
Anyway,

233
00:13:26.741 --> 00:13:30.090
so I actually saw some cool when I was coming into decent time.
You fly into DC,

234
00:13:30.091 --> 00:13:32.790
there's always some sort of presidential contact.
You know what I mean?

235
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.940
You feel like he's right around the corner.
You're going to see him.

236
00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:38.400
All of a sudden they block off the streets.
You could stay here longer.

237
00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:39.870
The motorcade goes by,
right.

238
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:45.140
And all the jaded people who fucking does this thing keep cutting out.

239
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.730
I hope it doesn't cut out.
No,
no.
Cause it's keep going.
It keeps going right.

240
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.050
This just fucking awful.
How do you guys learn about this shit?

241
00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.300
You know what I mean?
They did.

242
00:13:56.301 --> 00:13:59.090
Things just shows up and it doesn't fucking tell you anything.
And then what?

243
00:13:59.091 --> 00:14:00.800
You got to go into those little chat rooms.

244
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:02.883
<v 3>Okay?</v>

245
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:07.200
<v 0>Send a couple of emojis.
The the please help me.
I'm an old man fucking Emoji.</v>

246
00:14:07.201 --> 00:14:11.680
Is that what you're supposed to do?
Well,
that's a fumble,
right?
Nope.
Uh,

247
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.600
he dropped the pink football.
All right.
Anyways,

248
00:14:15.601 --> 00:14:19.810
some I'm driving into DC.
I'm might actually riding in and um,

249
00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.650
I see this fucking helicopter just fucking cruising.

250
00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:24.780
<v 3>Okay.</v>

251
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.340
<v 0>Look like it wasn't any more than 200 feet off the,
uh,</v>

252
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.570
off the surface going right down the fucking Potomac.
You know,

253
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.810
I see how it's got the Alec and sees the Red Lights,

254
00:14:35.811 --> 00:14:39.270
so I know it's going from right to left because the red is always on the left.

255
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.750
The green.
Your position.
Arie likes in aviation,
the green,

256
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.450
the green is always on the right.
And uh,

257
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.970
the other one's a that will whatever the fucking,
the left is always the red.

258
00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.420
I actually took offense to a ground school.
It's like,
why are we read?

259
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.750
Why is this going back to the 18 hundreds when she wrote with the left hand you

260
00:14:57.751 --> 00:15:02.490
with a devil,
you know this fire and health,
the devil's read,

261
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.920
right?
Is that what the fuck it is?
And if you're on the right,

262
00:15:04.921 --> 00:15:06.650
you sat on the right hand of the father and it'll,

263
00:15:06.651 --> 00:15:11.310
all your fucking options are open to you.
Is that,
what,
is it above anyway?

264
00:15:11.311 --> 00:15:14.370
So the thing's fucking cruise around.
The dude driving me and said that they,

265
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.920
whenever they fly the president via helicopter,

266
00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.870
that they always have three helicopters and he's only in one of them.
Right?

267
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.960
So if anybody's going to try to do anything crazy,

268
00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:30.390
they got a one in three chance of fucking,
uh,
I dunno,
making it happen.

269
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.110
I have no fucking idea.
But speaking of that,
you know what,

270
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.930
I actually,
um,

271
00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:42.510
I bought another one of these yachting magazines because I know it's just

272
00:15:42.511 --> 00:15:46.980
fucking hilarious to me that the,
the,
this one's called showboats,

273
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:48.840
right?

274
00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.580
And on the cover it says to boldly go where no man has gone before.

275
00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:58.850
And then talking about the northwest passage from death trap to Trendy fucking

276
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.990
transit.
And the Bermuda Triangle to tales of the unexplained.

277
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.540
So that was actually interesting as as hell.

278
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.390
But then like peppered in between the stories is like,
like this,

279
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.980
like an advertisement full,

280
00:16:12.981 --> 00:16:16.440
like a $250,000 fucking watch,

281
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:19.950
watch,
my voice should have cracked.

282
00:16:19.951 --> 00:16:24.180
And so we just can walk around with the Ferrari and then they got this one page,

283
00:16:24.181 --> 00:16:27.120
it says owner's club where readers of the magazine,

284
00:16:27.121 --> 00:16:30.330
you become part of the owner's club and he sent in a picture of you and you

285
00:16:30.331 --> 00:16:35.190
creepy fucking rich family,
you know,
so they got this old ass fucking guy,

286
00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:40.010
right?
He looks like he's at least 70 his wife's in,
is it an,

287
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:44.100
it looks like to be in her fifties botox down and then they got three fucking

288
00:16:44.101 --> 00:16:49.101
creepy kids that are like only in like their teens and twenties you know?

289
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.570
And they all looked a little fucked up,
you know what I mean?

290
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.290
Because rich people want to hold on to their money.
So they sit there and they,

291
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.500
they kind of fucking the same culdesac out there on the Hamptons.

292
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.740
And after a while they all start looking like each other.
You know what I mean?

293
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.880
Then they got these weird sort of ailments,
like pure bred dogs.

294
00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.580
Like they can't go swimming because there is always fill up with water.

295
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.750
It can't come out and then they get like these fucking infections is something I

296
00:17:12.751 --> 00:17:17.460
have no idea what.
Anyways,
these kinds won.
It starts sailing up the Amazon River.

297
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.400
Do you don't even realize there's no fucking way I'm going to be able to do the

298
00:17:20.401 --> 00:17:23.880
advertising because I'm too afraid to leave.

299
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.230
I'm too afraid to leave this area.
Like it's going to have my phone,

300
00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:31.240
like it's going to shut off so I'm just going to have going to have to go

301
00:17:31.241 --> 00:17:32.110
straight through.

302
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.213
<v 4>Okay.</v>

303
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.160
<v 0>Like I said,
dude,
if you guys are actually hearing this as an absolute miracle,</v>

304
00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:39.320
so anyways,
these kinds want to fucking,
you know,

305
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:44.360
sale their yachts up the Amazon River.
Why would you want to do that?

306
00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:49.070
You know why?
Cause she's sick of going to these fucking eyes wide shut parties.

307
00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.300
And no matter where you took your yacht,
there's some other contact going like,

308
00:17:53.301 --> 00:17:54.134
oh yeah,

309
00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:58.490
I'd taken my boat there and you want to have something new to talk about,
right?

310
00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:03.650
You got a $250,000 watch,
he's got a $260,000 watch.
You feel bored.

311
00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:05.383
You know what I mean?

312
00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.430
How are you going to get some 50 year old botox woman to come over and jump on

313
00:18:10.431 --> 00:18:14.390
your 80 year old Dick,
you know,
and fuck you on your Helo pad on your boat.

314
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.700
How the fuck are you gonna do,
do that?
You know,

315
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.770
you got to take your boat with no other people go.

316
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:22.700
So these costs are going to go up the Amazon River,
right?

317
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.900
And uh,
you know this pristine area,

318
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.300
you got people living up there where a,

319
00:18:29.301 --> 00:18:33.590
you know how people used to live hundreds of thousands of fucking years ago or

320
00:18:33.591 --> 00:18:35.900
whatever the fuck it is.
I don't know.
But you know,

321
00:18:35.901 --> 00:18:38.510
what's cool is this pirates up and down that thing.

322
00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.940
So at some 0.1 of these rich countries is going to get killed.
I guarantee it.

323
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:47.900
I can't,
I even give a fuck if they can't like board the boat.

324
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:49.640
At some point someone's going to be like,
well fuck it.

325
00:18:49.641 --> 00:18:53.210
Then I'll just climb up a tree and I'll shoot one of these fucking darts at them

326
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.730
or whatever they do.
You know,

327
00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:01.010
know after some cannibalistic fucking,
uh,
tribes out there,

328
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.510
how great would that be?

329
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.480
How great would the fucking meet be those rich people,
they must be like veal.

330
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.833
Yup.

331
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:17.540
After all these fucking years of fighting all the tribes,
you know,

332
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.430
these guys are fucking,
you know,

333
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:23.840
climbing trees and running through the forest to fucking athletes did,
did tough.

334
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:28.160
Right.
You know what I'm saying?
Like if take this NFL game here,
man,

335
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.790
if you were going to eat somebody who went to this NFL game,
right?

336
00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.360
You wouldn't want to eat an NFL player.
I'm saying it's a plane crash.

337
00:19:35.361 --> 00:19:37.580
He had a fucking dude,
you're on the team flight,
right?

338
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.730
You don't want to eat it and it fell flat.
I mean,
that guy's fucking shredded.

339
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.490
You know what I mean?
Maybe alignment.
Debbie.

340
00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:48.110
I've eaten like a fucking rib eye,
you know.
Nice and marble.

341
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.160
Find a good cut of meat.

342
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:57.070
Fucking underbelly would be like that fucking the underbelly.

343
00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.830
Like all the Japanese guys like that fucking a,
that Sushi.
Right?

344
00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.610
That's fucking disgusting.
But I'm just saying,
so what is disgusting to us?

345
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.370
Because we have all these options.
You know,

346
00:20:07.371 --> 00:20:10.540
first world problems is people like to say I love when people say,

347
00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.770
oh first world prob,
well I live in a first world,

348
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.020
so everything I have is a first world problem.

349
00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:18.080
I could be completely fucking dead ass bro.

350
00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:22.250
A homeless guy in the United States has first world problems.

351
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.790
Okay.
Shitting on a subway grate,
you know what I mean?

352
00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:29.210
Exposing himself so he can get a night in jail and maybe maybe get some fucking,

353
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.350
some porridge,
whatever the fuck they feed prisoners.
All right.

354
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.290
That's still a first world problem cause he's part of our economy.

355
00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:37.693
You know what I mean?

356
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.113
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

357
00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.630
<v 0>You know it's funny is so many lives in a third world can't get it,</v>

358
00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.840
can't get a girlfriend.
Is that a third world problem?

359
00:20:43.841 --> 00:20:47.640
It's still third real problem.
He's in third world and no one will his dick,

360
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.210
right.
I need some clarification on this.
Anyway,

361
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.850
so what the fuck was I talking about?
Okay,

362
00:20:53.851 --> 00:20:56.460
so he got these fucking tribes or whatever.
These people that,
you know,

363
00:20:56.461 --> 00:20:59.520
they got one pair of shorts that whole life,
you know what I mean?

364
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.770
The environmental footprint,
the carbon footprint is,
is,
is basically nothing,

365
00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.030
you know,
and now here come these rich concept,
the river Ed,

366
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.170
I'm calling it right now.

367
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:13.120
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

368
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.340
<v 0>For the first time in the history of the world,</v>

369
00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:19.480
a billionaire is going to get eaten.
I shrink down his fucking head.

370
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.280
You know,
I don't,

371
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:28.240
what the fuck's going to happen is watchful end up at the bottom of the fucking

372
00:21:28.241 --> 00:21:33.050
Amazon.
Um,
it really is actually know something.
When I was,

373
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.140
there was,
there's a lot about,
um,

374
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:39.880
to be serious here for the first time at 21 fucking minutes.
There's a lot about,

375
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.240
<v 3>okay.</v>

376
00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.090
<v 6>Owning a boat and navigating it.</v>

377
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.740
That overlaps with aviation as far as like campuses and,

378
00:21:48.741 --> 00:21:49.574
uh,

379
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:50.460
<v 3>okay.</v>

380
00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:54.180
<v 6>You don't magnetic deviation and variation and uh,</v>

381
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:56.580
dead reckoning.

382
00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.760
And then also the sinking fucking feeling that you just

383
00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:06.810
<v 0>killed yourself with something out of the ordinary happens when a light comes on</v>

384
00:22:08.491 --> 00:22:12.900
or something like that.
I,
there's no way,
unless you fly or you,

385
00:22:12.901 --> 00:22:16.800
you own a boat and you leave where you can't see land,

386
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:22.100
there's no way to describe that fucking nauseated feeling of,

387
00:22:23.131 --> 00:22:26.250
Oh fuck am I that guy?
Um,

388
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.670
what's your course is totally balanced out by the unbelievable thrill of it.
Um,

389
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.830
I remember I took a long time ago,
well,
not long time ago,

390
00:22:35.831 --> 00:22:38.820
I was like three years ago,
but it seems like a long time ago I was,
um,

391
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.540
I was in Boston,
I was staying in the North End.
It was fucking great.

392
00:22:42.541 --> 00:22:46.020
And when I was doing that movie,
the heat and um,

393
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:51.150
my wife came to town and so I wanted to take her out and they had these,

394
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:55.590
these water taxis.
So I was like,
oh,
I had a little romance to this thing.
Well,

395
00:22:55.591 --> 00:22:58.730
jump on the water taxi and we'll go over to this different part of the city.

396
00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.410
We'll go get something to eat or whatever.
I came up with the fuck are you doing?

397
00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.880
And I got to tell you something,
man.
The second I got out there on that boat,

398
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.820
all right.
And we were going by,

399
00:23:08.821 --> 00:23:11.700
and it was this guy knew all the shit and he goes over that giant boat.

400
00:23:11.701 --> 00:23:16.420
You see a giant bolt right there that bolts on by the,
uh,
the fucking,
uh,

401
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.110
owner of the red sox was this giant fucking yet,
right?

402
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:23.790
And I'm terrified of the ocean and that type of shit.
You know what I mean?
And,

403
00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:26.910
but I got to met the second I got out there on that boat immediately.

404
00:23:26.911 --> 00:23:31.020
The temptation to do something fucking illegal was,

405
00:23:31.021 --> 00:23:34.450
was what was off the charts.
I,
I,

406
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:39.140
there's no way I could own a boat.
Well,
I would do it.

407
00:23:39.141 --> 00:23:43.070
The fear of fucking going to jail and getting fucking butt raped and always

408
00:23:43.071 --> 00:23:47.400
keeps you in line,
doesn't it?
But still,
you know what I mean?

409
00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.370
You just thinking like,
dude,
nobody's gonna stop.
What are the,

410
00:23:50.371 --> 00:23:55.290
what is going to stop me if I took a key low from this city to another city,

411
00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.110
you know,
then you got to interact with them,
right?

412
00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.710
Who the fuck she going to give you a Keela what the flux sec I got to do.

413
00:24:01.711 --> 00:24:02.820
All of a sudden he fucking,

414
00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.610
he comes on the boat with you and next thing you know he'd peek.

415
00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:07.440
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

416
00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.290
<v 0>he does a Kleinfeld right?</v>

417
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.990
One of my favorite fucking characters of all time.

418
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:16.080
They ever tell you guys how much I love that movie that I can't remember the

419
00:24:16.081 --> 00:24:16.950
name of,
but I know,

420
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:21.120
remember Sean Penn's characters name Carlito's way

421
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.490
lawyer.
You ate a lawyer.

422
00:24:26.491 --> 00:24:30.250
Client sells you a gangster.
Um,

423
00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:35.020
Hey,
I'm not getting mad at Ya.
That guy when he's got the fucking the cough.

424
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:39.220
There's a lot of great character actors in that movie.
But anyways,
um,

425
00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:43.640
I ain't with that.
Fuck.
I'm talking about fan duel.
Can I make fun of Fan Duel?

426
00:24:43.641 --> 00:24:47.630
They've never fucking advertise in this podcast.
Do you realize how fucking,

427
00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.310
how fucking reprehensible it is that,
that all of these,

428
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:56.930
these sports leagues are getting in bed with the sports book after all these

429
00:24:56.931 --> 00:25:00.710
years of them fucking sitting there talking about how,
you know,

430
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.520
the gambling ruins their sport and a day,
as long as it doesn't ruin their sport,

431
00:25:04.521 --> 00:25:07.610
they don't give a fuck what happens to your life.
You know what I mean?

432
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.070
And if you've noticed in the,
you know what,

433
00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.600
I don't give a fuck if they never come back.
I can't,
I can't.

434
00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.230
I got to say something here.
I just have to,
it's,
it's just,

435
00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.340
it's low hanging fruit,
dude.

436
00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.750
You notice in those commercials all they show is like three or four fucking

437
00:25:20.751 --> 00:25:24.620
winters.
That's it.
Okay.
The rest of them fucking lose.

438
00:25:24.621 --> 00:25:25.520
I gotta tell you sent demand,

439
00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:30.560
like that fucking gambling thing is a god damn fucking disease that you do not

440
00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:35.360
want to get involved in.
I'm telling you right now.
Okay.
You know,

441
00:25:35.361 --> 00:25:38.640
it's funny as I'm going to shit on it and I also have a great idea for it.

442
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:44.050
All right.
I think it's,
it's,
it's,
it's an,

443
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.350
it's actually not even reprehensible that baseball after what they've done with

444
00:25:47.351 --> 00:25:50.440
Pete rose and that type of stuff has gotten bed with these fucking guys.

445
00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:55.390
I will say this.
Um,
it's just,
it's almost,
it's more,

446
00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.920
it's kind of just honest,
like,
yeah,
all we give a fuck about is making money.

447
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:04.000
Like we don't give a shit.
I mean,
what are they going to do next?

448
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.610
You know what I mean?
What the fuck are they?

449
00:26:06.611 --> 00:26:09.400
Do you know what they're going to do is they're going to legalize weed.

450
00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:13.150
Weed's going to be legal and then they're going to have commercials on TV and

451
00:26:13.151 --> 00:26:15.460
they'll get in bed with those fucking guys and they'll sell it.

452
00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.760
Players that they can't fucking use it as,
he can't,
can't smoke weed.

453
00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.920
You can't gamble,
but our fans can do whatever they want and then you just start,

454
00:26:23.921 --> 00:26:27.940
you know,
just start selling cocaine.
Just have them advertise,
fucking blow,

455
00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.350
you know,
you know,
those,
those movable fucking,
uh,

456
00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.960
billboards behind the home plate or whatever.
Um,

457
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.980
now having said all that fan duel and draft kings,

458
00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:42.750
I have a great idea for you guys if you want to land a well,

459
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:46.630
all right.
Cause probably what you're thinking right now is all right,

460
00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.390
well we're getting all these bottom feeders.
You know,

461
00:26:49.391 --> 00:26:54.391
cause you know like basically you pick your team and then you have a salary cap

462
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.110
and you know that the salary cap basically represents those,
you know,

463
00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:04.210
the green zero in the green double zero on a,
in the roulette wheel,

464
00:27:04.211 --> 00:27:06.820
which I'm,
you know,
I'm certainly not a mathematician,

465
00:27:06.821 --> 00:27:11.821
but from what I've overheard in conversations in bars is that unbelievably tips

466
00:27:12.611 --> 00:27:16.990
it in the casinos favor to the point they can't fucking lose.
Right.

467
00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.140
Which is the whole point of open and a fucking casino.

468
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:23.110
I mean you don't want to fucking lose.
So you know,

469
00:27:23.111 --> 00:27:27.190
the salary cap represents the green zero in the green,

470
00:27:27.191 --> 00:27:31.360
double zero on the fucking a roulette wheel.
So I have an eye itself,
maybe,

471
00:27:31.361 --> 00:27:36.361
I don't know if you want to attract a bigger spending clientele is you let you

472
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:42.280
let the,
the,
the super rich.
All right.

473
00:27:42.281 --> 00:27:47.170
What they have to do is they have,
you have a luxury tax you,
you,

474
00:27:47.171 --> 00:27:51.580
so you basically make it like a soft cap like they do in baseball,
right?

475
00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:55.210
Where basically everybody has to adhere to this salary cap unless she got money

476
00:27:55.211 --> 00:27:58.540
like the red sox and the Yankees,
at which point you can go beyond it,

477
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:03.010
but then you have a luxury tax except the luxury tax doesn't go to the poor

478
00:28:03.011 --> 00:28:05.020
bastards who fucking lost their shirt.

479
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:09.160
Like basically the bottom feeder gamblers who are like the Kansas cities and

480
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:10.960
those teams who Kansas City's back now,

481
00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.300
no disrespect them in San Diego or whatever.

482
00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:16.360
These teams that can't afford to spend money like the Yankees and red sox

483
00:28:16.361 --> 00:28:19.180
basically.
Right.
Instead of the money going to them,

484
00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.180
it goes to you guys at Fan Duel and draft kings,
right?

485
00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:26.470
And then all you do is have your nerdy mathematician.
Some comes from MIT.

486
00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.520
Figure out a way that with the luxury tax it looks like,

487
00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.133
you know,

488
00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.430
they can feel the better team and it looks like the odds are increasingly in

489
00:28:36.431 --> 00:28:39.970
their favor,
but they have to gamble a certain amount of money.

490
00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:43.660
You got to put a certain amount of money down and then you do a little fuck you

491
00:28:43.661 --> 00:28:46.930
fuck with the numbers with the nerdy little MIT mathematician.

492
00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:51.040
And next thing you know you've got some way along the hook and now he's chasing

493
00:28:51.041 --> 00:28:53.410
it,
right?
He's still in the luxury tax thing,

494
00:28:53.411 --> 00:28:57.640
one of those fucking Wall Street cons,
you know,
so they go,

495
00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:02.170
so I Shit on you and also give you a decent idea to just have one of your nerds

496
00:29:02.171 --> 00:29:04.270
work it out.
All right,
there you go.

497
00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.243
<v 5>MMM.</v>

498
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.270
<v 0>I'm walking around for some dumb reason.</v>

499
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:11.960
<v 5>Uh Huh.</v>

500
00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.020
<v 0>We're at 29 minutes.</v>

501
00:29:13.021 --> 00:29:15.850
I got another 50 seconds to eat up here and then I'm going to watch this fucking

502
00:29:15.851 --> 00:29:19.750
game and I'm going to order room service and I'm not going to drink and I'm not

503
00:29:19.751 --> 00:29:20.680
going to smoke a cigar.

504
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:24.460
Even though last night I smoked two cigars back to back and I had a couple of

505
00:29:24.461 --> 00:29:28.330
drinks.
I'm trying to everybody,
you know what I mean?
I got my fucking vices.

506
00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.740
Um,
I had a good idea for cigars too.

507
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:37.240
I can't remember what the fuck that is.
I literally feel a cold coming on.

508
00:29:37.241 --> 00:29:38.080
This is how old I am.

509
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:41.840
I fucking stayed in a hotel for fucking 30 minutes doing this God damn shit with

510
00:29:41.841 --> 00:29:45.230
the air conditioner on and I feel like I'm having a cold,
having a cold,

511
00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:47.570
catching a cold.
All right.
Anyways,

512
00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.260
the reason why I'm all over the place as I'm so fucking anxious that I'm not

513
00:29:51.261 --> 00:29:55.130
going to be able to figure out how to fucking upload this thing onto Dropbox.

514
00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:59.840
Why do you keep fucking closing on me?
I got to put the password in.
Um,

515
00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.180
all right,
whatever.
That's 30 minutes now.
You know what?
Now I got to fucking,
uh,

516
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:09.230
well let's see if I can do this.
Let's see if I can close this.
Oh,

517
00:30:09.231 --> 00:30:12.920
it is still recording.
It's still recording.
Would you look at that?

518
00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:15.860
All right,
so I can do my advertising.

519
00:30:15.861 --> 00:30:18.440
I'm looking at this and I don't have to fucking copy and paste some shit

520
00:30:18.441 --> 00:30:22.640
together.
All right,
here we go.
Oh my God.
There's a ton of them.
All right.

521
00:30:22.641 --> 00:30:27.390
Dollar Shave Club.
Everybody stopped shaving with an a you fucking motherfucker.

522
00:30:27.391 --> 00:30:31.850
You stop.
Stuff keeps popping up on the screen.
Okay,

523
00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.190
let's try this again.
Dollar Shave club,
everybody.

524
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:37.970
I'm on my best behavior this week.
Stopped shaving with an old razor.

525
00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:39.830
It's gross.

526
00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.250
Why are you torturing yourself with the gross old blade week after week?

527
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:46.280
Probably because you don't want to shell out 20 bucks for a pack of new ones.

528
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:50.720
Dollar Shave Club has revolutionized the way men shape.
With Dollar Shave Club,

529
00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:55.100
you could shave with a fresh blade as often as you want because they deliver a

530
00:30:55.101 --> 00:30:58.310
whole sleeve of amazing raises for just a few bucks a month.

531
00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:01.580
The razors are so good.
Millions of guys have joined.

532
00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.940
Even the billion dollar razor corporations are freaking out.
I love this,

533
00:31:04.941 --> 00:31:05.774
this paragraph,

534
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:09.650
but instead of lowering their bloated prices that trying to fool you into

535
00:31:09.651 --> 00:31:12.950
milking the same blade for an entire month and that's gross.
Uh,

536
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.040
they've price gouged for low us for long enough through,

537
00:31:16.041 --> 00:31:20.850
this is like the Napster of a a blade.
This is totally going to bring down those,

538
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:24.460
the blade industry.
I'm calling it right now.
Would you pay more?

539
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.840
I'm never go back to squeezing weeks and weeks and shaves out of the disgusting

540
00:31:28.841 --> 00:31:32.050
Rusty Blade.
Joined Dollar Shave club and use a fresh blade whenever you want.

541
00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:35.140
It feels amazing and it's just a third of the price.
It's a no brainer.

542
00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.500
Join the millions of others who figured,
figured out the smart way to shave.

543
00:31:38.501 --> 00:31:42.270
Joined Dollar Shave club now by going to dollar shave club.com/burr.

544
00:31:42.271 --> 00:31:47.271
That's dollar shave club.com/bar hey dollar shave club.com/barb.

545
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:53.020
All right,
club Dubby Club Derby,
uh,
9,000 years.

546
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.750
That's how long humans had been making wine.

547
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:59.950
That's also how long they'd been confused about which wine to drink.

548
00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:04.870
Some people get a headache after they drink wine.
I do.
Red Wine crushes me,

549
00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.070
but for many of us it's the shopping part that causes the real headaches.

550
00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.860
So I thought you had to come up with a wine that doesn't give me a headache.

551
00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:15.910
It's actually the next day.
Anyway,
so many choices,
so many choices,

552
00:32:15.911 --> 00:32:18.400
so much to learn and so expensive with no guarantee.

553
00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:22.330
You'll leave in like what you by picking out a good wine can be difficult.

554
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.050
Beer nerds go on and on about hops,
it micro brews,

555
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.860
but at the same time it's frowned upon to care about good wine.

556
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.730
Research has shown most people buy based on the label.

557
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:38.380
Those are terrible odds to play your own personal experience learning about wine

558
00:32:38.381 --> 00:32:42.300
or why you haven't to learn about wine if you haven't bothered to learn about

559
00:32:42.301 --> 00:32:47.240
wine.
Oh,
was I supposed to do some,
you know,
I should really read.

560
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:51.290
Oh,
I should put my own personal experience yet.
The way I read out loud,

561
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:55.460
people know I don't know shit about wine,
although I do love a Barolo.
All right,

562
00:32:55.461 --> 00:33:00.010
and I don't let the acidity one.
I like the fruity or one.
Was that nice?

563
00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:03.620
Did that work?
I just signed up for club w no,
I didn't.

564
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.830
<v 2>Okay.</v>

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:09.230
<v 0>Yeah.
My wines are on the way.
No,
I didn't.
I know I have some wine on the way.</v>

566
00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:12.890
I'm going to try it first and then I'll do it.
All right.
Look if you rent a wine,

567
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:13.720

Um,</v>

570
00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.810

it's a great idea because there are,

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.870
Can I digress for half a second?

667
00:39:02.871 --> 00:39:07.790
Do you know it's the 20th anniversary far Nirvana's nevermind.

668
00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.910
<v 6>And I bought spin magazine.</v>

669
00:39:09.911 --> 00:39:14.880
They had this giant article and everybody was talking about it and uh,

670
00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.970
and for the majority of people were just like,
dude,

671
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:23.950
when that album came out,
man,
I was just like,

672
00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.750
fuck hair metal.

673
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.440
This is something different and it's fucking over.

674
00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:33.720
Was I the only guy who heard that Alma was just kind of like,
hey,

675
00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:38.020
you know,
I kinda still like Whitesnake.

676
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:45.250
I did.
I was too far down the hair metal trail.

677
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:50.370
I didn't realize how good nirvana was and I hated Pearl Jam.

678
00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:55.510
Fucking hated them.
I hated Eddie Vedder's stupid.

679
00:39:55.511 --> 00:40:00.511
I'm in a trance on purpose face who he ran hello when he sit there and he'd be

680
00:40:01.751 --> 00:40:06.400
fucking have his arms up and his wrists were all fucking limp and he was making

681
00:40:06.401 --> 00:40:08.710
those faces on fucking purpose.

682
00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:15.070
He looked like he should have been a wrestling or something.
He's crazy.

683
00:40:15.071 --> 00:40:18.820
Eddie Vedder.
Um,
I hated that fucking,

684
00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:20.920
I still hate that fucking album.

685
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.780
<v 3>Okay.</v>

686
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.940
<v 6>We even flow.
Hate it.</v>

687
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:31.580
I liked their other stuff.
Vitality.
I like what he stopped making the faces.

688
00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:33.380
You know what he was like,

689
00:40:33.381 --> 00:40:37.580
he was like Mel Gibson in the first lethal weapon when he was fucking acting

690
00:40:37.581 --> 00:40:40.940
like he was suicidal and it was so awful.
They had to make him stop.

691
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:45.380
That's what Eddie Vedder was like,
d in the first Pearl Jam.
And then,

692
00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:48.170
and then they'd go to fucking interview.
Do you ever see that interview?

693
00:40:48.171 --> 00:40:50.960
Kurt Loder did.
If somebody can find this fucking video,

694
00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:56.260
they interview Eddie vetter and he's like literally in like the fetal position

695
00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:01.640
making this face.
Like he doesn't want to be interviewed.
It's like Eddie,

696
00:41:01.641 --> 00:41:04.300
you don't have to do the interview.
You could just say,

697
00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:07.640
I'm suffering from exhaustion and everyone will think you have a coke problem,

698
00:41:07.641 --> 00:41:11.690
but who gives a fuck?
Right.
So I wasn't in any of that shit.

699
00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.580
I didn't get into,
uh,

700
00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:16.790
Nirvana until probably 1993.

701
00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:19.240
<v 3>Okay.</v>

702
00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:24.240
<v 6>And by then I noticed everybody was wearing flannel shirts and a smashing</v>

703
00:41:26.051 --> 00:41:30.730
pumpkins and all my bands were gone.
Banished,
never to be returned until that,

704
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:35.520
that metal show came back triumphantly to bring back my music.

705
00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:40.560
But uh,
yeah,
I was late.
I was definitely late,
so I was,
I guess,
I mean,

706
00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:43.380
I guess the article would suck.
I'm such a moron.

707
00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:47.700
I was upset that no one said that.
Basically in the article,

708
00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:50.730
like why would they say that bill?

709
00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:54.330
They're trying to commemorate a fucking masterpiece of an album.

710
00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.090
Why would they have a bunch of people going?
You know,

711
00:41:57.091 --> 00:42:01.860
I thought I didn't think anything about it at that Pearl jam sucked,

712
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.620
but I really,
I was still listened to
no,

713
00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:08.940
the fuck I was listening to

714
00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:13.680
the fuck was I listening to when the early nineties I actually tried to get into

715
00:42:13.681 --> 00:42:14.514
jazz.

716
00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:20.060
I was flailing and just completely not progressing in my drumming at all.

717
00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.670
So I thought,
have I listened to jazz?
I would get better.

718
00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.630
And I liked big band swing and then,
you know,
I,
I,

719
00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.700
I saw all the great drummers.

720
00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:33.930
They used to go to the regatta Blah in Boston.

721
00:42:33.931 --> 00:42:35.490
I saw Tony Williams,

722
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:40.020
I saw Tony Williams in a fucking bar that held like a hundred people.

723
00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:44.520
Louie Bellson.
I went up and shook his hand.
I'm standing behind his drum kit.

724
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.330
It was fucking ridiculous.
Roy Haynes,
I saw Max Roach,

725
00:42:48.331 --> 00:42:51.930
I saw all these guys didn't improve my drumming at all.

726
00:42:51.931 --> 00:42:53.310
That's what the fuck I was doing.

727
00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:58.700
And I was hanging out with my drum teacher who is like 70 years old.

728
00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.460
Uh,
I dunno if I need to add this at this point,
but yes,

729
00:43:02.461 --> 00:43:04.590
there was no pussy in my life at that point.

730
00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:14.610
So anyways,
yeah,
I kind of missed the beginning of the grunge thing.

731
00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:18.450
I'm not a Gen X.
I think I'm old enough to be gen x,
but I'm not.

732
00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:22.620
I am a hair metal fucking eighties kid.

733
00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:25.680
That's who I am.
I watched family ties,

734
00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:31.740
a full metal jacket,
the lost boys.

735
00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:35.670
That was my shit.
That was when I came up.
I can't help it.
That,

736
00:43:35.671 --> 00:43:38.700
that's what the Muse,
I thought Cinderella was a good band.

737
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:40.400
<v 5>Okay.</v>

738
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:45.350
<v 6>What did I know?
Just a fucking redhead kid in the middle of nowhere.</v>

739
00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:49.850
Um,
yeah,
so they would just,
everybody was just going,

740
00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:54.710
I just heard it and I stopped in my tracks and I was like,

741
00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:59.900
what the fuck is this?
It's like,
how did,
how did everybody know that?

742
00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:02.290
<v 5>Okay.</v>

743
00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:06.430
<v 6>You know,
I've ever being annoyed by the,
uh,</v>

744
00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:11.460
that their first video when Kirk goes to take the fucking solo and he pretends

745
00:44:12.821 --> 00:44:15.070
like he's tapped like doing the tap on Solo,

746
00:44:15.071 --> 00:44:18.790
like basically making fun of all the bands that I was listening to and I was

747
00:44:18.791 --> 00:44:23.770
kind of like,
who is this Douche?
You know,
you call that a fucking Solo,

748
00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:28.180
just basically playing the goddamn melody of the song through a fucking

749
00:44:28.181 --> 00:44:29.290
distortion pedal.

750
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:33.480
I'm not saying any of these thoughts were right.

751
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:36.510
I think the guy's a fucking genius and the album's fucking unbelievable,

752
00:44:36.511 --> 00:44:40.860
but that's where my head was at.
That is honestly where my head was at.

753
00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:42.920
Like I went,

754
00:44:42.921 --> 00:44:47.921
got when Axel rose had his running backstage with them at whatever award show

755
00:44:48.961 --> 00:44:50.400
that was when the,
uh,

756
00:44:50.401 --> 00:44:54.060
the bass player and now senator threw it up in the air and it fucking crashed

757
00:44:54.061 --> 00:44:57.900
out on his forehead.
And I believe Dana Carvey was hosting going.

758
00:44:57.901 --> 00:44:59.820
Did you see what that fucking guy just did?

759
00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.020
I was rooting for axl rose.

760
00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.153
<v 5>Okay.</v>

761
00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:11.840
<v 6>I think the only thing that I did respectively respectively as far as my music</v>

762
00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:17.811
listening between 1988 in 1992 was I never bought guns and roses.

763
00:45:20.701 --> 00:45:22.530
Use your illusion.
One or two.

764
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:28.520
I hated the fucking band by that point when they had dizzy and Lizzie and all

765
00:45:28.951 --> 00:45:30.510
these other fucking guys,

766
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:35.730
and they had Matt Sorum and the whole fucking band was gone and then he was

767
00:45:35.731 --> 00:45:40.731
running around and God damn biker shorts and he had that stupid white fucking

768
00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:46.380
wind screen.
Then I'll hold it just,
yeah,

769
00:45:46.381 --> 00:45:50.340
I was unfucking believable.
It just went right down the shitter.

770
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:52.550
<v 5>Okay,</v>

771
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:54.050
<v 6>so that's where I was at.
I was sitting there going,</v>

772
00:45:54.051 --> 00:45:55.850
I can't believe they kicked Steven Adler route,

773
00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:59.660
but guys are phenomenal fucking drummer.

774
00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:01.290
<v 5>Okay.</v>

775
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:04.260
<v 6>Change the whole sound of the Goddamn band.
Now as he left,</v>

776
00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:05.970
that's what I was thinking of.
I wasn't

777
00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:07.550
<v 5>okay.</v>

778
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:12.260
<v 8>My Libido love us Keto.
Look in the windshield.</v>

779
00:46:12.261 --> 00:46:16.490
Is that a mosquito?
I wasn't listening to any of that.
Yay.

780
00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:20.510
<v 6>No,
I didn't listen to any of it and then that fucking dude came on.</v>

781
00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:23.410
That's when I started feeling old.
I think when that,

782
00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:27.610
when that album came out and then smashing pumpkins came out

783
00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:33.580
and whatever the fuck he was singing about cats,
Siamese twins,
that,

784
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.140
how was that song?
I don't know.

785
00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.930
This pat all my wage,
all that shit.
I was trying,

786
00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:45.040
I was trying so hard,
but by then I was like 25 years old and I got to tell you,

787
00:46:45.041 --> 00:46:49.870
it's fucking over.
Silver music is for young people.
Um,

788
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.160
all right.
There you go.

789
00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:54.610
If you wanted to relive the early nineties through my fucking eyeballs there it

790
00:46:54.611 --> 00:46:56.790
was Jesus Christ.
Was that long enough for you

791
00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:57.930
<v 7>gum,</v>

792
00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:02.930
the negative one.

793
00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.130
<v 6>All right,
question a question number two.
Hey Bill,</v>

794
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:33.280
a regular listener and first time writer,
I need your advice on something.

795
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:38.340
26 years old and I was together with a lady for close to a year and a half bef

796
00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:42.450
for dating her.
I was pretty much a dog.
Uh,

797
00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:47.370
you know your typical man whore type.
No,
I know nothing about that.
Um,

798
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:52.390
I basically bang anything with a skirt on it.
Well,
don't ever go to Scotland.

799
00:47:52.391 --> 00:47:57.340
Thank you.
Oh,
be heroes.
Uh,
but this thing,
but this girl was different.

800
00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:58.530
I knew,

801
00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:01.960
I knew her for a while before we started dating and we were amazing friends

802
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:04.960
anyways.
I won't Blab on too much.
Uh,

803
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:08.740
but dating her was great relationship with their dad was good.
So,
you know,

804
00:48:08.741 --> 00:48:12.250
she didn't have any issues and shit,
but like in the middle of the relationship,

805
00:48:12.251 --> 00:48:16.390
I noticed her coworker would be extra flirty with her and stuff.

806
00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:21.280
Oh,
Gj age.
Ugh.

807
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:23.680
If this was a TV show,

808
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:27.040
they would introduce that and then they would go to commercial and you'd be like

809
00:48:27.041 --> 00:48:31.510
up a die.
But I want to see what's going to happen.
Well,
here we go.

810
00:48:31.511 --> 00:48:32.650
We're back from commercial.

811
00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:38.400
I always told her how it made me uncomfortable and that and shit that the dude

812
00:48:40.331 --> 00:48:43.630
always tried to get with her and stuff.
Wait,
I thought this was a woman.

813
00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:50.020
Oh,
I immediately assumed it was a woman.
I wanted this to be,
uh,
oh,

814
00:48:50.021 --> 00:48:53.710
this is a guy.
Oh,
that's extra.
Oh,
Jesus.

815
00:48:55.650 --> 00:49:00.480
Ah,
Jesus Christ.
These God damn fucking women.
What did she do to you?
Serve.

816
00:49:00.481 --> 00:49:03.240
Do I really got to read this?
Do I,
do I even need to read this?

817
00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:05.220
<v 5>Okay.</v>

818
00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.890
<v 6>You totally loving her,
your complete fucking friends with there.</v>

819
00:49:07.891 --> 00:49:10.380
And then she's flirting with disguise,
flirting with the too much,

820
00:49:10.381 --> 00:49:14.650
and all of a sudden now you're not going out with her.
Ah,
God,

821
00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:17.880
this God Damn God damn motherfuckers.
All right,
let's,
let's plow ahead.

822
00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:22.560
I just needed to regroup.
Um,
so anyways,

823
00:49:22.561 --> 00:49:25.860
I told her how it made me uncomfortable and shit,

824
00:49:25.861 --> 00:49:28.050
that the dude was always trying to get with her and stuff,

825
00:49:28.051 --> 00:49:31.590
but she always assured me that she didn't like the dude and she doesn't respect

826
00:49:31.591 --> 00:49:34.560
guys like that who hit on girls even though they are taken.

827
00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:36.950
<v 5>Okay.</v>

828
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:39.680
<v 6>Bull is she,
is she telling the guy to leave her alone?</v>

829
00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:41.770
<v 5>Okay.</v>

830
00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:45.940
<v 6>Jesus Christ,
a couple of months passed and then an incident happened.</v>

831
00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:49.060
She was at an office party and according to her,

832
00:49:49.061 --> 00:49:53.330
the dude got super drunk and kissed her.
Anyways,

833
00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:56.740
this happened on a weekend and came clean about it the next day.

834
00:49:56.950 --> 00:50:01.480
Her excuse was that he got drunk and kissed her so it wasn't her fault and that

835
00:50:01.481 --> 00:50:05.680
she didn't kiss him back.
So it,
nene means there's nothing there.

836
00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.121
Of course,

837
00:50:07.121 --> 00:50:10.870
I didn't listen to that bullshit and I dumped it within 10 minutes to be told at

838
00:50:10.871 --> 00:50:14.200
that time out a second.
I'm going to give you some applause.

839
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.330
There you go.
Exactly.
Exactly.

840
00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:24.160
I don't bind to that crap that she didn't kiss him back cause in my head it's

841
00:50:24.161 --> 00:50:28.340
like she's saying,
oh,
he had his dick in me,
but I didn't fuck them back.

842
00:50:28.341 --> 00:50:31.160
So it's okay.
Thank you sir.
I don't even need to answer this.

843
00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:35.600
You got your heads right where you need to be.
What does a guy ever said?

844
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:40.100
Oh honey,
don't worry.
I didn't kiss her back and gotten away.
Scott free.

845
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:43.460
If a guy said that he would have got the shit kicked out of,
uh,

846
00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:44.870
out of him by his girl.

847
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:48.890
I remember the old uninformed episode where you and Joe were talking about

848
00:50:48.891 --> 00:50:50.780
Michael Richard to some PR guy.

849
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:54.320
And Joe said the problem with the whole situations that Michael Richards

850
00:50:54.321 --> 00:50:58.790
squirmed when he was apologizing and didn't just own up to,

851
00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:01.610
to his fault,
that's why he wasn't forgiven.

852
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:06.200
And that's the logic I use here,
that if she just owned up to it,

853
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.080
that the dude kissed her.
Um,

854
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:13.040
I could deal with it better than her saying she didn't kiss him back because

855
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:18.570
back.
So I should be okay with it.
Okay.
And he goes,

856
00:51:18.571 --> 00:51:21.960
Oh my God,
I'm basing my relationship decision on what Joe de Rosa says.

857
00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:26.400
I think I've hit a new low anyway,
not to make these email too long,

858
00:51:26.401 --> 00:51:30.090
but three months since we broke up and I'm not really sure if it was the right

859
00:51:30.091 --> 00:51:33.780
decision.
My Gut said I did the right thing,
but I'm questioning it dude.

860
00:51:33.781 --> 00:51:34.950
You're questioning it cause you,

861
00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:39.240
cause you love this girl on some level and because you're lonely and you're

862
00:51:39.241 --> 00:51:44.190
going through this shit.
But Dude,
fuck that.
All right.

863
00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:45.091
No offense.

864
00:51:45.091 --> 00:51:49.140
But that Bitch was disrespecting you from day one when that bull shit was

865
00:51:49.141 --> 00:51:52.620
happening,
this guy's drunk.
How did your lips do?
What he's,

866
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:56.250
what did he fucking run across the room?
Like a superman punch,

867
00:51:56.251 --> 00:52:00.090
but with his lips sticking out and she was talking to somebody else and came

868
00:52:00.091 --> 00:52:03.750
over and he was drunk.
What do what?

869
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:07.710
What led up to the kiss?
What the fuck were they talking about?

870
00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:13.820
They were talking about shit that leads up to a kiss and you're fucking goddamn

871
00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:18.300
whore of an ex girlfriend sat there in that fucking moment,

872
00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:21.810
letting your pussy get a little bit wet but not really fucking doing it.

873
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:25.800
Fuck her,
Dude.
I'm telling you right now.
That was the tip of the goddamn iceberg.

874
00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:28.800
That's the lock the door test to the 10th fucking power.

875
00:52:28.801 --> 00:52:31.260
If you ever saw a Bronx tale,
that's it right there.

876
00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:35.400
You 100% made the right fucking decision.
You're still a young guy.

877
00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.170
There's a better one coming your way.

878
00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:41.010
Who won't be fucking flirting with some Dick at work and accidentally getting

879
00:52:41.011 --> 00:52:43.170
kissed and you think that that's the only thing that happened,

880
00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:46.920
that he accidentally just kissed her and that's where the fuck it's stopped.

881
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:51.510
He didn't accidentally brush against one of her titties.
Fuck that dude.

882
00:52:51.511 --> 00:52:53.970
You did the right thing.
Football season's coming.

883
00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:55.950
All that money you would've spent on her.

884
00:52:55.951 --> 00:52:59.460
Go get yourself a dish and get the fucking NFL package.
You deserve it.

885
00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.250
All right,
go on youtube.

886
00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:06.120
Learn how to cook a perfect steak on a Hibachi and enjoy your fucking team for

887
00:53:06.121 --> 00:53:07.350
16 games.
I'm telling you,

888
00:53:07.351 --> 00:53:11.280
let her fade the fuck away and get yourself a decent woman.
Good for you,
sir.

889
00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:15.930
I applaud you.
I applaud you for the fucking decision you just made there.

890
00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:21.750
That did.
That was like,
it was like an in gymnastics.

891
00:53:21.751 --> 00:53:26.310
When you just stick the fucking landing 10.0 it's over.
Give them the gold medal.

892
00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:31.040
You did the right thing.
Fuck her.
All right.
That's just the loneliness.

893
00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:32.560
<v 3>Okay?</v>

894
00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.570
<v 6>You'll find another gore.
Good ones are hard to find.</v>

895
00:53:34.571 --> 00:53:36.780
So it's gonna take longer than three months,
but okay.

896
00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:40.960
But the last thing you want to do,
it's over.
The trust is gone.

897
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:43.690
It's fucking over.
All right?

898
00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:46.600
If you ever think of going back to our relisten to this part of the fucking

899
00:53:46.601 --> 00:53:50.830
podcast,
it ends at four 49 minutes.
53 seconds.

900
00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:54.340
So fast forward to that.
Rewind to whatever fucking two minutes.

901
00:53:55.810 --> 00:54:00.670
Ah,
Jesus Christ didn't kiss him peck.
Yeah,

902
00:54:00.671 --> 00:54:04.240
he didn't kick him in the balls either.
A yell rape.
How the fuck did he kiss you?

903
00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:10.690
<v 7>That's fucking great.
You've done good.
I hope she learns a lesson.</v>

904
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:19.200
I got
good at a moon moon.

905
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:23.200
You stuck,
crafted and the number comes we've smoothed out already.

906
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.340
Like just

907
00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:37.880
<v 6>sake of the women who have influenced female style and the last fucking 25</v>

908
00:54:38.151 --> 00:54:40.250
years.
I'm really going to sound like an old guy,

909
00:54:40.251 --> 00:54:45.251
but I just think that they dress like absolute trash it fucking trash the car

910
00:54:45.431 --> 00:54:49.070
dash Egan's that's your pinnacle of fashion sense.

911
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:53.900
Huh?
Those squirrel died horse.
Huh?

912
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:57.770
Stay looked like to me like if I ever wanted to fuck a Gofer,

913
00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:03.260
if I was ever turned on by a,
uh,
by a rodent

914
00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:12.080
and who came before them?
Who was before them?
Paris Hilton,

915
00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:17.630
Paris.
Fucking Hilton.
Just,

916
00:55:17.631 --> 00:55:20.480
just fucking head to toe.
Just dot.

917
00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:24.770
By the time she was fucking 19,
she was just used up.

918
00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:29.000
Now how do you think she got that way?
Everybody thinks because of what?

919
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:33.140
Because what?
She was some uh,
some rich guys.
Fucking kid.

920
00:55:33.141 --> 00:55:36.680
That's how she ended up that way.
No.
Who was before her?

921
00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:40.160
Madonna lay it on this stage.

922
00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:42.410
Fucking spreading a God damn legs.

923
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:48.470
Just trash.
She's trash.
It's all,

924
00:55:48.471 --> 00:55:52.040
it's bread spent fucking trash for 30 fucking years

925
00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:56.040
and you go back,
you watch,
you watch all those old movies,

926
00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:00.240
this fucking women that beautiful,
but they got,
they got class and you know what?

927
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:03.780
They would probably suck in as much dick is the girls do today,

928
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:05.850
but they didn't wear it on this sleeve.

929
00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:09.460
<v 3>Okay?</v>

930
00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:11.740
<v 6>Fucking tattooed God damn horse.</v>

931
00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:14.183
<v 3>Okay?</v>

932
00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:18.840
<v 6>They would just fucking bring their asses down just a little bit more.
You know,</v>

933
00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:24.090
Scott's a little bit longer.
Leave something.
The imagination.

934
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:29.430
You don't think so.
All you guys are,
I wish Jay walked around naked.

935
00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:34.050
You never had that moment in a titty bar when you walk in,

936
00:56:34.051 --> 00:56:36.750
you just said at some point it's just not even exciting anymore.

937
00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:40.500
You're actually talking to a completely naked woman asking her where the

938
00:56:40.501 --> 00:56:42.300
bathroom is.
You know?

939
00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:48.120
There's no excitement anymore.
You're talking,
you're used to it.

940
00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:52.770
You fucking used to it.
Speaking of which,
speaking of which,

941
00:56:52.771 --> 00:56:56.430
what's the deal?
They had a protest here in New York City.

942
00:56:57.750 --> 00:57:01.860
It was evidently a,
yesterday was go topless day.

943
00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:07.110
It said protesters went over the top for the right to bare breasts.

944
00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:11.910
Almost three dozen activists strutted through Columbus Circle Circle yesterday

945
00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:14.190
on national go topless day.

946
00:57:14.550 --> 00:57:18.770
Similar demonstrations were held across the country demanding that lawmakers

947
00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:22.440
trash codes against female toplessness.

948
00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:27.870
Um,
I don't know why they want to fucking do that,
but you know,

949
00:57:27.871 --> 00:57:30.450
more power to them.
I guess the good looking ones.
That's how I was,

950
00:57:30.451 --> 00:57:31.530
I would ease into that law.

951
00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:35.970
You got to demonstrate that your titties should be shown the same way when you

952
00:57:35.971 --> 00:57:40.020
see a guy walking around with man tits and you like put a shirt on.
Right?

953
00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:42.000
<v 5>Okay.</v>

954
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.770
<v 6>I think that,
I think you should earn being topless.
How about that?</v>

955
00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:48.800
<v 5>Okay.</v>

956
00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:50.990
<v 6>You know,
I sound like a dictator,
but if I was one,</v>

957
00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:55.610
that's how I would run my country.
You got to earn it all right?
If you're a guy,

958
00:57:55.611 --> 00:57:57.950
you gotta be jacked.
And if you're a woman,

959
00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:01.340
you're your tits have to still be excited about life.

960
00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:06.200
They can't be those beaten down tip staring at your toes.
You know?

961
00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:11.480
You know what's interesting is in a lot of third world countries,

962
00:58:11.481 --> 00:58:16.370
women walking around with their titties,
hanging out is a,
is,
is,
is no big deal.

963
00:58:17.570 --> 00:58:21.710
It's not a a,
they don't give a shit.
So I was just wondering,

964
00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:26.070
are as men here in the states and uh,

965
00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:30.500
are we turned on by titties?
Just because we've,
um,
I think that's what it is.

966
00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:33.350
You know what?
That's exactly what the fuck it is.

967
00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:36.410
Because those old school chicks,

968
00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:40.130
the Mary Tyler Moore's with that goddamn skirts below the knee,

969
00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:44.120
do you know if every girl was walking around with skirts below their knee,

970
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:45.290
your whole fucking life?

971
00:58:45.291 --> 00:58:49.700
And then one day some girl comes walking by energy your in are just,

972
00:58:49.701 --> 00:58:52.730
her skirt is above her knee.
I swear to God,
you're going to get a semi.

973
00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:57.530
You're like,
Holy Shit,
I can see your knees.

974
00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:06.140
You know,
women don't,
don't do that with Teddy's,
you know,

975
00:59:06.141 --> 00:59:09.230
can we still be excited to see a fucking titties?
Isn't it enough?

976
00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:12.200
Don't you get enough in this country?
You know,

977
00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:17.260
you get to run your fucking yaps all God damn day long be as rude and

978
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:22.270
inconsiderate as humanly fucking possible and it and no one slap you in the
face.

979
00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:27.680
We can't do it anymore.
You know say Ya Yap,
Yap,
Yap,

980
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:32.200
Yap,
Yap.
Right?
You get divorced,

981
00:59:32.201 --> 00:59:35.920
you get to take a guy for all these fucking worth and they'd be out just to
girl,

982
00:59:35.921 --> 00:59:38.980
I can't work work for me.

983
00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:44.760
I'm used to a certain lifestyle.
Isn't that enough now?
Now you're going to re,

984
00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:47.530
you know you've joined all our fucking men's clubs.

985
00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:49.270
We can't even get away from you.

986
00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:53.500
And one of the few pleasures we have left in life is the excitement of seeing a

987
00:59:53.501 --> 00:59:58.420
pair of tits,
talking our way and to see at a pair of fucking tits,
right?

988
00:59:58.770 --> 01:00:02.200
Couple of blue moons in a,
you know,
a Belvedere or some shit.

989
01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:06.370
You get her to do it and now you're going to take that away by just walking

990
01:00:06.371 --> 01:00:10.320
around with your God damn titties hanging out.
What would Audrey,

991
01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.640
Audrey Hepburn say,
hi.
What?
What the fuck would she say?

992
01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:16.120
Is that the right one that,
that breakfast at Tiffany's chick.

993
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:18.760
I use that fucking express that,
that,
that reference that.

994
01:00:18.761 --> 01:00:22.390
I've never seen that movie.
I've just seen pictures of it.

995
01:00:22.391 --> 01:00:25.090
And I think that that girl is,
she's a class act,

996
01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:30.900
unlike all you filthy whores nowadays with your hoary little car Dashi and shoes

997
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:36.510
with the fucking Paris Hilton Jizzum on my face straps and the Madonna hoary

998
01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:40.120
fishnets you know,

999
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:44.140
I know a lot of you guys because Madonna's like 63 at this point,

1000
01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:45.910
has been living in England for 20 years.

1001
01:00:45.911 --> 01:00:49.690
You actually think that she some high falutin she's the daughter of a trucker

1002
01:00:49.691 --> 01:00:51.730
from Michigan.
Don't ever forget that.
All right.

1003
01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:57.220
<v 0>And she's not full of me with a goddamn accent.
Uh,</v>

1004
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:59.280
Jesus.
Why am I trashing the Donna so far?

1005
01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:07.940
<v 7>My feet waiting in the winter wireless.</v>

1006
01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:33.350
<v 3>Matthew.</v>
