00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.890
Hey,
what's going on?
Is Bill Burn?
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.240
July 13th,

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.730
2015 what's going on?
How I,
yeah,

4
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.080
I just had a really embarrassing moment,
right?
It's Sunday afternoon.

5
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.090
Isn't there a song about Sunday afternoons?
Rainy days and Mondays.

6
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.800
Oh,
Jesus.
Sunday afternoon is now.
It goes,

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.930
no,
the,
um,
I just had a really embarrassing thing.

8
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.620
I fucking Andrew who sends me all the podcast Shit

9
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.850
and walking my dog around the block might Butoh the little dude and he tells me

10
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:45.030
to call him,
so I call him.
So he tells me that he's sending me the podcast shit.

11
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.950
So I go to it,
you know,

12
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.100
I come back with the dog and I go to fucking check my emails and it's not there.

13
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:56.070
In fact,
I haven't got one fucking emails since July 10th,
which never happens.

14
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:59.790
So I checked my little mini iPad thing.
It won't let,
it's refreshing.

15
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:03.420
It won't give me anything else that checked my fucking iPhone.
I got the six now.

16
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.260
Just like all you kids out there playing the fucking Avatar Games,

17
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:10.390
the one single person,
first person,
uh,

18
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.000
I'll blow your fucking face off in the comfort of my a attic bedroom.
All right.

19
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.870
I got,
I got the new one.
None of them,
no emails for two days.
So I'm like,

20
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:22.260
what the fuck?
This fucking happens to me all the time,
so I lose my shit,

21
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.850
uh,
calling Andrew up and he's going,
that's weird.
That's strange.

22
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:29.610
I never heard of that allies is that people always say about my shit.

23
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.400
And then he tells me he hasn't told us he hasn't sent it yet.

24
00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:36.030
Let me try sending them.
And then they came through.
So there was nothing wrong.

25
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.080
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

26
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.710
<v 1>it was just my dumb ass had not got an email in two days and I thought I was so</v>

27
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:43.380
fucking important that I at least get a little bit of spam.

28
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.300
<v 0>Okay.</v>

29
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.010
<v 1>So is so whatever,
this fucking egg and old freckles face here,
you know some,</v>

30
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:51.300
I'm starting off humble.

31
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.670
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.500
<v 2>Starting off humble,
like dead fucking Irish guy there with his chest tattoo,</v>

33
00:01:57.501 --> 00:01:58.280
running around,

34
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.910
talking all this shit that he was going to do to the half of the fucking world.

35
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.141
Now listen,

36
00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:06.590
I don't watch a lot of UFC so I don't even know any of the fucking names,

37
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.430
but I watched that,
you know,

38
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.590
and I'm part Irish and that guy skipping around like a fucking Leprechaun,

39
00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:16.380
talking all that shit.
It just fucking annoyed me.
So now I'm,

40
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.320
I'm now I'm rooting for Barney rubble and Latino Barney rubble.

41
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.880
That Mendez Dude,
right and fucking,
uh,
what,
what,

42
00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:28.170
what this face there who looks like he looks like a,

43
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.690
he looks like a combination of uh,
the guy from the spin doctors and uh,

44
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:34.850
that creepy mascot for Burger King.

45
00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:38.500
I can't figure out what he is except we can fucking spin around and put his heel

46
00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:40.430
and your temple.
All right.

47
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:44.990
So I'm watching this shit and he's talking all this shit and he's doing all that

48
00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:49.700
Roy Jones like,
I'm going to humiliate you while I beat you.

49
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.980
And a,
which is course is making me root for the little fella.
I mean,

50
00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:58.280
who do I see in there?
Even though that guy's a pasty fuck with red hair,

51
00:02:58.281 --> 00:03:01.830
just like me,
he's actually got a full head of hair.
The son of a bitch,
right?

52
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.620
<v 1>Um,
I want a root form.
You know what?</v>

53
00:03:06.621 --> 00:03:11.450
I make little fucking redhead solidarity.
I want a roof with this guy,

54
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.250
but he's such a cunt.
And the first,
halfway through the first round,

55
00:03:16.251 --> 00:03:20.290
I'm like,
you know what?
Fuck this guy.
Let's go show,

56
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.790
right.
I'm room full of little guy.

57
00:03:22.791 --> 00:03:25.490
Little guys fucking starts taking them to the mat.

58
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.580
He's fucking throwing elbows.

59
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.020
This fucking little fucking burger king guy is eating these things and then he

60
00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:35.330
gets up and he kind of nods like,
Oh yeah,
that was pretty good.

61
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.710
That was pretty good.
Pretty good.
You got to cut over your eye.
They're freckles,

62
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.410
right?
Next thing you know,
next round comes out.
Yeah,

63
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.710
<v 2>no fucking little guy.</v>

64
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.900
He's putting this freckled comment on his back ground and pound grounded and

65
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.120
ground and pound.
Okay.
And fucking a Ireland's burger king guy gets back up.

66
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.430
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.920
<v 2>He gets back up and all of a sudden he's not talking shit anymore.</v>

68
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.270
He's got a little fucking,
I was pretty good.
It was pretty good.
Pretty good.

69
00:04:02.271 --> 00:04:05.170
He was on top of you the whole fucking round.
Long story short,

70
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.460
I think it was the third round.
He fucking does it again.

71
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.290
He's just on top of this guy beating his fucking ass.
All right.

72
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.570
He gets up.

73
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.840
<v 0>Okay.</v>

74
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.800
<v 2>You know,
which is good on the fucking red headed dude.
He fucking gets up,</v>

75
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.760
Connor,
whatever.
Mcglaughlin or was it Sarah McLaughlin?

76
00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:25.370
I don't want to fuck his name.
Is Connor something or other,
right.

77
00:04:25.371 --> 00:04:30.140
He fucking gets up and uh,
the,
the little guys gassed,

78
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.520
the guy got two weeks' notice.

79
00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:35.590
This other fuck's been training for months to fight this Jose,
Josie,

80
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.750
whatever the fuck his name is.
Right.
So a little fellas gassed.

81
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.580
He catches a fucking left.
He goes down,
he's covered up.
He's not fighting back,

82
00:04:43.581 --> 00:04:46.160
but he's covering up and immediately the fucking dude stuff.

83
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.070
<v 1>I'd say I had to knock it off.
That'll be it.</v>

84
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.280
And then the spine doctors guy jumps up and down,
you know,

85
00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:56.400
jumps on the fucking cage.
You know,

86
00:04:56.401 --> 00:04:58.680
it starts crying into the Irish Ireland flag.

87
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.340
<v 0>Okay?</v>

88
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.970
<v 1>Okay.
Now I'm not saying that that fucking hires,
dude's not a bad ass fighter.</v>

89
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:07.870
I'm not saying that.
I'm just saying that little fellow,
he earned the right.

90
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.410
He earned the right to ride out that round,
get to the chair,

91
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:15.700
and then you look at them,
you want to go out again.
Granted he was gassed.

92
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.640
Maybe they saved him,
but you know,
I don't know.

93
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.940
I don't know shit about the sport.
I don't even know the fucking names,

94
00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:26.650
but all I can tell you was that evidently that was going to be a big fight.

95
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.460
You know when mayor mccheese there was going to fight Josie and the pussy,

96
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.600
whatever the fuck his name is,
right?
That's why the fight gay man,

97
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.620
I'm telling you right now,
anybody who who,

98
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.290
who is the Don King of the sport,
you should fucking,

99
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.290
you should have to dress like boss hog because to me,

100
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.990
that fucking reeked of a quick stoppage.

101
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.840
You can't tell me this is [inaudible].

102
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.850
Of course you can tell me the fuck do I know I'm just a comedian.
Right.

103
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.260
And I play one on TV too.
Right.

104
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.250
That just reeked of Holy Fuck.

105
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.790
We thought he was going to beat this little bastards ass and we're going to get

106
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:07.370
a two for one on the paper view here because everybody,

107
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:11.420
you know the Irish guy talks so much shit.
You're going to watch him anyways.

108
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.560
Right?
I know.
I sound like a moron.
Fuck Yo.

109
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:17.270
And it seemed like bullshit to me.

110
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.620
It just seemed like bullshit or maybe I've watched rocky too many times.

111
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:23.930
I wanted that little fella to fuck the whole thing up.

112
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:28.310
I wanted him to fuck up the big payday and it didn't happen.

113
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.150
Okay.
Hat's off to the Irish guy.
All right.

114
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.350
Double hats off cause he's also redhead,
you know,
he's making us look good.

115
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.300
God knows we'd take a bunch of shit.

116
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.040
I just thought it was a quick stoppage and good on him that he took that

117
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:46.790
pounding and was able to get back up again.
But I'll tell you right now,

118
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.730
that was not a good fight for that guy.

119
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.470
I would guess because I would think that the other guy would be like,
oh,

120
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.850
that's very interesting.

121
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.750
It's very interesting what that little fella there did on only fucking two weeks

122
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:03.710
training.
Isn't it amazing how much shit I'm giving to people who in this sleep?

123
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.571
Like walking in there,

124
00:07:04.571 --> 00:07:08.570
sleep could fucking choke me up the second I brushed up against them with any

125
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:11.480
sort of energy that they didn't like.
You know,

126
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.390
is it still muttering in this sleep about fucking a bullet.

127
00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:15.980
Cornflakes stayed still choke me out.

128
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.460
Doesn't stop me from talking shit like the bitch that I am in my own podcast and

129
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:26.270
the safety of my own,
uh,
my own,
uh,

130
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.160
office within my house.
Oh yeah.
I'll fucking talk shit about anybody in here.

131
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.270
You get me outside the confines of my gate.
Hey,
how are you?
Nice to see you.

132
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.100
I like your shirt.
Um,
anyways,
it was a great,
what a fucking,

133
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.920
if you didn't rent it,
man,
I would rent that shit.

134
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:48.190
UFC one 89 for as much as I'm being a little fucking rag and contour just wire

135
00:07:49.561 --> 00:07:53.840
to wire.
Every fight was a fucking knockout.
Was unbelievable.
You know,

136
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.440
my favorite part of the night was when Rogan was watching whatever fight it was

137
00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.210
where,
uh,

138
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.110
I don't fucking know this white dude was fighting this other guy and the guy's

139
00:08:03.111 --> 00:08:05.660
just swinging wildly and,
and uh,

140
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.650
Rogan actually laughed at one point,
you know,
not like,
you know,

141
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:13.220
no disrespect to the fight or he just was enjoying the fight and he sort of

142
00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:16.910
laughed and said,
this is a bar fight.
And,
uh,

143
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.290
this fucking maniac,
you know,
a lot of fighters,
you know,

144
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:24.170
after they win the fight,
when they're celebrating,
they look scary.

145
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:26.750
But the second they start talking this to totally chill,

146
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.520
there's a few of them that can't shut it off.
And you're like,
that guy,

147
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:32.031
you know,

148
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:36.890
like that big dude and the dirty dozen posey remember that?

149
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.940
Come on Posey,
stick them,
stack them.
Yeah,
yeah,
I'm pushing you.

150
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.850
And he's fucking Lee Marvins pushing him.
Then he just fucking snaps.
And he said,

151
00:08:44.851 --> 00:08:48.200
so I stop,
push and he can't fucking shut it off.

152
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.750
And he wants to drive fucking Lee Marvins knows right through his brain and keep

153
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:56.790
punching until he fucking goes is his fist.

154
00:08:56.791 --> 00:09:00.420
And his forum goes right through the brains of his entire fucking family tree.

155
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.580
Like that guy had like that energy.

156
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:04.030
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

157
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:07.710
<v 1>they,
there was so many sick.
I just really should know these fighters names,</v>

158
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.040
especially considering I'm trying to get in shape and these guys are in some of

159
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:15.390
the best shape he could possibly be.
And um,
I dunno,

160
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.460
I'm not gonna pretend like I know anything about the sport.

161
00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:21.600
All I can tell you was I 100% got my fucking money's worth.

162
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.280
And uh,
other than I just thought they stopped the fight a little too soon,

163
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:27.690
but really thinking about it,

164
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.640
I think I was just being selfish because I wanted that little dude to upset him.

165
00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:35.360
I got to stop calling little dude.
The guy was shorter than the fucking record.

166
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.450
Um,
he fucking,
I just,

167
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.810
I thought he earned the right to get to the fucking corner and be like,
dude,

168
00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:47.050
can you go,
are you gassed or whatever.
But then of course he's gonna say,
yeah,

169
00:09:47.051 --> 00:09:49.800
I can go on.
Then maybe he would actually really get fucked up.
You know,

170
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.260
you know bill,
maybe if you think about it,

171
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.920
maybe the official referee

172
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.290
of that paper view fight maybe knows a little bit more.

173
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.120
Maybe it was a little bit closer,

174
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.710
maybe has watched a few more fights than you did and maybe he stopped it at the

175
00:10:07.711 --> 00:10:11.880
right time.
Ah,
write whatever I wanted to see it keep going.

176
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.010
I want to see him put him on his back again.

177
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:15.870
<v 0>Okay.</v>

178
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.290
<v 1>God dammit.
I love when that happens.</v>

179
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.860
I love when an underdog fucks.
Like some dude comes in,

180
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.370
he's not supposed to fight this guy or it's just supposed to be this tune up,

181
00:10:26.371 --> 00:10:31.230
fight for the big fucking payday and this guy comes in and just fucking knocks

182
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:35.170
him out.
Knocked the dude out.
I always imagined like that would be that.

183
00:10:35.171 --> 00:10:40.050
That's what it would be like if you somehow interrupted like the new world

184
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:43.800
order.
You know,
and I'm not saying that this shape shifters,
but I'm saying if he,

185
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:46.350
if you honestly think that these fucking maniacs,

186
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.090
that there's not a group of people that want to run it all and own it all,

187
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.600
then I,
I dunno,
I dunno then I wish I was you.

188
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.240
I wish I lived where you lived and saw what you saw that you,

189
00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:01.870
you haven't seen that fucking human behavior.
But,
uh,

190
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:07.890
I dunno,
I'm out of my phone and I go,
fuck yourself.
It's a Sunday afternoon.

191
00:11:07.891 --> 00:11:09.990
I'm hanging out by myself.
My wife's not around.

192
00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:11.610
I've been talking to my dog all day.
Did you,

193
00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:16.200
do you think that this is gonna make sense?
Well done.

194
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:22.590
Um,
well did you,
I should have yelled.
Um,
anyways,
but,

195
00:11:22.591 --> 00:11:27.570
uh,
and the next UFC I go in and out of the UFC,
you know what I mean?

196
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.320
Like I do with like wrestling when they don't have a lot of good stars or

197
00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:33.150
whatever,
I start to fade or whatever.

198
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:37.020
I get busy and my fucking life I should watch it because whenever I watch it,

199
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.460
it motivates me to get in shape.
You know what I mean?

200
00:11:41.461 --> 00:11:43.230
Or if I even watched like the ultimate fighter,

201
00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:46.130
which I know that's kind of like making the band,
uh,

202
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.200
or who wants to be a millionaire for like fucking fighters.
You know what I mean?

203
00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:54.000
I don't know how many guys actually came out of that fucking that went on to do

204
00:11:54.001 --> 00:11:56.490
some shit.
You know?
I think most of them are like,

205
00:11:56.491 --> 00:12:00.390
you know those people that sing during the first week of American idol and all

206
00:12:00.391 --> 00:12:04.590
those people,
Jimmy crack card and I are I buddy,
you're not going to Vegas.

207
00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.050
And then they cried to the camera.

208
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.510
<v 3>At least I do it.
You know,
I carrier I truths about the cuts.</v>

209
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.950
<v 1>You know what I mean?
Most of them end up like that.
And as always,</v>

210
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.600
even that crying little fucking Douche bag could kick the shit out of me and

211
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.270
asleep.
I had met all of that before.
No,
you can't come at me like,

212
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.050
oh well maybe you want to talk shit about,

213
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.090
show me you can help you beat the fight.
Maybe you should go fuck yourself.

214
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.020
He says in the safety of his own office,
within his house,
behind his gait.

215
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.880
Um,
so anyways,
the next UFC,
which I,

216
00:12:41.881 --> 00:12:45.510
I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's going to be UFC,
uh,
one 90.

217
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.400
<v 4>Okay.</v>

218
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.770
<v 1>Um,
the constipation or whatever they've kind of out of adjectives.</v>

219
00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:52.060
I think they finally stopped doing that.

220
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.870
Remember that the revenge factor then it was like a deportation,

221
00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:05.020
um,
canceled reservation,
UFC one 43.
They just ran out.

222
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:06.730
So they just haven't,
they just call them by numbers now.

223
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.560
So I think one 90 is going to be,

224
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.330
that's going to be down in Brazil,
the beginning of August.

225
00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:18.240
And what's great is a rowdy Ronda Rousey.
Uh,

226
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:22.540
I hope I seven.
Is it Rhonda?
Rhonda Rousey?
How do I not remember names?

227
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.360
Once again,
someone else who kicked the shit out of me in her sleep.
Um,

228
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.660
she's fighting,

229
00:13:28.661 --> 00:13:32.980
she's fighting in Brazil and she's fighting the top woman in Brazil.

230
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:38.230
And what's great about that is I just,

231
00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.790
that's going to be so great to watch her shot an entire nation down.

232
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.160
You know,
I think the biggest problem,

233
00:13:45.161 --> 00:13:49.210
she's going to have his security trying to get the fuck outta there after she

234
00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:52.300
beats that woman's ass because I think she's gonna end.
You know why?

235
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.590
Because I watched about 0.8 seconds of highlights on,
on her opponent.

236
00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:00.910
You know what I mean?
Oh,
I'm talking about the fight game.

237
00:14:00.911 --> 00:14:05.050
I'm in way over my head.
Fuck you.
It's the dog days of summer.
Hockey's over.

238
00:14:05.051 --> 00:14:08.500
Basketball is over.
There's no football.
What do you want from me?

239
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.660
The fuck do you want from me?
So I don't know.

240
00:14:12.661 --> 00:14:16.170
Anything can happen is what I've learned.
Watching fights or whatever.

241
00:14:16.171 --> 00:14:18.870
And I know that Brazilian girl,
she's got one of those Brazilian booty,

242
00:14:18.871 --> 00:14:22.050
so who knows?
If she gets low,
she gets slow.
Who knows what can happen,

243
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:26.490
you know what I mean?
She puts that thing to fucking work.
Who knows?
Um,

244
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.990
but I don't think it's going to happen.
Um,
anyways.
Yeah,

245
00:14:30.991 --> 00:14:34.890
the dog days of summer.
So I watched a,
I missed them.

246
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.760
The men's final was today.
As I said,
I'm taping here on a Sunday.

247
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.890
Um,
congratulations to a Djokovich,
you know,

248
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:48.480
coming back after you lose in the French Open,
he beat Andy Federer.

249
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.470
I would have liked to have seen that.

250
00:14:49.471 --> 00:14:51.950
Maybe they'll replay it on the tennis channel,
watched the replays,

251
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.490
Serena winning the Serena Slam,
you know,

252
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.960
she won last year's us open,
then she won the Australia,

253
00:14:58.961 --> 00:15:01.040
and then she won the French and now she won Wimbledon.

254
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.810
So she wanted the last four in a row.

255
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:08.330
And who's getting knows she'll win the fucking USL.
But uh,
and the record is six,

256
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:13.550
I believe by Martina net that travel,
Lola,
um,
I think and um,

257
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.060
by going like glanced at Wikipedia for two seconds.
I have no idea.
But,
uh,

258
00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:17.894
I'm rooting for her.

259
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:22.400
She needs one more to tie Steffi Graf and obviously one more after that and

260
00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:23.510
she'll have one the most ever,

261
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.490
which is pretty amazing that not only she could do that,

262
00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:29.990
but she could do it at her age.
Um,
Ge built that was very informative.

263
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:35.000
It wasn't funny on any fucking level.
Our right.
Relax.
Okay.

264
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:39.950
So as I mentioned last week,
oh,
freckles.

265
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:45.120
All freckles is on the wagon.
Show me the way to go home.
Boom,

266
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:49.340
boom.
I'm tired and I won't,
I'll go to bed.
Um,

267
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:54.440
I've been on the wagon now for seven days,
no booze.

268
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.920
And um,
I was,
uh,
like a buck 81,

269
00:15:57.921 --> 00:16:02.921
86.6 my way and I wanted to lose three pounds a week for the next like two

270
00:16:04.341 --> 00:16:07.520
months to get myself down to my fighting weight.

271
00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:12.521
And I got on the scale this afternoon and I was one 83.2,

272
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.600
so I actually lost 3.4 pounds.
So next week,

273
00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:22.370
you know,
I need to be down to one 80.
So if you want to do it with me,

274
00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:26.180
this is what I'm doing.
This is my diet,
this works,

275
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.680
this what's works from me and what I'm doing.
I wake up in the morning,

276
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.010
I take my dog,
Oh,

277
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:39.610
I take my dog for like an hour long hike and a,

278
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.730
I come back and then I,
um,

279
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:50.080
I have oatmeal and a banana and then between lunch and uh,

280
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.670
in breakfast I either have an apple or an orange.

281
00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.860
And so I get two helpings of fruit before 12.
After 12.

282
00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.050
If I'm going to have,
I'll only have a vegetable,

283
00:17:03.051 --> 00:17:05.600
I won't have a fruit just because it's got all this sugar.

284
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:10.860
So then for lunch,
as you can tell,
this is not an exciting die.

285
00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.210
And as you can tell by the incredible lack of passion in my voice,

286
00:17:14.211 --> 00:17:19.010
but it's working for me.
You know,
as Whitney and Bobby Brown used to say,

287
00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:23.390
it works.
It works for me.
It works.
Sorry,
I have a black wife,

288
00:17:23.391 --> 00:17:25.400
so I see stuff like that on TV.

289
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:31.490
I have a black wife,
my wife is black,
African American.

290
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:37.550
Um,
so anyways,
um,
anybody remember that episode?

291
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:42.140
Whitney and Bobby Brown.
It's kind of tragic now obviously.
Really you think so?

292
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:44.870
Bill said daughters in a coma,
um,

293
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.380
when they were fucking in the store and they were trying to enhance or
something,

294
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:52.140
sunglasses and they were both probably high and they go and does it work?

295
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.530
It works.
And then they just started doing this song.
It works.
It works for me.

296
00:17:55.531 --> 00:17:58.170
It works doing this fucking dance and everyone's staring at him.

297
00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:03.510
I was actually a nice moment
anyways.
Uh,

298
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:09.030
what was I talking about?
Oh yeah.
So,
and then in the afternoon,

299
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:14.670
um,
what do I usually have in the afternoon?
That's kind of whatever.
I don't know.

300
00:18:14.671 --> 00:18:17.670
That's,
that's a little weird.
The afternoon one.

301
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.110
The fuck do I usually have,
I tried to have something healthy that's usually,

302
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:24.150
I'll have like a bowl of cereal,
just something,

303
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:29.280
something to throw a little flare into the day.
But then at night I go,
uh,

304
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:34.380
I eat super healthy right around between five and six,
you know,
protein,

305
00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:36.990
the size of the palm of your hand and then just a bunch of vegetables.

306
00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:41.050
And then I just crushed fucking waters for the rest of the night.
Um,

307
00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.730
and I'm not drinking anything else but water to be honest with Ya.
And uh,

308
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.900
and then if I do get hungry at night and I need a late night snack,

309
00:18:48.901 --> 00:18:52.710
I have a bunch of celery sticks already cut up and I'll take like a fucking,

310
00:18:52.711 --> 00:18:56.730
like a spoonful of peanut butter.
I know,
I know,
but you know what?
It works.

311
00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:58.050
It works.

312
00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:01.440
Fucking fucking I only got gotta do is just live like this for three fucking

313
00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:05.130
months and I can get down to my fighting weight,
not three months,
two months.

314
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:09.840
And uh,
yeah,
do it with me.
Eight Times three,
that's 20 of,

315
00:19:09.841 --> 00:19:13.020
you'll lose 24 pounds with me.
All right.
Do it with me.

316
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.620
Get you a beach body like me in September.

317
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.180
So anyways,
you don't even have to do this shit.

318
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:25.990
I'm just telling you guys that I'm going to do it.
So I stay off the,

319
00:19:25.991 --> 00:19:30.420
I stay on the wagon,
Freudian slip there,
stay on the wagon.

320
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.990
And then I also continued to drop my three pounds a week.
Um,

321
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.690
whatever man.
You know what I mean?

322
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.410
Next week we'll be six pounds and in between week two and three,

323
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:44.040
that's when people start noticing which motivates you even more so,
uh,

324
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.353
you know,
Jesus.

325
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.860
And then I just spent doing like the pushups and the pull ups and that type of

326
00:19:49.861 --> 00:19:50.850
thing.
Um,

327
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.440
Bert Kreischer sent me this thing on Twitter about how to improve your grip

328
00:19:55.441 --> 00:19:57.900
strength,
this men's health thing.

329
00:19:57.901 --> 00:20:00.270
In the first exercise I've actually been able to,

330
00:20:00.271 --> 00:20:04.600
I got myself worked up that I can do is basically you hang from a chin up bar a

331
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:09.210
three sets of one minute,
um,
which you wouldn't think it's hard,
but it is.

332
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:13.500
It can be at whatever.
If you're a fat fuck,
like I am.
Oh God,

333
00:20:13.501 --> 00:20:16.260
I hate myself right now.
Um,
so that's what I'm doing.

334
00:20:16.261 --> 00:20:19.110
I'm eating right and I'm watching the UFC and watching boxing.

335
00:20:19.111 --> 00:20:24.030
I'm just looking at people in shape,
you know what I mean?
If you're a fat fuck,

336
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:28.710
watch men that are in shape with your wife and you'll feel it on.

337
00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:31.380
I like God,
I wish my husband looked like that and I'm telling you,

338
00:20:31.381 --> 00:20:35.430
it'll motivate you to get down there and get on a fucking Matt.
Um,

339
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:39.870
so anyways,
hey,
listen,
I got an idea here.
I know when I promote this right now.

340
00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:44.180
So,
you know,
I sell these posters on the road and uh,
I'd come home and I'll,

341
00:20:44.181 --> 00:20:47.220
I'll have some extra ones and I autographed in my,
send them out,

342
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:51.150
we shipped them out,
people by him and we ship them out.
So the last time,
um,

343
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:56.760
we had the ones from the,
uh,
the southern tour and uh,
you know,

344
00:20:56.761 --> 00:21:01.200
we ship those out.
Everybody got their fucking orders,
you know,
no problem.

345
00:21:01.201 --> 00:21:03.990
But it did take longer.
A lot of people were like,
where the fuck is it?

346
00:21:03.991 --> 00:21:06.990
Cause it took us a long time to get them out because we do everything ourselves

347
00:21:06.991 --> 00:21:08.700
here.
So no,
this,

348
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.050
all the posters we have that are left over from my,
uh,

349
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.050
my week in Boston where I did the 19 shows.

350
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:17.783
<v 5>MMM.</v>

351
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:23.000
<v 1>Those are all autographed and they're already packaged in the tube ready to go.</v>

352
00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:27.560
All we need is for you to order them and um,
we'll just slap a label on them.

353
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:32.590
And my guy is telling me that these fuckers will be out by,

354
00:21:32.931 --> 00:21:36.770
uh,
by Tuesday.
So they will go on sale.

355
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:38.833
<v 5>MMM.</v>

356
00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.810
<v 1>Tonight at 10:00 PM Pacific Time,
which is fucking stupid.
I'm going to,</v>

357
00:21:42.811 --> 00:21:43.644
I got to tweet about it.
Yeah.

358
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:45.543
<v 5>MMM.</v>

359
00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:49.160
<v 1>They're all autographed and whatnot.
And uh,</v>

360
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.500
what else?
All right.
Oh,
well,
see if you don't want to,
if you want to,
um,

361
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.560
send an email to the podcast,
it's bill@themmpodcast.com.

362
00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.160
That's where you send it.
And um,

363
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.360
<v 5>okay,</v>

364
00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:01.690
<v 1>whatever.</v>

365
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:06.690
So if you'd like an autographed poster poster from my historic run or stupid

366
00:22:06.761 --> 00:22:10.650
run,
depending on who you are of 19 shows in Boston,
uh,

367
00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:14.140
we had some leftover ones.
We had about,
uh,
about three,
400 of them.

368
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:15.520
I got them all autographed.

369
00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:18.880
They make a great gift for someone that you like or maybe don't give a fuck

370
00:22:18.881 --> 00:22:22.810
about the 20 bucks plus the shipping.
You can order them right off my website,

371
00:22:22.811 --> 00:22:27.790
[inaudible] dot com just click click on the merchant page.
And,
uh,
like I said,

372
00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:31.420
we already got them all boxed up or tubed up,
whatever you're supposed to say,

373
00:22:31.421 --> 00:22:35.950
and they're ready to go.
So if you want one,
uh,
I would appreciate it buying it.

374
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:39.400
It's not,
I get it.
I get it.
Um,

375
00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:44.500
so anyways,
anyways,
what else did I want to talk about?

376
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:45.820
I'm going through here.
Oh,

377
00:22:45.821 --> 00:22:48.790
thank you to everybody that's sent me in all the information about the Ford

378
00:22:48.791 --> 00:22:49.624
galaxies.

379
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:54.580
I should've mentioned that I wanted a two door and I believe I said 65 or 66.

380
00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:59.320
A lot of people sent me shit from 63 64 68.
That was still cool.

381
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.520
67 cause I got to learn how the car has changed.
But um,

382
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:09.130
um,
two of them were really what I wanted and I called both and they were already

383
00:23:09.131 --> 00:23:10.510
gone.
So,
um,

384
00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:15.340
I think once a month I'll put the word out to you guys and I'll keep looking for

385
00:23:15.341 --> 00:23:19.000
it.
But uh,
you know,
I don't know,

386
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:21.910
didn't work out this week.
What are you gonna do?
I already got my truck,

387
00:23:21.911 --> 00:23:23.500
my trucks go on my,
it's not starting well,

388
00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.510
I figured out what the antifreeze thing was.

389
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:30.600
I had it parked on this really steep hill and just cause it's fucking old.

390
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.900
It doesn't have any stop.
I Dunno,

391
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:38.410
something to block the fuck antifreeze just started dribbling out overnight.

392
00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.670
So it wasn't even that much.
But uh,

393
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.230
there's been no antifreeze not eat anything that's dripped out since then.

394
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.510
And if you saw the amount that was there in the morning,

395
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.380
you would think I had a major problem.
Um,

396
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.630
and nothing has happened ever since then.
And yes,

397
00:23:53.631 --> 00:23:56.840
thank you to everybody out there who told me to check the radiator to make sure

398
00:23:56.841 --> 00:23:58.790
he had enough antifreeze.
I did do that,

399
00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:01.610
but I appreciate you letting me know anyways.
And uh,

400
00:24:01.611 --> 00:24:04.530
so everything's all good with that.
And I fucking love driving the truck,
so,

401
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:09.040
so there you go.
So,
so here we go.
Um,

402
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.470
let's see.
What am I going to talk about it?

403
00:24:12.471 --> 00:24:14.000
She said the whole fucking podcasts just fell up.

404
00:24:14.001 --> 00:24:15.920
That's why you don't do those announcements in the middle of it.

405
00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:20.000
It kills my whole,
my whole fucking whatever.
Oh,

406
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:24.020
I didn't mention you don't want to eat dinner.
I,
I basically,
I dunno,

407
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:25.760
I eat steak or a chicken.

408
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:29.600
I try to stay away from fish unless it's like salmon and I only eat salmon

409
00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:32.780
because we can,
we grow it ourselves in a fucking petri dish.

410
00:24:32.781 --> 00:24:34.820
And even though it might cause cancer someday,

411
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:37.790
I don't think I'm more important than all the fish in the fucking ocean.

412
00:24:37.791 --> 00:24:41.450
So I'm going to roll the dice that that genetically altered fucked up salmon

413
00:24:41.451 --> 00:24:46.340
that I'm eating is not as bad as it probably is.
But,
um,

414
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:46.611
you know,

415
00:24:46.611 --> 00:24:50.980
I was watching shark week this week on the discovery channel and those guys have

416
00:24:50.981 --> 00:24:52.160
got to give it up to discovery channel.

417
00:24:52.161 --> 00:24:56.990
They've come a long way on way they own the way that they depict sharks,

418
00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:01.960
but they still always have like that jaws fucking vibe to it.
And I really,

419
00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.910
it's fucking reprehensible that they do it.
But at the end of the day,

420
00:25:04.911 --> 00:25:06.380
you know what,
they're not scientists.

421
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.440
They're a fucking network and they don't give a fuck about nature.

422
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.560
You know what I mean?
They always got to do that shit.
Like,

423
00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:16.220
like the shark has some personal vendetta,

424
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:22.100
like in all those jaws movies,
like after,
like after they fought off the shark,

425
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.550
they start driving away,
you know,
when the boat that,

426
00:25:25.551 --> 00:25:29.570
whatever you do sailing away what it does,
no sale I guess should drive away,

427
00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:33.680
right.
Whatever the fuck they're doing.
And then the shark follows them.

428
00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.420
Like the sharks,
I call these,
you motherfuckers think that shit is over,

429
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:44.910
right?
Like it wants to kill these fucking people.
Um,

430
00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.120
but then again it's just a movie.

431
00:25:47.121 --> 00:25:50.180
You would think that the discovery channel wouldn't have that they had this

432
00:25:50.181 --> 00:25:52.340
fucking one.
Right.
You know,

433
00:25:52.341 --> 00:25:54.890
and I always watched the first three quarters because once they start going to

434
00:25:54.891 --> 00:25:55.724
the end,

435
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:59.270
they start showing what we're doing and how many sharks were killing and it
will,

436
00:25:59.271 --> 00:26:00.800
how bad we're fucking up the ocean.

437
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:04.720
Like I saw something on the discovery channel with his scientist was going at

438
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.760
this fish market in a,

439
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:12.850
somewhere in like Southeast Asia and he just,

440
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.950
he goes once she just mentally get past all the mount sheer amount of,

441
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:21.410
of dead fish there that are being consumed every fucking day.

442
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:23.210
What he,
he's looking,

443
00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:28.270
what he's looking at is the different species and what he's finding is he seeing

444
00:26:30.201 --> 00:26:33.530
species of fish that you never saw in a fish market anymore.

445
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:37.940
And that's because they used to drag the nets,
you know,

446
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.470
up at the surface.
And now because that's basically been fished out,

447
00:26:42.471 --> 00:26:46.200
we are now like,
I don't know how many feet down.

448
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.113
It was some

449
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:50.460
<v 4>level of,
of</v>

450
00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.320
<v 1>whatever the fuck it was.
How many?
600 feet,
500 feet.</v>

451
00:26:54.321 --> 00:26:55.160
I don't what the fuck we were,

452
00:26:55.170 --> 00:27:00.170
but it sent chills down my spine like what the fuck are we doing and why isn't

453
00:27:00.711 --> 00:27:04.400
anybody talking about it in political office?
Right.
They,

454
00:27:04.401 --> 00:27:08.270
so they were dragging up species of fish that you just never seen a fish market.

455
00:27:08.271 --> 00:27:11.780
Just for the simple fact.
They never dragged the nets down that low.
And uh,

456
00:27:11.781 --> 00:27:14.560
there's a couple of fucked up look and sharks and like,

457
00:27:14.561 --> 00:27:18.110
do you know those fish that you know,
you start getting so fucking low,
you know,

458
00:27:18.111 --> 00:27:20.510
they have an eyes.
Isn't that important?

459
00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.160
Finding some really fucked up look and stuff like you.

460
00:27:25.161 --> 00:27:27.980
Like is that from this planet?
I've never seen one of those before.

461
00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:32.900
So I'm trying to lay off Sushi and I'm trying to lay off all that stuff.
So I've,

462
00:27:32.901 --> 00:27:35.030
I've dropped that down and I did.

463
00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:38.990
A lot of my friends are telling me that the bison and that type of shit,

464
00:27:38.991 --> 00:27:42.630
anything that we,
I'm going to just try to eat shit that we,
um,

465
00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.080
like pigs,
cows,
chickens,
even though I know they're not fucking healthy.

466
00:27:48.081 --> 00:27:48.914
But I mean,

467
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:53.030
at least we're reproducing that shit and considering where the ones that have

468
00:27:53.031 --> 00:27:57.200
fucking it up anyways,
shouldn't I be the one that eats it?
You know,

469
00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:02.000
you shouldn't,
I die rather than a bunch of fucking fish.
I Dunno.

470
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:06.740
I watching that shit and going on that debt bus tour I took through California,

471
00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.330
right.
Fucking hilarious.

472
00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.930
Me and Joe Barden or going to a giant bus just tearing up the fucking
atmosphere.

473
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:16.970
Such a hypocrite,
you know,
but I'm cutting down on the fish,
dude.

474
00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:21.080
I'm just seeing how low the water is out here.

475
00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:24.880
It's a,
it's a fucking,
you know,
it's getting there,
dude.

476
00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.910
It's slow down even slowly.
It's fucking getting crazy out there.
So,

477
00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.760
um,
I dunno,

478
00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.580
the one exciting thing I heard about the weather out here is they might have an

479
00:28:34.581 --> 00:28:38.300
El Nino,
so it would actually give us some rain,

480
00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.140
not nearly enough as we need,
but at least some fucking rain.

481
00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.170
So a,
I'm really hoping for that.

482
00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:48.590
I'm hoping that's going to happen for the next four fucking years in a row

483
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.290
because a,
I dunno,
going over the,
uh,

484
00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:55.300
the Hoover and seeing how low the fucking water was was pretty scary.

485
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.890
Why do you need to hear about this?
You don't need to fucking hear about it.

486
00:28:57.891 --> 00:29:01.220
Right?
What do I Bamani out to beginning of Gi bill?
Really?

487
00:29:01.221 --> 00:29:05.300
Is The fucking world going to hell in a handbasket we'd get it.
Um,

488
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:06.660
<v 4>okay.</v>

489
00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:07.231
<v 1>So anyways,</v>

490
00:29:07.231 --> 00:29:11.730
I watched a little bit of the Yankees Red Sox today cause I miss the men's final

491
00:29:11.731 --> 00:29:15.060
and it was fucking nothing else on.
And um,

492
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.610
I gotta be honest,
Dude.
You know,

493
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.050
I don't think other than put Detroit or teas and Zander bogarts I don't know

494
00:29:22.051 --> 00:29:26.280
anybody on our fucking team.
Um,
except that guy from the outfield,

495
00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:32.050
Shane Victorino,
I guess I know four guys.
Yeah,

496
00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:37.460
I didn't know any Yankees and it was really weird to see it looked like Alfonso

497
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.620
Soriano which short?
Um,
I dunno,

498
00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:42.490
they kind of looked like the Yankees looked like the,

499
00:29:42.491 --> 00:29:46.780
the like the Dave Righetti Yankees to me.
And um,

500
00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.410
I don't know the red sox stuff like the fucking 88 red sox to me it's really

501
00:29:50.411 --> 00:29:53.920
sort of a weird time.
But I watched a couple of headings,
you know,

502
00:29:53.921 --> 00:29:58.180
we were down to nothing.
We went up three to two.
I made an effort.

503
00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:04.090
I made it an effort.
Um,
so next week I fly up to the Montreal comedy festival.

504
00:30:04.091 --> 00:30:07.960
I'm doing a Blues Festival in Ottawa.
If you want to get tickets,

505
00:30:07.961 --> 00:30:12.670
just go to [inaudible] dot com and then,
uh,
I'm doing two shows in Montreal.

506
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:21.490
Yeah,
I'm going up there.
I'm going to have a good fucking time.
Um,

507
00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:25.810
and as a trash my Bruins for not making the playoffs.
All I gotta say is,

508
00:30:25.811 --> 00:30:30.370
and how did you guys do?
Oh,
we made the playoffs.
Oh,
did ya?

509
00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:33.460
Did you win the cup?
Yeah,
that's what I thought.

510
00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:39.690
I'm 22 years and counting of the fucking,

511
00:30:41.981 --> 00:30:45.340
this is the longest drought in Montreal,
Canadian history.

512
00:30:45.341 --> 00:30:48.880
And I am enjoying every fucking day of it,

513
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:53.620
every fucking day of it.
Um,
and you know who's getting hit with the Bruins?

514
00:30:53.621 --> 00:30:54.850
I don't know what we're going to do next year.

515
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.600
I have no fucking idea how you replaced Lucida.
What do you do?

516
00:30:58.601 --> 00:31:02.050
You sign some fucking goon from Philly that that's supposed to fill the void.

517
00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:07.990
Um,
I dunno.
I'm still fucking shell shocked with the Bruins.

518
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:11.110
Did we fucking do that shit every,
every fucking time?
Somebody will,
you know,

519
00:31:11.111 --> 00:31:13.570
they wanted to know.
You can't trick you,
punch you months.

520
00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:17.740
Some point you got to pay.
Somebody's got to get in.
Had a fuck.

521
00:31:17.741 --> 00:31:21.160
Do you get rid of Lou Cheech?
Everybody had a bad year.

522
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.620
He under fucking produced.

523
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.740
Maybe you guys didn't put the right team on the fucking ice.

524
00:31:26.741 --> 00:31:29.890
What's he supposed he supposed to do?
All of it.
All right.
All right.
All right.

525
00:31:29.891 --> 00:31:33.620
What am I doing?
I'm yelling at my own fucking team here anyways.
Um,

526
00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.170
so yeah,
so I'm doing two shows up in Montreal,
um,

527
00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.050
Wednesday and Thursday of next week.

528
00:31:41.051 --> 00:31:45.160
So that would be 15 and set to 22nd and the 23rd.

529
00:31:45.161 --> 00:31:48.640
I'm doing shows at a theater up there.
I think if they're not sold out,

530
00:31:48.641 --> 00:31:49.960
they're close to being sold out.

531
00:31:49.961 --> 00:31:54.961
But if you'd like to watch me play drums when I'm up there Monday,

532
00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.920
Tuesday and Thursday,
the seven o'clock show,
the goddamn comedy jam,

533
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.880
I am going to be up there.
Um,

534
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:08.820
playing a song each night,
having a great time telling stories about,
uh,

535
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.700
my failed drumming career and all the,
all the awful fucking,
I,

536
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.290
it wasn't even ever even in a band.
I never even got my drums out of my basement.

537
00:32:17.291 --> 00:32:21.940
My people used to just come over and we will play.
And uh,
you know,

538
00:32:21.941 --> 00:32:23.410
I was always the worst fucking guy,

539
00:32:23.411 --> 00:32:27.270
so I get plenty of funny stories to tell about that shit.
So,
um,

540
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:31.080
anyways,
let's,
let's get to some of the fucking questions here for,
Oh,

541
00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:35.080
you know what?
I haven't done the fucking advertising for this week.
You know,

542
00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.570

Pick eight position players and pick up your cash.
That's all you gotta do.

Everybody every fucking week.
Quit your day job,

Just pick two pictures,
eight position players and pick up your cash.

566
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:03.530
Just ask her.

567
00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:08.030
I'd take her to a movie and get your Dick Sucked every fucking time.

568
00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:12.800
That's it.
Hey,

Whoever the fuck that is.

569

00:34:54.171 --> 00:34:58.850
I like how you get to put a team together and you get to play commissioner.
Uh,

581
00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:00.890

I'm telling you right now that has,

586
00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:15.010
that has Bryant Gumbel written all over it where he then,
you know,

587
00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:19.030
then major league baseball had no comment on it and then somehow he ties it in

588
00:35:19.031 --> 00:35:22.810
with Pete rose.
Where do you draw the line?
All right,
let's get out.

589
00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:26.800
Let's get off my soapbox here.
Okay.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:47.730
Oh yeah.

I can't keep singing this song.
I,

I'm odd things that rhyme with sweaty balls,

597
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:57.600
balls,
falls,

beyond age,

598
00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:02.050

No more prank calls,
but Oh,

599
00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:06.430

606
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:29.550

607
00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:34.020
Ds Wear Red on my balls.
Yeah.
Again,

608

It doesn't work.</v>

614
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:57.390
Maybe a spin doctor song and honor with that guy with the chest tattoo.
Um,

615
00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.750
what was the spin doctor?
What can you get back to the copy bill?
Um,

616
00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.550

it's the most comfortable underwear you will ever try on.

618

And it's insane how good they may keep balls feel they fit perfectly.

619
00:37:13.271 --> 00:37:14.350
They don't ride up on you.

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:15.270
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

621

screaming out in the middle of a meeting and there's nobody there.

625
00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.250
And then you don't get a raise.

626
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:31.110
And they literally pull moisture away from your skin so you stay cool.

627
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.900
Uh,
but they also make you look great.

but you have to turn up.

632
00:37:45.511 --> 00:37:49.470
Try them on for yourself.

That's still one 65 Ford galaxy 502 door runs very well.

711
00:42:33.061 --> 00:42:37.830
That means it's a piece of shit.
Two 89 v eight motor motor,

automatic transition white with Ivy Interior.

Looks like it's blue to me.

715
00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:50.670
All chrome is with the car.

716
00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.130
Oh Jesus.
This is getting bad.

717
00:42:53.131 --> 00:42:57.780
Original chrome rust free frame interior is original and needs to be restored.

718
00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:00.840
This is a North Carolina car in his solid everywhere.

719
00:43:00.841 --> 00:43:02.760
If you're looking for a good drug,

Thank you for every whoever sent me that one.

723
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:21.890
Um,
all right,
garden.
Oh,

724
00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.030
something got cut off here since Thursday.

725
00:43:24.031 --> 00:43:28.470
Podcast bill I'm obsessed with and then it just says t I don't know what you're

726
00:43:28.471 --> 00:43:31.170
obsessed with.
All right,
guard Billy Green thumb.

727
00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:33.690
I think someone uses this before.
I don't think they did.

728
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:36.750
I was listening to old podcasts.
You were talking about making your,

729
00:43:36.751 --> 00:43:41.000
your makeshift garden out there in Los Los Angeles.
Can we have an update?
Yeah.

730
00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:45.090
The update is we are in a biblical level drought and um,

731
00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:49.950
you know,
I'm not allowed to water my grass and that type of shit.
So,
uh,

732
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:53.910
you know,
I just water what I have.
I've got a couple of tomato plants.

733
00:43:53.911 --> 00:43:55.560
I got a lemon and lime tree.

734
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:58.860
Do you believe I've got a lime tree and not an avocado tree?

735
00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:02.010
What a fucking jerk off.
So,
um,

736
00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:06.450
I got to make sure I,
uh,
I handle that.
Oh Great.
Why is it reloading?

737
00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:11.010
What is going on here?
Um,
I'm all for that though.

738
00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:14.190
Growing your own food and that type of stuff and uh,
you know,

739
00:44:14.191 --> 00:44:15.840
during this time I'm not not yoga man.

740
00:44:15.841 --> 00:44:18.100
I'm really going to try to eat a lot less fish than I,

741
00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:21.720
as much as I joke about it.
That is a serious fucking problem.
And,
uh,

742
00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:23.460
I'm gonna try to,

743
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.510
I'm actually going to try to learn to make a couple of Vegan meals that actually

744
00:44:27.511 --> 00:44:30.720
tastes good cause I'm always going to eat steak and that type of shit.

745
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:34.500
But I'm just going to try to incorporate a couple of those things because,
uh,

746
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:38.910
it keeps you in shape,
man.
It does.
And it helps you lose fucking weight.

747
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:43.230
So anyways,
um,
so that is the update.
Uh,

748
00:44:43.231 --> 00:44:47.510
I wish I had a whole garden,
but I don't,
and I'm,

749
00:44:47.511 --> 00:44:48.960
I'm hoping eventually I can.

750
00:44:48.961 --> 00:44:52.390
I'm just hoping the water comes back here someday and if it doesn't,

751
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:54.200
I'm going to take a bath on this house.

752
00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:00.910
Alrighty.
Music a bill.

753
00:45:00.911 --> 00:45:04.960
My wife has great taste in music except for stuff that really sucks.

754
00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:09.910
Uh,
you kind of went two ways there,
um,
of Nias music.

755
00:45:09.911 --> 00:45:13.570
What group or band or a genre do you absolutely have?

756
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:17.800
Do you have absolutely no ability to swallow?
Um,

757
00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:21.670
my wife has unbelievable taste in music,
uh,

758
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:24.910
particularly shit that I wouldn't be exposed to,

759
00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:28.150
especially at my age of 47 year old white guy.

760
00:45:28.151 --> 00:45:30.880
I'm not going to know what the latest,
you know,

761
00:45:30.881 --> 00:45:35.650
even just hits are in the whole rap world.
Um,
and you guys owe me a big,

762
00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:39.340
a big pat on the back there because I didn't use the expression hip hop.

763
00:45:39.341 --> 00:45:42.940
I didn't want you guys to hear that coming out of my fucking mouth.
Um,

764
00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:48.160
so I stay up on,
you know,
if she sees you,
always listen to some fucking,

765
00:45:48.161 --> 00:45:52.060
you know,
I like to make money,
get that shit.

766
00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:56.140
Got The white girl market Paula Park and follow up work.
That guy.

767
00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:01.600
Um,
she let shit she listens to that,

768
00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:06.460
um,
why clef rocky or whatever the fuck his name is.

769
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:11.020
Hashtag rocky moneybags dollar sign rocky.

770
00:46:11.021 --> 00:46:14.980
I can't remember what his fucking name is.
She listens to a little Wayne,

771
00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:19.690
uh,
Kanye,
who I can't,
I can't stand.

772
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:20.770
I listened to that guy.

773
00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.890
He just tells me about how awesome he is and all this stuff he has.

774
00:46:23.891 --> 00:46:27.700
It's excruciating.
We boring.
Um,

775
00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.460
but he isn't,
he's not bored with himself at all.

776
00:46:30.461 --> 00:46:33.820
He is absolutely amazed with how amazing he is.

777
00:46:33.821 --> 00:46:36.250
Wood and God knows that's fun to listen to.

778
00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:42.690
Oh yes.
By all means.
Tell me,
tell me in another verse why you're so awesome.

779
00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:48.510
Um,
anyways,
you know something,

780
00:46:48.511 --> 00:46:52.020
I'll tell you right now,
the stuff that,
it's not her music.
She has great,

781
00:46:52.021 --> 00:46:54.390
great taste in music.
And I like,

782
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:58.470
she's one of those people that you can just grab her fucking iPhone and put it

783
00:46:58.471 --> 00:47:02.520
on shuffle and just put it on in a party and nothing embarrassing comes on.

784
00:47:02.521 --> 00:47:04.570
Everybody's like,
fuck,
what a song is that?
What song is that?

785
00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:08.640
Like she's really up on all the good fucking music.

786
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:11.990
But um,
so anyways,
uh,

787
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.050
the thing that bothers me is the shit that she watches on TV.
Oh,

788
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:20.160
Jesus Christ as she watched some dumb shit,
man.
You know,

789
00:47:20.161 --> 00:47:23.940
and a lot of smart women watch that reality Shit.

790
00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:26.880
Evidently they like it.
And even all this smart,
it's like,
you know,

791
00:47:26.881 --> 00:47:29.740
I guess it's like me watching sports.
Hang on one second.

792
00:47:29.741 --> 00:47:32.350
The companies who are going to close the door,
hold on,
hold on,
hang on,
hang on,

793
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:34.623
<v 4>hang on.</v>

794
00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:40.340
<v 1>So anyways,
she watches all those uh,</v>

795
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:44.740
fucking real housewives shows.

796
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.000
<v 4>Okay.</v>

797
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.940
<v 1>But what she did recently,
and this was devastating,</v>

798
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:57.000
what does that sound?
I thought she was talking to my wife yelling me.

799
00:47:57.001 --> 00:48:01.950
She put the TV on.
This is my,
my wife bought Kim Kardashian.

800
00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.340
I'm just shitting on this whole couple,
you know,
God bless him keys,

801
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:08.850
the cells at the staples center in,
she goes shopping,
whatever the fuck she does.

802
00:48:08.851 --> 00:48:11.100
Right.
God bless both of them continued success.

803
00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:12.943
<v 4>MMM.</v>

804
00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.610
<v 1>She,
she,
Kim Kardashian put out this book.</v>

805
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:19.240
<v 4>Okay.</v>

806
00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.073
<v 1>Okay.</v>

807
00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:20.740
<v 4>Okay.</v>

808
00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.770
<v 1>In all the whole book is nothing but her selfies.</v>

809
00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.530
She pulled out a book of selfies of herself.

810
00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:29.510
Not like a bunch of people taking selfies.

811
00:48:29.511 --> 00:48:30.620
That would have been bad enough but it was,

812
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:35.650
it's all pictures of her and the cover of it is her just standing there with

813
00:48:37.551 --> 00:48:39.020
their arms extended out,
you know,

814
00:48:39.021 --> 00:48:43.890
taking a picture with the pouty lips in her hair,
all wet and

815
00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:45.340
<v 4>okay.</v>

816
00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:48.610
<v 1>I,
you know,
you know that overly used expression like you know,</v>

817
00:48:48.611 --> 00:48:53.200
this marks the beginning of the end of civilization as we know it.

818
00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:57.180
I hate when people say that.
Alright cause nothing does.

819
00:48:57.181 --> 00:49:01.920
It's a gradual decline.
All right.
It's just another step.

820
00:49:01.921 --> 00:49:05.940
But that thing there,
if ever I was going to say like I get really got,

821
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.350
I got depressed.
When I look at it,
it makes me,

822
00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:14.860
it gives me this awful feeling.
When I look at it,
I can't describe it.

823
00:49:14.861 --> 00:49:19.861
It's just like that I feel like there's a shift in,

824
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:25.360
uh,
just human behavior.
I don't know what it is,

825
00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:30.040
but,
um,
cleal relax.
It's fine.
You don't have to eat anybody.

826
00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:34.030
It's a company.
I'm sorry I fucking dogs had it's God damn ears up.

827
00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:36.363
<v 4>MMM.</v>

828
00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.460
<v 1>So whenever I see it,
the key,</v>

829
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:44.320
I always walked by and I always turn it over because on the back that's just

830
00:49:44.321 --> 00:49:48.760
writing of like,
you know,
I guess recommendations that all of a selfie books,

831
00:49:48.761 --> 00:49:51.250
I'll tell you this little really,
I just can't imagine

832
00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.330
anybody has taken enough selfie stead.

833
00:49:55.331 --> 00:49:58.380
It could fill up a fucking book and that you would think that someone would want

834
00:49:58.381 --> 00:50:01.380
to buy it and then somebody does and then you're married to it.

835
00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:08.510
It's just,
it's,
it's,
and my wife had met.
She goes,
I know,

836
00:50:08.511 --> 00:50:12.540
I know.
It's so bad.
It's so bad by can't look away.
I was like,
but there's just,

837
00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:14.570
I think that feeds into their,
you know,

838
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:19.630
wanting to be princesses and pretty and dressing up and getting ideas on how to

839
00:50:19.971 --> 00:50:22.730
fucking,
you know,
show off their tits and a new fucking way.

840
00:50:22.731 --> 00:50:26.320
I have no idea what it is.
But um,

841
00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:30.430
I would say that that is it,
that I'm actually getting depressed now.

842
00:50:30.431 --> 00:50:32.500
I don't if he could hear it,
my voice just talking about it

843
00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:37.410
<v 4>like more trees were cut down.</v>

844
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:43.570
It's like they like a meeting like okay your guys like which one of these is

845
00:50:44.251 --> 00:50:49.200
going to be the cover?
We have to figure out what is worthy of the cover.

846
00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:54.360
Okay.
Which ones?
What is the photo like they had a pic like,

847
00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:55.523
like pace it

848
00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:59.720
<v 1>like,
like which Selfie it goes on the cover,</v>

849
00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:02.630
which is the first one that opens the book,
which is,
you know,

850
00:51:02.631 --> 00:51:04.010
you want to start strong,

851
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:06.103
<v 4>you know,</v>

852
00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:10.180
<v 1>the same way they get your tea.
We had to tell a story with these photos,</v>

853
00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:14.860
like there was fucking human being sitting there thinking about that shit.

854
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:21.470
And then they pitched the idea and somebody said yes,

855
00:51:21.471 --> 00:51:26.420
and then they made it.
And then my wife bought it and it's in my fucking house.

856
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:31.790
And I swear to God
if,
if,

857
00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:38.110
if it wouldn't do like major damage to my relationship,

858
00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:39.820
I would throw it in the fireplace.

859
00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:46.790
I,
and she's had it on the coffee table.

860
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:50.750
She had an underneath the TV and she had downstairs on top of her dresser.

861
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:55.010
And each time I fucking turned it over like it was this built that I didn't want

862
00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:57.040
to deal with it.
And um,

863
00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:01.520
I would say it's that her music taste is un fucking believable

864
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:05.390
and she truly is one of the greatest people I've ever met.

865
00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.900
That's why I fucking married her.
But,
uh,
you know,
we all got our stuff,

866
00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:09.441
you know what I mean?

867
00:52:09.441 --> 00:52:13.050
I sit there and I watch sports and I scream about it and I get mad.
I,

868
00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:17.180
I'm trying to be empathetic and saying that that's just as fucking stupid.

869
00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:19.493
<v 4>MMM.</v>

870
00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:21.850
<v 1>But I don't think it is.</v>

871
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:25.930
I really don't that fucking self help book of Selfies,

872
00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:30.200
not self help.
Whatever the fuck it is was a,

873
00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:34.840
I had to walk that one off a hydro.
Really just be like,
okay,
yeah,

874
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:36.730
we're married and this is,
this is,

875
00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:40.960
I know this isn't doesn't mean anything about her,
but Jesus fucking Christ.

876
00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:45.490
It's more the influence of that that's going to influence somebody.

877
00:52:45.491 --> 00:52:48.810
The white boy,
when I saw great comedians,
I wanted to be a comedian.
There's like,

878
00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:54.490
I dunno,
I guess horrors need to be inspired to write that there.

879
00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:57.310
I want to be the next Kim Kardashian.
I got to take,

880
00:52:57.311 --> 00:52:59.560
start taking fucking self help self.

881
00:52:59.561 --> 00:53:03.850
Why don't keep saying self-help selfies of myself.

882
00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:05.951
You know what?

883
00:53:05.951 --> 00:53:10.060
I'm glad you asked me that because I probably bumped all you guys out,
you know,

884
00:53:10.061 --> 00:53:14.830
depressed you about all the fucking,
uh,
the goddamn a fishing out the oceans.

885
00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:18.430
So it serves me right that you guys asked me a question that makes me feel bad.

886
00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:23.500
Um,
anyways,
getting married.
Finance question.

887
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:28.920
Hey Billy galaxy,
my lady and I are getting married in two weeks.
Good field,

888
00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:33.290
man.
The lover.
That's the greatest fucking move you're ever gonna make.
Um,

889
00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:35.810
I never thought I'd say this.
I actually love being married.

890
00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:39.290
I like going out doing my spots.
I like coming directly home.

891
00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:43.400
I like being in bed by 11.
Just fucking great.

892
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:46.940
Now that I'm not boozing,
like getting up,
I'm losing weight.

893
00:53:46.941 --> 00:53:50.720
I will tell you though.
Oh my God,
I'm only a weekend.

894
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:55.220
I drive by billboards and I just see a frosty fucking mug of beer.
I'm just like,

895
00:53:55.221 --> 00:53:59.960
dude,
I want 50 of those.
I want fucking 50 of those.

896
00:53:59.961 --> 00:54:04.310
I'm one of those guys.
I'm never going to just not drink.
There's no fucking way.

897
00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:08.440
I like it too much.
I'm not addicted to it.

898
00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:09.910
I just fucking love it.

899
00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:15.640
I can't wait for these fucking 72 days to get over so I can fuck my liver up

900
00:54:15.641 --> 00:54:16.474
again.

901
00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:22.620
I fucking love it.
And I,

902
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:26.020
and I am not ashamed to say it.
Oh,

903
00:54:26.021 --> 00:54:28.840
I'm not slapping around my wife.

904
00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:31.210
I'm not screaming at children.

905
00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:36.790
I get shit faced in my own fucking home or I go out and Obama happy drunk,

906
00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:42.900
you know,
I'm happy fucking drunk.
But,
uh,
it's,

907
00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:46.440
it's really helping me to count down the days rather than the go up.
So,

908
00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:51.480
cause to me to sit there and think I'm a day number seven and I'm trying to get

909
00:54:51.521 --> 00:54:56.400
to 72 is fucking brutal.
But if I look at it the other way and say,

910
00:54:56.410 --> 00:55:00.190
hey,
65 more days,
for some reason it's like when I'm on a treadmill,

911
00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:05.350
I'd rather count down from 60 minutes then start at one.
I don't know why.

912
00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:07.480
That's how my brain works.
What are you going to do for me?
So anyway,

913
00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:10.480
we can do for me.
What do you going,
what do you want from me?
I should have said,

914
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:13.630
all right,
my lady and I are getting married two weeks.
All is great.
Very excited.

915
00:55:13.631 --> 00:55:15.370
Yadaa fucking Yada.

916
00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:20.830
We both have good jobs each making about 125 grand a year in Chicago.

917
00:55:20.831 --> 00:55:24.340
You guys are crushing it.
Pay Down your credit cards,

918
00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:30.060
save up your fucking money and buy something that you can live in and kicked the

919
00:55:30.341 --> 00:55:35.110
shit out of the principal.
All right?
Have your money work for you.
You aren't it,

920
00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.450
it should work for you.
My question is,

921
00:55:37.451 --> 00:55:42.280
what advice do you have for us regarding how to share in the finances moving

922
00:55:42.281 --> 00:55:46.540
forward?
Do we keep separate accounts?
One joint account for bills?

923
00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:51.280
Maybe have nia weigh in on this.
Um,
yeah,

924
00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:52.780
I never did the joint account thing.

925
00:55:52.781 --> 00:55:57.190
If you're going to do the joint account thing,
like you're really,

926
00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:58.630
um,

927
00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:05.770
you're really taking a risk there because at any moment,

928
00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:09.310
especially in the Midwest,
you know,

929
00:56:09.311 --> 00:56:12.580
your partner can get addicted to meth.
Okay.

930
00:56:12.581 --> 00:56:16.450
And don't even fucking roll your eyes at me cause I do road gigs and I know

931
00:56:16.451 --> 00:56:20.110
where the meth before and after fucking billboards are.

932
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:24.510
You get out in the Midwest and,
uh,
you know,

933
00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:29.700
you drive through Iowa,
you drive through Wyoming.
I know.
Maybe not in fucking,

934
00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:35.190
I dunno.
I,
I,
I think that I'm a,
I'm a fan of,
um,

935
00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:41.220
separate accounts because a,
I understand money and I don't blow it.

936
00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:46.520
And I invested as wisely as I possibly can except for my drinking habits and,

937
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:51.900
uh,
my hobbies.
But,
uh,
I,
I,
that would be up to you.

938
00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:56.130
It'd be up to my,
uh,
one of my,
one of my relatives got married and uh,

939
00:56:56.490 --> 00:56:59.580
he said that was really freaky at first and then,
then it was cool.

940
00:56:59.850 --> 00:57:00.990
I don't think it's a big deal.

941
00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:04.710
Like I trust my wife to combine accounts and all that type of shit to be honest

942
00:57:04.711 --> 00:57:09.300
with you.
We just have it,
you know what I mean?
Uh,
but that's something that,

943
00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:10.153
uh,

944
00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:11.540
<v 0>okay,</v>

945
00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:13.550
<v 1>that you guys should probably talk about.</v>

946
00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:17.450
But I would say if she's not bringing it up,
I wouldn't bring it up either.

947
00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:20.390
And if she does bring it up,
be like,
yeah,
hey,

948
00:57:20.391 --> 00:57:24.980
why don't we sit down and talk about that and just have a serious conversation

949
00:57:24.981 --> 00:57:28.220
going?
Like,
all right,
this is a tremendous,

950
00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:32.270
tremendous responsibility for me.

951
00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:37.650
I always put it on yourself so the listener will actually listen.
All right?

952
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:40.280
Don't come out and be like,
Hey,
fuck good shit dick.
You know,

953
00:57:40.281 --> 00:57:42.750
I don't want you fucking spending my money.
Don't look at,

954
00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:45.230
don't come coming on now.
Cause they'll shut down and get defensive.

955
00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:49.850
You got to come at him like this.
Just be like,
this is a huge responsibility.

956
00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:52.190
I want you to know this is a huge responsibility from me,

957
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:56.930
which then she'll have to say,
well,
it's a huge responsibility for me to write.

958
00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:01.610
You'll get her to say that you'll have her on tape saying that and just say,

959
00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:04.580
listen,
you know,

960
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:09.140
as much as we're married and we're combining our accounts,

961
00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:13.460
I respect the money that you're bringing into the account and I want you to know

962
00:58:13.461 --> 00:58:14.570
that I would never,

963
00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:16.220
<v 0>okay.</v>

964
00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:21.220
<v 1>Like go out and buy either something sizable or a bunch of knickknacks that</v>

965
00:58:22.641 --> 00:58:27.641
ended up being sizeable chunk out of the fucking account out of respect for how

966
00:58:28.161 --> 00:58:32.990
hard you work.
Okay.
And really sit down and talk about money,

967
00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.150
talk about how you want to win fest it,

968
00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:38.900
learn about money and all that type of shit.
Um,

969
00:58:38.901 --> 00:58:41.900
so you don't end up like one of these people who puts the money in there and you

970
00:58:41.901 --> 00:58:44.880
think everything's fucking fine and then they're there.

971
00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.010
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

972
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:49.100
<v 1>they got a credit card that they're fucking lighten up and then they attach to</v>

973
00:58:49.101 --> 00:58:53.360
your fucking,
I dunno what it's one bank account.
And they go,

974
00:58:53.361 --> 00:58:55.370
well you got the money in there and Sunday your name,

975
00:58:55.371 --> 00:59:00.200
we want our 15 fucking grand in seven,
eight of that grant is yours.

976
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:04.530
And that goes flying out the window because she bought a bunch of blobs and,

977
00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:07.940
and choose and this shit can happen.
All right.

978
00:59:07.941 --> 00:59:11.720
And I'm speaking from the male perspective because I am a guy and that doesn't

979
00:59:11.721 --> 00:59:13.870
make me as sexist.
Okay.
You know,

980
00:59:13.871 --> 00:59:16.190
I've been thinking a lot about these fucking groups by the way,

981
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.490
how it is dope to join a group and why it's doomed for failure.

982
00:59:21.491 --> 00:59:26.050
A lot of times it's because once you join a group that has a cause,

983
00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:30.580
you basically go into this think tank where everybody basically shares the same

984
00:59:30.581 --> 00:59:34.210
point of view.
So you don't have anybody keeping in check on like,

985
00:59:34.211 --> 00:59:36.070
well yeah I don't know about that.
Or Hey,
you know,

986
00:59:36.071 --> 00:59:39.820
you installed them low bed a little bit insulted them.
So it's like,

987
00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:43.750
it becomes like when to conspiracy theories meet each other.

988
00:59:45.010 --> 00:59:49.200
And,
you know,
conspiracy theorist needs somebody to be sitting there going like,

989
00:59:49.201 --> 00:59:52.840
dude,
do you really think are all I dude,
you know,
I was with you until then.

990
00:59:52.841 --> 00:59:56.530
But if two conspiracy theorist meet each other,
they just a dude,

991
00:59:56.531 --> 00:59:59.020
you know what else?
Oh yeah.
You know what I heard?
And they just fucking,

992
00:59:59.021 --> 01:00:00.700
they just go right down the rabbit hole.

993
01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:05.110
And I think a lot of times why when I listened to like a lot of the feminists

994
01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:06.040
complaining,

995
01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:10.360
it strikes me as funny because so much of the shit that they're bitching about,

996
01:00:10.361 --> 01:00:15.160
I relate to.
It's like,
yeah,
that's happened to me.
That is also happened to me.

997
01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:19.930
20% of it.
Yeah,
I'll go with it.
Yeah,
that's fucked up.
You know?

998
01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:22.600
But just know that even if you got on par with guys,

999
01:00:22.601 --> 01:00:27.310
you still staring at an 80% fuck over.
That's the best I can give you.

1000
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.050
Is that sexist?
If it is,
I don't give a fuck.
Um,

1001
01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:37.690
so anyways,
uh,
I can't get over that Ford Galaxy man.

1002
01:00:37.691 --> 01:00:41.020
That is exactly what the fuck I'm looking for.
Here's another great one.

1003
01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:49.010
2,500 bucks.
Now he's two door.
Let's see what we got here.

1004
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:54.390
Oh Geez.
Is a bunch of parts laying around.
This is my shit.
Oh,

1005
01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:59.660
tears.
I'll tell you a little bit rough.
You know.
[inaudible] is too rough.

1006
01:00:59.661 --> 01:01:04.380
God dammit.
What's the engine looking like?
Yeah,

1007
01:01:04.381 --> 01:01:08.100
that's all good shit.
All right,
hang on,
hang on,
hang on,

1008
01:01:08.101 --> 01:01:12.630
let me get a look at the last one.
Jesus Christ.
Andrew,
you crushed it with these.

1009
01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:15.631
Um,
all right,
this is,

1010
01:01:15.631 --> 01:01:18.550
is it really interesting to have you guys looking at car listening to me,

1011
01:01:18.551 --> 01:01:22.780
looking at cars that they can't fucking see.
Uh,

1012
01:01:22.781 --> 01:01:25.990
my is another guy in 1998.
[inaudible] 68,
sorry,

1013
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:29.100
couple years off there.
Um,

1014
01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:34.110
I dunno,
kind of getting into that,
I'm going to stick with the 65 though.

1015
01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.420
65 is bad ass.

1016
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:38.783
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1017
01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:41.830
<v 1>Um,
here I go again.
I'm doing this shit again.
So anyways,</v>

1018
01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.710
that's the podcast for this week.
Once again,

1019
01:01:44.711 --> 01:01:49.240
if you'd like to donate to this podcast and a 10% of the proceeds will go to the

1020
01:01:49.241 --> 01:01:52.930
Saint Jude hospital is a,
anytime you go on Amazon,

1021
01:01:52.931 --> 01:01:54.550
just go to Amazon through my website,

1022
01:01:54.551 --> 01:01:57.160
which is basically built [inaudible] dot com and you click on the merchant page,

1023
01:01:57.161 --> 01:02:00.340
then you click on the Amazon link.
It doesn't cost you any extra money.

1024
01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:04.930
And they just kicked me a little bit of cash for a driving traffic their way.

1025
01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:09.370
Um,
other than that,
that is the podcast for this week.
All right,
everybody,

1026
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:14.080
you got to lose three pounds a week with me over the next eight weeks.
Huh?

1027
01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:18.760
Get on the fucking scale today or is it starts tomorrow?
How about that?

1028
01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:23.310
All right,
we'll start tomorrow because you didn't know it was happening,
right?

1029
01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:27.570
So it starts tomorrow.
Go to the grocery store tonight.
He gets your old meal,

1030
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:31.320
he gets your bananas,
your apple,
your orange,
whatever the fuck you want.

1031
01:02:31.321 --> 01:02:35.890
You get your Turkey slices or whatever fucking meat you want.
Um,

1032
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:38.190
your fucking salads,

1033
01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.690
one giant salad a day and then at night just get that protein.

1034
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.300
Even go vegan every once in a while at night.

1035
01:02:45.301 --> 01:02:47.040
And then do you know what to take a walk around the block?
You,

1036
01:02:47.041 --> 01:02:51.210
you have no idea what that would do.
Hey Nia.
Hey Baby.
Hey,

1037
01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:53.430
really quickly.
Uh,

1038
01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:56.100
somebody wanted you to chime in on one of these fucking questions.

1039
01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:59.580
This is so stupid.
Why would I do,
oh,
it does.
Well,
maybe,

1040
01:02:59.581 --> 01:03:02.460
maybe you can do it next week.
Right here.
Um,

1041
01:03:07.090 --> 01:03:09.020
all right.
I'm not going to ask you a Clia watch out.

1042
01:03:09.021 --> 01:03:13.340
Are you going to shut the fucking recorder off?
All right.

1043
01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:15.900
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1044
01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:18.730
<v 1>All right.
Hey,
people ask me,</v>

1045
01:03:18.731 --> 01:03:22.750
they said they asked,
um,
of knee as music.

1046
01:03:22.751 --> 01:03:27.520
What group or band or John,
right?
Do you have absolutely no ability to swallow?

1047
01:03:27.521 --> 01:03:30.640
And I said none.
I said you had this,
you have great taste in music that you,

1048
01:03:30.641 --> 01:03:33.280
you're actually one of those few people that you can put your phone on shuffle

1049
01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.310
at a party and you're not embarrassed.
However,
sit down.

1050
01:03:36.311 --> 01:03:39.670
Stop trying to divide and conquer.
There you go.
Why?
Oh,

1051
01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.560
there's going to work because the one thing that I,

1052
01:03:41.561 --> 01:03:45.550
the one thing I can't stomach.
And what's that?
The Kim Kardashians Selfie book.

1053
01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:46.420
Like the cover that right?

1054
01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.930
<v 3>Oh yeah.
No I got that book and I have no shame.</v>

1055
01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.540
I've participated in all levels of pop culture.

1056
01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:54.240
So if anybody has something to say,

1057
01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:56.040
<v 1>no I'm saying it.</v>

1058
01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:00.270
Nobody else is saying you are saying I can you do me a favor with that book.

1059
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:05.280
What?
You can lay it out anytime you want.
Just you always turn it over.

1060
01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:09.600
Have the cupboard turned over cause it's okay.
That depresses me.
Why

1061
01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:15.020
I just,
I can't even put it into fucking like if you can,

1062
01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:19.150
<v 3>why?
Cause I just feel like there's this,
now this,
this,
I just hate her.</v>

1063
01:04:19.151 --> 01:04:21.550
I just can't stand her.
I don't hate her.
But like why though?

1064
01:04:21.610 --> 01:04:23.200
Why are people so bothered?

1065
01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:27.880
Cause cause they're like constantly shoved down our throats.
No,

1066
01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:28.763
the fleet

1067
01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:34.370
<v 1>narcissist.
Oh yeah.
And the,
the fact that I,</v>

1068
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:38.060
you know,
the six dead,
whole fucking famous for being famous.

1069
01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:39.800
You don't really do anything.

1070
01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:45.560
You came into your fucking suck the Dick.
You became famous.

1071
01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:49.280
The family got behind it like,
yeah,
my daughter's sucks.

1072
01:04:49.281 --> 01:04:54.020
The Best Dick and fucking Calabasas.
It wasn't quite like that,
but,
okay.

1073
01:04:54.830 --> 01:04:56.720
All right.
How,
okay.

1074
01:04:56.790 --> 01:05:00.680
I am sure they had an honorable way of parlaying that whatever.
What I'm,

1075
01:05:00.681 --> 01:05:04.130
I'm trying not to be judgmental.
God Far.
She sucked a dick.

1076
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:07.100
She got famous and now she's got a selfie book and she's sitting there.
Dude,

1077
01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:08.130
it is just so

1078
01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:10.590
<v 3>like,
so.
I,
when I went to get it,</v>

1079
01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:15.780
I was surprised that it was sold out at this very independent and a hip section

1080
01:05:15.781 --> 01:05:19.650
of La.
It was out.
They were like,
oh,
it's sold out as soon as we got it.

1081
01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:23.880
This has nothing to do with other people.
This has to do with me.
It's about you.

1082
01:05:23.881 --> 01:05:26.580
I'm sorry,
go on.
Just saying,
you're asking me why it depresses me.

1083
01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:31.010
Those fucking people.
When I watch somebody take a selfie rather than just,
I'm,

1084
01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:33.660
look,
I stand from the Hollywood sign,
you click on whatever,

1085
01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:37.260
but when people hold it up over their head and then it turned their head trying

1086
01:05:37.261 --> 01:05:41.370
to fucking look better looking than they are.
And sticking your lips out.

1087
01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:42.970
The duck loves is Babel.

1088
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:46.830
Why wouldn't you try to look as good as possible in a picture that you're taking

1089
01:05:46.831 --> 01:05:47.664
of yourself?

1090
01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:51.330
That's what's so great about the Selfie is that you can really see what angle

1091
01:05:51.331 --> 01:05:55.200
looks best and with the lighting is,
I think it's,
it's,
it makes a lot of sense.

1092
01:05:56.070 --> 01:05:57.320
Logically to me it's,

1093
01:05:57.390 --> 01:06:01.170
it makes perfect sense to adjust yourself before you just take a picture.

1094
01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:05.160
Does this like that?
No.
I want to make sure that I'm looking right.

1095
01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:09.540
That's the whole point.
Why are you,
why do you look confused?

1096
01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:10.950
You know what?

1097
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:15.270
I am old enough to know that I'm not going to convince you otherwise,

1098
01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:20.640
so God bless you and the Selfie me if you can,
can you,

1099
01:06:20.641 --> 01:06:22.740
can we have a compromise?
You just turn the book over.

1100
01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:26.610
I will just keep it somewhere where it's not in your line of vision.

1101
01:06:26.611 --> 01:06:29.300
Since you're so offended by it.
I'm not offended by it.
It just,

1102
01:06:29.301 --> 01:06:33.350
it depresses me to look at it.
Well,
I don't want to depress you.
I'm,

1103
01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:37.550
how would I be condescending?
Just,
okay,
go on.
Just just get out of here.
I won't,

1104
01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:40.860
I'll keep it out of your sight.
I'll keep it out of your side.
Okay.

1105
01:06:41.550 --> 01:06:44.060
Are you writing that down right now?
No ma'am.

1106
01:06:46.890 --> 01:06:51.530
Do you want to tell the the caffeinated not the caffeinated story?
I would.

1107
01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.100
Can we save that for a

1108
01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.820
<v 1>checking in on you?
Yes.</v>

1109
01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:57.370
Cause I gotta go get out of here because I can wrap this up.

1110
01:06:57.890 --> 01:07:01.640
Internet sucks here and this will take me four hours to fucking upload.
Um,

1111
01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:04.450
all right,
that's the podcast for this week.
On Thursday.

1112
01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:06.840
I will tell you guys the story of

1113
01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.050
<v 2>the,
uh,</v>

1114
01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:13.910
<v 1>decaffeinated not to caffeinated.
Uh,
you know,
I fucked up.</v>

1115
01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:17.550
I fucked up getting this tea with my wife and she's did,

1116
01:07:17.551 --> 01:07:20.610
she tried to say I wasn't listening and I actually was listening,
but

1117
01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:22.093
<v 2>I thought</v>

1118
01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.030
<v 1>to caffeinated,
not to caffeinated.</v>

1119
01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.770
I thought that that's what the two flavors were.

1120
01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:28.483
<v 2>MMM.</v>

1121
01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:32.440
<v 1>Well,
it's a long fucking story.
All right.
That was confusing.</v>

1122
01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:37.190
That's the podcast for this week.
Go fuck yourselves.
And a God bless all of you.

1123
01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:40.090
Go take some selfies.
You know,
put out your fucking,

1124
01:07:40.091 --> 01:07:43.390
then you do the little peace sign too.
Like whatever that's for,

1125
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.050
<v 2>you know,
like you're out,
even though you're not in my life.</v>

1126
01:07:48.830 --> 01:07:49.663
Um,

1127
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:53.160
<v 1>um,
I know I'm just a crabby old man.
I'll go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you.</v>

1128
01:07:53.161 --> 01:07:54.210
I'll check in on you.
