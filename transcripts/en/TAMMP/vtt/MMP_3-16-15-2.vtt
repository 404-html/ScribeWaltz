1
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.513
Okay.

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.780
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:02.781 --> 00:00:07.700
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,
March.
Um,

4
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.710
what does it March 16th match match 68th,

5
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.150
2015.
How's it going?
I'm kind of under the gun here.

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.090
I am,
uh,
trying to do this podcast as quickly as I can.

7
00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:23.510
I have a weird travel week where,
uh,

8
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.190
right now it's Sunday night and um,
our Sunday afternoon and,
uh,

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.200
I'm doing my final two shows at the punchline in Atlanta ever.

10
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.740
Um,
so one of my favorite standup comedy clubs,
um,
that I ever got to work at.

11
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:44.020
I absolutely love this place.
I started talking about it last week,
but um,

12
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.990
<v 0>okay.</v>

13
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.720
<v 1>Basically,
I don't know what happened.
They lost their lease.</v>

14
00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:50.390
I guess they're redoing the building or some shit like that.

15
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:51.650
So now they have to move it.

16
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.790
It's literally a standup comedy museum and uh,

17
00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:59.000
they were nice enough to ask me if I wanted to do one more night and that's what

18
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:03.160
I'm doing.
And as you can hear my voice as much better.

19
00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:06.040
It's a little fucked up,
but I'm doing much better.

20
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.080
And a old Billy freckles.
All Billy freckles is back in the gym.

21
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.760
Um,
I'll talk about that in a second,
but I do have to hype something.

22
00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:20.560
I have a movie coming out this week.
Sorry.
Few more cops here.
Um,

23
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:24.340
a movie that a buddy of mine,
Jordan Ruben directed called Xom beavers.

24
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.910
That's right.
Zombie beavers.
You know,

25
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.660
one of the bucket list things you have to check off as an actor.

26
00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:35.050
At some point you gotta be in a movie about zombies.
I mean,

27
00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:36.370
that's just my own opinion.
I mean,

28
00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:38.710
I am just a comedian who tries to act every once in a while,

29
00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:41.170
but as far as I'm concerned,
you know,

30
00:01:41.171 --> 00:01:44.260
there's a few bucket lists scenes you have to do,
right?

31
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.020
You got to get interrogated at some point,

32
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.420
get punched in the face and act like you,

33
00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:53.200
you would actually wouldn't tell the people shit.
Right?
You got to do that scene.

34
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.470
You got to do the scene where you get chased down the alley and you throw the

35
00:01:56.471 --> 00:02:00.340
trash can down and the cop leaves over it and you get to the chain link fence.

36
00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:03.720
He's dark,
right?
As you're halfway up,
they grab you and they pull you back down.

37
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.140
You've got to do that one.
Um,
you got to get shot and killed,

38
00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:09.160
which I did.

39
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.210
I got shot and killed in a standup guys got killed by Al Pachino.
Huh?

40
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.520
It doesn't get any better than that.
So once you've checked those off,

41
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.830
there's only one thing left to do.
You got to do a fucking Zombie movie.

42
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.740
You have to do a Zombie movie.
I,
as far as I'm concerned,

43
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.540
all these fucking English conch who go over there and you know what an Oxford,

44
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:34.460
wherever the fuck they go to learn how to act,

45
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.820
then they come over here and they can do an accent like they're from Rhode

46
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.110
Island and everybody gets all blown away.
Fuck all those guys,
unless an women,

47
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.050
unless they did a Zombie movie.
So anyways,
a buddy of mine,
Jordan Rubin,
um,

48
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.730
that's making this movie,
it's about Zombie beavers,

49
00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:54.080
beavers that turned into zombies.
Oh,
he's turning the genre right on its ear.

50
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.910
Obviously the movie is making fun of Zombie movies and it's,

51
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.620
it's well aware how ridiculous Zombie beaver movies are.

52
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.080
Beavers that are zombies,
I should say.
So please spare me the,
uh,
dude.

53
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.590
How much money did you need that you took a part in this fucking,

54
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.510
it's a fun ass fucking movie.
Um,

55
00:03:14.511 --> 00:03:19.100
I got to do one scene in it with a buddy of mine.
Um,
and uh,

56
00:03:19.101 --> 00:03:23.420
you probably won't recognize him cause he's got on a wig and a mustache and a

57
00:03:23.421 --> 00:03:27.770
without giving away too much.
I think work without us.
The movie doesn't work.

58
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.250
Okay.
And that might sound arrogant,
but if you watched the storyline,

59
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.540
it doesn't work.
So it comes out March 18th.
You know,
go eat a pot cookie.

60
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.940
Go down there,
go check out Zam Beavers,
uh,
um,
directed by a good friend of mine,

61
00:03:40.941 --> 00:03:45.170
Jordan Rubin,
who I actually,
uh,
when I first came down in New York City,

62
00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:50.120
I used to do open mikes and work at the Boston comedy club and all that shit way

63
00:03:50.121 --> 00:03:51.440
back in the day.
Me and him,
you know,

64
00:03:51.441 --> 00:03:55.160
he used to perform in front of like fucking eight people around midnight or

65
00:03:55.161 --> 00:03:59.390
whatever.
So,
um,
you know,
it's great to see him move up the ranks.

66
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.330
He's now directing movies and shit like that.
And he said,

67
00:04:02.331 --> 00:04:05.000
I got this over the top crazy fucking movie.
Uh,

68
00:04:05.001 --> 00:04:07.330
you got to come down and have a fun,
it's a one day thing and,

69
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.430
and I'm not gonna lie to you,
dude,
I had a great time.
So check it out.

70
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.541
Have a good time,

71
00:04:11.541 --> 00:04:15.110
but please don't fucking text me like I thought this movie was saving private

72
00:04:15.111 --> 00:04:17.960
Ryan.
Okay,
I understand what it is.
Alright,

73
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.990
so spare me your fucking shaking my head tweets and you know your whole,

74
00:04:23.721 --> 00:04:27.320
I have the world figured out.
Fucking horseshit.
All right.

75
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.610
Just have a good time with it is what it is.
You know what I mean?

76
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.560
Um,
you know,
I was reading,
actually written an article,
uh,

77
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.200
on the way out here that somebody sent to me where Patton Oswald was getting

78
00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:46.481
interviewed in some magazine that I guess he's had issues with and um,

79
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.560
I almost fucking ate the magazine.
It was so fucking frustrating.

80
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.650
Listen to him trying to convey to the person writing it like it's just this,

81
00:04:57.141 --> 00:05:00.260
this fucking judging of standup.
Like,
well,

82
00:05:00.261 --> 00:05:03.500
don't we have to write to say our opinion about the joke?

83
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.140
Like you're not a fucking comedian,
comedian,

84
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.190
this fucking thing where it's like these selfish assholes just sit in a crowd

85
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.750
and listened to an hour's worth of standup where everything under the sun is

86
00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:22.350
getting trashed and they're laughing along with it and having a great time and

87
00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:25.830
then all of a sudden one joke they don't like and they're like,
wait a minute,

88
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.480
is he,
is he serious now?
Does she really mean that?

89
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.820
It just like that whole philosophy,

90
00:05:32.821 --> 00:05:35.520
like if you do like a rape joke or something like that,

91
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.870
like that's somehow going to make somebody who wouldn't have raped somebody then

92
00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:43.980
go out and rape somebody.
You know what I mean?
I grew up watching Richard Pryor.

93
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.630
I never freebased.
I never shot a car and made the engine block came out.

94
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.720
I didn't have the cops come to my house all day.

95
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.110
I never lit myself on fire,
none of that.

96
00:05:55.111 --> 00:05:58.540
I never went to illegal crap games.
You know,

97
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.270
I never even been to a whorehouse

98
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.810
<v 0>okay,</v>

99
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.090
<v 1>hey,
I pick up my hookers on the street.
Okay.
Um,
you know what I mean?</v>

100
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.230
Just this fucking,

101
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.720
this stupid ass outrage about nothing.
And meanwhile,

102
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.000
meanwhile you've got a group of people in this country,

103
00:06:15.001 --> 00:06:18.090
a small group of people in this country that literally turned the food supply in

104
00:06:18.091 --> 00:06:18.924
the poison,

105
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.970
which to me is the biggest terrorist act against this country that I can think

106
00:06:23.971 --> 00:06:27.690
of every day we're eating the shit that's going to give us fucking cancer,

107
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.390
everybody,
you know what I mean?

108
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.960
And these fucking jerk offs or are breaking people's balls who are out there

109
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.470
now.
Please don't die.
Please don't die.
Is this thing that I,
and I'm me here.

110
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.750
Hang on,
hang on.
Is this the headphones?
Is it,
oh,
it's the headphones.
I'll fuck.

111
00:06:46.751 --> 00:06:49.420
I thought my battery's dying.
That's fucking hilarious.

112
00:06:49.421 --> 00:06:53.950
Right in the middle of making a great point.
So these guys are too busy,
you know,

113
00:06:53.951 --> 00:06:58.600
rather than dealing with like real problems are sitting there breaking comics

114
00:06:58.601 --> 00:07:03.601
balls that are on open mics fucking around fucking around.

115
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.000
Ah,
Jesus.
It,
it drives me up the fucking wall.

116
00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:09.540
So I was reading it because I have tremendous amount of respect for pat and it

117
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:10.990
fucking,
you know,

118
00:07:10.991 --> 00:07:14.380
he's one of the best in the business and listening to this fucking person going

119
00:07:14.381 --> 00:07:18.670
like,
well,
what about this?
The fact that a comedian has to debate,

120
00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:22.930
stand up comedian on an eyeball to eyeball level with someone who isn't a

121
00:07:22.931 --> 00:07:26.740
standup comic and they literally think that the points that they're making are

122
00:07:26.741 --> 00:07:30.910
just as legitimate as the comedians is one of the most fucking arrogant things.

123
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.550
Like,
look,
I know a little bit about cars,

124
00:07:33.551 --> 00:07:38.050
but I wouldn't sit there debating what's a better design with a fucking
mechanic.

125
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.860
I guess mechanics don't design them.
They fix up whoever the fuck fixes and,

126
00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.120
but right there,
that's my argument.

127
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.080
I don't know enough about cars to go eyeball to eyeball with somebody.

128
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.540
Jesus fucking Christ.

129
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.200
What kills me is the bullshit that they're talking about now in comedy clubs.

130
00:07:55.721 --> 00:08:00.721
It has been going on for 40 fucking years in comedy clubs and nothing bad ever

131
00:08:01.211 --> 00:08:02.044
happened.

132
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.000
But now there's social media and everybody has a fucking camera in a goddamn

133
00:08:07.001 --> 00:08:08.680
opinion and now there's this,

134
00:08:08.681 --> 00:08:13.180
this running around like the fucking sky is falling because you didn't like the

135
00:08:13.181 --> 00:08:17.440
answer to knock knock who's there.
It's fucking unbelievable.

136
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:21.990
These fucking
like,
I don't know who that person is,

137
00:08:21.991 --> 00:08:26.991
but the level of jerk off that they are arrogant fucking ass that they think

138
00:08:27.091 --> 00:08:32.091
that they can just sit there and and like they have this valid point on set up

139
00:08:33.181 --> 00:08:37.320
and punch lines with a standup comedian.
Jesus fucking Christ.

140
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.270
I will never understand it.

141
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.040
I will never understand people that actually go to a comedy club and get

142
00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:48.150
offended.
I just,
I don't understand it and if you get offended,
that's tough shit.

143
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:53.250
Okay.
You went out to a comedy club.
All right.

144
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.200
That's too fucking bad.

145
00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:56.640
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

146
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.520
<v 1>that's on you.
All right.
I'm going to say this the last time.</v>

147
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.040
If you fucking want to have a leg to stand on,

148
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:07.100
hire a comedian for your own private party and tell the person the parameters to

149
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:10.140
perform within.
All right?
Other than that,

150
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:15.030
you don't have a leg to stand on and these fucking conch on these stupid ass

151
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:20.031
websites who watch a clip of somebody performing in the comedy club and they get

152
00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:21.450
mad at the comic.

153
00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:26.220
The comic is guilty of nothing other than trying out material in a comedy club.

154
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.000
If you want to get upset,
get upset with the person who videotaped it,

155
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.140
who was told not to,

156
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.880
and they're the ones that uploaded it and brought it into your fucking eggshell

157
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.900
fucking world.
All right?
Jesus fucking Christ,

158
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.770
but patent.
What about this?
I've never done standup.

159
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:48.310
Is this a valid fucking point?
Jesus Christ.

160
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.800
This is fucking the arrogance of that.
The fucking arrogance of it.

161
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.800
Unbelievable.
Anyways,
we'll all shit new crowd.
Don't I have a row?

162
00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.750
Everybody's so fucking special now.

163
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.930
Everybody's feelings is so fucking God damn special.

164
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.530
Grow a Dick.
Okay,

165
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.140
let it will slide off your fucking back for Christ's sake and fucking move onto

166
00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.840
the next joke.
You bunch of babies.
What a bunch of fucking,

167
00:10:14.841 --> 00:10:18.290
I've never had such a fucking pussy time to be living in yet.

168
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:22.040
Some of the most psycho gangster shit is going down and nobody's fucking

169
00:10:22.041 --> 00:10:25.430
focusing on it.
How they got gradually,
they're actually talking about climate.

170
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.823
You know that,

171
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.980
that that could be the number one threat against Americans is Miami is starting

172
00:10:30.981 --> 00:10:34.760
to slip into the fucking ocean and they're breaking somebody's fucking balls.

173
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.310
A bottle relationship joke that they told in a strip mall in a fucking funny

174
00:10:40.311 --> 00:10:44.450
bump that's getting more goddamn attention.
Anyways.
All right,

175
00:10:44.451 --> 00:10:48.380
I'm off my fucking soapbox.
Sorry.
So anyways,
let's plow ahead here.
Uh,

176
00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:51.860
this is one of my favorite times a year as far as,
uh,
this is when I,

177
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.260
I watch hoop.
I don't watch pro hoop.

178
00:10:54.261 --> 00:10:58.190
I watched college hoop and I don't get into the whole fucking march madness,

179
00:10:58.191 --> 00:11:00.020
the big dance.
I liked the regionals,

180
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.550
the big 10 championship and watching right now where Wisconsin was down by 11,

181
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.500
their biggest deficits of the season right now,
they got a tied up 67 up.

182
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.740
You're probably asking yourself,
well,
who your forehead bill?

183
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.610
I'm actually for Wisconsin.
I have some friends that went to,

184
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:21.920
to university in Michigan.
So,
uh,
I think Michigan state's more of an arch rival

185
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.390
<v 2>and uh,
I dunno,</v>

186
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.570
<v 1>I'm kind of partial to all those fucking states.
So,</v>

187
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:29.580
<v 2>uh,</v>

188
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.040
<v 1>I like all those states that everybody basically shits on.</v>

189
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.360
I gotta be honest with you or the sections of the country,
the flyover states,

190
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.940
the south,
you know,

191
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.600
those are some of those myths states in the Pacific northwest.

192
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:48.000
I fucking love all those places.
Um,
and I plan,
you don't want to,
I want to do,

193
00:11:48.001 --> 00:11:52.920
I got this southern bus tour coming up,
which I'm so ridiculously excited.

194
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:58.230
I can't fucking wait to get on the bus with law head coach and a Versie and,

195
00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:02.920
uh,
just go to,
you know,
a bunch of cities.
I never,

196
00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:04.960
I've never been to Knoxville,

197
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:09.340
Tennessee and it's going to kill me that there's not a fucking football game

198
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:11.250
going on.
Um,

199
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:16.660
but I blew through Memphis one time really quickly.
I'd never been to Shreveport.

200
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.450
I never,
I've never even done standup in Mississippi.
So,
uh,

201
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.490
to be 23 years into the business and to be excited about coming out to all these

202
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:28.150
new places,
I can't fucking wait.
I got this killer poster that,
uh,

203
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.290
that I'm going to be a whore myself out,
you know,

204
00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:36.790
selling it at the end of every show,
I'm going to autograph all of them.
And,
um,

205
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.430
I can't wait and I'm thinking about doing another bus tour later on this year

206
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:47.200
where I go through,
uh,
like,
you know,
Kansas,
Nebraska,

207
00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.840
Wyoming is the last state I need to performance.

208
00:12:49.841 --> 00:12:54.160
So I got to do a gig out that way.
Go through Montana,
the Dakotas,

209
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.480
um,
dad,
whole fucking part of the,
uh,
the country.

210
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:03.490
Um,
I dunno.
Good people,
good food.
I like it.

211
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.010
You know what I mean?
And I know whatever,

212
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.770
some of the dumb shit that people on the coasts give people shit about in the,

213
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.820
in the middle of the country.
Like,

214
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.330
cause they know what's going on more in the fashion world

215
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:21.760
or different kinds of music or,
or fucking whatever.
And like,
meanwhile,

216
00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:25.990
like the middle of the country,
it's like our food supply,
you know,

217
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.310
out of these fucking headphones are driving me fucking nuts.
Come on,
man.
Um,

218
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.810
or like,
uh,
you know,

219
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.220
you know all these morons who don't know who the F I don't know,

220
00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:39.220
whatever you consider,
uh,
you know,
they don't know where to get good Sushi,

221
00:13:39.221 --> 00:13:43.090
but they can fucking take apart a car and put it back together better than when

222
00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:45.640
it came from the factory.
I mean,
there's a lot of fucking cool shit out there,

223
00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:50.400
I think.
Anyway,
so I'm beyond excited for that.
Uh,

224
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:54.340
the first week,
uh,
the end of the tour,
we,
uh,

225
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.400
we ended up in New Orleans and we spend an extra day in New Orleans,

226
00:13:57.401 --> 00:14:01.600
which is going to be the shit.
And then the last,
uh,
the last night of the tour,

227
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.130
we're going to be at the Kentucky Derby.

228
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.130
So that's about as good as it fucking gets.
So,
um,

229
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.770
tickets are on sale for all dates right now.

230
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.950
Go to [inaudible] dot com um,

231
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.920
pick up a pair and a we'll come down and we'll give you,

232
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.810
we'll give you a fucking money's worth.
So anyways,

233
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.840
I mentioned it'll Billy freckles was back in the gym and um,

234
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.650
you know,
I don't know the holidays and then I did that,

235
00:14:25.651 --> 00:14:30.040
that fucking trip through uh,
you know,
Australia,
New Zealand,

236
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.000
New Zealand and Southeast Asia.
A combination of that,

237
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.780
the Rose Bowl and all that,
uh,
it became a belly fat again.

238
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.890
I got up to like a buck 84,
so fucking pissed at myself,
man.

239
00:14:41.891 --> 00:14:44.890
I was down to my fighting weight when 68 to [inaudible] 72.

240
00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:49.060
So this time I've decided not only to get myself back in shape,

241
00:14:49.061 --> 00:14:52.120
I'm going to say what,
wait,
I'm going to be,
you know,

242
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.910
even though I'm not going to fucking do some dumb shit and stand on the scale

243
00:14:54.911 --> 00:14:57.800
and show it to you guys.
But just the mere fact that I'm going to be,
um,

244
00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:02.110
was this way too fucking quiet.
I'm such a dumb cunt when it comes to this shit.

245
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.020
Um,
just to,
um,

246
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:07.843
<v 2>mmm.</v>

247
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.310
<v 1>Just so I'll fucking stick with it.</v>

248
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:15.140
I keep trying to get down to the last time I had a flat fucking stomach and I

249
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:17.570
had abs.
I was a buck 62.

250
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:22.160
The closest I've ever gotten was one 67,
but even then,

251
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:26.180
even then,
I don't know how to do it right.
I still had like the belly,

252
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:26.661
you know what I mean?

253
00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:29.540
Cause you start dieting and you actually end up losing muscle and that type of

254
00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:29.811
shit.

255
00:15:29.811 --> 00:15:34.490
But I'm going to try to figure out how to do it without going to GNC and getting

256
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:38.130
that awful fucking cancerous shit.
Whatever the fuck that's,

257
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:42.410
there's no fucking way that stuff is good for you.
That science,

258
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:46.550
that powdered shit that the FDA doesn't even have to look at to see if it's bad

259
00:15:46.551 --> 00:15:50.120
for you.
Um,
someone was telling me all of that shit though.

260
00:15:50.121 --> 00:15:54.770
Those milks that are supposed to build muscle so I don't get in trouble.
Um,

261
00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:00.000
yeah,
that they have like metals in them.
I Dunno,

262
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:03.180
there's other shit have metals in it.
I have no fucking idea.
I don't know.

263
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.410
I'm drinking a bottle of water here.

264
00:16:04.411 --> 00:16:07.680
This was probably bottled like fucking 10 years ago.

265
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.690
Sat in a fucking warehouse.
God knows what the Hell is in my system now.

266
00:16:12.691 --> 00:16:16.270
But anyways,
just for the pure vanity,
uh,

267
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.520
of it,
I want to see if I can get back down there.
So,
uh,

268
00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.510
I've been hitting the fucking elliptical and a,
I was doing good man.

269
00:16:24.511 --> 00:16:29.250
I got down to like a buck 78,
but I fucked up last night cause I'm,

270
00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:34.700
I made homemade Ravioli first time I ever try doing that.

271
00:16:34.701 --> 00:16:35.990
And I watched this video

272
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.240
that these people put up of their right off the boat,

273
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.500
Italian grandmother.
And uh,
if you guys have listened as podcast,

274
00:16:45.501 --> 00:16:50.000
if you knew the podcast,
I fucking love Italians.
I love their country.

275
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:54.920
I love their food.
I like their cars.
I like the flashy shit that they're into.

276
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:59.990
You know what I mean?
Um,
versus he,
oh,
he says I'm a closet fucking Italian,

277
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:03.110
so it's not enough for me to go to Italy and eat the guide them food.

278
00:17:03.111 --> 00:17:08.000
I got to figure out how to at least make an attempt at making it.
So,
um,

279
00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:09.310
<v 2>okay.</v>

280
00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.430
<v 1>You know,
I actually,
you know,
I've got some semolina right.</v>

281
00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:16.270
And I fucking did the whole welfare to eggs per pound.

282
00:17:16.271 --> 00:17:20.880
I made a pound of this shit.
And um,
my fucking the,

283
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.950
the actual pasta part of it,
the uh,

284
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.880
<v 2>yeah,</v>

285
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.910
<v 1>the fucking,
um,
the Ravioli park came out great.</v>

286
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:31.390
The filling I had to wing because they didn't really say what the recipe was,

287
00:17:31.391 --> 00:17:34.480
so I kind of eyeballed it and I also forgot to add an egg to it,
so,
uh,

288
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.130
it tasted a little weird.

289
00:17:36.131 --> 00:17:39.520
It was a little too sweet and some sugar and a little bit of cinnamon in it with

290
00:17:39.521 --> 00:17:43.000
some ricotta cheese.
And right there you're like,
wow,
that's fucking a weird,

291
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.480
<v 2>okay</v>

292
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.700
<v 1>group of flavors there.
You gotta make sure everything's right.</v>

293
00:17:46.701 --> 00:17:48.650
And I tried to eyeball it.
So,
um,

294
00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:53.570
but my big fucking thing is the Ravioli thing that I have.

295
00:17:53.571 --> 00:17:57.950
I have like a tray while your weight lay one sheet down and then you put the

296
00:17:57.951 --> 00:18:01.220
filling in it in each one of the things and then you lay another one,

297
00:18:01.221 --> 00:18:04.430
you do an egg wash and lay another one on top and then you got this roller
thing.

298
00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:08.690
Don't get those,
those things fucking suck.
Just get the stamp.

299
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.120
Because even after all that bullshit,

300
00:18:11.121 --> 00:18:15.350
this is the second time I tried to make it like 30% of them exploded.

301
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.470
And all the filling came out anyways when I was,
uh,

302
00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:23.540
when I was in the midst of a trying to cook the fucking things.
But um,

303
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.380
I dunno,
that's three hours of my life.
I'll never get back.

304
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.970
But I figure each time I do it,
I'll get a little bit better.
Um,

305
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.710
so whatever.
What else am I doing here?
I'm sorry guys,

306
00:18:36.711 --> 00:18:38.120
this is all over the fucking map.

307
00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.990
I literally just landed and I got to do a show here that picking me up in a

308
00:18:41.991 --> 00:18:46.910
fucking an hour.
So I'm going to wrap this thing up and put on my,
my,
uh,

309
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.420
my stage makeup before I get on a,
I get on stage.

310
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:53.570
I don't even know if they've even sent me to fucking advertising if I got

311
00:18:53.571 --> 00:18:58.430
anything.
Meanwhile,
as I'm looking this up,
how about those fucking Bruins?
Huh?

312
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.330
What do you think about them?
Um,

313
00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:08.030
those mother fuckers were playing mediocre all goddamn year.

314
00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.980
And then finally,
I don't know what's happened.

315
00:19:09.981 --> 00:19:12.440
Like they had a nice little run there right before the all star break.

316
00:19:12.441 --> 00:19:16.940
And then all of a sudden,
uh,
you know,
they went right back to,
you know,

317
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.600
when to lose to win one,
lose three,

318
00:19:20.601 --> 00:19:25.280
when to lose one that bullshit.
And an al of a sudden they're playing,

319
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.630
playing for their playoff lives.
Uh,
beat the penguins.

320
00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.090
Who did I see a beat recently?
I've been all over the map.

321
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.330
I know they'd be Detroit,
they'd be Philly.
They beat the penguins.

322
00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.500
They be Tampa Bay there on a nice little run here.

323
00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:40.743
<v 2>MMM.</v>

324
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.790
<v 1>You know,
it'd be nice if we could,
uh,</v>

325
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.150
and we got swept by the Canadians this year,
but it's just,
uh,
you know,

326
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.900
it's just regular season.
You get into the playoffs,
anything can fucking happen.

327
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.340
And,
uh,
I still think the a Stanley Cup winner is going to come out of the west,

328
00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:00.290
which means once again,
the Montreal Canadians will go home cop lists,

329
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.370
which really makes me fucking happy.
I,
you know,

330
00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:08.180
what I get so excited about is that when they sweep us in the regular season,

331
00:20:08.181 --> 00:20:11.150
I get,
I get text messages from Montreal Canadien fans.

332
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.750
Like they're legitimately excited that they swept the Bruins.
I mean,

333
00:20:14.751 --> 00:20:17.750
it's a fucking compliment.
Back in the day,
they didn't give a fuck.

334
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.940
They didn't win a cup.
It was a failure.

335
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:24.530
Now they're celebrating shit that they did in March.
I just love,

336
00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.710
I just love that now there's that.
There's actually 30 fucking teams,

337
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:31.203
you know what I mean?

338
00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:32.360
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

339
00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.090
<v 1>All that fucking bullshit goes out the goddamn window.
You know,</v>

340
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.510
when you competing with five other fucking teams and you and you get first

341
00:20:38.511 --> 00:20:43.511
chance to sign anybody within a 200 mile radius of your goddamn city and you

342
00:20:43.671 --> 00:20:46.820
live in Montreal.
Yeah,
it's a bit of an advantage.
I'd say.

343
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.260
I'm going to go out on a limb and say,

344
00:20:48.261 --> 00:20:50.120
you're going to go on a little bit of a run there.

345
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:57.610
Fucking Bruins.
We had first dibs on the best player from Vermont

346
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:06.000
telling you they got this kid down there and in fucking a Woonsocket,

347
00:21:06.001 --> 00:21:09.740
Rhode Island.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

348
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.460
plowing ahead here.
I might have to stop this fucking podcast.

349
00:21:13.461 --> 00:21:17.660
I haven't got any of my information here and we want inflammation,

350
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:22.820
inflammation,
Hawaii,
the new number two.
Who's number one?
Oh,
by the way,

351
00:21:22.821 --> 00:21:26.840
if you don't want to ruin that,
um,
that Shit I was imitating last week,

352
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:31.850
um,
about that rich guy,
that guy,
I never knowingly lied.

353
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:33.583
I never,

354
00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.850
I'd never purposely knowingly lied.

355
00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:43.160
Um,
there's some news about him in the,
uh,

356
00:21:43.161 --> 00:21:46.560
in the papers.
Just please do not look at it,
uh,

357
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.110
if you're watching that series because a,
it kind of ruins the series.
Um,

358
00:21:51.111 --> 00:21:55.370
one way or the other because it's basically you're trying to guess whether or

359
00:21:55.371 --> 00:21:58.430
not this guy will ever get,
uh,

360
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.610
I dunno.
Brought to justice.
Um,

361
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:08.520
so there's some information there that,
that I shouldn't have said that shit.

362
00:22:08.521 --> 00:22:10.830
Now people are going to look it up and just fucking tweeted anyways.

363
00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.440
It's such cons.
Where the fuck is my God,

364
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:18.230
this is the time when I usually do the advertising.
Why?
Then you say,

365
00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:21.650
oh,
I might have to do this as segments.
You know what,

366
00:22:21.651 --> 00:22:24.740
I'm just gonna act like I'm going to,
I'll just say them doing advertising.

367
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:26.180
I'll edit it in later.
Okay.

368
00:22:26.181 --> 00:22:31.181
We will be right back with the Monday Barney podcasts after these messages.

369
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.530
Alrighty.
And we are back.

370
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:41.570
Wasn't that a great read that I did in the future and the fucking few CIF.

371
00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:43.610
<v 0>Okay.</v>

372
00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:44.510
<v 1>I woke up this morning,</v>

373
00:22:44.511 --> 00:22:49.040
but I do buy their boob and a last night I had a 7:45 AM flight.
Right.

374
00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:54.890
So my wife's 3.0 for Wisconsin there are 75,

375
00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.220
69 with two minutes ago.
So I woke up last night.

376
00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.710
I told my wife that I had the 7:45 AM flight.
She goes,
you know what,

377
00:23:01.711 --> 00:23:04.320
I'll give you the ride to the airport.
Oh,
all right,
you're a sweetheart.

378
00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:09.570
And then she mentioned that there was the La Marathon.
And uh,

379
00:23:09.571 --> 00:23:12.060
I was like,
well,
we'll get up early,
we'll be fine,
but blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

380
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:15.510
So we go,
we wake up in the morning and uh,

381
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:20.970
we start driving down the street in every fucking street is blocked off.
So,

382
00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:22.043
um,

383
00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:27.510
I ended up jumping on the highway just cruising down to the lax and,

384
00:23:27.511 --> 00:23:30.280
and she kept bitching about the traffic she was gonna run into and I was going

385
00:23:30.281 --> 00:23:32.700
to look at the other side of the fucking highway.
There's nothing here.

386
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.350
Stop being such a pussy.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

387
00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:41.500
My life is it perfectly comfortable.
You know,
women are right this second,

388
00:23:41.501 --> 00:23:46.160
the fucking AC is one degree too fucking cold or it's too hot.

389
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.310
They just start bitching.
You know what I mean?

390
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:54.680
And for some reason we don't just go ass to shut up.
You don't,

391
00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:57.920
I don't know why we don't do that.
Why we don't do it more often.

392
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.600
They're just fucking addicted to fucking complaining.
So she's bitch,

393
00:24:02.601 --> 00:24:04.450
Moan and complain and rang,
Rah,
Rah,

394
00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.880
all this fucking crap about the goddamn traffic.
Meanwhile,

395
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.860
if she had a 7:45 AM flight,

396
00:24:09.861 --> 00:24:14.110
I would have fucking driven and then I wouldn't have given a fuck
the,
granted.

397
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.170
I'm a morning person.
She said to me,
she goes,
how the fuck are you this awake?

398
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.020
She's one of those people that hates getting up in the morning.
She's like,

399
00:24:21.021 --> 00:24:24.050
I don't fuck,
are you this awake?
And it's like,
well,
you know,

400
00:24:24.051 --> 00:24:28.670
I had a paper route from the time I was in third grade.
I had a paper road.

401
00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:32.210
I never knowingly lied about sleeping in.

402
00:24:32.211 --> 00:24:35.780
I had a paper route from third grade until freshman year of high school.

403
00:24:35.781 --> 00:24:39.860
I kept that paper route until freshman year of high school to where it was like

404
00:24:39.861 --> 00:24:43.850
weird.
Like I was coming up,
like my voice had changed and shit.

405
00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:48.110
I was still delivering newspapers because it was considered a little kid job

406
00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.110
before the banker is completely fucked over.

407
00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:54.410
Everybody has everybody upside down on a house and now it's like actually in

408
00:24:54.411 --> 00:24:58.460
adult second job delivering newspapers and um,

409
00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:04.670
I kept the job cause I liked having money.
Like my whole life I had money.

410
00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:08.690
Like if you had a paper route right in the third grade,

411
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.960
like you had no overhead,
he didn't have any rent,

412
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:16.370
you didn't have any woman in your life,
right?

413
00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:20.300
You couldn't drink,
you couldn't do drugs.

414
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:22.580
It was just whatever you took home,

415
00:25:22.581 --> 00:25:27.581
you had this perfect spending on football cards and fucking candy.

416
00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.460
That's all I was the only thing I could buy.
What else?

417
00:25:31.461 --> 00:25:33.620
The foils are going to buy sandwich.
I didn't give a shit.

418
00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:35.260
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

419
00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.960
<v 1>So I always had fucking money and I always remember that like kids fucking</v>

420
00:25:37.961 --> 00:25:39.730
always bumming money off their parents.

421
00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.670
Like when I got into junior high I didn't,

422
00:25:42.671 --> 00:25:45.370
I always had like an extra five bucks on me.

423
00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:49.390
Which five bucks was like having 50 bucks on you when you were in the sixth

424
00:25:49.391 --> 00:25:51.550
grade?
I mean the lunches,

425
00:25:51.551 --> 00:25:55.570
I swear to God with like a dollar 10 you can get doubles for two 20.

426
00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.590
I know I'm old.
Go Fuck Yourself.
But that's what it was.
It was like a dollar 50,

427
00:25:59.591 --> 00:26:01.870
maybe for lunch or something.
Like it was a dollar and change.

428
00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.920
So I remembered that people would be asking for quarters and shit like that.

429
00:26:05.921 --> 00:26:08.140
I always,
I always looked and I thought they were pathetic.

430
00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.230
Even back then I was like,
go get a fucking job.

431
00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.140
Always bumming money off of your parents.

432
00:26:14.141 --> 00:26:17.830
But then I was jealous because they got to sleep in on Saturdays and Sundays.

433
00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.300
And um,

434
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:25.230
the paper that I delivered the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald came out seven

435
00:26:25.271 --> 00:26:27.490
days a week,
365 days a year.

436
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:32.500
I think I told this story before I went from third grade until sixth grade.

437
00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:34.503
<v 2>MMM.</v>

438
00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.900
<v 1>Before I finally,
uh,
had a day off.</v>

439
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:40.350
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

440
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.690
<v 1>I did it every single day for like three years.</v>

441
00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.460
And the only reason why a dentist,
cause we finally took a family vacation.

442
00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.240
We were gone for a week and I remember we let the,
uh,

443
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:52.530
forget who we let do the paper routes.

444
00:26:52.531 --> 00:26:55.620
I think it was the newspaper company themselves.
We let them do it.

445
00:26:55.621 --> 00:26:59.430
And I came back at all these fucking complaints because it was some like fucking

446
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:03.870
27 28 year old guy who was out getting posy the night before.

447
00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:07.710
So he would just drive down the street and just fucking throw them,
you know,

448
00:27:07.711 --> 00:27:09.600
with a rubber band around it,
elastic,

449
00:27:09.601 --> 00:27:11.310
whatever the fuck you saying you're part of the world.

450
00:27:11.311 --> 00:27:15.570
Just throw them out the fucking window right into a puddle or do a shrub and no

451
00:27:15.571 --> 00:27:19.500
one could find it.
And I remember coming back and everybody bitching at me.

452
00:27:19.501 --> 00:27:23.070
I mean,
you know,
you always Cherub Monzo.
I wasn't here last week.
I was,
you know,

453
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.190
I was on vacation,
but my first one in three years,
you can't,

454
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.470
could you let me in the house?
Maybe I could warm up.

455
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.910
Do you notice my nostrils sticking together every time I fucking inhale it means

456
00:27:32.911 --> 00:27:34.920
it's cold out.
What is your problem?

457
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:40.970
What happened the one fucking week I was on 156 week tear.

458
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:45.810
Well you got it in your fucking door.
Dry every God damn day.

459
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.160
Seven days a fucking week.

460
00:27:47.161 --> 00:27:51.450
You're going to break my balls because I took a week off right there,

461
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.400
right there.
That should have been,
that should have let me know.

462
00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.180
I should have let me know what I was in for.
When you get,

463
00:27:57.181 --> 00:28:00.660
when you get fucking older,
just that constant,

464
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.280
there's always a fucking problem.
You know what I mean?

465
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.790
It just somehow you just gotta like,
I dunno.

466
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:10.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

467
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.400
<v 1>I don't know.
I,
you know what?
If you guys can figure out a fucking way to,</v>

468
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.320
to get a woman to sustain happiness,
they can get it,

469
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.130
but to get him to sustain it,
just go for a nice three,

470
00:28:23.131 --> 00:28:25.860
four day was last time your wife or your girlfriend,

471
00:28:25.861 --> 00:28:30.360
three four day run was in a good mood.
Just cruising along,

472
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:34.080
letting shit just,
well,
whatever.
Don't worry about it.
It's all good.

473
00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:39.860
I Dunno the fuck that I get on this fucking tangent.
I apologize.

474
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.800
I never knowingly trashed women.

475
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:46.340
I never knowingly lied about my experiences with them.

476
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:51.080
Wisconsin is going to win this fucking thing.
Now they're up by 10 shit.

477
00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:54.710
I'll tell you a basketball.
You know [inaudible]

478
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:58.130
I saw this thing today where Yell Ming.

479
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:59.600
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

480
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.430
<v 1>yeah.
Oming is a,
he's like,</v>

481
00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.880
he's in China now and he has his,
he has like a,
like a fucking,

482
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.130
I don't know what he's doing.
He went to some big summit in Beijing,
right.

483
00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.890
Is Poor fucking bastard.
The guys like nine feet tall.

484
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:20.500
Like his head is above the smog level in that Goddamn town and he's going in

485
00:29:20.501 --> 00:29:23.380
there fighting the good fight for his people.
Right.

486
00:29:23.381 --> 00:29:25.000
And that's all I'm thinking like,
wow,
what a great guy.

487
00:29:25.001 --> 00:29:28.960
I mean this guy's got all the money in the fucking world playing in the NBA.

488
00:29:28.961 --> 00:29:29.890
He doesn't have to do this.

489
00:29:29.891 --> 00:29:34.210
And he's worried about his countrymen and the guy's walking up the steps.
Right.

490
00:29:34.211 --> 00:29:38.700
You can just see,
you know,
fucking people like who are that tall?
It's,

491
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.020
it's,
they're never,

492
00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:46.610
nothing's built for their size.
You know,

493
00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.640
they fucking,
you know,
the amount of work their heart has to do to,

494
00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:53.270
to fucking their hearts the same size as ours.

495
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.650
That's why you don't see like a bunch of Eight,
seven foot,
you know,
70 year olds.

496
00:29:57.651 --> 00:29:59.150
The only guy who can think of as Bill Russell.

497
00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:03.530
Everybody else like dies in their 50s because your heart is the same size as a

498
00:30:03.531 --> 00:30:04.490
guy like my size,

499
00:30:04.491 --> 00:30:09.440
like five 10 and it's got a pump all that blood to your tippy toes every fucking

500
00:30:09.441 --> 00:30:12.680
time.
It's a lot of God damn work,
right?
You've got the RPMS,

501
00:30:12.681 --> 00:30:13.850
you'll red line in it there.

502
00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:18.800
So here's the guy walking up all these fucking stairs,
eight foot tall dude,

503
00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.960
we're in some soda,
doesn't have to be there and you should see the picture.

504
00:30:22.961 --> 00:30:24.870
There's a bunch of people taking a picture of the other guy.

505
00:30:24.871 --> 00:30:26.470
It's like fucking fucking,
leave me alone.

506
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:31.180
He's going in there and making sure the next time you double park,

507
00:30:31.181 --> 00:30:34.900
you don't get run over by a tank.
Right?
Can you do,

508
00:30:34.901 --> 00:30:39.550
the guy is solid and get the fuck out of the way.
And it was that weird.

509
00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:40.810
Is that weird for me to say that?

510
00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.100
Is that weird for me to be filibustering on my own fucking podcast?

511
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:49.400
Because I still haven't got the questions or any of that shit for the week and

512
00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:54.430
at Jesus' garment.
So no fucking text here by the way.
I uh,

513
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:58.060
you know,
I told you guys that I was going to go out and buy a nice fucking car.

514
00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:03.550
I know what I'm getting.
I know what I'm getting.
Um,
oh,

515
00:31:03.551 --> 00:31:07.450
there it is.
Hey,
sorry about the delay sending now was waiting on ads.
Okay,
cool.

516
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:11.680
Um,
I know what the fuck I'm going to get and I'm not going to tell you guys,

517
00:31:11.681 --> 00:31:15.300
you don't rip it up buying an old car and uh,

518
00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:20.680
I'm going to invite an old car that's going to cost me about four grand with a

519
00:31:20.681 --> 00:31:25.681
straight body and then I'm going to get the fucking interior done and the,

520
00:31:25.961 --> 00:31:26.380
uh,

521
00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:31.380
get it all fucking painted and right then on top it's going to look like the mid

522
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:36.010
sixties when the car came out and underneath is going to be fucking 2015.

523
00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.960
Just like those cars I see them making on,
uh,
on fast and loud.

524
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:46.150
I watched that show so much.
I fucking love that show.

525
00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.150
And I basically,

526
00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:53.740
I mean I'm trying to think of a car I ever saw them make that I didn't like.

527
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:58.030
I mean,
I love most of them,
but the worst I ever had is I still liked it.

528
00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.920
I still appreciated what they did.

529
00:31:59.921 --> 00:32:03.520
They just make such great fucking cars and they got sucked into that shit.

530
00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.650
And I was just sitting there going like,
why go out?

531
00:32:05.651 --> 00:32:09.700
It'd be another Douche bag driving one of these all every fucking sedan looks

532
00:32:09.701 --> 00:32:12.910
like a goddamned dinner roll.
Now they all look the exact same.

533
00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:17.970
Or I can go out like Richard Rawlings does and find a fucking car.

534
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.460
You know,
granted,
I don't know how to do it,
so I'll pay through the nose,

535
00:32:21.461 --> 00:32:25.960
but I don't give a fuck.
I'll find a car that looks cool,
that has potential.

536
00:32:25.961 --> 00:32:28.330
Get the fucking thing painted,
Redo the interior,

537
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.950
like it just came off the factory.
Then underneath,
you know,

538
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.240
everything is fucking 2015,

539
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:41.940
2015 technology.
That's one of,
that's,
that's my game plan.

540
00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.350
And uh,
uh,
I'll wait till the build starts going.

541
00:32:46.351 --> 00:32:49.590
And this one I'll actually show you pictures of when I get this thing done.
It's,

542
00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:53.940
it's,
it's going to be a mean,
mean looking fucking card.
Fortunately,

543
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.410
I have weird tastes in cars.
I like to think it's original.

544
00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:03.480
You know,
every fucking jerk off baby boomer out there,
once a Shelby,

545
00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:08.790
right,
they want a GTO,
they want the fucking whatever.
What does it,

546
00:33:08.791 --> 00:33:13.170
that 67 corvette try power thing or the split window when everybody wants the

547
00:33:13.171 --> 00:33:14.910
same fucking five cars.

548
00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.780
And meanwhile he got all these other bad ass fucking cars that are just sitting

549
00:33:18.781 --> 00:33:23.070
there.
Um,
Wisconsin wins.

550
00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:28.430
Was that the big 10 champion championship?
Yeah,

551
00:33:28.431 --> 00:33:32.310
they got the hats on and everything.
Let's,

552
00:33:32.311 --> 00:33:35.870
that's like an AFC championship had,
I don't think it is.
No big 10 champion.

553
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:37.370
Congratulations.

554
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:43.100
Congratulations to the University of Wisconsin for winning the big 10,

555
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:48.130
the 2014 2015 big 10 basketball championship at the Ncaa Division One level.

556
00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:53.810
And congratulations to stand up comedian and excellent fellow all around.

557
00:33:53.811 --> 00:33:57.680
Fella named Craig,
who's from the great state of Wisconsin who actually has,

558
00:33:57.930 --> 00:33:58.790
has me now.

559
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.860
Him and Jeff's Desario actually are two comedians that I know that are big

560
00:34:03.861 --> 00:34:07.230
Wisconsin Badger fans.
So,
uh,

561
00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:12.910
they actually got me into a Wisconsin plus the last time I toured through

562
00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:18.830
Wisconsin.
Uh,
Nate worked with me and uh,
he knew all the spots,

563
00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:20.270
all the spots to go and eat

564
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:27.320
all that fucking dairy and shit out there.
Um,
had a great God damn time.

565
00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.720
All right,
so let's get,
let's get to some of the,
uh,

566
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.440
let's get to some of the fucking advertising bullshit here.
Come on,
man.

567
00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.031
This is what,

568
00:34:36.031 --> 00:34:38.760
this is one of the problems when you try to do a podcast and he's still have the

569
00:34:38.761 --> 00:34:43.710
iPhone four s.
What do you want from me?
I like old shit.
For the love of God,

570
00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:48.090
for the love of fucking God.
Could you load,
could you love just one fucking time?

571
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:52.950
Hey,
why do they block your Internet at the airport?
Why do they do that?

572
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.390
Did they think I want to tweet that bad that I'm going to sign up for the 20

573
00:34:57.391 --> 00:35:00.780
minutes.
I'm sitting at the fucking gate.
Please tell me that's failing.

574
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:03.600
Please tell me that you as a person,
you know,

575
00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:08.601
draw the line there and you categorically fucking refuse to pay for Internet at

576
00:35:09.181 --> 00:35:13.770
the fucking,
at the fucking,
uh,
what do you call it?
The airport.
Right.

577
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

578
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:19.620
<v 1>All right.
What am I doing here?
Lucy's kitchen.</v>

579
00:35:19.621 --> 00:35:20.670
What the fuck is that?
Oh,

580
00:35:20.671 --> 00:35:22.920
that was when I was trying to figure out how long to cook the Ravioli's for.

581
00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.770
All right,
let's see if I can get,

582
00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:26.990
<v 0>okay.</v>

583
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:30.890
<v 1>Get to my goddamn emails for the week here.
Come on one time.
One time.</v>

584
00:35:30.891 --> 00:35:35.690
Let's see it work.
Let's see.
At work and they are not here.

585
00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.000
All right.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.
You know,

586
00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:42.370
I feel like right now I feel like I'm doing like a telethon and there's nobody

587
00:35:42.371 --> 00:35:47.110
watching and I desperately need like college to be calling in so I can actually

588
00:35:47.111 --> 00:35:50.830
fucking fill up this,
this,
this space here.

589
00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:53.283
<v 0>Okay.</v>

590
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.000
<v 1>Anyways,
what's coming up?
March madness is coming up.
Everybody,</v>

591
00:35:56.020 --> 00:36:00.060
the madness of March.
Who Do you like?
Are you filling in your brackets?

592
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.160
Like can't you just sit down and watch it?
You know,
you know,

593
00:36:05.161 --> 00:36:08.130
I'm really getting sick of people that don't actually play the fucking game.

594
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:12.960
Getting this level of involved like you play,
like be like a fantasy GM,

595
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.150
you know what I mean?
Like,
dude,

596
00:36:15.151 --> 00:36:18.180
you should see my prac and I ain't picked all the fucking,

597
00:36:18.181 --> 00:36:20.760
you know what I want to see?
I want to see you hit a fucking layup.

598
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.170
I want to see you go out there and take a jump.
You know what not even want us

599
00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:30.360
Ella,
stupid ass fucking headphones.
Keep cutting out on me.

600
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.620
You don't even want to see you do.

601
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:37.770
I want to see you just run down the fucking hall just remotely in an athletic

602
00:36:37.771 --> 00:36:40.470
way.
If you can do that,
then I will take a look at your bracket.

603
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.400
There really should be that.
You know what I mean?
Like when there's a sports bar,

604
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.570
before you enter the sports bar,
they should throw you a fucking you should.

605
00:36:48.571 --> 00:36:52.530
You get to pick your sport,
football,
basketball,

606
00:36:52.531 --> 00:36:56.670
baseball or hockey.
You get to pick your sport and you get three,

607
00:36:56.671 --> 00:37:00.870
three tries to hit the ball.
Fucking throw a tight spiral,

608
00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.830
go top shelf with the puck or a fucking hit,
a free throw.

609
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.890
You got three fucking tries.
If you can't do it,
that's it.

610
00:37:07.891 --> 00:37:12.090
You're not going in the bar.
That's it.
Then he got,
I also got to do 20 pushups.

611
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:16.390
If he can't do that,
you're not allowed in.
You know,

612
00:37:16.391 --> 00:37:17.830
that's a great fucking idea.

613
00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:22.860
Rather than do what you usually do when you open a place as you let every

614
00:37:22.861 --> 00:37:27.861
fucking animal on the planet don't come into the fucking place.

615
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:33.030
What if you actually had a sports bar and they ran it like they know those dance

616
00:37:33.031 --> 00:37:34.380
clubs where the with uh,
with uh,

617
00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.760
the ladies get all fucking dolled up and tried to go around the line,
you know,

618
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:42.810
and they let them all in and there's a guy you standing there like a jerk off

619
00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:46.770
that studio 54 shit.
Like if you have the right outfit on,
you get to go in.

620
00:37:46.771 --> 00:37:50.820
What if they actually did that at a sports bar?
I think that would actually,

621
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:56.130
if you actually had great food and great booze,
but you did that on the outside.

622
00:37:56.131 --> 00:38:00.660
Like,
all right,
dude,
here's the deal.
You know,
if you've never been here before,

623
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:05.100
we got too many apps unathletic Douche bags coming into this fucking facility.

624
00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:07.500
All right?
We want people that I,

625
00:38:07.501 --> 00:38:12.030
not only sports fans but can actually play the fucking game.
All right,

626
00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:18.180
no fucking poses in here.
So pick your poison.
What do you want?

627
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.490
You want to pluck?
You want a basketball,

628
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:24.650
you want to football or do you want to try to hit a fucking slider?

629
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:29.430
Right?
And they literally throw you a slider with a slider.
They,
you go,

630
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:34.890
look at me,
I'm coming up with amazing ideas that would not work.

631
00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:39.880
Because what would end up happening is some fat fucking blogger would go down

632
00:38:39.881 --> 00:38:44.050
there with black swing glasses and this second they found out that they couldn't

633
00:38:44.051 --> 00:38:47.680
go into this place that they didn't really want to go into to begin with.

634
00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:53.110
They would blog about it and then they would be on TV going,
what does this say?

635
00:38:53.111 --> 00:38:57.370
What does it say about society or his halo versus people?

636
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:03.390
Are you allowed to do that?
They do that at,
at,
um,
at those dance clubs.

637
00:39:03.391 --> 00:39:06.330
If you're not good looking enough,
if you're not a Hottie,
they don't let you in.

638
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:11.880
You know,
that never offended me.
That never offended me.

639
00:39:11.881 --> 00:39:16.740
I looked at that the same fucking way I looked at some classes that I was
taking.

640
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.690
Just certain classes when you were going through your educational system,
right?

641
00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.540
The educational system,
I should say,
you just knew walking in you'd like,

642
00:39:24.541 --> 00:39:26.280
this isn't me,
this isn't the right fit.

643
00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:29.520
I'm not going to get a good grade in this,
and you just,

644
00:39:29.521 --> 00:39:32.350
you just fucking accepted it.
Now you know I'm not good at math.
You know,

645
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.760
I don't like English.
History bores me and he just fucking moved on.

646
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:39.540
What can people do that at clubs?
Listen,
we're sorry.

647
00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:45.100
You're not good looking enough buddy,
buddy.
You got too many chins.
Well,

648
00:39:45.101 --> 00:39:48.210
what do you want me to do?
You know,
get on the fucking treadmill.

649
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.980
If you're going to be that fat,

650
00:39:49.981 --> 00:39:54.720
you got to show up at least with three fucking hot women and even then,
you know,

651
00:39:54.721 --> 00:39:57.240
we got to kind of sticky in the quarter and make you look like a bouncer.

652
00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:02.490
All right,
we're trying to make money here.
This is how this works,
right?

653
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.840
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

654
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.500
<v 3>I have no sympathy for people when they fucking,
when it has to do with weight.</v>

655
00:40:08.501 --> 00:40:11.680
And they say,
you're too heavy.
And then people get mad.
It's like,
you know what?

656
00:40:11.681 --> 00:40:12.670
If you actually listen to them,

657
00:40:12.671 --> 00:40:16.120
you'd lose weight and you'd actually be doing yourself a solid.

658
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:20.110
These people in a round about way are actually helping you to not have a fucking

659
00:40:20.111 --> 00:40:24.460
heart attack.
Have you ever looked at it that way?
Yes.
Sell fish fat cunt.

660
00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:29.480
Um,
all right,
here we go.
Let's,
let's,
uh,

661
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:34.310
let's read some questions here for the week.
Um,
Oh,
you know what?
Wait a minute.

662
00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.230
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I got to read.
Uh,
let me,

663
00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.580
let me get the advertising out of the way.

664
00:40:37.581 --> 00:40:40.130
I'm not going to drop it in where I said I was going to drop it and fuck that.

665
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:44.030
Let me just blow through this.
All right.
Okay.

666
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:48.410
Bombas socks.
I have no idea what this is.

667
00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:53.990
Chances are if you have feet,
you'll wear socks,
right?

668
00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:59.150
Unless you're some rich kid walking around with your fucking penny loafers.

669
00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.200
You know,

670
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:04.850
you accidentally choked your girlfriend to death during rough sex for the most

671
00:41:04.851 --> 00:41:08.420
part,
right?
Unless you're homeless.
All right.
In face it.

672
00:41:08.421 --> 00:41:12.380
Socks haven't changed since they were invented.
They fall down,
they wear out.

673
00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:16.370
And there's always that toe scene that never fits in the right place.

674
00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:20.170
Our new sponsor,
Bonobos has changed all of that home,

675
00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:25.180
saying that right bomb has decided to eat dedicated two years to engineer socks

676
00:41:26.721 --> 00:41:28.310
that stay up Jesus Christ.

677
00:41:28.311 --> 00:41:32.930
How much startup money did you have six months in?
Oh,
it's still looking.

678
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.580
The socks.
Um,
they stay up,

679
00:41:35.581 --> 00:41:39.710
they last forever and they feel amazing on your feet.
Um,

680
00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.380
for some reason they're trying to say that I have a pair on right now.
I don't,

681
00:41:43.381 --> 00:41:46.820
let me guess.
I have him on and on my Dick's getting hard.
Alright.

682
00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:51.060
Personalize your experience with bombers.
Example,
there's so comfortable.

683
00:41:51.061 --> 00:41:55.020
The honeycomb stitching hugs your foot.
So whether you're walking or running,

684
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.240
your feet feel perfect.
I'm gonna tell you something right now.

685
00:41:57.241 --> 00:41:59.400
This is such an embarrassing thing.
The older you get,

686
00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:02.940
the more you get into socks.
If you're young,
if you're smart,

687
00:42:02.941 --> 00:42:06.540
you'd get a comfortable pair of socks because you feet start to go.

688
00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:09.480
Your big toe starts looking over at your other toes.
Like,
Hey,

689
00:42:09.481 --> 00:42:10.450
what's going on guys?

690
00:42:10.451 --> 00:42:13.050
They never noticed Joe over there for the first 30 years of our lives.

691
00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:18.150
It's called hammer toes,
right?
Stop.
Hammertoes pain.
Sorry.

692
00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:19.740
Um,
anyways,

693
00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:24.330
the Prima cottony used is so soft.
It's amazing.

694
00:42:24.331 --> 00:42:26.550
This is what I'm supposed to be saying because I'm supposed to be wearing them.

695
00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:30.990
I'm wearing them right now and my feet are singing.
Uh,

696
00:42:30.991 --> 00:42:31.801
another example,

697
00:42:31.801 --> 00:42:35.460
I find myself washing them over and over so I can wear them again.

803
00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:03.600
Um,
hey Billy.
Sweet stack.
I don't know what that means.
Um,

804
00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:06.920
no,
he sweat stack.

805
00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:08.300
<v 0>Okay.</v>

806
00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:11.120
<v 1>Sweat stack stack of once.
What snack?
A sweaty money.</v>

807
00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:15.770
I Dunno what the fuck that means.
I'm like balls on top of each other.

808
00:49:15.771 --> 00:49:19.430
My lane sideways on a couch.
It's only sweat stack I can think of.
Um,

809
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:24.910
saw on la time articles about how California has a year of water left.

810
00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:28.220
If there wasn't a crazy breakdown of society,

811
00:49:28.221 --> 00:49:30.800
rather just a gradual exodus of California,

812
00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:33.860
where would you go and how long would you wait it out?

813
00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.990
Um,
where would I go?
I go to Alabama.

814
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:40.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

815
00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.900
<v 1>I go to Alabama.
Man,
houses are cheap.</v>

816
00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:46.600
You got to deal with hurricanes.
But a,

817
00:49:46.601 --> 00:49:51.280
I go to Alabama and I would either pick the crimson tide or I'd pick Auburn

818
00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:54.390
and I would just get involved in that.

819
00:49:54.391 --> 00:49:57.180
And then I would just be a comedian from there.
Or,
you know,

820
00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:01.030
if the oceans are truly rising,
I guess I would move to,
uh,

821
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:07.370
I dunno,
maybe Tennessee.
I like to south,
I'd,

822
00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:12.490
I'd move to like western Tennessee somewhere between Nashville and Memphis.

823
00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:18.020
I would live there and get myself a spread drive my old truck and,

824
00:50:18.421 --> 00:50:22.290
uh,
I dunno,
fly out to my gigs.
I'd probably do that.

825
00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:26.970
Um,
I don't think California only has a year of water left.

826
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:33.140
I think it's going to rain between now and then,
but we'll see.
Who knows?

827
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:35.780
I don't know.
What are you gonna do?
I mean,
I'm in this business.

828
00:50:35.781 --> 00:50:39.590
I have to be in California.
I have to live on a fault line and uh,

829
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:43.070
I don't give a shit where you live.

830
00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:47.870
We are going to be affected by global warming and the end is going to come.
Uh,

831
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:49.540
there's too many fucking people were too.

832
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:53.240
God Damn Selfish and it is our destiny to destroy ourselves.
Now,

833
00:50:53.241 --> 00:50:57.020
having said that,
go out there and have a good time while it lasts.

834
00:50:57.290 --> 00:51:01.610
That's how I look at it.
Isn't that uplifting?
Well,
great.
All right.
Weight loss.

835
00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:06.290
Um,
Billy,
Billy boy.
All right.

836
00:51:06.291 --> 00:51:10.880
I've been dying to email you for months,
but I figured I'd wait.
Okay.

837
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:13.280
That doesn't make any sense.
Okay.
I lost weight.

838
00:51:13.281 --> 00:51:17.690
My man and I got up girlfriend out of it.
Oh.
And I got a girlfriend out of it.

839
00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:22.880
I got a promotion due to the extra confidence that the very first podcast

840
00:51:22.881 --> 00:51:26.390
episode when you started fat shaming,
I was all in.

841
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:30.500
I started waking up early and running.
There you go,
man.
There you go.

842
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:32.030
Then about a weekend to running,

843
00:51:32.031 --> 00:51:35.060
I was listening to the podcast during a run and you mentioned cleo.

844
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:39.890
I started thinking,
if I'm going to be up early,
I might as well get that dog.

845
00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:43.790
I always want it.
There you go.
And that's a chick magnet right there.

846
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:48.140
I started looking for a black lab,
but ended up with the pit.
I named a Mobi.

847
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:52.910
He's white with Brown spots.
Uh,
Jesus,
a fucking love those dogs.

848
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:57.260
Very rare.
I've been told anyways.
It looks like me.

849
00:51:57.290 --> 00:52:01.160
If I worked out and I was a pit bull,
right?
He's got freckles there.
Anyways,

850
00:52:01.161 --> 00:52:05.600
I'm down.
I'm down 82 and a half pounds as of this morning since October.

851
00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:10.440
Uh,
the first 20 fell off.
Then it was just 10 a month.
Uh,

852
00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:13.600
come back to Chicago.
Loved hearing you on the Barstool rundown.

853
00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:17.510
Thanks for the honesty.
There you go,
buddy.
There you go.
Well,
you know what?

854
00:52:17.511 --> 00:52:22.160
I let myself go a little bit here.
So,
uh,
I'm trying to do the same fucking thing.

855
00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:26.050
It's kind of hard when you travel,
so I just make sure I eat right.
Like,
um,

856
00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:29.660
I just walked over to this whole strip mall area and they got all,
you know,

857
00:52:29.661 --> 00:52:34.540
they get an Arby's.
I never eat at Arby's.
Some about fast food,
roast beef,
always.

858
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.340
That's too adventurous for me,

859
00:52:37.341 --> 00:52:39.980
which is hilarious because they'll eat at Mcdonald's and God knows what the fuck

860
00:52:39.981 --> 00:52:43.400
that is.
You know,
I don't know what it was my whole life,

861
00:52:43.401 --> 00:52:46.190
but I remember like 40 years in the meat eating Mcdonald's,

862
00:52:46.191 --> 00:52:51.191
all of a sudden they had this advertising campaign now 100% real beef.

863
00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:55.970
And it's like,
well,
what the fuck was it before?
Right.
It's a little unsettling.

864
00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:00.910
Um,
that's awesome man.
And uh,
I'd fat shame people too.

865
00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:04.160
And I in a silly way to try to get you to fucking lose weight,

866
00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:07.220
but you really have to do,
you have to fat shame yourself.

867
00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:12.400
If at some point you're not disgusted with yourself like this hope and being

868
00:53:12.711 --> 00:53:16.940
disgusted with yourself because you know you're better than that.
All right?

869
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:20.750
What are you doing right now?
You're sitting down,
look down at your stomach.

870
00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:23.390
Come on man.
You're better than that,
right?
You know,
you are.

871
00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:28.800
You better than just give the summertime's
coming up.
Get a jump on it.
March.

872
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:33.030
Yeah.
While you're waiting like a fat lamb,
go out like a lion.

873
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:38.400
I saw this chick the other day on Allen doing these pull ups,
right?
And she said,

874
00:53:38.401 --> 00:53:42.870
don't worry about uh,
losing weight.
Just worry about kittens strong first.

875
00:53:42.871 --> 00:53:45.360
And that's kind of like,
I was like,
you know what?
I liked that philosophy.

876
00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.340
Go to the gym,
get stronger.

877
00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:51.960
Then all the other shit will hopefully fall into place.
That's great man.

878
00:53:51.961 --> 00:53:55.530
Good for you.
Oh,
82 and a half and you fucking pounds and you need,

879
00:53:55.590 --> 00:54:00.270
that's six months.
That's right through the holidays too.
Dude.

880
00:54:00.271 --> 00:54:04.170
That's fucking hardcore.
And when you only started dropping 10 instead of 20,

881
00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:07.320
you didn't quit like a pussy.
You kept going.
So good for you,
man.

882
00:54:07.321 --> 00:54:11.520
I'm psyched you social life picked up to see that he did it.

883
00:54:11.521 --> 00:54:14.370
So can you drop some weight,

884
00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:18.210
get a dog and start walking around smiling at people and you know your life will

885
00:54:18.211 --> 00:54:23.010
change.
All right.
Talks Bill,
my girlfriend,
soon to be wife.

886
00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:25.650
I hate the word fiance.
Yeah,
I hate that word too.

887
00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:30.890
It's way too fancy for what's going on.
It's my fiance.

888
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:35.450
Oh really?
Welcome to Applebee's.
And I were my,
my,

889
00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:39.000
my soon to be wife and I were talking and she said I would,

890
00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:44.250
I should own a Tuxedo because I'll always need one and it's better to have my

891
00:54:44.251 --> 00:54:48.750
own that fits instead of getting ripped off with rentals every time.

892
00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:52.070
What are you a fucking senator?

893
00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:59.180
Do you own your own business where you're constantly entertaining people?
Uh,

894
00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:02.790
he said,
I told her it was unnecessary.
We both have great jobs,

895
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:06.660
but not enough to buy a tux without thinking of reasons why I shouldn't.

896
00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:11.430
Also styles change.
I told her it'd be outdated.
Do you own,

897
00:55:11.550 --> 00:55:15.470
do you own a Tux?
Nia sounds like she knows a thing or two about styles.

898
00:55:15.471 --> 00:55:18.510
She definitely does.
Has she ever suggested this to you?

899
00:55:18.511 --> 00:55:22.050
Thanks and come back to Chicago?
Um,
no,

900
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:27.200
no she hasn't.
I mean,
what am I fucking James Bond?
Who needs,

901
00:55:27.201 --> 00:55:29.090
who needs to own a Tuxedo?
Like

902
00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.580
the little that you don't,
people will own Tuxedos,

903
00:55:33.581 --> 00:55:37.690
like are doing something really dishonest and they're constantly have throwing

904
00:55:37.691 --> 00:55:40.480
these big fucking parties because they know they're going to jail soon.

905
00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:44.080
So they're trying to bang as much hot ass as they can.

906
00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:47.950
They're trying to get to know as many politicians and cops as they can and

907
00:55:47.951 --> 00:55:52.180
judges to try to keep their ass out of the slammer.
Other than that,
no dude,

908
00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:57.820
buying a Tuxedo is about as dumb as buying a boat.
You don't buy a boat.

909
00:55:57.850 --> 00:56:01.420
You want a friend who has a boat.
Okay,
you don't need a Tuxedo.

910
00:56:01.421 --> 00:56:05.350
You fucking rent one,
you rent one and then you fucking give it back.
It's over.

911
00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:10.440
Nobody gives a fuck.
You know what I mean?
I think anyways.

912
00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:13.590
I'm trying to think why you would own a fucking Tuxedo.
And He,

913
00:56:13.591 --> 00:56:18.490
and I never even thought,
I never even thought for one second that,
that,

914
00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.800
that the style would change.

915
00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:26.340
I'm trying to think the amount of times I've even worn a Tuxedo.

916
00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:28.980
I wore one at my senior prom.

917
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:32.450
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

918
00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:35.690
<v 1>I think I wore one at a wedding where it was a black tie event.</v>

919
00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:38.323
<v 2>MMM.</v>

920
00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:44.450
<v 1>Maybe a set on the day of set a roast back at the friars club and I had to wear</v>

921
00:56:44.451 --> 00:56:49.430
one,
I think maybe three times,
three times in my life.

922
00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:54.110
I'm going to be 47 in June,
three times in my life.

923
00:56:54.111 --> 00:56:55.550
Have I ever worn a Tuxedo?

924
00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:57.163
<v 2>MMM.</v>

925
00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:01.310
<v 1>Look,
if you will fucking renting one every month and it cost you 100 bucks,</v>

926
00:57:01.311 --> 00:57:05.030
then I get,
yeah,
I guess it's a no brainer.
You'd want to go out and buy one.

927
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:08.960
What else is great?
You know,
as you get older,
your weight fluctuates.
You go up,

928
00:57:08.961 --> 00:57:11.860
you go down,
you go up,
you go down.
It's a fucking pain in the ass.

929
00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:13.940
You're gonna buy one in your 20s.
I mean,

930
00:57:13.941 --> 00:57:16.310
it's kind of a great way to stay in shape.
That could be your fucking,

931
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:20.810
your barometer.
Can I still fit into my Tuxedo?
Shit.

932
00:57:21.830 --> 00:57:26.170
<v 3>God dammit.
Harnish.
Stop making banana bread.
Um,
all right.</v>

933
00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:31.000
Sharks versus helicopters,
dear Billy,
red tits.
All right.
That's just mean.

934
00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:34.570
Um,
their alabaster.
Um,
I,

935
00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:38.200
I guess certain fears are for certain people.

936
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:43.270
I surf and block out the fear of sharks while you fly over sharks and surfers in

937
00:57:43.271 --> 00:57:47.200
a helicopter blocking out the fear of flying the helicopter.

938
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:51.130
That's why I'm in the water.
And you were flying the helicopter.
To me,

939
00:57:51.131 --> 00:57:53.890
the helicopter would be scary as shit.
Love you.

940
00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:55.393
<v 2>MMM.</v>

941
00:57:56.870 --> 00:58:01.700
<v 3>It's scarier than fucking being eaten alive by a fucking monster fish.</v>

942
00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:03.040
<v 2>Okay.</v>

943
00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:06.430
<v 3>Let me ask you this.
If you had to choose</v>

944
00:58:08.290 --> 00:58:11.410
between flying in a helicopter,
it loses power.

945
00:58:11.411 --> 00:58:14.330
And within fucking 10 seconds you're like,
yeah.

946
00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:15.710
<v 2>Ah,</v>

947
00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:20.870
<v 3>slapped or being in the water,
having a shark come up to you,</v>

948
00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:25.160
take a chunk out of your leg to see what you are and see if your edible and as

949
00:58:25.161 --> 00:58:28.670
you're bleeding out,
the fucking thing comes back and finishes you off.

950
00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:30.290
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

951
00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:34.670
<v 1>I don't know,
man.
I'd rather get it all done at once.
You know what I mean?</v>

952
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:38.540
You,
you'd,
you'd rather have the window shopping,
slow death.

953
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:43.420
I'd like to have it done.
Nice.
And a nice and quick not to mention.
Um,

954
00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:44.820
<v 2>yeah,</v>

955
00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:46.980
<v 1>you know,
they train you in a helicopter,</v>

956
00:58:46.981 --> 00:58:51.600
what to do if there's a problem and you have an unbelievable amount of fucking

957
00:58:51.601 --> 00:58:54.600
control provided you react properly.

958
00:58:54.601 --> 00:58:57.060
Like when the low Rpm Horn goes on,

959
00:58:57.061 --> 00:59:01.740
you slam the collective down and you immediately start to auto rotate.

960
00:59:01.741 --> 00:59:05.520
You have an unbelievable amount of control.

961
00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:07.583
<v 2>MMM.</v>

962
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:10.230
<v 1>In a helicopter.</v>

963
00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:16.440
Whereas with surfing,
I mean,

964
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:17.820
I don't know.
What are you supposed to do?
What?

965
00:59:17.821 --> 00:59:20.940
He's supposed to punch the shark and the nose and shit.
I Dunno,
I'll take,

966
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.510
but dude,
I totally respect what you're doing.

967
00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:25.090
Surfing looks fun as shit and it has to be fun as shit.

968
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:28.690
The fact that you would do it in what?
In shark infested waters,

969
00:59:28.691 --> 00:59:30.670
which as far as I'm concerned is every,

970
00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:34.720
is the entire ocean because that's where all the sharks are there in the ocean.

971
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:38.500
Uh,
but they're not in this part really.
Oh,
that's interesting.

972
00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:42.250
A citizen for a bill.

973
00:59:42.251 --> 00:59:46.240
Have you seen the documentary on Edward Snowden?
No,
I haven't,

974
00:59:46.241 --> 00:59:50.170
but I feel really bad that I haven't kept up on that cause I feel like he did me

975
00:59:50.171 --> 00:59:54.700
a solid where he was making this,
this,
designing this,

976
00:59:54.730 --> 00:59:58.480
this whatever the fuck and the computer word is for it to spy on me and

977
00:59:58.481 --> 01:00:01.090
everybody else.
And he actually had the spine to say,

978
01:00:01.091 --> 01:00:02.530
I'm not going to help you guys do this.

979
01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:06.850
I want to thank he did was really patriotic and nobody had his back anyways.

980
01:00:06.851 --> 01:00:08.200
He said it's really amazing.

981
01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:12.760
I tried to avoid it because I don't want my blood pressure to spike getting mad

982
01:00:12.761 --> 01:00:16.930
about the NSA,
a NSA's practice practices.

983
01:00:16.931 --> 01:00:20.680
But it was great.
You can see how calm and thoughtful Snowden is.

984
01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:24.430
He handled everything as well as he could.
Um,

985
01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:29.460
citizen four is what it's called.
Well,
I will definitely watch that.
Um,

986
01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:35.410
as soon as I can.
Um,
you guys should all go see that.

987
01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:39.640
Watch it,
download it,
watch that.
So that's your homework for the week.

988
01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:44.590
Watch citizen for trying to check out Zam beavers if you can.
And,

989
01:00:44.591 --> 01:00:49.110
uh,
I actually watched an unbelievable movie last night.
Um,

990
01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:50.590
that starts Sam Rockwell,

991
01:00:50.591 --> 01:00:55.010
who really is one of the best actors of all fucking time.
He's fucking unreal.
Uh,

992
01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:59.620
it's called mood.
Check it out,
man.
Really fucking freaked me out that movie.

993
01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:04.030
Um,
all right,
well that's it.
People write it in an hour.
I apologize.

994
01:01:04.031 --> 01:01:07.480
It's not a little bit longer,
but I'm,
I'll be doing another Thursday,

995
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:11.560

So,

996
01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:13.090
uh,

997
01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:17.830
It's a classic clips from the old podcasts and I'm,

998
01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:20.530

1001
01:01:28.181 --> 01:01:30.340
