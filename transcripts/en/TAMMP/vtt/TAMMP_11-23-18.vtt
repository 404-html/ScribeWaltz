00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.200
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:07.840
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.220
just checking in on you.
Oh Jesus.

4
00:00:19.221 --> 00:00:21.950
That took a lot of energy right there.
He probably like build g.

5
00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:25.790
She sounded so fucking old to past couple of weeks,
kid.
What happened?

6
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.680
I'll tell you what happened.
Oh,
freckles is off the road.
Yes,

7
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.330
the old fucking [inaudible].
He ate what he used to be.
Hey,
what?

8
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.190
He used to be eight going to lax.
I love it.

9
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.860
I ain't doing fucking shit.
So fuck.
Call me.
I'll tell you right?
I,
I,

10
00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:47.360
if I had the fuck if,
if,

11
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.390
if we weren't in a never ending 17 fucking wars right now and they weren't

12
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:54.530
fucking taken such a giant fucking,

13
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.570
I literally give these clients more than I make and I did a fucking job.

14
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.100
Uncle Sam going onstage telling any fucking jokes.

15
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.370
He's like a fucking character comic.
That's what he would be.

16
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.570
This big stupid fucking hack,
you know,
going up there.

17
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.790
It's like he's on a fucking unicycle.
I want you here.

18
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.200
I want you to go fuck yourself.
How about that Sammy?

19
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.980
How about I get to keep just a little,
just how about a cunt hair more.

20
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.900
Sorry.
Anyways,
what am I thankful for this weekend?

21
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.510
I'll tell you right now,
dude,
if,
if there was a,

22
00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:36.090
if there was a fucking way that I could figure out if I could figure it out,

23
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:39.690
how to get off the fucking hamster wheel,

24
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.030
you know,
because the deal is,

25
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.060
it's like you keep running or we're just going to tax the shit out of you.

26
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.490
You want to put your fucking money on the cook crap table.

27
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.360
We'll give you a little break,
you know?
But if you hit the second,

28
00:01:55.361 --> 00:01:59.200
you start slowing down,
you know the government's just like,
wait,

29
00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:02.980
and does this mother fucker think he's going to retire?
He's just going to coast.

30
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.870
You're going to get in that fucking car when you go into work,
you fall,

31
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:12.120
confuse your shit and you're going to fucking work and then we're going to take

32
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:16.320
more than you fucking make you smoke.
Unranked good.
Hey smart.

33
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:17.220
Nup that's what they should do.

34
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:22.050
Just come in like that fucking guy there and casino.
Smarten up by.

35
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:24.000
Take your head and I stick it through that fucking hole.

36
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:27.990
That's basically their vibe.
So anyways,
I figured out how to retire.

37
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.240
I saw it today and I was walking out of the grocery store.

38
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.290
So this guy had a Ford F150 with the camper on the back and I'm like,

39
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:40.510
that's it right there.
They'll let you do that.
Uh,

40
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.300
you don't want to work then you've got to live like that.

41
00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:45.090
All right chicken and was still going to give you tickets and eventually we're

42
00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:49.410
going to tow your house away.
Hey,

43
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:51.480
if you are in that situation,
if they show up,

44
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:56.150
can you take the camper off the back and then they just take the truck,
you know,

45
00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:59.740
you probably couldn't have the bit,
well yeah you are.
You kick the camp,

46
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:02.890
but right here you're going to have to move that and he fucking you getting

47
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:03.724
underneath it.

48
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.080
Like those old school guys that put the refrigerator's on their back and you've

49
00:03:07.081 --> 00:03:11.740
got to fucking start traipsing down the street,
you know?

50
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.910
Then you set it up and then some dish with the house like me.
It's just like,
um,

51
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:18.370
have you seen the guy down the street with the camper?

52
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:22.900
I don't want that in my neighborhood.
Um,
anyways,

53
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.110
what I'm trying to say is I really enjoy time off and having a great time just

54
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:32.410
hanging with my dog,
hanging with my wife.

55
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.490
Threw down yesterday,
you know,
all the relatives came over.

56
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:40.630
Everybody fucking April freckles.
I didn't go too hard.
It didn't go too hard.

57
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:45.570
I stayed away from the desserts,
you know,
I,
uh,

58
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.800
I did pretty good.
Then this morning I woke up,
I had my little parfait butter,

59
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.140
right?
I had the fucking,
uh,
you know,

60
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.420
a little bit of Greek yogurt with the fruit in there,

61
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.550
like the big fruitcake than I am.

62
00:03:56.551 --> 00:04:00.790
And then I add a little hummus wrap for lunch in between them having a fruit

63
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:04.980
with,
you know,
it's holidays.
They get me this year,

64
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.750
finally figured it out after 50 fucking holidays,

65
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.730
finally figured it out.
Oh,
this is the problem.
I got to go.

66
00:04:14.731 --> 00:04:18.600
Easy going to go easy this Thanksgiving weekend.
All right.

67
00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:22.080
I had my thanksgiving dinner,
I hadn't,
you know,
around three in the afternoon.

68
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.250
I was halfway through the plate and I was already leaning.
Oh,
it was good.
Oh,

69
00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:30.620
it was delicious.
And um,
you know,
when you put your plate together,
I'm not white.

70
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.440
I hate those fucking people is I can't have my food touch other third.

71
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.383
You know,

72
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.440
the only thing worse than the person saying that is the fucking meathead across

73
00:04:40.441 --> 00:04:44.310
the table.
Why?
It's just all gonna be mixed up.
Can you stomach right?

74
00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:49.200
Both of those people should get in a car and drive off a cliff.
No.
Come on bill.

75
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.940
You should give thanks for both of them.
Anyways,
I don't give a fuck about that.

76
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:57.990
But I will say this,
when you put together your Thanksgiving plate,

77
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.680
this is how it has to,
this is how I do it.
All right?

78
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.440
But four o'clock,
you've got your Turkey.
Okay,
it's three o'clock.

79
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.340
You got your potatoes.
That way you can put the gravy on both.
All right?

80
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.900
And then it at five o'clock,
you know,
you want your,

81
00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:19.860
uh,
let me move those all up an hour.
I'd say five o'clock is the Turkey.

82
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.840
Four o'clock is the mashed potatoes.
Six o'clock is your cranberry sauce.

83
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.201
You know,

84
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:27.810
it gives it a little nice little sweet kick with the gravy and the Turkey.

85
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.900
Get your potatoes in there.
That's good.
The fucking vegetables.

86
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.440
You know that somebody made that.
You just try to make them feel good,
you know?

87
00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:36.450
Yeah.
That's shit all goes up around 12 noon.

88
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.890
That's shit that you're going to be like,
fuck,

89
00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:40.660
I still got two more mouthfuls of that.
All of that shits up.

90
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.180
Uptalk that casserole thing that your fucking aunt makes,
you know,

91
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.750
make sure you get some cashflow.

92
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.440
You're sitting there with your fucking itchy sweater it right.
Then a,

93
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.100
what do I got?
What else is stuff?
Then you get whatever's like the sweet shit.

94
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.090
I keep around,
you know,

95
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.140
that's around 11 o'clock so we made some yams or something like that.

96
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:05.750
Sweet potatoes are simple shit like that.
You put that up there.

97
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.130
Then you got your bread somewhere around eight 39 o'clock you know what I mean?

98
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.740
And then right in the middle,
I don't know what else.

99
00:06:11.741 --> 00:06:16.200
That's some of the fucking thing.
You just stick right in the middle.
Uh,

100
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.930
and then you just,
you just,
you eat it like the way you tune a snare drum.

101
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.690
And he drove us out there.
If,
you know the,
the whatever,

102
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:30.430
there's a million different patterns,
but that's basically the way you do it.
Um,

103
00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.460
and I want to just take some time here to say how bad I feel for people who

104
00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:40.140
don't live in the United States of America.
So you don't have this holiday.
Well,

105
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.880
you can sit down and eat way more than your fucking chair.
Um,
oh,

106
00:06:44.881 --> 00:06:48.600
it's great thanksgiving.
It's fucking awesome.
And cause,
you know why?

107
00:06:48.601 --> 00:06:52.590
Cause then you got the Friday off to just lay around,
you know,

108
00:06:52.591 --> 00:06:55.860
with your belly poking out of the bottom of your fucking sweater that you passed

109
00:06:55.861 --> 00:06:59.190
out in,
you know.
Um,

110
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.750
I actually,
you know,
I actually,
uh,

111
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.000
was had to like,

112
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.000
I'm one of these lunatics one just so I tried to like make sure everything

113
00:07:09.001 --> 00:07:11.220
fucking gets on the table.
It's all hot.
It's already to go.

114
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.550
I finally realized this year it's just like there's just too many fucking people

115
00:07:14.551 --> 00:07:15.180
cooking.

116
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.750
It's just going to come the way it goes or whatever and then I realize anything

117
00:07:18.751 --> 00:07:20.420
that needs to be hot,
you just put gravy on it.

118
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.750
It's going to fucking heat it up again.

119
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.880
And it was probably the best thanksgiving I've had in years.

120
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.420
But what's great is the Friday after the Friday after like today,

121
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.410
you don't have to go to work.
Hopefully,
you know you get to lounge around,

122
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.450
you know bleary-eyed from whatever the fuck he did the night before.

123
00:07:39.451 --> 00:07:43.470
And then tomorrow you got all the college football games.
What do we got?

124
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.750
What do we got tomorrow?
Come on people.
You got Michigan,

125
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.730
Ohio State to kick off the day.

126
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.180
You got Alabama verse op and watch a five going to be a good game this year.

127
00:07:51.181 --> 00:07:56.160
But you know,
who knows if Auburn winds that,
I mean Jesus Christ,

128
00:07:56.161 --> 00:07:58.680
they,
they'd be going fucking nuts.
I mean tomorrow is the day.

129
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.780
You're not a man tomorrow unless you're ignoring your family.
Okay?

130
00:08:03.781 --> 00:08:08.160
That's the level of football.
It's odd kid.
But I got my kid.

131
00:08:08.161 --> 00:08:11.660
You heard my Kiddo.
She says it now.
She goes,
Fuck Paul.

132
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.740
[inaudible] Paul.
Now she wants now she wants it to be on the TV.
I'm fucking,

133
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.260
I'm steering her away from uh,

134
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:24.470
she always wants to see a Minnie mouse.
He goes,
Mimi,
meow,

135
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.780
meow meow.
Sounds like she's in a Mimi.

136
00:08:28.781 --> 00:08:32.470
Mao Meaning Mao.
Like what's that?
Was that the deer Hunter Mau.
Mau,
right?

137
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.390
Meaning Mao.
Mimi.
Wow.
No,
Minnie mouse went to sleep.

138
00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:41.950
Mimi Mau.
Um,
have I lost my mind?

139
00:08:41.951 --> 00:08:44.770
What the fuck am I talking about?
I don't know.
I have no idea.

140
00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:49.330
How much time have I done?
Eight minutes and 45 seconds.
Jesus Christ.
Some days,

141
00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:50.164
you know,

142
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:55.230
this podcast flies by and then other days feels like I did eight in 45 minutes.

143
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.260
Um,
yeah,
Michigan,
Ohio State,
Michigan.

144
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.490
They got to get it dead.

145
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.320
I can't believe this is already the fifth fucking time they've played Ohio state

146
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:11.520
with Jim Harba.
Unless I'm wrong,
I have no idea.

147
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.180
Um,
but it's going to be a great game.
I like big 10 footballs,

148
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.850
you know,
it's old school football.
You know,
they actually run the fucking ball.

149
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.960
I got to tell you that shit.
And I don't want to be a grumpy old man here.

150
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.940
Um,
that fucking game Monday night.

151
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.570
Kansas city versus the rams.
The amount of people that were freaking out though,

152
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.810
<v 3>who gave him the scene.
Yeah.</v>

153
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.210
<v 1>That game was a shit show.
That game remind me of the Superbowl last year.</v>

154
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:46.630
And I think that that's basically the direction NFL football is going in,

155
00:09:47.181 --> 00:09:49.820
where there's just going to be no fucking defense.
In.

156
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.490
My favorite thing about me saying there's no defense,

157
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:57.080
<v 3>but people,
oh,
there was three defensive scores.
The deck dude.</v>

158
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:02.570
<v 1>MMM,
yeah.
That,
that's just like,
let's just like last year,</v>

159
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.320
last year in the soup,
excuse me,
there was a fumble that won the fucking game.

160
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:07.423
It's like

161
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.260
the fucking rams gave up almost 500 yards fucking passing.

162
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.930
There was almost a thought in six touchdowns.

163
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.970
The guy to put six touchdowns in fucking 500 fucking yards.
Basically.

164
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.180
There was a total like tent passing touchdowns.

165
00:10:23.181 --> 00:10:24.830
It was over almost a thousand yards.

166
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.930
I think they went over a thousand yards combined.

167
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.550
<v 0>Okay.</v>

168
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.250
<v 1>It was a fucking joke.
And then everybody say to me like,
I'll bill,</v>

169
00:10:31.251 --> 00:10:34.310
you don't what you're talking about.
You just worried about your patriots,

170
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.300
which is hilarious.
My patriots had been thriving during this era.

171
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.840
We haven't had a fucking defense since 2004 a lights out when the game 20 to 17

172
00:10:44.781 --> 00:10:48.300
defense we have and we've had to fucking score like 35 fucking points to win

173
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.080
Goddamn game since forever.
Um,

174
00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.360
I'm just saying like if you're going to sit there and act like this is just me

175
00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.750
to,
Richard Sherman was tweeting about it.
Another guy on the uh,
uh,

176
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.140
fucking Texans,

177
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.180
even Teddy Bruschi actually I actually saved his,

178
00:11:05.181 --> 00:11:10.070
I did a screen shot or what he,
he basically said the way the game is now,

179
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.600
Richard Sherman is like,
all they all,

180
00:11:11.601 --> 00:11:16.601
they want to see his points because what that does is that gets the casual fan

181
00:11:16.751 --> 00:11:21.490
and the people that don't understand football,
who said,
don't fool.
Fuck no blue.

182
00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.770
I mean,
that's what to be honest with you.
If,

183
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.620
if soccer ever wanted to make it into America,

184
00:11:26.621 --> 00:11:30.560
they should be doing what at the NFL has done to their game,
which is just,

185
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.340
I don't know what they just took.
Think about every era,
right?

186
00:11:34.341 --> 00:11:38.710
There's been a Jack Lambert,
then there was [inaudible] Elliot,

187
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.180
Lawrence Taylor.
I'm just picking some of the guys I can,

188
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:45.380
I can off the top of my head.
Uh,
Ray Lewis,

189
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.730
Ronnie lots,
Mike Haynes,
Lester Hayes,

190
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.560
fucking lunatic.
You know Andre Tip,

191
00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:58.561
it's just lights out Bruce Smith's like where are those guys now?

192
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.730
This like maybe three of them and then not putting up the fucking stats those

193
00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:08.080
guys used to put up.
You know,
they just,
I dunno,

194
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.700
they used Reavis island.
There's just not that guy anymore.
They can't,
they can't,

195
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:16.810
like those guys wouldn't be that guy today.
All right,

196
00:12:16.811 --> 00:12:19.650
they'll shut the fuck up.
No,
but I'm just,
I'm just fucking saying.
All right.

197
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.890
All right.
Here's his,
his Teddy Bruschi.
Welcome to the new NFL.

198
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.920
When it comes to defensive football,
former linebacker,

199
00:12:26.921 --> 00:12:31.090
teddy Bruschi wrote on Twitter or offense will move the ball and score.

200
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.880
That's it.
They're going to move the ball and score.

201
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.220
You can't do anything about it.
He goes,

202
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:41.460
make a handful of plays a game to take the ball away and get your offense.

203
00:12:41.831 --> 00:12:46.210
A couple of extra possessions.
Score on defense is an a plus.

204
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:50.650
It hurts to write that.
All right,
so while you fantasy football,

205
00:12:50.651 --> 00:12:51.670
play in fucking guy,

206
00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:54.340
if you're going to fucking sit there and say I'm wrong about this,

207
00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:59.200
then you're saying Teddy Bruschi is wrong.
Um,
I hate it.

208
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.920
I hate it.
I hate everything that they'd done.
I hate that the out of date.

209
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.280
There's no two line pass and hockey anymore.
I hate that.

210
00:13:09.281 --> 00:13:13.840
It's just the stretch pass is up and down the fucking rink.
Um,

211
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:15.180
<v 0>okay.</v>

212
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.180
<v 1>It's just,
everything's like,
you know what?</v>

213
00:13:17.181 --> 00:13:19.470
And I think it's probably because of like smart phones and everybody's fucking

214
00:13:19.471 --> 00:13:23.730
looking at all the videos that you need to sit there.
Like a fucking,
I dunno,

215
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.740
a journal that forgot it's jacket.

216
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.590
I'm trying to think of some animal that shakes.
I don't know.
Don't,

217
00:13:28.591 --> 00:13:32.150
don't listen to me.
I'm just saying,
um,
dude,

218
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.800
that fuck I'm home's guy is a fucking star.
All right?
But you know,

219
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.050
they both look like Dan Marino.

220
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:40.530
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

221
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:41.341
<v 1>That night.
Okay.</v>

222
00:13:41.341 --> 00:13:46.341
And there's only one fucking Dan Marino that look like Dan Marino verse fucking

223
00:13:48.421 --> 00:13:52.290
Dan Fouts way back in the day.
And those two guys,
I mean,

224
00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:54.480
I'm not saying they want to eventually be there,
but like,

225
00:13:54.481 --> 00:13:59.481
I can't imagine what Marino and Dan Fouts what had done to those in today's era.

226
00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.950
You know,
they threw for four,
400 yards,
a fucking game,
three,

227
00:14:04.951 --> 00:14:08.400
400 yards of fucking game back when you could actually cover a receiver.

228
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.250
Borderline beat the shit out of him as he's going down.

229
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.320
You could fuck up a quarterback,

230
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.620
you could sack a quarterback and then like,

231
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.790
actually they'd lose yardage rather than the team with the court of the offense.

232
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.720
You know,
getting a first down,
cause you tackled the guy too fucking hard.

233
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:26.100
I don't like it.

234
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:27.490
<v 0>Okay.</v>

235
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:32.110
<v 1>I don't like it.
It's fucking sissy football.
You know,
it just,
you know,</v>

236
00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:36.340
I get it,
I get it.
People get fucking hurt.
But,
uh,
I dunno,

237
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.120
just listen to those fucking announced is called [inaudible] is bored

238
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.980
and they're not even addressing the level that the game has changed

239
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.890
at whatever.
It's a fucking show.
It's God damn show.

240
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:56.420
And I'm an old man and I said what?
I said,
I'm just going to go to like,
I dunno,

241
00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:00.200
I'm going to fucking start watching rugby or something.

242
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.170
Something with a guy with the ball is going to get fucking tackled.

243
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:12.430
I would love to do a podcast and interview some great defensive players and just

244
00:15:12.441 --> 00:15:15.560
see what they're thinking about this shit.
Um,

245
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:21.120
and how they think that they would do.
It's changed that much.

246
00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:22.830
But like I said,
there's always,
you know,

247
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.860
the older generation never likes the new,
the new shit,

248
00:15:25.861 --> 00:15:29.210
but you got guys now who literally are still playing in the league tweeting

249
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.520
saying it's fucked up.
So I want to think that I'm right.

250
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:35.420
But whenever I talk like this,
I always,
there was an NFL films.

251
00:15:35.421 --> 00:15:39.800
If anybody can find the clip,
please tweet it to me.
There was this guy,
you know,

252
00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:44.510
he was this old school,
you know,
middle linebacker or something like that.

253
00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:49.040
It's like back during the Sam House days.
And they asked him,

254
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.550
Hey,
what do you think about some of the kids playing football today?

255
00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:57.420
And he just goes,
I wouldn't watch your football game.
Can you give your fee?

256
00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:58.760
You almost fucking had a stroke.

257
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.190
So maybe I'm doing that,
but I just,

258
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.130
baseball is still fucking baseball man.
So you got,
you know,

259
00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:13.600
still got to fucking hit it over the fence.
They got rid of the roids I think,

260
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:17.710
I don't know.
But like,
uh,
the NBA,

261
00:16:17.711 --> 00:16:21.130
it's like nobody's allowed to stand underneath.
Even on defense.

262
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.980
You got to get the fuck out of there were just,

263
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:29.820
I dunno guys go when they start driving from the three point line and people

264
00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:32.550
would just get the fuck out of them.

265
00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.990
I love when the guy goes up to dunk and the guy thinks about blocking it and

266
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.330
he's like,
oh,
I don't end up on Instagram.

267
00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:42.331
And he tries to kind of duck out of the picture and then the bench goes nuts and

268
00:16:42.341 --> 00:16:46.060
they're waving towels at,
at a,
at an uncontested dunk

269
00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:51.910
in my dunk.
Complaining.
I think I am.

270
00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.390
I think I am.

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:31.710
obviously,
uh,
comics working for free,

280
00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.230
giving up their free time so people are trying to work it out with their

281
00:17:34.231 --> 00:17:39.150
schedules.
But,
uh,
just an overwhelming response.
Thank you guys.
So,
so much.

282
00:17:39.151 --> 00:17:41.580
Like I said,
it's the best thing that I do all year.

283
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.000
It's been helping his family incredibly.
So thank you so much for that.

284
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:49.680
And with that,
the old ball,
the old freckles,

285
00:17:49.681 --> 00:17:52.710
he ain't what it used to be.
Um,

286
00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.670
I miss a lights out defense,
Huh?
That's all I'm saying.

287
00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.910
Remember the fucking doom state defense against the steel curtain,

288
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:05.860
you know,
but no name defense.
The over the hill gang,

289
00:18:05.861 --> 00:18:09.310
the sack exchange,
the 46 defense.

290
00:18:09.311 --> 00:18:13.990
And how much fun was it to watch the fucking bears that year with Wilbur?

291
00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:19.300
Gary Fensick,
Mike Singletary,
Richard Dent.

292
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.870
I mean they,
they were,
they were fucking unbelievable lights.

293
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.280
Fucking out defense.
I don't know why people don't like watching that.

294
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:35.030
You know,
a high got high powered offense against a great defense.

295
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.630
Watch that chest mass instead of having just like fucking

296
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:41.423
free for all.

297
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.150
I felt like I was watching somebody play like one of those bar games.

298
00:18:45.151 --> 00:18:46.770
You know those people,
when they throw the basket,

299
00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:50.640
the basket ball into the basket and those people get so good they can use
either,

300
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.110
either hand.
That's the way they were fucking scoring.
We get it built.
All right.

301
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:55.590
He likes everybody.

302
00:18:56.130 --> 00:19:00.090
You have a wake up in the morning with regrets of what you done,

303
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.960
replaying the terrible decisions you made the previous night over and over and

304
00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:07.350
over.
Just my inner voice,
the kicking,
sweating,

305
00:19:07.351 --> 00:19:10.680
yelling or whatever else you did to piss everyone in the bedroom off.
Well,

306
00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:14.970
guess what?
But deciding to sleep on a shitty mattress,
is your choice,

307
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.030
uh,
buying.
Okay,
but bill,

308
00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:20.790
buying a mattress is so high and where would I begin?

309
00:19:20.791 --> 00:19:24.930
There are literally writing this for me.
Um,
well you're in luck buddy,

310
00:19:24.931 --> 00:19:26.280
because he likes sleep.

311
00:19:26.281 --> 00:19:31.281
The mattress I've been yelling at you to buy for almost two years will change

312
00:19:31.561 --> 00:19:33.380
your life.
Just go to hell.

313
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:38.450
sleep.com/bird take their two minutes sleep quiz and they'll match you to the

314
00:19:38.731 --> 00:19:42.750
perfect mattress.
I can't even fucking,
how big do I have to make the print?

315
00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:44.880
I'm one of those guys.
I'm never getting glasses.

316
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.620
I think glasses are for fucking weak people
or people that have,

317
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.600
are strong enough to admit that they have a problem.

318
00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.850
I don't know where I am on that side of the fence.

319
00:19:55.851 --> 00:19:59.170
I don't know if I'm a hero or if I'm a coward.
Um,

320
00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.600
it's like Tinder for finding a mattress.
I just said in the larger,

321
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:07.340
all the fun with na,
uh,
with none of the next morning regrets and misery.

322
00:20:07.341 --> 00:20:12.170
And right now you can get up to $125 off your mattress.
Order at Helix,

323
00:20:12.171 --> 00:20:15.830

324
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:21.680

That's,

325
00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.870
that's helix,

326

Helic sleep.com h e l I x sleep.com/.
Burn.
All right.

327
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.780
Hi,
I'm not getting glasses so I'm just going to wait someday when there's an

328
00:20:36.781 --> 00:20:41.320
affordable robot,
I'll just have that cunt fucking read for me.
How vulnerable,

329
00:20:41.321 --> 00:20:44.950
what will I be?
Yeah.
Did you see that?
Could you know,

330
00:20:44.951 --> 00:20:47.520
cause the thing will be fucking smarter than I am.
Then I also,

331
00:20:47.521 --> 00:20:50.740
I can't see how soon before that thing fucking brains meet with something in the

332
00:20:50.741 --> 00:20:54.040
kitchen.
Do you guys see that commercial?

333
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:59.250
I think it's for sprint.
You know where that guy was sold out.

334
00:20:59.251 --> 00:21:02.680
He used to be with Verizon,
you know,
and then they fired him and then he fucking,

335
00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:07.270
you know,
he's like the Henry Hill of fucking wireless service.
He fucking,

336
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:11.950
you know,
he jumps over with sprint.
So they're doing this,

337
00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:12.601
this thing with,

338
00:21:12.601 --> 00:21:15.760
this lady's going to take a picture and she's just talking about how clear it is

339
00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:20.320
and it's three people in a fucking robot for whatever reason.

340
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.630
And The lady is,

341
00:21:22.631 --> 00:21:27.250
so the lady taking the picture is so fucking blown away by how clear the screen

342
00:21:27.251 --> 00:21:31.140
is.
She just keeps commenting on it and she's not taking the picture and all the

343
00:21:31.141 --> 00:21:34.200
people are smiling and going,
okay,
yeah,
it's great.
Great.
And so he goes,

344
00:21:34.201 --> 00:21:36.120
I can't hold my smile much longer than the other guy goes.

345
00:21:36.121 --> 00:21:40.080
I can't all my smile either.
And the robot goes,
I can,

346
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:41.160
<v 0>yeah,</v>

347
00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.000
<v 1>right there.</v>

348
00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:46.830
You see everything that just fucking happen in that commercial they made having

349
00:21:46.831 --> 00:21:51.831
a robot seen fucking normal to the point you're taking a family fucking photo

350
00:21:52.581 --> 00:21:54.140
with it in front of the Grand Canyon.

351
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:55.260
<v 0>Okay,</v>

352
00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:55.741
<v 1>okay.</v>

353
00:21:55.741 --> 00:22:00.000
And then the human beings are in in their own way or admitting that they're not,

354
00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.930
they're not as good as the robot.
They're getting it in your fucking head,

355
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.180
that these things are,

356
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:10.020
are just normal and they should be in your fucking life and that you're not

357
00:22:10.021 --> 00:22:10.854
worthy.

358
00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.420
You know that fucking trader from Verizon,
if you wanted to redeem himself,

359
00:22:17.421 --> 00:22:19.970
should have grabbed that fucking robot and throwing them right off the class.

360
00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:24.640
All I'm saying,
it's how I liked that,
so I would've liked it to end,

361
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:29.350
but I know that that's,
that's in,
that's in a perfect world.
All right,

362
00:22:29.351 --> 00:22:31.870
legal zoom,
everybody.
Um,

363
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.080
evidently this podcast is brought to you by legalzoom.com and the number four.

364
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.480
You know,
the saying time is money.
It's true,

365
00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.090
especially when you run your own business.

366
00:22:44.091 --> 00:22:48.650
But running a successful business involves taxes,
contracts,

367
00:22:48.651 --> 00:22:49.520
hush money,

368
00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.540
and a whole lot of fine print things that eat up too much of your time.
Well,

369
00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.840
it's time to turn to legals zone.
Over the last 17 years,

It is,
but that's only the beginning.

372
00:23:05.121 --> 00:23:09.560
Legal Zoom has a network of independent attorneys.
These guys went rogue man.

373
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:13.520
They're independent and tax professionals who can provide you with advice.

374
00:23:13.521 --> 00:23:17.930
You need to get through the daily grind of running your own business.
Uh,

375
00:23:17.931 --> 00:23:20.870
and the best part is you don't have to worry about driving to anyone's office

376
00:23:20.871 --> 00:23:23.540
are being billed by the hour.
Since legalzoom isn't a law firm,

377
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.910
<v 0>okay,</v>

378
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:27.550

00:23:54.411 --> 00:23:57.710
zoom.com legal zoom where life meets legal.

389
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.170
You know,
they were proud of that.
Say we're life meets legal.
I liked it.

390
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:07.480
Alliteration.
It's quick.
It's succinct.
It's the sink too.
It's succulent.

391
00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:10.780
Um,
anyways,
so,
uh,

392
00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.240
I dunno what to name this podcast,
but I,
you know Billy,

393
00:24:15.241 --> 00:24:18.450
it didn't have his cranberry juice.
Diddy.
Huh?
Well,
Bill,

394
00:24:18.451 --> 00:24:21.540
he's been on the rag here about all the sports.

395
00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:26.310
I just want a little bit of defense.
That's all built for fuck sakes.
Okay.

396
00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.730
It's over.
Okay.
No more defense.

397
00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:34.140
You can't take your dick out of work and,
and uh,
I dunno what else?
And,

398
00:24:34.141 --> 00:24:37.110
and it's called climate change.
I get it.
Things are changing.
I'm getting older.

399
00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:42.270
Things are changing.
Um,
anyway,

400
00:24:42.271 --> 00:24:43.530
so I'm having some people over.

401
00:24:43.531 --> 00:24:45.960
I invited all these fucking people to come over my house,

402
00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.370
not realizing that the Osu fucking Michigan game is,

403
00:24:50.371 --> 00:24:53.910
starts at 9:00 AM Pacific standard time.

404
00:24:53.911 --> 00:24:56.760
So kinda changes the menu.

405
00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:02.050
I guess there'll be making some breakfast burritos over there.
Uh,

406
00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.950
Jesus Christ,
I hope fucking Michigan wins it this year.

407
00:25:04.951 --> 00:25:09.950
They said that it has to become a rivalry again.
I wonder what they are all time.

408
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.250
I think Michigan had them and then,
and now they just diffed it.

409
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:16.820
Ohio state has gone on such a run.

410
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:21.580
I would say that they caught up and passed him.
O s you come on,
you can't.

411
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.880
O s u verse Michigan's.
Anybody watching that kid down there at Duke?

412
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.080
Jesus Christ that Manchild uh,
Osu,

413
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.430
verse Michigan.

414
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:32.760
<v 0>Okay.</v>

415
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.560
<v 1>Record.
Here we go.</v>

416
00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:39.300
Maybe that's the one all time Michigan football rivalry.

417
00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:43.470
Doodah Doodah all right,
let's see.

418
00:25:43.471 --> 00:25:47.160
Early years,
the snow bowl will and woody Hayes,

419
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:49.650
God know something crazy happen.
Anytime I think I'm angry.

420
00:25:49.651 --> 00:25:52.350
I just watched Woody Hayes highlights.
I'm like,
Hey,
you know,

10 year war haze verse Sham Bo Schembechler.

423
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:06.020
Until Woody Hayes punched that guy in the fucking under the the job.

424
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:09.020
Remember that the kid intercepted the ball and what he got so fucking mad as a

425
00:26:09.021 --> 00:26:11.680
kid on the,
the team he grabbed me,

You know,

426
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:16.070
the guy wanted to win Michigan verse Oh s you

all time head to head.

428
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.210
Year by year.
Maybe this will get it for me.
Come on man.

429
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.860
Come on man.
All Time results.

Eh?
All right.</v>

434
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.710
Who gives a fuck about Wade in 1912?
All right,
let's,

435
00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:56.830
let's just look over the last few years.
Alright.

436
00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.560
Michigan is not one since 2011.

437
00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.240
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

<v 0>Okay.</v>

440
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:13.100

441
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.850
13 of the last 14 fucking years.

442
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:23.670
Jesus Christ.
MMM.

443
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:30.080
Wait a minute.
In 1998 Osu one,
get the fuck outta here.

444
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:33.690
Am I reading this right?

445
00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.840
I'm not reading this right.
Am I?
Oh,
that's ranking.

446
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:47.380
How fucking difficult can this be?
Oh,
no,

I'm Rena.
Right?
Okay.
Sorry.

447
00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:49.360
Jesus Christ.
Do you guys still listening to this?

448
00:27:49.361 --> 00:27:51.400
I don't know why people listen to this fucking podcast.

449
00:27:51.401 --> 00:27:55.580
This has gotta be most unprofessional thing.
Ebo I,

450
00:27:55.660 --> 00:28:00.660
and I thought I went in 1999 I went to Ohio state versus Michigan,

451
00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.540
but Tom Brady played that game.
So I wasn't,

452
00:28:04.541 --> 00:28:07.660
I went to the one in 1998

453
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:08.750
<v 0>okay.</v>

454
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:12.180
<v 1>Was it 97 cause Michigan won the year.</v>

455
00:28:12.181 --> 00:28:14.520
I went and I go in [inaudible] 90 maybe [inaudible] 97

456
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.860
I don't fucking remember.
All right.
The 1990s Michigan,
Michigan.
It was a tie.

457
00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:26.510
Michigan,
Ohio State,
Michigan,
Michigan,
Michigan,
Osu,
Michigan.

458
00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:33.260
Decade before eighties starting in 1980 when Michigan,
Ohio state,

459
00:28:33.261 --> 00:28:37.250
Ohio State,
Michigan,
Ohio State,
Michigan,
Michigan,
Ohio state,
Michigan,
Michigan.

460
00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:43.610
Let's see,
the 70s,
the 10 year war,
Ohio State,
Michigan,
Ohio state tie,

00:28:43.611 --> 00:28:47.270
Ohio state,

463
00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.180
two,
three,
four.
Then the tie.
All right.

464
00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.360
Did they have the all time?
So what does he all time?

465
00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:10.290
Michigan dominated the early years compiling at 1201 to record in the non

466
00:29:10.391 --> 00:29:14.740
conference matchup.
Uh,
Jesus Christ.

467
00:29:14.741 --> 00:29:19.480
Look how small this fucking Prentice.
There's no fucking way.
All right.

468
00:29:19.481 --> 00:29:22.840
Now I gotta find this fucking thing.
This is like to the point,

469
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:26.320
am I forgetting that I'm podcasting right now?
Whatever.
So you guys,

470
00:29:26.321 --> 00:29:27.650
you know the fucking millennials,

471
00:29:27.651 --> 00:29:31.150
she probably already to look this up 58 fucking times.
I don't know.

472
00:29:31.151 --> 00:29:32.110
I don't know how to figure out.
Oh,

473
00:29:32.111 --> 00:29:35.410
I took my daughter to Guitar Center for the first time,

474
00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.090
the one on sunset boulevard,
the big one that they,
um,

475
00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.720
they re did and it was hilarious.
So I took a picture of me and my daughter,

476
00:29:43.721 --> 00:29:44.201
right.
You know,

477
00:29:44.201 --> 00:29:48.070
with the Guitar Center logo behind us and she was reaching for the camera,

478
00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:51.610
but look like she was doing the rock star point right at the camera.

479
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.350
And I'm sitting there cheese and smiling luck next to her.

480
00:29:54.351 --> 00:29:59.080
So I look like I'm a fan of hers.
It's right now.

481
00:29:59.081 --> 00:30:00.820
It's my favorite fucking a,

482
00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.620
it's my favorite God damn a picture that I have over.
Uh,
by the way,

483
00:30:05.621 --> 00:30:08.910
thank you to everybody that signed up to my,
for my patrion page.
Uh,

484
00:30:08.911 --> 00:30:11.530
next week me and Joey roses,

485
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:16.000
the teen idol sensation from the opiate Anthony Program.
Um,

486
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.060
the late great opie and Anthony Program,
we'll be,
uh,

487
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:22.450
we'll be doing a couple more episodes of uninformed yelling at each other and

488
00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:26.920
all that type of shit.
Uh,
I got the free time now and we fly the helicopter,

489
00:30:26.921 --> 00:30:28.300
get some fucking video for you.

490
00:30:28.301 --> 00:30:33.220
And we have exclusive footage from my show at Madison Square Garden.

491
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:38.180
Uh,
me doing the sound check
saying I was going to kill.

492
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.200
I knew it.
I knew it was going to kill one of those nights.

493
00:30:40.201 --> 00:30:43.090
You just could feel it.
And then in the end,
uh,

494
00:30:43.091 --> 00:30:45.580
Andrew fucking walked all the way around a meet Joe and verse.

495
00:30:45.581 --> 00:30:49.630
You all sing goodnight.
It follows me all the way through the crowd,

496
00:30:49.631 --> 00:30:51.250
all the way into the back green room.

497
00:30:51.251 --> 00:30:54.580
And there was another big time comic there that I had no idea that they were

498
00:30:54.581 --> 00:30:58.030
there,
captured that whole fucking conversation all.
So that's,

499
00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:00.730
that's the direction my patriot on page is going to go.

500
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:04.240
It's to be a lot of personal shit like that.
Um,
that,
you know,

501
00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.860
I don't mind putting out there for a few people.

502
00:31:05.861 --> 00:31:08.680
Try not to do it for a bunch of fucking,
you know,

503
00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:12.190
I feel like I'll let you in enough with death if I die.
All right?

504
00:31:12.191 --> 00:31:15.730
That's the fucking podcast.
Enjoy the music.

505
00:31:15.731 --> 00:31:18.130
And then there's going to be another half hour of,
um,

506
00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.490
content from a Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,

507
00:31:21.491 --> 00:31:25.390
Monday morning podcasts from,
I dunno,
earlier this year or 10 years ago,

508
00:31:25.391 --> 00:31:29.020
whenever the fuck I started doing these things,
uh,
I'm pulling from Michigan.

509
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:33.340
I respect Ohio state.
I just want it to be a rivalry again.
You know,

510
00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:38.090
I'd like to see Jim Harbaugh,
you know,
at this point.
I mean,

511
00:31:38.091 --> 00:31:40.610
what was the last time his wife had a good Christmas?
I mean,
come on.
He,

512
00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:45.230
the guy's got a win here.
Yeah.
I would think even,
even,

513
00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.260
even when they do win,
you still gotta be like,
you know,

514
00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:51.680
when he's around the house,
he's like,
Jimmy,
Jimmy,
relax Kate.
Just,
you know,

515
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:56.040
it's breakfast.
You don't have to have some toast.

516
00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:03.180
Where do I get off calling anybody else a fucking lunatic.
Oh,

517
00:32:03.181 --> 00:32:05.610
you know what I love and went to the heart doctor and my heart looks great.

518
00:32:05.611 --> 00:32:08.370
So right now my chest pains.
I know that's just fucking indigestion.

519
00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:13.430
What would you do if I fucking killed over right now?
You know it is.

520
00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:15.020
I eat too fast.
All right.

521
00:32:15.021 --> 00:32:18.170
Now I want all you guys who aren't doctors out there right now to then tell me,

522
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.420
you know the dangers of fucking that.
What about this fucking jerk off?

523
00:32:21.421 --> 00:32:25.640
Who goes to that Goddamn island in the middle of nowhere and gets his dumb ass

524
00:32:25.641 --> 00:32:27.440
killed?
He fucking went there at one time.

525
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:30.560
He gets shot with a bunch of fucking arrows and then leave.

526
00:32:30.561 --> 00:32:31.880
Then he fucking comes back again.

527
00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:38.360
Only somebody like who's delusional with religion can be that fucking stupid.

528
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:40.280
<v 0>Okay</v>

529
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.950
<v 1>to go over.
I mean,
what the fuck?
What the fuck are you doing?</v>

530
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:46.731
Jesus Christ.

531
00:32:46.731 --> 00:32:49.370
You know what I love too is everybody assumed it was a fucking white guy,

532
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.870
myself included.
Am I guess that's where you go.
That's what the fuck we do.

533
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.170
Hey,
don't go over there.
You could get killed.

534
00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.300
<v 5>Oh yeah.
Where is it?
Oh,
we go check it out.</v>

535
00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:04.210
<v 1>I think the dude was Asian American.
I hate that he lost his life.</v>

536
00:33:04.211 --> 00:33:08.770
But I am psyched that for once somebody did some dumb white guy shit,

537
00:33:08.771 --> 00:33:11.290
and it wasn't a dumb white guy.
All right,

538
00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.660
dumb white guys finished in November Straw.
Um,

539
00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:20.590
I always wonder what my neighbors think when I Yell Shit like that.

540
00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:25.750
I can't tell if he's,
if he's gone crazy is his wife and trouble.

541
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.610
We don't know.
Oh,
by the way,

542
00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:31.270
a massively positive feedback of Nia reading the questions.

543
00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.760
So,
oh my God,

544
00:33:33.761 --> 00:33:37.750
my fucking daughter gave me shit for the first time ever in front of everybody

545
00:33:37.751 --> 00:33:41.200
to Thanksgiving at the Thanksgiving dinner table.

546
00:33:41.201 --> 00:33:44.320
She's sitting there and she was being all whining,
everything,
you know,

547
00:33:44.321 --> 00:33:46.720
demanding and all of this stuff.
I go,
good Lord.
I go,

548
00:33:46.721 --> 00:33:48.490
what are you doing over there?
What do you,
are you the boss baby?

549
00:33:48.491 --> 00:33:53.410
And she looks at me,
she goes,
you want to buff baby?
And the whole table was,

550
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.260
it was like,
when spider Gosia I,
I,
you go fuck yourself Tommy.

551
00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:57.930
Everybody just went like,
oh shit.

552
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:03.930
And I was looking at Nia going like,
did she just say that?

553
00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.830
Did she say you're the boss baby,
or she just mumbled something.
It's,

554
00:34:07.831 --> 00:34:12.060
I know she can say boss,
baby,
but you went your buck baby.
It was just like,
Jesus,

555
00:34:12.061 --> 00:34:17.010
God.
And now we've entered this chapter.
Um,
anyways.

556
00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:20.990
All right.
That's it.
Everybody hope you had a lovely thanksgiving.
Uh,

557
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.590
don't be afraid to go for a walk,
man.

558
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:24.810
Go for a walk and have some fruit and vegetables.

559
00:34:24.811 --> 00:34:26.880
You don't have to fucking do that much damage this weekend.

560
00:34:26.881 --> 00:34:30.560
He could still enjoy yourself,
but you know,
be,
don't be a fucking jerk.
All right.

561
00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.980
Um,
I don't know what that meant.
Either.
Have a great weekend.
You constant.

562
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:35.220
I'll check.
I'll see you on Monday.

563
00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:59.660
<v 6>Uh,
be yourself,
Eh,</v>

564
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:07.120
eva it.
If you're a vegetarian,

565
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.640
<v 2>Ooh,</v>

566
00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:16.780
<v 6>say dose.
Still figured dad fucking</v>

567
00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:25.460
but don't be a Douche and say I can't eat the stuffing because it was in the

568
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:29.780
[inaudible] Berber

569
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:36.620
<v 1>friends.
We hear it.
The Monday morning podcast.</v>

570
00:35:36.621 --> 00:35:37.740
Want to extend

571
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:42.600
<v 7>a very happy and healthy thanksgiving.</v>

572
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.270
Wished to each and every one of you.

573
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:51.590
And we would also like it if you took time to think of those who are a little

574
00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:57.960
less fortunate.
That's the only fucking thing I hate about this holiday,

575
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.530
right?

576
00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:03.530
This is such a great fucking holiday in that there's no corporate bullshit,

577
00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.940
right?
They can't get you.
You don't,
you can't,

578
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:11.970
you don't have to go out and go buy anybody anything.

579
00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.400
Everybody just makes something to eat.

580
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:19.320
You go over somebody's house and you fucking throw down and I don't know how,

581
00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:24.580
but for some reason this unbelievable holiday has,

582
00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:26.580
has remained like corporate free.

583
00:36:26.581 --> 00:36:31.581
Like they can't figure out how the fuck to get you to buy something on a day

584
00:36:32.641 --> 00:36:37.140
when it's all about feeding your fucking face other than food,
obviously.

585
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:39.930
But you know what I mean?
They haven't figured out a way to be like,

586
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:43.650
is this the year you stick the ring and the yams

587
00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:50.520
buy her a car on Thanksgiving?
You know,

588
00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:53.280
God knows that would be all about the fucking broads,
right?

589
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:57.420
The fuck are you going to get hurt?
Some sort of,
what are you gonna get high?

590
00:36:57.421 --> 00:36:58.021
One of the,
one of those,

591
00:36:58.021 --> 00:37:01.020
one of those buzzer rings on and make your friends laugh around on the water

592
00:37:01.021 --> 00:37:04.230
bubbler that stunk.
That was a bad example.
You know why?

593
00:37:04.231 --> 00:37:08.040
Cause I have no fucking example.
Because basically when you're a man,

594
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:13.130
you stop getting good gifts past the age of 12 once you're too old for toys,

595
00:37:13.741 --> 00:37:17.370
that's it.
You get close.
You get bullshit,
right?

596
00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.520
The fucking broad sit down.
Hey,
what?

597
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.600
This shiny thing that car and cause six weeks a year pay.

598
00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:30.390
Really?
What are you take this fucking piece of coal.
Stick it up.
Your Hoo Ha.

599
00:37:30.391 --> 00:37:33.840
And see what happens at six weeks.
If it's shiny sticker on your finger,

600
00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:37.700
if it hasn't shut it,
you fuss ticket your fucking pile.

601
00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:39.240
That's what I'm trying to say.
Sorry.

602
00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:43.230
This is supposed to be about giving thanks now.
So I love this fucking holiday.

603
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.250
You know,
I like to eat.
Hey,
who doesn't?
Right?

604
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:50.220
But every time they have to still fucking ruined it.

605
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:55.110
One of these ds network Douche bags during the Macy's Day parade,

606
00:37:55.111 --> 00:37:58.440
when they sit sitting there with their network,
ear muffs and gloves on,

607
00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:02.160
right with the fucking McGraff trench coat,

608
00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:05.910
they always have to say,
you know,
Thanksgiving's that's a lie.

609
00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.950
That's what Tammy gear and blah blah,
blah,

610
00:38:07.951 --> 00:38:09.690
all this shit you're ready to throw down.

611
00:38:09.691 --> 00:38:14.370
And then they got to go at the last second be like,
but what about Haiti?

612
00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:15.660
And then they get a show,

613
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.650
a bunch of fucking earthquake victims are still trapped under a swing set.

614
00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:24.480
You know,
it's like,
can you just,
can I just have one holiday off?
Can I do that?

615
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.080
So I'm not,
what all I'm doing to do is I'm going to watch the fucking football.

616
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:33.630
Did that makes sense?
Um,
anyways,
Hey,

617
00:38:33.631 --> 00:38:38.290
am I the only guy who gets creeped out by that fucking eight legged Turkey John

618
00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:41.710
Madden has every year?
Did he stop doing that because he's retired now?
I,

619
00:38:41.711 --> 00:38:44.740
there was always something a little wrong about that or,
well,

620
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:49.000
maybe there was a little bit of foreshadowing of what manmade turkeys are gonna

621
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:52.690
look like in a few years.
Right.
I mean they already do that with,

622
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:57.880
with the chickens don't die.
People lock what?
Meat,
right?

623
00:38:57.881 --> 00:39:01.540
So they gave him fucking steroids and now they can't even walk cause they're pex

624
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:04.210
a tipping them over.
Do you guys see Food Inc?

625
00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:09.760
It's just see that,
oh God,
this podcast started off with such promise.

626
00:39:09.761 --> 00:39:12.800
I don't even know where I am and it right now.
Um,
anyway,

627
00:39:12.801 --> 00:39:16.240
so this is the Monday morning podcast for Monday.
Here we go.

628
00:39:16.241 --> 00:39:17.920
Let's get back to some familiar ground here.

629
00:39:17.921 --> 00:39:22.300
Let's get back to what I say every week.
Uh,
for Monday,
November 22nd.

630
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:27.010
Wait a minute.
November 22nd,
this is a,

631
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:30.280
an important day in the history of America.

632
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:36.040
This is a,
what is this?
This is the 1963.

633
00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:41.850
This is the 47th anniversary of the whacking of President John F.

634
00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:44.710
Kennedy,
right?

635
00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:48.070
Cause he was the first guy who started printing money outside the Federal

636
00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:52.630
Reserve,
printed out some fucking coins and they weren't having that shit.

637
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.670
So they fucking whacked him in Dallas.

638
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.630
And then to send a message to every fucking president who came after him.

639
00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:03.310
They put his head on the fucking silver dollar,
you know,
not in honor of him.

640
00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.020
That's the Federal Reserve's way.

641
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.780
It's like when you shoot a deer and you put its head on the wall,

642
00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:10.150
that's what the Federal Reserve does.
When you fuck with them,

643
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.690
they blow your brains out and then they stick your head on a coin,

644
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.550
you know?
But if you play by the fucking rules,
they stick you on some paper.

645
00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:22.810
That's how it works.
That's my theory.
And I'm,

646
00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:26.110
I'm going with that.
Yeah.
47 years ago to this day,

647
00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:29.530
and they haven't changed anything in Dealey Plaza in Dallas.

648
00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:33.010
If you ever go there and you want to see the creepiest tourist attraction of all

649
00:40:33.011 --> 00:40:37.390
time,
they have not even changed a post office box.
You walk there,

650
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.380
it's like stepping back in time.
You can walk around with audio.

651
00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.550
I know I've talked about this before,
but for,
uh,
for uh,

652
00:40:45.551 --> 00:40:48.940
all the mates over there and fucking England down in Australia,

653
00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:54.340
where else?
Where else do I have to give shout outs to Ireland?
Scotland,
Sweden,

654
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:57.880
all the places I've played over there.
I'm actually,

655
00:40:57.881 --> 00:41:02.350
it was actually talking to my booker,
uh,
my booking agent.
Um,

656
00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:08.010
last week I'm putting together another Europe run for 2011 or write you fucking

657
00:41:09.281 --> 00:41:13.750
cunts.
Uh,
going to be another London,
Dublin,
Glasgow,

658
00:41:13.751 --> 00:41:17.230
Stockholm,
Sweden.
Maybe I can do a Scandinavian run over there.

659
00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.770
You know,
how great is my fucking life.
All right.

660
00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:24.790
And for all you European outcasts down under,

661
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:26.501
uh,

662
00:41:26.501 --> 00:41:30.580
we're also working on Australia and I know I promised yours coming there in the

663
00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:35.540
fall.
I don't know what the fuck happened,
but
what are you going to do?

664
00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:38.990
You know,
if you guys have plenty to do down there,
right.
Ac DC,

665
00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:43.280
uh,
that go through the phone with those people.

666
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:48.980
Nicole Kidman and are angry forehead in a Justin Bieber,
Justin Bieber,

667
00:41:48.981 --> 00:41:53.840
Justin Bieber is arguably the biggest star to come out of Australia.

668
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.060
Said,
uh,
said set.

669
00:41:57.061 --> 00:41:59.420
Go through the phone that I can never remember his fucking name.

670
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:03.560
Michael stray hand by the way was the football player is trying to remember.
And,

671
00:42:03.561 --> 00:42:04.910
uh,
just to be a cunt.

672
00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:09.800
I said Justin Bieber was from Australia and if you actually got upset and

673
00:42:09.801 --> 00:42:14.780
started screaming at whatever the fuck you're listening to this podcast on right

674
00:42:14.781 --> 00:42:17.840
now,
and you actually know where the fuck the persons from,
you know,

675
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:20.900
what does that say about you?
You know,

676
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:23.840
I'm sick of them talking about the Justin Bieber haircut.

677
00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:27.380
Mick Jagger had that fucking haircut on the fucking Ed Sullivan Shell,

678
00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.860
you know,
back then when he wore ties.

679
00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:35.660
All right,
what the fuck is going on here?

680
00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.410
My brain right now is thinking about making up like fucking diff,

681
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:43.100
12 different categories so I don't have to talk about the same shit.

682
00:42:43.101 --> 00:42:47.810
It's getting a little stale.
It's getting a little stale for me.
Um,
yeah,

683
00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.070
that's how I wanted to talk about.

684
00:42:49.071 --> 00:42:54.050
Let's talk about fucking a front men in rock music.

685
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:58.850
The Best Front men of all time.
Recently I've gone on this,

686
00:42:58.851 --> 00:43:03.851
this insane rolling stone old school kick where,

687
00:43:04.101 --> 00:43:07.440
uh,
I finally downloaded,
uh,
get your,
yeah.

688
00:43:07.441 --> 00:43:12.441
Yeahs out there live concert from a Madison Square Gardens.

689
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:14.990
Fucking unbelievable.

690
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:19.250
Then I was on the road when I was in Columbus and I bought another one just

691
00:43:19.251 --> 00:43:20.420
called ladies and gentlemen,

692
00:43:20.421 --> 00:43:23.810
the rolling stones and they're playing somewhere in Texas.

693
00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:29.350
It's just fucking unreal how unbelievable those guys are as a live band.

694
00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.930
And I was watching Mick Jagger and I started thinking,

695
00:43:32.931 --> 00:43:35.930
because I always left him out of the equation when I was thinking,
you know,

696
00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:40.280
best front men of all time and I might have to give it to him.

697
00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:45.650
All right?
You know,
I always argue Brady,
Peyton Manning,
I think you know,

698
00:43:45.651 --> 00:43:50.510
who do you,
who you like better,
you like a Freddie Mercury or Mick Jagger.

699
00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:51.951
Uh,

700
00:43:51.951 --> 00:43:56.951
Freddie Mercury is fucking unbelievable as far as how that dude seriously turned

701
00:43:58.221 --> 00:44:02.210
Wembley Stadium into like a coffee house and had like it just a single long,

702
00:44:02.211 --> 00:44:05.120
just him and the crowd,
not even the fucking band.

703
00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:10.580
He's like sitting down and chilling out.
Like he's,
he's like,
he's in,

704
00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.350
in his fucking living room,

705
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:18.400
I think as far as charisma and power of voice and just the ability to be five

706
00:44:19.821 --> 00:44:23.630
foot one,
102 pounds and strut around the fucking stage.

707
00:44:23.631 --> 00:44:28.430
And have everybody captivated.
I Dunno if you can beat Freddie Mercury,
but,

708
00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.440
uh,
if anybody can,
I,
I would,

709
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:35.850
I would put Mick Jagger right up there,
go watch some of his live shit.

710
00:44:35.851 --> 00:44:40.830
He sees fucking ridiculous.
How,
how,
what an amazing front man that guys,

711
00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:45.930
he did rip off some shit.
I saw him when he was,
um,
what does that song,

712
00:44:45.931 --> 00:44:48.510
uh,
the midnight Rambler,
you know,
and you know,

713
00:44:48.511 --> 00:44:53.240
the whole breakdown part where he's like,
well,
hey,
have you heard about the,

714
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:56.550
did black?
All right,

715
00:44:56.551 --> 00:44:59.130
well he dropped to his knees milking the moment,

716
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:03.390
which anybody who's watched music knows he stole that from James Brown.

717
00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:08.310
And he also was doing some,
his version,
his fucking English version,
you know,

718
00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.140
have those,
those little fucking,
you know,

719
00:45:10.141 --> 00:45:13.530
the James Brown thing where you fucking,
somehow your feet aren't moving,

720
00:45:13.531 --> 00:45:16.380
but they are moving,
but you're not taking steps and you go inside,

721
00:45:16.381 --> 00:45:20.730
decided he steals a little bit of that.
Uh,
but as far as white dudes go,

722
00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.620
you know what I mean?
Uh,

723
00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:27.410
I though those would be my top two and,
uh,

724
00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.960
I would listen to either either side of those arguments.
So I bring them on.

725
00:45:30.961 --> 00:45:34.560
I want to hear what you have to gut w what you have to say.
David Lee Roth,

726
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:39.930
you know,
as far as like heavy metal goes,
how do you find a guy,
you know,

727
00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:44.340
Robert Plant,
although I gotta say Robert Plant,
you know,

728
00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:47.230
the old thing that knocks him down a little bit is a,

729
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.190
when he wasn't stealing lyrics from old blues guys,

730
00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.640
he was singing about dungeons and dragons before it came out.

731
00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.340
So his shit,
I dunno if it,
uh,
if it holds,

732
00:46:00.341 --> 00:46:05.040
did this certain certain bands,
it's weird like the music holds up,

733
00:46:05.041 --> 00:46:06.690
but sometimes the lyrics,

734
00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:11.970
like I was listening to some old Metallica the other day and his fucking awesome

735
00:46:11.971 --> 00:46:16.470
as they are,
some of their old lyrics really has a Keanu Reeves,

736
00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:21.300
you know,
flavor to it.
You know,

737
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:25.500
the thing that shouldn't be,
whoa,

738
00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:30.240
what's,
what does it seek and destroy?
It's all destruction.

739
00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.070
It sounds like a 12 year old wrote it.

740
00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:36.600
Am I really criticizing Metallica on a week when I should be giving thanks that

741
00:46:36.601 --> 00:46:40.320
those guys fucking blew my eardrums out for 30 fucking years.
I'm sorry.

742
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:43.590
You know what?
This is my deal.
I figured out the other day,

743
00:46:43.591 --> 00:46:46.020
I have taken 24 flights,

744
00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:48.870
24 different flights.

745
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:53.820
This is the life of a touring comedian since the beginning of October.

746
00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:56.700
I basically,
let's see,

747
00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:01.470
I flew from La to Boston,
Boston to Minneapolis,

748
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:04.230
Minneapolis to Chicago,
Chicago to La.

749
00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:08.610
Then I flew la to Chicago,
Chicago to Albany,

750
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:14.850
drove to buffalo and then I went buffalo,
Chicago's Chicago,
la.

751
00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:20.070
I've already lost count.
How many of those are La to St Louis?
St Louis,

752
00:47:20.071 --> 00:47:24.360
La La to Dallas.
Dallas to Columbus.

753
00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:28.820
Columbus to Dallas.
Dallas to La.
Where,

754
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:33.580
what the fuck did I go after that?
Oh,
in between there a fucking La to New York,

755
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.990
New York,
back to La

756
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:41.550
and then this past weekend I went fucking La to Newark,

757
00:47:42.821 --> 00:47:46.930
New Jersey.
Drove to Pennsylvania,
did a college Gig,

758
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:50.860
drove back to New York,
picked up Joe to Rosehill over there,

759
00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:55.390
drove down to DC,
did a gig down there,
went to the airport,

760
00:47:55.391 --> 00:47:58.600
got on a fucking puddle jumper,
flew to Hartford,

761
00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:02.980
gotten a rent a car and drove out to Fox woods.
Did a Gig there,

762
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:05.530
drove from Foxwoods back down in Newark,

763
00:48:05.531 --> 00:48:08.230
got on a fucking plane and flew all the way to la.

764
00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:11.440
I've done all of that since the first weekend

765
00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:17.920
in New York.
And would you believe it?
I threw my fucking backout.

766
00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:21.640
That's what ends up happening when you fly on planes and shit.

767
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:26.260
You just sitting there like you're on fucking punishment.
And I fucked up my,

768
00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:29.230
I don't know,
my back got tight and the other day I,
I,
uh,

769
00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:33.190
I throw out my back and it's still fucked up.

770
00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:36.340
I don't what the hell to do about it,
you know,

771
00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.710
not only do I not know what to do about my back,

772
00:48:38.711 --> 00:48:41.290
I don't know what to do about this podcast right now cause I don't know what

773
00:48:41.291 --> 00:48:44.170
happened.
It was starting off great.
I sang you a little fucking song.

774
00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:48.550
I put an echo effect on it.
Um,
you know what?
Let's,

775
00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:51.820
let's talk a,
let's talk a little fucking NFL football.

776
00:48:51.821 --> 00:48:55.360
I didn't watch any NFL football yesterday because I was traveling.

777
00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:59.650
I missed it all.
I did sit down and I watched the Patriots,

778
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:02.200
the Patriots game,

779
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:06.470
and a lot of people sent me emails and they were anticipating that I was going

780
00:49:06.471 --> 00:49:11.050
to trash Peyton manning.
All right?
And I think it's time.

781
00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.170
I have to,
I have to two,

782
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:17.560
two fucking reemphasized my mission statement.

783
00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:22.210
All right.
Somewhere in all this shit defending Tom Brady,

784
00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:25.090
people think that I hate Peyton manning the same way.

785
00:49:25.091 --> 00:49:27.520
People really think that I fucking hate the jets.

786
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:30.610
I'm going to get to both of those.
All right.
Peyton Manning,

787
00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:35.110
the Shit I gave him was how they were calling him the greatest QB of all time.

788
00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.640
That's where I give him shit.

789
00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:39.670
I give him shit about that and I give him shit about his performance,

790
00:49:39.671 --> 00:49:41.950
his playoff record.
That's what I do.

791
00:49:41.951 --> 00:49:45.550
But I don't think he sucks as a quarterback.

792
00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:49.150
I just take offense when somebody says that he's the greatest quarterback of all

793
00:49:49.151 --> 00:49:52.510
time.
And that Tom Brady always takes a fucking back seat to them.

794
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:57.190
That's what I don't like.
Despite Tom Brady's playoff record.

795
00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:02.790
Tom Brady's winning percentage is right there with Peyton manning.
He's,

796
00:50:02.791 --> 00:50:07.030
he does better in the fucking playoffs and they're head to head match ups.
He's,

797
00:50:07.031 --> 00:50:11.980
he's fucking killing the guy.
So,
but I,

798
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:16.000
you know,
I still understand that pate and puts up these monster numbers.

799
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:20.440
But how about every once in a while you have a debate about Tom Brady and Peyton

800
00:50:20.441 --> 00:50:24.820
manning and it's sort of like maybe six people like Peyton,

801
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.270
seven people like Tom Brady,
just,
you know,
50,
50 maybe tips,

802
00:50:29.271 --> 00:50:31.970
Tom Brady's way every fucking once in a while just doesn't happen.

803
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:37.750
So yesterday the Patriots beat the colts or hung on to beat the colts,

804
00:50:37.881 --> 00:50:41.600
which is why I'm not going to talk shit.
All right.

805
00:50:41.601 --> 00:50:45.380
Unlike these fucking jets fans who keep winning in the last seconds against

806
00:50:45.381 --> 00:50:49.640
fucking,
you know,
teams that aren't gonna make the playoffs.
Um,

807
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:52.640
you know,
and then they start sending me emails,

808
00:50:52.641 --> 00:50:55.160
like they just want to play off game,
which I really don't understand,

809
00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:00.530
which I kind of get because they don't do well in the playoffs for my entire

810
00:51:00.531 --> 00:51:03.590
life.
So I guess these are victories,
so I guess that's why you talk shit.

811
00:51:03.591 --> 00:51:08.030
I have no fucking idea.
But you know,
Peyton manning yesterday,

812
00:51:08.031 --> 00:51:11.840
it's not like we beat the colts,
you know,

813
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:15.290
that's not the fucking Marvin Harris,
Reggie Wayne,

814
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:19.550
Dallas Clark and all those guys.
You know what I mean?
I know Reggie Wayne play,

815
00:51:19.551 --> 00:51:21.650
but come on,
it's like they're,

816
00:51:21.651 --> 00:51:25.640
they have a ton of injuries and that defense sucks.
All right.

817
00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:30.890
But on the other side of the ball,
uh,
we have two rookie titans that are,

818
00:51:30.891 --> 00:51:34.310
our offense seems to be built around and we were starting like three,

819
00:51:34.311 --> 00:51:37.220
four rookies on defense.
So we're both sort of a,
it's weird.

820
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:41.960
I think both of those teams and their records are a testament to how fucking

821
00:51:41.961 --> 00:51:45.980
good both of those quarterbacks are.
And certainly with the Patriots.

822
00:51:45.981 --> 00:51:49.010
What a great coach Bill Belicheck is.
All right.

823
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:51.320
All you fucking [inaudible] who keep telling me,
you know,

824
00:51:51.321 --> 00:51:56.321
keep trash and bill Belicheck you know these guys are still given me shit on the

825
00:51:56.871 --> 00:52:00.200
Internet about that spy gate fucking horse shit.

826
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:05.090
Let me see if I can put this thing to bed.
First of all,
man.

827
00:52:05.091 --> 00:52:08.960
Genie man,
genius as the jets call them jet fans.

828
00:52:08.961 --> 00:52:13.961
Of course San Shies man genius Richard Todd's the next Joe Nemeth.

829
00:52:14.241 --> 00:52:18.880
You know they do that shit down there,
right?
Um,
he,

830
00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:21.860
he coached with the Patriots.
So evidently if bill,

831
00:52:21.861 --> 00:52:24.200
if Bill Bella check was doing that all the time,

832
00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:29.120
he built his fucking resume and he has a job right now in head coaching because

833
00:52:29.121 --> 00:52:31.940
of that spygate shit.
And then he turns around and rats out.

834
00:52:31.941 --> 00:52:36.050
Bill Bellacheck and then I've also told all you've cuts out there that bill

835
00:52:36.051 --> 00:52:38.540
Belicheck is not the only guy who does that shit.

836
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:42.980
They send out a league wide memo telling everyone to stop doing it.

837
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:47.720
And if you don't believe me,
if you don't believe me,
that everybody does it.

838
00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:53.110
Watch when head coaches talk to each other on the sidelines on Nfl Sunday.

839
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:57.220
Do you notice that they put their hands up over their mouth or they take their,

840
00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.930
their fucking,
you know that little,
yeah,

841
00:52:59.931 --> 00:53:03.110
that sheet that they have all their plays on and they put it up over there

842
00:53:03.111 --> 00:53:04.010
fucking mouth.

843
00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:10.090
They put their hand up over their mouth like fucking a Joe Pesci in casino when

844
00:53:10.371 --> 00:53:13.160
they're out there in the parking lot.
Why do you think that is?

845
00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.230
Why do you think that is?

846
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:20.650
All you guys who are trying to blame that fucking epidemic of a crime on one

847
00:53:21.891 --> 00:53:23.660
guy.
Why do you think they do that?

848
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:28.740
Do you think it's because they have bad breath?
You fucking morons.

849
00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:33.990
It's because not only does everybody do it,
they're still doing it.

850
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:36.540
You just can't do it from the sidelines.

851
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:40.150
They got people up in the booth by not oculars.
They got fun.

852
00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:43.710
I bet they got people in the crowd with cameras was zoom lenses.

853
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:48.130
This millions of dollars at stake.
This egos,
it's fake.
All right.

854
00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:53.160
I just love how people,
okay.
People who can do fucking roids take HGH.

855
00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:56.910
They're going to fucking cheat when,
when the fucking refs aren't going to look,

856
00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:01.290
but you know,
they're not going to still continue to,
to,
to,
to videotape.

857
00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.470
Would that technology exists?
Give me a fucking break.
All right.

858
00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:09.210
And if any of you comes out there,
who always bitched says that Bella Cheat Shit.

859
00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:13.080
If you can explain to me why they're covering up their fucking their hand over

860
00:54:13.081 --> 00:54:14.940
their mouth.
And if one of you dumb fucks,

861
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:20.120
tries to tell me that someone on the other sideline with the naked eye can look

862
00:54:21.061 --> 00:54:24.480
through 22 players and read the lips of somebody.

863
00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:28.320
I am going to find out where you live through uh,

864
00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:33.240
something,
something.com and I'm going to slap you with this fucking microphone.

865
00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:38.160
All right?
So there you go.
I actually,
I can't believe him.
It says,

866
00:54:38.161 --> 00:54:41.730
I actually felt bad for pate Manny.
Uh,

867
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:46.950
that game.
He played a great fucking game.
He did all the fucking work.
Okay.

868
00:54:46.951 --> 00:54:49.710
I can't talk shit.
That game was tied up.
Okay.

869
00:54:49.711 --> 00:54:52.530
Vietnam voluntary comes and kicks the fucking field goal.
All right?

870
00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:56.280
This isn't like last year where he had all his fucking weapons.

871
00:54:56.281 --> 00:54:59.220
It was the Joe Montana moment and the reason why I trashed him,

872
00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:02.550
because they were already handing him the crown as the greatest quarterback of

873
00:55:02.551 --> 00:55:07.410
all fucking time before he'd even won his second ring.
So I felt vindicated.

874
00:55:07.411 --> 00:55:11.580
So I actually felt bad for the guy when he's running off the fucking field.
Uh,

875
00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:14.880
and believe me,
I couldn't believe it,
but I actually did.
I was like,
Eh,
you know,

876
00:55:14.881 --> 00:55:18.440
guy played a great fucking game.
You know,
he,

877
00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:22.620
he doesn't have any of his weapons.
He still hung in there and uh,
you know,

878
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:27.680
and I can't talk shit about the Patriots because our defense is,

879
00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:32.220
is it's just,
I mean,
it's,
it's aged me 30 years.

880
00:55:32.221 --> 00:55:36.570
I just watched the replay of the game and I'm so fucking glad I wasn't watching

881
00:55:36.571 --> 00:55:40.920
that live.
Uh,
were great.
First down and second down,

882
00:55:40.921 --> 00:55:44.670
but third down,
huge.
Jesus Christ.

883
00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:50.130
It's a,
we're still a,
you know,
I would say two years away,

884
00:55:50.131 --> 00:55:53.130
but because we have bill Belicheck,
I would say we're still a year away,

885
00:55:53.131 --> 00:55:57.210
but I just don't see us going deep into the playoffs with that fucking defense.

886
00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.100
And,
um,

887
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:04.820
and I still don't think we match up well against the jets because they have,

888
00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:07.590
they have a really,
really good defense.

889
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:12.870
So I think that can neutralize our offense.
And then they go out there,

890
00:56:12.871 --> 00:56:14.790
they have a great offensive line and

891
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:19.860
Sanchez has too much fucking time.
I don't know.
I,
but I,
I don't,

892
00:56:19.861 --> 00:56:21.840
I don't see them kicking the shit out of us.
I mean,

893
00:56:21.841 --> 00:56:25.720
we could obviously still win that game in New England,
but,
um,

894
00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:29.320
which I actually have a feeling we're going to because that's just how things

895
00:56:29.321 --> 00:56:33.560
kind of seemed to work out in the NFL.
But like,
you know,
I don't know.

896
00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:37.150
I honestly,
I honestly can't talk shit about that game.

897
00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:40.140
It was a fucking awesome game.
And,
uh,
and I got admitted.

898
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:44.440
It was a little sad watching Brady and Peyton manning with,

899
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:48.770
with teams that weren't as good as back in the fucking day,
you know,
but I,

900
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:51.490
I'm hoping that they're both coming around because a,

901
00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:54.400
it's a fucking great match up.
There you go.
Look at that.

902
00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:58.300
Look at me the week of thanksgiving,
not being a cunt.

903
00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:02.470
And uh,
let's see here.

904
00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:05.470
I have some reason I have the jets down here.
The jets,

905
00:57:05.471 --> 00:57:10.060
somebody said a bill in two weeks we beat,
oh,
okay.
Here we go.

906
00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:13.210
It says bill,
in two weeks we beat two of the best NFL teams,

907
00:57:13.211 --> 00:57:16.950
the Steelers and the colts.
Uh,
see that's another thing.
I,

908
00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.780
the cults aren't one of the best teams.
They,

909
00:57:18.781 --> 00:57:21.910
they have one of the best quarterbacks.
And you're thinking about cults,

910
00:57:21.911 --> 00:57:22.810
teams of the past.

911
00:57:22.811 --> 00:57:26.380
You can't see them say they're one of the best teams when all their guys are

912
00:57:26.381 --> 00:57:30.220
hurt,
you know.
But anyways,
he says,
I think that is nothing compared to the,

913
00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:30.791
but however,

914
00:57:30.791 --> 00:57:34.120
I think that's nothing compared to the accomplishments of the New York jets.

915
00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:36.160
I praise Rex Ryan,

916
00:57:36.161 --> 00:57:41.161
Mark Sanchez and the whole jet organization for continuing to barely be able to

917
00:57:41.681 --> 00:57:46.630
beat under 500 teams.
I mean the lions,
the browns and now the Texans.

918
00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:51.430
Why even wait might as well build the Mark Sanchez statue right now.

919
00:57:51.431 --> 00:57:56.140
Fuck the jets.
Um,
yeah.

920
00:57:56.170 --> 00:58:00.670
And there's another way I can't talk shit cause the browns raped us.
So,
uh,

921
00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:01.600
this is the thing,

922
00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:05.290
I've been breaking the jets balls about winning last second every fucking week.

923
00:58:05.291 --> 00:58:08.650
But you know,
once you do it six weeks in a row,
I mean you can't ignore that.

924
00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:12.190
That does say something about your fucking team.
So,
uh,

925
00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:16.870
and after last week when I went one in three with my gambling,
you know,

926
00:58:16.871 --> 00:58:21.760
and I couldn't pick a fucking winner.
Um,
I got to admit,
man,
this,

927
00:58:21.761 --> 00:58:25.720
this year has been really a,
it's kind of fucking awesome,

928
00:58:25.721 --> 00:58:29.710
but it's really hard as a gambler trying to pick,
you know,

929
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:34.990
like what team is just going to step out and just be the fucking team,

930
00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:39.970
you know,
I mean jet fans for as much as you guys keep winning.

931
00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:44.920
I mean how much you agent down there and fucking New Jersey with the Jersey jets

932
00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:49.380
there.
Huh?
It's fucking gotta be brutal for you every week.
But uh,

933
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:53.050
this week I actually,
I've gone to and one and a,

934
00:58:53.051 --> 00:58:54.430
I have to bring this up here,

935
00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:59.950
Paul Versey and I want you guys to give him shit too on his Facebook page.

936
00:58:59.951 --> 00:59:02.800
Don't be overly mean.
Just actually,
you know what?

937
00:59:02.801 --> 00:59:07.390
You would really be funny if you guys all just sent him letters of condolences

938
00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:10.840
and you just hope that he's doing all right.
And if he needs anything,

939
00:59:10.841 --> 00:59:15.010
you're there for him.
Just,
just go with that angle.
Um,

940
00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:20.110
because he did the unthinkable,
the unprecedented last week.

941
00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:24.930
Okay.
We,
we picked four games each week against the spread and against,

942
00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.760
I don't know how,
how many odds and I,

943
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:30.800
how many odds were stacked up against this man.
But Paul Versey

944
00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:35.080
when,
oh,
in four last week,

945
00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:42.640
he fucking would have been better off if you blindfolded him,

946
00:59:42.641 --> 00:59:46.540
spun him around three times and gave my handful of darts and there was teams

947
00:59:46.541 --> 00:59:49.330
written on the wall and it just said,
start throwing.

948
00:59:50.370 --> 00:59:52.710
I broke his balls a little bit.
I was like,
Jesus Christ,

949
00:59:52.711 --> 00:59:53.880
I don't even think Nia could do that.

950
00:59:58.350 --> 01:00:02.160
Oh,
so if you have time,
go to Paul Versey on Facebook via our Z.

951
01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:05.650
I don't be a con because it's the week of thanksgiving.

952
01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:10.110
Just just send him letters of condolences.

953
01:00:10.111 --> 01:00:13.990
Just Act.
Treat him as though a family member just passed,
you know,

954
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.620
or maybe like a family pet,
you know,
not a young family member.

955
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:22.480
Like you know,
somebody like I like a grandfather that lived,
you know,

956
01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:26.030
it was 97 and died,
you know those weird things where it's like,
you know,

957
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.160
you guys,
hello,
I'm so sorry for your loss,

958
01:00:28.161 --> 01:00:32.630
but you know the fuck you lived to be 97,
the lucky son of a bitch.

959
01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:37.750
Um Oh in fucking four.
I mean,
I almost did it last week,
one in three.

960
01:00:37.751 --> 01:00:39.690
But that's the thing about going,
oh,
and for,
I mean it's,

961
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:43.610
it's like going Oh and 16 in the NFL.
Somebody,

962
01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:47.720
somebody is going to come around and do you a favor.
Right?
So tonight,

963
01:00:47.721 --> 01:00:48.860
the last game I have,

964
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:53.220
this is just like that Seahawks game last week when I picked Arizona and the

965
01:00:53.221 --> 01:00:56.640
second I picked Arizona,
I'm like,
no dude,
pick the Seahawks.
And I was like,
no,

966
01:00:56.641 --> 01:00:59.640
stick with your first choice for some stupid fucking reason.

967
01:00:59.641 --> 01:01:02.920
I took Denver and the points tonight and uh,

968
01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:08.020
I just really can see Philip Rivers coming out there with a fucking vengeance,

969
01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:10.850
you know?
Oh,

970
01:01:10.851 --> 01:01:14.300
I got to give a shout out to one of my listeners who I didn't even see the
email,

971
01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:19.360
but he gave me five pics for this week and he went for and one against the

972
01:01:19.851 --> 01:01:24.750
spread.
So a hats off to you,
sir.
You are a,
you're a better man than me.

973
01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:29.670
Um,
all right,
let's move on here.
Let's get on with the,
uh,

974
01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:33.810
oh my drinking.
People are asking me about my drinking or the lack thereof.

975
01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:38.800
Uh,
yes.
This is my 37th day of sobriety.
I got this shit down.

976
01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:41.640
I got it down.
I've gone to who I'm,

977
01:01:41.641 --> 01:01:46.641
I'm easily going to make it to the rose bowl because I've already,

978
01:01:46.851 --> 01:01:50.510
I've already gone through my tough drink in towns.
I went to DC,

979
01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.480
I went through New York,
I worked with Joe to Rosa,

980
01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:58.980
Chicago,
Minneapolis.
What the fuck else are you going to do up there?

981
01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.400
MMM.
Oh,
by the way,
I,

982
01:02:02.401 --> 01:02:06.450
so I saw that show man versus food and that was a show that I used to make fun

983
01:02:06.451 --> 01:02:10.490
of.
I thought it was fucking stupid.
And uh,
it's just like,
Eh,
this is dumb.

984
01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:15.120
I don't know.
Watch this fucking sweaty guy,
eat all this God damn food.

985
01:02:15.121 --> 01:02:18.570
And I don't what happened.
I was on the road and I watched him,

986
01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:25.500
I don't know where he was,
but he fucking,
uh,
he,
he,

987
01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.660
he ate this sandwich was a hit,

988
01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:32.661
eat a Turkey sandwich that I swear to God was the size of a purse who stack that

989
01:02:33.661 --> 01:02:35.370
fucking high.
It was ridiculous.

990
01:02:35.371 --> 01:02:40.371
And then it came with a shake that you could literally put,

991
01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:44.220
you could like,
you know,
people who like have like a,

992
01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:49.230
like a tree growing in their house,
you know,
big that fucking pot is that,

993
01:02:49.231 --> 01:02:52.110
that that was all,
it was four pounds of milkshake.

994
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:57.660
So the dude eats all but two bites of the Turkey Sandwich.

995
01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:01.930
He sucks down this shake that looked like Yo,

996
01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:05.940
you fucking was it as big as a fire hydrant,

997
01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:09.150
worth the fucking milkshake.
He sucks his whole fucking thing down.

998
01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:13.800
He's got 20 minutes to go to eat the final two fucking bites.

999
01:03:13.801 --> 01:03:18.390
And he's just sitting there with like,
you know,
like the thinker,

1000
01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:20.190
you know that pose,
that great statute.

1001
01:03:20.191 --> 01:03:25.191
He's sitting there like that except he sweating and it took him 17 minutes to

1002
01:03:25.411 --> 01:03:26.340
eat two bites.
I mean,

1003
01:03:26.341 --> 01:03:29.430
I could've stuck both bites in my mouth and an I'm in like 30 seconds.

1004
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:34.670
That's how fucking full this guy was and how hard he had to concentrate to not

1005
01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:39.030
just fucking blow Chow right after he fuck upload Chow.

1006
01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:41.130
Jesus Christ.
That's from my high school days.

1007
01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:47.070
Dog Hair about Eddie yabbies drank any fucking blue chow last night kid.
Um,

1008
01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:52.270
try and not to fucking puke.
But anyways,
he went to uh,

1009
01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:56.010
he went to Minneapolis and uh,
he,

1010
01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:00.930
there was some sort of sandwich up there that two places claim.

1011
01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:05.940
What the fuck was the sandwich to places claim that they are the original.

1012
01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:10.470
Could somebody please tell me what that place is,
what the name of that place is?

1013
01:04:10.471 --> 01:04:12.300
I want to fucking go there is,

1014
01:04:12.301 --> 01:04:17.301
I want to try that sound cause it looked delicious and for that matter if you

1015
01:04:17.311 --> 01:04:17.860
see a,

1016
01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:22.260
a city that I'm going to from coming to your city and there's that fucking place

1017
01:04:22.261 --> 01:04:23.130
where you got to go.

1018
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:27.520
Like when I went to buffalo and they had anchor bar and a was it Duffy's or

1019
01:04:27.521 --> 01:04:30.210
something like that,
like those are the two places to get,

1020
01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.330
you know they basically invented buffalo wings.

1021
01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:35.190
If you know of any of those places,

1022
01:04:35.191 --> 01:04:38.580
please let me know because I'm really running out of fucking sporting events to

1023
01:04:38.581 --> 01:04:41.940
go to,
you know,
unless I want to start to go into like,
you know,

1024
01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:45.210
little league games and stand there like a fucking pervert.

1025
01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:52.890
I'll just show up with those black frame glasses standing,
you know,

1026
01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:57.330
close enough to the field,
but just far enough away from the rest of the crowd,

1027
01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:01.130
you know,
all by myself,
just looking like a fucking creep.
Um,

1028
01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:04.140
please let me know this because I've got to tell you,
you know,

1029
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:07.800
I'm having a fucking,
I'm having more goddamn fun on the road right now.

1030
01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:13.320
I'm just meeting a lot of,
you know,
I'm finally getting to do some theaters.
Uh,

1031
01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:15.840
I'm having great shows.
I know,

1032
01:05:15.841 --> 01:05:20.841
I feel like I got my new hour is starting to get solid and uh,

1033
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.550
I dunno,
I'm not boozing so I'm kind of doing other shit,

1034
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.070
checking out some restaurants and whatnot.
So if you know of the,

1035
01:05:28.071 --> 01:05:31.270
some of those places,
please let me know.
All right.
And with that,

1036
01:05:31.271 --> 01:05:33.580
let's get on with the drinking question.
Uh,
hey bill.

1037
01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.460
So now that you have 30 plus days,
37,

1038
01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:41.200
30 plus days without any booze in you,
what are the pros and cons?

1039
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:44.110
I remember when you were going,
when you were on the wagon earlier this year,

1040
01:05:44.290 --> 01:05:49.270
you said something to the effect of it being a little boring and you remembered

1041
01:05:49.271 --> 01:05:50.650
every second of every day.

1042
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:55.570
I'm really interested to hear what the pros are in your opinion.
Uh,

1043
01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:59.500
do you feel more energetic,
clear-minded et cetera.
By the way,

1044
01:05:59.501 --> 01:06:02.500
are you a little squeamish to about Frankenstein man?

1045
01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:06.520
What Frankenstein manning is going to do to the pet secondary tomorrow go pets.

1046
01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:11.380
Yeah.
See,
yeah,
true.
Patriot fans were fucking nervous.
Uh,
yeah,
I was,

1047
01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:13.330
I was nervous.
Um,

1048
01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:18.360
the only thing I was counting on was the fact that he wasn't coming in with the

1049
01:06:18.821 --> 01:06:22.480
Colt team that you are used to.
But anyways,
back to the drinking questions.
Uh,

1050
01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:27.160
what are the pros and cons?
All right,

1051
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:31.630
let's go with the cons first.
Cause those are funnier.
The cons are,

1052
01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:32.793
uh,

1053
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:38.990
you know what the hardest part about not drinking is,
is you,
you,

1054
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000
you'll never realize how much you are bombarded with beer commercials until you

1055
01:06:44.441 --> 01:06:48.250
stopped drinking.
And it's not the dumb beer commercials.
You know,

1056
01:06:48.251 --> 01:06:53.110
the ones like the corona ones where it's the battle of the sexes or those ones

1057
01:06:53.111 --> 01:06:56.890
where they,
you know,
they're just trying to be funny where they just like a,
yeah.

1058
01:06:56.891 --> 01:06:58.870
You know,
why don't you order a real beer?
Well,
you know,

1059
01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:03.130
when you take your skirt off for whatever,
you know,
those are just silly.

1060
01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:07.330
Or those fucking Budweiser frogs and lizards back in the day,

1061
01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.340
those ones don't make you want to drink.

1062
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:14.040
But those ones where they talk about the clean,
refreshing,
you know,
and they,

1063
01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:15.130
you know,

1064
01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:19.540
without those fucking Sam Adams commercials with the guy with the beard is

1065
01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:21.610
bearing his face into all those hops.

1066
01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.990
And then they just did just pour in the fucking beer into that perfect beer

1067
01:07:25.991 --> 01:07:30.280
glass.
Those are the ones where I start fucking,
you know,

1068
01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:35.290
I start getting all clammy,
like,
uh,
you know,

1069
01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:38.740
and it's weird when you're not drinking because if I'm drinking,

1070
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:39.910
I see one of those,
I'll just,

1071
01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:42.370
I'll either not even notice it or I'll just be like,
God damn,

1072
01:07:42.371 --> 01:07:45.700
I want a beer and I'll go get one.
But when I'm going cold Turkey,

1073
01:07:45.701 --> 01:07:47.500
when I see those commercials,
I'm like,
God damn,

1074
01:07:47.501 --> 01:07:52.420
I would like about 56 of those right about now.
I would like to man versus booze.

1075
01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:59.560
Oh fuck.
There's a youtube video.
Don't do it.
I don't condone it.
But if you do it,

1076
01:07:59.561 --> 01:08:04.510
I'm gonna Watch it.
The health risks are unbelievably dangerous.

1077
01:08:04.511 --> 01:08:08.000
Do not do that.
Do not.
You cannot do man versus boost.

1078
01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:10.690
Somebody's going to fucking die.
Uh,

1079
01:08:10.691 --> 01:08:12.850
which is why they don't have any of those challenges in a bar.

1080
01:08:12.851 --> 01:08:15.280
So strike all of that.
Do not do that.
But that's,

1081
01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:17.510
that's what those beer commercials make me want to do,

1082
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:23.150
man versus booze.
And it makes me want to sit there and,
uh,

1083
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:29.030
oh God.
How about a fun challenge that would be,
can you imagine if you had like,

1084
01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:32.150
you don't you like those,
uh,
this how much I want to drink right now.
You know,

1085
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:35.360
you know those,
you know those,
those refrigerators that you,

1086
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:39.680
that people keep wine bottles in,
wine,
wine,
wine,
fridges,

1087
01:08:40.190 --> 01:08:43.610
refrigerated wine things,
so fucking stupid.

1088
01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.080
Whatever the fuck you call those things.

1089
01:08:45.081 --> 01:08:46.760
You know what they had the glass door so he can see,

1090
01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.590
you can see the bottles chilling in there.

1091
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:51.260
Imagine if you had a fucking ceiling to floor,

1092
01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:58.060
just like a refrigerator that had a glass door and behind it you just saw a

1093
01:08:58.371 --> 01:09:02.960
bunch of frosty fucking bottles of beer,
you know,
in,
in,
on,
in.

1094
01:09:02.961 --> 01:09:07.961
The other one was just a bunch of frosty fucking awesome looking beard glasses.

1095
01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:11.570
Right.
And you at,
you had to kill them all.

1096
01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:18.260
Even if he couldn't fucking do it.
The pneumonic,
God damn fun that would be,
see,

1097
01:09:18.261 --> 01:09:22.640
this is why I'm never going to make it.
I'm not,
I'm not going to go my whole life

1098
01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:26.600
because uh,
you know what?

1099
01:09:26.601 --> 01:09:29.720
I think I might do that with Derosa when I eventually get off the wagon,

1100
01:09:29.721 --> 01:09:31.490
we might do man versus boots.

1101
01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.210
What is wrong with me?
See this,

1102
01:09:35.211 --> 01:09:39.800
this is the cons of going just totally cold Turkey is you start having

1103
01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:40.461
fantasies.

1104
01:09:40.461 --> 01:09:44.990
Like I just got lost in that Jesus Christ and then I was thinking like,
yeah,

1105
01:09:44.991 --> 01:09:46.810
we'll do what?
We'll fucking take a vacation.

1106
01:09:46.811 --> 01:09:48.980
You will have a fucking house on a lake like this.

1107
01:09:48.981 --> 01:09:53.930
How homoerotic fucking beer fantasy with Joe to Rosa.
The fuck is wrong with me.

1108
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:56.390
That's what I was literally thinking.
You know?

1109
01:09:56.391 --> 01:09:57.650
Cause when you do something like that,

1110
01:09:57.651 --> 01:10:02.450
you want to make sure you got no place else to go.
Okay.

1111
01:10:02.451 --> 01:10:07.160
That's one of the cons.
You start fantasizing about booze so much.

1112
01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:10.640
You actually put yourself in such a semi gay situation with one of your best

1113
01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:11.474
friends.

1114
01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.630
Ah,
God damn it.

1115
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:20.930
One of the things I love most about Joe to Rosa is he's a complete fuck up.

1116
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:22.220
That's what I love about it.
You know,

1117
01:10:22.221 --> 01:10:26.000
there's nothing better than hanging out with a fuckup is is because you know it.

1118
01:10:26.001 --> 01:10:28.730
There's no pressure for you to get your shit together.

1119
01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.970
It's like when you hang out with a do gooder gooder,
it's a constant reminder of,

1120
01:10:32.971 --> 01:10:36.890
of,
of how awful you are as a person and how shitty your living your life.

1121
01:10:36.891 --> 01:10:40.430
But when you get hang out with a guy like Joe to Rosa,
you know,

1122
01:10:40.730 --> 01:10:45.350
he's smart about it.
He gets his work done,
he finishes writing the script,

1123
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:50.900
he does his shows,
but afterwards he's old school.
He really is.

1124
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:56.330
He's like Dean Martin without the charisma and the good looks.
Um,
anyways,

1125
01:10:56.331 --> 01:11:00.950
why am I trashed?
And Joe on Thanksgiving,
it's a week to give thanks.

1126
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:02.120
I give thanks to that.

1127
01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:06.770
You know that Joe to Rosa and for years us Comedians have always trashed Joseph

1128
01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:10.970
Joe to Rosa talking about how he doesn't have any shoulders and I have

1129
01:11:10.971 --> 01:11:14.910
maintained for a good two and a half years I've been screaming,

1130
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:19.860
I've been telling to,
to,
to people with def yelling at deaf ears,

1131
01:11:19.861 --> 01:11:22.530
what's that fucking expression,
whatever.

1132
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:26.610
I'm talking to people and not listen to me.
Joe Derosa does not lack shoulders.

1133
01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:27.720
He has shoulders.

1134
01:11:27.721 --> 01:11:31.800
But what he doesn't have is that those two chunks of flesh,

1135
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:38.220
you know,
the chunk of flesh on either side of your neck,
uh,
either,
yeah,

1136
01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:41.430
between your neck and your shoulder.
That that meat right there,

1137
01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:44.610
the trap Pz Muscle.
Is that what it is?
He doesn't have that.

1138
01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.120
He doesn't have collarbones that's what happened.

1139
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:51.780
His collarbones never grew while the rest of his skeletal system grew.

1140
01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:56.250
His collarbones didn't.
So,
uh,
hence there was no need to put flesh in there.

1141
01:11:56.310 --> 01:12:00.540
So Joe is a head,
he's a neck and on either side of his neck,

1142
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:04.830
he had his ball and socket joints for his shoulders are right where those,

1143
01:12:04.831 --> 01:12:08.310
those rivets were on the side of Frankenstein's next nec,

1144
01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:11.640
next plural idiot.
All right,
let's plow ahead here.

1145
01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:13.740
36 minutes in.

1146
01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:18.770
So those are the cons as you start fantasizing about booze and a,

1147
01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:22.200
for me anyways,
I can't speak for anybody else,

1148
01:12:22.201 --> 01:12:27.201
but it just makes you want to drink like 90 fucking beers like that.

1149
01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:31.500
There's a bar,
there's a German bar on the upper east side.

1150
01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:36.540
And this time when not when I go off the wagon,
this is where I want to go.

1151
01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:39.750
They have this insane,

1152
01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.990
I can't remember if it's a boot or if it's one of those things,

1153
01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:46.380
those beer glasses that looks like a giant fucking bond.

1154
01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:51.410
Um,
you know,
like I,

1155
01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:52.530
that's what I wanna drink.

1156
01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:56.820
I wanna drink one of those or just one of those giant mugs of fucking beer.

1157
01:12:56.850 --> 01:13:00.600
That's the con right now,
because as great as I feel,

1158
01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:04.560
that's what I think of in my head when I think about drinking everyday.

1159
01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:09.350
The glass gets bigger.
Frostier and uh,

1160
01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:10.840
Jesus,
I'm gonna,

1161
01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:13.440
I'm gonna start drinking halfway through this podcast if I keep talking about
it.

1162
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:14.521
All right.
Uh,

1163
01:13:14.521 --> 01:13:19.521
what are the pros weight loss specifically in your face?

1164
01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:24.690
It,
you,
you face tightens up.
It's great.
You get your jaw line back.

1165
01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:27.090
Uh,

1166
01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:32.700
when some drunk whore comes up to you with fucking cigarettes and wine breath,

1167
01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:36.870
you see her for what she is.
All right.

1168
01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:38.790
You don't hang out with people after the show.

1169
01:13:38.791 --> 01:13:41.540
They get all drunk and fucking loud.
And what you end up,

1170
01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:45.570
you're standing there and what you really start hearing is these cliched

1171
01:13:45.571 --> 01:13:50.160
conversations that you have participated in for the last 25 fucking years of

1172
01:13:50.161 --> 01:13:52.470
your life.
You know,

1173
01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:57.710
you stand back and you get to watch people slowly lose control of their,

1174
01:13:57.721 --> 01:14:02.070
uh,
their judgment.
Um,

1175
01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:05.670
and you start to see people say things and do things that they're going to

1176
01:14:05.671 --> 01:14:06.451
apologize,

1177
01:14:06.451 --> 01:14:10.710
the regret for regret for or regret the next day.

1178
01:14:11.650 --> 01:14:15.820
Um,
what else?
Uh,

1179
01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:19.900
it starts to make you look at where you are and your life,
you know?

1180
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:23.590
And uh,
I don't know if you're going to do something that's sort of scummy,

1181
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:28.710
you have to do it stone sober.
And I think a lot of times when I do dirt bags,

1182
01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.600
Shit,
you know,
or I just do dumb shit.

1183
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:36.490
I think it's because I'm drunk and I think that's why I'm drinking.

1184
01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:40.240
He's cause I'm shouting down that voice in my head that's telling me,
bill,

1185
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:44.500
go to bed right now.
Just go to bed,
read,
you know,

1186
01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:47.800
finish that script.
That's another thing too was I started drinking.

1187
01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.520
When I start thinking of the sketch I was going to write or something like that

1188
01:14:50.521 --> 01:14:53.860
and I haven't done it.
And I'm like,
Oh,
I'm going to do it tomorrow.

1189
01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:55.320
And I start thinking,
you know,

1190
01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:59.260
the successful guys would be at going back to the hotel room right now and

1191
01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:03.940
they'd be finishing it,
right.
Take out a little fucking feathered,

1192
01:15:04.330 --> 01:15:07.720
you know,
stick it in that inkwell and they would finish writing it out.
But not,

1193
01:15:07.721 --> 01:15:08.231
you hear you.

1194
01:15:08.231 --> 01:15:11.770
Are you sitting here talking to these fucking people about football from the

1195
01:15:11.771 --> 01:15:15.940
1970s?
So,
um,
this plenty of pros about it.

1196
01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:20.380
You know,
I think if you're in a fucked up relationship and you sober up,

1197
01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:24.940
that'll help you,
you know,
I think,
uh,

1198
01:15:24.941 --> 01:15:29.941
I think a lot of people kind of use booze as a way to sort of medicate their way

1199
01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.760
through the year,
you know,

1200
01:15:33.761 --> 01:15:36.790
and not address shit that's really pissing them off and stuff.
I don't know.

1201
01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.530
I don't know.
Makes you want to work out.

1202
01:15:38.531 --> 01:15:41.620
It makes you want to change other stuff in your life where,
uh,

1203
01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:45.250
and actually go out and do things.
Another thing to see,

1204
01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.890
now I'm talking about going to cities.

1205
01:15:47.891 --> 01:15:51.550
I want to go to cool places to eat and that type of stuff and uh,
rather than,

1206
01:15:51.551 --> 01:15:52.990
you know,
where are the bars at?

1207
01:15:52.991 --> 01:15:55.630
So I can do what I've already done for the last 25 fucking years.

1208
01:15:55.631 --> 01:15:58.450
So there you go.
Those are the pros.
Um,

1209
01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:01.720
I'm not saying you've got to quit it for good unless you're a full on alcoholic.

1210
01:16:01.721 --> 01:16:06.640
Obviously I would quit it for good,
but if,
uh,
you know,

1211
01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.980
if he just getting that big Ted Kennedy had,

1212
01:16:09.010 --> 01:16:13.990
it's great to take a fucking month off.
You know?
I don't know.
That's it.

1213
01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:15.431
I don't know about you guys,

1214
01:16:15.431 --> 01:16:18.940
but I've just been boring the living shit out of myself this week.
All right,

1215
01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:21.130
let's get to underrated.
Overrated.
All right,
this is,

1216
01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:25.780
this is going to cause some fucking emails.
All right.
Overrated.
Reverse racism.

1217
01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:32.050
I love how white men tell minorities to quit whining about how unfair things

1218
01:16:32.051 --> 01:16:36.550
are,
but the second day become victims of racism.
All you hear is,

1219
01:16:36.551 --> 01:16:40.210
I can't insert complaint because I'm white.

1220
01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:45.760
Uh,
take some of your own advice.
Take some of your own advice.

1221
01:16:45.761 --> 01:16:48.030
You fucking hypocrite.
Could I have butchered that anymore?

1222
01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:50.410
Let me go back and read that.
Reverse racism.

1223
01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:54.310
I love how white men tell minorities to quit whining about how unfair things
are.

1224
01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.280
But the second they become victims of racism,
all you hear is,

1225
01:16:57.310 --> 01:17:02.230
I can't insert complaint because I'm white.
Take some of your own advice.

1226
01:17:02.231 --> 01:17:04.630
You fucking hypocrite.
There's the reed.

1227
01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:11.330
I fucking love that one.
I 100% agree with that one.
I,

1228
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:16.100
it's embarrassing when I hear white guys,
specifically white guys,

1229
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:17.833
you know,

1230
01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.020
white women still complained because that's what women do have all colors.

1231
01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:24.650
They just fucking bitch.
They're going to bitch about something.
You know,

1232
01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:27.830
take them to the restaurant that they've always wanted to go to.

1233
01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:32.870
You take them there and what happens?
Why do we have this thing over here?

1234
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:37.370
Right?
Bitch about the table.
It's cold.
I like it,

1235
01:17:37.371 --> 01:17:41.480
but it's cold.
Do you have the fucking Blah,
blah,
blah?

1236
01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:44.990
Do you have that special?
And they take it off the menu,
that and then they pout.

1237
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:47.750
And what do you want to do?
You,

1238
01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:52.370
you want to fucking take the check when it comes and stuff it down the back of

1239
01:17:52.371 --> 01:17:52.881
their throat.

1240
01:17:52.881 --> 01:17:56.870
Like that creepy moth that Hannibal lectors or that have that one fucking dude

1241
01:17:56.871 --> 01:18:00.020
you sit through and in that movie that I can't remember the name of Jesus
Christ,

1242
01:18:00.021 --> 01:18:04.580
his podcast sucks.
Uh,
yeah,

1243
01:18:04.581 --> 01:18:07.940
I really,
I,
you know,
I really can't like listen to,

1244
01:18:07.941 --> 01:18:12.350
to white people bitch about a white guys bitch about,
you know,

1245
01:18:12.351 --> 01:18:15.410
like affirmative action when they bitch about that type of shit.

1246
01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:19.220
All I can say is if you can't keep your fucking head above the line,

1247
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.780
you know,
come on
really

1248
01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:28.280
if you fall,
you know,
do you know bunch,

1249
01:18:28.281 --> 01:18:32.480
you have to be fucking up as a white dude to get under that fucking line.

1250
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:37.370
Like say colleges when they have that affirmative action thing.
So then somebody,

1251
01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:40.580
uh,
gets the same scores of view but they're not white,

1252
01:18:40.581 --> 01:18:44.210
so they fucking get in and you're going to sit there and Bitch Moaning Cup.

1253
01:18:44.211 --> 01:18:48.110
Come on.
Seriously.
Come on you.
You got enough fucking advantages.

1254
01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.630
You fucked up on,
you got to take that one on the chin.

1255
01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:54.800
That's how I view it and so I'm going to support that one cause I know it's also

1256
01:18:54.801 --> 01:18:57.440
going to bring a bunch of fucking emails so we can talk about race on the

1257
01:18:57.441 --> 01:19:02.060
podcast.
Something I would love to do.
All right.
Underrated.
Michael Vick.

1258
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:07.610
Love him or hate him.
He's the best QB in the league right now.
Classic,

1259
01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:12.290
classic,
classic.
You see that right there.

1260
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:15.960
There you go.
This is what this is.

1261
01:19:15.970 --> 01:19:19.520
That is the ESPN way of looking at football.

1262
01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:23.370
Did you watch Michael Vick last week against the hapless fucking Washington red

1263
01:19:23.371 --> 01:19:25.340
skins and their awful defense?

1264
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:29.690
You would've thought Jesus Christ himself was playing fucking quarterback.

1265
01:19:29.691 --> 01:19:30.770
They would.
They could.

1266
01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:34.920
They say this is one of the most you're baking cake type every gig.
Michael Vick,

1267
01:19:34.921 --> 01:19:35.240
he,

1268
01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:40.240
Michael and Michael Vick jeep one fucking game in the middle of November and

1269
01:19:42.441 --> 01:19:43.530
this guy is suddenly,

1270
01:19:43.531 --> 01:19:47.570
he suddenly catapults fucking Tom Brady.

1271
01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:52.780
Peyton manning is as far as like all their accomplishments,

1272
01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.170
all the things that they've done.

1273
01:19:57.710 --> 01:20:01.040
He casts like two to two or three good fucking gains are right now.

1274
01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:06.110
He is the best QB and the fucking league.
Jesus fucking Christ.

1275
01:20:07.530 --> 01:20:10.440
It's just,
it just fucking unreal.
I get it.

1276
01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:14.460
He's the fastest fucking guy in the NFL.
You can't fucking tackle the guy.

1277
01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.151
I get it.

1278
01:20:15.151 --> 01:20:18.810
He stayed in the pocket now and he's actually doing what a quarterback is

1279
01:20:18.811 --> 01:20:22.140
supposed to be doing.
You know when the first guy is an open,

1280
01:20:22.141 --> 01:20:24.870
he doesn't take off and run anymore.
He looks for the second or third,

1281
01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:28.440
third guy open.
I get that shit.
All right.

1282
01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:33.510
And I'm not saying like somebody asked me last week when he was doing what he

1283
01:20:33.511 --> 01:20:35.190
did against the Redskins.
He said,

1284
01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:39.150
do you think this makes Michael Vick the best quarterback in the league?
I said,

1285
01:20:39.151 --> 01:20:42.570
look,
if he does what he did tonight against the fucking red skins,

1286
01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:44.910
like three weeks in a row,

1287
01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:50.060
he becomes without a doubt shoulder to shoulder with the best qbs in the fucking

1288
01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:55.110
league.
Okay.
But she got to win in January.

1289
01:20:55.710 --> 01:20:58.320
You got to lead your team and the fucking playoffs.
I'll rest.

1290
01:20:58.330 --> 01:21:01.800
It doesn't mean shit.
I mean,
yeah,
it's amazing.
The guy's fucking,

1291
01:21:01.801 --> 01:21:06.120
he's most athletic dude I have ever seen.
He's got an unbelievable army.

1292
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:07.680
He has all the,
I'll tell you this,

1293
01:21:07.770 --> 01:21:12.770
he has all the fucking tools to become the greatest fucking QB of all time.

1294
01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:13.470
If,
if,

1295
01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:17.970
if he actually starts to play the position where he stays in the pocket and does

1296
01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:19.860
that without a fucking doubt.
But no,

1297
01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:24.040
he's not the best QB and the fucking league right now.
He,

1298
01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:28.170
he's not,
he's the most fucking amazing to watch.

1299
01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:32.400
I don't this,
this is,
okay.

1300
01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:36.150
This gets back to me when people think I hate the fucking jets.

1301
01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:37.410
This is what I hate.

1302
01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:41.220
I hate people who get crown king before they take the fucking crowd.

1303
01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:44.430
That's what I can't stand.
That's why I went off on Peyton last week.

1304
01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:46.590
That's why I'm going off on the jets this year.

1305
01:21:46.650 --> 01:21:48.750
You guys listened to his podcast for three fucking years.

1306
01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:50.640
I've made fun of the jets and that type of shit,

1307
01:21:50.641 --> 01:21:52.350
but it hasn't been like this year.

1308
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:58.260
And the reason was was because that hard knock shit talk and that they did was

1309
01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:02.550
the most over the top disrespectful fucking thing I've seen in.

1310
01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:05.910
So God did it fucking Rex Ryan.
Yeah,

1311
01:22:05.911 --> 01:22:09.180
we'll go undefeated in September when and kicked the fuck out and then we'll

1312
01:22:09.181 --> 01:22:11.570
kick the shit out of those fucking day fucking guy.

1313
01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.790
And everybody's talking about how confident,
confident that guy was.

1314
01:22:15.570 --> 01:22:19.950
And I called him out on it and you know what?
I was fucking right.
I was right.

1315
01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:23.310
They weren't that fucking good.
And they still aren't that fucking good.

1316
01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:27.630
They are winning games at the last second.
They lost their first fucking game.

1317
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:30.120
They lost to the ravens and they lost to the packers.

1318
01:22:30.210 --> 01:22:33.330
They've yet to play the colts.
Which a,
they're not really that good this year,

1319
01:22:33.390 --> 01:22:35.160
but they haven't played the fucking Steelers.

1320
01:22:35.161 --> 01:22:38.430
They haven't blown anybody away other than the fucking patriots.
What?

1321
01:22:38.431 --> 01:22:43.050
They're awful fucking defense.
So where do you get off talking?
All this shit.

1322
01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:47.520
That's why I'm giving him shit.
Okay.
I really don't give a fuck.

1323
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:51.510
You know,
I give a fuck this year if they win the Superbowl,
but I don't get,

1324
01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:53.760
I don't wish that fucking misery on jets fan.

1325
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:56.520
Do you really think I want you guys to go your whole lifetime and never win a

1326
01:22:56.521 --> 01:22:59.820
championship?
I don't.
I don't.
All right,

1327
01:22:59.910 --> 01:23:03.750
but this year I don't want you to,
because you talked to all that.

1328
01:23:03.751 --> 01:23:06.520
You guys didn't talk all that Shit because Rex Ryan talked all that shit.

1329
01:23:06.521 --> 01:23:10.090
That's all this shit is about.
All right.
But other than that,
I don't give a fuck.

1330
01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:14.950
It's fun that they're good.
It's not fun when they suck.

1331
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:18.610
That game against the culture yesterday wasn't fun because what's his cross?

1332
01:23:18.611 --> 01:23:21.490
Because Peyton Manning,
he didn't have all these guys.
It's not,

1333
01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:25.030
you know what I mean?
It'd be like beating the Yankees.
If a while,
Jesus,

1334
01:23:25.031 --> 01:23:27.610
their whole fucking team would have to go down the amount of fucking free agents

1335
01:23:27.611 --> 01:23:31.540
they sign.
Um,
it'd be like beaten.
Uh,
I dunno.

1336
01:23:32.170 --> 01:23:35.660
I Dunno what the fuck you,
you know what the fuck I'm saying?
All right,
so don't,

1337
01:23:35.661 --> 01:23:37.780
don't get like this whole thing,
you know,
switch.
I know.

1338
01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:40.300
I'd say over the top shit,
but I'm just trying to be funny here.
Right.

1339
01:23:40.301 --> 01:23:43.540
So all you kids who had taken this shit way too fucking seriously.

1340
01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:47.260
Speaking of which,
I got some audio,
few guys said,

1341
01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:52.560
one of my great listeners sent into me and I absolutely love this fucking audio,

1342
01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:59.250
but it's also embarrassing to me because this guy reminds me,

1343
01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.930
I hate how much I am just like this guy.

1344
01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:06.520
I hate that I give a fuck about sports as much as this guy.

1345
01:24:06.930 --> 01:24:11.440
Uh,
speaking of the eagles and the Redskins.
Okay.
And for my friends overseas,

1346
01:24:11.441 --> 01:24:16.180
either way,
uh,
uh,
there was a football game,

1347
01:24:16.210 --> 01:24:19.780
eagles played the Redskins in the eagles,
fucking rape the Redskins.
So this,

1348
01:24:19.781 --> 01:24:24.781
this radio host goes on the radio and has a 12 minute fucking meltdown

1349
01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:32.980
about all the shit he's had to endure as a Redskins fan,

1350
01:24:32.981 --> 01:24:36.760
which is kinda funny because they've won three super bowls in my lifetime.
So I,

1351
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.220
part of it is hilarious cause he goes,
you know,

1352
01:24:39.221 --> 01:24:44.221
it's been 10 years of this shit and I just would love to see him do that rant

1353
01:24:45.131 --> 01:24:47.140
and get to that that moment.

1354
01:24:47.141 --> 01:24:51.280
And say it's been 10 years of this shit and say that standing on in in the

1355
01:24:51.281 --> 01:24:53.260
middle of Wrigley field when it's packed,

1356
01:24:55.300 --> 01:25:00.210
it's been 10 years of this shit.
Oh,
you poor fucking baby.
Um,

1357
01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:04.240
but it's actually,
to be honest,
it's been longer than that because you know,

1358
01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:06.220
it's been going on like 20 years and once you get,

1359
01:25:06.221 --> 01:25:09.910
you can start getting up around 20 years.
It sucks as a fan.
Um,

1360
01:25:10.510 --> 01:25:13.930
just talk to the Canadian fans up there.
You know,
it's starting to suck up there,

1361
01:25:13.931 --> 01:25:16.840
isn't it?
You guys gotta be,
you guys gotta be happy.

1362
01:25:17.050 --> 01:25:20.290
The Canadians look really good this year.
They have a really solid fucking team.

1363
01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:24.820
But the fact that the Canadians haven't worn it since 1993 and so unbelievable

1364
01:25:24.821 --> 01:25:29.290
that franchises,
they've never gone this long.
And the history of that,

1365
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:30.370
of that franchise,

1366
01:25:30.371 --> 01:25:34.570
they've never gone anywhere near this long without winning a Stanley Cup.

1367
01:25:34.990 --> 01:25:36.520
Those fucking assholes,

1368
01:25:37.330 --> 01:25:42.330
I think right up until 1979 I think they had a better winning percentage then.

1369
01:25:45.551 --> 01:25:46.630
I think the Yankees,

1370
01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:52.270
I might be wrong on that now.
I think I'm Ah,

1371
01:25:53.290 --> 01:25:54.910
I might,
I think I'm right on that.

1372
01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:59.680
I think they were averaging winning one every fucking three one every three

1373
01:25:59.681 --> 01:26:04.280
years easily.
Ah,
fuck knows.
I'm bad at math.

1374
01:26:04.281 --> 01:26:07.970
But anyways,
so anyways,
this just go to the [inaudible] podcast.com.

1375
01:26:08.210 --> 01:26:11.180
This fucking rant is so funny and,
and first of all,

1376
01:26:11.181 --> 01:26:14.480
somebody sent the email and told me that this guy was going to go off and what

1377
01:26:14.481 --> 01:26:17.330
makes it so God damn funny is the way he starts the rant.

1378
01:26:17.331 --> 01:26:20.390
I thought it was just going to be some guy blowing a gasket,
but it starts,

1379
01:26:20.590 --> 01:26:22.820
he starts it so calmly.

1380
01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:27.320
He just starts off saying something to the effect of,
you know,

1381
01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:33.260
my grandfather was a Redskins fan.

1382
01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:40.190
He used to watch Sammy Blah.
He goes through his day.

1383
01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:44.270
He literally did background.
My Dad was a Redskins fan.

1384
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:49.250
I've been a redskin fans.
I probably spent in my lifetime probably,
I dunno,

1385
01:26:49.630 --> 01:26:54.630
seven or $8,000 on throwback jerseys and Redskins merchandise.

1386
01:26:54.981 --> 01:26:59.900
He lays the fuck and groundwork.
He gives you the fucking backstory.

1387
01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:03.770
And then he just launches into this thing and I got to MIT,
man,

1388
01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:04.700
I got 10 minutes into it.

1389
01:27:04.701 --> 01:27:08.780
I just shut it off because I was so embarrassed that I have,

1390
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:13.130
I've blown a gasket like this guy.
I mean,

1391
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:16.280
he gets like seven minutes into it and I'm like talking to the guy like,
dude,

1392
01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:19.850
it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter this much.
Just let it go.

1393
01:27:20.150 --> 01:27:21.740
And it's actually really funny except for this,

1394
01:27:21.741 --> 01:27:25.460
this guy in the background keeps going,
kid him kid who

1395
01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:30.380
Kitab and it really gets fucking annoying.
Other than that,

1396
01:27:30.381 --> 01:27:34.820
it's fucking hilarious.
Um,
all right,
52 minutes and let,
let's,

1397
01:27:34.821 --> 01:27:39.140
let's move on here.
All right,
this,
this fucking segment has really taken off.

1398
01:27:39.141 --> 01:27:44.030
I'm loving this one.
This segment is best line in a bad movie.

1399
01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:49.670
Uh,
and this week's video,
which is up on the Mlm,
podcast.com.

1400
01:27:49.671 --> 01:27:50.750
You got to watch this one.

1401
01:27:50.751 --> 01:27:54.260
Please do not have any food in your mouth when you watch this because you will

1402
01:27:54.261 --> 01:27:57.530
spit it all over.
A loved one.
Um,
watched the video.

1403
01:27:57.531 --> 01:28:00.910
Steven Seagal blood bank.
Uh,

1404
01:28:00.970 --> 01:28:03.050
just fucking awesome.

1405
01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:07.550
I really want to just go out one night and just rent five of the worst fucking

1406
01:28:07.551 --> 01:28:08.384
movies ever.

1407
01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:12.500
And just sit there and watch it with a couple of people that can appreciate it

1408
01:28:12.501 --> 01:28:15.770
because some of the lines of these fucking movies are incredible.
Please,

1409
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:21.050
please keep sending me these videos because it's just making a nice long list of

1410
01:28:21.051 --> 01:28:25.970
movies that I have to sit down and watch.
Um,
you know,

1411
01:28:25.971 --> 01:28:28.430
is great for that,
by the way,
to you guys,

1412
01:28:28.431 --> 01:28:31.700
for fans at 30 rock and only get a name,
a name here,

1413
01:28:31.701 --> 01:28:33.770
cause this is something positive.
Uh,

1414
01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:38.800
Judah Freelander is an encyclopedia of knowledge on movies in general,

1415
01:28:41.871 --> 01:28:45.530
but forget about bad movies.
And if I remember correctly,

1416
01:28:45.531 --> 01:28:50.130
he actually collects them.
And,
uh,
I have to,
you know what?
I got to go,

1417
01:28:50.170 --> 01:28:55.070
I'm going to have him as a guest on this show and before he comes on,
um,

1418
01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:59.660
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna ask for his top five worst movies,

1419
01:28:59.661 --> 01:29:02.160
best worst movies of all time.
And I'm telling you,

1420
01:29:02.161 --> 01:29:07.161
he can break these movies down like Siskel and Ebert back in the fucking day as

1421
01:29:07.831 --> 01:29:12.630
to why their grit,
not why,
not only they're awful,
but they're also great.

1422
01:29:12.631 --> 01:29:13.181
Like he's a,

1423
01:29:13.181 --> 01:29:16.620
this is what one of the many things I miss about living in New York was running

1424
01:29:16.621 --> 01:29:19.320
into him and I would always bring up,
you know,

1425
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:21.750
it all started one time I was,

1426
01:29:21.751 --> 01:29:25.680
I was hanging out at the comedy cellar and he was down there and I was trying to

1427
01:29:25.681 --> 01:29:30.150
remember this name of this Steven Seagal movie.
And I was like,
I was like,
dude,

1428
01:29:30.151 --> 01:29:33.870
what was the name of that movie?
Uh,
Steven Seagal had his,

1429
01:29:33.871 --> 01:29:37.910
one of his earlier ones.
And uh,
he,

1430
01:29:37.911 --> 01:29:38.880
he fought all those,

1431
01:29:38.881 --> 01:29:43.650
those fucking Bob Marley looking dudes and he just goes,

1432
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:48.360
without even missing a beat.
He just goes marked for death.
Great movie.

1433
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:50.550
And I go,
what was the plot of that?

1434
01:29:50.551 --> 01:29:55.551
He goes to plot of that movie is basically Steven Seagal beats up Jamaica.

1435
01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:01.350
I'm butcher and all this shit.
He said in a much funnier your way.
And then he,

1436
01:30:01.410 --> 01:30:04.410
then he broke down.
Why that movie was great.

1437
01:30:04.411 --> 01:30:08.760
And it basically came down to who said that movie introduced the breaking of

1438
01:30:08.761 --> 01:30:13.330
bones in martial art movies according to him or,

1439
01:30:13.331 --> 01:30:16.080
or took it to just an entirely different level.
And I'm telling you,

1440
01:30:16.081 --> 01:30:19.010
if you watch marked for death and you're squeamish,
uh,

1441
01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:22.980
that's not a movie to watch because I've never seen so many compound fractures.

1442
01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:26.030
Is that the compound fracture?
Is that the one where it,

1443
01:30:26.031 --> 01:30:29.450
it comes out through the skin?
That's the one I'm talking about.
All right.

1444
01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:32.070
And once again,
I start talking and I get in over my head.

1445
01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:37.020
This has been the easy listening podcast.
Um,
all right,
here we go.
Uh,

1446
01:30:37.021 --> 01:30:38.370
youtube videos for the week.

1447
01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:42.090
I can't remember if I put this one up last week,

1448
01:30:42.091 --> 01:30:46.080
but I'll look up the car.
James Brolin.
It's a,
uh,

1449
01:30:46.110 --> 01:30:49.470
one of the worst and hilarious trailers I've ever seen in my life.

1450
01:30:49.471 --> 01:30:51.420
This is another movie that I have to see.

1451
01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:56.010
A white line fever is another one.

1452
01:30:56.011 --> 01:31:00.300
Those are two bad movie trailers.
Um,
angry birds,

1453
01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:03.750
peace treaty
and a,

1454
01:31:03.751 --> 01:31:06.810
and here's another segment I'm going to introduce if you guys have all time

1455
01:31:06.811 --> 01:31:10.920
favorite classic youtube videos.
All right.

1456
01:31:10.921 --> 01:31:12.150
Look up food fight

1457
01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:16.920
and try to guess which wars that they're talking about.

1458
01:31:17.130 --> 01:31:19.860
I'm a more on the first time I watched it and just thought it was funny because

1459
01:31:19.861 --> 01:31:23.670
it was food blowing each other up.
And then I really started to see the,
uh,

1460
01:31:24.630 --> 01:31:29.100
the metaphors or was it the similes I never simile is using like her abs.

1461
01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:35.640
Well then they would have to say America is a cheeseburger.
That's a metaphor.

1462
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:39.530
Assembly would be,
America is like a cheeseburger are at,

1463
01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:42.560
you'll understand it when you watch the video if you haven't seen it yet.
And uh,

1464
01:31:42.570 --> 01:31:47.520
as far as drummers goes this week,
this is another Stuart Copeland one,

1465
01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:50.970
and this is a band that I meant to get into.
And I don't know what happened.

1466
01:31:50.971 --> 01:31:54.240
I got so busy,
but,
uh,
oysterhead,
uh,

1467
01:31:54.241 --> 01:31:59.241
watch the Youtube Video Oz is ever floating as a performance that they did on

1468
01:31:59.591 --> 01:32:03.040
Conan O'brien.
And the band was Stewart Copeland on drums.

1469
01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:08.410
Um,
what's his face?
I just went,

1470
01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:13.390
I just spaced on his fucking name.
Trey,
uh,

1471
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:16.060
the guy from fish,

1472
01:32:18.710 --> 01:32:22.600
I forget his fucking name and a stage.
Yo,
I was never a big fish fan.

1473
01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:25.180
Um,
I think they're awesome,

1474
01:32:25.181 --> 01:32:30.160
but I just can't listen to fucking 58 minutes songs and a on base was les

1475
01:32:30.161 --> 01:32:33.160
Claypool.
That was the band and they're fucking awesome.

1476
01:32:33.190 --> 01:32:36.250
And I'm going to download some of this shit.
All right.
And with that,

1477
01:32:36.251 --> 01:32:38.700
I think all the only thing we have left,
I'm going to end with advice,

1478
01:32:38.710 --> 01:32:40.330
which really seems to be the way that we end.

1479
01:32:40.331 --> 01:32:43.330
Do I have time for a couple of quick questions?
I don't think I do.
All right,

1480
01:32:43.331 --> 01:32:46.810
let's get to the advice for the week.
All right.
Question Bill.

1481
01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:51.280
Being a frequent flyer,
don't you uh,

1482
01:32:51.310 --> 01:32:55.690
think this controversy over the new body scanners is fucking bullshit.

1483
01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:59.770
Uh,
a guy hit a bomb in his fucking underwear.

1484
01:32:59.830 --> 01:33:04.830
What exactly do these complaining bastards expect us to scale back on security?

1485
01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:10.860
We have become so pampered and used to the utmost comfort that we are doing the

1486
01:33:11.531 --> 01:33:13.180
terrorist's job for them.

1487
01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:17.020
Who gives a fuck if someone is seeing your cock or your tits,

1488
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:20.680
he or she is seeing hundreds a day.
Uh,

1489
01:33:20.681 --> 01:33:24.400
you sir are a fucking moron.
All right?

1490
01:33:24.401 --> 01:33:26.170
If you go through airport security,

1491
01:33:26.171 --> 01:33:31.171
I dunno if you've noticed they're not exactly the fucking navy seals,

1492
01:33:32.110 --> 01:33:34.720
although they have gotten better in the last couple of years,
but they don't,

1493
01:33:34.721 --> 01:33:38.230
you know,
they're always shooting the shit.
They're always fucking around.

1494
01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:40.990
They're not really paying attention.

1495
01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:44.450
It doesn't really look like it's a high paying fucking job.
Alright,

1496
01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:48.970
let's go with that.
All right,
let's go with secondly,
uh,
a body scanner,

1497
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.110
entire body scan.

1498
01:33:50.111 --> 01:33:53.560
Let's get over the fact that you don't want a naked picture of yourself,

1499
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:58.360
which is,
you're fucking right to not want that,
by the way.
All right?

1500
01:33:58.750 --> 01:34:00.550
Secondly,
I don't know about you,

1501
01:34:00.551 --> 01:34:03.610
but I fly every other weekend and when I go on benders like this,

1502
01:34:03.611 --> 01:34:05.730
at the end of the year,
cause I owe the bank are concerned,

1503
01:34:05.731 --> 01:34:08.950
the fucking government,
a bunch of money.
I go on like,
you know,

1504
01:34:09.070 --> 01:34:12.430
four or five weeks in row,
I fly.
All right?

1505
01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:17.250
So I got to get a full bond body scan,
uh,

1506
01:34:17.290 --> 01:34:19.090
on the way out and the way back.

1507
01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:22.661
You know,

1508
01:34:22.661 --> 01:34:25.720
I really have to start checking to see that I'm not going to be completely

1509
01:34:25.721 --> 01:34:29.680
filled up with memory on this fucking Olympus ls 10.

1510
01:34:29.710 --> 01:34:31.960
They have the God damn time right there.
I apologize.

1511
01:34:31.961 --> 01:34:35.350
Let me get back to what the fuck I was talking about.
Um,

1512
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:37.780
yeah,
so,

1513
01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:41.320
so you're basically saying that I shouldn't complain that like six weeks in a

1514
01:34:41.321 --> 01:34:46.321
fucking row and a total of 12 times I'm going to take radiation from head to

1515
01:34:47.651 --> 01:34:51.400
fucking toe.
All right.
And don't even tell me,
oh,

1516
01:34:51.401 --> 01:34:55.780
it's only for fucking second to when you go to get your fucking,
you know,

1517
01:34:56.320 --> 01:35:00.710
teeth rayed they put that leather fucking,

1518
01:35:00.711 --> 01:35:04.640
that led vest leather,
that led vest over all your fucking Oregon's.

1519
01:35:04.641 --> 01:35:07.040
And then they go lay leave the fucking room.

1520
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:12.020
And I was supposed to stand there like I met a Jay z concert and I'm getting

1521
01:35:12.021 --> 01:35:16.430
frisky at the same time with my fucking legs spread and doing that Jay z thing

1522
01:35:16.431 --> 01:35:20.990
over my head.
And they're going to know,
fuck that this cancer in my family,

1523
01:35:20.991 --> 01:35:23.120
I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it,
pat me down.

1524
01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:26.210
So that's why I did the one on the,
on the way out.
I was like,
yeah,

1525
01:35:26.211 --> 01:35:30.420
I'm not doing that thing.
And I said to pat me down,
so then you know,

1526
01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:34.040
they did it and they said,
and they came up to me and this guy said,

1527
01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:38.020
I have to patch it down.
Uh,
are,
are there any parts of your body that are,
uh,

1528
01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:42.440
that are,
that are sensitive?
And I wanted to be like,
well,

1529
01:35:42.441 --> 01:35:45.320
I'm thinking all of us have areas of our body that are sensitive

1530
01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:51.440
to creep them out.
That was basically like,
no,
dad grabbed my balls.

1531
01:35:51.441 --> 01:35:54.590
I don't give a fuck.
Right.
I didn't know what he was going to do.
Right.

1532
01:35:54.591 --> 01:35:58.700
So he's puts on his dishwashing gloves and starts patting me down and they don't

1533
01:35:58.701 --> 01:35:59.481
grab your balls.

1534
01:35:59.481 --> 01:36:04.400
What they do is they go way up your inner thigh and he gives you your ball bag.

1535
01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:08.660
A little bit of backhand on each side of the ball bag,
you know,
so,

1536
01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:13.940
and I got to admit,
it made me laugh a little bit.
Yeah.

1537
01:36:13.941 --> 01:36:16.520
I don't give a fuck.
Yeah,
go fuck yourself.
Yeah.

1538
01:36:16.521 --> 01:36:20.120
You're not taking a fucking head to toe naked fucking picture of me as you,

1539
01:36:20.121 --> 01:36:22.430
as you know.
You're not,

1540
01:36:22.431 --> 01:36:25.760
you're not fucking radiate in my entire body so I can get on a fucking puddle

1541
01:36:25.761 --> 01:36:29.030
jumper to go to Hartford.
I'm not doing that.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1542
01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:34.250
Jesus Christ,
lazy motherfuckers.

1543
01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:41.330
You know
what people forget.
I,
so I don't get it.
You know what I mean?
This,

1544
01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:43.130
this is what I understand that they're,
you know,

1545
01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:45.680
quote unquote trying to keep me safe.

1546
01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:48.680
But what I don't understand is that people don't understand that during those

1547
01:36:48.681 --> 01:36:51.980
times of fear,
and let's try to keep you safe.

1548
01:36:52.190 --> 01:36:57.190
The amount of fucking like privileged that you lose and you never fucking get it

1549
01:36:58.071 --> 01:37:01.760
back.
And they always take a little more than they should.

1550
01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:04.940
That's why it's great that people bitch.

1551
01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:08.600
And it's great that you can bitch because if you bitched like this in China,

1552
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:12.050
they'd probably put you to death and then harvest.
You're fucking Oregon's.

1553
01:37:13.290 --> 01:37:14.660
All right.
So yeah,

1554
01:37:14.690 --> 01:37:18.560
I think it's fine with the amount of fucking cancer that's out there and that

1555
01:37:18.561 --> 01:37:21.440
people fucking talking to cell phones all the God damn time.

1556
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:24.720
You don't want to end it.
You know,
you don't want to add to it.

1557
01:37:24.721 --> 01:37:28.070
W with head to toe,
fucking Zappa,
fucking radiation.

1558
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:32.690
You know,
I'm,
I'm standing there,
I don't have my fucking shoes on.

1559
01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:37.430
I'm stripped down to a fucking tee shirt.
I got jeans on and Shit.

1560
01:37:37.431 --> 01:37:40.700
I don't have anything on me,
you know,

1561
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:44.570
and there's all this fucking flipping out about the fucking airplanes.

1562
01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:46.040
What about trains?

1563
01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:50.750
You could literally have a box that said,

1564
01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:54.560
I have dynamite on the side of it and you could see the fucking conductor would

1565
01:37:54.561 --> 01:37:58.350
help you it on.
There's no metal detectors.
There's no nothing.

1566
01:37:58.351 --> 01:38:00.420
Despite the fact that 15 years ago,

1567
01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:04.050
that guy got on the long island railroad railroad and shut that shut the whole

1568
01:38:04.051 --> 01:38:07.470
fucking thing up.
So I don't like that.

1569
01:38:07.471 --> 01:38:12.120
I don't like that whole fucking ice skate scan my retina shit.
No,

1570
01:38:12.150 --> 01:38:16.560
go fuck yourself.
I'm not doing that.
And um,
it's,
you're right dude,

1571
01:38:16.561 --> 01:38:20.820
if you have no problem with it,
you know,
good luck with your testicular.

1572
01:38:20.821 --> 01:38:25.821
Slash brain slash tongue slash throat slash big toe cancer if you fly all the

1573
01:38:27.961 --> 01:38:30.540
fucking time.
Like a lot of people,
I'm not doing that shit.

1574
01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:36.120
I'm not fucking doing it.
That's a,
they have fucked dead,

1575
01:38:37.530 --> 01:38:40.530
you know,
and you're acting like before this shit went down,

1576
01:38:40.531 --> 01:38:44.160
they haven't been keeping us safe.
You know,

1577
01:38:45.690 --> 01:38:49.050
they have been says nine 11.
Knock on wood,

1578
01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:51.690
nothing has fucking happened before.

1579
01:38:51.691 --> 01:38:55.680
Those stupid body scan is nothing has fucking happened.
All right,

1580
01:38:55.980 --> 01:39:00.360
we'll find everything is fucking fine.
You don't need those God damn things.

1581
01:39:01.290 --> 01:39:04.890
You know what's funny is if next week somebody actually does something,

1582
01:39:05.070 --> 01:39:09.180
the conspiracy theorists are going to say that the government did it because

1583
01:39:09.210 --> 01:39:13.470
people were refusing those body scanners.
All right?

1584
01:39:13.471 --> 01:39:16.080
That's just my opinion,
man.
I seriously,
you know,

1585
01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:18.810
I'm not trying to get head to toe radiation.

1586
01:39:18.811 --> 01:39:23.010
I get that they're trying to fucking keep me safe.
But you know,

1587
01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:25.560
if they truly wanted to keep me fucking safe,

1588
01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:29.190
they wouldn't be shooting the shit and joking the amount of fucking times that

1589
01:39:29.191 --> 01:39:33.690
they are when I'm going through.
All right,
and that happens a lot.

1590
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:34.650
Specifically,

1591
01:39:34.651 --> 01:39:39.150
it's the person who's looking at the TV screen is talking about whatever and his

1592
01:39:39.151 --> 01:39:40.230
joking and laughing,

1593
01:39:40.231 --> 01:39:44.730
which you're going to do because they have an unbelievably boring fucking job.

1594
01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:48.540
I would be doing the same goddamn thing,
but if they truly gave a fuck,

1595
01:39:50.370 --> 01:39:54.630
they would spend a lot more money on the people that they get to do the security

1596
01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:59.180
rather than these new fangled fucking goddamn machines.

1597
01:39:59.190 --> 01:40:03.870
I'm not going through those.
Pat me Down,
give,
give my fucking my ball bag.

1598
01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:07.560
A couple of backhands with the dishwashing gloves.
I don't give a fuck,

1599
01:40:07.561 --> 01:40:08.760
but I'm not going to stand there.

1600
01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:11.940
Spread Eagle and end up with cancer or the taint.

1601
01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:17.400
All right.
But you know,
you guys want to do it.
Go ahead and do it.

1602
01:40:17.401 --> 01:40:18.240
I don't give a fuck,

1603
01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:22.080
but I hope enough of you say no so it doesn't become mandatory.

1604
01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:26.730
All right,
that's it.
All right,
let's get with the advice here.
All right.
Hey,

1605
01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:29.610
hey the Ed bill.
Uh,
I need your thoughts in this situation.

1606
01:40:29.611 --> 01:40:33.830
This girl I hooked up with was a freak.
Um,

1607
01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:37.440
I never banged her.
I just fingered her and got her off and she blew me.

1608
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:41.400
Her ass was huge.
It was amazing.
She texted,

1609
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:45.870
she texted me the next day and saying how amazing it was and how crazy she got

1610
01:40:45.871 --> 01:40:49.900
off and loved it.
I thought the next date,
our third was going to be the,
uh,

1611
01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.170
a fun sex fest.
No doubt about it.

1612
01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:55.660
But I don't know where she said she didn't want to do this anymore.

1613
01:40:55.810 --> 01:40:58.780
She was moving down to Irvine,
leaving her old apartment.

1614
01:40:58.781 --> 01:41:03.160
That was just a few miles from me and she said we wouldn't ever hang out again.

1615
01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:07.300
So she didn't stay in touch.
Uh,
the one time she,

1616
01:41:07.570 --> 01:41:10.840
she was meeting up with friends and Santa Monica,
my neck of the woods.

1617
01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:15.240
We texted back and forth and by the end of the night she flaked again.
Well,

1618
01:41:15.250 --> 01:41:18.550
wait a minute,
you said she's not keeping in touch.
I guess when she left,

1619
01:41:18.551 --> 01:41:21.760
she didn't keep in touch,
but then she texted you when she came back to town.

1620
01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:25.180
I'm going to have to assume that because I can't talk to you.
All right.

1621
01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:28.150
Said you're going to meet it the other night and then she flaked again.

1622
01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:31.240
She said she liked to rendezvous,
but of course she never did.

1623
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:34.570
Then she asked me why I'm obsessed with seeing her.

1624
01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:38.140
I told her the truth that I had a fun time with her and we both had a blast and

1625
01:41:38.141 --> 01:41:42.370
she clearly got off and I figured we could continue this good thing we got
going.

1626
01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:44.020
I didn't directly say I want to fuck her,

1627
01:41:44.021 --> 01:41:47.050
but the point probably came across in the texting.
Uh,

1628
01:41:47.051 --> 01:41:48.710
I'm straightforward with woman bill.
I'm,

1629
01:41:48.711 --> 01:41:53.711
I'm also aware of how this girl's Ben and he left out a few words.

1630
01:41:54.011 --> 01:41:56.200
I'm assuming he's saying been messing with my brain.

1631
01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:00.790
I even told her I couldn't shake a rough,
I felt used,

1632
01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:03.640
but since we didn't fuck it wasn't a good use,

1633
01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:08.110
the mission wasn't complete hot sex on a platter and makes the mission and,
uh,

1634
01:42:08.170 --> 01:42:12.770
makes the,
makes the mission complete.
Jesus,
uh,

1635
01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:16.120
we don't talk anymore.
I haven't seen her and I'm bummed I never banged her.

1636
01:42:16.121 --> 01:42:19.660
I was hoping you might have some insight as to why she suddenly stopped seeing

1637
01:42:19.661 --> 01:42:21.460
me.
She wasn't faking it.

1638
01:42:21.461 --> 01:42:24.860
She was really digging me and suddenly she halted the whole operation before I

1639
01:42:24.861 --> 01:42:28.450
could banger what gives me help me out.
Please give me some insight.

1640
01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:29.410
All right dude.
Well,

1641
01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:35.440
I don't know are an eye so I can't really break it down that much.

1642
01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:40.120
Uh,
there's a number of reasons why she,
she could have done it all right.

1643
01:42:40.121 --> 01:42:42.340
He said the girl was a freak.
Look,

1644
01:42:42.341 --> 01:42:47.341
the fact that all she did was bang you and you're now Jones and four and you're

1645
01:42:48.521 --> 01:42:52.090
saying that she's a freak and everything.
Um,

1646
01:42:52.810 --> 01:42:56.890
and then out of nowhere she said she didn't want to do this anymore is one or

1647
01:42:56.891 --> 01:43:01.600
two things.
That's either a,
one of those,

1648
01:43:01.601 --> 01:43:05.740
those girls who fancies themselves a femme fatale and they liked guy getting

1649
01:43:05.741 --> 01:43:10.300
guys all worked up and then just drop in you like a fucking hot potato,

1650
01:43:10.330 --> 01:43:13.990
you know?
Um,
just to fuck with your head.

1651
01:43:13.991 --> 01:43:17.650
There are girls out there that like doing that.
Um,

1652
01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:24.660
but if I had to guess because she actually blew you and did bring you to orgasm,

1653
01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:30.600
I would say that this sounds like a bad girl trying to reform herself or for

1654
01:43:32.081 --> 01:43:33.340
people who are more liberal.

1655
01:43:33.341 --> 01:43:38.341
This is a woman who's had her fun and she's realizing that when she begins a

1656
01:43:38.501 --> 01:43:43.120
relationship,
the way she did with you,
that,
uh,

1657
01:43:43.121 --> 01:43:48.040
that it doesn't go anywhere,
but she still loves to fuck and she's fighting that.

1658
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:51.010
So she moves.

1659
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:56.000
Maybe she banged so many guys in that area.
She needed us.
She needed a new start.

1660
01:43:56.810 --> 01:44:00.110
So she's down there and fucking San Diego or wherever the fuck she went and now

1661
01:44:00.111 --> 01:44:04.460
she's,
you know,
she's being that girl,
you know,
I used to fucking blah,
blah blah,

1662
01:44:04.461 --> 01:44:07.850
but now I don't,
you know,
maybe she's looking for a husband,

1663
01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:11.270
so maybe that's why she did it.
I have no fucking idea.

1664
01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:14.810
Maybe she's lonely down in San Diego.
She misses her friends.

1665
01:44:14.811 --> 01:44:16.610
She comes back and in a moment of weakness,

1666
01:44:16.611 --> 01:44:20.420
she texts you and then she starts crying to her friends.
Go and look at it.

1667
01:44:20.421 --> 01:44:22.070
I'm going to hook up with this guy.
I don't even like them.

1668
01:44:22.071 --> 01:44:24.830
And then they're just like going through thin.
Don't do it.

1669
01:44:24.831 --> 01:44:28.190
You don't have to do this.
You're doing so good right now.

1670
01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:31.250
You're not being a whore.
And then she leaves you hanging.

1671
01:44:31.251 --> 01:44:36.110
But I'll tell you this right now.
You got to let her go.
You got to let her go.

1672
01:44:36.170 --> 01:44:40.340
All right?
You got to be like,
when it comes to women,

1673
01:44:40.341 --> 01:44:44.300
if you're just out there and you want to fuck you gotta be like a relief
pitcher.

1674
01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:48.980
All right?
You serve up a fucking meatball and they knock it out of the park.

1675
01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:51.650
You can't be throwing your next pitch thinking about the last one.

1676
01:44:51.651 --> 01:44:54.170
You got to let the shit go start over again.

1677
01:44:54.171 --> 01:44:57.740
So right now you need to do is go out and find another fucking freak,

1678
01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:00.710
which you know,
if you're straight forward with women like you are,

1679
01:45:00.711 --> 01:45:01.760
you kind of find one.

1680
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:07.270
And if you really just take the time to try to break them down and see what

1681
01:45:07.341 --> 01:45:09.740
different kinds of women respond to,

1682
01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:13.340
you literally become like a fisherman and you know,

1683
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:17.420
whatever kind of woman you looking for,
that's the bait you're tossing out there.

1684
01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:21.110
All right.
If you look at,
for a wife,
for a serious girlfriend,

1685
01:45:21.230 --> 01:45:24.140
you don't go to a meat market.
You know,
join a softball league,

1686
01:45:24.650 --> 01:45:29.060
take a cooking class as something like that.
Go with a good girls are,
you know,

1687
01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:30.800
or if you do go out to the meat market,

1688
01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:34.340
look at the one who's actually watching her alcohol intake.

1689
01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:38.840
The one who seems to be the responsible one,
responsible a wife,

1690
01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:43.640
a mother to your children,
right?
One.
It doesn't have her stuff all hanging out,

1691
01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:48.170
but you know,
if you're looking for a who with,
you know,

1692
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:52.770
it's all kinds of places to go.
Actually,

1693
01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:56.390
the great thing about whores is they're everywhere.
That's what I love about him.

1694
01:45:57.020 --> 01:46:01.210
You know,
it's like bottled water.
You can pretty much get it wherever you go

1695
01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:05.990
now.
You know what I mean?
You've got the office whore,
you got the fucking,

1696
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:09.830
the horror at the gym,
you know the one that shows up in full makeup and fucking,

1697
01:46:09.831 --> 01:46:12.780
you know,
works out on level one on the stair master

1698
01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:17.810
looking over his shoulder to see who's checking her out.
Right?

1699
01:46:18.270 --> 01:46:22.480
But that girl is a fucking nightmare.
Even if she blows you,

1700
01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:24.080
you're going to have makeup all over your lap.

1701
01:46:27.870 --> 01:46:28.940
Here's the funny,

1702
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:32.310
I finally got to the funny a fucking hour and 10 minutes into the Goddamn

1703
01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:34.310
podcast.
Where was it all week?

1704
01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:39.880
You know what the reason why this podcast wasn't as funny as usual is because,

1705
01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:41.713
you know,

1706
01:46:42.650 --> 01:46:47.240
I was thinking about all the people who don't get to laugh in the world this

1707
01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:50.400
week.
You know this week when we're supposed to give thanks.

1708
01:46:51.890 --> 01:46:54.530
Hey England and Australia and Sweden,

1709
01:46:55.170 --> 01:46:58.380
I will throw in Denmark in that to what's up there?
Ireland?

1710
01:46:59.570 --> 01:47:04.400
Where do you say they're Madagascar?
Do you guys have any sort of weak like that?

1711
01:47:04.401 --> 01:47:07.420
We have a big feast.
What about the Irish?

1712
01:47:07.421 --> 01:47:09.100
You guys got to have some big thing that you know,

1713
01:47:09.130 --> 01:47:12.990
turns into some sort of drunken brawl.
Uh,
Jesus Christ.

1714
01:47:12.991 --> 01:47:14.570
Can you go with anymore Hacky Shit?
Eh,

1715
01:47:14.580 --> 01:47:17.430
let's go to Scotland and then you put your fucking skirts on,
right?

1716
01:47:18.270 --> 01:47:21.220
You're fucking scared of wearing coats.
Um,

1717
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.210
do you guys have any days like that bro?

1718
01:47:24.220 --> 01:47:28.270
You supposed to do was just sit down and eat and then there always has to be the

1719
01:47:28.270 --> 01:47:30.970
Debbie Downer who just sits there and starts talking about the less fortunate,

1720
01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:32.600
you know,

1721
01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:35.390
or one of these fucking celebrities who has to do a little public service

1722
01:47:35.391 --> 01:47:38.980
announcement.
You know,
Jane this week and Thanksgiving,

1723
01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:41.980
let's not forget about those Colombian minors.

1724
01:47:41.981 --> 01:47:44.650
So wherever the fuck they were from,
oh wait,
they got rescued.

1725
01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:48.070
But still they were down in that hole for a long time.

1726
01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:51.680
I like how this is like the one time of year too,

1727
01:47:51.681 --> 01:47:54.290
when people all of a sudden go out and they want to feed a homeless guy.

1728
01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:55.610
You know,

1729
01:47:55.610 --> 01:47:58.020
I had a buddy of mine did that and he went down there and they thought that they

1730
01:47:58.021 --> 01:48:00.180
were all going to be fucking high five of them and they were actually,

1731
01:48:00.181 --> 01:48:01.560
they actually got pissed at him.
They're like,
well,

1732
01:48:01.561 --> 01:48:04.710
where the fuck are you are the other 11 months of the year?
He was like,
wow,

1733
01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:08.460
that's a good point.
Um,
all right,
that's the podcast for this week.

1734
01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:12.390
I want to thank everybody who came out to my shows.
Uh,

1735
01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:16.200

I was calling the listener,

1736
01:48:16.201 --> 01:48:17.800

uh,

1737
01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:22.530
Washington DC had an awesome time and a comics at Foxwoods.

1738
01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:25.170
If you live in that area,
the New England area,

1739
01:48:25.171 --> 01:48:26.670
you want to do a little bit of gambling and,

1740
01:48:26.671 --> 01:48:30.730
and see some really high quality comedy.
I saw who the fuck they've been booking.

1741
01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:35.480
They got nothing but a big time.
Acts up there.
It's a great place to see a show.

1742

I'm going to be at the Moore theater.

1746
