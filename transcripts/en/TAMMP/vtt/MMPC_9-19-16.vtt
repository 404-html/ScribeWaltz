1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.370
Yeah.

2
00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.930
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.</v>

3
00:00:02.931 --> 00:00:05.510
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.150
September 19th,
2016 what's going on?
How are you?

5
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.700
How are you doing this morning?
How are you?
How was your day?

6
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.800
Did you make it through another one with nothing to stay

7
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.110
fucking boss?
Come walking in.
Hey Carl,

8
00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:32.111
could that gave a word with you and go fuck yourself now when she just love to

9
00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:36.080
be able to say,
yeah,
no doubt.
I'm not saying you're not my boss,

10
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:40.700
but just not today.
All right?
Come with me late Tuesday.
Maybe Wednesday.

11
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.660
Tell you what,
I'll meet here Wednesday for lunch.
All right,

12
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.780
fucking have a word with me Monday morning.
You can't.
All right.

13
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.110
I'm still coming off the high of being free for a couple of days.
You know,

14
00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:57.990
that's where the great thing about Saturday and Sunday,
if you do it right,

15
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.520
meaning you know you're living within your means so you're not stressing about

16
00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:07.540
bills.
It didn't have any fucking kids,
so you got no responsibility on that.

17
00:01:07.541 --> 00:01:08.530
Saturday and Sunday,

18
00:01:08.531 --> 00:01:12.940
you actually get to feel what it's like to be a trust fund kid.
You know,

19
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.380
that's what being a trust fund kid is.
Every day is a Saturday or a Sunday.

20
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.900
You know what,
just limitless possibilities.
I'm going to do this,

21
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.910
I'm going to do that.
Hey,
I'm not gonna do shit.
It's phenomenal,
you know?

22
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.730
So anyways,
um,
I fucking got up,
uh,

23
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.520
I got up this morning,
but I do bad.
Oh boob and I had to go feed my dog,
right.

24
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.950
Had to take the thing outside.
So I did all of that when I was done,
you know,

25
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.590
the usual thing.
Um,
this little house that we rented,

26
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.350
little cute little cottage or they fixing enough fucking kitchen in.

27
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:52.060
These guys are moving right along,
which I'm psyched about.
You know,

28
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.090
they took the whole fucking kitchen out and then I was on the road for a couple

29
00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:58.770
of days.
I came back and they have all the plumbing done,
um,

30
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.040
which is fucking great.

31
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.040
They got all the copper wa a copper pipes done and um,

32
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.430
you know,
got rid of all the galvanized pipe.
Psyched about that.
And,
um,

33
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.200
for whatever reason,
you know,
our sink was just facing cabinets.

34
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:20.490
It was like cabinets right above the sink.
He just like wash dishes,
you know,

35
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.540
staring into the cabinet.

36
00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:26.270
So he go think about the cabinet say was when my lower back was bugging me,

37
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.280
I could rest my fucking flatscreen TV forehead against the,

38
00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:35.320
uh,
against the cabinet.
Give it a little bit of relief.

39
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.270
But you know the deal,
this sink is supposed to be near the window.

40
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.610
That's the classic style for like,

41
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.720
it was for women back in the day when they weren't allowed to vote or basically

42
00:02:46.721 --> 00:02:49.600
leave the house,
you know,
for all extensive purposes.

43
00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:53.170
So they to just as they wash the dishes,
they could just look out,

44
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.980
you know,
and dream the dreams that they were never going to live.
You know?

45
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.460
And I just think it's nice that after all these years,

46
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.570
the Emmy's finally stepped up and gave everybody else in award.

47
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.330
Jason is,
my wife was watching that thing last night.
What a fucking shit show.

48
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.870
I don't know,
man.
I gotta tell you something.

49
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.760
There's no way that it's worse for someone who is into watching award shows our

50
00:03:29.721 --> 00:03:32.060
award show to make them watch sports.

51
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.050
There's no way that that's a worse experience than someone who watches sports.

52
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.160
Having to sit there and watch a fucking,
the Emmy's,
you know,

53
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.780
I didn't have to sit there.
I kinda had a dad too because uh,
you know,

54
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.270
I didn't see my wife and a couple of days and she was like,

55
00:03:47.271 --> 00:03:49.220
I want to hang out with you.

56
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.320
And then we had to sit there and just watch these fucking things.
It just,
Ugh,

57
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.660
the actress.
It just so God damn dramatic

58
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.510
because you believed in me.
I dared to try.

59
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:08.170
<v 2>Okay.</v>

60
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.490
<v 1>I almost fucking threw up whoever the hell said that because you believed in me.</v>

61
00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:16.240
I dared to try.
It's like you're a fucking actor.

62
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.930
It's a killer script.
You what?
You're going to turn it down.

63
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.140
That fucking Oj mini series was,
was unbelievable.

64
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.110
<v 3>Okay.</v>

65
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.730
<v 1>I don't believe in me,
but because you did,
I dared,
I dared to try.</v>

66
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.283
Ugh.

67
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.590
It was one of the worst things I've ever heard,
you know,

68
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.580
other than when you call up the cable company,
if you learn to do,

69
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.710
when you get into that,
talking to a robot lady is one notch lower than that.

70
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.360
I'm not shitting on the actor.
You know what I mean?

71
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.160
They get God because they liked that.

72
00:04:50.161 --> 00:04:52.680
That's why they give the great performance isn't because I'm a cunt.

73
00:04:52.681 --> 00:04:54.150
That's why I do stand up.
You know what I mean?

74
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:58.710
So everybody finds the little fucking hole is supposed to crawl into,
oh my God,

75
00:04:58.711 --> 00:05:01.150
there's always,
these are,

76
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.140
these are important stories and they need to be told,

77
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.570
just take his shiny thing and leaf,
just give us the keys.

78
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.890
Ah,
oh my God.
Dot.

79
00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:21.640
My wife had me over a barrel because I,
you know,
I've been away for like three,

80
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:24.160
four days.
And um,

81
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.540
and then I came home and she was out with,
uh,

82
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.330
with my brother and my own,
my sister in law,
my niece.

83
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.170
So it's fucking place where I was staying at.

84
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.060
They don't have the fucking NFL package.

85
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:40.720
What kind of a fuck man doesn't have the NFL package.
Okay.
I don't give a shit.

86
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:42.990
If your kid has the mumps,
you see,
you see,

87
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:46.030
you carve about something out of your budget.
All right.

88
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.180
To have the fucking NFL package.
So I'm sitting there going like,
fuck,

89
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:53.410
how do I know I can watch it?
I know I can watch it on my computer.

90
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.120
So there's no adult.

91
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:59.320
There are child who's kidding who to help me navigate the SIG.

92
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.520
So I go onto the fucking direct TV thing.

93
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.380
I sign up for something for 99 bucks and I did it and I was like,

94
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:09.690
oh my God,
I did it.
I did it.
And uh,
you know,
patriots dolphins,

95
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.431
I want to see this.

96
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:15.431
I missed the first half and whatever I signed up for was to get the radio feed

97
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.860
cost me like 99 bucks to listen to it on the radio.
What,

98
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.020
what am I a fucking world?
Whoa.
One fighter pilot.
Ah,
what am,

99
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.440
what am I some guy from a time before TV,
sorry,

100
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.160
sorry for the bad reference there.
I mean,
what the fuck?
I'm not 80 right.

101
00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:36.161
So now I'm trying to figure out how to get the video while I have the game on

102
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:37.004
the radio.

103
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.110
And all I'm hearing is that Garappolo fades back to pass and this guy was coming

104
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:43.410
at him for like 10 yards and he's,

105
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.450
I evidently he stood there like Steve Grogan until the last second stay on

106
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:49.910
target and then he let it go.

107
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:53.150
I still haven't seen the replay and I guess he got picked up and slammed to the

108
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:58.040
ground and uh,
you know,
I guess he fucked up his shoulder.

109
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:01.640
I have no idea.
So now they've got this other guy coming in for an NC state.

110
00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:06.050
The place I went to for two semesters,
way back in the day.
Um,

111
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.370
<v 4>okay.</v>

112
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.280
<v 1>And they proceed to March right down the field.
So anyways,
long story short.</v>

113
00:07:11.281 --> 00:07:15.570
So I ended up having a call up direct TV,
right.

114
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.100
And I get into that fucking nightmare,
you know.
Thank you for calling.

115
00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:21.150
Do Reg TV.

116
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.710
If you calling about a paper review that you already already press one.

117
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.920
If you killing without when you to one order press two and then right there I

118
00:07:31.141 --> 00:07:32.760
sit there and you got to make that thing okay.

119
00:07:32.761 --> 00:07:35.670
If I call up and say I already ordered it,

120
00:07:35.671 --> 00:07:39.570
that means they already have my money so I know I'm going to be on hold longer.

121
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:44.690
So I always go with the second option acting as though that I want to order

122
00:07:45.241 --> 00:07:48.440
something now because that will get you to a person immediately like,

123
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.710
cause I just feel like they're like,

124
00:07:49.711 --> 00:07:53.130
oh we don't have this fucking Parsons number yet.
So always picked that option.

125
00:07:53.131 --> 00:07:54.510
But for whatever fucking reason,

126
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:56.603
<v 4>you know,</v>

127
00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.160
<v 1>I picked the first option,</v>

128
00:07:59.161 --> 00:08:03.870
I decided not to lie and then I got dragged into this whole thing and,

129
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.330
but I'm just trying to stay calm.

130
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.073
<v 4>You know?</v>

131
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:12.490
<v 1>Patience is a virtue.
As old I said this to me when I was in Charlotte,</v>

132
00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:17.200
North Carolina,
we both sitting in a bag and I was off trying to do something.

133
00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:19.630
It was a Saturday.
There was a bunch of fucking people there.

134
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.470
I know I had to wire money to get this fucking place because the last people

135
00:08:23.471 --> 00:08:26.500
fucked us over on the other place and the people coming to fix this,

136
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.820
the kitchen and we had to be out of there and it was Saturday.
And you know,

137
00:08:30.821 --> 00:08:32.920
Saturday,
you don't want to go to a bank on Saturday.

138
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.880
That's when nobody who has their money right shows up on a fucking Saturday.

139
00:08:36.881 --> 00:08:39.880
Right?
And they just sit there like,
like,
like children

140
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.950
trying to figure out,
you know,

141
00:08:43.951 --> 00:08:48.951
that whatever 100 minus 110 means negative 10 and you have no fucking money and

142
00:08:49.861 --> 00:08:51.840
you owe the money back and up the bank money,
right?

143
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.850
So I was just sitting there going,
okay,

144
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.750
and this guy was like a preacher or something like that,
this older dude.

145
00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:01.080
And he just,
and I could tell he was frustrating.
He just said out loud page.

146
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.760
He's like,
uh,
patience is a virtue.
And I've,

147
00:09:03.761 --> 00:09:06.840
I've been hanging onto that white knuckling it to that.

148
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:11.550
So I'm sitting there trying to navigate this fucking robot system,

149
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.130
knowing,
knowing I know how this story ends.

150
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.340
It's Charlie Brown trying to kick the football.
I know it's not going to happen,

151
00:09:17.341 --> 00:09:21.660
but I'm trying to channel my wife's calm,
relaxed energy.

152
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.860
I'm trying to channel this fucking guy and I'm just answering all the questions

153
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.640
and you know what?
All of a sudden,
you know,
I'm not knocking down the hurdles.

154
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:32.760
I'm clearing them.
Okay,
I'm getting out in front of this fucking race.

155
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:34.740
I can see the finish line.
Right.

156
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.610
I clear the last fucking hurdle and all of a sudden I forget what the fucking

157
00:09:40.611 --> 00:09:44.570
thing was.
It's like if you just,
if you want to sign up,
no,
no.

158
00:09:44.571 --> 00:09:46.670
It finally got two if you would like to speak.

159
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.930
I think I went,
the last one was,
but it was the last thing I had to do.

160
00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:57.790
It's like say yes and I was like,
oh my God,
I did it.
And I went,

161
00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.070
yes,
in this fucking thing.

162
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.690
Does system heard the other 80 fucking questions it asked,

163
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.950
I had to keep hitting mute to go ah,
yeah,

164
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.790
fucking con and then unmute it because if you yell all your fucking can intuit.

165
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.850
The robot goes,
I'm sorry I didn't understand.

166
00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.260
And then you got to go back to the beginning.

167
00:10:17.261 --> 00:10:21.610
So I got my fucking new game is down so I get the fucking anger out.

168
00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:25.530
And then I just kept going pleasantly.
I'd be like,
you know,
uh,

169
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.450
order NFL on my computer.

170
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:29.850
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

171
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.570
<v 1>And then it asks another question.
I'd be like,
yeah,</v>

172
00:10:31.571 --> 00:10:34.650
just quite somebody's on mute.
How many fucking questions you gotta ask?

173
00:10:34.651 --> 00:10:38.680
Wait and then unmute.
It'd be like,
yes.

174
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.800
So I answered it all.
Fucking 18 of the questions.

175
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.260
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

176
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.093
<v 1>Alright.</v>

177
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:51.250
And the last one was basically it was 10 like is so this is what you want to do.

178
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:56.240
And I just go,
yes.
And the thing all of a sudden just goes,

179
00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.030
I'm sorry I didn't understand.

180
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.300
And then starts asking the question and I immediately start panic,

181
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.950
panicking as it's asking the question,
I'm going to guess yes.
Right.

182
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.730
And it fucking stops,
you know,
just,
you know,
if this is what you want to do,

183
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.630
say yes.
If not,
say no.
And then I was like,
yes.

184
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.970
And then this is just excruciating second pause and it comes back on and goes,

185
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.580
I'm sorry I didn't understand that.
I just went,
yes,

186
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:29.360
it is empty.
Fucking rub,
like a complete lunatic.

187
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.670
And of course it didn't hear me.
And then I just started yelling,
operator,
person,

188
00:11:34.671 --> 00:11:37.730
you fucking cunt.
And I finally hit zero.

189
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:39.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

190
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.020
<v 1>Because a lot of them don't have that option anymore.</v>

191
00:11:41.021 --> 00:11:44.330
I hit zero and it actually took me,
you know,

192
00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:48.450
it put me on hold and now I'm like,
oh my God.
It was just like,
uh,
you know,

193
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.370
now I was on hold and then I'm thinking like,
oh my God,

194
00:11:51.371 --> 00:11:52.420
I want to be on hold forever.

195
00:11:52.421 --> 00:11:57.421
It's football every fucking 48 year old and above fucking dude like me who blew

196
00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:05.170
off computers.
This is my only,
I blew this shit off.

197
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.680
I remember I was living with Bobby Kelly and he totally embraced computers.

198
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.130
The fucking guy can like,
you know,
he can go into the dark web if he wants to.

199
00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:14.050
He knows what the fuck he's doing.
I was just like,

200
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:16.990
these things are fucking stupid.
Give me a notebook and a pen.

201
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.240
I'm going to go churn some fucking butter in here.
Right.
Um,

202
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.850
and I'm still paying the price,

203
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.930
so I'm on hold for fucking ever as,
um,
you know,

204
00:12:26.931 --> 00:12:30.320
but it's halftime and,
uh,

205
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.770
the Patriots somehow are up like,
I dunno,

206
00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:37.750
20 something to like three and a,
I guess go Rapo looked,

207
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.350
looked fucking amazing.

208
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:41.573
<v 4>So</v>

209
00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:47.150
<v 1>as I'm on hold for like 20 minutes,
that computer can't keeps coming back going,</v>

210
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.950
you know,
basically said you're going to be on hold for a long time,

211
00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:53.060
but it's a lot easier.

212
00:12:53.061 --> 00:12:56.450
It's a lot easy and more exciting if you go to our website and it's like,

213
00:12:56.451 --> 00:12:59.360
fuck you,
I don't work for you.
You know?

214
00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:01.640
Plus the reality is I can't figure it out.

215
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.053
<v 4>Um,</v>

216
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.440
so finally this woman comes on

217
00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.600
<v 1>after like a half hour and she's just like,
hey,
how you doing?</v>

218
00:13:12.601 --> 00:13:16.950
Thanks for calling direct TV.
We have a pleasant day,
but blah,
blah,
blah.
She said,

219
00:13:16.951 --> 00:13:21.360
great energy.
She goes,
she just goes basic.
What's the problem?
I was like,

220
00:13:21.361 --> 00:13:24.630
the problems of 48 years old.
I blown off computers and I don't know how to,

221
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:29.250
I just want to watch the game on my device.
And she laughed and she goes,

222
00:13:29.251 --> 00:13:33.990
all right,
what's the name on the account?
She types that in.
She goes,

223
00:13:33.991 --> 00:13:37.440
all right,
you need to get the NFL plus things and I can watch it on your iPhone,

224
00:13:37.441 --> 00:13:39.000
all of this and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

225
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.690
We figured all of that out and I was like,
well,
she goes to,

226
00:13:41.691 --> 00:13:43.230
then he'd just go to this and I go,
don't leave me.

227
00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:45.270
You just got to walk me through the whole thing.
She laughed.

228
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:48.180
She walked me through the whole thing.
It took like three minutes.

229
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.400
<v 4>It was incredible.
Like</v>

230
00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.140
<v 1>there's nothing better than getting a fucking person.</v>

231
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:57.620
They totally help you out unless you get a jerk.
But she wasn't.
She was an angel.

232
00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.830
And next thing you know,
I got the game and um,

233
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:07.060
be on site and I got to watch the whole second half of the,
uh,

234
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.710
of the Patriot game when the dude from NC state came in.

235
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.400
Wait a second,
let's see,
what's his name?

236
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.760
Patriots and see State Qb.

237
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:25.090
<v 4>Um,
what's his name?
Oh,</v>

238
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:29.930
<v 1>Jacoby preset came in and did a great job.</v>

239
00:14:29.931 --> 00:14:31.580
He marches right down the field.

240
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:37.010
We go up like fucking 35 to fucking three or 10 or whatever the fuck it was at

241
00:14:37.011 --> 00:14:39.920
that point.
34 was that what it was?

242
00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:44.120
31 31 that's what it was.
It was 31,
two

243
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.860
till I 10 or some shit like that.
And I'm just like,
oh,
this is fucking great.

244
00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:51.980
This is great.
We got

245
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.910
<v 5>it.
We can cruise now.</v>

246
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.240
And then all of a sudden the dolphins just start coming back.
You know,

247
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.510
they start marching right down the fucking field and it's just like the classic

248
00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:01.970
NFL.
It's likeK is any lead big enough.

249
00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:04.910
I know that we got our third string quarterback who's now a second string

250
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:09.260
because Tom Brady is an active,
what the fuck?
Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah blah.

251
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.710
But um,
long story short,
we ended up pulling out the,

252
00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:16.310
when we're fucking two and oh,
and guess who lost again?

253
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.100
The Cultch lost again.
Can you believe this?

254
00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.323
<v 3>You know,</v>

255
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:26.640
<v 5>it's almost like the football gods are,
are weighing in.</v>

256
00:15:26.641 --> 00:15:30.900
I feel the fact that we're two window without our starting quarterback,

257
00:15:30.901 --> 00:15:34.470
without our second string,
with our third string,
we win.
You know,

258
00:15:34.471 --> 00:15:37.860
granted we played the fucking dolphins,
you know,
they're uh,

259
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:39.170
<v 3>okay.</v>

260
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.180
<v 5>They weren't awake right now obviously,
you know,</v>

261
00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.003
<v 3>so</v>

262
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:49.740
<v 5>I dunno,
I'm just,
I'm so fucking site,
I'm telling you right now if we go through,</v>

263
00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:50.574
you know,

264
00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:51.440
<v 3>okay.</v>

265
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.520
<v 5>And the colts go all in for I know I schedule is going to get a lot tougher and</v>

266
00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:59.000
um,
but anyways,
you know what was funny?
So once we went to winnow,

267
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:03.020
this buddy of mine called it,
he was just going like,
dude,
you know,

268
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:06.930
as long as you said before,
you know,
Garappolo got engine,
he goes,
I,

269
00:16:06.931 --> 00:16:10.310
if he goes to,
went to,
that's fine.
I just don't want him to go for no,

270
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.280
because any every fucking dope out there.
It's going to be like,
you see,

271
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.220
it's just a system.
You could put anybody at dairy,
they were word,

272
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.380
which is basically what boob or a boomer fucking Esiason said.

273
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.860
He even said that.
It just boggles my fucking mind.

274
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.780
Some dope tweeted that to me.
You know,

275
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:36.480
like they sit there and they look like beating a rebuilding team during the

276
00:16:36.481 --> 00:16:41.481
second fucking week of the season is the same as being down with a minute and a

277
00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:43.960
half left in the super bowl.

278
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:49.040
You know the time when other people fucking puke up that Campbell's soup.

279
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.263
<v 3>You know</v>

280
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:58.430
<v 5>other people who are shaped like a pencil who crush it in November fold during</v>

281
00:16:58.431 --> 00:17:02.600
that fucking time.
You know,
there's very few.

282
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.460
Tom Brady's out there.

283
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:10.600
Very few Eli Manning's Eli Manning.
You want,
you want to beat Eli Manning?

284
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.590
Play him in September.
He's like a sleepy dog.

285
00:17:14.591 --> 00:17:19.120
Just fucking lay it on a poet.
It bores the man.
What is this?

286
00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:22.900
A regular season game?
We've got another 40 Ah,

287
00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.240
wake me up when the playoffs are at stake,

288
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:29.920
then all of a sudden the giants got it when the last six games and then that

289
00:17:29.921 --> 00:17:33.950
fucking guys,
he just see fire in his eyes while he,
who's kidding?
Who?

290
00:17:33.951 --> 00:17:36.550
We never has fired his eyes.
He just,
I don't know what the fuck he does.

291
00:17:36.551 --> 00:17:40.540
He knows how to turn it on and to fucking sit here with disrespect.

292
00:17:40.541 --> 00:17:42.640
Tom Brady like that and this is nothing to,

293
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:47.940
they always have this stupid Matt Cassel analogies like Matt Cassel it and he to

294
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:53.700
11 and five can I finally debunk that?

295
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.450
Okay,
for all you fucking fantasy football,

296
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:02.820
Buffalo Wild Wings wearing a Jersey fucking dopes out there.

297
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.310
Who?
Fucking high five Gallup sideways.

298
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.620
He told my fantasy t I activated them today.

299
00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:16.610
Here's the thing.
For the fucking 90000000th time,
the whole Matt Cassel thing,

300
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.600
Matt Cassel took over a fucking team that went 16 and old in the regular season

301
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:29.700
was one get one fucking play away from going 19 and oh the next year he's under

302
00:18:31.631 --> 00:18:32.464
center.

303
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.880
They went 11 and five and for you fucking dope out there who can't do math?

304
00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:40.010
He won five less gates.
Okay?

305
00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:41.350
<v 3>Okay.</v>

306
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.430
<v 5>There's sit and miss the fucking playoffs.</v>

307
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.240
That's what he did with an 18 in one fucking team.

308
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.270
He went 11 and five missed the playoffs.

309
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.900
Thank God we didn't go 10 and six do the math,

310
00:18:54.901 --> 00:18:59.520
fantasy football play in fucking dopes.
He would have gone five and 11

311
00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:03.060
<v 3>all right.</v>

312
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:08.250
<v 5>You guys don't remember when he got,
he got traded to Kansas City.</v>

313
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:09.430
<v 3>Okay.</v>

314
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:13.800
<v 5>And then all of a sudden became mortal again.
You don't remember that.
And I know</v>

315
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.400
<v 6>she going to say,
hey,
we'll play with your players.</v>

316
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.770
<v 5>Oh,
I got an answer for you.
Joe Montana.</v>

317
00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.640
Joe Montana went to the Kansas city chiefs and you know what happened when he

318
00:19:27.641 --> 00:19:31.750
went there?
The Kansas City chiefs went to the playoffs.
All right,

319
00:19:31.751 --> 00:19:35.520
you fucking morons.
Here's the deal.

320
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:40.320
Mick Jagger needs Keith Richards.
Bill Walsh needed Joe Montana.

321
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.510
All right,
it,

322
00:19:43.511 --> 00:19:48.040
Bill Bellacheck is not going to win a fucking super bowl with Garappolo.

323
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:50.590
At least not in the forest.
I mean,
who knows what that kid can do,

324
00:19:50.591 --> 00:19:54.390
but at least not in the first fucking,
it's so fucking stupid.

325
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.490
<v 6>Well,
tell you right now we check is so good.
You could put anybody,</v>

326
00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.910
your character going to work

327
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:05.230
<v 5>cause we beat the dolphins the second week.
We're too went,</v>

328
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.830
oh that's it.
That's it.

329
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.890
Somehow now we're never going to lose a fucking game again.

330
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.920
So you know that chatter is going to happen because there's this buffalo wild

331
00:20:14.961 --> 00:20:19.100
wings people all the way up to guys like Dan Shaughnessy.
He's going to say it.

332
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:23.580
You don't think God Garappolo got hurt because Dan Shaughnessy,

333
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.300
you know the fucking Benedict Arnold of Boston sports,

334
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.840
he's all does that man lives to try to stir up a controversy to distract the

335
00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:38.130
hometown team.
He doesn't give a fuck.
You know what I mean?
He's,
he's like,

336
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.210
skip Bayless before skip Bayless.
It's just,
you just listened to the man.

337
00:20:42.211 --> 00:20:46.810
It's just like,
dude,
you're just literally just saying Shit,
aren't you?
Um,

338
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.450
you just say and shit to say shit.

339
00:20:49.451 --> 00:20:52.930
And I'll tell you right now because you believed in me.

340
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.770
I dared to try.
Um,

341
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:58.750
I dared to try.

342
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:01.980
<v 2>Okay.</v>

343
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:05.850
<v 5>That's one of the worst.
I mean,
other than just racist things,</v>

344
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.050
like if you just get away from that,

345
00:21:07.051 --> 00:21:12.051
if we just like Deuce chills as I learned that from OPEC and the OPD entity

346
00:21:12.451 --> 00:21:16.440
show,
I always give him credit for that expression.
It's just right up there.

347
00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:17.790
I mean,
that's a top five all time.

348
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:22.970
The next time my wife compliments me,

349
00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.690
I'm going to say that to her because she believed in me.

350
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.790
I dared to try.
Um,

351
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.310
these are stories that need to be told.

352
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.760
We're storytellers and with us,

353
00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.760
without us giving people a voice,

354
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.840
you know,
what else is great?
You know,
as the Emmys,

355
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:53.460
I think the Emmy's got scared by all this shit.
The Oscars God,
you know,

356
00:21:53.461 --> 00:21:57.360
and what was funny is as many people of color,
that one,

357
00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:02.700
one of the funniest shots all night long was when,
you know,
if you looked,

358
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:07.230
if they just would like do a shot behind Jimmy Kimmel and you saw the front row,

359
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:11.130
it looked like a great mix of everybody.
But when they did the,

360
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:16.190
the shot was when they'd come back from commercial and you saw the whole crowd.

361
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.490
It was like from the thousands row up to the third row,

362
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.100
it was all white.
It was like,
okay,

363
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.910
it looks like a foreign,
a concert from the back row all the way,

364
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.690
like the third row.
But if they did it the way they shot it,

365
00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:37.230
they front end loaded.

366
00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:38.480
<v 3>Okay.</v>

367
00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.650
<v 5>Like the 15 black people that were there,
they just had them all right in front.</v>

368
00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:46.280
Some Asian people and all that.
But all the way to the back,

369
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.850
I was joking with Nia like you,
if you live in New York City,

370
00:22:49.851 --> 00:22:53.090
every once in a while you go into one of those Bodegas sets either deal with

371
00:22:53.091 --> 00:22:57.020
drugs that just going out of business and it looks like it's fucking stocked

372
00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.330
with food and you grab that one can of food and you look in this like this and

373
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.460
behind the shelves there's like,
there's nothing behind that can,

374
00:23:04.461 --> 00:23:09.270
this is just completely empty.
So I did get some laughs while watching it.
Um,

375
00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:13.780
and I got it.
Be honest with you,
most of the shows I really,
you know,

376
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.900
I mean that people versus Oj was awesome.
All the was,

377
00:23:16.901 --> 00:23:18.010
I'm just teasing the actress.

378
00:23:18.011 --> 00:23:22.870
It's just fucking funny watching them get all Jesus Christ the weight of every

379
00:23:22.871 --> 00:23:24.900
fucking thing that they say.
It's just unbelievable.

380
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:29.350
It's just like that inside the actor's studio when that fucking guy just sits

381
00:23:29.351 --> 00:23:29.651
there.
Like,

382
00:23:29.651 --> 00:23:34.600
I hope you realize the presence of greatness that we are.

383
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:38.650
You know,
just like Jesus Christ.
Dude,
you fucking get pretending to be a fireman.

384
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:43.930
Relax.
Um,
it was so brave.

385
00:23:43.931 --> 00:23:46.940
It was such a brave performance.
You know what I mean?

386
00:23:46.941 --> 00:23:50.060
There's this fucking people update at the end of buildings,
skyscrapers and shit.

387
00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.690
Oh,
those guys who go up and they change.
You ever see those things?

388
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:56.840
Might my palms literally sweat watching these people?

389
00:23:56.841 --> 00:23:59.900
They climb all the way up those towers to change the fucking light,

390
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.590
the little light bulb at the top of the tower at the top of the fucking building

391
00:24:03.591 --> 00:24:05.420
so no plane can see it at night.

392
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.240
And they get that part where they unhooked the safety thing.

393
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:13.130
Jesus Christ it putting on 20 pounds and wearing a wig is brave.

394
00:24:13.131 --> 00:24:18.080
What the fuck is that?
You can't die acting canyon.
Well,

395
00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:22.340
I guess you can't.
There's ways to die as an actor,
right?

396
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.530
The fake gun on set turns out it's got,
you know,

397
00:24:24.531 --> 00:24:27.590
you put it up to your head is that they believe fucking bring a helicopter.

398
00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:32.770
People have died on set.
So no disrespect to them.
Um,

399
00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.090
anyways,
plowing ahead.

400
00:24:35.091 --> 00:24:39.260
So I'm glad to finally get to address that stupid Matt Cassel thing.
Okay,

401
00:24:39.261 --> 00:24:42.040
no disrespect to that castle.
He was a solid quarterback,

402
00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.540
but Jesus Christ to fucking act like,
well,
Hey,
I'm 80 parents,

403
00:24:44.541 --> 00:24:46.160
Matt Castle or Tom Brady,

404
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:50.240
the patriots still go to six winning four out of six.
C'Mon,

405
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.920
C'mon people.
You know,
the reality is,
is what it is,

406
00:24:54.921 --> 00:24:59.921
is she fucking hate the Patriots and if there's any remote angle for you guys to

407
00:25:00.351 --> 00:25:03.230
criticize the Patriots,
you try and find it and I'm going to,

408
00:25:03.231 --> 00:25:06.710
I'm going to go even further I think all right,

409
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:08.451
20 years.

410
00:25:08.451 --> 00:25:12.920
So now when they look back at it and everybody can just fucking let it go,

411
00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.900
you know,
even like,

412
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:19.680
like the most harshest red sox fan that hated Derek Jeter,
you know,

413
00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.030
who's getting hope because the guy was great,
you know,

414
00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:27.120
even at the end of his career,
even you couldn't hate the guy.

415
00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.840
I think 20 years from now.
That's how good look at Tom Brady is.

416
00:25:30.841 --> 00:25:32.850
It's going to take 20 years after he retires.

417
00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:36.240
When they look back on the pettiness.

418
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.710
And the patheticness of and the level of this fucking suspension.
You know,

419
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.090
I think in the end,

420
00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.240
Jim say finally it's going to be exposed for the fucking crybaby that he truly

421
00:25:47.851 --> 00:25:52.440
is.
You know what I mean?
It's just really hard with ESPN now.

422
00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:57.870
How they try to fucking just blow everything up.
Like,
you know,
it's funny,

423
00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:02.880
the whole Colin Kaepernick sitting down
during the,

424
00:26:02.881 --> 00:26:04.260
uh,
the national anthem,

425
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:08.970
the way they sat there and they just tried to fan the fucking flames of that.

426
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:15.710
Then they had the camera for the whole song on a couple of guys taken a knee.

427
00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:22.680
There's like 45 guys standing up to guys taking a need,

428
00:26:22.681 --> 00:26:26.400
another guy sitting down.
It's about police brutality.
We get it right,

429
00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:29.250
but they're going to sit there and fade out.
It just,
it drives me nuts.

430
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:33.120
They talk about that last week though of just how everybody just turns it into

431
00:26:33.121 --> 00:26:36.630
themselves.
Like those,
uh,
moments like that.

432
00:26:36.631 --> 00:26:40.260
Like they just won't keep it on topic,
which is,

433
00:26:40.261 --> 00:26:45.210
this is protesting police brutality and just wanting a conversation in figuring

434
00:26:45.211 --> 00:26:48.660
out what are we doing?
What are you doing?
How can we make this better?

435
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.780
Because neither one of us wants this result overall because overall people are,

436
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:57.570
I think they're good.
All right,
and there are scumbag,
you know,

437
00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:03.070
obviously on both sides or whatever.
Maybe you can fucking weed them out.

438
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:04.470
I don't know how to do.
I knew there's no,

439
00:27:04.471 --> 00:27:08.970
for them this basically there is no solution to it.
I don't have any.
Right,

440
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:13.020
but what is funny is I was listening to this radio show,

441
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.450
I can't remember if I talked about this last Thursday,

442
00:27:15.451 --> 00:27:20.070
was fucking hilarious and it was five white guys talking about it and by the end

443
00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:23.520
of it,
like there was no talking about police brutality.

444
00:27:23.521 --> 00:27:26.670
Why would there be this five white dudes talking about it?
And they literally go,

445
00:27:26.671 --> 00:27:30.270
well,
what about when,
when you're raw,
when you're at home,

446
00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:36.640
when you were at home watching the game and the national anthem comes on,

447
00:27:36.641 --> 00:27:38.630
should,
should you stand up then

448
00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:42.603
<v 0>okay.</v>

449
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:47.430
<v 5>No,
you sure they were all afraid to say no.
No,
you shouldn't.</v>

450
00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.160
If you want to,
you can,
but you're in your house,

451
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.880
which great about being in your house is you finally get to be 100% you,

452
00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.640
which means you're going to,
you're barely gonna have clothes on.

453
00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:00.700
<v 0>Okay.</v>

454
00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.000
<v 5>You're going to be verbally abusing people.
You're going to be drinking a beer.</v>

455
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.660
You're going to say all kinds of fucked up shit to your television,
which is why,

456
00:28:07.661 --> 00:28:10.330
by the way,
if you have one of those smart TVs,

457
00:28:10.331 --> 00:28:11.860
if you ever want to run for president,

458
00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.250
you have got to put a piece of tape over that thing.

459
00:28:15.251 --> 00:28:17.440
And I don't know how to turn off the listening device,

460
00:28:17.441 --> 00:28:21.610
but I believe my p the paranoid me,
I believe that they are video.

461
00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:22.860
If you leave it on there,

462
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:27.010
videotaping everything that they can get and recording everything that they

463
00:28:27.011 --> 00:28:28.720
could get so they can build this.

464
00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:29.900
<v 0>Okay.</v>

465
00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.740
<v 5>They can make this movie trailer about you.
You know,
some day,</v>

466
00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.790
well,
you're either a fucking hero.
Oh,
you're just a complete piece of shit.
Well,

467
00:28:38.791 --> 00:28:40.020
I guess they couldn't show it.

468
00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.013
<v 0>MMM.</v>

469
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.230
<v 5>I guess it would only show it.
If you didn't do what they wanted you to do,</v>

470
00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.090
then they would just leak it out and be like,

471
00:28:47.091 --> 00:28:51.050
new shocking video discovered today on the Internet.

472
00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:55.640
Have an eight year old,
whatever Obama of whatever saying,

473
00:28:55.641 --> 00:29:00.430
listen this while he was watching
eight ways to fuck your mother.

474
00:29:00.431 --> 00:29:04.790
I never know the name of it.
The Big Bang theory.
All right.

475
00:29:04.791 --> 00:29:08.330
That went off the rails,
didn't it?
29 minutes.
A Yammer inbuilt.

476
00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:12.500
Jesus fucking Christ.
You know,
some days the podcast is hard.

477
00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.570
Other days it's easy.
But I just want to say to everybody who will listen

478
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:22.490
because you dare to download.
I dare to try.

479
00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.050
<v 2>Ooh.</v>

480
00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:26.240
<v 5>Um,
all right,
let's,</v>

481
00:29:26.241 --> 00:29:31.220
let's get some of the advertising out of the way for this week.
So,

482
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:32.083
um,

483
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:32.830
<v 0>okay.</v>

484
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:34.810
<v 5>You know,
as much as I am shitting on,
Jim are saying,</v>

485
00:29:34.811 --> 00:29:38.340
I do not hate the colts on any level.
Um,

486
00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:40.600
I was watching them play and uh,

487
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:46.120
<v 1>it's just fucking,
it's just such a great fucking uniform.</v>

488
00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:49.240
They're always going to be the Baltimore Colts to me.
And uh,

489
00:29:49.241 --> 00:29:51.730
Andrew luck is the shit whenever he runs.

490
00:29:51.731 --> 00:29:56.020
He's like a hybrid of Steve Young and John Elway and um,

491
00:29:56.470 --> 00:30:01.120
it's just a fucking Broncos there.
Look at greater and greater like deck.

492
00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.220
Now those guys,
if I was to one,
no,

493
00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.640
it's the Patriots to tour now and we beat the panthers and then we beat,

494
00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:12.160
we beat the colts.
I would be pretty excited.
Um Oh,

495
00:30:12.161 --> 00:30:16.120
I got to talk about the ramps when I get back here.
All right,
here we go.

496
00:30:16.121 --> 00:30:20.130
A couple of reads here.
People where to go?
One,
two,
three,
four,
five,

497
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.960
five.
All right,
but you know what?

498
00:30:22.961 --> 00:30:25.600
People are learning that I can't read out loud to the copies real quick.

499
00:30:25.601 --> 00:30:29.410
All right,
here we go.
All right,
track early.
Everybody tracker,

500
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.630
smart cars,
smart phones,

501
00:30:31.631 --> 00:30:36.631
smart house technology has made everything wicked smart doctor.

502
00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:41.470
But losing your stuff.
Make smart people feel really stupid.

503
00:30:41.471 --> 00:30:46.471
Kid Track and make slews and thanks is thingy the past Joe tracker is a coin

504
00:30:47.531 --> 00:30:50.830
size device that you can just put on the back of somebody's neck.

505
00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:56.260
Is it coin size device?
I'm actually,
I'm not supposed to say that.

506
00:30:56.261 --> 00:30:59.380
You're not supposed to use this to track people.

507
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:05.650
Draggers at coin size device that locates misplaced keys,
wallets,
bags,
computers,

508
00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:09.850
anything in seconds.
Just pair of tracker,
do your smartphone.

509
00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.130
I just pictured like trying to find your computer.

510
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:15.420
They find it in two seconds and you look over and it's some big duty.

511
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.280
Could beat the shit out of you and you just like,
well there it is.

512
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.940
I know where it is and I guess I'm not getting it back.

513
00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:26.460
Just pair of tracker to your smart phone.
Attach it to anything in.
Fine.

514
00:31:26.461 --> 00:31:30.880
It's precise location with the tap of a button.
It's that fucking easy.

515
00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:34.270
Lose your phone,
press the button on tracker and your phone rings.

516
00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.930
Even if even when it's on silent.
Oh,
that's not creepy at all.

517
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.230
How do you guys do that?
How do you turn my phone on?

518
00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:47.580
Is this like some side fucking project by the CIA or something like that?

519
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.960
Why would they need extra money?
What would they do?
You know,

520
00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.580
maybe they're going to buy like 50th anniversary,
like get smart shoe phones,

521
00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.820
you know,
and the government doesn't have enough money to pay for it.
Well,

522
00:32:00.821 --> 00:32:03.080
you're gonna have to figure out another way.
Well,

523
00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:06.310
what if we came up with a company that just track shit?

543
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:14.840
Tom Brady comes back in two weeks.
We really made it.

544
00:33:14.841 --> 00:33:18.890
Fuck Jim Earth.
Say,

545
00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.800
I hope he wears a jock strap.
All alright.

546
00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.260
Whether you're wearing a suit or sweats,

547
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.560
he spent almost 24 hours a day in your underwear.

548
00:33:27.561 --> 00:33:32.561
Unless you're a fucking pervert and you're free balding.

549
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.640
But instead of making a statement like Superman's tights under his everyday

550
00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:40.490
clothes,
um,
your underwear is probably boring.
Well,

551
00:33:40.491 --> 00:33:42.500
me undies is here to change that.
They're here.

552
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:46.880
They're here to jazz up your fucking underwear.
Um,
all right.

553
00:33:46.881 --> 00:33:51.881
Every pair of me undies is made by sustainable source modal modal of fabric

554
00:33:52.491 --> 00:33:55.100
that's twice as soft as coffin,
allegedly.

555
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.090
Nothing can describe the fit and feel of me undies once it gets up against your

556
00:33:59.091 --> 00:34:00.980
under carriage.
You know what I mean?

557
00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.630
You'll start doing scissor kicks just to enjoy it.
Uh,
I mean,

558
00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:08.900
you know what those are,
but once you try them on,
maybe lesbians can do that,

559
00:34:08.901 --> 00:34:11.810
put it on and just do that little bump and grind up against each other.
Like,

560
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.560
oh my God,
it's even more amazing.
Uh,
but once you try them on,

561
00:34:15.561 --> 00:34:18.680
you'll understand they're called the why.
They're called the world's mold.

562
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:21.440
The world's world's world's most comfortable underwear.

563
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.560
And if you don't love your first pair of underwear,
they're free.

564
00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:25.640

Dollar Shave Club do you do all his shave club keeps getting better.

576
00:35:06.591 --> 00:35:09.740
This is the last one.
And then I'll go back to the podcast.
Uh,

577
00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:14.350
they sat it four years ago by delivering their amazing affordable raises and

578
00:35:14.351 --> 00:35:17.630
they've grown to over 3 million members,
uh,

579
00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:21.650

580
00:35:21.651 --> 00:35:25.850

Dollar Shave Club is so much more than razors.

581
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:29.300
They have a mission,
they want you to look good,
smell good and feel your best.

582
00:35:29.301 --> 00:35:33.500
And they've,
they've been investing millions in Rad r and D,

583
00:35:33.501 --> 00:35:37.100
whatever that is developing their own original grooming formulas,
fear,
face,

584
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.610
hair and body.
Yeah.

585
00:35:38.611 --> 00:35:41.130
They also want to make zillions of dollars and get some horse.

586
00:35:41.131 --> 00:35:44.730
Let's not forget about that.
All right.
This stuff is amazing.

587
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.030
Pre and post shave formulas,
skin protection formulas,

588
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:52.660
killer hairstyling products and literally the most amazing soap and body wash

589
00:35:52.661 --> 00:35:57.180

The store experience is awful.
All the stuff looks the same.

590
00:35:57.181 --> 00:36:00.000
There's too many options and no one's there to help you find the products that

591
00:36:00.001 --> 00:36:00.834
are right for you.

592
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:03.930
Do you have any idea why you picked the shampoo or body wash should do?

593
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:08.070
Seriously,
just get all your grooming stuff shipped from dollar shave club.

Every time you walk into rite aid and one of those places,

596
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:15.210

597
00:36:15.211 --> 00:36:18.780
pictures,
right?
And then the fat fuck wants to get ice cream.

598
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.380
You don't want to stand in that line.
Give it a try.

All right,

605
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:41.430
back to the podcast.

606
00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:46.431
Let's talk about the ramps yet that that Dap Gudu Gudu oh by the way,

607
00:36:46.441 --> 00:36:48.750
people waiting for me to talk about Formula One racing.

608
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.570
I didn't get a chance to see the race because I'm,

609
00:36:51.571 --> 00:36:55.860
all of that shit is recorded on my teeth at home.
So,
um,

610
00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:02.210
I guess when I go over there today to do the elliptical,
elliptical,
uh,

611
00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:07.200
as I try to melt,
but what's left of this fucking belly off before my special,
um,

612
00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:11.070
I'll sit down and watch it.
I heard it's an amazing race.
It was in Singapore,

613
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.190
which I've had the privilege of going to one time and doing a,
uh,

614
00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:16.710
had a great time doing a show there.
So I'm looking forward to it.

615
00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.970
I have somehow been able to avoid seeing who won.

616
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:23.760
And now that I've said that,
I know there's trolls out there,

617
00:37:23.761 --> 00:37:27.030
so I will not be looking at any of my fucking devices today until I watch it.

618
00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:31.230
So anyways,
let's talk about the Los Angeles Rams.
Oh,
the poor ramps,

619
00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:34.230
the poor fucking ramps.
You know,

620
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:39.240
they fucking left La Memorial Coliseum in 1979.

621
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:44.050
I'm done with this town of sicky.
You bomb it dead.
You'll see.

622
00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:48.260
I'm going to come back one day and you'll understand why you should have bought

623
00:37:48.261 --> 00:37:51.380
me a new stadium.
Right?
And then they went down to Anaheim,

624
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:54.530
bright fell in with the new crowd,
you know,

625
00:37:54.531 --> 00:37:56.840
and they promise them a new stadium and they didn't give him one.

626
00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:59.900
And then they were like,
well to hell with you,
you're just like my parents.

627
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:04.340
And then they moved to Saint Louis and they got to still another Shitty fucking

628
00:38:04.341 --> 00:38:06.590
stadium.
But they still,
despite that,

629
00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.380
they learned to overcome and they won.

630
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:14.210
They won a Superbowl in 1999.
The greatest fucking show on turf,
right?

631
00:38:14.211 --> 00:38:17.300
Of course they lost to the Patriots in 2001.
But you know,
that's life.

632
00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:20.210
You have your good days and your bad days.
All right?

633
00:38:20.211 --> 00:38:23.360
Isn't that right there Ricky parole,
the dynasty brigades.

634
00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:28.260
Rarely is that what happened?
Reiki or Reiki.
Um,

635
00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.860
anyway,
so now like all these years later,
it's like they,

636
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:36.250
it's the back in the La more memorial coliseum.
They,
they've,

637
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:41.140
<v 3>they've fuckin come back 37 years later to move back in with their fucking</v>

638
00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:45.040
parents while they get this shit together.
It's like they went through a divorce,

639
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:48.100
they found love and Saint Louis,
they thought it was great.

640
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:51.970
And then like 20 years into that marriage,
you know,

641
00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:54.730
the partner came out and just said,
listen,
I'm gay.

642
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:57.710
<v 1>You know,
it's not that I didn't love you,</v>

643
00:38:57.711 --> 00:39:01.340
but I just need to explore this part of me.
I need to be who I am.

644
00:39:01.341 --> 00:39:03.410
And the ramps were like,
what the fuck?

645
00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:06.770
And that they had to move back in with their parents while they get their shit

646
00:39:06.771 --> 00:39:10.790
together,
but they still got that Superbowl money.
So they got a new stadium.

647
00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.820
So it's the next couple of years.
It's like a sick Coptic and there's a great,

648
00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.780
there's,
you know what,
there's,
there's a premise right there for set cub.

649
00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:22.550
Somebody was married for 20 fucking years.
There are other partner comes out,

650
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:26.090
says that they're gay,
so they got to move back in with their parents.

651
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:31.100
You keep the gay character there,
so you win an Emmy,
right?
Right.
Because you,

652
00:39:31.101 --> 00:39:36.050
did you write it?
I had the courage to say it
right.

653
00:39:36.051 --> 00:39:38.210
You get a fucking Emmy,
Jesus Christ

654
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.680
that could come on right after the Big Bang theory.

655
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:46.770
Somebody for the love of God go out and right there.
Um,

656
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:51.800
just God knows I'm not gonna.
Um,
anyways,

657
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:56.220
that's what the ramps are.
What the fuck would that be called?

658
00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.900
You've got the classic moving in with you.
That's great.
You get the classic,

659
00:40:00.901 --> 00:40:04.170
move it back in home to your hometown with your parents.

660
00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:07.660
But because you're addressing,
um,

661
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:11.010
somebody being gay than the critics got to go easy cause they don't want to look

662
00:40:11.011 --> 00:40:13.380
homophobic.
We all these fucking,
this,
this,

663
00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:18.660
this trope again.
Oh that's perfect.
That's fucking perfect.

664
00:40:18.661 --> 00:40:21.870
Right?
And then you throw an Asian character in there,

665
00:40:21.871 --> 00:40:26.250
a couple of people of color,
right?
Get a nice mix Casco.

666
00:40:26.251 --> 00:40:30.210
And like they had back in the 70s,
remember fish,

667
00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:34.110
they are a young Willis was on that show yet.
Sanford,

668
00:40:34.111 --> 00:40:37.650
it's sun yet the Jeffersons.
You had all these great fucking shows.

669
00:40:37.651 --> 00:40:41.400
And then the 80s came and Reagan came and he said,
ah,

670
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:43.890
take the solar panels off the White House,

671
00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:50.540
make the sitcoms white again.
Right.
Jesus Christ.

672
00:40:50.541 --> 00:40:54.090
And then what happened?
What was the follow up?
Yeah,

673
00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:59.120
those six people dancing in the fountain in the 90s we went it a billable by the

674
00:40:59.841 --> 00:41:04.770
elbow,
the widest fucking song that's ever been written.
We knew to do.

675
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.810
Do,
do,
do,
do,

676
00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:10.610
do Baba Baba Baba papel bullpen and then they'll go right.

677
00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:16.400
How do I know that?
Cause I got a lady in my life,

678
00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:20.330
I'll be honest with you,
I actually,
Joey's character,

679
00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.930
Joey's fucking hilarious on friends.
I haven't seen that many of them.

680
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:27.620
But you could get through them cause she knew Joey was going to say something

681
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:32.630
funny and Jenna Fairness Aniston was fucking smoking hot.
Not that,

682
00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.010
not that still isn't.

683
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:35.570
<v 5>You know what I mean?</v>

684
00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:38.750
I don't want to have to apologize to the ages and crowd here,

685
00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.490
but you get somehow get through it.

686
00:41:40.491 --> 00:41:44.690
Like Joey would say something to help you get through the episode,

687
00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.150
but I got to tell you when they would dance in the fountain,

688
00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.180
like I always just thought that that was a network note where they were just

689
00:41:50.181 --> 00:41:51.200
like,
all right,
you motherfuckers,

690
00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:56.120
you wanna fucking all gang up together and negotiate and hold us over a barrel

691
00:41:56.121 --> 00:41:58.690
for,
we'll give you,
we'll give you a you a million dollars an episode,

692
00:41:58.691 --> 00:41:59.524
but you know what?

693
00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:04.690
You're going to dance in a fucking fountain to the widest song ever in a party.

694
00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:07.100
He's going to die when you watched,

695
00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.710
when you really watch the opening credits of that,

696
00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:14.300
you can seek the girls don't give a fuck,
right?
But you can see it and the guys,

697
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:18.950
you can see a part of them dies each season when they do that,

698
00:42:18.951 --> 00:42:21.830
we ain't gaining in and really we got to be in the FFO.

699
00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.390
Why did they have to dance?

700
00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:32.550
Okay,
let's plow ahead here anyways,
clear.
What are you doing?

701
00:42:32.551 --> 00:42:36.480
Why are you staring at me?
Huh?
You burn out your head,
your food,

702
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.760
your tail wagon on the ground.
You had your food,

703
00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:43.573
<v 3>right?</v>

704
00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:47.880
<v 5>Cleo or I don't have time to do this,
let's get back to the ramps.</v>

705
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:55.090
So they fucking come back their first home opener.
You got to love that.

706
00:42:55.091 --> 00:42:58.180
They go back to the,
the blue and the yellow uniforms,

707
00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:00.760
which is exactly what they should be wearing.

708
00:43:00.761 --> 00:43:02.410
That that should not be their third jersey.

709
00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:06.520
That should be their first Jersey yet all the fans were in the old school

710
00:43:06.521 --> 00:43:11.110
fucking pad Hagen and in Eric Dickerson Jersey.
It was even Dickerson.

711
00:43:11.111 --> 00:43:15.580
Never played in that stadium,
but it was fucking great.
It was so great to see.

712
00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:18.400
And then who look,
who was the cross who was across the street,

713
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:24.340
who is on the other sideline?
It was so perfect.
All Pete Carroll.
Oh,

714
00:43:24.341 --> 00:43:29.290
pistol Pete Carroll returning to the scene of the crimes.
Right.

715
00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:32.770
I would say I would,
if I was him,
I would have been nervous,
you know,
like,

716
00:43:32.771 --> 00:43:35.200
am I going to get arrested by the fucking NCAA?

717
00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:40.630
You know what halftime and finally get to question me.
Um,
but you know,

718
00:43:40.631 --> 00:43:43.420
he was just doing what everybody else did.
It's fine.

719
00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:46.700
I actually know something.
The,
uh,

720
00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.600
USC really got fucking think got screwed over in that,

721
00:43:49.601 --> 00:43:52.750
take it back a Heisman trophy.
I mean,
come on.

722
00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:56.350
Because what USC was doing,
what everybody else does it that level.

723
00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.150
College football is fucking filthy.

724
00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:02.230
Nobody got fucked over more than the buckeyes though at time of those guys.

725
00:44:02.231 --> 00:44:06.610
What do they sign?
Jersey so they could get free tattoos.
Um,

726
00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.190
something like that.
I Dunno,
Bill,
you could look it up.

727
00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:14.380
You can maybe get your fucking ducks in a row,
figure out what's going on.

728
00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:18.910
Uh,
this is one of these weeks.
I just have too much shit to talk about.
Um,

729
00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:23.520
I had an amazing fucking time when I was in Durham,
uh,

730
00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.790
playing the Carolina theater.

731
00:44:24.791 --> 00:44:29.770
What a fucking gym that places the crowds were great.
Um,

732
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:32.190
my fucking act

733
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:34.950
<v 1>is still,
for some reason an hour and 50 minutes long.</v>

734
00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:38.820
I got to figure out how to cut this thing down.
Um,

735
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.420
but I still had a great time and some of the greatest food I've ever had when

736
00:44:42.421 --> 00:44:46.770
I've been on the road.
I didn't realize that Duke University was in Durham.

737
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:49.530
I had no idea.
And I was just walking around going like,

738
00:44:49.531 --> 00:44:53.910
why the fuck in this random town
that's,
you know,

739
00:44:53.911 --> 00:44:57.750
like half hour away from Raleigh,
the state capitol has all this great food,

740
00:44:57.751 --> 00:45:02.100
this is incredible.
And they just kept seeing Duke Blue Devil gear,

741
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:04.710
people wearing hats and shit.
I was just like,
oh,
I'm an idiot.

742
00:45:04.711 --> 00:45:09.180
This is a college town.
And um,
I'm actually,

743
00:45:09.181 --> 00:45:11.460
I've got to give a shout up to a couple of places.

744
00:45:11.461 --> 00:45:13.980
We hate this place to federal be,
give a go there.

745
00:45:13.981 --> 00:45:18.270
They got these black bean burger sliders that are incredible.

746
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:22.770
And then I went to arguably the best soul food restaurant I've ever been to and

747
00:45:22.771 --> 00:45:24.540
I've been to a lot of bad ones,

748
00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:29.240
a lot of bad ones over the years I've been talked into their man,

749
00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:31.710
why people don't know how to cook.
You have to season your food and Blah,
blah,

750
00:45:31.711 --> 00:45:34.380
blah,
blah blah.
So you fucking go in there and what do you get?

751
00:45:34.381 --> 00:45:39.381
You get a weak ass waffle and some dry fucking chicken and there is nothing

752
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.270
fucking worse than dry chicken.

753
00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:47.290
Chicken is the greatest taste in food there is.
Everybody loves it.

754
00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.560
It's fucking delicious.
And there's nothing better than when it's cooked right.

755
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:52.120
But when it's dried out

756
00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:56.600
<v 5>to eat dried chicken,
it's literally a job.
Like your job gets sore.</v>

757
00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.190
You know,

758
00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:01.970
like I bet in the future when people want to avoid getting a double chin,

759
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.600
they're going to have the dry chicken workout and you just eat half a fucking

760
00:46:05.601 --> 00:46:07.110
chicken that's dry.

761
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:11.330
Did you just sit there chewing that shit and you develop these jaw muscles that

762
00:46:11.331 --> 00:46:15.440
prevents you from getting like that?
Joey Ramone,
you know,

763
00:46:15.441 --> 00:46:18.950
the thing that he had with it just goes Chin right to the center,
your chest.

764
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.890
<v 1>Um,
the pellet kitchen.
Um,
so anyways,</v>

765
00:46:24.891 --> 00:46:29.330
this place was called dames.
D a.
M.
E Apostrophe s.
N.

766
00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.670
When you go there,
I'm actually going to,

767
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:34.340
I'm going to go online right now and I'm going to get to the fucking menu.

768
00:46:34.341 --> 00:46:36.840
You got to try their fucking chicken cutlet.

769
00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:42.360
They had a chicken cutlet with this barbecue sauce and Dean del Rey who fucking

770
00:46:42.361 --> 00:46:47.250
crushed it all week.
Um,
he,
uh,

771
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.670
he got the shrimp,
so he had this hot sauce.

772
00:46:50.671 --> 00:46:55.020
So I had this barbecue sauce to put it in and I also had um,

773
00:46:57.070 --> 00:47:00.430
this hot sauce to put it in.
Oh my God,
look,
just look at that fucking food.

774
00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.280
A chicken and waffle inspiration.

775
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:08.410
What's the one I got the option like the dames option because you could actually

776
00:47:08.651 --> 00:47:13.120
pick out Dame's daily deal.
Right.
Serve Tuesday.

777
00:47:13.121 --> 00:47:15.860
Now that's not it.
Ah,
I'll never be able to find it.

778
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:20.390
It was basically something that was,
you could,
it was an option that you could,

779
00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:22.760
it was the Dame something or other.

780
00:47:22.761 --> 00:47:26.510
But what was cool was you got to pick out the chicken.
You want it,

781
00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:29.800
the part of the chicken.
So I went with the chicken cutlet

782
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.810
<v 5>and I got a waffle and we actually took it to go and brought it back to the</v>

783
00:47:34.811 --> 00:47:39.370
hotel room.
So we ate it about 15 minutes later.
So it's still,
it traveled great.

784
00:47:39.371 --> 00:47:41.380
I can't imagine if I actually just sat there and ate it.

785
00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.900
<v 1>Like there was already a line out the door and I heard the guy was going to open</v>

786
00:47:45.901 --> 00:47:48.420
another one.
Once again,
it's called a dames,

787
00:47:48.421 --> 00:47:53.310
chicken and waffles in a Durham,
North Carolina.
It was fucking amazing.

788
00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:56.820
And uh,
and then the bar,
we w we would go to,

789
00:47:56.850 --> 00:48:01.850
we went to the federal and they just had all these great beers and um,

790
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:05.160
yeah,
it was amazing.
There was a couple of beers that I tried.

791
00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:10.170
I had one that was actually nine point something percent alcohol.

792
00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:13.290
Took a picture of it.
It had like a fucking,

793
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:20.900
I had like almost looked like the rolling stones except a tongue wasn't out,

794
00:48:21.321 --> 00:48:25.550
you know,
just had like lips
is called hell yes ma'am.

795
00:48:25.551 --> 00:48:29.300
Belgian style golden and a,

796
00:48:29.301 --> 00:48:31.370
if you Google a picture of it

797
00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:34.520
<v 5>and you look on the can,
32 full ounces,</v>

798
00:48:34.521 --> 00:48:39.050
9.2% alcohol cause you know beer is going to give you a belly so you might as

799
00:48:39.051 --> 00:48:42.890
well get to it.
You want to drink a beer?
That seal right there.
Fred.

800
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:46.190
They had some great local beers.
It was another one that I had every night.

801
00:48:46.191 --> 00:48:47.050
Just had like one.

802
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:52.170
<v 1>And,
um,
we had a great time.
And,
uh,
it turned out the,</v>

803
00:48:52.171 --> 00:48:53.004
uh,

804
00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:57.810
<v 5>North Carolina tar heels football team was at home against James Madison</v>

805
00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:01.500
University.
And I was like,
fuck it man.
I gotta go.
I got to go.
We went over there,

806
00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:05.850
had a great time.
It was hot as balls.
We sat at the top of the stadium,
you know,

807
00:49:05.851 --> 00:49:07.260
so we'd have a little bit of shade.

808
00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:12.300
It was still a great time and a absolutely no defense in that game.

809
00:49:12.301 --> 00:49:15.960
And the first half we saw eight touchdowns total.
It was 35,
21.

810
00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:17.633
<v 1>MMM.</v>

811
00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:21.750
<v 5>Every way you could fucking score on offense,
flea flicker,</v>

812
00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:26.160
the fucking running back coming out of the backfield in just runs just a

813
00:49:26.161 --> 00:49:28.320
sideline route and nobody picks him up.

814
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.670
And basically something that should have gone for six yards or maybe a pick six

815
00:49:32.671 --> 00:49:35.880
if you sniffed it out.
Went for like 80 yard touchdown.

816
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:41.270
<v 1>Um,
it was incredible.
Uh,
but um,</v>

817
00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:43.730
so that was,
and I was sitting there going,
wow,
that was like the,

818
00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:48.890
that's the fourth or fifth ACC team I've seen.
Um,
out of all of them,

819
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:53.090
it was a,
let's see,
I've seen Boston College.

820
00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:54.530
<v 0>Okay.</v>

821
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:56.000
<v 1>North Carolina state.</v>

822
00:49:56.450 --> 00:50:00.620
When I went there for two semesters before they enclose the stadium member,

823
00:50:00.621 --> 00:50:04.580
I sat on grass,
I had grass seats.
That's how long ago this was.

824
00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:09.050
It was like 1987.
Um,
Jesus clear.
What do you got?

825
00:50:09.051 --> 00:50:09.880
Fleas,

826
00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:14.880
you and over there I've seen North Carolina tar heels and I seen the University

827
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:19.160
of Miami.
So slowly but surely with my OCD,
I'm going to,

828
00:50:19.161 --> 00:50:22.460
I'm going to knock out the ACC eventually.
I would like,

829
00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:27.020
by the time I look up in my 70,
still gone to almost every major program out.

830
00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:31.440
Um,
and I know it sounds fucked up,
but it's,
it's fun as hell and it,
it,

831
00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:34.470
it makes doing the road kind of easy,
you know,
like,
um,

832
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:40.800
I've seen a,
I've seen like what I it by the end of this,

833
00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:41.900
<v 0>okay,</v>

834
00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:45.500
<v 1>this football season,
let's see.
And this year I'm going to see Carolina,</v>

835
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:50.180
I'm going to see Nebraska,
I'm going to see Florida Lsu.

836
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:56.130
And uh,
I think I might hang out in Nashville and go to that Vanderbilt game.

837
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.800
And then I'll,
I've seen like in an like 18 or 20 college football teams,
but,

838
00:51:01.801 --> 00:51:03.990
um,
I don't know.
I've kind of gotten into that shit.

839
00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:09.930
Like being able to name like obscure divisions.
Like what's the one,

840
00:51:09.931 --> 00:51:14.470
is it mountain west
where it's like Wyoming,

841
00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:17.740
New Mexico,
Nevada.
You went LV,

842
00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:22.870
air force,
Hawaii and then it's all the state teams.

843
00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:27.250
Boise State,
Colorado State,

844
00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:32.050
Utah State,
San Jose State,
Fresno state,
San Diego state.

845
00:51:32.051 --> 00:51:36.310
I think I missed one in there.
Um,
and going to those ones,

846
00:51:36.311 --> 00:51:38.810
everybody wants to go to the big house and Shit.
You go to some of those dudes,

847
00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:41.560
you got kicked fucking great games,
great games.

848
00:51:41.561 --> 00:51:45.340
And then what's cool is you might get lucky and there might be like the next

849
00:51:45.341 --> 00:51:48.160
Randy Moss who for whatever he did something in high school.

850
00:51:48.161 --> 00:51:51.700
I got blamed for some shit or just fucked up in school.
And you get to see,

851
00:51:51.701 --> 00:51:54.670
you know,
some great player down there.

852
00:51:54.671 --> 00:51:58.900
You May just stumble upon somebody who's just completely dominating,
clear.

853
00:51:58.901 --> 00:52:03.070
Why are you so fucking navy today,
man?
What's going on with you?
Um,

854
00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:06.490
it's coming up here.
Just putting a head right in my lap.
Hey,
hey.
Hey.
Hey.

855
00:52:06.491 --> 00:52:10.420
Watch the wires.
Watch the wires.
All right,
I've got to wrap this thing up.
Let me,

856
00:52:10.421 --> 00:52:15.340
uh,
I haven't done the questions yet.
Um,
oh,

857
00:52:15.341 --> 00:52:15.761
by the way,

858
00:52:15.761 --> 00:52:19.390
how many walk people are going to score a touchdown and drop the ball before

859
00:52:19.391 --> 00:52:23.500
they get into the end zone?
If I was a coach,
I would just be like,

860
00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:27.590
I don't give a fuck what you do once you get in the end zone,
but,

861
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:32.620
but move the ball forward.
Stop doing this,
dropping it behind you.

862
00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:34.900
Jesus fucking Christ.

863
00:52:34.901 --> 00:52:38.500
It's like almost every week now at the pro or the college level,

864
00:52:38.501 --> 00:52:41.230
somebody goes and does it and then they have this shot.

865
00:52:41.231 --> 00:52:46.000
Fuck a look on their face.
Like they've never seen somebody do it.
Uh,

866
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:47.600
how bad did what,

867
00:52:47.601 --> 00:52:50.830
what was that team was at the longhorns that could completely fucked over.

868
00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:52.990
They said that they didn't recover the ball.
What do you mean?

869
00:52:52.991 --> 00:52:56.500
The ball was just laying there and the guy went over and he picked it up.

870
00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:01.660
Was that the game?
Was a California game?
Was a California against texts,
cal vers,

871
00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:03.810
Texas.
Um,

872
00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:06.670
but I just saw the highlights so I didn't hear when they blew the whistle or

873
00:53:06.671 --> 00:53:09.570
what happened.
I don't know if the refs fucked up like that,
but uh,

874
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:13.310
it seemed like Texas totally get fucked over on that one.
So anyway,

875
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:17.010
so let me get to the uh,
the questions here for this week.
Um,

876
00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:18.930
<v 0>okay.</v>

877
00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:23.140
<v 1>All right.
Where were the questions?
Content for this week.
All right.</v>

878
00:53:23.141 --> 00:53:24.430
Weight loss and nutrition.

879
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:25.630
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

880
00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:26.860
<v 1>Hey Bill,
a little tip for you.</v>

881
00:53:26.861 --> 00:53:30.580
Healthy Nutrition program preparation to do this special out too.

882
00:53:30.581 --> 00:53:34.300
I could use all the help I could get dude,
48 some motherfucker,
man.

883
00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:36.063
Um,

884
00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:40.330
on your last podcast you mentioned during that first week of a healthy diet,

885
00:53:40.331 --> 00:53:42.850
you can lose a lot of weight,
I think in kilograms.

886
00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:47.530
I don't know how much you've lost,
uh,
lost in pounds,
ears.
Here's the tip.

887
00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:52.120
You are indeed able to lose a lot of weight during the first week,
but it's not,

888
00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:55.330
but it is not fat.
It's just water.

889
00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:59.680
What happens is while you're eating unhealthy,
your body absorbs a lot of water.

890
00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:02.290
If you eat carbs,
pastas,
rice,
potatoes,
fruits,

891
00:54:02.291 --> 00:54:07.120
your body will keep on absorbing water,
uh,
or make you look and feel bigger,

892
00:54:07.121 --> 00:54:09.970
which is good when you're building muscle.

893
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:13.420
If you want to look good on your special cut carbs a little bit,

894
00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:16.180
but eat vegetables and meat a few times a day,

895
00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:20.920
your bottle will be forced to burn fat and it will not absorb so much water.

896
00:54:20.921 --> 00:54:25.540
You can lose a lot quickly.
I hope it helps.
Love to show an Antwerp,

897
00:54:25.541 --> 00:54:26.500
go fuck yourself.

898
00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:31.420
Polish guy working in Luxembourg and living in Belgium.
Okay.

899
00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:34.840
Um,
all right.
I'll give the kind of sounds like the Atkins Diet,

900
00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:37.390
which I always get worried about like a,

901
00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:39.493
<v 0>you know,</v>

902
00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:43.980
<v 1>I guess I'll just eat healthy.
I just remember when the Atkins Diet came out.</v>

903
00:54:43.981 --> 00:54:44.450
People like Doh,

904
00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:48.540
Jack can eat bacon all day and I keep losing weight and it's like,
dude,

905
00:54:48.541 --> 00:54:50.760
you're not going to want to look at your plumbing after that one.

906
00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.520
I can eat bacon all day.
All right,
new car.

907
00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:56.640
But now there's this new diet where people are just like,
it's just sugar,

908
00:54:56.641 --> 00:54:59.490
cut out sugar and flour and then you can drink butter.

909
00:54:59.491 --> 00:55:03.120
I drink butter in the morning and it helps me burn fat.
This is whole new thing.

910
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:07.950
Who the fuck knows?
Like literally like how to lose weight is like,
you know,

911
00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.930
it's like religions,
you know what I mean?

912
00:55:09.931 --> 00:55:14.040
Every fucking one of them has some Zany fucking way,

913
00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:18.660
but they all basically go to the same thing that you go to heaven and heaven I

914
00:55:18.661 --> 00:55:22.290
guess is losing your fucking weight in this shit.
But I have no idea.
Anyways,

915
00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:26.970
new Carlin Album,
dear Billy yogurt legs.

916
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Are you excited for this new Carland album?
I haven't even heard about it.

917
00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:33.120
Oh yeah.
Wait a minute.
I did here.
They thought it was too harsh.

918
00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:37.110
He recorded it before nine 11 and they didn't release it because it had material

919
00:55:37.111 --> 00:55:40.200
that was definitely not appropriate for what was going on at the time.

920
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:44.160
I've heard great things,
but who knows.
Thanks for the laughs.
Oh,
absolutely.

921
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:49.590
When is it coming out?
I got to buy that on vinyl.
Um,

922
00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:52.860
I'm absolutely excited about that.
He is a,

923
00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:57.080
I mean,
as far as greatest of all time.

924
00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:02.180
I have Richard Pryor and George Carlin just for their bodies of work and how,

925
00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:06.560
you know,
they truly took everything.
Lenny Bruce,
Mort,

926
00:56:06.561 --> 00:56:11.540
Saul and all those guys did before them.
Woody Allen,
Bill Cosby,

927
00:56:11.541 --> 00:56:15.080
and they just took it into the modern era.
Um,

928
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.790
<v 0>yeah.</v>

929
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:19.970
<v 1>And kind of like,
I don't know that anybody has really gone beyond it.</v>

930
00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:24.010
Like they just sort of,
they just blow

931
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.800
<v 0>it wide open.
I just don't feel like you can do it better than those guys.</v>

932
00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:31.000
All right.
Hillary Clinton.
Hey Bill.
A legit question.

933
00:56:31.001 --> 00:56:34.780
Do you think Hillary Clinton is healthy enough to be president?
Yes.

934
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:39.370
She seems like she's in really rough shape now.
She,
they just overreacting.

935
00:56:39.371 --> 00:56:42.370
She gets,
she fucking,
she's running for president for a year and a half.

936
00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:47.400
She's under tremendous amount of fucking stress that's going to happen.

937
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:48.580
All right.
Don't you think?

938
00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:52.600
Don't you remember the time fucking Bush the first Bush like puked on himself

939
00:56:52.601 --> 00:56:57.450
and did a fucking face plant when he was in Japan?
He was fine.
Um,

940
00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:00.070
don't you think if Gary Johnson got on the debates,

941
00:57:00.071 --> 00:57:02.200
it would steer things in the right direction.

942
00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:04.750
Now it would probably give Trump the white house.

943
00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:08.410
He lines up with Bernie on 80 per 3% of his views.

944
00:57:08.411 --> 00:57:09.850
But because he's a libertarian,

945
00:57:09.851 --> 00:57:14.620
the youth won't jump on board like they did Bernie and he has a legit shot at

946
00:57:14.621 --> 00:57:18.040
winning.
Only 4% of the u s voted in the primaries.

947
00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:21.820
I checked all these stats,
so go ahead and call me out if you want.
Not on,

948
00:57:21.821 --> 00:57:25.720
I can't because I don't check any stats.
It's your tendency to call out stats.

949
00:57:25.721 --> 00:57:28.690
So I've made sure to look them up.
I think Hillary has been in,
uh,

950
00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:32.500
in the game too long and it's just torn her body apart.

951
00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:37.420
And also what do you think about Colin powers saying that Bill Clinton has been

952
00:57:37.421 --> 00:57:41.450
dicking Bimbos all over the house in a leaked email?
Uh,

953
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:45.320
well that's not surprising.
I mean,
everybody knew that.
Okay.

954
00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:47.340
<v 1>Everybody knows that.</v>

955
00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:48.520
<v 0>Okay.</v>

956
00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:50.170
<v 1>Everybody knows that about that guy.</v>

957
00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:55.480
And that's why Hillary Clinton is just fucking weird to me.

958
00:57:55.481 --> 00:57:58.000
The fact that she's still with the guy because you know what,
you know,

959
00:57:58.001 --> 00:58:03.001
it's a business relationship and that has that I will fucking do anything like

960
00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:09.760
Hillary Clinton in different areas is just as terrifying is Trump.

961
00:58:09.761 --> 00:58:11.380
But I dunno,

962
00:58:11.381 --> 00:58:14.830
just this overt fucking racist group of people.

963
00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:17.860
And the fact that the yelling out the n word,

964
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:19.583
<v 0>uh,</v>

965
00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:22.340
<v 1>you know,
at Trump rallies,</v>

966
00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:26.540
at least they have it on video that that happened and Trump never fucking

967
00:58:26.541 --> 00:58:30.620
addressed it is really,
uh,
it's just,

968
00:58:30.621 --> 00:58:34.790
I could never get behind that guy.
Um,
it's just too fucking,

969
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:38.480
it's just,
it's too fucking depressing watching people.

970
00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:43.740
Did you,
did you hear that?
I've fucked dead and we're that fucking guy.

971
00:58:43.741 --> 00:58:44.840
And it's just like,
dude,

972
00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:49.410
like the level of intellect that Obama has versus what you have,

973
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:51.960
the fact that you'd sit there and try to reduce them like that,

974
00:58:51.961 --> 00:58:54.570
it's just so fucking pathetic and sad.

975
00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:57.540
And the fact that now that those kinds of people feel it,
they have,

976
00:58:57.990 --> 00:59:02.400
they have a fucking voice and God knows I'm not just singling out that one guy.

977
00:59:02.401 --> 00:59:07.401
Cause you go on any youtube video that remotely has anybody who isn't fucking

978
00:59:08.341 --> 00:59:13.230
white in it and you can't go more than fucking scroll down one page before it

979
00:59:13.231 --> 00:59:15.840
turns into this horrific.
Like I just,

980
00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:19.530
I just for the life of me don't understand why people are racist.
I just don't,

981
00:59:19.531 --> 00:59:22.010
I don't get it.
I don't just,
I'm not saying that you

982
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:25.430
<v 5>don't have fucking racist thoughts,
you know,</v>

983
00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.280
as far as I do them too in this bit,
now I'm kind of going to burn it.

984
00:59:28.281 --> 00:59:31.970
He just like late at night that basically I'm a cool guy when the sun's up and

985
00:59:31.971 --> 00:59:34.670
when the sun goes down,
the fear comes up,
you start thinking,

986
00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:37.490
you start making snap judgments,
you know what I mean?

987
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:41.120
Everybody,
there's nobody.
Mother Teresa,

988
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:44.930
if she was scared with would think something fucked up that if it was actually

989
00:59:44.931 --> 00:59:47.690
spoken,
she would own somebody in apologize,
apology.

990
00:59:47.691 --> 00:59:50.360
And I think everybody fucking does it on,
on all sites.

991
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:53.360
<v 4>Um,
but like,
I dunno</v>

992
00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:55.980
<v 5>to sit there and think like,
yeah,</v>

993
00:59:55.981 --> 00:59:59.010
I'm going to type this and hit send and send this hateful fucking shit.

994
00:59:59.011 --> 01:00:03.240
I don't know.
I find it incredibly depressing where if you,

995
01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:06.770
if you're a standup comedian or if you're in,
um,

996
01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:13.960
any sort of show business year in anything,
boy,
you travel
all right.

997
01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:18.290
And you get to meet all different kinds of people.
You definitely get like a,

998
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:20.920
like almost like that astronaut experience.
You know,

999
01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:24.010
like when they fly around and they get to stand back and look at the globe and

1000
01:00:24.011 --> 01:00:29.000
see how beautiful it is.
And then,
you know,
when they land they like start crying.

1001
01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:30.070
It like a stoplight.

1002
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:35.380
Comedians get like sort of the same thing as you get to travel around and you

1003
01:00:35.381 --> 01:00:39.850
get to meet all these people and then,
you know,
you meet all these cool people,

1004
01:00:39.851 --> 01:00:42.910
but then you meet those people that never leave where they're from and then

1005
01:00:42.911 --> 01:00:45.560
their worldview,
you just want to be like,
it's,
it's not like that dude.

1006
01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:46.403
You just need to,

1007
01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:48.203
<v 4>you know,</v>

1008
01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:50.520
<v 5>it's overwhelmingly fucking,</v>

1009
01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:53.590
at least that's been my experience and it's fucking overwhelmingly depressing.

1010
01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:55.203
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1011
01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:59.190
<v 5>Oh Man.
I got into it with somebody in Durham.
It came backstage,
dude,</v>

1012
01:00:59.191 --> 01:01:00.960
it was fucking hilarious.

1013
01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.680
<v 4>And,
uh,
uh,</v>

1014
01:01:06.570 --> 01:01:08.100
oh my God,
I just,
that guy off

1015
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:11.470
<v 5>he goes,
well,
I'll just,
I wanted me to say what you're talking about.
It was,</v>

1016
01:01:11.471 --> 01:01:13.720
how do you know,
how do you know I haven't had that experience?
And I said,

1017
01:01:13.721 --> 01:01:16.360
I could tell by your shirt.
And he just goes,
fuck you.

1018
01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:21.760
I got all fucking mad.
And just to be honest,

1019
01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:24.730
I wasn't shitting on the guide like the money he was making,

1020
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:28.060
but I was talking about like being

1021
01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:29.453
<v 4>uh,</v>

1022
01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:33.560
<v 5>like doing business for the United States in a foreign country.
Okay.</v>

1023
01:01:33.561 --> 01:01:36.560
Being like a diplomat and that type of thing,
like that level thing.

1024
01:01:36.561 --> 01:01:39.320
And this guy showed up in these fucking,

1025
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.780
this fucking shirt that like anybody who makes $40 a week,

1026
01:01:44.781 --> 01:01:46.950
this thing would be retired to the back of the closet.

1027
01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.320
He just show he just had the worst fucking shirt ever.
Uh,
angry,

1028
01:01:51.350 --> 01:01:55.580
angry motherfucker.
And I knew when the second he fucking walked in,

1029
01:01:55.581 --> 01:02:00.400
I fucking knew it when he goes like,
hey,
you really came down on the south,

1030
01:02:00.401 --> 01:02:02.420
you really came down in the south.
They said,
no,
it's was fucking around.

1031
01:02:02.421 --> 01:02:04.370
I love it down here.
So he immediately was doing that.

1032
01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:08.780
And then at some point when I was just chilling and just talking and he's gone,

1033
01:02:08.781 --> 01:02:12.320
you know,
he goes,
you're a gear.
He goes,
you're a good guy.
You know?
I like,

1034
01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:15.080
I like meeting good people.
I like meeting good people.

1035
01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:20.040
That is code for this guy's feeling you out to

1036
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.180
<v 1>eventually say something racist amongst white people.
I like meeting good people.</v>

1037
01:02:24.181 --> 01:02:27.120
Like,
what the fuck is that?
Oh really?
I like meeting bad.

1038
01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:30.030
I like meeting good people,
you know?
And then,
then it gradually,

1039
01:02:30.031 --> 01:02:33.600
then they go a little for good Christian people,
white people.

1040
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:35.850
My Nia said last night,
she goes,

1041
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.510
people who stand up during the national anthem and just it gradually,

1042
01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:40.980
they're feeling you out.

1043
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:41.950
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1044
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:44.740
<v 1>You know,
they've had a couple of pops a,</v>

1045
01:02:44.741 --> 01:02:47.410
can I fucking drop a couple of n bombs around you?

1046
01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.033
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1047
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:51.390
<v 1>And I like meeting good people.</v>

1048
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:56.220
I felt like I was on the 700 club.
I was like,
dude,

1049
01:02:56.221 --> 01:02:58.440
you gotta get the fuck away from me.
All right.

1050
01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:01.080
And you know what I literally said to the guy was like,
dude,

1051
01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:04.950
you're fucking scare in me.
You see I got that.
You're making me fucking nervous.

1052
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:07.950
And he kind of like backed off or whatever.
And then by the end of it,
you know,

1053
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:11.070
I made the mistake,

1054
01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.150
I want to say I brought up politics and then it just went down that fucking
road.

1055
01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:19.710
And then I just literally,
I ended up tapping out.
I just got to the point,

1056
01:03:19.711 --> 01:03:21.750
I was like,
dude,
we're not going to agree.
This is stupid.
All right,

1057
01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:25.350
I don't want to do this.
All right,
you just got mad.
I don't want to do this.

1058
01:03:25.351 --> 01:03:28.620
And then he tried to be like,
I am sad.
But you know what I liked about the guy?

1059
01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:33.030
I could see he was trying not to be a complete fucking lunatic.
But Dude,

1060
01:03:33.031 --> 01:03:36.920
I'm telling you this guy was wound tight.
This Gal with Y,
alright,

1061
01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:41.960
fuck fiance breaks it off.
Well you know something as much,

1062
01:03:41.961 --> 01:03:44.090
I don't even know what we need to read any further.

1063
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:45.920
Thank God this person did that.

1064
01:03:45.921 --> 01:03:49.100
Then before you had to give away half of your shit.
Oh,

1065
01:03:49.101 --> 01:03:51.710
you had a kid and then you got this person had to be in your life for the rest

1066
01:03:51.711 --> 01:03:56.330
of your life.
Okay.
A Rouge Rouge tinted William,

1067
01:03:57.770 --> 01:04:00.680
my fiance,
was a bit of a case,
uh,

1068
01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:05.060
raised in an odd Christian cult,
escaped it,
uh,

1069
01:04:05.061 --> 01:04:09.110
in high school.
Spent most of her adult life working to support her family.

1070
01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.910
That was still in the cult.

1071
01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.153
<v 4>Wow.</v>

1072
01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:19.600
<v 1>Eight years ago,
she met me six years ago.
We started a relationship.</v>

1073
01:04:20.050 --> 01:04:21.310
It had its ups and downs,

1074
01:04:21.311 --> 01:04:25.420
and it was very loving and help change both of us for the better.
A year ago,

1075
01:04:25.421 --> 01:04:30.421
I finally proposed to her after we both became financially successful enough to

1076
01:04:31.061 --> 01:04:34.630
support our own household.
Uh,
okay.
So you both on equal ground.
That's good.

1077
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:39.280
Shortly after that,
she lost one of her close friends then,

1078
01:04:39.281 --> 01:04:41.260
or grandfather.
Uh,

1079
01:04:41.261 --> 01:04:43.720
we got through it together and I thought it brought us even closer.

1080
01:04:43.721 --> 01:04:45.640
Everything was going peachy.
Right.

1081
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:47.463
<v 4>Well</v>

1082
01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:53.180
<v 1>at this time,
Cleo,
get up here.
Come here.
Get up here.
All right.
Just lay down.</v>

1083
01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:57.770
Fucking relax.
All right,
well,
she fully reconverted.
Okay.

1084
01:04:57.771 --> 01:05:00.110
Everything's going a peachy.
Well,
at this time,

1085
01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:03.740
her family and her call leaders saw an opening and after a month or two she

1086
01:05:03.741 --> 01:05:05.330
started going back to the meetings.

1087
01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:08.750
Since I didn't want to be the closed minded guy and clingy near husband,

1088
01:05:08.751 --> 01:05:11.000
I let her go to those meetings.
Oh God.

1089
01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:15.440
Her beliefs are hers and mine are Mine and everyone's happy,
right?
Well,

1090
01:05:15.441 --> 01:05:17.180
she fully converted back.

1091
01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:22.060
Her family's threatened to shun her unless she married someone of the same faith

1092
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.940
and sensor cult holes

1093
01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:30.770
proselytizing as one of the highest values,
highest virtue.

1094
01:05:30.771 --> 01:05:33.560
She tried to convert me.
I was going to guess that that's what that meant.

1095
01:05:33.561 --> 01:05:37.190
I can't say the word,
which is basically going out and getting more members.

1096
01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:38.110
I told her,

1097
01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:41.720
everyone of my experiences led me to believe that her beliefs weren't right for

1098
01:05:41.721 --> 01:05:43.940
me and a relatable at all to me.

1099
01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.900
I didn't see a future where I believed in the same religious things as she did,

1100
01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:52.010
but I did mine not.
I did mine her believing in different things,

1101
01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:54.710
but I didn't mind her believing in different things.
All right,
dude,

1102
01:05:54.711 --> 01:05:57.890
you've been totally honest.
You've,
you've handled this perfectly like a champ.

1103
01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.760
Then a month she called the wedding off and broke it off with me.

1104
01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:07.040
So I did the Duke thing,
drank,
worked out,
picked up new hobbies,

1105
01:06:07.610 --> 01:06:11.930
hobbies,
sorry.
I was thinking horse,
hobbies,
hobbies,

1106
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:16.250
and vacation in the country.
Halfway,
uh,
half the world away.

1107
01:06:16.550 --> 01:06:19.490
I was relaxing on the beach and said country.

1108
01:06:19.491 --> 01:06:24.200
When someone from her cult approaches me and tries to convert me.

1109
01:06:24.201 --> 01:06:27.530
What the fuck?
Yeah.
What role you were in a different country.

1110
01:06:28.890 --> 01:06:29.680
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1111
01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:33.550
<v 1>How do I get over the love of my life while still staying true to my,</v>

1112
01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:37.690
to myself.
You're freckled cont thanks and go fuck yourself.

1113
01:06:37.691 --> 01:06:41.170
Visit Western Canada sometime soon.
A dude,

1114
01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:45.280
she did you a favor,
man.
She did you a fucking favor.

1115
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:47.700
Get away from that Shit,
man.
I was like,

1116
01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:51.510
you can't be with somebody where their religious,

1117
01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:54.520
what their religion is telling them who to love.
All right.

1118
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:58.440
Her now trying to get you convert is because she still loves you and that type

1119
01:06:58.441 --> 01:06:59.520
of thing.
So,
yeah,

1120
01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:04.200
I think your best case scenario of trying to get this woman back is to just

1121
01:07:04.201 --> 01:07:08.310
completely cut her out of your life.
Just ignore and get on with your life.

1122
01:07:08.311 --> 01:07:11.610
Who knows?
You might find someone else first.

1123
01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:16.830
It'd be I want to be with this person or she'll just finally be so fucking

1124
01:07:16.831 --> 01:07:20.730
miserable in that and realize that happiness she had with you and she'll go to

1125
01:07:20.731 --> 01:07:22.980
you,
but you can't go to her.
Cause if you go to her,

1126
01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:26.100
you're going to come off week and she's going to try to drag you down into the

1127
01:07:26.101 --> 01:07:29.370
fucking dark waters of that fucking cult.

1128
01:07:29.371 --> 01:07:33.270
So I say you get on with your life.
All right?
That's the best,

1129
01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.320
best case scenario for you to meet somebody new.
And,
uh,

1130
01:07:37.321 --> 01:07:42.060
that's the way you get over.
Just get on with your life,
you know,
and uh,
you know,

1131
01:07:42.061 --> 01:07:43.950
when you love somebody,
it doesn't totally go away,

1132
01:07:43.951 --> 01:07:48.870
but it definitely fades like a fucking old tattoo.
All right?
Um,

1133
01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:53.840
you know,
that's,
that's the best you can do.
You'll be fine,
man.

1134
01:07:53.841 --> 01:07:56.930
You'll meet somebody else and you know,
who knows dude,

1135
01:07:56.931 --> 01:07:58.820
even if she did fucking leave,
you know,
did you,

1136
01:07:58.821 --> 01:08:02.630
did you really want to be sitting there?
You know,
one morning you wake up,

1137
01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:05.450
the sun's coming up through your window when you look out and there's like a

1138
01:08:05.451 --> 01:08:09.430
couple of cold people standing there,
you know,
freaking yeah,

1139
01:08:09.431 --> 01:08:13.160
we just want to talk to her.
You don't need the Manson family.

1140
01:08:13.161 --> 01:08:17.930
No one where the fuck you are in approaching
Jesus Christ.
Dude,

1141
01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:23.450
please tell me.
I mean
sitting on a beach and denim,
that's like,

1142
01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.630
that's like invasion of the body snatchers.
Alright.

1143
01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:31.250
Greece in retirement.
Hey there,
Billy baklava,

1144
01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:35.210
my wife and I just got back from our honeymoon and grease up.
Congratulations.

1145
01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:39.070
Did you go to Santa Rini?
I hear it is fucking incredible.
Uh,
is that how you say,

1146
01:08:39.150 --> 01:08:42.740
ah,
we've never been there but we,
but knew we'd love it.

1147
01:08:42.741 --> 01:08:44.780
So we made sure to stay for a couple of weeks.

1148
01:08:44.781 --> 01:08:48.590
While there we were listening to your podcast and our balcony drinking wine and

1149
01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:52.100
you mentioned something about health and weight as you usually do.

1150
01:08:52.101 --> 01:08:56.920
And it made me think about how Greece was really put on earth for Bill Burr.

1151
01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:00.290
If you get to the right spot,
Bill,
I'm telling you,
the food is fresh,

1152
01:09:00.291 --> 01:09:01.400
the air is amazing,

1153
01:09:01.401 --> 01:09:06.401
and there's so much walking and feeling all good and feeling all around good.

1154
01:09:07.101 --> 01:09:09.830
Sorry.
Uh,
I think you'd really enjoy the pace here.

1155
01:09:09.831 --> 01:09:12.620
I know you just got back from Capri.
Uh,

1156
01:09:12.621 --> 01:09:15.410
but you should consider grease to next time you go away with Nia.

1157
01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:19.220
My wife and I already want to retire here in 20 years where 30,

1158
01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:23.540
uh,
you're going to retire in 20 years.
Jesus,

1159
01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:25.580
that's amazing.
Uh,

1160
01:09:25.581 --> 01:09:28.250
I hope you make it and hope you never hurt anybody to get there but help you

1161
01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:33.140
make it.
Uh,
would you ever leave the states?
If we have kids,
it may be difficult,

1162
01:09:33.141 --> 01:09:38.050
but we maintain some sub,
some semblance of a plan.
It could happen,

1163
01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:42.700
happened and he thoughts in the pros or cons of that?
Um,

1164
01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:47.240
well the thing about when you leave the good Ole USA is you're leaving the good

1165
01:09:47.241 --> 01:09:51.560
ole USA to great fucking country and I love it.
Um,
and secondly,

1166
01:09:51.561 --> 01:09:54.290
wherever you go,
you're always going to be considered a foreigner.

1167
01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:58.580
And people don't mind tell tourists when you come over there and you're spending

1168
01:09:58.581 --> 01:09:58.881
money,

1169
01:09:58.881 --> 01:10:03.290
but now when you're not leaving and you're taking jobs away from other people,

1170
01:10:03.291 --> 01:10:07.280
all of a sudden the Trump people over there don't like you and you're going to

1171
01:10:07.281 --> 01:10:09.890
have to deal with that and your kids are going to have to deal with that.
Uh,

1172
01:10:09.891 --> 01:10:13.730
so I dunno,
I would continue to visit.
That's what I would do.

1173
01:10:13.731 --> 01:10:16.310
But I'm not telling you what to do either.
You know what I mean?

1174
01:10:16.311 --> 01:10:20.150
If you want to fucking live over there,
if I was going to live anywhere,

1175
01:10:20.151 --> 01:10:25.151
I would live in France and I would live just outside of Paris.

1176
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:27.500
It's someplace quiet.

1177
01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:30.690
<v 4>And I would,
um,</v>

1178
01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.930
<v 1>I would become totally fluent,
but I would miss,</v>

1179
01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:41.030
I would miss the United States.
I mean,
I love it here,
man.
I mean,

1180
01:10:41.031 --> 01:10:45.260
I'm not like you,
you,
you could go live somewhere else.
I can't.
Um,

1181
01:10:45.650 --> 01:10:48.500
so yeah,
I mean,
if the,
if that feels right,
there's a lot of people that do it.

1182
01:10:48.501 --> 01:10:50.180
You know,
people moved down to Costa Rica,

1183
01:10:50.650 --> 01:10:54.960
a lot of conspiracy theorist and that type of shit.
So,
um,
I dunno,

1184
01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:57.740
but Greece has definitely,
Greece and Spain are definitely on the list.

1185
01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:02.360
I'd like to see as many places as I possibly can,
um,

1186
01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:07.760
in my lifetime if that's possible.
Cleo,
knock it off.

1187
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:08.623
Hello.

1188
01:11:09.690 --> 01:11:10.523
<v 4>Oh,
okay.</v>

1189
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:16.860
<v 5>Jesus Christ.
When she fucked him,
puts the bad air ups barriers up.</v>

1190
01:11:16.861 --> 01:11:21.570
I get all nervous.
Um,
hey,

1191
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:24.560
you're going to take her out.
Oh,

1192
01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:28.480
well Chloe,
I'll look at you did.
All right.
And yeah,

1193
01:11:28.481 --> 01:11:31.650
I got to wrap this thing up and then I got to go to work.
Um,
all right,

1194
01:11:31.651 --> 01:11:35.790
I got to read a couple of advertisings here.
Everybody all simply safe.
Everybody.

1195
01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:39.450
Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day.

1196
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:43.380
And the home security industry wants you to believe it's your only option.

1197
01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.950
They have hoards of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of

1198
01:11:46.951 --> 01:11:51.210
their longterm contracts.
You get stuck writing huge checks month after month.

1199
01:11:51.211 --> 01:11:54.890
No way out.
It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands,

1200
01:11:55.050 --> 01:11:59.280
but there's a better way to protect your home.

1203
01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:12.060

1204
01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:14.430
That's less than half of what most companies charge.

1205
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.450

lastly,

1210
01:12:33.931 --> 01:12:37.620
but not leastly stamps.com trips to the post office.

1211
01:12:37.621 --> 01:12:39.570
It probably becomes second nature to you.

1212
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:43.290
They seem easy because you've been doing them doing your mailing and shipping

1213
01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:47.130
that way for so long.
But think about all the hassles,
man.

1214
01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:51.090
Dropping what you're doing,
driving,
they're finding parking,

1215
01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:55.830
the long line,
all of that shit.
Trying to,
Oh,
you put it in the wrong box.

1216
01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:59.810
This is priority,
not express,
waiting,
all of that shit.

1217
01:12:59.811 --> 01:13:03.690
There's a much better way to do it and that stamps.com stamps.com is the
easiest,
