1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.220
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:05.580
It's bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday.

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.110
Fucking June 27th June.

4
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.040
What stuff?
What happened to this month?
My goodness.

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.170
Where's it go?
And you know what?
I think July 18th.
That's my hat.

6
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.993
<v 1>Oh fuck.</v>

7
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.620
<v 0>July teeth.
I think we'll be wrapped.</v>

8
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.680
We'll be done with the writing of the 10 episodes ofF is for family.

9
00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:35.650
Then all we got to do is look at the drawings and edit them for the next fucking

10
00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:36.484
10 months.

11
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.520
<v 1>Ooh.</v>

12
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.570
<v 0>But the heavy lifting will be out of the way.
Um,</v>

13
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.020
would you guys like to know on an animated show works well?

14
00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:47.440
You sit in a room and you'd come up with fucking whatever.
Yeah.

15
00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:49.660
You have figured out how the whole season's going to go.

16
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.710
Then you fucking write it and then it changes like 50 fucking times.
You rewrite,

17
00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:56.890
you rewrite,
you rewrite your record.
You're right.
Boy,
you do table reads,

18
00:00:56.891 --> 00:00:59.830
you do all this fucking shit.
Then once you get all of that done,

19
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.990
what starts coming in as the animatics,

20
00:01:01.991 --> 00:01:06.610
which is basically the rough drawings of a,
of the shit,

21
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.630
you know that you recorded and then you say,
ah,
you know,

22
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.830
why is he standing next to that chair is she'd be over in the kitchen.

23
00:01:14.831 --> 00:01:17.560
You got to do all of that shit is he's not moving enough,

24
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.920
having take his glasses off day or a heaven to fucking be.

25
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.920
You got to do all of that and then they fucking draw it and then you look at it

26
00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:29.260
and then it still might not be funny.
And then you gotta be like,

27
00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:30.640
all right is what we wrote.

28
00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:35.440
Not Funny or is the way it's executed here?
Not fighting that.

29
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.240
That's why it takes so fucking long in case you're wondering,
cause you're like,

30
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:41.950
well shit,
you record it.
I mean you wrote them.

31
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.750
Why don't they just take out some magic maracas and fucking put him on a piece

32
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:50.320
of paper and then somebody stands there and they flip through it like they used

33
00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:53.560
to in the old days they used to do,
they'd have somebody,

34
00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:57.970
a the village idiot go up on stage with a giant fucking notebook and he'd sit

35
00:01:57.971 --> 00:02:01.240
there going,
just going through the thing.

36
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.350
And people would sit there and they enjoy it.
And if the guy screwed up,
they uh,

37
00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:08.100
they shot him because everybody had guns back then.
Lisa,

38
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:11.140
I the way it was in America,
um,

39
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.410
speaking of of America,
what's going on in Ireland,

40
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.440
I decided I was going to start looking to see what the fuck is going on in these

41
00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:21.970
countries.
So I'm going to be going to a evidentaly mot know Neil Martin O'Neill,

42
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.810
the Republic of Ireland,
Martin O'neill there,
there,
bill Belicheck.

43
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.060
He's fucking pissed because Ireland just lost a French.
It's some gay boy.

44
00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:33.910
You're not allowed to pick the ball up with the hands for whatever fucking

45
00:02:33.911 --> 00:02:34.690
reason.
You know,

46
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.780
you'd figure if you're only allowed to use your feet or your hands,

47
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.900
or let's say you use your fucking hands.
I mean,

48
00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:44.530
there's no style of fighting where you just use your feet,
right?

49
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.610
Maybe Tae Kwan Doe,
but they don't,
you know,
if you fucking come at them,

50
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.900
they're still going to punch you in the nose,
right.
I just don't understand it.

51
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.660
I'm fucking with you.
It's actually,
it's a beautiful game.
I,

52
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.500
I went in to get my head fucking shaved the other day.
Now what?

53
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:01.600
To this blob of shop or a real barber shop.

54
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:05.020
One where you walk in and there's fucking men in there.
Right?

55
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.030
Rubbing the hairy chest.
And I'm kidding.

56
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.610
There's men in there and you just fucking go,
Eddie.

57
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.890
You sit down until it's your fucking turn.

58
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.810
Unlike these fucking God damn hipster fucking thinks.

59
00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:17.470
What did they got the little fucking,

60
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.340
what do you call that barbershop little swirl thing that goes around to me that

61
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:24.550
says I can just walk in,
right?
And then you walk in,
there's nobody here.

62
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:27.790
Can you shake my head?
Oh,
do you have an appointment?
Dude,
look at me.

63
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.200
How long is it going to fucking take?

64
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.650
You don't want to make an extra fucking 20 bucks,
Huh?
You down?

65
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:35.210
I can go fuck yourself.
You know,

66
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.440
you fucking 28th president of the United States fucking haircut.

67
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.460
Who is that by the way?
Who was the 28th president?

68
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:49.660
Nobody ever talks about the 28th presence.
Let's look it up.
Let's look it up.

69
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.240
Uh,
28 president.
If I,
if I had to guess,
I'm going to say Grover Cleveland.

70
00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.070
Uh,
28th,
President Calvin Coolidge.

71
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.890
Oh,
ah,
oh,

72
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.700
the content self.
Woodrow Wilson,
Woodrow Wilson,

73
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:13.420
who signed the fucking Federal Reserve Act and a,

74
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:16.250
and we're all still paying for it today.
You know,

75
00:04:16.251 --> 00:04:19.330
what's a good one to look up Woodrow Wilson's letter of regret?

76
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.990
What are the fucking odds I would've said that sent me down this conspiracy

77
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:27.610
theory.
Woodrow Wilson Letter of regret.

78
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.380
All right,
where is it?
Where is it?
Did Wilson,

79
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.130
did Woodrow Wilson regret handing America

80
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.680
to the Federal Reserve?
Woodrow Wilson,
after creating the Federal Reserve,
said,

81
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.350
uh,
let's see.
Here we go.
I have unwittingly ruined my country.

82
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.800
I didn't know how to pronounce that word,
so maybe he didn't.
All right.

83
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:53.920
This is what he wrote.
I am a most unhappy man.
I have unwittingly,

84
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.560
unwittingly ruined my country.

85
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.490
A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit.

86
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.480
Our system of credit is concentrated.
See,
they always got to write it.

87
00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:06.970
So sophisticated,
subsist sophisticatedly.

88
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:09.700
I can't even understand what the fuck they're talking about.
Like that thing.

89
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.350
Dwight d Eisenhower,

90
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:14.680
when he gives that speech about the industrial military complex,

91
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.110
I watch that over and over again.

92
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.200
I have no fucking idea what he's talking about.

93
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.380
Even if it's explained to me before I watched the speech and by the end of it I,

94
00:05:26.671 --> 00:05:30.880
I don't understand it and I feel like he said it that way either because he was

95
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:34.330
so fucking smart.
He couldn't relate to the common man,

96
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.740
which I don't understand because he had all those soldiers or he said it that

97
00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:42.580
way because he had to say it in a way that he wouldn't get off.

98
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.240
Right.
I don't fucking know him.
Anyways,
he said the growth of the nation,

99
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.720
therefore,
and all our activities are in the hands of a few men.

100
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.430
This is a president.
A former president wrote this.
Okay.

101
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.490
So I don't want to hear any guys saying,
oh,
conspiracy theory,
go fuck yourself.

102
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.730
It's just like when I told you that the NBA was fixed and then there was the mob

103
00:06:02.731 --> 00:06:06.260
dup ref,
and you guys all tried to wiggle out of it.
And what did they say?

104
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.780
Oh yeah,
there was just one of them.
Oh yeah.
What's that?

105
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:13.340
There was just one of them.
All right.
We have to come to,

106
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.920
we have come to be one of the worst,
ruled,

107
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:19.790
one of the most completely controlled and dominated governance governments in

108
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:23.390
the civilized world loan longer a government by free opinion.

109
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:26.840
No longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority,

110
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:31.700
but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.

111
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.930
Oh,
there you go.
He still didn't quite fucking say what he did.

112
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:37.783
<v 2>Uh,</v>

113
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.130
<v 0>Jesus Christ.</v>

114
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.200
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

115
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.480
<v 0>Uh,
God,
they got,
they got fucking,
you know what they did?
Woodrow,</v>

116
00:06:45.481 --> 00:06:46.830
they put woody from cheers,

117
00:06:46.831 --> 00:06:50.370
their version of chairs or their version of woody from fucking chairs.

118
00:06:50.371 --> 00:06:53.310
They put them in the office.
Well,
what am I even talking about right now?

119
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.100
I didn't want to talk about this.
I was talking about soccer.

120
00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:59.040
How the fuck do I go from soccer to that?
So anyways,

121
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.470
it's Martin O'Neill who I would not fuck with some of it.

122
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:06.420
An Irish brogue in those fucking glasses.
You're not,
you know,

123
00:07:06.421 --> 00:07:10.510
just somehow tea shop you to the throat.
Um,

124
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.110
he said they got the short end short straw when they played France for whatever

125
00:07:16.111 --> 00:07:17.610
fucking reason.
I never even finished the story.

126
00:07:17.611 --> 00:07:19.940
So I wanted to get my fucking head shaved.
And a,

127
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.790
they had that European champion was a championship,
was on the highlights,

128
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.010
the whole fucking,
the everybody in there was into the game.

129
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.480
So I automatically got into it.

130
00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:30.150
So I hope you guys know I'm just fucking with you when it comes to that.

131
00:07:30.151 --> 00:07:33.810
It's just that when the world loves something,
as a comedian,

132
00:07:33.811 --> 00:07:37.920
it's just so easy to make fun of it and to get the feedback that you want,

133
00:07:37.921 --> 00:07:42.921
which is totally people losing their minds typing at you in all capital letters.

134
00:07:43.201 --> 00:07:46.890
It's just fun.
Um,
so anyways,

135
00:07:46.891 --> 00:07:50.640
for some reason France got an extra three days to rest.
They're tired.

136
00:07:50.641 --> 00:07:51.474
Legs in there,

137
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:55.680
swollen feet before they got to play the little footie game again in Ireland.

138
00:07:55.681 --> 00:08:00.090
Didn't like it.
You know what's funny?
The Guy,
the guy like trashes them and says,

139
00:08:00.091 --> 00:08:04.890
uh,
you know,
they got fucked over three days as an incredible amount of time.

140
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.480
A one side could have as an advantage over another blahblahblahblahblah that

141
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.410
said,
France,
France are really,

142
00:08:13.411 --> 00:08:17.010
really fine team and good luck to them in the tournament.
I love that shit.

143
00:08:17.011 --> 00:08:20.430
After you fucking trash them.
It was completely unfair.
Go Fuck Yourself.

144
00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:24.890
But I haven't said that you got a hell of a team there.
Hawaii.
Chico.

145
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.690
Could she add?
Yeah.
Meaty.
All right.

146
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.970
Irish news headlines March going on an island.

147
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.040
Roy Foster Britain cosigned a margins by the stupid party.

148
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.360
I don't know what that means.
Mary Robinson is,
that's not a real name.

149
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.770
Mary Robinson is that an alias?

150
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.320
Brexit could have a domino effect.
What the fuck is Brexit?

151
00:08:49.321 --> 00:08:50.970
Isn't this shit Trump got in trouble for,

152
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.750
that's what I loved about Trump this week when he fucking went to Scotland and

153
00:08:54.751 --> 00:08:58.140
he goes,
just like Scotland,
we're going to take our country back.

154
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.350
Cause I guess Scotland was voting about whether they still want it to be a part

155
00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:06.351
of the European Union and a Scotland overwhelmingly agreed to stay part of it.

156
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:08.070
Evidently,
I dunno.

157
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.470
And Trump went there and didn't know it and I was reading like what everyone was

158
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:16.800
saying and it was,
you know,
trash and Donald Trump.

159
00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:19.590
And it was so similar to what people write to me every week.

160
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.830
John Salley isn't dead.
You fucking moron.

161
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.470
I said the wrong name.
I didn't mean John.
Sally,
you know what?
What do,

162
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.130
what do you want from me?
All right.
A former president,

163
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.350
president or what?
Mary Robinson.

164
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.820
<v 3>Okay.</v>

165
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.380
<v 0>She was president of Ireland.
You know what?
She's a lovely lady.
I'd vote for her.</v>

166
00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.940
Where the fuck was she president?
Former president.

167
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:53.100
Mary Robinson has said that young people in the UK must feel very let down by

168
00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:56.970
the outcome of the Brexit Brexit model,

169
00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:01.800
the referendum,
and she appealed to the EU to remember its core values.

170
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.580
What other vague shit that she say,
Jesus Christ,

171
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:07.950
can you help out or an American here,
what the fuck's going on over there?

172
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.910
A crisis.
There's some bullshit.
I have to know when I go over there

173
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:14.710
some sort of referendum.

174
00:10:14.711 --> 00:10:18.820
Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the

175
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:23.220
European Union?
What's going on with the European Union?
The EU?
What happened?

176
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.410
You guys formed a super group,
but now all the egos are getting in the way.

177
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:27.641
What happened?

178
00:10:27.641 --> 00:10:31.390
How Greece is fucking economy went down and all of a sudden it's fucking with

179
00:10:31.391 --> 00:10:36.220
you guys.
You never do that.
Never join a fucking group.

180
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:41.740
Take it from a complete loner who does stand up,
right?
You don't join a group.

181
00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.400
You know what I mean?
You use a group.
Okay,
what do you guys do?
Oh yeah,

182
00:10:45.401 --> 00:10:47.710
you cater parties.
All right,
I'm having a party.

183
00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.800
I don't want to join your party operation.

184
00:10:50.801 --> 00:10:52.590
I'd like you to come over here and a tie,

185
00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:54.450
some balloons to some fucking lampposts.

186
00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:59.170
Could you do that and how much would that cost and here's your check and get out

187
00:10:59.171 --> 00:11:03.640
of my life.
That's how you do it.
Why the fuck would you agree?

188
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.310
It's actually amazing that they got it done.
You don't want,
I mean,

189
00:11:08.311 --> 00:11:10.920
considering all the fucking wars they've had over the years,

190
00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:12.783
<v 3>you know,</v>

191
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.620
<v 0>fascism,
communism,
fucking,
whatever the fuck we're called.</v>

192
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.420
I don't know what the fuck we are.

193
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:23.530
<v 3>Hmm?</v>

194
00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.780
<v 0>How the fuck did they do all that know?
Why did they do all that?</v>

195
00:11:25.781 --> 00:11:27.280
That just all comes down to bankers.

196
00:11:27.281 --> 00:11:32.050
What was wrong with having the pound and then the fucking Ireland had the

197
00:11:32.051 --> 00:11:35.860
Shillay Lee,
right?
What they have in Sweden,

198
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.320
I don't know what the fuck they had.
Some sort of thing.

199
00:11:38.321 --> 00:11:42.250
A little idea of design the way little sphincter.
I don't fucking know.

200
00:11:42.251 --> 00:11:45.650
I don't understand why everybody has to get in bed with everybody else is going

201
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.860
to be better.
It's going to create more jobs.
No,
it isn't.
No,
it isn't.

202
00:11:47.861 --> 00:11:50.140
It's just going to make the people at the top make more fucking money.

203
00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.630
It's just like,
you know,
can we have more people to fucking the ass?

204
00:11:52.631 --> 00:11:55.960
Can we have of your people one of four we would've.
He combined all the people,

205
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.230
right?
We fucking microchip them.
We phased out fucking money.

206
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.440
What if we did that right?
And now,
yeah,

207
00:12:01.441 --> 00:12:03.640
everything's on your little microchip here,
right?

208
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.870
People getting mugged in the future,
it's going to be fucking hilarious.

209
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.830
It's going to be some fucking nerdy kid getting dragged in by a football player

210
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.490
and you're going to grab a bunch of Dr Peppers and some fucking Sag nut bars,

211
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:18.730
and then they're going to grab the nerds wrist and fucking just keep swiping it,

212
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:27.460
making them pay for all his shit,
right?
If you're fucking rich,
you're going to,

213
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:29.230
you can't even go out of the fucking house.

214
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.340
Someone's going to grab you and take you to a Lexus dealership.
It's of a fucking

215
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:40.570
grabbed the guy just fucking,
just start scanning of,
oh,
that'd be great.

216
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.410
You know,
it's not going to happen.
They're going to have,

217
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.610
you're gonna have like 50,
oh my God,
this is,

218
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:50.530
this is going to be some shit going down.
If you get,

219
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:54.160
if you're going to have a microchip in your fucking body that has every fucking

220
00:12:54.161 --> 00:12:57.790
cent you ever earned that you didn't blow on fucking bud lights and hookers,

221
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.450
you know,
doesn't that make you like,

222
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:06.820
what's going to stop somebody from just coming up and just sucker punching you

223
00:13:06.821 --> 00:13:11.260
and then carving your fucking microchip out of your arm?
Right.

224
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.100
And then it's like they got an extra life and then they just have this fucking

225
00:13:15.101 --> 00:13:17.260
thing and they just start running around with tweezers,

226
00:13:17.261 --> 00:13:20.620
just scan and a bunch of shit.
Why wouldn't they just,

227
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.370
you know what they're gonna do?
They'll fucking chop your arm off,
right.

228
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.480
And then fucking hide your body.
Okay.
You know,

229
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:32.680
like they used to do that,
like allegedly the,
uh,

230
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:37.450
the westies they chopped some guy's arm off and then they would go around

231
00:13:37.451 --> 00:13:40.270
committing murders and then they'd take the arm out of the fridge and they'd put

232
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:43.960
the fingerprints on the gun and then they just put the arm back in the fridge.

233
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.590
It's if you get past the fucking humanity,
you know,

234
00:13:47.591 --> 00:13:52.591
it's really brilliant and slash borderline fucking hilarious.

235
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.620
Um,
manifest.
Those guys could tell a story.
Jesus Christ,

236
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.980
you know the shit they did horrible shit.
But Jesus,
yeah,

237
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.580
I have to be a funny bastard on some fucking level.

238
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.110
I know you're out of your mind,

239
00:14:08.111 --> 00:14:12.940
but there is something fucking hilarious about that,
you know?

240
00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:14.560
And then the cops that,
you know,

241
00:14:14.561 --> 00:14:16.350
when they were drinking the cops that just select,

242
00:14:16.351 --> 00:14:20.440
that's fucking guys struck again.
You know,
they will laugh and go,
dude,

243
00:14:20.441 --> 00:14:22.450
you realize we're inventing a serial killer.

244
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.150
And they'd all be sitting there laughing their balls off.

245
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.600
And then at some point the laughter would die down is that they then realize

246
00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:32.920
like,
wait a minute,
where we're kind of serial killers while we're all doing it.

247
00:14:32.921 --> 00:14:36.100
It's a group effort.
It's not like it's one person.
So yeah,
you know,

248
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:40.900
whatever order.
Another Jamison.
Um,

249
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:42.431
anyways,

250
00:14:42.431 --> 00:14:45.130
I have no fucking idea what I'm talking about and I have no idea what's going on

251
00:14:45.131 --> 00:14:48.400
in the world and I evidently I need to learn it.
I need to learn it before,

252
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:53.180
you know,
I go to Scotland,
started handing up.
Fuck those signs.
You know,

253
00:14:53.181 --> 00:14:56.690
Trump is a cunt.
I just,
all of that Shit,

254
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.460
Donald Trump is fucking,

255
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:03.100
he's back to being fucking hilarious again to me because I know he's not going

256
00:15:03.101 --> 00:15:06.050
to win.
He's not going to win.
The whole world can fucking relax.

257
00:15:06.051 --> 00:15:08.270
Everybody knows Hillary's getting in.
Okay.

258
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:10.910
And what's funny is everybody's going to relax,
relax.

259
00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:13.040
Like I'll thank God we dodged that fucking bullet.

260
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:18.220
Like Hillary isn't a fucking bankers wet dream coming down like a fucking

261
00:15:18.471 --> 00:15:22.520
freight train.
Um,
now Jesus,
she better not get elected.

262
00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:25.340
I'm getting a fucking audit.
Do you want a times I've trashed her.
Oh my God.

263
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:29.590
Oh God,
that fucking,
oh,

264
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.370
some of the shit I want to say.

265
00:15:31.371 --> 00:15:33.860
I can't fucking say it because in this day and age you just,

266
00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:35.900
you just cannot say that.

267
00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:39.830
You understand why a certain person did what he did.

268
00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:41.991
Um,

269
00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:46.220
age is Christ just coming home to that fucking air raid siren every fuck he can

270
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.870
eat.
Least fucking,
you know,
doll yourself up a little bit.

271
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:54.080
Jesus Christ with the fucking the paper chase.
Look over here.
I mean,
what,
what,

272
00:15:54.081 --> 00:15:58.580
what,
what was the guy's supposed to do?
I'm just kidding.

273
00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.490
Bill Clinton would fuck a hole in a tree

274
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:11.350
and he would do it with his fucking pants down with the fucking secret service

275
00:16:11.751 --> 00:16:14.270
standing with their backs to him like five feet away.

276
00:16:14.271 --> 00:16:17.000
They could literally filling,
don't feel the wind of his hips,
his,

277
00:16:17.001 --> 00:16:22.001
he was pumping the tree guys at animal day in and fucking day out.

278
00:16:22.461 --> 00:16:25.610
That guy is a fucking animal.
God bless.
You know what?
God bless him.

279
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.440
God bless him.
You know,
it's just how he's wired.

280
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.830
Did you guys ever see that episode of cheaters?

281
00:16:33.831 --> 00:16:35.690
Remember that show they'd catch people cheating,
right.

282
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:41.120
And that lady cut the fuck.
Can anybody find this clip from me?
This Liz Lady,

283
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.580
um,
southern Belle,
she catches her fucking redneck guy stepping out on it,

284
00:16:46.581 --> 00:16:50.900
right?
And this fucking guy,
she,
you know,
he was supposed to be embarrassed,

285
00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:51.734
but he was hammered,

286
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:57.540
<v 1>cheesy,
like,
oh my God,
if I can see shit,
I could cheat,
do this.</v>

287
00:16:57.541 --> 00:17:01.560
And she's,
you know,
slapping.
I had a fucking to do this.
And he goes,

288
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:02.723
well honey,

289
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
did it ever dawn on you that maybe just maybe I was tired of fucking you and I

290
00:17:10.351 --> 00:17:12.360
wanted to fuck someone else.

291
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:18.070
<v 0>And he said it.
The wiz delivery of that epic line was just,
it was like,</v>

292
00:17:18.071 --> 00:17:22.330
he was saying like,
like hello.
You know,

293
00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:28.750
fucking get your shit together.
The fucking answers right here.

294
00:17:28.751 --> 00:17:33.130
Like he said,
it was such,
he was putting it on her.
It was,
it was one of the,

295
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:33.993
one of the,

296
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.360
one of the more amazing things I've seen a human being doing that situation,

297
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:42.310
you know what I mean?
Anyways,
let me get back to the fucking,

298
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.060
what's going on here in Scotland?
What's going on here.
Oh,
by the way,
uh,

299
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:50.130
so Belgium has been added.
Germany has been added though.
You know I'm making,

300
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.650
I think that paying me like with a couple of steins of beer,

301
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.940
which I don't give a fuck.
I just want to go over there.
I want to,
I'm that close.

302
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.970
You know I'm going to do Germany,

303
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:05.090
some weird fucking town I never heard of and then I'm driving over to Belgium

304
00:18:05.641 --> 00:18:10.620
and I'm not doing
what the,
I was a fucking capital of Brussels.

305
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:16.800
I don't fuck with it.
No,
it is Brussels.
Right?
A Belgium.
Brussels,
right.
Sorry,

306
00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:19.350
I'm doing like 20 things here.
I just realized I never found out.

307
00:18:19.351 --> 00:18:22.830
Who the Fuck Mary Rob's where?
Jesus Christ.
She must've been a great,

308
00:18:22.831 --> 00:18:26.870
she looks honest as the fucking days long.
Manny.

309
00:18:26.871 --> 00:18:30.500
Robyn said for president.
Oh yeah.

310
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:35.060
Tell you she's cute as a button,
but I wouldn't want to cross hairs.

311
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:38.460
That fucking shit.
Any field.
Is that what you guys said over there?

312
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:43.050
What the fuck is his Shalala bill?
You don't know.
All right.
Mary Robinson.
Matt

313
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.600
may remain re.
Oh Jesus.

314
00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:52.710
That's an unfortunate fucking picture.
Jesus Christ.

315
00:18:52.711 --> 00:18:57.680
Has she ever used conditioner in our life?
Her fucking hair.

316
00:18:57.681 --> 00:19:00.100
It looks like the Hollywood hills.
Right before they catch on fire.

317
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.260
Did the Santa Ana winds come out of her fucking hairdryer?
Oh,

318
00:19:07.261 --> 00:19:09.210
I thought she was dead.
She's not dead.
And she

319
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:11.090
<v 3>okay.</v>

320
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:16.090
<v 0>In office from 1969 to 1989 she's 72 years old.</v>

321
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.150
She's got three k.
Wait a minute.
Where Mary Theresa?
Same.
Hey,

322
00:19:21.151 --> 00:19:26.151
we have here Howard eightish born at 20 fashion at made 1844 he and [inaudible]

323
00:19:27.971 --> 00:19:32.810
into that.
I don't have time to read all of this presidency.

324
00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:33.930
<v 3>Okay.</v>

325
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:35.790
<v 0>All right.
Open the fucking linky account.</v>

326
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.320
Robinson was inaugurated as the seventh president of Ireland.
Well,

327
00:19:40.321 --> 00:19:42.570
how many fucking dumb alone do you stay in office?

328
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:47.650
Seven presidents since caveman days.
Uh,

329
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:51.960
she proved a remarkably popular president earning the praise of Brian Lenahan

330
00:19:51.961 --> 00:19:55.320
himself.
Well,
shit,
if Brian says it well then fuck.
You know,

331
00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:00.960
before his death,
five years later,
sorry,
Brian and the Lenahan film,
uh,

332
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:04.080
said that she was a better president than he ever could have been.
Oh,

333
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:07.780
that was the guy that went after.
Yeah.
Cat Elekta is fucking.
Hi.

334
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.890
All right.
I'm Saturday.
She was great.

335
00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.710
That was every fucking I and over there,

336
00:20:13.711 --> 00:20:18.120
cause she took an office that had a reputation as being little more than a

337
00:20:18.121 --> 00:20:21.720
retirement position for a prominent politician and breathed new life into the

338
00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:24.780
room.
How is that a retirement position?
You're president of Ireland?

339
00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:26.410
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

340
00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.390
<v 0>Oh God.
I got some questions when I get over there.</v>

341
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:30.310
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

342
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:35.300
<v 0>Brian fucking lend a hand.
Let's see what Brian Linehan look like.
Yes,</v>

343
00:20:35.301 --> 00:20:36.020
said,
get oldies.

344
00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.540
You really want to see what people look like to figure out why they died.

345
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:43.660
Brian Linehan,
Brian Linehan.

346
00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:47.370
Let's see what it looks like.
Let's see.
The old gimme,
the
Ah,

347
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.510
you fucking in shape can't come on,
man.

348
00:20:49.511 --> 00:20:53.760
You supposed to have the heart attack face.
Oh,
that's not the guy.

349
00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.250
Cleo,
did you just fart?

350
00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.050
<v 3>Okay.</v>

351
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:02.780
<v 0>I said,
well hang on a second.
What the fuck is,
what the fuck is the guy's name?</v>

352
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:06.980
Brian Linehan.
He died five years.
Actually,

353
00:21:06.981 --> 00:21:10.240
the guy just looked up with some Canada.
I got,

354
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.290
I still have a chance here that this guy was a,
Oh my God.

355
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:20.780
Do I have to hit fucking pause to find this again.
All right.
Presidency,

356
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.210
Brian Linehan.
Alright,
there it is.
Brian Linehan.
Come on.

357
00:21:26.211 --> 00:21:31.211
You can't Ireland a or didn't or he [inaudible].

358
00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:39.470
Okay,
there we go.
Let's see what this fucking did.
Son of a bitch.
Oh,
there it is.

359
00:21:39.471 --> 00:21:43.760
Oh yeah,
that's a heart attack face.
If I ever saw,
I'm saying heart attack,

360
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:45.740
I'm going heart attack.

361
00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:52.420
He died on my birthday was an Irish and a barrister.

362
00:21:53.241 --> 00:21:58.010
What the fuck is that?
Does that mean he sings while he tends bar,
uh,

363
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:04.530
death?
Just get the death died.
Okay.
He died then.
Oh God.

364
00:22:04.531 --> 00:22:08.270
There's been an upbeat disease.
Come on.
I say heart attack,
heart attack.

365
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:12.920
Nice and quick.
Pancreatic cancer.
50 to fuck.

366
00:22:12.921 --> 00:22:14.270
I'm to 48.

367
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:19.560
Jesus Christ or his skin off this fucking subject.

368
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:25.680
Uh,
Micah Dolan's just to the linear hand family.
Anyways,
it's such a fucking,

369
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.180
it's the fucking worst.
I got a buddy of mine,
I,
this is something too,

370
00:22:30.181 --> 00:22:31.890
I'm going to be doing a sh a benefit coming up.

371
00:22:31.891 --> 00:22:34.160
I just have to figure out how to put it together.
Uh,

372
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.730
I got a really good friend of mine.

373
00:22:35.731 --> 00:22:39.510
His wife just got cancer for the second time and they get fucking buried in

374
00:22:39.511 --> 00:22:41.610
bills.
So,
um,

375
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.870
I'm going to put together a show out here in La and uh,

376
00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.850
you know all the proceeds are going to go to that and that's fucking sad.

377
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.560
All right.
I'm sorry.
I thought it was gonna be selling for heart attacks.

378
00:22:52.561 --> 00:22:56.250
Fucking funny.
Right?
You just stand in the hey bill,
you want another reg,

379
00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:01.080
you know actually gloss and just
whenever you drop dead,

380
00:23:01.081 --> 00:23:05.580
people laugh at first cause they think you fucking around.
Like wow man,

381
00:23:05.581 --> 00:23:07.740
he really committed to that fucking face plant.

382
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.150
<v 3>Okay,</v>

383
00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:13.050
<v 0>well right now all of a sudden you just laying them all right,
I'm sorry.</v>

384
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.951
Oh last week.

385
00:23:13.951 --> 00:23:16.740
You know I recommend that you guys go to the all things comedy website,

386
00:23:16.741 --> 00:23:19.170
you know if all these great podcasts and videos and all this shit.

387
00:23:19.171 --> 00:23:22.890
So of course these fucking millennials,
they get there and they just stare at it.

388
00:23:22.891 --> 00:23:24.420
They're fucking overwhelmed.
So they're like,

389
00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:29.220
oh could you please tell me who Coppola podcasts that you arc the movie I could

390
00:23:29.221 --> 00:23:32.510
look at.
Cause I can't do anything.
Most sale.
All right.
Egg

391
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:34.991
last week already.

392
00:23:34.991 --> 00:23:39.940
HSA fear from the skeptic tank podcast did a podcast with comedian.

393
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.840
Uh,
I'm going to butcher this name.
Hormoze.

394
00:23:43.841 --> 00:23:47.540
Rashidi that's how I'm saying it about the Middle East.

395
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:51.950
It's hilarious and informative.
Uh,
this dude was born in Iran.

396
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.150
So rather than listening to bill O'Reilly talk about the Middle East,

397
00:23:56.151 --> 00:24:00.280
even though he's never fucking been there are fucking Wolf fucking blends.

398
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:06.020
All these talking heads with their books,
you know,

399
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.790
and their lines of suits right from the bill.

400
00:24:10.791 --> 00:24:15.210
O'Reilly collection from theW is a wolf blitzer tie,
right?

401
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.320
Whatever the fuck it is that they do to get the XD or extra whore money,

402
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:23.420
you know,
who we think has a better walk in closet.
Bill O'reilly,

403
00:24:23.421 --> 00:24:28.070
a Wolf Blitzer,
you know though,
they're fucking shiny loafers,

404
00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:33.530
you know,
sent.
Just so you know,
all their suits all lined up,

405
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.730
their pocket squares and all of that shit.
You know what I mean?

406
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.980
You fucking take you downstairs to the wine cellar and show you these bottles of

407
00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:46.960
wine.
They'd fucking hundreds of years old.
You see that?
Look at that.
Okay.

408
00:24:46.961 --> 00:24:50.940
Then I get this for lying every day on television and then amazing.
Come on.

409
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.350
He do coke.
You want to do some coke?
All right.
Just,
it was down here.

410
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:57.050
I just figured I'd ask you.
You know,
the wife does.
Wife's got a rule,

411
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.880
no coke on the fucking main floor.
Um,
anyways,

412
00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:06.370
I'll speak to my wife.
Oh,
let me tell me my wife.
It's a rough one.
You know.
Um,

413
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:11.600
I got this new thing that I,
that I'm into,
man.
And uh,

414
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.300
you'd think it wouldn't be a big deal.
I like,
uh,

415
00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:19.640
I like fucking tennis and golf shirts.
I like them.
They're comfortable,

416
00:25:19.641 --> 00:25:21.710
they're breathable.
It's a college shirt.

417
00:25:21.711 --> 00:25:25.220
People let you into restaurants when you wear them and she fucking hates them.

418
00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.260
I liked the izod tennis wear.

419
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.400
So today I'm walking out of the house to go meet a buddy of mine and I got one

420
00:25:31.401 --> 00:25:34.250
of those on and I got these fucking,
uh,

421
00:25:34.251 --> 00:25:37.820
I got these Phil Mickelson shorts,
whatever the fuck they are,
just,

422
00:25:37.821 --> 00:25:42.470
they're just black shorts or whatever.
So as I'm walking out,

423
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.470
I guy Niihau CLS,
she goes,
all right,

424
00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:49.400
she goes until tiger woods.
I said,
what's up?

425
00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:58.700
She fucking hates how I dress.
And this is one of these things where you know,

426
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.390
as much as you want to remain your own person,
when you're in a relationship,

427
00:26:02.391 --> 00:26:05.630
when you've,
the person you fucking says you're not,
you don't look good,

428
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:08.660
it affects you.
But there's some I have,

429
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.240
this is how comfortable these fucking shirts are.

430
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.890
I don't think I give a shit.
I think for the first time ever,

431
00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:20.120
I don't care that my wife doesn't approve of what the fuck I'm wearing.

432
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:26.120
They had that fucking comfortable.
You never have to iron them.
They're great.

433
00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.290
They're fucking great.
So I was,
uh,
I was at the mall there.

434
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.630
Um,
I really should fucking,

435
00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:36.210
this is just like free advertising for all these fucking people.
Um,

436
00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.910
what's the shit that the,
uh,
the honor roll student wears?

437
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:45.110
What's it called?
Bardot and body armor.
Yeah.
We're not taking that shit.

438
00:26:45.111 --> 00:26:49.440
Know her house clothes,
whatever was over the top fucking sports thing.

439
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.510
Armor wear underarm,
whatever the fuck it is.
You know what it is?

440
00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:00.030
Defense shields some fucking space odyssey shit.
You know the fucking thing,

441
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:04.630
the thing that Steph curry wears
under Armour,

442
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:09.390
under Armour.
That's what it is under arms.
Do you own rent bill?
A under Armour,

443
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:14.460
right?
They got some fucking,
they got some great clothes.
So I,

444
00:27:14.461 --> 00:27:17.910
I knew,
I knew she didn't like that shit cause I said to her for my birthday,

445
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.650
I go,
I don't,
I don't fucking either.
You know what I would love to the summer,

446
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:22.800
the summer's here

447
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:29.280
and the tab is Rad for where?
In some golf clothes.

448
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:33.850
Um,
so I told her that,
uh,
you know,
I told her,

449
00:27:33.851 --> 00:27:36.300
just give me a couple of those shirts,
two pairs of shorts and I'll be fine.

450
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.810
I'll be good.
She's like,
Oh yeah.
And usually she such into fashion,

451
00:27:39.811 --> 00:27:43.170
she gets excited when I tell her the clothes and you know,

452
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.200
my fucking birthday comes along and I got to tell you,

453
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:49.020
there was not a hint of any of that shit.

454
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:53.240
So I called her on it like a couple of days ago.
I said,
hey,
you know,
uh,

455
00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:58.590
I noticed,
you know,
I asked you for those things.
They're not expensive.

456
00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.290
You are right there.
And it was an easy,

457
00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.530
it was an easy gift to get me to pad,
you know,

458
00:28:04.531 --> 00:28:08.040
make it look like he actually spent time shopping,
you know,

459
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.010
which is why I always go and I get her lists of workout clothes.

460
00:28:11.011 --> 00:28:13.040
That's always the next of fee yet.
Go right there,
Fred.

461
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:15.360
Do you give him a couple more and it looks like you give a shit,

462
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.670
you know more than you.
Yeah.
Not saying you don't give a shit,

463
00:28:17.671 --> 00:28:21.540
but who the fuck wants to shop?
Nobody.
All right.
I don't want to do it,

464
00:28:21.541 --> 00:28:25.980
therefore nobody wants to do it.
That's how,
that's my worldview.
Okay.

465
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.980
I'm really starting to learn from Trump.
If I feel something,

466
00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:32.850
then everybody else also feels it.
And if they don't,

467
00:28:32.851 --> 00:28:34.530
then we should ram it down their throats.

468
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:38.620
And somewhere in there we take their coats.
Is,
isn't not how it works.
Um,

469
00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:46.010
have you ever seen a guy like less toughen your life talk so fucking tough.

470
00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:51.400
Like,
I dunno,
I don't understand why he,

471
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:56.140
he's mistaking having money with actually being physically intimidating,
um,

472
00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.470
with that stupid scowl on his face.

473
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:03.390
I don't know if like Gene Simmons had a brother that didn't make it,

474
00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.940
that wasn't in a band.
That's what he looks like.

475
00:29:05.941 --> 00:29:09.780
He looks like he's related to Gene Simmons and he resents Jean's success.

476
00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.170
Um,
anyways,
plowing ahead here.

477
00:29:13.171 --> 00:29:16.050
So my wife fucking hates that shit and I called her on it.
I was just going like,

478
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.550
you,
you,
you didn't like that stuff,
did you?

479
00:29:17.551 --> 00:29:22.230
And she just fucking started smiling and looking down at her food.
And,

480
00:29:22.231 --> 00:29:24.960
um,
I was over there today and I,

481
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.790
I was going to stop and go in and buy some and uh,

482
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:30.683
I didn't.

483
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.560
And the only reason why I didn't is because it's Sunday and it's a mall.

484
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:39.420
And um,
that's just like,
I dunno,
I don't know what it is.

485
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:43.720
I don't know what it is about the and malls now.
I understand kids go in there,

486
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:48.080
teenagers going there because then you'll run into other teenagers and you

487
00:29:48.081 --> 00:29:52.040
fucking go like,
okay,
will you go out with me?
Right.
That shit,

488
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:55.490
at least that's what we did when we were of that age.
But like parents,

489
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.350
like I just don't understand what,
why would you go there?

490
00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.920
Especially if you get like some little kid and you got to fucking push him

491
00:30:00.921 --> 00:30:04.700
around and that Goddamn stroller trying to weave in and out of all those people,

492
00:30:04.701 --> 00:30:09.320
I just can't imagine the fucking misery of that.
You know?

493
00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:14.000
That's definitely a Wifi idea.
You know,
we should go to the mall today.

494
00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:16.880
I know that I don't want to go to the mall.
You know,

495
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:21.320
I have all these theories as to why men die before women.
And uh,

496
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:26.810
you know what it is.
Women have to include you in their shitty day.

497
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:30.490
You know,
I fucking,
um,

498
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.670
this is my sister in law's birthday this weekend,
right?

499
00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:39.890
So we ended up going to a,
uh,

500
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:43.010
to a movie.
I was all excited and we saw,
what did we see?

501
00:30:43.011 --> 00:30:47.510
We saw a independence day.
Whew.

502
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:49.520
It was actually so bad.
It was good.

503
00:30:49.521 --> 00:30:54.521
We actually ended up having a great time and I don't want to ruin the movie,

504
00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:59.330
but like the fact that the white guide precedent has to come back,

505
00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:04.100
you know,
and get shit done is a little fucked up.
You know,

506
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:07.400
Hollywood tries to be liberal,
you know,
they'll have a chick president,

507
00:31:07.401 --> 00:31:10.430
they'll have a black guy flying a fucking jet and all that type of shit.

508
00:31:10.431 --> 00:31:14.150
But at the end of the day they bring back the old founding father to come in and

509
00:31:14.151 --> 00:31:19.010
save the day.
Anyway.

510
00:31:19.011 --> 00:31:23.250
So I had a great time doing that.
Right.
So the next night,
you know,

511
00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:26.390
my wife's going to go meet some friends.
I think it was actually,

512
00:31:26.391 --> 00:31:30.080
it was a continuation of the birthday celebration and I was actually tired so I

513
00:31:30.081 --> 00:31:35.000
wasn't going to go.
So,
um,
I was just like,
you know what,

514
00:31:35.001 --> 00:31:36.490
I'm going to hang in.
Um,

515
00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.130
I have a ton of shit to do cause you know,

516
00:31:40.131 --> 00:31:42.850
I sit in a writer's room all fucking day.
She goes,
fine,
cool.
I'm like,
great,

517
00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.760
this is perfect.
I'll get a bunch of shit done and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

518
00:31:45.761 --> 00:31:47.120
Blah and all that type of stuff.

519
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:51.560
So right around the time it's time for her to go right and I'm about ready to

520
00:31:51.561 --> 00:31:55.850
have a beer or anything thing and she just goes,
can you try me over?

521
00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:59.000
She didn't say it like that,
but that's what she probably says,
honey,

522
00:31:59.001 --> 00:32:01.190
can you drive me over?
But like,
cause I didn't want to do it.

523
00:32:01.191 --> 00:32:05.320
That's what it sounded like.
And I was just like,
you can't,

524
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:08.770
well why don't you drive yourself over?
And she just like

525
00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:15.040
me and so I go full fucking Uber.
She's like,
what?

526
00:32:15.041 --> 00:32:18.260
I want me,
you know?

527
00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.870
And I just went like,
why can't you know I'm home?

528
00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:29.300
Why do you got to dream?
You're the one who's going across fucking town.

529
00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:33.440
You're going across town.
Why do I got to go across town to,

530
00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.190
you know why you don't fucking know why.

531
00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:42.380
At the end of the day,
they,
if they have something shitty to do,

532
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:45.200
they can't do a,
can't fucking do it on their own.

533
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:47.690
Somehow you gotta be.

534
00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.980
That's like when they have a fucking kid now they dragged the husband in there.

535
00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:53.540
What the fuck is he doing in there?

536
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:58.880
What the fuck is he doing in there?
He's not a doctor.

537
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.870
Do you know?
I know a guy went in there and you fucking saw what was going on.

538
00:33:02.871 --> 00:33:07.370
He passed out.
Now they've got two patients.
The fuck is that,
you know.

539
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:12.560
Well,
if I have to go through the,
well fuck it.

540
00:33:12.561 --> 00:33:16.730
Talk to God.
Talk to God for once.

541
00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:20.600
For once.
For once.

542
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.950
The shit ran your way and now I got to go in there too so you can hold my

543
00:33:24.951 --> 00:33:27.980
fucking hand and break my God damn finger.
That's fucking,

544
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:33.220
that is the defect that fucking men gave into that shit that you got to fucking

545
00:33:33.681 --> 00:33:34.514
be in there.

546
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:38.960
Is that if you were getting fucking gallbladder surgery,

547
00:33:38.961 --> 00:33:41.630
what I be standing in their holding your fucking hand.

548
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:49.150
I Dunno,
but I guess if fucking him gave him gallbladders I,
I,

549
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.450
I don't know that gallbladder,
kidney stones is some shit.

550
00:33:52.451 --> 00:33:55.630
I guess you'd have to be.
That's the dumbest shit in the fucking,

551
00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:59.980
it's the stupidest shit ever.
My wife has talked,

552
00:33:59.981 --> 00:34:02.230
if we have every kid,
you're going to go in there.
I was like,
no,

553
00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:07.300
she got so fucking mad at me over a hypothetical child.

554
00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:11.690
If I was smarter,
I just would assume I'm getting smarter though.
I,

555
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:15.860
if I was smarter,
smart married guys go,
well absolutely I'll blue at out.

556
00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:20.230
We buy it at.
That was your way to put the baby in me.

557
00:34:20.231 --> 00:34:24.100
I would fucking shit it out my ass.
Daddy.
Think for you sweetheart.

558
00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:27.670
Right?
Oh,
I'm getting heated here.
Right.

559
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:31.250
I'm getting smarter though as a married man.
Cause I'll tell you this right now.

560
00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.970
The other one,
we went to go see the movie I got there first.

561
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.740
Okay.
And uh,
I got there,
it was seven o'clock show.

562
00:34:39.741 --> 00:34:42.740
I got there at like six 30 and I was like,
fuck,
you know,
I get time.

563
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:45.950
Maybe I'll you it as a place to get a sandwich.
I didn't want to eat movie food,

564
00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:50.960
so I got to rap and then they fucking had a beer too.

565
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:54.560
And by the way,
I,
every fucking time I ordered this is beer from Mexico.

566
00:34:54.561 --> 00:34:59.190
It fucking sucks.
I'm not saying all their beers stinks,
but I got to tell you.

567
00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:02.540
Hello.
Well,
let me tell you that fucking bear steaks.

568
00:35:02.541 --> 00:35:04.280
I'm going to get you the name of this right fucking,

569
00:35:04.281 --> 00:35:07.250
it's gonna be a reverse commercial.
There it is.

570
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:08.990
<v 4>Okay.</v>

571
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:12.410
<v 0>The fuck is that shit called Modelo.</v>

572
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:17.060
Hang on a second.
I think that's what it's called.

573
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:20.560
It is the fucking most bitter hoppy fucking,

574
00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:25.450
it's like a job trying to get the thing down,
but it was still a beer.

575
00:35:25.451 --> 00:35:28.870
So at the end of the day,
it's not all bad.
So I'm sipping this beer.

576
00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.830
I'm having this sandwich.
I got plenty of time to eat it up.
Fucking relaxed.

577
00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:36.880
My wife,
the lovely Nia,
she texted me,
she goes,
Hey,
I'm almost,

578
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:43.230
and I own like a dope.
I started to text,
Hey,
I'm already here.

579
00:35:43.231 --> 00:35:46.530
I mean I'm having a sandwich and a beer.
Okay,

580
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.730
now this is the deal for all you youngsters out there.

581
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:55.560
One of the things women hate the most is when the guy is having fun without
them.

582
00:35:56.050 --> 00:36:00.450
All right?
So any fucking time you're having a good time and they're not there,

583
00:36:00.451 --> 00:36:03.450
you got it.
How has it gone?
Hey,
you know,
it's kind of crowded.

584
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:08.410
You always say it sucks.
Okay?
If you're having a good time,
then Anthea,

585
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:14.140
you're gonna have to fucking deal with that shit,
right?

586
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.240
This is the thing my wife is,
is as cool as it gets.
All right?

587
00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:23.260
And I still have to go through this shit.
So I almost fucking texted her.

588
00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:27.220
I'm sitting here having a wrap and join a fucking beer.

589
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:32.110
Blahblahblahblahblah and then,
you know what I was like,
what the fuck am I doing

590
00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.580
if I say this,
she's going to then say,

591
00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:41.700
can you get me one or she's going to tell me to go over and go get the fucking

592
00:36:42.071 --> 00:36:44.530
tickets.
She's going to give me a job.

593
00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:49.680
There's no fucking way she's going to allow me to just sit here and relax and

594
00:36:50.321 --> 00:36:52.790
enjoy this sandwich in this beer that I fuck.

595
00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:59.710
I've worked all fucking day.
When am I a fucking asshole?

596
00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:04.420
So I just erased all of it.
And rather than saying all of that,

597
00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.880
you know,
I'm on my way over here.
Oh,

598
00:37:06.881 --> 00:37:08.620
I'm sitting here having a sandwich and a beer.

599
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:12.970
I erased all of that and I just wrote,
okay,
send,

600
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:16.780
that was it.
I didn't say I was there.
I didn't say I wasn't there.

601
00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:20.500
And I sat there and I enjoyed it even though that beer was not my favorite.

602
00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:25.390
And then,
um,
I ended up walking over and,

603
00:37:25.391 --> 00:37:30.370
uh,
I ran into my sister in law and then I,
and then look at dope.

604
00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:35.110
I texted my wife going,
yeah,
I'm just,
uh,
you know,

605
00:37:35.111 --> 00:37:37.030

blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

606
00:37:37.031 --> 00:37:40.000
And then she immediately texts back,
okay,

607
00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.400
I immediately fucking is a job for you.

608
00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:48.160
Here's a fucking job,

okay,

614

They had no money and then they started a watch company with what money.

701
00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:12.080
What collateral?
Um,
so you have no money and you start a watch company.
All right.

702
00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:14.190
Movement watches cut out the middleman in there.

703
00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:18.470
Big brand retail markups in order to give you a stylish washed watch for an

704
00:43:18.471 --> 00:43:19.460
affordable price movement.

705
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:24.050
Watches start at just 95 bucks a watch with the spa department store quality for

706
00:43:24.051 --> 00:43:28.010
a fraction of the price.
They're sleek and middle ballistic.
Sorry,

707
00:43:28.011 --> 00:43:29.330
talking to wade through a yard here,

708
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:34.280

717
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:05.450
Trips to the post office had become second nature to you.

718
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:09.050
They seem easy because you've been doing your mailing and shipping that way for

719
00:44:09.051 --> 00:44:13.250
so long,
but think about all the hassle,
man.
Dropping what you're doing,
driving.

720
00:44:13.251 --> 00:44:16.370
They're finding parking,
waiting.

Mercifully that's over.
The advertising is Hoover.

733
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:06.450
All right.
Where the fuck is the reeds for this week?
Um,

734
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:11.990
okay.
Lab grown food.
All right.

735
00:45:11.991 --> 00:45:16.160
Hey Bill,
wondering if you've heard of lab grown meat.

736
00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:20.570
Basically scientists to figure out a way to make plants tastes like meat.

737
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:24.060
Why aren't they fucking with the food supply?

738
00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:26.250
I don't understand what they're doing.

739
00:45:26.251 --> 00:45:30.760
This could eliminate our need to raise and kill millions of cows a year and help

740
00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:35.310
stop the ass gas coming from these cows from continuing to ruin our planet.

741
00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.280
I'm not sure how I feel about it,
but I liked the idea of it.

742
00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.590
Here's an example from the article.

743
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.880
The impossible burger is more than just peas and carrots smashed together.

744
00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.730
It's the result of some pretty high tech research.

745
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:53.030
Brown's team analyzes meet at a molecular level to determine what makes a burger

746
00:45:53.371 --> 00:45:55.500
tastes smell and cook the way it does.

747
00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:59.100
He wants his burger to be squishy while raw rouse.

748
00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:03.420
Then from up and Brown on the grill,
he believes everything from an animal,

749
00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:08.450
from an animal's fat tissue to muscle cells can be replicated using plant

750
00:46:09.361 --> 00:46:12.120
compounds,
compounds.
Before starting the company,

751
00:46:12.121 --> 00:46:16.320
Brown had a hunch that a certain ingredient made meat tastes different than

752
00:46:16.321 --> 00:46:19.740
other foods.
I had a strong suspicion early on that,

753
00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.110
<v 3>okay,</v>

754
00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:22.390
<v 0>I don't want to say double h.
E.</v>

755
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:26.660
M e him would be the magic ingredient for flavor,

756
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:31.550
not hemp.
Uh,
said Brown.
Here's the link to the whole article.
Would you eat this?

757
00:46:31.551 --> 00:46:35.330
Thanks.
Come back to Boston.
No,
I try not to fuck with that type of shit.
No,

758
00:46:35.331 --> 00:46:39.290
I would not eat that.
If I want meat,
I eat meat.
If I want ice cream,

759
00:46:39.291 --> 00:46:42.320
I get ice cream.
I don't get low fat ice cream.
I don't try to eat ice cream.

760
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:45.350
That doesn't make me fat.
Because you're going to pay the price somehow.

761
00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:46.683
All right,

762
00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:51.290
and the reason why there's so many fucking cows shitting and farting into the

763
00:46:51.291 --> 00:46:55.520
fucking air is cause there's so many people.
The problem,
time and time again,

764
00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.510
there's too many fucking people.
That is the fucking problem.
So,
okay,

765
00:46:59.511 --> 00:47:03.080
we all switch to these fucking plants.
Then what are we going to do then?

766
00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.870
We're going to need all this water to grow all these fucking plants.

767
00:47:05.871 --> 00:47:10.730
We are too much of a fucking burden on the natural resources of this planet.

768
00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:15.800
We need to thin the fucking hurt.
That's the deal.
That's it,
everybody.

769
00:47:15.801 --> 00:47:20.090
If you want a kid,
you have one,
two at the fucking most.
So,
you know,

770
00:47:20.091 --> 00:47:24.380
you're not creating more people than there is you.
Right.
But that workout,

771
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:28.850
no,
that wouldn't work out because then that they both have to then you

772
00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.240
two people and the who then go create to each.
Now it keeps getting bigger.

773
00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:39.310
One Kid,
right.
Everybody has one kid,

774
00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:43.660
two creates one another to meet and they create one.

775
00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:46.600
That's the only way to reverse fuck our way out of this thing.

776
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.220
And if you never have kids,
you ought to get some sort of massive tax break.
Um,

777
00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:52.690
I think that that's what you should do.

778
00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:56.410
So then scientists don't have to sit around and like,
you know,
well,
you know,

779
00:47:56.411 --> 00:47:58.050
at some point there's going to be no more stake.

780
00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:00.730
Cause me too many fucking people,
you know,

781
00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:03.190
I don't want to live on a planet with no steak,
you know,

782
00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:06.160
and I would like to go back to just the way cow is just sort of ran around

783
00:48:06.161 --> 00:48:07.790
chickens,
ran around and then every year,

784
00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:11.440
I don't know where he just gave me all right there for it as opposed to I having

785
00:48:11.441 --> 00:48:15.430
miserable lives,
you know,
I dunno.
Anyways,
let's plow ahead.

786
00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:17.020
I don't know how I feel about the whole fuck.

787
00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:20.440
I fucking love animals and I hate when people torture him and treat him like

788
00:48:20.441 --> 00:48:25.060
shit and all that.
I also like eating them.
I love chicken.
I love steaks.

789
00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:28.790
I love fish.
I like all that shit.
So like,
you know,

790
00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:32.770
if we could just get somebody to get out from underneath these corporation cons

791
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:35.650
and just get everybody on the same page,
it'd be like,
look,

792
00:48:35.651 --> 00:48:38.680
this is what we're doing.
Okay,
this is the problem.

793
00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:43.750
This is what everybody needs to do to try to at least keep it at bay,
you know?

794
00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:47.210
But there's none of that,
you know what I mean?
It's just,
just,
I don't know.

795
00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:51.520
It doesn't come from the right fucking people.
All right.
Getting through college.

796
00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:56.890
Fuck.
Hey mister birth.
Um,
how do I get through this college shit.

797
00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:01.920
I'm currently taking anatomy and physiology one and this summer since I failed

798
00:49:05.021 --> 00:49:08.620
it and it fucking blows ass.
Well,
why are you taking it?

799
00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:12.730
Did you ever feel like when you were going to college,
you just couldn't do it?

800
00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:17.380
Because maybe there was the,
that one class that was impossible to pass.
If so,

801
00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:19.570
how did you get through it?
You know,

802
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:24.420
it's hard for me to even imagine passing this class ever getting a it.

803
00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:25.820
<v 4>Okay.</v>

804
00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:29.750
<v 0>I didn't know what the heck.
I can't even say it.
K.
I.
N.</v>

805
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:34.130
E s I allergy
kinesiology degree.

806
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:39.170
Sam kinesiology.
Sam Kennison degree.
Um,
thanks.
By the way.
Uh,

807
00:49:39.171 --> 00:49:42.140
I saw on your Wikipedia page that you'd died and I felt horrible.

808
00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:46.850
I know you don't care,
but just thought I'd tell you.
Oh,
well,
you know.
Well,

809
00:49:46.851 --> 00:49:51.200
that's good.
Well,
I guess I don't have to pay taxes this year.
Um,
anyways.

810
00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.990
Uh,
all right.
Do you ever think that you're in the wrong major?

811
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.100
Maybe you were in the wrong school,
like life shouldn't be that fucking heart,

812
00:49:58.101 --> 00:50:02.180
dude.
It's not like you're dumb if you taking these kinds of classes.
Um,

813
00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:06.590
I would say that,
um,

814
00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:11.720
the turning point in my college career was when I decided that I wanted to be a

815
00:50:11.721 --> 00:50:14.780
standup comedian and,
um,

816
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:18.200
I still wanted to get a college degree for whatever reason.

817
00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.780
It was important to my parents.
And I don't know,

818
00:50:20.781 --> 00:50:24.320
I just want to be a college graduate.
I don't know why I'm,

819
00:50:24.321 --> 00:50:29.321
so I got out of the college I was at and I transferred to Emerson College,

820
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:34.400
which was more of a performance school and people made movies and it was acting

821
00:50:34.401 --> 00:50:37.820
and radio and all of this shit.
And uh,

822
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:43.240
all of a sudden my grades went up cause I was doing shit that I was into.

823
00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:45.070
Um,

824
00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:49.640
but there was a couple of fucking classes that just sucked.

825
00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:53.060
There's always going to be a couple of those.
How do you get through,
you know,

826
00:50:53.061 --> 00:50:57.230
what you do?
Don't blow it off because if it's already hard,

827
00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:59.670
you get three days behind in that thing,
it's,

828
00:50:59.671 --> 00:51:01.620
it's going to be like being a month behind for you.

829
00:51:01.621 --> 00:51:06.590
So what I would do is I would just stay on that shit and just be like,

830
00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:10.610
all right,
plus do this.
Taking over the summers at joke,
dude,

831
00:51:10.611 --> 00:51:13.130
it's practically impossible.
You know,

832
00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:16.090
I was so old by the time I fucking graduated college,

833
00:51:16.091 --> 00:51:20.570
didn't like Matt transferred to Emerson.
I was like,
I forget.

834
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:24.590
I was almost 23 years old and I was still just beginning my sophomore year.

835
00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:30.240
I transferred there in January of whatever year,
uh,

836
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.740
by December of the following year,
I had done three years of college.

837
00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:38.060
I just fucking,
I just,
I just said fuck this.

838
00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:43.850
And I did.
I finished my sophomore year,
the January to April,

839
00:51:43.851 --> 00:51:46.730
and then in the summer I picked up a semester.
So I finished that.

840
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:50.300
Then the next year was my junior year and then I went to summer school again,

841
00:51:50.301 --> 00:51:54.080
picked up another semester,
and then the following fall was my second semester,

842
00:51:54.081 --> 00:51:56.210
my senior year,
and that was it.
I gave it the old right there,

843
00:51:56.211 --> 00:51:57.290
Fred and fucking out of here.

844
00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:01.460
But what you have to do is when you go in straight through like that,

845
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:04.280
or if you're doing like the summertime shit is,
you got to stay on it.

846
00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:09.290
Just treat it like a fucking job.
It's actually a good exercise.

847
00:52:09.291 --> 00:52:14.150
It's something that's sucks.
It's something that you hate and you just,
you know,

848
00:52:14.151 --> 00:52:16.610
rather than running from,
just turn around and face it and get through it.

849
00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:21.170
If this is the degree you want,
um,
but sometimes if it's that fucking hard,

850
00:52:21.171 --> 00:52:25.570
it means that you're a square peg trying to go into a round hole and he need
that

851
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:29.150
go after what you really want to fucking do.
Because you know,

852
00:52:29.151 --> 00:52:33.110
when you do what you want to do,
you have a passion for it and it's,
it's easy.
Um,

853
00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:38.050
Cibele that was original or whatever that they did fit that advice fit.

854
00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:41.320
All right.
Would you consider a Vegas residency,

855
00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:45.580
a deer country McConn face at this point in your career?
If offered,

856
00:52:45.581 --> 00:52:50.581
would you accept a comedy residency in Las Vegas or would you be offended as

857
00:52:51.011 --> 00:52:55.210
there's plenty of life in that old dog yet?
If not,
how bad would you,

858
00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.400
your career have to be

859
00:52:57.790 --> 00:52:58.140
<v 3>okay</v>

860
00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:02.820
<v 0>going before you accepted and which hotel would you like to work in next time</v>

861
00:53:02.821 --> 00:53:06.750
you come to Australia?
Play a Gig in,
uh,

862
00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:12.520
Adelaide.
I Dunno,
we're not all backwards fucks.
I mean,
I,

863
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:16.670
I never thought you were take it easy.
You cunt.
Um,

864
00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:18.290
what I do that well,
I couldn't,

865
00:53:18.291 --> 00:53:22.220
well if I didn't have is for family or anything like that.
Um,

866
00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:23.890
<v 3>okay.</v>

867
00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:25.260
<v 0>I don't think that that's for me.</v>

868
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:31.170
I think my ACC would dry up if I just stayed in the same venue.

869
00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.530
<v 2>MMM.</v>

870
00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:35.690
<v 0>Having said that,
the way you're,</v>

871
00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:42.010
the way you're framing that Gig as if it's a sad thing that happens to comedians

872
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:45.770
do,
those are multimillion dollar contracts.

873
00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:47.990
<v 2>And,
um,</v>

874
00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:50.260
<v 0>anybody who's ever done one of those,</v>

875
00:53:50.261 --> 00:53:53.070
as long as they didn't go to the crap table after this show every night,

876
00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:54.963
<v 2>uh,</v>

877
00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:57.880
<v 0>rides off into the sunset,</v>

878
00:53:57.910 --> 00:54:01.150
like with bags and bags of cash.

879
00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.153
<v 2>MMM.</v>

880
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:07.830
<v 0>That's just something that I have no interest in,
uh,
at this point in my career,</v>

881
00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:11.520
in doing,
I still like traveling and that type of stuff.

882
00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:12.870
I do have to tell you though,

883
00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:14.733
<v 2>mmm.</v>

884
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:20.550
<v 0>If it just wasn't Vegas,
I just,
that town does nothing for me.</v>

885
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.820
Just sitting there in the fucking desert.
I would go nuts.

886
00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.880
But I do have to say that,
you know,
if I could,

887
00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:28.203
<v 2>yeah.</v>

888
00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:31.140
<v 0>You know,
all of a sudden just get off the road.</v>

889
00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:36.810
I totally understand why comedians do that after a while.
Um,

890
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:41.220
all right.
So there you go.
All right.
And I'll,
I'll tell her you fucking town.

891
00:54:41.221 --> 00:54:43.110
I'll try to get close to it next time.
All right.
Okay,

892
00:54:43.111 --> 00:54:47.850
bill getting people you hate fired.
All right,
this already sounds evil.

893
00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:49.200
Hey Bill,
love your shit.

894
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:52.980
I'm almost 30 mistakes are made and now I work at a shit factory.

895
00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:56.400
I shovel literal shit with a pay loader.

896
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.940
A for about 10 hours a day,
which isn't so bad,

897
00:54:59.941 --> 00:55:04.440
but it's made worse by my terrible coworkers.
It's a small operation.

898
00:55:04.441 --> 00:55:08.970
Everyone is about twice my age and for the most part they are pretty average

899
00:55:08.971 --> 00:55:13.380
blue collar guys.
We all had our boss and his yes man,
Aaron boy,

900
00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:18.330
uh,
about Aaron boy.
He's the kind of guy who is always right.

901
00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:23.640
Uh,
done his way.
Run and tell the boss what the rest of us are doing.

902
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.150
Rat Bastard type.
All right.
Uh,

903
00:55:27.151 --> 00:55:32.151
he's also the kind of guy who says the n word to let the rest of us know.

904
00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:36.720
He's a no guff taking,
no shits given type of guy.

905
00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.270
He's not,
uh,

906
00:55:39.271 --> 00:55:44.271
he's white as the driven snow and think he's Indian because he purchased a t

907
00:55:44.821 --> 00:55:48.490
shirt at Walmart and with wolves on it through,

908
00:55:48.491 --> 00:55:51.940
this is fucking pretty random so far.
Well,
today I took my Stan,

909
00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:56.040
I snitch to human resources.
Uh,
you fucking rat bastard.

910
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.451
He goes,

911
00:55:57.451 --> 00:56:02.440
I told them how one black employee knows Aaron boy,

912
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:07.280
a racist
to you.

913
00:56:07.281 --> 00:56:09.290
You're pumped.
You have no punctuation in this.

914
00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:12.550
This is Dee Dee and I,
you know,

915
00:56:12.551 --> 00:56:15.070
I didn't like how in the beginning you just fucking played the victim.

916
00:56:15.071 --> 00:56:18.340
Like I'm almost 30 mistakes were made and I work at a shit factory.

917
00:56:18.341 --> 00:56:23.050
Like you just glossed over all your stuff and then you're saying you got

918
00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.930
coworkers of,
well,
what about,
wait,
what about you?

919
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:29.590
You fucking awful punctuation here.
Mistakes were made.

920
00:56:29.591 --> 00:56:34.080
Mistakes are continuing to be made,
sir.
All right,
let me try and get through it.

921
00:56:34.081 --> 00:56:39.081
I told them how one our one black employee knows Aaron boys are racist and that

922
00:56:39.451 --> 00:56:43.560
he's pissed.
I also told them about the weird sexual shit.

923
00:56:43.561 --> 00:56:47.630
He says like fisting his girlfriend.
All of this is true.
And the,

924
00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:51.300
the guy's a complete asshole who knows the boss won't fire him.

925
00:56:51.301 --> 00:56:55.560
And he takes a complete advantage of that by making our lives.
Hell.

926
00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:00.690
Is this like animal house?
It's the guy's name.
Niedermeyer.
Anyway,

927
00:57:00.691 --> 00:57:05.490
I come home and smoked some weed because that's what you do when you shovel
shit.

928
00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:10.080
And now I'm feeling shitty myself.
I hate the guy and I really hate my boss.

929
00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:15.030
But sure enough,
human resources called me and I could sense their panic.

930
00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:20.100
My money's on their fire,
on their firing him.
Everyone else at worked.

931
00:57:20.101 --> 00:57:22.140
Once I'm gone and is hoping he gets fired.

932
00:57:22.141 --> 00:57:26.370
But now I'm starting to feel bad and he's an asshole who I hate and I feel like

933
00:57:26.371 --> 00:57:30.290
I'm sticking it to the man,
but that I go too far.
I don't,

934
00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:34.230
I'm not big on rat and people out to be honest with you.
Um,

935
00:57:38.010 --> 00:57:41.150
was there a way that you could have gone to him and just said,
hey,
listen,

936
00:57:41.151 --> 00:57:45.920
not for nothing.
I don't want to listen to you dropping the n word.
You know,

937
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:48.410
and I don't want to listen to you talking about fist in your girlfriend.

938
00:57:48.411 --> 00:57:51.230
That has nothing to do with the job.
Okay.

939
00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:55.260
And then he would make your life unbelievably and,
and then I would,
I,

940
00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:56.240
that's what you should've done.

941
00:57:56.241 --> 00:58:00.770
You should have of come in all you guys should've just approached him,

942
00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:05.240
right?
Like Mickey Rourke at the end of Pope of Greenwich Village.

943
00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.390
Cause of my tape.
I took off a fucking dead carp.
Right?

944
00:58:08.391 --> 00:58:11.960
You just come up to him and just say,
listen,
here's the deal.
Okay,

945
00:58:11.961 --> 00:58:13.220
you're still our supervisor,

946
00:58:13.221 --> 00:58:16.730
but no longer are you dropping the n word and no longer are you talking about

947
00:58:16.731 --> 00:58:19.430
fist and your girlfriend around us.
We don't want to hear it anymore.

948
00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:24.110
You understand this?
If you do,
we're going to human resources.
All right.

949
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:29.630
A fucking creepy name.
Human Resource.
So fucking disgusting.

950
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:31.710
Yeah,
that's what you should have done.
But you know,
I,
you know,

951
00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:35.840
you live and you learn.
This guy sounds like a Kentucky,
you know what I mean?
Uh,

952
00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:40.010
just do that in the future.
Oh.
And then you could say,
and by the way,

953
00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:42.800
if you try to get any of his fire that's going down to,

954
00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:47.240
so basically what we're saying is you've lost all control to intimidate us now.

955
00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:50.540
Uh,
but we'll still do what you say as long as you're not a cunt.
All right?

956
00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:54.530
Go Fuck Yourself.
Run off.
Uh,

957
00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:57.440
why don't you do that?
You're like,
what?
I just pitched there.

958
00:58:57.441 --> 00:59:00.500
That's like when the cast of friends all got together and negotiated together.

959
00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:05.540
Right.
And they got their money.
You could do that at your shit factory.
All right.

960
00:59:05.541 --> 00:59:08.300
Laying off the booze.
Hey Billy blunts.

961
00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:12.260
After hearing you talk about drying out,
you really inspired me to do the same.

962
00:59:12.261 --> 00:59:16.430
I drank entirely too much.
Right now after about eight days of daily commitment,

963
00:59:16.431 --> 00:59:21.431
I'm up to about a half a fifth a day with the odd beer in a way.

964
00:59:23.521 --> 00:59:24.380
And I thought you said

965
00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:30.030
after about eight years of daily commitment,

966
00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:32.520
I thought the eight days I thought he was like drying out and then all of a

967
00:59:32.521 --> 00:59:34.000
sudden he's boosting that confused me.

968
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:35.850
Right after about eight years of daily commitment,

969
00:59:35.851 --> 00:59:39.840
I'm up to about half a fifth a day and with an odd beer mixed in.

970
00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:40.980
I know it's a lot,

971
00:59:40.981 --> 00:59:44.730
but I've worked out my tolerance so much that I don't really get drunk anymore.

972
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:48.450
I just lose an hour here and there.
No big deal,
right?
Yeah.

973
00:59:48.451 --> 00:59:50.670
The two that's called blacking out.
Anyways,

974
00:59:50.671 --> 00:59:54.450
I was able to quit smoking weed after five years of heavy daily use.
No problem.

975
00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:59.520
I was even able to quit using oxycotton Jesus after about three years of eating

976
00:59:59.521 --> 01:00:03.690
and sniffing pills all damn day.
I've been able to maintain a normal life,

977
01:00:03.691 --> 01:00:05.280
won't going through these ups and downs.

978
01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:07.950
I'm married with a kid and a house and a great job.

979
01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:10.020
If you make more than a million dollars,

980
01:00:10.021 --> 01:00:12.780
I probably manage your retirement account,

981
01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:16.590
but despite being able to put the hard shit down,

982
01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:19.560
Bu's has been the hardest so far.

983
01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:25.560
Last week I decided to jump off the wagon with you.
It's been hard as hell,

984
01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:28.110
but I've been able to stick to it better than I ever had.

985
01:00:28.111 --> 01:00:32.490
I'm trying to limit beers to two a day and only drink liquor on the weekends.

986
01:00:32.491 --> 01:00:36.690
I've slipped once,
but I'm doing my fucking best.
I don't have a question.

987
01:00:36.691 --> 01:00:39.390
More of a request.
Please keep us updated on your progress.

988
01:00:39.391 --> 01:00:43.380
It's helping me with my own journey because none of my friends really drink at

989
01:00:43.381 --> 01:00:47.730
all much less the way I do and my wife doesn't even know the extent of my issue,

990
01:00:47.731 --> 01:00:49.710
which is an issue on its own.
Yeah,
it is.

991
01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:55.100
Makes my struggle a bit easier to hear you having the same troubles as I have

992
01:00:56.250 --> 01:01:00.090
with sticking to my resolution.
Thanks for giving me the kick in the ass.

993
01:01:00.091 --> 01:01:03.030
I need to get my shit together.
All right dude.
This is what you need to do.

994
01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:08.310
All right.
After just saying don't text your wife that you having a good time,

995
01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:11.250
you got to let you know.
You got to let your wife know about this.

996
01:01:11.251 --> 01:01:14.280
This is a major thing.
You're not sitting there eating a fucking Turkey wrap,

997
01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:19.530
having a fucking bitter Mexican beer,
whatever the fuck it was called.
Um,

998
01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:22.173
<v 2>okay.</v>

999
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:25.430
<v 0>I would talk to her about it because then she can,
she can watch it.
Dude,</v>

1000
01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:27.800
I can't fucking watch.
I can't,
I can't do this for you.

1001
01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:31.250
You need to have your wife involved in this and just say,
listen,

1002
01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:36.170
I've been drinking entirely too much and I need your help.
All right.

1003
01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:37.843
So,

1004
01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:39.393
<v 2>mmm.</v>

1005
01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.140
<v 0>I gotta be honest with Dude.
I tried,</v>

1006
01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:44.320
like right now I have a beer a day and that's the only,

1007
01:01:44.321 --> 01:01:49.000
because my wife had some people over and they left a bunch of beer in the fridge

1008
01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:53.530
and it's taken up all this space and I don't want to dump it down the sink,

1009
01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:56.860
you know,
I'm not dumping out a bunch of beers.
I just have one a day.

1010
01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:01.210
And what sucks is that corona lite,
which are fucking horrific.
Um,

1011
01:02:01.211 --> 01:02:05.800
so I don't even enjoy them.
Um,
but I just have like one a day.
Uh,

1012
01:02:05.801 --> 01:02:09.940
but last night it was Saturday night,
I'm home,

1013
01:02:11.050 --> 01:02:14.320
you know,
I got the best fucking bar in town.

1014
01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:18.940
I got high end booze and you know,
I had a couple of home ports,
which,

1015
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.970
you know,
as I've mentioned before,

1016
01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:25.050
there's the bar poor and there's the home poor because you can lie to yourself

1017
01:02:25.051 --> 01:02:27.030
that you have in two scotches a night.
But you know,

1018
01:02:27.031 --> 01:02:30.180
when you go out to a bar and you see what their scotches are,
you like,
oh wait,

1019
01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.660
did I say too,
I meant nine.
Um,

1020
01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.910
so,
uh,
yeah,
like last night,
you know,
I had a couple,
two,

1021
01:02:38.911 --> 01:02:42.180
three of those after having the beer during the day and I woke up today,

1022
01:02:42.181 --> 01:02:45.120
I felt like I got hit by a truck,
you know,
it was awful.

1023
01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:48.480
I walked my dog around the block and I shook it off and I was just like,
like,

1024
01:02:48.481 --> 01:02:53.070
you know what it is at nighttime,
it's brutal being sober at night socks,

1025
01:02:53.071 --> 01:02:56.730
but being sober in the waking up the next day,

1026
01:02:56.731 --> 01:03:00.990
stone sober is the greatest.
It's,
it,
it feels better than getting shit faced.

1027
01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:06.470
Um,
so,
you know,
and my wife,

1028
01:03:06.471 --> 01:03:10.210
you know,
she stays on me.
She stays on me about it.
It's weird.
Like,
I don't want,

1029
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:14.120
like you sound like,
you know,
you've,
you,
you've had some hardcore,

1030
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:19.340
luckily I don't have like an addictive personality.
My thing is I have time,

1031
01:03:19.341 --> 01:03:23.630
I have free fucking time and I get into like,

1032
01:03:23.631 --> 01:03:27.200
and I am a creature of habit.
Like if I can't,
if I,
like,
this is how I work.

1033
01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:32.030
Like if I was to go out and buy a fucking pint of ice cream,
right?

1034
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:37.490
And I was still wolf that fucking thing down one night,
I would start doing that.

1035
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:43.010
That's what I would do.
So like if I,
you know,
and,

1036
01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:45.260
and all these fucking addicts who go to Aa and all this shit,

1037
01:03:45.261 --> 01:03:47.110
they always trying to make sure that they try to make,

1038
01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.090
like everybody's a fucking addict,
you know,
I'm not dude,

1039
01:03:50.091 --> 01:03:55.040
I don't have like a fucking bottle in the back of my fucking toilet and shit

1040
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:59.090
sitting there shaking,
drinking fucking mouthwash and shit.
You know what I mean?

1041
01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:03.950
I just like drinking.
I enjoy it,
you know what I mean?
But as I get older,

1042
01:04:03.951 --> 01:04:08.240
like just paying for it the next day is making it not fucking worth it.

1043
01:04:08.241 --> 01:04:12.260
So I just don't do it.
And whenever I decide to stop,

1044
01:04:12.261 --> 01:04:15.290
I just stop and it sucks for a few days.

1045
01:04:15.291 --> 01:04:18.200
And then what it is is it's not part of my daily routine.

1046
01:04:18.201 --> 01:04:22.670
And then I literally just forget about it.
Um,

1047
01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:29.090
you know,
but I don't know,
you seem like a little bit,
uh,
beyond that.

1048
01:04:29.091 --> 01:04:32.560
So I would definitely reach out to you,
your wife and uh,

1049
01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:34.720
see if she can help you and maybe if she can help you,

1050
01:04:34.721 --> 01:04:38.450
you stop there and if you need more help,
I would go do that.
But,
uh,

1051
01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:43.840
don't depend on me because I don't have any kids and I live like a fucking 14

1052
01:04:45.501 --> 01:04:50.300
year old,
so I'm not a good person to a use.
I mean,
having said that,

1053
01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:54.080
I'm just doing a beer a day,
if that helps you.
All right.

1054
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:58.830
Okay.
S t e d o g.

1055
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:04.250
S t doe Jesus.
All right,
Bill Billy,
what's that red mark?

1056
01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.500
I don't know what that means.

1057
01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:09.590
Is that something else I need to be self conscious about?
All right.
Uh,

1058
01:05:09.591 --> 01:05:11.880
this is a gnarly one.
Um,

1059
01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:15.730
I recently found out that I have HPV,
a k,

1060
01:05:15.731 --> 01:05:19.110
a gentle awards,
and he then he says,
gross.
Uh,

1061
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.940
it's actually very common and it's just a few small bumps,

1062
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:24.340
but it fucking sucks anyways.

1063
01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:27.910
It can show up years after you've received it.

1064
01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:31.480
So I have no idea who I got it from.
Ah,
once again,

1065
01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:35.560
another great reason to get married,
to stay out of that fucking world.

1066
01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:38.650
Here's my question.
I recently met an amazing girl.

1067
01:05:38.651 --> 01:05:43.450
We have a lot of the same interests.
She's a hard 10,
Yadda,
Yadda,
Yadda.

1068
01:05:43.451 --> 01:05:47.230
Point is,
I really like her.
I'm getting treated for the HPV,

1069
01:05:47.231 --> 01:05:51.610
but I respect her enough to tell her of the risks.
Uh,
she's getting into,

1070
01:05:51.611 --> 01:05:54.340
in the case,
in case it goes that far.
So Bill,

1071
01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:58.450
how do I tell her that I have an STD and that there's a small chance she could

1072
01:05:58.451 --> 01:06:02.230
get it?
Uh,
I don't want to mess up this opportunity,

1073
01:06:02.231 --> 01:06:06.220
but my other options are basically to move to a cabin in the woods for six

1074
01:06:06.221 --> 01:06:09.950
months until this is completely gone.
Uh,

1075
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.210
thought it'd be funny to hear your advice.
Oh,
dude.
Fuck yeah.

1076
01:06:13.211 --> 01:06:18.130
You gotta tell her totally 100% teller and then just don't just say,
listen,

1077
01:06:18.131 --> 01:06:23.020
so I can't do anything for six months other than to get to know you better.

1078
01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:27.820
You know?
And this is the thing,
if she doesn't want to stick around for that.

1079
01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:32.260
Yeah.
God bless her.
Who gives a fuck?
You know what I mean?

1080
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:35.230
You've got to look at it like,
well what else wouldn't she stick around for it?

1081
01:06:35.231 --> 01:06:35.771
But then again,

1082
01:06:35.771 --> 01:06:38.850
you're also coming out of the gate saying you've got to fucking Stda.
No,

1083
01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:41.740
there's no right or wrong answer other than to not.

1084
01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:44.450
You got to tell people that shit.
You know,

1085
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:49.200
don't you watch the person that had it told you you don't want it?

1086
01:06:49.201 --> 01:06:51.250
You don't want it.
You got to,
you got to break the chain there.

1087
01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:56.280
Women are so much more advanced emotionally,

1088
01:06:57.370 --> 01:07:00.790
so much more.
They understand love,
they understand emotions,

1089
01:07:00.791 --> 01:07:03.640
they understand so much more than guys do.

1090
01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:05.980
And it's not our fault.

1091
01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:09.010
It's not their fault the way that they are and all that type of shit.

1092
01:07:09.011 --> 01:07:13.540
It's just how we're fucking wired.
I don't fucking understand it.
Um,

1093
01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.510
it is what it is.
But uh,
you know,

1094
01:07:16.511 --> 01:07:19.420
if she really likes you when she's understanding and then you're sitting there

1095
01:07:19.421 --> 01:07:22.210
saying,
you know,
she's a hard 10,
people are trying to fuck her all the time.

1096
01:07:22.211 --> 01:07:22.901
So you're going to go on like,

1097
01:07:22.901 --> 01:07:27.640
listen is something embarrassing but it's going to be cleared up in six months

1098
01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:31.600
and I respect you enough to tell you,
you know,
we can hang out,

1099
01:07:31.601 --> 01:07:34.510
get to know each other better and all that type of stuff.
But you know,

1100
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:37.540
there's no way I'm having sex with you or anybody else.

1101
01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.190
You'll come off responsible.

1102
01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:42.730
You'd come off as honest and if that's what the fuck she's looking for,

1103
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:47.380
she'll stick around.
If she doesn't,
then fucking lay low for six months,

1104
01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:53.590
lay low for fucking six months and then,
you know,
whatever,

1105
01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:57.550
go to the gym and get fucking shredded.
No,
don't do that.

1106
01:07:57.551 --> 01:08:00.610
You'll get more ladies coming up to you.
Stay away.

1107
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:06.600
Anyways,
let's,
uh,
let's,
uh,
let me,
let me,
uh,

1108
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:10.120
let me finish off this fucking podcast.
What are we up to here?

1109
01:08:11.350 --> 01:08:14.260
Hour and eight minutes.
All right.
Is there anything else I wanted to talk about?

1110
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.670
Oh,
oh,
fucking Billy red faces.
Uh,

1111
01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:22.010
finally going to get himself a car.
Okay.

1112
01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:26.130
I'm gonna order it this fucking week cause they don't have the color that I
want.

1113
01:08:26.131 --> 01:08:29.280
And if I'm going to buy a new car or Frugal Freddy's getting the fucking color

1114
01:08:29.281 --> 01:08:32.430
that he wants and I'm not going to tell you guys what kind of car that I'm

1115
01:08:32.431 --> 01:08:36.370
getting because I,
cause I want to enjoy the process.
I don't want to listen to,

1116
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:39.480
to fuck you.
Good.
Yeah.
Would pull you fucking get this one.

1117
01:08:39.481 --> 01:08:42.180
You go get the one you want.
But I fucking looked at everything.

1118
01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:47.010
I looked at the Jaguar,
I looked at the fuck,
I looked at a BMW,

1119
01:08:47.011 --> 01:08:48.330
I looked at a Lexus,

1120
01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:52.170
I decided that I want one of those fucking four door sedans if fucking cruises.

1121
01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:57.390
Uh,
I found the BMW to basically be a,
you know,

1122
01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:01.440
I love the German like precision and the precision.

1123
01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:07.170
I got my kids say that precision.
There you go.
But I don't think I could speak.

1124
01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:11.670
Um,
you know,
you could just sit in there and you just feel the German,
all of it.

1125
01:09:11.730 --> 01:09:13.560
No wasted movements.

1126
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:17.040
This is the punchline is stiff as he wants a comfortable ride.

1127
01:09:17.041 --> 01:09:19.470
You get the seven series.
Um,

1128
01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:25.030
I looked at Alexis,
I don't like that grill.
It looks like Darth Vader,

1129
01:09:25.031 --> 01:09:28.580
his mouth on his fucking helmet.
And um,

1130
01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:33.290
I dunno.
I Dunno.
I think I found the one though.

1131
01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:39.620
I literally looked at everything.
Mercedes,
BMW,
Jaguar,

1132
01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.220
Lexis,
the whole fucking thing.
You know,

1133
01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:47.870
I'm not getting the sick ass model.
I'm getting the one debts,

1134
01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:49.920
decking dead has the right and this is what,

1135
01:09:49.930 --> 01:09:52.790
this is what I'm going to get a four door sedan that has the biggest fucking

1136
01:09:52.791 --> 01:09:57.410
engine I in that I can get in it.
Right.
And,

1137
01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:01.160
but I'm not going to buy a high end car so I could still take it to the fucking

1138
01:10:01.161 --> 01:10:04.850
grocery store and when some cunt fucking OpenStep door in my car,

1139
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.460
it's not going to kill me.
You know what I mean?
Cause I,

1140
01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.210
I don't get,

1141
01:10:10.690 --> 01:10:15.190
I just don't understand having a high end car like psycho high end.
Like,

1142
01:10:15.191 --> 01:10:18.790
I'm buying a mid range,
you know,

1143
01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:21.283
car Emmy.

1144
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:24.890
All of them seem fucking high end to me cause I've driven a Prius for nine

1145
01:10:24.891 --> 01:10:28.370
fucking years.
Do you guys know I'm on my fourth car of my life.
That's all.

1146
01:10:28.371 --> 01:10:33.170
I've been at an 83 Ford Ranger.
Then I had this fun,
I bought a used,

1147
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:37.640
I bought that used,
I drove that for fucking 10 years and then,

1148
01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:40.820
and then it burned down to the side of the road.
That's a long fucking story.

1149
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:42.860
Then I bought a uh,

1150
01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:44.930
<v 3>okay.</v>

1151
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:49.730
<v 0>In like 96 [inaudible] 97 I bought a 1988 Honda accord.</v>

1152
01:10:49.731 --> 01:10:52.730
Four to a five speed.
Fucking love that car.

1153
01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:58.550
And it was the top of the line,
Honda accord,
the DX,
whatever the fuck it was.

1154
01:10:58.610 --> 01:11:02.470
It was fun.
That was a great fucking car.
MMM.

1155
01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:07.250
And then I got a,
then I moved back to New York,
so I didn't need a car.

1156
01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:14.700
Wait a minute.
Yeah.
And then I bought my Prius and then I got the f 100.

1157
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.120
That's all I've had.
That's pretty fucking good.
Right?

1158
01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:23.100
Almost 50 fucking years old had been driving since 1984.
Jesus Christ.
I'm old.

1159
01:11:23.101 --> 01:11:27.900
I've been driving for 32 fucking years.
I've had basically I've had three cars.

1160
01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:32.880
One,
two,
three,
four,
four cars.
That's pretty fucking good.
How Frugal Freddy.

1161
01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:35.850
So I've had enough of the Prius and had enough of it.

1162
01:11:35.851 --> 01:11:37.020
And you know what's funny about that car?

1163
01:11:37.021 --> 01:11:40.020
Cause it's a Toyota and I've changed the oil and I've maintained it and

1164
01:11:40.021 --> 01:11:40.471
everything.

1165
01:11:40.471 --> 01:11:44.310
Like there is a major part of me that wants to drive that car for the rest of my

1166
01:11:44.311 --> 01:11:48.510
fucking life because it's hilarious to me because I know I could get a million

1167
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:50.580
miles out of that car because at the end of the day,

1168
01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:54.300
all these fucking dopes whose cars shit the bed unless like you remember like

1169
01:11:54.301 --> 01:11:57.660
the BMWs a few years ago when they were just designed to fall apart at 50 to

1170
01:11:57.661 --> 01:12:02.310
60,000 miles.
Um,
you know,
unless it's being done on purpose,

1171
01:12:02.311 --> 01:12:04.500
at the end of the fucking day,
the engine block,

1172
01:12:04.770 --> 01:12:07.780
it's made out of fucking steal like that.
That thing's not supposed to.

1173
01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.500
You're not supposed to have any problems with that.
That thing.
In theory,

1174
01:12:10.501 --> 01:12:14.610
all of that shit should last for fucking ever and granted thing here and thing

1175
01:12:14.611 --> 01:12:17.910
there will come loose or something like that.
But the engine itself,

1176
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:21.210
when people just have the,
when your engine is just fried,

1177
01:12:21.211 --> 01:12:25.020
the valves of fried and all that shit,
you weren't maintained in the fucking car.

1178
01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.980
And for the life of me now when you can go to all of these fucking places,

1179
01:12:28.981 --> 01:12:33.360
I'm still never go to Jiffy Lube.
I still take it to the dealership.
Um,

1180
01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.810
Jiffy lube cause it's so getting in and out of there.

1181
01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:39.660
I always get nervous as you always hear those stories that you know,

1182
01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:42.240
they drain the oil out and they forget to put it back in.

1183
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:43.980
Basically the poltergeist,
you know,

1184
01:12:44.730 --> 01:12:47.060
you move their headstones but you didn't move the bodies.

1185
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.840
It's basically the car version of that.

1186
01:12:48.841 --> 01:12:52.250
Like they take the fucking oil out and you know,

1187
01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:55.620
whoever's supposed to put it in up top doesn't do it.
The guy down the bottom,

1188
01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:57.840
it's,
he just drains the fucking oil.
Right.

1189
01:12:57.841 --> 01:13:00.560
Then he puts the plug back in and then he's got the fucking grease gun,

1190
01:13:00.561 --> 01:13:03.330
he loops the chassis all up,
hits all the points.
Right?

1191
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:08.510
Like he fucking knows like he even knows what model you have and where,

1192
01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:12.750
where they all are.
Right?
He's just fucking looking for those plugs to fill up.

1193
01:13:12.751 --> 01:13:17.240
Right.
And meanwhile,
some other con at the top is supposed to drop,
you know,
four,

1194
01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:19.950
five,
six quarts oil,
whatever it takes to the top of your engine.

1195
01:13:19.951 --> 01:13:23.880
And sometimes they forget,
then you drive away,
right?
And then,

1196
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.721
then when are you going to do,

1197
01:13:24.721 --> 01:13:27.110
you're going to go down there and they're not going to give you your,

1198
01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:30.330
they're going to give you the amount of money that your car is worth,

1199
01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:35.910
which is the total fuck over.
Right?
Cause if it's a p,
you know,
like my car,
I,

1200
01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:37.620
I can't imagine what my car's worth right now.

1201
01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:41.850
I mean it has to be worth like maybe $1,200

1202
01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:48.900
but the thing is,
is for me to replace it,
the go out buy another car.
I mean I,

1203
01:13:48.901 --> 01:13:51.570
I can't buy a $1,200 fucking car.
You see what I'm saying?

1204
01:13:51.571 --> 01:13:54.300
So I was it down to the God dealership.
So anyways,

1205
01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:55.860
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

1206
01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:00.120
Some weeks I got diarrhea of the mouth and this is fucking one of them.
Um,

1207
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:01.920
that's it for the podcast.

1208
01:14:01.921 --> 01:14:05.190
I'm still trying to figure out a way to bring a couple of listeners.

1209
01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:10.770
I decided that a contest isn't the right fucking way to do it.

1210
01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:15.550
Um,
I want to have a couple of podcasts,
maybe couple of two,

1211
01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:19.710
three podcasts.
Listeners come in for the final table read,
um,

1212
01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:24.730
of the year provided you don't tell everybody what happened in the script,

1213
01:14:24.731 --> 01:14:28.210
which could also be a fucking problem.
I think this whole idea was stupid.

1214
01:14:28.450 --> 01:14:32.170
I think it was a stupid idea.
You know what?
Fuck that.
You know what?

1215
01:14:32.171 --> 01:14:37.060
Fuck it that offers off the table.
I'm sorry.
I just,
this day and age,

1216
01:14:37.061 --> 01:14:39.790
everybody's gonna fucking go.
Iaa won't fucking say anything.

1217
01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:41.530
And then you know what?
They're going,
they're going to go right away.

1218
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:44.650
And what did she do after all the Yay.
Yay.
Yet bullshit.

1219
01:14:44.651 --> 01:14:48.580
You're going to go right fucking down.
You're going to fuck me over.
I know.

1220
01:14:48.581 --> 01:14:52.690
Thinks it's too much of a risk.
I'll come up with something else.
All right,

1221
01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:57.010
here we go.
Hour and 15 minutes.
Say you go,
you guys enjoy your Monday,

1222
01:14:57.011 --> 01:15:01.870
you fucking cunts and uh,
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
Uh,

1223
01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:05.090
I have plugged guys,
have a nice couple of days there,
right?
See Ya.
