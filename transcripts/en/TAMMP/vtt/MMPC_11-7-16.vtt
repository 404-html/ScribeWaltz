00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.250
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.251 --> 00:00:05.370
It's bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:08.880
November 6th,
2016

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.240
<v 1>holy Shit,
dude.
I gotta stack my fucking Christmas shopping.</v>

5
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.500
<v 0>You know what?
You actually should at this point.
Wouldn't it be great?</v>

6
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.860
It'd be great to just think of every fucking goddamn person out there that you

7
00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:24.550
got to buy.
Four,
nine,
nine your kids.
All right.
You love your kids,
not your dog.

8
00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:26.680
You love your dog,
right?

9
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.460
What else is dead is your kids and your dog.
This is what it is,
right?

10
00:00:30.461 --> 00:00:33.160
You love your wife too,
but you know,
he noticed,
right?

11
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.560
Would it be great if you could just fucking go?
Just get it all fucking done.

12
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.920
Just call in sick one day.
You know exactly where you want to go.

13
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.910
Know Fuck gimme one at all.
He's give me fucking like a Dunkin donuts.

14
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.260
<v 1>Gimme a two fucking jellies are fucking powdered sugar.</v>

15
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.480
<v 0>Fuck true.</v>

16
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.480
Clay sent a curler except it's gifts,

17
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.980
you know?
Then you just have the lady down there,
wrap them for you.

18
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.010
The whole fucking,
I mean nice gifts though.

19
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.110
Nice thoughtful shit for like 10 15 fucking people,

20
00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:13.450
but you just knock it out in four hours,
right?

21
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.800
Then you take these fake hayfever pills and you walk into word like,
oh good,

22
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.450
well good.
I'll be around.
I'll be in my cubicle.
What happened?
You did.

23
00:01:22.451 --> 00:01:24.630
The whole fucking thing is done right?

24
00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:29.170
And then you can just sit there and chill for two things.
You should fucking do.

25
00:01:29.171 --> 00:01:30.004
I would,

26
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.980
this is what I'm actually talking out loud to myself and I'm not mad if you

27
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.030
listening.
All right?
Two things you gotta do.

28
00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:40.030
You gotta do fucking cardio right through the new year because you know you're

29
00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:43.960
going to eat and drink like a fucking pig.
You know what's happening.
All right.

30
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.650
You know it's the end of the year.
You know what I mean?

31
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.970
You get those few days off and you just start thinking,

32
00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:52.750
what if we just always had days off and everybody just fucking coked and your

33
00:01:52.751 --> 00:01:56.710
fucking drank and nobody gave a shit and there wasn't anything to do the next

34
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.250
day.
You know,

35
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.250
that wonderful feeling of actually living life while enjoying it as opposed to

36
00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:07.030
looking at dread at you fucking watch as to this is the next fucking Monday's

37
00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:10.750
coming,
you know,
so if you can just somehow knock it out,

38
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.040
you know what I mean?
Knock it out before the animal show up.
You know?

39
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.920
I mean,
it's just fucking,

40
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.820
it all starts on black Friday and then it just becomes fucking,

41
00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:26.530
just bad fathers.
And I dunno what ended December and all of that shit.

42
00:02:26.531 --> 00:02:30.880
So you knocked that out.
You do your half hour cardio every fucking day.

43
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.840
Go for it.
Whatever.
Fuck you do.
Eat a salad or some shit.
Just do something,

44
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.730
you know?
So,
you know,

45
00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:39.190
as I'm sitting here drinking a fucking Miller high life doing this fucking

46
00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:42.640
podcast,
um,
I should do that.

47
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.030
I should make a fucking list in my head right now.
All the nieces and nephews,

48
00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:48.940
what do they want?
How old are they?
Bang,
Bang,
boom.

49
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.980
I don't like that Internet shopping though.
You know,
you just go on Amazon.

50
00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:58.930
You just go around,
just click and shit.
Some reason it's not as fucking cool.
Um,

51
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.290
I actually found it accidentally found this really cool toy store.

52
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.420
Of course I was going out to a bar,

53
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.480
<v 2>okay.</v>

54
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.540
<v 3>And it was closed and everything,
but it actually had like wooden toys,</v>

55
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.490
like cars and shit,
like dead,
like uh,
you know,
the way they used to make them,

56
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.470
they didn't make him that way when I was a kid.

57
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:23.380
I remember my day say that Krystal is cheap shit.

58
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.390
When I was a kid crisis there was made out of metal and warden that the tires

59
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:30.400
were wearing a rubber,
right.

60
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.910
And our shit was all fucking plastic and God knows what else.

61
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:35.470
She put it in your mouth and next thing you know,

62
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:37.510
you are bad at math and you couldn't read out loud.

63
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:41.410
So you had to start telling jokes.
That's what happened.
Everything.

64
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.500
I was born during a fucking time when any fucking toy when you were a kid,

65
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.120
if you were the little kid going through the oral stage,
you know what?

66
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:50.920
They just stick their whole fucking hand in their mouth.

67
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:53.110
All your little brothers and shit,
every fucking toy you had it,

68
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:56.790
they put it in their mouth.
That was it.
You know,
they went from an eighth soon,

69
00:03:56.791 --> 00:03:58.030
went down to a B steward it,

70
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.840
and then they had all the colorful cereals with all that fucking shit in it.

71
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.640
They had fluff peanut butter and fluff sandwiches,
wheat man,
it was just fucking,

72
00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:07.810
it was a sugar coma.

73
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.740
<v 0>Um,
oh,
and I gotta tell you it was great.
Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

74
00:04:12.741 --> 00:04:14.000
You get a flood and other sandwich,

75
00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:17.240
then you put it on the banana splits of the monkeys,
you know,

76
00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:21.350
with the whole influence of the acid generation.
It's a good time,

77
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.011
dude.

78
00:04:26.011 --> 00:04:30.060
I saw a guy on a motorcycle today had a sh fucking suicide shifter behind him.

79
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.000
I always thought they kind of put it right down to the side.

80
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:36.450
They had it behind him.
I was uh,
I was dropping off some stuff.

81
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.940
Um,
you know,
I'm,
I'm getting rid of a bunch of shit that I have.
Um,

82
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.120
I bet you won't believe what the,
I bought one of those fucking,

83
00:04:45.121 --> 00:04:48.040
so what are those saws?
Card.
Not a table saw.
The one that you have just in head.

84
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.990
It's just handsaw.

85
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.090
I fucking bought a great one a few years ago cause I had this under,

86
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.160
I got into this whole thought process.

87
00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:59.340
Then I was going to start fixing shit around the house and that was going to

88
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:02.460
start woodworking or some shit like in my forties you know what I mean?

89
00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:05.700
Like it's,
it's over.
It's not going to happen.
You know what I mean?

90
00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:07.320
Unless you go take a class.
I don't know what,

91
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:08.940
but I didn't have time for that shit.

92
00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:11.040
So I bought this sink fucking top of the line thing.

93
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.760
I've had that thing for three years.
It's still in the fucking box.

94
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.920
And I finally just said,
Bill,
you got nothing to built.
Okay.

95
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.680
The problem with the House that you bought was everything was done by some

96
00:05:25.681 --> 00:05:29.820
fucking asshole like you after it was built after it was built as a bunch of do

97
00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:33.540
it yourself weekend warrior Horse Shit.
Okay,

98
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.250
so I took that.
I had this bicycle then it bought near.
She never used it.

99
00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:41.070
She used it long enough to fuck up all the gears,
you know what I mean?

100
00:05:41.071 --> 00:05:45.820
She didn't know that you could shift.
Well,
not pedaling.
You know,
I forget,

101
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.680
you know,
she's like 10 years younger than me,
so I forget.
I forget.

102
00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:52.740
They just grew up with automatic cars and they don't understand that shit has to

103
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:54.660
be turning when you're fucking pull the leavers down.

104
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.470
So that thing was fucked up.
Uh,

105
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.800
some old juicer just shit that was going to take up space in the kitchen.

106
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:04.100
I'm getting rid of that shit.
I got a bunch of old drum shit I'm getting rid of,

107
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:08.780
by the way,
by the way,
all my modern drummers,
all my drama,
uh,

108
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.440
Drum magazine magazines,
I'm getting rid of those things and I have like,

109
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.500
I have enough fucking drum videos to make a guard data to start a fucking music

110
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:19.970
store.
I never watch them.

111
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.850
There's a few that I'm going to keep the Steve Gadd up close to Tommy Aldridge.

112
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:30.650
One,
uh,
there's a couple that I,
that,
that I love.

113
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.850
Then I'm going to keep,
um,
maybe the Steve Smith's,

114
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.390
Kenny Aronoff,
but I have like a zillion other ones that like,

115
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:41.270
I just watched and they'd,
people were phenomenal,

116
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:44.690
but I just never learned anything from it.
David Garibaldi was a good one.

117
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:45.530
See this,
what's going to happen?

118
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:48.590
I'm going to go through the magazines because I know I've got a couple old ones,

119
00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:50.600
like Tommy Lee,
there's a John Bonham tribute.

120
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.000
I'm not getting rid of those fucking things,
but the rest of them,

121
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.980
there's like a music school,

122
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:57.950
if anybody knows out here in la that I could just donate those things too.

123
00:06:57.951 --> 00:07:01.700
They just,
they just like,
you know,
I'm not gonna be this.

124
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.270
I'm becoming like that fucking old lady,
you know,

125
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.540
or the guy who just doesn't throw any shit and he was shit out.

126
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:09.530
And I just have like,

127
00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:14.250
I literally have like a decade and a half a fucking drum magazines and uh,

128
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.460
what am I doing with them?
You know,

129
00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:19.160
I read them and I put them up on the shelf and then I get another one.

130
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:21.470
The next month they read it.
I put up on the shelf and I always think like,

131
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.230
oh yeah,
I'm going to go back to this one.
And I don't call back to it.

132
00:07:24.231 --> 00:07:26.810
Then I forget whatever article,
whatever music that they wrote out,

133
00:07:26.811 --> 00:07:29.240
I'm never going to fucking find it.
What am I doing with it?

134
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.720
Pass it on to somebody else.
Let them fucking use it.
You know.

135
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.220
Although what was good,
it was,
I was trying to fuck with,
uh,

136
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.520
was it where eagles dare,

137
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.920
iron maiden and I that one part that Doug [inaudible] dad is Piper Dat,
Dat,

138
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:43.940
Dat Gab like that patch.

139
00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:46.370
I never know what the fuck he was doing because the drums are sold low and the

140
00:07:46.371 --> 00:07:49.160
goddamn mix,
I can never figure it out.
And uh,

141
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:53.240
they actually had the music written out and a,
I did go on Youtube,

142
00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:56.330
but the guy there mentioned that drum magazine ad it.
And Lo and behold,

143
00:07:56.331 --> 00:08:00.470
I had that fucking issue but still still able to figure it out via youtube.

144
00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:03.920
So I'm going to get rid of a bunch of shit like that.
And uh,

145
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.680
because now that my fucking house has done,

146
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:11.710
I would also like to have it be a breathable little fucking funkshway there.

147
00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:15.440
You know what I'm saying?
Cause I got to tell you,

148
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.650
even though the fucker kitchen has come to a grinding halt because of all the

149
00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:22.910
wiring they had to do,
getting that fucking island out of there.
Ah,

150
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.040
it's the greatest fucking thing ever.

151
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:30.080
That adolescent fucking cow that I had laying in the middle of the fucking

152
00:08:30.081 --> 00:08:33.260
fridge.
I mean we're middle of the Goddamn a kitchen.

153
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.190
Finally got that the fuck out of their cell.
Anyways,

154
00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:39.980
but this isn't what I wanted to talk about this the Monday morning podcast,

155
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.900
my batteries written medium,

156
00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:45.110
which means it's probably going to fucking cut out on me right before I get to

157
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:50.030
an hour.
Um,
what else did I want to talk about?
Uh,

158
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.390
oh Jesus.
I was so,
I was watching a bunch of football this weekend,

159
00:08:53.391 --> 00:08:56.580
college and pro equally enjoyable.

160
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.550
<v 3>I got to start sticking up for the NFL because now everybody is just piling on</v>

161
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:03.750
talking about how their ratings are plummeting and all that shit.

162
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.790
What I think is they just,
they just,

163
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.110
they just got too broad based and now it's getting back to the numbers that it

164
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:11.790
realistically is.
You know what I mean?

165
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:16.600
It was almost like the housing bubble with someone who has a fucking shit shack

166
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.230
and for some reason it's worth 400 grand.
You're like,
that's worth 400 grand.

167
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.090
<v 4>Yeah.
The way the market's going,</v>

168
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.790
there's time next year it'll be worth 500 grand.
Right.

169
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.550
<v 3>That shit.
And then eventually the doll just topples on itself.</v>

170
00:09:29.551 --> 00:09:34.170
And so we find just goes to a,
that is a shack that you shit.
You know,

171
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.090
I mean I shit every day so you know,

172
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:38.820
I'll give you a five grand for it eventually.
That's what happens.

173
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:42.030
I think the NFL where they just,
you know,

174
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:47.180
they went from fucking 26 teams in my lifetime to 28 to 30 to 32 to fucking

175
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.480
wearing pink for a whole month to solute in the fucking troops to have in Bruce

176
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:59.481
Springsteen play at the halftime to fucking having it Monday night now Thursday.

177
00:10:00.421 --> 00:10:03.120
And then occasionally Saturday.
They just,
they got where they,

178
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.060
they got way too way too fucking big here

179
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.660
and now that they're just sort of adjusting it down,

180
00:10:10.661 --> 00:10:14.620
they kind of went through there.
Phil Collins Eighties years,
you know,

181
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.620
just getting away from the prog rock shit that they did,
like the prog rock of

182
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:21.583
<v 2>mmm.</v>

183
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.460
<v 3>The NFL was like the 60,
70,
50,
60 seventies.
Right.</v>

184
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.610
Then in the 80s they kind of peaked,
you know,

185
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.360
and then once they got no nineties wasn't bad somewhere I guess in like the two

186
00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:37.410
thousands,
I think it was like when Phil Collins started,
you know,

187
00:10:37.411 --> 00:10:41.580
doing covers the like the supreme shit,
you can't hurry love.

188
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.810
And you know,
there's a girl that's been,
Oh man,
man,

189
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.620
uh,
sue sue,
sue you like half of his shit.

190
00:10:51.621 --> 00:10:55.900
You couldn't even understand what it was.
I remember this dude,

191
00:10:55.901 --> 00:10:59.860
he used to wear a fucking tank top cutoff with the Ghostbusters logo on love

192
00:10:59.861 --> 00:11:00.694
Phil Collins.

193
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.240
And not only did I not like Ghostbusters never was into that fucking movie.
I,

194
00:11:05.241 --> 00:11:09.070
I couldn't stand that,
that Phil Collins Shit somewhere along the line,

195
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:13.870
you know,
your honor was,
was when he started lecturing me about the homeless.

196
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.600
You know,
I came home,
you know,
I put on MTV,
I want Ed to stake them.
Right.

197
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.710
God knows what happened to me that day.
I flunked a test,
you know,

198
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.040
somebody beat me up for having orange fucking hair,
Aj,

199
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.350
I just want to sit down and he'd be reminded of this shit.
Right?

200
00:11:29.351 --> 00:11:30.400
And all of a sudden he's at there,

201
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:35.460
oh think twice because it's another day for you and me can pay with days.

202
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.570
And I remember just watching that video going,
what the fuck happened to his lip?

203
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.080
You know,
is he a squealer?

204
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:49.130
Why's he got that little mark or the squealer run that he's still a song
anyways,

205
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.150
but when I'm,
what I'm really meant to say is it's,
it's great that he's back.

206
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.910
It's great that he's gone back out on tour.

207
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.770
One of the greatest fucking drummers of all fucking time.
Um,

208
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.010
I dunno,
it's just somewhere around in the air tonight.

209
00:12:04.011 --> 00:12:08.510
Then what are all that shit after that?
The Mike and the mechanics shit,

210
00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.420
all of that fucking shit.
It just,
it,
it's the,
uh,
you know,

211
00:12:11.421 --> 00:12:14.360
what never came back is the sound of the synthesizer.

212
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.700
It just is no way to make that sound quality.

213
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.960
It,
I don't know what the fuck do I know,
but just my own fucking opinion.
I just,

214
00:12:24.961 --> 00:12:29.590
I just feel like it's just,
it doesn't have any soul,
you know?
Oh,

215
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.130
Jesus,
but why don't you shut the fuck up.
Okay.
I,
well,
let's,

216
00:12:32.131 --> 00:12:36.120
let's talk about these new Hillary Clinton fucking commercials,

217
00:12:36.121 --> 00:12:38.070
which of course none of,
and the Trump ones,

218
00:12:38.071 --> 00:12:39.540
none of them talk about any sort of issue.

219
00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:44.340
They're just sort of talking about each other.
But what assholes they are,

220
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.570
you know,
it's like a,

221
00:12:45.571 --> 00:12:48.780
it's like two seventh grade girls just fucking starting rumors about each other.

222
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.710
They're not talking about the nature wide heroin epidemic then are talking about

223
00:12:52.711 --> 00:12:57.030
fuck,
uh,
uh,
the pharmaceutical companies trying to fucking make,

224
00:12:57.031 --> 00:12:58.920
we'd not legal at a state level again,

225
00:12:58.921 --> 00:13:02.850
because all the states where that's fucking legal.
You know,
the,

226
00:13:02.851 --> 00:13:06.660
the prescription medic,
uh,
prescriptions are all down.
They're losing money.

227
00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:08.490
So they're going to try to demonize it again,

228
00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:11.910
according to the person that I can't even remember who the fuck it is that told

229
00:13:11.911 --> 00:13:13.920
me that.
And then I never read it to see if it's true.

230
00:13:13.921 --> 00:13:17.220
But now I'm telling it to you.
I'm not talking about any of that shit.

231
00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:21.090
Great Barrier Reef is dead.
Who gives a fuck.
Right.
All right,

232
00:13:21.091 --> 00:13:23.040
let's trash the Hillary one first.
All right.

233
00:13:23.041 --> 00:13:27.360
The Hillary one about fucking Donald Trump is they're trying to go.

234
00:13:27.361 --> 00:13:29.010
Your kids are watching this.

235
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.780
What kind of precedent or are they going to see?
Okay,
which I get all right.

236
00:13:33.781 --> 00:13:35.040
This kids that are into politics,

237
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.210
but they show like six year olds like riveted.

238
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.360
Just talk to a fucking eye

239
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:46.630
to a fucking adult running run for office.

240
00:13:46.631 --> 00:13:48.480
I did you remember when you were six years old,
were you,

241
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.070
I don't even if what kids see nowadays when I was a kid,

242
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.190
when your parents put on the fucking news,

243
00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:57.590
remember that feeling in your stomach or was she was like they were making eats

244
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.420
spinach.
You're like,
Oh my God,
I've got to get outta here.
This is boring.

245
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.670
Anytime there were adults on TV,
was suits talking?
It was over.

246
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.720
I wanted nothing to do with ally and what cartoons.
I like sports.

247
00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:15.750
The bionic man.
What else did they have back then?

248
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.800
Little House in the prairie I liked for a little while and then it got it got

249
00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:23.670
old gross when fucking they brought that kid who,
who did he go?

250
00:14:23.671 --> 00:14:24.920
Definitely go black camera.

251
00:14:24.921 --> 00:14:29.921
Remember what the fucking Adam kid or some shit he started fucking the one with

252
00:14:30.331 --> 00:14:33.030
the pig tails.
It just got gross man.
I don't know.

253
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.760
I used to like watching the cowboys shit.
I like that,
that stuff.

254
00:14:35.761 --> 00:14:40.380
But anything that was remotely nightly news,
politics.

255
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.740
I vaguely remember a Richard Nixon crying

256
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.110
on the radio when I was riding,

257
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.440
I was riding in the car with my mother and she was trying to explain to me what

258
00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:55.760
was happening and I was like,
Oh wow,
okay.

259
00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.110
And I never thought like,
like wow,
this guy lied to the nation.

260
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.550
This is a president crying on the radio.
I had no concept of any of that.

261
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.450
I was just like,
all right,

262
00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:07.670
can I get out of the car right now because it's sunny out.

263
00:15:07.671 --> 00:15:09.740
We've been driving for a while and I think I'm going to throw up.

264
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.730
That's all I was thinking cause I was a fucking kid.
Okay.
People,

265
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:15.800
here's the deal.
I mean,

266
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.100
how fucking awful are you that you got to start talking about kids,

267
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.170
kids are watching this guy.
Um,

268
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.770
and then the Hillary one,

269
00:15:24.771 --> 00:15:27.710
I don't even know what the fuck or was it looked like a fucking pink Floyd
video.

270
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.340
I only,
I was cooking and I turned around.
I have,
I had the game on.

271
00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.210
I'm the one that Trump made about Hillary,
uh,

272
00:15:35.211 --> 00:15:40.190
which I want to say it was somebody dressed up like Hillary holding a pick ax or

273
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:41.490
something.
Like,
I didn't even know.

274
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.840
I never took a hallucinogen,
but you know,
that commercial maybe be like,
you know,

275
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.470
this would have been a great time

276
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.580
to done some acid to just watch that and like,
you know,

277
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.540
if he somehow made it like feature length,
that would have been fucking awesome.

278
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.110
But anyways,
I believe that the election is this week,

279
00:16:04.111 --> 00:16:07.650
I want to say it's Wednesday or is it Tuesday?

280
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.500
Maybe it's fucking Tuesday.
I have no idea.
Um,

281
00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.100
I know Wednesday the ninth I'm going to be on Conan O'brien and there will be a

282
00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:20.680
new president.
Is it going to be the first layer?

283
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:23.370
<v 5>Hmm.</v>

284
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.570
<v 3>You know,
which means Bill Clinton will be the first.</v>

285
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:28.560
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

286
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.930
<v 3>What the fuck would he be?
What we'd be called the first husband?</v>

287
00:16:30.931 --> 00:16:35.850
The first first husband I knew I'd be groundbreaking.
Jesus Christ.

288
00:16:35.851 --> 00:16:40.851
Can you imagine if that fucking cigar fucking sticking lunatic is back in there

289
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:45.780
and now he does even have a fucking job.
Jesus Christ.

290
00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:48.210
Hillary the first day is going to be like,

291
00:16:48.211 --> 00:16:50.610
get all these brides the fuck outta here.

292
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:56.510
I'm president.
Get up anything.
What?
The twine.

293
00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:01.990
Get it the fuck off Pennsylvania Avenue.
That's it.

294
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.290
They literally gonna they're gonna have to fucking wheel bill around like

295
00:17:05.291 --> 00:17:09.250
Hannibal Lecter on like one of those two wheelers.
You know what I mean?

296
00:17:09.251 --> 00:17:14.010
With the little fucking muzzle on them.
Jesus.
That animal might be coming back.

297
00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:20.160
I think he's going to,
I think,
uh,
I think Trump fucked up.

298
00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:23.240
He just said too much crazy shit.
And uh,

299
00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:28.210
he made the Clintons look sane and he's got no one to blame but himself.

300
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:32.340
That's my prediction.
All right.
If I was a betting man and I was going to Vegas,

301
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.630
unbelievable.
Right.

302
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.650
And Bernie Sanders is like that school that should have been allowed into the

303
00:17:39.651 --> 00:17:40.161
play off.

304
00:17:40.161 --> 00:17:44.930
It didn't fucking get in right cause all these fucking cops were too afraid to

305
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:48.440
vote for him because,
oh there's no way you could word.

306
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.490
<v 0>I saw somebody the other day on TV.
They did this whole fuck they did this.</v>

307
00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:55.470
They go I will.
Hillary has decay.

308
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.950
You got to make a smart decision either cause it's really hard.

309
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:04.670
This decision is really hard because Hillary had a bunch of felonies and Trump

310
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.190
and then they listed like all the shit that Trump did for like a minute.

311
00:18:08.191 --> 00:18:10.710
This is like a fucking like a TV show.

312
00:18:10.711 --> 00:18:14.370
I was just so fucking irresponsible I feel.
You know what I mean?

313
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.550
He's supposed to try to be like impartial,
right.
I bond being impartial.

314
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:20.760
I don't fucking like either one of them.

315
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.050
I just don't know how you trash one guy for fucking 90 God damn seconds and then

316
00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:28.380
you just,
you and all you say about the other person is just their felonies.

317
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.950
Why don't you just talk about the felonies that were brought up that the charges

318
00:18:31.951 --> 00:18:36.000
of those things.
You could talk about that for fucking 19 hours.
Oh No.

319
00:18:36.001 --> 00:18:40.080
She has a blue bra,
so therefore she must be a saint.

320
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:46.140
I'm off my fucking soapbox here.
Good luck to you guys.
I really mean that.

321
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:50.370
Good luck to you,
man.
I hope,
uh,
somehow we come out of this,

322
00:18:50.371 --> 00:18:54.960
we some out pick the fucking lesser of two fucking evils,
whatever that is.

323
00:18:55.490 --> 00:19:00.490
And I hope everybody reads and rereads all the propositions and all this shit

324
00:19:01.501 --> 00:19:05.970
that's attached to them.
I plan on fucking doing that for the first time ever.

325
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.700
I'm actually going to be an informed fucking voter when it comes to that shit

326
00:19:09.701 --> 00:19:14.520
because I don't think there's any winning at the presidential level.
No,

327
00:19:14.521 --> 00:19:18.780
Jesus Christ.
Anyways,
whoever wins,

328
00:19:18.781 --> 00:19:21.780
it's going to be a rough four years of speeches before the next one.
I mean,

329
00:19:21.781 --> 00:19:26.160
neither one of them are good public speaker.
Holy Shit.
I mean,

330
00:19:26.161 --> 00:19:29.310
Trump just goes out there and wings it like Trump.
When Trump gives a speech,

331
00:19:29.311 --> 00:19:31.860
he sounds like he's waiting for the headliner.
He was like stretching,

332
00:19:31.861 --> 00:19:33.240
waiting for the headliner to show up.

333
00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.120
It keeps looking at the back of the room and they're still making that stretch.

334
00:19:36.121 --> 00:19:40.800
See,
he's not here yet.
They said he's on his way.
Do another 10.

335
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:43.993
Um,

336
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:48.240
and then Hillary with that whole bobble head fucking thing that she does like

337
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:52.650
she is,
I haven't seen anybody so outside their own fucking body since Al Gore.

338
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.580
Remember Al Gore when he was fucking,

339
00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.760
I never forget he was doing a debate with George Bush and George Bush makes a

340
00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:02.820
point.
And then for whatever reason,
Al Gore's stood up,

341
00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:07.821
walked all the way over to George Bush and just goes my turn.

342
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.250
And is Aaron Bush does like a double take like,
dude,
what the fuck?

343
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.410
Sort of a natural reaction to this guy coming out.

344
00:20:13.411 --> 00:20:16.500
And I mean you could literally feel is fucking breath in his ear.

345
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.521
He fucking did this.

346
00:20:17.521 --> 00:20:22.500
Double take looking at them and the whole crowd laughed at Al Gore.

347
00:20:22.501 --> 00:20:26.010
And then Al Gore just threw his head back and for whatever reason started

348
00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:30.030
laughing just goes,
ha ha ha ha ha ha.
And I'm like,

349
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.210
what are you laughing at?
Like what the fuck are you doing?

350
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:34.690
<v 5>Okay.</v>

351
00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.480
<v 0>Like he,
he was a,
yeah,
that guy deck.
You know what that guy,</v>

352
00:20:37.481 --> 00:20:42.030
that guy read about his critics too much.
Like the first time they were like,
uh,

353
00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.680
he wasn't animated enough and the next time you went out there,

354
00:20:44.681 --> 00:20:48.460
he's doing like this Fossey Shit.
Um,
though Jesus Hebrew,

355
00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.090
<v 3>he redefined fucking flop.
Sweat that guy.
All right,
let's get out of politics.</v>

356
00:20:52.091 --> 00:20:54.850
I don't even,
what the fuck I'm talking anyways,
talking about here.

357
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:58.450
Let's do a little bit of advertising.
20 minutes into the kiss.

358
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.100
There are right Indochino Indochino Indo Chino,

359
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.750
who knows.
Talk about how every man looks better in a suit.
All right.

360
00:21:07.751 --> 00:21:11.320
You know what?
Everybody,
I think guys look good by,

361
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:16.170
I think they look even better in itself.
A look at that.
Yeah.

362
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:19.510
I actually don't think I,
it depends on where you're going.
All right.

363
00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.190
Depends on what's going on.
Okay.

364
00:21:21.191 --> 00:21:24.280
If I just had a fucking accident and somebody comes walking up to me in a suit,

365
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:28.300
I'm like,
this piece of shit is going to fucking destroy me in court.

366
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.170
That's what I think.
You know what I mean?
It all depends on the suit,
you know?

367
00:21:32.171 --> 00:21:34.960
But if you take a lady out,
you know,
if you're going out to dinner,

368
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:37.810
you wear a suit.
That's when you look better.
Okay.

369
00:21:37.811 --> 00:21:40.750
If I'm sitting across the desk and I needed a job and you've got the guys in the

370
00:21:40.751 --> 00:21:44.160
fucking suit,
uh,
you know,
breathing heavy,
they're not,

371
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.940
you don't look better in a suit.
You know what I mean?

372
00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.250
Although you know what's great about students?
If you're a fat fuck,

373
00:21:48.251 --> 00:21:51.520
you can't really see the man Ted so much.
You put the coat on,
so that's good.

374
00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:53.320
All right.
Is that good enough?

375
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:58.470
Indochino Indo Chino is one of the largest made to measure men's wear brands.

376
00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:02.110

381
00:22:20.741 --> 00:22:22.120
That's pretty cool though.

403
00:23:46.041 --> 00:23:48.650

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.350
He was a little magical,
but other than that,

425
00:25:12.351 --> 00:25:15.620
it was Kurt Russell eat another sandwich,
driving a truck,
if I remember.

426
00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.020
All right.
When it's over,
it's over.

436
00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:51.040
It feels nice and soft upon your tastes.
They might get wet,

437
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.560
but then they yay cause they dry up.

438
00:25:53.561 --> 00:25:58.561
All the moisture from your nod said they gained even dry out your clamp if it's

439
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:03.790
sweaty.
All right,
me undies.
Picture a picture.

440
00:26:03.791 --> 00:26:07.900
A world we're putting on a new pair of underwear isn't just fresh.

441
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:12.160
You're stepping into a better day.
God,
Daddy,
feel good.
Think about it.

442
00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.700
Underwear is the first thing you put on and then it's the last thing you take

443
00:26:15.701 --> 00:26:20.050
off.
Unless you're a fucking Weirdo.
Why would you settle for anything less?

444
00:26:20.051 --> 00:26:21.880
What if you just took off your pants and your underwear?

445
00:26:21.881 --> 00:26:26.170
He kept on your socks and your shoes you had on a vest and a bowler hat,

446
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:30.250
right?
And you just came running around the corner,

447
00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.490
not knowing what you're going to come out.
Jesus,
that's a fucking youtube,

448
00:26:33.491 --> 00:26:35.980
but you get 100 million hits on that.
All right.

449
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:39.160
Why would you settle for anything less than the best feeling underwear on the

450
00:26:39.161 --> 00:26:43.000
planet?
Because I'm easy to please,
you know,
as long as it covers my nuts,

451
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.240
you know,
I never really thought about it to be honest with you.
Me On.

452
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.270
If you're really asking me if that's number Torical,

453
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.810
please include all of the following points during your reads.
Absolutely.

454
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:56.250
Me undies focuses solely on producing the most comfortable underwear you've ever

455
00:26:56.251 --> 00:26:57.570
experienced.
That's all they do.

456
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.460
My friends have Anelli at [inaudible] sent me a few pair of while back.
Yes,

457
00:27:01.461 --> 00:27:05.430
they dead and now I can't imagine wearing anything else.
That's a crock of shit.

458
00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.280
And you never gave me any other ones.
One of them fed good.

459
00:27:08.281 --> 00:27:12.610
The other ones were a little too Greg Louganis,
if you know what I mean here.
Um,

460
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:17.610
it really makes each day that much better.
I'm one of those guys.
I've,
I think I,

461
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.110
I just buy underwear.
It was,
I just feel like I need it,
you know?
And uh,

462
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.270
but there's definitely shit in the rotation that's been in the league for a

463
00:27:25.271 --> 00:27:29.940
while.
You know,
since George Bush's first term,
you know,

464
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:35.040
I just,
you know,
they just don't wear out.
You know,
the covered up.
They're fine.

465
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:37.680
All right,

466
00:27:37.681 --> 00:27:40.500

But you said yes.
Okay.

a special fabric that's made with the best in class raw materials that are

475
00:28:07.591 --> 00:28:11.850
scientifically proven to be three times softer than cotton.

476
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.750
That has to be true because the cotton,
the lobby never came back like,
hey man,

477
00:28:15.751 --> 00:28:17.190

486
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.340
Um,
okay,
well I did something a little weird this week,
right?
What did I do here?

487
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:54.203
I fucking,

488
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.970
I tried to be slick hair and what I did was I copied and pasted only three of

489
00:28:59.971 --> 00:29:04.500
the reads,
three of the six.
So then I could immediately go into the questions.

490
00:29:04.501 --> 00:29:05.221
But then you know,

491
00:29:05.221 --> 00:29:08.400
I also want other shit that I wanted to talk about and it's all the way up here

492
00:29:08.401 --> 00:29:11.100
at the top.
See,
this is the problem.

493
00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:16.110
When you fuck with your daily routine.
All right.
What the fuck is this?

494
00:29:16.111 --> 00:29:21.030
Sorry guys.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Just relax.
Relax.
It's almost done.
Okay.
It's done.

495
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.120
All right.
What else do I want to talk to it?
How great it was.

496
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:26.160
The fucking giants eagles game.
Huh?
That's always a great game.

497
00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.640
And the same thing happens every fucking year.
The giants go up,

498
00:29:29.641 --> 00:29:33.870
they go up fucking big and then the eagle start coming back and most of the

499
00:29:33.871 --> 00:29:37.290
times they giants just can't fucking put them away today.
They did.

500
00:29:37.291 --> 00:29:39.900
I fucking love the NFC east.
And uh,

501
00:29:39.901 --> 00:29:42.130
I've watched so many giants games because of Versie.

502
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.220
<v 0>I actually root for the giants.
I shouldn't be doing that as a pat fed,</v>

503
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.313
<v 5>you know,</v>

504
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.380
<v 0>I don't,
you know what it is.
I just,</v>

505
00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:53.250
I don't have that fucking sports fan in me just because we lost to the fucking

506
00:29:53.251 --> 00:29:58.020
giants.
I mean,
did they,
did we robbed now we weren't.

507
00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.770
The guy did it to us twice.
He's fucking great for me to not like Eli would be,

508
00:30:01.771 --> 00:30:04.800
I'd have to not like Tom Brady.
Cause then I'm saying I don't like greatness.

509
00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:06.400
Plus,

510
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.600
w one of the most interesting things to do is to watch Eli manning throughout

511
00:30:09.601 --> 00:30:11.130
the course of a football season.
I'm telling you,

512
00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:15.480
this is when he starts waking up.
He's fucking bored.

513
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.850
It's September,
October,
eh,
it stretches a little bit in November,

514
00:30:20.851 --> 00:30:22.260
and then when they need to win the last six,

515
00:30:22.261 --> 00:30:24.910
seven fucking games are all through out of the playoffs.

516
00:30:24.911 --> 00:30:28.020
Then he starts playing like a champ and they get on a fucking roll.

517
00:30:28.021 --> 00:30:29.820
I'm telling you if this guy knows what he's doing,

518
00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:33.030
whereas his brother from day one was,
are are protection your shoes.

519
00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:35.670
He went out there like a fucking lunatic from day one.

520
00:30:35.671 --> 00:30:40.420
I think he burned himself up by the time he got to the playoffs.
I don't know.

521
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:44.350
That's just a theory.
Got,
dammit.
That's a delicious beer.
Every once in a while,

522
00:30:44.351 --> 00:30:47.350
you know,
every once in a while,
you know,

523
00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:51.280
you just take what you'd take a sip of a beer and it takes you back to the first

524
00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:54.010
time you got fucking hammered,
you know?

525
00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:58.690
Where were you the first time he got drunk?
I was at Faneuil Hall in Boston.

526
00:30:59.260 --> 00:30:59.860
You know,

527
00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.240
a stone's throw from the comedy connection where I would be performing a mere

528
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:07.330
eight years later,
right.
And I was drinking Michelob lights.

529
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:12.010
So the only place I've ever been able to find Michelob light is in New Orleans.

530
00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:15.760
And a,
I always drink one.
Whenever I go down there,
that's a tradition.

531
00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:20.420
Some people go down there,
they go down there for the Gumbo or the fucking,
uh,

532
00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:24.610
we'll creole fucking whatever the fuck the music and all that call that shit.

533
00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:26.830
I go down there,
there's this store,

534
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.120
it's right down by where the fucking Choo Choo train goes down the street there

535
00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:36.190
and they sell,
it says fucking shit off.
It's down near there,
Harris,

536
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.390
it's legal liquor store and you know,
it's got all this bullshit now and they go,

537
00:31:40.391 --> 00:31:44.530
I always buy,
I buy a single and I just fucking walk around,

538
00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:45.940
listen to the music,

539
00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:50.860
trying to not make eye contact with the unbelievable amount of shady fucking

540
00:31:50.861 --> 00:31:54.510
people in New Orleans.
One of the most shady as fuck.

541
00:31:54.511 --> 00:31:57.160
And I can honestly say that dude,
like there,
there is something,

542
00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:02.020
something wrong with that city in a good way.
And in a bad way,

543
00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:05.530
I'm telling you it's fucking good.
So I love the city.

544
00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.210
Absolutely fucking love it,

545
00:32:07.211 --> 00:32:11.120
but it's got some of this shady as fucking people I've ever seen in my life.
And,

546
00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.480
and am just not blaming the locals,

547
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:17.860
the fucking people that show up down there,
Jesus fucking Christ.

548
00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:22.150
I mean Berberine Street,
like no young people go there.

549
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:26.320
You know what I mean?
Going to Bourbon Street is,
is like,
that was,
I don't know,

550
00:32:26.321 --> 00:32:29.110
when it stopped being cool somewhere with my generation born,

551
00:32:29.111 --> 00:32:32.350
I go on Bourbon Street,
even during the day,
the fucking shit show it is.

552
00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.750
And I just see these bloated fucking people from my generation with the tramp

553
00:32:37.751 --> 00:32:38.584
stamps,

554
00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:43.740
the wire and tribal tattoos going around these fucking guys with these

555
00:32:43.911 --> 00:32:48.770
grandmother,
flabby arms,
man.
But you know what it is,
dude,
they had kids,

556
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.690
you know,
so I was able to stay in show Biz cause uh,
you know,

557
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:58.450
I ain't no Fada so,
um,
I dunno,

558
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.180
but the fucking humanity that I see down there,
it's just,
it's just not dying.

559
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.140
It's just fucking ridiculous.
All right,
let's,
um,

560
00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:06.190
let's move on and let's talk a little bit of college football.
Fucking,

561
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.660
I'm about Lsu,
man.
What a game they gave Alabama,
man,

562
00:33:08.661 --> 00:33:11.920
that was not a fucking easy game.
No one Alabama.
Which

563
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.033
<v 7>that</v>

564
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:18.620
<v 0>all right.
That's how everybody in northern Alabama speaks.
It's unbelievable.</v>

565
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:19.750
You get down near Auburn,

566
00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:23.470
like all of a sudden people would just speaking eloquently,
you know,

567
00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:27.550
Ladies Gentlemen,
you get to the north man,
you get north up there,
you know,

568
00:33:27.551 --> 00:33:29.560
you start getting close to at Tennessee border.

569
00:33:29.561 --> 00:33:32.500
You don't know what the fuck you're going to run into.
Okay?

570
00:33:32.501 --> 00:33:36.970
Those are crazy people,
right?
Like powers booth should be in a swamp.

571
00:33:36.971 --> 00:33:40.330
You know what I mean?
Little southern comfort up there.
You know,
if you get down,

572
00:33:40.331 --> 00:33:44.650
you know,
mobile,
Alabama,
you know Auburn University though,
those,
you know,

573
00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.200
it was a great people.
Mobile,
Alabama.
I mean,

574
00:33:47.201 --> 00:33:51.580
how many fucking battleships did they build,
you know,
or World War Two.

575
00:33:51.581 --> 00:33:53.980
What the fuck were they doing up at Crimson tide country?

576
00:33:53.981 --> 00:33:57.130
They weren't doing shit.
Oh,
they doing up there?
Huh?

577
00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.720
Fucking looking at this stills.
Um,
I'm just fucking with you.

578
00:34:01.721 --> 00:34:04.150
I don't know how the fuck I ended up.
Jesus Christ,

579
00:34:04.151 --> 00:34:06.730
look at the fucking cheerlead is on the 40.
Niners

580
00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:10.710
I'm sorry,
I got the NFL network playing in the

581
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:14.370
<v 7>background.
I'm watching.
Uh,
Colin Kaepernick.
Oh look,</v>

582
00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:19.800
<v 0>he almost broke it.
31 to 24.</v>

583
00:34:19.801 --> 00:34:24.720
The one in six San Francisco fucking 40 niners dead down to the three and four

584
00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:28.800
New Orleans,
New Orleans saints.
These were great games this week.

585
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:32.550
You know,
I got to tell you this,
this is how my weekend goes.

586
00:34:32.551 --> 00:34:35.340
I always watched the fucking patriots.
All right.

587
00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:40.200
And I always watched the fern Lundquist Gary Danielson game,
uh,

588
00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:42.750
college football.
And then I always watched the Joe Buck,

589
00:34:42.751 --> 00:34:46.260
Troy Aikman game plus the Patriots.
I mean,
if you fucking do that,

590
00:34:46.261 --> 00:34:47.880
there's no way you're not going to like football.

591
00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.760
I don't know what this bullshit is about.
I'll,
I'll,
you know,

592
00:34:50.761 --> 00:34:54.450
all these people running away from the fucking game and the games change,

593
00:34:54.451 --> 00:34:58.680
and this is a fucking great game.
This game right here at 31 to 20,
right?

594
00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:01.570
It's nine minutes fucking left.
Cap Her next,
driving

595
00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.470
<v 7>down the failed.
We get to learn.</v>

596
00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:13.760
<v 0>Jesus Christ 88.
What are you doing?
He's got on a breath,
right strip.</v>

597
00:35:13.761 --> 00:35:16.150
He should get,
he should have an a fucking catch right strip there.

598
00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:21.430
Hit you right in your fucking hands.
You asshole.
Nine 21 to go in the third.

599
00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:22.840
If anybody's taping the game,

600
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.180
Colin Kaepernick somehow get the Afro underneath the fucking the fucking helmet.

601
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:32.380
Look at this duck hunter.
Looking at the place.
This guy looks confused.

602
00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:37.040
All right.
They're lining up for the play.
All right,
and in the center column

603
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.000
98.
Yeah.
Yeah.

604
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:44.540
Bravo 72 to Mike [inaudible].
He's on.

605
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.850
Well,
you walked away.
They walked away.
What are they doing?
Yeah,
Jesus Christ.

606
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:53.410
I thought something exciting was going to happen.

607
00:35:53.411 --> 00:35:56.200
You don't need to look for that.
All right,
here we go.
Um,

608
00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:00.970
I barely been watching my Bruins.
I know we beat Tampa Bay.

609
00:36:00.971 --> 00:36:02.620
Then we lost to the fucking ranges,

610
00:36:02.621 --> 00:36:05.450
which I think they've already beaten this twice this year.
And uh,

611
00:36:05.451 --> 00:36:09.850
I know Tampa Bay has a legitimate shot to get to the Stanley Cup.
Uh,

612
00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.130
I don't know where the rangers are wrapped,

613
00:36:11.131 --> 00:36:15.660
but I just feel like we're in another middle of the road kind of team.
But,
um,

614
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:17.530
well my kitchen is done.

615
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:22.210
What kitchen has done it and I can get back to my fucking house where I have,

616
00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:26.290
I have all the sports packages people,
I get the NBA fucking hardcore,

617
00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:30.580
whatever the fuck they call it.
I got the NHL Center ice,
I got Nfl Sunday ticket,

618
00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.360
I watch the Formula One.
This is what the fuck I do.
I have no life.

619
00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:37.930
I watch all of this shit.
I watch college football,
you know,

620
00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:41.230
and for whatever reason,
my wife leaves me alone and let's me do it,

621
00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:45.550
which is probably why I married,
you know,
that's the deal.

622
00:36:45.551 --> 00:36:46.810
If you want to know if you're with the right woman,

623
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:50.790
order all the sports packages and just see how she fucking handles that.
Um,

624
00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:53.500
I got to tell you,
she's had some,
she had some people over this week,
right?

625
00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:58.540
Some of her relatives and shit.
And like,
it's all women.
All fucking ladies.

626
00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:02.440
Right?
And they're in there watching this car Dashi and shit.
So I walk in,

627
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.540
there's one TV in the house,
and I go,
okay,

628
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:07.840
I'm going to be on my best fucking behavior.
I lasted like,

629
00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:11.770
I think I lasted three minutes.
I was what they were watching,

630
00:37:11.771 --> 00:37:13.300
keeping up with the Kardashians,

631
00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:18.220
and I was literally watching two of them driving on the four oh five freeway

632
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:22.870
talking about nothing like the bearded guys going,
oh my God,

633
00:37:22.871 --> 00:37:25.710
look at that lady when she does a lady in the car next door.
She got,

634
00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.360
she has on a fucking mass,
but the fucks with her,

635
00:37:28.361 --> 00:37:31.210
and then the other girl was like,
I want to get some yogurt.

636
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:32.860
Let's get some frozen yogurt.

637
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:39.710
Why are you watching this?
And they're like,
riveted.
They'd like,
they,

638
00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:44.680
they cannot get enough of it,
you know?
Meanwhile,
I'm like three episodes behind.

639
00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:48.610
I'm sealing on episode two of a,
of Westworld.

640
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.150
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

641
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.451
<v 0>Yeah.
No,</v>

642
00:37:50.451 --> 00:37:53.990
I've been watching Westworld and I've been watching Atlanta who Chris Rock said,

643
00:37:53.991 --> 00:37:57.390
that's the best show on TV,
right?
I think he's a little biased.
You know?

644
00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.120
I think it was a little fucking lighter skinned like me.

645
00:37:59.121 --> 00:38:01.490
He'd also like fucking Westworld,
but they're both phenomenal,

646
00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:06.800
phenomenal fucking shows.
Uh,
highly recommend both of them,
the way they're shot.

647
00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:08.270
I mean,
Atlanta looks like a fucking,

648
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:11.450
it was like an award winning movie every single episode,
right?

649
00:38:11.451 --> 00:38:14.780
Just some of the shots that they get and the writings.
Unbelievable.

650
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:18.050
And a Westworld is just a whole other level for me.

651
00:38:18.051 --> 00:38:21.530
So I got to get caught up with all of that shit.
But enough of my ramblings.

652
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:27.170
Let's get into some of the,
uh,
the questions here for the week that people have.

653
00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:31.010
You know,
I mentioned,
uh,
you know,
all of that topless shit,

654
00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.910
like why women want to do it or certain women want to do it.

655
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.880
Like that's coming up again here this week.
Let's see.
Uh,

656
00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:41.860
I guess that's not for a couple of here.
Gave you a little teaser there.

657
00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:47.200
All right.
Nat Geo Lee,
Leo Dicaprio documentary.
All right.

658
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.053
Nat Geo,

659
00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:53.890
National Geographic and Leonardo Dicaprio made this great documentary about

660
00:38:53.891 --> 00:38:55.840
climate change and I think you would love it.

661
00:38:56.170 --> 00:39:00.670
It's free on youtube until November 6th after that.
Probably costs a few dollars.

662
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:04.960
If you'd watch it.
I'd love to hear your thoughts about it on the podcast.
Um,

663
00:39:04.961 --> 00:39:07.330
I gotta be honest with you,
I'm,
I'm terrified to watch it.

664
00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:12.820
I'm terrified to watch all of that cause that's the shit that these two fucking

665
00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:17.020
dopes that are running for office should be talking about.
And they don't,

666
00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:19.990
they just make fucking commercials about how the other person's an asshole.

667
00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:26.100
But I,
you know what I'll do?
I'll check it out.
I'll check it out when it,

668
00:39:26.101 --> 00:39:30.730
what if I ignore it?
Does that mean it's not happening?
Um,
you know something,

669
00:39:30.731 --> 00:39:35.140
I'm going to tweet out the link here and you guys can watch it if you want to.

670
00:39:35.141 --> 00:39:36.130
I'm not trying to be that guy.

671
00:39:36.131 --> 00:39:40.060
Fortunate politics down your fucking throat or trying to ruin your fucking

672
00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:44.080
avocado and toast sandwich there,
but if you want to watch it,
check it out.

673
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:47.800
Alright.
Uh,
who's who is buying million dollar condos in la?

674
00:39:47.801 --> 00:39:52.801
This is what I asked out here because there is this massive amount of building

675
00:39:53.081 --> 00:39:57.490
going on here to buy an apartment out.
Building out here is just so fucking high.

676
00:39:57.491 --> 00:39:58.540
It's ridiculous.

677
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:02.700
Anybody with half a fucking brain is not buying right now cause it's all going

678
00:40:02.701 --> 00:40:06.460
to fucking crash.
This happens every fucking take a full three,
four,

679
00:40:06.461 --> 00:40:10.810
five years cycle.
Every fucking time.
You can't lose.
There's no way to lose.

680
00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:14.910
You can't fucking lose.
One day you wake up right there,
Fred,

681
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:17.320
you're lost to go fuck himself.
Um,
and then,

682
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:19.780
then the smart people then swoop in and it's,

683
00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:22.030
you're crying with your pockets turned inside out.

684
00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:26.830
They come in and actually pay less than what you paid in less than the market

685
00:40:26.831 --> 00:40:29.830
value.
Those are the guys that fucking win.
Um,
so here we go.

686
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:35.470
A bill that Chinese and other foreign investors are buying up expensive real

687
00:40:35.471 --> 00:40:40.060
estate in major US markets because our currency is more stable than their

688
00:40:40.061 --> 00:40:43.000
homelands.
Ah,
okay.

689
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:45.160
May or may not be another bubble,

690
00:40:45.161 --> 00:40:50.050
but definitely makes it so regular folk have a hard time finding a place to
live.

691
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:55.330
Just type Chinese buying into Google and see what it auto fills go.

692
00:40:55.331 --> 00:40:59.650
Eagle swell.
I sorry about she eagles.
Uh,
they did play a great game though,

693
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:03.730
um,
to allow scariest fucking sprawls.
Oh my God,

694
00:41:03.731 --> 00:41:08.360
I'm so glad that guy's not in my fucking division.
He almost took it.
He did.

695
00:41:08.361 --> 00:41:10.490
He take another one backer.
He almost took one back.
That's right.

696
00:41:10.491 --> 00:41:12.350
They knocked them out of like the 15 yard line.

697
00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:17.010
He does that every fucking year to the giants it seems.
Anyways.
Um,

698
00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:20.670
all right,
well here's my question.
If that's like a safe thing to do,

699
00:41:20.671 --> 00:41:23.400
like say that dollar was crashing and all of a sudden I started buying shit in

700
00:41:23.401 --> 00:41:27.180
France.
I wouldn't overpay for it.
Well,

701
00:41:27.181 --> 00:41:30.450
maybe they're crashed and so quick they don't give a fuck that they overpaid for

702
00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.460
Ra Chinese.

703
00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:35.630
John Chinese.

704
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:38.840
<v 3>Uh,
first thing that comes up is food.
Hang on a second.</v>

705
00:41:38.841 --> 00:41:43.490
What was I supposed to look up?
Chinese buying.
All right,

706
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:44.180
here we go.

707
00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:49.180
Buying Useu you say no to Chinese.

708
00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.990
China buying the world.
Are they buying the world?

709
00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:55.600
China's Dalian.

710
00:41:55.601 --> 00:41:59.290
Wanda group buys Dick Clark productions for 1 billion.

711
00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:05.330
Now.
What of that's really well put.
The fuck is going on there.

712
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:11.250
There wasn't an American Chinese guy who could have done it a day or we got to

713
00:42:11.251 --> 00:42:14.760
keep Dick Clark stuff on this side of the border.
And if elected,

714
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.440
I don't even know what the guy owns.

715
00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:21.680
Wealthy Chinese buyers are growing a growing force in US real estate.

716
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:25.080
All right,
this one seems a little bit,
okay.
This is the Washington Post.

717
00:42:25.081 --> 00:42:28.110
This seems a little more tethered here to the ground here.
Um,

718
00:42:28.111 --> 00:42:31.950
after a long and painful slide falling the real estate collapse in 2008,

719
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:35.370
Seattle's property market isn't joining one of the sharpest rises anywhere in

720
00:42:35.371 --> 00:42:38.250
the u s Boyd by a rapidly expanding economy,

721
00:42:38.251 --> 00:42:41.040
there has brought tens of thousands of high paying jobs to the city.

722
00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.820
Real estate values have nearly doubled since 2000,
since 2009,

723
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.620
according to online real estate database,
Zillow.
Oh,
is that really credible?

724
00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.830
Zillow's not credible by the way,
cause I see what they,
what they say,

725
00:42:52.831 --> 00:42:55.680
what my house is worth and what the fuck I paid for it.

726
00:42:55.681 --> 00:43:00.060
It's not even that they're not right.
All right.
Yet while technology,
uh,

727
00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:05.090
billionaires gobbles up real estate from Puget sound and Lake Washington,

728
00:43:05.371 --> 00:43:09.420
Jim Conlin or real estate broker and the [inaudible] on Canva,

729
00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.190
um,

730
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:16.200
says the real estate careless for sites for the dramatic upswing can be found in

731
00:43:16.201 --> 00:43:17.070
China.
To be honest,

732
00:43:17.071 --> 00:43:20.100
Chinese buyers have been flooding this market for the past few years.

733
00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:25.400
Some of them buy homes sight unseen while others traveled here for a kind of

734
00:43:26.041 --> 00:43:30.360
real estate tourism and buy real estate after only one viewing.

735
00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:35.920
Oh,
all right.
Oh,
is that bad?

736
00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:37.750
<v 5>Okay.</v>

737
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:39.190
<v 3>Why would that be bad?
Like what,</v>

738
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:41.350
what exactly could happen if they're buying it all up?

739
00:43:41.351 --> 00:43:45.540
I guess that's driving the price up.
You know,

740
00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:48.160
the banks did it in 2008

741
00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:54.100
at least.
These fucking people have money.
You know,

742
00:43:54.101 --> 00:43:57.430
it's not like back in the day when you made $40 working in a soup kitchen and

743
00:43:57.431 --> 00:44:01.130
they go,
hey,
you want to buy a fucking house for 400 grand?
You qualified,
do I?

744
00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:06.100
Yes.
Sign here.
Um,
so that's better than the last thing.

745
00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.690
All right,
well maybe it isn't a bubble.

746
00:44:07.691 --> 00:44:09.580
All I know is I can't compete with these cons.

747
00:44:09.581 --> 00:44:14.581
So my dream of buying a a apartment building in La is rapidly diminishing.

748
00:44:15.131 --> 00:44:19.000
I got an idea.
How by,
when are you people,
you know,

749
00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:23.620
can I invest with you?
Can I take,
can I take 15% of the fucking risk?

750
00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.750
I'll do that.
Come on.

751
00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.690
When are you fuckers has gotta be listening to this on your Chinese Internet?

752
00:44:28.691 --> 00:44:32.670
He allowed to do it.
So many in Kong.
I've been out there.

753
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:37.440
I did a fucking show where it was you.
All right.
Indigo girls.
All right.

754
00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:40.750
Hey Bill.
So when I was growing up,
my mom really loved the indigo girls,
so,

755
00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:43.800
so did I.
I went to the doctor.

756
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:48.960
Fucking is all right.
And she wrote in parenthesis,
no,
she wasn't a lesbian.

757
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:52.620
What does that have to do is just Chris,
are they lesbians?
I assume?

758
00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.140
I don't know why I thought if they were,
you know,

759
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.290
I don't know if it was the Woodstock fucking from peanuts haircut,

760
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.800
you know that a lot of them favor,
I don't know.

761
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:05.340
It's really funny how different groups of people,
they just favor a haircut,

762
00:45:05.341 --> 00:45:09.180
like rednecks just loved the mullet,
you know what I mean?

763
00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:12.960
Boston psychos for a while.
The big thing was to shave,

764
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:18.090
like to have no sideburns and just have the straight line,
you know?
Right.
Right.

765
00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:21.630
Above year year,
they went to the back to some sort of rat tail,

766
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:24.180
you know those people with their fucking shell toed,

767
00:45:24.181 --> 00:45:27.210
Adidas Nicoletta Claddagh Dude.
So anyways,

768
00:45:27.211 --> 00:45:30.720
so probably the first five concerts I went to were indigo girls.

769
00:45:30.721 --> 00:45:35.721
I specifically remember calling into Oh one oh 7.3 w a f I remember that.

770
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.870
Debbie AOL.
Oh,
kick ass.
Rock and roll was WC.
Oh,
Z,

771
00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:41.230
<v 2>okay.</v>

772
00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:45.760
<v 3>Waf was on Wooster needs to go Worcester,
Boston.
It's just like,</v>

773
00:45:45.761 --> 00:45:46.594
well what is it?

774
00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:52.000
And then it's Worcester and Boston fuck in Massachusetts.

775
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:54.340
They were actually on worster,
if I remember correctly.

776
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:55.833
<v 2>MMM.</v>

777
00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:57.550
<v 3>Fucking Boston,</v>

778
00:45:57.551 --> 00:46:02.260
Massachusetts kid and asking a Dj for tickets to something because I had only

779
00:46:02.261 --> 00:46:07.180
ever seen the indigo girls and he asked if we had a 12 inch sausage in the

780
00:46:07.181 --> 00:46:10.300
freezer.
I didn't get it at the time.
Hey,

781
00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:15.790
I still really liked him,
but I don't listen to folk rock that much more anymore.

782
00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:20.470
Can you believe how just openly like homophobic and crazy people could be back

783
00:46:20.471 --> 00:46:21.304
in the day?

784
00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:23.610
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

785
00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:28.170
<v 3>That indigo girls singing from the podcast had me belly laughing at my fucking</v>

786
00:46:28.171 --> 00:46:32.610
desk at work to the point where people were giving me dirty look.
Fucking Christ.

787
00:46:32.611 --> 00:46:37.230
Thank you man.
Seriously.
That was the best.
Uh,
yeah.
Indigo girls are great.

788
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:39.420
Um,
I haven't seen only one song that I know.

789
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.153
<v 2>MMM.</v>

790
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:47.210
<v 3>Closer.
Closer.
I am to five.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I remember that song.</v>

791
00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:52.440
All right.
Feminist Fan.
Get the fuck Outta here.
Hey Bill,

792
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:57.170
I'm a huge fan and a big old feminist.
All right.
Welcome.
How are you?
Uh,

793
00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:02.480
my husband played me your epidemic of gold digging whores bid on our third date

794
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:07.110
and I went from hating you to almost pissing myself laughing in three seconds.

795
00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:10.680
I would love to know what bid I did that made you hate me or did you just look

796
00:47:10.681 --> 00:47:11.880
at me,
which I understand.

797
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:16.080
She said I'd been a devoted fan and a podcast listener ever since.

798
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.430
Probably once a month.

799
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:21.960
I'll write a very heartfelt and sincere email to you about something you said,

800
00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:24.680
but then you make an endearing comment like,

801
00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:27.260
<v 2>uh,</v>

802
00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:31.420
<v 3>then you'll make an endearing comment.
What the fuck do I know?
I'm a moron.</v>

803
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.710
And I realized that I'm also a moron and you're a comedian.

804
00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:39.250
I shouldn't take things so seriously.
So I delete the email and move on.
Yeah.

805
00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:43.000
You know,
it's called being an adult may know that I'm a fucking dope.

806
00:47:43.001 --> 00:47:45.460
And then you realize it that I admitted that I was a dope.

807
00:47:45.461 --> 00:47:48.340
So then you don't have to be all fucking taking shit seriously.

808
00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:53.350
Was that too intellectual people with all the F words in there?
She said,

809
00:47:53.351 --> 00:47:57.430
but with this election,
I still feel I have to write in Ah,

810
00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:03.610
son of a bitch.
You just waltzed me around the warm Rome.

811
00:48:03.611 --> 00:48:08.280
You got me all warm and fuzzy now he had comes to fucking write up the fucking,

812
00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:12.220
yet I gave it comes to the uppercut.
But with this election stuff,

813
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:16.150
I feel like I have to write in.
Okay.

814
00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:19.690
I totally get where you're coming from on how corrupt the Clintons are.

815
00:48:19.691 --> 00:48:24.580
This is what every Clinton support.
I get it.
She's the devil.
Having said that,

816
00:48:24.581 --> 00:48:27.910
now I'm going to talk 15 minutes about how fucked up Trump is there.

817
00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:32.860
They're both fucking horrific.
Anyways,
she goes and she goes,

818
00:48:32.861 --> 00:48:33.850
okay,
all right,
let me start.

819
00:48:33.851 --> 00:48:36.310
Let me at least give her the chance to fucking say her opinion here.

820
00:48:36.311 --> 00:48:40.780
Before I fucking jumped back up on my pasty soapbox here.
She said,

821
00:48:40.781 --> 00:48:43.660
I totally get where you're coming from and how corrupt the Clintons are and how

822
00:48:43.661 --> 00:48:47.050
fucked up the whole system is and that the Illuminati is probably pulling the

823
00:48:47.051 --> 00:48:50.890
strings either way.
Uh,
but I'm,
I'm fucking around when I say that.

824
00:48:50.891 --> 00:48:51.724
I just think people are,

825
00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:54.400
they get a little nuts when they get a lot of power anyways,

826
00:48:54.401 --> 00:48:56.860
but on major things you seem to care about,

827
00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.740
like the environment and corporate influence on politics.

828
00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:03.310
Trump is on the opposite side of the spectrum for you as is Hillary Clinton

829
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:09.280
as his Obama.
What the fuck did Obama ever do?
What of Democrats or Republicans,

830
00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:13.840
they don't do fucking shit.
They don't do anything about any of that fucking,

831
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:17.650
uh,
any of the shit that's going on out there.

832
00:49:17.651 --> 00:49:19.960
They don't do anything because they need all of their fucking money.

833
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:21.520
So stop with this.
Fucking,

834
00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.580
they wearing light blue and they care about the butterflies.

835
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:28.900
Hillary Clinton doesn't give a flying fuck about anything,

836
00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:33.520
but what other next price of zillion dollar real estate she could park her

837
00:49:33.521 --> 00:49:37.480
fucking corrupt twat on.
That felt good,
right?

838
00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:41.170
If old orange,
if then orange wicked cut doesn't get there first.

839
00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.240
Whew.
Okay.

840
00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:47.230
It's like Clintonism mechanic that's been working on your car for years and the

841
00:49:47.231 --> 00:49:49.510
car runs,
but there's always some issue with it.

842
00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:53.650
And even though she'll throw in a free air freshener now and then she's always

843
00:49:53.651 --> 00:49:56.740
pulling shit,
like getting you to replace your shots,
you need to,

844
00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:59.920
I don't know anything about cars.
I'm hoping this analogy makes sense.

845
00:49:59.921 --> 00:50:02.740
I'm trying to relate to you.
So you're like,
fuck it.

846
00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:06.870
I'm not gonna I'm not going with Clinton anymore.
Um,
I,

847
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:08.440
I think I kind of get what you're saying that,

848
00:50:08.441 --> 00:50:13.330
but you're really over simplifying this as does everybody when they're defending

849
00:50:13.331 --> 00:50:14.890
the person that they're gonna vote for.

850
00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:18.970
I just want you as a fucking human being to just say that Hillary Clinton,

851
00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:22.810
you know,
is a horrific choice.
The same way Trump is,

852
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:27.410
that they're fucking horrific choices.
No matter how you slice it.
You know,

853
00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.380
if the best thing you say about Clinton is she's not Trump,

854
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:32.323
<v 5>right?</v>

855
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:35.920
<v 3>And the best of the best he said about Trump and early,
she's not Clinton.
I mean,</v>

856
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:39.850
to be honest with you there,
they're fucking,
they're animals.
Uh,
sorry.
Uh,

857
00:50:39.851 --> 00:50:43.480
but then Trump is some dude on your blog who has three rusted out cars in his

858
00:50:43.481 --> 00:50:48.310
backyard.
No,
he isn't.
He's constantly defaulting on debt.
No,
he doesn't.

859
00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.220
And none of his neighbors have anything nice to say about him.
He,

860
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:55.390
we went bankrupt like three,
four times.
He took advantage of the bankruptcy laws,

861
00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:56.890
which is totally fucking legal.

862
00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:00.460
He's always talking about every professional mechanic is a swindling asshole.

863
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:04.030
I'll give you that.
And he tells you to leave your car with him,
all right?

864
00:51:04.031 --> 00:51:04.571
But you,
what you,

865
00:51:04.571 --> 00:51:09.490
what you're leaving out of all of this is that you're Killary Clinton acts like

866
00:51:09.491 --> 00:51:13.960
she gives a shit about you as do all democrats.
They act like they give a fuck.

867
00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:18.160
Most of them don't.
Most of them are no different than the Republicans.

868
00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:20.380
And it's not even because they're bad fucking people.

869
00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:25.240
It's because they're all grossly under fucking paid,
all right?
And most of them,

870
00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:29.110
their careers die way before they ever even make it into the Senate and the

871
00:51:29.111 --> 00:51:31.480
Senate.
You only make a couple of a hundred grand a year.

872
00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:34.540
Now what the fuck are you going to do?
So what they do is,

873
00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:37.270
is they take all these people's money,
okay?

874
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:41.740
They get themselves elected and then after they're fucking out of office and

875
00:51:41.741 --> 00:51:46.200
while they're in office,
they hookup whatever fucking in the private sector,
um,

876
00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:52.000
investments they have like all the,
like,
I forget what the percentage is.

877
00:51:52.001 --> 00:51:53.740
Like senators,
they make a couple hundred grand a year.

878
00:51:53.741 --> 00:51:58.550
They think they're all multi fucking millionaires.
They're all corrupt.
He says,

879
00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.920
I just can't buy into this fantasy that,

880
00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:05.860
that these Democrats give a fuck.
At least not these two I give.
I,

881
00:52:05.861 --> 00:52:10.861
I believe that Obama cares more about the average individual than Donald Trump

882
00:52:11.941 --> 00:52:14.670
without a doubt.
And Hillary Clinton,
she doesn't give a shit.

883
00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:19.450
She doesn't give a fuck what?
All right,
whatever.

884
00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:21.640
Let's read the rest of this and it tells them about Bubba.

885
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:24.820
So I get why you wouldn't like Clinton.
And I agree,

886
00:52:24.821 --> 00:52:27.400
we liberals can be self righteous and annoying.
Okay.

887
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:31.480
And I think you're just begging us with the Clinton Trump equivalency stuff.

888
00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:34.630
But I love you.
Well know that's you because you're so into Clinton.

889
00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:38.180
I fucking hate Hillary Clinton.
You know,

890
00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.750
if everything Clinton Trump did,
if you just took out the racism,

891
00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:45.740
I wouldn't think he was as bad as Clinton,
but the fact that he's racist,

892
00:52:45.741 --> 00:52:49.910
you know,
and just attracts those fucking people is,
that's the big rub.

893
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:51.290
That's the only thing.

894
00:52:51.291 --> 00:52:56.291
But I am not snowed on any level by slick willy or this fucking idiot.

895
00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:03.470
I really do not like them,
so I'm not just doing this.
Uh,
anyways,
she said,

896
00:53:03.471 --> 00:53:07.160
I love you bill,
and I love America and I don't have a helicopter is to escape.

897
00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:10.610
If Trump is elected,
well,
you need one to have.

898
00:53:10.611 --> 00:53:14.030
Hilary is like Hillary's just going to do you like the direction the country's

899
00:53:14.031 --> 00:53:16.520
going in because she is going to be more of the same.

900
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:19.130
It's going to be more of the fucking same.

901
00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:21.713
<v 5>MMM.</v>

902
00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:24.260
<v 3>Whatever.
What the fuck do I know?
Whatever.
Both.</v>

903
00:53:24.261 --> 00:53:28.020
Whoever the fuck you want to vote for,
but please don't try to fucking anyways,

904
00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:30.870
love you lodge.
Please vote for Hillary.
You knuckle dragging.

905
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:33.270
Troglodyte I don't even know what that means.

906
00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:35.883
<v 2>Yeah.
I don't know.</v>

907
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.530
<v 3>I think like the level of panic that people have if Trump is elected,
I get that,</v>

908
00:53:41.531 --> 00:53:45.760
but I just wished there was the same amount of panic that then it's going to be,

909
00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:46.820
it's going to be Hillary.

910
00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:48.230
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

911
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:49.063
<v 3>You know what I mean?</v>

912
00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:49.920
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

913
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.170
<v 3>I mean,
neither one of them have talked about global warming.</v>

914
00:53:52.171 --> 00:53:54.210
Neither one of them talked about the population problem.

915
00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:57.390
They haven't even addressed the heroin epidemic in this country created

916
00:53:57.391 --> 00:54:00.660
allegedly by the pharmaceutical companies.
None of them talked about that shit.

917
00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:01.680
They don't give a fuck.

918
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:03.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>

919
00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:05.760
<v 3>They ain't gonna do shit.
They're just going to keep making sure whoever,</v>

920
00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:08.710
whichever one of them makes it into the presidency.

921
00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:12.940
All you think is going to change is that whoever wins is then going to become

922
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000
even more wealthy because Trump's is going to greenlight any fucking golf

923
00:54:18.041 --> 00:54:20.100
courses.
Some bullshit he wants to do.
Right.

924
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:22.543
<v 2>I Dunno,</v>

925
00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:25.810
<v 3>I'm so in over my head with his politics shit.
But I also,
you know,</v>

926
00:54:25.811 --> 00:54:28.630
one of the things about being a standup comedian and traveling,

927
00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:31.690
you get to know people and you know when people are fucking assholes.
Okay.

928
00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:35.770
You know,
and these two,
you know,
I don't,
I don't know.
I just uh,

929
00:54:35.771 --> 00:54:38.200
this is a whole other level.
This is a whole other fucking level.

930
00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:40.860
All right?

931
00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:43.820
I really feel like it fucking annoyed the shit out all you guys just keep going.

932
00:54:43.821 --> 00:54:47.420
Okay.
We get it built.
We get it.
All right,
here we go.
Dollar Shave Club.
Oh,

933
00:54:47.421 --> 00:54:48.620
let's do a little advertising here.

934
00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:53.570
I'll blow through these and I got a few more questions.

935
00:54:53.571 --> 00:54:55.040
I swear to God they won't be political.

936
00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.160
I really feel like I'm starting to be like Lenny Bruce,
like reading the fuck I,

937
00:54:58.161 --> 00:55:00.500
but I only have a legal pad or any facts in front of me.

938
00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:05.030
People vote who you want to fucking vote for.
All right.
Just do that.
Okay.

939
00:55:05.031 --> 00:55:06.710
And then I'll shut the fuck up.
I won't,

940
00:55:06.711 --> 00:55:10.520
I'll probably be making jokes about it and Unclick Ana Clinton on a Conan.

941
00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:13.340
All right.

If you found 700 bucks in the sidewalk,</v>

951
00:55:42.561 --> 00:55:45.140

If you had crocs on,

964
00:56:34.151 --> 00:56:35.740
hanging their legal zoom.

965
00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:40.030
Everybody is 2016 wides down.
Ask Yourself,

966
00:56:40.031 --> 00:56:44.680
did you accomplish everything you set out to do this year?
If the answer is no,

967
00:56:44.681 --> 00:56:45.940
legal zoom wants to help.

968
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:50.050
Say you'd like to finally get the dream business off the ground.

969
00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:52.690
Say you'd find like to get that dream business off the ground.

970
00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:55.270
Should you incorporate or form an LLC?

971
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:58.480
Maybe you have a great idea for a new product or an invention,

972
00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:00.220
but no idea how to protect it.

973
00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:04.090
Wouldn't it be great to have an attorney you can trust to guide you along

974
00:57:04.091 --> 00:57:07.720
without breaking the bank?
Of course,
it was expensive.

975
00:57:07.721 --> 00:57:11.110
Legal fees and questions shouldn't stand between you and making your dreams a

976
00:57:11.111 --> 00:57:11.561
reality.

977
00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:14.920
That's why legal zoom was created to provide a way for you to confidently

978
00:57:14.921 --> 00:57:19.390
navigate the legal system with upfront pricing and complete transparency.

979
00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:22.750
Completely transparent like fucking Hillary Clinton.

980
00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:25.570

Yoga,
lunatic maniac,

1015
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:27.530
Darryl,
Billy,
red tits.
Did you happen to catch the latest episodes of Hbo?

1016
00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:31.070
Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel?
Uh,
no I didn't.

1017
00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:35.330
I normally don't watch on a regular basis,
but felt compelled to check it out.

1018
00:59:35.331 --> 00:59:38.420
After hearing about this yoga guy on the Howard stern show,

1019
00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:43.910
apparently this nut job is the founder slash creator of Bikram Yoga named after

1020
00:59:43.911 --> 00:59:48.530
himself,
which has done all over the world and seems like it's got a crazy cult

1021
00:59:48.531 --> 00:59:50.120
following.
Basically,

1022
00:59:50.121 --> 00:59:54.170
people travel all over the world and spent over $10,000 to take his classes

1023
00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:57.710
because they believe he is some sort of spiritual leader.
Now,

1024
00:59:57.711 --> 01:00:01.220
allegations are coming out against him that he's sexually abused a bunch of his

1025
01:00:01.221 --> 01:00:04.370
students and made all sorts of derogatory remarks.

1026
01:00:04.371 --> 01:00:08.930
People cannot handle positions of power.
You know,

1027
01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.400
you can't have this guy.

1028
01:00:10.401 --> 01:00:13.640
Everybody listening to what he's saying and a bunch of people bending over in

1029
01:00:13.641 --> 01:00:16.100
front of them.
He's gonna take his dick out.
I mean,

1030
01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:20.690
how did you not see that comment?
Anyways,
he told Andrea Kramer,

1031
01:00:20.691 --> 01:00:24.740
who conducted the interview,
why would I have to harass women?

1032
01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:29.900
Uh,
people spend $1 million for a drop of my sperm.

1033
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:35.320
He said that,
Holy Shit,

1034
01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.520
that's some of the greatest shit talk ever.
If that's fucking true.

1035
01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.970
What did she say?
He said,

1036
01:00:45.971 --> 01:00:50.890
why would I have to harass women people spend $1 million for a drop of my sperm?

1037
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:54.400
Oh my God.
Did he fucking drop his lapel mic and walk off the set?

1038
01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:57.880
And when asked about whether he harassed a particular woman,
he said,

1039
01:00:57.881 --> 01:01:01.510
of course not.
I would never even piss on her face.

1040
01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:05.590
She's a psychopath.
This is a yoga instructor.

1041
01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:08.230
This guy sounds like an assistant coach.

1042
01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.930
He also said it sounds like a gym teacher.

1043
01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:14.470
He also said he's a million times smarter than any doctor and that every doctor

1044
01:01:14.471 --> 01:01:17.500
in the world comes to him.
Yeah.
This guy sounds like Donald Trump.

1045
01:01:17.501 --> 01:01:21.760
If he fucking ran a yoga class,
Donald Trump's got to put this guy in his ticket.

1046
01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:25.540
I grabbed the pussies.
He pisses in their face.

1047
01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:28.840
Trump room 2017.
Uh,

1048
01:01:28.841 --> 01:01:30.970
this guy seems like he's a little out of his tree.

1049
01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.760
Just wanting to hear what old freckles has to say about this.

1050
01:01:33.761 --> 01:01:37.300
I posted some links to the story slash video below.

1051
01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:39.390
<v 5>Uh</v>

1052
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:42.330
<v 3>Oh.
It's on the Huffington post I had,
I don't go to that website.</v>

1053
01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:43.980
Those guys are out of their fucking weird man.

1054
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:47.010
They always act like they're this really like big like,

1055
01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.090
like credible news source and then if you just look at the shit they have,

1056
01:01:51.091 --> 01:01:54.000
you know,
top 10 fucking celebrity nose jobs in the quarter.

1057
01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.350
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
I'll look for those links.

1058
01:01:58.351 --> 01:02:03.310
I'm not going to that website though.
Jesus Christ.

1059
01:02:03.311 --> 01:02:07.060
What a fucking lunatic.
I got to see that man.

1060
01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:11.100
Great interview,
Huh?
It far is like,
yeah,

1061
01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:15.230
he's going to give you the quotes and as much as people at Ed Bryant gumbles

1062
01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:17.560
real sports were appalled.
They were,

1063
01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:21.000
they were secretly high fiving each other for the fucking ratings that that was

1064
01:02:21.001 --> 01:02:25.430
going to get.
He said,
well,
what did I get to read?
Go back.

1065
01:02:25.431 --> 01:02:27.890
What the fuck these,
why do I have to harass women?

1066
01:02:27.891 --> 01:02:31.910
People spend $1 million for a drop of my sperm.
Yeah.

1067
01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:34.950
That's what happens when people fly around the fucking world that come to your

1068
01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:39.920
yoga class.
People,
people go crazy.
They can't fucking handle it.

1069
01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:44.800
A girlfriend of seven years dumped me,
hey,

1070
01:02:44.801 --> 01:02:46.780
bill by girlfriend has seven years,

1071
01:02:46.781 --> 01:02:50.560
dumped me two months after she moved to Connecticut for Graduate School.

1072
01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:52.960
She didn't use those exact words,
but she told me,

1073
01:02:52.961 --> 01:02:56.860
she told me she needed time to think because something is missing in our

1074
01:02:56.861 --> 01:02:59.910
relationship and she needs time to figure out what it is.
Well Dude,

1075
01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.640
you been with them for fucking seven years,
man.
I mean,
who am I to talk?

1076
01:03:03.641 --> 01:03:06.700
I was with nearby for nine years before we got married,
but um,

1077
01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:12.040
we were on the same page as we were both terrified to fucking make that leap.
Um,

1078
01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:14.190
anyways,
I'm not a mind reader,
but if some,

1079
01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:18.520
someone has been with you for seven years and they need to time to think about

1080
01:03:18.521 --> 01:03:21.400
whether they still want to be with you,
that's not a good side.
Yes,

1081
01:03:21.401 --> 01:03:23.830
your instincts are correct.
I would say,
uh,

1082
01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:25.780
since I had this conversation with there,

1083
01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.830
I have been absolutely devastated and depressed.
I'm ashamed to admit this,

1084
01:03:30.070 --> 01:03:34.390
but the other night I found myself on my bedroom floor crying in the fetal

1085
01:03:34.391 --> 01:03:39.040
position.
Well,
that's totally normal.
And it's also,
it's a healthy thing to do.

1086
01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:43.150
Cry It,
rd it,
don't drink it out of you are fucking jump off a balcony.

1087
01:03:43.151 --> 01:03:46.570
Those are dumb shit that men do.
All right.

1088
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:50.020
Women get down on the floor crying in the fetal position.

1089
01:03:50.021 --> 01:03:51.610
I think that's why they live longer.

1090
01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:56.050
If it was socially acceptable for us to do it.
So please continue doing that.

1091
01:03:56.230 --> 01:04:01.150
It's a valid human emotion that both men and women have that men fight.

1092
01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:06.880
Yeah.
Fucking cry it out of you.
Um,
good for you.
Very mature thing to do.

1093
01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:09.220
Um,
you should not feel ashamed at all.
And he said,

1094
01:04:09.221 --> 01:04:11.530
I understand that time heals all wounds,

1095
01:04:11.531 --> 01:04:15.460
but I have no idea how to chat to start the process of getting over this.

1096
01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:19.150
Do what you do,
what,
cry it out of you and then,
um,

1097
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:23.350
call your best friend and just say,
listen,
do it.
I'm embarrassed to say this,

1098
01:04:23.351 --> 01:04:26.320
but I'm fucking devastated.
I'm over here crying like a little girl.

1099
01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:30.370
I got to get me out of the house,
man.
Take me for a fucking walk,

1100
01:04:30.371 --> 01:04:33.850
like a dog just to,
can we get some fresh air anyways?

1101
01:04:33.851 --> 01:04:35.360
He said to keep my mind off for,

1102
01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:39.730
I try to stay as busy by going to the gym and focusing on hobbies,

1103
01:04:39.731 --> 01:04:41.980
but I can't seem to shake this miserable feeling.

1104
01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:45.460
How would you handle this situation if you were in my shoes?
Um,

1105
01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:50.020
I would accept the fact that,
that it's going to hurt.
Okay.

1106
01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:53.800
And that you're not going to be able to just go to the gym and take a pottery

1107
01:04:53.801 --> 01:04:58.030
class and forget a woman that you love for seven years.
Um,

1108
01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:03.560
what do you have to do is understand that it's going to hurt for a while and you

1109
01:05:03.761 --> 01:05:06.940
have to,
rather than run from the pain,
sit in it,

1110
01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:10.960
cry your way through it,
and then go to the fucking gym

1111
01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:16.490
and you know,
the crying things going to last for a little while.

1112
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:19.630
And once she gets through that,
then just try,
you know,

1113
01:05:19.631 --> 01:05:21.310
even during the crying time I tried to do,

1114
01:05:21.311 --> 01:05:25.420
I'm going to do something positive today.
I'm going to do the dishes.
You know,

1115
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:28.810
just do little things that are on a list,
you know?

1116
01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:33.610
And then while you're doing that,
just started making a list of,

1117
01:05:33.611 --> 01:05:37.990
uh,
how you want to come out of this.
Do you want to come out of this ship?

1118
01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:41.830
The Shit he had?
Literally this shit 20 pounds heavier?

1119
01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:45.520
Or do you want to come out like 10 pounds lighter because you've been going to

1120
01:05:45.521 --> 01:05:47.710
the gym?
You know,

1121
01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:52.540
do you want to come out of this hating women or hopeful that,
that you,
you know,

1122
01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:55.690
you're with the wrong person and you haven't,

1123
01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:59.020
you have a whole new opportunity to meet somebody great.
You know,

1124
01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:03.010
you didn't have any kids.
You weren't married.
It's a fucking nice clean breakup.

1125
01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:06.450
<v 2>Um,
you know,</v>

1126
01:06:07.370 --> 01:06:11.330
<v 3>you can totally rebuild your fucking life where you can have the greatest</v>

1127
01:06:11.331 --> 01:06:14.000
fucking life ever.
And then one day you're going to run into her.

1128
01:06:14.001 --> 01:06:15.860
She's going to see how fucking happy you are.

1129
01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:19.770
And it's the fucking moment that you're going to want to be like,
yeah,
Hey Steve,

1130
01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:23.720
I'm happy.
Look at me and my car and my family.
And you know what?

1131
01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:28.220
If you're truly happy,
you're not going to have that.
Hey Fuck,

1132
01:06:28.221 --> 01:06:31.220
you think her,
you're going to be like,
hey,
how are you?
I hope you're happy.

1133
01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:33.260
You know,
and then you hate to be,

1134
01:06:33.261 --> 01:06:36.560
the greatest thing that ever happened is you fucking left me because now you,

1135
01:06:36.561 --> 01:06:39.140
dude,
you're older,
you're wiser,
you're going through this fucking thing.

1136
01:06:39.141 --> 01:06:41.600
Now you're going to really figure out what you like I'm telling you,

1137
01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.910
this will end up being the greatest thing that happened to you.

1138
01:06:44.090 --> 01:06:45.320
But the thing is you gotta.

1139
01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:48.620
You can't be a guy here and try to fucking block out the pain.

1140
01:06:48.621 --> 01:06:52.290
You got to fucking just sit in it.
You know,

1141
01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:57.560
just fucking go through Ali Shit that you bought together that makes you cry and

1142
01:06:58.201 --> 01:07:02.940
all that shit cry.
Put It on craigslist,
get it the fuck out of there.

1143
01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.193
You know,

1144
01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:08.130
get through all of that and then maybe just get rid of the shit that she got.

1145
01:07:08.131 --> 01:07:12.150
You move to a new fucking place.
Just fucking start over.

1146
01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:14.810
And then when you meet broads in a fucking bar,

1147
01:07:14.811 --> 01:07:16.340
you just tell them what's going on with deal.

1148
01:07:16.341 --> 01:07:19.250
Just got out of the seven year thing.
It was fucking devastating,

1149
01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.910
but I'm totally hopeful.
You know,
I want to meet somebody great,

1150
01:07:22.911 --> 01:07:25.910
and they're always like,
oh my God,
that's nice.
They're attracted to it.

1151
01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:28.280
Next thing you know,
you're drinking IPA,

1152
01:07:28.281 --> 01:07:30.650
she getting fucking blow jobs with women.

1153
01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:35.570
You're not in a relationship with looking at the clouds of party,
all right?

1154
01:07:35.890 --> 01:07:37.570
All of that shit is in your future,

1155
01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:42.430
but you got to go through the fucking paint first.
All right?
That's it.

1156
01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:45.220
If you are a car,
you're a fucking barn find right now.

1157
01:07:45.221 --> 01:07:48.970
They are even fucking fucking sprayed you off.
I've got the rat shit out of you.

1158
01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:50.830
You just got to deal with that right now,

1159
01:07:51.070 --> 01:07:54.340
but the best thing you could do is not buried this shit.

1160
01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:58.690
The reason why women do so well is because they're allowed to cry.

1161
01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.910
They can cry in front of their fucking friends,

1162
01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:04.450
they can talk the shit out and they can get past it.
We don't.

1163
01:08:04.451 --> 01:08:08.860
We fucking carry it and carry it and carry it in an effects other relationships.

1164
01:08:08.861 --> 01:08:11.740
If you truly want to fucking get past this thing,

1165
01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.210
you got to go through the pain of it.
That's what the fuck could I,

1166
01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:18.110
that's what I learnt all the fucking times.
I got dumped.
All right.

1167
01:08:18.230 --> 01:08:21.350
Good luck to you,
sir.
Go fuck yourselves to the rest of you.

1168
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:25.520
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
That is it.

1169
01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:31.250
Good luck with the voting.
Everybody may the best piece of shit when.
