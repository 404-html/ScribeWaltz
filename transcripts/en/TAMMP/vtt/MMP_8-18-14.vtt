00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.210
Hey,

It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday.

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.960
Ah,
Jesus.
August eight teeth.
Yeah,

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.260
that's the month.
And that's the day and it's the year 2014.

4
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.460
Um,
how are you?
Do you realize you wouldn't think about that.

5
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:25.440
It's 2014 if we actually make it to the 2019 how people are going to be looking

6
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:27.540
back at us like the way you know,

7
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:31.980
in the 1900 you look back at 1914 everybody was walking around really fast.

8
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.490
<v 1>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.440
<v 0>Do you think that'll happen with us?
No.
Bill,</v>

10
00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:40.210
they have HD TV and what the rate of global warming.
Ah,

11
00:00:40.211 --> 00:00:43.180
right.
Your fucking cut all going to be underwater.

12
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.430
Um,
you know what you know,
be funny.

13
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.970
A bet.

14
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.650
Waterworld do you think that movie will make a bunch of fucking money as the

15
00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:58.760
polar ice caps start to melt everybody?
It'd be like,
you know,

16
00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:00.500
I think we were wrong about this one.

17
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.780
We gave this movie a lot of fucking criticism.

18
00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:06.590
The guy was actually way ahead of his time.
Uh,
Bill,

19
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:09.480
why are you talking about Kevin Costner?

20
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.820
Cause I actually have a movie coming out with Tim believe in and not old fancy

21
00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:15.500
pants.
Freckled boy over here.

22
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.810
I did a movie last summer in a New Orleans.

23
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:24.230
Some of you listen to this podcast might remember.
Um,

24
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.810
and uh,
it was hot as shit,
but it was a,
it was a wonderful,
a wonderful,

25
00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:32.540
those are wonderful time.
And uh,
Mike binder wrote,
directed it.

26
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.700
Octavius Spencer,
Kevin Costner.
Uh,
they're all in it.

27
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.140
It's a,
um,
how would I describe the movie?

28
00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:46.880
It's a courtroom drama.
Old School courtroom drama.
And what do you play bill?

29
00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:51.720
I play Kevin Costs and his lawyer Enough Boston accent in there.
Um,

30
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:56.540
I'm actually going to weigh a film festival coming up Toronto with the debut of

31
00:01:56.541 --> 00:01:57.360
that movie

32
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.960
<v 2>and uh,
or whatever at a film festival,
I guess.</v>

33
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.640
And then it comes out in October.

34
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.260
<v 0>So there you go.
Look at that.
I barely giving you any laughs.</v>

35
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.350
I've come right out right out of the gate.
Just whoring myself out.

36
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.220
I'm actually hoping to get my car,

37
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.170
<v 2>find her on the podcast a as we get closer to the date.
That's a,</v>

38
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.800
he's actually one of the legendary standups from the comedy store back in the

39
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.730
day.
And,
uh,
he told me a bunch of great stories and all that stuff.
And um,

40
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.370
so he'll obviously be a great guest.

41
00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:32.620
Speaking of which last night I went down to the,
uh,

42
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.200
<v 1>yeah,</v>

43
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.120
<v 2>well the first thing I did was I went out and I fucking jam with the band.
Man.</v>

44
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.910
I'm doing another one of those is a goddamn comedy jams tonight.
Uh,

45
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.630
and dressing up like the drama that I'm imitating again,

46
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.770
which of course is it's so,
it is ridiculous.

47
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:57.771
So I take off any sort of pressure for any sort of audience member where,

48
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.180
you know,
is there anything than having to go see your friend's band?

49
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.280
Even if the fuck,
unless they're really fucking good,
then you like that.
Oh God,

50
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:09.610
maybe they're gonna make it.
I should start picking up some why is,

51
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.890
maybe I could be a roadie
dude.
You,
you,

52
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.970
you forgot where you came from,
man.

53
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:19.990
You remember I used to go see you down at friendlies and the ground round.

54
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.210
Either way,
you're fucked,
right?
So I just don't want anybody going down to the,

55
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:26.350
anybody who's going onto this thing.

56
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:31.060
I don't want anybody even remotely to think that I'm taking this anywhere other

57
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:34.640
than this is just a fun as hell thing to do.
Um,

58
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.150
I want to do some jokes about Tommy Lee.
You know,
like I did with John Bonham.

59
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.460
It's fun.
It's just a good fucking time.
So I'll tell you,

60
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:49.570
trying to find a time you leave,
uh,
uh,
uh,
costume is,

61
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:50.620
it's fucking difficult.

62
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:54.070
The guys had like 90 different looks and like most of them,

63
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:56.890
he's not wearing a shirt and I'm just too fucking pasty essay.

64
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.780
I'm not fucking doing that.
So,
uh,
I did,

65
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.930
I had to pick an era where he was actually wearing a shirt,
which is a,

66
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.780
it's not easy.
It's not easy to find.
But anyway,
so,
uh,
I did that and then I went,

67
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:10.990
last night I went down to the comedy store and,
um,

68
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.870
they had actually had a,
a,

69
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:18.670
a memorial service for Robin Williams and,
uh,
it was awesome,

70
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:20.590
man.
It was,
you know,

71
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.580
just like so many people from back in the day came out that were down there.

72
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:30.220
I actually one wondering when all the last time,

73
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:34.170
all of that group of people were down there,
um,

74
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.830
and they were all telling stories.
I was like,
I got there late unfortunately.
But,

75
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:43.690
um,
norm McDonald schmear enough,
had some great stories.

76
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.140
Uh,
Jackson Purdue,

77
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.550
then there's a couple of people for that.
We're in part of his improv group.

78
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.360
We're all telling all these great stories and,
uh,
it was a really great thing,

79
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:56.410
but I gotta tell you,
man,
that was,

80
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.470
it's not like I knew the guy or anything,
but that was brutal.

81
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.750
Fucking brutal.

82
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

83
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.110
<v 2>When I heard the news about that one,
that one really,
uh,</v>

84
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.710
<v 1>okay.</v>

85
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.560
<v 2>You know,
there's one of those things where you really,
you think,
you know,
yeah,</v>

86
00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:16.890
I love that guy.
I love his movies.
I think that guys hilarious.
You know,

87
00:05:16.891 --> 00:05:20.020
you don't realize it.
And then something like that happening,
just like,
wow,
man,
I,

88
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:24.600
I had no idea how much that guy,
uh,
affecting me.
I did get a chance,

89
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.950
um,
one time to do a show with them.

90
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.440
Uh,
he always,
um,
you know,
he would just come down to clubs.

91
00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:37.140
I'd always heard about,
I know he did it.
We lived up in San Francisco,

92
00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:41.970
but people saying like,
yeah,
this is open.
Mikey went to every single week.
Um,

93
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.320
Bart,
Nick told this great story about,
uh,
how he was at a concert.

94
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.940
He was Kinda like the,

95
00:05:47.941 --> 00:05:52.350
like the unofficial mayor of San Francisco when they needed like a laugh or

96
00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:52.951
something,
like,

97
00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:57.951
I Guess Barnett was at some big concert and if it was an outdoor and it rained

98
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.260
and um,
you know,
so like,
apologize everybody,
the bands can't go on.

99
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.430
Everybody's standing there fucking looks like a bunch of fucking which shelter

100
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:08.510
dogs and stuff.

101
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.570
And Robin Williams was in the crowd and he just went up on stage in like a

102
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:19.931
fucking rain Poncho and did 45 minutes in front of an Oh,

103
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.100
soaking wet,
angry crowd that wasn't getting this show.
And he crushed,

104
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.890
just did like a headlining set and a,

105
00:06:28.891 --> 00:06:31.490
and then in the end like the sun was coming out and he's like,
all right,

106
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:34.460
the bands are coming out with blah,
blah,
and just went right back into the crowd.

107
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:38.030
You see was like a zillion stories like that that I heard.
And um,

108
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.500
so anyways,
I was doing,
uh,
Jeff Garland had this show.

109
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.580
He does a every now and again down at the UCB and uh,

110
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.870
it's just really cool format.
In the end he has like this Improv game called,
uh,

111
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.990
the Combo platter and it's basically they pick a subject and each person has to

112
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:03.890
go up and riff on it for five minutes and then you sit down and then the next

113
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:06.170
round is you go back up again.

114
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.790
But anybody can interrupt anybody at any time and it just starts going and you

115
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:14.270
just start adding to whatever they're doing.
And one,
you know,

116
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:17.600
one night I went down there and I was doing the show with them and Robin showed

117
00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:21.260
up and Garland knew him and everything and they went in with the show and I

118
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:24.140
actually got to do improv standing right next to him doing improv.

119
00:07:24.141 --> 00:07:27.320
I literally felt like I was on comic relief,
you know?

120
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.060
I mean we sitting in the chairs,
right?

121
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.450
It's just like such a fucking weird moment.

122
00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:34.670
But we always sitting in the chair next to him,
you know,

123
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:37.460
he had that thick arm hair.
It's like we were,

124
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.770
the space between us was a little tight but it wasn't anywhere where we still

125
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:46.610
should have been touching,
but his arm hair was so fucking thick.
It actually was.

126
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.000
It actually was touching my arm.
I had to move my arm.

127
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.160
I remember thinking all those jokes that he used to do about how he felt like he

128
00:07:55.161 --> 00:07:58.340
was wearing a sweater and all that type of thing.
But it was one of the,

129
00:07:58.341 --> 00:08:00.530
obviously one of the great things I ever got to do.

130
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:05.590
And fortunately because he was such an open guy and such a nice guy,

131
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.810
sweet guy,
he didn't,
didn't,
you know,
coming with that,
you know,

132
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:14.680
I've been doing this forever,
get out of the way kid.

133
00:08:14.681 --> 00:08:15.890
He didn't have that vibe at all.

134
00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:20.870
He was like a really vulnerable kind of vibe that because he came with that
vibe,

135
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:25.280
I was actually able to like enjoy it as it was happening rather than,

136
00:08:25.281 --> 00:08:30.050
um,
look back on it and be like,
oh yeah,
I got to do that.

137
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:34.490
But I,
I was so in my head I had to like knock him down.
You know,

138
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.960
that's like something I have to do sometimes when I get a gig that's so big,

139
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.940
I literally have to develop a certain level of hatred for this person that I

140
00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:46.190
don't hate.
I have to be like,
you know what?
Fuck this guy.

141
00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:48.600
Fuck this guy for making me feel so fucking uncomfortable with this

142
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.840
success or whatever.
But the way Robin was,
he,

143
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.710
you didn't have to do that when you're him.
So,
uh,
you know,

144
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.460
thanks to Jeff Garlin for fucking,
you know,

145
00:09:01.461 --> 00:09:05.360
having that show so I could have that memory,
but it's definitely a huge,
huge,

146
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.600
huge fucking a and indescribable a loss.

147
00:09:10.641 --> 00:09:14.120
And um,
ah,
it just sucks.
I hate that it ends that way,

148
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.110
you know?
So

149
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.570
<v 0>anyways,
isn't that happy?</v>

150
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.150
Isn't that happy to fucking have to talk about that yet?

151
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:26.151
Another fucking person in his business he knows was fucking weird is I got like

152
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:30.750
three texts within 24 hours of Robin's death,

153
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.093
you know,

154
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.450
asking me if I was okay and then telling me not to kill myself.

155
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.140
And that just struck me as funny.
Like,

156
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.360
it's like depression and suicide are not like us.
Just

157
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:48.750
like a stand,
like if a fucking plumber kills himself,
it's,

158
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.840
do people reach out to other plumbers?
Hey Man,

159
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:55.410
I know you haven't got a lot of sinks lately.
It's been mostly toilets and uh,

160
00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:58.920
you know,
just reach out that,
you know,
it's,
it's going to turn around,
you know,

161
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.830
you know.
Um,
oh look,

162
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.340
I'm not a fucking doctor,
but I know that,
that shit.
Um,

163
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.550
it definitely,
uh,

164
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.690
<v 2>it definitely affects,
you know,
a lot of people.
I mean,
I've,</v>

165
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.500
I've dealt with,
you know,
unfortunately and it's been okay

166
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.560
<v 0>people outside of a standup,</v>

167
00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.140
<v 2>well,
let's see,
I got to like count.
I think it's three.</v>

168
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.870
Yeah.
Three people that I know,
you know,
committed suicide.

169
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.580
It's fucking brutal,
man.
It's,
it's really fucking brutal.
And,
uh,

170
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.550
so I got this,
you know,
I dunno,

171
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:50.210
I see somebody starting to go down that the depress road.
It's just fucking,

172
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.610
it's so hard to get them off.
Um,

173
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.700
I dunno.
All I know is it sucks.
So

174
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:06.520
<v 0>back to the podcast.
Anyways,
what am I going to talk about this week?
Um,</v>

175
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.870
oh,
let's,
let's just continue with like,
you know,

176
00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.290
talking about depression and suicide.
Can I,

177
00:11:14.291 --> 00:11:18.790
can I fucking just openly and honestly talk about the ice bucket challenge?

178
00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:24.420
Can I do that without fucking this McCarthyism fucking era of once the ball gets

179
00:11:26.111 --> 00:11:30.610
rolling,
if you fucking go anywhere else,
you're not supporting the troops.

180
00:11:30.611 --> 00:11:34.420
You fucking,
you're a,
you're a,
you're a commie.
You,

181
00:11:34.421 --> 00:11:36.640
you hate women.
Uh,
you know,

182
00:11:36.641 --> 00:11:41.020
it just that ice bucket challenge.
I,
at this point,

183
00:11:41.021 --> 00:11:43.600
I've been challenged by three different fucking people.

184
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:44.950
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

185
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:45.783
<v 0>Okay.</v>

186
00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:50.200
The last one was last night and it's,

187
00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.110
this is,
this is what,
uh,

188
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.620
<v 2>the person texted me,
said,
hey,
you know,
go check out my ice bucket challenge.</v>

189
00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:03.050
I love how it's about the person.
It's so not even about the disease.
Hey,

190
00:12:03.051 --> 00:12:06.960
check out my wacky response to ice cold water over my fucking head.

191
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:08.303
And he goes,

192
00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.373
<v 4>uh,</v>

193
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:14.900
<v 2>what the hell is it?
He said,
it's on Facebook.
Um,</v>

194
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.380
<v 4>yeah,</v>

195
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.760
<v 2>hope you're good.
I nominated you for the ice bucket,
als challenge.</v>

196
00:12:20.761 --> 00:12:23.490
So I wrote back,
I said,
listen dude,
I live in a desert.

197
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.590
<v 4>Okay,</v>

198
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.600
<v 2>all right.
It's a $500 dollar fine.
If your wastewater,</v>

199
00:12:27.601 --> 00:12:31.590
I'm going to do the hundred dollar donation instead.
So he goes,

200
00:12:31.591 --> 00:12:36.150
you prick well played,
you can do it on the road and send me the video.

201
00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.770
And I wrote back,
I'm like,
dude,
it's about raising money for that als.

202
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:44.780
Not what not.
You watching me dump a bucket of ice over my fucking head.

203
00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:52.510
I don't under like do you understand how precious water is to everybody and

204
00:12:53.361 --> 00:12:56.240
around the world,
how much does this shortage of it?
We're over here going,

205
00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:02.530
dumping it over our heads and it's to the point now it's the disease is,

206
00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.960
is second banana to watching somebody's reaction.

207
00:13:07.971 --> 00:13:08.301
I know.

208
00:13:08.301 --> 00:13:12.020
What's a fun fucking thing and it's raised over a hundred million dollars in all

209
00:13:12.021 --> 00:13:16.440
of that type of shit.
But uh,
there's this pressure.

210
00:13:16.441 --> 00:13:19.470
Like if you don't fucking do it and you just give 100 bucks,

211
00:13:19.471 --> 00:13:20.700
somehow you're an asshole.

212
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.630
What I want to know is how many people just dump the bucket of ice over their

213
00:13:24.631 --> 00:13:26.880
head and it's another fucking,
you know,

214
00:13:26.881 --> 00:13:29.850
me moment for them and then they don't even give any goddamn money.

215
00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.620
MMM.
You know,

216
00:13:33.621 --> 00:13:36.680
this is just going to open a can of worm for all these other diseases is

217
00:13:36.681 --> 00:13:41.150
actually people in foundations right now sitting in a board room.
Okay.

218
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:46.410
With fucking bagels and cream cheese sitting in front of him that everybody

219
00:13:46.411 --> 00:13:49.260
wants to go and grab.
But no one wants to grab it first.

220
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.980
So they seem like the person who just came there to eat and they're sitting

221
00:13:52.981 --> 00:13:57.750
there brainstorming trying to figure out how can we come up with our own ice

222
00:13:57.751 --> 00:14:01.000
bucket challenge.
So people give a shit about Rick.
Right.

223
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.790
You know,
it's like when there's a hit fucking movie,
Oh my God,

224
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:14.530
it's a hit movie with vampires.
Goddammit.
Put Vampires and everything.

225
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:15.880
That's what's going to happen.

226
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.260
What other natural resource can we use?

227
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:22.613
<v 4>Uh,</v>

228
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.080
<v 2>Fred,
the fresh air challenge,</v>

229
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.580
the awkward for Ice Bucket Challenge.

230
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:34.290
Everybody's got to go to fucking Nantucket dump water over their head.
I Dunno.

231
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.110
<v 4>Okay.</v>

232
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.240
<v 2>I Dunno.
It's a good thing cause it's raising money,</v>

233
00:14:38.241 --> 00:14:41.470
but I gotta be honest with you.
Yeah.
You know,

234
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.470
there's not a lot of water left people.

235
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:49.840
If you really look at the only fresh water we got common is the polar ice caps

236
00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:50.674
melting.

237
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.470
Do you know a lot of those blue blood counts are going around the world and

238
00:14:56.471 --> 00:14:59.800
they're buying up property that sits on an aquifer because they know that water

239
00:14:59.801 --> 00:15:04.030
in the future is going to be equivalent to currency.
Do you want to stand

240
00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.900
how much little information I had before I just made that unbelievably

241
00:15:10.901 --> 00:15:13.510
terrifying statement?
Do you understand that people,

242
00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.090
why are you listening to this thing?
Um,

243
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.390
you know what it's going to be a rough month is the ice bucket challenge and

244
00:15:21.391 --> 00:15:24.180
then also the pink month in the NFL.

245
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.700
All of these fucking things.
Oh man,
I really hope,

246
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:33.110
I just hope that the money actually gets to the people that need it.
Uh,

247
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:35.893
you know,

248
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.300
<v 3>okay.</v>

249
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.080
<v 2>Cause that the lady,
from what I've,</v>

250
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:45.070
I've actually read on the Internet,
so God knows if it's even remotely true.

251
00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.290
She makes like three quarters of $1 million a year,

252
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.130
and I know she's raised a bunch of money and all that type of shit,

253
00:15:51.131 --> 00:15:52.600
but at the end of the day,

254
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.020
if they weren't a bunch of women dying from breast cancer,

255
00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.660
she wouldn't have a job.
It's just fucking weird.
I guess it's,

256
00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:04.330
you can say the same thing about a doctor,
but doctors is trying to,
well,

257
00:16:04.331 --> 00:16:07.720
I guess she's tried to get them better.
I Dunno.

258
00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:09.850
How do you justify pulling that kind of money?

259
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.120
I guess just sitting there going like,
well,
I raised $100 million.

260
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.660
<v 0>That's not even 1% I took three quarters of 1%</v>

261
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:19.810
<v 3>okay.</v>

262
00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.990
<v 2>Then again,
three quarters,
$1 million.
You Find Ryan around a BMW,</v>

263
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.780
a bet that isn't painted pinkies as it,
you know,

264
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.120
you want to make sure he got the resale value.
Don't yet.

265
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.660
<v 0>What's the name of the lady that does the pink thing?
Is it Pam?
Is it Peggy?</v>

266
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.930
Does her name start with p?
Uh,
all right.
Anyways,

267
00:16:37.931 --> 00:16:41.860
this is the Monday morning podcast.
Every but everybody a really heavy one.

268
00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:46.180
We've talked about suicide,
a ILS and uh,

269
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.970
breast cancer.
Hey,

270
00:16:49.971 --> 00:16:53.060
how excited are you guys that the NFL football's coming back?

271
00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:55.450
The NFL football whole?
Do I sign,
you know?

272
00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:56.930
<v 3>Okay.</v>

273
00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:01.860
<v 0>Is she on that Internet?
Um,
bump,
bump,
bump bomb.</v>

274
00:17:01.861 --> 00:17:04.100
All right.
Legal zoom.com everybody.

275
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.760
Most Americans don't have a wealth,

276
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:13.090
but why you don't want the court dictating what happens to you or your property

277
00:17:13.401 --> 00:17:16.010
or your minor children.
It didn't say you there.
You're dead.

278
00:17:16.011 --> 00:17:18.170
So that doesn't make any sense.
Bill Rhea correctly.

279
00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:21.320
You don't want the court dictating what happens to your property and your minor

280
00:17:21.321 --> 00:17:25.610
children.
So why procrastinate?
You know what?
Most people say,
they go,
oh,

281
00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:29.420
it's too expensive or it's too time consuming.

All right,
let's get back to the podcast here.
Um,

350
00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:48.780
I skipped back to diseases and talking about dying or whatever.
Um,

351
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:55.290
um,
I'm calling 2072 for me.
I want to see the 70s again.
Uh,

352
00:21:55.291 --> 00:21:58.380
that's why I'm trying to,
uh,
Amal,
that's not what I'm trying to eat.
Right.

353
00:21:58.381 --> 00:22:01.860
And exercise.
I do it cause I'm vain.
You know,

354
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:04.890
I just want to look good for you people.

355
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.510
That's my new ending to the crying.
You like that one?

356
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.450
That's when I take it to another level.

357
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:19.920
That long one makes versus the fucking laugh his ass off.
Oh Jesus.
Who is this?

358
00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.360
Oh,
it's my brother.
Hey,

359
00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:28.290
I'm doing my podcast going to call you right back.
All right,
cool.

360
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:33.930
Um,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump up.

361
00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:40.110
You know what's funny is silly is that that fucking ring tone sounds like if you

362
00:22:40.111 --> 00:22:42.360
gave that to anybody in Asia,

363
00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:46.560
they would start with that thing and then they would have like the most amazing,

364
00:22:46.561 --> 00:22:51.150
they could build that theme into the sickest fucking like opening to a,

365
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.930
an Olympic ceremony.
You ever,
you've ever seen you like that?

366
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:57.840
That's called positive stereotypes.

367
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.010
That music sounded Asian to me.

368
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:07.190
So I connected it with Asian culture with a positive result.

369
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.780
Is that also offensive?
You know what I mean?

370
00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:17.390
If you just say stereotypical shit but as positive
do it.

371
00:23:17.391 --> 00:23:21.360
Let me tell you something about those grease ball.
Italians,
they can really cook.

372
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.950
They're the best cooks in the world.

373
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:27.480
Like do you have some sort of weird like MCHDI lt like hot and cold.

374
00:23:27.481 --> 00:23:31.380
You throw in something fucking offensive and then with a big time like positive

375
00:23:31.381 --> 00:23:36.150
thing,
oh those fuckers can't drive by and they are good at math.

376
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:40.870
Okay.
We're like 50.

377
00:23:40.871 --> 00:23:44.670
He needs to like half apologize and like almost get suspended.

378
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.670
<v 2>I'm sorry.
Let's get back to the,
uh,
to the podcast.
Um,</v>

379
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:55.490
what the hell am I?
Oh Dude.
You know what I bought?

380
00:23:55.491 --> 00:23:59.240
Did I tell you guys I late night,
I'm watching TV,
right?

381
00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.740
I had a lot of late nights this week cause I,
I had the,
uh,

382
00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.670
it was my final week off before I was going back on the road,

383
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:13.130
the odd ball thing.
And I've,
and I've really enjoyed my time.
Um,

384
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.520
time off.
I haven't taken time off in,
um,
I dunno.

385
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:22.130
Fucking 10 years,
like took a significant period of time off,
uh,

386
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.670
just sort of been doing this shit because it's been fun.

387
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.730
But at some point I kind of looked up and was like,
Hey,
I need to,

388
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.420
I need to chill out.
So the last,
you know,
July and August,
I kind of,

389
00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:33.950
you know,

390
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:38.150
rather than going out every other weekend and one or two back to back weekends,

391
00:24:38.151 --> 00:24:41.570
I kind of did like w well,
I did still did two weekends in July,

392
00:24:41.571 --> 00:24:46.250
but they were fun weekends and I haven't done shit in August yet.
And,
um,

393
00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.380
it's been great.

394
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.540
I've been an la building up my new hour and,
uh,

395
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.430
I was fucking around last night down at the comedy store,
which,
uh,

396
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:03.530
you know,
is my favorite club out here.
And it was another great thing cause you,

397
00:25:03.531 --> 00:25:06.560
when you go into the comedy store,
the original room,

398
00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:11.200
that's where all those guys,
um,

399
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.880
when they came to town,
that's where they went up.

400
00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:18.080
I don't even know that they had the main room initially.
Um,

401
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:23.030
they just had that,
uh,
the original room.
And that's where a Letterman,
Leno,

402
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:27.260
Robin Williams,
uh,
Sam Kinison dice,

403
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:30.740
all of those guys,
Sandra,
Sandra Bernhard,
all of them,

404
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:36.050
all of the comedy store,
Great.
Jim Carrey,
all those guys started there.

405
00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:37.341
And uh,

406
00:25:37.341 --> 00:25:42.260
so they have these neon signs that they made for like some of their best ones.

407
00:25:42.261 --> 00:25:45.610
And it was basically it's prior,
uh,

408
00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:49.430
Kinison Robin Williams.
Um,

409
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:53.210
I forget you just go around the room.
It's like,
you know,

410
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.850
it's like five Mount Rushmore's with the people.

411
00:25:55.851 --> 00:25:59.360
So last night you went in there and they usually have them all lit up and they

412
00:25:59.361 --> 00:26:02.180
only had Robin's lit up.
It was really fucking cool.

413
00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.540
And I wanted to try out a bunch of new stuff,
so I'm like,
well shit,

414
00:26:05.541 --> 00:26:08.510
there's the sign right there,
Robin Williams,
the king of fucking Improv.

415
00:26:08.511 --> 00:26:13.100
So I've just been going down there and,
um,

416
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.630
you know,
as every hour starts out with it starts out with that idea,

417
00:26:17.631 --> 00:26:20.000
that little chunk and a,

418
00:26:20.001 --> 00:26:23.800
I've been fucking around with the order and I just went up there and I was did

419
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:26.240
like 15 minutes,
nothing from my special,

420
00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.920
there was a couple of leftover ideas that didn't get developed,

421
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:35.030
um,
or didn't make this special for whatever reason.
And I'm like,

422
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.090
I made a choice for him not to be in the special.
They just didn't come out,

423
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:42.560
you know,
and just did my act and those jokes didn't get told.
So,

424
00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.013
um,

425
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:48.400
just been having a great fucking time being home.

426
00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.080
Um,
and I don't know,

427
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:56.530
now I'm getting ready to do the fucking road and I'm literally Kevin like a

428
00:26:56.531 --> 00:27:00.490
panic attack.
Like,
yeah,
fuck,
I gotta get back out there again.

429
00:27:00.491 --> 00:27:04.980
But I know the second I get out there,
it's going to be great.
And,
um,

430
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.820
I'm really looking forward to these oddballs shows because,
uh,

431
00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.120
one I need the fucking money.
I haven't worked in two months and,
uh,

432
00:27:13.121 --> 00:27:17.500
I got the downstairs hanging over my goddamn head.

433
00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.770
Um,
you know,
what kills me is we put in this,
this,

434
00:27:20.771 --> 00:27:24.820
we put in this walk in closet right downstairs,

435
00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:29.650
um,
off this bathroom and you know,
it's an old house.
So it's,

436
00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:31.870
it's a walk in closet,

437
00:27:31.871 --> 00:27:36.871
the size of how fat people are today and how much extra shit we buy compared to

438
00:27:37.091 --> 00:27:39.610
back in the day when people,
you know,

439
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.000
you used to take shit down to the cobbler or get the TV repair.

440
00:27:44.001 --> 00:27:46.900
The TV Repairman was actually a fucking career,
you know,

441
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:50.980
he didn't just keep buying shit and then going to goodwill and throwing it at

442
00:27:50.981 --> 00:27:55.180
them and then buying more shit.
So anyways,
um,
I basically,

443
00:27:56.530 --> 00:28:00.640
this is how fucking hilarious women are and how much faster they're fucking

444
00:28:00.641 --> 00:28:04.780
brains are in certain areas.
When we came and we looked at this house,

445
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:09.670
I was just,
I don't know what I was looking at.
I just liked it.

446
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.990
And when we left the house

447
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:19.290
she was just like,
what'd you think?
I was like,
I dunno.
I liked that one.

448
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:22.380
Did she kind of went like,
I liked it too.
And then we got like excited,

449
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:27.330
but she had already worked out what room was going to be hers in which closets,

450
00:28:27.331 --> 00:28:31.380
when we're going to be hers.
And I have like,

451
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.090
I got like two half a closets,

452
00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:41.770
you know back when like someone who was like for clothes for like back when

453
00:28:41.771 --> 00:28:46.480
somebody was my size,
he was considered like,
I don't know what

454
00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.300
like I would be in like the,

455
00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:54.450
in the early days of the NBA at 510170170 five I don't know what you know,

456
00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.580
on a shit franchise.
I could have actually been a power forward.

457
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:07.490
I'm just saying people were smaller back then.
If you don't realize that,

458
00:29:07.491 --> 00:29:11.930
go to an old stadium,
whatever's left the Yale bowl to the rose bowl,

459
00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.220
you the cotton bowl,

460
00:29:13.221 --> 00:29:16.790
you go out to those old stadiums and what's hilarious is there a third of the

461
00:29:16.791 --> 00:29:20.480
size of the new stadiums and they hold more people.

462
00:29:20.481 --> 00:29:22.130
They hold like 100,000 people now.

463
00:29:22.131 --> 00:29:25.430
A lot of that is because there's not luxury boxes and all that fucking space

464
00:29:25.431 --> 00:29:26.780
where they have people walking around.

465
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:30.680
But when you're sitting down where they have the numbers on the aluminum
benches,

466
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.760
it's like they used to be back in the old Patriot's stadium.

467
00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.110
If you stood up during the winter when everybody had that puffy coats on during

468
00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:42.710
an exciting play,
if you were the last to try to sit down in your row,

469
00:29:42.711 --> 00:29:46.250
you lost your seat and you had to kind of crouch down and wait for something

470
00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:50.150
else.
Good to happen is people threw shit at you,
you know,
in a joking way,

471
00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:54.830
going down in front knowing what the deal was.
Um,

472
00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.840
so anyway,
so I have,
I have like these two,

473
00:29:56.841 --> 00:30:01.370
like one of the closets I have is so fucking small,
like,
um,

474
00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:06.220
it's basically from,
it's my shoulder with,
and it's,

475
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:11.240
it's long and it's that wide and up top it has like some,

476
00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:12.980
almost like it's not baseboard,

477
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:18.010
it's sent the middle of the wall and then it has what I hang my clothes on are

478
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.910
you don't like nunchuck handles.

479
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:23.090
Just imagine nunchuck handles being twice the size of that.

480
00:30:23.091 --> 00:30:26.770
And there's three of those.
And I,
I set them on that baseboard.

481
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:27.890
That's not a baseboard.

482
00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.270
Halfway up the wall at a 45 degree angle,

483
00:30:32.271 --> 00:30:35.570
there's three of them and then I hang clothes on them and what happens is

484
00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:39.020
inevitably I reached,
when I have to grab something in the second row,

485
00:30:39.021 --> 00:30:41.300
if I go to pull it off,
if I pull it off too quickly,

486
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.920
the whole thing falls down and takes down another row.
Um,

487
00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.700
so anyways,
anyways,
when we,

488
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:51.320
I got to say this quietly because she said she's in the other room when we

489
00:30:51.321 --> 00:30:54.380
started this fucking project.
Okay.

490
00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.200
That walk in closet downstairs.

491
00:30:57.201 --> 00:31:02.201
That was going to be mostly mine and partly hers,

492
00:31:02.271 --> 00:31:07.271
but it was going to be mostly mine and I don't know what happened during the

493
00:31:07.491 --> 00:31:11.930
fucking project,
but like I,
I've lost real estate down there again.

494
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:13.810
<v 3>Okay.</v>

495
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:17.920
<v 2>I I,
I'm,
I swear to God and now I'm actually,
you know what I'm thinking,
I'm like,</v>

496
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:22.570
I need to Redo the garage and I'm like,
there it is.
There it is.

497
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.290
I'm the stereotypical guy I have.

498
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:31.000
I am gradually being squeezed out of my house and I'm going to ice to do a bit

499
00:31:31.001 --> 00:31:34.240
about that.
Then when you get married,

500
00:31:34.241 --> 00:31:37.840
all your shit ends up in either the basement of the garage.

501
00:31:37.841 --> 00:31:41.170
We don't have a basement,
but we have a garage.
So,

502
00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:44.460
and this is the funny thing,

503
00:31:44.461 --> 00:31:48.000
I'm actually looking forward to it because it's not attached to the house.

504
00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.490
So I could,
could just kind of have that,
you know,

505
00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:56.310
I can walk away from my life that has actually,
it was a fantasy of mine.

506
00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:00.330
Like my dream house,
you know,

507
00:32:00.331 --> 00:32:04.410
if I wasn't in this fucking business was I would live up more in the country.

508
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.680
Um,
not literally the country,

509
00:32:07.681 --> 00:32:12.300
but I would live in a place that looked like the country but was still like a 45

510
00:32:12.301 --> 00:32:16.680
minute drive to a major city.
And I always wanted,
um,

511
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.790
I always like old houses cause I make everything in my fucking life difficulty,

512
00:32:20.791 --> 00:32:22.800
you know,
rather than just buying a new one.
I just,

513
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.460
I liked old shit so I would buy an old house,
fixed the whole thing up,

514
00:32:26.461 --> 00:32:31.461
but it would have a garage with a room over the garage that is,

515
00:32:32.991 --> 00:32:34.860
is detached from the house.

516
00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:40.550
Ideally it's an old barn and down below I would have my old truck and then I

517
00:32:45.031 --> 00:32:49.230
would have some selfish vehicle,
like a fucking corvette,
some two cedar.

518
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:54.030
Like,
fuck you people.
I know I'm married,
but you know,
I need some me time.

519
00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:57.900
And then upstairs I'd have my drums,
guitars and all of that Shit,

520
00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.120
you know.
And then,
you know,
of course a flat screen TV and a fuss.

521
00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.150
Let's just go all out of fucking refrigerator,

522
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:08.840
<v 4>right.
With like,
uh,
you know,</v>

523
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:14.060
<v 2>all kinds of booze in their humor,
door,
cigars,</v>

524
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.690
you know,
fire,
escape up the back for horse,
whatever.
You get the idea.

525
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.190
Um,
so now I'm thinking,
you know,

526
00:33:28.191 --> 00:33:32.620
I got this garage,
I mean,
not like I'm going to put another floor on it,
but,
uh,

527
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:38.030
eventually I'm actually at this point because of my situation in my house,

528
00:33:38.031 --> 00:33:43.031
my lack of closet space and the fact that I bought this old Ludwig drum kit with

529
00:33:43.581 --> 00:33:47.750
John Bonham size drums,
like a 26 inch bass drum,
it's fucking huge.

530
00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:51.000
Um,
that I'm actually thinking of a,

531
00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:52.620
<v 1>okay.</v>

532
00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.980
<v 2>Eventually,
I don't know,
redoing the,</v>

533
00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.620
I'm more excited to Redo the garage than I am the kitchen.

534
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:03.990
Put it that way because a,
that's how it works.
That's how it works.

535
00:34:03.991 --> 00:34:05.840
By the way,
somebody sent me a,
um,

536
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:12.170
somebody sent me a text of,
uh,
Mel Gibson's divorce settlement.

537
00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:14.403
<v 4>MMM.</v>

538
00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.930
<v 2>And you don't want,
it's funny,
the first half of it didn't even bother me.</v>

539
00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:20.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

540
00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:25.010
<v 2>He was worth like 800 million.
He's been with his wife for 30 years.</v>

541
00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:29.540
She gave him seven fucking kids.
Okay.

542
00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.670
Seven kids.

543
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.830
So she gets half that fortunate.
You know what?
I don't get a problem with that.

544
00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:38.203
Fuck it.

545
00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:39.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

546
00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:39.721
<v 2>You know,</v>

547
00:34:39.721 --> 00:34:44.721
I'll take 400 million take who gives a fuck at that point you had seven kids.

548
00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:50.550
God bless you.
Here you go.
I'll give you a 500 million.
I'll keep 300 million.

549
00:34:50.551 --> 00:34:55.551
What fucking killed me is she gets half of all of his checks for the rest of her

550
00:34:56.971 --> 00:35:00.750
life,
the rest of Mel's life.
And that's,

551
00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.690
that's that extra shit.
Like,
it's like,
come on,
man.

552
00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.970
He just gave you $400 million.

553
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

554
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.610
<v 2>You can't,
you can't</v>

555
00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.460
like survive on that for the rest of your life.

556
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:19.680
You got to go after that.
But I guess what it is,
is really,

557
00:35:19.681 --> 00:35:20.970
it isn't even about the money.

558
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.450
It's more about I gave you 30 years of my fucking life.

559
00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:29.740
Okay.
I absolutely blew out my fucking body for you.

560
00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

561
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:34.880
<v 2>And now you're going to go get with this Russian whore</v>

562
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:37.540
<v 0>and what am I to do?</v>

563
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:38.600
<v 4>Okay.</v>

564
00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.450
<v 0>I wanted to hang with you for the rest of my life,
you know,</v>

565
00:35:41.451 --> 00:35:42.860
and enjoy our golden years.

566
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:47.610
And now I've got to go to a fucking bingo parlor to find somebody else.
Yeah,

567
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:52.270
maybe I get it.
Maybe I get it,
but I gotta be honest.

568
00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.830
Somebody sent me that,
that,
uh,

569
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:59.950
or tweeted it to me and I read it and it actually was keeping me up at night

570
00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:06.380
last night thinking about that.
Uh,
but I always end up finding the positive.

571
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:07.930
<v 4>Okay.</v>

572
00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:09.330
<v 0>I was just like,
you know what?</v>

573
00:36:09.331 --> 00:36:14.331
I would just completely 100% downsize my life and I would live like I'd have one

574
00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:21.060
fork,
one spoon,
one knife,
one bowl.
When plate one glass,

575
00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.940
I would just make everything super fucking simple.

576
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:25.833
<v 4>MMM.</v>

577
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.760
<v 0>I dress like fucking Albert Einstein,
you know,</v>

578
00:36:30.761 --> 00:36:34.450
I would have the same fucking outfit every God Damn Day.

579
00:36:34.451 --> 00:36:37.000
I would just make it ridiculously simple.

580
00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:38.943
<v 4>MMM.</v>

581
00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.100
<v 0>Yeah.
And then I'd live in it.</v>

582
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.200
I get a flat screen in a fucking pullout couch and I would just have a,

583
00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.210
all the sports packages and a dog and that would be it.

584
00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:52.110
And I would just keep it like that and I drive my old truck and that would be
it.

585
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:55.110
I would just,
that would be it.
That would be my fucking life.

586
00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:00.960
I wear chuck Taylors.
I would just keep it simple.

587
00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.370
That actually doesn't sound like a bad life,
does it?

588
00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.090
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

589
00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:12.680
<v 0>I mean even that life,
that's how spoiled I am living in a first world country.</v>

590
00:37:12.681 --> 00:37:17.420
Like that's my,
you know.
Did you hear what happened to bill?

591
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:23.650
He has a place to live and can watch sports 24 hours a day and he has a dog and

592
00:37:25.731 --> 00:37:29.870

the poor bastard.

625
00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:38.210
Let's get back to the podcast.
Um,

626
00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:41.720
oh my God.
So I didn't mention I was up late night.

627
00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:43.380
<v 4>Okay.</v>

628
00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.650
<v 0>And,
uh,
I was watching,
uh,
you know,</v>

629
00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:46.580
<v 4>okay.</v>

630
00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:51.230
<v 0>Having a couple of drinks,
this was months and months ago and it was,</v>

631
00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:53.060
it was one of those time life.

632
00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:54.340
<v 4>Okay.</v>

633
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:58.090
<v 0>Like music collections.
And it was this easy listening rock,</v>

634
00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:03.930
this easy listening frog music that they had and they just had like two former

635
00:40:03.931 --> 00:40:06.930
stars.
So then go and who can forget this one?
You know,

636
00:40:06.931 --> 00:40:11.670
the music of our childhood is so important.
Absolutely.
Randy.

637
00:40:11.671 --> 00:40:15.210
And it's timeless.
What about this BG Song?
Right.

638
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.340
Shadow dancing or whatever the fuck they was singing.
I can't,

639
00:40:19.341 --> 00:40:22.380
for some reason I'm going blank on all the fucking song.
So long story short,

640
00:40:22.381 --> 00:40:26.790
I actually bought the box set and uh,
I've just been driving around.

641
00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:28.530
<v 4>Okay.</v>

642
00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:30.480
<v 0>Listening to this fucking soft rock.</v>

643
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:35.670
Maybe if you won't me baby if you need me.

644
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:39.510
Yeah.
That,
oh,
just all of this shit.

645
00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:46.010
So they actually had a doobie brothers song Saturday in the park and I realized

646
00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:48.430
<v 4>that</v>

647
00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:49.610
<v 0>as a comedian,</v>

648
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:54.050
my bucket list is I want to be in the city of Boston at Karaoke.

649
00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:58.220
And I want to listen to somebody sing that song just for the first line.

650
00:40:59.260 --> 00:40:59.460
<v 4>Okay.</v>

651
00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:03.390
<v 0>You know,
da Da da Da.
But,</v>

652
00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:07.920
but it'll do,
do,
do,
do,
do,
do,

653
00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:12.570
do say and the park

654
00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:19.140
people in Boston don't really say,
say they say Saturday,

655
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.050
why don't you come over one Saturday?

656
00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.340
Hey niggas in here,

657
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:30.550
a man selling ice cream singing it and songs.

658
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.040
You got to admit the

659
00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:37.280
<v 7>upgrade is that it's a good,
it's very positive and uplifting.</v>

660
00:41:37.281 --> 00:41:41.660
But was he really just in the park on a Saturday and just wrote a song about the

661
00:41:41.661 --> 00:41:42.830
things that he was observing?

662
00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:47.860
Cause it really sounds like that people dad cheering people laughing,

663
00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:49.980
man shelling.

664
00:41:49.981 --> 00:41:54.981
I you scream singing Chell huge songs

665
00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:00.000
anyways.
And of course are you talking about your,

666
00:42:00.001 --> 00:42:04.040
your box set that you got drunk at one in the morning?
Yeah.
What,
what,

667
00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.450
what are some of the other songs that were on there?
It was like,

668
00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:12.460
didn't they have like air supply on there and Linda Ron stands and Linda

669
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.300
Ronstadt through when the smokers so vain.
That's it.

670
00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:19.850
I bet you currently that song is about you,
right?
Yeah.
All that,

671
00:42:19.851 --> 00:42:24.800
all that stuff.
Just soft rock.
But you know what,
like eight cds sets.

672
00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:29.480
Remember this from the,
you know.
Oh absolutely.

673
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:34.070
And I'll tell you right now,
one of my favorite things was this next guy.

674
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:37.250
What was that guy,
Rupert something or other Rupert Holmes.

675
00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.020
Him or him at the song I never heard of in my entire life.

676
00:42:42.021 --> 00:42:43.180
That was a filler song.

677
00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:48.950
Then they also had all these songs from the 80s it kind of bothered me a that

678
00:42:48.951 --> 00:42:51.280
they act.
I should,
they had a couple of,
uh,

679
00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:53.540
but this is stuff that you would find on like a,

680
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:58.700
like an easy listening type of like old school soft rock station.
Right.

681
00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:02.520
I think it's just because the little seven the way.

682
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:04.903
Exactly.

683
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:10.010
But I have like a line drawn in the sand as far as like seventies and 80s

684
00:43:10.011 --> 00:43:14.900
because to me it,
why?
Because I just think as you go from decade to decade,

685
00:43:14.901 --> 00:43:18.170
it's just such a jarring change because whoever's coming up,

686
00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.890
if they're going to make it,
you know,
if you tried to do that more of the same,

687
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:26.810
you're literally going to try to float on the fumes of this other style.

688
00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:28.010
It's going out.
You've got to change.

689
00:43:28.011 --> 00:43:31.620
So that disco went into like new wave in the,
in the,

690
00:43:31.621 --> 00:43:36.621
that metal music into grunge and then wrap took over and like,

691
00:43:37.551 --> 00:43:41.110
not like rap wasn't around but like I just,
I dunno.

692
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:46.150
So for me like that seventies like how do you put in like with Saturday in the

693
00:43:47.601 --> 00:43:47.870
park,

694
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:52.130
how do you put in like genesis or Mike and the mechanics in the living years?

695
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:56.870
Cause I think it's just all sort of,
I never talked to my dad,

696
00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:59.240
he was a fucking Dick,

697
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:05.450
but he bought me a bicycle genre of just like soft,

698
00:44:05.451 --> 00:44:09.240
not too hard.
Who'll say loan

699
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:15.530
back up.
Black singers to make me sound like I hit soul.

700
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:19.760
You burn up your friend of Michael McDonald because he is a national treasure.

701
00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.550
I was talking about Mike and the mechanics.
What was that?
Oh No,

702
00:44:22.551 --> 00:44:23.990
I've heard of him.
He was the,

703
00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:28.580
he was the bearded guy who looked like the father on family ties,

704
00:44:28.581 --> 00:44:31.570
but he was actually in genesis.
Oh,
okay.

705
00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.450
<v 0>I know who the father of family ties look like.</v>

706
00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:37.930
That's an awesome song.
That song,

707
00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:40.210
you know some people your age 10 years younger than me.

708
00:44:40.211 --> 00:44:43.340
I think that song is awesome because he was no,

709
00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.100
because you have or have an awesome memories.

710
00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.040
When that song came out you didn't have to pay for anything.

711
00:44:48.041 --> 00:44:50.140
You know you went to school like your big thing was like,

712
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:55.110
<v 7>oh my God,
I have a pimple on my face.
Like your life was easy.</v>

713
00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:59.390
Why can't I just like a song?
Because I like a song because that song sucks.

714
00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:01.920
Does it really fun?

715
00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.370
<v 0>Soon as this one,</v>

716
00:45:04.371 --> 00:45:07.360
people decided that they didn't like Phil Collins cause he went into like,
no,

717
00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:11.840
this is when people were loving everything that he was doing.
They forgot.

718
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:15.020
See wasn't.
One thing that people forget about Phil Collins is that guy.

719
00:45:15.021 --> 00:45:16.910
He's one of the greatest drummers in the last 40 years.

720
00:45:16.911 --> 00:45:18.560
He's a fucking insane drummer.

721
00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:23.820
And Genesis initially was this progressive rock band,
uh,

722
00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:27.410
had Peter Gabriel and it was just up monsters in this band.

723
00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:31.750
And then they trim down like all of them after a while,

724
00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:34.540
<v 7>just like,
man,
let's just get fucking paid,
man.</v>

725
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:37.900
Let's stop doing 20 minute jams.
Wait,

726
00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:42.280
who is that band that their video is hilarious because they're on some sort of

727
00:45:42.281 --> 00:45:47.281
boardwalk and they're playing like they're main playing instruments even though

728
00:45:47.291 --> 00:45:51.270
they know how to do it.
That's journey.
Yeah.
Oh wait,
it's a day.

729
00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:55.620
Love will fudge you break those chains that.

730
00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.330
Yeah.
Yeah.
And they fucking said

731
00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:02.620
<v 0>no.
Sorry.
When the concepts were,</v>

732
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:05.180
when they first started making videos are just,

733
00:46:05.181 --> 00:46:08.150
you just see how they're just throwing everything against the wall and just

734
00:46:08.151 --> 00:46:12.170
seeing what works.
They're like,
how about we play with no instruments,
man,

735
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:16.760
let's try to make it interesting.
Um,
it's like,
why would you,

736
00:46:16.761 --> 00:46:20.690
why would you do that?
But they thought it was a really cool concept at the time,

737
00:46:20.691 --> 00:46:24.210
but 80 his videos are the best.
There's so much fun.
Another ridiculous.

738
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:27.890
Another Phil Collins one.
This is Solo Phil Collins that you love.

739
00:46:27.891 --> 00:46:30.500
That's on his collection,
that who can forget these songs in the,

740
00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:33.920
who can forget this hit was a,
that song.
Uh,

741
00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:38.050
take a look at me now.
Yeah,
that sounds awful.

742
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:42.110
Because I have a gun in my mouth

743
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:47.240
<v 7>and even though I'm a rock star really,
and I can get a bunch of pussies,</v>

744
00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:50.780
I can't stop thinking about your photos.

745
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:55.650
<v 0>There's really no,
there's,</v>

746
00:46:55.790 --> 00:47:00.000
there's really no need for you to take it to that dark place.
Okay.
He's got,

747
00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:01.580
it is,
it is a dark place.

748
00:47:01.581 --> 00:47:04.520
I went to the day of the fucking though they're the memorial for Robin Williams.

749
00:47:04.521 --> 00:47:05.690
It's a sad fucking time.

750
00:47:05.691 --> 00:47:08.210
And that song will make you put a fucking gun in your mouth.
I mean,

751
00:47:08.211 --> 00:47:12.470
it is pretty depressing.
Thank you.
Okay.
All right.
Fair enough.
See that.

752
00:47:12.471 --> 00:47:17.360
That's why you're the shit.
Why?
Cause I eventually agree with you.
No,

753
00:47:17.361 --> 00:47:20.600
because if you're wrong,
you would admit it.
Yeah,
it is depressing,

754
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:24.440
but it's beautiful at the same time,
but it's very sad and it's,

755
00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:28.760
it is definitely something you listened to in the dark crying and drinking
alone.

756
00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:30.040
I do.
I drive down the

757
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.040
<v 7>street like Rutan fulfill it.
Come on,
get your shit together.</v>

758
00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:35.260
You sound like you're on her front lawn.

759
00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:41.290
And then she stayed with an empty space.
She's dating some bigger dude.

760
00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:45.610
You will be go take care of that guy.
No,
I'll handle it.
I'll handle it.

761
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:50.160
Fill up.
You have to stop coming over the house.

762
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:54.100
I told you that moves on,
eh?
You comment back to me,

763
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:58.910
Philip?
I've called the police.
Okay.
He's,

764
00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:03.500
he's got a hatchback with all his shit in the back or Phil Collins,

765
00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.130
dumb tennis shoes that don't have fucking laces in them.

766
00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.340
How is Phil Collins these days?
There was an article written about him.

767
00:48:09.341 --> 00:48:09.880
I feel like it

768
00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.490
<v 0>rolling stone a few years ago.
Yeah.</v>

769
00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:15.100
It was really the angriest man and rock or something.
No,
no,
no.
It wasn't angry.

770
00:48:15.101 --> 00:48:17.830
It was just,
he was a,
he was in a bad place.

771
00:48:17.831 --> 00:48:21.400
He was going through like his third fucking divorce and physically he couldn't

772
00:48:21.401 --> 00:48:22.151
play drums anymore.

773
00:48:22.151 --> 00:48:27.151
But I think he's come out of that and he was also couldn't understand why he was

774
00:48:27.461 --> 00:48:30.810
considered the antichrist by a lot of music fans.
Why was he can,

775
00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:33.220
that's what I was wondering.
That's why I was saying earlier,

776
00:48:33.221 --> 00:48:36.310
it wasn't there a period where people decided that they hated him.
Why?

777
00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.340
Because there's this terrific seeded the,
yeah,

778
00:48:39.341 --> 00:48:44.341
but this is tipping point where you become so successful and you have so much

779
00:48:44.501 --> 00:48:49.501
money and when the next group of people comes up and they rebel against that

780
00:48:51.491 --> 00:48:55.690
era,
like in the 80s,
disco sucked.
All right.

781
00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.910
And to sixties with the coolest fucking thing ever.

782
00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:01.840
And then the 90s came and then the 90s,
it was like the 70s were fucking cool,

783
00:49:01.841 --> 00:49:06.490
boogie nights and all that shit.
And then the 80s were,
were like,
uh,
you know,

784
00:49:06.491 --> 00:49:09.580
that was all cheesy horse shit and hair metal and all that fucking crap.

785
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:13.660
So he got so big,
he defined that era,

786
00:49:13.661 --> 00:49:14.950
kind of like the bgs.

787
00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:18.850
So I think now it's coming back around what people like him like you.

788
00:49:18.851 --> 00:49:21.850
Like I'm Joe de Rosa and sensation,

789
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.290
the teen idol sensation from the opiate Anthony Program.
He uh,

790
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:30.910
he,
he loves Phil Collins.
Um,
oh,

791
00:49:30.911 --> 00:49:34.270
he's actually going to be down the,
the goddamn comedy jam tonight.

792
00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:39.200
<v 7>Oh yeah.
Very good.
Is he gonna is he gonna jam man,</v>

793
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:44.150
he's going to sing.
Oh my God,
this is incredible.
Oh,
you're excited for it.

794
00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:47.300
Oh,
you know how I,
you know how I love our son Joe to Rosa

795
00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:50.390
as we used to call them.
We lived in New York.

796
00:49:50.391 --> 00:49:54.020
He's always cause we'd agree to have him come over for dinner and villain high

797
00:49:54.021 --> 00:49:58.220
kind of adopted Joe.
We all lived in New York.

798
00:49:58.850 --> 00:49:59.990
Yeah,
you too guys.

799
00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:04.010
The way you guys would eat like steak to the point you would eat when you get a

800
00:50:04.011 --> 00:50:07.550
Ribeye,
you be eating all the gristle too.
Like I never saw that.

801
00:50:07.551 --> 00:50:10.260
It was like you might have had John Candy movie where he had,

802
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:14.480
he had to eat the thing,
the fat he was eating that,

803
00:50:14.481 --> 00:50:19.090
that the big steak or whatever it is.
And you have a 72 ounces.

804
00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:23.300
Yeah,
no Joe and I like to get really like to get right down into it.

805
00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:28.430
Joe said he would eat the bones if he could.
Okay.
I'm not going to go that far,

806
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:31.570
but yeah,
you got to get all the meat off that bone baby.
Okay.

807
00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.420
<v 0>Go grab another mic so I don't have to keep passing it over to go grab another</v>

808
00:50:35.421 --> 00:50:36.530
mic with the cord and all that.

809
00:50:36.531 --> 00:50:40.430
And I'm going to read one of these questions here.
Okay.
Uh,
oh.
Hey,

810
00:50:40.431 --> 00:50:43.160
this is a good thing here.
I want to thank the listeners.

811
00:50:43.161 --> 00:50:47.690
Everybody went out and downloaded Nicu seps,
uh,
all things comedy member,

812
00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:53.550
part of the,
part of the mob here.
Uh,

813
00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:58.460
downloaded his,
uh,
his comedy album last last week.
Everybody was really pleased.

814
00:50:58.461 --> 00:51:01.300
A lot of people hadn't heard about nick.
He's underground.

815
00:51:01.301 --> 00:51:03.740
Even want to be the first person on your block to say,
Hey,

816
00:51:03.741 --> 00:51:07.160
I know about this cool new comedian.
I'm seriously,
man,

817
00:51:07.161 --> 00:51:09.590
this guy's the real deal in his,
uh,
his car,

818
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:13.860
his album made it to number three on iTunes.
How about that?
Hey,
uh,

819
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:18.260
the microphones in the,
uh,
it's in the closet.
My half a closet that I have Nini.

820
00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:18.850
Oh

821
00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:20.770
<v 7>God,
what do you mean?
Oh God,</v>

822
00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:25.560
<v 0>can we talk about that?
Nia,
how I walked in and just loved this house.</v>

823
00:51:25.561 --> 00:51:29.310
You walked in,
love this house and also picked out all the choice spots.

824
00:51:29.311 --> 00:51:31.470
It was fucking amazing how you able to do that?

825
00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:34.120
<v 7>How did you do that?</v>

826
00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:40.300
How can you just take all the fucking closets and leave me?

827
00:51:40.301 --> 00:51:45.301
Leave me without a space in me to test this thing first for my fucking shirts

828
00:51:46.211 --> 00:51:48.090
and my damn socks.

829
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:54.340
All the spots are for you.
We have er,

830
00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:55.510
a closet whore.

831
00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.730
I really don't appreciate that.

832
00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.030
We both have the same kind of closet space and the bedroom.

833
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:10.030
Okay.
You want to trade closets?
What do you mean?
And this,
this area.
Well,
no,

834
00:52:10.031 --> 00:52:13.120
I mean I have all my stuff's settled right now.
How?
How brilliant was that?

835
00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:17.400
<v 0>She literally gives herself time.
Do what you want to trades.</v>

836
00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:18.660
Do you want to trade closets?

837
00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.420
What do you mean all of a sudden you don't understand English?

838
00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:25.210
<v 7>I understand.
Excuse me.
Don't insult me.
Don't,</v>

839
00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:27.950
don't you don't play the I'm offended card.
It has.
No,

840
00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.570
you know exactly what's going on.

841
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:33.620
I have half a fucking closet that's hanging off this house that is not up to

842
00:52:33.621 --> 00:52:36.590
code and it has a piece of fucking wood holding it up.

843
00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:40.280
I told you that I would help you go to the container store and figuring out how

844
00:52:40.281 --> 00:52:43.250
to organize your shit the way that I did.
That's what I did.

845
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:46.490
You saw it took me like three months to figure it all out and get it all in

846
00:52:46.491 --> 00:52:47.324
there perfectly.

847
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:51.080
It told you I can help you with data and you don't have patience for that.

848
00:52:51.350 --> 00:52:55.940
You don't have patients lion face.
Neil,

849
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:59.960
that slab in anything.
All right,
I told you I would help you out.
Okay,

850
00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:04.220
so you don't have patience for that sort of thing and you know,

851
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:08.810
are you done with your horse shit near both of your closet?

852
00:53:08.811 --> 00:53:13.020
You can walk into,
you can walk in to that one and what?

853
00:53:13.021 --> 00:53:16.770
Stand sideways.
I can't really,
you know what I can do in my closets.

854
00:53:16.771 --> 00:53:21.170
I know I can do that.
I can do that.
Hammertime dance in both of my closets

855
00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:26.070
and you know what?
Either the back of my head on my little button nose is going

856
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:28.650
<v 0>to scrape on the wall.
And I did say button nose.</v>

857
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:33.540
I have a cute nose on my giant face.
I thought I was the one with the cute nose.

858
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:36.480
Oh,
you know something.
You took all the closet space.

859
00:53:36.481 --> 00:53:39.500
Can I at least be the one with the cute nose?
Okay,
there we go.

860
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:43.920
You can have the trash for that on the podcast.
He makes cook.

861
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:49.170
Hey.
Yes.
So now we're going to don't start.
Yes.

862
00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:53.820
And me that downstairs closet.
That'll be done in 2016.

863
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:59.010
That is mine.
Um,
I think we're going to share it as really what we've,

864
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:02.460
I don't like the way you share.
What does that,
what are you talking about?

865
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:05.460
I'm going to have this closet up here.

866
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:09.330
I'm only putting down two closets upstairs and you can walk into and do a little

867
00:54:09.331 --> 00:54:13.680
dance mega [inaudible] get down tonight cooking.
Forget this one.

868
00:54:13.681 --> 00:54:17.130
Who can forget this one?
Let's get to the,
uh,
let's get to the,
uh,

869
00:54:17.131 --> 00:54:21.960
the questions for the week.
Homeless with a plan.
Dear Boxcar,
Billy.
That's good.

870
00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:27.270
That's actually really good.
If you found yourself homeless tomorrow,

871
00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.870
what would you,
what would be your game plan?
Oh my God.

872
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:34.920
Where would you set up shop?
Are you and under the bridge guy?

873
00:54:34.921 --> 00:54:37.020
That's the first thing I thought of.
Or a beach guy.

874
00:54:37.021 --> 00:54:38.070
I'm definitely not a beach guys.

875
00:54:38.071 --> 00:54:41.910
Do you sleep all day to be alert to the dangers of the night?
Oh,

876
00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:45.510
is that what they do?
Yeah,
that makes complete sense.
Yeah.

877
00:54:45.511 --> 00:54:49.320
The ones who can't fight,
they sleep during the day.

878
00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:51.780
I think that's also just common sense though actually.

879
00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:55.520
You know what they're like,
they're like rabbits.
What does that mean?
Rabbits.

880
00:54:55.521 --> 00:55:00.000
So like the IRA,
but vicious.
No rabbits and just like,
uh,

881
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:05.460
they exist to keep everything else fed in nature.

882
00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:08.380
That's why they fuck like rabbits.
They can have a bunch of them there.

883
00:55:08.381 --> 00:55:13.290
They're like Coleslaw on the,
uh,
the meat platter.
Coleslaw.

884
00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:16.800
Coleslaw really is like a filler.
It fills up the plate.

885
00:55:16.801 --> 00:55:19.140
But I actually was defending Coleslaw to Paul Versey.

886
00:55:19.141 --> 00:55:21.390
It's like when somebody knows how to make it,

887
00:55:21.391 --> 00:55:22.560
some people don't know how to make it.

888
00:55:22.561 --> 00:55:26.790
They make it all wet and fucking make yeah,
too much man is,

889
00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:31.190
what about our old neighbor though?
He May.
Aha.
He made the fucking,
uh,

890
00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:35.030
he made the hardy one.
Yeah.
He made it very like crisp and it's more selection.

891
00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:38.960
Agree in Tangy.
Jason Law had,
makes an unbelievable fucking Coleslaw.

892
00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:43.500
But Jason,
I had,
couldn't cook anything and can make a meal out of anything.

893
00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:45.600
That's right.
Well,
let me,
let me finish this right here.
Okay.

894
00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:48.440
Do you sleep all day to be alert to the dangers at night?
Uh,

895
00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:53.370
you could beg or play drums on some pots and pans.
Thanks for the last,

896
00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:57.600
uh,
listener from New Hampshire,
New Hampshire,
New Hampshire.

897
00:55:57.601 --> 00:56:01.170
That's God's country up there.
That was the,
still have the,

898
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:05.640
the pollsters we ever took like a little vacation together.
Do you remember?

899
00:56:05.641 --> 00:56:09.060
That was in New Hampshire in the captain's quarters.

900
00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:14.130
Captain's quarters.
That's level like beach lake type business.

901
00:56:14.131 --> 00:56:18.510
They've got over there.
Anyway,
I can see you.
Uh,
that was great.
That was great.

902
00:56:18.511 --> 00:56:20.580
And it was low.
It was perfect white trash from me.

903
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:24.190
There's enough tatted up people with tank.
It was enough

904
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:25.590
<v 7>fucking,
uh,</v>

905
00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:30.660
just sorta ate Mac and cheese is a main course meal like me with toast to like

906
00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:36.280
spray that kind of like center tense SPF on you.

907
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:41.590
It was supposed to,
supposed to give you like a tan and it didn't work.

908
00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:47.060
You'd like to fucking spray cans and nothing happened.

909
00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:50.320
Wouldn't take just what did take like your,
your,

910
00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:54.330
your skin repels color.
Like it's resistance.

911
00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:58.310
Like it just won't happen for you.
It won't happen.

912
00:56:58.910 --> 00:57:00.500
It just won't,
you get,

913
00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:05.640
you get more freckles on my forearms and like your lower legs.

914
00:57:05.711 --> 00:57:09.060
But other than that,
it's nothing.
Well,

915
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:12.790
what happens is if my suit can't take like a spray Tan essentially,

916
00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:18.060
like what kind of pasty melanin deficient fucking piece of freak nature are you

917
00:57:19.781 --> 00:57:24.130
that you can't even,
I'm being so mean,
right?
Not I don't give a shit.
It's true.

918
00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:26.890
I will observe.
Notice I didn't interrupt you.
I will,

919
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:30.490
I will object when you say something that isn't accurate.
All right,

920
00:57:30.491 --> 00:57:34.270
so obviously sleeping during the day is going to be rough for me because of the

921
00:57:34.271 --> 00:57:37.810
sun.
So I either choose a beat down or I get sunburned.

922
00:57:37.811 --> 00:57:41.680
So definitely gotta do you gotta do the bridge?
It's shady here for you,

923
00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:46.330
but it also,
it also smells like urine.
So you know,

924
00:57:46.331 --> 00:57:50.030
you gotta take the good with the bubble.
Um,

925
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:55.020
and who can forget this impactful hit?
Um,
you know,

926
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:55.690
I used to,

927
00:57:55.690 --> 00:58:00.690
I used to play drums with this guy and he was into the Chili peppers and we used

928
00:58:01.991 --> 00:58:04.810
to play the song that was really fun to play,
but I hated the lyrics.

929
00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:09.910
Why Suck my kiss?
Oh,
okay.
I hate

930
00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:17.140
fucking hated the lyrics.

931
00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.370
Uh,
yeah,
that's a rough one.

932
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:30.470
The best thing about the red hot chili peppers way.
Yes.
Way,
right?
No,

933
00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:33.130
just the whole band.
It's the whole,
the whole band is awesome.

934
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:36.160
I love Anthony Kiedis.
I liked you.
Hated his fucking,

935
00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:39.670
what is Hitler mustache is Hitler mustache.

936
00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:44.870
His autobiography where it was just one and then I was banging this hot chick

937
00:58:44.871 --> 00:58:47.240
and I was in love and I found it.

938
00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:51.580
I found inseparable.
I liked Dave.
And you know what,

939
00:58:51.581 --> 00:58:55.930
when they came off to me like a bully and he was mean to fleet and I was like,

940
00:58:55.931 --> 00:59:00.700
this guy's a dick and flee needs to know how to draw some fucking lines and be

941
00:59:00.701 --> 00:59:03.400
like,
listen Anthony,
I'm not putting up with that shit.

942
00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.950
He knows how to take care of himself.
Just fine.

943
00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:09.670
Fleas seems scrappy and a little bit,
you know what,

944
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:14.850
he wears his heart on his sleeve.
That's what I got out of it.
Oh,
flee.
No fleas,

945
00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:18.160
flea love mass and we love you would definitely,

946
00:59:18.161 --> 00:59:22.360
he would be a street performer for sure.
Boxcar,
Billy.
I swear to God,

947
00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:24.460
it's fantastic.

948
00:59:25.210 --> 00:59:28.600
<v 0>I would,
uh,
it'd be a bus.
What I did know,</v>

949
00:59:28.601 --> 00:59:33.580
I would be up during the day and I would sleep at night until I took that first

950
00:59:33.581 --> 00:59:34.690
brutal ass kicking.

951
00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.990
Like when the clockwork orange guys came around and started kicking me in the

952
00:59:37.991 --> 00:59:41.650
ribs,
then I would be a broken,
ribbed,

953
00:59:42.310 --> 00:59:46.000
balding Billy sleeping on the sidewalk.
Like that guy down the street.

954
00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.450
When I walk Cleo by Clio,
always funny,
like,
you know,

955
00:59:49.451 --> 00:59:51.490
she's always viewing everybody is a threat.

956
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:55.850
She actually looks down at this person with like this look of concern.

957
00:59:56.070 --> 00:59:58.040
<v 7>Right?
Let's see.
Okay.
Yeah.
Is this,</v>

958
00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:01.970
they can tell her and like she wants to like sniff and stuff.
[inaudible] like,

959
01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:06.390
hey buddy.
Hey is everything all right?
She's curious about a lot of people.

960
01:00:06.391 --> 01:00:09.030
It's interesting.
It's not necessarily in a bad way.

961
01:00:09.031 --> 01:00:12.510
I don't think I see her kind of wanting to approach women a lot of time.

962
01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:16.480
<v 0>Well she sexist.
So yeah,
I would,
I would be a a,</v>

963
01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:18.500
I would initially be an under the bridge guy,

964
01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:23.660
but I would find a bridge that nobody else was at,
um,
on.

965
01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:28.110
I would also be homeless in a the nicest neighborhood I could be.
And

966
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:34.140
they'd run you out though.
You can't be a nice neighborhood with the world.

967
01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.850
That's what I'm saying.
Like the nicest neighbor.
It could be homeless in Wa.

968
01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:40.060
Cause then I could walk to a nicer neighborhood

969
01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:42.640
<v 7>like,
hey man,
can you help me out?</v>

970
01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:48.010
<v 0>Have Arc and I would have every lie on my side,</v>

971
01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:52.630
terminal disease,
homeless,
vet,
anything I could fucking Dick.
I gotta make money,

972
01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:53.650
I'd do anything.

973
01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:56.510
<v 7>What do you think about those people who are like,
you know,</v>

974
01:00:56.511 --> 01:01:00.580
why lie I want to get high?
Well I didn't mean it.
I am like,

975
01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:05.240
I liked it when I first,
but now I think it's hacky.
Okay.
You need to get a new,

976
01:01:05.241 --> 01:01:09.890
you need to get a blue a slogan.
They're clever.
Homeless people.
Absolutely.

977
01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:11.391
Alright,
fiancee.

978
01:01:11.391 --> 01:01:14.100
And we got to get moving here because we've got to get the dog on the uh,
uh,

979
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:18.560
we're already an hour and fiance getting crazy fit.
Hey Billy biceps.

980
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:22.460
Uh,
today at least say that.
Yeah.

981
01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:26.060
<v 0>Oh,
why you didn't like it?
Cause it was sort of complimentary.
Now come on.</v>

982
01:01:26.061 --> 01:01:29.210
How good a shape.
My end right now.
You look amazing.
Thank you.
Uh,

983
01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:33.380
today I have an odd problem than I am hoping you can lend me some advice.

984
01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:39.050
Uh,
it should have said and I'm hoping that,
I'm hoping that,
I'm hoping.

985
01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:42.350
I have always been on an on and off gym rat.

986
01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:46.850
My fiance is amazing looking and worked as a Disney world dancer,

987
01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.180
which kept her in fantastic shape recently.

988
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:53.150
She took a new job and sits behind a desk all day.

989
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:56.870
Looking for a new way to stay fit.
She started heading to the gym with me,

990
01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:00.680
always great for a while to recently she found a new workout program.

991
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:05.540
Now she's addicted to lifting and with the advice of a personal trainer is

992
01:02:05.541 --> 01:02:09.920
looking to become a bikini competitor.
Sounds great.
Right?
Not so much.

993
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:10.581
First off,

994
01:02:10.581 --> 01:02:15.170
most bikini competitions are crazy ripped manly,

995
01:02:15.171 --> 01:02:18.710
ripped a,
if I was into that I would,

996
01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:22.290
I change teams.
Uh,
next issue,

997
01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:27.870
not me.
I'm going to keep going.
Would you want your man to look like a woman?
Uh,

998
01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:30.450
next issue is that she doesn't want it.
All right.

999
01:02:30.451 --> 01:02:32.490
Talking to talk about my ignorance at the end of this,

1000
01:02:32.491 --> 01:02:34.920
I realize 40% of why that was a ignorant comment.

1001
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.890
Next issue is that she doesn't want to have fun anymore.

1002
01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.650
We are in the mid twenties no kids and live alone.

1003
01:02:40.651 --> 01:02:45.480
We normally do a little partying,
which has gotten cut out to save all calories.

1004
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:50.750
And last off is that she really is a 10 now her swinging dick in the weight room

1005
01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:54.450
throws lines.
No,
no,
no.

1006
01:02:54.451 --> 01:02:57.630
Now every swinging dick in the weight room throws lines that are every day.

1007
01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.490
I trust her and have no worries,

1008
01:02:59.491 --> 01:03:02.880
but it gets under your skin for these selfish reasons.

1009
01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:06.030
I could use some advice.
I support her no matter what,

1010
01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:10.320
but still want her to have fun and have no interest in dating a man.

1011
01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.810
But I have no interest in dating man.
Any good idea?

1012
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.590
Maybe the lovely Nia could yell at me and set me straight.
You really?
Yeah,

1013
01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.690
totally.
I'd have a reputation here.
You're going to,

1014
01:03:18.691 --> 01:03:21.860
you're going to fucking get it.
You're hey.
Oh.

1015
01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.720
Aren't you the fucking authority on everything?
Get off you.
Oh,

1016
01:03:24.721 --> 01:03:28.140
you're going to get it.
Shut up,
Nia.
No,
I will not set up.

1017
01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:30.270
This guy needs to shut up because,
oh,

1018
01:03:30.271 --> 01:03:33.330
you feel on a certain kind of way because your girlfriend is,
you know,

1019
01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:38.040
growing without you and you still want to lie around and be a tub of shit.
No,

1020
01:03:38.041 --> 01:03:42.750
I'm just kidding.
Yeah,
that's completely inaccurate.
Uh,
I know,
uh,
I know,

1021
01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:46.740
we know somebody that has done bikini fitness,
a female,

1022
01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:49.170
and she doesn't look like a dude at all.

1023
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:53.880
There are the girls that are due really the steroids shit,
which is,
yeah,
that's,

1024
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:56.030
that's,
that's not a good luck.
Um,

1025
01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:00.090
and then there the girls who are do the natural,
uh,
thing,

1026
01:04:00.091 --> 01:04:01.800
there's different like categories of it,

1027
01:04:01.801 --> 01:04:05.430
but they're like the natural girls and then they're the ones that look like

1028
01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:08.970
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Like circa 1983 is the,

1029
01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.750
that obviously you don't want that.
I totally get that.
I wouldn't,
you know,

1030
01:04:12.751 --> 01:04:17.100
if a girlfriend was going in that direction,
that'd be like,
ah,
no.
So of course,

1031
01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.650
but yeah,
she's getting in shape and she really loves it now.

1032
01:04:19.651 --> 01:04:22.980
She's not going to want to go out drinking.
She's not going to want to go out.

1033
01:04:22.981 --> 01:04:25.920
Like that's kind of just part of it.
Then they don't drink water,

1034
01:04:25.921 --> 01:04:29.550
so it sucks everything up right before the,
the thing.

1035
01:04:29.551 --> 01:04:33.660
And then they go out and they paint themselves brown and then they go out there

1036
01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:36.540
and they got literally the show shredded.

1037
01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:39.540
They had like veins coming out of where their Bush should be.

1038
01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.990
Mckeany she's not going to end up looking like a dude.

1039
01:04:42.991 --> 01:04:45.990
I really don't think that that's a real fear that you have.

1040
01:04:45.991 --> 01:04:49.050
So you really need to stop it with that like a fucking break.

1041
01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:51.930
Like just know that when you're lifting weights all of a sudden she's going to

1042
01:04:51.931 --> 01:04:55.740
be low.
Who saw up like she has to keep the long hair though.

1043
01:04:56.310 --> 01:05:00.900
She has to keep the long hair because eventually if she competition.
Okay.

1044
01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:05.310
Alright.
Cause all I'm saying is eventually if she keeps working out,

1045
01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:09.300
her ass is going to feel like an elbow and if she has the short hair,

1046
01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:13.590
you could really feel like wink,
I'll back off.
Well that's the last thing.

1047
01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:15.360
She's not going to end up looking like a dude.

1048
01:05:15.361 --> 01:05:18.210
You're just getting insecure because like you said,
the dude's

1049
01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:18.871
<v 7>in the weight room.</v>

1050
01:05:18.871 --> 01:05:22.290
We're starting to talk to her and so when you're trying to deal with that by

1051
01:05:22.291 --> 01:05:26.360
being like I don't want to Vulcan data man.
Okay,
calm down sweetie.
Yeah,

1052
01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:31.440
but you know something on the other side though herself,
he cares about her.

1053
01:05:31.441 --> 01:05:34.190
He was worried he's going to lose her.
You've been a dose storm,
right?
No.

1054
01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.680
He's being a Douche by being like,
I don't want to date a guy if I wanted that.

1055
01:05:37.681 --> 01:05:40.080
I switched teams like throwing that ridiculous shit in there.

1056
01:05:40.081 --> 01:05:41.130
I just come out with it.

1057
01:05:41.131 --> 01:05:44.550
Just say you're feeling insecure because she's looking better than ever and

1058
01:05:44.551 --> 01:05:49.551
these meathead dudes I could probably rescue you are now talking to me and I pay

1059
01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:52.770
on a certain kind of way.
That's exactly what's going on.

1060
01:05:53.030 --> 01:05:54.920
<v 2>You don't need it.
If you want people to hear your point,</v>

1061
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:56.600
you can't shit on him like that.

1062
01:05:57.150 --> 01:06:01.900
<v 7>I'm sorry,
did you just tell me that?
Yeah.
Cause that's what you do.
Yeah.
But no,</v>

1063
01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.230
no,
the shits on everybody,
Bro.

1064
01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:09.790
<v 2>What?
I want somebody here my point.
Okay,
well maybe I do.
Oh,
I'm just saying,</v>

1065
01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:11.200
well maybe I can fucking hear it from you,

1066
01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:15.280
but I can tell you this and yet there is a certain point we're woman gets in

1067
01:06:15.281 --> 01:06:19.410
such ridiculous shape.
You,
you lose a lot of the femininity.

1068
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:22.060
How would have you say that fucking word.
Okay.
Yeah.

1069
01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:25.800
You want to take a little softening.
I understand something a whole lot too.
Yeah.

1070
01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:29.890
And I know you don't want to feel like you're cradling your buddy in a foxhole

1071
01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.890
trying to fucking hold your breath during the mustard gas.

1072
01:06:32.891 --> 01:06:35.350
That kind of makes all willy take a fucking vacation.

1073
01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:38.380
<v 7>Well,
it has.
I mean that's the thing though.</v>

1074
01:06:38.381 --> 01:06:42.490
It has she even gotten to that point or is he just like freaking out?

1075
01:06:42.491 --> 01:06:46.510
She's going to do the competitions.
Yeah,
but as,
as I said in the beginning,

1076
01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:51.520
there are competitions where you got more of a natural ally of his feelings.

1077
01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:56.730
I validate his feelings if he just be honest with his feelings and stop the

1078
01:06:57.050 --> 01:07:00.070
official reasons.
Okay.
I could use some advice.

1079
01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:04.900
He had a sense of humor maybe can yell at,
yeah,
he's being funny.

1080
01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:09.820
Okay.
Well I'm,
I'm a little playfulness there.
Okay.
All right.
Geez.

1081
01:07:09.821 --> 01:07:13.080
Slowly getting all upset about it.
Why are you getting all,

1082
01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.220
cause I want some closet space to

1083
01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:23.380
this part of the team is all about men feeling emasculated and how you need to

1084
01:07:23.381 --> 01:07:24.490
get the fuck over it.

1085
01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:28.280
<v 2>Yeah.
Look at that.
See that what it was,</v>

1086
01:07:28.281 --> 01:07:31.390
what I've always said about women point at me,
I'm pointing right at you.

1087
01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.210
Everything that you guys don't want us to do to you.

1088
01:07:35.211 --> 01:07:38.720
You guys do to us in a fucking heartbeat and you don't even see it because we

1089
01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:41.870
can beat the shit out of you so you don't fucking see.
You don't see the uh,

1090
01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:45.580
the humanity in us.
Why don't you cute you doing that,
right?
Woo Hoo,

1091
01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:46.990
<v 7>hoo.
Hook.
Can you add,</v>

1092
01:07:46.991 --> 01:07:50.830
can we make that some sort of sound effect that I can hit every time you're
like,

1093
01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:55.020
we've guys do what?
You guys are like this,
but what do you do it?
It's point.

1094
01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:57.400
I'm going to hit a button.
Have you go,
Ooh,

1095
01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:02.470
cause that's exactly what you are good.
And how can I do that?
Back to,
you know,

1096
01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:06.040
you see again,
you're always like,
yeah,
see cause this and this.

1097
01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:11.041
It's like I have never seen who I feel like I don't want to go stick your face.

1098
01:08:12.251 --> 01:08:16.210
I don't want to,
I don't want to give ratio but do it.
I swear to God,

1099
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:21.240
fucking straight white men love trying to keep score about shit.
It's like say,

1100
01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:24.700
well you guys do this,
we can't do this.
But then that and that,

1101
01:08:24.701 --> 01:08:28.390
it's like you guys are as fighting so hard to maintain the status quo.

1102
01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.010
It's actually laughable.

1103
01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:34.360
The kind of ridiculous things that'll come out of your mouth in order to like

1104
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:38.950
keep things the way they used to pay back when this goddamn country meant

1105
01:08:38.951 --> 01:08:41.140
something and stood some fun for something.

1106
01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:45.730
I'm literally talking about closet space and you turn me into some guy in

1107
01:08:45.731 --> 01:08:49.570
Mississippi burning,
you know something.

1108
01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:53.650
What you just fucking did that whole ridiculous thing at this status quo.

1109
01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:56.860
What am I an 80 year old Republican,
do you think?

1110
01:08:56.861 --> 01:08:59.950
I honestly have meetings with my other white male straight friends.

1111
01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:04.420
Wait a talk about the status quo and how to maintain,
how to maintain it.

1112
01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:08.370
This country is getting over run with the ones,
the Fab it is that,

1113
01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:12.430
you know what it is?
The women who liked to lift weights and they're not,

1114
01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:14.220
they're not a woman anymore.
God dammit.

1115
01:09:14.230 --> 01:09:17.360
Put a skirt on and get back in the kitchen.
Yeah.

1116
01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:22.600
And you know what's funny is you can fucking sit there and go off on all these

1117
01:09:22.601 --> 01:09:26.800
man boys with their fucking hoodies who are in their thirties and talk all

1118
01:09:26.801 --> 01:09:30.670
awkward in that Shit.
How you're fucking over there.
Come on.
Come on.
You.

1119
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:33.520
You know what it is the,
yeah.
You don't,
you,
you don't have a,

1120
01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:37.060
you don't have an ability to step outside yourself and just see how ridiculous

1121
01:09:37.061 --> 01:09:39.520
and dumb you really are.
Is that what,

1122
01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:43.930
you're not a smart person and nobody likes you.
All right,

1123
01:09:43.931 --> 01:09:47.110
let's move to the next one as though things like category fish tanks.

1124
01:09:47.170 --> 01:09:50.920
Did we even answer this thing?
Uh,
well,
why don't you answer?

1125
01:09:50.921 --> 01:09:53.890
I would answer it this way.
All right.
You got it.

1126
01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:56.320
She's going to be in great shape,
which is a good thing.

1127
01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:01.480
It's better than Dayton of fatty.
Uh,
sorry.
Um,

1128
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.100
<v 3>okay.</v>

1129
01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:05.470
<v 7>This is the deal.
I shouldn't have said that.
That was extra mean.</v>

1130
01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.570
I didn't mean that,
but uh,

1131
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:14.050
she's only going to be in that gross shape the few days before the competition

1132
01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:20.000
was,
she's completely fucking emaciated and actually doing damage,

1133
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:24.860
more damage than good to her body,
depriving her vitals of water.

1134
01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:26.653
Um,

1135
01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:31.700
and that awful fucking 10 and no,
it's gross.

1136
01:10:31.701 --> 01:10:35.870
If you seen him go out there,
they look fucking the reason.
First of all,

1137
01:10:35.871 --> 01:10:39.470
they look,
you know what they look,
I talked about they look several raceless.

1138
01:10:39.471 --> 01:10:40.550
You want to play the race card?

1139
01:10:40.551 --> 01:10:44.060
They look raceless like I'll look that terrible shade of Brown.
No,
they,

1140
01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:47.480
they look like a,
what's that fucking dead meat that you eat?

1141
01:10:47.481 --> 01:10:50.240
You go and you buy a big stick of it.
It's not even Brown.

1142
01:10:50.241 --> 01:10:53.000
It's Orange at seven 11.
Beef Jerky,

1143
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:57.620
Slim Jim beef jerky was a race.
That's what they look like.
Slim Jim.
Yeah.

1144
01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:01.280
Stammer do are slim Jim.
But like I said,
there's Def,

1145
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:05.030
there's several different kinds of categories of those fitness competitions for

1146
01:11:05.031 --> 01:11:09.910
women.
It's not all like Schwarzenegger style,
so it's just,
yeah,

1147
01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:14.040
I dunno.
Sorry,
I gave him my opinion already.
Yes.
Guys don't know I'm a normal

1148
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.160
<v 0>guy.
Was your senator.
No guy ever goes a god.
Geez.</v>

1149
01:11:17.161 --> 01:11:21.510
You see the biceps on that chick is like that though.
They liked that.

1150
01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:26.070
Really like worked out ABS popping.
Listen,
guns blazing.

1151
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:30.290
Can I tell you something?
This somebody out there fucking a rug.
Okay.

1152
01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.850
You can pick up anything in the fucking world is something that's,

1153
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:34.860
look at the fan over there.

1154
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.920
There's probably some guy that likes to jerk off in front of it and feel the

1155
01:11:37.921 --> 01:11:41.330
wind oscillating.
Yeah.

1156
01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:43.560
There's somebody into everything that,

1157
01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:49.050
I'm just trying to be the white guy.
He just painted me to be all right.

1158
01:11:49.051 --> 01:11:52.140
Fish tanks.
Dear Barnacle Billy.

1159
01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:56.880
My very clever with the CRM.
I have my,
this is smart.

1160
01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:02.480
My friend just spent 1000 bucks on this crazy fish tank and exotic fish to go

1161
01:12:03.211 --> 01:12:07.590
with it.
Yeah.
Yeah,
to each his own,
but what's the call here?

1162
01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:13.620
That's an absolute waste of money.
It's not like he's,

1163
01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:17.610
he has an awesome apartment that it fits in with the decor.

1164
01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.870
On the other hand,

1165
01:12:18.930 --> 01:12:22.320
that goes to prove he might have an honest passion for fish tanks.

1166
01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:26.760
I don't know how to now.
I don't know how to feel.
Please give me your thoughts.

1167
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:30.720
Come back to Seattle.
So yeah,

1168
01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:32.040
he sounds like a pothead.

1169
01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:36.720
I like how this is as bothering him enough that he's got to write you about it.

1170
01:12:36.721 --> 01:12:39.870
I'm like,
what the fuck?
It doesn't die.
You're living in this shit hole.

1171
01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.330
You got this thousand.
Yeah.
So there's that was going to say,

1172
01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:46.650
it's not like it was an awesome apartment that fits in with the decor,
eh.

1173
01:12:46.651 --> 01:12:48.330
You know,
on the other hand goes to vice,

1174
01:12:48.450 --> 01:12:52.710
he might have been on his passion for fish tanks.
I think he covered the topic.

1175
01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:56.820
Yeah,
he just likes me.
You know what?
Fish in the like,

1176
01:12:56.821 --> 01:13:00.760
aquariums are very like calming to some people.
So it might be like,
oh,

1177
01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:03.090
why are you making,
why are you making that noise?

1178
01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:07.350
Because that's that fucking like somebody said that,

1179
01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:12.030
and I've never heard a doctor say that.
I've heard that repeated.
Yeah.

1180
01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:15.930
Someone who left the doctor to say what soothes do you are not in order to make

1181
01:13:15.931 --> 01:13:19.170
it legitimate,
they're the ones that know how to take your blood pressure.

1182
01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:22.500
You're right,
so they would actually know.
Okay.

1183
01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:27.360
How do you know that that didn't come from the aquarium industry and when fish

1184
01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:32.420
fell out of favor around 72 73 fill out of faith and people stop getting

1185
01:13:32.971 --> 01:13:35.490
aquariums.
Did you ever hear that?

1186
01:13:35.491 --> 01:13:40.440
That rumor that JC Morgan had like an octopus or something like that or if what?

1187
01:13:40.570 --> 01:13:43.500
I've seen a,
I've seen video of it.
No,
he has like sharks and shit.

1188
01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:49.110
That's kind of cool.
No,
he doesn't.
He doesn't have to take the little fishies.

1189
01:13:49.111 --> 01:13:51.150
He doesn't have to take his kids to the aquarium.

1190
01:13:51.151 --> 01:13:52.870
He just takes them to the living room.
Right.

1191
01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:59.460
There's no charge style or nothing like he could charge money for his aquarium.

1192
01:13:59.970 --> 01:14:03.690
I think I heard somebody was saying that maybe he was going to get a uh,

1193
01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:07.350
an octopus.
I have no idea.

1194
01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:11.130
I'm just happy that he's still around and can make that decision to be honest.

1195
01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:12.300
You,
I'm looking forward

1196
01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:13.560
<v 2>to when he gets back to the clubs,</v>

1197
01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:16.830
it seems like buying fish is a pretty harmless a habit.

1198
01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:20.200
It can be a little like what the fuck now if you've got someone living in this

1199
01:14:20.201 --> 01:14:23.280
shithole apartment and the spinning out some dollars off fit,

1200
01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:25.110
that's fucking ridiculous.

1201
01:14:25.150 --> 01:14:28.710
You know when I was a kid my dad could be worst thing my dad used to,
we used to,

1202
01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:31.320
we used to have Puranas.
Oh you did?
Yeah,

1203
01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:34.050
we used to call him and it was always the same name Charlie.

1204
01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:38.910
We had the Borana Charlie and you'd throw the goldfish in and he would just

1205
01:14:38.911 --> 01:14:40.380
destroy them.
Oh my God.

1206
01:14:40.381 --> 01:14:43.320
So much stuff is doing it make sense and that he would eat like you'd put in

1207
01:14:43.321 --> 01:14:46.530
like I remember one time we put like the whole bagging.

1208
01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:52.410
You've never told me that you own Paranas and that you five photos with like we

1209
01:14:54.061 --> 01:14:57.330
had a Purana that my dad had another thing,
another tank,

1210
01:14:57.331 --> 01:14:59.310
it was called an Air Awana.
I swear to God.

1211
01:14:59.311 --> 01:15:03.660
And it was this eel looking like fish and that thing used to also eat fish and

1212
01:15:03.661 --> 01:15:06.800
it would just call it like just fucking like lash out or grab him.

1213
01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:10.200
And one time the fish was too big and it kept hitting it and hitting it and

1214
01:15:10.201 --> 01:15:13.770
hitting it and we were all sitting there laughing cause we thought it was funny.

1215
01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.560
Then afterwards we started feeling bad for the fish so my dad reached in,

1216
01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:19.410
took it out and brought over to the counter and took a knife and cut its head

1217
01:15:19.411 --> 01:15:23.580
off and then throw it back in a tank.
And that's my childhood.
Once again,

1218
01:15:23.730 --> 01:15:26.100
so many things is becoming,
oh stop it.

1219
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:33.070
<v 7>And someday when the shit hits the fan and the food supply ads and you can't cut</v>

1220
01:15:33.591 --> 01:15:36.820
the fish off dead head cut the fish off.
They kept the head.

1221
01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:41.060
I think I have dyslexia.
Do I?
I mean I can't read,

1222
01:15:41.210 --> 01:15:44.840
I can't even speak.
No it's not that.
You know what it is?

1223
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:47.390
Cut the fish off the head.
It's your add.

1224
01:15:47.391 --> 01:15:52.160
Your brain moves faster than your mouth and like I know somewhere in there is an

1225
01:15:52.161 --> 01:15:55.670
insult.
You,
you kind of skimming things it because you're already,

1226
01:15:55.671 --> 01:15:58.580
you want to be like down here or when you're up here.

1227
01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:03.600
Is there a lady I told you.
Okay.
Get it under control.

1228
01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:08.380
How can you just fuck and diagnosed me?
I'm right though.
Remember when,

1229
01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.850
remember when Y'all done adult ADHD quiz?
I made you take that quiz.

1230
01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:18.650
I crushed that quiz.
I got every answer right.
Crushed it by being like,
yes,

1231
01:16:18.651 --> 01:16:20.150
you have 80 hates Dave.

1232
01:16:20.151 --> 01:16:25.151
We recommend you to like see somebody click on this link and Adam and Adam and

1233
01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:29.540
Adam Levine is sitting there like,
Hey,
I also have ADHD,

1234
01:16:29.570 --> 01:16:33.410
but that didn't prevent me from being a huge asshole rockstar.

1235
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:37.280
Why don't you like him?
I like him and turned on that guy.

1236
01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:40.850
You loved him when he first came out.
I liked him,
Huh?
Yeah.

1237
01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:46.010
I told like Maroon five.
I did like it,
but at the more he started talking,

1238
01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:48.200
the more,
the less I liked him,
but I do like,

1239
01:16:48.230 --> 01:16:50.300
well maybe if he didn't steal his fucking music,

1240
01:16:50.301 --> 01:16:53.450
he could just be out in the road doing that instead of spinning around in a lazy

1241
01:16:53.451 --> 01:16:58.190
boy going,
I want to put you on my team to sing row,
row,
row your boat.
All right.

1242
01:16:58.191 --> 01:17:01.730
Hot Dogs.
Everybody 20 of money in [inaudible] five,

1243
01:17:01.731 --> 01:17:05.390
and he wants to be a bigger star.
That's why he's on the voice.

1244
01:17:05.391 --> 01:17:09.500
That's why he's shilling ADHD medication.
You don't know.
You're right.

1245
01:17:09.501 --> 01:17:10.070
I don't know.

1246
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:12.760
<v 0>Hot Dogs.
Bill,
my girlfriend,
uh,</v>

1247
01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:19.310
it's grossed out by hat.
I was wondering why he didn't go Billy Frankfurt to uh,

1248
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:21.990
my girlfriend has grossed out by hot dog.

1249
01:17:21.991 --> 01:17:25.420
She says they're made of gross parts of many animals.
She's right.

1250
01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:29.060
I told her I would get it.
You agree with the women on this?

1251
01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:34.100
I told her I'm aware which is,
which is why I only eat like 12 a year.

1252
01:17:36.670 --> 01:17:41.420
Hey,
if you did coke once a month,
you wouldn't have a problem.
That's true.
See,

1253
01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:46.150
we're not encouraging people to do,
but if you are just do it once a month,

1254
01:17:46.410 --> 01:17:50.720
once a month,
which isn't that much,
uh,
a coop at a time,

1255
01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:56.400
that ball and he's supposedly a couple at a time and only at BBQs BBQs and my

1256
01:17:57.110 --> 01:18:01.160
crazy that I think this guy might be black.
Why Barbecue?

1257
01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:04.460
You put coop,
you know,
like Coupe Deville basically.

1258
01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:08.540
Now you're saying that because this is a Cadillac driving hot dog eating

1259
01:18:08.541 --> 01:18:10.670
barbecue,
eating black guy.
That's what I'm guessing.

1260
01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:15.000
So she says she won't kiss me for hours after eating one.

1261
01:18:15.001 --> 01:18:18.080
So I told her I won't kiss her for hours after drinking coffee.

1262
01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:22.790
And let me tell you bill,
she drinks a good amount of coffee side I do here.

1263
01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:24.710
Um,
awful.

1264
01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:29.630
You turned into the unaccepted skid not,

1265
01:18:29.631 --> 01:18:32.330
you didn't turn into it.
You made it worse.
You'd be like,
Oh,

1266
01:18:32.331 --> 01:18:33.290
you're going to be a Douche.

1267
01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.500
I'll be even a bigger Dushan now you guys aren't going to be kissing

1268
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:39.890
you guys to fight about.
Yeah,

1269
01:18:39.891 --> 01:18:43.250
she's going to bang the guy at the coffee truck and a,

1270
01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:45.590
you're gonna fuck a girl in the bleachers.

1271
01:18:45.650 --> 01:18:49.820
I really love how he eats hot dog so much that his girlfriend is like,

1272
01:18:49.821 --> 01:18:54.790
I will refuse to kiss you because he eats that many fucking hot dogs that it's

1273
01:18:54.791 --> 01:18:58.580
an actual issue.
Listen,
I understand why you eat them.

1274
01:18:58.581 --> 01:19:02.270
And I also understand that she doesn't want to kiss the after breath of a pig's

1275
01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:05.390
ass hole.
Yeah,
that's a good point.
I mean,

1276
01:19:05.391 --> 01:19:07.520
I would never not kiss you because you're in a hot dog.

1277
01:19:07.521 --> 01:19:11.030
That's a little extreme for sure.
Oh,
and by the way,
coffee,
breath,
coffee,
breath,

1278
01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:15.950
coffee.
Fucking discuss the worst than hot dog breath.
It is Ryan.

1279
01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:20.540
I think they should put coffee in the water that they have.
Hotdogs in.
Coffee,

1280
01:19:20.541 --> 01:19:25.070
dogs,
coffee,
Doug's dark coffee.
Uh,
coffee.

1281
01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:29.600
Either way.
It's dumb of you guys to be writing about this.
So yeah,

1282
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:34.460
as you guys should be a more mature couple of like myself and leave.
All Right,

1283
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:38.810
book suggestion.
Billy Shakespeare.
Eh,
that's good.
That's another good one.

1284
01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:43.220
I'm catching up on old podcast and heard you talk about World War II books.

1285
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:47.810
There was,
that was a year ago.
Read anything good lately.
Also.
What magazine,

1286
01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:53.180
What magazine Pique your interest piqued your interest.
Um,
he wrote peak.

1287
01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:57.900
Was he asking about dirty magazines there?
Um,
yeah,

1288
01:19:57.901 --> 01:19:59.030
I was in a world war two books.

1289
01:19:59.031 --> 01:20:02.510
I was a year ago and I was into that for like a month and then La and my brain

1290
01:20:02.511 --> 01:20:04.970
goes over here.
So recently,
what did I do?

1291
01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.100
I don't know what I've been reading about.
And,
uh,

1292
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:10.690
<v 7>I don't fucking know.
I,</v>

1293
01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:13.060
I go through periods of reading and not reading it right now.

1294
01:20:13.061 --> 01:20:16.090
I haven't been reading you read drum magazines though.

1295
01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:20.200
Those are the magazines and uh,
that you read a lot and rolling stone.

1296
01:20:21.070 --> 01:20:24.820
I read rolling stone.
Yes I do.
Even though you fucking shit on that magazine.

1297
01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:30.680
I just,
I believe you said it was wack.
I said that awhile ago.

1298
01:20:30.710 --> 01:20:33.020
I actually,
I I like reading rolling stone.

1299
01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:36.800
I rather read about the real life stuff than the celebrity interviews.

1300
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:40.580
I just feel like the celebrity interviews of like not as,

1301
01:20:40.581 --> 01:20:44.300
not as great as they used to be,
but I love reading about,
I mean very real stuff,

1302
01:20:44.301 --> 01:20:48.250
but they're in the music soldiers with like PTSD and like any kind of like

1303
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:49.700
Internet business thing.

1304
01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:54.710
There was an article about these two people that met on vine and started like

1305
01:20:54.711 --> 01:20:56.210
courting each other on vine.

1306
01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:00.020
They met in real life and of course it didn't really work because you,

1307
01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:03.530
you're in a relationship with somebody online,
you don't really know them.

1308
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:07.310
And things went south and she accused him of rape and it was just this whole

1309
01:21:07.311 --> 01:21:11.620
fucking terrible situation.
Blame that on vine.

1310
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:16.480
I was showing me showing a bar back in the day where you don't really know that

1311
01:21:16.481 --> 01:21:20.230
either.
I know,
but you at least met them in real life.

1312
01:21:20.231 --> 01:21:24.400
I blame people who have relationships with people online for six months that

1313
01:21:24.401 --> 01:21:25.840
they've never met in real life.

1314
01:21:25.841 --> 01:21:29.860
That's a very different situation than being in the same way.
10 years.
You have.

1315
01:21:29.861 --> 01:21:33.820
You haven't.
You haven't met the real me yet,
man.
Alright,
dilemma.
Bill,

1316
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:38.250
Bill and Nia,
if she's around.
Oh she is definitely around this time around.

1317
01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:42.790
Imagine you're in a perfect relationship.
I don't have to imagine it.

1318
01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:44.230
I'm living it.
Jesus.

1319
01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:48.250
Nobody believes that one of your sheets,

1320
01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:50.650
one of you cheats and it's over.

1321
01:21:51.250 --> 01:21:54.070
Would you rather be the one who cheated so you,

1322
01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:59.580
so your image of the other is always perfect or be the one who got cheated on so

1323
01:22:01.481 --> 01:22:04.720
you can have pride in the fact that you are a good person.
Rough question.

1324
01:22:04.721 --> 01:22:08.470
If you immerse yourself in the ideas of both for your own fucking amusement.

1325
01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:13.480
Terrible question.
I'm not now I'm not answering that.
That's stupid.
All right,

1326
01:22:13.481 --> 01:22:18.000
well let's just,
we got to do a dilemma.
All right.
If,
um,

1327
01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.200
we were in a plane crash

1328
01:22:21.850 --> 01:22:24.700
and we're in snowy mountains.

1329
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:28.990
I know you don't like the cold.
No.
Would you read that?

1330
01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:33.370
Rather would you rather that I lived and I AAU

1331
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:37.900
or you lived and you ate me?

1332
01:22:38.050 --> 01:22:41.740
Now we're the only ones on this brain that it's come to that.

1333
01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:45.740
So here we go.
We can't eat the pilot and the stewardess,

1334
01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:49.480
the as and the other paths.
We were in a very small plane.
Oh,
I see.

1335
01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:52.640
Um,

1336
01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:59.980
white meats better for you than dark meat.
Excuse me.
Dark meat tastes better.

1337
01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:01.480
Um,

1338
01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:08.500
I could not eating you.
I want to do that.
What?

1339
01:23:09.690 --> 01:23:10.880
<v 0>I'm going to tell you this right now.
Well,</v>

1340
01:23:10.890 --> 01:23:12.660
the way you've handled closets in here,

1341
01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:16.620
that's not even a life and death fucking situation.
He would totally be like,

1342
01:23:16.621 --> 01:23:20.850
by BB,
you know what you do?

1343
01:23:21.090 --> 01:23:25.740
I'd be sitting there like still kind of conscious and you do what Tony Soprano

1344
01:23:25.741 --> 01:23:28.770
did.
The Christopher,
you just reach over and pinch my nose.

1345
01:23:32.210 --> 01:23:36.830
<v 7>Broke my heart when I saw that scene.
Oh my God.
Oh,</v>

1346
01:23:36.831 --> 01:23:38.180
that was horrifying.

1347
01:23:42.010 --> 01:23:46.910
I,
oh,
that was terrible.
That and Adriana hurt me the worst on that shelf.

1348
01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:48.890
God,
I fucking love that show so much.

1349
01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:53.210
Remember there was a time where I was watching like every episode on demand,

1350
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:58.130
like every day,
cause I had just went back.
I was obsessed with my sopranos.

1351
01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:01.680
I just love the fun.
I loved that period of time.

1352
01:24:03.190 --> 01:24:07.230
Yeah,
that was a great period in your TV watching you kind of gone down hill.

1353
01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:11.240
Yeah.
You have peaks and valleys and right now you are,
you're a,

1354
01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:15.750
I'm watching a good TV on Netflix and I'm watching the bad TV on actual tea.

1355
01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:20.630
Yeah.
Well that's going to stop when football season starts.
By the way,

1356
01:24:20.730 --> 01:24:25.580
that's less than a couple of weeks of college football.
Pro Football.
Oh boy.

1357
01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:30.650
Hey fern,
lung Quist,
SCC football.

1358
01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:32.750
I don't know what any of those words mean.

1359
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:38.480
<v 0>All right.
Well,
it's,
it means a lot to me.
It's exciting.
All right,
everybody,</v>

1360
01:24:38.481 --> 01:24:43.370
that's the podcast for this week.
Um,
I got an,

1361
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:48.040
I thought I had odd ball dates this week,
but I'm,

1362
01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:50.150
I'm definitely doing the Jones beach one,

1363
01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:55.151
but I don't know what's going on with Virginia ticket sales are run not where

1364
01:24:55.401 --> 01:24:58.340
they need to be.
This is not my call.

1365
01:24:59.030 --> 01:25:01.820
So we'd either might happen or it might not happen.

1366
01:25:03.170 --> 01:25:05.210
I don't know what's going on with Virginia.

1367
01:25:05.330 --> 01:25:09.770
We thought that you guys liked comedy will thanks a lot everybody.

1368
01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:13.250
Virginia is for lovers.
It's not for comedians.

1369
01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:17.330
That's right now for psycho comics.
Um,
all right.
That's it.

1370
01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:19.270
<v 7>Yay.</v>

1371
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:23.560
<v 0>Um,
that's a podcast.
Everybody go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.</v>

1372
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:26.530
Thank you for listening.
Bye.
Bye.
