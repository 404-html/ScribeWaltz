1
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.550
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.551 --> 00:00:05.730
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday.

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.240
Um,
May 20th.
Yeah,

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.960
May 20th kip people keep it going from May 20th.
Come on.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.880
Isn't she lovely?
May 20th,
2013 on the other.
How are Ya,

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.630
you don't want to right there.
Huh?
You do want to write with the twinkle toes?

7
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.930
Um,
I'm kind of in a fucked up mood.
Why?

8
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.060
We just got back.
I was on the road,

9
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:37.610
the lovely Nia for the last fucking 10 days and I was really nervous about that.

10
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:41.280
The whole thing,
like 10 straight days,
24 fucking seven,
basically.

11
00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:45.810
Other than when I was on stage running my Goddamn Yep.
She was going to be a,

12
00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:50.220
at my side,
I was like a,
you know,
this is going to be bad.
We only had one,

13
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.180
one major fight,
one major.
Like go fuck yourself.

14
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.430
I'm going to go become a sea captain.
You'll be Google being astronauts.

15
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.780
So we could be as far away from each other as possible and only at one of those

16
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.850
only had one.
Um,

17
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.280
so we just got back to California and we'd know taped all these shows and shit,

18
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:11.330
and she was watching one and they just showed some fucking jog.

19
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.470
Some jogger got mauled to death by a pack of pit bulls.

20
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.920
So then I look up the story and it says it has been like five deadly attacks by

21
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:26.700
dogs in California in the last whatever year,
year and a half.

22
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:31.560
And all of them were pit bulls.
Okay.
So I go to Nia,
I go,
you know,

23
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:36.000
what exactly do we have on our hands here?
And she's like,
well,

24
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:39.440
I think there were different kinds of owners.
And I said,
okay,

25
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.230
ah,
fuck me.
What do I do?

26
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.430
What do you do when you're in love with a monster?
No,
it's not a monster.

27
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.930
It can be.
It's kind of like a gun in the wrong hands.
Is that what it is?

28
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.210
I don't know what it is,
but it fucking really made me,
they'd be nervous.

29
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.130
Really fucking made me nervous.
It's kind of a creepy way to start the podcast,

30
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:07.860
isn't it?
I usually come on,
I sing a song or something.
Right?

31
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.320
The summerwind little Vegas action came,

32
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:14.010
blow it in from across the sea.

33
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.910
You wore Nike flip flops with dark black socks down to the casino floor.

34
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.270
But since the mob has left and it's a bunch of corporate cons,

35
00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:32.271
you can get away with that Fashion Shit Bato bought are bought up a dope.

36
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.370
I don't like your white trash tattooed flabby arms.

37
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.270
Sorry,
I was just singing about what you seen.

38
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.540
You know people who go to Vegas.
Can you do me a favor?

39
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:50.830
Can you dress up a little bit?
You fucking pieces of shit.

40
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.300
Any I was going to say and you know who you are.
All right.

41
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.010
They don't know who they are.

42
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.780
These fucking guys who come downstairs like a Basketball Jersey on right?

43
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.040
No fucking shirt underneath it.
Sitting there looking at the,
the,

44
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:10.180
the beginning or ending depending on which way you're looking at their back of

45
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:11.350
their back acne.

46
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.850
You know they got the shoulder zits shorts,
right?

47
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.360
Flip flops,
dark fucking black socks.
Just standing there.

48
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.280
I mean,
you know,
back in the day when the mob ran it,

49
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.080
if you didn't come downstairs with a college shirt on looking like a God damn

50
00:03:30.081 --> 00:03:34.280
adult,
they sent you back to your room and they said,
hey look,

51
00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:37.400
I'm make smitten with you.
Say get it out.

52
00:03:37.401 --> 00:03:40.610
And he can't get no fucking right.

53
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.100
They sent you back to your fucking room and you came down.

54
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.310
All right looking like a gentlemen.

55
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.240
Ladies looked like ladies in the who is dressed like who was all right and if

56
00:03:53.361 --> 00:03:57.740
you were some fucking piece of shit,
they just throw you out.

57
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.280
You know,
how much money do we need to make?

58
00:04:01.281 --> 00:04:03.050
Do we need to make so much fucking money?

59
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.760
We were going to allow this fucking jerk off to be standing there like this.

60
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.750
It was unbelievable.
You know,
everybody,
you know,
it's just eat.

61
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.890
There was so many people dress nicely,
ah fuck,
don't do this to me.

62
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.040
Sorry,
little technical difficulties here.

63
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.140
There was so many people dress nicely and all it takes is just somebody like

64
00:04:24.141 --> 00:04:28.790
that to just ruin the family photo and actually took a picture of his flip flops

65
00:04:28.791 --> 00:04:29.601
and his dark socks.

66
00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:33.920
You know what the funny thing was is the horror that was from the ankles down on

67
00:04:33.921 --> 00:04:38.540
this guy actually match the casino rug quite nicely.

68
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.990
I might add,
I don't know if you guys have been to a lot of casinos,

69
00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:46.070
but there's some unwritten rule rule that they have to have zany carpeting.

70
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.953
You know,

71
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.440
I don't know if it puts you in a more festive mood as you're losing all your

72
00:04:51.441 --> 00:04:54.410
fucking money.
I don't know what it is,
but every one of those casinos,

73
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.490
not one of them just has a nice solid color,
you know,
an electric blue,

74
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.590
you know,
a red cap,
whatever,
an earth tone.

75
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.170
None of them,
it's this confetti.

76
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.940
It's like they took all the yarn that was leftover at a factory and they just

77
00:05:10.941 --> 00:05:12.320
sewed the shit together.

78
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:14.623
<v 1>I Dunno.</v>

79
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.610
<v 0>I don't know.</v>

80
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.950
Other than that I had a great time in Vegas other than when I went down to the

81
00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:22.220
pool because I go down to the pool,
I'm down there to me,

82
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.440
it's fucking j law head who's been killing it in front of me.
And uh,

83
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.990
the lovely Nia and her cousins and we're hanging earning cousin.
I mean,

84
00:05:29.991 --> 00:05:33.950
and we're hanging out down the pool and they're doing the usual shit,
you know,

85
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.750
if you're a red head and he'd go down to the pool like you just asking him for

86
00:05:38.751 --> 00:05:43.520
it.
People that all,
look how white you are.
You know?

87
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.670
Like,
I never noticed.
It's like I'm fucking around myself.

88
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.990
I've been around myself since the sixties,
the late sixties.

89
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.960
I know how white I am and if I ever forget how white I am,

90
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.120
there's always somebody there to remind me.

91
00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.200
<v 1>Sorry,</v>

92
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.580
<v 0>I don't know if you've noticed your skin tone.
What am I meditating?</v>

93
00:06:02.581 --> 00:06:06.760
Floating up out of my body.
All right,
so these people are with doe on,

94
00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:09.210
C'mon on in the pool and like,
I don't want to go on the pool.

95
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.930
I don't want to go on the fucking pool.
You know,
they're like,
why?
No,

96
00:06:12.931 --> 00:06:15.850
why don't you want to go to the pool?
You know why?
Because the fucking,

97
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.993
<v 1>yeah,</v>

98
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.290
<v 0>look at,
look at these people,
look at them,
look at them.
And you're get,</v>

99
00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:25.470
you're getting your,
you know,
would you take a bath with all,

100
00:06:25.471 --> 00:06:27.660
with any one of the people that you see here,

101
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.130
these fucking just masses of human beings.

102
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.750
There's not enough chlorine and a fucking pool to kill whatever the fuck they're

103
00:06:36.751 --> 00:06:39.390
dragging in the pool.
You know,
it was like I finally end up going into the pool.

104
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.800
Then everybody made fun of how white my fucking alabaster chest was a da that I

105
00:06:43.801 --> 00:06:48.570
had to stay in the shade of the fucking,
uh,
the lifeguard's chair,

106
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.730
you know,
you know,

107
00:06:53.731 --> 00:06:57.660
I had a show to do,
I'm being a professional,
I can't come out stage later,

108
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.390
half in the bag looking like,
oh,
right.

109
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.090
I got to do my little song and dance later on that night.
So,
anyway,

110
00:07:07.091 --> 00:07:10.320
so I ended up getting in the fucking pool against my,
what I wanted to do,

111
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.650
you know?
And then I get out of the pool.

112
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.410
First of all for my age,

113
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.940
I am an absolutely phenomenal top shelf shape.

114
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.470
All right,
I got to tell you the fucking,

115
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.980
just the deaf fuck the humanity that I saw poolside in Las Vegas,

116
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.640
the fucking humanity.

117
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

118
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.220
<v 0>Keyword manatee.</v>

119
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.170
Not this gap step on a Jim Gaffigan.

120
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.950
I just realized he used to use that reference and I'm pretty sure he used it.

121
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.830
I can't remember how the fuck he used it,

122
00:07:53.831 --> 00:07:58.210
but if he used it to describe a fat Pale Torso,

123
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.990
not really pale board or whatever the fucking shit.
I saw the side of that.

124
00:08:01.991 --> 00:08:06.120
He was dead on that.
Oh my God.

125
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.360
Is there anything worse than seeing a tattoo come of age?
You know?

126
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

127
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.090
<v 0>Jesus Christ.
If you get a tattoo,
you better.</v>

128
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.960
You better just make the mental decision that you're going to [inaudible] for

129
00:08:19.961 --> 00:08:22.450
the rest of your fucking life.
Cause when you don't do it,

130
00:08:22.451 --> 00:08:25.720
I saw this guy down at the pool.
All right,

131
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:26.880
<v 1>okay.</v>

132
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.050
<v 0>He had like not only the worst tattoo you've ever seen in your life,</v>

133
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.740
like the worst placement,
you know what I mean?

134
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.770
Like you get one like on the side of your arm up by your shoulder,

135
00:08:37.771 --> 00:08:40.950
that looks good,
right on the bicep.
That looks good.

136
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.370
You know Joe,
somebody got gets one right over there.

137
00:08:44.371 --> 00:08:48.420
Voicebox like I don't give a fuck what you have surrounding that.

138
00:08:48.421 --> 00:08:52.050
That leads into that part of the,
of the,
of the work or the piece,

139
00:08:52.051 --> 00:08:57.030
whatever they call it.
It looks fucking horrible.
Leg Tattoos,
horrific,

140
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.510
horrific.
So this fucking jerk off.

141
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:06.170
He has basically the exact sorta like tribal thing that the rock has except he

142
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:10.620
doesn't look tribal.
He looks like an accountant,
you know,

143
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.740
and he doesn't work out.

144
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.060
So just imagine if the rock was as pasty as I was

145
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.350
and it never worked down in his life.

146
00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:25.860
But he has that same tattoo that starts at the elbow,
goes up the arm,

147
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:28.620
over the shoulder and covers one whole peck.

148
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:33.780
But the way this guy had it done was it didn't cover his whole packet came

149
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:37.140
swinging in and went right above his,
his men nipple.

150
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.470
So now all of the,
all of that is like colored in.

151
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.820
So because of the pace,
enos of his torso,

152
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.030
your eye is just drawn to his right nipple.

153
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.870
Is he standing in the fucking pool?

154
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.100
My neck was sore from shaking my head at people.
It was,

155
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.970
it was absolutely fucking horrific,
right?
So,
so anyways,

156
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:08.210
um,
I go back up to the,
uh,
I go back up to the hotel room,
right?
You know,

157
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.130
gotta make sure that I'm all shipshape for my God damn show and I put on the

158
00:10:13.131 --> 00:10:16.580
news and what are they ended up doing a story about,

159
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.440
they start doing a story about the amount of,
uh,

160
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.940
fecal matter found in public pools

161
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.030
right after I just got out of a God damn pool.
You know?

162
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.160
And I know people always think,
oh,
stay away from where the kids are.

163
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.670
Stay away from the Kiddie Pool.
Right?
Stay away from there.

164
00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:40.610
They always blame the fucking kids.
Will I,

165
00:10:40.611 --> 00:10:44.720
you know something after seeing what I saw a poolside,
you know,

166
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.070
there weren't a lot of kids in there,

167
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:51.440
but I guarantee you somebody's got a cola.
I know this is fucking disgusting.

168
00:10:51.441 --> 00:10:56.210
But people you've,
you're basically bathing,
you know what's even more fucked up.

169
00:10:56.211 --> 00:11:00.530
His,
his Vegas is just like,
you know,
people fly in from all over the world.

170
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.310
You're taking a fucking aids bath,
you know,

171
00:11:04.311 --> 00:11:07.670
with a shot of fucking,
uh,
what the hell was that shit that came out,

172
00:11:07.671 --> 00:11:10.070
but it killed people so fast that it just burned out.

173
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.690
Everybody just ran into the woods.
The fuck was that shit cold.

174
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.690
Ah,
Christ,
they can't remember a bola.

175
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.790
That's it with a shot of a bola or whatever.

176
00:11:24.791 --> 00:11:27.880
Food poisoning.
I don't know what it is.
A salmon,
Ella shower,

177
00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.090
whatever the fuck you want to call it.
I'm done with public pools.

178
00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:34.330
The only pool that I will ever swim in again is my pool.

179
00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.550
If I ever get one or the pool of some hot chick that I want to fucking bank

180
00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:41.620
cause I have needs permission,
that's the only way it's going to go down.

181
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.460
Other than that,
you know,
I'll just go,
I'll just go take a bath.

182
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.700
That way I'm out of the sun,
you know,
take a couple of vitamin E pills,

183
00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:58.210
whatever the fuck it is you get from the sun.
Other than skin cancer,

184
00:11:58.690 --> 00:11:59.523
I'm done with it.

185
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:05.700
You know what America needs to implement after years and years of calling the

186
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:08.260
French people smelly.
You know?

187
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.100
That's kind of like the thing when we went over to France and saved their ass

188
00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:16.240
for the second time last century.
Oh wait,
did we do it once?
We did it one time,

189
00:12:16.241 --> 00:12:20.540
right?
I can't fucking remember.
You know,

190
00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.980
I thought the Spanish American war took place in Texas.

191
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.320
I thought it was somehow tied in with the Alamo.
I had no fucking idea.

192
00:12:28.321 --> 00:12:29.740
You know why?
Because they never talked about it.

193
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.130
All I talked about was a revolutionary war.

194
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.370
We got right up to about the war of 1812 and that was it.

195
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.100
French and Indian war and then they just stopped.

196
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.450
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

197
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.840
<v 0>You know,
they never,
they never did anything be a civil war we talked about,</v>

198
00:12:42.841 --> 00:12:43.560
but that was it.

199
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.560
Spanish American war as far as what I remember from Wikipedia took place in

200
00:12:48.571 --> 00:12:51.120
like,
I don't know,
Cuba,

201
00:12:51.121 --> 00:12:56.110
Puerto Rico and like Guam.
Figure that one out

202
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.880
some point.
Uh,
you know,
that's one of those books like if I ever have insomnia,

203
00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:05.050
I'm just going to start reading the history of the Spanish American war.

204
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.470
You know,
I didn't realize it was an away game.

205
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.800
I thought that that was in our building.
Evidently it wasn't,

206
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.790
and it was spread out all over hail.
So anyways,

207
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.420
we've always made fun of the French file.
This they smell.

208
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:22.450
If you ever watched a bugs bunny growing up,
man,
you saw pepe Le Pew.

209
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.120
If you noticed he had a French accent,
you know,

210
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.120
that's the kind of shit you couldn't get away with today because of political

211
00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:31.780
correctness.
I guess they were basically saying that you know that they stuck.

212
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:37.140
But I'll tell you one thing that the French have when it comes to hygiene over

213
00:13:37.841 --> 00:13:42.700
Americans.
All right?
Is the big day.
All right?

214
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.180
I can guarantee you if I ever go swimming in a public pool again,

215
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:51.181
it's going to be at Fred's Ellis

216
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.620
is a bunch of Americans.
I know.
I've been over to England.
I never saw it,

217
00:13:54.621 --> 00:13:56.720
but day over there,
you know,

218
00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:02.630
but day is basically a car wash for your asshole Ed.
Uh,

219
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.810
you know,
it leaves you feeling refreshed,

220
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:09.640
puts a fucking smile on your face and evidently had France.

221
00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:12.110
She's so fucking happy.
You forget to put on deodorant,

222
00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.000
but I'll tell you right now,
you can jump in that pool.
I bet they're not dead,

223
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.810
but they're not talking about that shit over there,
right?

224
00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:23.180
You,
what's funny about this?
I am 15 minutes into this podcast.

225
00:14:23.181 --> 00:14:26.660
I just told a 15 minutes,
shit joke.
Do you realize that?

226
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.560
And that can mean only one thing.
It's time for some advertising.

227
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.800
And when we come back from advertising,
everybody,

228
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.570
this is what they call in the business.
A teaser.
Um,

229
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:44.470
if I can figure out how you use this tablet,
oh,
fuck you.
Who's this?

230
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:47.490
<v 1>Okay,</v>

231
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.740

I don't want to hear it.</v>

232
00:14:49.741 --> 00:14:53.240
I don't want to hear what whoever the fuck that to get to the library to.
Oh,

233
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:55.770

234
00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:00.710
I'm going to tell you about meeting Pete rose.

All right,
good Lord.
I have like,

288
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.720
I just really have issues with reading out loud some weeks.
Yes,

289
00:18:25.721 --> 00:18:28.050
some weeks because I've been doing better recently.
Okay.

290
00:18:28.051 --> 00:18:30.510
And I know you console going to give me shit.
Ooh,
Ooh.

291
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:34.400
So we'd sue who do boat every week,
lol,

292
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:38.610
shaking my head.
Oh,
here's another thing for Twitter hack.

293
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:42.900
When people,
when people begin to joke with in other news,

294
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:44.843
you know,

295
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.230
that weekend update staple from 1986 on SNL,

296
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.690
you know,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Blue.
The doodle,

297
00:18:53.691 --> 00:18:56.740
do the doe in other news,
the little bit of a Ba.

298
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.540
All right,
that's your joke,
right in class.

299
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.610
That's probably the worst description ever.
I go fuck yourself.
So anyway,

300
00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:09.300
so I'm walking back to the hotel and I walked by this sports members back in

301
00:19:09.301 --> 00:19:11.220
Vegas,
by the way.
All right.

302
00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:12.700
<v 3>Okay.</v>

303
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.950
<v 0>Are you with me?
We're out of the shit pool.</v>

304
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.280
And now I'm walking through the little mall there and I see this sports

305
00:19:18.281 --> 00:19:20.950
memorabilia place and I see Pete rose is going to be there.

306
00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.560
Like the guy's going to be here in an hour.
I'm like,

307
00:19:23.561 --> 00:19:26.080
I gotta meet this fucking guy that's fucking Pete rose.

308
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.620
And I'm looking at all the baseballs.
He signs.
It's hilarious.
She signs it hits,

309
00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:35.170
uh,
like 4,000,
256 steroids.
Zero.

310
00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:39.580
Pete rose hit king.
I thought that was the shit.
Um,

311
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.620
so anyways,

312
00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.500
I'd seen him signing there before and the line was too long and I didn't feel

313
00:19:44.501 --> 00:19:45.820
like waiting.

314
00:19:45.821 --> 00:19:50.821
So this time me and lie head who doesn't an amazing impression of him breaking

315
00:19:51.461 --> 00:19:54.190
ty cobb's record the entire thing.

316
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.810
Him Standing on first base hit to hitting the ball,
standing on first place,

317
00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:02.800
waving to the crowd,
gradually trying to fight off tears,

318
00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.460
hugging his son and breaking down.
He does the whole fucking thing.

319
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.000
He does it at the rose bowl after cooking a delicious meal.
But anyway,

320
00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:13.360
so I'm hanging out with Tim and you can add,

321
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.510
you buy all this memorabilia and Pete Rose,
we'll uh,
we'll sign it for you.

322
00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:21.520
So they had two photos
and one was Pete rose,

323
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:28.110
like sliding headfirst into third base and the 1975 world series when he beat my

324
00:20:28.781 --> 00:20:29.890
Boston red sox.

325
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:35.370
And another photo that I saw in the collection was Pete rose in the 1976 world

326
00:20:36.161 --> 00:20:39.010
series where they beat the Yankees once again,

327
00:20:39.011 --> 00:20:43.750
sliding headfirst into third base batting helmet.
What?
Who knows where it went?

328
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:48.550
It always flew off.
It seemed between first and second base.
Um,

329
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:52.300
so I'm like,
oh my God,
that's perfect.
I gotta get,
I gotta get both of those,

330
00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:56.860
right.
So my whole thing is I want them to write on the Red Sox won bill,

331
00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.900
I'm sorry,
Pete rose.
And then on the Yankee one bill,
you're welcome,

332
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:06.730
Pete Rose,
right?
So bring it up to him.
Great Guy.
Hey,
how you doing?

333
00:21:06.731 --> 00:21:09.850
And all that type of thing.
So I tell him,
I go,
okay,
I go on big red sox fan.

334
00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:12.820
This is you beating the red sox as you're beating the Yankees.
So John,

335
00:21:12.821 --> 00:21:16.360
this one just right,
bill,
I'm sorry.
Any immediately looks at me.
And he goes,

336
00:21:16.361 --> 00:21:17.194
I'm not

337
00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.310
a fucking died laughing.
I loved that he still had that competitive thing,

338
00:21:24.311 --> 00:21:27.490
you know?
And I was like,
I know you're not.
I go say you're not,

339
00:21:27.491 --> 00:21:30.170
that's funny or whatever.
And he didn't,
he still wrote it and then just right.

340
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:34.660
You know,
you know you're welcome on the other one.
And he actually wrote,
uh,

341
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.140
wrote bill,
I'm sorry,
on one,
Eh,
Pete Rose,

342
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.660
1975 world series MVP.

343
00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:45.130
And on the other one,
he wrote,
uh,

344
00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.610
Bill,
you're welcome,
Pete rose.

345
00:21:48.611 --> 00:21:52.450
And then he wrote reds for Yankee zero,

346
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.660
something about a sweep or something like that.
In fact,

347
00:21:55.661 --> 00:21:59.410
when I brought up the Yankees,
I said,
yeah,
but you beat the Yankees in 1976.

348
00:21:59.411 --> 00:22:03.340
He goes and he immediately goes,
swept their asses.
It's fucking great.

349
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:09.070
Um,
so anyways,
I got to meet him and get shot the shit with them for a second,

350
00:22:09.071 --> 00:22:12.850
shot the shit with the greatest hitter of all time.
You know,

351
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:17.470
I asked him who was a,
who's the toughest guy you've ever faced?

352
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:22.810
All right,
I'm going to pause here.
You're going to guess.
Who Do you think it was?

353
00:22:22.811 --> 00:22:26.260
A guy from the 60s.
Who Do you think?

354
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:27.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

355
00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.230
<v 0>Hi.
What are you guessing?
Bob Gibson.
It's a good guest.
Don Drysdale.</v>

356
00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.310
Now the good guests.
Steve Cowen,

357
00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:39.180
who was actually Sandy Colfax.
How's that?
Really?
Sandy Colfax.

358
00:22:39.181 --> 00:22:43.590
And then he made this motion of like the ball just fucking dropping off a cliff.

359
00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.160
He did it with both hands.
Like the guy could get a break in either way.

360
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:48.920
And uh,

361
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.290
<v 1>okay.</v>

362
00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:51.970
<v 0>I Dunno.
I actually talked to about the red sox.</v>

363
00:22:51.971 --> 00:22:56.740
He actually like still watches baseball.
He's totally fucking into it.
And,

364
00:22:56.741 --> 00:22:59.660
uh,
I think at first he taught me and Jay were a couple of creeps,

365
00:22:59.661 --> 00:23:04.180
said he could tell that we really looked up to him and wanted to talk baseball

366
00:23:04.181 --> 00:23:08.390
and he was fucking,
you know,
just totally warmed up,
man.
Cool as hell.

367
00:23:08.391 --> 00:23:10.930
So if you ever get a chance and don't be a cunt,

368
00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:14.230
like that little weasel that brought that shit up.
All right.

369
00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.560
Everybody knows he'd been on baseball enough already.
You know,

370
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:22.230
they didn't let him into the hall of fame.
He cited memorabilia at a casino.

371
00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.800
We ease,
pay the price.
You know,
you realize how small that is.

372
00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.220
Like they actually get a baseball there.
It was all in black that he signs.

373
00:23:30.221 --> 00:23:34.720
I'm sorry.
I bet on baseball Pete rose.
And I'm just like,
ugh.
Jesus Christ.

374
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:39.550
You bring that ball up to him.
Kind of fucking asshole would do that.
Oh,

375
00:23:39.551 --> 00:23:42.520
who's kidding?
Who half the people on Twitter?
Um,

376
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:48.440
anyways.
Oh,
you know what?
Fucking blows it doesn't blow.

377
00:23:48.441 --> 00:23:53.240
It was actually an awesome sporting,
uh,
experience.
But,
uh,
I don't know,

378
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.220
some of you guys who follow me on Twitter or whatever.

379
00:23:55.250 --> 00:24:00.190
Last week I was in Boston and,
uh,
I'm,
I'm,

380
00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.760
if you listen to last week's podcast,

381
00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:06.260
I mentioned that I was going through that Bruins,
maple leaf's game seven.
And uh,

382
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.750
I did get in,
I was there,
I went with this comedian Doug sin.
Yay.

383
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.730
Boston gay came up from up from New York and went to the game.

384
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.960
I had a good feeling,
I thought we were going to win it.
And uh,

385
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.350
I gotta be honest with you,
you know,

386
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.050
we look good for the first two minutes and then all of a sudden it was all leafs

387
00:24:24.051 --> 00:24:27.140
after that.
And at three to one

388
00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:32.000
I was convinced we were going to lose.
So I'm like,
God,
that's it.
That's it.

389
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:36.680
We score two goals.
That's our limit.
They just scored the third,
you know,

390
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.970
the leafs of playing great hockey,
they totally got this game in hand.
So,

391
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.260
you know,

392
00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:46.910
and then they went up four to one and that's when the first like wave a Bruins

393
00:24:46.911 --> 00:24:50.960
fans started leaving like seven,
eight minutes left.
I forget what happened.

394
00:24:50.961 --> 00:24:53.690
And like people were leaving and leaf fans,
we'll move on down.

395
00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.530
All right now it's not like I'm sitting there going,
you know,

396
00:24:57.531 --> 00:25:01.760
I gave him shit for leaving.
I was yelling where you go,
what the fuck?

397
00:25:01.761 --> 00:25:03.080
But my shit was more,

398
00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:08.560
we have to stay because I hate when the other team's fans take over your

399
00:25:08.781 --> 00:25:10.630
building,
you know what I mean?

400
00:25:10.631 --> 00:25:13.580
And get to celebrate and kind of fucking dance in your living room.

401
00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.630
So after three to one,
I was convinced we were going to lose.
So,

402
00:25:17.631 --> 00:25:22.400
but the only reason why I was still there was because I was there to basically

403
00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:25.700
give maple leaf fans dirty look when they beat us.

404
00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:29.750
So they'd have to tone down this celebration and also to give a bad description

405
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.750
to the cops if somebody threw something at them,
you know,

406
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.380
unless it was something major and really hurt him.
Um,

407
00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:41.960
so that's it.
So I'd like to thank my mother for teaching me to never leave.

408
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.710
You'll always stay.
You now believe that game until it's over.

409
00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:49.510
And we stayed there and all of a sudden it was 42 who Cheech score then on it

410
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.570
was four to three,
four to four fucking place was going insane.

411
00:25:53.571 --> 00:25:56.540
And I was actually nervous that um,

412
00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:02.120
you know,
and the regulation that was given Toronto a time to regroup,

413
00:26:02.121 --> 00:26:04.370
almost like when you're in a fight,
you know,

414
00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.430
you see a fighter and he's got the guy in the ropes and all of a sudden saved by

415
00:26:07.431 --> 00:26:09.890
the bell.
I almost felt like it was like that and I just had this,

416
00:26:09.891 --> 00:26:12.950
I hate this gnawing feeling that they would have come out and score a quick one

417
00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.020
and all that excitement would have been for nothing.

418
00:26:15.021 --> 00:26:18.680
But fortunately a burger on scored.
And I have to tell you,

419
00:26:18.681 --> 00:26:20.840
as far as sporting events that I've ever been to,

420
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.660
that one is a close second to a,

421
00:26:23.661 --> 00:26:26.720
I went to the Superbowl when the Patriots beat the Rams for our first super bowl

422
00:26:26.721 --> 00:26:31.070
championship and it was unbelievable.
My condolences to the leaf fans,
man.

423
00:26:31.071 --> 00:26:33.770
I think you guys are fucking awesome fans and a,

424
00:26:33.771 --> 00:26:37.520
I wouldn't wish what happened to you on anybody other than Montreal.

425
00:26:37.521 --> 00:26:42.070
Canadien fans for the simple fact that they fucking deserve it.
Uh,

426
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.760
you know what's funny though?
Leaf fans are really hated.
They're really hate it.

427
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.000
I don't know why.
I've never understood that.

428
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:57.190
Like how you can like have that level of no championships.
I mean they're,

429
00:26:57.191 --> 00:26:57.970
they're,

430
00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:02.560
they're going on 46 years,

431
00:27:02.561 --> 00:27:06.070
so it's 47 seasons.
They coming up on 50 fucking years,

432
00:27:06.071 --> 00:27:08.980
a half a century and not winning shit.

433
00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:13.840
And people still hate him.
I don't know why.
I don't,
you know,

434
00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.440
I'm going to have to ask some Canadian people what the fucking deal is with that

435
00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.590
because I would think that they would hate Montreal fans more.
But it seems like,

436
00:27:20.591 --> 00:27:23.980
I dunno,
I was surprised.
Maybe they do eight Montreal fans more,
I don't know.

437
00:27:23.981 --> 00:27:26.740
But I was surprised at the level of hatred,

438
00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.220
like the emails that I was getting from other Canadians about how much they hate

439
00:27:30.221 --> 00:27:32.140
fucking Toronto leaf,
make maple leaf fans,

440
00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:37.210
the ones that came to the fleet center.
We're cool as hell,
you know,
and uh,

441
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:41.830
so whatever.
So now we're into the next round and the fucking bro A's

442
00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:48.490
go Bob Bob.
That's what it used to be.
They'd have to fucking,

443
00:27:48.491 --> 00:27:52.060
the Rangers won in 1994 and that let's go.

444
00:27:52.061 --> 00:27:56.360
Rangers became so iconic that uh,

445
00:27:56.450 --> 00:28:00.940
that that fucking rhythm took over everything.
So now whenever people go,

446
00:28:00.941 --> 00:28:05.580
let's go bro wins.
I can never fully give my heart into that fucking uh,

447
00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:09.610
that chant.
Cause I'm always thinking that's the rangers chant.
We were always,

448
00:28:09.611 --> 00:28:12.520
here we go Bruins,
here we go.
They were always let's go rangers.

449
00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.510
But like that whole writ,
that toe cadence has taken over everything,

450
00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:22.980
which the funniest one is his Yankee fence cause they used to go 1918 and then

451
00:28:23.501 --> 00:28:25.210
when that was over,
they,

452
00:28:25.211 --> 00:28:29.000
for some reason you needed four syllables.

453
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.650
They went,

454
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:35.650
they took a fourth syllable chant and they try to cram them in a long gate.

455
00:28:38.361 --> 00:28:42.920
The third day they basically,
they went from 1918 to Boston sucks,

456
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:47.850
but they kept the same rhythm so they go,
Boston sucks.

457
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.920
Oh those fucking hero Eaton Jackass is,
um,

458
00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:59.300
why would you be like,
Fuck you Boston?
I mean something that fit,

459
00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:04.720
you know why?
Because they're not that smart.
Um,

460
00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.340
anyways.

461
00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.010
<v 3>Okay.</v>

462
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.680
<v 0>But anyway,
you always were the best thing about fucking being back in Boston.</v>

463
00:29:10.681 --> 00:29:13.380
Cause I watched the,
uh,
I watch a red sox game,

464
00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:16.920
went out to get some pizza and I just walk.
I mean he just was so fucking nice.

465
00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:21.390
This is the biggest thing I miss about living in Massachusetts is just walking

466
00:29:21.391 --> 00:29:26.391
into a sports bar or a fucking pizza place in the game I want to watch is on and

467
00:29:27.091 --> 00:29:29.730
everybody in there is for the team that I like.

468
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:35.420
I moved away from Boston in 1995 and it's like I've been behind enemy lines here

469
00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:40.900
coming up on 20 fucking years and I'm exhausted.
I'm like,

470
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.490
I've said this before in the podcast.
I'm like,
I'm like a sports,

471
00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:50.320
like Donnie Brasco,
you know,
so he sent me a fucking tweet today.
They go,

472
00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:52.380
hey bill,
now that you live in La,
uh,

473
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.560
are you a kings fan now or do you still have loyalty to the Bruins?

474
00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:00.670
And I,
that is,
I can't even relate to that fucking question.

475
00:30:00.671 --> 00:30:02.920
That's such a dumb question.
I don't understand how people,

476
00:30:02.921 --> 00:30:05.200
how you root for a team your whole fucking life,

477
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:07.060
and then you move somewhere else you'd like,
well,

478
00:30:07.061 --> 00:30:11.740
I guess I'll root for these guys now.
You know,
I don't hate the kings.
I mean,

479
00:30:11.741 --> 00:30:15.040
they sucked my whole life coming up.
So we never ran into him.

480
00:30:15.041 --> 00:30:18.220
We always ran to the Edmonton Oilers as far as people out west,

481
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.650
they used to fucking kick our ass.
So,
uh,
but even then,
I didn't hate him.

482
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:28.110
They hated the Canadians.
Hated the sabers.
I hated Hatford

483
00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:34.360
the dig site in mind for some reason,
but that was the atoms division back then.

484
00:30:34.361 --> 00:30:37.420
So I really didn't like them.
I didn't like the devils.

485
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:42.370
Fucking island were always tough islanders with tough Jesus.

486
00:30:42.371 --> 00:30:44.770
They were tough back then in the early eighties.

487
00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.700
Obviously they want a middle of a fucking dynasty.
So,
um,
yeah,

488
00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.570
so the person who asks me that,
I don't hate the,
uh,
I'm not a fan.

489
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:55.600
I'm actually a fan.
Like I liked the way they play.
I like their,

490
00:30:55.601 --> 00:30:58.890
they're a franchise the same way.
I like,
you know,

491
00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.320
I am a fan of like the devil rays or something like that.
But,
uh,
until they,

492
00:31:03.321 --> 00:31:06.400
they didn't let people say devil anymore,
you know,

493
00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:11.320
like Tampa needed another reason to make funny fun of them.
You know what I mean?

494
00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:17.860
I think the name Maria Baseball teams to evil.
I don't mind the fish part.

495
00:31:17.861 --> 00:31:19.810
Put the other part.
I just,
I just don't like,

496
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:24.710
I don't eat devil's food cake and I love dessert.
Um,

497
00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:28.660
you know,
reminds me of last night.
Oh,
big.
First of all,
big thank you to,
uh,

498
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:34.600
the Mirage casino for having me out there.
Um,
and everybody who showed up,

499
00:31:34.601 --> 00:31:36.310
I had so much fun.

500
00:31:36.311 --> 00:31:40.390
The two shows that I did out there and they had me,
you know,

501
00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.290
I took a picture of it and I know you guys are going to shit all over me.

502
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:48.040
You guys always figuring out how to fucking way to shit all over me.

503
00:31:48.041 --> 00:31:50.680
But I don't give a fuck.
It was a big moment in my life.

504
00:31:50.681 --> 00:31:53.380
So I'm up on one of those main mark.
He's out there.

505
00:31:53.381 --> 00:31:57.220
They don't want a big stupid fucking red head right up there.

506
00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.280
You know,
it was fucking awesome.

507
00:32:00.281 --> 00:32:04.100
I was playing this theater and um,

508
00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:09.700
it was great.
It was packed.
Both shows,
signed some DVDs,
took some pictures,

509
00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:14.740
had a great fucking time.
You know,
you know what I did?

510
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:18.530
I only gambled once.
I bet on the Preakness I came down,

511
00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.350
I was watching the penguins,
um,

512
00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:25.480
senators game the one we're fucking Crosby had the hat trick right out of the

513
00:32:25.481 --> 00:32:29.620
gate.
And uh,
I'll sit in there with law head,
you know,

514
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:33.610
nursing a beer because I had a show that night and I'm watching it and in front

515
00:32:33.611 --> 00:32:36.400
of us,
these guys were betting the horses and I gotta tell you something.

516
00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:41.480
There's no gamblers are funnier than people who bet the fucking horse has been.

517
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:45.590
They are hilarious.
They get so fucking into it.

518
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.100
Is that coming down the home stretch?
I stopped watching the hockey game.

519
00:32:49.101 --> 00:32:50.720
The hockey game was on the giant one.

520
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.110
They're watching it on these little screens and like these fucking degenerate

521
00:32:54.111 --> 00:32:58.820
gambling cubicles and they got their rolled up programs and they hitting the

522
00:32:58.821 --> 00:33:00.660
table.
Just go,

523
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:03.760
<v 2>come on,
come on,
come on your six head up.</v>

524
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:05.540
<v 0>I don't see it.
They,
they literally go to the hospital.</v>

525
00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:10.560
<v 2>God,
you six car,
you sex,
God,
you said God,
you say hi.</v>

526
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.530
It's just a head up.
Head Up.

527
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:17.300
<v 0>This fucking guy yelled in the casino.
Beat that horse.</v>

528
00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.150
You got to stand up living out here.

529
00:33:22.151 --> 00:33:26.350
Right and fucking Tinseltown most liberal place ever.
All right.

530
00:33:26.351 --> 00:33:29.320
Peter has a Goddamn parade out every fucking three seconds.

531
00:33:29.321 --> 00:33:33.970
So just to hear that beat that horse,
I was fucking dying laughing.

532
00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.000
Even though I love horses and if I ever owned one,

533
00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:40.660
my dreams don't a horse and never ride it.
You know,
keep that fuck a pure,

534
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:45.700
I don't ever want to break it.
So it allows me to get on.
It's fucking back.

535
00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:50.500
My stupid booze weight sitting on his back is,
it walks me up the hill,

536
00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.810
even though if it wanted to,

537
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:55.870
it could just kick me with its back foot knocked me out forever.

538
00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.710
There's something sad about that.
So anyways,

539
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.770
so I go down there the next day would lie ahead.

540
00:34:02.771 --> 00:34:05.650
So we put money on the Preakness EFIC.
I can remember though,
fuck I even

541
00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.520
one of the horses we bet wasn't in the rate,

542
00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:13.960
wasn't in the race from fucking the second it started.
And then my other going,

543
00:34:13.961 --> 00:34:18.850
I bet was it horse numbers wasn't three something with golden it,

544
00:34:18.851 --> 00:34:19.690
I can't fucking remember.

545
00:34:19.691 --> 00:34:22.690
It was in second place until they came around the clubhouse turning and that was

546
00:34:22.691 --> 00:34:24.000
it.
Uh,

547
00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:29.010
but the fucking place was jam packed and people were going crazy for like a

548
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:33.040
minute and a half or whatever it is.
It's just,

549
00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:37.510
they go nuts the second they're let out and then that dies down.

550
00:34:37.511 --> 00:34:40.000
And then the coming around the first turn,
there's this Marmot,
you go,

551
00:34:40.001 --> 00:34:43.880
there you go,
get on a rail going on around,
you know,
and then this is it.

552
00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:44.830
Calming down the back,

553
00:34:44.831 --> 00:34:49.590
stretch that fucking shit when they come down and down and stretch that cub,

554
00:34:49.591 --> 00:34:54.190
the place is going fucking crazy.
And everybody's screaming.

555
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:58.990
There was this one guy,
I watched him,
he lost six races in a fucking row.
So,

556
00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:02.560
and I didn't bet any of the racist.
This guy was like the,
the,
the,

557
00:35:02.561 --> 00:35:05.560
the mush in a Bronx tale.
And I'm looking at it,
he's the guy who yelled,

558
00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:09.190
beat that horse,
right?
So I'm looking at him,

559
00:35:09.191 --> 00:35:13.300
cause I bet the Preakness and I see him and his family sitting behind me and

560
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:17.590
he's got this big shitty grin on his face and I bet I think horse number three

561
00:35:17.591 --> 00:35:22.000
in horse number eight.
And he's got this big shitty grin on his face.

562
00:35:22.001 --> 00:35:25.060
And he turned around and he looks basically over my head.

563
00:35:25.061 --> 00:35:29.440
He looks back at his family and he holds up number seven and he's smiling and

564
00:35:29.441 --> 00:35:32.350
nodding.
I'm thinking,
right,
go,
well that fucking horse isn't winning.

565
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:35.680
He said three or rate,
I swear to God,

566
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:37.650
if I had any backbone and would have up my ticket,

567
00:35:37.651 --> 00:35:41.220
like fucking Chazz Palminteri and just go home guys.
It's over.

568
00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:46.770
Um,
so anyways,
so let's,
let's get on to fucking read and something for this week.

569
00:35:46.771 --> 00:35:50.820
I had a really
interesting email from somebody.

570
00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:55.170
I don't know how to,
uh,
I really don't know how to,

571
00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:59.890
what the hell is,
this is going to be brutal this week.
Cause you know what?

572
00:35:59.891 --> 00:36:03.280
These guys are finally working on my house and I don't have Internet because the

573
00:36:03.281 --> 00:36:05.830
room that they did,
they fucking Yank the thing out of the wall.
All right,

574
00:36:05.831 --> 00:36:08.410
here we go.
Helping an ugly friend.

575
00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:14.500
Do you have an ugly French shirt?
We all do.
Here we go.
Dear billion.
Birr um,

576
00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:17.740
thanks for doing the podcast,
but he'd be DPTP thank you.
Um,

577
00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:22.480
what am I good friends is ugly.
I'll say it outright.
God bless his heart.

578
00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:26.170
He's 26 short,
disproportionate face.

579
00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:31.480
I don't know what that means.
A skinny with a gut.
Slowly forming.
Oh God.

580
00:36:31.481 --> 00:36:36.310
Receding hairline,
Jesus.
And worst of all,
he doesn't take care of his teeth.

581
00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:39.850
Eh,
wow.

582
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:45.630
Jesus fucking Christ all I thought if there was Clint Howard,

583
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:51.330
um,
over the past couple of years he's gotten more and more bitter about life.

584
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:54.750
I believe it's dude who's insecurity about his looks and attracting women.

585
00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.290
He has a great degree,
really well paying job,

586
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.320
good sense of humor and can talk to the ladies.

587
00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:04.950
However he lacks the killer instinct needed to close the deal.

588
00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:08.910
Meaning he gets friend zoned with every girl that is possibly interested,

589
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.530
which is very few.
Well,
he kind of talking out of both sides of your mouth.

590
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:17.100
You're saying he's great with the women,
but he just can't close the deal.

591
00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:21.120
Why there are only a few women interested in them.
What are you going to say?

592
00:37:21.121 --> 00:37:23.370
See the first paragraph where you decide to fuck.

593
00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.880
You basically described a troll.
Um,

594
00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.200
myself and close friends have been subtly pushing him to work out,

595
00:37:31.201 --> 00:37:34.290
clean his teeth,
eat healthily,
healthy,
et cetera.

596
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.290
But he gets very offended whenever we suggest anything.

597
00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:41.850
He seems to be set on a path of thinking he's going to have to wait until his

598
00:37:41.851 --> 00:37:46.851
forties before women will be desperate enough to ignore his looks and data for a

599
00:37:47.011 --> 00:37:49.350
successful career.
Uh,

600
00:37:49.351 --> 00:37:51.960
this type of attitude is starting to affect his friendships.

601
00:37:51.961 --> 00:37:55.590
He's getting bitter and defensive,
bitter,
defensive and confrontational.

602
00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:59.880
Nobody likes an angry troll.
They really don't.
Okay.

603
00:37:59.881 --> 00:38:03.620
If you're going to go the troll route,
you know,
you got,

604
00:38:03.621 --> 00:38:05.880
you gotta be at the very least affable.

605
00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:09.150
You don't work your way towards jolly.

606
00:38:09.151 --> 00:38:13.350
I would think maybe you can put on a silly hat,
build some toys,

607
00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.980
I dunno.
Um,
as his friend,

608
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.060
how can I help them get off this path and boost his confidence to get that

609
00:38:21.061 --> 00:38:24.850
killer instinct and confidence that the ladies love,
even if you're,

610
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.780
even if you're ugly,
thanks for the advice and go fuck yourself.

611
00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:32.490
Uh,
bs.
Shout out to the beautiful city of Boston.

612
00:38:32.491 --> 00:38:35.360
I was there last year for a hockey tournament and can't wait to go back.

613
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.740
He s s fuck,
he ruins.
I've lost two years of my life.

614
00:38:38.741 --> 00:38:42.710
Do the stress of the maple leaf series.
Oh Jesus.
God.

615
00:38:42.711 --> 00:38:47.170
Must have sent that before it was over.
Um,
all right,

616
00:38:47.171 --> 00:38:48.580
so what do you say to this guy?

617
00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:53.300
Oh Wow.
Well,
I don't know him,

618
00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.930
but at some point you just going to have to fucking lay it on the line

619
00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:03.200
and say it to them and say like,
look,
you know something?
Yeah,

620
00:39:03.201 --> 00:39:06.800
just like me.
All right.
You want to have fun,

621
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:10.250
you want to go.
So your oats is,
they say,

622
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.880
and then you want to find love and get married and start a family.
Correct.

623
00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:16.533
<v 1>You know</v>

624
00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:22.400
<v 0>he got to brush your fucking teeth.
I don't know how to,
how do you go into it?</v>

625
00:39:22.401 --> 00:39:26.390
Slowly like this is no matter how you come at,
it's when somebody is defensive,

626
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:27.543
this is,

627
00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:32.420
there's no way to come at them without burning up in the atmosphere of their

628
00:39:32.421 --> 00:39:36.680
fucking bitterness during reentry.
How do you do it?

629
00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:42.500
I would wait till the next time he says something bitter or defensive or

630
00:39:42.501 --> 00:39:45.710
something like that and just look at them and be like,
listen dude,

631
00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.090
you're your own worst enemy.

632
00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:49.083
<v 1>All right.</v>

633
00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:54.370
<v 0>Life is a horse race and you're shooting yours in the back of the head before</v>

634
00:39:54.371 --> 00:39:55.870
the fucking gate even opens.

635
00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.770
Then you walk around the track with mud on your shoes.
You know,

636
00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.720
wonder why a,

637
00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.690
I don't know why you fucking some other horse racing thing that I don't know

638
00:40:04.691 --> 00:40:07.660
shit about.
I picked the wrong metaphor.
You know what?

639
00:40:07.661 --> 00:40:12.140
I may just wait til he's being a cunt.
I remember one time I,
I knew this guy,

640
00:40:12.141 --> 00:40:16.780
he was just negative as fucking hell and you'd say,
Hey,
you know something,

641
00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.930
if you keep doing this,
maybe this will happen.
And then he always be like,
yeah,

642
00:40:19.931 --> 00:40:20.980
you know,
with my luck,

643
00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.510
the fucking piano fall on my head and I got sick of it.

644
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:28.060
And then finally I'd be like,
yeah,
you know.
Well,
you know,
if you think that way,

645
00:40:28.061 --> 00:40:31.390
that's probably gonna happen.
And only said at one time.

646
00:40:31.391 --> 00:40:34.630
And he never talked that way again.
He's still negative,

647
00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:39.650
but I didn't have to deal with that shit.
I Dunno what to do with this guy.

648
00:40:39.651 --> 00:40:42.560
Like,
um,
you might,

649
00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:46.820
you might have to fucking channel Patrice O'neil,
God rest his soul.

650
00:40:46.821 --> 00:40:50.990
Patrice O'Neal would've sat this dude down and what it said,
Edward,

651
00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:55.220
what the fuck are you doing?
Look at yourself.

652
00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:57.573
<v 1>You know</v>

653
00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.290
<v 0>you got a fucked up face.</v>

654
00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:05.270
You're losing your God damn hair at the very least brushed your fucking teeth.

655
00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.970
Get some fucking better clothes.
What's wrong?
I can't do,

656
00:41:09.971 --> 00:41:13.540
I can't do what he would've done.
He would've been able to do it.

657
00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:14.171
He would have hurt.

658
00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:19.150
The guy's feeling so bad while helping him to become a better person at the same

659
00:41:19.151 --> 00:41:20.020
time.
You might,

660
00:41:20.021 --> 00:41:22.510
you're going to have to come up with your own fucking version of that.

661
00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:24.973
<v 1>You know,</v>

662
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:28.320
<v 0>I,
I don't,
I don't know what,</v>

663
00:41:28.321 --> 00:41:31.120
what do you do when somebody just stops brushing their teeth?

664
00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:34.080
Just tap it out on

665
00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:34.913
<v 1>humanity</v>

666
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:40.740
<v 0>and you're saying he's smart.
He has a degree.</v>

667
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:44.580
He's not one of those reasons.

668
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.240
Anything worse than somebody really smart with bad fucking hygiene.

669
00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:52.350
You know those people that they're so fucking smart,
they,
you know,
they show up,

670
00:41:52.351 --> 00:41:57.110
they got like sleep there.
I,
Oh God.

671
00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.710
Too bad teeth is a goddamn deal breaker.

672
00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:03.183
<v 1>You know</v>

673
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:09.350
<v 0>Jesus fucking Christ.
You know,
it's funny.
I'm disgusted with this guy.</v>

674
00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:17.560
Don't you teach?
You're getting your yummy fighting.
Yeah.
You just got to quit

675
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:23.110
fucking asshole.
I was born with orange hair that I quit.

676
00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:27.600
I got great teeth that I ever stopped brushing.
No,
I did.

677
00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.570
I got second and third week bars.
I without the sun.

678
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:38.740
Then I stopped flossing.
I did what?

679
00:42:38.741 --> 00:42:41.200
Fucking moping around.
Who?
Ugly mother fucker.

680
00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:46.560
You get yourself some skull and Listerine and a fucking scrub brush you go to.

681
00:42:46.931 --> 00:42:49.390
If God damn dentist,
she gets your fucking teeth clique.

682
00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:50.810
<v 1>Okay.</v>

683
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:54.680
<v 0>All right.
When you hit on a woman,
you stay on it.
You keep those plates spinning.</v>

684
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.680
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

685
00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.550
<v 0>Oh,
he's having a condom.
Always be ready.</v>

686
00:42:59.020 --> 00:42:59.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

687
00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:01.870
<v 0>What time is it?
It's great.
Dot.
Do something like that on.</v>

688
00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:05.110
What the fuck to tell you?
That's fucking,

689
00:43:05.111 --> 00:43:08.080
there's nothing that annoys me more than watching somebody just quit.

690
00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:09.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

691
00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.370
<v 0>Tell him that.
Tell him stop being such a fucking baby.</v>

692
00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:18.270
It's fucking eight year olds so together God damn shirts.

693
00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:19.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

694
00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.270
<v 0>Probably toddlers making the toothbrushes that he's not even using all poor</v>

695
00:43:23.271 --> 00:43:24.290
fucking baby.

696
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:25.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

697
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:29.840
<v 0>You know,
you don't look like John Davidson.
Who gives a fuck.</v>

698
00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:32.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

699
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:36.140
<v 0>Brush your teeth.
Shave your fucking head down.
All right.</v>

700
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:39.560
Go to the gym.
Give yourself a fighting chance.

701
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:45.980
Stop treating yourself like you're the pirates.
You know,

702
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:49.430
running yourself like the fucking pirates do.

703
00:43:49.431 --> 00:43:50.960
What did I do to this God damn thing?

704
00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:53.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

705
00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:55.020
<v 0>All right.
Sorry man.
I just,
I,</v>

706
00:43:55.021 --> 00:43:59.890
there's just something really fucking gets me about people who do that shit.

707
00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.210
We just fucking quit.

708
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:03.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

709
00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:07.850
<v 0>It's nothing worse than that unless you really just truly suck at something
like,</v>

710
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.340
you know,
like you guys here,
I sing,
I'm terrible.

711
00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.290
But it's funny cause it's the podcast.

712
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:15.500
But if I was actually trying to sing professionally,

713
00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.620
that's one thing you really should quit

714
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:23.660
and fucking do something else with.
Just,
just for your fellow man,
you know?

715
00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:26.740
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

716
00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.320
<v 0>But you just,
just,
uh,
just a quick,
you're going to quit.</v>

717
00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.920
I'm legitimately disgusted with that person I never met before.

718
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:35.850
I don't know what to tell you.

719
00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:37.983
<v 1>Okay.</v>

720
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:43.020
<v 0>What an asshole.
Fuck any gets bitter.</v>

721
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:45.030
You know what?
That reminds me of some reason there was fun.

722
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:48.090
One time I was doing a show and there was somebody in the front row that was

723
00:44:48.091 --> 00:44:50.730
mentally challenged.
So there's no way I'm fucking with this guy.

724
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:54.600
And then I get on stage and the kids account,
he starts fucking heckling me,

725
00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:57.660
you know?
And every time I don't say anything back,

726
00:44:57.661 --> 00:45:00.750
he gets a little more fucking confident and it finally,
I was just like,

727
00:45:00.751 --> 00:45:04.140
you know what?
I came in with the fuck.
I said to him,
the crowd pulled back.

728
00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:07.560
I'm like,
you know what?
Fuck this guy.
Fuck this guy.

729
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:13.420
They're just like everybody else.
Okay?
Some of them are cunts,

730
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.980
and this is a great example.
So fuck you buddy.

731
00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:20.730
What kind of capita?
Dad?
It was really a fight.
Yeah.
Oh Man.

732
00:45:20.731 --> 00:45:22.020
I think I fucking annoyed me.

733
00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:25.250
I was doing some hell Gig the first time I lived out here in l a m standards,

734
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:28.650
some fucking Mexican restaurant.
I'm getting fucking heckled by this kid.

735
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.100
All right?
I am.
You know what I'm doing living in La.

736
00:45:32.101 --> 00:45:34.650
I'm going through that fucking bullshit.
But you know what?
I didn't quit.

737
00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:40.290
I brushed my teeth before that fucking shelf
do.

738
00:45:40.291 --> 00:45:42.990
When you,
when you just don't brush your teeth,
you just tapped out.

739
00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:44.690
<v 1>Okay?</v>

740
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:47.300
<v 0>You just say,
fuck it.
Why won't this,
wait a minute.</v>

741
00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:52.770
Why I want this thing fucking low.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

742
00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:58.580
You know,
you guys hear me battle on this shit every week.
Do I fucking quit this?

743
00:45:59.600 --> 00:45:59.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

744
00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:04.140
<v 0>Loading.
How do I make it go back?</v>

745
00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:05.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

746
00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:05.970
<v 0>Ah,</v>

747
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:09.460
I was doing so well and all I had to do was read a couple more and I was done.

748
00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:15.550
What if I shut it off and then I turn it back on again?
What happened?

749
00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:20.740
Jesus Christ,
I swear to God.
How do these things make you fucking life easier?

750
00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:24.820
Could somebody please explain it to me?
How it makes it easier.
Oh sure.

751
00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:27.910
It's easier to go shopping or find out.

752
00:46:27.911 --> 00:46:30.920
You know what you're fucking neighbor jerks off too.
But other than that,

753
00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:34.690
how does it make you fucking life easier for someone like me?

754
00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:36.140
Hey Nia.

755
00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.193
<v 1>Okay.</v>

756
00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:39.183
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

757
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:44.420
I know she hears me.

758
00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.780
And that's the thing that's slowly kills you in a relationship.

759
00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:52.160
I know she fucking hears me and I know she hears the panic and my fucking voice

760
00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:56.330
and I know she knows that I need her and she just gotta I got to hit pause.

761
00:46:56.331 --> 00:47:00.500
God fucking damn it.
Hang on a second.

Bap,
bap,
bap boo boo.
All right,

828
00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:25.730
experience with the threesome.
All right,
firstly,
congrats to the pod kids.

829
00:51:25.731 --> 00:51:29.060
Let me ship.
Alright,
um,
anyways,

830
00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:33.530
in a recent podcast you mentioned the guy who wants to bang another chick in

831
00:51:33.531 --> 00:51:37.610
front of his wife.
Then you asked if someone's got some good stories.
No,
no,
no.

832
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:40.370
She wanted him to do it.
Oh,
by the way,

833
00:51:40.371 --> 00:51:44.180
somebody else gave me a great insight to that,
which was a,

834
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:47.300
that his wife or girlfriend did the same thing,

835
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.360
said she wanted to see him have sex with another woman and it turned out that

836
00:51:52.941 --> 00:51:57.410
she was trying to lessen her guilt cause she already fucked around on them.
So,

837
00:51:57.411 --> 00:52:01.370
uh,
you know,
it's a tangled web being weaved here

838
00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:07.580
now did the pussy is,
um,
after countless efforts of hitting on this,

839
00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:11.270
after countless efforts of hitting on this chicken,
my class,

840
00:52:11.271 --> 00:52:13.280
I found out that she was in,
she was engaged.

841
00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:17.840
So I gave it arrest not long after she started hinting sexual stuff all the
time.

842
00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:19.940
Getting a little too comfortable with the touching.

843
00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:24.500
I bet a moron was shit like this and fuck myself over to bank.

844
00:52:24.501 --> 00:52:28.640
Some random chick who turns out to be a cycle at least a couple of times.
Oh,

845
00:52:28.641 --> 00:52:31.950
so you're sitting there going,
I think this girl's giving me sexual vibes,
but uh,

846
00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:35.990
I don't want to be an idiot and shit where I eat.
Is that what you're saying?

847
00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:39.230
Well,
you're not here to tell me either way,
so that's what I'm going to think.

848
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:40.550
So anyways,
he goes,

849
00:52:40.551 --> 00:52:45.470
I started to question her about her man and what she really wants if she's just

850
00:52:45.471 --> 00:52:48.290
being a tease.
Um,

851
00:52:48.291 --> 00:52:52.610
she said she suggested to her fiance to have a threesome with another chick from

852
00:52:52.611 --> 00:52:57.320
class.
Now she wants the two dude type of deal,
tag teaming,

853
00:52:57.321 --> 00:53:00.410
double penetration of whatever else you want to call it to it right there.

854
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:05.270
That's not your wife.
Okay.
That is a free fucking spirit.

855
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:06.261
Okay.

856
00:53:06.261 --> 00:53:09.680
You Bang her and then you hand her backpack and you let her continue walking

857
00:53:09.681 --> 00:53:12.870
down the road with that little Saucepan,
clink,
clink,
clink,

858
00:53:12.871 --> 00:53:16.160
clean the pots and pans,
clicking off the back.
Anyways,
he goes,

859
00:53:16.161 --> 00:53:20.330
I can't say it was comfortable,
so I had to lay some ground rules,

860
00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:24.620
no eye contact between the guys,
no sword crossing,
et Cetera,

861
00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.120
et cetera.
Dude,

862
00:53:27.121 --> 00:53:30.300
I gotta tell you something that what is in it for the,

863
00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:35.570
as a guy to have a fucking two on one with another dude.

864
00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:37.460
Although I know,

865
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:43.070
I know one guy who I actually understood it because they would be doing the

866
00:53:43.411 --> 00:53:46.570
rotisserie with some girl and they would,
well,
you know,

867
00:53:46.571 --> 00:53:50.460
and she can't look at them obviously because she's busy and what they would do

868
00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:51.700
is they would try to make each other

869
00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:52.663
<v 2>laugh.</v>

870
00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:03.580
<v 0>That to me that,
that,
that's fucking hilarious.
Um,</v>

871
00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.110
and unless you're the woman,

872
00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:09.040
you never want to hear somebody just go in the middle of fucking having sex with

873
00:54:09.041 --> 00:54:13.900
you,
I guess.
Um,
are you loving
about a week later,

874
00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:18.100
let's get back to the thing here.
About a week later,
chicken invited me,
um,

875
00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:22.060
to the house.
I'm sorry,
I'm having more trouble than usual reading this.

876
00:54:22.061 --> 00:54:26.590
I keep touching this fucking tablet thing.
Hair and shit just keeps popping up.

877
00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:30.190
I don't know how to get rid of it.
All right.
I think we're back to normal here.

878
00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:32.260
So he goes about a week later,

879
00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:37.770
the chicken invited me to the house to prepare a presentation and asked the dude

880
00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:41.200
if he was okay with everything that happened.

881
00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:47.200
He said,
well,
she let me have it with another chick.
So it's totally fair.

882
00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:51.390
Oh,
okay.
So you guys haven't done it yet.

883
00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:52.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

884
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:55.730
<v 0>So did you guys come in there and dressed in like power suits with like a</v>

885
00:54:55.731 --> 00:55:00.260
fucking little briefcases.
He's sitting at the end of a long table,

886
00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:03.920
you know,
with his elbows on the table and all fingertips touching each other.

887
00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:09.950
And uh,
how do you plan to make my dick some money this week?
Anyway,
so he goes,

888
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:13.100
so I asked if he was okay with it.

889
00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:18.760
His eyes started getting all watery and face got red and that vein in the

890
00:55:18.891 --> 00:55:20.300
forehead starts popping.

891
00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:24.410
He says it fucks him up every time he thinks about it.

892
00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:28.910
But it also turned him onto a whole different level.

893
00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:32.960
I asked what the,
he still want to be married to her.

894
00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:36.350
He said he doesn't know and excused himself.

895
00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:37.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>

896
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:40.590
<v 0>I asked what her vision behind this whole shit was.</v>

897
00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:45.620
And apparently she takes pleasure to see him jealous and can't do anything about

898
00:55:45.781 --> 00:55:49.660
it.
She likes the whole watching him,
watching her,

899
00:55:49.661 --> 00:55:53.760
her being fucked by a man or a woman.
She doesn't want to hurt him.

900
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.190
So she lets him in on the action.

901
00:55:56.191 --> 00:55:59.220
But she loves this swinging type of shit a lot more.

902
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:02.970
Oh my God.
So wait a minute,
see,
you did it

903
00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:06.990
right dude.
You,
you're writing,

904
00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:10.290
you're leaving out words here and you make an a dumb guy sound even worse here

905
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:12.200
may go back about a week later,

906
00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:15.750
chicken invited me to the house to prepare a presentation and I asked to do it

907
00:56:15.751 --> 00:56:18.570
if he was okay with everything that happened,
all my fault.

908
00:56:18.571 --> 00:56:21.090
I read it wrong or I wasn't listening my,

909
00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:24.310
as I was talking because I was so nervous about fucking up the next sentence.

910
00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:29.440
Oh my God,
dude,

911
00:56:29.441 --> 00:56:33.740
what the fuck is wrong with you that you went back?
You know,

912
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:38.450
like you're doing some followup survey.
This whole thing is weird.

913
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:43.760
So when he goes,
well,
let's just say things were awesome in my shoes,

914
00:56:43.761 --> 00:56:47.150
but I felt a little bad that they broke up.
Dude,
you know what you did?

915
00:56:47.151 --> 00:56:49.370
You just saved a fucking soul.

916
00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:53.390
The soul that the two of them were going to fucking make.
Okay,

917
00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:57.040
that's so we'll go into a fucking different person.
I don't,

918
00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:59.230
I don't know how it works.
I'm not a religious guy,
but yeah,

919
00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:04.100
you just stopped a kid from being brought into the world by a,

920
00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:08.150
by a couple of fucking people who need to go to therapy,
I think.

921
00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:13.250
I guess I'm judging.
I don't know what those aren't parents.
Anyways,

922
00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:14.740
funny thing is he still come,

923
00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:19.900
he still goes over to fucker and another partner sometimes even another couple

924
00:57:21.021 --> 00:57:24.500
partners swapping thing.
Basically swinger fuck buddies.
Oh yeah.
Well,

925
00:57:24.501 --> 00:57:28.610
you open Pandora's box now.
No Pun intended.
Now it's no biggie.
Damn.

926
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:32.270
He goes,
I wouldn't call them freaks.
They're awesome people,

927
00:57:32.271 --> 00:57:36.620
but this type of shit doesn't usually work out for the best and relationships,

928
00:57:36.621 --> 00:57:41.480
let alone a marriage,
excuse my bad grammar and poor descriptive skills.
Well,

929
00:57:41.481 --> 00:57:43.550
you know what?
You should have started your email with that.

930
00:57:43.551 --> 00:57:46.580
So everyone wouldn't think that it was me.
Wow,
man.

931
00:57:46.581 --> 00:57:48.890
I've never been involved in any,
any shit like that.

932
00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.830
I never had a threesome or anything.
I think I could've had to,

933
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:56.030
I'd said this before,
one of them.
I was so young and stupid.

934
00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:58.280
I was actually annoyed with the other girl going,

935
00:57:58.281 --> 00:58:02.090
why won't she fucking leave so I can bang her friend?
You know,

936
00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.370
I didn't get that she was lingering around.
Uh,

937
00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:07.400
that one kills me because they both fucking great looking.

938
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:10.670
And then the other one was,
was a layup,

939
00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:14.730
but one was fucking gorgeous and the other one looked like a god damn

940
00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:16.213
refrigerator.

941
00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:25.670
She was like fucking six to one of those rich people refrigerators.

942
00:58:25.671 --> 00:58:28.460
You know what I mean?
That's just built into the fucking wall.

943
00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:31.340
That's what she looked like.
And it's just like,
I,
you know,

944
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:36.260
I would need one of those,
like some rock climbing shit.

945
00:58:36.261 --> 00:58:39.470
Take fucking handle that one.
So I gracefully bowed out of that.

946
00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:44.930
Um,
yeah,
that's,
that's an an entire,
let me ask you this,
sir.

947
00:58:44.931 --> 00:58:48.950
Do you live in Atlanta?
I always get that fucking freak vibe in Atlanta.

948
00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:53.740
Anyways,
here we go.
Philosophy workshop.
I'm doing F,
uh,

949
00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:57.760
philosophy workshop this summer called rape jokes and other offensive,

950
00:58:57.770 --> 00:59:01.160
what is with all these fucking babbling about rape jokes.

951
00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:05.450
I swear to fucking Christ.
I go to comedy clubs all the time.

952
00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:10.070
Like you making it seem like every five seconds somebody talks about it,

953
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:13.610
you know,
he's fucking idiot bloggers.

954
00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:18.230
Blogging about what kind of fucking Joe do you understand how fucking dumb that

955
00:59:18.231 --> 00:59:19.040
is?

956
00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:22.670
That's like if you played guitar and you start blogging about what chords people

957
00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:27.170
should and shouldn't use.
Good fucking little.
It's,
it's,

958
00:59:28.290 --> 00:59:30.770
it's not even frustrating.
It's just,
it's bizarre.

959
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:35.510
It's really bizarre and I've yet to see anybody,
I dunno,

960
00:59:37.350 --> 00:59:41.130
anybody that's kind of doing anything or who's considered funny that's really

961
00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:44.340
don't want to around telling people what they should talk about.
I would say,

962
00:59:44.370 --> 00:59:45.720
why don't you work on your own act?

963
00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:47.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

964
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:51.260
<v 0>You know,
you don't like rape jokes.
Don't do any,</v>

965
00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:56.490
I don't like country music.
I would never say don't do fucking country music.

966
00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:01.750
It's bizarre.
The whole fucking,
it's the whole thing is just fucking,
you know,

967
01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:04.020
I'm going to stop talking about this because I'm just going to add fuel to the

968
01:00:04.021 --> 01:00:08.550
fire.
Um,
let's just blow through these dumb questions here.

969
01:00:08.551 --> 01:00:11.100
Can people be inappropriately offended?
If so,

970
01:00:11.101 --> 01:00:14.820
how do we draw the line between a pro?
This is so fucking stupid.

971
01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:19.400
Don't go to a comedy club.
Oh my God.

972
01:00:19.401 --> 01:00:23.390
I went to the pool and I got wet.
Is there a way to make the pool dryer,

973
01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:27.170
um,
how wet is too wet,

974
01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:30.830
is being offended or moral response?
If,
what kind of response,

975
01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.390
if you're morally wrong,

976
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:36.530
someone is appropriate for you to feel guilt.

977
01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:39.620
Who is,
it's just one of these bloggers who wrote this.

978
01:00:39.621 --> 01:00:42.380
I find that whole thing unbelievably childish and silly.

979
01:00:42.381 --> 01:00:44.690
I'm not even going to get even any fucking time of day.

980
01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:46.163
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

981
01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:47.570
<v 0>What about chickens?</v>

982
01:00:47.571 --> 01:00:52.400
What about the chickens who died when you're talking about eating a chicken BLT.

983
01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:58.920
Um,
anyways,
plowing ahead here.
Uh,

984
01:00:58.950 --> 01:01:01.140
met girl last week of school.
Hey Bill.

985
01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:04.980
This past weekend I made out with this girl I've been talking to with school

986
01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:05.881
since then.

987
01:01:05.881 --> 01:01:10.080
We've been talking nonstop and I really like her and I think she likes me.
Oh,

988
01:01:10.081 --> 01:01:11.220
is it?
This is nice,

989
01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:15.720
but in a little more than a week we will both be graduating.

990
01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:19.110
She lives in Philly and I live right outside of New York.

991
01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:24.130
Well you can kiss that pussy goodbye.
Sorry.
That was me.
All right.

992
01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:26.940
She's really cool and different than all the other girls at school.

993
01:01:26.941 --> 01:01:28.860
I'm just wondering what you think I should do.

994
01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:31.980
This upcoming week is senior senior week.
You know what?

995
01:01:31.981 --> 01:01:34.500
I shouldn't have said that you actually liked this girl.
I apologize.

996
01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:38.730
I'm an idiot.
Um,
this up,
I'm going to treat it with respect for the rest of this.

997
01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:39.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

998
01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.950
<v 0>For the rest of this fucking email.
Um,
this upcoming week is senior week,</v>

999
01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:47.370
a week full of drinking and nonstop partying until graduation.

1000
01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:49.370
I know we're going to be hanging out all weekend.

1001
01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:52.860
I just want to get your thoughts on what I should do after graduation.

1002
01:01:52.861 --> 01:01:56.910
I really liked her.
She's pretty smart and isn't a lot of the same stuff I am.

1003
01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.930
Any who,
thanks for everything big fanny of you and the podcast.

1004
01:02:00.931 --> 01:02:04.740
And I just watched standup guys.
Hilarious.
Oh,
thank you.
Uh,

1005
01:02:04.741 --> 01:02:08.790
that sound you make when you get shot made me laugh so hard.
Yeah.
Got Shot there.

1006
01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:12.620
You're not going to make a graceful noise.
Um,

1007
01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:15.240
all right.
Where,
where are we going here?

1008
01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:18.990
What do we do it,
you know what?

1009
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:24.040
You're at that time when your life where you have to figure this shit out.
Um,

1010
01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:26.340
you can't ask.
Someone is old and is jaded,

1011
01:02:26.341 --> 01:02:28.740
is made because you heard what I said right out of the,
out of the gate.

1012
01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:32.070
It was fucking insensitive and it was mean.

1013
01:02:32.071 --> 01:02:36.660
And it had nothing to do with you or the wonderful woman that you're dating.

1014
01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:41.060
It had to do with me and the train wreck of my fucking dating career.
All right,

1015
01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:45.480
so there's your lesson.
Is your lesson something that I learned,
uh,

1016
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:47.670
top Papa taught me this one.
Anytime he said,

1017
01:02:47.671 --> 01:02:50.730
anytime we make a big decision in my life and I tell people about it,

1018
01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:55.910
I realized that most of the time their reaction has nothing to do with what I'm

1019
01:02:56.011 --> 01:03:00.690
doing.
It has everything to do with them.
So I say,
look,
if you liked this girl,

1020
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:02.470
<v 1>okay.</v>

1021
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:05.020
<v 0>You know it's the long distance thing is really hard.</v>

1022
01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:08.290
You're going to go to the both going are you guys are both going at different

1023
01:03:08.291 --> 01:03:08.951
colleges.

1024
01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:13.870
I mean it's like a fucking nightclub and just all these single people,

1025
01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.310
bye call.
You're never going to be in a greater nightclub than college.

1026
01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:21.850
And it's just a shame that when you're going through it,
you don't realize it.

1027
01:03:21.851 --> 01:03:25.270
It's just you have the pick of the litter.
You know?

1028
01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:28.880
The problem is is you're,
you're,
you're,
I dunno you,

1029
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:30.610
you want all these experiences,

1030
01:03:30.611 --> 01:03:32.440
you're just getting out from underneath your parents.

1031
01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.540
They should really have college.

1032
01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:38.410
Like when you're 25 26 all right.

1033
01:03:38.411 --> 01:03:41.530
And just make it illegal to get married until then,
you know,

1034
01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:44.650
it just kind of have a good time figuring out what the fuck you want.

1035
01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:48.370
Then you go to college and he got these year pick up all these fucking people.

1036
01:03:48.610 --> 01:03:51.490
Maybe not 26 by then.
You're a little bit,
I dunno,

1037
01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:53.770
it's just everybody kind of in the prime of their life.

1038
01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:55.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1039
01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:59.630
<v 0>Before they get jaded and that type of shit.
So I w you know what I would do,
sir?</v>

1040
01:03:59.631 --> 01:04:03.290
I would follow your heart.
That's my advice.
And I wouldn't listen to old,

1041
01:04:03.291 --> 01:04:07.370
grizzled asshole like myself.
All right,
good luck to you.
I hope it all works out.

1042
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:12.650
Um,
yeah,
you follow your heart.
You'll never be wrong.
You can still get hurt,

1043
01:04:12.651 --> 01:04:17.300
but you're not wrong because everybody hurts.
Sorry,

1044
01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:22.420
I'm wife is getting heavy.
Oh,
Jesus.
Dare BuildCo

1045
01:04:25.310 --> 01:04:26.143
first.

1046
01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:32.680
<v 1>Uh,
Shit.</v>

1047
01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:36.120
<v 0>I didn't get that.
That's fucking hilarious.
I didn't,</v>

1048
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:39.020
I read it and it didn't make sense to look.
Came out of my mind.

1049
01:04:39.021 --> 01:04:42.250
Saw Doe doe like Dole would dare.
I was like,
what is he calling me?

1050
01:04:42.251 --> 01:04:46.570
A fucking Bambi or something.
I didn't get it.
Oh my God.

1051
01:04:46.571 --> 01:04:51.040
That's fucking funny.
Um,
I love the podcast.
You stay,

1052
01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.130
the best guests are Rogan,
Yada,
Yada.
Right?

1053
01:04:54.131 --> 01:04:59.131
I'm a 26 year old fellow from Maine due to tie the knot in October with my lady

1054
01:05:01.451 --> 01:05:04.590
of seven years and we have a great relationship and a very happy what?

1055
01:05:04.591 --> 01:05:08.830
Congratulations,
sir.
You've hit the lottery.
You live in God's country.
You know,

1056
01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:11.710
you got yourself a great woman,
you got a great start here.

1057
01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:16.390
Where is the left turn coming?
Everybody?
Let's continue reading.

1058
01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:20.380
She's smart and it didn't take shit from no one.

1059
01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:24.970
She is,
uh,
stuck with me,
supported me through my oxy,

1060
01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:29.440
caught in addiction of course.
Fucking made,

1061
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:32.720
you know what I was going to do.
I had a small part in a movie.
I was good.

1062
01:05:32.721 --> 01:05:37.090
It was going to do something called blue potato last September and it didn't,

1063
01:05:37.091 --> 01:05:40.240
the dates didn't end up working out and it was all about the oxy problem up

1064
01:05:40.241 --> 01:05:42.640
there in Maine.
Um,

1065
01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:47.140
so look for that movie because the fucking script was great.
There you go.

1066
01:05:47.141 --> 01:05:50.680
There's a little inside Hollywood shit.
All right,
here we go.
Um,

1067
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:52.030
she helped me get through my,

1068
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:56.650
through helped me get throughout what my mom died.

1069
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:58.100
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1070
01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:01.680
<v 0>All right.
This guy did some oxy and when he was doing the oxy,</v>

1071
01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:05.460
he did not take a spelling class.
All right,
let's,
let's back up here.

1072
01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:09.450
Help me get through.
When my mom died,
she's stuck with me.

1073
01:06:09.451 --> 01:06:13.050
It helped me raise and support my niece from the time she was born til present.

1074
01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:14.760
Oh yeah,
this girl's a champ.

1075
01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:15.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1076
01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:20.730
<v 0>My niece is now almost four and now helping me support be jumping back and forth</v>

1077
01:06:21.251 --> 01:06:24.280
here,
sir.
So now this wonderful woman,
we're going to help you out here.

1078
01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:28.630
He's now helping me support my father who can't work due to him dying with

1079
01:06:28.631 --> 01:06:33.130
multiple melanoma marrow cancer,
bone marrow cancer.

1080
01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:37.810
Jesus Christ.
Uh,
not melanoma.

1081
01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:41.860
Myeloma bone cancer.
I don't know how to read that word,
sir.

1082
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:43.743
Oh Jesus.

1083
01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.380
They'll just get to the end of this fucking thing so we can all stop staring

1084
01:06:47.381 --> 01:06:51.010
awkwardly down at our pen and pencil set.
Okay guys,
here we go.

1085
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:55.120
All of this while holding a full time job and going to college to be a

1086
01:06:55.121 --> 01:06:59.410
psychological nurse.
Psychological nurse.
Okay.
A bill.

1087
01:06:59.411 --> 01:07:02.380
She is an angel and I don't know what I would do without it,

1088
01:07:02.381 --> 01:07:05.650
but I have one little problem over the last few years she's been putting on the

1089
01:07:05.651 --> 01:07:09.430
pounds.
She loves to eat.
I,
dude,

1090
01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:12.250
I read in the beginning of this wife is getting heavy and I'm like,

1091
01:07:12.251 --> 01:07:16.150
where's the left turn?
I have the memory of a fucking ant

1092
01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:22.690
Jesus Christ.
Bill,
stop talking on the cell phone.
Anyways.
Yeah,

1093
01:07:22.691 --> 01:07:24.640
she's been putting out the pound.
She loves to eat.

1094
01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:27.100
I guess she stresses out with everything,

1095
01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:29.650
but she's gained a lot of weight in the last three years.

1096
01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:32.410
I'm talking at least 80 pounds.
Don't you can't have that.

1097
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:37.330
Can't have that 80 pounds.
I mean,
she's almost morbidly obese.

1098
01:07:37.331 --> 01:07:40.120
A hundred pounds is like morbidly obese.
30 pounds is obese,

1099
01:07:40.121 --> 01:07:44.230
so she's going to fucking die.
Uh,
anyways,
he's go.

1100
01:07:44.231 --> 01:07:46.990
It got to the point where she almost weighed more than me and I'm not a small

1101
01:07:46.991 --> 01:07:49.960
guy,
six feet to 40 but in,
in shape for the most part,

1102
01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:54.130
I've got at least five inches height on her and only way 10 to 15 pounds more

1103
01:07:54.131 --> 01:07:58.480
than her.
I'm not,
it's not making me not want to tie the knot with her,

1104
01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.250
but if we're going to do it for the long haul,

1105
01:08:00.251 --> 01:08:04.120
I don't want it to have a heart attack at the age of 40.
How do I bring this up?

1106
01:08:04.450 --> 01:08:07.750
Because as all men,
no,
you don't bring up a woman's weight.
Uh,

1107
01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:11.620
helped me dollar dollar bills.
All right.
I'll tell you,

1108
01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:15.710
this is how you do it.
You need to lose weight,
right?

1109
01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:19.730
All right?
How do you do this?

1110
01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:23.960
What you got to do is you bring her into the fold by talking about your own

1111
01:08:23.961 --> 01:08:26.300
shortcomings with you.
You,
you know,

1112
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:29.570
whatever weight problem you have,

1113
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:34.280
because what you just six feet to 40,
you know,

1114
01:08:34.570 --> 01:08:37.940
till you could stand to lose a good 25 30 yourself,
you know,

1115
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:42.590
get down to that to 15 to 10.
You know,

1116
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:47.000
you guys are getting married.
Just say,
you know what?
Let's fucking,
uh,
you know,

1117
01:08:47.001 --> 01:08:50.660
watch one of those late night.
Thanks.
And just get her into it.
You know,

1118
01:08:50.661 --> 01:08:55.630
what is what you do first.
I got it.
This is what I would do with her.
Uh,

1119
01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.580
you've got all your,
you're living up there in Maine.
It's absolutely gorgeous.

1120
01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:03.080
Just say you want to take her on a picnic.
She likes food.
All right,

1121
01:09:03.081 --> 01:09:05.070
well you don't say,
is this going to be a mile long hike?

1122
01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:09.931
Oh,

1123
01:09:09.931 --> 01:09:14.931
it's geoboards a picnic basket and he got Brussels sprouts in there right now.

1124
01:09:15.291 --> 01:09:16.440
You can't do it like that.
But I,

1125
01:09:16.441 --> 01:09:21.441
I would start enjoying the outdoors more and I would get into some activities.

1126
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:26.450
And what I would do is I'm

1127
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:30.110
just slowly,
if you guys are living together,

1128
01:09:30.111 --> 01:09:34.940
just start introducing healthier fucking foods into the fridge and the cabinets

1129
01:09:34.941 --> 01:09:36.050
and toss and other shit.

1130
01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:40.760
And I'm just see how that works.

1131
01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:45.110
And if she calls you on it,
you just got to come clean.

1132
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:49.100
Just say,
honey,
I love you to death.
You're the woman of my dreams.

1133
01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:53.900
I want to marry you.
And the last thing I ever want to do is hurt you.

1134
01:09:53.901 --> 01:09:58.340
And I just don't know how to bring up then I'm concerned that I'm going to lose

1135
01:09:58.341 --> 01:10:01.520
you.
And she'll be like,
what are you talking about?

1136
01:10:01.521 --> 01:10:03.860
And if you just bring it up at the fact that you concern that you're going to

1137
01:10:03.861 --> 01:10:06.740
lose her someday,
um,

1138
01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:10.500
and you bring it into the weight thing and then when she cries or whatever,
blah,

1139
01:10:10.501 --> 01:10:12.740
blah holder,
tell her you love her and just say,
listen,

1140
01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:17.600
I got to lose some weight too.
You helped me through the oxy thing.
All right,

1141
01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.750
to the point,
I'm kind of paunchy right now.
Let's,

1142
01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.590
let's get our weight down for these kids we don't have yet.
You know,

1143
01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:29.000
just do that.
Try that.
I'll see.
See how that fucking works.

1144
01:10:29.001 --> 01:10:33.470
And if it blows up in your face,
I apologize.
But I got to tell you that,
that,

1145
01:10:33.471 --> 01:10:36.470
that hiking thinks a little sneaky,
you know,

1146
01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:41.120
start going for walks.
If you hold their hand,

1147
01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:43.430
they don't notice that they're hiking,
you know,

1148
01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:51.020
that's what you do.
Hold her hand and hold her hand and then have,

1149
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:54.080
have a guitar that you go fucking acoustic guitar,

1150
01:10:54.081 --> 01:10:57.230
you gotta thrown around your back,
like you're going to serenade her.

1151
01:10:57.830 --> 01:11:00.110
And she would just be so blown away.
She won't notice it.

1152
01:11:00.111 --> 01:11:04.190
You walk three miles up a mountain,
you know,
and then when you get up there,

1153
01:11:04.191 --> 01:11:07.850
you just,
you sing that the bear went over and I'm out

1154
01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:11.840
and all that ain't could say

1155
01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:18.300
I'm sorry girlfriend going to Vegas alone.

1156
01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.190
Oh God.

1157
01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:21.280
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1158
01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:26.180
<v 0>Oh,
it's Joe to Rosa says you hate to see it.
Ah,
you hate to see it.</v>

1159
01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:29.320
I got to have him.
I'm going to be getting one in New York next week.

1160
01:11:29.321 --> 01:11:32.380
I should have on the podcast next week.
I should really do that.
I'm gonna,

1161
01:11:32.381 --> 01:11:33.580
I'm gonna reach out to Joe.
You know,

1162
01:11:33.581 --> 01:11:36.670
I'm actually gonna reach out to his people and see if they can get in touch with

1163
01:11:36.671 --> 01:11:40.840
Joe.
He's just finishing the European leg of his latest,
uh,

1164
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:43.840
his latest CD.
Smash it.

1165
01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:46.960
What was it called?
Something personal,

1166
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:49.630
I believe is what he put it out as anyways,

1167
01:11:49.631 --> 01:11:53.140
my girlfriend of two years and I have a great relationship.

1168
01:11:53.170 --> 01:11:56.260
We're in our thirties and get along better than anyone I've dated before.

1169
01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:00.790
I have no complaints.
You guys always start the shit like guys go,

1170
01:12:00.791 --> 01:12:05.020
is this like a fucking lover?
She's fucking gray.
But you know,
she has a Dick.

1171
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:08.620
All right.
He goes,
I have no complaint with the way things are going.

1172
01:12:08.621 --> 01:12:12.010
Neither of us are looking at marriage in the future.
She's divorced.

1173
01:12:12.011 --> 01:12:15.010
It doesn't want to try again.
And I've never intended to get married.

1174
01:12:15.011 --> 01:12:18.970
Well then what?
You guys are fuck buddies.
He goes,

1175
01:12:18.971 --> 01:12:21.820
we just enjoy each other's company and I couldn't be happy with her.

1176
01:12:22.330 --> 01:12:23.163
Here's the thing,

1177
01:12:23.170 --> 01:12:27.400
she still gets the urge to go out and dance to blow off some steam sometime,

1178
01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:30.550
but I avoid it.
It's not that I don't know how to dance,

1179
01:12:30.551 --> 01:12:34.300
but let's just say that I partied my way through college and in Marsing myself

1180
01:12:34.301 --> 01:12:37.600
in that scene again only gets me into trouble with those mood enhancing

1181
01:12:37.601 --> 01:12:40.510
substances.
Uh,
she's got a great job and I'm like,

1182
01:12:40.511 --> 01:12:44.800
we can afford to go on a little vacation.
She picked Vegas and no,

1183
01:12:44.801 --> 01:12:47.200
I'm not the least bit worried about her banging some other dude.

1184
01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:50.830
She's into the ladies.
Oh,
she is.

1185
01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:54.790
And has an unwavering per and as my unwavering permission to go out and have her

1186
01:12:54.791 --> 01:12:57.040
fun with them.
As long as she's safe about it.

1187
01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.470
The threesome has always been on the table in the past,

1188
01:12:59.471 --> 01:13:04.040
but I honestly think I'd opt out just so we don't have the potential for a

1189
01:13:04.041 --> 01:13:07.810
jealousy to show its face in our relationship.
Yes,
that's a smart move.

1190
01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:12.730
Watching is good enough for me.
Uh,
anyway,
back to the issue at hand.

1191
01:13:12.731 --> 01:13:16.060
I have no issues with her going,
but I'm worried that I'm not fulfilled,

1192
01:13:16.150 --> 01:13:20.640
fulfilling her need to go out and party.
That's what I was going to say.
Um,

1193
01:13:20.710 --> 01:13:23.170
I was actually gonna suggest that he said,

1194
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:24.610
<v 1>okay,</v>

1195
01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:25.211
<v 0>let me go back here.</v>

1196
01:13:25.211 --> 01:13:29.140
I'm not fulfilling your need to go out and party at the club every so often and

1197
01:13:29.141 --> 01:13:31.300
don't want it to build into a serious problem.

1198
01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:33.160
She doesn't go clubbing on the regular.

1199
01:13:33.161 --> 01:13:36.100
This is her first time doing anything like this since we started dating.

1200
01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.510
Do I need to grow the fuck up,

1201
01:13:37.511 --> 01:13:42.160
put my past behind me and start taking my lady out to the club or I just let her

1202
01:13:42.161 --> 01:13:43.600
keep going out on our own.

1203
01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:46.900
I think it's perfectly normal for two people in relationship to have activities

1204
01:13:46.901 --> 01:13:49.740
that they do on their own.
I'm into outdoor sports that she gets.

1205
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:54.040
She's into going dancing.
We both need our adrenaline source,
uh,

1206
01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:55.990
outside of our great sex life together.

1207
01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:59.770
She says she's not planning on hooking up with a lady while she's out there.

1208
01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:02.260
And I wouldn't care either way,
but I am setting my,

1209
01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:05.740
but am I setting myself up for failure in the future?

1210
01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:10.480
Not taking her out myself or do I just let her go and let her have her fun?
Uh,

1211
01:14:10.481 --> 01:14:13.960
I would tell what you told me.
Just say,
listen,

1212
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:18.280
I did the party scene in college in College.
No,
start with saying like,
listen,

1213
01:14:18.281 --> 01:14:21.460
I'm worried that because they don't take you out dancing eventually that's going

1214
01:14:21.461 --> 01:14:24.680
to lead to x,
y,
and Z.
Um,

1215
01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:27.010
and I have to tell you that the reason why I take you out,

1216
01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.170
it's not because the reason I don't take you,

1217
01:14:29.171 --> 01:14:30.580
I was not because I don't want to take you out.

1218
01:14:30.581 --> 01:14:34.600
It's because I did the college partying scene and I'm worried that if I go into

1219
01:14:34.601 --> 01:14:37.900
that scene again,
I'm getting getting in trouble with,
you know,

1220
01:14:37.901 --> 01:14:40.530
whatever drugs you were using,
you know,

1221
01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:44.170
so much of this relationship shit is just fucking taking a deep breath and just

1222
01:14:44.171 --> 01:14:46.210
saying,
you know,

1223
01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:50.820
saying why you're doing whatever the fuck it is that you're doing.
And uh,

1224
01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:52.720
you know,
you can't fuck with honesty.

1225
01:14:54.910 --> 01:14:56.110
I mean you can be upset by it.

1226
01:14:59.710 --> 01:15:04.570
I want to fuck your friend there.
It's out there.
All right,
here we go.

1227
01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:09.370
Third break.
Oh my God.
Hour and 15 minutes.
You guys got your money's worth,
Huh?

1228
01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:15.190
Here we go.
Personal capital,
everybody.
Two things suck about managing your money.

1229
01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:20.110
It's hard to keep track of.
You got stocks,
bonds,
four o one k IRA,

1230
01:15:20.111 --> 01:15:21.580
bank accounts,
et cetera.

1231
01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:24.790
All on different sites with their own username and password.

1232
01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:29.350
They literally just described my financial situation and every month I get like

1233
01:15:29.351 --> 01:15:34.300
19 statements and I look at them and I rubbed my chin and I can't tell which end

1234
01:15:34.301 --> 01:15:37.570
is up.
So anyways,
they say here,

1235
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:42.130
then you pay someone to manage it.
And you're probably paying too much.
All right.

1236
01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.800
That's why you got to love personal capital.

1237
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:46.960
It takes under a minute to set this up.

1238
01:15:46.961 --> 01:15:51.310
Just go to the podcast page on billboard.com and click the personal capital

1239
01:15:51.311 --> 01:15:52.000
banner.

1240
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.230
Then you can see your whole net worth and how each asset is performing on one

1241
01:15:56.231 --> 01:16:00.700
screen,
on your computer or through their app on your phone or tablet.

1242
01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.110
It doesn't get easier than that.

1243
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:06.370
Then it shows you how much you're paying money managers and brokers and fees and

1244
01:16:06.371 --> 01:16:10.060
how you can reduce those fees and even gives you specific areas where you can

1245
01:16:10.061 --> 01:16:12.640
improve your investment strategies.
So in other words,

1246
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:17.140
the entire operation is transparent the exact way you want it to be when you're

1247
01:16:17.141 --> 01:16:20.860
dealing with your money and this thing is really is a really smart way to grow

1248
01:16:20.861 --> 01:16:22.570
you and make your,
excuse me,

1249
01:16:22.571 --> 01:16:26.900
this is thing is a really smart way to make your money make,
oh,

1250
01:16:26.901 --> 01:16:28.030
this is a typo here.

1251
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:32.020
This thing is a really smart way to make your money grow quicker.

1252
01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:35.290
It's one by former,
the former CEO of paypal,

1253
01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:37.960
and it's totally free to sign up for free.

1254
01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:43.080
Go to the podcast page on billboard.com and click on the personal capital

1255
01:16:43.151 --> 01:16:46.990
banner.
There you were.
And finally,

1256
01:16:47.290 --> 01:16:51.940
Father's day is around the corner.
What does that mean?
This father's Day?

1257
01:16:51.970 --> 01:16:54.520
What are you going to be thinking?
You've got to think the man.
Great.

1258
01:16:54.970 --> 01:16:59.650
What is the main gray you ask?
They are 100% made in America.

1259
01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:04.570
Cast iron grilling greats that are revolutionizing the way people grill heavy

1260
01:17:04.571 --> 01:17:05.620
duty grilling greats.

1287
01:18:44.571 --> 01:18:48.590
Everybody.
Um,
I hope you guys have been enjoying the NHL playoffs.

1288
01:18:48.591 --> 01:18:52.070
I know I talk about him a lot,
but,
uh,
they're really starting to get great.

1289
01:18:52.071 --> 01:18:55.190
I haven't watched any of the,
uh,
out the west,
but,
uh,

1290
01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.780
I love what the La Kings are doing.

1291
01:18:57.530 --> 01:19:00.530
There's nothing I love seeing better than when when a,

1292
01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:05.370
when a team that knows how to win just,
just,
just flips the switch.
It's,

1293
01:19:05.371 --> 01:19:08.420
it's a,
it's an incredible thing to watch.
It really is.
I haven't been,

1294
01:19:08.530 --> 01:19:10.850
haven't been watching it,
but I've been watching the results of their games.

1295
01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:15.010
The fucking guys do.
What do they do?
They lost two to one,

1296
01:19:15.011 --> 01:19:17.330
a road of the blues then came back when the last four,

1297
01:19:17.331 --> 01:19:21.980
they won the first two against,
uh,
the shots in and the sharks won in overtime.

1298
01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:26.740
But,
um,
that's my dark horse,
uh,

1299
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:30.320
out west for taking out the,
uh,
you know,

1300
01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.390
the winner of the Black Hawks red winks.

1301
01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:36.350
Obviously the favorite is the black hawks.
He got to,
the kings are a very,

1302
01:19:36.351 --> 01:19:40.010
very dangerous tape and I'm obviously loving how the Bruins are playing,

1303
01:19:40.011 --> 01:19:42.470
but I got to tell you,
the penguins have so much talent,

1304
01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:47.390
but the goaltending is shaky.
That's their Achilles heel there,

1305
01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:48.913
you know?

1306
01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:52.370
And you know why they still have Achilles heel because Matt Cook plays for him.

1307
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:54.890
So he didn't slice it off with his skate accidentally.

1308
01:19:58.470 --> 01:20:01.980
Oh,
by the way,
Phil Jackson,
I got to gloat here.
It's a little gloating moment.

1309
01:20:01.981 --> 01:20:03.090
At the end of the podcast,

1310
01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:07.830
Phil Jackson wrote a book and at some interesting things to say,
Colby.

1311
01:20:07.831 --> 01:20:12.060
So I just want to ask Laker fans,
uh,
is he,
is he also a hater?

1312
01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:15.720
He won five championships with that guy.
You know,

1313
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:20.040
and if you read between the lines of what Phil Jackson writes in his book about

1314
01:20:20.041 --> 01:20:24.780
Colby,
all right,
you'll basically have exactly what the fuck I've been saying.

1315
01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:27.750
All right,
so there you go.

1316
01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:32.100
I fucking called it just like Paul Versey.
Ah,
that's it.

1317
01:20:32.101 --> 01:20:34.260
That's the podcast for this week.
Once again,

1318
01:20:34.261 --> 01:20:38.130
thank you to everybody who came out to the Mirage a casino and thank you to the

1319
01:20:38.131 --> 01:20:41.400
Mirage casino and everybody out in Vegas.
That really was a dream come true.

1320
01:20:41.850 --> 01:20:46.850
And to perform at such a legendary casino and have all those people come out and

1321
01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:50.190
got treated like a fucking king there.

1322
01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:53.940
And we're actually hoping that that's going to be my home base.

1323
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:57.130
And I can come out there because of the turnover,
because every day,
I don't know,

1324
01:20:57.160 --> 01:21:02.020
100,000,
200,000 people leave on.
Now the 200,000 come in.
Um,

1325
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:06.240
I'm really hoping that,
um,
that can become my home away from home.

1326
01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:08.910
That's what we're going to be working towards.
So,

1327
01:21:08.911 --> 01:21:12.090
