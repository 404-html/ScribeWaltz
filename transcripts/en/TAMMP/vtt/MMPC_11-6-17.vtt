00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.110
Hey,
what's going on in his bill?
Burn.

2
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:07.050
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,
November six,

3
00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:10.470
2017 what's going on?
How are you?

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.200
How are you doing?
No,
really,
seriously.
Are you okay?

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.150
I've been thinking about you.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.110
Is there anything worse when you don't want someone to like,
you know,

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.110
if you don't want to talk about your fucking troubles and then there's that

8
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:29.790
overly caring person in your life that notices them and yet they're like,

9
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:32.820
you know,
what's,
what's going on with the,
Oh,
I'm cool.
I'm good.
I'm good.
No,

10
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:33.750
seriously.

11
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:38.220
You seem there's just picking up something on your energy.
Is it,

12
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.900
what do you even fucking Star Trek.
Yeah,
he read my mind,
you know?
I mean,

13
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:43.734
you're right.

14
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.940
I don't need you was a non fucking,
uh,

15
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.550
psychiatrist walking around my brain.

16
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.080
Everybody thinks they're a fucking qualified because they watched a couple

17
00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:02.400
episodes of Dr Phil and he makes it look so easy for the simple fact that the

18
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:05.130
man does not give a shit.
Okay.

19
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:08.100
He's here for one reason only.
All right.

20
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.840
It's for the Ou is after the show.
You know,

21
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.230
that's why he has that fucking angry.

22
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.520
Ever seen a guy helping more people with such like a fucking angry look on his

23
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:21.960
face.
Um,
you know,

24
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:25.380
I got the chief's fucking cowboys game on in the background.

25
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.690
How many times does this special team fuck up a free lunch when the punch or

26
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:34.620
kicks it right down to the one yard line?
Eh,
they're just the worst.

27
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.930
The guy fucking did it through.

28
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:40.440
Everybody wants to be the guy that does it and then they fucking fumbled the

29
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:43.860
ball into the end zone.
And what happens?

30
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.900
The punter takes the head and in,

31
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:49.290
rather than him having a 41 yard fucking average for the game,

32
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.740
it moves down to 38 right?
And the second day see that three.

33
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.020
All of a sudden they want to move you to another team.

34
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.430
Nobody ain't nobody ever looks at the nameless [inaudible] that run down the

35
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:02.070
fucking field,
the wedge breakers,
all of them,
right?

36
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.630
The guys that nobody has talked about since John Madden,
stop announcing games.

37
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.230
They'd go down there and consistently fuck that play up.
Uh,

38
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.930
this has nothing to do with NFL.

39
00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:17.280
Special teams to says nothing to do with people asking me,
how are you doing?

40
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.440
Is Everything good?
You look good.
But I sense of sadness.

41
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.970
It's just like,
can you just
chicken?

42
00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:29.680
You just fucking let me sit here.

43
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.533
<v 0>All right,</v>

44
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.990
<v 1>wait,
I'm ready to talk about this.</v>

45
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.370
It's like this isn't yours to talk about,
right.

46
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.190
Anyways.
Um,
can I say anyways,
one more fucking time?

47
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.730
My last podcast I left you,
I was at the Surf Ball run,

48
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.500
right?
Chantilly lace Santa Brady face a bone.
Right.

49
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.930
<v 2>Hanging down or we're wig to land,
a walk and the</v>

50
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.510
<v 1>giggling I was there,
make the world go pow.
Wow.
Wow,
wow.</v>

51
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.740
And the next day I was flying air choice one

52
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.410
<v 3>okay.</v>

53
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.400
<v 1>To Chicago.</v>

54
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.660
And then I was taking another puddle jumper up to 'em.

55
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.980
What the hell was it?
Milwaukee.
Right.
So me and Dean del Rey,

56
00:03:21.981 --> 00:03:24.230
we show up.
We had like the greatest fucking night ever.

57
00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:28.010
We stayed at this hotel that was designed by Frank Lloyd Webber.

58
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.390
Amazing hotel.
So we drive up to the airport,
the airport,

59
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.530
the Mason City Airport.
It's just the quiet one of the greatest thing ever.

60
00:03:36.531 --> 00:03:39.410
I want to,
I'm going to upload some pictures.
You walk in this,

61
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.390
this probably 12 chairs for people in the waiting room and you go through this

62
00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:48.650
little security area.
I love little airports,
little mom and pop airports.

63
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.610
I get up there at dean checks in all good.
I go to check in,

64
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.750
I'm on the nine 25 I land in Chicago O'hare.

65
00:03:56.751 --> 00:03:58.100
I have a little low of fun,
you know,

66
00:03:58.101 --> 00:04:00.560
a little layover and then I'm going to go up to a,

67
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.120
then I'm going to go up to the uh,
you know,
up to Milwaukee,

68
00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:08.600
right for my seven what?

69
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.680
I thought it was a seven 30 show turned out it was at seven so I get in there

70
00:04:12.681 --> 00:04:15.090
and the lady behind the counter goes,
a,

71
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.130
you're not flying until five 25 and I was like,
ah,

72
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.990
that is impossible.
I won't be.
And you know,

73
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.200
I won't be in Milwaukee and time for my show.
She goes,
well,
according to this,

74
00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:29.380
you're on the five 25.
I go,
all right,
well,

75
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:33.920
is there room on the nine 25 so I can switch flights?

76
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.070
She goes,
no,
I'm sorry,
that's sold out.
So immediately,
you know,

77
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.980
meet with my temper.
I go,
oh,
so what?
So what?

78
00:04:39.981 --> 00:04:43.700
That one sold out so you bump me to the next flight and she just,

79
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.020
she just stuck her hand out.
Like when your dad used to say cooling,
right?

80
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.980
She just stuck her hand out.
She just goes,
hey,
we don't do that here.
All right.

81
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.130
Starts fucking giving me shit back and starts saying that I screwed up.
I mean,

82
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.830
what do you mean ice?
How do you know what I see?
I got a confirmation number,

83
00:05:00.831 --> 00:05:03.890
I got all this type of stuff and she goes,
we don't do that tag.
Okay,

84
00:05:03.891 --> 00:05:07.310
so you guys never mess up.
You never mess up.
This is on me.

85
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.590
My travel agent never screws up.
Right?
And we're going back and forth,

86
00:05:12.591 --> 00:05:17.030
back and forth,
and she starts fucking yelling at me and I'm,
you know,

87
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.470
I'm keeping my voice.
I'm definitely,
you know,
definitely on my toes,

88
00:05:21.471 --> 00:05:24.590
but I'm not yelling,
but she's yelling at me or raising her voice.

89
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.270
And finally I just said to her,
I said,
lady,
why are you yelling at me?

90
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.140
Okay,
I'm the one who's getting screwed here.

91
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.700
Your shift ends at whatever time it ends.
It's no skin off your back.

92
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.450
I'm not yelling,
I'm not swearing.
Why you swearing?
Right?
I'm not yelling.

93
00:05:41.451 --> 00:05:46.220
Why are you yelling at me?
She got all fucking pissed and I was just like,

94
00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:49.670
Jesus Christ.
I thought people were friendly and Iowa.
That's what I heard.
Right?

95
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.810
So now I have to get a fucking rental car and I have to drive from clear lake.

96
00:05:56.571 --> 00:05:58.640
You know,
I,
my people up up,
up,
I've,

97
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:00.830
everybody's trying to figure out what the fuck's going on.

98
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.730
So now I've got to rent up.

99
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.210
I got to rent up God damn car and clear Lake Iowa and I have to drive from clear

100
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:10.160
Lake Iowa all the way to Milwaukee,

101
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.690
which is going to be nothing but fucking cow pastures.
You know what I mean?

102
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.930
I'll tell you what's amazing is that anybody could crash and die in Iowa.

103
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.710
That's what I took away from this fucking drive because all I see is it's just a

104
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:31.520
giant,
it's just a giant field,
you know?

105
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.150
Sorry.
Anyways,
so I call it my travel agent.

106
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:40.400
We go to fucking figure it out.
I Dunno.
I Dunno what happened,

107
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.120
but it turns out it was somewhere on my end.
Somebody fucked up.

108
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.260
So I walked up to the lady and I said,
listen,

109
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.880
I apologize.
I actually apologized to her and just said it was,

110
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.900
it was somebody on my end,
where can I get the rental car?

111
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.910
And then I just had to fucking deal with that shit.

112
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.260
And the stupid thing said it was a five hour something minute drive and I just

113
00:07:03.261 --> 00:07:08.090
got in the fucking car and drove late 80 85 the entire way.

114
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.070
I averaged 79 miles an hour.
That was with no stops.
No,

115
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.480
no getting gas.
But you know,

116
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:17.630
whenever a truck gets in the left lane and tries to pass up a hill,

117
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.120
that fucks the next 20 minutes of your life up,
you know?
But,
uh,
anyways,

118
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:27.140
I ended up making it there.
My apologies to the lady,
you know,

119
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.890
who could have been a little nicer.
You know,

120
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.240
I think I brought it out of her.
All right.
But I,
I will tell you this.
Okay.

121
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.303
You know,

122
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.820
people tell me how friendly everybody is an Iowa until you question what it is

123
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:43.520
they're doing.

124
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.250
Then all of a sudden they get their backs up or I met one of the few angry

125
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:48.410
people out there,
I dunno.
Slipknots from Iowa.

126
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.000
That's not exactly happy go lucky music is it.
Um,

127
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:59.470
so I fucking drove all the way into Milwaukee like a maniac because I wanted to

128
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:07.340
get to my favorite hotel in the United States of America.
Uh,

129
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.850
which is the Pfister hotel.
I swear to God.
It's called the Pfister.

130
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.720
It's the last name of this family.
It's spelled p.
F.
I.
S.
T.
E.
R.

131
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.800
If you are ever in Milwaukee,
that is where you stay.

132
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.860
You stay at the Pfister.
All right.

133
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.900
It was Guido Pfister had the idea for it and his kid came through with it,

134
00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:33.650
you know,
this was the 18 hundreds when his last name was Pfister.
All right.

135
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.880
Somehow they said they were German,
but his first name is Guido.

136
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.510
I mean is it Pfiester?
All I know is as far as I know,

137
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.920
I think fisting had died down in the 18 hundreds,

138
00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:51.920
so you could have that as a a a last name.
But I,
I believe

139
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:58.440
enrollment times according to like movies,
movies like Culligan,
Leah,

140
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:01.503
<v 3>yeah,</v>

141
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.710
<v 1>that was going on.</v>

142
00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.330
But now with all this sexual harassment and evidently all these fucking lunatic

143
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.470
perverts slash rapist,
um,

144
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.370
in Hollywood,
I love that they're acting like this is specific to Hollywood.

145
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.680
That's something they do all the time.

146
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:24.120
Like if there's like an NFL player that gets busted for domestic violence,

147
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.680
they go,
what is with these athletes beating women?
And it's like it,

148
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.700
that's not it.
This is just a microcosm of the,

149
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.870
so just a little sample of humanity.

150
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.740
I would s I would actually be willing,

151
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.460
be willing to bet that there's just as many plumbers out there that get accused

152
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:47.220
of domestic violence as football players or whatever.

153
00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:50.700
It's just that plumbers don't sell out football stadiums.

154
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:54.600
There's not a giant plumber stadium to see,
you know,

155
00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:57.840
a first ballot hall of fame plumber,
a plumber sink.

156
00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:03.160
So nobody pays attention.
So everybody gets to act like,
oh,
it's,
it's going on.

157
00:10:03.161 --> 00:10:05.350
It's in Hollywood.
It's,
it's,
it's over here.

158
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.670
Like they always notice what people on television at doing,
you know,

159
00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.360
let me look at Bill Clinton.
I mean,
you know,
okay,

160
00:10:13.361 --> 00:10:18.070
this guy comes on a fucking fern.
He's blown a load on a dress,
which is standard.

161
00:10:18.071 --> 00:10:22.450
I guess that's more,
that's more pedestrian place for your,
just end up,
you know,

162
00:10:22.451 --> 00:10:24.700
if you're going to sit there in court,
you know,

163
00:10:24.701 --> 00:10:26.260
and your lawyer is going to be going,
all right,

164
00:10:26.261 --> 00:10:29.520
this is going to be a little bit of an embarrassing day for you buddy.
Uh,

165
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.960
they're gonna bring your ges in and,
you know,

166
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:38.280
but it's on a dress.
So,
uh,
I'm willing to bet that a number of people

167
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:44.550
you know,
that are in the jury at some point have splurged on a dress,
you know,

168
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.420
at very least one of their own t shirts.
You know,

169
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.070
let's not forget about tube socks,
but that,
you know,
that goes without saying,

170
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.660
right.
It's,
but then,
you know,
if you're on trial and you,
you did it into a plant,

171
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.940
you know,
that's a little weird.
A plant is different than,
you know,

172
00:10:59.941 --> 00:11:02.370
if you fucked outside cause then you're just outside.

173
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.700
But a plant is just really specific.

174
00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.413
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

175
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.880
<v 1>Yeah.
I thought Hollywood was green.</v>

176
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.210
I thought they gave a shit about the environment anyways.
Um,

177
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.740
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
So yeah,
it's,
it's an unbelievable,

178
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.340
like this fucking hotel.
You,
you could've shot the shining in there.

179
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.250
I mean that in a good way.
Not in a creepy way,

180
00:11:28.251 --> 00:11:32.510
because as creepy as that movie is,
that is a beautiful hotel.

181
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.960
And,
um,
it's basically,

182
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.840
I'll upload some pictures of that too,

183
00:11:38.841 --> 00:11:42.890
but it's like literally something that Stanley Kubrick could have filmed one of

184
00:11:42.891 --> 00:11:45.000
his masterpieces in.
And,
uh,

185
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:50.110
also they have the greatest sickest death defying steam room,

186
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:57.470
uh,
in country.
I know all this is really sonic bad Pfister's steam room.
Trust me,

187
00:11:57.471 --> 00:12:01.880
it's all above board.
Uh,
it's just if you go there,

188
00:12:01.881 --> 00:12:06.200
this is how it works.
The steam comes on for seven minutes.

189
00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.360
You're going to be in there with you for 20 minutes or half hour.

190
00:12:08.361 --> 00:12:12.410
If you get the half hour one,
it comes on for seven minutes,
okay?

191
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:17.270
And it's literally like a steam pipe broke.
And uh,

192
00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:22.070
I had to get underneath the towel because what you want to do is just let all

193
00:12:22.071 --> 00:12:26.850
that steam come in.
You got to tough it out for seven minutes.
All right?

194
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.610
Because it's not going to come on again until the final seven.

195
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:33.620
If you've got the 30 minute one 20 minutes,
it never comes on again.

196
00:12:33.621 --> 00:12:34.700
So as hot as it gets,

197
00:12:34.701 --> 00:12:38.360
you've got to know that that steam has to last for the entire time that you're

198
00:12:38.361 --> 00:12:41.960
in there and there's a shower does like you've got your own private place and

199
00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:46.250
there's a shower down the end of it.
So this the first day I went in there,

200
00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.550
I fucking,
I opened the window a little bit because I couldn't take it anymore.

201
00:12:49.551 --> 00:12:51.890
And then I closed it.
When it started to die down,

202
00:12:51.891 --> 00:12:56.150
I realized that let all the steam out and then four minutes later it was

203
00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:59.060
borderline chili in this.
I was like,
fuck,
I screwed it up.
All right,

204
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.480
so tomorrow when I get there,
I'm just going to tough to shut out.
Right.

205
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.390
And I was under a towel like four and a half minutes in,
literally going,
ah,

206
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.770
fuck,
fuck.
And I just couldn't take it anymore.
So I was like,

207
00:13:12.771 --> 00:13:13.790
don't open the window,

208
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.210
run to the other side and turn on the shower.
Right.

209
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.240
It's like an overhead shower and you have it on cold.

210
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:25.440
And I went over there and it was like half a degree,

211
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.420
not as hot,
like the steam.

212
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.750
I've ran by the steam thing and my fucking legs felt like,

213
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:35.780
I actually understand now what it feels like initially when you're on fire

214
00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:37.560
because you know what you want to do,

215
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.470
but she can't do it because you're too busy hopping up and down.

216
00:13:40.471 --> 00:13:43.760
So I'm literally hopping up and down with an,

217
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.920
I want to turn on the shower,
but I,
I had to like,

218
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:51.710
I was reacting to the penguin.
Ha ha ha,
fuck eh,
fuck.

219
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.850
And the handle was right there.

220
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.650
And I just kept reaching down pat and get my legs rather than just reaching over

221
00:13:58.651 --> 00:13:59.840
and turn it on the thing.

222
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.500
So finally I had to block out the pain for like 0.2 seconds,

223
00:14:04.501 --> 00:14:06.300
reach over and turn on the fucking thing.

224
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.740
And of course the last person that was in there left it on hot after,
you know,

225
00:14:10.741 --> 00:14:12.660
if the steam was over and they took a hot shower.

226
00:14:12.661 --> 00:14:16.020
So it came out hot and I was like,
fuck,
fuck,
fuck,
fuck.

227
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.640
Turn it back down to get it down to cold.

228
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:26.900
And I just stood there for the final three and a half minutes doing it is no

229
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.190
joke.
And uh,
the half hour was done.

230
00:14:32.191 --> 00:14:36.660
Like I walked out of that thing and I was like breathing heavy.

231
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:40.170
I was coming out of like,
uh,
like coming out.

232
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.840
I was fucking all red,
right?

233
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.480
So I go out into the way,
you know,

234
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.810
and then you cool off for like 15 minutes and you're just sitting there and you

235
00:14:48.811 --> 00:14:52.910
want,
you're not thinking about anything.
You just sit in there totally relaxed.

236
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:54.620
You feel fucking amazing.

237
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:56.543
<v 4>MMM.</v>

238
00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.870
<v 1>Wow.
In the back of your head going like a,
you know,</v>

239
00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.410
I don't know if that was healthy or not.
Right.

240
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:06.990
So then I would go out of the steam room,
right?
The lady comes back and gets you.

241
00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:07.883
And,
um,

242
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.050
I go to the waiting room and Bartolik is already there and he just looks at me

243
00:15:13.051 --> 00:15:15.340
and he starts laughing,
right?
Cause I'm all fucking red.

244
00:15:15.341 --> 00:15:18.660
And I got the shaved head.
He goes,
dude,
you look like the flash.

245
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.010
Which is hilarious because when I looked at myself in the mirror,

246
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.020
I mumbled out loud,

247
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:32.110
like I look like if Hellboy and Jason Vorhees had a kid,

248
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:37.340
is that the name of the guy from fucking Friday the 13th?
Uh,
when he,

249
00:15:37.341 --> 00:15:37.580
you know,

250
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.610
when he comes up out of the lake now when he pulls the mask upper right.

251
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.700
I'm not that ugly,
but I'm just saying.
Um,

252
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.930
and we just sat there just like drinking water and everything.

253
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:49.903
<v 4>MMM.</v>

254
00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.130
<v 1>You know,
I gotta be honest with you two days in a row at doing that,</v>

255
00:15:53.131 --> 00:15:57.570
the next night I had two shows at the Riverside theater.
Um,

256
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.510
just a magical fucking place that is,
and the,

257
00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.920
the comedy crowds in Milwaukee or there,
they're unbelievable.

258
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.080
I cannot say enough good things about that city.

259
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.820
It might be my favorite city in the country.

260
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.670
<v 4>Um,
and uh,</v>

261
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.460
<v 1>I had two shows and like after,</v>

262
00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:20.630
like I got three quarters the way through my first show and I was feeling like

263
00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:23.750
to hydrate it.
Like I was like,
after two days of that level of intensity,

264
00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:27.740
I was like,
uh,
I really should have crushed a bunch of waters here,
you know,

265
00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:31.310
versus he told me he drank a Gatorade was talking about electrolytes,
you know,

266
00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.180
and he's like,
you gotta do that,
get the electrolytes going.

267
00:16:35.181 --> 00:16:39.290
And I vaguely remember seeing on the Internet that electrolytes really isn't a

268
00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:41.850
thing.
That's just something that Gatorade came up with.
Solon,

269
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:46.220
let me look this up.
I mean,
I don't want to challenge Paul versus medical degree,

270
00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.470
but um,
I don't know if our electrolytes,
electrolytes,
that thing here

271
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.320
are a Lek troll lights.

272
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.910
Oh,
I fucked you want,
there's a y in there.
There it is.

273
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:10.610
Our electrolytes real.
All right.

274
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.220
Now there's all kinds of electrolytes,

275
00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:18.200
but the most important ones are sodium chloride,
potassium.
Oh,

276
00:17:18.201 --> 00:17:21.140
they are real.
I thought that that was like something like,
you know,

277
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.070
rather than than when it's not a diamond.
They call it a diet.
Ml.

278
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.730
You genuine diann mills.
Like what?
What the fuck is it Diane smell?
Well,

279
00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:32.540
it's like a diamond except it's not worth anything.
Oh,
I'd like one of those.

280
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.980
I thought an electrolyte is what the F is an electrolyte.

281
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.780
Is Gatorade the real deal?
All right.
Everybody loves Gatorade,

282
00:17:41.781 --> 00:17:45.380
so let's talk about if it's fluff or actually good for you.

283
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:49.800
All you hear about is rehydrate this and electrolyte.
That is it for real.

284
00:17:49.801 --> 00:17:54.000
Your body has a balance and has an ionic solution.

285
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.240
Boring term.
Don't worry about it.
I want to know what it is.

286
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:03.260
As an eye has weight and has ionic solutions called electrolytes to keep your

287
00:18:03.301 --> 00:18:05.640
body muscles and nerves functioning properly.

288
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:10.710
Your kidneys exists to help keep your body in balance by regulating the fluids

289
00:18:10.711 --> 00:18:12.810
and electrolytes in your body.
Yeah,
they filter,

290
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.090
they filter the fluids in your body.
Right?

291
00:18:15.091 --> 00:18:17.340
I thought it was just literally the liquids that you ingest.

292
00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.093
<v 4>MMM.</v>

293
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.010
<v 1>Isn't it unbelievable that I don't know how to fucking body works.
I mean,</v>

294
00:18:23.011 --> 00:18:25.440
not that you guys think I'm smart.
I know you know what,
that I'm dumb.

295
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.980
But you would think that if you would know how that would work,
right?

296
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.630
Your kidneys make,
Oh God,
I hate this word.

297
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.660
You Kitty's make p I hate when adults say p unless they're talking to a child.

298
00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:43.380
Like,
Do you have to go pee pee when an adult says,
I have to pee,

299
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:44.970
I can't handle it.

300
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.003
<v 4>All right,</v>

301
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.410
<v 1>I got to go to the bathroom.
Just say that.
All right.</v>

302
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.000
Your kidneys make you know piss.
That's disgusting.
They'll pissed.
Pissed.

303
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:59.470
Pisses crest P is like,
you know,
you got to walk it off.

304
00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:03.290
When an adult says that to your names.
Have you ever heard a guy say that to you?

305
00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.330
Hey,
can you pull over here?
I have to pee.
I mean,

306
00:19:07.331 --> 00:19:09.390
he might as well just given you like a back rub.

307
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:15.960
Oh,
maybe it's not that bad.
Anyways,

308
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:21.140
they basically filter your blood so you can get rid of waste products like urea

309
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.340
and ammonia.
Ammonia.
Somebody trying to kill me.
The fuck did I get some ammonia?

310
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.440
I really need to know how this shit works.
Should I,

311
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:33.690
as I'm heading into my fifties,
by the way,
uh,
drive from my fifties,

312
00:19:33.691 --> 00:19:36.930
I'm not going to drink until I'm 60.
I've decided that I've made that decision.

313
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.340
I know,
I know.
I'll never make it anyway.
So when you are dehydrated,

314
00:19:41.341 --> 00:19:46.341
your kidneys make your p as concentrated as possible to keep water in the body.

315
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.363
<v 4>Uh,</v>

316
00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.920
<v 1>okay.
What does that mean?
When you are well hydrated,</v>

317
00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:55.560
your kidneys let more water leave with the waste.

318
00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.170
Now there's all kinds of electrolytes,

319
00:19:58.171 --> 00:20:02.700
but the most important ones are sodium chloride,
potassium,
bio,

320
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:05.550
carbonate,
calcium right here.
This is me in high school.

321
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.670
I'm not passing this class.
The second link,

322
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:12.660
the teacher's writing this and the sodium chloride,

323
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.780
potassium stop writing.

324
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.440
Biocarbon Ada that's over and phosphate.

325
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.630
You kidneys has specific transporters to regulate the concentrations of each of

326
00:20:24.631 --> 00:20:27.450
these electrolytes in your blood.
You know what I'm going to ask Paul tonight.

327
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.080
I am going to ask him,
I'm going to set them up.
I'm going to say,
Paul,

328
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.450
did you really feel better drinking the Gatorade afterward?

329
00:20:36.451 --> 00:20:41.100
He's going to be like absolutely a thousand percent.
And I said,
what does it do?

330
00:20:41.101 --> 00:20:42.540
Replace his,
what is his or her place?

331
00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:45.090
And he's going to say electrolytes and I'm going to say Paul,

332
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:46.830
what are electrolytes?

333
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:51.130
And I guarantee you there's no fucking way he's going to be like,
you know,

334
00:20:51.131 --> 00:20:55.530
it's the uh,
it's the shit in your uh,
your system.
Yeah.

335
00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.530
So you don't get like leg cramps immediately have to go to the NFL and think

336
00:20:59.531 --> 00:21:01.090
about people like legs cramp it up.

337
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.250
That tends to be a name for that cause I do that all the time.
Like you can,

338
00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:11.251
you can give an informed answer while still not knowing what the fuck you're

339
00:21:11.861 --> 00:21:14.920
saying.
It's like what's his face?

340
00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:21.160
Tony Romo said this guy has a high football acumens and I'm like,

341
00:21:21.161 --> 00:21:22.150
what the hell is that?

342
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:28.320
The fuck is a high football acument an acumen is having good judgment and quick,

343
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:32.350
I don't know,
quick decision making in a particular field.

344
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.680
So it's kind of insulting,
you know what I mean?
He's saying like,
you know,

345
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.480
he could be still saying this guy's a fucking moron,

346
00:21:40.481 --> 00:21:43.360
but if you get them on the football field,
like he knows this shit.

347
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.030
He's like the rain man when he gets out there.
Right.

348
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.790
So now that he said a high football aq human,

349
00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.780
all the mouth breathers at watch sports like myself,

350
00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:57.220
can you understand [inaudible] there's like,
I don't know what the word is.

351
00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.053
Like you're the rhythm,

352
00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:01.100
but you know where to place that word without actually knowing it,

353
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:02.800
without being able to give a definition.

354
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.500
The only reason why I could give a definition because I looked it up cause I

355
00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:07.810
never heard it because I want to make a joke on Twitter about it.
Right?

356
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.690
Like don't,
it's his fucking accurate kid.

357
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.290
You're going to start hearing that in sports bars and then you can,

358
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.080
you can replace high football.
You can just any subject,

359
00:22:17.081 --> 00:22:22.060
he has a high gardening aq human without ever looking up at acumen.

360
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:26.680
You know,
you could just just keep replacing the,
the uh,
whatever the,
what is it,

361
00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:27.514
the subject.

362
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.870
He has a high serial killer,
a acumen.

363
00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:41.440
So I feel electrolyte is one of those words where you just keep watching the

364
00:22:41.931 --> 00:22:44.470
Gatorade commercial and it's telling you that it's,
it's,

365
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:48.470
it's helping to replace electrolytes and uh,

366
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.590
you know,
and then enough time do you got like,
yeah.
You know,

367
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.670
you're just repeating the advertising.
You know,
what the fuck it means.

368
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.920
Like I know that Gatorade is thirsty for that deep down body thirst.

369
00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.850
I don't know what thirst aid is.
It's aiding your thirst

370
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.660
or is that just all one word?
Gatorade,
Thursday.
You know,

371
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.290
you like when rappers do that and when they want to make something rhyme and

372
00:23:15.291 --> 00:23:16.420
they'll just take the,
the,
the,

373
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:20.190
the suffix of another word and they just do fucking 10 words in a row like that.

374
00:23:20.191 --> 00:23:23.490
And you go,
just want to be like,
I always want to be all white in that moment.

375
00:23:23.491 --> 00:23:28.460
Like excuse me,
Mister Mc.
Those aren't words.
Those aren't words.
You're,

376
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.290
you're inventing words.
It's weird cause I know what they mean.

377
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:37.080
But those aren't words.
You will not get credit for that rap.
I'm sorry.

378
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.500
Well,
not in my Culdesac Ywam.

379
00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.400
Well that's the reason to get angry.
Um,
anyways,
let's finish this.

380
00:23:45.401 --> 00:23:49.460
This is actually fucking interesting to me
how much,
I don't know.

381
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:54.050
Your kidneys have a specific transporters to regulate the concentration of each

382
00:23:54.051 --> 00:23:57.920
of these electrolytes in your blood when you work out,
you sweat.
Yup.

383
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.630
Four years of college taught me that,
um,
ms kids trying to be funny.

384
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:07.790
When you work out,
you sweat.
When you sweat,
you lose fluids and electrolytes,

385
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.830
especially slow sodium and chloride,
which is why your sweat tastes salty.

386
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:19.430
Uh,
now when you're lacking fluids and electrolytes,
your muscle suffer.

387
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.880
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

388
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:25.210
<v 1>And your point,
yeah.
It's just basically like a car leaking oil.
Um,</v>

389
00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:31.150
let's talk about why Gatorade or any sports drink works water.

390
00:24:31.151 --> 00:24:35.740
We'll get into your bloodstream faster when it's part of Gatorade because

391
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:39.940
waterflows follows electrolytes.
Skate arrayed has electrolytes,

392
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:44.050
so it has salt and shit in there.
Chloride,
potassium,

393
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:48.430
I know potassiums and like a bananas,

394
00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:53.320
but I thought chloride was like some shit that either cleans your clothes or a,

395
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.550
it sounds too much like chlorine,
like that.
Seems like that would be poisonous.

396
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:02.030
Calcium,
calcium deposits on your teeth.

397
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:07.280
I know our calcium is calcium is in like fucking broccoli phosphate.

398
00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.380
Like fuck.
I would think phosphate is like,

399
00:25:11.381 --> 00:25:13.120
you know when you turn the car on your garage,

400
00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.230
carbon dioxide and phosphate get into your system.

401
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.210
Well actually a high,

402
00:25:19.211 --> 00:25:24.211
a two high level of any of these electrolytes could prove fatal.

403
00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:29.200
Theoretically what's your body is,

404
00:25:29.201 --> 00:25:33.850
is a symphony of balance.
I'm not passing this class,

405
00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.560
uh,
when you work out.
All right,

406
00:25:35.561 --> 00:25:37.930
so I think I kind of know what the fuck this shit is.
While I guess,

407
00:25:37.931 --> 00:25:42.610
I guess it's true.
I didn't think it was
Jesus.
Wasn't that a long,

408
00:25:42.611 --> 00:25:46.300
boring trip down to fucking nowhere.
Anyways,
so I get to Milwaukee,

409
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:51.520
I finally got to see the bronze fonts.
You know,
pappy days took place there.

410
00:25:51.521 --> 00:25:56.350
I took a picture that I'm going to tweet out later today and Hava Richie and

411
00:25:56.351 --> 00:26:00.070
Fonzie of finally back together again before we comment on Twitter goes,
Huh?

412
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.310
Yeah,
you fucking look like Ralph mouth.
I'd say more Ralph,

413
00:26:03.311 --> 00:26:08.170
myself laughing my ass off by myself at my own joke that I wrote with my thumbs.

414
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:13.210
Um,
I finally went to the Harley Davidson Museum.
Jesus Christ.

415
00:26:13.211 --> 00:26:16.000
You got to do that.
You got to do that.

416
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.520
This is how great Milwaukee is.

417
00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.610
I actually told people in Milwaukee that I wasn't going to tell people how great

418
00:26:21.611 --> 00:26:22.444
he is,

419
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.510
but I kind of have to because it's fucking amazing because most people won't

420
00:26:25.511 --> 00:26:28.550
listen anyways,
right.
All the Yolo do shoes.
You know,

421
00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:33.190
they're going to go to Chicago,
maybe,
you know,
go to a cubs game,
you know,

422
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.350
that popped collar or whatever the fuck it is.
They do.

423
00:26:35.351 --> 00:26:37.480
But then they're going to go to the,
they're gonna go to the party cities.

424
00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.270
If you're in your 20s,
you're not going to Milwaukee.
Right.

425
00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.740
I don't know what they do.
Whenever these fucking Djs play,

426
00:26:43.741 --> 00:26:46.110
that's where they come and they go on to Vegas,
they go into Miami,

427
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:50.930
they're going to one of those places,
right,
with a base.
Never stops.
Bam.
Now,
now,

428
00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:54.920
now
they had the Harley Davidson Museum.

429
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.140
They have my favorite fucking beer.
Miller,

430
00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:00.200
the Miller brewery company is right there.
You can take a tour of it.

431
00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.140
I wish I was drinking.
I would have done that because they get you like,
you know,

432
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.950
borderline shit faced before you leave.
And uh,

433
00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.980
they got the river walk.
Next time I go out there,

434
00:27:09.981 --> 00:27:12.080
I'm going out there during the s or in the summer.

435
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:18.140
Milwaukee is basically Chicago with like,
you know,
fucking half the population.

436
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:24.260
Um,
all the same stuff,
all the same great views,
the traffic.

437
00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:29.520
I love it.
Um,
then I,
oh Brian,

438
00:27:29.521 --> 00:27:30.311
a Monday morning,

439
00:27:30.311 --> 00:27:35.311
a Photoshop gentlemen is from out that way and he fucking let us know about some

440
00:27:35.651 --> 00:27:39.880
spots to go to.
And it was a,
he told us about this place,
Van Guard,

441
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:45.630
which makes these fucking brats and sausages and they were just next level.

442
00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.550
They were the best sauce I've ever had.
All right.

443
00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:53.640
To keep with the homo erotic theme of this podcast,
right?

444
00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:59.130
We had the Pfister hotel,
we had a steam room,
and now I'm talking about sausage

445
00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:06.400
and were this is my favorite place to go.
So,
hey,

446
00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:12.520
maybe I'll come out like Kevin Spacey and just gonna make sure I,
uh,
you know,

447
00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.380
Kenny,
again this,
this,
this,

448
00:28:14.381 --> 00:28:19.381
this is a very thin fucking line to walk there with a comedy exists that at the

449
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:25.300
end of the day,
you know,
it's just Jesus fucking Christ.
What is going on?
Um,

450
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:29.550
anyways,
where else?
What else do I want to talk about?
Ah,

451
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.070
yeah.
So we just had the best time and me Versie in Barton,

452
00:28:33.071 --> 00:28:36.180
it just kept saying that like,
I fucking love this city.
City is awesome.

453
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.380
And I don't say it's about a lot of places,
but I,
that's,

454
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.640
I could literally live there.
My big fucking thing though is,

455
00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:50.280
is I'm just really sick of living where my sports teams aren't.

456
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:52.693
<v 0>You know,</v>

457
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:59.310
<v 1>I've been behind enemy lines as far as being a sports fan goes since 1995.</v>

458
00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.320
<v 0>And
you know,</v>

459
00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.770
<v 1>recently I went back to Boston.</v>

460
00:29:08.771 --> 00:29:11.380
I remember I went back with a fuck that I think went to a Bruins game or

461
00:29:11.381 --> 00:29:15.740
something.
Yeah.
I went to a Bruins game.
That's right.
I was,

462
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.900
I did one day on a,
uh,
so when I did well,
I did one day in a movie.

463
00:29:19.901 --> 00:29:21.610
I can't remember.
I can't remember the fuck I was there.

464
00:29:21.611 --> 00:29:25.900
I went there during hockey season.
That's what I remember.
And,
uh,

465
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:30.810
I went to a Bruins game and I'll never forget,

466
00:29:30.811 --> 00:29:35.550
I looked out the hotel window and all I saw was this sea of Bruins jerseys.

467
00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.030
And I was just like,
oh my God,
if I forget what this feels like,

468
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.590
and I,
that's the one thing that I don't know.

469
00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:48.240
That would be the only thing star other than,

470
00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:52.290
I don't know if I could exist in this business,
live in there in Milwaukee.
But,

471
00:29:52.291 --> 00:29:57.120
uh,
I don't know.
It's fucking fresh air.
I like it.
I fuck,

472
00:29:57.121 --> 00:30:00.060
I don't know why.
I have no idea.
All right.
But we get it.
We get it.
All right,

473
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:04.350
let's read a little bit of advertising here for,
um,

474
00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:06.890
oh,
you know what?
Fuck that.

475
00:30:06.891 --> 00:30:11.891
Let's talk about the fucking Iowa Hawkeyes beating the fucking shit of the Ohio

476
00:30:13.581 --> 00:30:16.570
state buckeyes.
What happened?
The buck,

477
00:30:16.571 --> 00:30:19.400
I said that huge win last week against Penn state.

478
00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:23.450
I saw Jay lightheaded at the all things comedy fucking festival,

479
00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.970
and the man was literally floating.

480
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:27.390
<v 0>Okay.</v>

481
00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.400
<v 1>Floating across the Goddamn Room.</v>

482
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:32.550
The man simply could not believe it.

483
00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:34.880
Couldn't believe as good fortunes.

484
00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:39.540
He was saying that was probably the most impressive win of the college football

485
00:30:39.541 --> 00:30:40.051
season.

486
00:30:40.051 --> 00:30:44.370
And you would be very hard pressed to come up with an argument different to

487
00:30:44.371 --> 00:30:45.204
different,
you know?

488
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:46.390
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

489
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:50.300
<v 1>And then a week fucking later they absolutely shit the bed again.
I mean,</v>

490
00:30:50.301 --> 00:30:54.250
ain't got that shit kicked out of them.
If they didn't do that dumb fake punt,

491
00:30:54.251 --> 00:30:55.690
whatever the hell that partner was doing,

492
00:30:56.410 --> 00:31:01.240
they would have been like 55 17 they just shut them down in the second half.

493
00:31:01.241 --> 00:31:04.450
It was a,
it was unbelievable.
And then Penn state loses again toe.

494
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:09.290
So what does that mean?
What does that mean?
Meanwhile?

495
00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:13.800
Was Constance fucking undefeated and everybody's going to be like,
well,

496
00:31:13.801 --> 00:31:17.490
there's fucking nobody.
There's nobody on the west.
We got Michigan,

497
00:31:17.491 --> 00:31:20.910
we've got a house day,
we got fucker Michigan State,
we got Penn state.

498
00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.300
So I great,
well you know what,

499
00:31:24.301 --> 00:31:26.520
they got out west to get the fucking Iowa Hawkeyes.

500
00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:29.190
How cool did that stadium look?

501
00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.273
<v 0>MMM,</v>

502
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.110
<v 1>whenever I watch Iowa,
right.
Play football.
I don't know why.</v>

503
00:31:35.111 --> 00:31:38.500
I always think back when I liked Iowa when I was a kid because there was a

504
00:31:38.501 --> 00:31:42.400
running back Ronnie Harmon that I really liked and I brought it up to this guy

505
00:31:42.401 --> 00:31:43.900
when I was on the plane,
uh,

506
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:48.280
taking the puddle jumper over and he brought up how he fucking fumbled four

507
00:31:48.281 --> 00:31:52.060
times in a rose bowl or some shit.
And I had no idea that,

508
00:31:52.061 --> 00:31:52.990
I didn't even know that happened.

509
00:31:52.991 --> 00:31:55.270
And then there was this whole fucking scandal trying to say that,

510
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:58.780
that he fixed the game cause he'd like never fumbled ever.

511
00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:03.400
And then he fumbled four times in the first half.
I don't know,

512
00:32:03.401 --> 00:32:06.610
maybe it was just a bad time to have a bad game,
but I never knew that about him.

513
00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:08.590
But he had a great NFL career.

514
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.790
<v 0>Okay.</v>

515
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:14.520
<v 1>Rush by like 8,500 yards,
almost 10,000 yards,
um,</v>

516
00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:19.440
played like 11 years or something like that.
Uh,
I dunno.
Anyways,

517

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:37.310

<v 4>And,

00:38:18.891 --> 00:38:22.370
which is at two oh one west 75th street.

615
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.333
<v 4>MMM.</v>

All right.
So

617
00:38:29.121 --> 00:38:31.410
And so perfect size place.
It looks awesome.

618
00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.260
It's right next to the beacon theater.
It's a little 100 seat thing.

619
00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:39.430
I'm going to doing about 40,
45 minutes,
trying out some new shit.
Fucking around,

620
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:43.960
having a good time.
Um,
you know,

621
00:38:43.961 --> 00:38:48.010
keeping the hour tight.
Uh,
and that's it.
It's a couple,

622
00:38:48.011 --> 00:38:52.900
a friends of mine that are owning and running the club from my days.

623
00:38:52.901 --> 00:38:56.080
Way Back.
We're going back to like the Boston Comedy Club in that type of shit.

624
00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:59.530
Um,
so anyways,
uh,
check that out if you've got a chance.

625
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.130
And is that everything that I want to talk about?
I think so.
Can we go into the,

626
00:39:03.131 --> 00:39:07.900
uh,
questions for the week?
How long into this podcast?
Oh,
39 minutes.

627
00:39:07.901 --> 00:39:12.670
Okay.
That's perfect.
That is perfect.
I think I could run my mouth for another.

628
00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:15.310
Do.
What the fuck was Lsu doing against Alabama?

629
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:18.880
I know it's Alabama because they drop more goddamn passes that she had a

630
00:39:18.881 --> 00:39:23.200
highlight reel of him fucking up passes blowing opportunities

631
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.540
a day I go to be asking myself,

632
00:39:26.541 --> 00:39:30.320
how good is the Alabama Crimson tide considering they're playing in a much

633
00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.650
weaker c than we've seen in years?

634
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:37.350
Who knows?
But I'll tell you why they're great.

635
00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.980
Because even though that they were winning easily against Lsu for the most,

636
00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:45.060
for most of the game,
um,
Nick Saban was still getting pissed,

637
00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:49.860
screaming and yelling.
He knows,
he knows.
He sees an updraft passes.

638
00:39:49.861 --> 00:39:52.140
He's like,
well,
if they caught that and they caught that,
you know,

639
00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.330
this game could be this.

640
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:55.800
<v 3>Okay.</v>

641
00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.070
<v 1>You don't get credit because they dropped it.
You get credited.</v>

642
00:39:58.071 --> 00:40:00.810
If you knock it down,
then he feels like we're playing good defense.

643
00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:05.160
That is why that is why that guy's the shit.
Um,

644
00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:09.820
but it will be interesting to see because a few weeks ago it looked like Penn

645
00:40:09.821 --> 00:40:12.370
state was world beaters.
Now they've lost two in a row.

646
00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:16.100
Ohio state looked like they were coming on and then they got the live in shit.

647
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:20.230
They got the living there was alive shit in them and it was kicked out of them.

648
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:24.880
They got to feel a lot lighter that after this,
this past weekend.
Um,

649
00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:26.900
<v 3>okay.</v>

650
00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:27.990
<v 1>All right.
Let's,
uh,
let's do it.</v>

651
00:40:27.991 --> 00:40:31.710
A little questions here for the rest of the podcasts are plastic surgery.

652
00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.970
All right,
Bill,
I watched your specials every single day.

653
00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.870
Jay's is to take a break.
I appreciate it.
But you know,

654
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:43.001
you know,

655
00:40:43.001 --> 00:40:46.940
at some point you're gonna start hating me and it's not going to be my fault.
Um,

656
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:47.770
all right.

657
00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:52.000
I have a wonderful time and I laugh to the jokes as if I've seen them for the

658
00:40:52.001 --> 00:40:56.950
first time.
I live in China and youtube is a bitch here.
Lol.
Wow.

659
00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:59.860
The Fuck Outta here.
That's amazing.

660
00:40:59.861 --> 00:41:04.730
Good luck waiting for your new
stuck.

661
00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:08.710
S t U.
G.
G.
I don't know what that means,
but a,
hey,

662
00:41:08.711 --> 00:41:12.590
what's up person from China?
When I was training to,
uh,

663
00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.210
get my pilot's licence,

664
00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:19.520
I flew with a bunch of your countrymen who came over here,

665
00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.850
barely spoke English and then learned how to fly helicopters.

666
00:41:22.851 --> 00:41:26.090
One of the most amazing things ever because I don't think I could go to mainland

667
00:41:26.091 --> 00:41:27.710
China.
Right.

668
00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:29.170
<v 3>Okay.</v>

669
00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:33.080
<v 1>I think have an instructor.
My Buddy,
uh,
said to me,
I go,</v>

670
00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:37.310
they don't understand English.
How do you,
how do you communicate?
And he said,

671
00:41:37.311 --> 00:41:38.510
they understand tone,

672
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:44.900
which is what I would understand if I was over there and this guy went
screaming.

673
00:41:44.901 --> 00:41:49.490
I'll be all right.
All right.
Don't do what I just did.
Got It.
Um,
alright.

674
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:53.870
JFK files.
Oh,
Billy root beer float.
Oh,

675
00:41:53.871 --> 00:41:58.100
I love a root beer float.
I love a root beer float.

676
00:41:58.101 --> 00:42:00.560
I never get them cause I don't want to be a fat.

677
00:42:00.561 --> 00:42:03.740
Fuck all the cowboys throw a pick six.

678
00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:08.940
Wow.
Oh,
that wasn't it.
Was that a pick six?
No,
it wasn't.

679
00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.870
They didn't throw a pick six.
That was actually an offensive play.

680
00:42:12.871 --> 00:42:15.780
Why did that guy look like a cornerback to me?
Um,

681
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:19.880
okay.
As Kansas City going to do it to share everybody.

682
00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:21.290
<v 3>Okay.</v>

683
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:25.760
<v 1>Is Andy Reid finally going to bring a team to the promise land in a hoist the</v>

684
00:42:25.761 --> 00:42:30.050
trophy?
It's up in the air this year.
Um,

685
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.780
which once again,
you look how bad the fucking giant,
sir.

686
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:39.290
I don't understand how you have a coach,
how you have a GM,

687
00:42:39.291 --> 00:42:44.090
how you have these guys in place that got you trophies,
trophies,
Superbowl,

688
00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:46.100
trophies,
plural,
and you get rid of them.

689
00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.030
It's like the Red Sox with fucking Theo Epstein and uh,
you know,

690
00:42:50.031 --> 00:42:53.330
fucking Terry Francona.
We get rid of those guys.

691
00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:58.520
And then literally there's a world series with Theo Epstein's cubs and Terry

692
00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:02.540
Francona is fucking Indians last year I,
I,
you know,
I still don't understand it.

693
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.090
It's almost like morning radio.

694
00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:09.440
Like morning radio is another thing that I watch and I just see these great

695
00:43:09.441 --> 00:43:13.480
shows and the two hosts end up inevitably hating each other.

696
00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:16.820
Then the great show goes away.
And I'm not just talking about the one that I did,

697
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:19.730
it happens all the time.
And I think that that's just what happens.

698
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.400
It's nobody's fault.
It's just,

699
00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:23.870
<v 3>yeah,</v>

700
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:26.600
<v 1>I dunno.
The same way.
You know,
after a while you like,</v>

701
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.520
even though you have shirts,
you want a new shirt.

702
00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.250
I think people do that with like relationships.

703
00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:36.200
And that's what's so fucked up about marriage is it said same God damn shirt.

704
00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:39.470
And as much as you're looking at your wife go,
and that's that same old shirt.

705
00:43:39.471 --> 00:43:42.610
You got to understand you're a fucking old shirt too.
All right?

706
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.600
And the two of you have to hold on to each other until God takes you to
goodwill.

707
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.740
Um,
alright.
JFK.
So stupid.
All right.

708
00:43:51.741 --> 00:43:55.850
Jfk files old Billy root beer float.
Oh God damn.
And I love a root beer float.

709
00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:58.250
I'm sure you've,
you have heard that,

710
00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:03.730
that the JFK files or some of them had been released and as a fellow conspiracy

711
00:44:04.011 --> 00:44:07.310
theorists,
I thought this might interest you to,

712
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.960
they're not gonna release anything.

713
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:12.200
If somebody else really did it and they actually know who did it,

714
00:44:12.201 --> 00:44:13.550
then not to be like,
all right,

715
00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:20.350
I think it's safe to tell you that the guy who really did it was not named Lee

716
00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:26.090
Harvey Oswald,
his name was Larry fucking whatever,
the Larry Fellowship.

717
00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.450
Um,
and one of the files,

718
00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:34.480
the CIA states that it planned bombings in Miami to kill innocent people so that

719
00:44:37.861 --> 00:44:40.200
they can blame it on Fidel Castro.

720
00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:46.140
Now that there is undeniable proof that the CIA isn't above killing innocent

721
00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:48.510
innocence to get their way.

722
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:52.560
Does that change your views on any other conspiracy theories?

723
00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.690
I know how much you suck at reading.

724
00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:58.920
So I attached the link with the actual snippet of what I'm talking about.

725
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:05.580
Um,
yeah,

726
00:45:05.581 --> 00:45:08.910
I mean I,
I'd have to see that that was,
you know,
you know what's interesting,

727
00:45:08.911 --> 00:45:11.190
I just clicked on that and all of a sudden I'm not,

728
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.920
I'm not hooked up to the Internet.
How weird is that?

729
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:16.620
I was hooked up into the Internet and start until I tried to look at this

730
00:45:16.621 --> 00:45:17.454
fucking thing.

731
00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:22.270
Now I basically taking your word that that's actually what happened.

732
00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:26.650
If that is in fact the case.
Okay.

733
00:45:26.651 --> 00:45:31.450
We could develop a communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami era and other

734
00:45:31.451 --> 00:45:33.460
Florida cities and even Washington,

735
00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:37.210
the terror campaign could be pointed at Cuban refugees

736
00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:41.200
seeking haven in the United States.

737
00:45:41.201 --> 00:45:46.201
We could sync a boatload of Cubans in route to Florida real or simulated

738
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:54.100
what the fuck,
real or simulated.
In other words,

739
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:57.890
they own enough.
They could just say it happened and how do people know it did,

740
00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:03.640
we could foster attempts on lives of Cuban refugees in the United States even to

741
00:46:05.211 --> 00:46:07.820
the extent of wounding in instance.

742
00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:09.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

743
00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.570
<v 1>What,
even to the extent of wounding and instances to be a,</v>

744
00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:15.400
to be widely publicized,

745
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:20.790
exploding a few plastic bombs and carefully chosen spots also seen sound like

746
00:46:20.981 --> 00:46:22.810
they're going to fucking kill fellow Americans.

747
00:46:22.811 --> 00:46:27.130
I think that they're going to kill Cuban refugees here.
Um,

748
00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:33.470
exploding a few plastic bombs and chuck carefully chosen spots.

749
00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:38.770
The rest of Cuban agent and the release of prepared documents substantiating

750
00:46:39.771 --> 00:46:43.670
Cuban involvement also would be helpful in projecting the idea of an

751
00:46:43.671 --> 00:46:47.660
irresponsible government.
Um,
yeah.

752
00:46:47.661 --> 00:46:52.120
None of that's surprising.
I mean,
is that really surprising?

753
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:59.350
If you just sort of fucking pay attention and just even just even remotely try

754
00:46:59.351 --> 00:47:01.440
to read between the lines.

755
00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.650
<v 0>Um,
yeah,</v>

756
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.390
<v 1>we're not as good as we act like we are,</v>

757
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:15.020
but I'm also not going to then glorify Fidel Castro like he was just fucking

758
00:47:15.151 --> 00:47:20.130
saint.
But,
uh,
you know,
I don't think it's crazy to say that,

759
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.470
you know,
we were more upset

760
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:27.270
with Fidel Castro,
not because he was,
you know,

761
00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:32.770
a communist was probably more because he wouldn't let us develop his country the

762
00:47:32.771 --> 00:47:35.170
way we saw fit.
And by we,

763
00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:37.810
I don't mean the average fucking person walking down the street.

764
00:47:37.811 --> 00:47:42.220
I'm talking about the corporations and I don't think that that policy has

765
00:47:42.221 --> 00:47:45.400
changed.
And I'm not going to get on a fucking stump here,

766
00:47:45.401 --> 00:47:49.210
but I don't think that that has changed at all.
And,
uh,

767
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:54.330
and currently that philosophy as bankrupted this country and I don't know what's

768
00:47:56.381 --> 00:48:00.460
going to happen.
And that's all really heavy shit.
And I,

769
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:06.310
you know,
I remember reading something that j Edgar Hoover allegedly said,

770
00:48:06.311 --> 00:48:09.550
even if they do figure it out,
it's so fucking overwhelming and depressing.

771
00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.830
They won't want to think about it.
And that's where I get to.

772
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.930
So I just go to Milwaukee and I get a brat and I have a good time and I be the

773
00:48:16.931 --> 00:48:18.250
dancing monkey that I am.

774
00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:22.300
And I just hope that the lie is able to sustain itself.

775
00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:27.910
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
I Dunno what the fuck to do.
I Dunno.
Yeah.
So that's great.

776
00:48:27.911 --> 00:48:32.290
So that's why I kind of backed away from conspiracy theory because,
um,

777
00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:38.670
cause you don't want to be right
even remotely.

778
00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.420
Um,
so anyways,
let's get out of that.
Oh,
let's,

779
00:48:42.421 --> 00:48:45.570
let's talk a robot granted citizenship.
Oh my God.

780
00:48:45.571 --> 00:48:47.310
Out of the frying pan into the fire.

781
00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:54.020
I would love to read the a declassified CIA file on fucking what the hell they

782
00:48:55.381 --> 00:48:58.350
plan to do with robots.
I mean,

783
00:48:58.351 --> 00:49:01.110
there's no fucking way that they're not talking.

784
00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:04.410
Like I always joke how they never discussed the population problem.

785
00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.240
They absolutely fucking do,

786
00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:09.240
but not to the general public because it would freak them out.

787
00:49:09.241 --> 00:49:14.241
Because I think at that point you realize how overpopulated we are and how,

788
00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:18.840
uh,
expendable you are.
I mean,

789
00:49:18.841 --> 00:49:19.740
that's how I would feel.

790
00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:22.283
<v 0>You know,</v>

791
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:27.660
<v 1>how many stand up fucking comedians?
I mean for the survival of humanity.</v>

792
00:49:27.661 --> 00:49:29.070
Do you really need another one?
Yeah.

793
00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:31.243
<v 0>MMM.</v>

794
00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:36.460
<v 1>All right.
Robot.
Granted citizenship.
Uh,
greetings from Austin.</v>

795
00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:40.660
You were literate piece of shit.
All right.
Well,
hello.

796
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:45.310
Hello to you and your fucking overpopulated fucking city.
Uh,

797
00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.380
keep it weird.
It shouldn't keep it.

798
00:49:47.381 --> 00:49:52.381
We should keep it weird by fucking preventing more people from moving to that

799
00:49:52.661 --> 00:49:56.430
great place and ruining it.
Uh,
I ran across the,
uh,

800
00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:59.080
I ran across this the other day and thought of your podcast.

801
00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:02.710
They gave a robot citizenship.
Her name is Sophia,

802
00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:06.820
and she was acknowledged as a citizen in Saudi Arabia.
You know what?

803
00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:10.330
That's fucking great.
That's fucking great.

804
00:50:10.331 --> 00:50:14.830
Because what they just did was they ended their country.
That's over.

805
00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:18.520
The second is a robot is,
becomes a citizen.
That is beginning.

806
00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:20.680
That is the beginning of the fucking end.

807
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:26.410
Beginning of the fucking end of your goddamn a way.
Was that a special teams?

808
00:50:26.411 --> 00:50:30.810
Fucking touchdown.
I Dunno what's going on.
Anyways,
uh,

809
00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.870
that's the beginning of the end of your country.

810
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.810
And considering from what I've read,

811
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:40.460
that these terrorist groups for the most part are funded through Saudi Arabia,

812
00:50:40.461 --> 00:50:43.370
sending money,
funneling them through mosques.

813
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:47.900
<v 4>Uh,
I think that'd be a good thing.
You know.</v>

814
00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:52.240
<v 1>Now if we could just stop trying to build Starbucks over there and just fucking</v>

815
00:50:52.241 --> 00:50:54.670
come home,
you know,

816
00:50:55.270 --> 00:51:00.270
just walk away from it instead of being that degenerate gambler sitting at the

817
00:51:00.701 --> 00:51:04.030
fucking black Jack table waiting for the cards to turn around.

818
00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.390
Um,
all right,
so they did this,

819
00:51:07.391 --> 00:51:11.950
not exactly the best spot for a female human.
Oh,
Saudi Arabia.

820
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.870
Uh,
maybe they will be nicer to robots.
Okay.

821
00:51:16.871 --> 00:51:20.800
This is scary how God damn creepy is that thing.
I know this will freak you out,

822
00:51:20.801 --> 00:51:24.670
Bill.
Just fast forward to any point where the robot is talking.
Yeah,

823
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:27.670
I watched it.
You guys got to see this video.

824
00:51:27.671 --> 00:51:31.240
And I love how the journalist asks,

825
00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:36.190
acts like he's asking these hard hitting fucking questions as if these questions

826
00:51:36.191 --> 00:51:40.540
weren't written out for this fucking sellout human piece of shit,

827
00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:42.070
which is what you have to say now,

828
00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:47.380
this human sold out other humans to this non fucking human life form.

829
00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:49.170
What the fuck are we doing?

830
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:55.710
He actually says,
well,
how do we know that we could trust you?
Or something like,

831
00:51:55.711 --> 00:51:57.540
how do we know you're not going to blah,
blah,
blah.

832
00:51:57.810 --> 00:52:02.610
Like just like a stuck a comedy team just lobs this setup over and then the

833
00:52:02.611 --> 00:52:07.200
robots,
like you're watching too much.
Elan Musk and Hollywood movies.

834
00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:09.200
<v 4>Okay.</v>

835
00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:13.310
<v 1>And then like,
oh,
it made a joke.
Oh,
I see.
It's friendly.
It's like,</v>

836
00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:16.520
it's not a person.
It doesn't have a heart.

837
00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:20.990
It doesn't have a fucking soul that is a programmed fucking response.
All right.

838
00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:24.080
And they're going to have to have all these facial expressions to make you feel

839
00:52:24.081 --> 00:52:24.914
fucking comp.

840
00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:26.773
<v 4>MMM.</v>

841
00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:32.110
<v 1>That is a,
that thing is,
is our replacement,</v>

842
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:35.350
without a doubt.
Without a doubt.
And,
uh,

843
00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:37.360
I definitely think the robots are gonna kill us.

844
00:52:37.361 --> 00:52:39.610
I don't think they're literally maybe going to kill us,

845
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.200
but I think they will kill us off the way the car killed off.
You know,

846
00:52:44.201 --> 00:52:46.000
the horse is a mode of transportation,

847
00:52:46.001 --> 00:52:48.700
which was probably cool for the horse because he's probably sick of us being on

848
00:52:48.701 --> 00:52:49.534
his back.

849
00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:50.543
<v 4>Right.</v>

850
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:54.980
<v 1>But I don't think it's gonna be cool for us because we will become obsolete.</v>

851
00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:59.600
We will be,
uh,
a,
uh,
the human version of a cassette tape

852
00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.421
when all the kids,

853
00:53:02.421 --> 00:53:07.421
when iPods and the kids will be basically whoever employs the CIA.

854
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:13.040
All right,
there we go.
Isn't this fun?
Isn't this fucking uplifting?

855
00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:17.030
How about those Kansas City chiefs,
bread and circus.
All right.

856
00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:21.110
Hot Girl and coffee shop.
I like the sound of this already.

857
00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:26.250
Uh,
old Billy booze lists.
That's right.
Billy bootlace puzzles.
80 days.

858
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.670
We'll be 81 by the time you listen to this,
unless I go off the rails tonight.

859
00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:35.400
I'm a big fan of your stand up and the podcasts all the way from Glasgow,

860
00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:36.333
Scotland

861
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:44.710
all the way from Glasgow,
Scotland uh,
are cut to the chase.
Um,

862
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:49.080
Glasgow,
Scotland,
that's where,
um,
ACDC recorded there.

863
00:53:49.081 --> 00:53:51.570
If you want blood live album

864
00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:53.943
<v 3>right</v>

865
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.940
<v 1>in a venue that doesn't exist anymore cause I tried to find it when I was over</v>

866
00:53:56.941 --> 00:53:58.380
there.
I'll cut to the chase.

867
00:53:58.381 --> 00:54:03.360
I'm a 23 year old guy who was recently graduated from college and moved down to

868
00:54:03.361 --> 00:54:07.320
London about five months ago to start a new job.
All right.

869
00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:11.970
I am enjoying life in my new surroundings and the girls down here are of another

870
00:54:11.971 --> 00:54:16.260
planet compared to back home.
However,
there is one,
there is one,

871
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:21.420
there is one for in particular who has caught my attention and I'd like your

872
00:54:21.421 --> 00:54:25.460
advice on the best way to ask her out.
The lovely knee,
his advice as welcome.

873
00:54:25.461 --> 00:54:29.760
She probably have a better idea of what to do here than I would but she's not

874
00:54:29.761 --> 00:54:33.030
here as,
I'm in Green Bay,
Wisconsin right now.
All right.

875
00:54:33.031 --> 00:54:38.031
She works in a coffee shop near my work and she is immense.

876
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:43.910
Easily a 9.3 slash 10 I never have a problem with women,

877
00:54:44.221 --> 00:54:49.221
but 90% of the time I have had a few beers in me at the time and my confidence

878
00:54:49.621 --> 00:54:53.700
is at its peak.
Can you give me any advice on how to ask this girl out?

879
00:54:53.701 --> 00:54:58.650
Giving that it's a small coffee shop in full view of the general public?

880
00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:03.450
Uh,
we had some chat.
Oh,
that's good.
So I was going to say,

881
00:55:03.451 --> 00:55:06.780
go in there and start talking to her and I'm 80% sure she's into me,

882
00:55:06.781 --> 00:55:11.490
but I'm shitting myself in case I get the rejection and there's around 30 people

883
00:55:11.491 --> 00:55:14.790
there to witness it.
Dude.
Fuck those other 30 people.

884
00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:20.730
What you have at your fingertips is a great story.

885
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:25.860
No matter what happens,
you either possibly meet the love of your life,

886
00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:30.720
right?
Settle down,
have kids together and live happily,
happily ever after.

887
00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:35.460
Or You have a hilarious fucking story,
Dude.
Fuck that.

888
00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:40.380
The worst she can say is no.
Who gives a shit?
Oh Dude.

889
00:55:40.381 --> 00:55:43.170
I'd ask her out in the middle of the meal,
you know,

890
00:55:43.171 --> 00:55:46.830
just to make the awkwardness even further.
Just steer.
Who gives a fuck.

891
00:55:46.831 --> 00:55:50.700
Fuck that dude.
If you can chat up women,
it's not because you're drunk,

892
00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:54.540
it's because you got rid of that stupid voice in your head that says that you

893
00:55:54.541 --> 00:55:58.710
can't,
you obviously can't.
Alcohol doesn't make you talk to women.

894
00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:01.800
All right?
It doesn't make you talk to women better.

895
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:06.080
What it does is it gets rid of your fucking fear so you can actually,
you know,

896
00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:09.870
perform.
This is like some fucking,
uh,
John Daly Shit.

897
00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:12.300
Like he used to have a couple of courts lights so he'd relax more,

898
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:17.190
hit the ball further.
I'm not saying to go in there,
shit faced.

899
00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:19.450
<v 3>Okay.</v>

900
00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:23.260
<v 1>Fuck.
I got to go back to this.
Kansas City touched on it was a pass.
Sorry.</v>

901
00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:25.690
Anyways,
yeah.
Dude,

902
00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:29.140
I just go in there to fuck this.
You're the man.

903
00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:33.760
She works in a coffee shop.
She's not splitting atoms.

904
00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:38.770
All right.
Just go in there.
All right.
Just go in there,

905
00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:42.670
build.
You just not even like fucking try to walk in like you're the man.

906
00:56:42.671 --> 00:56:47.020
He's some bad ass dude.
Just fucking like block out that voice.

907
00:56:47.021 --> 00:56:50.500
Anytime you that voice,
it's going to go great.
Make her laugh.

908
00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:55.120
You don't want,
when she said I would that be all,
just ask Jessica for a number.

909
00:56:57.710 --> 00:57:01.800
Do you know you should ask fucking Joe to Rosa.
One time I was with Joe de Rosa.

910
00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.840
You want to talk about guy fearless?

911
00:57:03.841 --> 00:57:07.020
I was with Joe to rose and one time we went out to breakfast and the waitress

912
00:57:07.021 --> 00:57:09.330
came over,
you know,
and uh,

913
00:57:09.331 --> 00:57:11.430
he's Kinda checking her out or whatever and we fucking eating.

914
00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:13.890
We were eating her food and he goes,
when you think of that waitress,
I'm like,

915
00:57:13.891 --> 00:57:16.860
she's cute.
He goes,
yeah.
He goes,
I think I'm going to ask her out.

916
00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:19.230
And she comes back to the table.
It's like,

917
00:57:19.231 --> 00:57:23.850
will that be all any fucking asked her out right in front of me.
Right.

918
00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:28.410
And she gave him his number.
Now if she shot him down,

919
00:57:28.650 --> 00:57:31.770
not only it's like that story would have left.

920
00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:35.100
It's like either would just be like with you,
with a bunch of strangers.

921
00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.350
I could've sat there and laughed at him,
which I wouldn't have.

922
00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:38.191
I wouldn't have laughed at him,

923
00:57:38.191 --> 00:57:40.410
but he maybe he would have thought that I did and he didn't give a fuck.

924
00:57:42.590 --> 00:57:47.570
So I think you go Joe,
to rose on this one.
All right.

925
00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:51.770
Listen,
what is the deal?
You're attracted to her.

926
00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:56.810
You want her number to ask her out.
All right,
so fucking do that.

927
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:59.420
That's what you want.
This the same way you handle your career in life.

928
00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:03.950
What do you want to do?
Go do that.
Who Do you want to be with?

929
00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:09.650
You know that's a different thing cause they have a say but you got to ask.

930
00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:14.030
That's it.
So I dunno.
I Dunno what your deal is.

931
00:58:14.031 --> 00:58:16.730
If you're a funny guy,
whatever your deal is,
I don't know.
Whatever you're doing,

932
00:58:16.731 --> 00:58:20.390
it seems to be working cause you get feeling a vibe like she's India.
All right,

933
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:23.580
so just stop listening to that voice going like Boomi.
Yeah.
Well yeah,

934
00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:28.040
you did say,
Hey,
what happens if she says yes.
Think about that.
All right,

935
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:32.060
there you go.
Alright.
Mixed race relation.
Jesus cry.

936
00:58:32.061 --> 00:58:34.580
A lot of people think I'm an expert on this just because you know

937
00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:39.970
it's lily.
If I fell off a bed.
Hey Bill,
you just,
you fell off a Beto.

938
00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:41.780
I need some advice on fallen off a bed.

939
00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:44.150
I don't know how the hell I ended up in this relationship.

940
00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:46.510
I just met her and I liked her.
I asked her out in and out.

941
00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:47.630
I couldn't get rid of her.

942
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:50.840
I didn't want to get rid of every time I ever thought about breaking up with her

943
00:58:50.841 --> 00:58:54.320
when I was be like,
all in a panic of Holly.
Fuck,

944
00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:57.140
I'm in here with him for three months now.
My God,
the pressure,
the pressure,

945
00:58:57.141 --> 00:58:58.940
all this pressure was building up on myself.

946
00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:02.540
I would always picture her walking out of my apartment.

947
00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:05.630
Then even in the fantasy of getting out of the relationship,

948
00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:07.940
I would always run out to go back and get her.

949
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.270
And then it took me about a good hour,
seven,
eight years to realize bill.

950
00:59:11.271 --> 00:59:15.440
That means because you love her and you don't want her to leave.
Um,
all right.

951
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:19.670
Hey Bill,
you fuckin alabaster bastard,
alabaster bastard.

952
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:25.520
You Alabaster.
Why did you do that?
Hey Bill,
you fucking alabaster.
Uh,

953
00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:29.390
I'm also a white guy who has just started going out with a smoking hot black

954
00:59:29.391 --> 00:59:33.350
chick.
I have no idea what she sees in me,
but who gives a fuck?
Right?

955
00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:36.590
She makes me happy and I seem to be happy.
Make her happy too.

956
00:59:36.591 --> 00:59:40.410
So it's all good until you go outside.
Uh,

957
00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:45.480
so one of my question is someone who's in a successful quote mixed race.

958
00:59:46.731 --> 00:59:48.980
I don't know why it's in quotes,
mixed race relation.

959
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:53.660
I wonder if you have any insights or Gotchas that might help my relationship

960
00:59:53.661 --> 00:59:56.690
list,
make my relationship last.

961
00:59:57.710 --> 01:00:01.640
And do you still experience any casual racism from the mouth breathing morons?

962
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:04.340
<v 4>Uh,</v>

963
01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:09.190
<v 1>I'll spell check this message and be careful to use correct punctuation too.</v>

964
01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:11.410
So Billy,
if you do read it,

965
01:00:11.411 --> 01:00:15.430
you won't sound like a preschool toddler auditioning for sesame street.

966
01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:18.730
Thanks for the podcast.
I listen to them every week and go fuck yourself.

967
01:00:18.731 --> 01:00:22.330
I love how the punctuation is my fault.
Still.
It's still my fault.
I'm the victim.

968
01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:24.063
<v 4>MMM.</v>

969
01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:29.530
<v 1>Do have any insights.
Uh,
yeah,
this is my insight is that,</v>

970
01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.393
uh,

971
01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:37.010
youtube people are different than me and my wife because you're an individual.

972
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:42.090
All right?
So I,
you know,
it's not like wow,
when like,

973
01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.760
it's like when you watch the discovery channel,
well,

974
01:00:44.761 --> 01:00:46.460
when dealing with the hippopotamus,

975
01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:50.430
there's an aggressive behavior when it's fucking partly cloudy.

976
01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:53.970
Um,
uh,

977
01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:57.420
my advice is if you're with somebody and they make you happy,
stay with them.

978
01:00:58.130 --> 01:01:01.860
They don't break up with them.
That's it.
All right?

979
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.210
And if you're in that situation right now and you want to break up with
somebody,

980
01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:10.170
don't use the holidays as an excuse.
All right?
Just get out now.

981
01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.210
Just get out now.

982
01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:15.510
I actually tell you it's better to do it right before the holidays then after.

983
01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.310
Okay.
Cause as much as you're gonna fuck up at Thanksgiving,
Christmas,
Hanukkah,

984
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:25.140
Kwanzaa,
uh,
the new year comes and with the new year they'd be like,

985
01:01:25.141 --> 01:01:28.310
you know,
I'm going to go to the job,
which is going to get,
forget about it.

986
01:01:28.311 --> 01:01:30.780
It was the worst year ever.
You know,

987
01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:34.920
if you fucking wait till after the holidays and then boom,
they're year starts.

988
01:01:34.921 --> 01:01:36.720
He just fucked up their whole next year.

989
01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:41.880
Cause people think in calendar years for whatever reason.
All right,

990
01:01:41.881 --> 01:01:46.320
so getting back to you,
um,
I mean,
what do you want me to say?

991
01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:50.290
Let's start listening to the,
to fucking Jay Z.
MMM.

992
01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:54.770
I will tell you this,
when it comes to that Shit,
uh,
there is uh,

993
01:01:54.771 --> 01:01:56.840
still stay in your own lane kind of thing.

994
01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:00.503
<v 4>MMM.</v>

995
01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:04.890
<v 1>Just cause you're with her,
don't start saying,
uh,</v>

996
01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:08.970
don't start using the expression.
Ah,

997
01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:15.860
this still,
you know,
I guess I can't give you a voice.
There are things like that.

998
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:20.880
There are things like that that no matter how much she loves you,

999
01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:23.790
you will immediately turn into it and annoying white person.

1000
01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.093
And yes,

1001
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:30.210
racism doesn't magically go away because the two of you are now together.

1002
01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.920
But I will be honest with you,

1003
01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:35.220
it's just like if it wasn't racism it would be something else.

1004
01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:38.820
Um,
you know,

1005
01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:42.390
I kept talking about Chicago and Milwaukee and they kept blowing Chicago.

1006
01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:45.050
They didn't like Chicago.
So it's like people,

1007
01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.740
people don't like their next door neighbors.

1008
01:02:46.741 --> 01:02:49.530
They don't like the people they work with.
You know,

1009
01:02:49.531 --> 01:02:53.790
football teams don't like coaches and gms,
that one,
them super bowls.
So if it,

1010
01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:55.890
if it wasn't that,
it will be something else.

1011
01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:58.530
And who gives a shit what other people think?

1012
01:02:58.531 --> 01:03:01.230
You only go around once and you should be with the person you're supposed to be

1013
01:03:01.231 --> 01:03:06.030
with.
That's what I think.
All right,
so have fun.
Enjoy yourselves.
And uh,

1014
01:03:06.031 --> 01:03:10.350
that's it.
All right,
first breakup.
Hey,
Billy,

1015
01:03:10.351 --> 01:03:14.840
Pink Dick.
I don't know what this,
that some cancer thing,
uh,

1016
01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:18.900
been listening to your podcast.
I don't know what that means,

1017
01:03:18.901 --> 01:03:19.800
but that's funny as hell.

1018
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:24.030
But listening to your podcast for a couple of years now and could really use

1019
01:03:24.031 --> 01:03:24.661
your advice.

1020
01:03:24.661 --> 01:03:28.710
I'm a 22 year old college senior and recently have gone through a breakup.

1021
01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:33.420
Uh,
that's great.
He got it done before the holidays,
so she got it done.

1022
01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:35.670
We dated for six months and it was great.

1023
01:03:35.671 --> 01:03:38.550
She was my first girlfriend and my first love.

1024
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:42.240
She was even the first girl I ever had sex with our right.
See,

1025
01:03:42.241 --> 01:03:45.510
not checked it all off,
but as we neared six months,

1026
01:03:45.511 --> 01:03:49.470
I began to worry about committing to a longterm relationship when I've never

1027
01:03:49.471 --> 01:03:51.710
even had sex with another woman.
Uh,

1028
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:56.820
my dick got cold feet and rightly so.
Rightly so,
because as a guy,

1029
01:03:56.821 --> 01:03:59.760
if you're thinking that shit,
you're going to eventually do it.
So why harder?

1030
01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:04.710
Anyway,
so long after,
so after a long talk,
we decided to break up.

1031
01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:07.590
I thought having sex for the first time was tough,

1032
01:04:07.591 --> 01:04:11.370
but breaking up for the first time it was horrible.
Yes it is.
Yes it is.

1033
01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:16.680
I can't seem to get out of this funk.
It's really hard not to miss her.

1034
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.670
What advice do you have for someone going through their first breakup?

1035
01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:24.450
My friends and I have gone to a bar only once or twice since,

1036
01:04:24.451 --> 01:04:26.760
and none of us have any game.

1037
01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:31.740
We stand around the corner of the bar looking like mere cats.
That's hilarious.

1038
01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:35.610
It's the last quarter of the game and I'm down 10 points.

1039
01:04:35.611 --> 01:04:40.530
I could use a motivational speech from coach Ginger pubes over here.

1040
01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:44.730
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
Uh,
all right.

1041
01:04:44.731 --> 01:04:48.900
We obviously have a sense of humor.
Um,
he has to deal to,

1042
01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:50.160
uh,

1043
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:54.270
my advice when you're going through a breakup is rather than doing the guy thing

1044
01:04:54.271 --> 01:04:56.370
and trying to block it out,
like it isn't happening,

1045
01:04:56.371 --> 01:05:00.150
go through the sadness of it all.
Right?
Don't cry in front of your friends,

1046
01:05:00.151 --> 01:05:03.240
but if you got to cry,
cry it audience,
it's actually a healthy thing.

1047
01:05:03.241 --> 01:05:07.380
Crying is a healthy emotion.
I finally figured that out.
You know,

1048
01:05:07.410 --> 01:05:11.490
when I haven't cried enormous 50 fucking years.
So now it's like no longer,
like,

1049
01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:15.810
I dunno,
it's like a room that I walled off.
I mean,

1050
01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:19.810
literally a friend of mine has to die.
I have to be at a fucking funeral,

1051
01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:21.423
you know what I mean?

1052
01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:22.773
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1053
01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:27.080
<v 1>But anyways,
I don't run from the pain of it.</v>

1054
01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:28.160
<v 0>Okay?</v>

1055
01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.630
<v 1>Okay.
That's what women do.</v>

1056
01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:33.380
Women when they fucking break up,

1057
01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.840
they don't fucking run right off for the most part.

1058
01:05:35.841 --> 01:05:39.500
They don't run right out and get into something else.
They stay home.

1059
01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:44.300
They watch sad movies.
They listened to sad fucking,
uh,

1060
01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.070
they listen to sad.
Oh my God.

1061
01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:53.170
The chiefs just did a potato sack race,
celebration,
dance.

1062
01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:59.520
I was actually rooting for them to share.
I was like,
yeah,

1063
01:05:59.521 --> 01:06:01.630
it'd be cool to see them,
but maybe when it,
you know,

1064
01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:04.270
the Patriots hours mediocre is they look

1065
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.670
<v 0>okay</v>

1066
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:08.490
<v 1>and uh,
I got to say fuck that whole franchise</v>

1067
01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:14.200
if not the whole state.
I'm glad the Saint Louis cardinals moved.

1068
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:16.050
I'm even going to take St Louis now.
That was the,

1069
01:06:18.070 --> 01:06:21.700
it's one of the worst things I've ever seen.
Now of course,
show it again.

1070
01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:25.533
<v 0>Why</v>

1071
01:06:27.890 --> 01:06:31.340
<v 1>if we were willing to Dunkin contest when people just out of ideas,
so just,</v>

1072
01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:35.060
it's enough already.
Just spike the ball like Gronk and go back to the sideline.

1073
01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:41.140
Oh boy.
Oh Jesus.
I got to walk that one off.

1074
01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:47.880
You know when you got a Kevin like a fucking separate meeting with,

1075
01:06:47.881 --> 01:06:51.150
for the teammates to get your end zone dance together.
I may just,
I dunno.

1076
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:56.640
Anyways.
Yeah.
What women do correctly is they,
they,
when they're sad,

1077
01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:59.520
they allow themselves to be sad.
If they have to cry,

1078
01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:03.600
they allow themselves to cry and you actually feel better after you do that

1079
01:07:03.601 --> 01:07:06.240
stuff.
It's when you ignore it and you push it down,

1080
01:07:06.241 --> 01:07:10.530
it becomes his fucking weight in your chest or these fucking ball of shit in

1081
01:07:10.531 --> 01:07:12.480
your head.
Um,

1082
01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:13.570
<v 0>okay.</v>

1083
01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:16.600
<v 1>You broke up with somebody and you're sad.
So I would be sad.</v>

1084
01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:20.320
And then as far as going out to a bar,
um,

1085
01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:25.320
you know,
I mean,
I don't know,
how do you learn how to throw a football?

1086
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:28.050
It's the first time you throw a football if you don't throw a tight spiral,

1087
01:07:28.051 --> 01:07:30.870
do you just never throw one again.
You keep doing it and it gets better.

1088
01:07:30.871 --> 01:07:35.660
You got to go out there and uh,
we used to fucking we amen.

1089
01:07:35.690 --> 01:07:37.430
We just go to his place.
Daisy Buchanan said,

1090
01:07:37.431 --> 01:07:42.431
I guess was a legendary meat market on Newbury street in Boston and

1091
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:49.280
we used to,
we used to just fucking,
you went in there like,

1092
01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:52.920
it was almost like a standup comedy thing where you just went up in like

1093
01:07:52.921 --> 01:07:55.080
deliberately tried to bond to make your friends laugh.

1094
01:07:55.350 --> 01:08:00.350
We used to go in there and just any dumb fucking thing we could think of as we

1095
01:08:01.771 --> 01:08:04.070
just kept doing it and doing it and doing it right.

1096
01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:10.250
And it did,
it stopped being the way we got over the fear,

1097
01:08:10.251 --> 01:08:14.090
because it is the fear of rejection.
It's fucking brutal when you're young.
Right?

1098
01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:19.810
So we did is we would hit on some chick while our other buddy could hear it.

1099
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:22.640
So if you started bombing and she wasn't in it,

1100
01:08:22.641 --> 01:08:26.720
you could then just switch over to try to make your friend laugh by making even

1101
01:08:26.721 --> 01:08:30.380
more of a fool yourself.
And then all of a sudden,

1102
01:08:30.381 --> 01:08:34.430
rejection became funny.
It didn't become this like,
oh my God,

1103
01:08:34.431 --> 01:08:38.090
is there something wrong with me?
I want to run out of here.

1104
01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:42.200
Uh,
dude,
you're young.
You're 22 years old,

1105
01:08:43.730 --> 01:08:46.500
<v 3>you know?
Yeah.</v>

1106
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:50.270
<v 1>I,
I don't even know how to say it.</v>

1107
01:08:50.271 --> 01:08:53.870
It's just like I would hit on every cute chick you saw.
You know,

1108
01:08:53.871 --> 01:08:57.350
I'm not saying to go out there and be a fucking man whore,
but you're single and

1109
01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:03.410
I mean,
college life,
that's like the greatest fucking nightclub ever.

1110
01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:07.730
Everybody's single.
Everybody's young and good looking.
I mean,

1111
01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.840
there's no reason.
That's not the time to be shy.

1112
01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:15.530
Get over your shyness and just fucking throw it out there and said,

1113
01:09:15.531 --> 01:09:16.970
who gives a fuck?
Gives a shit

1114
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:23.870
we're saying is that they say no and he'd keep coming back and be fucking times

1115
01:09:23.871 --> 01:09:28.871
I bombed before I got to this level of being able to do my shit and Dick Jokes.

1116
01:09:30.150 --> 01:09:33.650
Um,
all right.
Anyways.

1117
01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:37.880
Oh God.
Now they're just going to keep showing the potato sack.

1118
01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:39.590
They've shown it like three fucking times.

1119
01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:44.560
Um,
anyways.

1120
01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:50.710
Well,
and you know what?
I'm not,
I'm not going to be the crabby old man.

1121
01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.560
Good for those guys and I'm going to keep rooting for the Kansas City chiefs

1122
01:09:53.561 --> 01:09:56.830
cause I know there's long die hard fans.
They got that fucking great stadium.

1123
01:09:57.790 --> 01:10:00.760
Uh,
I walked it off and just say,

1124
01:10:00.761 --> 01:10:03.110
you know what pill the NFL continues to change in.

1125
01:10:03.111 --> 01:10:07.120
A new generation has come in and this is how they celebrate touchdowns and don't

1126
01:10:07.121 --> 01:10:10.330
be the grumpy old man.
Then you should just get the ball back to the ref.

1127
01:10:10.331 --> 01:10:14.290
I'm not going to be that guy.
All right,
great.
Let's see a three legged race next.

1128
01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:19.510
All right.
God bless him.
God bless them.
God bless Dj Music.

1129
01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:21.970
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1130
01:10:21.970 --> 01:10:25.540

That's the podcast for this week.
Um,

1132
01:10:28.810 --> 01:10:32.200
go fuck yourselves and I will check in on you on Thursday.

I'm going to upload a pictures of some of the shit that I did in a Milwaukee

1134
01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:41.290
and,
uh,
some of the Harley Davidsons and all that type of shit.

1135
01:10:41.291 --> 01:10:43.600
And I know there was something else.
Oh,
the Pfister hotel,

1136
01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:47.050
the unfortunately named Pfister hotel.
Um,
I'll,

1137
01:10:47.051 --> 01:10:51.010
I'll upload all of that shit.
All right.
That is it.
I'll talk to you later.
