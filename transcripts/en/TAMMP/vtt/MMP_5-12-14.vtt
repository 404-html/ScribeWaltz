1
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.410
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday.

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.230
Uh,
May 12th.
What's going on?
I am here at the,
uh,

3
00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:14.650
all things comedy podcast studios.
Doug,

4
00:00:14.651 --> 00:00:18.870
Stan hope is going to be here hopefully in a couple of minutes.

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.910
Um,
Doug was a,
had a late night last night at the library.
He was doing some,

6
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.070
some research.
Um,
you know,
a lot of,

7
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.510
a lot of comics like me just go on stage and we just,
you know,
as we call it,

8
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:34.860
shoot from the hip.
And the subtext is that of that is we don't fucking read.

9
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.460
And A,
I'll look who's hair he's here.

10
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.050
Doug actually researches,
dug Stan hope researchers.

11
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:45.640
All of his jokes making his way into the studio.
What's up brother?

12
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.670
At that giant Dr Seuss looking flower.
They stink of Bose and cigarettes.
Oh,

13
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:54.330
they do have a seat.
Welcome.
Wow.
Right on time.

14
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.560
Show up in this condition,
but put on your headphones.
Let's,
let's,
let's do this.

15
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.480
What's up my friend?
Is His mic on?
Yeah,

16
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.350
I don't hear it.
Ah,
Jesus.

17
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.220
Y'all think comedy's a fucking microphone.
Check.
Test.
Hey,
there we go.

18
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.440
Toad.
Yeah.

19
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.590
Just say my manager put the top down in his car and went,

20
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.210
as soon as I put the top down,

21
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:21.390
I could smell the booze coming off of you from the street.
Oh,

22
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:23.610
I don't smell it dude.
You're fine.
I was just,

23
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:26.820
I was just telling everybody that you were out at the library researching,
uh,

24
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.200
just doing,
making sure,
you know,

25
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:31.170
when you go to tell you jokes that you have all your facts in order.
I do.

26
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.290
Absolutely.
You want to chill.
You are one of the field.

27
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.560
There's occasionally I'll find some bullshit where I don't want to find it and I

28
00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:40.890
don't fuck it.
I'm telling the joke anyway.
No one's going to know.

29
00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:42.690
But for the most part I want to be right.

30
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.800
Is it anything worse than when you have a joke you love?
And then after the show,

31
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:51.660
an audience member comes up with actual facts that completely ruins your whole

32
00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:52.040
point.

33
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.040
My most downloaded bit about winning pussy on a bed back in the 90s,

34
00:01:57.931 --> 00:02:02.460
and it was a red sox twin's game.
Excuse me.
And uh,
yeah,

35
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:06.450
I got the numbers wrong.
Mo Vaughn didn't hit a home run,
he hit an RBI.

36
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.100
Some fact checker went back and found the game that I go into detail about and

37
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:15.050
it wasn't a home run,
but it's already recorded.
I can't take it back.
Oh,

38
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.120
it crushes you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
I was a bit wrong,

39
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:21.600
but the fucking red sox won and Bobby Barnett fucked me.
Well,
I love,

40
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.840
I just loved the fact that somebody can go back and find the Goddamn game.

41
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.280
Like then just and just,
just to be a car.
What kind of a who would care?

42
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.770
This is how Brian Hennigan,
he's my filter.
Uncut Scotsman,
manager.
Oh.

43
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:36.750
And and my ride.
Yeah.
We met,
uh,
when you were doing the,
uh,

44
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:40.320
the Wiltern you and now when it came down there and hung out.
Well,
uh,

45
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.970
what the hell did you do last night?

46
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.830
I tried to podcast with Marilyn Manson at his house.
Okay.

47
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.450
Last night into today.

48
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.360
So we have four hours of unusable footage or he's very open about what we were

49
00:02:55.471 --> 00:03:00.190
partaking in.
I told her I want you to hear that.
Okay.
Two to what?
No Dude,

50
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.750
I am.
I'm like,
I don't want to get you put this out.
And he's like,
yeah,

51
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.340
I have no problem with it.
I get a text message on the way here.

52
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.630
You can't put that out.
Oh,
okay.
Well then let's not talk about what happened.

53
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.250
So you in Maryland playing board games,

54
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.190
you got to know you've got a little lost in it.
Yeah.
Monopoly.

55
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:18.220
One of those Parker brothers,
one's that just goes all night,
you know as it does.

56
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:20.440
And Bingo was supposed to be here with me,

57
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:23.980
but she took some of that board game home with her enough to put her in a

58
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:28.240
catatonic state.
Okay.
So I woke up after four hours of sleep.
She's,

59
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:32.890
we're in an air B and B,
the owner comes in,
he's talking to her,

60
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:36.910
excuse me,
excuse me,
is some Israeli guy and she won't even look at him.

61
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.920
She's that blown out of her gourd.

62
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.550
She actually was the one who texted me back this morning and I texted your phone

63
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:45.250
to make sure you were still coming.
She actually said,
Hey Bingo here.

64
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.470
That's how I know.
Cause she texted me.
Sorry,
I uh,

65
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.340
I answered your text to Bill Burr,

66
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.410
but I just took a pot candy while that probably not good on top of everything

67
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:57.244
else you've done.

68
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.710
Now you're taking medicinal marijuana when you're already psychotic through.

69
00:04:01.711 --> 00:04:05.160
When is his TV show coming out?
I want to watch this.
You,

70
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.780
it's funny as a week would be a yeah,
I am on,

71
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.120
I'm on the exact opposite road right now.
I'm getting ready to do with special.

72
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.260
So I have been a fuck other than cigars.
I'd been a fucking choirboy and dude,

73
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.540
I,
I feel great in the morning.

74
00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:23.380
He's behind on the podcast so I kinda hate being here cause I'm not caught up.

75
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.970
Oh No,
no.

76
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.780
And I want to open by apologizing to your listeners because if you're any type

77
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:33.640
of fan of the podcast like I am,
I fucking hate it when you have a guest.
Oh,

78
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:36.130
I'm sorry for being here.
No,
no,
no.
Come on dude.

79
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:39.100
You're talking about playing board games with Marilyn Manson.
My fans,

80
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:42.580
I liken this,
I hope they are,
I don't want to speak for him.
I'm sure though,

81
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:45.400
how you won,
do shunts on the Twitter.

82
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.200
I shaking his head always her head.
Always.
Always one guy that ruins it.

83
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.610
But yeah,
no,
I said I go this,
I'm such an anachronism right now.

84
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.710
He's got a Lexus convertible.

85
00:04:56.711 --> 00:05:01.300
I'm an a leisure suit with a head full of cocaine racing here.

86
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.410
Just making sure I don't forget flowers for Nia.
Yeah,

87
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:07.150
your sweetheart right there.
Why would the,

88
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:09.370
why would the listeners not like you do what I got to tell you,

89
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:12.010
you're pulling off that leisure suit like,
like nobody's business.

90
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:16.210
He looked great.
That really is you.
Those things should come back.
I wish I,

91
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:18.490
you know,
something that whole fucking fad,
you know,
with uh,

92
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.090
everybody started wearing the bing Crosby Fidor is and everything.

93
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.040
I so wanted to jump on that.
I just don't have the head for it.

94
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.190
It would know the 70s is like this.

95
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.260
I'm so in a leisure suits and the dumb seventies outfits I watched like you

96
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:36.100
watch a slap shot.
The original one,
I was just watching the outfits.

97
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:40.690
They had the ridiculous pounds.
Paul Newman crushes a leisure suit.

98
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.830
Fantastic.

99
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.070
Hey did you know it's funny that just reminded me of was back in the day when,

100
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:49.310
uh,
you were doing that show with Rogan,
the man show you guys the originals,

101
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.430
you the second year,
the second home second when you,
uh,

102
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.080
Rogan had some fucking race car that he was driving and your parking spot was

103
00:05:57.081 --> 00:05:59.850
right next to him.
So you,
you wanted to go out and buy the ugliest spot,

104
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.260
the biggest piece of shit.
And that's why the show sucked so bad.

105
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.010
Instead of trying to write better bits that we wouldn't even have gotten on the

106
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:07.844
air to begin with,

107
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.690
I just sit on Ebay and try to find the biggest piece of shit car.

108
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.080
I love that you find like a two door car convertible with fake wood siding,

109
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.540
80 dodge aspen.
Oh,
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.340
It was painted lime green with a white racing stripe and it was an unbeatable,

111
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:28.460
not even a convertible.
It was just had the top off.

112
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.360
So it looked like there's a top underneath the vinyl thing in the back.

113
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:34.820
Why did I even remember?
Would I just remember seeing it going next?

114
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.310
Nica was so fucking awful.
It was,
it was awesome.

115
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.560
And I had the props department makeup of bumper sticker that says I'm with Rogan

116
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.050
with an Arrow pointing towards his car cause he had like $120,000 Porsche.

117
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.290
So we'll get a joining spots in the lot.
So yeah.
Where did,
how did you find,

118
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.130
did you find it in California?
I,
yeah,
it was like Fresno.

119
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.520
It was a long road trip and uh,

120
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.930
the scariest ride home ever cause that things shouldn't have been on the road.

121
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.070
You know what I love about California is that you can find like those cars,

122
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.260
they live forever out here.
Like I saw a Chevy Monza.
Oh yeah,
I remember those.

123
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:11.060
I've seen like two chevettes.

124
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.200
I mean Chevy Chevette like you can't find those on e that they look for a

125
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:19.070
Chevette.
You can't find it on time.
They would like for the,
for the young people,

126
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.730
that was basically our answer to like the Honda civic was supposed to be,

127
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:25.340
are trying to get,
you know,
catch up with the Japanese people.

128
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.660
And it was made by Chevy.
It fucking died at 60,000 miles.

129
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:31.730
There was absolutely nothing cool.
My parents had,

130
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:34.730
two of them are 78 and 80 and uh,

131
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:39.731
I mean they were both gone in the crusher by like Ida Chevy citation for a while

132
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:44.630
on the road.
Sideways radio.
No.
Do you remember the year they,

133
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.553
they forgot.

134
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.610
They forgot to design a radio in there and then they will like fuck it.

135
00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:52.880
And they literally turned it sideways and didn't even change the numbers.

136
00:07:52.881 --> 00:07:55.160
My buddy had one,
I swear to God.
That's true.

137
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.440
Do you know how much that would sell for now?

138
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.020
Like what we used to consider a piece of shit.

139
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.510
Remember in Massachusetts they would have winter cars.

140
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.920
Someone would buy my romantic cat road,
but they'd have a winter car.
Yeah,

141
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:11.030
that's right.
Yeah.
The fucking t that went to car.
Right now it's self reg.

142
00:08:11.031 --> 00:08:14.540
Eight grand if is in decent shape.
I know it's unreal.

143
00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:17.630
Our childhood has worked with a fucking fortune now.
It kills me,

144
00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:22.130
but I hate how it's all being sort of mocked,
you know,
like everything.
Like,
I,

145
00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:23.140
you can't,
I can't wear,

146
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.900
like I liked when all those old school hipster tee shirts came out because I

147
00:08:26.901 --> 00:08:31.160
actually liked a lot of that stuff until I realized that they were making fun of

148
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:35.930
it.
And then just maybe like,
yeah,
my childhood's a joke.
That's irony.
No.
Yeah,

149
00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:39.980
I liked all those cereals in the Tang and all the shit that we grew up with.

150
00:08:39.981 --> 00:08:42.950
Like I have a lot of [inaudible] I,
yeah,
count Chucky was the shit.

151
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:43.691
I like blueberries,

152
00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:48.691
Zarek Srx Europe that you would pour in the water and it was only New England,

153
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.100
but it was a syrup you'd put into water and Zebra on the,
on the,
on the label.

154
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.550
Yeah.
[inaudible]
as good as can be.

155
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:01.770
Just remember that Z.
Holy Shit.

156
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.600
Oh Shit.
Where the fuck did that come from?

157
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.580
I have a ton of that since like the fucking seventies.
That was another thing.

158
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:12.980
They had all those,
Greg was dude,

159
00:09:12.981 --> 00:09:17.250
it was all about getting hopped up on sugar and then watching these acid trip

160
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.410
can,
uh,
um,
like cartoons,
cause like all the writers,

161
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.150
the new generations of writers who were doing drugs.

162
00:09:24.151 --> 00:09:27.600
And thought it was this hip thing and didn't realize,
you know,
cocaine,

163
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:29.940
the big lie,
everything that was coming in the 80s.

164
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.610
So they were kind of coming in the 80s.
Yeah.

165
00:09:32.611 --> 00:09:37.320
They were kind of like steering you down that fucking road,
like to,
uh,

166
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.450
if you want watch cartoons,
right.

167
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.170
There's a shift somewhere in the late sixties,

168
00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:46.020
early seventies where the older people are out.
If you watch this,

169
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:47.760
an old Flintstones one where they make,

170
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:49.560
and they're actually making fun of the Beatles.

171
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.060
Remember that one where they had that dead bug music now and book was,

172
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.500
it was a bunch of bugs.

173
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.950
It was supposed to be the Beatles and they like this song they was singing and

174
00:09:58.951 --> 00:10:01.710
they literally was monotone,
like tone deaf.
They were just going,

175
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:06.740
<v 1>yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
He said,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
We said,
yeah,</v>

176
00:10:06.741 --> 00:10:07.650
yeah,
yeah.
And

177
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.910
<v 0>then they'd scream like Paul Mccartney,
I want,</v>

178
00:10:09.911 --> 00:10:12.450
which is actually a lot of what the Beatles were,

179
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.190
early orange Lee overrated band.
You think so.
Love,
love me.

180
00:10:17.191 --> 00:10:20.760
Do you know I love you.
Really?
That's fucking genius.
Yeah.

181
00:10:20.761 --> 00:10:23.580
But that was the horse shit when they wanted the labels control and once they

182
00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:27.870
got out of that it started doing drugs.
Yeah.
Robert's soul and fucking uh,

183
00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:30.280
you know,
white album,
I think it was like the same.

184
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.900
They stand the test of time took on tape about the Beatles,
but the guy,
the,

185
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.950
the author was going into such great detail about how genius they were,

186
00:10:37.951 --> 00:10:41.820
but talking about that dog shit.
Sixties.
Yeah.
You don't,

187
00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:45.740
you don't like the Beatles?
No,
not really there.
Okay.
I got to Harold died.

188
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.450
I got to hear it.
I got to hear it now.
This is just,
this is a very unique,

189
00:10:48.451 --> 00:10:51.390
I don't like music to begin with,
so I'm not the guy to talk to.

190
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.240
I'm just not a fan.
Yeah.

191
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:58.220
I listened to music the way most people listen to standup up.

192
00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:02.340
Maybe once a year they go to a live show,
right?
Yeah.

193
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:07.650
Maybe I'll watch it initial what happened?
It just never caught on with me.

194
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.261
Mid intercept,

195
00:11:09.261 --> 00:11:12.480
one of it's one of the fucking only good things human beings I've ever done.

196
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.630
I'm sure we had to chop down some trees to make all those guitars and oboes and

197
00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:22.680
shit.
But I mean generally speaking,
just,
yeah,
it's not my thing.

198
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:23.700
I don't mind it.

199
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.880
Like on my iPod I downloaded a bunch of Basey and Duke Ellington.

200
00:11:29.251 --> 00:11:32.860
Shit,
that doesn't interrupt your train of thought.
No lyrics,
just nice.

201
00:11:32.861 --> 00:11:36.750
Does that help on music,
Doug Stanhope Music?
He doesn't mind.
I don't mind.

202
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.370
I mean if you have to have it on,
yeah,
as long as it's in the background,

203
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.160
I don't want to yell over it.
I don't want the words confusing.

204
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:47.100
What I'm trying to think about in a conversation or where when I'm trying to

205
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:50.430
write,
I remember being on a flight with you on American Airlines,

206
00:11:50.431 --> 00:11:53.250
some random thing and I was uh,
you know,

207
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.040
I think we're both pretty hung over and we took pictures together.
We did.
Yeah,

208
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.400
we did.
And I remember that was when American Airlines,

209
00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:01.690
when you went to go get off,

210
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.630
which start playing that music and their jingle and a thing and you,

211
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.110
you would've gotten a phone call and I was so hung over,

212
00:12:08.111 --> 00:12:12.520
I forgot you on the plane and I just heard from three rows back your voice like,

213
00:12:12.521 --> 00:12:16.390
Oh Greg,
can I call you back?
I'm getting air raped by American Airlines.

214
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:22.300
It's all these families there with children and stuff.
I'm just like,
Jesus,

215
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.950
this guy fights the fight from 8:00 AM on.
I don't have that kind of fight me.

216
00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:30.940
I was just like,
all right,
I'll listen to it.
Just walking off like a Zombie.

217
00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:32.470
You're already fucking,
you should have spent

218
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.120
that got signed on the dotted line.
Hey,
I got,

219
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.700
you know something when I was doing my three minutes of research that I had to

220
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:43.181
do on you,

221
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:45.670
cause I've known you for so fucking long and I knew I didn't have to do it.

222
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:50.710
I had no idea.
You've put out like 13 fucking albums I have.

223
00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:55.510
Some of those are like,
one was like a XM radio's special event.

224
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.240
So all right.
What's your,
okay,

225
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.940
you got 1998 the great white Stan hope that's an hour.

226
00:13:00.941 --> 00:13:03.130
I don't even admit that exist.

227
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:08.320
99 CICO CICO is most of the good parts of the first one I put out through a

228
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:12.400
piece of shit.
So we'll give you a one there.
2000 something to take the edge off.

229
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:17.230
2001 I said bootleg 2000 to die laughing.

230
00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:22.060
2003 word of mouth.
2004 dead beat hero do that.
That's one,

231
00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:25.750
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven years in a row you took oh five off.

232
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:30.010
Put your feet up,
right.
Oh six morbid obscenity.

233
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.570
Now as a benefit thing for guys.
Long Story.
Okay,
so we'll knock that one off.

234
00:13:34.571 --> 00:13:39.040
You still up to six or seven isn't all that fun killer?
No refunds.

235
00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.170
I know that that's a failure because I saw that,
uh,

236
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.930
from across the street and Oh nine oh 11 is that also like Norway burning the

237
00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:50.590
bridges to nowhere.
2012 before turning the gun on himself.

238
00:13:50.591 --> 00:13:54.270
What a great fucking title and three Beer Hall.
How do you,
how do you judge?

239
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:55.121
What is,

240
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:59.110
what is porch beer hall putsch was a Hitler's failed attempt to overthrow the

241
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:04.140
German government in 24 and they'd all meet and beer halls and they'd Riley each

242
00:14:04.271 --> 00:14:07.720
other up and just scream and yell about the government and all of this in a bar.

243
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.540
And when can you imagine drinking weed?
Hitler.
How much fun would that be?

244
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.620
Like just 1500 shares is just getting them all riled up.
Just be like,
yeah,

245
00:14:13.621 --> 00:14:15.510
I don't know.
I kind of like juice and just to watch,
well,

246
00:14:15.511 --> 00:14:18.520
I don't know what you're talking about.
Just the,
see I'll fucking magic.

247
00:14:18.521 --> 00:14:20.050
And they always closes.
Hitler.

248
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.820
Hitler always get to close to get them all worked up into a lather,

249
00:14:24.821 --> 00:14:29.290
but Hitler,
he goes up,
no Hitler.
What's my wave?
Hitler will go on whenever,

250
00:14:29.291 --> 00:14:32.530
but no one wants to follow him.
Like that's his,
I'm not going on if that,

251
00:14:32.531 --> 00:14:35.830
once he gets to work dirty to follow him,
you can't win either.

252
00:14:35.831 --> 00:14:40.390
They either they don't like him and he just burns down the room or they there's

253
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.500
so into him he just can't follow the fucking gun.
Um,
yeah,

254
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:47.000
but he got them all to take to the streets finally to go over,

255
00:14:47.001 --> 00:14:50.290
throw the government and a few people get shot and he ran like a pussy.

256
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.620
So that's the significance is I talk a lot of shit,
but when it comes down to it,

257
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.700
I don't do anything but it's just yell in bars is my point.

258
00:14:58.701 --> 00:15:00.920
Isn't it amazing how back in the day,
how,

259
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:05.900
because of the lack of technology that you could actually assemble a bunch of

260
00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:10.190
people in a bar and have them believe that they could overthrow the government

261
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:13.190
of your country or without a microphone.
Yeah.
Dude,

262
00:15:13.191 --> 00:15:15.740
let's just walk down the street.
All right.

263
00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:18.080
All of us and just what are you going to do?

264
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.160
Like what door you going into even fucking worked out how to get into the

265
00:15:22.161 --> 00:15:25.700
parliament building.
Like,
what are you going to like the fact that they actually,

266
00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:27.300
I know you,
they were shit faced probably,

267
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:31.730
but the fact that that was actually like doable,
like nowadays,

268
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:34.580
I mean the amount of fucking people as you were doing it,

269
00:15:34.581 --> 00:15:36.740
like it would be tweeting like,
you know,

270
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.600
group over here thinking of taking over the government,
shaking my head away.

271
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.030
There's video of it as you went down the street,

272
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.350
they'd be like news helicopters shaking it.
They would turn it in,

273
00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.370
do a fucking reality show before it even got off the ground.

274
00:15:51.371 --> 00:15:53.240
The fact that you could actually do that.
But uh,

275
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.290
here's something I actually learned about Hitler when I got it was just on my

276
00:15:56.291 --> 00:15:58.840
honeymoon over and we went over to France when I went to,
no,

277
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.530
I'm a fan of the podcast.
They listen.

278
00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:05.420
How fucking I was detailed you so much at the beginning of that where you're

279
00:16:05.421 --> 00:16:05.690
like,

280
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:10.010
I'm going to do all this stuff because I'm the guy that I would go there and

281
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:14.390
just find a bar.
The whole idea of France bores me just,

282
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:19.100
and you were so glowing about how much I'm going to go do this and that.

283
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.750
I always was only a small amount of time before you fell into exactly like I'm

284
00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:25.400
going to go look at this fucking thing.

285
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.540
Like how long can you look at a fucking thing where three ob for whatever.
Yeah.

286
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.080
Here's what happened though.
I went up to the,
uh,

287
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.290
the Eiffel Tower and there was no,
the line was really short.

288
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.170
It's like pink's hot dog.
You go buy it.
If it's a short line,

289
00:16:38.171 --> 00:16:40.180
you don't even want a hot dog.
You're like,
well,
we got to do it.

290
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.770
This is was fucking line.
So we went up.
It was totally worth it.
Dude,

291
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:47.980
I'm a contrarian.
I'm a grumpy cunt.
I went over there,
I put a smile on my face.

292
00:16:47.981 --> 00:16:51.820
I knew if I went over there and I was my usual Douche and I acted like I was at

293
00:16:51.821 --> 00:16:54.190
Disney world,
I was going to ruin my wife's honeymoon.

294
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.080
And why do you think I would ever hear the end of that?
It's not even that,

295
00:16:59.081 --> 00:17:03.400
just to ruin that part of her fucking Douchey Nez came out that I felt okay

296
00:17:03.401 --> 00:17:07.260
about myself.
Like what?
I would have been such a douchey over there cause oh no,

297
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:08.800
I wasn't.
No,
that was a sweet thing to me.

298
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.570
Like Rhode Island,
you're just a contrarion.

299
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:18.180
Maybe you don't like music and you don't like France.
I mean,
what else?

300
00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.220
What else don't you like?
Let me guess.
You don't like Italian food?

301
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:24.010
I think it's overrated with the deliciousness.

302
00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:29.110
I like the Spaghetti and meatballs and all those supermodels,
you know,

303
00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.220
not really my style.
I mean you can kind of look at them,
whatever

304
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.190
I have.
Hey,
when we come back,
we're going to talk about,
well,
how overrated.

305
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.690
The blow job is.
Not a fan,
not a fan on a fan of the blow job.

306
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.730
Never really come.
Never really from the,

307
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.910
from the beginning or just because you're so tainted at this point?

308
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.050
Well at this point I'm worthless,
but even in my best day.
Yeah.
All right.

309
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:57.330
I feel bad for you having to do that.
Really?
Yeah.

310
00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.600
What about what the fuck you want to do?
At least at jobs out in the open.

311
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.210
You got to sit there and like you're in fucking nom on point.

312
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.420
How many minutes are we in here?
I gotta I gotta read some advertising.

313
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:12.150
18 minutes and I got to,
I'm going to sell my soul here.

314
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:17.070
You have made this like you fucking up ads.

315
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.270
You don't fast forward through an ad.

316
00:18:21.271 --> 00:18:24.720
You actually listened to the commercial because you fucked them up and it's

317
00:18:24.721 --> 00:18:29.260
Alaria is that you're actually listening to ads like you look forward to the ad,

318
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:34.320
but I'm saying you could sell ad space for more money than any other podcasts

319
00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:36.000
because Yo,
hey,
I have,

320
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.780
I have this thing that I do where I will fuck up and assassinate your

321
00:18:39.781 --> 00:18:42.870
advertisements so badly.
No one,
we'll skip it.
Yeah,

322
00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:46.620
but the sad thing is is I'm trying,
I'm actually trying to get better at this.

323
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.680
I like to think that I could be one of those news anchors on ESPN,

324
00:18:49.681 --> 00:18:51.400
but I know when I read out these,
I lives as,

325
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.720
I could never would fucking hat I read the same way.
All right,
here we go.

326
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.930
Okay guys,
please don't look at me when I tried to do this.
All right.

327
00:18:57.931 --> 00:18:59.790
Dollar Shave club,
everybody.

328
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:05.160
Nothing feels better than that first shave with a fresh blade,
right?
It's smooth,

329
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.100
it's close and the blade is as sharp as it's ever going to be.

330
00:19:08.101 --> 00:19:09.990
It's that goddamn damn it fills family.
You know what I hate?

331
00:19:09.991 --> 00:19:14.100
Bill is going down to those Goddamn Walgreens or cvs and you have to stand in

332
00:19:14.101 --> 00:19:17.840
line besides behind some junky just to buy my goddamn raisers.

333
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.810
Tell me about people are shooting at me with live ammunition.

334
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.130
How am I going to get a nice shave and you're just waiting for what?

335
00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:27.330
Overprice blades.

336
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:32.420
Wouldn't it be wonderful if somebody recognize that problem and came up with the

337
00:19:32.791 --> 00:19:35.340
solution?
Something I would not be a contrarian about.

338
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:39.930
I will appreciate a decent shame delivered right to my door or savior has come.

339
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.920
It's dollar shave club.
Uh,
where the fuck do,
I jumped too in the copy here,

340
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:45.270
but just a couple bucks a month.

341
00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:49.800
Dollar Shave club.com ships me the highest quality blades you can get.

342
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:53.400
I'm a four blade guy,
evidently from the person who wrote this coffee,

343
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.620
they were in my head that looks like a four blade shave.
Okay?

344
00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.580
Say it right off the bat when I say,
how many fucking blades do you need?

345
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.210
If it's sharp and with dollar Shave Club,

346
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.150
what are you gonna slit your throat four times.
And with dollar shave club,

347
00:20:05.151 --> 00:20:06.600
it only cost share with a friend.

348
00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.010
But for six bucks a month for a four pack,
seriously,

349
00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:13.200
only six bucks for the best quality blades you can get.

350
00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:16.600
So every week I can pop in a fresh blade and treat myself to an amazing God damn

351
00:20:16.601 --> 00:20:19.260
shape.
Doug,

354
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:31.650

with have upgraded.
That's a typo from last week.
This is stupid.

355
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:36.060
They've upgraded from shaving with that old thing.
We're reading this stuff.

356
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:40.140
This is all off the top and I'm one of them and I'm loving it.

357
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.120
Now it's your turn.
Shave time,

358
00:20:42.121 --> 00:20:46.980

359
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.950
simple.
I think it's going to make these kids even softer with their timeouts.

360
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.190
You know?
I can't even believe they can grow whiskers.
All right.
Oh,

361
00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.650
we should go to sports and we should go to [inaudible].
I know how the,

362
00:20:59.651 --> 00:21:03.100
I know the format.
Wait a minute.
What?
You want to go to sports?

363
00:21:03.101 --> 00:21:06.010
We're going to go to sports,
but I got to read a couple more of these fuckers.

364
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.090
I try to do half and half.
I'm trying to break it up like a great book.

365
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.360
Hulu plus it that he makes sense.
Hulu plus everybody.
You know what?

366
00:21:13.361 --> 00:21:15.340
You've probably tried Hulu on your computer.

367
00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:19.750
Hulu plus is so much more with Hulu plus you can watch current season episodes

368
00:21:19.751 --> 00:21:21.550
of your favorite shows like modern family,

369
00:21:21.551 --> 00:21:26.551
the daily show and scandal and watch every episodes of shows like Nashville lost

370
00:21:26.861 --> 00:21:27.341
and doctor,

371
00:21:27.341 --> 00:21:32.341
who is that back swap with any of the red slash green color coded shows listed.

372
00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:36.460
I wasn't supposed to say that.
These,
this isn't Carla coated.

373
00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:39.040
It's in black and white,
I suppose to what shows do you like?
Doug,

374
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:42.160
what's your favorite show out there?
I hate music and fuck the Beatles.

375
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.460
Boardwalk empire is a of fantastic chentastic show.

376
00:21:45.461 --> 00:21:49.480
You know what I'm going to say that Hulu plus has it that they do.
You know what?

377
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.790
I would be surprised if they didn't.
Um,

378
00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:58.160
you get ad free movies.
How about friends and kids show up.

379
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.300
They have friends and Ross starts dancing around.
I love it.

380
00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:06.580
And then shy Chandler makes a snide comment.
I'm now more than ever,

381
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.110
there's so much to watch.

382
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:13.140
Take total control with Hulu plus to stream these shows and thousands more,

383
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.840
as much as you want,
wherever you want.
That's a terribly written sentence.

384
00:22:16.841 --> 00:22:21.760
Hulu plus works on gear,
computer,
smart TV,
Roku,
apple TV,

385
00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.790

play station.
Pretty much every streaming device you own,

386
00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.960
you can even watch on your phone and iPad while you're on the train and at work

387
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.410
at the dentist or in the bathroom,
you can even block off a data bench.

388
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.180
You can do it wherever the hell you want to.

389
00:22:34.181 --> 00:22:38.320
They even have original shows like dead beat a comedy about a pot smoking guy.

390
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.850
Oh,
talks to ghosts.
There you go.
Doug.

391
00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.990
Binge on all 10 episodes starting April 9th.

392
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.050

he gets all your shows anytime.
Any way.

393
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:50.440
How do you do it?
For Christ's sake?
Where the hell is it the whole week?

394
00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:56.730
Just go to Hulu plus.com/norm what I'm trying to speed up through this right

Bill.
Slash.

398
00:23:09.761 --> 00:23:13.870
They said norm.
You know what I like,
Norm Mcdonald.
Let's,
let's give him,

399
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.510
let's give him the money for the week.
Didn't even though he had a podcast.

400
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:20.980
Oh yeah,
dude.
Norm Mcdonald.
Did you see him on Conan telling that math joke?
No.

401
00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.530
Yeah,
he got to see it.
No,
I haven't,
dude.
I'd like,

402
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.340
you know how many comics out there don't give a fuck,
but kind of still do.

403
00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:32.260
You have to kind of still do to eat that guy.
Norm doesn't,
he's so free money.

404
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.550
What am I,
what am I best opening monologue jokes ever?
Did you ever see,
uh,

405
00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.080
you know,

406
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.760
I remember that whole thing when he was doing weekend update and they told him

407
00:23:39.761 --> 00:23:43.090
to make it funnier.
So he and he did and he just,

408
00:23:43.091 --> 00:23:46.820
he just was more norm than next week.
Eventually of course he gets fired.
So then,

409
00:23:46.821 --> 00:23:50.000
you know,
he goes,
you know,
it goes off into the Hollywood world.

410
00:23:50.001 --> 00:23:52.040
He's got a TV show or hit movie or some shit.

411
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:55.880
So now they bring them back to guest host on SNL and he,

412
00:23:55.881 --> 00:24:00.230
I'm going to butcher this,
but he kinda came out.
He's like,
yeah,
so I,
you know,

413
00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:02.810
I get,
yeah,
you people now I got fired from the show.

414
00:24:02.811 --> 00:24:05.970
So now they got me back hosting,
which means either a,

415
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:09.710
I got a lot funnier of this show sucks.

416
00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:15.320
That's he opened up with and I know that that wasn't approved.

417
00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.570
Sorry for the bad norm.
I'll have j Morton has to make up for,

418
00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:22.790
that was a great norm.
Norm listening to norm on stern or anything,

419
00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.660
any podcast listening to,

420
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:29.540
I don't know if you remember when Charles Grodin would do Letterman and just

421
00:24:29.541 --> 00:24:34.410
knowing he's going on there that it was always a fucking great show.
Oh yeah.

422
00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.970
What people didn't get that he was fucking around.
That's how norm is.

423
00:24:37.971 --> 00:24:42.000
Anytime I have norms,
the guests,
I'm fucking listening.
Do you know there's a,

424
00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:47.460
there's a Cha Charles Grodin was on SNL and there's a host sketch where he see

425
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:51.500
actually breaks character and is talking to Belushi and all those guys when they

426
00:24:51.501 --> 00:24:55.730
have the be outfits on going,
I mean that the antennas are distracting.

427
00:24:55.731 --> 00:25:00.050
He acted like he wasn't there for rehearsal because he was too busy shopping

428
00:25:00.051 --> 00:25:02.990
doing this whole big Hollywood thing and they just make it so fucking,

429
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.370
I mean because awkward is so popular now,
a lot of people doing it in comedy.

430
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.040
Just to think that they did this back in the late seventies and a lot of people

431
00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:14.660
the next fucking day thought that he truly skipped rehearsal and he was killed.

432
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.620
That was actually the sketch.
Like I,

433
00:25:16.621 --> 00:25:20.540
I didn't know I d I think midnight run is one of the most underrated copies of

434
00:25:20.541 --> 00:25:21.021
all time,

435
00:25:21.021 --> 00:25:24.380
him and Deniro in that Charles Grodin is fucking absolutely brilliant in that

436
00:25:24.381 --> 00:25:26.120
thing.
So there's one for you.

437
00:25:26.121 --> 00:25:29.990
I Bet Hulu plus has that one to Hulu plus for only seven 99 a month.

438
00:25:29.991 --> 00:25:33.110
You can get four blades dragged across your face as you watch,

439
00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.220
you watch your favorite TV show.

440
00:25:35.221 --> 00:25:40.030
So I got to talk a little sports his come on Michael.
Sam,
do you watch,
uh,

441
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:43.420
do you watch 'em and h hockey at all?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

442
00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.500
Do you tolerate anything in the playoffs?

443
00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:49.580
I find it important to have a favorite team.
Okay.
And the playoffs.

444
00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:52.310
Who's your favorite team right now in NHL?

445
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:56.180
All my teams are not in it.
Not Senators,

446
00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.710
like the Winnipeg jets.
I liked like the Buffalo Sabres,
the Sabres.

447
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.510
I don't mind the Sabers,
but

448
00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.680
yeah,
we went down for a minute.
Yes we did.
That almost never happens.

449
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.550
Your podcast.
I don't know if it just seems like,
you know what,

450
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:19.190
I'm just going to keep talking and if there's a fuck up,

451
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.210
you don't seem to fuck up,
but you don't seem to edit.
No,
I don't.
I don't edit.

452
00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.640
I don't edit thing.
I just sort of do it.
Like right now,

453
00:26:25.641 --> 00:26:28.990
we just freaked everybody out.
Like they were going 90 miles an hour in,

454
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.570
heading towards Nhl and then we just literally just went like,
Oh hey,

455
00:26:32.571 --> 00:26:36.680
what the fuck this so sorry about.
Sorry about that mind.
Fuck for everybody.
No,

456
00:26:36.681 --> 00:26:39.740
I don't edit them because it's work and I didn't get in this business to have a

457
00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:40.720
job.
Right.
Okay.

458
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.800
I got in this business because I had jobs and they didn't like it.

459
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.390
I didn't like coming there and having somebody fucking going,
hey,
you know,

460
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.890
pick that up and fucking put it on.
I,
you fucking do it.

461
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.320
I know what I'm supposed to do.
You idiot.

462
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:54.480
I could mentally like all the fucking jobs I had,

463
00:26:54.481 --> 00:26:57.060
I mentally could have done after the third grade.

464
00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.220
So that was one of the things that pissed me off.
Like,

465
00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:02.910
why did I go through all of that horseshit and ruining my summers and going to

466
00:27:02.911 --> 00:27:06.840
summer school all those years in fucking high school and if this was what I was

467
00:27:06.841 --> 00:27:10.920
going to do,
load and unload trucks.
Yeah.
Ups.
That was the big job in Wooster,

468
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:14.370
dude.
I got to say that was one of the most fun fucking jobs I ever had.

469
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.790
The health and boxes graveyard.
Funniest.
Well I wouldn't,
I didn't do ups.

470
00:27:17.791 --> 00:27:19.440
Ups was like fucking,
you know,

471
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.330
it was like pledging a frat that you never got asked to join.

472
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.110
Um,
it,
it was,
no,
it was like a software company.

473
00:27:28.111 --> 00:27:32.340
We're an intermediate between the people who made software and then they
shipped,

474
00:27:32.341 --> 00:27:34.540
we had a,
all,
all of it.
You could be at all right here.

475
00:27:34.541 --> 00:27:35.610
It was like before the Internet,

476
00:27:35.611 --> 00:27:38.400
so we'd like this web page except it was a fucking warehouse.

477
00:27:38.401 --> 00:27:42.030
So we suggest a ship it out,
bringing in ship it out and all that type of stuff.

478
00:27:42.031 --> 00:27:46.830
But dude,
it was class clowns,
drug addicts and musicians.

479
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:49.680
That's what it was.
And then the people watching us,

480
00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:52.620
we're nerds who wanted to move up the fucking ladder.

481
00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:57.300
Like they wanted to get out of the non carpeted area and get into the carpeted

482
00:27:57.301 --> 00:28:00.720
area and justify their tie.
That's basically what it was.

483
00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:03.120
And we had the best that we fucking,

484
00:28:03.121 --> 00:28:07.160
everybody had an impression of everybody there.
Everybody like had Nicholas.

485
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.910
The only impression I could ever do as my landlord in mass,

486
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.320
Massachusetts misdemeanors and I'd call my fucking,

487
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:18.560
it was a three decker and they call a guy upstairs who was a pothead and I'd

488
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.560
pretend to be misdemeanors.
Yeah.
Hey,
it's misdemeanors while you get it,

489
00:28:22.561 --> 00:28:27.280
you're going to turn the heat anyway.
Fuck it off track.
You talk,
you talk,

490
00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.930
you don't edit.
No,
I know what you mean with will.

491
00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:35.970
So our boss was this guy and he had a regular voice until he got upset and when

492
00:28:36.031 --> 00:28:38.730
he would,
he would always say,
he would go up a little and be like,

493
00:28:38.731 --> 00:28:41.190
come on you guys,
Blah.
And we would all just go.

494
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.340
We just give them all of us.

495
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.210
So like he couldn't eat symphony of mocking as we were doing it.

496
00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:51.750
He would always walk away shaking his head going bunch of babies and he would

497
00:28:51.751 --> 00:28:54.900
just walk out.
And that was,
that was the worst.
We would get reprimanded.

498
00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:59.901
So I never understood why anyone would want to go into the cubicle area where

499
00:28:59.911 --> 00:29:04.020
now you were,
you were in this little fucking box.
Only one way in one way out.

500
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.360
They knew where you was supposed to be.
The warehouse,
you know,

501
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:10.080
I'm in the warehouse with a Fi's counting shit.
He's on the forklift.

502
00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:13.320
No one knew where the fuck I was really supposed to be.

503
00:29:13.321 --> 00:29:14.760
So there was an element of freedom.

504
00:29:14.761 --> 00:29:17.610
It was just basically a bigger fucking cubicle.
So,
but anyway,

505
00:29:17.611 --> 00:29:20.750
we got to get back to the hockey,
hockey,
the Sabres.

506
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:25.080
I was saying I would like them.
Um,
if they weren't in our division,

507
00:29:25.081 --> 00:29:28.820
I still like him.
I,
I'm really psyched that they went back to their old uniforms.

508
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:33.660
That's what it all comes down to.
The Canucks fucking those beautiful colors.

509
00:29:33.661 --> 00:29:35.340
I don't know if they still have,
they still have them.

510
00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:38.880
They finally went back to him when they,
they the two biggest mistakes,

511
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.610
the biggest one was Vancouver's,
I mean it was so fucking ugly that home one,

512
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.930
that mustard yellow with the orange.
Did you liked it?
Well Shit,

513
00:29:46.931 --> 00:29:47.950
you're wearing a leisure suit.

514
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.930
Tampa Bay Buccaneers creamsicles best uniform in sports history.
So yeah,

515
00:29:52.931 --> 00:29:57.610
I liked the Canucks.
Nah,
the old Astros' Astros was a great one.

516
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.550
The old Astros was a great one.
Yeah.
When you were child,
you know,

517
00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:03.190
we were talking about while we were waiting for the whole thing to come back on,

518
00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:07.180
cause we,
we were talking about that Zarek Jingle,
how that came out of nowhere.

519
00:30:07.181 --> 00:30:11.320
But then we were talking about other things like,
like fluffing up.
Yeah.

520
00:30:11.321 --> 00:30:12.011
Like how would that,

521
00:30:12.011 --> 00:30:15.430
don't even know if they make marshmallow fluff and there's no way that they

522
00:30:15.431 --> 00:30:18.910
would,
they people have to,
they'll make moxie.

523
00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.270
You can find that shit.
They probably,
but this note,

524
00:30:22.271 --> 00:30:24.310
but fluff and other was mainstream.

525
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:27.310
Like in my neighborhood was peanut butter and fluff.

526
00:30:27.311 --> 00:30:29.440
But I don't know if it was just a new England thing.

527
00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:34.070
A lot of shit I thought was mainstream.
Oh no one drank moxy ever anywhere.

528
00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:38.530
I never heard of that.
I've heard soda.
No taste is like,
uh,

529
00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.790
I dunno.
It was like they Yeager Meister of soda.

530
00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.570
It first hit your mouth,
it tasted like cola and then the head,

531
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:53.110
the most horrific aftertaste that just made you want to drink more to get that

532
00:30:53.111 --> 00:30:56.500
first taste to get this second taste out of your mouth and then,
yeah,

533
00:30:56.501 --> 00:31:00.940
then it was all legal.
It's all with do you remember can in my fridge at home,

534
00:31:00.941 --> 00:31:05.500
I had it mailed to me.
Do you remember marathon bars?

535
00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.210
They had this candy bar for the youngsters here or listening or whatever it

536
00:31:10.211 --> 00:31:15.211
marathon bar was basically it was just a 100% caramel twist it around in like a

537
00:31:15.911 --> 00:31:19.060
pretzel thing,
like a long stick.
And their big thing was,

538
00:31:19.061 --> 00:31:20.710
it was so long as a marathon,

539
00:31:20.711 --> 00:31:24.610
Barb was going to take you like a fucking hour to somehow consumed all your

540
00:31:24.611 --> 00:31:27.520
fillings out of your,
and you'd sit there and like you literally had to bite.

541
00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.920
I was like,
you're pulling a pin out of a grenade you had to fuck on.

542
00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.090
Just rip the thing.
That was one of those questions where we,
what's that fucking,

543
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.820
and we had to describe the candy bar.
What was the name?

544
00:31:36.821 --> 00:31:40.960
And it took us for fucking ever to remember.
Marathon bar bar.
Oh,

545
00:31:40.961 --> 00:31:44.190
Henry's all of that shit.
Just anyway,
back to hockey.

546
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:49.170
I fucking hate me for being here.
Back to hockey.
So my Boston Bruins,
three,

547
00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:53.560
three and two,
we're down two games to one now.
Now were up three games to two.

548
00:31:53.561 --> 00:31:56.890
I still think it's going seven.
And um,

549
00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:02.020
I think it was a bad move.
I'm Sean Thornton,
sprayed water at PK.

550
00:32:02.021 --> 00:32:05.140
Sue on at the end of the game was just,
was not a smart move.

551
00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:09.760
Like you don't rile up super hot on the heels of the whole clippers scandal.

552
00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:11.970
You don't spray water on the old scandal.

553
00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.770
Forget about what you know of certain percentage of the Bruins fan base.

554
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:19.300
When he scored an overtime goal in the end.
Word was trending on Twitter.
I mean,

555
00:32:19.301 --> 00:32:22.450
dude,
you think you have vintage,
what's your leisure suit?

556
00:32:22.451 --> 00:32:24.730
You should see some of the Twitter accounts of Bruins fans.

557
00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:28.570
I'm so fucking embarrassing.
It's so fucking embarrassing.

558
00:32:28.571 --> 00:32:31.030
It's so takes away from the game.

559
00:32:31.031 --> 00:32:36.031
But a PK is quickly becoming a guy despite the fact that he plays for a team

560
00:32:36.941 --> 00:32:38.820
that I hate.
You can't fucking hate the guy.

561
00:32:38.821 --> 00:32:41.510
It's dare a Derek Jeter kind of thing where,
you know,

562
00:32:41.511 --> 00:32:43.070
he was always a good player,
but now he's,

563
00:32:43.071 --> 00:32:47.540
he's a legitimate superstar at this point.
And um,
he's just one of those guys.

564
00:32:47.541 --> 00:32:50.960
He plays physical defense.
He can,
he can,
he's just,

565
00:32:50.961 --> 00:32:53.660
he's got the whole defense thing down and then if there's an offensive time,

566
00:32:53.661 --> 00:32:54.980
he can jump up into the play.

567
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.370
He came out and he came on my favorite goals of this,
this playoff,

568
00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.430
and I hated that was against us,
but it was right as the penalty.

569
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:05.090
He was in the box.
Right,
right.
As the penalties.
It's like three,
two,

570
00:33:05.091 --> 00:33:06.530
one and I'm thrown off.
Fuck,

571
00:33:06.531 --> 00:33:08.960
he's coming out of the box and just the dude hit them in stride.

572
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.820
He went down there,
he looked like a Ford.
He didn't look like it.

573
00:33:11.821 --> 00:33:14.390
Defensemen at all.
And a lot of people don't realize how big that guy is.

574
00:33:14.391 --> 00:33:17.570
I went to a Canadians game earlier this year and he's fucking,
he's a monster.

575
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.950
So what,

576
00:33:18.951 --> 00:33:22.250
having said that John Thorton and towards the end of the game and he's on the

577
00:33:22.251 --> 00:33:26.120
bench,
he sprayed water in his face and it's just like,

578
00:33:26.121 --> 00:33:28.770
why would you add?
Yeah,

579
00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.990
those are crushing defeats and now you,
you,

580
00:33:31.991 --> 00:33:35.330
you got this guy even more fucking motivated.
You mean he still,

581
00:33:35.331 --> 00:33:37.430
when the game was over,
he still scored a fucking goal.

582
00:33:37.431 --> 00:33:41.030
This guy is Freddy Krueger.
He's not going away.
He's not.
He's,
he's,

583
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:44.060
he's just going to keep coming.
So,
um,

584
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.120
I also loved the fine Sean Thornton got fined like $2,863 until the set really

585
00:33:51.171 --> 00:33:54.320
specific thing like it was,
we tried to make it sound official.

586
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.280
What do you have cleared three grand if PK didn't have a visor on and it went

587
00:33:58.281 --> 00:34:01.280
directly in his fucking,
I like is the cost of dry cleaning?

588
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:06.500
How is that what it is?
I don't know.
So anyways,
I think I actually,

589
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:09.740
I'm hoping we're going to close them out tonight,
which we could do,
but,
um,

590
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:12.920
I've watched enough hockey to know that there's going to be a game seven and I

591
00:34:12.921 --> 00:34:15.260
think that they're really going to have the jump on us tonight.

592
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:17.500
I hate to say all of that,
but I,

593
00:34:17.501 --> 00:34:22.430
I think already that they weren't going to fucking want go out on a limb and I'm

594
00:34:22.431 --> 00:34:27.190
going to guarantee a Bruins victory tonight.
No game seven yet.

595
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.890
Said he had another reason why there's going to be a game seven.
I think.
Uh,
it's,

596
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:35.180
it's Romans Canadians.
It has to go say gay seven games,
four to two.

597
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:38.710
I'll even tell you the number.
Hey,
I hope you're right.
I hope you're right.
But I,

598
00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.800
I,
you know,
the organization's to fucking what happened then?
What is it?

599
00:34:42.801 --> 00:34:47.570
Fucking a habs the uh,
happy tons.
It's a French thing.
I forget.

600
00:34:47.571 --> 00:34:51.950
Happy tons.
Like the habitats.
It's the French.
It was basically,

601
00:34:51.951 --> 00:34:54.230
I think that that's the name.
And Americans before they,
uh,

602
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:57.950
the native North Americans before they did whatever they did to him.

603
00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:01.160
I think that they called them that,
right?
No,
they wouldn't.

604
00:35:01.161 --> 00:35:06.080
Why would they say that?
Because they didn't speak French.
I Dunno.

605
00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:06.621
You know what,
you know,

606
00:35:06.621 --> 00:35:08.720
that's one of those things I've looked up a zillion times.
Also,

607
00:35:08.721 --> 00:35:10.760
like the Bruins logo,
the spokes.

608
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.330
It's supposed to be the hub or I can't have a fucking remember,

609
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:18.320
but I can remember the Zarek thing cause that's how fucking delicious it was.

610
00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:23.240
All right.
Here's my podcast question before I forget.
Okay.
Oh yeah.
Doug,

611
00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:25.670
Stan hope has a bunch of Monday morning podcast questions.

612
00:35:25.671 --> 00:35:28.130
We're going to go behind the scenes here.
When you,

613
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:33.080
you obviously when you read a letter,
an email from a a fan.

614
00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.690
I have some right here.
Yeah,
we'll,
we'll,
we'll get to one.

615
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.920
Obviously you haven't read it before,

616
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.760
but they're not random because you'd just get every third one would be,

617
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.250
what the fuck?
What are you playing?
North?
Andover.

618
00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:49.240
So who does who prescribed?
Andrew.
Fabulous.
He,
he,

619
00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.600
he pulls him for me.
He kind of knows the ones that I like.

620
00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:58.660
And then,
so what I thought was,
I bet Nia does it.

621
00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:03.430
I always thought that,
well,
no,
no,
no,
no,
you don't.
You don't want to like,

622
00:36:03.431 --> 00:36:07.000
I probably seem like you're in your basement and she's the only human being in

623
00:36:07.001 --> 00:36:11.880
your universe that you can yell.
Ah,
fuck.
Ah,

624
00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:16.440
so I thought maybe she did it.
No,
she uh,
no,

625
00:36:16.441 --> 00:36:17.910
she comes on the podcast.

626
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:21.510
She's had so couple of fucking great rants recently and I was kind of hoping

627
00:36:21.511 --> 00:36:25.230
that I could get around,
but she's been a,
should be some real busy with her.

628
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:29.250
I brought flowers for a reason.
I go,
she's not going to like me.

629
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.080
Nia is not going to like me.

630
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.400
So I brought flowers to suck up the second she saw your leisure suits.

631
00:36:35.401 --> 00:36:38.580
She's really big into fashion and she love it.
She would absolutely love,

632
00:36:38.581 --> 00:36:41.640
but I'll,
I'll,
we'll get a picture.
Will soften the blow of Doug.

633
00:36:41.641 --> 00:36:45.210
Stan hope by getting flowers and a nice picture of you in the League and the

634
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:46.230
leisure suit or anything.

635
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:48.900
Well it speaking about you gotta you have any more behind the scenes?
No,
no.

636
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:52.330
I thought if I come up with them I'll interrupt your train of what,

637
00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:56.640
what color my pajamas are when I'm lying in there recording.
Um,
all right.
His,

638
00:36:56.650 --> 00:37:00.630
let's,
let's read a couple of questions here.
Um,
this is from a listener,

639
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:05.340
a tug McGraw.
Remember tug McGraw Plays Ball player played for the Phillies,

640
00:37:05.341 --> 00:37:10.240
used to slap his thigh with his glove when he not getting all amped up.
No.
Yeah,

641
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.480
when they were taken down your Astros or whatever the fuck they be.

642
00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:15.870
Just like the uniforms.
Okay.
Sorry.
Okay,
Bill,

643
00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.960
how about the NFL players suspended for smoking weed though?

644
00:37:18.961 --> 00:37:20.160
I think it was a guy in the browns.

645
00:37:20.161 --> 00:37:23.040
The guy like led the league and receiving get suspended because he was smoking

646
00:37:23.041 --> 00:37:27.360
weed.
Um,
this guy says,
how ancient is that mindset?

647
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.260
Dear Nfl,

648
00:37:28.261 --> 00:37:33.060
please let the guy who destroys his body for your rating smoke a joint to help

649
00:37:33.061 --> 00:37:37.480
relax his body,
mind,
and muscles.
So he doesn't take it out on his girlfriend or,

650
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:41.820
or her kids.
Uh,
I love how he can't be married with his own kids.
Also.

651
00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:43.300
Here's a great,
Hey,
you know what,

652
00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:46.330
Michael Sam has brought us to a place where he might be beaten up.

653
00:37:46.331 --> 00:37:48.400
His boyfriend after a bad game.

654
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:54.040
That duty just made out.
Like when he got signed to the rand drafted,

655
00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:57.970
he got drafted by the rams and then made out with his boyfriend to celebrate on

656
00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:00.850
national TV.
It was a beautiful day.

657
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:04.240
I was on Santa Monica Boulevard and I tried to high five gay men,

658
00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:08.610
Michael Sam.
I literally tried to high five a gay guy outside of the,

659
00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:13.430
out of the closet.
God though,
do you realize he's like not high five me bags?

660
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:18.560
It just went from fucking 1900 and the NFL to like fucking 2018 I think they're

661
00:38:20.641 --> 00:38:24.670
actually ahead.
Um,
oh yeah,
I did not see that.

662
00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:28.060
It was fucking beautiful.
I did not see that.
I have to admit it.
I said home.

663
00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:31.420
Is that a white boyfriend too?
So as interracial on top of that,

664
00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:33.550
he fucking leans down and kisses it.
Small,

665
00:38:33.551 --> 00:38:38.551
petite white man and celebrate his draft as a linebacker for the Saint Louis

666
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:41.820
Rams.
I gotta be honest with something and you don't,

667
00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:43.050
you're not supposed to allow you.
Yeah.

668
00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:44.470
You're not supposed to admit to your flaws.

669
00:38:44.471 --> 00:38:46.840
He's supposed to act like I don't see color and I'm not homophobic.

670
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.790
I'm not homophobic.
I like to think,

671
00:38:48.791 --> 00:38:51.760
but that actually made me uncomfortable thinking about that.
Why would that be?

672
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:57.310
I was site that he was going to be in the NFL.
Right.
And I also,

673
00:38:57.311 --> 00:38:59.460
I also want a doorbell.
Knowing my also want,

674
00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:03.640
I also want him to dominate because I was hoping he was going to play on my team

675
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:07.990
and he was going to dominate because it's a whole other level that it would know

676
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.030
the other team's fans,
like the homophobes.

677
00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:12.820
It'd be annoying if he just fucking was a beast out there.

678
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:17.680
But then him kissing the other dude that,
that I was trying to laugh about it,

679
00:39:17.681 --> 00:39:22.300
but it made me uncomfortable with,
but incredible.
But it was wicked good.

680
00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:25.390
Like,
I guess I got some shit I need to work on.
I,
you know,

681
00:39:25.391 --> 00:39:27.670
I guess I'm not used to it yet.
I,
uh,

682
00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:32.110
I like to think I don't see color,
but I do,
but I don't see,

683
00:39:32.111 --> 00:39:36.610
weight is a weird thing.
Fat People,
I'm off topic.
No,
I do.

684
00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:39.700
I see.
Wait,
now I also see Carla at night.
I see color.

685
00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:43.540
I ignite and ice was on fat people.
I don't notice when,

686
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:47.430
I never thought of that guy is fat till you mentioned it.
But yeah,

687
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:50.710
everybody sees color.
I hate when people say that I don't see color.

688
00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.170
And it doesn't matter if you're purple,
red.
It's like,

689
00:39:53.171 --> 00:39:55.570
now you'd fucking notice that.
I just notice that.

690
00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:59.260
And you notice white people's singing in England and there's,
yeah,

691
00:39:59.261 --> 00:40:03.930
I crossed the street.
I see it.
There's a group of,
fuck.
Hey,

692
00:40:03.931 --> 00:40:08.500
you Asian.
I don't see color.
I can't tell you.
How are you African American.
Yeah.

693
00:40:08.501 --> 00:40:10.060
I need to know when to cross the street.

694
00:40:10.061 --> 00:40:12.280
And if there's a bunch of the same colored people,

695
00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:17.320
they're probably looking for an enemy.
I don't,
I don't want to be it.
Yeah.

696
00:40:17.321 --> 00:40:19.100
If the second you fill out numbered,
yeah,

697
00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.300
we definitely sit down where everyone's white.
You Go,
well,
okay,

698
00:40:22.301 --> 00:40:25.210
now I see where I'm going to be the enemy despite my color.

699
00:40:25.211 --> 00:40:28.380
But I still see a group of the same color guy saw a bunch of white guys was

700
00:40:28.381 --> 00:40:32.900
skinhead with shaved heads.
Right,
right.
Fucking football hooligans.
Yes.

701
00:40:32.901 --> 00:40:37.210
It's terrifying.
You would be,
I don't see color or they don't see the danger.

702
00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:41.590
I think accountants,
what do they do?
It must be dressed down Wednesdays.

703
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.610
No,
you see it and uh,
you know,

704
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.700
I don't know at night when fear comes up that you know,
you,

705
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:51.550
you think the worst ice do have been on my act,
that you know,

706
00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.000
everybody's racist at night and you have to be,
and that's how you get home.

707
00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.310
You just have to think the worst of people.

708
00:40:57.311 --> 00:41:00.130
So you can make it to your car in the parking lot.
And whenever they are,

709
00:41:00.131 --> 00:41:02.200
if they're Asian,
they were fucking Ninja.
Sure.

710
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:06.460
There are Chinese communist coming.
Oh,
it's just begun.
And I'm the first victim.

711
00:41:06.461 --> 00:41:09.280
You have to think that stuff.
And then also when you tell these anecdotes,

712
00:41:09.281 --> 00:41:13.810
you have to pick somebody like Asians so you don't get in trouble to certain

713
00:41:13.811 --> 00:41:17.350
certain groups.
Certain groups get you in more trouble.
Armenians.
Yeah.

714
00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.640
Talk all like if I used an African American or a Jewish anecdote there,

715
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:24.640
I'd be in trouble right now.
Dollar Shave club would be running,

716
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:26.680
would be running in the other direction.

717
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:29.620
Then we have more ads or are we going to,
we do what we do.

718
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:33.410
We didn't answer the question.
What do you think should show these show?
Uh,

719
00:41:33.411 --> 00:41:37.690
the guide be suspended.
The NFL player for smoking a little bit,
but you know,

720
00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:42.960
in the last 24 hours there was interracial male tongue kissing celebrate up.

721
00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:50.540
So I probably didn't use,
it may be I'm exaggerating the tongue,

722
00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:54.290
but they kissed deep and passionate.
Did move on,
hit a single or a home.
Right.

723
00:41:54.291 --> 00:41:55.220
It was an RBI.

724
00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:02.130
I say he knocked it out of the park,
but I was wrong.
Ah,
Jesus Christ.
But yeah,
no,

725
00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:05.750
I hope he wins the super bowl and he's the MVP and you know,

726
00:42:05.751 --> 00:42:08.930
they have like their family and stuff.
I just hope he's out there.

727
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.680
Just just goes at it,
man.
That's going to be fucking hold on Disney world.

728
00:42:12.681 --> 00:42:15.530
I'm going to a bathhouse.
I'll do.
Okay.

729
00:42:15.531 --> 00:42:18.290
Who's going to be the first one to lose his fucking job or get fined?

730
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:23.120
Let's go down the rams roster and let's try to guess who's the first one who's

731
00:42:23.121 --> 00:42:24.110
got,
oh my God.

732
00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:29.540
Somebody's going to say something to think of a ram other than Sam Bradford.

733
00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:34.910
Poor bastard.
Who's another one?
It's one.
What happened to the rent?

734
00:42:34.911 --> 00:42:39.290
Mike Marks is what happened to the rams and that Shitty fucking day of one of

735
00:42:39.291 --> 00:42:42.320
the worst stadiums like I've ever been to.
It's like,

736
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:47.560
it's like if the twins ship the homer dome down to fucking a Saint Louis and you

737
00:42:48.801 --> 00:42:52.850
played football in it.
If there was a team that's coming to la,

738
00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.540
it's the rams coming back.
They should.
No one gives a fuck about the rams.

739
00:42:56.541 --> 00:42:58.130
It's like Delaware is a state.

740
00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.760
You just forget that it even exists and the news comes out of there.

741
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:04.280
What's your favorite state,
Doug?
With favorite state?

742
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:11.730
You look at states the way you look at music for different reasons.
Yeah,
and I,

743
00:43:11.731 --> 00:43:15.830
I mean I like Wyoming and Montana.
You just did that.
The red state tour.

744
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:20.570
I loved the fucking gorgeous out there.
It is.
But I don't tell people that.

745
00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:24.910
Well,
I always say that when I always have the rosiest fucking outlook all years,

746
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:29.690
every,
every tour you do is great.
Every audience is fantastic as you know what,

747
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:31.440
because this is what I did.

748
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:35.150
I spent the first half of my life being an angry country,

749
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:39.500
sleeping on a futon and somewhere around,
you know,
approaching 40.

750
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:43.400
I was just like,
so this is the guy I'm going to be.
And I also,
I,
you know,

751
00:43:43.401 --> 00:43:47.120
what I did was I kind of learned how to,
uh,
get out of my,
keep making that face.

752
00:43:47.121 --> 00:43:50.930
It's going to stick like that.
Yeah.
My depressing downward spiral.

753
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:55.550
I figured out how to stop it.
Like,
fortunately I don't have clinical depression,

754
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:59.840
but I am,
I am geared towards negative,
cynical thought.

755
00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:04.010
So what I would just do is I just just started thinking,
okay,

756
00:44:04.011 --> 00:44:05.150
is that what you want to think today?

757
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:07.310
This is what we're gonna do this one fucking day.

758
00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:11.900
Then I'll let new agey shit and I just started going to the gym.
You know,
I just,

759
00:44:11.901 --> 00:44:14.960
I just started.
They don't,
when I went on the road I would do shit.

760
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.690
Don't you ever have a fucking horrible show?

761
00:44:17.691 --> 00:44:21.620
Like one time I want to hear you come on Monday morning podcast is bill burr.

762
00:44:21.621 --> 00:44:26.160
I just played Toronto.
What a bunch of fucking assholes.
No,
here's the deal.

763
00:44:26.161 --> 00:44:28.940
But at this point people are coming to see me.
Yeah know.

764
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.090
So I'm going to get mad at them
that point.

765
00:44:33.091 --> 00:44:38.040
If I have a bad show,
it's kind of on me.
It's like I come out and they clap.

766
00:44:38.041 --> 00:44:39.480
Like I already killed for an hour.

767
00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:44.980
So it's completely up to me to feel like this weekend I was in San Diego and um,

768
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.470
I was trying to put together one I'm going to do and I was a little off on a

769
00:44:49.471 --> 00:44:52.950
couple of shows and when I got off stage I was mad at myself.

770
00:44:52.951 --> 00:44:54.940
I wasn't mad at anybody in the crowd.
And,
you know,

771
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:57.370
it was a couple of drunk people and some people yelled out.

772
00:44:57.371 --> 00:45:01.640
But like I never get mad at that because I think that that's what makes this art

773
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:06.380
unique,
that you can sit there and yell out at the person and,
and,

774
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:09.390
and you just have to fucking deal with it.
And I don't like that shit when,

775
00:45:09.391 --> 00:45:12.210
if somebody yells something out and immediately they're going to go throw him

776
00:45:12.211 --> 00:45:16.320
out.
Like I'm this precious fucking hope diamond or some shit.
It's like,
no,

777
00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:19.830
I'm saying a bunch of shit up here that should make you go like,
dude,

778
00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.530
you don't even,
what the fuck you're talking about.
So I mean,

779
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:25.270
the only heckler I don't like is basically if you're going to um,

780
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:27.420
talk and ignore it.
Yeah.
If you're,
yeah,

781
00:45:27.421 --> 00:45:30.900
if you're just yelling to yell and you're not going to shut up no matter what,

782
00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:33.600
then at that point,
I can still deal with that.

783
00:45:33.601 --> 00:45:35.880
But I ended up feeling bad for the people who came out.

784
00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:40.860
I put them in a show in Daytona beach a couple of months ago.
I don't know when,

785
00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:45.090
but I had to throw a guy out from the beginning that before the show,

786
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:47.880
I'm watching this,
no way this guy is going to make it.

787
00:45:47.881 --> 00:45:52.140
He's too drunk and he's out in the lobby and he recognizes me.

788
00:45:52.141 --> 00:45:56.520
But you can see he's trying to focus and say words and I hide and then he's in

789
00:45:56.521 --> 00:46:00.830
the front row and I'm like,
I Corsi is through this.
[inaudible]

790
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.290
was an old bit like it was so broke.

791
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.250
I went through the motions.
I know at some point he's going to try to talk,

792
00:46:08.251 --> 00:46:09.210
he's not going to happen.

793
00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:14.190
So it was like I would did a tired closing bit with the whole,
okay,

794
00:46:14.191 --> 00:46:17.240
you're not gonna make it unless John Goodman comes in at the,

795
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:20.610
like at the end of the movie flight and it gives you bloat.

796
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:24.510
You went out on stage.
It's Roma.
I know what's going to happen.

797
00:46:24.511 --> 00:46:28.260
So I just watched the whole thing.
It was fluid.
I would,

798
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:32.760
I caressed him out of the room like it.
Like it was a part of my act.

799
00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:37.380
I had to go many times for being that drunk that I like.

800
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:41.190
I like it.
This should be on my setlist.
Okay.

801
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:45.180
Open with the thing about driving down here,
throw drunk.

802
00:46:45.181 --> 00:46:50.130
I out segue into a retardation.
That's amazing.
I had a guy one time,

803
00:46:50.131 --> 00:46:54.420
I was at the DC Improv and uh,
he was one of those guys,
like,

804
00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.490
I'm not even going to say what he was doing.

805
00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.640
I'll tell you off air because if I say it's you some asshole listening to this

806
00:46:59.641 --> 00:47:00.474
is then going to do it.

807
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:02.790
But he was doing this annoying thing where he wasn't laughing,

808
00:47:02.791 --> 00:47:04.080
he was doing something else.
So,

809
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:10.430
and I got into it with them and like whatever we did the,
we did the fuck.

810
00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:14.640
Did he get kicked?
No,
no,
he didn't get kicked out.
So I go,
so I'm like,
all right,

811
00:47:14.641 --> 00:47:17.070
so that's the one Yahoo for the weekend.
Cause you know you're going to get one,

812
00:47:17.071 --> 00:47:19.680
it's going to be a fucking nightmare.
Right.
So the fucking very next night,

813
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:21.090
who comes walking in the door again?

814
00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:25.610
The same fucking guy and the wait staff or whoever's seats,

815
00:47:25.611 --> 00:47:29.710
some hears him say,
I'm going to fucking yell out all his punchlines.

816
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.490
And they sit them right down in the front row.

817
00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:37.540
So now I'm going out there and I'm fucking riffing and I'm trying to switch it

818
00:47:37.541 --> 00:47:38.890
up and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

819
00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:42.130
And he yelled out the first punchline and I was so ready for it.

820
00:47:42.131 --> 00:47:45.370
I fucking snapped.
And we ended up throwing him out.

821
00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:47.290
And uh,

822
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:52.640
and the crowd was pissed at me because they didn't know the backstory.

823
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:55.900
They weren't there.
I remember this guy afterwards,
I'm selling my CD,
right.

824
00:47:55.901 --> 00:47:59.830
And this guy comes up to,
dude,
that was fucking bullshit.
That's bullshit.

825
00:47:59.831 --> 00:48:01.960
You're the headline,
are you and you should have to deal with that.

826
00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:02.921
And I was going,
no.

827
00:48:02.921 --> 00:48:06.880
And I tried to explain it and then he just wouldn't let me talk.
And then I said,

828
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:10.930
you know what you should do,
you should never come to one of my shows again.

829
00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:13.330
That'll show me.
Cause it just got to the point of like,
no,
it wasn't.

830
00:48:13.331 --> 00:48:17.080
It was like probably like six people who were flipping out.
But it was a,

831
00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:18.610
and it was a classic thing.

832
00:48:18.611 --> 00:48:22.750
They kicked the guy out and I'm standing there selling my wares,

833
00:48:22.751 --> 00:48:25.360
whoring myself out,
getting to the end of the line.

834
00:48:25.361 --> 00:48:28.700
I look up who standing in line,
that guy,
they kicked it out.

835
00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.420
Like this is how comedy clubs kicked people out.

836
00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:35.980
They get 'em an inch beyond the threshold or just the front door and then they

837
00:48:35.981 --> 00:48:39.460
turn their back and then they go over and fucking,
or the problem have a,

838
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:41.110
put a some potato skins or something.

839
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:44.740
And then here's that fucking guide back in like,
so I had to tell them like,
hey,

840
00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:47.650
in the future when you kick some ya can you kick them all the way out?

841
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:52.090
Can you make sure there's no,
did he say,
ah,
he was just going,

842
00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:56.860
but we don't understand.
I love you.
You don't understand.
I love you.

843
00:48:56.861 --> 00:48:58.660
Like he was trying to say,
it was like,
dude,
you don't understand.

844
00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:02.320
The first night he was trying to prove how much I love you.
Bye.
See,

845
00:49:02.321 --> 00:49:06.040
I know every punchline.
He was,
no,
but the first name,

846
00:49:06.041 --> 00:49:09.190
I can't remember which night we,
we've,
we've,
it must've been the second night,

847
00:49:09.191 --> 00:49:11.110
but the first night we're,
no,

848
00:49:11.111 --> 00:49:13.990
he was just trying to say that he was yelling up because he loved my stuff and

849
00:49:13.991 --> 00:49:18.520
it was,
and he was just so fucking drunk.
There was no and dumb and dumb.

850
00:49:18.521 --> 00:49:21.730
It's not like when he's sobered up,
like this level of fucking intelligence was,

851
00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:26.110
was going to come back.
He was just a fucking moron.
And um,

852
00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:29.020
it was kind of one of those things like that kind of person I had to kind of

853
00:49:29.021 --> 00:49:32.070
burn off from my crowd.
Like when you first get your,
your,

854
00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.120
your people finally coming up to see you,

855
00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:37.510
your site and then that this people are going to come on and see and be like,
oh,

856
00:49:37.511 --> 00:49:40.480
I thought he was this way.
He's actually that way.
And then they don't come back.

857
00:49:40.481 --> 00:49:43.370
And then hopefully the rest of the room gets filled up with people who kind of

858
00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:48.400
second youtube clip on a subject that they already have and they go,
oh yeah,

859
00:49:48.401 --> 00:49:52.510
this guy,
they see it'd be clean on TV.
And they go,
oh,
there's a wholesome guy.

860
00:49:52.511 --> 00:49:54.100
And then he come down there,
let that fucking,

861
00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:58.600
and then they get up in the middle of it.
Now then of course you blame them.
Um,

862
00:49:58.601 --> 00:50:00.670
all right,
let me do a little more advertising then.
We'll,
uh,

863
00:50:00.671 --> 00:50:02.620
we got to wrap this thing up here.
Sure.
To do it.

864
00:50:02.621 --> 00:50:07.060
I'm so fucking site just to see you man.
Cause I,
I never get to see you.

865
00:50:07.061 --> 00:50:11.470
You've been one of my favorites sense since you had the long hair and you had

866
00:50:11.471 --> 00:50:15.850
that head shot.
We had the fucking Santa Claus hat on.
I remember that one.

867
00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:16.540
I remember,

868
00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:21.540
I remember getting you a in the Chilkoot Charlie's in Alaska.

869
00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:26.560
I thought it was,
can greenroom to [inaudible] had a band horns.
Yeah.
No,

870
00:50:26.561 --> 00:50:27.860
and that was horrific.

871
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.570
But I always had an affinity for horror gigs like that and terrible

872
00:50:32.571 --> 00:50:36.400
accommodations when they're that bad that they're comical.
And I,
Oh,

873
00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.870
I thought you might think it was funny too.
And you're like,

874
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:42.740
I can't believe you sent me to that fucking place.
That rat trap.

875
00:50:42.741 --> 00:50:46.430
I had to stay in.
I didn't mind the GIG.
That gig was fine.
The fucking,

876
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.970
that is the worst fucking place.
Absolutely.

877
00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:53.380
Hating the magic at Burns on the television set.

878
00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.810
The mattress literally was caved in in the middle and then when the fucking

879
00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.380
covers were so ratty,
I just said I just have to make this my own.

880
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:03.690
And I laid down in it.
I remember I ran into Ralphie may Rodney make,

881
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:06.690
they couldn't put them in the band house cause the floorboards were too weak.

882
00:51:06.691 --> 00:51:10.250
They had actually give him a hotel.
Is that what happened?
Because he said to me,

883
00:51:10.251 --> 00:51:12.530
he goes,
I didn't fucking stay there.
He goes,
I took one look at,

884
00:51:12.531 --> 00:51:14.120
I said I'm not staying here.
That they took,

885
00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:18.050
they took one look at Ralphie may and when we can't put them in there,

886
00:51:18.051 --> 00:51:20.240
he would literally go through the floors.

887
00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:25.550
Yeah cause it was that big button though.
His lie gave me self esteem.

888
00:51:25.551 --> 00:51:27.170
I just started saying,
I'm not staying here.

889
00:51:27.171 --> 00:51:28.940
I need to get me a fucking hotel room.

890
00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:31.790
I brought half the fucking rooms I stayed in.

891
00:51:31.791 --> 00:51:34.670
You were there the week before and had done something with a midget and a

892
00:51:34.671 --> 00:51:39.650
fucking God knows what.
Then you wiped the new John Fox.
Yeah,
you were.

893
00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:40.790
You weren't like,

894
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:44.540
I loved you but doing the road so much I was starting to fucking hate you.

895
00:51:44.541 --> 00:51:45.600
I was like this motherfucker,

896
00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:49.610
how does he know where I'm going to be and gets there the week before and

897
00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:53.960
fucking does something to the pillow case with his fucking Taynton ball bag was

898
00:51:53.961 --> 00:51:58.640
horrific.
I always said the cure for aids was in the under the bed,

899
00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.010
in the rug of a comedy condo.

900
00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:04.640
Just the amount of band house in Alaska.

901
00:52:04.641 --> 00:52:09.641
I actually took a bar of soap onto stage that was in the shower there cause it

902
00:52:09.921 --> 00:52:14.600
had black mold and I'm like,
if you think I'm making up jokes about the band has,

903
00:52:14.601 --> 00:52:19.040
this is the soap when you're growing mold on an antibacterial products.

904
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:24.560
That's how bad the fucking place was.
Yeah,
dude and I and I never went back.

905
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:28.310
I never,
if I went back,
let me,
let's do a little la advertising here.

wires.

931
00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:48.360
The only way for a business to avoid the post office was the least a postage

932
00:53:48.361 --> 00:53:52.380
meter.

but those posters,

933
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:54.060
postage meters haven't.

00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:49.260

No,

956

I smelled bad.
I email myself.

957

Well,
I can't tell you don't come much closer to the Raytheon of Europe's outfit.

961
00:55:41.941 --> 00:55:45.030
I got a bunch of Cubans in my Hubris humidor.
If he wants to smoke,

962
00:55:45.031 --> 00:55:47.910
I would love to.
I'd love to hang out with them and a dude,

963
00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:51.570
I fucking love you to death,
man.
It's so great to see you.
I wish you lived in La,

964
00:55:51.571 --> 00:55:54.500
man.
I really wish she could come in more often.
Wait,
what?
Yeah,

965
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:58.350
you are out in Arizona,
right?
Yeah.
All right.
We know what happened.
Weird place.

966
00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:02.220
I'll buy an experimental aircraft.
I'll get out there.
Crash land on your front.

967
00:56:02.221 --> 00:56:05.280
Fucking cactus.
All right.
That's the podcast for this week.

968
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:08.730
The one and only Doug Stan Open.
If you're brand new to this guy,
I'm telling you,

969
00:56:08.731 --> 00:56:12.090
man,
this guy is one of the greatest comedians I've ever seen.

970
00:56:12.091 --> 00:56:15.510
Definitely without a doubt.
One of the best of my generation.
Then in a long time,

971
00:56:15.511 --> 00:56:18.570
dude,
I know you don't like feel the same way about you serve compliments.
Well,

972
00:56:18.571 --> 00:56:21.300
you know something at some point,
dude,
we ought to try to do a,

973
00:56:21.301 --> 00:56:24.660
we had to try to do a co headline things somewhere.
It's something random.

974
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:28.570
Vegas is always the place to do that because you know I burned and a fan base.

975
00:56:28.571 --> 00:56:30.760
Everyone's from out of town and you can,
yeah,

976
00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:34.720
some reason I want to go to yellow knife.
I don't know that.
I'd rather do that.

977
00:56:34.721 --> 00:56:37.060
Why don't we do that?
Weird.
Yeah.
Yukon territory.

978
00:56:37.061 --> 00:56:40.360
You didn't go there on your Canadian tour,
so yeah.
Fuck.
Why don't,

979
00:56:40.361 --> 00:56:42.100
why don't we do a one off up there?
Yeah.

980
00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:45.370
See what roughneck oil workers Escobar run into.

981
00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:47.680
I'm going to go to some random place,
the middle of fucking nowhere.

982
00:56:47.681 --> 00:56:50.830
I'm in and do like a three hour show.
All right.
You're up for it.
All right,
Doug.

983
00:56:50.831 --> 00:56:53.070
Stanhope everybody,

Go fuck yourselves.
